				<td>SPRING-MASS DAMPER SYSTEM FOR VEHICLE TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]	The present invention relates generally to vehicle powertrain systems,<br>
and more particularly to power transmissions having attached thereto a torsional<br>
damper assembly for minimizing or cancelling the compression pulses, vibrations, and<br>
associated noise produced by an internal combustion engine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	Most conventional motorized vehicles include a powertrain with a power<br>
source, such as an internal combustion engine or ICE, connected to a power transmission<br>
adapted to manipulate and transmit power from the engine to a final drive system (e.g.,<br>
driveshaft, differential, and wheels.) Some transmissions include a hydrodynamic input<br>
device, such as a torque converter, positioned between the engine and the transmission.<br>
The torque converter is a hydrokinetic fluid coupling employed predominantly to allow<br>
the engine to run without stalling when the vehicle wheels and transmission gears come<br>
to a stop, and to provide torque multiplication in the lower speed range of the engine.<br>
Certain torque converter assemblies integrate a torque converter clutch (TCC), also<br>
known as a lockup clutch, to provide a bypass mechanism, allowing the engine to<br>
circumvent the torque converter and transmit power directly to the transmission.<br>
[0003]	As a result of intermittent combustion and cyclical piston motion, ICEs<br>
may generate torsionals or vibrations during normal operation that are undesirable to<br>
transmit to the vehicle transmission. The degree of engine torsional excitation is<br>
typically exacerbated in proportion with the number of cylinders. ICEs equipped with<br>
displacement-on-demand functionality can selectively deactivate certain engine cylinders<br>
to save on fuel. This mode of operation may produce distinctive (or inconsistent)<br>
torque fluctuations from the engine operating on all cylinders. Finally, an ICE may<br>
also generate compression pulses during startup and shutdown operations.<br>
[0004]	To isolate and counteract the unwanted torsionals generated by the engine,<br>
various damper systems have been implemented into the powertrain system. These<br><br>
dampers are generally packaged between the engine's output shaft (e.g., crankshaft) and<br>
the input shaft of the transmission (e.g., turbine shaft.) Some damping devices are<br>
configured with coil springs that have the capacity to carry maximum engine torque plus<br>
some margin above. To this regard, the lockup clutch may include elongated arc-<br>
shaped, circumferentially extending springs that are compressed when a shock or<br>
torsional vibration occurs during a lockup operation, i.e., engagement of the lockup<br>
clutch.<br>
[0005]	In hybrid-type vehicles (e.g., a vehicle configured with a powertrain<br>
using one or more electric motors individually or in concert with an ICE for<br>
propulsion), the hybrid ICE typically operates at lower speeds more often than in<br>
traditional automobiles, and can be turned on and off while the hybrid vehicle is being<br>
propelled by the electric motor(s). Consequently, the ICE in hybrid vehicles may be<br>
subjected to startup and shutdown operation more frequently than engines used in non-<br>
hybrid powertrains. Much like its traditional counterpart, the hybrid ICE may generate<br>
compression pulses during starts and stops that can produce undesirable vibration in<br>
hybrid vehicles.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]	In order to reduce driveline vibrations in a vehicle powertrain, and<br>
improve torque converter balancing, the present invention provides a spring-mass<br>
damper system assembly providing step-rate dampening effect. According to one<br>
aspect of the present invention, a spring retainer is provided for use in a vehicle<br>
powertrain damper assembly that has one or more inner springs each defining a first<br>
inner diameter, and one or more outer springs each defining a second inner diameter,<br>
the second diameter being greater than the first diameter. The spring retainer includes<br>
a base portion and first and second pilot portions. The base portion defines a first<br>
interface surface that is configured to engage with a respective outer spring. The first<br>
pilot portion extends from the first interface surface and also defines a second interface<br>
surface that is configured to engage with a respective inner spring. The second pilot<br>
portion extends from the second interface surface, and is configured to secure, attach,<br><br>
or adhere, preferably by means of a press fit, to the inner spring and thereby restrict<br>
relative movement therebetween. It is preferred that the first and second pilot portions<br>
extend substantially perpendicularly from their respective interface surfaces.<br>
[0007]	Ideally, the base portion and first and second pilot portions are all<br>
substantially cylindrical segments. In this instance, it is also preferred that the first<br>
pilot portion further defines a third diameter that is greater than the first inner diameter<br>
of the inner spring and less than the second inner diameter of the outer spring.<br>
Similarly, it is also preferred that the second pilot portion defines a fourth diameter that<br>
is greater than the first inner diameter of the inner spring and less than the third<br>
diameter of the first pilot portion. Alternatively, the base portion and first and second<br>
pilot portions may take on other various geometries. For example, the second pilot<br>
portion may take on any geometric configuration inscribable within the first inner<br>
diameter of the inner spring to secure, attach, or adhere the second pilot portion to the<br>
inner spring and thereby restrict relative movement therebetween.<br>
[0008]	According to another aspect of the present invention, a torsional damper<br>
assembly is provided for absorbing and attenuating torsionals and vibrations transmitted<br>
to a power transmission. The torsional damper assembly includes a damper flange<br>
having an outer periphery with one or more spring-mass damper systems opetatively<br>
attached thereto and elongated circumferentially about the outer periphery of the<br>
damper flange. At least one, but preferably all of the spring-mass damper systems<br>
include an inner spring defining first inner and outer diameters, and an outer spring<br>
defining second inner and outer diameters. The second inner diameter is sufficiently<br>
larger than the first outer diameter so as to allow the inner spring to be nestably<br>
positioned inside of the outer spring.   Preferably, the inner spring also defines a first<br>
length that is shorter than a second length defined by the outer spring.<br>
[0009]	The spring-mass damper system also includes first and second spring<br>
retainers. The first spring retainer has a first base portion defining a first interface<br>
surface with a first pilot portion preferably extending substantially perpendicularly<br>
therefrom. The first pilot portion defines a second interface surface with a second pilot<br>
portion preferably extending substantially perpendicularly therefrom. The second<br><br>
spring retainer has a second base portion defining a third interface surface configured<br>
with a third pilot portion preferably extending substantially perpendicularly therefrom,<br>
the third pilot portion defining a fourth interface surface. The first and third interface<br>
surfaces are configured to engage with a respective outer spring, while the second and<br>
fourth interface surfaces are configured to engage with a respective inner spring.<br>
Additionally, the first and third pilot portions are configured to engage with and thereby<br>
restrict axial and radial movement of the outer spring. Finally, the second pilot portion<br>
is configured to secure, attach, or adhere, preferably by means of a press fit, to the<br>
inner spring and thereby restrict relative movement therebetween.<br>
[0010]	According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a transmission<br>
is provided in power flow communication with a torque converter assembly to drivingly<br>
connect a final drive system to an internal combustion engine. The engine is<br>
characterized by compression pulses generated during startup and/or shutdown<br>
operations, and torsionals generated during other modes of engine operation. The<br>
transmission comprises a damper flange having a plurality of spring-mass damper<br>
systems operatively attached thereto and elongated circumferentially about its outer<br>
periphery. At least one, but preferably all of the spring-mass damper systems include<br>
an inner spring defining a first length and first inner and outer diameters, and an outer<br>
spring defining a second length and second inner and outer diameters. The second<br>
inner diameter is sufficiently larger than the first outer diameter so as to allow the inner<br>
spring to be nestably positioned inside the outer spring.<br>
[0011]	Each spring-mass damper system of the power transmission also includes<br>
first and second spring retainers. The first spring retainer has a first base portion<br>
defining a first interface surface with a substantially cylindrical first pilot portion that<br>
extends substantially perpendicularly therefrom. The first pilot portion defines a<br>
second interface surface having a substantially cylindrical second pilot portion that<br>
extends substantially perpendicularly therefrom. The second spring retainer has a<br>
second base portion that defines a third interface surface with a substantially cylindrical<br>
third pilot portion extending substantially perpendicularly therefrom and defining a<br>
fourth interface surface. The first and third pilot portions are configured to engage with<br><br>
and thereby restrict axial and radial movement of a respective outer spring. Finally,<br>
the inner spring is press fit onto the second pilot portion of the first spring retainer to<br>
thereby restrict any relative motion therebetween.<br>
[0012]	The above features and advantages, and other features and advantages of<br>
the present invention will be readily apparent from the following detailed description of<br>
the preferred embodiments and best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in<br>
connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0018]	The present invention is described herein in the context of a hybrid<br>
powertrain having a power transmission. Notably, the hybrid power transmission<br>
shown in Figs. 1 and 2 hereof has been greatly simplified, it being understood that<br>
further information regarding the standard operation of a hybrid power transmission<br>
and so on may be found in the prior art. Furthermore, it should be readily understood<br><br>
that Figs. 1 and 2 merely offer a representative application by which the present<br>
invention may be incorporated, the present invention by no means being limited to the<br>
particular powertrain or transmission configuration of Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
[0019]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers refer to the<br>
same or similar components throughout the several views, there is shown in Fig. 1 a<br>
schematic side view of an exemplary vehicle powertrain system, identified generally as<br>
10, having a restartable engine 14 drivingly connected to a final drive system 16 by a<br>
hybrid power transmission 12. The engine 14 transfers power, preferably by way of<br>
torque, via the engine crankshaft 15 to the transmission 12. The transmission 12 is<br>
adapted to manipulate and distribute power from the engine 14 to the final drive system<br>
16, represented herein by differential 17 and wheels 19, thereby configured to propel the<br>
hybrid vehicle (not shown). In the embodiment depicted in Fig. 1, the engine 14 may be<br>
any engine, such as a 2-stroke diesel or a 4-stroke gasoline engine, which is readily<br>
adapted to provide its available power output typically at a number of revolutions per<br>
minute (RPM). Although not illustrated in Fig. 1, it should be appreciated that the final<br>
drive system 16 may comprise any known configuration, e.g., front wheel drive (FWD),<br>
rear wheel drive (RWD), four-wheel drive (4WD), or all-wheel drive (AWD).<br>
[0020]	Fig. 1 also displays selected components of the transmission 12, including<br>
a main housing 11 configured to encase first and second electric motor/generator<br>
assemblies A and B, respectively. The first and second motor/generators A, B are<br>
indirectly journaled onto a main shaft 21 of the transmission 12, preferably through a<br>
series of planetary gear sets (not shown). The motor/generators A, B operate with one or<br>
more selectively engageable torque transmitting mechanisms (e.g., clutch, brake, etc., not<br>
shown herein) to rotate the transmission output shaft 20. An oil pan or sump volume 27<br>
is located on the base of the main housing 11, and is configured to provide hydraulic<br>
fluid, such as transmission oil (shown hidden in Fig. 1 at 31) for the transmission 12 and<br>
its components. The main housing 11 covers the inner most components of the<br>
transmission 12, such as the motor/generators A, B, planetary gear arrangements, main<br>
shaft 21, and torque transmitting devices (all of which are mentioned for exemplary<br>
purposes and not all are shown). Additionally, an auxiliary pump 29 is mounted to the<br>
base of the input housing 11, and secured nestably adjacent the oil pan 27. Finally, an<br><br>
exemplary hydrodynamic torque converter assembly, identified generally as 18 is<br>
adapted to be operatively positioned between the engine 14 and transmission 12<br>
[0021]	Fig. 2 is a cross-sectional side-view of a portion of the exemplary torque<br>
converter assembly 18. The torque converter assembly 18 includes a torque converter<br>
pump or impeller 22, a bladed turbine 24, a stator 26, and a lockup or bypass clutch,<br>
identified generally at 50. The torque converter assembly 18 also includes an annular<br>
housing, defined principally by a pump shell portion 28 fixedly attached, e.g., via<br>
electron beam welding, mig welding, laser welding, and the like, to an engine-side, front<br>
cover 30 such that a working hydraulic fluid chamber is formed therebetween. A<br>
fiexplate 32 is adapted to connect to one or more lugs 35 projecting from the front cover<br>
30,	e.g., via a plurality of apertures 59 formed therethrough that are configured to<br>
receive bolts 34, and thereby drivingly connect the annular housing front cover 30 to the<br>
engine 14 such that engine torque is transferable therebetween.<br>
[0022]	The impeller 22 is situated in serial power flow, fluid communication with<br>
the turbine 24. The stator 26 is interposed between the impeller 22 and turbine 24 so that<br>
it can alter fluid flow returning from the turbine 24 to the impeller 22. The transfer of<br>
engine torque from the crankshaft 15 to the turbine 24 via the annular housing front cover<br>
30 and impeller 22 is through the operation of hydraulic fluid, such as transmission oil<br>
31.	More specifically, rotation of the impeller blades 23, retained between the pump<br>
shell 28 and inner shroud 33, causes the hydraulic fluid 31 to be directed toroidally<br>
outward toward the turbine 24. When this occurs with sufficient force to overcome the<br>
resistance to rotation, the turbine blades 25, coaxially oriented with the impeller blades<br>
23	and retained between the inner shroud 33 and turbine shell 45, begin to rotate with the<br>
impeller 22. The fluid flow exiting the turbine 24 is directed back into the impeller 22 by<br>
way of the stator 26. The stator 26, located between the flow exit section of the turbine<br>
24	and the flow entrance section of the impeller 22, redirects the fluid flow from the<br>
turbine 24 to the impeller 22 in the same direction as impeller rotation, thereby reducing<br>
pump torque and causing torque multiplication.<br>
[0023]	The torque converter assembly 18 preferably includes first and second<br>
thrust bearings 92, 94, respectively, configured to rotatably support the stator 26. The<br><br>
stator 26 is connected to a stator shaft 96 by way of a one-way roller clutch 98 that is<br>
operable to prevent rotation of the stator 26 at low torque converter speeds. At higher<br>
torque converter speeds, the direction of hydraulic fluid 31 leaving the turbine 24<br>
changes, causing the stator 26 to over-run the one-way clutch 98 and rotate freely on<br>
the stator shaft 96. The impeller 22 is secured to the pump hub 56, whereas the turbine<br>
22 is secured to the output shaft 20. Ideally, a turbine hub 49 is disposed between, and<br>
configured to operatively couple the turbine 24 and the output shaft 20. The turbine<br>
hub 49 is secured to the turbine 24 by, for example, a plurality of rivets 47, and<br>
engages the output shaft 20 via a splined interface 51.<br>
[0024]	Fundamentally, as the internal combustion engine 14 operates at different<br>
rotational speeds it may produce torsionals (e.g., vibrations). By way of example, when<br>
fuel is being fed to the engine 14 and it is under power, e.g., through engagement of<br>
the fuel throttle (not shown herein) during normal operation, the engine 14 may<br>
produce torsionals that are undesirable to transmit to, and through the transmission 12.<br>
In addition, when the engine 14 is not being fueled or is not under power (as in a<br>
startup and/or a shutdown operation) the engine pistons (not shown) may generate<br>
compression pulses. Both the torsionals and compression pulses can produce resultant<br>
vibrations and noise that may be sensed the vehicle operator.<br>
[0025]	To cancel out the torsionals and compression pulses that may be produced<br>
by the engine 14, the transmission 12 is equipped with a torsional damper assembly 40,<br>
as shown in Fig. 2. As will be described in extensive detail below, the torsional damper<br>
assembly 40 generally functions to isolate the transmission 12 from unwanted torsionals<br>
generated by the engine 14 during operation and also to selectively aide the first and<br>
second motor/generator assemblies A, B in canceling engine compression pulses during<br>
startup and shutdown operations.<br>
[0026]	The torsional damper assembly 40 includes an annular damper flange 42,<br>
having one or more spring-mass damper systems, identified generally as 44 and<br>
referred to hereinafter as "SDS 44", oriented circumferentially along and proximate to<br>
its outer periphery. The damper flange 42 is attached, secured, or extended from a<br>
clutch plate 52 (e.g., by means of a rivet 41.) The engine side front cover 30 is affixed, as<br><br>
described above, to the engine crankshaft 15 by way of the interconnection between the<br>
flexplate 32 to a crankshaft pilot 61. In addition to operating to transmit torque produced<br>
by the engine 14 to the transmission 12, the flexplate 32 also functions to absorb any<br>
thrust loads that may be generated by the torque converter 18 hydrodynamics and/or<br>
through operation of the lockup clutch 50.<br>
[0027]	The lockup clutch 50, located inside the vessel 48, consists of the clutch<br>
plate 52 which is operable to selectively frictionally engage a friction surface or friction<br>
material 35 with an inner contact surface 37 of the front cover 30. The clutch plate 52 is<br>
sL1dably supported on the turbine hub 49 at an annular clutch hub portion 39. The clutch<br>
plate 52 preferably moves in response to hydrauL1c fluid, i.e., transmission oil 31, fed into<br>
cavity 58 from an oil source, such as sump volume 27. When the lockup clutch 50 is<br>
fully engaged (i.e., when there is no sL1p between the friction material 36 and surface 37<br>
of the front cover 30) the impeller 22 is frictionally coupled to the turbine 24 such that<br>
the two components rotate as a single unit, allowing the engine 14 to circumvent the<br>
torque converter assembly 18 and transmit power directly to the transmission 12 without<br>
any efficiency losses associated with operation of the hydrauL1c fluid 31.<br>
[0028]	Referring to both Figs. 3 and 4, the torsional damper assembly 40 includes<br>
a series of spring pockets 68 circumferentially located around the annular damper flange<br>
42, contoured to operatively retain the pluraL1ty of SDS 44. In this regard, each SDS 44<br>
includes a series of arcuate damper springs, such as inner and outer spring members 60<br>
and 62, respectively, elongated circumferentially about the outer periphery of the annular<br>
damper flange 42 and spaced angularly about axis A between the front covers 30 and<br>
drive tang 46 of Fig. 2. Similarly oriented along the outer periphery of the annular<br>
damper flange 42, between the individual SDS 44, is a pluraL1ty of seat portions 66<br>
adapted to receive the first and second spring retainers 70 and 72.<br>
[0029]	Looking to Fig. 4, an exploded perspective view of one of the SDS 44 from<br>
Figs. 2 and 3 is provided illustrating how the first and second spring retainers 70, 72 engage<br>
with the inner and outer spring members 60,62. The inner spring member 60 is of a first<br>
length L1, whereas the outer spring member 62 is of a second length L2 which is greater<br>
than the first length L1. In a similar regard, the inner spring member 60 defines a first<br>
inner diameter d1 and first outer diameter d1 The outer spring member 62 defines a<br><br>
second inner diameter d2 and second outer diameter D2. The second inner diameter d2 is<br>
sufficiently larger than the first outer diameter d1 to A1low the inner spring 60 to nest inside<br>
the outer spring 62, as will be described in greater detail hereinbelow. FinA1ly, the inner<br>
spring 60 is preferably stiffer (has a higher spring coefficient) than the outer spring 62.<br>
[0030]	The first spring retainer 70 includes a first base portion 74 having a first<br>
interface surface 75 with a first pilot portion 76 extending substantiA1ly perpendicular<br>
therefrom to define a third diameter D3. The first pilot portion 76 in turn has a second<br>
interface surface 77 with a second pilot portion 78 extending substantiA1ly perpendicular<br>
therefrom to define a fourth diameter D4. Similar to the first spring retainer 70, the<br>
second spring retainer 72 includes a second base portion 84 having a third interface<br>
surface 85 with a third pilot portion 86 extending substantiA1ly perpendicular therefrom<br>
to thereby define a fourth interface surface 87 and a fifth diameter D5. A1though<br>
depicted in Fig. 4 as generA1ly circular or cyL1ndricA1, the first and second spring<br>
retainers 60, 62, and their individuA1 constituents (i.e., first, second, and third pilot<br>
portions 76, 78, 86) may take on other functionA1 geometries without departing from<br>
the scope of the present invention. For example, the second pilot portion 78 of the first<br>
spring retainer 70 may take on any geometric configuration inscribable within the first<br>
inner diameter d1 of the inner spring 60 to secure, attach, or adhere the second pilot<br>
portion 78 to the inner spring 60 and thereby restrict relative movement therebetween.<br>
[0031]	According to the preferred embodiment depicted in Figs. 4 and 4A, the<br>
third diameter D3 of the first pilot portion 76 of the first spring retainer 70 is sufficiently<br>
larger than the first outer diameter d1 of the inner spring 60, whereas the fourth diameter<br>
D4 of the second pilot portion 78 of the first spring retainer 70 is sL1ghtly larger than the<br>
first inner diameter d1 of the inner spring 60. In this regard, the inner spring 60 is<br>
preferably coaxiA1 ly pressed, forced, or urged relative to the first spring retainer 70<br>
(illustrated in Fig. 4 by arrow A1) so as to press fit the inner spring 60 onto the second<br>
pilot portion 78 and operatively abut a first end 65 of the inner spring 60 against the<br>
second interface surface 77 of the first spring retainer 70, as best seen in Fig. 4A. The<br>
inner spring 60 is A1so fed or translated coaxiA1ly with respect to the outer spring 62<br>
(illustrated in Fig. 4 by arrow A2) so as to press or abut a first end 69 of the outer spring<br><br>
62 against the first interface surface 75 of the first spring retainer 70, and thereby nest<br>
the inner spring 60 inside the outer spring 62. FinA1ly, the fifth diameter D5 of the third<br>
pilot portion 86 is preferably smA1ler than the second inner diameter d2 of the outer<br>
spring 62. To this regard, the outer spring 62 is preferably fed or translated axiA1ly<br>
relative to the third pilot portion 86 (illustrated in Fig. 4 by arrow A3) so as to abut or<br>
press a second end 71 of the outer spring 62 against the third interface surface 85 of the<br>
second spring retainer 72. According to the arrangement described above, the second<br>
end 67 of the inner spring 60 is distal to (i.e., does not contact) the second spring<br>
retainer 62 when the SMS 44 is in an inactive state, as can be seen best in Fig. 4A.<br>
[0032]	IdeA1ly, the third and fifth diameters D3, D5 of the first and second<br>
spring retainers 70, 72, respectively, are equivA1ent to each other, and sL1ghtly less than<br>
the second outer diameter D2 of the outer spring 62. However, it is within the scope of<br>
the claimed invention that the third and fifth diameters D3, D5 be equA1 to or sL1ghtly<br>
greater than the second diameter D2 of the outer spring 62 (e.g., for press-fitting<br>
purposes), and need not be commensurate to one anther. In a similar respect, the<br>
fourth diameter D4 of the second pilot portion 78 may be less than the first inner<br>
diameter d1 of the inner spring 60, the inner spring 60 and first spring retainer 70 being<br>
joined by A1ternate methods (e.g., welding, riveting, adhesive, etc.)<br>
[0033]	Referring to both Figs. 2 and 3, the front cover 30 operates in conjunction<br>
with an annular driven plate extension 46, A1so referred to herein as a drive tang, to<br>
encase the torsionA1 damper assembly 40 and lockup clutch 50 therebetween. The drive<br>
tang 46 is attached or joined at a base portion 53, preferably by way of rivet 47, to the<br>
turbine shell 45, and functions to mechanicA1ly engage with, and thereby actuate the<br>
individuA1 SMS 44. The drive tang 46 A1so includes a plurA11ty of individuA1 flange<br>
portions, shown hidden in Fig. 2 as 55, each extending axiA1ly into a respective seat<br>
portion 66, Fig. 3, of the damper flange 42. As the lockup clutch 50 is engaged (i.e., the<br>
friction materiA1 35 on clutch plate 52 is urged against the contact surface 27 of front<br>
cover 30 through operation of the hydrauL1c fluid 31) and begins to transmit toque (i.e.,<br>
gain torque capacity independent of the turbine 24), the torsionA1 damper assembly 40 is<br>
rotated about axis A. As a result of this rotationA1 motion, one of the spring retainers 70,<br><br>
72 of each SMS 44 is pressed against a respective flange portion 55 of the drive tang 46,<br>
thereby compressing the inner and outer springs 60, 62, as described hereinbelow.<br>
[0034]	The inner and outer damper springs 60, 62 absorb and dampen the<br>
unwanted torsionA1s produced by the engine 14 during normA1, startup, and shutdown<br>
operations according to a progressive two phase or step-rate process - first, axiA1<br>
displacement of the damper flange 42 relative to the center axis of rotation A, causes<br>
unaccompanied compression of the outer spring 62 a distance between L1 and L2, and<br>
consequentiA1 absorption and attenuation of the aforementioned engine torsionA1s and<br>
vibrations by the outer spring 62 only. Once the outer spring 62 is compressed to a point<br>
where the fourth interface surface 87 of the second spring retainer 72 is proximate to and<br>
mechanicA1ly interfacing with the second end 67 of the inner spring 60, the inner and<br>
outer springs 60,62 compressive collaboratively to absorb and attenuate engine torsionA1s<br>
and vibrations.<br>
[0035]	During conventionA1 manufacturing of a torque converter assembly, such<br>
as torque converter 18, it is often necessary to rotatably bA1ance the internA1<br>
components of the torque converter, e.g., the impeller 22, turbine 24, stator 26,<br>
damper assembly 40, and lockup clutch 50, to provide for the smooth and efficient<br>
transmission of power A1ong the powertrain 10. According to current practices, the<br>
individuA1 components of the torque converter 18 are set in a bA1ancing machine which<br>
rotates the assembly and measures any rotationA1 eccentricity (e.g., asymmetric rotation<br>
of the torque converter 18 about center axis A) under normA1 operating conditions of<br>
the torque converter. Thereafter, the entire torque converter assembly 18 is fully<br>
assembled and bA1anced a second time (i.e., the rotationA1 eccentricity of the entire<br>
apparatus is measured for corrective purposes.) Correction of any "unbA1ance" may be<br>
accompL1shed by fixing (e.g., welding) a bA1ance weight to a portion of the torque<br>
converter housing (e.g., shell portion 28 or front cover 30 of Fig. 2) based upon the<br>
result of the measurement to offset the eccentricity. HistoricA1ly, torque converter<br>
clutches designed with "loose" or "floating" springs, which provide a step-rate<br>
dampening effect, may be difficult to bA1ance due to the indeterminate center of mass.<br>
The addition of the second pilot feature 78 to the first spring retainer 70, which is<br><br>
geometricA1ly adapted to interlock, mate with, or press into the first end 65 of die inner<br>
spring 60, prevents unintentionA1 movement of the inner spring 60 within die torque<br>
converter 18 during bA1ancing and normA1 operation of me torque converter clutch 50<br>
without degrading the functionA11ty and operationA1 L1fe expectancy of the torque<br>
converter assembly 18.<br>
[0036]	While the best modes for carrying out the present invention have been<br>
