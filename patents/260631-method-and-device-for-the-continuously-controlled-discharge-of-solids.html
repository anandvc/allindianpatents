				<td>It is known that poorly-flowing solid materials can lead to an inhomogeneous mass flow of the solid across the discharge cross-section of a silo.If the solid in the silo is also heated or cooled the uneven mass flow can lead for example,to local variations in temperature and/or hence to varying product properties.According to the invention,the above problem may be resolved,whereby a method and a discharge device for a solids silo and a solids silo are disclosed,permitting a controllable solids discharge evenly across the cross-section of the silo. The cross-section of the silo discharge is divided into several,preferably equivalent,partial cross-sections to which a continuously controllable discharge device is connected.The solid flow discharged from the controllable discharge devices can be collected on a continuous conveyor arranged therebelow and removed.The even solid mass discharge from the continuous discharge devices is controlled,depending on measured signals from several equivalent sensors,recording the local mass flow in the corresponding partial sections of the silo,by means of the conveyor power of the discharge device,relating to each sensor.Where electrically-conducting solids are used which are to be heated in the silo using electrodes by means of resistance heating,the control of the discharge devices is achieved with the measured current at the electrodes.</td>

Method and apparatus for the continuous controlled discharge of solids Description<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention concerns a method of discharging a solid from a silo with a polygonal or round discharge cross-section, wherein the solid flows continuously through the silo.<br>
The invention further concerns a discharge apparatus for a solids silo having a polygonal or round discharge cross-section, as well as a solids silo, wherein the silo is designed for a solid to flow therethrough.<br>
State of the art<br>
In regard to the metered withdrawal from silos with a rectangular or square discharge opening, it is known that, when using a screw conveyor in which the screw is of a constant core and outside diameter and has a constant screw pitch, the bulk material is withdrawn only at the rearward end of the silo while a dead zone is formed in the forward region of the silo. By virtue of adaptation of the screw geometry, for example by a reduction in the core diameter in the conveyor direction and an increase in the outside diameter or the screw pitch, the screw can pick up bulk material along the entire discharge cross-section, SCHULZE, Dietmar. Grundlagen und Moglichkeiten der Schuttguttechnik. Schuttgut - Informationen fur die Schuttgutindustrie (Agrichema GmbH).<br>
DE 3717748 (ZIPPE GMBH U. CO, 6980 WERTHEIM) 26.05.1987 discloses a plate heat exchanger for preheating bulk materials, in which the problem of an irregular withdrawal of solid material at the lower end of the heat exchanger is avoided by symmetrically arranged outlet shafts with flange-mounted, non-controllable shaker conveyors of equal conveyor output.<br><br>
2<br>
In the case of bulk materials which flow very poorly, those known measures nonetheless frequently still result in a non-homogeneous mass flow of the solid material over the cross-section of the apparatus. If the solid material in the silo is at the same time heated or cooled or if a reaction takes place during the flow of solid material therethrough, then the unequal mass flow can result for example in locally different temperatures and thus different product properties.<br>
DE 3214472 (EIRICH, HUBERT ET AL) 20.04.1982 discloses a controllable discharge apparatus for an apparatus for heating electrically conductive bulk materials, in which the discharge speed and the electrical heating power are matched to each other in order to achieve a temperature which is as constant as possible in the discharged product.<br>
In apparatuses for heating electrically conductive bulk materials by means of resistance heating by way of oppositely disposed electrodes, the power input at the electrodes is dependent on the resistance of the bulk material disposed therebetween. As the current which is passed through the bulk material has a tendency to flow along the path of least resistance, when dealing with an irregular mass flow across the cross-section of the silo-form apparatus, that results in temperature differences between regions which are flowing more quickly and more slowly. Particularly in a situation involving changing flow properties in respect of the intake substances, due for example to changing intake temperature, material moisture content or particle size distribution, there is hitherto no possible way of influencing the locally different discharge speed, which arises as a result thereof, from the solids silo.<br>
Disclosure of the invention<br>
The problem of the present invention is to provide a method and a discharge apparatus for a solids silo as well as a solids silo which can be equipped with such a discharge apparatus, which permit a controllable solids discharge which is regular over the cross-section of the silo, and thus permit the production of bulk materials which are treated physically or chemically when flowing through the silo, being in particular heated or<br><br>
3<br>
cooled, with properties which are as homogeneous as possible, in particular with slight temperature differences. In addition in its preferred configuration the invention permits automatic adaptation to changing flow properties in respect of the intake substances used.<br>
That problem is solved by the subjects of claims 1, 14 and 27.<br>
The silo discharge according to the invention divides the withdrawal cross-section or discharge cross-section into a plurality of preferably mutually equal partial cross-sections, to each of which a respective continuous controllable discharge member is flange-mounted. The solids flow issuing from the controllable discharge members can be collected together for example by means of a continuous conveyor device disposed therebeneath and removed.<br>
The uniform discharge of solid material at the continuously operating discharge members is in that case controlled in dependence on measurement signals from a plurality of similar sensors which detect the locally prevailing mass flow or another measurement parameter in the corresponding partial portions of the silo, by way of the conveyor delivery of the discharge member associated with the respective sensor.<br>
To detect the local mass flow, for example the electrical power input at an electrically heated sensor can be used to maintain a preset temperature at the sensor tip, GERL, Stefan et al, Sensor auf Transistorbasis zur In-line-Restfeuchtemessung in ruhenden Haufwerken, Technisches Messen. 1997, Vol 64, No 7/8, pages 268-275, or, in the case of electrically conductive bulk materials, the current strength at oppositely disposed electrodes.<br>
The local energy input of heat exchangers through which fluid or vapour flows can also be detected and utilised as a signal for the local mass flow.<br>
Furthermore the solids mass flow can be ascertained directly in each discharge member associated with a partial portion of the silo by means of weighing in respect of each discharge member in conjunction with the respective discharge speed of the discharge member.<br><br>
4<br>
In addition, in the case of silos through which the material flows continuously, the mass flow is adapted to the feed mass flow of the feed member, by way of the rotary speed of the discharge members, in such a way that the filling level within the silo remains constant during the flow therethrough.<br>
The uniform controllable removal of material permits for example uniform heating/cooling of the product over the entire cross-section of the silo without locally different product temperatures. At the same time the capacity of the heat transfer arrangement can also be fully utilised.<br>
As an alternative thereto control of the discharge speeds of the individual discharge members can be effected by way of measurement of the temperature of the solid. With a uniform heating power in all regions of the silo the solid is heated more greatly in those regions in which it remains for longer. In the case of heating power which is irregularly distributed over the cross-section, some regions are heated more greatly and other regions less greatly, at the same height. If now the temperature in the silo or in the region of the discharge members is measured the conveyor speeds of the discharge members can be so adapted that the solid material from all regions is at the same temperature upon being removed from the silo. In other words, the discharge speed is slowed down in a region if the temperature of the solid as measured there is below a predeterminable first reference value and speeded up if the temperature of the solid as measured there is above a second reference value. That overall ensures a uniform discharge temperature for the solid, which is between the first and second reference values (which can also be the same) in all partial cross-sections of the discharge cross-section. In that respect it is possible to use various control procedures which are known in the state of the art such as for example PID control.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
The invention is diagrammatically illustrated by way of example in the drawings in which:<br><br>

Figure 10 is a diagrammatic side view of a weighed-out, negatively conical silo through which solids continuously flow, with a signal evaluation and control unit and controllable progressive screw carriages.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rectangular silo 1 with a solids fill 2, the silo 1 being divided in the bottom region into four uniform portions 3, 4, 5 and 6.<br><br>
6<br>
Each of the portions 3, 4, 5 and 6 has its own continuous controllable discharge device or member 7, 8, 9 and 10, for example a discharge screw, which can continuously remove the solid material 2 from the respective portion. Arranged above each portion 3, 4, 5 and 6 is at least one respective mass flow sensor 11, 12, 13 and 14 associated with the respective portion. Each of the similar sensors 11, 12, 13 and 14 detects the local flow of the solid material fill 2 in the portion in which the measurement field of each sensor is disposed. The signals lla, 12a, 13a and 14a from the respective sensors 11, 12, 13 and 14 are passed to a signal evaluation and control unit 15. The signal evaluation and control unit 15 produces setting signals 7a, 8a, 9a and 10a for the controllable discharge devices 7, 8, 9 and 10 in such a way that the signals which occur at the sensors lla, 12a, 13a and 14a and which are proportional to the solid mass flow are of the same magnitude and thus the solid mass flow in each portion is equal.<br>
Figure 2 shows a plan view of the discharge bottom of a silo according to the invention along section X-X' in Figure 1. Over the discharge cross-section of the silo 16 two respective screws 17, 18 are arranged in mutually juxtaposed relationship and two respective screws 17, 19 and 18, 20 are arranged in mutually superposed relationship. The screws can be provided for example with a progressive pitch. In the discharge region 21 into which all screw outlets open, the solid which is withdrawn from the silo drops in the direction of the force of gravity into downstream-disposed installation portions (not shown). To provide for stepless adjustability of the discharge speed of each screw, it is provided with a motor 22 with a frequency converter 23 or an adjusting transmission (not shown). The discharge speed in each portion or partial cross-section of the discharge bottom 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the silo can thus be individually set.<br>
Figure 3 shows a silo 1 with the discharge bottom according to the invention, solids 2 flowing continuously through the silo.<br>
The silo 1 is charged at the upper end with solids 25 which are pourable, by way of a metering member 24, for example a variable-speed conveyor belt, and the solid is continuously drawn off in the bottom region.<br><br>
7<br>
In order to be able to maintain a defined degree of filling within the silo and to prevent overfilling, the degree of filling is detected for example by way of a weighing device by means of weighing cells 26.<br>
The measurement signals of the sensors 11 and 13 which are of the same design configuration and which detect the solid mass flow in each portion 3, 5 of the withdrawal region of the silo are detected by means of a signal evaluation and control unit 15, and the filling level within the silo is detected by way of the weighing cells 26. The signal evaluation and control unit 15 controls the speed of the discharge members 18, 20 on the basis of the input signals lla, 13a and 26a, by way of the controllable drive units 18a, 20a, in such a way that the filling level within the silo remains constant and all solid mass flow sensors 11, 13 register the same level in respect of the measurement signal lla, 13a.<br>
In a further variant a plurality of discharge members, for example 17+18 and 19+20 or 18+20 and 17+19 can be combined together in terms of control procedures.<br>
In addition, instead of the filling level within the silo, the solids flow 25 which is supplied by way of the metering member 24 and which is determined by measuring procedures can be utilised for controlling the discharge speed of the discharge members 18, 20.<br>
Best embodiment of the invention<br>
Figure 4 shows a rectangular silo 1 with a solids fill 2, which is divided in the bottom region into portions 3, 4, 5 and 6. Each of the portions 3, 4, 5 and 6 has a continuous controllable discharge device 7, 8, 9 and 10, for example a discharge screw, which can continuously withdraw the solid 2 from the respective portion. The entire silo 1 is supported on weighing cells 26 in order to ensure a constant degree of filling. Alternatively it is also possible to use filling level sensors 31 (Figure 5).<br>
In a particularly advantageous configuration of the invention, arranged within the silo 1 in the upper region are one or more, preferably identical electrodes 27 (+pole), over the entire silo cross-section, while arranged in the lower region are one or more, preferably identical<br><br>
8<br>
electrodes 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d (-pole), above each withdrawal cross-section 3, 4, 5 and 6. The reverse polarity of the electrodes 27 and 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d is equally possible. A current 29 flows between the electrodes and the electrically conductive solids fill 22, the strength of the current 29 being dependent on the resistance and thus the temperature of the solid disposed therebetween. The current strength 27' measured in the input power is divided to the corresponding number of electrodes 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d in the withdrawal region, wherein the measured current strengths 28a', 28b', 28c1 and 28d' of each electrode 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d varies in dependence on the resistance of the solid material in each withdrawal portion 3, 4, 5 , 6.<br>
The measured current strengths 28a', 28b', 28c' and 28d' of the respective electrodes 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d are passed to a signal evaluation and control unit 15. The current strength 27' at the upper electrode 27 as well as the weight of the silo from the weighing cells 26 together with the measured temperature of the solid material 30 at the discharge region 21 are also fed into the signal evaluation and control unit 15. The signal evaluation and control unit 15 produces setting signals 7a, 8a, 9a and 10a for the controllable discharge devices 7, 8, 9 and 10 in such a way that the current strength 28a', 28b', 28c' and 28d' at the electrodes 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d are of equal magnitude and thus the solid mass flow in each portion is of the same magnitude and in addition the filling level within the silo 1 remains the same.<br>
In addition the signal evaluation and control unit 15 detects the temperature 30 of all the discharged solid and controls the inputted power at the electrodes 27, 28a, 28b, 28c and 28d in such a way that the desired final temperature of the product is achieved at the discharge.<br>
When using a plurality of electrodes within a withdrawal portion the measured current strengths are suitably combined together to form an evaluatable measurement signal.<br><br>
9 Embodiments of the invention<br>
Figure 5 shows a variant of Figure 4 and Figure 1, in which heating or cooling of the solid within the silo 1 is effected by way of example by way of heat exchanger elements 32 through which pass vapour, thermal oil or cooling fluid and which in a further variant could also be electrically heated. The solid mass flow in each portion 3, 4, 5 and 6 is detected as shown in Figure 1 by way of a plurality of mass flow sensors 11, 12, 13, 14 and the signals lla, 12a, 13a and 14a are fed to a signal evaluation and control unit 15 which generates therefrom corresponding setting signals for the discharge devices 7, 8, 9 and 10 as set forth in the description relating to Figure 1. The power input 33 at the heating or cooling elements 32 within the silo, controllable for example by way of the through-flow of the heating or cooling medium, is effected in dependence on the measured final temperature 30 at the discharge of the withdrawal screws.<br>
Figure 6 shows a further variant of Figure 5, in which the heat exchanger elements 32a, 32b, 32c and 32d through which a heating or cooling medium flows are used at the same time as mass flow sensors insofar as a heat exchanger element 32a, 32b, 32c and 32d, through each of which a respective heating or cooling medium flows, is allocated to each withdrawal portion 3, 4, 5 and 6. Setting signals for the discharge devices 7, 8, 9 and 10 can be produced, in accordance with the description relating to Figure 1, by way of the cooling medium mass or volume flow 36a, 36b, 36c and 36d which is detected individually for each portion, and the energy input which is ascertained by way of the respective temperature difference between the intake 34a, 34b, 34c and 34d and the outlet 35a, 35b, 35c and 35d, by the signal evaluation and control unit 15.<br>
Figure 7 shows a variant of Figure 3, in which the discharge of the solid in the partial portions 37, 38 and 39 is effected by way of a plurality of controllable cell wheel lock devices which deliver the discharged solid on to a continuously operating conveyor device 40 which is disposed therebeneath and which combines the individual solid mass flows together and conveys them to a predefined delivery point 41. Control of the discharge speed of the cell wheel lock devices is effected in a similar<br><br>
10<br>
manner to the foregoing description by way of the mass flow sensors (not shown).<br>
Figure 8 shows a further variant of Figure 3 in which discharge is effected by way of screws 42, 43 which deliver the solid which has been withdrawn from the partial portions 3 and 5, by way of oppositely disposed discharge openings 44 and 45, on to a continuously operating conveyor device 46 which is disposed therebeneath and which combines the individual solid mass flows together and delivers them at a predefined point. In this case also control of the discharge speed of the screws 42, 43 is effected by way of the mass flow sensors (not shown) similarly to the foregoing description.<br>
Figure 9 shows a further variant of Figure 8, in which a plurality of withdrawal screws 47, 49 convey the solid which has been withdrawn from the partial portions 3 and 5 respectively towards the middle of the silo 1 and the total solid flow is combined together by an orthogonally arranged continuous conveyor device 48 and transported away to a predefined point.<br>
Figure 10 shows a variant of Figure 3 with a negatively conical silo 1 through which solids 2 continuously flow. The silo 1 is charged with pourable solids 25 at the upper end by way of a metering member 24, for example a variable-speed conveyor belt, and the solid is continuously withdrawn in the bottom region. In order to be able to maintain a defined degree of filling within the silo and to prevent overfilling, the degree of filling is detected for example by way of the weight of the silo, by means of weighing cells 26. Discharge is effected by way of a plurality of screw weighing arrangements 50 and 51.<br>
The negatively conical structural configuration of the silo 1 provides that compacting of the solid 2 in lower layers is counteracted by the weight of the solid material itself. The fill density and thus for example also the electrical resistance of the material fill remain constant over the height involved.<br>
The weights of the conveyor screws 50b and 51b in each portion 3, 5 of the withdrawal region of the silo are detected by means of a signal evaluation and control unit 15 and the solid mass flow of each screw is<br><br>
11<br>
calculated by way of the speed of the respective screw. In addition, the filling level within the silo is detected by way of the weighing cells 26. The signal evaluation and control unit 15 controls the speed of the discharge members 50, 51, on the basis of the input signals 50c, 51c and 26a, by way of the controllable drive units 50a, 51a, in such a way that the filling level within the silo remains constant and all solid mass flows which are calculated from the weight 50c, 51c and the rotary speeds of the screws 50 and 51 are of the same magnitude. Alternatively to the screw weighing arrangement it is also possible to use a belt weighing arrangement or a weighed-out oscillating or shaker conveyor.<br>
In principle the invention is not limited to the discharge devices set forth but can be carried into effect with any continuously operating and controllable discharge member. The same applies for the continuous conveyor device which is disposed beneath the discharge members and which brings together the solid material flow issuing from the discharge devices and transports it away. Instead of a continuous conveyor device the solid issuing from the discharge members can also be fed directly to an item of equipment connected at a downstream location. The discharge cross-section of the silo is not restricted to a polygonal shape, preferably rectangular or square, but can also be round.<br>
