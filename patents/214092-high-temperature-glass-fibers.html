				<td>HIGH TEMPERATURE GLASS FIBERS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to continuous glass fibers for use in<br>
high temperature applications.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of continuous glass fibers in high temperature environments for acoustical<br>
and thermal insulating applications can be in the form of wound strands, packed fiber, or<br>
texturized strands. Texturization is accomplished by injecting the strands into cavities<br>
through a nozzle with compressed air. This process fluffs-up the strands and creates a<br>
fiber pack that is much lighter in density. However, applications that require these<br>
insulating characteristics at temperatures greater than 850°C (1562°F) are Limited in terms<br>
of the glass composition that can withstand the high temperature environment. An<br>
example of a texturized continuous glass fiber product is the use of E-glass and<br>
ADVANTEX®, (available from Owens Corning) glass fiber in mufflers. Texturization<br>
produces a fluffy fiber pack that is a better insulator, both thermally and acoustically.<br>
Filling mufflers with one or more lengths of fiberglass wool is disclosed by U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,569,471 to Ingemansson. The fiberglass wool is inserted into a space in a<br>
container by feeding a multifilament fiberglass thread into one end of a nozzle and<br>
advancing the thread through the nozzle with the aid of compressed air which is blown<br>
into the nozzle to cause the fibers of the thread to separate and become entangled, so that<br>
the thread emerges from the other end of the nozzle as a continuous length of fiberglass<br>
wool, which is blown by the effect of the compressed air through an opening into the<br>
container space at the same time as air is evacuated from the space.<br>
The standard glass composition for making continuous glass fiber strands is "E"<br>
glass. E glass, is the most common glass for making textile and reinforcement glass<br>
fibers. One advantage of E glass is that its liquidus temperature is approximately 93°C<br>
(200°F) below its forming temperature, the temperature at which the viscosity of the glass<br>
is customarily near 1000 poise. E glass melts and refines at relatively low temperatures<br>
and has a workable viscosity over a wide range of relatively low temperatures, a low<br>
liquidus temperature range, and a low devitrification rate. E glass compositions allow<br>
operating temperatures for producing glass fibers around 1038°C to 1316°C (1900°F to<br>
2400°F) where the liquidus temperature is approximately 1149°C (2100°F) or lower. The<br>
ASTM classification for E-glass fiber yarns used in printed circuit boards and aerospace<br>
applications defines the composition to be 52 to 56 weight % SiO2; 16 to 25 weight<br>
%CaO; 12 to 16 weight % A12O3; 5 to 10 weight % B2O3; 0 to 5 weight % MgO; 0 to 2<br>
weight % Na2O and K2O; 0 to 0.8 weight % TiO2; 0.05 to 0.4 weight % Fe2O3; 0 to 1.0<br>
weight % Fluoride.<br>
However, E-glass fiber containing 5 to 10 weight percent B2O3 is limited to<br>
temperatures less than 680°C to 690°C (1256 °F to 1274°F) since it will "sinter" at higher<br>
temperatures. Sintering is defined as the coalescence of filaments at contact points<br>
through viscous flow. Viscous flow typically occurs at temperatures greater than the<br>
annealing point. The annealing point of a glass is defined as the temperature<br>
corresponding to a viscosity of 1013 Poise. When filaments coalesce, the insulating ability<br>
of the fiber pack is reduced. In addition, a texturized fiber pack becomes brittle after<br>
sintering and can break into fiber fragments when stressed.<br>
Boron free E-Glass fibers sold as ADVANTEX® and disclosed in US Patent<br>
5,789,329 offer a significant improvement in operating temperature over boron containing<br>
E-glass. ADVANTEX® glass fiber fits the ASTM definition for E-glass fiber used in<br>
general use applications which is 52 to 62 weight % SiO2; 16 to 25 weight % CaO; 12 to<br>
16 weight % A12O3; 0 to 10 weight % B2O3; 0 to 5 weight % MgO; 0 to 2 weight % Na2O<br>
and K2O; 0 to 1.5 weight % TiO2; 0.05 to 0.8 weight % Fe2O3; 0 to 1.0 weight % Fluoride.<br>
However, ADVANTEX® glass fiber begins to sinter at temperatures greater than 740°C<br>
to 750°C (1364°F to 1382°F).<br>
Other than fused silica, S-glass is the only commercially available continuous glass<br>
fiber that can operate at temperatures greater than 850°C (l562qF). S-Glass is a family of<br>
glasses composed primarily of the oxides of magnesium, aluminum, and silicon with a<br>
certified chemical composition which conforms to an applicable material specification and<br>
which produces high mechanical strength. S-Glass has a composition of approximately 65<br>
weight % SiO2; 25 weight % A12O3; 10 weight % MgO. S-glass has a glass composition<br>
that was originally designed to be used in high strength applications such as ballistic<br>
armor. Therefore, even though S-glass can perform at high temperatures (up to 900°C<br>
(1652°F) for short periods of time), it is not the optimal composition for a high<br>
temperature insulating glass fiber.<br>
It has been determined that failure of the texturized fiber pack occurs at<br>
temperatures exceeding the annealing point (1013 Poise). A close approximation to the<br>
annealing point is the glass transition temperature, or Tg. Since the annealing point of<br>
most of the glasses presented in this invention are greater than what can be measured by<br>
most commercially available tests, Tg was used as a means of determining the upper use<br>
temperature of the fiber.<br>
Both E-glass and ADVANTEX® experience significant sintering at temperatures<br>
greater than the annealing point. S-glass, however, resists sintering at temperatures above<br>
the annealing point due to phase separation. S-glass fibers are formed by cooling very<br>
rapidly from the molten state into a solid, homogeneous glass. The rapid cooling during<br>
fiber forming does not allow the glass sufficient time to phase separate during the cooling<br>
period. Upon reheating, S-glass will phase separate from a homogeneous glass into 2<br>
separate glasses with different compositions in the temperature range between the glass<br>
transition temperature (Tg) and the miscibility limit. The glass transition temperature is<br>
approximately 820°C (1508°F) for S-glass, whereas the miscibility limit is not known. The<br>
phase separation of S-glass is a slow process that results in a 2 phase glass including a<br>
continuous SiO2 rich phase that has a greater viscosity than the original homogeneous<br>
glass and an SiO2 poor phase which has a lower viscosity. The overall viscosity of the<br>
fiber is determined by the morphology and composition of the SiO2 rich, high viscosity<br>
phase. The higher effective viscosity of the phase-separated glass allows the fiber to<br>
operate at greater temperatures than a homogeneous fiber. Phase separation in S-glass is a<br>
slow process and some viscous flow occurs prior to the development of the continuous<br>
high viscosity phase, which can result in reduced albeit acceptable performance.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention, in part, is a glass composition suitable for the formation of<br>
continuous glass fiber that is suitable for use in high temperature applications. The<br>
composition of the present invention may be inexpensively formed into glass fiber using<br>
low cost direct melting technology because of a relatively low forming viscosity and once<br>
formed into fibers resists softening and annealing because of a relatively high glass<br>
transition temperature. The composition of the present invention is more appropriately<br>
expressed in terms of mole percent rather than weight percent due to the dramatically<br>
different atomic weights of the alkaline earth oxides. The composition of the present<br>
invention is 60-72 mole percent SiO2, 10-20 mole percent Al2O3, 14.0 to 22.0 mole<br>
percent RO where RO equals the sum of MgO, CaO, SrO and BaO, 0 to 5 mole percent<br>
ZtO2, and 0 to 3 mole percent alkali. In a preferred embodiment the glass composition is<br>
substantially 61-68 mole percent SiO2, 15-19 mole percent Al2O3, 15 to 20 mole percent<br>
alkaline earth oxide, 0 to 3 mole percent ZrO2, and 0 to 3 mole percent alkali oxide.<br>
The desired properties of the present invention are: a viscosity of 1000 poise at a<br>
forming temperature of from 1371°C (2500°F) to 1510°C (2750°F), a liquidus temperature<br>
at least 28°C (50°F) below the forming temperature, and a glass transition temperature<br>
greater than 825°C (1517°F). The glass transition point (Tg) is a measure of a low<br>
temperature viscosity and the forming viscosity is a high temperature viscosity. One would<br>
expect these viscosities to be related. However, the glasses of the present invention have<br>
reduced forming viscosities and increased glass transition temperatures as compared with<br>
S-glass. This greater temperature dependence of the glass viscosity allows for inexpensive<br>
forming of fibers which exhibit good high temperature characteristics such as increased<br>
resistance to fiber-to-fiber coalescence and slumping of a fiber pack formed of the<br>
inventive compositions.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THe/DRAWING<br>
The present invention will become more fully understood from the detailed<br>
description of the invention and the accompanying drawings which are given by way of<br>
illustration only and thus do not limit the present invention.<br>
Glasses of the present invention were tested against S-glass by isothermally heat<br>
treating fiber bundles for 8 hours at different temperatures. The fiber bundles were<br>
mounted in epoxy after heat treatment and the cross-sections were analyzed using a<br>
scanning electron microscope (SEM) in backscatter mode to determine the extent of fiber<br>
coalescence.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The fiberizing properties of interest include the flberizing temperature and the<br>
liquidus. The fiberizing temperature is defined as the temperature corresponding to a<br>
viscosity of 1000 Poise (log 3.0 viscosity). Lowering the fiberizing temperature can<br>
reduce the production cost since it allows for a longer bushing life, increased throughput,<br>
and reduced energy usage. By lowering the log 3.0 viscosity, a bushing operates at a<br>
cooler temperature and therefore does not "sag" as quickly. Sag occurs in bushings held at<br>
an elevated temperature for extended periods. By lowering the log 3.0 temperature, the<br>
sag rate is reduced and the bushing life can be increased. In addition, a lower log 3.0<br>
allows for a higher throughput since more glass can be melted in a given period of time<br>
and thus the production cost is also reduced.<br>
The liquidus is the greatest temperature at which devitrification can occur upon<br>
cooling the glass melt. At all temperatures above the liquidus, the glass is completely<br>
molten.<br>
The final fiberizing property is referred to as "delta-T" which is simply the<br>
difference between the log 3.0 temperature and the liquidus. A larger delta-T offers a<br>
greater degree of flexibility during fiberizing and helps avoid devitrification.<br>
Devitrification is the formation of crystals within the melt. Increasing the delta-T<br>
also reduces the production cost by allowing for a greater bushing life and less sensitive<br>
forming process.<br>
The glasses of the present invention were melted in platinum/rhodium crucibles<br>
using reagent grade raw materials. Starting batch ingredients include SiO2, Al2O3, as well<br>
as chain modifiers from the source materials MgCO3, CaCO3, SrCO3, BaCO3, ZrO2, and<br>
Na2CO3. The glasses were melted at 3000°C (5432°F) for 6 hours and were stirred every<br>
2 hours to insure compositional homogeneity.<br>
The glass transition temperature in this invention was measured using a differential<br>
thermal analyzer, DTA. The forming viscosity in this invention was measured using a<br>
rotating spindle viscometer. The forming viscosity is defined as 1000 Poise. The liquidus<br>
in this invention was measured by placing a platinum container filled with glass in a<br>
thermal gradient furnace for 16 hours. The greatest temperature at which crystals were<br>
present was considered the liquidus temperature.<br>
To achieve a lower log 3.0 temperature and a higher annealing point temperature<br>
(Tg) the CaO-Al2O3-SiO2 family of glasses was selected as a starting point based on the<br>
high Tg"s and relatively low cost raw materials. The compositions lying along the phase<br>
boundary line that connects 2 eutectic compositions were melted and tested. These glasses<br>
are numbers 1,2, 3, and 8. Since these glasses lie on the phase boundary line they have a<br>
low liquidus and a large delta-T. The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of these glasses<br>
were measured to range between 423°C (794°F) for glass #1 and 859°C (1578°F) for glass<br>
#3.<br>
Because #3 has such a high log 3.0 viscosity, a direct weight percent substitution<br>
of A12O3 for SiO2 was made in glasses #9, #10, #55, #77, and #81. The A12O3 for SiO2<br>
substitution was used to lower log 3.0 while maintaining Tg. However, this substitution<br>
raises the liquidus which quickly shrinks the delta-T since it also lowers the forming<br>
viscosity.<br>
Both S-glass and glass #9 were fiberized in a single hole laboratory bushing. The<br>
monofilament fiber was wound on a collet to produce about 10 gram of fiber. The fiber<br>
was cut to produce a "hank" of fibers. Both glass compositions were tested separately in a<br>
temperature gradient furnace for 4 hours to determine the temperature at which sintering<br>
began. Sintering is defined as the point at which the viscosity becomes low enough for<br>
fibers to join together. This is roughly the same point at which the fiber-pack would<br>
collapse under its own weight in a high temperature environment such as an automotive<br>
exhaust system. The results of the lab mimic showed that S-glass sinters 30 K lower than<br>
glass #9. Glass #9 outperformed S-glass by about 30 K for the 4-hour test. It was<br>
determined that Tg needed to be between 850°C and 860°C (1562°F and 1580°F) in order<br>
to operate at temperatures similar to S-glass. Reducing log 3.0 and increasing delta-T<br>
were necessary to reduce the manufacturing cost.<br>
Glass #9 was used as the base glass since it outperformed S-glass and had a<br>
superior delta-T. To lower the viscosity, AI2O3 was substituted for SiC&gt;2 °n a weight<br>
percent basis. Although this substitution did not adversely affect Tg, the liquidus was<br>
increased to the point where the delta-T was not acceptable (see glasses #55, #77, and<br>
#81). In order to reduce the liquidus, other alkaline earths such as MgO, SrO, and BaO<br>
were substituted for CaO.<br>
The mole % percent substitution of MgO for CaO has a significant impact on<br>
reducing the liquidus, but also reduces Tg. The log 3.0 is largely unaffected although it<br>
was not extensively measured. This can be seen in Tables 3 and 4.<br>
Therefore the goal is to find the right mix of alkaline earth oxides to meet the<br>
target properties of the glass. Zirconia (ZrCh) can be added in small percentages to<br>
decrease the log 3.0 but at the same time increase Tg. The liquidus is also decreased with<br>
small additions of ZrC&gt;2.<br>
As is understood in the art, the above exemplary compositions do not always total<br>
precisely 100% of the listed components due to statistical conventions (for example,<br>
rounding and averaging). Of course, the actual amounts of all components, including any<br>
impurities, in a specific composition always total to 100%. Furthermore, it should be<br>
understood that where small quantities of components are specified in the compositions,<br>
for example, quantities on the order of about 0.05 weight percent or less, those<br>
components may be present in the form of trace impurities present in the raw materials,<br>
rather than intentionally added. Moreover, components may be added to the batch<br>
composition, for example, to facilitate processing, that are later eliminated, resulting in a<br>
glass composition that is essentially free of such components. Thus, for instance, although<br>
minute quantities of components such as fluorine and sulfate have been listed in various<br>
examples, the resulting glass composition may be essentially free of such components—for<br>
example, they may be merely trace impurities in the raw materials for the silica, calcium<br>
oxide, alumina, and magnesia components in commercial practice of the invention or they<br>
may be processing aids that are essentially removed during manufacture. As apparent<br>
from the above examples, glass fiber compositions of the invention have advantageous<br>
properties, such as low forming viscosities and wide (high) delta-T values. Other<br>
advantages and obvious modifications of the invention will be apparent to the artisan from<br>
the above description and further through practice of the invention.<br>
The addition of alkali oxides, such as Li2O, Na2O, and K2O are known to have a<br>
strong impact on reducing the glass transition temperature. Therefore additions of R2O<br>
should be kept to a minimum. Table #8 illustrates the effect of Na2O additions to<br>
ADVANTEX® glass.<br><br>
Glasses #96 and #110 were tested against S-glass by isothermally heat treating<br>
fiber bundles for 8 hours at different temperatures. The fiber bundles were mounted in<br>
epoxy after heat treatment and the cross-sections were polished. The polished cross-<br>
sections of the fiber bundles were analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM)<br>
in backscatter mode to determine the extent of fiber coalescence,<br><br>
SEM micrographs are presented in Figures 1-4 to illustrate the coalescence<br>
described in Table #9. From the micrographs presented in Figures 1-4, it is evident that<br>
both glass #96 and #110 outperform S-glass. S-glass had significant sintering occur at<br>
903°C (1647°F) and extensive fiber coalescence at 921°C (1690°F).<br>
