[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems that the Invention is to Solve] [0005]<br>
Here, in mounting the baggage hanging hook on the motorcycle described in the Patent Document 1, when the baggage hanging hook is mounted above the accommodating recessed portion, there may be a case in which the mounting portion is exposed to the outside. Also with respect to the motorcycle described in the Patent Document 2, a mounting portion of the baggage hanging hook is exposed to the outside. Accordingly, the improvement of the appearance is desirable. [0006]<br>
Further, in the motorcycle which is described in the Patent Document 1, the engaging hole is formed in the inside of the accommodating recessed portion and hence, it is necessary to provide a waterproof structure to cope with the engaging hole, whereby there has been a drawback that the<br><br>
structure becomes complicated. Still further, it is necessary to provide the holder which is engaged with the engaging portion of the locking member to the leg shield and hence, there has been a drawback that the number of part is increased, [0007]<br>
The present invention has been made under such circumstances and it is an object of the present invention to provide the inner box structure of a motorcycle which can enhance the appearance when the baggage hanging hook is mounted. It is another object of the present invention to provide the inner box structure of an automobile which can possess a waterproof property using the simple structure. [Means for solving the Problem] [0008]<br>
To achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention according to claim 1 is directed to an inner box structure of a motorcycle in which an accommodating recessed portion is mounted on a rear surface of a leg-shield and an opening portion of the accommodating recessed portion is covered with a lid such that the opening portion can be opened and closed, wherein a baggage hanging hook is mounted on a vehicle body side above the opening portion, and the lid covers a mounting portion of the baggage hanging hook when the opening portion is closed.<br><br>
The present invention according to claim 2 is, in addition to the constitution described in claim 1, characterized in that a locking member is mounted on the lid and an engaging portion of the locking member is engaged with the baggage hanging hook. [0010]<br>
The present invention according to claim 3 is, in addition to the constitution described in claim 1, characterized in that a sealing portion is interposed between the lid and the leg shield and passes below the locking member while going around the locking member in an approximately U shape. [0011]<br>
The present invention according to claim 4 is, in addition to the constitution described in claim 3, characterized in that the sealing portion is constituted by forming a projection member on the leg shield, by forming a groove portion in a lid portion, and by mounting the sealing member in the groove portion. [0012]<br>
The present invention according to claim 5 is, in addition to the constitution described in claim 3, characterized in that, in the leg shield, a discharge port is formed in a lower end of the sealing portion which is formed in an approximately U-shape.<br><br>
The present invention according to claim 6 is, in addition to the constitution described in claim 1, characterized in that a surface of the lid on which the locking member is mounted is formed below other surfaces of the lid. [0014]<br>
The present invention according to claim 7 is, in addition to the constitution described in claim 2, characterized in that the leg shield includes an approximately U-shaped lock protective cover which partially covers an outer peripheral surface of the locking member in a state that the lid is closed.<br>
[Advantage of the Invention] [0015]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 1, the baggage hanging hook is mounted on the vehicle body side above the opening portion of the accommodating recessed portion and the lid covers the mounting portion of the baggage hanging hook when the opening portion is closed and hence, the mounting portion cannot be viewed from the outside due to the lid whereby the appearance at the time of mounting the baggage hanging hook can be enhanced. [0016]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 2, the locking member is mounted on the lid and the engaging portion<br><br>
of the locking member is engaged with the baggage hanging hook and hence, it is unnecessary to mount the holder which engages the engaging portion of the locking member on the leg shield whereby it is possible to reduce the number of parts. Further, since it is unnecessary to form the engaging hole in the inside of the accommodating recessed portion, the waterproof structure to cope with the engaging hole is unnecessary whereby it is possible to provide the simple structure. [0017]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 3, the sealing portion which is interposed between the lid and the leg shield passes below the locking member while going around the locking member in an approximately U-shape and hence, it is possible to separately seal the locking member and the accommodating recessed portion whereby it is possible to enhance the waterproof property of the inner box. [0018]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 4, the sealing portion is constituted by forming a projection member on the leg shield, by forming a groove portion in a lid portion, and by mounting the sealing member in the groove portion and hence, it is possible to form the sealing portion using the simple constitution. And it is also possible to improve the rigidity of the lid.<br><br>
According to the invention described in claim 5, in the leg shield, a discharge port is formed in a lower end of the sealing portion which is formed in an approximately U shape and hence, it is possible to discharge the condensation and rainwater or the like speedily from the lower end of the sealing portion which is formed in an approximately U shape to the outside. [0020]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 6, the surface of the lid on which the locking member is mounted is formed below other surfaces of the lid and hence, it is possible to shorten a length of the locking member and, at the same time, it is possible to increase a depth in the fore-and-aft direction of the inner box so as to increase a capacity of the inner box. [0021]<br>
According to the invention described in claim 7, the leg shield includes the approximately U-shaped lock protective cover which partially covers the outer peripheral surface of the locking member in a state that the lid is closed and hence, even when a robber tries to break the locking member or release the lock from the outside using a driver or the like, such an action is interrupted by the lock protective cover whereby a theft prevention effect can be obtained. [Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention]<br><br>
Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention is explained based on the attached drawings. Here, the drawings are assumed to be viewed in the direction of symbols. [0023]<br>
Fig. 1 is a left side view of a scooter type motorcycle according to the present invention. In the motorcycle 10, a portion above a front portion of a vehicle body is covered with a front cover 11, while side portions below the front portion of the vehicle body are covered with a pair of left and right front-side covers 12 which are arranged below the side portions of the front cover 11 (only the left front-side cover shown in the drawing).  Further, on front end portions of the respective front-side covers 12, blinkers 13 which constitute lamps are mounted. On a front portion of the front cover 11, an opening portion 14 which allows a mounting member which extends from a vehicle-body side to pass therethrough is formed, wherein the mounting member is provided for arranging a front basket, a carrier, a number plate. [0024]<br>
Here, numeral 15 indicates a handle cover which covers a handle 16, numeral 17 indicates a head lamp which is mounted on a handle cover 15, numeral 18 indicates a brake lever, numeral 19 indicates a back mirror, numeral 20 indicates a front fender which covers a front wheel 21 from above.<br><br>
Further, on a rear portion of the front cover 11, a leg shield 22 which covers leg portions of a driver and is formed of synthetic resin is mounted in a state that the leg shield 22 surrounds a head pipe 24 (see Fig. 2) which is connected between a front fork 23 which supports the front wheel 21 and the handle 16. To a rear end portion of the leg shield 22, a step floor 25 on which a driver and a pillion rider place their feet is connected. Side portions of the step floor 25 are covered with a pair of side covers 26 (only the left-side cover shown in the drawing), while lower portions of the side covers 26 are covered with an under cover 27. [0026]<br>
Further, a lower periphery of the seat 28 is covered with a body cover 29 and a pair of body side covers 3 0 (only the left-side body side cover shown in the drawing), while a carrier-integral-type grab rail 31 which the pillion rider grasps is mounted on a rear portion of the vehicle body. A tail lamp 32 is arranged below the grab rail 31. [0027]<br>
A rear wheel 34 is mounted on a rear end of a power unit 33 which is exposed from below the body cover 29 and the body side covers 30. The rear wheel 3 4 is covered with a rear fender 35 from above, while a rear cushion unit 36 extends between a rear end of the power unit 33 and the vehicle body side.<br><br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, in the leg shield 22, a mounting hole 37 which is formed in an upper portion of a back surface thereof is fastened to a back-surface-side stay 38 which extends in the rearward direction from an upper portion of the head pipe 24 together with a baggage hanging hook 40 using bolts 39. Further, a mounting portion 41 which is formed on a peripheral portion of the leg shield 22 is fixed to bosses (not shown in the drawing) which are formed on corresponding portions of the front cover 11 and the front-side covers 12 using small bolts thus fixing the mounting portion 41 to the vehicle body. Here, the leg shield 22 is formed such that a hatched peripheral region thereof around the mounting hole 37 in Fig. 3(c) has a substantially uniform thickness. [0029]<br>
The baggage hanging hook 40 which is mounted on the back-side stay 38 of the head pipe 24 together with the leg shield 22 is formed of synthetic resin and includes a recessed mounting portion 40a having a bottom surface in which the bolt 39 is inserted, a distal end portion 40b which extends upwardly on a rear surface side of the leg shield 22, and a flange portion 40c which extends downwardly from an outer peripheral surface of the mounting portion 40a and constitutes a portion to be engaged. A bag or the like can be suspended in a state that a string portion of the bag or the like is engaged with the distal end portion 40b.<br><br>
On the rear surface of the leg shield 22, an acconunodating recessed portion 42 which is indented frontwardly is integrally formed. An opening portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42 which opens rearwardly is covered with a synthetic-resin-made lid 43 in a state that the opening portion can be opened and closed. Accordingly, an inner box is constituted by the accommodating recessed portion 42 and the lid 43. Further, a center portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42 is formed in a state that the center portion avoids the head pipe 24 and a down tube 44 which is connected with the head pipe 24. The above-mentioned mounting hole 37 is formed in an upper portion of the center portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42 and includes a wall surface 45 which is arranged substantially parallel to the closed lid 43 and has an approximately U-shaped lower end. [0031]<br>
Further, as shown in Fig. 2 to Fig. 4, on a peripheral portion of the lid 43, a pair of hinge portions 46, 46 are mounted at a lower portion thereof and a pair of side stoppers 47, 4 7 are mounted at both side portions thereof. These hinge portions 46, 46 and side stoppers 47, 47 are respectively inserted into a pair of mounting holes 48, 48 which are formed on a lower portion of an opening peripheral portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42 and a pair of guide holes<br><br>
49, 4 9 which are formed on both side portions of the opening peripheral portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42. A curved portion 47a of each side stopper 4 7 is engaged with the guide hole 49 in a state that the lid 43 is fully opened and, as indicated by an imaginary line in Fig. 2, the lid 43 is held in a state that the lid 43 is opened at a given angle using the hinge portions 46 as a fulcrum. [0032]<br>
Further, the lid 43 includes a stepped surface 50 on an upper portion of an intermediate portion thereof in a state that the stepped surface 50 is formed lower than other surfaces around the upper portion of an intermediate portion by one stage. The stepped surface 50 is formed in an approximately U-shape in conformity with a wall surface 45 of the accommodating recessed portion 42 of the leg shield 22. Further, a locking member 51 is mounted on the stepped surface 50 above the intermediate portion. By operating an engaging portion 51a of the locking member 51 using a key (not shown in the drawing) in a state that accommodating recessed portion 42 is closed by the lid 43, the engaging portion 51a is engaged with a flange portion 40c formed on the baggage hanging hook 4 0 to establish a locked state. [0033]<br>
In a state that the accommodating recessed portion 42 is closed by the lid 43, an upper peripheral portion of the<br><br>
stepped surface 50 of the lid 43 is positioned below a distal end portion 40b of the baggage hanging hook 40 and, at the same time, the stepped surface 50 of the lid 43 covers a mounting portion 40a of the baggage hanging hook 40. [0034]<br>
Further, on a wall surface 45 of the accommodating recessed portion 42 of the leg shield 22, a lock protective cover 52 is mounted at a position where the lock protective cover 52 faces the locking member 51. As shown in Fig. 3(d), the lock protective cover 52 is formed in an approximately U shape such that, when the lid 43 is closed, the engaging portion 51a of the locking member 51 partially covers an outer peripheral surface of the locking member 51 with a gap of a degree which allows an operation of the engaging portion 51a of the locking member 51. Further, a lower portion of the lock protective cover 52 has a wall thickness thereof gradually increased toward a proximal portion from a distal portion. [0035]<br>
Further, between the leg shield 22 and the lid 43, a sealing portion 53 is formed in a state that the sealing portion 53 surrounds the periphery of the opening portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42. The sealing portion 53 includes a projecting lug 54 which is formed on the leg shield 22, a projecting member 56 which constitutes a groove portion 55 on the lid 43, and a sealing member 57 which is mounted in<br><br>
the groove portion 55. The projecting lug 54 and the groove portion 55 are provided at positions where the projecting lug 54 and the groove portion 55 face each other in a state that lid 43 is closed. By bringing the projecting lug 54 and the sealing member 57 which is mounted in the groove portion 55 into contact with each other over the periphery of the opening portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42, it is possible to achieve the waterproof of the inside of the accommodating recessed portion 42. Further, above the center portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42, the projecting lug 54 and the groove portion 55 respectively include approximately U-shaped portions 54a, 55a which go around the lock protective cover 52 and the locking member 51 in a U shape and pass below these members 52, 51. Further, a lower end of the approximately U-shaped portion 54a of the projecting lug 54 is inclined downwardly from a distal end to a proximal end thereof. On the wall surface 45 of the accommodating recessed portion 42, a water discharge opening 58 is formed in a lower end of the approximately U-shaped portion 54a of the projecting lug 54. [0036]<br>
Next, the manner of operation of the mode for carrying out the invention provided with the above-mentioned constitution is explained. In the motorcycle 10 of this mode for carrying out the invention, the baggage hanging hook 40<br><br>
is mounted on the head pipe 24 above the opening portion of the accommodating recessed portion 42, and the lid 43 covers the mounting portion 40a of the baggage hanging hook 40 when the lid 43 closes the opening portion and hence, the mounting portion 4 0a cannot be viewed from the outside due to the lid 43 whereby the appearance when the baggage hanging hook 40 is mounted can be enhanced. [0037]<br>
Further, the locking member 51 is mounted on the lid 43 and the engaging portion 51a of the locking member 51 is engaged with the flange portion 40c of the baggage hanging hook 40 and hence, it is unnecessary to mount a holder which is engaged with the engaging portion 51a of the locking member 51 on the leg shield 22 whereby the number of parts can be reduced and, at the same time, it is unnecessary to form the engaging hole in the inside of the accommodating recessed portion 42 and hence, the waterproof structure against the engaging hole becomes unnecessary thus providing the simple structure. [0038]<br>
The sealing portion 53 which is interposed between the lid 43 and the leg shield 22 goes around the locking member 51 in an approximately U-shape and passes below the locking member 51 and hence, it is possible to separately seal the locking member 51 which is engaged with or disengaged from the flange portion 40c of the baqqaqe hanqinq hook 40 and the<br><br>
accommodating recessed portion 42 whereby the waterproof<br>
property is enhanced.<br>
[0039]<br>
Further, in the sealing portion 53, the projecting lug 54 is formed on the leg shield 22, the groove portion 55 is formed in the lid 43, and the sealing member 57 is mounted in the groove portion 55 and hence, it is possible to form the sealing portion 53 with a relatively simple constitution. [0040]<br>
Further, in the leg shield 22, the water discharge opening 58 is formed in the lower end of the sealing portion 53 which is formed in an approximately U-shape and hence, it is possible to speedily discharge the condensation or the like from the lower end of the sealing portion 53 which is formed in an approximately U-shape. [0041]<br>
Further, in the lid 43, the stepped surface 50 on which the locking member 51 is mounted is formed lower than other surfaces and hence, it is possible to shorten a length of the locking member 51 and, at the same time, a depth of the inner box in the fore-and-aft direction can be increased whereby a volume of the inner box can be increased. [0042]<br>
Further, the leg shield 22 includes the approximately U-shaped lock protective cover 52 which partially covers the<br><br>
outer peripheral surface of the locking member 51 in a state that the lid 43 is closed and hence, even when a robber tries to break the locking member 51 or release the lock from the outside using a driver or the like, such an action is interrupted by the lock protective cover 52 whereby a theft prevention effect can be obtained. [0043]<br>
Here, the present invention is not limited to the above-mentioned respective embodiments and can be suitably modified and improved.<br>
The sealing portion of the present invention is sufficient so long as the sealing portion is interposed between the leg shield and the lid. Further, the projecting lug may be mounted on the lid and the groove in which the sealing member is mounted may be formed in the leg shield.<br>
Further, although the groove portion is formed using the projecting member in this embodiment, the groove may be directly formed in the leg shield or the lid.<br>
Still further, although the baggage hanging hook is mounted on the back surface side stay of the head pipe in this embodiment, it is sufficient that the baggage hanging hook is mounted on any one of members on the vehicle body side. [Brief Description of the Drawings]<br><br>
