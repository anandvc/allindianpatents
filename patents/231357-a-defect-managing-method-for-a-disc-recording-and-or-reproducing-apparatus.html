				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a defect managing method for a disc-<br>
recording and/or reproducing apparatus This invention has been divided out of<br>
Patent Application No.369/CAL/99.<br>
The present invention is in the field of managing a disc and its<br>
defects, and more particularly, to a recording medium for storing defect<br>
management information with respect to whether linear replacement is used, a<br>
method of effectively managing defects to record and/or reproduce video and/or<br>
audio data from a digital versatile disc random access memory (DVD-RAM) in<br>
real time, and a method of recording data in real time using defect management<br>
information.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art.<br>
Real time recording or reproduction means that a given amount of<br>
data is necessarily recorded or reproduced within a given time since input<br>
information is lost if it is not processed at the moment data is input, and since<br>
a phenomenon such as pause of an image or temporary interruption of music occurs<br>
with reproduction of data as abnormal information if data is not recorded or reproduced<br>
at a predetermined speed. The above described problems are caused since the<br>
input of information cannot be temporally controlled by a recording and<br>
reproducing apparatus.<br>
In the DVD-RAM standard version 1.0, a method of managing defects<br>
generated on a disc has been disclosed to increase the reliability of data<br>
recorded on the disc. Slipping replacement and linear replacement are included<br>
as the disclosed defect management method : the first method processes defects<br>
detected in an initializing process ; and the second method replaces an error<br>
correction code (ECC) block unit (16-sector unit) including a sector having a<br>
defect generated during use of the disc with a defect-free ECC block in a spare<br>
area.<br>
The slipping replacement is used to minimize a reduction in the recording<br>
or reproduction speed due to defects, in which a logical sector number to be provided<br><br>
to a defective sector is provided to a sector next to the defective sector detected<br>
during a certification process for investigating defects of a disc when the disc is<br>
initialized, that is, data is recorded or reproduced by slipping a sector on which a<br>
defect is generated during recording or reproduction. Here, a real physical sector<br>
number is pushed back by the sector number designated by slipping the defective<br>
sector. Such a left-behind phenomeron is solved by using as many sectors as there<br>
are defects in a spare area located a' the end portion of a corresponding recording<br>
area.<br>
However, the slipping replacement cannot be used for a defect generated<br>
while a disc is used. When a defecti /e portion is disregarded and skipped,<br>
discontinuity is generated on logical sector numbering, which means that the<br>
slipping replacement violates file system rules. Thus, the linear replacement is used<br>
when a defect is generated during use of the disc, which means the replacement of<br>
an ECC block including a defective sector with an ECC block existing in a spare<br>
area.<br>
When the linear replacement s used, no vacuum exists in a logical sector<br>
number, however, the position of a sector on a disc is discontinuous, and real data<br>
corresponding to a defective ECC block exists in the spare area.<br>
As described above, when real time recording, in which the time for<br>
temporarily-input information cannot be arbitrarily delayed, such as, recording of<br>
broadcast information or a real image, is necessary, information is recorded in an<br>
area to be linearly-replaced by undergoing a process in which a real pickup goes up<br>
to the spare area and searches for an area to be linearly replaced, and a process in<br>
which the real pickup comes back. Hence, the recording speed is reduced, so that<br>
information input in real time cannot be continuously recorded when the linear<br>
replacement is used.<br>
It is prescribed that a DVD-RAM drive according to the DVD-RAM standard<br>
version 1.0 processes all of this defect management to reduce the burden of the<br>
host computer used in the drive. The host computer is designed to transmit a<br>
command ordered not to manage defects to the drive using a command denoted in<br>
an interface standard. That is, if the host computer determines whether defect<br>
management will be performed, the defect management itself is supposed to be<br>
performed by the drive.<br><br>
Even when the host computer does not manage defects according to the<br>
need of an application program, the DVD-RAM disc according to the DVD-RAM<br>
standard version 1.0 must necessaril/ manage defects recorded in a primary defect<br>
list (PDL) and a secondary defect list (SDL) according to a defect management rule<br>
if an area slipping replaced or linear replaced due to defect management performed<br>
by another drive exists. Here, it is prescribed that the position of a defective sector<br>
replaced according to slipping replacement should be recorded in the PDL, and the<br>
position of a defective block replacec according to linear replacement should be<br>
recorded in the SDL. That is, when cata is recorded after setting the fact that a<br>
specific drive should not perform defect management using the linear replacement,<br>
it cannot be ensured that other drives must also not perform the linear replacement<br>
on the same disc.<br>
Therefore, when real time recording is performed by a current DVD-RAM<br>
disc, it may be difficult because of an area to be used by the linear replacement.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
To solve the above problems, it is an objective of the present invention to<br>

with whether linear replacement is used or not, to record real time data.<br>

managing method for a disc recording and/or reproducing apparatus comprising the<br>
steps of : (a) recording information representing use or non-use of linear replacement<br>
defect management with respect tc an entire disc or a specified area of the disc on the<br>
disc ; and (b) determining whether a defeclive area of the disc is to be replaced by a<br>
block in a spare area of the disc using linear replacement according to the information<br>

information is information that the linear replacement will not be used ; (c) determining<br>
whether a linearly-replaced defect exists in an area to record data in, when the data<br>
to be recorded is real time data ; and (d) determining whether a new defect is<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Preferred embodiments of a recording medium storing defect management<br>
information for recording real time da:a, a defect managing method using the same,<br>
and a real time data recording method will now be described with reference to the<br>
attached drawings.<br><br>
First, slipping replacement and linear replacement will be described in detail<br>
eferring to FIGS. 1 and 2 in order to help in the understanding of the present<br>
invention.<br>
FIG. 1 is a view for explaining a defect management method using the<br>
slipping replacement. Physical addresses on a disc shown in FIG. 1 are records 1<br>
as P1, P2, P3, ..., Pn, and logical addresses must be provided to record real date in<br>
this physically-segmented sector. These logical addresses act as addresses<br>
allowing a real file system to search for its own data. However, the relationship<br>
between the physical addresses and the logical addresses is made in a disc<br>
initialization process. If a defect is detected on the third physical sector P3 as<br>
shown in FIG. 1, a logical address is not designated to this defective sector, and a<br>
logical sector number L3 is designated to the next physical sector P4. Then, the<br>
logical sectors are sequentially pushed back by the number of defective sectors,<br>
and a spare area located at the er d of a corresponding data group is used by the<br>
pushed portion. In this slipping replacement method, effective processing in sector<br>
units is possible by simply slipping a defective region, and a pickup does not need<br>
to move to a different place upon recording and reproduction by simply disregarding<br>
and skipping a defective portion. Thus, the defective region can be avoided while<br>
minimizing the delay time. Here, the position of a defective sector replaced bythe<br>
slipping replacement is recorded in the PD_.<br>
FIG. 2 is a view for explain ng a defect management method using linear<br>
replacement. In the linear replacement for processing defects generated while a<br>
disc is used after being initialized the defects are managed in an ECC block unit,<br>
i.e., in units of 16 sectors. In other words, when an error is generated at a specific<br>
sector and a defect is thus detected, if the movement in units of at least 16 sectors<br>
is not made for error correction, the error correction unit of each data previously<br>
recorded in a disc must be changed. Thus, processing in an ECC block unit must<br>
be performed, and the slipping reolacement method of slipping a defective sector<br>
and designating a logical sector cannot be used since the logical address of an area<br>
where data has already been recorded cannot be changed. When a defect is<br>
generated in a logical block LB3 as shown in FIG. 2, the defective region is<br>
recorded in the SDL to be preverted from being used, and the defective portion is<br>
replaced with a usable block existing in a spare area. The replaced block (SBk in<br><br>
FIG. 2) in the spare area has the same logical block number (LB3) as the erroneous<br>
block.<br>
In a reproduction sequence, as shown in FIG. 2, reading is continued just<br>
before to a defective block as in an area 1, a replaced ECC block existing in the<br>
spare area is read by moving a pickup or the like as in an area 2, and data is<br>
continuously read from a block right next to the defective block as in an area 3. In<br>
order to process defects as describe d above, pickup movement is caused such as a<br>
process for searching for data and s process for returning to the block right next to<br>
the defective block after reading the replaced block. Thus, much time is required to<br>
read or write data, so that this defec: management is not appropriate for real time<br>
recording.<br>
FIG. 3 is a table of a disc definition structure (DDS) existing in a defect<br>
management area (DMA) of a DVD-RAM. In particular, a byte position (BP) 3, a<br>
disc certification flag, records the certified contents of the entire disc, and BPs 16<br>
through 39, group certification flags, record the contents of certification of 24 data<br>
groups.<br>
In addition, BPs 0 and 1 are DDS identifiers, and BPs 4 through 7 are the<br>
values of counters for updating DDS/PDL representing the total number of times in<br>
which a DDS/PDL block is updated and rewritten. That is, when initialization starts,<br>
the value of a counter is set to be "0', and increases by one whenever the DDS/PDL<br>
is updated or rewritten. All DDS/PDL and SDL'blocks must have the same counter<br>
value after formatting is completed. BPs 8 arid 9 denote the number of groups, and,<br>
for example, 24 groups are recorded as "0018" (hexadecimal).<br>
FIG. 4A illustrates the structures of the disc certification flag shown in FIG. 3.<br>
When a bit b7 among three bits b7, b6 and bo representing an in-process state is<br>
"Ob", it indicates format completion, and when the bit b7 is "1b", it indicates an<br>
under-formation state. When the bit b6 is "Ob", it indicates the progress of<br>
formatting using full certification, and when the bit b6 is "1b", it indicates the<br>
progress of formatting using partial certification. When the bit b5 is "Ob", it indicates<br>
the progress of formatting on the em ire disc, and when the bit b5 is "1b", it indicates<br>
the progress of formatting on only groups, and indicates that the group certification<br>
flag is effective. When a bit b1 representing user certification is "Ob", it indicates<br>
that a disc has never been certified by a user and when the bit b1 is "1b", it<br><br>
indicates that a disc has been certified one or more times by a user. When a bit bO<br>
representing disc manufacturer certification is "Ob", it indicates that a disc has never<br>
been certified by a manufacturer, and when the bit 0 is "1b", it indicates that the disc<br>
has been certified one or more times by the manufacturer. Other bits b4, b3, and b2<br>
are reserved. However, "in-process" is set to oe "1 ]" by any certification before<br>
formatting, and when formatting is completed, the "in-process" is reset to be "000".<br>
FIG. 4B illustrates the structure of each of the group certification flags of the<br>
bit positions 16 through 39 shown in FIG. 3. When a bit b7 among two bits b7 and<br>
b6 representing an in-process state is-. "0b", it indicates format completion of a<br>
corresponding group, and when the bit b7 is "1b", it indicates that the corresponding<br>
group is being formatted. When the bit b6 is "Ob", it indicates that the group is being<br>
formatted using full certification, and when the bit b6 is "1b", it indicates that the<br>
group is being formatted using partial certification. When a bit b1 representing user<br>
certification is "Ob", it indicates that the group has never been certified by a user,<br>
and when the bit b1 is "1b", it indicates that the group has been certified one or<br>
more times by a user. Other bits b5, b4, b3, b2, and b0 are reserved.<br>
FIG. 5 is a table showing the contents of a secondary defect list (SDL). RBP<br>
is the position of a relative byte starting with 0. Relative byte positions 0 and 1 are<br>
SDL identifiers, and relative byte positions 2 and 3 are reserved. Relative byte<br>
positions 4 through 7 denote the total number of updated SDL blocks, and SDL<br>
updating counter values increases by one whenever the content of SDL is updated.<br>
Relative byte positions 8 through 15 denote spare area full flags, and relative byte<br>
positions 16 through 19 denote DDS/FDL updating counter values each indicating<br>
the total number of times the DDS/PDl. block is updated and rewritten. The counter<br>
value is set to be "0" when initialization starts, and increases by 1 whenever the<br>
DDS/PLD is updated or rewritten. As mentioned above, all the DDS/PDL and SDL<br>
blocks must have the same count value after formatting is finished. Relative byte<br>
positions 20 and 21 are reserved, and relative byte positions 22 and 23 indicate the<br>
number of entries in the SDL. The rerraining relative byte positions indicate each<br>
SDL entry.<br>
FIG. 6 illustrates the structure of the spare area full flag of the relative byte<br>
positions 8 through 15 shown in FIG. 5 In FIG. 6, if a bit representing a<br>
corresponding group is "1", it indicates that no spare blocks are left in the<br><br>
corresponding group, and if the bit is "0". it indicates that a spare block remains in<br>
the corresponding group.<br>
FIG. 7 illustrates the structure of the SDL entry shown in FIG. 5. In FIG. 7,<br>
FRM is a bit representing whether a defective block has been replaced. When the<br>
defective block has been replaced, FRM records a binary "0", and when the<br>
deflective block has not been replaced or nc spare areas exist, FRM records a<br>
binary "1". The SDL entry includes the sector number of the first sector of a<br>
defective block, and the sector number of the first sector of a replacement block.<br>
Here, if the defective block has not been replaced, a hexadecimal "000000" is<br>
record in an area where the first seotor number of the replacement block is<br>
recorded.<br>
Meanwhile, in real time recording, whether corresponding data can be<br>
processed within a given time becomes more important than some errors of real<br>
data. In particular, in the case of an image or the like, an error is generated to part<br>
of a screen when a small error exists in the image. On the other hand, when input<br>
data cannot be processed in time, continuous data error is generated to make<br>
normal reproduction impossible. Therefore, the processing of data in time is more<br>
important.<br>
Thus, as for the real time recording, a method allowing non-use of the linear<br>
replacement must be suggested. v\hen the linear replacement is not used, there<br>
must be a portion recording the fact that a corresponding disc is in use without using<br>
the linear replacement. A method o recording such a content will be described<br>
referring to FIGS. 8A and 8B.<br>
FIGS. 8A and 8B illustrate tho structures of the disc certification flag and the<br>
group certification flag of the DDS pioposed by the present invention to record real<br>
time data, respectively. The structures of the disc certification flag and the group<br>
certification flag of FIGS. 8A and 8B are the same as those of FIGS. 4A and 4B<br>
except for a bit position b2. That is, as shown in FIG. 8A, when the entire<br>
corresponding disc is used without the linear replacement, the bit position b2 of the<br>
disc certification flag is set as "1", and when the corresponding disc is used by the<br>
linear replacement as in the prior art the bit position b2 is set as "0". In FIGS. 8A<br>
and 8B, information associated with use or non-use of the linear replacement stored<br>
in the bit position 2(b2) is called a dij.c defect management mode.<br><br>
Also, when only specific groups are partially initialized to prevent the linear<br>
replacement, as shown in FIG. 8B, the bit position 2(b2) of the group certification<br>
flag for a corresponding group is set as "1" to indicate that linear replacement is not<br>
^performed on a data region in the corresponding group. In an embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the bit positions 2(b2) of the disc certification flag and the group<br>
certification flag are used as shown n FIGS. 8A and 8B, but another reserved bit<br>
can be used. Here, each existing b2 region is reserved, and its value is recorded as<br>
"0".<br>
When the bit b2 for a disc defect management mode of the disc certification<br>
flag or group certification flag is set ,as "1" upon initialization of a disc, the SDL<br>
records only the start sector address, of a block having a defect generated during<br>
use of the disc, records an FRM bit of the SDL entry as "1", and the linear<br>
replacement is not performed. A hekadecimal "000000" is recorded in an area for<br>
recording the first sector number of a replacement block of the SDL entry.<br>
In this way, while compatibilit/ between a defect managing method based on<br>
a current DVD-RAM standard and a method of the present invention is maintained,<br>
i.e., while a method capable of indicating the existence of non-linearly-replaced<br>
blocks as in an existing defect managing method is suggested, a method allowing a<br>
defective block not to be linearly replaced is also provided to thereby accomplish<br>
recording and reproduction of real t me data.<br>
A determination of whether a defective region will be replaced by a block<br>
existing in a spare area using linear replacement is made by information associated<br>
with use or non-use of linear replacement defect management recorded in a defect<br>
management region on the entire disc or a specific area of the disc regardless of the<br>
type of data to be recorded in a conesponding area.<br>
Also, a determination of wherher a defective region will be replaced by a<br>
block existing in a spare area using the linear replacement is made by information<br>
associated with use or non-use of linear replacement defect management recorded<br>
in a defect management region on the entire disc or in a specific area on the disc in<br>
the case of only data required to be recorded in real time.<br>
A method of preventing linear replacenent with respect to the entire disc or a<br>
specific group of discs was described on the basis of the above-described<br>
embodiment. In another embodiment, when a disc defect management mode is set<br><br>
as "1", it can be used as information that the linear replacement is not performed<br>
with respect to a block having a defect in an area of a disc for recording information<br>
requiring real time recording and reproduction, but the linear replacement can be<br>
performed with respect to an area of a aisc not requiring real time recording. In this<br>
case, when data not requiring real time recording has already been recorded in an<br>
area in which real time data must be receded, and a defective region is thus<br>
linearly replaced, the linear replacement of the defective region must be capable of<br>
being canceled. Therefore, when the disc defect management mode is set as "1",<br>
this can mean that the linear replacement of the defect can be canceled when real<br>
time information is recorded.<br>
In order to prevent entire linear replacement with respect to the entire disc or<br>
a given group on the disc, information associated with the disc defect management<br>
mode is set as "1" upon initialization. On the other hand, when linear replacement<br>
is not performed only in the case of recording real time data, there is no need to set<br>
the defect management mode information upon initialization. That is, when it is<br>
determined that there is a necessi y for recording real time data in a disc, the disc<br>
defect management mode is set as. "1" just before the real time data is recorded. At<br>
this time, a determination of whether a corresponding disc is suitable for recording<br>
real time data is made on the basis of the amount or distribution of a defect<br>
generated on the disc. When it is determined that the disc is suitable, the disc<br>
defect management mode is set as "1". Otherwise, a process for informing a user<br>
that the disc is not suitable for recording real time data is required.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flowchart illustrating a method of recording data in real time<br>
without performing defect management using linear replacement with respect to only<br>
data desired to be recorded when the disc defect management mode is "1".<br>
In FIG. 9, first, a determination of whetner a disc defect management mode is<br>
"1" is set before recording of data or, a disc begins, in step S101. If the disc defect<br>
management mode is "1", it is determined whether data to be recorded is real time<br>
data, in step S103. If the defect management mode is "0", every data is recorded on<br>
the basis of a general defect managing method defined in the standard book version<br>
1.0, in steps S102 and S108. When it is determined in step S103 that data to be<br>
recorded is not real time data, step S' 02 of performing general defect management<br>
is performed. When it is determined h step S103 that data to be recorded is real<br><br>
time data, it is determined whether an already-linearly-replaced defect exists in an<br>
area where data is to be recorded, ir step S104.<br>
When it is determined in step S104 that the linearly-replaced defect exists in<br>
the area to record data in, the linearl/-replaced defect is canceled, in step S105.<br>
When no linearly-replaced defect exists in the area to record data in, it is<br>
determined whether a newly-detected defect exists in the area to record data in, in<br>
step S 106.<br>
When it is determined in step S106 that a new defect is detected, information<br>
representing that a defect has not been linearly replaced is recorded in a secondary<br>
defect list (SDL) of a defect management area, in step S107. Next, data is recorded<br>
in a desired area in step S108. Also when a new defect Is not detected in step<br>
S106, step S108 of recording real time data in a desired region is performed.<br>
Step S105 of canceling a linearly-replaced defect, and step S107 of<br>
recording information representing that a defect has not been linearly replaced are<br>
performed by recording the first sector number of a replacement block as a<br>
hexadecimal "000000", among linearly-replaced defect information recorded in the<br>
SDL, and by recording the FRM information as "1". In this case, since the disc<br>
defect management mode is set as "I", it can be recognized from the comparison of<br>
this mode information with FRM information that the meaning of the FRM<br>
information becomes different from that of existing FRM information.<br>
That is, the FRM information tased on the existing standard book denotes<br>
that a block having a defect generated for a certain reason has not been replaced<br>
with a block in a spare area or no spare areas can be replaced. On the other hand,<br>
FRM information based on a new definition is added to the meaning of the existing<br>
FRM and can be information representing that when the disc defect management<br>
mode is "1", the linear replacement of a defective block replaced by an existing<br>
linear replacement method has been cancelec for real time recording, or the<br>
defective block has not been linearly replaced for real time recording.<br>
Since a disc whose defect management mode is set as "1" is likely to include<br>
real time information, the disc can be utilized as information of prohibiting<br>
reallocation of information on a disc without consideration of real time information.<br>
Piece collection of collecting the pieces of a file on a disc, and read after<br>
reallocation can be included as a method of reallocating the information on a disc.<br><br>
The read after allocation is a method of reading data and then replacing a data<br>
block likely to have a defect with a block located in a spare area.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates the structure) of an improved SDL entry for canceling linear<br>
replacement proposed by the present invention. When an already-replaced defect<br>
exists on a corresponding disc upon recording of real time data, a method of<br>
recording the information of an area, n which the first sector number of the<br>
replacement block as described above is recorded, as a hexadecimal "000000" and<br>
setting an FRM bit as "1" is exemplified as a process for canceling the linear<br>
replacement.<br>
This method can minimize the change in the existing standard. However, in<br>
this method, the information of a block which is determined as defective and<br>
replaced must be deleted, so that linear replacement may be arbitrarily performed,<br>
canceled, and again performed without sequentially using a spare area. In<br>
particular, when a linearly-replaced b ock in the spare area is defective and again<br>
replaced, information associated with the linearly-replaced defective block in the<br>
spare area is lost.<br>
Thus, it would be preferable that blocks in a corresponding spare area are<br>
sequentially used when linear replacement occurs, and that even when the linear<br>
replacement is canceled, information associated with a block in the spare area<br>
replacing a corresponding defect block is maintained. When only a region<br>
recording an FRM bit and the first sector number of a replacement block is used to<br>
maintain information associated with he replaced sector number of the spare area,<br>
it is not possible to tell if the corresponding replaced block has again been replaced<br>
on account of a defect or if the linear replacement has been canceled to record real<br>
time data.<br>
In order to solve such a problem, a canceled linear replacement (CLR) flag is<br>
newly defined by using a spare bit of :he SDL entry which is not in use. When linear<br>
replacement with respect to a corresponding SDL entry is canceled for recording<br>
real time data, a method of setting the CLR flag as "1" can be used. Here, when the<br>
CLR flag is set as "0", it indicates a replacement block allocated without being used<br>
by real time data. In the structure of an SDL entry of FIG. 10, for example, a bit b31<br>
not in use is used as the CLR flag.<br><br>
Meanwhile, defect management information for recording real time data can<br>
be roughly divided into three cases in which: (1) real time data is not recorded on<br>
the entire disc; (2) two types of data, i.e., real time data and non-real time data,<br>
coexist on a disc, and a linear replacement defect managing method is not used<br>
with respect to only the real time data; and (3) only the real time data is recorded in<br>
the entire disc, i.e., the linear replacement defect managing method is not used with<br>
respect to all recorded data.<br>
Particularly, in the third case, real time replacement is not used for the entire<br>
disc, so that a spare area for defect management can be set to a smaller size than<br>
in the first and second cases. This will be described in detail later referring to FIGS.<br>
12 and 13.<br>
When these three or more defect managing methods are applied to one disc,<br>
various correspondences are possible accord ng to the purpose of use of a disc,<br>
and the disc can be more effectively used. However, considering a condition such<br>
as the case of changing and using discs between reproduction apparatuses, the<br>
defect management conditions in which a corresponding disc is used must be<br>
described in more detail. 1-bit disc defect management mode information<br>
representing use or non-use of linear replacement described in FIG. 8 is deficient<br>
for defect management information in the above case.<br>
Thus, as shown in FIG. 11, defect management mode information capable of<br>
representing linear replacement or non-linear replacement depending on a plurality<br>
of different defect management modes is stored in a reserved byte located in the<br>
DDS of the defect management area DMA) on a disc. That is, FIG. 11 shows the<br>
case of using two significant bits b7 and b6 of the relative byte position BP10 of<br>
DDS, i.e., the eleventh byte thereof, by taking defect management (DM) mode<br>
depending on use or non-use of linear replacement as an example.<br>
As shown in FIG. 11, when the DM mode information is "00b", it indicates that<br>
the slipping replacement and the linear replacement are applied to all data on a<br>
disc, when the DM mode information s "01b", it indicates that the linear replacement<br>
is selectively applied according to the type of information (here, real time data and<br>
non-real time data), and when the DM mode information is "10b", it indicates that the<br>
linear replacement is not used with respect to every data.<br><br>
That is, when the DM mode information is "00b", the slipping replacement<br>
and the linear replacement are mandatory, and this mode is only for data other than<br>
real time data in the first case described above. When the DM mode information is<br>
"01b", the linear replacement is mandatory, but the linear replacement for real time<br>
data is optional. This mode is defect management for a hybrid disc including both<br>
real time data and non-real time data in the second case described above. When<br>
the DM mode information is "10b", only the slipping replacement is allowable, and<br>
this mode is defect management for only real data in the third case described<br>
above. When the DM mode information is "10b", the physical layout of a disc can<br>
be changed.<br>
Meanwhile, since linear replacement cannot be used to record real time data,<br>
a spare area necessary for linear replacement does not actually become necessary.<br>
For this case, in the present invention, only a spare area for slipping replacement is<br>
set in the last group without allocating a spare area for linear replacement as shown<br>
in FIG. 12. In particular, the spare area set in the last group (here, a thirty fourth<br>
group) allocates 7680 sectors (480 ECC blocks) to a spare area for slipping<br>
replacement to process a maximum of 7679 entries capable of being registered in a<br>
primary defect list (PDL). In FIG. 12, sect denotes a sector, blk denotes block, and<br>
rev denotes revolutions.<br>
In order to obtain the compatiDility between the present invention and an<br>
existing defect management structure, a flag, capable of discriminating a case in<br>
which spare areas for only slipping replacement are allocated only for real time<br>
recording from a case in which spare areas for linear replacement and slipping<br>
replacement are allocated according to an existing defect management method, is<br>
represented with significant bits b7 and b6 of the relative byte position BP 10 in the<br>
DDS and the PDL, as shown in FIG. 13.<br>
As shown in FIG. 13, when two significant bits b7 and b6 representing a DM<br>
mode on the byte position BP 10 of he DDS/PDL are "00b", it indicates that an<br>
existing defect managing method is applied, and when the two significant bits b7<br>
and b6 are "10b", a defect managing method for only real time recording without<br>
linear replacement, in which only the spare a-ea for slipping replacement is<br>
allocated in the last group of a disc, is applied. Thus spare areas are allocated by<br><br>
a method dedicated for real time recording, thereby increasing the efficiency due to<br>
the application of the space of a disc.<br>
As described above, while compatibility between a method of the present<br>
invention and a defect managing method based on the current DVD-RAM standard<br>
is maintained, linear replacement is not perfo-med when real time data is recorded.<br>
Thus, real time data can be recorded and reproduced.<br>
In the present invention, information representing a plurality of different<br>
defect management modes depending on the type of data to be recorded is stored,<br>
so that various correspondences are possible according to the purpose of use of the<br>
recording medium. Thus, the recorcing medium can be more effectively used.<br>
Also, in the present invention when real time data is recorded, spare areas<br>
are allocated to be used for only reel time. Thus, the effectiveness due to the<br>
application of the space of a disc can be increased.<br><br>
