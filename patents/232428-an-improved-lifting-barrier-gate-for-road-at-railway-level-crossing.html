				<td>This invention relates to an improved lifting barrier gate for road at railway level crossing.<br>
The conventional barrier for a road at a railway crossing is in the form of a pole or post pivoted near one of its ends and adapted to move in a vertical plane. The pivot is provided on a support on one side of the road, a counterweight is fixed to the end of the pole or post extending beyond said support away from the road. Normally the barrier will remain vertical extending upwardly with the counterweight disposed downwardly. A mechanism is provided to lower the barrier to its horizontal position for closing the road traffic. The mechanism comprises a rotatably mounted drum fixed to the same shaft on which the barrier rotates. The said drum is rotated by means of a wire rope or cable passing over the said drum. Said rope is connected to a operating system consisting of gears and pulleys through an other drum having a handle for its operation.<br>
When the drum, mounted on the said shaft having an extending knob, is rotated it pull down shorter arm of the pole or barrier from its horizontal position, that the road is cleared from traffic. For closing the traffic along the road the said arrangement is rotated in the direction opposite to the earlier direction of its rotation, so that the said pole or post is brought to its horizontal position.<br>
The barrier operating mechanism is costly and the maintenance thereof is very difficult as it requires a number of gears and therefore more effort and time is required to lower or raise the barriers as the reduction gear ratio is high.<br>
Therefore, the main object of this invention is to provide a closed circuit double/triple inter-locked lifting barrier used at a railway level crossing, road or gate which goes not require any gear wheel arrangement in its operational mechanism.<br>
Another object of this invention is to control rail and road traffic by providing clockwise and anticlockwise closed circuit double/triple interlocking between three main components/attachments i.e. barriers, rail side stop signals with over shooting arm and road side stop/traffic control signals, through a system of three main wire rope closed circuits so that there is at any time only one wire rope circuit is free for operation and other two/at least one wire rope circuit are/is always in locked position and there is interlocking between every paid of these closed circuits, through and arrangement of pulleys, winch operational handle, rail and road side operational levers, attached to respective wire rope circuits operated in a set sequence which can be reversed as required by operator.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved lifting barrier gate for road at railway level crossing comprising of a pair of booms (Bi, Ba; 82, 84) adapted to move into horizontal and vertical position being pivoted to respective post, other end of boom (Ba, B4) is provided with counterweights (Wi, W2) secured therewith, characterized in that a plurality of closed loops of ropes (Ci, Ca, Ca and C4) passing over a plurality of respective pulleys (Pi-Pe, Py-Pie, Pi7-P2s) being provided for operating booms, rail side and road side traffic control signals, interlocking means (Li, La) are provided for operating road side signals, unlocking/locking winch drum (Da) and for operation of rail side signal through respective rope wherein centre of each boom is connected to rope of the drum (Da) operated by means of a handle (H) in which the levers are connected to respective closed rope loop (Ca and Ci} so as to operate other closed rope loop (Ci and Co] in a set sequence to lock/unlock winch wheel(T), front end of the booms in horizontal position and back ends of said booms and operate said road and rail side signals.<br>
In accordance with this invention a plurality of pulleys are provided in the vertical as well as horizontal on either side of the railway track and road so as to provided closed circuits of the wire rope for operating the booms and lever/crank locks provided on either<br>
side of the railway track and road for interlocking means by respective rail and/or road side wire rope circuits/runs. With booms locking booms at winch drum/operation and either ends of boom. The booms are pivotally secured to the posts and are adapted to be operated in the desired horizontal or vertical position in a vertical plain by moving the closed circuit of wire rope by operating the winch handle in. the clockwise or anti-clockwise direction by means of operating this handle. Similarly, the interlocking means are operated by operating the respective circuit of wire rope by means of respective operating lever/handle.<br>
A close circuit double/triple interlocked lifting barrier gates according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows plan of the pulleys and ropes with attachments and arrangements;<br>
Fig. 2A shows: Reversed position of Lever L2 Fig. 2B shows: Normal position of Lever L2<br>
With reference to the drawing, particularly fig. 1 booms Bl and B2 are secured<br>
to the rope through the respective drum Dl and D2 supported on the respective<br>
posts provided at the end of the shorter arms B3 and B4 of the booms Bl, B2<br>
and are extending beyond the drums Dl and D2. Pulleys PI to P6 are rotatable<br>
pulleys and provided to support the rope Cl, which is rotatable. Pulleys P7 and<br>
P16 are provided to support the second rope C2 provided to operate the<br>
interlocking means by means of an operating lever L2, so as to lock the winch<br>
and confirm advance lock-at front end of the horizontal booms Bl and B2 and<br>
operate rail side stop-cum-overshooting signal arm provided on either side and<br>
allow rail traffic. Similarly, pulley PI7 to P25 are provided to support the third<br>
rope	<br>
C3 provided to operate other interlocking means through an operating lever LI to lock the winch operation and back end of the booms Bl and B2 having counter weights Wl and W2 secured therewith and operate the road side stop/traffic control signal provided on either side. Winch means having winch drum D3 provided with winch rope C4, chain wheels W3 and W4 and an operational handle H secured to chain wheel W4 so as to operate the rope Cl as and when required by the operator. Lever LI and L2 are connected with the respective rope C3 and C2 so as to move the respective rope C3 and C2 to lock winch operation and for locking of vertical boom or to confirm advance locking of horizontal boom B1 and B2 and operate rail or road side traffic control signals as and when required. The locking means comprises lever LI and L2 secured to the respective rope provided thereon comprising a rope C2 and C3 respectively. Locking lever/cranks are secured with the ropes C3 and C2 to lock winch and respective ends of the booms. Here, for sequence of operation, rope Cl through rope C4 is operated in the middle of other two ropes C2 and/or C3 and sequence of operations can be reversed as required. A winch wheel (T) is in connection with a rod (R) for locking and unlocking of the winch wheel.<br>
During the operation of barriers gate and when the winch handle H is rotated clockwise, the rope or cable moves the respective pulleys, and booms Bl and B2 come to horizontal position and thus the road traffic to cross the rail track is stopped. Similarly, when the winch handle H is rotated in the anti-clockwise direction the rope moves on the same pulleys and the booms come to vertical position and traffic on the road is open to cross the railway track. Levers LI and L2 are operated in the manner as shown in the drawings 2A and 2B so as to lock winch, confirm advance locking of front end of horizontal boom and/or back end of the booms Bl and B2, operate respective rail or road side traffic control signals/system and also over shooting arm to control rail traffic.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
