				<td>The present invention relates to an azabicyclo-indazole compound.<br>
This application claims the benefit of application Serial No. 60/530,891, filed December 22, 2003, and application Serial No. 60/606,897, filed September 3, 2004, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates generally to the field of ligands for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR), activation of nAChRs, and the treatment of disease conditions associated with defective or malfunctioning nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, especially of the brain. Further, this invention relates to novel compounds, for example, indoles, lH-indazoles, 1,2-benzisoxazoles, and 1,2-benzisothiazoles, which act as ligands for the Î±7 nAChR subtype, methods of preparing such compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of use thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
There are two types of receptors for the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine: muscarinic receptors and nicotinic receptors, based on the selectivity of action of muscarine and nicotine, respectively. Muscarinic receptors are G-protein coupled receptors. Nicotinic receptors are members of the ligand-gated ion channel family. When activated, the conductance of ions across the nicotinic ion channels increases.<br>
Nicotinic alpha-7 receptor protein forms a homo-pentameric channel in vitro that is highly permeable to a variety of cations (e.g., Ca14). Each nicotinic alpha-7 receptor has four transmembrane domains, named M1, M2, M3, and M4. The M2 domain has been suggested to form the wall lining the channel. Sequence alignment shows that nicotinic alpha-7 is highly conserved during evolution. The M2 domain that lines the channel is identical in protein sequence from chicken to human. For discussions of the alpha-7<br>
receptor, see, e.g., Revah et al. (1991), Nature, 353, 846-849; Galzi et al. (1992), Nature 359,500-505; Fucile et al. (2000), PNAS 97(7), 3643-3648; Briggs et al. (1999), Eur. J. Pharmacol. 366 (2-3), 301-308; and Gopalakrisbnan et al. (1995), Eur. J. Pharmacol 290(3), 237-246.<br>
The nicotinic alpha-7 receptor channel is expressed in various brain regions and is believed to be involved in many important biological processes in the central nervous system (CNS), including learning and memory. Nicotinic alpha-7 receptors are localized on both presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals and have been suggested to be involved in modulating synaptic transmission. It is therefore of interest to develop novel compounds, which act as ligands for the o7 nAChR subtype, for the treatment of disease conditions associated with defective or malfunctioning nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to novel compounds, which act as ligands for the a7 nAChR subtype, methods of preparing such compounds, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of use thereof.<br>

Preferred aspects include pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, optionally, another active agent as discussed below; a method of stimulating or activating inhibiting alpha-7 nicotinic receptors, e.g., as determined by a conventional assay or one described herein, either in vitro or in vivo (in an animal, e.g., in an animal model, or in a mammal or in a human); a method of treating a neurological syndrome, e.g., loss of memory, especially long-term memory, cognitive impairment or decline, memory impairment, etc. method of treating a disease state modulated by nicotinic alpha-7 activity, in a mammal, e.g., a human, e.g., those mentioned herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be prepared conventionally. Some of the known processes that can be used are described below. All starting materials are known or can be conventionally prepared from known starting materials.<br>
The synthesis of similar compounds is disclosed in copending application Serial No. 10/669,645, filed September 25,2003, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Acids that can be used in the preparation of the bicyclobase amide are commercially available, can be prepared by known procedures described in the literature, or as described below. For example, indazole-3-carboxylic acid is commercially available. Bromoindazole acids can be prepared from the corresponding isatins by basic hydrolysis, diazotization, and reduction [Snyder, H.R.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1952, 74, 2009], Benzisoxazole-3-carboxylic acid can be prepared from 2,5-dibromonitrobenzene by reaction with diethylmalonate, saponification with decarboxylation, followed by re-esterification, reaction with isoamyl nitrite under basic conditions, hydrogenolysis, and saponification [Angell, R.M.; Baldwin, I.R.; Bamborough, P.; Deboeck, N.M.; Longstaff, T.; Swanson, S. WO04010995A1]. 3-Benzisothiazolecarboxylic acid can be prepared from thiophenol by reaction with oxallyl chloride and aluminum chloride followed by treatment with hydroxylamine, hydrogen peroxide, and sodium hydroxide. Bicycloamines that can be used in the preparation of the bicyclobase amides are commercially available, can be prepared by known procedures described in the literature, or as described below. For example, (liS",4)S)-2-fert-butyloxycarbonyl-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane hydrochloride is commercially available. (liSyiiS^-methyl-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1]heptane can be prepared by the reduction of the terf-butyl carbamate with lithium aluminum hydride or by the sequence of reductive amination followed by deprotection. 2,5-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared as described in the literature (Newman, H. J. Heterocydic Chem. 1974, .Z7,449. Sturm, P.A.; Henry, D.W. J. Med. Chem. 1974,17,481). 2-Methyl-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane can be prepared from diethyl 2,5-diaminohexanedioate by cyclization of the N-benzyl<br>
intermediate, reduction of the tertiary amides, hydrogenolysis, selective protection, reductive amination and deprotection.<br>
The bicyclobase amide can be prepared by the coupling reaction of acids with Hie bicycloamine and HBTU or HOBt and EDCI in DMF, or by converting the acids to the corresponding acid chloride and then reaction with the bicycloamine (Macor, J.E.; Gurley, D.; Lanthorn, T.; Loch, J.; Mack, R.A.; Mullen, G.; Tran, O.; Wright, N.; and J. E. Macor, J.E. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001,9,319.). The couplings are generally performed at room temperatures for 4-8 hours. Thioamide analogs can be prepared from the amides by reaction with Lawesson's reagent (Wipf P.; Kim, Y.; Goldstein, D.M., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1995, 111, 11106). Bicyclobase methylenamine analogs maybe prepared from bicyclobase amides by standard reduction procedures as described, for example, below. The resultant adducts can be isolated and purified by standard techniques, such as chromatography or recrystallization, practiced by those skilled in the art.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that compounds of Formulas I-III can exist in different tautomeric and geometrical isomeric forms. All of these compounds, including cis isomers, trans isomers, diastereomic mixtures, racemates, nonracemic mixtures of enantiomers, substantially pure, and pure enantiomers, are within the scope of the present invention. Substantially pure enantiomers contain no more than 5% w/w of the corresponding opposite enantiomer, preferably no more than 2%, most preferably no more than 1%.<br>
The optical isomers can be obtained by resolution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional processes, for example, by the formation of diastereoisomeric salts using an optically active acid or base or formation of covalent diastereomers. Examples of appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltartaric, ditoluoyltartaric and camphorsulfonic acid. Mixtures of diastereoisomers can be separated into their individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical and/or chemical differences by methods known to those skilled in the art, for example, by chromatography or fractional crystallization. The optically active bases or acids are then<br>
liberated from the separated diastereomeric salts. A different process for separation of optical isomers involves the use of chiral chromatography (e.g., chiral HPLC columns), with or without conventional derivation, optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the enantiomers. Suitable chiral HPLC columns are manufactured by Diacel, e.g., Chiracel OD and Chiracel OJ among many others, all routinely selectable. Enzymatic separations, with or without derivitization, are also useful. The optically active compounds of Formulas I-III can likewise be obtained by utilizing optically active starting materials in chiral synthesis processes under reaction conditions which do not cause racemization.<br>
In addition, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the compounds can be used in different enriched isotopic forms, e.g., enriched in the content of 2H, 3H, 11C, 13C and/or 14C. In one particular embodiment, the compounds are deuterated. Such deuterated forms can be made the procedure described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997. As described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,846,514 and 6,334,997, deuteration can improve the efficacy and increase the duration of action of drugs.<br>
Deuterium substituted compounds can be synthesized using various methods such as described in: Dean, Dennis C.; Editor.

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts also include those in which the main compound functions as an acid and is reacted with an appropriate base to form, e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, ammonium, and choline salts. Those skilled in the art will further recognize that acid addition salts of the claimed compounds maybe prepared by reaction of the compounds with the appropriate inorganic or organic acid via any of a number of known methods. Alternatively, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts can be prepared by reacting the compounds of the invention with the appropriate base via a variety of known methods.<br>

amphakines NMDA-R modulators, mQluR modulators, dopamine modulators, serotonin modulators, canabinoid modulators, and cholinesterase inhibitors (e.g., donepezil, rivastigimine, and glanthanamine). In such combinations, each active ingredient can be administered either in accordance with their usual dosage range or a dose below their usual dosage range.<br>
The compounds of the invention can be used in conjunction with "positive modulators" which enhance the efficacy of nicotinic receptor agonists.  See, e.g., the positive modulators disclosed in WO 99/56745, WO 01/32619, and WO 01/32622. Such combinational therapy can be used in treating conditions/diseases associated with reduced nicotinic transmission.<br>

The compounds of the present invention are nicotinic alpha-7 ligands, preferably agonists, especially partial agonists, for the alpha-7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. Assays for determining nicotinic acetylcholine activity are known within the art. See, e.g., Davies, A.R., et al., "Characterisation of the binding of [3H]methyllycaconitine: a new radioligand for labelling alpha 7-type neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors," Neuropharmacology, 1999.38(5): p. 679-90. As agonists for a-7 nAChRs, the compounds are useful in the prophylaxis and treatment of a variety of diseases and conditions associated with the central nervous system. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors<br>
are ligand-gastrol ion-channel receptors that are composed of five subunit proteins that form a central ion-conducting pore. Presently, there are eleven known neuronal nAChR subunits (o2 - a9 and (32 - p4). There are also five further subunits expressed in the peripheral nervous system (al, pi, y, 8, &amp;).<br>
The nAChR receptor subtypes can be homopentameric or heteropentameric. The subtype which has received considerable attention is the homopentameric a? receptor subtype formed from five a7 subunits. The a7nAChRs exhibit a high affinity for nicotine (agonist) and for a-bungarotoxin (antagonist).  Studies have shown the a7-nAChR agonists can be useful in the treatment of psychotic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, and cognitive impairments, among other things. While nicotine is a known agonist, there is a need for the development of other a7-nAChR agonists, especially selective agonists that are less toxic or exhibit fewer side effects than nicotine.<br>
The compound anabaseine, i.e., 2-(3-pyridyl)-3,4,5,6-teti'ahydropyridine is a<br>
naturally occurring toxin in certain marine worms (nemertine worms) and ants. See, e.g.,<br>
Kern et al., Toxicon, 9:23,1971. Anabaseine is a potent activator of mammalian	,<br>
nicotinic receptors.  See, e.g., Kem, Amer. Zoologist, 25,99,1985. Certain anabaseine analogs such as anabasine and DMAS (3-[4-(dimethylamino)benzylidene]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2',35-bipyridine) are also known nicotinic receptor agonists. See, e.g., US 5,602,257 and WO 92/15306.  One particular anabaseine analog, (E-3-[2,4-dimethoxy-benzylidene]-anabaseine, also known as GTS-21 and DMXB (see, e.g., US 5,741,802), is a selective partial a7-nAChR agonist that has been studied extensively. For example, abnormal sensory inhibition is a sensory processing deficit in schizophrenics and GTS-21 has been found to increase sensory inhibition through interaction with ct7-nAChRs. See, e.g., Stevens et al., Psychopharmacology, 136: 320-27 (1998).<br>
Another compound which is known to be a selective a7-nAChR agonist is Tropisetron, i.e., loH, 5oH-tropan-3a-yl indole-3-carboxylate. See J. E. Macor et al., "The 5-HT3-Antagonist Tropisetron (ICS 205-930) is a Potent and Selective A7 Nicotinic Receptor Partial Agonist," Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001,319-321).<br>
Agents that bind to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors have been indicated as useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of various diseases and conditions, particularly psychotic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases involving a dysfunction of the cholinergic system, and conditions of memory and/or cognition impairment, including, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety, mania, depression, manic depression [examples of psychotic disorders], Tourette's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease [examples of neurodegenerative diseases], cognitive disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, memory impairment, memory loss, cognition deficit, attention deficit, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), and other uses such as treatment of nicotine addiction, inducing smoking cessation, treating pain (i.e., analgesic use), providing neuroprotection, treating jetlag, inflammation, or sepsis. See, e.g., WO 97/30998; WO 99/03850; WO 00/42044; WO 01/36417; Holladay et al., J.Med. Chem., 40:26,4169-94 (1997); Schmitt et al., Annual Reports Med. Chem., Chapter 5,41-51 (2000); Stevens et al., Psychopharmatology, (1998) 136: 320-27 (1998); and Shytle et al., Molecular Psychiatry, (2002), 7, pp. 525-535.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the invention, there is provided a method of treating a patient, especially a human, suffering from psychotic diseases, neurodegenerative diseases involving a dysfunction of the cholinergic system, and conditions of memory and/or cognition impairment, including, for example, schizophrenia, anxiety, mania, depression, manic depression [examples of psychotic disorders], Tourette's syndrome, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease [examples of neurodegenerative diseases], and/or cognitive disorders (such as Alzheimer's disease, Lewy Body Dementia, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, memory impairment, memory loss, cognition deficit, attention deficit, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) comprising administering to the patient an effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I-III.<br>

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Ap peptides derived therefrom, e.g., Api_42 . and other fragments, are known to be involved in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease. The Apuz peptides are not only implicated in neurotoxicity but also are known to inhibit cholinergic transmitter function. Further, it has been determined that Ap peptides bind to a-7 nAChRs. Thus, agents that block the binding of the Ap peptides to a-7 nAChRs are useful for treating neurodegenerative diseases. See, e.g., WO 99/62505. In addition, stimulation a-7 nAChRs can protect neurons against cytotoxicity associated with Ap peptides. See, e.g., Kihara, T. et al., Ann. Neurol., 1997, 42, 159.<br>
Thus, in accordance with an embodiment of the invention there is provided a method of treating and/or preventing dementia in an Alzheimer's patient which comprises administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound according to Formulas I-ni to inhibit the binding of an amyloid beta peptide (preferably, APM2) with nAChRs, preferable a-7 nAChRs, most preferably, human a-7 nAChRs (as well as a method for treating and/or preventing other clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease that include, but are not limited to, cognitive and language deficits, apraxias, depression, delusions and other neuropsychiatric symptoms and signs, and movement and gait abnormalities).<br>

The following bases were prepared using this method: 2-Methyl-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octanedihydrochloride.<br>
Synthetic Procedures:<br>
The following procedures (A-G) detail the preparation of the substituted bicyclobase derivatives.<br>
Procedure A:<br>
Procedure A provides a method for the coupling between bicyclobases and carboxylic acids to form carboxamide derivatives.<br>
To a solution of carboxylic acid (1 mmol) in tetrahydrofuran (10 mL) and N,N-dimethylformamide (1 mL) was added ^Mdiisopropylethylamine (3 mmol) and bicyclobase amine dihydrochloride (1 mmol). The reaction mixture was maintained at room temperature for 30 min under nitrogen and then HATU (1.00 mmol) was added. After 18 h, the reaction mixture was partitioned between saturated aqueous potassium carbonate solution and 95/5 dichloromethane/methanol. The aqueous layer was extracted with 95/5 dichloromethane /methanol (2X), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated in vacua. The residue was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography using a mixture of [90/10/1 dichloromethane /methanol/ammonium hydroxide] as the eluent, thus providing the carboxamide product.<br>

Procedure B:<br>
Procedure B provides a method for the coupling between brominated and iodinated bicyclobase carboxamides and boronic acids to form aryl-substituted or heteroaryl substituted derivatives.<br>
In a 5 mL microwave reaction vessel was added brominated bicyclobase carboxamide (0.3 mmol), boronic acid (0.6 mmol), tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium (0) (0.03 mmol), tri-tert-butylphosphine tetrafluoroborate (0.06 mmol), and potassium carbonate (0.8 mmol). The vessel was evacuated, back-filled with argon gas, and the contents diluted with ^//-dimethylformamide (5,0 mL). The vessel was sealed and subjected to microwave irradiation at 200 Â°C for 600 s. The contents of the reaction were filtered through Celite (methanol wash) and loaded on a 5 g SCX column. The column was washed with methanol (50 mL) and the product was ehrted with 2 M ammonia in methanol and concentrated. The residue was purified by chromatography [1/1 to 0/1 ethyl acetate/(70/30/l ethyl acetate/methanol/ammonium hydroxide)] followed by preparative HPLC using an 8 ruin gradient of 95/5 to 20/80 water (0.1% formic acid)/acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid), thus providing the heteroaryl-substituted product.<br>

Procedure D provides a method for the demethylation of methoxy-substituted indazole bicyclobase amides to form phenol derivatives and the subsequent reaction of the phenol with various alkylating agents.<br>
The methoxy indazole bicyclobase amide (6.98 mmol) was diluted with dichloromethane (60 mL) and dichloroethane (15 mL) and the solution was cooled to -78 Â°C. A 1.0 M solution of boron tribromide in dichloromethane (35 mmol) was added dropwise over 30 min. The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to room temperature and was maintained for 20 h. An additional aliquot of boron tribromide in dichloromethane (6 mmol) was added and the reaction was maintained for an additional 16 h. The reaction<br>
was slowly quenched with MeOH (30 mL) and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by chromatography using a dichloromethane/methanol (90/10) followed by elution with a mixture of dichloromethane/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (90/10/1) to provide the phenol (54%) as a brown solid. The phenol (0.734 mmol) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (10 mL) and was treated with potassium carbonate (1.46 mmol) and the alkyl bromide (0.95 mmol). The reaction was maintained for 16 h at ambient temperature and was filtered and concentrated to dryness. The residue was purified by preparative HPLC using an 8 min gradient of 95/5 to 20/80 water (0.1% formic acid)/acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid), thus providing the ether product.<br>
