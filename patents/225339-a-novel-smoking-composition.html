A NOVEL SMOKING COMPOSITION<br>
ARIF ABDUL KADER FAZLANI,<br>
an Indian National of "Nirmal", 21sl floor, Nariman Point, Mumbai 400 021 Maharashtra, India<br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED:-<br><br><br>
This invention relates to a novel smoking composition.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a smoking composition and a'beedi' having the smoking composition wrapped therein.<br>
Beedies are essentially a legacy of Indian Culture. They are known to exist for nearly a<br>
century now.<br>
The manufacturing of beedies, consists of two raw materials :-<br>
Smoking composition and<br>
Tendu leaves {Diospyros exsculpto)<br>
Tendu leaves also known as Diospyros exsculpto are grown in far flung places of Central India. Tendu is one of the most important non-wood forest produces of Chhattisgarh and every year, it provides good income to both Tendu leaves collectors and the government. These valuable leaves are used for wrapping beedis, popular smoke of Indians.<br>
What is envisaged in accordance with this invention is a smoking composition, which does not contain a significant quantity of tobacco and a beedi made containing the novel smoking composition of this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The harmful effects of smoking and particularly smoking tobacco compositions are well known.<br>
Many approaches have been made for finding alternatives to the use of tobacco in smoking.<br>
First, approach was to find an alternate to smoking.<br>
At present there are several consumer products that help people overcome their addiction to<br>
nicotine found in all tobacco related products. One type of product includes a transdermal<br>
2<br><br>
patch, which allows the person's body to slowly absorb a prescribed amount of nicotine over a given period.<br>
This approach is susceptible to abuse, and users are known to become addicted to the use of gum, patches or the like, and not to decrease nicotine intake as instructed.<br>
Another approach is to form a chewing gum containing nicotine. Thus, whenever a smoker has the urge to smoke, the smoker will chew the gum instead. However, the smoker still has to restrict the use of the gum in a manner that will eventually overcome the addiction.<br>
Orally ingested materials, including gums, have a bad taste, may lead to mouth ulcers, heartburn and other adverse consequences, and are highly dependent of the user following a specific regime.<br>
Devices and methods involving nicotine therapy all necessarily depend on the use of nicotine, the substance causing addiction, to control nicotine craving or desire. In addition, users are known to concurrently use both tobacco, as in cigarettes, and nicotine therapy aids, such as gum or patches, thereby increasing the total intake of nicotine. Further, in such instances acute adverse medical consequences may result, including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure and other conditions associated with nicotine administration.<br>
There are therefore substantial limitations and drawbacks to the various methods of nicotine-replacement therapy in current use. Other forms of oral administration can result in nausea, unpredictable nicotine blood levels and the like.<br>
Secondly, attempts have been made to remove certain components by filtration of the smoke through a material such as paper or cellulose acetate filaments. This happens to be one of the commonly used techniques but although the harmful effects are reduced they are still significant.<br><br>
3 <br>
The third approach deals with a substitute for a portion of the tobacco with a material which yields a smoke containing a lower amount of undesirable components than the amount of components in a comparable quantity of tobacco smoke. Several patents have disclosed smoking materials following the third approach.<br>
For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,135,010 discloses use of nicotine-free herbal compositions, used either as a substitute for or in combination with tobacco. This smoking composition may include Laurus nobilis and Nelumbo garetin. The use of herbal preparations as aids in cessation of tobacco use is taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,045,825 and 6,063,401. These patents disclose use of herbs such as Plantago major, Piper methysticum and Hypericum perforatum.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 1,680,860 related to a smokeable tobacco substitute and process using eucalyptus, adding glycerine or honey or molasses. The leaves are air dried, crushed between rollers, macerated in KNO3 solution for three hours, drained and put in a pressure vessel at 100.degree.-200.degree. F. for three hours. The leaves are then compressed and heated up to 212.degree. F., then shredded as filler.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,576,021 teaches that it is known to use wood pulp to make a paper sheet and soak with tobacco extract to make a tobacco substitute and relates to an improvement using fibres of bagasse preferably sugar cane bagasse for making the paper preferred over wood pulp, cotton linen, ramie, sisal and other similar fibres because it has a chemical composition similar to tobacco in respect to cellulose, gums, fats and waxes. The process involves washing the sheet and treating it with NaOH or other alkali.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,907,686 relates to a tobacco substitute, an elongated cylinder made by charring a piece of wood, to produce charcoal. The wood is charred in the absence of air at 250.degree-800.degree C. (4-6 hours). The product may include carrier for flavouring agent: charcoal, Fuller's earth, natural or activated clays; aromatic flavouring agent: natural or synthetic oils, e.g. vanilla, eucalyptus, octyl acetate, isoamyl isovalerate. A smoke-forming agent, preferably an edible solid or liquid, e.g. glycerol, glycerol monoacetate, may be added. Coal tar colours may also be added. Ash-forming agent may be from a high ash <br>
4  <br>
source or may result from soaking a low ash source with a solution of ash-producing inorganic salts, e.g., ZnCl2, Ca(OH)2, KOH or K2 CO3, MgO, Al2 O3. Coating agents, e.g. sugar solutions or hard gum or resin may also be used.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,369,551 relates to a tobacco substitute base found by extracting plant leaves with water or an organic solvent with many additives listed. Dried materials are toasted to a golden brown colour and treated with appropriate additives.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,461,879 relates to a tobacco substitute constituting oxidized cellulose in combination with a hydrated metal compound, for example magnesium citrate, hydrated alumina, calcium tartrate or magnesium sulfate. When hydrated metal compounds, for example magnesium sulfate or the other materials set forth in this patent are employed, the burning rate of the cellulose has been found to approach that of ordinary cured tobacco leaves and a more pleasant taste and aroma have been found to be produced in connection with the side stream and mainstream of the tobacco smoke. Furthermore, the resulting ash has been found to be more satisfactory.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,545,448 relates to a smoking material comprising a carbohydrate material, such as cellulose, which is thermally degraded at 100.degree.-250.degree. C. until a weight loss of at least 10% has occurred, the degradation taking place in the presence of a strong mineral acid catalyst or in the presence of a salt of such strong acid with a weak base. The patent indicates that especially useful carbohydrate materials include alpha-cellulose, cellulose derivatives such as methyl cellulose, various polysaccharides and various gums.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,638,660 relates to a tobacco substitute material prepared from fibrous wood pulp containing at least 90% of alpha- cellulose which is lightly beaten to certain specifications and is then formed into a sheet having a density of 12-35 pounds per cubic foot. The beaten fibrous wood pulp is, during the formation of the sheet, combined with certain combustion modifiers and certain burning sustainers. It is also stated that various flavors and humectants, as well as nicotine or other alkaloids, may be introduced into the sheet. It is further stated that ammonium compounds and various coloring agents may also be incorporated in the sheet.<br>
5<br><br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,965,911 discloses a tobacco substitute smoking material comprising an organic combustible material as a smoke-producing fuel, and protein. The organic combustible material may be a smoke-producing carbohydrate, such as alpha-cellulose, cellulose derivatives, sugars, starch, alginate, pectin, or natural gum.<br>
IN/ PCT/002/2035/ CHE discloses a smokable filler material comprising a non-combustible organic filler, a binder and a major organic combustible fuel material, a fruit material, wherein the said inorganic filler is in the range of 30-90% by weight of the dry materials and said fruit material is in the range of 10-30% by weight of the dry materials.<br>
All these earlier approaches in the third method have failed in two categories. In the first category are materials having an acceptable smouldering rate, but which fail to give any significant reduction in undesirable components and have poor taste.<br>
In the second category are materials which give some degree of reduction of harmful components when blended with tobacco in small percentages, but which have an undesirable taste and/or do not burn satisfactorily when used alone or in significant percentages in tobacco blends.<br>
However, over-use of inert fillers and other inorganic materials is known to cause self-extinguishing, impaired ash cohesion and dropped coals in cigarettes. High levels of inorganic fillers can also have an adverse effect on smoke taste either by causing atypical muffled burning or as a result of excessive mechanical entrainment of these materials into mainstream smoke.<br>
There is therefore a need to have a smoking composition which has reduced perceived negative aspects of the tobacco smoking and at the same time psychologically satisfies a beedi smoker by giving him the satisfaction of smoking a beedi with significantly lower quantities of tobacco with acceptable smouldering rates, satisfying smoke, acceptable and pleasant flavours and a desirable taste.<br>
6<br><br>
Hence, there has been sustained investigative effort to develop cigarette products and other manufactured smoking compositions which deliver smoke with a reduced content of toxic components, provide the same level of satisfaction and which can gradually help an individual to get rid of the habit.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a flavoured smoking material which yields a smoke having a substantially lower amount of undesirable components than tobacco smoke, while at the same time having an acceptable taste and smouldering rate.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a beedi containing a natural smoking material base exhibiting the aforesaid properties.<br>
Another object is to provide an alternative, natural, healthy material adapted for incorporation in a smoking composition as a substitute for tobacco.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to provide a smoking composition and a beedi which during use has a pleasant smell.<br>
Very important aspects of non-tobacco smoking materials are the aroma and flavour properties of their smokes, for it is mainly shortcomings in this area which have been detrimental to the success of the prior art materials.<br>
The present invention relates to a mixture of natural and other products that can be used as a healthy substitute for tobacco. The novel composition of the present invention also alleviates the addictive effects of nicotine, and provides an aid to quit smoking tobacco-related products.<br>
The present invention provides both an improved flavoured smoking material and a novel method for its preparation.<br>
7<br><br>
The present method deals with producing a natural smoking material, which avoids the various disadvantages mentioned earlier. Thus, the smoking material of the present invention incorporates and is based largely upon using cellulose-based materials from natural sources, which, in the prior art, have not met with great acceptability. Moreover, the present invention produces a smoking material, which has flavour, aroma and burn characteristics similar to those of natural tobacco.<br>
A principal feature of this invention is the use of bagasse as the smoking material mixed with other ingredients to provide a smoking composition and a filler for beedies having a good smouldering rate, pleasant taste, good aroma and all round satisfying smoking characteristics. The end result is the production of a cellulose-based tobacco substitute smoking material having acceptable burning and smoke characteristics.<br>
Bagasse is the refuse of sugar cane (Saccharum officinarum) from which the juice has been extracted.<br>
Sugar Cane is harvested when the sucrose content in the stems is 12-20%. At the sugar mill, the fresh stems are fed into a mechanical crusher / multi rolled steel crushers. Crushing is repeated several times. The solid waste that remains at the sugar mill after the crushing is called bagasse. Bagasse has a residual amount of sugar and chiefly comprises cellulosic fibres.<br>

This invention is for use in a smoking device called 'Beedi '<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF SMOKING COMPOSITION:<br>
The cellulosic material, (bagasse/ cellulose fibres/ drumsticks / Corn stalks/ wheat chaff) are cleaned and sterilized by manual and steam treatment and objectionable foreign particulate matter are removed.<br>
1)	The cellulosic material (8 - 12) Kg is sieved to remove dust particles.<br>
The storage drums are washed throughly with acetone to remove any flavour or smelf associated with flavours from earlier processing.<br>
2)	Before processing, the cellulosic material is once again sieved to remove any remaining<br>
traces of dust.<br>
3)	The cleaned and weighed cellulosic material are chopped to the size of about 0.3 to 5<br>
mm and are processed in a machine with measured quantity of humectant such as glycerine<br>
(0.9 - 1.2 Kg). The mixture is allowed to soak for three days.<br>
4)	After three days, weighed quantity of potassium nitrate (0.15 - 0.20 Kg) is dissolved in a 250-500 ml of boiling hot water and stirred well.<br>
5)	This solution is added to the glycerine treated cellulosic material of step-4 and mixed well in a machine.<br>
6)	In another container weighed quantity of preservative such as Sodium benzoate (0.12— 0.20Kg) is dissolved in 250 -500 ml of boiling hot water and stirred we}). This solution is<br>
12<br><br>
added to the glycerine-potassium nitrate processed cellulosic material of step-5 and mixed well in a machine<br>
7)	The chosen flavouring agent is shaken well and 600 ml to 800 ml of the suitable flavouring agent is added to the mixture of step 6. The mixture so obtained is stirred well in a machine.<br>
8)	A measured quantity of humectant such as propylene glycol (0.15 - 0.20Kg) is heated indirectly by placing the container on boiling hot water. This is followed by the addition of a measured quantity of vanilla powder (0.15 - 0.20Kg), which is dissolved thoroughly in the heated propylene glycol by stirring.<br>
9)	The mixture of step 8 is cooled and then added to the flavoured cellulosic material of step- 7 in a machine.<br>
All the steps from 5 to 9 are carried out and completed on the same day.<br>
The resultant smoking composition is packed in drums.<br>
The resultant composition is allowed to mature in drums for at least 8 days.<br>
10)	After this period the mixture is stirred with 400ml to 600ml more of the flavouring agent used earlier.<br>
11)	The smoking composition so produced is packed in air -tight containers to retain the flavour.<br>
It is ensured that the moisture content varies within the limits of 20% to 80%.<br>
The invention will now be described with respect to examples which in no way limit the<br>
nature and scope of this invention.<br>
Example-1<br>
1)	80.32 Kg of bagasse was sieved to remove dust particles. The drums were washed compulsorily with acetone to remove any flavour or smell associated with flavours from earlier processing.<br>
2)	Before processing the bagasse was once again sieved to remove any remaining traces of dust.<br>
3)	The cleaned and weighed bagasse fibres were chopped to the size of about 0.3 to 5 mm and were processed in a machine with of 8.03 Kg glycerine. The mixture was allowed to soak for three days.<br><br><br>
4)	After three days, 1.20 Kg of Potassium nitrate was dissolved in a 2500ml of boiling hot water and stirred well.<br>
5)	This solution was added to the glycerine treated bagasse of step-4 and mixed well in a machine.<br>
6)	In another container 1.20kg of Sodium benzoate was dissolved in 2500 ml of boiling hot water and stirred well. This solution was added to the glycerine-potassium nitrate processed bagasse of step-5 and mixed well<br>
7)	12000 ml citric acid (flavouring agent) was shaken well and added to the mixture of step 6. The mixture so obtained was stirred well in a machine.<br>
8)	2.0 Kg of Propylene glycol was heated indirectly by placing the container on boiling hot water. This was followed by the addition of a 1.20Kg of vanilla powder, which was dissolved thoroughly in the heated propylene glycol by stirring.<br>
9)	The mixture of step 8 was cooled and then added to the flavoured Bagasse of step- 7 in a machine.<br>
All the steps from 5 to 9 are carried out and completed on the same day.<br>
The resultant smoking composition was then packed in drums.<br>
The resultant composition was allowed to mature in drums for at least 8 days.<br>
10)	the mixture of step 9 was taken out of the drums, and was again mixed thoroughly with 6000ml more of the citric acid (flavouring agent) used earlier.<br>
11)	The smoking composition so produced is packed in air -tight pouches to retain the flavour.<br>
Example-2<br>
1)	65.0 Kg of bagasse was sieved to remove dust particles. The drums were washed compulsorily with acetone to remove any flavour or smell associated with flavours from earlier processing.<br>
2)	Before processing the bagasse was once again sieved to remove any remaining traces of dust.<br>
3)	The cleaned and weighed bagasse fibres were chopped to the size of about 0.3 to 5 mm<br>
and were processed in a machine with of 14.0 Kg glycerine. The mixture was allowed to<br>

METHOD OF MANUFACTURE OF THE BEEDIES:<br>
Beedies are conventionally manufactured as follows:<br>
a)	The Tendu leaves are cut to size and dipped in water to soften it.<br>
b)	The Tendu leaf is dried ,but left slightly moist, to enable for easier rolling of the beedi.<br>
c)	Then the beedi is rolled by hand filling approximately 0.38 gms of the above mentioned tobacco dust and leaves.<br>
d)	A tiny piece of surgical cotton is placed inside the beedi close to the edge from where the beedi is smoked to act like a filter.<br>
e)	Then the beedi is tied with a thin cotton thread.<br>
f)	Bundles of beedis (10 beedis in each bundle) are placed on trays with a wire mesh bottom with the larger end of the beedi facing downwards towards the wire mesh.<br>
g)	These trays are then placed over a heated tandoor at approx 50°C to 60°C.<br>
In accordance with this invention, beedies were manufactured in which instead of the<br>
tobacco dust or leaves, the smoking compositions of examples 1-15 were tried separately.<br>
The bundles of beedis (containing 300 beedies each) were then wrapped in plastic coated<br>
paper to retain the flavour inside the beedi. These were then placed in a card board cartons<br>
containing many such bundles.<br>
Then the packets were sealed with BOPP (biaxially oriented polypropylene) film in a<br>
packet-wrapping machine. This packaging ensured that the flavour was retained intact in<br>
the beedi.<br>
Typically, 10 such packs (containing 20 beedis each) were put in another outer pack.<br>
50 such outer packs were packed in one master carton (Containing a total of 10,000 beedis).<br>
Trials:<br>
The smoking compositions of eaxmples 1-15 and beedies made using the smoking compositions were given to various batches of smokers. Unanimously, all smokers were satisfied with the quality of the composition and beedies. In the process of smoking, the smoke generated had a pleasant fruity aroma unlike the smoke produced by the conventional smokers of smoking   composition and beedies. The ash produced was also<br>
21<br><br>
less smelly and there was over all on an average 10% less ash. Needless to say, inspite of having a satisfactory smoke, the smokers received less nicotine and less tar than they would otherwise receive by smoking conventional smoking compositions and beedies.<br>
Uses of the present invention:<br>
l)The invention therefore provides a flavoured composition for use as a tobacco substitute for aiding in the cessation of tobacco use.<br>
2)	A primary advantage of the present invention is that it provides a means for people to reduce their addiction for nicotine at relatively low cost and in a natural way having a placebo effect psychologically because they are not otherwise giving up the smoking habit.<br>
3)	The present invention therefore will attenuate the craving a person would normally experience when that person attempts to reduce their use of nicotine containing products or stop using such products altogether. At the same time the invention will strengthen the person's immune system allowing that person to stop smoking tobacco with very little effort.<br>
