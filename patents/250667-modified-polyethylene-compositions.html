Inventors:       Henry W. Yang<br>

FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to polyethylene compositions comprising an ethylene based polymer and a modifier, typically a liquid modifier. More particularly, the present invention relates to polyethylene compositions having improved properties such as flexibility, softness, clarity, tear resistance, low temperature impact resistance, and or processibility, without substantial loss in melting point or other properties while maintaining the molecular weight of the ethylene polymer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
For many polyolefin applications, including films and fibers, flexibility and softness combined with retention of properties at high end-use temperatures are desirable attributes. In other polyolefin applications, including those that involve injection molding and rotomolding fabrication techniques, toughness is a critical attribute, particularly low temperature toughness and impact resistance. A low melt viscosity (high melt flow rate) is advantageous for almost all polyolefin fabrication processes, because this reduces cycle time or allows for lower temperature and/or energy requirements.<br>
For polyethylene-type resins, the most common approach to improving flexibility and toughness is to lower the crystallinity (and therefore the density) by addition of comonomer. However, this typically also results in reduced melting points. Traditional approaches to achieve low melt viscosity are lowering the molecular weight and broadening the molecular weight distribution of the resin. However, both approaches can have detrimental effects on the final physical properties of the polyolefin article, such as lower puncture resistance or lower impact resistance. What is needed is a method to improve physical properties, such as flexibility and toughness, while simultaneously lowering melt viscosity. It would also be further advantageous in a fabrication environment be able to continuously vary these parameters to match changing needs, instead of choosing between discrete polyethylene types sold by density, melt index, and composition.<br>
Addition of a plasticizer or other amorphous substance to a polyolefin is one way to attempt to address these needs. Some patent disclosures directed to such an end are US 4,960,820; US 4,132,698; US 3,201,364; WO 02/31044; WO 01/18109 Al; and EP 0 300 689 A2. These disclosures are directed to polyolefins and elastomers blended with materials such as mineral oils which contain aromatic and/or other functional groups. Typically, addition of mineral oil also lowers the melt viscosity because the mineral oil itself has a viscosity well below that of the polyolefin.<br>
Addition of compounds like mineral oils tend to improve the flexibility of a polyolefin, which identifies such compounds as "plasticizers" under the commonly accepted definition; that is, a substance that improves the flexibility, workability, or distensibility of a plastic or elastomer. Mineral oils are also often used as extenders, as well as for other purposes, in polyolefins. However, use of these additive compounds typically does not preserve the optical properties (e.g., color and or transparency) of the polyolefin, among other things. The melting point of the polyolefin is also typically not preserved, which reduces the softening point and upper use temperature of the composition, hi addition, such additive<br><br>
compounds often have high pour points (greater than -20°C, or even greater than -10°C), which results in little or no improvement in low temperature toughness of the polyolefm.<br>
To improve the low temperature characteristics, it is customary to choose lower molecular weight, amorphous compounds as plasticizers. Low molecular weight compounds are also chosen for their low viscosity, which typically translates into lower melt viscosity and improved processibility of the polyolefm composition. Unfortunately, this choice often leads to other problems. For example, all or some of the additive can migrate to a surface and evaporate at an unacceptably high rate, which results in deterioration of properties over time. If the flash point is sufficiently low (e.g., less than 200°C), the compound can cause smoking and be lost to the atmosphere during melt processing. It can also leach out of the polyolefm and impair food, clothing, and other articles that are in contact with the final article made from the plasticized polyolefin. It can also cause problems with tackiness or other surface properties of the final article. What is needed is a compound which imparts superior low temperature properties while also exhibiting low migration, leaching, and/or evaporation behaviors.<br>
Another shortcoming of typical additive compounds is that they often contain a high (greater than 5 wt%) degree of functionality due to carbon unsaturation and/or heteroatoms, which tends to make them reactive, thermally unstable, and/or incompatible with polyolefins, among other things. Mineral oils, in particular, consist of thousands of different compounds, many of which are undesirable for use in polyolefins due to molecular weight or chemical composition. Under moderate to high temperatures these compounds can volatilize and oxidize, even with the addition of oxidation inhibitors. They can also lead to problems during melt processing and fabrication steps, including degradation of molecular weight, cross-linking, or discoloration.<br>
These attributes of typical additive compounds like mineral oils limit the performance of the final plasticized polyolefin, and therefore its usefulness in<br>
many applications. As a result, they are not highly desirable for use as modifiers for polyolefms. What is needed is a modifier that does not suffer from these deficiencies. Further, the modifier should improve the flexibility and toughness of the polyolefin, while maintaining its melting point. Ideally, the modifier has a low pour point, while still of sufficient molecular weight to avoid unacceptable exudation and extraction. It should also not contribute to deterioration of optical properties, surface properties, thermal stability, and or oxidative stability, and the like.<br>
It would be particularly desirable to modify polyolefms such as polyethylene by using a simple, non-functionalized compound such as a paraffin. However, it has been disclosed that aliphatic or paraffinic compounds would impair the properties of polyolefms, and was thus not recommended. (See, e.g., CHEMICAL ADDITIVES FOR PLASTICS INDUSTRY 107-116 (Radian Corp., Noyes Data Corporation, NJ 1987); WO 01/18109 Al).<br>
Other examples of polyolefins combined with plasticizers include: WO 2004/014998 which discloses blends of propylene based polymers with various non-functionalized plasticizers; WO 98/44041 which discloses plastic based sheet like material for a structure, especially a floor covering, which contains in a blend a plastic matrix comprising a chlorine free polyolefin or mixture of polyolefins and a plasticizer characterized in that the plasticizer is an oligomeric polyalphaolefin type substance; and US 4,536,537 which discloses blends of LLDPE (UC 7047), polypropylene (7522) and Synfluid 2CS, 4CS, or 6CS having a viscosity of 40 to 6.5 cSt at 100°F/38°C, however the Synfluid 4CS and 6CS are reported to "not work" (col 3, In 12).<br>

Certain mineral oils have been classified as Hydrocarbon Basestock Group I, II, or III by the American Petroleum Institute (API) according to the amount of saturates and sulfur they contain and their viscosity indices. Group I basestocks are solvent-refined mineral oils that contain the highest levels of unsaturates and sulfur, and low viscosity indices; they tend to define the bottom tier of lubricant performance. They are the least expensive to produce and currently account for the bulk of the "conventional" basestocks. Groups II and III basestocks are more highly refined (e.g., by hydroprocessing) than Group I basestocks, and often perform better in lubricant applications. Group II and III basestocks contain less unsaturates and sulfur than the Group I basestocks, while Group III basestocks have higher viscosity indices than the Group II basestocks do. Additional API basestock classifications, namely Groups IV and V, are also used in the basestock industry. Rudnick and Shubkin in Synthetic Lubricants and High-Performance Functional Fluids, Second edition (Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York, 1999) describe the five basestock Groups as typically being:<br>
Group I - mineral oils refined using solvent extraction of aromatics, solvent dewaxing, hydrofining to reduce sulfur content to produce mineral oils with sulfur levels greater than 0.03 weight %, saturates levels of 60 to 80 weight % and a Viscosity Index (VI) of about 90;<br>
Group II - mildly hydrocracked mineral oils with conventional solvent extraction of aromatics, solvent dewaxing, and more severe hydrofining to reduce sulfur levels to less than or equal to 0.03 weight % as well as removing double bonds from some of the olefmic and aromatic compounds, saturate levels are greater than 95-98 weight% and VI is about 80-120;<br>
Group HI - severely hydrotreated mineral oils with saturates levels of some oils virtually 100%, sulfur contents are less than or equal to 0.03 weight % (preferably between 0.001 and 0.01 weight%) and VI is in excess of 120;<br>
Group IV - "polyalphaolefins," which are hydrocarbon liquids manufactured by the catalytic oligomerization of linear alpha-olefms having 6 or more carbon atoms; in practice, however, this Group is generally thought of as synthetic basestock fluids produced by oligomerizing alpha-olefms have 4 or more carbons; and<br>
Group V - esters, polyethers, polyalkylene glycols, and includes all other basestocks not included in Groups I, II, III, and IV.<br>
Prior attempts of adding mineral oils to polyethylenes to modify properties involve for the most part addition of Group I and Group II mineral oils. Even in cases where the mineral oil is not identified by an API Group classification, such as the case for so-called "process oils," "technical white oils," "food grade oils," etc., such mineral oils are still readily categorized into two classes based on Viscosity Index alone: those with VI less than 120 (similar to Group I and Group II mineral oils), and those with VI of 120 or greater. Certain aspects of the present invention ideally pertain to substances with a VI of 120 or greater, which excludes Group I and Group II mineral oils and any other mineral oils with VI 
We have discovered that certain hydrocarbon modifiers (preferably certain liquids), preferably comprising branched paraffins, will advantageously plasticize polyethylene to improve physical properties of polyethylene and reduce its melt viscosity, without compromising melting point and resin molecular weight, and without suffering from the deficiencies typically obtained with mineral oils. Moreover, addition of these liquid hydrocarbon modifiers provides a means to change such properties on a continuous scale, based on real-time needs, which is typically not possible due to the availability of only discrete polyethylene grades. Furthermore, a different set of relationships between physical and thermal<br>
attributes is obtained, compared to those available from traditional polyethylenes of different densities and composition, which allows for new and advantageous properties of the fabricated articles.<br>

The ratio of C4 olefin isomers can vary by manufacturer and by grade, and the material may or may not be hydrogenated after synthesis. Commercial sources of polybutenes include BP (Indopol grades) and Infmeum (C-Series grades). When the C4 olefin is exclusively isobutylene, the material is referred to as "polyisobutylene" or PIB. Commercial sources of PIB include Texas Petrochemical (TPC Enhanced PIB grades). When the C4 olefin is exclusively 1-butene, the material is referred to as "poly-n-butene" or PNB.

The crystallinity of preferred ethylene polymers useful herein may be expressed in terms of heat of fusion. Embodiments of the present invention include polymers having a heat of fusion, as determined by DSC, ranging from a lower limit of 0.1 J/g, or preferably 1.0 J/g, to an upper limit of 260 J/g, or preferably 240 J/g,<br>
The crystallinity of the polymer may also be expressed in terms of crystallinity percent. The thermal energy for the highest order of polyethylene is<br>
estimated at 290 J/g. That is, 100% crystallinity is equal to 290 J/g. Preferably, the polymer has a crystallinity within the range having an upper limit of 80%, 60%, 40%, 30%, or 20%, and a lower limit of 1%, 3%, 5%, 8%, or 10%.<br>
The level of crystallinity may be reflected in the melting point. In one embodiment of the present invention, the ethylene polymer has a single melting point. Typically, a sample of ethylene copolymer will show secondary melting peaks adjacent to the principal peak, which are considered together as a single melting point. The highest of these peaks is considered the melting point. The polymer preferably has a melting point by DSC ranging from an upper limit of 150°C, 130°C, 100°C, SOT, or 60°C, to a lower limit of 0°C, 20°C, 25°C, 30°C, 35°C,40°C,or45°C.<br>

Blending and Processing<br>
The polymers suitable for use in the present invention can be in any physical form when used to blend with the modifier of the invention.   In one<br><br>
embodiment, reactor granules, defined as the granules of polymer that are isolated from the polymerization reactor prior to any processing procedures, are used to blend with the modifier of the invention. The reactor granules typically have an average diameter of from 50 /xm to 10 mm in one embodiment, and from 10 /im to 5 mm in another embodiment. In another embodiment, the polymer is in the form of pellets, such as, for example, having an average diameter of from 1 mm to 10 mm that are formed from melt extrusion of the reactor granules.<br>
The components of the present invention can be blended by any suitable means, and are typically blended to yield an intimately mixed composition which may be a homogeneous, single phase mixture. For example, they may be blended in a static mixer, batch mixer, extruder, or a combination thereof, that is sufficient to achieve an adequate dispersion of modifier in the polymer.<br>
The mixing step may involve first dry blending using, for example, a tumble blender, where the polymer and modifier are brought into contact first, without intimate mixing, which may then be followed by melt blending in an extruder. Another method of blending the components is to melt blend the polymer pellets with the modifier directly in an extruder or batch mixer. It may also involve a "master batch" approach, where the final modifier concentration is achieved by combining neat polymer with an appropriate amount of plasticized polymer that had been previously prepared at a higher modifier concentration. The mixing step may take place as part of a processing method used to fabricate articles, such as in the extruder on an injection molding machine or blown-film line or fiber line.<br>
In one aspect of the invention, the ethylene polymer and modifier are "melt blended" in an apparatus such as an extruder (single or twin screw) or batch mixer. The ethylene polymer may also be "dry blended" with the modifier using a tumbler, double-cone blender, ribbon blender, or other suitable blender. In yet another embodiment, the ethylene polymer and modifier are blended by a combination of approaches, for example a tumbler followed by an extruder. A<br><br>
preferred method of blending is to include the final stage of blending as part of an article fabrication step, such as in the extruder used to melt and convey the composition for a molding step like injection molding or blow molding. This could include direct injection of the modifier into the extruder, either before or after the polyethylene is fully melted. Extrusion technology for polyethylene is described in more detail in, for example, PLASTICS EXTRUSION TECHNOLOGY 26-37 (Friedhelm Hensen, ed. Hanser Publishers 1988).<br>
In another aspect of the invention, the polyethylene composition may be blended in solution by any suitable means, by using a solvent that dissolves both components to a significant extent. The blending may occur at any temperature or pressure where the modifier and the ethylene polymer remain in solution. Preferred conditions include blending at high temperatures, such as 10 °C or more, preferably 20 °C or more over the melting point of the ethylene polymer. Such solution blending would be particularly useful in processes where the ethylene polymer is made by solution process and the modifier is added directly to the finishing train, rather than added to the dry polymer in another blending step altogether. Such solution blending would also be particularly useful in processes where the ethylene polymer is made in a bulk or high pressure process where the both the polymer and the modifier were soluble in the monomer. As with the solution process the modifier is added directly to the finishing train, rather than added to the dry polymer in another blending step altogether.<br>
Thus, in the cases of fabrication of articles using methods that involve an extruder, such as injection molding or blow molding, any means of combining the polyethylene and modifier to achieve the desired composition serve equally well as fully formulated pre-blended pellets, since the forming process includes a re-melting and mixing of the raw material; example combinations include simple blends of neat polymer pellets and modifier, of neat polymer granules and modifier, of neat polymer pellets and pre-blended pellets, and neat polymer granules and pre-blended pellets. Here, "pre-blended pellets" means pellets of a polyethylene composition comprising ethylene polymer and modifier at some<br>
concentration. In the process of compression molding, however, little mixing of the melt components occurs, and pre-blended pellets would be preferred over simple blends of the constituent pellets (or granules) and modifier. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine the appropriate procedure for blending of the polymers to balance the need for intimate mixing of the component ingredients with the desire for process economy.<br>
Applications<br>
The enhanced properties of the polyethylene compositions described herein are useful in a wide variety of applications, including transparent articles such as cook and storage ware, and in other articles such as furniture, automotive components, toys, sportswear, medical devices, sterilizable medical devices and sterilization containers, nonwoven fibers and fabrics and articles therefrom such as drapes, gowns, filters, hygiene products, diapers, and films, oriented films, sheets, tubes, pipes and other items where softness, high impact strength, and impact strength below freezing is important.<br>

Use of at least thermoforming or film applications allows for the possibility of and derivation of benefits from uniaxial or biaxial orientation. Sufficient mixing should take place to assure that an intimately mixed, preferably uniform, blend will be produced prior to conversion into a finished product.<br>
Adhesives<br>
The polymers of this invention or blends thereof can be used as adhesives, either alone or combined with tackifiers. Preferred tackifiers are described above. The tackifier is typically present at about 1 weight % to about 50 weight %, based upon the weight of the blend, more preferably 10 weight % to 40 weight %, even more preferably 20 weight % to 40 weight %.

Films<br>
The compositions described above and the blends thereof may be formed into monolayer or multilayer films. These films may be formed by any of the conventional techniques known in the art including extrusion, co-extrusion, extrusion coating, lamination, blowing and casting. The film may be obtained by the flat film or tubular process which may be followed by orientation in an uniaxial direction or in two mutually perpendicular directions in the plane of the film. One or more of the layers of the film may be oriented in the transverse<br>
and/or longitudinal directions to the same or different extents. This orientation may occur before ,or after the individual layers are brought together. For example a polyethylene layer can be extrusion coated or laminated onto an oriented polypropylene layer or the polyethylene and polypropylene can be coextruded together into a film then oriented. Likewise, oriented polypropylene could be laminated to oriented polyethylene or oriented polyethylene could be coated onto polypropylene then optionally the combination could be oriented even further. Typically the films are oriented in the Machine Direction (MD) at a ratio of up to 15, preferably between 5 and 7, and in the Transverse Direction (TD) at a ratio of up to 15 preferably 7 to 9. However in another embodiment the film is oriented to the same extent in both the MD and TD directions.<br>

The films described above may be used as stretch and/or cling films. Stretch/cling films are used in various bundling, packaging and palletizing operations. To impart cling properties to, or improve the cling properties of, a particular film, a number of well-known tackifying additives have been utilized. Common tackifying additives include polybutenes, terpene resins, alkali metal stearates and hydrogenated rosins and rosin esters. The cling properties of a film can also be modified by the well-known physical process referred to as corona discharge. Some polymers (such as ethylene methyl acrylate copolymers) do not need cling additives and can be used as cling layers without tackifiers. Stretch/clings films may comprise a slip layer comprising any suitable polyolefin or combination of polyolefms such as polyethylene, polypropylene, copolymers of ethylene and propylene, and polymers obtained from ethylene and/or propylene copolymerized with minor amounts of other olefins, particularly C4 to C2 olefins.<br>
Particularly preferred is linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE). Additionally, the slip layer may include one or more anticling (slip and/or antiblock) additives which may be added during the production of the polyolefm or subsequently blended in to improve the slip properties of this layer. Such additives are well-known in the art and include, for example, silicas, silicates, diatomaceous earths, talcs and various lubricants. These additives are preferably utilized in amounts ranging from about 100 ppm to about 20,000 ppm, more preferably between about 500 ppm to about 10,000 ppm, by weight based upon the weight of the slip layer.

The molding processes are well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
The compositions described herein may be shaped into desirable end use articles by any suitable means known in the art. Thermoforming, vacuum forming, blow molding, rotational molding, slush molding, transfer molding, wet lay-up or contact molding, cast molding, cold forming matched-die molding, injection molding, spray techniques, profile co-extrusion, or combinations thereof are typically used methods.<br>
Thermoforming is a process of forming at least one pliable plastic sheet into a desired shape. An embodiment of a thermoforming sequence is described, however this should not be construed as limiting the thermoforming methods useful with the compositions of this invention. First, an extrudate film<br>
of the composition of this invention (and any other layers or materials) is placed<br>
on a shuttle rack,to hold it during heating.   The shuttle rack indexes into the<br>
oven which pre-heats the film before forming.   Once the film is heated, the<br>
shuttle rack indexes back to the forming tool. The film is then vacuumed onto<br>
the forming tool to hold it in place and the forming tool is closed. The forming<br>
tool can be either "male" or "female" type tools.  The tool stays closed to cool<br>
the film and the tool is then opened. The shaped laminate is then removed from<br>
the tool.   Thermoforming is accomplished by vacuum, positive air pressure,<br>
plug-assisted vacuum forming, or combinations and variations of these, once the<br>
sheet of material reaches thermoforming temperatures, typically of from 140°C<br>
to 185°C or higher. A pre-stretched bubble step is used, especially on large<br>
parts, to improve material distribution. In one embodiment, an articulating rack<br>
lifts the heated laminate towards a male forming tool, assisted by the application<br>
of a vacuum from orifices in the male forming tool. Once the laminate is firmly<br>
formed about the male forming tool, the thermoformed shaped laminate is then<br>
cooled, typically by blowers. Plug-assisted forming is generally used for small,<br>
deep drawn parts.    Plug material, design, and timing can be critical to<br>
optimization of the process. Plugs made from insulating foam avoid premature<br>
quenching of the plastic.  The plug shape is usually similar to the mold cavity,<br>
but smaller and without part detail. A round plug bottom will usually promote<br>
even   material   distribution   and   uniform   side-wall   thickness.       For   a<br>
semicrystalline polymer, fast plug speeds generally provide the best material<br>
distribution in the part.    The shaped laminate is then cooled in the mold.<br>
Sufficient cooling to maintain a mold temperature of 30 to 65°C is desirable.<br>
The part is below 90 to 100 °C before ejection in one embodiment. The shaped<br>
laminate is then trimmed of excess laminate material.<br>
Blow molding is another suitable forming means, which includes injection blow molding, multi-layer blow molding, extrusion blow molding, and stretch blow molding, and is especially suitable for substantially closed or hollow objects, such as, for example, gas tanks and other fluid containers. Blow molding is described in more detail in, for example, CONCISE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF<br>
POLYMER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (Jacqueline I. Kroschwitz, ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons 1990).<br>
In yet another embodiment of the formation and shaping process, profile co-extrusion can be used. The profile co-extrusion process parameters are as above for the blow molding process, except the die temperatures (dual zone top and bottom) range from 150 to 235°C, the feed blocks are from 90 to 250°C, and the water cooling tank temperatures are from 10 to 40°C.<br>
One embodiment of an injection molding process is described as follows. The shaped laminate is placed into the injection molding tool. The mold is closed and the substrate material is injected into the mold. The substrate material has a melt temperature between 180 and 300°C in one embodiment, and from 200 and 250 °C in another embodiment, and is injected into the mold at an injection speed of between 2 and 10 seconds. After injection, the material is packed or held at a predetermined time and pressure to make the part dimensionally and aesthetically correct. Typical time periods are from 5 to 25 seconds and pressures from 1,000 to 15,000 kPa. The mold is cooled between 10 °C and 70°C to cool the substrate. The temperature will depend on the desired gloss and appearance desired. Typical cooling time is from 10 to 30 seconds, depending on part on the thickness. Finally, the mold is opened and the shaped composite article ejected.<br>
Likewise, molded articles may be fabricated by injecting molten polymer blend into a mold that shapes and solidifies the molten polymer into desirable geometry and thickness of molded articles. A sheet may be made either by extruding a substantially flat profile from a die, onto a chill roll, or alternatively by calendering. Sheet will generally be considered to have a thickness of from 10 to 100 mils (254 to 2540 jam), although sheet may be substantially thicker. Tubing or pipe may be obtained by profile extrusion for uses in medical, potable water, land drainage applications or the like. The profile extrusion process involves the extrusion of molten polymer through a die. The extruded tubing or pipe is then solidified by chill water or cooling air into a continuous extruded<br>
articles. The tubing will generally be in the range of from 0.31 to 2.54 cm in outside diameter,'and have a wall thickness of in the range of from 254 (am to 0.5 cm. The pipe will generally be in the range of from 2.54 to 254 cm in outside diameter, and have a wall thickness of in the range of from 0.5 to 15 cm. Sheet made from the products of an embodiment of a version of the present invention may be used to form containers. Such containers may be formed by thermoforming, solid phase pressure forming, stamping and other shaping techniques. Sheets may also be formed to cover floors or walls or other surfaces.<br>
In an embodiment of the thermoforming process, the oven temperature is between 160°C and 195°C, the time in the oven between 10 and 20 seconds, and the die temperature, typically a male die, between 10°C and 71°C. The final thickness of,the cooled (room temperature), shaped laminate is from 10 jum to 6000 /im in one embodiment, from 200 jum to 6000 jLtm in another embodiment, and from 250 fim to 3000 /nm in yet another embodiment, and from 500 jum to 1550 jim in yet another embodiment, a desirable range being any combination of any upper thickness limit with any lower thickness limit.<br>
In an embodiment of the injection molding process, wherein a substrate material is injection molded into a tool including the shaped laminate, the melt temperature of the substrate material is between 190 and 255°C in one embodiment, and between 210 and 250°C in another embodiment, the fill time from 2 to 10 seconds in one embodiment, from 2 to 8 seconds in another embodiment, and a tool temperature of from 25°C to 65°C in one embodiment, and from 27°C and 60°C in another embodiment. In a desirable embodiment, the substrate material is at a temperature that is hot enough to melt any tie-layer material or backing layer to achieve adhesion between the layers.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the compositions of this invention may be secured to a substrate material using a blow molding operation. Blow molding is particularly useful in such applications as for<br>
making closed articles such as fuel tanks and other fluid containers, playground equipment, outdoor furniture and small enclosed structures.<br>
It will be understood by those skilled in the art that the steps outlined above may be varied, depending upon the desired result. For example, the an extruded sheet of the compositions of this invention may be directly thermoformed or blow molded without cooling, thus skipping a cooling step. Other parameters may be varied as well in order to achieve a finished composite article having desirable features.<br>
Test Methods Fluid Properties<br>
Pour Point is measured by ASTM D97.   Kinematic Viscosity (KV) is<br>
measured by ASTM D445. Viscosity index (VI) is determined by ASTM D2270. Color (APHA scale) is determined by ASTM D1209. Specific gravity is determined by ASTM D4052. Flash point is determined by ASTM D92.<br>
Saturates content (wt%) is determined according to ASTM D2007. Sulfur content (wt%) is determined according to ASTM D2622. The percent of carbons involved in olefinic bonds (i.e., olefinic carbons) is determined by liquid-state proton-NMR spectroscopy. Approximately 50 mg of fluid is dissolved in 1 g of deuterated chloroform, which is used as the NMR lock solvent. Relaxation times for the protons are on the order of a few seconds, allowing recycle delays of 6-10 seconds. Spectra are acquired at 30°C using an acquisition time of one hour, although an increase in temperature and acquisition time may yield marginal improvement in signal-to-noise. The fraction of olefinic carbons is determined by taking the ratio of olefinic carbons to the total number of carbons (olefinic + aliphatic). These, in turn, can be determined from the proton integrals after correction for the proton multiplicity of each carbon type. The olefms are grouped into four structures: vinyl, 1,2-disubstituted, trisubstituted, and vinylidene<br>
(1,1-disubstituted), which have three, two, one, and two protons, respectively. The approximate chemical shift ranges (bands) for these structures are tabulated below along with the number of protons contributed to that region by each olefin type:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The actual chemical shift range for each band may be slightly different from those listed above; appropriate integration limits are apparent from visual inspection of the spectrum by one skilled in the art. The concentration of each olefin type can be determined by dividing the integral for the relevant region by the proton multiplicity of the contributing olefin. The combined trisubstituted + vinyl region is corrected for vinyl content by subtracting twice the integral over 5.9-5.65 ppm and assigning the remainder to trisubstituted olefin. The aliphatic integral (from approximately 3 ppm to 0.5 ppm) is assumed to arise entirely from CH2 groups since the bulk of aliphatic carbons are in CHa groups and each aliphatic carbon in a CHs group is balanced by an aliphatic carbon in a CH group (on average). Dividing the aliphatic integral by two gives the number of aliphatic carbons. The sum of the olefin group concentrations times 100, divided by the sum of aliphatic and olefmic carbons, gives the olefin concentration as number of olefmic bonds per 100 carbons. Then multiplying this value by two gives the number of olefmic carbons per 100 carbons, or the percent of carbons involved in olefmic bonds.<br>
The number average molecular weight (Mn) is determined by gas chromatography (GC, described below), unless the kinematic viscosity at 100°C is greater than 10 cSt in which case it is determined by gel permeation chromatography (GPC, described below). The average carbon number (Cn) is calculated from Mn using the formula: Cn = (Mn - 2)/14.<br>
The principles of gas chromatography (GC) are described in "Modern Practice of Gas Chromatography", R.L. Grob and E.F. Barry, Wiley-Interscience, 3rd Edition (July 1995).   For the hydrocarbon modifiers of this invention, the correlation of chromatographic retention time and molecular weight is obtained by using a non-polar capillary GC column and linear hydrocarbon standards.   The sample is dissolved in pentane at a concentration of about 1 volume % to make the sample solution.    At least 5 linear hydrocarbon standards (chemical formula CnHn+2. molecular weight = 14*n + 2 g/mole) are dissolved in pentane (each at a concentration of 2 rng/mL) to make the standards solution.    The choice of standards is dictated by the molecular weight of the sample, as follows: at least one standard must elute before the sample and at least one standard must elute after the sample, while the other standards span between these two limits. The gas chromatograph is equipped with a flame-ionization detector and a 0.52-mm by 16-m fused-silica capillary column coated with 0.1-mm "G2" stationary phase (dimethylpolysiloxane gum). The carrier gas is helium flowing at a rate of about 10 mL/min.   Initially, the column is maintained at a temperature of 35°C, then immediately after injection, the temperature is increased at a rate of 5°C/min to a temperature of 50°C, then increased to 170°C at a rate of 12°C/min, then increased from 170°C to 310°C at a rate of 10°C/min, and maintained at 310°C for 18 minutes. The injection port temperature is maintained at about 35°C, and the detector temperature is maintained at about 320°C. About 2 \iL of the standards solution is injected into the chromatograph,  and the chromatogram (relative weight fraction as a function of elution time) is recorded; this process is repeated for each sample solution.   The peak elution times for the standards are used to create a calibration curve of molecular weight vs elution time.   This calibration curves is then applied to the sample chromatogram to determine the molecular weight distribution; Mn is the number-average molecular weight calculated from this distribution.<br>
The principles of gel permeation chromatography (GPC) are described in "Modern Size Exclusion Liquid Chromatographs", W.W. Yan, J.J. Kirkland, and<br>
D.D. Ely, J. Wiley &amp; Sons (1979). The specific protocol for the hydrocarbon modifiers of this.invention follows ASTM D3593. Mn is the number-average molecular weight calculated by applying the calibration curve (molecular weight vs elution time) established using polystyrene standards. The mobile phase is toluene; the column set is chosen to give a linear calibration curve over the entire elution range of interest for the sample(s); and the temperature of the GPC instrumentation is maintained at 35°C.<br>
Melt Index of Polymers and Polymer Blends<br>
The Melt Index (MI), is measured according to ASTM D1238 at 190°C, under a load of 2.16 kg unless otherwise noted. Another typical condition is 190°C and 21.6 kg load. The units for MI are g/10 min, or dg/min. Typically, a portion of the sample extruded during the test was collected and weighed. This is commonly referred to as the modification 1 of the experimental procedure. The analysis is conducted with a 1 minute preheat on the sample to provide a steady temperature for the duration of the experiment.<br>
Density of Polymers and Polymer Blends<br>
Density is measured by density-gradient column, as described in ASTM D1505, on a compression-molded specimen that has been slowly cooled to room temperature (i.e., over a period of 10 minutes or more) and allowed to age for a sufficient time that the density is constant within +/- 0.001 g/cm3. The units for density are g/crn3,<br>
Rheology of Polymers and Polymer Blends<br>
The dynamic shear viscosity as a function of frequency was determined by small- amplitude oscillatory shear rheology. A Rheometrics Scientific DSR-500 dynamic stress-controlled rheometer with a cone and plate sample fixture was used. Testing was performed at 190°C. Samples were subjected to an oscillatory<br>
shear stress at a nominal amplitude of 1 00 Pa by oscillating the upper cone at a fixed frequency, and the resultant strain was measured. The auto-stress adjustment capability was utilized to keep the strain within limits of 1-30% (stress adjustment setting = 32% of current stress, maximum stress = 100 Pa). These conditions ensure that each material was characterized within its linear viscoelastic region. The dynamic shear viscosity was calculated from the measured strain and applied stress as a function of frequency. Frequency sweeps were conducted starting at 500 rad/s and decreasing to 0.02 rad/s, using a logarithmic sweep mode with 6 points per decade.<br>
The dynamic shear viscosity versus frequency curves were fitted using the Cross model (see, for example, C.W. Macosco, RHEOLOGY: PRINCIPLES,<br>
MEASUREMENTS, AND APPLICATIONS, Wiley- VCH, 1994):<br>
The three parameters in this model are: r|o, the zero-shear viscosity; X, the average relaxation time; and n, the power-law exponent. The zero-shear viscosity is the value at a plateau in the Newtonian region of the flow curve at a low frequency, where the dynamic viscosity is independent of frequency. The average relaxation time corresponds to the inverse of the frequency at which shear-thinning starts. The power-law exponent describes the extent of shear-thinning, in that the magnitude of the slope of the flow curve at high frequencies approaches l-n on a log(r|*)-log(a)) plot. For Newtonian fluids, n =1 and the dynamic viscosity is independent of frequency. For the polymers of interest here, n 
Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)<br>
Crystallization temperature (Tc) and melting temperature (Tm) were measured using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC).    This analysis was<br><br>
conducted using either a TA Instruments MDSC 2920 or a Perkin Elmer DSC7. Typically, 6 to 10 mg of molded polymer or modified polyethylene composition was sealed in an aluminum pan and loaded into the instrument at room temperature. Melting data (first heat) were acquired by heating the sample to at least 30°C above its melting temperature at a heating rate of 10°C/min. This provides information on the melting behavior under as-molded conditions, which can be influenced by thermal history as well as any molded-in orientation or stresses. The sample was then held for 10 minutes at this temperature to destroy its thermal history. Crystallization data was acquired by cooling the sample from the melt to 25°C at a cooling rate of 10°C/min. The sample was then held at 25°C for 10 minutes, and finally heated at 10°C/min to acquire additional melting data (second heat). This provides information about the melting behavior after a controlled thermal history and free from potential molded-in orientation and stress effects. The endothermic melting transition (first and second heat) and exothermic crystallization transition were analyzed for onset of transition and peak temperature. The melting temperatures reported in the tables are the peak melting temperatures from the second heat unless otherwise indicated. For polymers displaying multiple peaks, the higher melting peak temperature is reported.<br>
Areas under the curve is used to determine the heat of fusion (AHf) which is then used to calculate the degree of crystallinity. A value of 290 J/g is used for the equilibrium heat of fusion for 100% crystalline polyethylene, so that the percent crystallinity is calculated using the formula, [% crystallinity = area under the curve (J/g) / 290 (J/g)] * 100.<br>
Size-Exclusion Chrornatographv of Ethylene Polvmer(s)<br>
Polymer molecular weight (weight-average molecular weight, Mw, and number-average molecular weight, Mn) and molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) are determined using Size-Exclusion Chromatography. Equipment consists of a High Temperature Size Exclusion Chromatograph (either from<br>
Waters Corporation or Polymer Laboratories), with a differential refractive index detector (DRI), an online light scattering detector, and a viscometer. Three Polymer Laboratories PLgel 10mm Mixed-B columns are used. The nominal flow rate is 0.5 cm3 /min, and the nominal injection volume is 300 [iL. The various transfer lines, columns and differential refractometer (the DRI detector) are contained in an oven maintained at 135°C. Solvent for the SEC experiment is prepared by dissolving 6 grams of butylated hydroxy toluene as an antioxidant in 4 liters of reagent grade 1,2,4 trichlorobenzene (TCB). The TCB mixture is then filtered through a 0.7 jam glass pre-filter and subsequently through a 0.1 um Teflon filter. The TCB is then degassed with an online degasser before entering the SEC.<br>
Polymer solutions are prepared by placing dry polymer in a glass container, adding the desired amount of TCB, then heating the mixture at 160 °C with continuous agitation for about 2 hours. All quantities are measured gravimetrically. The TCB densities used to express the polymer concentration in mass/volume units are 1.463 g/ml at room temperature and 1.324 g/ml at 135 °C. The injection concentration can range from 1.0 to 2.0 mg/ml, with lower concentrations being used for higher molecular weight samples.<br>
Prior to running each sample the DRI detector and the injector are purged. Flow rate in the apparatus is then increased to 0.5 ml/minute, and the DRI allowed to stabilize for 8-9 hours before injecting the first sample. The LS laser is turned on 1 to 1.5 hours before running samples.<br>
The concentration, c, at each point in the chromatogram is calculated from the DRI signal after subtracting the prevailing baseline, IDRI, using the following equation:<br>
where KDRI is a constant determined by calibrating the DRI, and (dn/dc) is the same as described below for the LS analysis. The processes of subtracting the prevailing<br>
baseline (i.e., background signal) and setting integration limits that define the starting and ending points of the chromatogram are well known to those familiar with SEC analysis. Units on parameters throughout this description of the SEC method are such that concentration is expressed in g/cm3, molecular weight is expressed in g/mole, and intrinsic viscosity is expressed in dL/g.<br>
The light scattering detector is a Wyatt Technology High Temperature mini-DAWN. The polymer molecular weight, M, at each point in the chromatogram is determined by analyzing the LS output using the Zimm model for static light scattering (M.B. Huglin, LIGHT SCATTERING FROM POLYMER SOLUTIONS, Academic Press, 1971):<br>
KOC<br>
Here, AR(6) is the measured excess Rayleigh scattering intensity at scattering angle 6, c is the polymer concentration determined from the DRI analysis, AZ is the second virial coefficient, P(0) is the form factor for a monodisperse random coil (described in the above reference), and KO is the optical constant for the system:<br>
in which NA is Avogadro's number, and (dn/dc) is the refractive index increment for the system. The refractive index, n = 1.500 for TCB at 135°C and A, = 690 nm. In addition, A2 = 0.0015 and (dn/dc) = 0.104 for polyethylene in TCB at 135°C; both parameters may vary with average composition of a ethylene copolymer. Thus, the molecular weight determined by LS analysis is calculated by solving the above equations for each point in the chromatogram; together these allow for calculation of the average molecular weight and molecular weight distribution by LS analysis.<br>
A high temperature Viscotek Corporation viscometer is used, which has four capillaries arranged in a Wheatstone bridge configuration with two pressure transducers. One transducer measures the total pressure drop across the detector, and the other, positioned between the two sides of the bridge, measures a differential<br>
pressure. The specific viscosity for the solution flowing through the viscometer at each point in the chromatogram, , is calculated from the ratio of their outputs. The intrinsic viscosity at each point in the chromatogram,  , is calculated by solving the following equation (for the positive root) at each point i:<br>
where Cj is the concentration at point i as determined from the DRI analysis.<br>
The branching index (g1) is calculated using the output of the SEC-DRI-LS-VIS method (described above) as follows. The average intrinsic viscosity, [T|]avg, of the sample is calculated by:<br>
where the summations are over the chromotographic slices, i, between the integration limits. The branching index g' is defined as:<br>
where the Mark-Houwink parameters k and a are given by k = 0.00058 for polyethylene homopolymer, and a = 0.695 for all polyethylene polymers. For ethylene copolymers, k decreases with increasing comonomer content. Mv is the viscosity-average molecular weight based on molecular weights determined by LS analysis.<br>
Experimental and analysis details not described above, including how the detectors are calibrated and how to calculate the composition dependence of Mark-Houwink parameters and the second-virial coefficient, are described by T. Sun, P. Brant, R. R. Chance, and W. W. Graessley (Macromolecules, 2001 volume 34(19), pages 6812-6820).<br>
Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analysis (DMTA) of Polymers and Polymer Blends<br>
Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) was used to measure the small-strain mechanical response (relaxation behavior) of samples in the solid-state as a function of temperature over a temperature range that included the viscoelastic region prior to melting.<br>
Testing was performed on a TA Instruments DMA 2980 using a three point bending configuration. A solid rectangular compression-molded bar was placed on two fixed supports; a movable clamp applied a periodic deformation to the sample midpoint at a frequency of 1 Hz and an amplitude of 20 C.m. The bar was initially cooled to -120°C then heated to 70°C at a heating rate of 3°C/min. Typically, only one bar was tested for each neat material or blend.<br>
The output of these DMTA experiments is the storage modulus (E1) and loss modulus (E"). The storage modulus measures the elastic response or the ability of the material to store energy, and the loss modulus measures the viscous response or the ability of the material to dissipate energy. The ratio of E"/E' (= tan [5]) gives a measure of the damping ability of the material. Energy dissipation mechanisms (i.e., relaxation modes) show up as peaks in tan[6], and are associated with a drop in E' as a function of temperature. The uncertainty associated with reported values of E' is expected to be on the order of ±10%, due to variability introduced by the compression-molding process.<br>
Of particular interest for mechanical properties of polyethylene materials is the relaxation behavior at low temperatures, specifically over the range of-100 to 20°C; any energy dissipation mechanism in this region is identified as a low-temperature relaxation mode (LTRM) for the purposes of this patent. For pure polyethylene, the LTRM is often identified as the "p-relaxation" mode, and is typically very broad in temperature range. We simply characterize the LTRM, without ascribing a physical origin, using the onset temperature (defined as the<br>
extrapolated tangent to the tan[6] peak), the tan[8] peak temperature, and the area under the tan[5] peak. Evidence of improved low-temperature toughness of the material upon plasticizing may be shown by 1) appearance of a new LTRM, 2) enhancement of an existing LTRM in the form of a larger area under the tan 8 peak, and / or 3) shifting of an existing LTRM to lower temperatures. The value of E' at -30°C provides a measure of stiffness at low temperatures, while the value of E' at 25°C provides a measure of the stiffness at room temperature (analogous to the flexural modulus).<br>
Mechanical Properties of Polymers and Polymer Blends<br>
Tensile properties at room temperature (23 ± 2°C) are determined according to ASTM D638, including Young's modulus (also called modulus of elasticity), yield stress (also called tensile strength at yield), yield strain (also called elongation at yield), break stress (also called tensile strength at break), and break strain (also called elongation at break). The energy to yield is defined as the area under the stress-strain curve from zero strain to the yield strain. The energy to break is defined as the area under the stress-strain from zero strain to the break strain.<br>
Injection-molded tensile bars were of ASTM D638 Type IV geometry, and were tested at a speed of 2 inch/min. Compression-molded tensile bars of harder materials (Young's modulus &gt; about 10 kpsi, such as HDPE) were of ASTM D638 Type IV geometry and were tested at a speed of 2 inch/min. Compression-molded tensile bars of softer materials (Young's modulus 
Flexural properties at room temperature are determined according to ASTM D790A, including the 1% secant modulus, 2% secant modulus, and tangent modulus. Test specimen geometry was as specified under the ASTM D790 section "Molding Materials (Thermoplastics and Thermosets)," and the support span was 2 inches (5.08 cm).<br>
Notched Izod impact resistance is determined according to ASTM D256, at the specified temperature. A TMI Izod Impact Tester was used. Pairs of specimens were made by cutting injection-molded ASTM D790 "Molding Materials (Thermoplastics and Thermosets)" bars in half. The notch was oriented such that the impact occurred on the notched side of the specimen (following Procedure A of ASTM D256). All specimens were assigned a thickness of 0.122 inch (0.31cm) for calculation of the impact resistance. All breaks were complete, unless specified otherwise.<br>
Tensile impact strength at room temperature is measured according to ASTM D1822 on compression molded plaques.<br>
Environmental Stress Crack Resistance (ESCR) is measured according to ASTM D1693 on bent-strip specimens. FSQ values (the time in hours estimated for a 50% failure rate) were measured in a 10% Igepal solution.<br>
Heat deflection temperature (HDT) is measured according to ASTM D648 on injection molded flexure bars, at 66 psi load (455kPa).<br>
Film Properties<br>
Flexural and tensile properties (including 1 % Secant Flexural Modulus, Tensile Strength at Yield, Elongation at Yield, Ultimate Tensile Strength, and Elongation at Break) are determined by ASTM D882. Elmendorf tear is<br>
determined by ASTM D1922, and normalized by the average film thickness in mil<br>
(0.001 in, 0.00254 cm). Dart drop impact resistance for blown films is measured following ASTM D1709 (Method A) on specimens that had been aged for at least 2 weeks. Specimen thickness did not comply with ASTM D1709. FSO weights (i.e., the drop weight in grams estimated for a 50% failure rate) were normalized by the average film thickness in mil (1 mil = 0.001 inch=0.00254 cm=25.4um). Puncture resistance for blown films is measured using the procedure of ASTM D5748 on specimens that had been aged at room temperature for at least 2 weeks, except that a matte-finished hemisphere-tipped stainless steel probe is used and loose 0.25 mil (6.4 urn) HDPE "slip sheets" are placed between the probe and specimen. Haze is determined by ASTM D1003. Gloss is determined by ASTM D2457 at 45°.<br>
Methods for determining modifier (plasticizer) content in blend<br>
The modifier content (weight percent basis) in a blend is determined using the CRYSTAF technique described below, unless the CRYSTAF soluble fraction for the unmodified polyethylene is greater than 30% in which case the NMR method described below is used. Both methods are solution methods. Both involve constructing a model based on a calibration curve (or set of calibration curves) of measured parameter(s) as a function of modifier concentration. The calibration blends are prepared using the same polymer and modifier as the blend(s) under investigation but at known modifier concentrations. This set of calibrants must number at least five, and include the neat polymer as well as at least one modifier concentration above the maximum for the blend(s) under investigation but not greater than 50 weight percent modifier. The blend(s) under investigation are analyzed under the same conditions as the calibrants, and the modifier content determined by applying the model.<br>
Crystallization Analysis Fractionation (CRYSTAF)<br>
The first method to determine the amount of modifier in a blend is fractionalion   using   the   Crystallization   Analysis   Fractionation   (CRYSTAF)<br>
technique. This technique involves dissolving a sample in a solvent at high temperature, then'COoling the solution slowly to cause fractionation of the sample based on solubility. For semi-crystalline samples, including blends, solubility depends primarily on crystallizability: portions of the sample that are more crystalline will precipitate out of solution at a higher temperature than portions of the sample that are less crystalline. The relative amount of sample in solution as a function of temperature is measured using an infrared (IR) detector to obtain the cumulative solubility distribution. The soluble fraction (SF) is defined as the IR signal at the lowest temperature divided by the IR signal when all the sample is dissolved at high temperature, and corresponds to the weight fraction of sample that has not crystallized.<br>
In the case of modified ethylene polymers, the modifier is mostly or entirely amorphous and therefore contributes predominantly or exclusively to the SF. Thus, the SF will be larger for blends with higher modifier content. This relationship is exploited to determine the modifier content of a blend of known composition (polymer and modifier types) but unknown concentration. A calibration curve that describes the trend in SF as a function of modifier content is developed by making a series of blends of known concentration using the same polymer and modifier directly in the CRYSTAF vessels, and then running these blends under the same operating conditions as used for blends of unknown concentration. This series of a minimum of five calibrants must include the neat (unmodified) polymer, and at least one modifier concentrations above and one modifier concentration below the concentration of the unknown sample(s) in order to reliably apply the calibration curve to the unknown sample(s). Typically, a linear fit of the calibration points is found to provide a good representation of the<br>
fSF as a function of modifier content (i.e., R &gt; 0.9); if necessary, a quadratic fit is used to improve the representation of the trend (i.e., R2 &gt; 0.9); if a quadratic fit is still insufficient then more calibrants are run to increase the density of points in the range of interest, and the fit is limited to a narrow enough range that a robust representation of the trend in the range of interest is achieved (i.e., R2 &gt; 0.9). This<br>
calibration curve is applied to the SF values measured for the blend(s) under investigation to calculate their respective fluid contents.<br>
A typical CRYSTAF procedure is as follows. A commercial CRYSTAF 200 instrument (Polymer Char S.A., Valencia, Spain) with five stirred stainless steel vessels of 60 mL volume is used. Approximately 30 mg of sample are dissolved for 60 min at 160°C in 30 mL of 1,2-dichlorobenzene stabilized with 2g/4L of butylated hydroxytoluene. The solution is equilibrated for 45 min at 100 °C. The crystallization process is carried out by lowering the temperature of the vessels from 100°C to 30°C at a rate of 0.2 °C/min. A dual wavelength infrared detector with a heated flow through cell maintained at 150°C is used to measure the polymer concentration in solution at regular intervals during the crystallization cycle; the measuring wavelength is 3.5 um and the reference wavelength is 3.6 urn.<br>
If the soluble fraction for the unmodified polyethylene is greater than 30% when analyzed in 1,2-dichlorobenzene as described above, then phenyl ether should be used as the solvent. In this case, the temperatures must be adjusted in the CRYSTAF protocol: the dissolution temperature is 160°C, the equilibration temperature is 160°C, the temperature scan is 160°C to 80°C, and the detector is maintained at 180°C. Otherwise, the protocol is identical. If the soluble fraction of the unmodified polyethylene is still greater than 30%, then the NMR method should be used.<br>
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)<br>
The second method to determine the amount of modifier in a blend is high-temperature solution-phase 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (HTS-CNMR). The composition is determined using the reference spectra of the neat polymer and neat modifier, as well as spectra for a set of calibration blends (i.e., prepared from the neat polymer and modifier at known wt% modifier). The spectra are analyzed<br>
to determine a set of one or more diagnostic resonances or clusters of resonances that increase or decrease in strength monotonically with increasing modifier content. The corresponding peaks are integrated and their fractional contribution to the total integral calculated as a function of modifier content (weight %) to generate a set of calibration curves. A chemometrics model is developed using these calibration curves to provide a method to calculate the modifier content. The number of diagnostic resonances is chosen to allow the model to predict modifier content with a precision of 1 wt% or better over the calibration range. For a general description of chemometrics and how to develop a chemometrics model, see Chemometric Techniques for Quantitative Analysis by Richard Kramer (Marcel Dekker, 1998). The blend(s) of unknown concentration are then run following the same HTS-CNMR procedure as used for the calibrants, and the results analyzed according to the model to determine the weight % modifier.<br>
A typical HTS-CNMR procedure is as follows.  Samples are prepared in<br>
1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-C, with chromium acetylacetonate [Cr(acac)3] added as<br>
a relaxation agent to accelerate data acquisition.  The Cr(acac)a concentration in<br>
the stock solvent is approximately 15 mg/ml. Sample concentrations are between<br>
10 and 15 weight %. Free induction decays of 15,000 transients are accumulated<br>
at a temperature of 120°C on a Varian UnityPlus 500 using a 10mm broadband<br>
probe. Spectra are acquired with a 90° carbon excitation pulse, and inverse-gated<br>
WALTZ-16 proton decoupling.   An acquisition time of approximately 1 second<br>
and recycle delay of 3.5 seconds are used to allow quantitative integration.<br>
Solvent choice and sample concentration may be adjusted to accommodate<br>
different solubility and to minimize spectral interference based on the specific<br>
composition of the blend.   See Carbon-13 NMR Spectroscopy: High-Resolution<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention, while not meant to be limited by, may be better understood by reference to the following examples and tables. The ethylene polymers and modifiers used in these examples are described in Tables 3-5.<br>
Sample Preparation Methods<br>
Samples were generated by blending the desired polyethylene composition, followed by fabrication into an article for testing.<br>
Blending<br>
Two methods were used to generate examples of modified blends. The first method, which is referred to as the Extruder Method, involved "dry blending" polymer granules or pellets with appropriate amounts of modifier and an additive package (including, for example, antioxidants) in a tumble blender to achieve a homogeneous mixing of components at the desired modifier and additive concentrations. This was followed by compounding and pelletizing the blend using an extruder at an appropriate extrusion temperature above the melting point of the polymer, typically in the range of 150 to 220°C depending on the polymer.<br>
The second method, which is referred to as the Brabender Method, involved mixing polymer pellets with the modifier in a heated C. W. Brabender Instruments Plasticorder to achieve a homogeneous melt at the desired modifier concentration. The Brabender was equipped with a Prep-Mixer head (approximately 200 cm3 volume) and roller blades. The operating temperature was above the melting point of the polymer, but always in the range of 155 to 190°C. Polymer was first melted in the Brabender for 1 minute at 60 RPM. Modifier was then added slowly to prevent pooling in the melted polymer. The blend was then mixed for 5 minutes at 60 RPM under a nitrogen purge. The<br>
Brabender was opened and the melt removed from the mixing head and blades as quickly as possible, and allowed to solidify. For those blends later subjected to injection molding, the pieces of material from the Brabender were cut into smaller pieces using a guillotine, then ground into even smaller pieces using a Wiley Mill.<br>
Injection Molding<br>
Tensile bars (ASTM D638 Type IV) and flexure bars (ASTM D790) were molded using 20 ton Nissei injection molding equipment using the following conditions: barrel temperature in the range of 200-210°C; nozzle temperature in the range of 210-220°C; mold temperature was 40°C; inject time was 30 sec; cooling time was 20 sec; and boost time was about 1 sec.<br>
Compression Molding<br>
The following is a description of a typical compression molding protocol. Material to be molded was placed between two sheets of poly(tetraflouroethylene) (PTFE)-coated aluminum foil onto a 0.125 inch (0.32cm) thick chase, and pressed in a Carver press at 160°C. The material was allowed to melt for 5 minutes without pressure applied, then compressed for 5 minutes at a setting of 10 metric tons. It was then removed and immediately placed between water-cooled cold platens and pressed for another 5 minutes at a setting of 10 metric tons. The foil-sample-foil assembly was allowed to anneal for at least 40 hours at room temperature (approx. 23°C ), then quenched in dry ice prior to removing the sample from the foil to prevent deformation of the material when peeling off the foil. Tensile and flexure specimens were died out of the sample once it warmed to room temperature.<br>
Blown-Film Process<br>
Films with a target thickness of 1.0 mil (25.4um) were prepared on a Gloucester blown-film line. The process was run at 188 Ibs/hour (85.3 kg/hr) in the tube stock mode, using a 2.5 in (6.4cm) diameter extruder with temperatures<br>
ranging from 155 to 200°C along the barrel to the die. Screw RPM were adjusted to maintain a fixed throughput. The die gap was 60 mils (1.5 mm), the film width was 23.5 inches (59.7 cm), and the layflat was 2.5 inches (6.4 cm).<br>
Examples in Tables 6-8 (Molded Articles)<br>
The addition of modifier improves the mechanical properties of molded polyethylene resins, primarily in terms of enhanced softness and flexibility. This is reflected in reduced Young's modulus, yield strength, and flexural modulus. It is also seen in trends toward lower stress at break and higher strain at break. Higher elongation facilitates the compliance of molded articles to deformation during either the conversion process or at the end-use.<br>
Surprisingly, the resin is softened without loss of melting point. This is in contrast to the most common approach to enhancing softness, which is to synthesize resins of lower density by copolymerization of ethylene with comonomer, such as an alpha-olefin monomer like hexene or a polar monomer like vinyl actetate, which introduces short-chain branching in the polymer. Increased short-chain branching reduces the degree of crystallinity of the resin, as well as its melting point. As a result, the increased softness of lower density resins comes at the cost of a lower melting point, which translates into a lower heat-distortion temperature. This tradeoff limits the usability of common flexible polyethylene resins.<br>
However, the melting behavior of polyethylene is not altered by the addition of the modifiers claimed in this invention, as revealed by minor changes in the onset and peak melting temperatures. Moreover, the degree of crystallinity of the polymer is reduced only modestly (by about 10% or less), as revealed by the heat of fusion (AHf) values for the blends vs neat resins after normalizing by the weight fraction of polymer in each blend. These conclusions are further supported by the crystallization behavior.<br>
The use of modifiers to plasticize/soften polyethylene is therefore seen to be similar to the effect of lowering resin density by increasing the comonomer content, but does not have the limitation of also lowering the melting point and heat-distortion temperature, which is crucial for applications requiring maintenance of molded article dimensions at high temperature. Furthermore, the degree of softness can be adjusted at any step along the path from the PE resin plant to the end-product manufacturing site by adding more or less modifier to a single resin, in contrast to the need to handle large quantities of entirely separate resins at different densities.<br>
The addition of modifier also improves melt flowability, as indicated by an increase in melt index (MI). The improvement of melt flowability is further evidenced by a decrease in zero-shear viscosity, T\Q, without significant effect on the shear-thinning characteristics, as reflected in only small changes in the X and n rheological parameters. In this respect, the modifier can take the place of some or all of the "processing aids" such as fluorinated polymers which are commonly added to polyethylene resins to improve their processibility.<br>
This improvement in melt flowability is not associated with a decrease in polymer molecular weight, which is a common approach to improve processibility, wherein a higher MI resin is used to increase processing speeds and/or lower processing energy requirements. It is also a departure from other traditional approaches to achieve low melt viscosity, such as broadening the molecular weight distribution of the resin, using a bimodal composition distribution resin, or introducing long-chain branching to the resin. All these approaches have some merits, but the overall balance of melt processibility and solid-state properties is less than desired.<br>
The present invention provides a way to alter the melt rheology in such a way as to improve melt flowability without changing the underlying molecular weight, polydispersity, and or architecture of the polymer. The improvement of melt flowability usually benefits fabrication processes (for example, fiber spinning, film casting, extrusion, and injection molding) in terms of better draw-<br>
down, lower extruder torque, thin wall injection, and faster cycle time. Moreover, the retention of molecular weight will translate into improved melt strength relative to the same MI material without modifier, which is important for fabrication processes such as film blowing, film casting, and fiber spinning.<br>
Improvement in mechanical properties upon plasticization is also revealed by the DMTA results. In general, the addition of modifier/modifier depresses the low-temperature (-30°C) storage modulus of polyethylene resins. A lower storage modulus (or "elastic modulus") at any particular temperature indicates better flexibility for the end-use at that particular temperature. Modifiers of relatively low molecular weight ( -10°C) tend to have a null or opposite effect, that is to modestly increase the low-temperature storage modulus. The ambient temperature (25°C) storage modulus data generally mimic the improved softness revealed by the flexural modulus results. Plasticization also improves the low-temperature relaxation behavior of polyethylene in at least three ways: 1) by introducing a new LTRM, as in the case for HDPE shown in Table 6e and Figure 1; 2) by shifting an existing LTRM to a lower temperature, as is the case for EVA shown in Table 7e; or 3) by enhancing the magnitude of an existing LTRM, as is the case for the plastomer shown in Table 8e and Figure 2.<br>
Polymers exhibiting such advantageous changes in the LTRM behavior without compromising the melting characteristics are very desirable and can provide improved toughness, including better impact resistance, particularly below 20°C and more importantly below freezing temperature, by improving the low-temperature energy dissipation capabilities while maintaining the ability for high temperature usage. The modified polyethylenes of the present invention exhibit this improved toughness as reflected, for example, in improved notched Izod impact resistance data for HDPE at -18°C. Traditional methods to introduce a LTRM, or to amplify an existing LTRM, include the incorporation of comonomers as in the case for linear low-density polyethylene or plastomers; however, doing so also depresses the melting and crystallization temperatures of<br>
the polymer. The present invention provides a similar advantage but does not significantly alter the melting temperature and crystallization temperature of ethylene polymers. Thus the temperature window for usefulness of polyethylene is expanded by this modification technology.<br>
Examples in Tables 9-1Q (Blown Films)<br>
Films were fabricated using a film-blowing processing from two different linear low density polyethylene resins in both unplasticized and plasticized versions, where the modifier was 5 wt% PAO (SHF-101, also known as SpectraSyn 10). The modified versions show much improved optical properties (lower haze and higher gloss) with slightly improved mechanical properties that correspond to a softening of the film (for example, lower flexural modulus). Dart drop and puncture properties are essentially unchanged. Tear properties, as measured by Elmendorf tear, are improved in the machine direction (MD) without significant change in the transverse direction (TD), resulting in a decrease in the ratio of TD to MD values, or more uniformity. Again, processibility is improved by modification, as indicated by an increase in MI without changing the molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, or architecture of the polymer. Polyethylene resins that yield such improved properties, including more uniform tear properties, offer advantages in many film applications; for example, food packaging, stationery cover, tape, medical and electronic packaging.<br>
Examples in Tables 11-13 (Molded Articles from HOPE)<br>
The present invention is particularly successful at softening high density polyethylene without loss of its high-temperature capabilities. This is demonstrated even using very low amounts of modifier, such as 2 wt% PAO of different molecular weight. Such modification lowers the flexural modulus, lowers the tensile yield strength, and generally increases the elongation to break. It also improves the overall toughness of the resin, as reflected in significantly better environmental stress crack resistance (ESCR) after modification; in some cases the improvement can reach a<br>
two-fold increase in ESCR. At a given modifier concentration, ESCR increases with increasing PAO rriolecular weight. Improved toughness is also reflected in higher tensile impact strength; however, the extent of this improvement decreases as PAO molecular weight and/or resin density increase, to the point that it is a null or detrimental effect for combinations of the highest PAO molecular weight and highest resin density. Again, processibility is improved by modification, as indicated by an increase in MI without changing the molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, or architecture of the polymer. All this modification of physical properties is accomplished without a discernable change in melting point. Moreover, the isothermal crystallization rate decreases, which should result in improved clarity of the resin.<br>
