				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparing a benzimidazole derivatives<br>
Object of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to new benzimidazole derivatives with H! antihistaminic activity, lacking cardiotoxic effects<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The prior art closest to the compounds of the present invention is in Spanish patent No. 9201512 which describes a number of piperidine benzimidazole derivatives with antihistaminic and antiallergic activity of general formula:<br>
(FormulaRemoved) <br><br><br>
The major-structural difference between the compounds of the present invention and those of the said patent is the presence of oxygenated functions in the phenyl group substitution. An important pharmacophorous character has moreover been found for these oxygenated functions which consists essentially in a selectivity of action and provides a pharmacological profile distinct from that of other known antihistimaines. The compounds disclosed in this invention present an almost exclusive Ht antihistaminic pharmacological activity and are therefore devoid of action on other<br><br>
pharmacological receptors even at doses much higher than the therapeutic ones. Because of this selectivity in action, they are valuable instruments in treating allergic-type conditions, particularly allowing their unrestricted use by persons under any other concomitant medication whatsoever, and in the case of patients with pathological cardiocirculatory disturbances.<br>
Description of the Invention<br>
It has long since been known that histamine plays a very important role in allergic-type diseases, such as allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, urticaria and asthma; antihistaminic compounds acting at the H1-receptor histamine level are useful for treating such conditions. First generation H1 antihistamines presented a number of adverse effects, such as sedation and dryness of the mouth, resulting from its action on the central nervous system and colinergic receptors. The search for molecules that would not cross the haematoencephalic barrier brought about the displacement of the early antihistamines by other second generation antihistamines which overcame the side effects linked to their action on the central nervous system. This new generation of antihistamines, amongst which noteworthy, due to their extensive use worldwide, are terfenadine and astemizole, has recently displayed a negative aspect in the form of dangerous cardiovascular effects, extending the QT space and ventricular arrhythmia, which has required its use to be avoided in those cases in which the patient is prone to suffering such disturbances or when he is being treated with substances that may interfere with his metabolism.<br>
Attempts at obtaining safe and efficient H1 antihistamines have multiplied in recent years and this research has resulted in several recent patent applications claiming pharmaceutical compositions for treating allergic diseases containing antihistamines devoid of arrhythmogenic effects, which is the case of US patent application number 924,156 (3/08/92) and international patent application number 95/00480 (05/01/95).<br><br>
The present invention relates to a group of new compounds with benzimidazolic structure having potent selective H! antihistaminic activity, lacking activity on the central nervous system and on the cardiovascular system.<br>
The compounds subject of the present invention have the following general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
in which R1 is hydrogen or a short chain hydrocarbon group such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl. cyclopropyl or vinyl, and R2 is a group selected from among CH2OH, COOH, COOR3 and 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl, R3 being a short chain alkyi group as previously defined, and their addition salts with pharmacologically acceptable acids or bases.<br>
Compounds I in which R1 is a short chain alkyi group and R2 is the 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxa2olinyl group can be conveniently prepared by an N-alkylation reaction of 2-(4-piperidin3rl)-lH-benzimidazole with an alkylating agent of formula III wherein X is a good leaving group in nucleophilic substitution reactions such as Cl, Br, I, R4SO2, R2SO3, etc., in the presence of an inorganic base, such as an alkaline metal carbonate or bicarbonate within an organic solvent, followed by another N-alkylation reaction of the resulting benzimidazole IV with an ether of formula X.CH2CH2OR12 wherein X has the meaning given above and R1 is a short chain hydrocarbon group, such as Me, Et, i-Pr, cyclopropyl, vinyl, etc., in the presence of a hydride or an alkaline metal carbonate.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)	<br>
Compounds I, in which R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a carboxyl group, can be conveniently prepared (by hydrolysis of the benzimidazoles Ia with a mineral acid such as HC1 or H2SO4<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Compounds I in which R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a<br>
COOR3 group in which R3 is a short chain alkyl group, can be prepared by acid hydrolysis of the benzimidazoles la in the presence of an alcohol solvent R3OH, in adequate conditions for transesterification  <br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
Compounds I in which R1 is"g short chain alkyl group and R2 is a CH2OH group can be prepared by a reduction of the benzimidazoles Ib or Ic with a suitable reducing agent, such as aluminium and lithium hydride.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compound I in which R, is a hydrogen  and R2 is a 4,4-dimethyl-2-oxazolinyl group can be preparedfby an allcylationJDf the benzimidazole IV with ethyl chloroacetate in the presence of a nydride or an alkaUne metal carbonate to yield the ester V, which is then reduced by a reducing agent such as aluminium and lithium hydride.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compound I in which R1 is a hydrogen and Rz is a COOH group is conveniently prepared by hydrolysis with a mineral acid such as HC1 or H2SO4 of the compound Ie.<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The obtained new benzimidazoles I can be turned into pharmaceutically acceptable salts by treatment with suitable acids or bases.<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a benzimidazole derivatives of formula: -<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R1 is a short chain alkyl group and R2 is a COOR3 group in which R3 is a short chain alkyl group, , said process comprising -<br>
-	hydrolysis of the benzimidazoles of formula la<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined above,<br>
in the presence of alcohol solvent of the kind such as herein described, in<br>
adequate conditions for transesterificaiton.<br><br>
Compounds of formula I have useful pharmacological properties. In particular, they are potent H! antihistarnines. This activity was clearly demonstrated in vitro by blocking the histamine-induced contractions in the isolated guinea pig ileum (Magnus, Pfliigers, Arch. Ges. Physiol., 102, 123 (1904); Arunlakshana, O. and Schild, H.O., Br. J. Pharmacol. 14,48-58 (1959)) and in vivo by the capacity to inhibit the increment of histamine-induced cutaneous capillary permeability in rats (Lefebvre, P., Salmon, J., Leconte and Cauwenberge, V.H., C.R. Soc. Biol. 156, 183-186 (1962); Udaka, K., Takeuchi, Y. and Moral, H.Z., Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 133, 1384-1387(1970)).<br>
Thus, compound Ib (R1=ethyl) proved to be a potent guinea pig ileum Hi-receptor histamine mixed antagonist, with calculated pA2=7.98-8.10 and pD2'=6.50. This same compound inhibited in vivo the increase in . capillary permeability in rats with a DE50 close to 2 mg/kgp.o. At doses of 5 mg/kg p.o. it maintained a significant activity, in excess of 5O%, for at least 6 hours.<br>
These compounds are highly selective in their pharmacological action, and present no significant anticholinergic activity nor activity on the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. Thus, compound Ib (R1=Et) is not able to antagonize significantly the acetylcholine-induced contractions in isolated guinea pig ileum at 0.1 M concentrations and does not modify the spontaneous motor activity of the rat at 100 mg/kg p.o.; furthermore, this same compound, administered at 20 mg/kg i.v.. induces no morphological ECG disturbance nor does it increase the QTC interval in rats.<br>
In view of their useful pharmacological antihistaminic and antiallergic properties, the compounds described in the present invention can be formulated in several pharmaceutical forms to be later administered<br><br>
orally, topically injectabry and rectally. Oral preparations are made intimately mixing a quantity effective as antihistaminic of one of the products described in the present invention with excipients such as lactose, cellulose, talc and the like for tablets or capsules, or water, glycols, alcohols, oils and the like for syrups, solutions and suspensions. Topical administration can be made in the form of creams, ointments, gels, solutions and transcutaneous plasters, using agents such as vaseline, polyethylene glycols, etc. as a carrier. In preparations for injectables, the excipient will be, at least for the most part, sterilised water, although other excipients, such as saline solutions, glucose solutions, etc., or mixtures thereof, may be added to enhance solubility.<br>

5 g of l-/2-hydroxyethyl)-2-[l((2(4-(l(4,4-diinetiiyl-Δ2-oxazoline-2-yl)-<br>
l-m.ethyle1hyl)phenyl)ethyl)piperidine-4-yl]-lH-beriziniidazole (le) were<br>
dissolved in 45 ml of 3N HC1 and refruxed for an hour. This was taken<br>
to a basic pH with 50% NaOH and 2O ml of ethylene glycol were added.<br>
This was heated at 190°C for three hours with simultaneous distillation<br>
and then concentrated in vacuo. Water was added and extracted with<br>
ether. The aqueous layer was taken to pH 7 with diluted HC1, saturated<br>
with sodium chloride and extracted with w-butanol. The ethereal extract<br>
was   dried  and  concentrated.   The   residue  was   recrystallised  in<br>
acetone/methanol  to yield 2.7 g  of 2-[4-(2-(4-(l-(2-hydroxyethyl)<br>
benzimidazole-2-yl)piperidine-1 -yl)ethyl)phenyl] -2-methylpropanoic<br>
acid.<br>
MP: 218°C (breaks down)<br>
