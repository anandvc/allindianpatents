				<td>The present invention relates to frame profile for a rack of a switchgear cabinet.<br>
The invention relates to a frame profile for a rack of a switchgear cabinet with at least one inner wall facing the interior of the switchgear cabinet, which is provided with at least one row of attachment means inserted at identical intervals.<br>
Such a rack is described in DE 33 44 598.  The rack has twelve identical interconnected frame profiles.  the frame profiles carry two inner walls, which are connected together at right angles.  Inserted into each of these inner walls is a row of attachment means.  The attachment means are formed by apertures with a substantially square cross-section.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a frame profile of the type already mentioned, in which impairment of the rigidity by the attachment means is low, and in which built-in components may be attached to the attachment means in a stable manner.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention in that the attachment means are in the form of slot-shaped apertures, whose clear opening width in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile is greater than the clear opening width transversely to the longitudinal direction.<br><br>
The longitudinally-aligned slot-shaped attachment means have only a slight influence on the rigidity, particularly the torsion-resistance of the frame profile Because the attachment means extend in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile, it is possible to attach built-in components in a stable manner.  Attachment members with a constructive height adapted to the clear opening width in the longitudinal direction of the frame-profile can be supported in the attachment means.  As a large opening width is provided, the attachment members can also have correspondingly large dimensions in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile.  The main load axis during the attachment of built-in components now extends along the frame profile in such a way that the occurring load may be optimally absorbed in the attachment means.<br>
Thus there results a frame profile in which, due to the special dimensioning of the attachment means, a high degree of rigidity is achieved.  On the other hand however stable attachment of built-in components is possible to the attachment means.<br>
In dimensioning the attachment means, the clear opening width of the attachment means in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile should be at least twice<br><br>
as large as the opening width transversely to the longitudinal direction.  The most varied attachment members may be secured in the attachment means.  The use of hook-shaped attachment members is advantageous.  For example, assembly rails may be used as built-in components.  These are bent out of sheet metal.  The hook-shaped attachment member is in this case stamped out cf the sheet metal.  The clear opening width transversely to the longitudinal direction of the frame profile is then adapted to the thickness of the sheet metal.  Thus a simple and cost-effective connecting mechanism can be produced with the slot-shaped attachment means.<br>
In a preferred variant of the invention, two inner walls at right angles to one another face the interior of the switchgear cabinet, and a further profiled side, formed as an inner wall, is connected at right angles to the inner walls, and each of the inner walls/profile sides is provided with a row of attachment means.  In this frame profile a plurality of possible attachments is provided which, depending on the space available, can be used in the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  In particular, one profile side always stands parallel to an inner wall. Thus there result two attachment planes extending parallel to one another.  The number of possible attachments for built-in components may also be simply increased in that the inner wall facing the interior of<br><br>
the switchgear cabinet is respectively provided with at least one further row of attachment means, and in that the rows of attachment means extend parallel to one another.  In a rack made up of the frame members according to the invention it may be envisaged that the horizontal frame profiles which form a base and a top frame are provided en the inner wall extending vertically to the side of the rack with two rows of attachment .means, at least the row of attachment; means facing the side of the rack forming the slot-shaped apertures, and in that these rows of attachment means merge into the rov;s of attachment means of the vertical frame profiles. Because the rows of attachment means of the horizontal fraiue profiles merge into those of the vertical frame profiles, built-in components can be secured diagonally. In particular it is advantageous if the attachment means merge into one another in the grid dimension.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided frame profile for a rack of a switchgear cabinet with inner wall facing the interior of the switchgear cabinet, which is provided with row of attachment means as herein described provided at identical intervals, characterised in that the attachment means are in the form of slot-shaped apertures, whose clear opening width in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile is greater than the clear opening width transversely to the longitudinal direction.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to an embodiment given by way of example and shown in the drawings, which show:<br>
Figure 1: a perspective side view of a rack for a switchgear cabinet comprising frame profiles, and<br><br>
Figure 2: a detail of a corner area of the rack according to Figure 1.<br>
Figure 1 shows a rack for a switchgear cabinet.  The rack is substantially made up of a base frame 10 and a top frame 20 and four vertical frame profiles 40.  The vertical frame profiles 40 connect the base frame 10 to the top frame 20.  Base and top frames 10 and 20 are identical in construction, so that they can be' interchanged.<br>
The base and top frames 10 and 20 respectively have four horizontal frame profiles 21, 22 at right angles to one another.  The horizontal frame profiles 21, 22 are provided, on their inner walls facing the interior of the rack, with rows of attachment means 23, 24, 24.1.  The vertical frame profiles 40 also are provided with attachment means 45, 46 facing the interior of the rack. Thread receiving means 24.2 or 44 are located between the individual attachment means 23, 24, 24.1, 45, 46.<br>
The vertical frame profiles 40 are connected via connectors 30 to the base or top frames 10, 20.  The connectors 30 are located in the area of corner receiving means 25 of the base or top frame 10, 20.  In order to connect the vertical frame profiles to the connector 30, screw connections or a weld are for example provided.<br><br>
In Figure 2 a corner area of the rack according to Figure 1 is shown in more detail.<br>
This view shows that the two horizontal frame profiles 21, 22 are identical in structure.  Facing the interior of the rack the two inner walls 25.1, 25.2 are connected to one another at right angles.  The horizontal inner wall 25.1. facing upwards merges into a folded portion 26. The folded portion 26 is parallel with the side of the rack.  Side walls or a cabinet door may be applied thereto with an Interposed seal.!  The folded portion 26 merges into two outer walls 27, which in turn are at right angles to one another.  Thus the outer walls 27 are parallel to the inner walls 25.1, 25.2.  In the area formed by the return of the two outer walls 27, a folded portion of the side wall or of the cabinet door can be accommodated.  The vertical outer wall 27 is connected to the vertical inner wall 25.2 via the base 28, so that an enclosed hollow profile results for the horizontal frame profiles 21, 22.<br>
The vertical inner wall is provided with a row of attachment means 23.  The attachment means 23 are formed as apertures with a substantially rectangular cross-section.  Provided on the upwardly facing horizontal inner wall are two rows of attachment means 24, 24.1.<br><br>
The two rows of attachment means are parallel to one another in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile 21, 22.  While the inwardly-lying attachment, means 24 are identical with the attachment means 23 of the vertical inner wall 25.2, the attachment means 24.1 are slot-shaped.  The slot-shaped attachment means 24.1 have a clear opening width in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile 21, 22 which is greater than the opening width transversely to the longitudinal'direction. Thread receiving means 24.2 are respectively located between the individual attachment means 23, 24, 24.1. The thread receiving means 24.2 in their raw state are stamped-out sections, into which self-tapping screws can be inserted.<br>
The horizontal frame profiles 21, 22 are connected to one another at right angles and form the outwardly-open corner receiving means 25.  In this corner receiving means 25, the vertical frame profile 40 is applied to the connector 30.<br>
The vertical frame profile 40 has four inner walls 41, 42.  The inner walls 41 are at right angles to one another and form an inner receiving means facing the interior of the rack.  Vertically extending assembly rails can be secured in this internal receiving means. The two inner walls 42 formed as profile sides, connect<br><br>
with the two inner walls 41 at right angles.  These inner walls 42 are also at right angles to the sides of the rack.  Each of the inner walls 41, 42 is provided with a row of attachment means 45, 46.  These attachment means 45, 46, like the attachment means 24.1 of the horizontal frame profiles 21, 22, are slot-shaped, the main extension direction being in the longitudinal direction of the frame profile 40.  The inner walls 40 connect flush on the outer side of the rack with the inner walls 25.1 of the horizontal frame profiles 21, 22.  As the attachment means 24.1 of the horizontal frame profiles<br>
21,	22 and the attachment means 45 of the vertical frame<br>
profiles are spaced apart at an equal distance from the<br>
sides of the rack, they merge into one another.  Thus<br>
there results a surrounding attachment frame.  Likewise,<br>
the attachment means 24 can merge into the attachment<br>
means 46 of the inner walls 41.<br>
As will be easily seen from the drawings, a small constructive size of the individual frame profiles 21,<br>
22,	40 may be realised by the narrow, slot-shaped<br>
attachment means 24.1, 45, 46.  In addition, the<br>
attachment means 24.1, 45, 46 scarcely weaken the frame<br>
profiles 21, 22, 40, so that these have a high degree of<br>
rigidity.  At the same time however built-in components<br>
can be secured in a stable manner to the attachment means<br>
24.1, 45, 46.  The plurality of possible attachments<br><br>
results in a high degree of flexibility for the attachment of built-in components in the interior of the switchgear cabinet.  In particular, with the four inner walls 41, 42 of the vertical frame profiles 40, both in the direction of one horizontal frame profile 21 and of the other 22, two vertical attachment planes can be formed, lying one behind the other.  The attachment planes are thus respectively formed by an inner wall -51 and a further inner wall 42.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
