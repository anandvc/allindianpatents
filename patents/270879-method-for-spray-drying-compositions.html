IMPROVEMENTS RELATING TO RAPIDLY DISSOLVING COMPOSITIONS<br>
Technical  Field:<br>
The present invention relates to dried compositions which dissolve rapidly in water.<br><br>
Background to the Invention:<br>
Many useful materials are water-insoluble. These include, without<br>
    limitation, many dyestuffs (i.e. pigments), some fluorescer materials and many pharmaceutical materials.  In some circumstances it is possible to disperse these materials in water by processes involving fine comminution, but this can be expensive and time-consuming.<br><br>
Our co-pending international patent application PCT/GB03/03226 describes the formation of solid, porous beads comprising a three dimensional open-cell lattice of a water-soluble polymeric material. These are typically templated' materials formed by<br>
    the removal of both water and a non-aqueous dispersed phase from a high internal phase emulsion (HIPE) which has a polymer dissolved in the aqueous phase.  The beads are formed by dropping the HIPE emulsion into a low temperature fluid such as liquid nitrogen, then freeze-drying the particles formed to remove the<br>
    bulk of the aqueous phase and the dispersed phase. This leaves behind the polymer in the form of a  ‘skeletal' structure.<br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>
-   2   -<br>
The beads dissolve rapidly in water and have the remarkable property that a water-insoluble component dispersed in the dispersed phase of the emulsion prior to freezing and drying can also be dispersed in water on solution of the polymer skeleton of  the beads.<br>
The production process for the beads and related materials is complex. It requires the use of liquid gasses and vacuum equipment.  Throughput is relatively low. There is a clear need  to devise a simpler and cheaper process.<br>
Past workers have looked at ways of delivering water-insoluble materials such as carotenoids.  US 3998753 (Antoshkiw et al., 1974) discloses a method of preparing a water-dispersible<br>
   carotenoid composition which comprises the steps of forming an emulsion of the carotenoid in a volatile solvent (such as chloroform) and various structurants (such as gelatine) in water. This emulsion is heated with high-speed mixing to drive off the volatile solvent and the resulting emulsion product can be used<br>
   as is.  Optionally, the solvent-free product may be further processed by spray drying to remove the water and give a dry product.<br>
US 4213900 (Daubach et al., 1978) takes a different approach. 5  Here formic acid, formamide, N-methylformamide, butyrolactone, ethylene or propylene glycols are used as solubilising agents for water-insoluble dyes.  Once a solution has been formed it can be spray-dried to form a fine powder which can be dispersed in water.<br><br><br><br>
-   3   -<br>
Pamujula et al.   (Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology,   2004,   56: 1119-1125)   disclose a process for the production of spray dried poly(lactide-co-glycolide)    (PLGA)   carrier particles containing the cytoprotective drug                                               amifostine.     In the procedure described the drug was dissolved in water and emulsified with a solution of PLGA carrier in a water-immiscible  solvent   (dichloromethane) . This was spray-dried to remove the majority of the solvent and obtain nanoparticles,  which were then freeze-dried to remove any residual solvent.  The final product of the process was in the form of nanoparticles having a median size of 240-257 nm.<br>
Several other methods are known which result in a   dry emulsion'. For example Dollo et al   (Eur.   J.  of Pharmaceutical Sciences,   19, issue  4 pages  273-280)   discloses a physically stabilised dry    emulsion with  a  lipophilic drug dissolved in  the oil phase.<br>
Hansen,  Holm and Schultz   (Int J.  Pharmaceutics,   287,   issue  1-2, 9th December 2004,  pages 55-66)   disclose a process for preparing powders containing a poorly water-soluble drug dissolved in   (nonvolatile)   medium chain triglyceride,   by spray drying o/w emulsions.   The products of this process would still contain the 'solvent'   for the drug,   i.e.  non-volatile medium chain triglyceride.   Thus the product of the spray drying process  can be described as  a   'dry emulsion'   which will  reform the initial emulsion on addition of water.<br>
DE 2122662   (BASF,   1972)   discloses  a process  for obtaining a water-insoluble dye dispersion with practically the  same degree of  dispersion as  that produced by -'wet miiling of. the    dye.   This  process involves mixing "the dye with a  surfactant, water^ and  a water-immiscible ..solvent,   subjecting the mixture<br><br>

to heat  and/or pressure and spray drying the  treated mixture.<br>

Brief Description of the Invention:<br>
We have now determined that spray drying can be used instead of freeze drying to obtain solid, rapidly dissolving   materials directly from an emulsion.<br>
Accordingly a first aspect of the present invention provides a method comprising the steps of:<br>
   (i)  providing an emulsion of:<br>
a)	an aqueous solvent,<br>
b)	a carrier material dispersible or soluble in (a), 	said carrier material being solid at ambient<br>
temperature,<br>
c)	a volatile second liquid phase which is not<br>
miscible with (a), and<br><br>
d)	a material which is dispersible or soluble in (c)<br>
but not in (a), and,<br>
(ii) Drying the emulsion above ambient temperature to        simultaneously remove (a) and (c) and thereby obtain the carrier material (b) in solid form with (d) dispersed therein, said dispersion of '(d) being a nano-scale dispersion, preferably with a maximum particle : size of at most 615nm.<br><br><br><br>
4a -<br>
The  aqueous  solvent   (a)   is  generally and preferably water, but  may comprise  an  electrolyte  solution  or  a  mixture   of    hydrophilic  solvents.<br><br><br><br>
-   5   -<br>
Advantageously, both the aqueous solvent (a) and the volatile, water-immiscible second liquid phase (c) are simultaneously removed during the drying process, and no separate removal step for either the second liquid phase 5  (e.g. by boiling it off) or the aqueous solvent (e.g. by freeze drying) is needed. By volatile' here is meant that the second liquid phase is sufficiently volatile to be removed as a vapour phase during the drying process. ‘Burning-off of one of the solvents is not required in the  method of the invention.<br>
By far the most preferred method for drying of the intermediate emulsion is by spray drying. This is particularly effective at removing both the aqueous and non- aqueous volatile components to leave the carrier and the ‘payload' material behind in a fine particulate form.<br>
Drying is preferably conducted at a temperature well above ambient (taken as 25 Celsius). It is particularly preferred<br>
that drying is conducted at above 80 and more preferably above 100 Celsius. In the case of a spray drying apparatus this means that the inlet temperature of the spray drying apparatus is, for example, above 100 Celsius. Particularly preferred drying conditions are those in which the drying<br>
temperature is above both the boiling point of water and the boiling point of the volatile second liquid phase.<br>
The final structure of the material obtained is not well understood. However it is believed that ".removal by drying of  the aqueous solvent and the second liquid phase results in a very fine, nano-scale<br><br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
dispersion of the water insoluble material (d) through the water-soluble carrier material (b) . It is believed that the resulting dry materials are not encapsulates, as discrete bodies of the water-immiscible materials (d) are not present  in the dry product. Neither are the dry materials %dry emulsions' as little or none of the volatile solvent comprising the 'oil' phase of the emulsion remains after the drying step. On addition of water to the dry product the emulsion is not reformed, as it would be with a ‘dry   emulsion'.<br>
On admixture of the carrier material with water, the carrier (b) dissolves and the water insoluble material (d) is dispersed through the water in sufficiently fine form that<br>
    it behaves like a soluble material in many respects.<br>
Surprisingly, the effectiveness of materials delivered in this way is hardly reduced as compared with materials delivered using an emulsion- templated, freeze-drying preparation method.<br><br>
Detailed Description of  the Invention:<br>
In order that the present invention may be better understood and      carried forth into practice,   it is described below with reference to various preferred features and particular embodiments.<br>
Carrier Material:<br>
       The carrier material  is water soluble,   which  includes the<br>
formation of structured aqueous phases as well  as true ionic<br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>

solution of molecularly mono-disperse  species.   The  carrier material preferably comprises  an inorganic material, surfactant,   a polymer or may be a mixture  of  two or more the these.   It  is  envisaged that  other non-polymeric,   organic,     water-soluble .materials  such as  sugars can be used as  the carrier.   However the  carrier materials  specifically mentioned herein are preferred.<br>
Polymeric Carrier Materials:<br><br>
When present, the polymeric carrier material is a material that would be considered as "water soluble" by those skilled in the art i.e. if it forms a homogeneous solution in water. Water soluble polymers generally possess pendant polar or<br>
    ionizable groups (e.g. -C=0, -OH, -N(RX) (R2) in which Ra and R2, which may be the same or different, are independently H or (CI to C4)alkyl, -N(R3) (R4) (Rs)+ in which R3, R4 and R5 which may be the same or different, are independently H or (CI to C4)alkyl, -CON(R6) (R7) in which R6 and R7, which may<br>
    be the same or different, are H or (CI to C4) alkyl, -CH2CH20-, -C02H or salts thereof, -S03H or salts thereof groups) on a backbone chain which may be hydrophobic.<br>
If water-soluble polymeric carrier materials are incorporated into the products of the present invention, the time taken for the products to dissolve or disperse may be significantly reduced, as compared with 'off-the-shelf samples of the polymeric carrier materials. It is believed that this is due to the structural result of, in particular,  the spray-drying process. The same is believed to be true of other carrier materials. The nature of the products should<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>
-   8-<br>
be such that the dissolution or dispersion of the products in a large excess of water preferably occurs in less than three minutes, more preferably less than two minutes, most preferably less than one minute. <br>
The particle size and distributions of the ‘payload' material can be tailored by choosing different water-soluble polymers and polymers with different molecular weights. This allows some control over the activity/availability of the   *payload material'.<br>
Examples of suitable water-soluble polymeric carrier materials include:<br>
   (a)  natural polymers (for example naturally occurring gums such as guar gum or locust bean gum or a polysaccharide such as dextran;<br>
   (b)  cellulose derivatives for example xanthan gum,                                    xyloglucan, cellulose acetate, methylcellulose, methyl-<br>

copolymer), a block copolymer, a graft copolymer or a hyperbranched copolymer.  Comonomers other than those listed in Table 1 may also be included in addition to those listed if their presence does not destroy the water soluble or water dispersible nature of the resulting polymeric material.<br>
Examples of suitable homopolymers include polyvinylalcohol, polyacrylic acid, polymethacrylic acid, polyacrylamides<br>
    (such as poly-N-isopropylacrylamide) , polymethacrylamide; polyacrylamines, polymethylacrylamines, (such as polydimethylaminoethylmeth-acrylate and poly-N-morpholinoethylmethacrylate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, polyvinylimidazole, polyvinylpyridine, polyethylene-imine<br>
    and ethoxylated derivatives thereof. Polyvinylalcohol is a particularly preferred carrier material.<br>
Surfactant Carrier Materials:<br>
    Where the carrier material is a surfactant, the surfactant may be non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric or zwitterionic.<br>
Examples of suitable non-ionic surfactants include                      ethoxylated triglycerides; fatty alcohol ethoxylates;<br>
alkylphenol ethoxylates; fatty acid ethoxylates; fatty amide<br>
ethoxylates; fatty amine ethoxylates; sorbitan alkanoates;<br>

Examples of suitable zwitterionic surfactants include N-alkyl derivatives of amino acids (such as glycine,   betaine, aminopropionic acid); imidazoline surfactants; amine oxides; amidobetaines.<br>
Mixtures of surfactants may be used. In such mixtures there may be individual components which are liquid, provided that   the carrier material overall, is a solid.<br>
Anionic surfactants are particularly preferred as carrier materials.<br>
 Inorganic Carrier Materials:<br>
The carrier material can also be an water-soluble inorganic material which is neither a surfactant nor a polymer. Simple •organic salts have been, found suitable, particularly in   ^admixture with polynieric- and/or surfactant carrier materials as described above. Suitable salts include carbonate,<br>

bicarbonates, halides, sulphates, nitrates and acetates, particularly soluble salts of sodium, potassium and magnesium. Preferred materials include, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate and sodium sulphate.  These materials  have the advantage that they are cheap and physiologically acceptable. They are also relatively inert as well as compatible with many materials found in household and pharmaceutical products. In general spray-dried samples containing an inorganic carrier material gave smaller   particle sizes on re-dissolution than comparative freeze-dried samples.<br>
Mixtures of carrier materials are advantageous. Preferred mixtures include combinations of inorganic salts and   surfactants and polymers and surfactants. Where inorganic salts are present the carrier material typically comprise 10-50%wt surfactant and 90-50%wt of the inorganic salt.<br>
Second liquid phase:<br><br>
The compositions of the invention comprise a volatile, second liquid phase, which is not miscible with the aqueous solvent.<br>
    The second liquid phase of the emulsion may be selected from one or more from the following group of volatile organic solvents:<br>
alkanes, such as heptane, n-hexane, isooctane, dodecane, 3       decane;<br><br>

•	cyclic hydrocarbons, such as toluene, xylene, cyclohexane;<br>
•	halogenated alkanes ,such as dichloromethane, dichoroethane, trichloromethane (chloroform) , fluoro-<br>
     trichloromethane and tetrachloroethane;<br>
•	esters such as ethyl acetate;<br>
•	ketones such as 2-butanone; <br>
•	ethers such as diethyl ether;<br>
•	volatile cyclic silicones such as either linear or<br>
cyclomethicones containing from 4 to 6 silicon units.<br>
      Suitable examples include DC245 and DC345, both of which are available from Dow Corning Inc.<br>
Preferred second liquid phases have a boiling point of less than 150 Celsius and, more preferably, have a boiling point<br>
    of less than 100 Celsius, so as to facilitate drying,<br>
particularly spray-drying under practical conditions and without use of specialised equipment. Preferred second liquid phase material are non-flammable, or have a flash point above the temperatures encountered in the method of<br>
    the invention.<br>
Preferably, the second liquid phase comprises from about 10 % to about 95 % v/v of the emulsion, more preferably from about 20 % to about 80 % v/v.<br><br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>
-   14   -<br>
Particularly preferred solvents are halogenated solvents, more preferably chlorine-containing solvents, most preferably solvents selected from (di- or tri-chloromethane). <br>
Materials as carriers:<br>
The products of the present invention include 'payload' materials to be dispersed when the products are partially dissolved in an<br>
    aqueous medium.  These are water-insoluble materials, which are soluble in the second liquid phase. Dispersion into an aqueous medium of such hydrophobic materials is much improved in the products of the invention. These hydrophobic materials are dissolved in the discontinuous phase of the emulsion prior to<br>
    drying.<br>
The present invention also includes, in a further aspect, solutions or dispersions comprising the carrier (preferably surfactant, polymer or inorganic salt) and a hydrophobic   material formed by exposing to an aqueous medium products according to the present invention, wherein said products comprise the hydrophobic material and are obtainable by means of the method of the present invention.<br>
    The present invention is susceptible of a very broad range of applications as regards the choice of hydrophobic material to be carried. The embodiments mentioned below are selected from a range of applications including, home and personal care products, agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals,<br>
    perfumes and flavourings, inks and dyes and other<br>
applications. The list is not intended to be limiting.<br><br>

For example, there are many instances in personal care products such as deodorants, skin and hair cleaning or care products or in household products such as laundry cleaning and care products or household cleaning or care products for hard and soft surfaces where it is desirable to administer hydrophobic materials in an aqueous environment.  Because of the hydrophobic nature of these materials they are often difficult to disperse in an aqueous environment.  The use of the products of the present invention facilitates this dispersion and in many cases enables hydrophobic  materials to be dispersed more effectively than previously.<br>
It may be required to disperse the hydrophobic materials at the point where a formulation is being used.  In this case the materials of the present invention will be contained in a  formulation until it is used by exposing it to an aqueous<br>
environment, at which time the water-soluble/dispersible carrier forming the product will release the hydrophobic material.<br>
Particularly preferred products according to the present<br>
	   invention comprise a water-insoluble, pharmaceutically<br>
active substance and a water-soluble physiologically acceptable carrier.<br>
As well as finding advantageous application at the point of  use, the products of the present invention may be used to introduce hydrophobic materials into formulations, for example, liquid formulations during the manufacture of these formulations.  In this case the products of the present invention will, on contact an aqueous environment, release<br>
		the hydrophobic material in a form in which it can be more<br>
readily incorporated into the product being manufactured.<br><br>

The products of the present invention may be used to transport materials to sites where they can be incorporated into formulations.  By converting liquids into products   according to the invention, the need to transport large amounts of liquids can be avoided resulting in significant cost savings and safer transport of materials, which are potentially hazardous when transported in a liquid form. Materials which would be potentially unstable if stored or   transported in liquid form may be incorporated into the<br>
products of the present invention and stored or transported with less risk of degradation.<br>
It is envisaged that incorporation of potentially unstable   hydrophobic materials, for example vaccines, vitamins or perfume components, into the products of the present invention will protect them from degradation during storage prior to use. For example, a so-called pro-fragrance incorporated into a dry carrier material according to the   invention is expected to exhibit reduced hydrolysis as<br>
compared with the same material in solution or exposed to moist air.<br>
Some specific examples of products in which the products of   the present invention may be used are given below.  These<br>
are given as examples only and are not intended to limit the applicability of the present invention.  Those skilled in the art will however realise that the materials of the present invention will have utility in other areas not   specifically exemplified herein.<br><br>

•	bleach or bleach precursors for example 6-N-<br>
phthalimidoperoxyhexanoic acid (PAP) or photobleaching<br>

     vitamin E, retinol, antioxiants based on hydroxytoluene such as Irganox™ or commercially available antioxidants such as the Trollox™ series.<br>

compositions before use but which are made up into liquid for spraying (or other application) onto animals or crops;<br>
•	perfumes or flavourings or precursors thereto; <br>
•	pharmaceutical^ or veterinary active materials.<br>
Compositions of the present invention may have additional specific advantages. For example, there is a need for<br>
    pharmaceutical compositions, which can be taken by the<br>
consumer without the need to ingest the composition with a drink such as water.  These compositions interact with the moisture in the oral cavity to release the active ingredient, which is then ingested by the consumer.  By<br>
    incorporating the pharmaceutically or veterinary active molecule in the products of the present invention, pharmaceutical compositions which meet this need can be prepared. In a similar way to that described above pharmaceutical and veterinary active ingredients may be<br>
    formulated so that they release the active material into the<br>
nasal, ocular, pulmonary or rectal cavities or on the skin where they may act topically or they may be absorbed trans-dermally to act systemically.<br>
    By using the appropriate polymeric material in the products of the present invention, materials can be made that remain intact until the conditions (for example temperature or pH) change to those under which dispersion can occur. Thus dispersion can be delayed until a certain temperature has<br>
    been reached or until the pH has changed to a suitable value<br>
such as- would occur as the products pass down the GI tract.<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>

Acidity in the GI tract reduces down the GI tract and materials which disperse hydrophobic actives only when the materials are exposed to higher pH conditions enable pharmaceutically or veterinary active materials to be  released only in the intestine having passed through the stomach intact.<br>
Further examples of situations where the products of the present invention are used to incorporate a hydrophobic 0  material into a formulation during the manufacture of that product include:-<br>
•	the introduction of hydrophobic materials such as<br>
fluorescers; enzymes; bleaches; hydrophobic polymers for<br>
      example hydrophobically modified polyacrylates, silicones, hydrophobically modified polyvinylpyrrolidone, sulpha alkyl polysaccharides, Jaguar and JR polymers; fatty alcohols or acids; dyes for example shading dyes or black dyes for colour recovery into laundry products;<br><br>
•	the use of products according to the present invention<br>
containing hydrophobic dyes in the manufacture of water<br>
soluble Inkjet compositions;<br>
    • the introduction of products containing different<br>
hydrophobic materials enables a manufacturer to produce a single base formulation into which the desired hydrophobic materials may be introduced by the use of the appropriate product of the present invention;<br><br>

•	the use of products containing hydrophobic polymers which<br>
disperse into water to form a latex.  The use of such<br>

The materials of the present invention may include within carrier material, water-soluble materials, which will be dispersed when the bodies are dispersed in an aqueous medium.  The water-soluble   materials may be incorporated into the lattice by dissolving them in the liquid medium from which they are made.<br>
Examples of suitable water soluble materials include:-    • Water soluble vitamins such as vitamin C;<br>
•	water soluble fluorescers such as the 4,4'-bis(sulfo-<br>
styryl)biphenyl disodium salt (sold under the trade name<br>
Tinopal CBS-X;<br><br>
•	activated aluminium chlorohydrate;<br>
•	transition metal complexes used as bleaching catalysts;<br>
     • water soluble polymers and oligomers such as polyesters isophthalic acid), gerol, xanthan gum, or polyacrylates; diethylenetriamine-pentaacetic acid (DTPA);<br>

In some cases the water-soluble carrier material itself may not be inert but may also have useful activity. For example, the carriers suggested above include materials which are known to be active as detergency builders (sodium carbonate)  or as an antacid (sodium bicarbonate).<br>
Method of Preparation:<br>
As noted above, the method for preparing the products of the  invention comprises drying an emulsion containing an aqueous phase comprising a carrier and a volatile 'oil' phase comprising a 'payload' material. As noted above, the preferred method of drying is spray drying.<br>
    Preferably, the volatile oil phase comprises from about 10 % to about 95 % v/v of the emulsion, more preferably from about 20 % to about 68 % v/v.<br>
The emulsions are typically prepared under conditions which                    are well known to those skilled in the art, for example, by using a magnetic stirring bar, a homogeniser, or a rotational mechanical stirrer. The emulsions need not be particularly stable, provided that they do not undergo extensive phase separation prior to the drying step. <br>
Homogenisation using a high-shear mixing device is a particularly preferred way to make an emulsion in which the aqueous phase is the continuous phase. It is believed that this avoidance of coarse emulsion and reduction of the 30  droplet size of the dispersed phase of the emulsion, results in an improved dispersion of the ‘payload' material in the<br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>
-   23   -<br>
dry product. In a preferred method according to the invention a water-continuous emulsion is prepared with an average dispersed-phase droplet size (using the Malvern peak intensity) of between 500nm and 3 000nm. We have found that   an 'Ultra-Turrux' T25 type laboratory homogeniser (or<br>
equivalent) gives a suitable emulsion when operated for more than a minute at above 10,000 rpm.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, there is a  directional relation between the emulsion droplet size and the size of the particles of the 'payload' material, which can be detected after dispersion of the materials of the invention in aqueous solution. We have determined that an increase in the speed of homogenisation for precursor  emulsions can decrease final particle size after re-dissolution.<br>
It is believed that the re-dissolved particle size can be reduced by nearly one half when the homogenisation speed<br>
    increased from 13,500 rpm to 21,500 rpm. The homogenisation time also plays an important role in controlling re-dissolved particle size. The particle size again decreases when increase the homogenisation time, and the particle size distribution becomes broader at the same time.<br><br>
For an intermediate emulsion size range of 500-3 00 0nm the re-dispersed particle size range is typically 180-300nm.<br>
Spray drying, the most preferred method of drying the   emulsion, is well known to those versed in the art. In the case of the present invention some care must be taken due to<br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>
-   24   -<br>
the presence of a volatile non-aqueous solvent in the emulsion being dried. In order to reduce the risk of explosion when a flammable solvent is being used, an inert gas, for example nitrogen, can be employed as the drying   medium in a so-called closed spray-drying system. The solvent can be recovered a re-used.<br>
We have found that the 'Buchi' B-2 90 type laboratory spray drying apparatus is suitable.<br><br>
The product form obtained form the preferred spray drying process is a powder. As noted above, the precise microstructure of this powder is unclear. This powder can be incorporated into tablets, either by simple compression<br>
  (where the carrier material is sticky enough) or following the addition of excipients and or tableting agents.<br>
The present invention will now be more particularly described, by way of example only, with reference to the accompanying Examples.<br>
Examples:<br>
  Particle sizing<br>
A method of particle sizing for the dispersed products of the present invention used in the following examples employs a dynamic light scattering instrument (Nano S, manufactured  by Malvern Instruments UK). Transmission electron microscope images and field flow fractionation techniques have been<br><br>
WO 2006/079409<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/013933<br><br>

used to confirm some particle sizing data. Specifically, the Malvern Instruments Nano S uses a red (633nm) 4mW Helium-Neon laser to illuminate a standard optical quality UV curvette containing a suspension of material. The viscosity  of the sample can be measured with a Viscolite 700 portable viscometer (manufactured by Hydramotion UK) prior to analysis with the Malvern Instruments Nano S.<br>

Example 19:<br>
Preparations have been made into tablet form by means of a   tablet maker which has four parts. Three used to form the tablet and one to achieve compression. The parts used for tablet formation are an inverted WU" shape with a hole in the top, into which fits a solid cylinder with arms at the top and a solid rectangle that fits into the inverted U.  Tablets are formed, with the U and rectangle assembled, by adding powder to the hole in the inverted U and carefully placing the cylinder into the hole. The assembly is then placed in the compression part, where the screw thread acts on the cylinder compacting the powder. The tablet is   released by removing the rectangular and cylindrical blocks.<br>
Spray dried powder prepared from cocoPAS, sodium sulphate and fat red dye was made into a 0.5g tablet using this apparatus. When a similar freeze dried powder was used,  (cocoPAS, sodium chloride, fat red dye), a 0.06g tablet was formed.<br><br>

Tablet and powder behave differently in terms of dissolution times and clarity of solution.<br>
   Example 20:<br>
A product comprising sodium sulphate was made by dissolving 0.5g CocoPAS in 12 ml water and adding 0.5g sodium sulphate. O.Olg Fat red 7B dye was dissolved in cyclohexane, added to<br>
    the aqueous solution to form an emulsion and freeze dried as a powder. Other similar powders, varying the CocoPAS : Sodium sulphate ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 gradually, were made in the same way. A similar set of samples containing sodium carbonate was also made. All powders re-dissolved in<br>
    water to give a clear solution. Without sodium carbonate, dissolution took about 20 seconds, with sodium carbonate, the time increased to 1 to 2 minutes.<br>
A CocoPAS:NaS04, 50:50 ratio powder was made, this time   forming the emulsion using a homogeniser and spray drying; for comparison of particle size, which gave a Z (Malvern) average of 57.3 and a poly-dispersity of 0.39. For a 20:80 cocoPAS:Na2S04 sample the particle size Z (Malvern) average was 115 and a poly-dispersity of 0.126. <br>
For freeze dried samples, the particle size would appear to decrease as the amount of filler increases, for sodium sulphate, range Zave. 200 0, polydispersity 0.746 (50:50) to Zave. 609, polydispersity   0.492 (10:90).<br><br>

Other inorganic fillers included sodium carbonate, sodium chloride, magnesium chloride, magnesium acetate, calcium chloride and sucrose; these tended not to give clear solutions. Whereas sodium bicarbonate, sodium acetate and   magnesium sulphate (at 50:50) gave clear re-dispersions. All these were prepared in a PVA/SDS system. Particle sizes varied between Zave. 1380, polydispersity 0.6 and Zave. 771, polydispersity 0.48 for the sodium salt fillers.<br>
    The preparations containing magnesium salts at 50:50 in PVA/SDS, gave particle sizes that ranged between Zave. 72.9, polydispersity 0.402  and Zave. 672, polydispersity 0.655. Magnesium sulphate was also made at the 20:80 ratio, but unlike sodium sulphate, due to it not giving a clear<br>
    solution, the particle size Zave.(255) polydispersity 0.375 was greater than the 50:50 ratio Zave. (72.9) polydispersity 0.402. The particle size data for magnesium salts, for all but the acetate, gave more than one peak size.<br><br>
Calcium chloride and sucrose were also used as bulking agents; they gave particle sizes of Zave .892, polydispersity 0.593 and Zave.338, polydispersity 0.489 respectively.<br><br>
Polymer only i.e. PVA with sodium sulphate filler (50:50) has been prepared as a freeze dried powder. It was slow to re-dissolve; time, 7 minutes, gave a clear solution and particle size Zave. 467, polydispersity 0.557 and had 2<br>
peaks.<br><br>
