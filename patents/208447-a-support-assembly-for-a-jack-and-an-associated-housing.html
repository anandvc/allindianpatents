DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention concerns a support assembly for a jack comprising:<br>
a housing that can be fitted into the spare wheel of a vehicle and which defines a cavity shaped to house the jack, and<br>
releasable anchorage means for fixing the housing to the vehicle body, associated with the base of the housing and capable of assuming a closed position in which the housing and the spare wheel are both fixed to the body, and an open position in which both the housing and the spare wheel can be removed from the body.<br>
An assembly of the type defined above is known from Italian utility model application number T094U000057 in the name of the same Applicant. This assembly comprises a housing from the base of which extends a cup-like body provided with a hole for engaging part of an attachment member having a knob to which is fixed a relatively long screw capable of cooperating with a nut fixed to the vehicle body.<br>
However, the presence of the attachment member having a separate screw means makes the entire assembly relatively expensive and heavy. Furthermore, it is not very practical to use as it is difficult to engage the screw in the associated nut and a certain amount of time is required to completely unscrew or screw the screw member when it is desired to separate or fix the housing and/or the spare wheel to the vehicle body. It is in particular necessary to tightly screw the screw member in order to avoid play between the vehicle body, the housing and the spare wheel, which would certainly give rise to annoying noises when the vehicle is operating. However, following to the operation of the vehicle, accompanied by the inevitable vibrations to which it is subject, the screw member can become loose, so that play can easily arise even if the screw member is tightened to the base.  Furthermore, the<br><br>
fact that the attachment member is made as an independent part of the jack-holder housing constitutes a further disadvantage, as it is possible to misplace this member when it is separated from the jack-holder housing.<br>
In order to overcome the aforesaid disadvantages, the object of the invention is a jack-holder assembly of the type specified above, characterised in that the anchorage means comprise a pair of formations, one intended to be fixed to the vehicle body and the other connected to the housing, these formations being mutually engagable and shaped such that passing of the anchorage means from the open position to the closed position, or from the closed position to the open position, is obtainable by rotation of the formation connected to the housing with respect to the formation intended to be fixed to the vehicle body.<br>
By virtue of these characteristics, the assembly according to the invention can be installed on and removed from the vehicle extremely rapidly and practically. In particular, when installed, it is able to lock the housing and the spare wheel to the vehicle body in a way that is completely reliable and without any play, even following prolonged operation of the vehicle. The jack-holder housing is thus simpler, requiring less material for its manufacture, and allows that more useful space is available within the housing. The assembly is therefore overall less costly and lighter than the previously-known assemblies, and completely avoids the risk of misplacing the locking member.<br>
A further object of the invention is a housing for supporting a jack, which can be fitted into a spare wheel of a vehicle, comprising a containment wall and a base, and releasable anchorage means for fixing to the vehicle body, fixed to the base thereof and capable of assuming a closed position in which the housing and the spare wheel are both fixed to the vehicle body, and an open position in which both the housing and the<br><br>
spare wheel are separable from the vehicle body,<br>
characterised in that the anchorage means comprise a formation connected to the housing, capable of engaging a corresponding formation fixed to the body, the formation connected to the housing being shaped such that passing of the anchorage means between the open position to the closed position, or between the closed position to the open position, can be obtained by rotating the formation connected to the housing with respect to the formation fixed to the vehicle body.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the invention will become clearer from the following detailed description, given purely by way of non-limitative example and with reference to the accompanying drawings in which:<br>

Figure 7 is an elevational sectional view of the assembly according to the invention, provided with the detail of Figure 6 and mounted on a vehicle;<br>
Figure 8 is an elevational sectional side view of a detail indicated by the arrow VIII of Figure 6; and<br>
Figure 9 is an elevational view of the detail of Figure 8 from the direction of the arrow IX.<br>
Referring initially to Figures 1 to 5, the reference numeral 1<br><br>
generally indicates a support assembly for a jack for raising a vehicle, identified in Figure 3 with the letter M.<br>
The assembly 1 comprises a housing 3, usually made from moulded plastics material, shaped so that it can be fitted into the spare wheel R located in a space V of the body of the vehicle, typically in the luggage compartment. The housing 3 can be fixed to the vehicle body, simultaneously locking the wheel R in the space V, by means of releasable anchorage means 4, generally of the bayonet-engagement type, capable of assuming a closed locked position or an open position in which the housing 3 and the spare wheel R can be removed from the space V.<br>
The anchorage means 4 comprise an engagement member 5 having a base 5a that can usually be fixed to a cup-like body 6 which extends upwards from a cavity of the space V in a position corresponding to a central hole in the wheel R, and a shaped member 13 associated with the housing 3. The engagement member 5 can be fixed to the body 6, for example, by means of a screw B inserted in an axial through-hole 14b formed therein to engage a nut N (see Figure 3), preferably of the self-locking type or provided with known anti-unscrewing means. Alternatively, the member 5 can be fixed to the body 6 using other known systems, for example, it can be adhesive bonded on the head of the cup-like body 6 or welded thereto, or the head of the cup-like body 6 can be formed with a shape corresponding to that of the member 5.<br>
In particular, the housing 3 includes a substantially cylindrical side wall 7, for example, of polygonal transverse section, having an upper portion 9 which may, for example, be a bracket shape, in which a plurality of seats for housing and locking the tools of the vehicle are formed. Typically, a series of seats 10a is formed for holding a handle for operating the jack M, a series of seats 10b is formed for holding a key for the screws fixing the wheel R to a respective hub,  and a series of seats 10c is formed for holding a<br><br>
screwdriver.<br>
On the part opposite the upper portion 9, the housing 3 has a base wall 11 intended to be disposed in frontal contact on the wheel R, specifically inside the wheel disc, from the centre of which extends a shaped circular body 13 which projects upwards to a lesser extent with respect to the base 11, The lesser height of the body 13 not only enables the housing 3 to be made using less material than previously known similar housings, but also means that more useful space is available within the housing 3. For example, other tools, such as a portable tow hitch, can be disposed in this space which, in previously known housings, due to the lack of internal space, had to be kept at the upper portion 9, with the risk of overloading this portion, causing the walls 7 to bend and giving rise to annoying vibrations.<br>
The body 13 has an upper face in which is a diametral slot-like aperture 15 having a central hole for the axial insertion of the member 5, in particular, to enable the insertion of a cylindrical guide rod 14 and a pair of wing-like elements 14a thereof which project radially from the rod 14. Advantageously, the member 5 is made in a colour that contrasts with that of the material constituting the housing 3. This facilitates the operation for inserting the member 5 through the aperture 15.<br>
A pair of arcuate cam surfaces 17, coaxial with the shaped body 13, is associated with the aperture 15 of the body 13, each of which extends over approximately 90° from an associated half-portion of the aperture 15. Each cam surface 17 comprises a first flat portion 17a, an inclined ramp 17b and a stop zone 17c intended to receive an associated wing 14a in the stationary position when the anchorage means 4 are in the closed position. An abutment 18 for stopping a wing 14a at the end of its movement over the associated cam surface 17 is present at the end of each stop zone 17c, opposite the inclined<br><br>
ramp 17b. A further abutment 18a can be formed next to a half-portion of the aperture 15 opposite an associated cam surface 17 in order to enable the wings 14a to turn only towards the cam surfaces 17.<br>
The passage of the anchorage means 4 from the closed position to the open position, or from the open position to the closed position, may also be achieved by a relative rotation of the member 5 and the cam surfaces 17. Where the cam surfaces 17 are formed integrally with the base 11 of the housing 3, this relative rotation can be achieved upon rotation of the housing 3 with respect to the vehicle body to which the member 5 is fixed. Advantageously, the housing 3 has formations to assist manual gripping and rotation thereof, for example, in the form of corrugated grip portions 20 formed on the perimetral edge of its upper portion 9. Alternatively, the cam surfaces 17 can be formed on a body rotatably mounted and axially fixed to the base 11, possibly provided with a knob for manual operation, so that the relative rotation of the cam surfaces 17 and the member 5 can be obtained by rotation of this rotatable body alone with respect to the member 5, without the need to rotate the entire housing 3.<br>
Preferably, means are provided for retaining each wing 14a with respect to an associated stop zone 17c of the body 13, in the closed position of the anchorage means 4. The retention means can be formed, as illustrated in Figures 2, 4 and 5, in the form of a pair of projections 16 which extend downward from each of the wings 14 towards the base 5a of the member 5, and a pair of corresponding seats 19 formed on each stop zone 17c, for the engagement by the projections 16. Alternatively, each stop zone 17c could be shaped to present a slight radial depression with respect to the shaped body 13, to form a seat for receiving a lower face of an associated wing 14a.<br>
In use, the member 5 is fixed to the cup-like element 6, as mentioned above. The wheel R is inserted into the space V in<br><br>
such a way that the member 5 extends from the central hole of its rim. The housing 3 can then be positioned within the cavity defined by the rim of the wheel R after possibly having inserted the jack M therein, engaging the rod 14 and the associated wings 14a in the hole 15, The housing 3 can now be manipulated by grasping the grip portions 2 0, and rotated about the general axis of the member 5 by approximately 90° in the direction indicated by the arrow A in Figures 1 and 2, in particular, without requiring any screwing operation by the user, so as to cause the wings 14a to ride over the cam surfaces 17 until the wings 14 abut against the associated abutments 18.<br>
In particular, the wings 14a rise along the inclined ramps 17b until they reach the stop zones 17c where they engage with the retention means 19.<br>
In order to release the housing 3 and, at the same time, free the wheel R, a counter-rotation of 90° in the opposite direction to that indicated by the arrow A in Figures 1 and 2 is caused so as to move the wings 14a from the stop zones 17c to the ramps 17b which now lead downward, and from these to the surfaces 17a until they make contact with the abutments 18a. The axial extraction of the housing 3 thus enables the wheel R to be released.<br>
Conveniently, an arrow or other graphic element can be stamped on or applied to the housing 3 in a position visible from the outside in order to indicate the direction of rotation necessary for its engagement and/or release with respect to the member 5.<br>
In Figures 6 to 9, in which the same reference numerals as in the embodiment described above have been used to indicate the same or similar elements thereto, there is illustrated a variation of the anchorage means 4. The details of the general structure of the housing 3 and its mounting have not been<br><br>
repeated as they are substantially identical to that described above, so that only those aspects that differ from the preceding embodiment are described below.<br>
In this case, the member 5 has a generally truncated cylindrical shape of circular section, with a helical formation on its outer surface. Preferably, this formation is formed from at least two ribs 21 constituting a two-start thread for reasons which will become clearer below. Advantageously, an axial hole passes through the body 5 for the introduction of a screw B for locking the body 5 to the cup-like body 6, extending upwards from the space V of the vehicle body.<br>
In this case, the shaped body 13 is shaped as a sleeve and is dimensioned in such a way as to enable the axial insertion therein of the member 5 and its relative rotation with little play. A plurality of radial elements 25 project from the inner surface of the body 13. In the case illustrated in Figures 6 to 9, there are two elements 25 disposed in diametrically-opposed positions with respect to the element 13. Naturally, a greater number of elements 25 can also be provided, disposed angularly and equidistant on the inner surface of the body 13, and the ribs 21 will be present in a number corresponding to that of the elements 25. In particular, each element 25 is shaped so as to be able to enter a helical channel defined between two adjacent helical ribs 21, with slight axial play.<br>
Each element 25 comprises a base part 25a in the form of a rectangular block, the general axis of which can be slightly inclined with respect to the normal plane of the axis of the body 13 in a way corresponding to the helix of the ribs 21. An upper projection 26 extends upwards (with reference to the drawings) from each base part 25a, intended to engage one of the series of notches formed on the lower flanks of the ribs 21 or on the flanks of those ribs intended to face the cup-like body 6 when the member 5 is mounted on the vehicle. Advantageously, these notches are formed by a series of axial<br><br>
millings 24 on the outer surface of the body 5 so as to interrupt its ribs 21 at constant angular intervals.<br>
A plurality of axial rebates 23 are defined at the top of the member 5, two diametrically-opposed axial rebates 23 in the case of the pair of elements 25 illustrated in the drawings, from each of which extends an associated helical channel. The rebates 23 are shaped to receive the associated element 25 following a relative axial sliding of the body 13 with respect to the member 5, after having aligned the elements 25 with the recesses 23. Each rebate 23 is delimited by an axial abutment surface 23a on the side opposite the associated helical channel so that each element 25, once inserted in the associated rebate 23, is housed in the associated helical channel, in order that the rotation between the body 13 and the member 5 is assisted in the correct screwing direction.<br>
During operation, since the member 5 is fixed to the cup-like body 6 and the body 13 fixed to the housing 3, this latter is grasped, preferably using its grip portions 20 to engage the body 13 axially on the member 5, The housing 3 is then rotated slightly until the elements 25 find the hollows 23, engaging them with a consequent axial lowering of the body 13, and thus of the housing 3, with respect to the member 5. In this arrangement, due to the presence of the abutment surfaces 23a, the rotation of the housing 3 is allowed only in the direction corresponding to travel of the elements 25 along the channels defined between the ribs 21, in the direction for screwing the housing 3 to the member 5. This screwing, which can be characterised at least in the final phase as a series of successive small steps caused by the temporary engagement of the projections 26 in the notches formed on the sides of the ribs 21, stops when the base 11 of the housing 3 engages against the wheel R in the space V of the vehicle. In this condition, a further slight rotation of the housing 3 in the same direction, causes each projection 26 to engage one of the notches formed on the lower side of the ribs 21 due to the<br><br>
reaction thrust caused by the interference between the	base 11<br>
on the wheel R,  consequently locking the rotation	of the<br>
housing 3 to the vehicle body and contemporaneously	axially<br>
locking the wheel R between the body and the housing 3.<br>
Preferably, the base wall 11 of the housing 3 is provided on its lower face intended to abut against the wheel R, with an elastically-deformable portion 11a in correspondence with the part in contact with the wheel R. The portion 11a can be constituted, for example, by a circular crown elastomeric gasket or similar substantially coaxial with the body 13 or, possibly, by sectors disposed on a circumference. The portion 11a can be formed by co-moulding during the operation for moulding the housing 3 or it can be applied to the surface of the base 11 following the formation of the housing 3 using any known connection means, for example, elastic pins which extend from the gasket and are inserted in associated holes of the base 11, or by gluing.<br>
The presence of the elastically-deformable portion 11a facilitates the engagement of the projections 26 in the notches of the ribs 21 during the locking phase at the end of the movement of the body 13 with respect to the member 5, thus also compensating for any play present between the ribs 21 and the elements 25.<br>
By virtue of the presence of the ribs 21 and the helical channels defined therebetween, the assembly of the present embodiment is extremely versatile to use since it can be used substantially regardless of the depth, or size of the section, of the wheel R, and can therefore be provided as equipment in a large number of vehicles or in different models of the same vehicle which, as is known, can have different wheels, for example, as a function of the maximum power deliverable by the power unit.<br>
In order to remove the housing 3 from the vehicle body,<br><br>
starting from its closed configuration corresponding to the locking of the wheel R, it is sufficient to rotate the housing 3 in the opposite direction to that described above, initially overcoming a resistance caused by the slightly forced engagement of the projections 2 6 in the notches of the sides of the ribs 21 in which they are held at the end of the screwing movement of the body 13 with respect to the member 5. During this initial unscrewing phase, which corresponds to the release of the projections 26 from the notches, the elastically-deformable portion 11a is temporarily compressed, but immediately reassumes its undeformed state.<br>
When the elements 25, following the unscrewing of the housing 3, correspond with the rebates 23, it is sufficient to lift the housing 3 in order for the body 13 to move axially away from the member 5, thus freeing the wheel R.<br>
In this case also, as already described in relation to the embodiment described above, the member 5 can be made in a colour contrasting with that of the housing 3 in order to facilitate the insertion of the member 5 into the body 13 at the start of the operation to fix the wheel R and the housing 3 to the vehicle body.<br><br><br>
