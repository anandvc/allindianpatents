BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing a cyclopropanecarboxylate.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
As for a method for producing a cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester by transesterification reaction, for example, a method employing a sodium alkoxide catalyst has been disclosed (JP*A-52-128336) as well as a large number of the studies on the alkoxide catalysts of transition metals euch as Ti (JP-A-52-128337, German Patent No.2822472, British Patent No.2005269).<br>
However, in any of these transesterification reaction all catalysts required anhydrous conditions due to its stability in the presence of moisture, and hence should be stored, handled and reacted in an anhydrous condition, and thus they are not always satisfactory for an industrial manufacturing.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing a cyclopropanecarboxylate readily in good yield by conducting a transesterification reaction between a cyclopropanecarboxylate and a monohydroxy compound in the presence of an alkali metal hydroxide, which method is advantageous in that said alkali metal hydroxide is not only inexpensive and readily available but also stable and can be readily handled.<br>
Thus, the present invention provides<br>
a method for producing a cyclopropanecarboxylate of formula (3):<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R8, R4 and R5 each independently represent; a hydrogen atom, halogen atom, an optionally substituted alkyl group, an optionally substituted alkenyl group, an optionally substituted aralkyl group or an optionally substituted aryl group; and R7 represents:<br>
an optionally substituted alkyl group, an optionally substituted aralkyl group, or an optionally substituted aryl group, which comprises:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4 and R5 are as defined above, and<br>
R6 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 10 carbon atoms or an optionally substituted phenyl group, with a monohydroxy compound of the formula (2):<br>
R?OH	(2)<br>
wherein R7 is the same as defined above, in the presence of an alkali metal<br><br>
ydroxide.<br>

Preferably, the hydroxides of Li, Na and K which are available readily at economical prices are employed, and lithium hydroxide is more preferred.<br>
The alkali metal hydroxide is usually employed in an anhydrous form, but may be also used in a hydrated form such as LiOH • H2O.   In addition, the alkali metal hydroxide may be added as an aqueous solution and subsequently water contained therein may be removed, for example, by distillation prior to or during the reaction.<br>
