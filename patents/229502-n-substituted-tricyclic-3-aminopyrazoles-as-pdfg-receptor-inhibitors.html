Cross Reference<br>
The present international application claims priority under from co-<br>
pending U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/380,735, filed May 15, 2002,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a novel series of N-substituted tricyclic 3-<br>
aminopyrazole compounds and the use of such compounds to treat cell<br>
proliferative disorders, such as tumors, restenosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetic<br>
retinopathy, and the like. More particularly, the compounds are inhibitors of the<br>
PDGF receptor tyrosine kinase.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Accumulating evidence supports the concept that loss of growth control<br>
of cancer cells involves perturbation of signaling pathways that in the normal<br>
cell are controlled by growth regulatory factors. Platelet-derived growth factor<br>
(PDGF) is a connective tissue cell mitogen that has been implicated in<br>
i<br>
tumorigenesis (Ostman and Heldin, Adv. Can. Res., 80:1-38, 2001, and<br>
references therein) as well as a principal player in the complex process of<br>
angiogenesis that is critical for tumor growth.<br>
PDGF exerts its cellular effects through binding to its specific receptor,<br>
PDGF-R. PDGF-R is a transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK). It<br>
consists of two isozymes a and Î². Each of these receptors has an extracellular<br>
part featuring five immunoglobulin-like domains and an intracellular part with a<br>
tyrosine kinase domain. Both a and p-containing receptors have been<br>
associated with mitogenic activity, stimulating edge ruffling and loss of stress<br><br>
fibers. Only the p-containing receptors has been associated with chemotaxis<br>
and actin reorganization (Heldin, C-H, EMBO Journal 11:4251-4259,1992).<br>
Binding of PDGF to PDGF-R results in dimerization of the two subunits<br>
of the PDGF-R receptors, thereby allowing autophosphorylation of each subunit<br>
on specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain. The<br>
autophosphorylation leads to increased kinase activity and produces docking<br>
sites for a large number of signaling molecules with SH2 domains, such as<br>
Grb2/Sos1, PLC-gamma, GAP, PI-3 kinase and Src. (Heldin et al., Biochem.<br>
Biophys. Acta 1378:F79-113, 1998, and references therein). Upon binding to<br>
PDGF-R, these SH2 domain-containing signaling molecules initiate signal<br>
transduction pathways that are involved in different cellular responses such as<br>
cell proliferation, cell mobility, cell permeability or apoptosis.<br>
PDGF has several important cellular effects in vivo. It regulates cell<br>
growth, differentiation, and migration during embryonal development, and plays<br>
a possible role in neuroprotection and regeneration. It also stimulates wound<br>
healing in adults. In addition, PDGF also has specialized functions in the<br>
vascular system as well as in the homeostasis of connective tissue (Ostman<br>
and Heldin, Adv. Can. Res., 80:1-38, 2001, and references therein).<br>
Overactivity of PDGF has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a<br>
number of serious diseases, including cancers (glioma, lung, breast, colorectal,<br>
prostate, gastric and esophageal, leukemias and lymphomas), and other cell<br>
proliferative disorders, such as atherosclerosis, transplantation-induced<br>
vasculopathies, neointima formation, lung fibrosis, restenosis, pulmonary<br>
fibrosis, glomerulonephritis, glomerulosclerosis, congenital multicystic renal<br>
dysplasia, kidney fibrosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (Ostman A, Heldin CH., Adv.<br>
Cancer Res, 80:1-38, 2001, and references therein).<br>
A considerable body of direct and indirect experimental evidence<br>
showed that sustained tumor growth and metastasis are angiogenesis-<br>
dependent (see e.g., Hanahan, Science, 277:48-50, 1997). Angiogenesis is<br><br><br>
the development of new vasculature from preexisting blood vessels and/or<br>
circulating endothelial stem cells (see i.e.. Springer et al., 1998). Angiogenesis<br>
plays a vital role in many physiological processes, such as embryogenesis,<br>
wound healing and menstruation. Angiogenesis also appears to be important in<br>
certain pathological events, such as solid tumor growth and metastasis,<br>
arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic retinopathy (Hanahan and Folkman, Cell,<br>
86(3):353-364,1996;).<br>
Anti-angiogenic therapy is currently being studied as a way to interfere<br>
with tumor growth. Indeed, numerous studies in animal models have<br>
demonstrated striking effects in tumor growth inhibition by targeting angiogenic<br>
growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), acidic and<br>
basic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF, bFGF) and PDGF. The receptors for<br>
VEGF and PDGF belong to one super family of receptor tyrosine kinases.<br>
Therefore, in addition to their role in treating other cell proliferative disorders,<br>
clinically useful PDGF-R tyrosine kinase inhibitors are useful for antiangiogenic<br>
therapy and to control tumor cell proliferation.<br>
Small molecule inhibitors of the receptor tyrosine kinase constitute a<br>
novel class of drugs with large potential (Druker and Lydon, J. Clin. Invest.,<br>
105:3-7, 2000, and references therein). Since 1995, a number of small<br>
molecule inhibitors for PDGF receptor autophosphorylation have been<br>
characterized. Some examples are listed below.<br>
JP 06087834 (Zimmermann) discloses N-phenyl-2-pyrimidine-amine<br>
derivatives which have tumor inhibitory activity and are useful for treating<br>
tumors in warm-blooded animals including human beings. Derivatives of this<br>
group of compounds, compound CGP53716 (Buchdunger et al., PNAS,<br>
92:2558-2562,1995) and compound STI-571 (Buchdunger et al., Cancer Res,<br>
56:100-4,1996), have been shown to inhibit PDGF-R autophosphorylation.<br>
JP 11158149 (Kubo et al.) discloses quinoline derivatives for the treatmenl<br>
diseases such as tumors and diabetic retinopathy. Derivatives of this group of<br><br><br>
compounds, compound Ki6783 (Yagi et al., Exp. Cell Res. 243:285-292, 1997) and<br>
compound Ki6896 (Yagi et al., Gen. Pharmacol. 31:765-773, 1998), have been shown<br>
inhibit PDGF-R autophosphorylation.<br>
US5932580 (Levitzki et al.) discloses PDGF receptor kinase inhibitory<br>
compounds of the quinoxaline family including Tyrphostin, ATP-cbmpetitive<br>
inhibitors of the receptor kinase.<br>
US5409930 (Spada, et al.) discloses bis mono- and/or bicyclic aryl<br>
and/or heteroaryl compounds exhibiting protein tyrosine kinase inhibition<br>
activity. Compound RPR101511A, a derivative of this group of compound, has<br>
been shown to inhibit PDGF-R autophosphorylation (Bilder et al., Circulation.<br>
99(25):3292-9.1999).<br>
US 5563173 (Yatsu, et al.) discloses a method of inhibiting the<br>
proliferation of smooth muscle cells by sodium butyrate, which inhibits PDGF-R<br>
kinase activity.<br>
US5476851 (Myers, et al.) discloses Pyrazolo[3,4-g]quinoxaline<br>
compounds, as PDGF receptor protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors.<br>
Compound SU-6668, an ATP competitive inhibitor, has been shown to<br>
inhibit PDGF-R autophosphorylation (Laird, et al., Cancer Res. 60:4152-4160,<br>
2000].<br>
WO01/79198 (Reich et al.) discloses amino-pyrazole compounds of the<br>
following formula that modulate and/or inhibit the activity of protein kinases.<br><br><br>
WO0212242 (Fancelli et al.) discloses bicyclo-pyrazole compounds that<br>
are useful for treating diseases linked to disregulated protein kinases.<br>
Up to now, STI-571 (GLEEVEC) is the only compound to reach market<br>
with significant PDGFR activity, although it is not a selective antagonist of this<br>
enzyme. Therefore, PDGF-R remains an extremely attractive target for the<br>
design of potent and selective small molecule inhibitors that will represent an<br>
important new class of therapeutic agents for the treatment of tumors and other<br>
cell proliferative disorders.<br>

In general, IUPAC nomenclature rules are used throughout this<br>
disclosure. Nomenclature for radical substituents is derived by first indicating<br>
the functionality having the point of attachment with a hyphen, followed by the<br>
adjacent functionality toward the terminal portion of the side chain, as in:<br>
-(Ci.io)alkyl-C(0)NH-(Ci-io)alkyl-Phenyl       ,<br>
or, when a lead hyphen is not used, by describing the terminal portion of the<br>
side chain first, followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of<br>
attachment, as in:<br>
phenyl-(Ci.io)alkylamido(Cii0)alkyl, or<br>
phenylalkylamidoalkyl<br><br><br>
Where the are two point of attachment, for example in a linking group, or<br>
a ring member, the two points of attachment are indicated with a lead hyphen<br>
and a final hypen. For example, the points of attachment of a linking group<br>
having two monvalent radical centers would be indicated as -(CH2)2- or<br>
-0(CH2)2- and the like; and the points of attachment of a linking group having a<br>
single divalent radical center would be indicated as -NH- or -N(C=0 alkyl)- and<br>
the like. Points of attachment for an aromatic ring member would be indicated<br>
as -N-., -S-br-CH- and the like, for example.<br>
Where the phrase "terminating with" is used, the point of attachment<br>
for the terminal substitucnt is indicated by the second dash. For example, for<br>
the phrase "-C{-0)-(CH2CH20-)i-io terminating with -H. methyl, ethyl, or<br>
benzyl" the point of attachment for the selected terminal substituent is the<br>
terminal oxygen, for example, -C(=0)-(CH2CH2OH) or -C(=0)-<br>
(CH*CH20CH2CH2OCH2CHoOCH3).<br>
When a particular group is "substituted" (e.g., phenyl, aryl, heteroalkyl,<br>
heteroaryl), that group may have one or more substituents, preferably from one<br>
to five substituents, more preferably from one to three substituents, most<br>
preferably from one to two substituents, independently selected from the list of<br>
substituents.<br>
With reference to substituents, the term "independently" means that<br>
when more than one of such substituents is possible, such substituents may be<br>
the same or different from each other.<br>
It is intended that the definition of any substituent or variable at a particular<br>
location in a molecule be independent of its definitions elsewhere in that<br>
molecule. It is understood that substituents and substitution patterns on the<br>
4-9 4<br><br>

nO     (lis).<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula (T24) and (T25) as a mixture are<br>
reacted with a suitably substituted amine, a compound of formula (T26), to yield<br>
a mixture of compounds of formula (Mr) and (lis). The compounds of formula<br>
15     (Mr) and (lis) are then separated by known methods, for example by silica gel<br>
column chromatography or reverse phase column.<br>
Both sequences give the desired compounds of formula (llr) and (lis).<br>
Preparation of a library of compounds is achieved more efficiently by reacting<br>
20     the compounds of formula (T24) and (T25) separately than by reacting a<br>
mixture of compounds of formula (T24) and (T25) followed by separation..<br>
N-Glucuronide Synthesis<br>
To varying degrees the compounds of this invention may undergo the in<br>
25     vivo N-glucuronidation by various endogenous isozymes of the UDP-<br>
glucuronosyltransferase family (Chiu, S-HL; Huskey, S-EW; 1996ASPETN-<br>
glucuronidation of xenobiotics symposium: Species differences in N-<br>
glucuronidation, Drug Metabolism and Disposition 1998, 26(9): 838-847).<br>
30	One skilled in the art will understand that in vivo metabolites of<br>
compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) may be readily reverted to compounds of<br>
Formulae (1) and (II) by action of endogenous p-glucuronidase. The scientific<br>
literature details that tumor tissue generally contains elevated levels of<br><br>
endogenous p-glucuronidase. By action of endogenous ^-glucuronidase, the in<br>
situ re-generation of compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) can be accomplished.<br>
In this way, the ability of the compounds of the present invention to be<br>
reversibly glucuronidated allows for the targeting of the present compounds to<br>
tumor tissue (Sperker, B; Backman, JT; Kroemer, HK, The role of p-<br>
glucuronidase in drug disposition and drug targeting in humans, Clin.<br>
Pharmacokinet., 1997, 33(1): 18-31).<br>
Furthermore, reversible glucuronidation of the present compounds may<br>
also be recognized by one skilled in the art as a potential method for the<br>
detoxification of compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) (Caldwell, J; The<br>
significance of phase II conjugation reactions in drug disposition and toxicity,<br>
Life Sci, 1979, 24: 571-578), thus allowing the N-glucuronide metabolites<br>
formed to serve as a potential non-toxic reservoir for compounds of Formulae<br>
(I) and (II) which can then be readily unmasked to fully biologically active<br>
compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) in situ by tumor associated p-<br>
glucuronidase.<br><br><br><br>
Usually, the glucuronidated compounds will have a ^-configuration about<br>
the anomeric carbon atom, especially if the glucuronide is produced by well-<br>
established enzymatic methods known to persons skilled in the art (Luukkanen,<br>
L; Kilpelaeinen, I; Kangas, H; Ottoila, P; Elovaara, E; Taskinen, J, Enzyme-<br>
Assisted Synthesis and Structural Characterization of Nitrocatechol<br>
Glucuronides, Bioconjugate Chemistry (1999), 10(1), 150-154).<br>
The N-glucuronides may also be prepared by direct synthesis by<br>
reacting compounds of Formulae (I) and (II) with suitably protected<br>
glucuronosyl halides by synthetic methodology know to persons skilled in the<br>
art (Upadhyaya, Pramod; Mclntee, Edward J.; Hecht, Stephen S., Preparation<br><br>
of Pyridine-N-glucuronides of Tobacco-Specific Nitrosamines., Chemical<br>
Research in Toxicology (2001), 14(5). 555-561).<br>
