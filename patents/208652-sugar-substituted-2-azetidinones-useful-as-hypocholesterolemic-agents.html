SUGAR-SUBSTITUTED 2-AZETIDINONES USEFUL AS HYPOCHOLESTEROLEMIC AGENTS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to sugar-substituted 2-azetidinones useful as hypocholesterolemic agents in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis, and to a combination of a sugar-substituted 2-a2etidinone of this invention and a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.<br>
Atherosclerotic coronary heart disease represents the major cause for death and cardiovascular morbidity in the western world. Risk factors for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease include hypertension, diabetes mellitus, family history, male gender, cigarette smoke and serum cholesterol. A total cholesterol level in excess of 225-250 mg/dl is associated with significant elevation of risk.<br>
Cholesteryl esters are a major component of atherosclerotic lesions and the major storage form of cholesterol in arterial wall cells. Formation of cholesteryl esters is also a key step in the intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol. In addition to regulation of dietary cholesterol, the regulation of whole-body cholesterol homeostasis in hurnans and animals involves modulation of cholesterol biosynthesis, bile acid biosynthesis, and the catabolism of the cholesterol-containing plasma lipoproteins. The liver is the major organ responsible for cholesterol biosynthesis and catabolism and, for this reason, it is a prime determinant of plasma cholesterol levels. The liver is the site of synthesis and secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLUL) which are subsequently metabolized to low density lipoproteins (LDL) in the circulation. LDL are the predominant cholesterol-carrying lipoproteins in the plasma and an increase in their concentration Is correlated with increased atherosclerosis.<br>
When cholesterol absorption in the intestines is reduced, by whatever means, less cholesterol is delivered to the liver. The consequence of this action is<br><br>
a decreased hepatic lipoprotein (VLDL) production and an increase in the hepatic clearance of plasma cholesterol, mostly as LDL. Thus, the net effect of an inhibition of intestinal cholesterol absorption is a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels.<br>
Several 2-azetidinone compounds have been reported as being useful in lowering cholesterol and/or in inhibiting the formation of cholesterol-containing lesions in mammalian arterial walls: WO 93/02048 describes 2-azetidinone compounds wherein the 3-position substituent is arylalkylene, arylalkenylene or aryialkylene wherein the alkylene. alkenylene or alkyleneportion is interrupted by a hetero atom, phenyiene or cycloaikyiene; WO 94/17038 describes 2-azetidinone compounds wherein the 3-position substituent is an arylaikylspirocydic group; WO 95/08532 describes 2-azetidinone compounds wherein the 3-position substituent is an aryialkylene group substituted in the alkylene portion by a hydroxy group; PCT/US95/03196 describes compounds wherein the 3-position substituent is an aryl(oxo or thio)alkylene group substituted in the alkylene portion by a hydroxy group; and U.S. Serial No. 08/463,619, filed June 5, 1995, describes the preparation of compounds wherein the 3-position substituent is an aryialkylene group substituted in the alkylene portion by a hydroxy group, and wherein the alkylene group is attached to the azetidinone ring by a -S(O)o.2- group.<br>
Also, European Patent 199,63061 and European Patent Application 337,549A1 disclose elastase inhibitory substituted azetidinones useful in treating inflammatory conditions resulting In tissue destruction which are associated with various disease states, e.g., atherosclerosis.<br>
Other known hypocholesterolemics include plant extracts such as sapogenins. in particular tigogenin and diosgenin. Glycoside derivatives of tigogenin and/or diosgenin are disclosed in WO 94/00480 and WO 95/18143.<br>
The inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC1,1,1.34) inhibitors has been shown to be an effective way to reduce plasma cholesterol (Witzum, Circulation, 80,5 (1989), p. 1101-1114) and reduce atherosclerosis. Combination therapy of an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor and a bile add sequestrant has been demonstrated to be more effective in<br><br>
human hypedipidemic patients than either agent in monotherapy (llling worth, Drugs, 36 (Suppl. 3) (1988), p. 63-71).<br>

"Alkenyl" means straight or branched carbon chains having one or more double bonds in the chain, conjugated or unconjugated. Similariy, "alkynyl" means straight or branched carbon chains having one or more triple bonds in the chain. Where an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chain joins two other variables and is therefore bivalent, the tenns alkylene. alkenylene and alkynylene are used.<br>
"CycloalkyI" means a saturated carbon ring of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, while "cycloalkylene" refers to a corresponding bivalent ring, wherein the points of attachment to other groups include all positional isomers.<br>
"Halogeno" refers to fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine radicals.<br>
"Aryl" means, phenyl, naphthyl* indenyl. tetrahydronaphthyl or indanyl. "Phenylene" means a bivalent phenyl group, including ortho, meta and para-substitution.<br><br>

R24-benzyl and R24-benzyloxy refer to benzyl and benzyloxy radicals which are substituted on the phenyl ring.<br>
The above statements, wherein, for example, R19, R20 and R25 are said to be independently selected from a group of substituents, means that R19, R20 and R25 are independently selected, but also that where an R19. R20 or R25 variable occurs more than once in a molecule, those occurrences are independently selected (e.g., if R10 is -0R19 wherein R19 is hydrogen, R11' can be -OR19 wherein R19 is lower alkyl). Those skilled in the art will recognize that the size and nature of the substituent(s) will affect the number of substituents which can be present.<br>
Compounds of the invention have at least one asymmetrical carbon atom and therefore all isomers, including diastereomers and rotational isomers are contemplated as being part of this invention. The invention includes a and p stereoisomers in optically pure form and in admixture, including racemic mixtures. Isomers can be prepared using conventional techniques, either by reacting optically pure or optically enriched starting materials or by separating isomers of a compound of formula I.<br>
Compounds of the invention with an amino group can form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with organic and inorganic acids. Examples of suitable organic and inorganic acids for salt fonmation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic. salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other organic and inorganic carboxylic acids well known to those in the art. The salt is prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. The free base form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium bicart3onate. The free base form differs from its respective salt form somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salt is otherwise equivalent to its respective free base fomis for purposes of the Invention,<br><br>
Certain compounds of the invention are acidic (e.g., those compounds which possess a carboxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. Examples of such salts are the sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, gold and silver salts. Also included are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br>
Cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors for use in combination with compounds of the present invention include HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin. NK-104 (itavastatin), and ZD4522; HMG CoA synthetase inhibitors, for example L-659,699 ((E.E-11-[3'R-(hydroxy-methyl)-4'-oxo-2'R-oxetanyI]-3,5,7R-trimethyl-2,4-undecadienoic acid); squalene synthesis inhibitors, for example squalestatin 1; and squalene epoxidase inhibitors, for example, NB-598 ((E)-N-ethyl-N-(6,6-dimethyl-2-hepten-4-ynyl)-3-[(3,3'-bithiophen-5-yl)methoxy]benzene-methanamine hydrochloride). Preferred HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are lovastatin. pravastatin, fluvastatin, aton/astatin and simvastatin. The HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin is most prefemed.<br>
The cholesterol-lowering 2-a2etidinone portions of the compounds of fonmula I can be prepared by known methods.<br>
Sugars and the derivatives thereof as defined by R1 the substituents defined<br>
above, are known in the art or are readily prepared by known methods.<br>
Preferably, the reactions described above invoive a sugar derivative wherein the non-reactive hydroxy groups are protected by suitable protecting groups as defined above for R2. R3, R3a, R4, R4a, R5 and R7 other than hydrogen, preferably lower alkyl, acetyl or benzyl, which groups can be removed after the reaction to provide the sugar conjugate. When the 1- and 4-position side chains of the 2-azetidinone include substituent groups which are reactive under the conditions used, said reactive groups are protected by suitable protecting groups prior to reaction with the sugar or the derivative thereof, and the protecting groups are subsequently removed. Depending on the nature of the protecting groups, the protecting groups on the sugar portion and on the 1- and 4-position side chains of the azetidinone can be removed sequentially or simultaneously.<br><br>
Reactive groups not involved in the above processes can be protected during the reactions with conventional protecting groups which can be removed by standard procedures after the reaction. The following Table 1 shows some typical protecting groups:<br><br>
Compared to the 2-azetidinone cholesterol lowering agents which are not sugar-substituted, the compounds of this invention have several pharmacological and physical advantages. The compounds are absorbed at a slower rate, give lower plasma levels and higher intestinal levels. Previous testing indicated the intestine as the likely site of activity of the 2-azetidinone compounds lacking a sugar substituent See van Heek, M. et ai, "In vivo mechanism-based discovery of a potent cholesterol absorption inhibitor (SCH 58235) through the identification of the active metabolites of SCH 48461 / J. Pharmacol Exp. Ther., 283 (1997), pp. 157-163, and van Heek M. et al, "Comparison of the activity and deposition of the novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, SCH 58235, and Its glucuronide," Br. J. Pharmacol., 129, (2001) pp. 1748-1754. The instantly claimed compounds, which<br><br>
are excreted in the bile, provide efficient delivery of the compound to the desired site while minimizing systemic exposure, thereby decreasing potential toxicity problems.<br>
In addition to the compound aspect, the present invention also relates to a method of lowering plasma cholesterol levels, which method comprises administering to a mammal in need of such treatment a hypocholesterolemic effective amount of a compound of formula I of this invention. The compound is preferably administered in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier suitable for oral administration.<br>
The present invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compounds of formula I can be administered in any conventional oral dosage form such as capsules, tablets, powders, cachets, suspensions or solutions. The formulations and pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared using conventional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and additives and conventional techniques. Such pharmaceutically acceptable excipients and additives include non-toxic compatible fillers, binders, disintegrants, buffers, preservatives, anti-oxidants, lubricants, flavorings, thickeners, coloring agents, emulsifiers and the like.<br>
The effective amount of a compound of formula I is in the range of about 0.001 to about 30 mg/kg of body weight per day, pewferably about 0,001 to about 1 mg/kg in single or divided doses. For an average body weight of 70 kg, the effective amount is therefore from about 0.1 to about 100 mg of drug per day, given in a single dose or 2-4 divided doses. The exact dose, however, is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent on the potency of the compound administered, the age, weight, condition and response of the patient<br>
For the combinations of this invention wherein the substituted azetidinone is administered in combination with a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor, the typical daily dose of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor is 0.1 to 80 mg/kg of mammalian weight per day administered in single or divided dosages, usually once or twice a day: for example, for HMG CoA reductase Inhibitors, about 10 to about 40 mg per dose is given 1 to 2 times a day, giving a total daily dose of about 10 to 80 mg per<br><br>
day, and for the other cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors, about 1 to 1000 mg per dose is given 1 to 2 times a day, giving a total daily dose of about 1 mg to about 2 g per day. The exact dose of any component of the combination to be administered is determined by the attending clinician and is dependent on the potency of the compound administered, the age, weight, condition and response of the patient.<br>
Where the components of a combination are administered separately, the number of doses of each component given per day may not necessarily be the same. e.g. where one component may have a greater duration of activity, and will therefore need to be administered less frequently.<br>
Since the present invention relates to the reduction of plasma cholesterol levels by treatment with a combination of active ingredients wherein said active ingredients may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. That is, a kit is contemplated wherein two separate units are combined: a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitor pharmaceutical composition and a sugar-substituted 2-azetidinone absorption inhibitor pharmaceutical composition. The kit will preferably include directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form is particularly advantageous when the separate components must be administered in different dosage forms (e.g. oral and parenteral) or are administered at different dosage intervals.<br>
We have found that the compounds of this invention lower plasma lipid levels and hepatic cholesterol ester levels. Compounds of this invention have been found to inhibit the intestinal absorption of cholesterol and to significantly reduce the formation of liver cholesteryl esters in animal models. Thus, compounds of this invention are hypocholesterolemic agents by virtue of their ability to inhibit the esterification and/or intestinal absorption of cholesterol; they are therefore useful In the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis in mammals, in particular in humans.<br>
Compounds 6A and Example 1 below disclosed in US Patent Nos. 5,767,115 and 5,756,470 respectively, demonstrate pharmacological activity as hypocholesterolemic agents.<br><br><br>
The in vivo activity (see Table 1 below) of the compounds 6A and Example 1 above, can be determined by the following procedure. In Vivo Assay of Hypolipidemic Agents Using the Hyperlipidemic Hamster<br>
Hamsters are separated into groups of six and ^jiven a controlled cholesterol diet (Purina Chow #5001 containing 0.5% cholesterol) for seven days. Diet consumption is monitored to determine dietary cholesterol exposure in the presence of test compounds. The animals are dosed with the test compound once daily beginning wfth the initiation of diet Dosing is by oral gavage of 0.2mL of corn oil alone (control group) or solution (or suspension) of test compound in corn oil. All animals moribund or in poor physical condition are euthanized.   After seven days, the animals are anesthetized by IM injection of ketamine and sacrificed by decapitation. Blood is collected into Vacutainer™ tubes containing EDTA for plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride analysis and the liver excised for free and esterified cholesterol and triglyceride tissue analysis. Data is reported as percent<br><br>
reduction of plasma cholesterol and hepatic cholesterol esters versus control levels.<br>
Data is reported as percent change (i.e., percent reduction in plasma cholesterol and in hepatic cholesterol esters) versus control, therefore, negative numbers indicate a positive cholesterol-lowering effect. The assay results are shown in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Experiment 3 described below demonstrates that both the compound of formula HI and Example 1 yield Compound 6A (all shown herein above) following hydrolysis with p-glucuronidase. Experiment Nos. 1 and 2 confirm that Compound 6A yields both Example 1 and the compound of formula IE following incubations of Compound 6A with Gl tract microsomes or UGT2B7. Since both Compound 6A and Example 1 are shown to demonstrate pharmacological activity (Table 1). the compounds of formulas I, n and in of the present invention are expected to exert similar pharmacological activity.<br>
Experimental<br>
1.  Incubations of Compound 6A with pooled human liver microsomes (n=10) supplemented with Uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronic acid (UDPGA) yielded one Compound 6A-glucuronide (retention time -7 min) consistent with Example 1 (phenolic glucuronide). However, incubations of Compound 6A with pooled (n=4) and two individuals human jejunum microsomes supplemented with UDPGA yielded two distinct Compound 6A-glucuronides (retention ti'nes -7 and -9 min) consistent with Example 1 (phenolic) and Compound in (benzylic) glucuronides, respectively. LC/MS analysis showed that both peaks have m/z 584.<br><br>
2.	Compound 6A was incubated with commercially available 9 recombinant cDNA<br>
expressed human UDP-Glucuronosyltransferases (UGT supersomes) in the<br>
presence of UDPGA (TABLE 2). Supersomes UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 yielded<br>
exclusively Example 1. Incubations with UGT2B7 supersomies yielded mainly<br>
Compound in accompanied by a small amount of Example 1.<br><br>
3.	p-Glucuronidase hydrolysis of the mixture of Example 1 and Compound HI<br>
(Compound 6A-benzylic glucuronides) obtained from jejunum microsomes (5,<br>
10, 20, 30 and 180 min, TABLE 3) demonstrates that Example 1 was<br>
hydroiyzed at a faster rate than Compound HI. After hydrolyzing for 18h, both<br>
peaks were hydroiyzed to form a single Compound 6A peak.<br><br><br><br>
Scale Up Production and Stmcture Identification of Compound HI<br>
Scale-up Preparation and Extraction of Compound in Scale up production of Compound in was performed using 1.23 mg (0.05 mM) of 14C-SCH 58235 and 60 mg protein of cDNA expressed recombinant human UGT2B7 supersomes supplemented with UDPGA (2 mM) in 60 ml Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The incubation was carried out for 2 hr at 37°C and subjected to solid phase extraction (SPE). The methanol elution from SPE was dried and Compound EI was further purified as described below.<br><br>
Isolation of Compound HI for LC/NMR Analysis Compound in was isolated using preparative HPLC with fraction collection. The dried residue from SPE methanol elution was reconstituted in ca. 3 mL of CH3OH and centrifuged (16,000 g) to remove solid precipitate. Methanol was evaporated and the residue redissolved in ca. 2 mL of CHaOHrDMSO (20:80, v:v). The preparative HPLC column (Inertsil C8, 250 x 20 mm) provided a retention time of ca. 15.0 and 20.6 min for Example 1 and Compound HI. respectively. Compound ni was isolated using 200 pL injections (10 in total) onto the preparative column collecting 0.5 min fractions. Compound in eluted in fractions numbered 37 (18.5 min) through 44 (22.0 min) for each injection. These fractions were within the observed retention time for the Compound HI were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. The fractions (18.5 - 22 min) were combined and dried.<br>
Determination of Structure of Compound in bv LC/NMR LC-NMR was carried out using mobile phases of 20 mM ammonium acetate-da (pH 7.0) and acetonitriie. The HPLC gradient was 30% acetonitrile for 10 minutes, and then went up to 40% for 20 minutes. The metabolite eluted at approximately 10 minute. LC-NMR was conducted in stop-flow mode on the metabolite peak apex. ID proton and 2D proton-proton correlation spectra were recorded on Varian 600 MHz NMR spectrometer at 20°C. Corresponding NMR data were obtained on synthetic standards Compound 6A and Example 1 (Compound 6A-phenolic glucuronide). Based on the NMR data of the sample and the comparison with those from the standards, the proton assignments for this metabolite (MW 585) were made. The structure of this metabolite was identified to be Compound 6A-benzylic-glucuronide (Compound HI).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
