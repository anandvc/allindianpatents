				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for extraction of carotenoides from Rhodotorula gracilis cells.<br>
There is a considerable interest worldwide in the development of food colourants from natural sources. This is apparently due to strong consumer demand for more natural<br>
Colourants is associated with their image of being healthy and good quality. In addition there are a lot of concerns about safety of certain additives and legislation governing the use of synthetic colours.<br>
As a result of deficiencies of natural food colourants such as instability against light, heat, pH, the demand for alternative sources of natural pigment is repeatedly raised by the food industry Hence the search for alternative colourants- the microbial sources.<br>
During the past ten years,much interest and effort has been devoted to designating and developing microbial source for industrially important carotenoides. Microbial synthesis could provide a significant proportion of the pigment used in terrestrial agriculture and marine agriculture and potentially as human nutrient or neutraceuticals.<br><br>
Caroicnoids arc group of pigments that contribute to the yellow, orange or red colouration of fruits and vegetables. They are telra terpcnoids compounds which contain 40 Carbon atoms arranged in a repeating pattern of 5 carbon units. As pigments in food products, fi- carotene and other carotenoids are very useful, because of their high colour intensity and low toxicity.<br>
Natural colours such as carotenoids have various biological functions apart from acting as a colourant. For many years, the health benefits of carotenoids focused predominantly on the vitamin A activity of P-carotene. Today, many natural carotenoids are being investigated for their role in a \anety of health benefits. Cumulative evidences from epidemiological studies shows a lower risk to a variety of chronic diseases including various cancer, cardiovascular disease, age related macular degeneration and cataracts.<br>
Most of these carotenoids find their application in food, feed, nutritional supplement, cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries. In, food, they arc widely used in beverages, dry canned soups, dairy products such as cheese, ice cream and yogurt, desserts like jellies, pudding, confectionary<br>
*•<br>
products, egg products and pastries and other bakery products.<br>
Rhodoionila graci/is CFR 1 is a natural isolate from the Culture Colleelion Centre, Food Microbiology Dept, CFTRI, Mysore.<br>
Rliodotornlu grctcilis belonging to the group of imperfect yeast. The cells of Rliotlotorula species are spherical. ovoid or elongate. They reproduce asexually by multilateral budding. It is a oleaginous yeast.<br>
C'arotenoid synthesis is a characteristic feature of R.grucilis. It produces a mi\lure of carotenoids p-carotene. lorulene and lorularhodine. The p carotene has attracted commercial interest as a yellow colorant for food in addition to vitamin A precursor.<br>
Carotenoids are synthesized in the cytoplasm and always present in the association \\ith lipids. These carotenoids are intracellular and needs breakage of cell walls for the release of carotenoids. The cell wall of R. gracilis is very rigid and consists of 70% of mannose and 20% of glucan and some amount of chitin. For the extraction of carotenoids. normally manual methods are being used to rupture the cell walls. However, these methods are highly laborious and consume a lot of organic soh ent.<br>
After harvesting the biomass, the cells are extracted for carotenoids. Normally they are either stored at 4°C or frozen. Under these conditions, if it is stored for a longer time, decolonisation of biomass occurs. When the frozen samples is thawed to room temperature for extraction, loss of pigment<br>
oceurs. Hence, in the present invention where in R. graci/is biomass is treated at different temperatures which, prevents the loss of pigment and also the cells can be stored for a longer period of time. A modified of extraction method is used here which is simple and easy.<br>
Reference may be made to the Indian pending patent No.382/L)el/2001 where in the extraction of carotenoids is by manual grinding with neutral sand and solvents.<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Han R.P , Patel Tand Martin A.M.(1992) A new strain of Rhodotorula rubra isolated from yoghurt.J. Industrial Microbiol.l 1, 43-45, where in the carotenoids was extracted by rupturing the cells in a French press at an internal cell pressure of 32000 psi. Ruptured cells are extracted with acetone and then with petroleum ether 60 -80"C. The drawback of this method is, the extraction is cumbersome using French press and consumption of solvents is more..<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Frengova G,Simova E.Beshkova D,and Grigorova D(1994) Formation of carotenoids by Rhodotonilu glutinis in Whey Ultra 111 irate. Biotechnol Bioeng.44, 888-894. where in, wet cells collected by centrifugalion is subjected to destruction in a Gaulin homogeniser at a temperature of 8 10°C under a pressure of 50 Mpa. Then the carotenoids are extracted with acetone ratio<br>
2:1 for 5 limes. Then again separated with petroleum ether. This method is too lengthv.<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Vijayalakshmi G. Shoba B.Vanajakslu V, Divaker S, and Manohar B (2001) Response surface methodology for optimization of growth parameters for the production of carotenoids by a mutant strain of R.gracilis.Eur.Food.Res.Tech .213, 234-239, \\here in the carotenoids are extracted from R.gracilis by grinding the cells \\ith acetone, extracted it with hexane, followed by petroleum ether. In this method, the consumption of solvents is very high and grinding of cells is very tedious job. Exposure to solvents is another problem.<br>
Reference may be made to the work carried out by Martin A M, Chun Lu, and Patel RT(1993) Growth parameters for the Yeast Rhodotorula rubra grown in Peat extracts. J. Ferment Bioeng .4, 321-325, where in the yeast cells are ruptured dimethyl sulphoxide, carotenoids were extracted with diethyl ether.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide an effective method of retention of carotenoids in Rhodotorula gracilis cells and its extraction which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above<br>

Cultivation of R.gracHis:<br>
Rhodoioru/d grcicHis CFR 1 was cultivated in 500ml Erlenmeyer llasks containing 100ml of 1 to 2 % Enebose medium, which serves as the initial inoculum. A calculated amount of 20 - 24h old inoculum was inoculated into the llask containing the growth medium. This was incubated on a rotary shaker (150 to250 rpm) for a period of 5 to 7 days at 28 ±2 "C. At the end of fermentation, yeast was harvested by centrifugation (5000-7000 rpm) for 10 lo 15 minutes, washed twice with distilled water (70 to 75% moisture).<br>
Extraction of carotenoids:<br>
a)	Treatment of cells at low temperature:<br>
The washed cells were spread as a thin layer on a petriplate and is kept at 4(IC overnight (20 to 24 hrs) where in the colour of the cells are intensified. The moisture content of the cells is around 3 to 5 %<br>
b)	Treatment of cells at higher temperature:<br>
The Hakes of R. gracilis cells are further dried at28 to 32 "C for 24 hrs to a moisture content of 1 to 2 %.<br>
c)	Powdering of R. gracilis:<br>
llie dried cells are collected and ground into a fine powder using a dry m'inder.<br>
d)	Extraction of total carotenoids:<br>
Known quantity of fine powder is taken in a test tube /IIask to which 10ml of solvent is added, left at room temperature for 1 hr. This solvent treatment was repeated 3 times at an interval of 1 hr, and then left at 28 t 2 "C over night for 18 to 24 hr at 30 tO 32°C. Maximum amount of carotenoid is extracted by then. All the concerned solvent extracts are pooled together and passed through a bed of anhydrous sodium sulphate. This clear carotenoid extract was flash evaporated at 30 to 35(IC with 120 rpm under 500 IBC vacuum to dryness and slowly to 350 IBC vaccum.The extract is taken in 10 to 2o ml of chloroform for estimation.<br>
e)	Estimation of carotenoids:<br>
The carotenoid content were estimated by absorption spectrum of the carotenoid solution at 460 nm. A molar extinction coefficient value of ()9330cm 1 mol obtained from an average value of E from ten carotenoids (lycopene, a - carotene, p1- carotene, 8- carotene, Zeaxanthin, rhodoxanthm, astaxanthin. Lutein. p- apo-2 carotenal dihydro P-carotene ) was used in the following equation for determining the percentage of carotenoid present in the sample.<br>
Percentage of carotenoids = 5.405 x 10"4 x (A460 X/Y), where A460 is the absorbance of X ml of solution obtained from Y g of dry cells. The dry<br>
weight of the cells employed was determined from the estimated moisture content of the wet cells.<br>
Ultraviolet visible spectroscopic measurement were earned out using a IIV-1 60 recording Spectrophotometer (Shimad/u. Japan).<br>
Example 1<br>
1.0 g of wet cells are taken in a pestle and mortar. Two spatula (10 g) lull of acid and alkali washed sand (neutral sand) was added to the cells. 20 ml of acetone was added to the mixture and ground with the pestle. Then 15 ml of hexane is added and the extract is collected in the cylinder. Another 20 ml of acetone is added to the cells, ground.to a fine mass. 15 ml of hexane is added and the extract is decanted into the cylinder. The cells are further extracted with 30 ml of diethyl ether. The cells are repeatedly extracted with diethyl ether till the cells become colourless. All the solvents extracts-are pooled together passed through a bed of anhydrous sodium sulphate, concentrated by Hash evaporation, made up to known volume with chloroform and measured specirophotometncally. The total carotenoid yield is 400 (.ig/gdcm.<br>
