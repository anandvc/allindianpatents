PROVISIONAL SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
PHOTOSTABLE COSMETIC COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN   LEVER   LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at  Hindustan  Lever House,     165/166,  Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the invention<br><br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to photostable cosmetic compositions comprising sunscreens, more particularly to cosmetic compositions comprising dibenzoylmethane sunscreens.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
It is generally known that UV-A rays having wavelengths between 320 and 400 nm cause tanning of the skin, localized irritation, sun-burn and melanoma. It is also known that UV-B radiation, having wavelength between 280 nm and 320 nm also promotes tanning of the human epidermis, in addition to causing various other short and long-term damages, such as photoaging of skin, dryness, deep wrinkle formation, mottled pigmentation and the breakdown of elastic tissues and collagen. Therefore, it is desirable to protect the skin from the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation.<br>
Various cosmetic preparations have been reported for preventing and/or protecting the skin from harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. Numerous organic sunscreen agents, capable of absorbing harmful UV-A rays are also reported in the field of cosmetics, among which, a particularly advantageous being dibenzoylmethane and its derivatives. This is because they exhibit high intrinsic absorption power. On the other hand p-methoxy cinnamic acid and its derivatives are also used extensively as they are highly effective UV-B sunscreens. It is essential that cosmetic compositions contain both UV-A and UV-B sunscreens so as to provide protection over the entire range of UV radiation.<br>
It is known that dibenzoylmethane and its derivatives are relatively sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and they decompose rapidly under the effect of sunlight. This decomposition is accelerated in the presence of UV-B sunscreens, especially p-methoxycinnamic acid and its derivatives. Owing to photochemical instability of dibenzoylmethane and its derivatives in the presence of UV-B sunscreens, especially p-methoxycinnamic acid and its derivatives, one cannot guarantee constant protection during prolonged exposure to the sun. This therefore, warrants repeated applications at regular and frequent intervals by the user in order to maintain effective protection against UV rays.<br>
2<br><br>
On the other hand, it is also known that the protection afforded by cosmetic sunscreen compositions, reduces over a period of time and typically by the end of 1 hour from application, the protection is almost negligible. Stabilization of dibenzoylmethane and its derivatives therefore becomes important so that the user achieves complete advantage of its' efficacy and he does not have to resort to frequent applications.<br>
Various methods have been reported for stabilization of dibenzoylmethane and its derivatives in cosmetic formulations, which include the use of stabilizers such as thickening copolymers, amphiphilic copolymers and micronized insoluble organic UV sunscreen agents.<br>
In an alternative approach, US 5985251 (Roche Vitamins, 1999) describes light screening cosmetics wherein compositions comprising dibenzoylmethane derivatives and p-methoxy cinnamic acid derivatives are stabilized by incorporating 0.5 to 12% by weight 3-3-diphenylacrylate derivatives or benzylidene camphor derivatives. It can be readily seen that the formulation must necessarily contain an additional UV-B sunscreen of the diphenylacrylate class to stabilize UV-A sunscreens, a large part of which ends up getting utilized for stabilizing the UV-A sunscreen, without providing protection, which is its' primary role. Incorporation of the additional sunscreen would also add to the cost of the formulation.<br>
Therefore, there exists the need for cosmetic compositions comprising dibenzoylmethane or its derivatives, which are stabilized, especially in the presence of p-methoxy cinnamic acid or its derivatives, wherein specialty polymers and/or additional sunscreen stabilizers are not essentially required. It is highly desirable to have cosmetic compositions, which are stabilized with ingredients that are conventionally used in cosmetics, thereby reducing the complexities of formulation and substantially reduce costs. The present inventors have surprisingly found that cosmetic compositions comprising dibenzoylmethane or its derivative and p-methoxycinnamic acid-or its derivative, can be stabilized by incorporating a combination of fatty alcohol ethoxylates and polyalkyleneglycol.<br>
3<br><br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is therefore, an object of the present invention to obviate atleast some drawbacks of the prior art and provide photostable cosmetic compositions having sunscreens.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide photostable compositions comprising dibenzoylmethane sunscreens, wherein the stabilization is brought about by using conventionally used ingredients.<br>

Processing<br>
1.	Weighed quantities of Water, Potassium hydroxide, EDTA, p-casitose, and glycerin were taken in a 100ml beaker (Vessel A).<br>
2.	Weighed quantities of Isopropyl myristate, Parsol-1789, Parsol-MCX, Propyl- paraben, Methyl-paraben, cetyl alcohol, and phenoxyethanol were taken in another beaker. (Vessel B)<br>
3.	Stearic acid was melted by heating to 70 Â°C in a separate vessel.<br>
4.	Contents of Vessel-B were melted at 70 Â°C.<br>
5.	Vessel B was heated to 75 degree under continuous homogenization at low shear (500-700 rpm).<br>
6.	After attaining 70 Â°C, molten Stearic acid was added to vessel A, slowly and under continuous stirring.<br>
7.	After 1-2 min of stirring Brij was added, followed by the addition of PEG-200 in above rotating mixture, followed by the addition of Ti02.<br>
8.	Molten mass of Vessel- B was added to it.<br><br>
9.	Shear rate of homogenization was increased to 1000-1200 rpm and was continued for 5 min.<br>
10.	The hot mixture was thereafter allowed to cool at room temperature with continuous stirring at low speed (500-700rpm).<br>
11.	At 60 Â°C, Niacinamide was added.<br>
12.	Mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
Test Method<br>
The following test method was used for determining the stability of dibenzoylmethane sunscreens in the compositions of the present invention as well as for all the comparative examples described below.<br>
1.	A clean glass slide was taken and its weight was recorded (A).<br>
2.	About 10mg of cream was applied and spread on about 2 cm2.<br>
3.	The weight of slide with cream was recorded as (B).<br>
4.	Subtraction of B from A gave the weight of cream applied (C).<br>
5.	Above process was repeated six times for each test formulation.<br>
6.	These glass slides were exposed to sun simultaneously for various time intervals: 0 min, 15 min, 30 min and 60 min respectively.<br>
7.	After exposure to sunlight the creams were extracted in methanol and the volume was made up to 25ml.<br>
8.	The UV-absorbance of each of the samples was recorded on a UV spectrophotometer.<br>
9.	Absorbance per unit weight of the sample was calculated by dividing the absorbance at a max (i.e. 357nm, which is A max of dibenzoylmethanes) by weight of the cream (C).<br>
10.	The percentage absorbance remaining which is an indicator of the stability of the sample was calculated as follows:<br>
Percentage absorbance remaining = [An/ Ao X 100]<br>
where   Ao is "absorbance per unit weight" of 0 min sample, and<br>
Anis "absorbance per unit weight" of nth min sample. Results of the experiment conducted in example-1 are summarized in Table-2 below.<br>
14<br><br>
It is to be noted that the intensity of sunlight was found to vary from 20-40 mW/Cm2 at the time of exposure of the slides to sun and the experiments were conducted on different days. Therefore, the absolute values of % absorbance for the same/similar experiments conducted over the entire period, e.g. experiments using control samples are different across the tables.<br>
Table-2<br><br>
Sunlight Exposure time/min	%   Absorbance   of   Parsol   1789   remaining   after exposure, when measured by the procedure given above.<br>
	Control	Form-1	Form-2	Form-3<br>
0 (To)	100	100	100	100<br>
15(T15)	79	91	78.	97<br>
30(T30)	68	91	69	93<br>
45 (T45)	60	80	60	91<br>
60 (T60)	42	69	57	88<br>
The above table indicates that in the formulation containing both PEG 200 and Brij-35, a significantly higher activity of dibenzoylmethane sunscreen is available after 1 hour of application, as evident from the absorbance value.<br>
Example 2:<br>
To study the effect of combination of polyethyleneglycol with other surfactants on the stability of dibenzolmethane sunscreen and its comparison with the combination of polyethyleneglycol with Brij-35 according to the invention.<br>
The results are summarized in table-3 below.<br>
15<br><br>
Table-3<br><br>
Sunlight Exposure time/min	% Absorbance of Parsol 1789 remaining after exposure, when measured by the procedure given above.<br>
	Control	Form-4	Form-5		Form-3<br>

15(T15)	66	73	96		97<br>

45(T45)	47	63	78		85<br>
60 (T60)	40	64	75		83<br>
Thus it can be readily seen that a combination of polyethylene glycol and fatty alcohol ethoxylate gives better stability as compared to combination of polyethylene glycol other surfactants/emulsifiers.<br>
Example-3<br>
The present inventors have also determined the effect of varying molecular weight of Polyethyleneglycol on stability of dibenzoylmethane. Results of this experiment are summarized in table-4 below.<br>
16<br><br>

30(T30)	57	81	87	80	81<br>
45 (T45)	50	78	78	68	76<br>
60 (T60)	47	72	71	70	72<br>
The above table indicates that with various molecular weights of polyethylene glycol, greater than 70% of the dibenzoylmethane derivative remains available, even after 1 hour from application. This demonstrates that any molecular weight of PEG from 200 to 100000 can be used, without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
Example -4<br>
In yet another set of experiments, the effect of 2 grades of fatty alcohol ethoxylates (Brij) on stability of dibenzoylmethane sunscreen was studied in cosmetic creams, results of which are summarized in table -5 below.<br>
17<br><br>
Table -5<br><br>
SunlightExposuretime/min	% Absorbance of Parsol 1789 remaining after exposure by the procedure given below.	when measured<br>

45 (T45)	45	68	84	74<br>
60 (T60)	43	59	83	74<br>
Note: Brij56 is Polyethylene glycol hexadecvl ether or (Polyoxvethylene 10 cetyl ether). CAS number 9004-95-9, commercially available from Uniquema, Sigma-Aldrich.<br>
Thus, it can be readily seen that different grades of fatty alcohol ethoxylates provide high degree of stability to the dibenzoylmethane sunscreen in the composition.<br>
Example -5<br>
The stability of dibenzoylmethane derivative was also studied in the case of cosmetic lotions, to test the invention in a different carrier/vehicle. Details of the formulation are present in table-6 below. Processing details are also given below. Results are summarized in the table-7 below.<br>

3.	Ingredients of PART B were added to the water.<br>
4.	Ingredients of PART C were added to the water and was mixed after moderate heating The Titanium dioxide was mixed until it dispersed.<br>
5.	The combined PARTS A, B and C were heated to 65 degC.<br>
6.	Ingredients of PART D were heated to 65 degC and mixed until all the solids dissolved.<br>
7.	This part D was then added to combined PARTS A, B and C. While the temperature was at 65 degC, PART E ingredients were added.<br>
8.	The emulsion was missed under moderate agitation until the temperature reached 40 degC. It was later cooled to room temperature and was used as such for analysis.<br>

60 (T60)	43	68	59	76<br>
Thus it can be readily seen that the inventive combination of polyethylene glycol and fatty alcohol ethoxylate stabilizes the dibenzoylmethane derivative, even in a lotion based cosmetic composition.<br>
20<br><br>
Thus it can be seen from the foregoing description and examples that the invention provides for a composition comprising stable sunscreens. The invention also provides for compositions comprising stabilized dibenzoylmethane sunscreens, wherein the stabilization is brought about by using ingredients, which are conventionally used in cosmetic compositions.<br>
While the invention has been described in terms of various specific and preferred embodiments, the skilled artisan will appreciate that various modifications, substitutions, omissions, and changes may be made without departing from the spirit thereof.<br>
