SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR TRANSMITTING/RECEIVING HYBRID<br>
AUTOMATIC REPEAT REQUEST BUFFER CAPABILITY<br>
INFORMATION IN BROADBAND WIRELESS ACCESS<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
5<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a broadband wireless access (BWA)<br>
10	communication  system,  and more particularly to  a system and method for<br>
transmitting and receiving information about hybrid automatic repeat request<br>
(HARQ) buffer capability of a mobile station (MS).<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
15	Fourth generation (4G) communication systems (the next generation of<br>
communication systems) are being designed to provide users with services having<br>
various qualities of service (QoSs) with a high transmission speed. Particularly,<br>
in current 4G communication systems, research is actively being conducted to<br>
develop a new type of communication system for ensuring mobility and QoS in a<br>
20	broadband wireless access (BWA) communication system, such as a wireless<br>
local area network (LAN) and a wireless metropolitan area network (MAN)<br>
system, in order to support high speed services. The representative<br>
communication system is the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics<br>
Engineers) 802.16d/e communication system.<br>
25	The  IEEE  802.16d/e  communication system employs  an orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplexing/orthogonal frequency division multiple access<br>
(OFDM/OFDMA) scheme in order to enable a physical channel of the wireless<br>
MAN system to support a broadband transmission network. The structure of the<br>
IEEE 802. 16e communication system will now be described with reference to<br>
30	FIG. 1, which schematically illustrates the structure of a typical IEEE 802. 16e<br>
communication system.<br>
The IEEE 802.16e communication system has a multi-cell structure, that<br>
is, for example, a cell 100 and a cell 150. In addition, the IEEE 802.16e<br>
communication system includes a base station (BS) 110 managing the cell 100, a<br>
35	base  station  (BS)   140  managing  the  cell   150,  and  a plurality  of mobile<br>
stations(MSs) 111, 113, 130, 151, and 153. The transmission and reception of<br>
signals between the base stations 110 and 140 and the MSs 111, 113, 130, 151 and<br>
153 are executed using the OFDM/OFDMA scheme.<br>
Meanwhile, during data transmission, inevitable errors caused by noise,<br><br>
-2-<br>
interference, and fading occur according to channel conditions, thereby causing<br>
information loss. In order to reduce this information loss, various error-control<br>
schemes are used according to the characteristics of channels to increase system<br>
reliability. A representative error-control scheme is a hybrid automatic repeat<br>
5	request (HARQ) scheme.    The HARQ scheme is a new error-control scheme<br>
which is produced by combining the advantages of an automatic retransmission<br>
request (ARQ) scheme and a forward error correction (FEC) scheme.<br>
According to the HARQ scheme, an acknowledgment/non-<br>
acknowledgment (ACK/NACK) signal in response to a signal transmitted from a<br>
10	transmitter is fedback from a receiver to the transmitter, and the transmitter<br>
retransmits the transmitted signal when receiving the NACK signal from the<br>
receiver, thereby improving the reliability of transmission. The receiver feeds<br>
the ACK signal back to the transmitter when receiving a signal without error<br>
transmitted from the transmitter, and the receiver feeds the NACK signal back to<br>
15	the transmitter when receiving an abnormal signal from the transmitter, that is,<br>
when there is an error in the signal transmitted from the transmitter. In this case,<br>
when the HARQ scheme is employed, a transmitted signal has a unit of an HARQ<br>
encoder packet (Hep). One Hep is generated by inserting a cyclic redundancy<br>
check (CRC) code into one Medium Access Control-Protocol Data Unit (MAC-<br>
20	PDU) or a plurality of MAC-PDUs concatenated with each other.<br>
Currently, the IEEE 802.16d/e system supports two types of HARQ<br>
schemes, that is a first type (type-I) HARQ scheme and a second type (type-II)<br>
HARQ scheme. In the following description, the two types of HARQ schemes<br>
will be described.<br>
25<br>
According to the type-I HARQ scheme, which is also called a "chase<br>
combining (CC)" scheme, a transmitter transmits signals of the same format upon<br>
initial transmission and retransmission. Then, a receiver receives signals<br>
transmitted   from   the   transmitter   upon   the   initial   transmission   and   the<br>
30	retransmission, soft-combines two received signals, and then decodes the soft-<br>
combined signals.<br>
According to the type-II HARQ scheme, which is also called a<br>
"incremental redundancy (IR)" scheme, a transmitter transmits signals of different<br>
formats upon initial transmission and retransmission.    Then, a receiver code-<br>
35	combines signals transmitted from the transmitter upon the initial transmission<br>
and the retransmission, and then decodes the code-combined signals.<br>
As described above, the IEEE802.16d/e communication system supports<br>
two types of HARQ schemes. In order to realize the HARQ scheme, it is<br>
necessary to exchange parameters between an MS and a base station (BS) for the<br><br>
-3-<br>
HARQ scheme when the MS performs an initialization or handover operation.<br>
However, in the current IEEE 802.16d/e communication system, parameters<br>
exchanged for the HARQ scheme operation upon the initialization or handover of<br>
an MS does not include any parameter relating to the buffer capability of the MS.<br>
5	When the HARQ scheme operates without regard to the buffer capability<br>
of the MS, the following problems occur:<br>
First, since a base station does not know the buffer capability of an MS at<br>
all, the base station may determine a size of Hep beyond the capacity of the MS.<br>
In this case, it is impossible for the MS to receive the Hep transmitted from the<br>
10	base station, thereby causing unnecessary retransmission due to the abnormal<br>
reception of the Hep.<br>
Second, an MS must have not only a first memory capacity required for<br>
the combining operation with respect to erroneous Heps, but also a second<br>
memory   capacity  required   for  reordering   MAC-PDUs,   which   have   been<br>
15	generated by decoding normal Heps, in order to transmit the MAC-PDUs to an<br>
upper layer. When the MS does not secure the memory capacity required for the<br>
combining and reordering, it is impossible for the MS to receive a Hep<br>
transmitted from the base station, thereby causing unnecessary retransmission due<br>
to abnormal reception of the Hep.<br>
20	As described above, when the HARQ scheme operates without regard to<br>
the buffer capability of an MS, an unnecessary retransmission of a Hep occurs.<br>
Such an unnecessary retransmission of an Hep causes traffic delay and<br>
unnecessary resource allocation, thereby degrading the performance of the entire<br>
system.<br>
25<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments according to the present invention<br>
will be  described with reference to the  accompanying  drawings.     In the<br>
10	following description of the embodiments of the present invention, a detailed<br>
description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be<br>
omitted when it may obscure the subject matter of the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a system and method for transmitting and<br>
receiving hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) buffer capability information<br>
15	in  the  IEEE  (Institute  of Electrical  and  Electronics   Engineers)   802.16d/e<br>
communication system which is a broadband wireless access (BWA)<br>
communication system. Particularly, the present invention provides a system<br>
and method for operating the HARQ scheme in consideration of the HARQ buffer<br>
capability of a mobile station (MS) in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system,<br>
20	by allowing an MS to negotiate with the base station in relation to the HARQ<br>
buffer capability of the MS upon the initialization or handover operation of the<br>
MS. Although the present invention is described with respect to the IEEE<br>
802.16d/e communication system as an example, it is obvious that the present<br>
invention can be applied to other communication systems employing the HARQ<br>
25	scheme, as well as the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system.<br>
In addition, it should be noted that the general operations for initialization<br>
and handover of an MS in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system are applied<br>
to the present invention, except for the operation of transmitting and receiving<br>
information about the HARQ buffer capability of the MS.    Therefore, a detailed<br>
30	description of the operations according to the initialization and handover of the<br>
MS will be omitted, except for the operation of transmitting and receiving<br>
information about the HARQ buffer capability of the MS.<br>
FIG. 2 is a flow diagram schematically illustrating the operation of<br>
transmitting and receiving HARQ buffer capability information in the IEEE<br>
35	802.16d/e communication system according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
First, it is assumed in the first embodiment of the present invention that<br>
information about the HARQ buffer capability of an MS is transmitted and<br>
received between the MS and a base station upon the initialization or handover of<br><br>
-8-<br><br>
the MS, by transmitting and receiving a subscriber station(SS) basic capability<br>
negotiation request (SBC-REQ) message and a subscriber station basic capability<br>
negotiation response (SBC-RSP) message.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, first, an MS 200 detects its own HARQ buffer<br>
5	capability and transmits an SBC-REQ message to a base station 250 in step 211.<br>
Herein, the SBC-REQ message is a Medium Access Control (MAC) message<br>
transmitted in order for the MS 200 to negotiate with the base station 250 in<br>
relation to a basic capability. The SBC-REQ message includes information<br>
about  modulation   and  coding   schemes  which  the  MS   200   can  support.<br>
10	Particularly, the SBC-REQ message according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention further includes a HARQ buffer capability field, in which the<br>
buffer capacity of the MS 200 is recorded. The HARQ buffer capability<br>
information of the MS 200 may be recorded in the HARQ buffer capability field<br>
based on the three types described below. The HARQ buffer capability can be<br>
15	expressed in an index form predetermined between the MS and a base station, or<br>
expressed in maximal number of data bits the MS is able to store for<br>
uplink/downlink HARQ.<br>
Type 1<br>
20	According to the first type, Type 1, the MS 200 records its own HARQ<br>
buffer capability information in an index form predetermined between the MS<br>
200 and the base station 250. In this case, both the MS 200 and the base station<br>
250 has secured a HARQ buffer capability index table as shown in Table 1 in<br>
advance. Therefore, the MS 200 and the base station 250 can recognize the<br>
25	HARQ buffer capability information of the MS 200 based on the index form.<br>

As shown in Table 1, HARQ buffer capability information corresponding<br>
to each index, NEP representing a packet size "Nep" per HARQ channel, and the<br>
number of HARQ channels are mapped and stored in the HARQ buffer capability<br>
5	index table.<br>
The MS 200 transmits, to the base station 250, an SBC-REQ message<br>
including the HARQ buffer capability field, in which an index corresponding to<br>
the HARQ buffer capability information of the MS 200 has been recorded. Then,<br>
the base station 250 searches its own HARQ buffer capability index table for the<br>
10	index recorded in the HARQ buffer capability field of the SBC-REQ message,<br>
and identifies the HARQ buffer capability information of the MS 200. The base<br>
station 250 determines the amount of a transmission signal to be allocated to the<br>
MS 200, based on the identified HARQ buffer capability information of the MS<br>
200.<br>
15	Type 2<br>
According to the second type, Type 2, the MS 200 records the actual total<br>
HARQ buffer capability as its own HARQ buffer capability information. The<br>
MS 200 transmits an SBC-REQ message including the HARQ buffer capability<br>
field, in which the total HARQ buffer capability of the MS 200 has been recorded,<br>
20	to the base station 250.    Then, the base station 250 detects the total HARQ<br>
buffer capability of the MS 200, which has been recorded in the HARQ buffer<br>
capability  field of the  SBC-REQ  message,  and controls the  amount of a<br>
transmission signal corresponding to a "Nep" allocated to the MS 200.<br>
Type 3<br>
25	According to the third type, Type 3, the MS 200 recodes its own HARQ<br>
buffer capability information as a Nep. The MS 200 transmits an SBC-REQ<br>
message including the HARQ buffer capability field, in which the Nep is<br>
recorded, to the base station 250. Then, the base station 250 detects the Nep<br>
recorded in the HARQ buffer capability field of the SBC-REQ message, and<br>
30	controls the amount of a transmission signal corresponding to a Nep allocated to<br>
the MS 200. In Type 3, that is, when the MS 200 records its own HARQ buffer<br>
capability information in the form of Nep, the HARQ buffer capability field<br>
included in the SBC-REQ message may have various formats as described blow.<br>
A first format for the HARQ buffer capability field will now be described.<br>
35	First, when the HARQ buffer capability field is represented with 8 bits of<br><br>
-10-<br>
"b7" to "b0", the upper 4 bits are determined to express a value of "0" or "1".<br>
Herein, the value of "0" represents the total HARQ buffer capability, and the<br>
value of "1" represents the HARQ buffer capability per one HARQ channel. In<br>
the remaining lower 4 bits, the HARQ buffer capability is recorded as the number<br>
5	of bits or as a "Nep".    In addition, it is also required to inform the base station<br>
250 of the number of HARQ channels allocated to the MS 200. The number of<br>
HARQ channels allocated to the MS 200 may be included in the HARQ buffer<br>
capability field or may be included in another field included in the SBC-REQ<br>
message.<br>
10	Therefore, when the upper 4 bits have a value of "0", a Nep per HARQ<br>
channel can be obtained by dividing the total HARQ buffer capability recorded in<br>
the lower 4 bits by the number of HARQ channels allocated to the MS 200. In<br>
contrast, when the upper 4 bits have a value of "1", the total HARQ buffer<br>
capability can be obtained by multiplying the Nep recorded in the lower 4 bits by<br>
15	the number of HARQ channels allocated to the MS 200.<br>
A second format for the HARQ buffer capability field will now be<br>
described.<br>
First, when the HARQ buffer capability field is represented with 8 bits of<br>
"b7" to "b0", the upper 3 bits of "b7" to "b5" are set as reserved bits, and the next<br>
20	bit of "b4" has a value representing whether this format represents a HARQ<br>
buffer capability. In the remaining bits of "b3" to "bO", the number of bits or a<br>
"Nep" is recorded.<br>
Meanwhile, the MS 200 must notify the base station 250 of HARQ buffer<br>
capabilities for both uplink and downlink.    In addition, since two types of<br>
25	schemes, that is, a chase combining (CC) scheme (type-I scheme) and an<br>
incremental redundancy (IR) scheme (type-II scheme) are supported in the IEEE<br>
802.16d/e communication system, the MS 200 must notify the base station 250 of<br>
HARQ buffer capabilities for both the CC scheme and the IR scheme.<br>
Therefore, for example, in the case of the second HARQ buffer capability<br>
30	format of Type 3, downlink HARQ buffer capability information for any one<br>
HARQ scheme of the CC and IR schemes is recorded in one byte, that is, in 8 bits<br>
of "b7" to "b0", as described above, and uplink HARQ buffer capability<br>
information for any one HARQ scheme of the CC and IR schemes is recorded in<br>
another byte, that is, in 8 bits of "b15" to "b8".    In this case, the scheme for<br>
35	recording the uplink HARQ buffer capability information is the same as that used<br>
for recording the downlink HARQ buffer capability information, except that they<br>
use different bits, so a detailed description of the scheme of recording the uplink<br>
HARQ buffer capability information will be omitted.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 2, when the base station 250 receives the SBC-<br><br>
-11-<br>
REQ message from the MS 200, the base station 250 transmits an SBC-RSP<br>
message to the MS 200 in response to the SBC-REQ message in step 213.<br>
Herein, the SBC-RSP message also includes the HARQ buffer capability field.<br>
The base station 250 can recognize the HARQ buffer capability of the MS 200<br>
5	through the HARQ buffer capability field included in the SBC-REQ message.<br>
Therefore, the base station 250 determines the amount of a transmission signal to<br>
be allocated to the MS 200 based on the HARQ buffer capability information of<br>
the MS 200, and informs the MS 200 of information about a HARQ burst, which<br>
has been allocated based on the determined amount of the transmission signal,<br>
10	through a compact downlink MAP (Compact DL-MAP) message in step 215.<br>
The operation of transmitting and receiving HARQ buffer capability<br>
information in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention has been described with reference to FIG. 2.<br>
Hereinafter, the operation of transmitting and receiving HARQ buffer capability<br>
15	information in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system according to a second<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the flow<br>
diagram of FIG. 3.<br>
First, it is assumed in the second embodiment of the present invention<br>
that information about the HARQ buffer capability of an MS is transmitted and<br>
20	received between the MS and a base station upon the initialization or handover of<br>
the MS, by transmitting and receiving a registration request (REG-REQ) message<br>
and a registration response (REG-RSP) message.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, first, an MS 300 detects its own HARQ buffer<br>
capability information and transmits a REG-REQ message to a base station 350 in<br>
25	step 311. Herein, the REG-REQ message includes MS registration information of<br>
the MS 300. Particularly, according to the second embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a HARQ buffer capability field is additionally included in the REG-<br>
REQ message, and the HARQ buffer capability information of the MS 300 is<br>
recorded in the HARQ buffer capability field.    Herein, since the scheme for<br>
30	recording the HARQ buffer capability information of the MS 300 is the same as<br>
that used for recording a HARQ buffer capability information in the HARQ<br>
buffer capability field of the SBC-REQ message, which is described according to<br>
the first embodiment of the present invention, a detailed description of such will<br>
be omitted.<br>
35	When the base station 350 receives the REG-REQ message from the MS<br>
300, the base station 350 transmits a REG-RSP message to the MS 300 in<br>
response to the REG-REQ message in step 313. Herein, the REG-RSP message<br>
also includes the HARQ buffer capability field. The base station 350 can<br>
recognize the HARQ buffer capability of the MS 300 through the HARQ buffer<br><br>
-12-<br>
capability field included in the REG-REQ message. Therefore, the base station<br>
350 determines the amount of a transmission signal to be allocated to the MS 300<br>
based on the HARQ buffer capability of the MS 300, and informs the MS 300 of<br>
information about a HARQ burst, which has been allocated based on the<br>
5	determined amount of a transmission signal,  through a Compact DL-MAP<br>
message in step 315.<br>
The operation of transmitting and receiving HARQ buffer capability<br>
information in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system according to the<br>
second embodiment of the present invention has been described with reference to<br>
10	FIG. 3.    Hereinafter, the operation of transmitting and receiving HARQ buffer<br>
capability information in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system, according<br>
to a third embodiment of the present invention, will be described with reference<br>
to the flow diagram of FIG. 4.<br>
15	First, it is assumed in the third embodiment of the present invention that<br>
information about the HARQ buffer capability of an MS is transmitted and<br>
received between the MS and a base station upon the initialization or handover of<br>
the MS, by transmitting and receiving a ranging request (RNG-REQ) message<br>
and a ranging response (RNG-RSP) message.<br>
20	Referring to FIG. 4, first, an MS 400 detects its own HARQ buffer<br>
capability information and transmits an RNG-REQ message to a base station 450<br>
in step 411. Particularly, according to the third embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a HARQ buffer capability field is additionally included in the RNG-<br>
REQ message, and the HARQ buffer capability information of the MS 400 is<br>
25	recorded in the HARQ buffer capability field.    Herein, since the scheme for<br>
recording the buffer capability of the MS 400 is the same as that used for<br>
recording a buffer capability in the HARQ buffer capability field of the SBC-<br>
REQ message, which is described according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present invention, a detailed description of such will be omitted.<br>
30	When the base station 450 receives the RNG-REQ message from the MS<br>
400, the base station 450 transmits an RNG-RSP message to the MS 400 in<br>
response to the RNG-REQ message in step 413. Herein, the RNG-RSP message<br>
also includes the HARQ buffer capability field. The base station 450 can<br>
recognize the HARQ buffer capability of the MS 400 through the HARQ buffer<br>
35	capability field included in the RNG-REQ message.    Therefore, the base station<br>
450 determines the amount of a transmission signal to be allocated to the MS 400<br>
based on the HARQ buffer capability of the MS 400, and informs the MS 400 of<br>
information about a HARQ burst, which has been allocated based on the<br>
determined amount of a transmission signal,  through a Compact DL-MAP<br><br>
-13-<br>
message in step 415.<br>
The operation of transmitting and receiving HARQ buffer capability<br>
information in the IEEE 802.16d/e communication system according to the third<br>
embodiment of the present invention has been described with reference to FIG. 4.<br>
5	Hereinafter, the internal structure of an MS according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to the block diagram of FIG. 5.<br>
The MS includes a HARQ buffer 511, a controller 513, and a transmitter<br>
515. The HARQ buffer 511 supports the HARQ scheme of the MS, and stores<br>
received HARQ encoder packets (Hep) and Medium Access Control-Protocol<br>
10	Data Units (MAC-PDUs), which are generated by decoding normal Heps and are<br>
reordered for transmission to an upper layer. The controller 513 detects the<br>
HARQ buffer capability of the HARQ buffer 511, generates information to be<br>
recorded in a HARQ buffer capability field based on the detected HARQ buffer<br>
capability, and outputs the generated information, i.e., HARQ buffer capability<br>
15	information to the transmitter 515.    The transmitter 515 records HARQ buffer<br>
capability information generated by the controller 513 or information obtained<br>
based on the generated information in the HARQ buffer capability field of a<br>
message (that is, SBC-REQ message, REG-REQ message, or RNG-REQ<br>
message) to be transmitted, and then outputs the relevant message to the base<br>
20	station.<br>
The internal structure of an MS according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention has been described with reference to FIG. 5. Hereinafter, the<br>
internal structure of a base station according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention will be described with reference to the block diagram of FIG. 6.<br>
25	The base station includes a receiver 611 and a controller 613.<br>
The receiver 611 receives a relevant message (that is, SBC-REQ message,<br>
REG-REQ message, or RNG-REQ message) from an MS, and outputs<br>
information about the HARQ buffer capability of the MS, which has been<br>
recorded in the HARQ buffer capability field of the received message, to the<br>
30	controller 613.    The controller 613 determines the amount of a transmission<br>
signal to be allocated to the MS based on the HARQ buffer capability information<br>
output from the receiver 611, so as to transmit a signal suitable for the HARQ<br>
buffer capability of the MS.<br>
According to the present invention as described above, information about<br>
35	the HARQ buffer capability of an MS is reported to a base station in a broadband<br>
wireless access communication system, so that the base station can operate a<br>
HARQ scheme in accordance with the HARQ buffer capability of the MS.<br>
Accordingly, since unnecessary signal retransmission due to abnormal signal<br>
reception  of the  MS  is  prevented,  traffic  delay  and unnecessary resource<br><br>
-14-<br>
allocation are prevented, thereby improving the performance of the entire system.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
5	departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended<br>

32. The system as claimed in claim 31, wherein the downlink and uplink<br>
HARQ buffer capability is available for an incremental redundancy (IR) scheme.<br><br>
Disclosed is a system and method for transmitting and receiving hybrid<br>
automatic repeat request (HARQ) buffer capability information in a broadband<br>
wireless access communication system.    According to the system and method, a<br>
mobile station detects its own HARQ buffer capacity, and transmits a message<br>
including information about the detected HARQ buffer capability to a base station.<br>
The  base  station  receives  the  message  and  determines  the  amount   of a<br>
transmission signal to be allocated to the mobile station based on the HARQ<br>
buffer capability, so that it is possible to operate a HARQ scheme in accordance<br>
with the HARQ buffer capability of the mobile station.</td>
