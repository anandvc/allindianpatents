FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to cellullar communication technology. Specifically this invention relates to Mobile phones or other phones and Bluetooth Head set. More particularly the present invention relates to a method of audibly informing the caller id to the subscriber from a Bluetooth head set for an incoming call.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Bluetooth is a mode of wireless connectivity. Mobile phones are built to use this mode of connectivity to provide wireless hands-free experience for the Users via Bluetooth Headset.<br>
Using Blue tooth enabled headset subscribe can communicate with the mobile phone for accepting/rejecting incoming calls or initiate calls. Due to wireless connectivity between mobile phone and the headset, user has the effect of using hands-free with advanced features.<br>
It works in the following way:<br>
1)	Incoming call<br>
2)	Caller ID (Name/Number) is displayed on the mobile phone screen<br>
3)	Alert tone is heard in the Bluetooth Headset<br>
4)	Subscriber should see the mobile phone screen to make the decision whether to accept/reject the call<br>
Following are the operations performed on an incoming call when a Bluetooth (BT) Headset is paired:<br>
1)	Call module handles the incoming call and retrieves the contact information (Caller name if present) from the Phone Book module.<br>
2)	Caller ID is displayed on the mobile phone screen and Call module<br><br>
requests the BT module to play incoming call alert tone. 3)  BT module interacts with the BT headset and plays the alert tone.<br>
There are following drawbacks in the existing BT technology:<br>
1)	Subscriber cannot identify the caller from alert tone.<br>
2)	As the caller ID cannot be displayed subscriber cannot decide about answering the call.<br>
3)	CLIP is a paid service, which becomes void while using BT headset.<br>
4)	Subscriber may not be able to see the Caller Id displayed on the screen. Due to these drawbacks the advantage of wireless connectivity is lost.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is to invent a method of audibly informing caller ID to the subscriber in a bluetooth head set.<br>
The present invention aims at suggesting new way for overcoming the problems discussed. This approach suggests retrieving associated AMR clip from Phonebook or Number in case the incoming number is not in Phonebook and plays it in the BT headset. If there is no number (Due to calling party CLIR) then it plays default tone.<br>
User may optionally decide to use text to speech conversion to convert contact name or number to AMR packets if user has not associated any AMR clip already to this contact.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a method of announcing caller id in a Bluetooth headset for an incoming call comprising the steps of:<br>
a.  receiving and handling an incoming call by a call module;<br><br>
b.	displaying the caller ID name/number on the mobile phone screen;<br>
c.	retrieving the pre-recorded audio clip if available by bluetooth module;<br>
d.	interacting  with   aText  to  Speech   module  to  convert  the  caller<br>
name/number to audio clips if audio clip not available; and<br>
e.	playing an alert tone in the headset.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more readily apparent from the detailed description taken in conjunction with the drawings and the claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram announcing the caller id in Bluetooth head set for an in coming call in the related art.<br>
Figure 2 shows a block diagram announcing the caller id in Bluetooth head set for an in coming call in respect to the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a flow chart announcing the caller id in Bluetooth head set for an in coming call with respect to the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be<br><br>
embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 shows block diagram announcing the caller id in Bluetooth head set for an in coming call in the related art.<br>
Referring to Figure 2, Phone book module retrieves the pre-recorded audio clip; if available otherwise it interacts with Text to Speech module to convert the Caller Name to audio clips and sends to Bluetooth module. If there is no number available then Phonebook module interacts with text to speech module and generates the audio clips for caller number and sends these numbers to Bluetooth module.<br>
Figure 3 is a BT module which interacts with the BT headset and plays the audio clips selected by Phonebook module.<br>
First the hand set receives a call. Then a check is made to confirm whether the caller number exists. Caller number may be received in the incoming call message from network. If caller number does not exist, a default tone is sent to the BT module and further it is send to the BT headset. If the caller number exists then a check is made to confirm whether an audio clip exist for the corresponding number. If an audio clip exists then it is send to the BT module. Further, it is send to the BT headset to play. If an audio clip does not exist a check is made to confirm whether a name entry exist in the phone book and if the name exist audio clip for the name is got from text to speech module and send to BT module. Then BT module contacts the BT Headset and plays the clip. If the name entry does not exist in the phone book audio clip for the number is got from text to speech<br><br>
module and send to BT module. Then BT module contacts the BT Headset and plays the clip.<br>
The objective of the invention is as follows: To add a new technology which<br>
1.	Enhances the advantage of BT connectivity.<br>
2.	Facilitates   increased   comfort   level   of   decision   making   for accepting/rejecting the incoming call.<br>
Its structure is as follows:<br>
1)	Incoming call.<br>
2)	Caller ID (Name/Number) is displayed on the mobile phone screen.<br>
3)	Audio clip for that caller is played in the Bluetooth Headset.<br>
4)	Subscriber can make the decision whether to accept/reject the call on hearing the audio clip (caller name/number).<br>
5)	Subscriber need not to check the mobile phone screen for decision making.<br>
Pre-conditions for the functioning of the invention:<br>
a)	Mobile Phone supports BT Connectivity.<br>
b)	Mobile Phone supports Voice Recording.<br>
c)	Mobile   Phone   supports   Ring   tone   association   for   each phonebook entry.<br>
Recording an Audio Clip:<br>
User can record an audio clip using applications like voice/audio recorder and store it in phone memory.<br>
Based on the recording format supported by the recorders, user can store the audio clips in respective audio formats. (AMR, MP3, AAC, WAV and MMF). For recording a typical name mobile phone's memory takes approximately 2-3 KB of<br><br>
Associating an Audio clip with a phone book entry:<br>
Each phone book entry can be associated with a pre-recorded audio clip. A single audio clip may be associated with more than one phone book entry.<br>
Phone books have an entry to associate the audio file to a contact. Usually this audio file is used for alerting the user. A single audio file may be associated with more than one phone book entry. In this proposed implementation optionally each contact can be associated with the pre-recorded audio clip and that can be played over BT.<br>
During an Incoming Call:<br>
BT Headset is paired with Mobile Phone and Caller ID announcement feature is enabled,<br>
If caller number is not available with the incoming call (this may be due to CLIR enabled by the Caller), send the default ring tone to the BT module. This also may be the ring tone, which was set by the user.<br>
If Caller Number is available and audio clip for the caller is available, the audio clip will be sent to the BT module and BT headset will play.<br>
If Caller Number is available and audio clip is not available, Name of the Caller will be converted to audio clip(s) by Text to Speech Converter Module if the name is available in the Phonebook. This Audio Clip will be sent to BT module for playing in the BT headset. Otherwise the number will be converted to audio clip(s) by Text to Speech Converter Module and sent to BT module.<br>
BT Headset is paired with Mobile Phone and Caller ID announcement feature is<br><br>
disabled as follows:<br>
1)	If Caller Number is available and the audio clip for the caller is available, the audio clip will be sent to the BT module for playing.<br>
2)	If Caller Number is available and the Audio Clip for the Caller is not available, send the default ring tone to the BT module. This also may be the ring tone, which is from the user set profile.<br>
