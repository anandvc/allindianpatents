		METHOD OF LANCING SKIN FOR THE EXTRACTION OF BLOOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
	Field_of the Invention<br>
		The presenl invention relates, in general, to a method of lancing skin and,<br>
	more particulaily, to an improved method wherein the lancing element is removed after<br>
	creating an incision and then blood is channeled up the lancing element to a sensor element.<br>
	located at a proximal end of the lancing clement.<br>
	Background of the Invcntion<br>
		In in-situ testing of blood glucose, a glucose meter is placed against the skin<br>
	and blood is sampled and measured without moving the meter. In one method of in-situ<br>
	testing, a glucose sensor strip is combined with a. luncing clement positioned at a distal end<br>
	thereof, the glucose sensor strip is then positioned in a meter adapted to launch the strip and<br>
	lancing element combination toward the skin where the lancing element forms an incision.<br>
	Blood or other bodily fluids such as, fot example, interstitial fluid, may then be extracted<br>
	from the incision and moved to the glucost sensor strip where it can be measured using, for<br>
	example, on electrochemical process.<br>
		When lancing skin using an in-situ lest strip, it is desirable to ensure that blood<br>
	be transferred efficiently from the incision to the test strip, using as little blood as possible.<br>
	Efficient transfer of blood from the incision means that more of the blood is actually used to<br>
	lest for anslyte (e.g. glucose) levels, reducing the total blood required and, therefore, the<br>
	incision size required for the lest Smaller intisions are particularly desirable because, in<br>
	general, it is desirable to reduce the pain experienced by the user. Further, smaller incisions<br>
	generally heal faster and art out as likely to re-open once healed.<br>
1<br><br>
	WO 2004/041088 						PCT/US2003/03456<br>
		Thus, when using an in-situ test, it is desirable to create an incision which is<br>
	very small while maximising the amount of blood generated by that incision. A number of<br>
	factors influence the amount of blood generated by a particular incision, Mary of those<br>
	factors cannot be controlled. One of the factors which reduces, the amount of blood available<br>
	at a particular incision is the tendency of the incision to seal around the lancing element if the<br>
	lancing element is left in the wound.<br>
		It would, therefore, be advantageous to develop a-method of lanting which<br>
	increases the amount of blood available for testing at a particular incisbn sits. It would<br>
	further be advantageous to develop a method of lancing which increases the amount of blood<br>
	available for lancing by pieveniing the wound from mscaling during the testing process. It<br>
	would further he advantageous to develop a method of lancing which increases the amount 01<br>
	blood available for lancing by preventing the wound from sealing around the lancinig elcment<br>
	during the testing process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
		In a method according to the present invention, a lancing tip is first inserted<br>
	and then is netracted completely out of the lance wound site, The lancing tip is then<br>
	positioned adjacent the wound opening and blood is chmneled to a test strip integrated with<br>
	the lance.<br>
		In a method of lancing skin according to the present invention, the lancing<br>
	element is inserted through an outer surface of the skin to obtain a sample of blood. In one<br>
	embodiment of ths invention, the method includes using a lancing instrument having a<br>
	sharpened end and a fluid channel extending from the sharpened end to a sensor attachtd to a<br>
	proximal end of the lancing instrument, forcing the sharpened tip of the lancing element into<br>
	the skin to a first predclemined depth, wherein the sharpened tip creates an incision in the<br>
	skin surface and a wound below the skin surface, and completely with drawing the lancing<br>
	element, including the sharpened tip. After completely withdrawing tip sharpened tip from<br>
	the incision, blood, is drawn through the channel to the sensor.<br>

	embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, sensor ship 100 includes first electrode contact 10,<br>
	wherein first electrode contact may be screen printed on an insulating substrate 18, and a<br>
	second electrode contact 17, wherein said second electrode contact comprises s portion of<br>
	conductive- substrate 12 which is contiguous with top reference electrode 19 and lancing<br>
	element 15.<br>
		In the embodiment of the lancing element and sensor strip illustrated in Figures 1 and<br>
	2, the orientation of said first electrode contact 10 and second electrode contact 17 are<br>
	arranged such that an anslyte measurement meter, such as,for example, a glucose meter (not<br>
	shown) can establish electrical contact with senscir strip 100. in the illustrated embodiment,<br>
	the electrodes are arranged on the same side of msulaling substrate 18 to facilitate contact of<br>
	both dectrodes at this proximal end of sensor strip 100.<br>
		Sensor strip 100 is manufictured using adhesive layer 11 to attach. insuleting substate<br>
	18 to conductive substrate 12- Adhesive layer 11 could be implemented in a number of ways,<br>
	including using pressure sensitive-material, beat activated material, or UV cured double sided<br>
	adhesive material. Cooductive stibstmte 12 may be, for example, a conductive substrate that<br>
	is B sheet of cloctrioally conduttivc material such as gold or plated stainless steel. The<br>
	geometry of conductive substrate 12 may be formed by, for example, stumping; process or<br>
	phopo-ctching. In the embodiment illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, lancing element 15 may be<br>
	manufactured as an integral part of conductive substrate 12. Vent bole 13, may be formed by,<br>

	WO 2004/041088						 PCT/US2003/034456<br>
		in one embodiment of the invention, analyse sensing layer 14 may be, for example, a<br>
	glucose sensing layer, including an enzyme, a buffer, and a redox mediator. Analyte sensing<br>
	layer 14 may preferably be deposited on top of working eloctrods 36. Where snalyte sensing<br>
	layer 14 is used to dstect the presence and concentration of giucose in a bodily fluid, at least a<br>
	portion of glucose sensing layer 14 dissolves in the bodily fluid and is used to convert the<br>
	glucose concentration into an electrically measured parameter which is proportional to the<br>
	glucose-concentration in the sample.<br>
		In the embodiment illustraled in Figures 1 and 2, lancing element 15 has a proximal<br>
	and distal end and the proximal end is integrated with the top reference electrode 19 and said<br>
	distal end is integrated with a lancing tip 22 and channel tip 24. The lancing element is<br>
	formed by the process of stamping or photo-eiching a conductive material sheet end bending<br>
	it to the geometty shown in Figure 2. In one embodiment, lacing tip 22 and channel tip 24 are<br>
	slightly offset by about 0-005 to 0.20", the design of lancing element 15 is adapted to assist<br>
	in improving skini separation. The geometry illustrated in Figares 1 and 2 may enhance fluid<br>
	egress because it helps sprfcad and open a skin wound. In the embodiment illustrated in<br>
	Figures 1 and 2, the lancing element 15 is congiguous with the top reference electrode 19 and<br>
	electrode contact 17.<br>
		In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in Figure 2, lancing element 15<br>
	includes fill chatmd 2lt wherein capillary fill channel 21 facilitates the flow of body fluid<br>
	from the wound to the analyte scnsing layer 14. Fill channel 21 may facilitate the flow of<br>
	bodily fluids by, for example, wicking or capiliary action. In the embadimait illustrated in<br>
	Figures 1 and 2 fill channel 21 has an open geometiy which facilitates the wicking of viscous<br>
	satuples and provides for simpler manufacturing techniques when compared with closed<br>
	capillary channels.<br>
		In the emhodiment of sensor suip 100 illustrated in Figure 1, insulating substrate 18<br>
	coosists of material such as polyester or ceramic on which a conductive material can be<br>
	prints onto the insulating layer through silk-screening, sputtering, or elcctroi-less deposition.<br>

	boundary for the electrode contact 10 and the bottom working electrode.<br>
		Figure 3A is a perspective view of a lancing element tip imediately before<br>
	penetration of the surface of the skin. More particularly, Figure 3A is a perspective view of a<br>
	lance 15 before lancing tip 22 penetrates skin surface 30, Figure 3B is a side view of the<br>
	lancing element illustrated in Figure 3A- More particularly Figure 3B is side view of lancing<br>
	element 15 before lancing tip 22 penetrates skin surface 30. In Figures 3A and 3B, milking<br>
	ring 31 iS placed against skin surface 30, causing skin surface 30 to bulge in to milking<br>
	opening 32, Milking ring 32 may be, for example. a substrate with a bole drilled through it<br>
	which could be, for example, a plastic such as polystyrene poiyethylene, polycarbonate,<br>
	polyester, or the like. The diameter of opening 32 of said milting ring may be, for example,<br>
	in the range of between 3,5 and 12 mm. in operation, the milking ring 31 may be applied<br>
	with gentle pressure onto a fingertip, forearm, or other suitable site such that the skin surface<br>
	30 forms a raised mound within milting ring 31. In a one embodiment of a method according<br>
	to the present invention, milking ring 31 is applited to skin surface 31 with a pressure of<br>
	approximately 0,5 to 1.5 pounds of applied pressure. To one embodiment of a method<br>
	according to the present invention, the use of a milking ring is- intended to facilitate the<br>
	collection of bodily fluids by applying a pressure around the incision site to provide a driving<br>
	force for expressing fluid from the wound site.<br>
		Figure 3C is a perspective view of a lanoing element as the tip of the lancing element<br>
	begins to penetrate the surface of the skin. As lancing tip 22 enters skin surface 30, deflecting<br>
	sion surface 30 away from lancing tip 22 until skin surface 30 is punctured, forming an<br>
	incision 37 in skin surface 30, enabling lancing element 15 to enter subcutaneous region 33.<br>
	Figure 3D is a side view of the landng element as the tip of the lancing clement begins to<br>
	penetrate the surface of the skin, Moie particularly;, Figure 3D is a side view of lancing<br>
	element 15 as lencing tip 22 enters imcision 37 in skin surface 30.<br>
		Figure 3E is a perspective view of the lancing element as it rcaches its full depth of<br>

	view of lancing element 15 after lancing tip 22 has reacliud its full depth of pcnetrasion into<br>
	subcutaneous region 33. Figure 3F is a side view of the lancing element 15 as it reaches its<br>
	full depth of penetration beneath the surface of the skin. More particularly, Figure 3F is a<br>
	side view of lancing element 15 after lancing tip 22 has reached its full depth, of penetration<br>
	into subcutaneous region 33. At full penetration, lanciisg tip 22 reaches a depth of DI - The<br>
	actual value of Dl for a particular application will depend upon a number of factors,<br>
	including the bodily fluid being extracted. For example, if the bodily fluid being extracted is<br>
	blood, the depth Dl will be greater than if the bodily fluid being extracted, is interstitial fluid<br>
	(i.e. 1SF). in one embodiment of the present inveaiicn, penetration depth D1 may be, for<br>
	example, in the range of 0.25 to 1.5 mm deep.<br>
		In a method according to the present invention, insertion of lancing element 15<br>
	throught skin surface 30 creales an incision 37 in addition to severing subcutaneous tissue and<br>
	capillaries and providing fill channel 21 with access to the bodily fluid to be sampled,<br>
	wheiher blood or interstitial fluid Thus, with lancing element 15 positioned as shown in<br>
	Figure3E and 3F, bodily fluid will flow through fill channcl 21 and into sensor strip 100.<br>
	However, leaving lancing element 15 positioned as iIllustrated in Figures 3E and 3F will not<br>
	provide an optimal flow of bodily fluid through fill channel 21. The reasons for the limited<br>
	flow may include, for example, the blocking of lanced capillaries by the location of lancing<br>
	element 15 which may, for example, prevent the capillaries or interstitial fluid from flowing<br>
	freely and pooling in the wound created by lancing element 15.<br>
		Fig 3G is a perspective -view of the lancing etement after if. is fully with drawn from<br>
	the skin. More particularly, Figure 3G is a perspective view of lancing element 15 after<br>
	lencing lip 22 has been withdrawn completely from incision 37. Fig 3H is a side view of the-<br>
	lancing element 15 after it is fully withdrawn from sion surface 30. In a method according to<br>
	the present invention, fully withdrawing lancing element 15 from incision 37 creates an open<br>
	the wound 38 below incision 37 Which fecilitates expression of bodily fluid into wound 38.<br>
	By folly removing lancing element 15 from the wound in accordance with the method of the<br>
	present invention, bodily fluids flow mofc readily into wound 38. If lancing element 15 is not<br>
	completely removed from wound 38, blood and/or interstitial fluid flow may be impeded,<br>

	WO 2004/041088 							PCT/US2003/034456<br>
	One possible explanation for the limited blood flow is the possibility that the partially<br>
	retracted lancing element. 15 may still effectively block severed capillarise because of the<br>
	resiliency of the skin. After the initial skin streochtng during the penetration-event, the skin<br>
	might revert back to its initial position abound lancing element 15, Thus, in the method<br>
	according to the present invention it is important that lancing element 15 be fully removed<br>
	from wound 38 after the initial penetration to allow bodily fluid to pool in wound 38.<br>
		Figure31 is a perspective view of the lancing element as it re-enters the surface of the<br>
	skin through the incision created during the first entry. More particularly, Figure 31 is a<br>
	perepectivc view of lancing element 15 after lancing tip 22 has been re-inserted through<br>
	incision 37 into wound 38. Figure 3J is a side view of the latticing element as it re-enters the<br>
	stirfafle of the skin through the incision created during the first entry. More particularly.<br>
	Figure 3J is a side view of lancing element 15 positioned within wound 38 such that channel<br>
	tip 24 is below skin surfecs 30. Figure 3K. is a perspective view showing the landng element<br>
	being used to draw blood from a forearm. More particularly. Figure 3K. is a. perspective view<br>
	of a lancing device 15 being used in a method seconding to the present invention to draw<br>
	bodily fluids from a forearm 40 of a human being.<br>
		In a method of lancing skin in accordance with the present invention, as set<br>
	forth above, the method may further include using milking ring. 31 to exert the pressure in the<br>
	region surrounding incision 37 exerted by milking ring 31. Milking ring 31 is posttidned on<br>
	the skin prior to the step of forcing the lancing tip 22 into the skin and may be maintained<br>
	throughout the remainder of the procedure. In this embodiment of the invention the milking<br>
	ring31 provides a pressure sufficient to facilitate the flow of bodily fluids into fill channel 21<br>
	after the reinsertion of lancing tip 22 into wound 38. in One embodiment of the invention,<br>
	milking ring 31 provides a pressure in a range of approximately 0,5 to 1.5 pounds. In a<br>
	further embodiment of the present invention, the method may include positioning the milking<br>
	ring 51 against the skin for a predetermined period of line prior to launching the lancing<br>
	element in a futher embondiment of the present invention, the predetermined period of time<br>
	may be three seconds or more.<br>
