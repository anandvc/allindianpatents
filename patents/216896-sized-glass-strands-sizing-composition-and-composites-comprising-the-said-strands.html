				<td>Sized Glass Strands, Sizing Composition And Composites<br>
Comprising The Said Strands<br>
The invention relates to glass strands coated with a sizing composition which are<br>
intended to reinforce organic materials of the polymer type, to the sizing compositions<br>
used to coat these strands and to the composites including these strands.<br>
Glass strands used for reinforcing are generally produced industrially from<br>
streams of molten glass flowing from the multiple orifices of a spinneret. These streams<br>
are drawn mechanically in the form of continuous filaments and are then gathered<br>
together into base strands, which are subsequently collected, for example by winding off<br>
on a rotating support. Before they are gathered together, the filaments are coated with a<br>
sizing composition by passing over a suitable device, such as coating rolls.<br>
The sizing composition proves to be essential in several respects. First of all, it is<br>
involved in the manufacture of the strands by protecting the glass filaments from the<br>
abrasion which occurs when the latter rub at high speed over the members which are<br>
used to guide them and to collect them. Next, the sizing composition makes it possible to<br>
give cohesion to the strand by creating bonds between its constituent filaments. The<br>
strand thus being rendered more integral is thereby easier to handle. Finally, the sizing<br>
composition promotes the wetting and the impregnation of the glass strands by the<br>
polymer to be reinforced, which, at this stage, has the appearance of a fluid resin. The<br>
mechanical properties of the final composite are for this reason markedly improved.<br>
The materials to be reinforced can combine with the glass strands in various<br>
forms: continuous or cut strands, fabrics, mats of continuous or cut strands, and the like.<br>
The composites incorporating cut glass strands can be obtained, inter alia, by the<br>
"contact moulding" technique, which consists in coating the inside of an open mould,<br>
without a countermould, with the resin to be reinforced and glass strands of variable<br>
length. In the specific process of "moulding by simultaneous spraying", the resin and the<br>
cut glass strands are sprayed together onto the inside walls of the mould by means of a<br>
"spray gun" comprising a cutter capable of severing the strands drawn off from one or<br>
more wound packages, generally in the form of rovings, and a device for feeding with<br>
resin, for example a pneumatic pump. This process, which is.simple and which can be<br>
adjusted both with regard to the size and the shape, is particularly suited to the<br>
manufacture of one-off or short-run components based on thermosetting polymer from the<br>
family of the polyesters or epoxides.<br>
The quality of the composites obtained by this process depends largely on the<br>
properties introduced by the glass strands and thus on the sizing composition which coats<br>
them. The target is in particular sizing compositions which can be easily wetted or<br>
impregnated at the surface by the resin, that is to say which are capable of providing<br>
close contact between the strands and the resin, so that the expected mechanical<br>
reinforcing properties can be obtained.<br>
It is also desired for these compositions to make fast processing possible, in<br>
particular for the strand/resjn mixture which is sprayed onto the mould in the form of<br>
overlapping strips to be able to spread out uniformly, and for the subsequent rolling stage,<br>
intended to remove the air bubbles and to provide better distribution of the strands in the<br>
resin, to be of short duration.<br>
Furthermore, however, it is necessary for the sizing composition to have a degree<br>
of "incompatibility" with the resin, that is to say not to be too soluble in the resin in order<br>
to prevent the strand/resin mixture, after spraying onto a vertical wall, from "collapsing" by<br>
simple gravity.<br>
It is just as necessary for the cut strands to retain their integrity and not to open<br>
with the release of their constituent filaments, both during the spraying and during the<br>
rolling/debubbling.<br>
It is thus seen that such compositions are difficult to develop as the targeted<br>
properties are rarely compatible with one another and that it is for this reason necessary<br>
to achieve compromises.<br>
One of the problems encountered during the implementation of the process for<br>
moulding by simultaneous spraying is the excessively short lifetime of the blades with<br>
which the spray gun is equipped. Although being made of hard steel, the blades of the<br>
cutter have a tendency to rapidly wear out on contact with the glass, which leads to "false<br>
cuts" and the appearance of cut strands with a length greater than the desired length.<br>
Depending upon the number of blades, their degree of wear and the position which they<br>
occupy on the cutter, it is possible to obtain a mixture of strands with a length<br>
f-<br>
corresponding to a whole multiple of the expected length. The false cuts result in an<br>
unevenness in the sheet of sprayed fibre, which is harmful to the quality of the moulded<br>
component and necessitates an interruption in the manufacture in order for the old blades<br>
to be changed, leading to a fall in productivity.<br>
Glass strands suited to the production of components by moulding by<br>
simultaneous spraying are disclosed in particular in FR-A-2 755 127. These strands are<br>
coated with a composition which comprises, in addition to adhesion agents capable of<br>
providing the sizing function, the combination of an aminosilane and an unsaturated<br>
silane. Although presented as improving the ability of the strand to be cut, the<br>
combination of the two abovementioned silanes does not make it possible to achieve the<br>
desired objective, namely that the longevity of the blades is insufficient to meet current<br>
productivity standards, which require being able to operate continuously for approximately<br>
ten hours.<br>
An aim of the invention is to develop glass strands coated with a sizing,<br>
composition which is particularly suited to the process for moulding.by simultaneous<br>
spraying and which makes it possible to increase the lifetime of the blades of the cutter<br>
without, however, modifying the processing conditions and without affecting the other<br>
properties of the strands, namely their ability to be impregnated by the resin. As was<br>
indicated above, this is because it is essential for the strands to be able to be rapidly<br>
impregnated by the resin as there is, in this instance, no prior blending of the strands and<br>
the resin before the spraying stage.<br>
A subject-matter of the present invention, is therefore glass strands coated with an<br>
essentially aqueous sizing composition which is characterized in that it comprises the<br>
combination<br>
in which:<br>
R1. R2, R3. R4, R5 and R6, which are identical or different, represent a C1- C6,<br>
preferably C1 C3, alkyl radical<br>
Z represents a C1-C16 hydrocarbonaceous chain which can comprise one or more N,<br>
O and/or S heteroatoms<br>
- and of at least one unsaturated monosilane (B) chosen from vinylsilanes and<br>
(meth)acrylosilanes.<br>
In the present invention, the term "glass strands coated with a sizing composition"<br>
is understood to mean glass strands "which have been coated with a sizing composition<br>
which comprises ...", that is to say not only glass strands coated with the composition in<br>
question as they are obtained at the immediate outlet of the sizing member(s) but also<br>
these same strands after they have been subjected to one or more other treatments, for<br>
example a stage(s) of drying, for the purpose of removing the solvent from the<br>
composition, and/or of polymerization/crosslinking of some constituents of the said<br>
composition.<br>
Still in the context of the invention, the term "strands" should be understood as<br>
meaning the base strands resulting from the gathering together under the spinneret of a<br>
multitude of filaments and the products derived from these strands, in particular the<br>
assemblages of these base strands into ravings. Such assemblages can be obtained by<br>
simultaneously reeling off several wound base strand packages and by then gathering<br>
them together into slivers which are wound off onto a rotating support. It can also be<br>
"direct" ravings with a count (or mass per unit length) equivalent to that of the assembled<br>
ravings obtained by gathering together filaments directly under the spinneret and winding<br>
onto a rotating support<br>
Still according to the invention, the term "essentially aqueous sizing, composition"<br>
is understood to mean a composition which comprises at least 90% by weight of water,<br>
preferably at least 93% and better still at least 94%, at least one adhesion agent and at<br>
least one lubricant.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the glass strands are<br>
coated with a sizing composition, the bissilane (A) of which corresponds to the formula<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 have the meaning given above,<br>
A, B and C, which are identical or different, represent a C1-C16 hydrocarbonaceous<br>
chain, the sum of the carbon atoms of A, B and C being less than or equal to 16,<br>
n is equal to 0,1, 2 or 3,<br>
R7 and R8, which are identical or different, represent H or a methyl or ethyl radical.<br>
Preferably, the sizing composition comprises the bissilane (A) of abovementioned<br>
formula in which:<br>
R1, R2, R3. R4, R5 and R6, which are identical, represent a methyl or ethyl radical,<br>
A and C, which are identical or amerent, represent a meinyiene, emyene 01<br>
propylene radical,<br>
B represents an ethylene radical,<br>
n is equal to 0 or 1,<br>
R7 and R« represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
In a particularly preferred way, the bissilane (A) corresponds to the preceding<br>
formula, in which:<br>
R1. R2. R3. R4, R5 and R6, which are identical, represent a methyl radical,<br>
A and C represent a propylene radical,<br>
n is equal to 0,<br>
R7 and R8 represent a hydrogen atom.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the glass strands are coated<br>
with a sizing composition, the unsaturated monosilane (B) of which is chosen from<br>
(meth)acrylosilanes.<br>
The combination of the bissilane (A) and of the unsaturated monosilane (B)<br>
proves to be advantageous for forming glass strands exhibiting an improved ability to be<br>
cut. it has been found that the bissilane (A) is a very effective agent for embrittling glass :<br>
a very dilute aqueous solution of this bissilane, of the order of 0.01% by weight, is<br>
sufficient to produce the desired effect. It seems that the embrittling effect is related to the<br>
high affinity of the bissilane for glass: this is explained by the formation of relatively<br>
strong bonds between the silicon atoms carried by the bissilane and the oxygen of the<br>
free hydroxyl groups of the glass, which bonds lead to embrittlement of the glass at the<br>
surface. By introducing the moncsilane (B) into the composition, which monosilane acts<br>
as a "protective" agent opposing the cutting action of the bissilane (A), it is possible to<br>
adjust the ability of the strand to be cut. Generally, entirely satisfactory results are<br>
obtained with a bissilane (A)/monosilane (B) ratio by weight of between 0.1 and 6,<br>
preferably 0.3 and 3 and better still 0.6 and 2.<br>
Mention may be made, as examples of preferred monosilanes (B), of<br>
- for the vinylsilanes: vinyttrialkoxysilanes, in particular vinyltriethoxysilane and<br>
vinyltri(methoxyethoxy)silane,<br>
- for the (meth)acrylosilanes [(meth)acryloxyalkyl]trialkoxysilanes, in particular<br>
(methacryloxypropyl)triethoxysilane, and (meth)acrylamidoalkyltrialkoxysilanes,<br>
in particular methacrylamidopropyltrialkoxysilane.<br>
(Meth)acrylamidoalkyltrialkoxysilanes are particularly preferred.<br>
Glass strands coated with a sizing composition combining<br>
aminobis(propyltrimethoxysilane) and methacrylamidopropyltrialkoxysilane have proved to<br>
be particularly advantageous for the targeted application of moulding by simultaneous<br>
spraying.<br>
In accordance with the definition given above, the sizing composition coating the<br>
glass strands comprises at least one adhesion agent. This adhesion agent is generally<br>
chosen from homopolymers or copolymers based on vinyl acetate, polyurethanes, epoxys<br>
and polyesters.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of examples of vinyl acetate homopolymers, of<br>
poly(vinyl acetate)s having a low molecular mass, that is to say of less than or equal to<br>
60 000, preferably of between 40 000 and60 000, and better still of the order of 50 000<br>
Mention may be made, by way of examples of copolymers based on vinyl acetate,<br>
of copolymers of vinyl acetate and of at least one other monomer capable of<br>
copolymerizing with the latter, such as an unsaturated monomer, in particular ethylene<br>
and N-methylolacrylamide, or a monomer including an epoxide functional group.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of examples of polyurethanes, of the compounds<br>
obtained by reaction of at least one polyisocyanate and of at least one polyol. The<br>
polyurethanes resulting from polyols with aliphatic; and/or cycloaliphatic chains are<br>
preferred.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of examples of epoxys, of the compounds<br>
exhibiting an epoxide number of less than 450, preferably of greater than 180, resulting in<br>
particular from the reaction of bisphenol A and epichlorohydrin, in the form of an aqueous<br>
emulsion, or modified in order to render them soluble in water.<br>
Mention may be made, by way of examples of polyesters, of saturated or slightly<br>
unsaturated polyesters. These polyesters are generally used in the form of an aqueous<br>
emulsion.<br>
The composition advantageously comprises the combination of at least two<br>
adhesion agents, at least one of which is a poly(vinyl acetate) or a polyurethane.<br>
Preferably, the choice is made to combine a poly(vinyl acetate) or a polyurethane and a<br>
copolymer based on vinyl acetate, or a poly(vinyl acetate) and a polyurethane. In a<br>
particularly preferred way, a poly(vinyl acetate) and a vinyl acetate/N-methylolacrylamide<br>
copolymer, a polyurethane and a vinyl acetate/epoxide or ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA)<br>
copolymer, and a polyurethane and a poly(vinyl acetate) are combined.<br>
In addition, a plasticizing agent can be introduced into the sizing composition, the<br>
role of which plasticizing agent is to render more flexible the constituent polymer chains of<br>
the adhesion agent(s), in particular when they are homopolymers or the vinyl acetate/N-<br>
methylolacrylamide copolymer. The plasticizing agent makes it possible to lower the glass<br>
transition temperature (Tg) of the adhesion agents, which improves the "conformability" of<br>
the blend of cut strands and resin, that is to say the ability to match the shape of the<br>
mould, and for this reason proves to be particularly advantageous when the shape is<br>
complex. The plasticizing agent is generally chosen from glycol derivatives, such as<br>
alkylene glycol dibenzoates and preferably ethylene and/or propylene glycol dibenzoates.<br>
The amount of plasticizing agent in the sizing composition very obviously depends<br>
on the degree of flexibility which it is desired to confer on the strand, it being understood<br>
that the strand must, however, be sufficiently stiff to allow it to be correctly distributed<br>
within the resin. When one or more vinyl acetate homopolymers is/are used, in<br>
combination or not in combination with the vinyl acetate/N-methylolacrylamide copolymer,<br>
this amount is such that the ratio by weight of the plasticizing agent to the sum of the<br>
homopolymers and of the vinyl acetate/N-methylolacrylamide copolymer is between 0.05<br>
and 0.2, preferably 0.10 and 0.15, expressed on a dry basis.<br>
The composition can also comprise at least one lubricating and/or antistatic<br>
agent, the role of which is in particular to protect the strands from mechanical abrasion<br>
during their manufacture. This agent is generally chosen from cationic compounds of the<br>
polyalkyleneimide type and nonionic compounds of the esters of fatty acids and of<br>
poly(alkylene glycol)s poly(oxyalkylene) type, such as poly(ethylene glycol) monolaurate,<br>
or of the poly(oxyalkylenated) fatty amides type, such as polyoxyethylenated<br>
hydrogenated tallow amides.<br>
The glass strands coated with the sizing composition in accordance with the<br>
invention exhibit a loss on ignition of less than 1.5%, preferably of between 0.9 and 1.3%.<br>
Generally, the glass strands in accordance with the invention exist in the form of<br>
wound base strand packages which are subjected to a heat treatment. This treatment is<br>
intended essentially to remove the water introduced by the sizing composition and, if<br>
appropriate, to accelerate the crosslinking of the adhesion agents. The conditions for the<br>
treatment of the wound packages can vary according to the mass of the wound package.<br>
The drying is generally carried out at a temperature of the order of 110 to 140°C for<br>
several hours, preferably 12 to 18 hours.<br>
As has already been said, the base strands thus obtained are generally removed<br>
from the wound package and combined with several other base strands into a sliver which<br>
is subsequently wound off onto a rotating support to form a roving. It has unexpectedly<br>
been found that the application of a composition including a cationic antistatic agent of the<br>
quaternary ammonium salt type to the strands makes it possible to reinforce the ability of<br>
the strands to be cut. Thus, by depositing the abovementioned composition on the base<br>
strands, after removing from the wound package and gathering together to form the sliver,<br>
the lifetime of the blades is significantly improved. The strands are preferably coated with<br>
an aqueous composition comprising 20 to 35% and preferably of the order of 25% by<br>
weight of cocotrimethylammonium chloride.<br>
The strands coated with the sizing composition according to the invention, if<br>
appropriate with the composition described in the preceding paragraph, can be composed<br>
of glass of any nature provided that it is suitable for fiberizing, for example made of E, C<br>
or AR glass and preferably of E glass.<br>
These same strands are composed of filaments with a diameter which can vary<br>
within a wide range, for example from 9 to 24 urn, and preferably 10 to 15 pm, and better<br>
still 11 to 13 pm.<br>
The strands advantageously have a count of between 40 and 70 tex and better<br>
still of the order of 57 tex. For this reason, even when filaments with a relatively large<br>
diameter are used, the strand retains an acceptable stiffness and remains capable of<br>
perfectly matching the shape of the mould. In add"tion, the cut glass strands are evenly<br>
and homogeneously distributed within the resin during the simultaneous spraying, which<br>
makes it possible to have excellent reinforcement.<br>
Another subject-matter of the invention relates to the sizing composition capable<br>
of coating the said glass strands, which composition is characterized in that it comprises :<br>
at least one bissilane (A) corresponding to the abovementioned formula,<br>
at least one monosilane (B),<br>
at least one adhesion agent,<br>
at least one lubricating agent,<br>
and water.<br>
Preferably, the sizing composition comprises :<br>
0.05 to 0.4% by weight of bissilane (A),<br>
0.05 to 0.4% by weight of monosilane (B),<br>
3.9 to 6.8% by weight of adhesion agent,<br>
0.01 to 0.4% by weight of lubricating agent,<br>
and at least 90% of water.<br>
Preferably, the sizing composition comprises at least 93% by weight of water and<br>
better still at least 94%.<br>
it is possible to introduce other silanes into the sizing composition. In this case,<br>
the total content of silanes does not exceed 1% by weight of the composition, preferably<br>
0.8%.<br>
The solids content of the sizing composition is generally between 2 and 10%,<br>
preferably 4 and 8%, and advantageously of the order of 6%.<br>
A subject-matter of the invention also relates to the composites comprising the<br>
glass strands coated with the sizing composition. Such composites comprise at least one<br>
thermosetting polymer material, preferably a polyester and/or an epoxy, and glass<br>
strands, all or part of which is/are composed of glass strands in accordance with the<br>
invention. The level of glass within the composite is generally between 20 and 40% by<br>
weight and preferably between 25 and 35%. In addition to their improved ability to be cut,<br>
the glass strands according to the invention are noteworthy in that they allow the material<br>
which they reinforce to have better behaviour towards ageing. This is reflected in<br>
particular by a greater resistance to flexural stress and shear stress, as indicated<br>
subsequently in the following implementational examples, which are intended to illustrate<br>
the invention without, however, limiting it.<br>
EXAMPLE 1 (COMPARATIVE)<br>
Preparation is carried out of a sizing composition comprising (as % by weight):<br>
- diaminosilane(1) 0.30<br>
- vinyltriethoxysilane(2&gt; 0.30<br>
- adhesion agent: poly(vinyl acetate)0" (MW 50 000) 7.75<br>
- adhesion agent: copolymer of vinyl acetate and of<br>
N-methylolacrylamide(4) 3.00<br>
- plasticizer: mixture of diethylene glycol dibenzoate and of<br>
propylene glycol dibenzoate(5} (50:50 ratio by weight) 0.70<br>
- nonionic lubricant: polyethylene glycol 400 monolaurate(6&gt; 0.30<br>
- lubricant: polyethyleneimide with free amide functional groups"7* 0.05<br>
- water q.s. for 100<br>
- formic acid q.s. for obtaining a pH equal to 4,<br>
3 600 litres of the sizing composition are prepared in the following way :<br>
The aminosilane and then, 20 minutes later, the vinyltriethoxysilane are<br>
introduced into a first vessel containing a solution composed of 1 800 I of water and 1.5<br>
kg of formic acid (80% by volume). If appropriate, the pH of the solution is adjusted to<br>
approximately 4.5 by addition of formic acid.<br>
The two adhesion agents are successively introduced into a second vessel, the<br>
mixture is diluted with stirring to approximately 400 litres with water, and the plasticizer<br>
and the nonionic lubricant(6) are added. The mixture is left stirring for at least 15 minutes<br>
and is diluted with water to 1 000 litres.<br>
By virtue of the combination of the plasticizer and the nonionic lubricant, this<br>
"plasticization" stage is short.<br>
The lubricant(7) is introduced into a third vessel and is diluted to 10-20 times its<br>
weight with water.<br>
The plasticized mixture of the second vessel and the lubricant of the third vessel<br>
are introduced into the first vessel and the volume is made up with water until a volume of<br>
3 600 I is obtained. If necessary, the pH of the sizing composition thus obtained is<br>
adjusted to approximately 4 by addition of formic acid. The solids content of this<br>
composition is 7%.<br>
The sizing composition thus obtained is used to coat, in a known way, filaments of<br>
E glass with a diameter of approximately 12 mm drawn from streams of molten glass<br>
flowing from the 2 400 orifices of a spinneret, the filaments subsequently being gathered<br>
together in the form of a wound base strand package with a count equal to 57 tex.<br>
The wound package is subsequently dried at 130°C for 12 hours.<br>
The base strands are removed from the wound package and are gathered<br>
together into rovings composed of 42 base strands, constituting a first batch. A second<br>
batch of rovings is obtained by removing the base strands from the wound package and<br>
application, to the assembled sliver, of an aqueous antistatic solution comprising 25% by<br>
weight of cocotrimethylammonium chloride (pH adjusted to 4 by addition of formic acid;<br>
level deposited on a dry basis: 0.06 %).<br>
The strand unwound from the roving is inserted into a cutting device comprising<br>
two blades, a blade made of hard steel and a blade made of rapidly wearing "soft" steel<br>
(heat treatment at 550°C), and strength and temperature sensors. The cutting, carried out<br>
at 20°C under a relative humidity of 40%, is adjusted in order to form cut strands with a<br>
length of 25 mm. The ability to be cut is measured by the mass of the glass strands which<br>
can be cut until the appearance of a strand with twice the length (2 x 25 mm). The value 1<br>
is assigned to the mass of cut strands obtained with the strands which have been<br>
subjected to the additional stage of antistatic treatment, which value is used here as<br>
reference value for measuring the ability to be cut. With the untreated glass strands, the<br>
ability to be cut is 0.7.<br>

EXAMPLES 16 TO 18<br>
j<br>
The properties of the glass strand coated with the sizing composition are<br>
evaluated under the following conditions:<br>
dry spraying<br>
The glass strand removed from the roving is introduced into a spray gun (Venus<br>
from Matrasur) which makes it possible to cut it and to spray it horizontally without<br>
addition of resin. The quality of the reeling off of the strand and the properties of the cut<br>
strands (stiffness, defibration and "dumping") are thus assessed.<br>
simultaneous spraying<br>
The evaluation is carried out under the conditions of the dry test of the preceding<br>
paragraph, this time in the presence of unsaturated orthophthalic polyester resin<br>
(Norsodyne S 2010 V, sold by Cray Valley) which has a viscosity of 5.6 poises at 18°C<br>
and a moderate reactivity and is non-thixotropic. The resin and the cut strands are<br>
sprayed simultaneously onto the walls of a mould in the form of a staircase which<br>
comprises a vertical wall with a height of 1 m, then a stair with a depth of 0.2 m arid a<br>
height of 0.2 m, and finally a horizontal wall with a length of 1 m. The appearance of the<br>
carpet, the wetting speed, the final impregnation ("core") and the vertical wall strength are<br>
evaluated. The content of glass in the final composite is of the order of 30%.<br>
mechanical properties of the composites<br>
The glass strand is used to form a plaque with parallel strands according to<br>
Standard ISO 9291. Test specimens are cut out from this plaque and are usec for<br>
measuring the flexural and shear tensile strengths under the conditions of Standards ISO<br>
14125 and 14130 respectively.<br>
The results, corresponding to the glass strands of Examples 1, 2 and 4 Which<br>
have been subjected to the stage of treatment by the antistatic agent, are collated in<br>
Table 1 (Examples 16,17 and 18 respectively).<br>
In this table, the evaluations relating to the dry spraying and to the simultaneous<br>
spraying are defined according to the following scale of values: 1 = very poor, 2 = poor,<br>
3 = fairly good, 4 = good and 5 = very good.<br>
On reading Table 1, it is found that the glass strands of Examples 17 and 18 in<br>
accordance with the invention behave on spraying, in particular on dry spraying, similarly<br>
to the strands of the prior art illustrated by Example 16. As regards more particularly the<br>
simultaneous spraying, it is noticed that, with the strands according to the invention, an<br>
improvement in the final impregnation and in the vertical wall strength is even obtained.<br>
Although exhibiting a lower level of performance, the appearance of the carpet and the<br>
wetting speed remain within limits which are entirely satisfactory for the targeted<br>
application.<br>
Furthermore, it should be noted that, in an entirely unexpected way, the<br>
composites incorporating the glass strands according to the invention exhibit a markedly<br>
j<br>
improved resistance to ageing. This is because the measurements of flexural tensile<br>
strength and shear tensile strength are reflected by a loss (in %) which is less than that of<br>
the composites of the comparative example, in particular with the composite using the<br>
strands of Example 17.<br>
The glass strands coated with the sizing composition which combines the bissilane<br>
(A) and the unsaturated monosilane (B) are therefore remarkable in that they have a<br>
better ability to be cut, make possible retention of the mechanical reinforcing properties<br>
and make possible better behaviour under ageing conditions, under conventional<br>
conditions of use.<br>
