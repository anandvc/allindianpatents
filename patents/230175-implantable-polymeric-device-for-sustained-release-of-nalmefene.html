OF NALMEFENE<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. provisional application no.<br>
60/474,916, filed May 30,2003, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
[0002] The invention provides a nonbioerodible, polymeric device for subcutaneous<br>
implantation and sustained release of nalmefene for treatment of alcoholism nicotine<br>
dependence, or another condition for which nalmefene administration is therapeutically<br>
beneficial.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] In the U.S., 14 million people suffer from alcohol dependency or met diagnostic<br>
criteria for alcohol abuse disorder (NIAAA statistics). Available treatment methods for<br>
alcohol dependence include brief intervention, behavioral and cognitive-behavioral<br>
approaches, psychosocial and motivation-enhancement methods, and pharmacotherapies.<br>
Most alcoholics initially achieve a period of sobriety with or without formal treatment.<br>
However, many return to drinking within a short period of time. Thus, alqoholism is a<br>
chronic relapsing disorder. The first months following cessation of drinking show the<br>
highest risk for relapse and offer the greatest opportunity for pharmacological intervention.<br>
However, success with pharmacotherapy is often limited by poor patient compliance,<br>
variability in blood levels of the drug, and adverse effects associated with drug toxicity at<br>
the doses required for clinical efficacy. A long-term delivery system would improve upon<br>
several aspects of pharmacotherapy for alcohol dependence.<br>
[0004] Aversive therapy with disulfiram (Antabuse) was the only pharmacological<br>
treatment for alcohol dependence available in the U.S. for many years. However, therapy<br>
with this drag suffered from high rates of severe adverse reactions, drinking relapse, and<br>
medication noncompliance. (Fuller et al. (1986) JAMA 256:1449-55) Naltrexone was<br>
approved in 1994 as a nonaversive prescription drug for alcohol dependence. (Croop et al.<br>
(1997) Arch Gen Psychiatry 54(12): 1130-35; O'Malley et al. (1992) Arch Gen Psychiatry<br><br>
49(11):881-87; Volpicelli et al. Arch Gen Psychiatry 49(11):876-80) Reduced risk of<br>
relapse to,heavy drinking is observed among those who are highly compliant with<br>
treatment. (O'Malley et al. (1996) Arch Gen Psychiatry 53(3):217-24; Oslin et al. (1997)<br>
Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 5(4):324-32; Volpicelli et al. (1997) Arch Gen Psychiatry<br>
54(8):737-42) Use of naltrexone has certain limitations, including intolerable nausea<br>
(Croop et al., supra) and dose-dependent hepatotoxic side effects. Thus, this medication is<br>
contraindicated in alcoholic patients withliver disease. (Physicians' Desk Reference 1997;<br>
51st edition: 957-59)<br>
[0005] Nalmefene is a pure opioid antagonist structurally similar to naltrexone, and is<br>
approved in the U.S. for reversal of effects of opioids and the management of opioid<br>
overdose (nalmefene hydrochloride; Revex®). Nalmefene has no agonist activity and thus<br>
no abuse potential (Fudala et al. (1991) Clin Pharmacol Ther 49(3):300-306), a longer half-<br>
life (Dixon et al. (1986) Clin Pharmacol Ther 39(l):49-53), and no serious adverse effects<br>
such as respiratory depression or hepatotoxicity.<br>
[0006] Nalmefene has been shown to be effective in animal models of alcoholism<br>
(Chow et al. (1997) Behav.Pharmacol 8(8):725~35; Hubbell et al. (1991) Alcohol 8(5):355-<br>
67; June et al. (1998) Alcohol Clin Exp Res 22(9):2174-85). Nalmefene acts on µ,δ,and K<br>
receptors, providing more effective control of the non-µ receptor reinforcing effects of<br>
drinking man naltrexone, which primarily blocks µ. receptors (Tabakoff and Hoffman<br>
(1983) Life Sci 32(3): 197-204; Michel et al. (1985) Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol<br>
7(4):175-77). Thus, nalmefene provides pharmacological and clinical advantages over<br>
naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol dependence. (Mason et al. (1999) Arch Gen<br>
Psychiatry 56(8):719-24)<br>
[0007] Nalmefene has shown efficacy in two U.S. clinical studies (Mason et al. (1999),<br>
supra; Mason et al. (1994) Alcohol Clin Exp Res 18(5): 1162-67). In a U.S. double blind,<br>
placebo-controlled study, 105 alcoholic patients who had been abstinent for two weeks<br>
received either 20 or 80 mg/day nalmefene orally, in conjunction with cognitive behavioral<br>
therapy. Fewer patients receiving nalmefene relapsed to heavy drinking (defined as &gt; 6<br>
drinks per day for men and &gt; 4 drinks per day for women) over the twelve-week study<br>
period versus placebo. One-third of the nalmefene patients did relapse, but they had<br>
significantly fewer heavy drinking episodes than relapsing patients receiving placebo.<br>
There was a significant decrease at the first weekly study visit in percentage of nalmefene-<br>
treated patients reporting any heavy drinking days. The number of abstinent days and self-<br><br>
reported craving were the same in treated and control groups. Transient nausea was<br>
observed inthe nalmefene-treated patients, although no serious adverse events occurred<br>
(Mason et al. (1999), supra). An earlier pilot study also reported a significantly lower rate<br>
of relapse as well as a greater increase in the number of abstinent days per week with 40<br>
mg oral nalmefene, when compared with placebo or 10 mg nalmefene in 21 alcohol-<br>
dependent patients. Both 40 and 10 mg doses significantly decreased the number of drinks<br>
per drinking day (Mason et al. (1994), supra).<br>
[0008] The clinical benefits of a long-term delivery system for treatment of alcoholism<br>
is illustrated by various studies that have used depots and implants. Disulfuram has been<br>
administered via subcutaneous implantation for treatment of alcoholism. Six studies<br>
showed inconsistent results but positive evidence that disulfiram reduces alcohol<br>
dependence. (Johnsen et al. (1987) Br J Addict 82(6):607-13; Johnsen and Morland (1991)<br>
Alcohol Clin Exp Res 15(3):532-36; Whyte and O'Brien (1974) Br J Psychiatry 124:42-44;<br>
Wilson et al. (1976) Br J Psychiatry 192:277-80; Wilson et al. (1978) J Stud Alcohol<br>
39(5):809-19; Wilson et al. (1980) J Stud Alcohol 41(5):429-36). Naltrexone implants have<br>
been utilized for analgesia and opioid detoxification (Misra and Pontani (1981) NIDA Res<br>
Monogr 28:254-64; Schwope et al. (1975) NIDA Res Monogr 4:13-8; Yoburn et al. (1986)<br>
J.Pharmacol Exp Ther 237(l):126-30). Complications have included pulmonary edema,<br>
prolonged withdrawal, drug toxicity, and withdrawal from cross-addiction to alcohol and<br>
benzodiazepines. (Hamilton et al. (2002) Acad Emerg Med 9(1):63-68)<br>
[0009] Once-monthly depots of naltrexone have also been studied. Clinical studies<br>
have shown a significantly lower percentage of heavy drinking days in depot-treated<br>
patients (in combination with psychotherapy), versus patients receiving placebo plus<br>
therapy. The drawbacks of depot strategy include: (1) irritation observed with depots has<br>
been a limiting factor in clinical trials; (2) the irreversible nature of depots is a safety issue<br>
with respect to the irritation observed after injection, and allows less flexibility for dosing<br>
regimens; and (3) the once-monthly dosing regimen of a depot does not completely address<br>
the compliance issues associated with treatment of a chronic disease such as alcoholism.<br>
[0010] There is a need for an improved method of long-term delivery of<br>
pharmaceuticals for treatment of alcoholism. A long-term method for continuous<br>
administration of nalmefene, which results in fewer adverse side effects than naltrexone or<br>
sulfuram, would be beneficial for treatment of alcoholism.<br><br>
[0011] Nalmefene has also been shown to be effective for treatment of other<br>
conditions, such as, for example, nicotine dependence, impulse control disorders, for<br>
example pathological gambling, interstitial cystitis, narcotic overdose, pruritis, for example<br>
associated with cholestasis, and epidural-induced side effects, and for reversal of opioid<br>
sedation and reduction of food intake. An improved method for administering nalmefene<br>
for any of these indications, without the peaks and troughs associated with other means of<br>
administration and with improved patient compliance due to continuous dosing, would be<br>
desirable.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0012] The invention provides compositions (i. e., implantable polymeric devices),<br>
methods, and kits for treatment of alcoholism or nicotine dependence, or another condition<br>
for which nalmefene administration is therapeutically beneficial.<br>
[0013] In one aspect, the invention provides an implantable device for administration of<br>
nalmefene to a mammal in need thereof, which includes nalmefene encapsulated in a<br>
biocompatible, nonerodible polymeric matrix. After subcutaneous implantation in a<br>
•mammal, an implantable device of the invention releases nalmefene continuously in vivo<br>
through pores that open to the surface of the matrix at a rate that results in a plasma<br>
nalmefene level of at least about 0.01 ng/ml at steady state. In some embodiments, an<br>
implantable device of the invention includes ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) as a<br>
biocompatible, nonerodible polymer for formation of the polymeric matrix. In one<br>
embodiment, the vinyl acetate content of EVA used for preparation of the polymeric matrix<br>
is often about 33 %. In various embodiments, the nalmefene content in an implantable<br>
device of the invention is about 0.01 to about 90%, or any of at least about 0.01, 0.05,1,5,<br>
10,20, 50,65,70,75, 80, 85, or 90%. Implantable devices often release nalmefene<br>
continuously in vivo for at least about 2 weeks, or 1,3,6,9,12,15,18,21, or 24 months,<br>
In some embodiments, implantable devices of the invention are produced using an<br>
extrusion process to produce devices with dimensions of about 2 to about 3 mm in diameter<br>
and about 2 to about 3 cm in length, although other shapes and sizes are contemplated and<br>
are within the skill of the art. Generally, an implantable device of the invention releases<br>
nalmefene at a rate of about 0.01 to about 10 mg/day at steady state in vitro or in vivo. In<br>
one embodiment, the implantable devices release nalmefene at a rate of at least about 0.01<br>
mg/day. In some embodiments, an implantable device of the invention include a<br><br>
diffusional barrier. In one embodiment, the diffusional barrier includes EVA, and<br>
optionally further includes nalmefene, for example EVA loaded with 10 or 20% nalmefene<br>
by weight.<br>
[0014] In another aspect, the invention provides a method for administration of<br>
nalmefene to a mammal in need thereof. Methods of the invention include subcutaneous<br>
administration of at least one implantable device as described above. In some<br>
embodiments, the methods include subcutaneous implantation of a multiplicity of the<br>
devices. In one embodiment, the device or devices release nalmefene at a steady state level<br>
'that is therapeutically effective for treatment of alcoholism in an individual in need of<br>
treatment. In another embodiment, the device or devices release nalmefene at a steady state<br>
level that is therapeutically effective for treatment of nicotine addiction. Often, a<br>
therapeutically effective steady state plasma level is at least about 0.01 ng/ml. Typically,<br>
each device, or the combination of a multiplicity of devices, continuously releases at least<br>
about 0.01 ng/ml at steady state. Generally, each device, or the combination of a<br>
multiplicity of devices, releases nalmefene at a steady state rate of at least about 0.01<br>
mg/day in vitro or in vivo. In various embodiments, one or a multiplicity of devices is<br>
subcutaneously implanted in an individual on the upper arm, the back, and/or the abdomen;<br>
[0015] • In another aspect, the invention provides a kit comprising at least one<br>
implantable device as described above and instructions for use in a method of<br>
administration of nalmefene to a mammal in need thereof. In some embodiments, kits of<br>
the invention include a multiplicity of individual nalmefene-containing implantable<br>
devices. In one embodiment, a kit is provided for treatment of alcoholism. In another<br>
embodiment, a kit is provided for treatment of nicotine dependence.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0018] The invention provides a biocompatible, nonerodible polymeric device, which<br>
permits controlled, sustained release of nalmefene over extended periods of time when<br>
implanted subcutaneously in an individual in need of treatment<br>
[0019] Continuous release of a compound in vivo over an extended duration may be<br>
achieved via implantation of a device containing the compound encapsulated in a<br>
nonerodible polymeric matrix. Examples of implantable, nonerodible polymeric devices<br>
for continuous drug release are described in, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,883,666, 5,114,719, and<br>
5,601,835. Implantation of the device and extended release of nalmefene improves<br>
compliance with dosing regimens, eliminating the need for repeated injections or ingestion<br>
of pills or tablets. An implantable, sustained-release device according to the present<br>
invention also permits achievement of more constant blood levels of nalmefene than<br>
injectable or oral dosage forms, thereby minimizing side effects and improving therapeutic<br>
effectiveness.<br>
[0020] Devices of the invention include one or more non-bioerodible polymers. Such<br>
polymers release compounds at linear-rates for extended time periods of several months or<br>
longer, in contrast to bioerodible polymers,, which do not exhibit linear release kinetics due<br>
to formation of channels in-the matrix as it erodes, resulting in increased release rates over<br>
time. The present invention includes a biocompatible, nonerodible polymer that exhibits<br>
generally linear release kinetics for nalmefene in vivo, after an initial burst.<br>
Implantable Polymeric Devices<br>
[0021] The invention includes implantable devices for administration of nalmefene to<br>
an individual in need thereof. Implantable devices of the invention contain nalmefene<br>
encapsulated in a polymeric, nonerodible matrix. As used herein, "nalmefene" refers to<br>
nalmefene and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, such as for example, nalmefene<br>
HC1. Incorporation of nalmefene into the polymeric matrix causes the formation of a series<br>
of interconnecting channels and pores that are accessible to the surface for release of the<br>
drag. Where appropriate, a coating that is impermeable to the drug is placed over at least a<br>
portion of the device to further regulate the rate of release. Often, because nalmefene is<br>
highly soluble in aqueous environments, a diffusional barrier is added to the outer surface<br>
of the implantable devise to achieve a lower release rate in vivo. Examples of coating<br><br>
compositions include EVA or nalmefene-loaded EVA. For example, EVA loaded with<br>
about 10 or 20% nalmefene by weight may be used.<br>
[0022] When implanted subcutaneously, devices of the invention continuously release<br>
nalmefene for an extended period of time with a pseudo or near zero order release rate.<br>
After an initial burst following implantation, release rates are typically within about 10-<br>
20% of the steady state average.<br>
[0023] In some embodiments, the initial burst of nalmefene released in vivo after<br>
implantation is reduced or minimized by prewashing the implantable devices before<br>
implantation to remove surface nalmefene. Prewashing may be performed in any solution<br>
in which nalmefene is soluble, for example ethanol or normal saline, often for about 30<br>
minutes.<br>
[0024] As used herein, "nonerodible matrix" refers to a polymeric carrier that is<br>
sufficiently resistant to chemical and/or physical destruction by the environment of use<br>
such that the matrix remains essentially intact throughout the release period. The polymer<br>
is generally hydrophobic so that it retains its integrity for. a suitable period of time when<br>
placed in an aqueous environment, such as the body of a mammal, and stable enough to be<br>
stored for an extended period before use. The ideal polymer must also be strong, yet<br>
flexible enough so that it does not crumble or fragment during use. Nonerodible matrices<br>
remain intact in vivo for extended periods of time, typically months or years. Drug<br>
molecules encapsulated in the matrix are released over time via diffusion through channels<br>
and pores in a sustained and predictable manner. The release rate can be altered by<br>
modifying the percent drug loading, porosity of the matrix, structure of the implantable<br>
device, or hydrophobicity of the matrix, or by adding a hydrophobic coating to the exterior<br>
of the implantable device.<br>
[0025] Typically, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) is used as the polymeric<br>
matrix, but other nonerodible materials may be used. Examples of other suitable materials<br>
include silicone, hydrogels such as crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(hydroxy<br>
ethylmethacrylate), acyl substituted cellulose acetates and alkyl derivatives thereof,<br>
partially and completely hydrolyzed alkylene-vinyl acetate copolymers, unplasticized<br>
polyvinyl chloride, crosslinked homo- and copolymers of polyvinyl acetate, crosslinked<br>
polyesters of acrylic acid and/or methacrylic acid, polyvinyl alkyl ethers, polyvinyl<br>
fluoride, polycarbonate, polyurethane, polyamide, polysulphones, styrene acrylonitrile<br>
copolymers, crosslinked poly(ethylene oxide), poly(alkylenes), poly(vinyl imidazole),<br><br>
poly(esters), poly(ethylene terephthalate), polyphosphazenes, and chlorosulphonated<br>
polyolefines, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0026] Implantable devices of the invention are typically formulated with nalmefene<br>
loading of at least about 0.01%, often about 0.01 to about 90 %. Devices are often<br>
formulated as compositions that include a polymeric matrix mat includes EVA (33%<br>
acetate) and any of at least about 0.01, 0.05, 0.1,0.5,1, 5,10,20,50, 65, 70,75, 80, 85, or<br>
90% nalmefene. Devices may be produced using an extrusion process, wherein ground<br>
EVA is blended with nalmefene, melted, and extruded into rod-shaped structures. Rods are<br>
cut into individual implantable devices of the desired length, packaged, and sterilized prior<br>
to use. Other methods for encapsulating therapeutic compounds in implantable polymeric,<br>
nonerodible matrices are well known to those of skill in the art. Such methods include, for<br>
example, solvent casting (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,883,666,5,114,719, and 5,601,835). A<br>
skilled artisan would be able to readily determine an appropriate method of preparing such<br>
an implantable device, depending on the shape, size, drug loading, and release kinetics<br>
desired for a.particular type of patient or clinical indication.<br>
[0027].. Devices of the invention are suitable for sustained release of nalmefene for<br>
treatment-of alcoholism or another condition for. which administration of nalmefene is<br>
 therapeutically beneficial, such as, for example, treatment of nicotine dependence. Other<br>
examples of uses for devices of the invention include treatment of impulse control<br>
disorders, for example pathological gambling, interstitial cystitis, narcotic overdose,<br>
pruritis, for example associated with cholestasis, reversal of opioid sedation, treatment of<br>
epidural-induced side effects, and reduction of food intake.<br>
[0028] As used herein, "sustained release" refers to the release of nalmefene such that<br>
the blood concentration remains within the therapeutic range but below toxic levels for an<br>
extended duration. Devices of the invention generally exhibit near zero-order<br>
pharmacokinetics in vivo, similar to kinetics achieved with an IV drip, but without the need<br>
for external medical equipment and personnel associated with intravenous methods.<br>
Generally, after implantation, the devices release therapeutically effective amounts of<br>
nalmefene for periods of several months up to one year or longer.<br>
[0029] Multiple implantable devices may be used, or the size and shape of the devices<br>
may be modified, to achieve a desired overall dosage. Implantable devices are often about<br>
0.5 to about 10, more often about 1.5 to about 5, most often about 2 to about 3 cm in<br>
length, and are often about 0.5 to about 7, more often about 1.5 to about 5, most often about<br><br>
2 to about 3 ram in diameter. The release rate of implantable devices may also be modified<br>
by changing the vinyl acetate content in the EVA polymer matrix. The vinyl acetate<br>
content is often about 2 to about 40, more often about 10 to about 35, most often about 30<br>
to about 35 % by weight. In one embodiment, the vinyl acetate content is about 33% by<br>
weight. The release rate may also be modified by coating the exterior surface of the<br>
implant with a diffusional barrier, such as an erodible or non-erodible polymer, for example<br>
EVA. Often, the surface is coated with about 25 weight percent EVA. In one embodiment,<br>
the diffusional barrier contains nalmefene, e.g., nalmefene-loaded EVA. The diffusional<br>
barrier may include, for example, any of the polymers listed in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,883,666,<br>
5,114,719, or 5,601,835.<br>
Methods of the Invention<br>
[0030] The invention provides methods for administration of nalmefene to an<br>
individual in need thereof. Nalmefene may be administered to an individual in accordance<br>
with the methods of the invention for treatment of a condition such as alcoholism,- nicotine<br>
dependence, or another condition for which administration of nalmefene is therapeutically<br>
beneficial, such as those listed above.<br>
[003-1] In one embodiment, nalmefene is administered according to the methods of the<br>
invention for treatment for alcoholism. As used herein, "alcoholism" refers to a primary,<br>
chronic disease wifh genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors influencing its<br>
development and manifestations. The disease is often progressive and fatal. It is<br>
characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use<br>
of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions of thinking, most notably denial.<br>
Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic.<br>
[0032] In another embodiment, nalmefene is administered according to the methods of<br>
the invention for treatment of nicotine dependence.<br>
[0033] Methods of the invention include subcutaneous administration of one or more<br>
polymeric implantable devices which include nalmefene encapsulated within a<br>
biocompatible, nonerodible polymeric matrix, e.g., EVA, and release of nalmefene in a<br>
controlled manner over an extended period of time through multiple pores that open to the<br>
surface of the implantable device(s). Often, implantable devices are produced via an<br>
extrusion process, as described above.<br><br>
[0034] Implantable devices are administered by subcutaneous implantation to an<br>
individual in need of treatment with nalmefene. As used herein, "individual" refers to a<br>
mammal, such as a human in need of treatment for alcoholism, nicotine dependence, or<br>
. another condition for which administration of nalmefene is therapeutically beneficial.<br>
Generally, implantable devices are administered by subcutaneous implantation at sites<br>
including, but not limited to, the upper arm, back, or abdomen of an individual. Other<br>
suitable sites for administration may be readily determined by a medical professional.<br>
Multiple implantable devices may be administered to achieve a desired dosage for<br>
treatment.<br>
[0035] Typically, an implantable device or a multiplicity of devices is administered that<br>
will release nalmefene at a rate that will maintain a therapeutically effective plasma level<br>
for an extended period of time of at least about 2 weeks, or 1,3,6,9,12,15,18,21, or 24<br>
months. Often, the duration of implantation, with continuous release of nalmefene, is from<br>
about 3 months to about 2 years, about 3 months to about 1 year, about 3 months to about 9<br>
months, or about 3.months to about 6 months.<br>
[0036] : The desired dosage rate will. depend upon factors such as the underlying<br>
condition for which nalmefene is being administered, and the physiology of a particular<br>
patient,, but will.be readily ascertainable to physicians. Nalmefene is desirably released<br>
from one or a multiplicity of implanted devices at a rate that maintains plasma levels of the<br>
drug at a therapeutically effective level. Maintenance of nalmefene at a fairly constant<br>
plasma level often permits dosing at a lower level than with other therapies, such as oral<br>
administration.<br>
[0037] As used herein, "therapeutically effective amount" or "therapeutically effective<br>
level" refers to the amount of nalmefene that will render a desired therapeutic outcome, i.e.,<br>
a level or amount effective to reduce or alleviate symptoms of the condition for which<br>
nalmefene is administered. For example, a positive therapeutic outcome for treatment of<br>
alcoholism may include a decrease in relapse rate and increase in time to first relapse,<br>
increase in abstinence and number of abstinent days, decrease in alcohol consumption and<br>
number of drinks per day, and decrease in craving for alcohol. An amount that is<br>
"therapeutically effective" for a particular patient may depend upon such factors as a<br>
patient's age, weight, physiology, and/or the particular symptoms or condition to be treated,<br>
and will be ascertainable by a medical professional. When multiple devices are<br><br>
administered, the combination of the devices releases naimefene at a rate that will achieve a<br>
therapeutically effective plasma level.<br>
[0038] A therapeutically effective plasma level for treatment of alcoholism is often<br>
about 0.01 to about 70, about 0.05 to about 50, about 0.1 to about 25, or about 1 to about 10<br>
ng/ml. Often, sustained release at this dosage rate occurs for about 2 weeks to about 1 year<br>
or longer (e.g., at least about 3, 6, 9,12,15,18,21, or 24 months). In various<br>
embodiments, an implantable device of the invention may release naimefene in vivo at a<br>
rate that results in a steady-state plasma level of at least about 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,1,2, 3,4,<br>
5,10,20,30,40, 50, 60, or 70 ng/ml. Typically, the release rate of naimefene used for<br>
treatment of alcoholism is from about 0.01 to about 10 mg/day/implant.<br>
[0039] In some embodiments, naimefene is administered via implantable devices of the<br>
invention for treatment of alcoholism, in conjunction with other therapies including but not<br>
limited to brief intervention, community reinforcement, motivational enhancement, family<br>
therapy, social skills training, cognitive therapy, biofeedback, detoxification, electrical<br>
stimulation, aversion therapy stress management, antidepressants, hypnosis, acupuncture,*<br>
alcoholics anonymous 12 step program, psychotherapy, tobacco cessation, GABA agonists,<br>
or opiate antagonists.<br>
[0040] In methods for treatmentof nicotine dependence, one or a multiplicity of.<br>
nalmefene-containing implantable devices, as described above, are implanted in an<br>
individual in need of treatment, such that total release of naimefene at steady state is about<br>
0.01 to about 10 mg/day, and the steady state plasma level is about 0.01 to about 100<br>
ng/ml, about 0.05 to about 50, about 0.1 to about 25, or about 1 to about 10 ng/ml, or at<br>
least about at least about 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,1,2, 3,4,5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,<br>
or 100 ng/ml for at least about 2 weeks to about 1 year or longer (e.g., at least about 3,6, 9,<br>
12,15,18,21, or 24 months).<br>
[0041] It is anticipated that the implantable devices of the invention will alleviate<br>
compliance difficulties, as described above. In methods of the invention, long term<br>
continuous release of naimefene generally reduces or eliminates the peaks and troughs of<br>
blood concentration of naimefene associated with other formulations such as oral or<br>
injectable dosage forms, which often permits dosing at a lower level than traditional<br>
treatment regimens. This often reduces or alleviates adverse side effects associated with<br>
higher dosages.<br><br>
Kits<br>
[0042] The invention also provides kits for use in treatment of alcoholism, nicotine<br>
dependence, or another condition for which nalmefene administration is therapeutically<br>
beneficial, as described above. The kits contain at least one implantable, nonerodible<br>
device of the type herein described, capable of delivering long-term therapeutic levels of<br>
nalmefene, in suitable packaging, along with instructions providing information to the user<br>
and/or health care provider regarding subcutaneous implantation and use of the system for<br>
treating a condition for which nalmefene administration is therapeutically beneficial, such<br>
as, for example, alcoholism or nicotine dependence. Kits may also include literature<br>
discussing performance of the implantable devices of the invention.<br>
[0043] Kits include a delivery system, i. e., one or a multiplicity of implantable devices,<br>
capable of providing sustained release of therapeutic levels of nalmefene for at least about<br>
2 weeks, often at least about 3 months. In kits of the invention, an implantable device or<br>
devices may be preloaded into an apparatus or apparatuses suitable for subcutaneous<br>
implantation of the device(s) into a patient, such as, for example, a syringe or trocar. Kits,<br>
may also contain one or more oral dosage forms of nalmefene for titration of the nalmefene<br>
dose.<br>
. [0044] Kits for treatment of alcoholism typically contain a polymeric, nonerodible<br>
delivery.system capable of continuously releasing nalmefene at a rate sufficient to achieve<br>
a therapeutically effective nalmefene plasma level, often about 0.01 to about 70, about 0.05<br>
to about 50, about 0.1 to about 25 ng/ml, or about 1 to about 10 ng/ml, for at least about 3<br>
months. In various embodiments, a delivery system is capable of releasing nalmefene in<br>
vivo at a rate that results in a steady-state plasma level of at least about 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,<br>
1,2,3,4, 5,10,20, 30,40,50,60, or 70 ng/ml. Often, sustained release at this dosage rate<br>
occurs for at least about 3 months to about 1 year or longer (e.g., at least about 3,6,9, or<br>
12,15,18,21, or 24 months). Kits of the invention may include a delivery system capable<br>
of releasing about 0.01 to about 10 mg/day nalmefene in vitro or in vivo.<br>
[0045] Kits for treatment of nicotine dependence typically contain a delivery system<br>
capable of continuous nalmefene release at a steady-state level of 0.01 to about 100 ng/ml,<br>
about 0.05 to about 50, about 0.1 to about 25 ng/ml, or about 1 to about 10 ng/ml, or at<br>
least about 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.5,1,2,3,4,5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90, or 100 ng/ml.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0046] The following examples are intended to illustrate but not limit the invention.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of Nalmefene Implants<br>
[0047] Implantable devices were prepared using an extrusion process. Nalmefene HC1<br>
was dried at 115 -118°C under high vacuum. The final moisture content of the nalmefene<br>
was 0.3870%. Moisture content was determined by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA).<br>
Extrusion was performed using a blend of 65% nalmefene and 35% EVA (33% vinyl<br>
acetate). The processing conditions that were used are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
[0048] The extruded fiber was cut into 27 mm implants. These implants were coated<br>
using a 0.1% solution of 33% EVA dissolved in methylene chloride using a fluid-bed<br>
coater. The coating conditions were as shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
[0049] The implants were packaged and sterilized by gamma radiation (2.5 mrads).<br>
Example 2 - Characterization of Extruded Implantable Devices<br>
[0050] Extruded rods prepared as described above were characterized for total drug<br>
load and for rate of drug release.<br>
Photomicrography<br>
[0051] The surface and interior morphology of implants prepared as in Example 1 were<br>
examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Implants were fractured<br>
cryogenically to expose the interior of the implant. Photomicrographs were taken to show<br>
one image of the microstructure of the lateral surface of the implant and one image of a<br>
cross section. From the SEM micrographs, the distribution of nalmefene and the coating<br>
looked very homogeneous.<br>
Assessment of Drug Loading<br>
[0052] The nalmefene content in the implants was determined by extracting the<br>
nalmefene with methylene chloride and quantitating the nalmefene using an HPLC method.<br>
The dimensions, weight, and nalmefene content of the implants is presented in Table 3.<br><br>
Assessment of In Vitro Drug Release<br>
[0053] The in vitro release rate of nalmefene from the implants was determined by placing<br>
the implants in amber bottles containing 100 ml of normal saline. The sample bottles were<br><br>
placed in a 37°C water bath agitating at 50 rpm. 100 µl sample aliquots were taken at<br>
various time points and replaced with fresh normal saline. The collected samples were<br>
analyzed for nalmefene HC1 at each time point The in vitro release studies showed that a<br>
steady state release rate was gradually attained after an initial burst (Fig. 1). The total<br>
percent of nalmefene release from the implants over 56 days was 30.4%. This study<br>
indicates that nalmefene can be released from the implantable devices at a controlled rate<br>
over an extended period of time.<br>
Example 3-In Vivo Evaluation of Nalmefene Loaded Implantable Devices<br>
[0054] Implants were prepared by extrusion of a 30:70 blend of EVA copolymer (33%<br>
vinyl acetate) and nalmefene HC1 at an elevated temperature, yielding filaments with a 2.5<br>
mm diameter, from which 2.6 cm implants were cut. The surface of the implants was<br>
coated with an EVA suspension (14 wt% EVA in water with sodium lauryl sulfate) using a<br>
Wurster fiuidized bed coater to produce a 25 wt% coating. Implants were sterilized with y-<br>
radiation. In vitro release of nalmefene from coated and uncoated implants, both including<br>
70% nalmefene hydrochloride, was determined by release into 100 ml of saline at 37°C,<br>
followed by HPLC analysis. The in vitro drug release from uncoated implants was 26-52<br>
mg/day. Coating the surface of the implants with 25 wt% EVA reduced the release rate to<br>
0.286-0.607 mg/day. Gamma sterilization of the implants had no effect on the release<br>
rates.<br>
[0055] Wistar-derived rats were surgically implanted with either 1 (n=8) or 3 (n=8)<br>
implants containing 73 mg of nalmefene per implant. Implants were placed subcutaneously<br>
on the back of the animal parallel to the spine. Plasma samples were taken from the tail<br>
vein before implant, and after implantation at 6 and 12 hours on day 1, every 48 hours until<br>
day 7, weekly until week 12 and then every 2 weeks until the end of the study at 24 weeks.<br>
Three animals from each group were terminated at 12 weeks, and the implants were<br>
explanted for content analysis. The animals were euthanized, and the skin along the back<br>
was resected to visualize the implants. The implants were photographed, removed, and<br>
analyzed by HPLC. The remaining animals were maintained until 24 weeks, at which time<br>
three animals from each group were terminated in the same manner. The remaining two<br>
animals from each group were explanted under anesthesia, and plasma samples taken at<br><br>
hours 3,6,9,12,24, and 48, to obtain elimination pharmacokinetic data. These animals<br>
wereterminated at the end of 48 hours.<br>
[0056] Pig. 2 shows the mean nalmefene plasma levels of each group throughout the<br>
course of the study. Plasma nalmefene levels from the animals with three implants were<br>
approximately three times higher than those of the animals with one implant at all time<br>
points. Two plasma level phases were observed, a "burst" phase of high levels that<br>
dropped by three weeks post-implantation, followed by a sustained-release phase from 3-24<br>
weeks, during which time the plasma concentrations were 3.2 ± 0.6 ng/ml and 8.8 ± 0.7<br>
ng/ml for the groups with one and three implants, respectively. Nalmefene release was<br>
0.23 ± 0.05 mg/implant/day. The elimination phase, monitored in four animals (two per<br>
group), showed plasma nalmefene levels below quantifiable limits (0.05 ng/ml) by six<br>
hours post-explantation.<br>
[0057] During the "burst," plasma concentrations reached 33 ng/ml for the one-implant<br>
group and 90 ng/ml for the three-implant group, approximately 10 times the plasma levels<br>
during sustained release.. Approximately 38% of nalmefene release occurs during the first<br>
three weeks, while the remaining 62% is released during the 21 week sustained-release<br>
period; At the end of nearly 6 months, approximately 25% of the initial drug remained in<br>
the implants.<br>
[0058] Results from this study indicate that nalmefene implants can provide sustained<br>
plasma levels of the drug for 6 months. Macroscopic examination of all implant sites<br>
showed no irritation. No adverse effects were observed for the duration of the study.<br>
Example 4 - Preparation and Evaluation of Implantable Devices Coated with<br>
Nalmefene-loaded EVA<br>
Materials<br>
[0059] Poly (ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (EVA) pellets (33 wt % vinyl acetate) were<br>
obtained from Aldrich. Nalmefene hydrochloride was obtained from Diosynth.<br>
Methods<br>
Cryogenic grinding of EVA<br>
[0060] The particle size of the EVA was reduced prior to dry blending with the<br>
nalmefene. 530 g of EVA pellets was milled in a Retsch ZM 100 Ultra Centrifugal Mill<br><br>
(Glen Mills, Inc., Clifton, NJ). The EVA was premixed with liquid nitrogen and then<br>
transferred to the grinding chamber of the mill, where it passed through a 0.5 mm screen at<br>
a speed of 18,000 rpm. The milled EVA was sieved with a 850 urn screen and particles<br>
that were less than 850 µm were dried under vacuum at room temperature for 3 days. The<br>
yield of milled EVA less than 850 urn was about 350 g.<br>
Particle size reduction and drying ofnalmefene hydrochloride<br>
[0061] Three hundred grams of nalmefene hydrochloride was ground with a mortar and<br>
pestle to reduce the particle size and then sieved to collect particles between 53 and 180<br>
µm. The sieved nalmefene hydrochloride was dried in a vacuum oven for about 12 hours at<br>
118°C. Due to clumping of the nalmefene particles, the dried nalmefene was re-sieved to<br>
collect particles between 53 and 180 µm.<br>
[0062] The moisture content of the nalmefene before and after drying was determined<br>
by thermal gravimetric analysis using a TA Instruments Thermogravimetric Analyzer.<br>
Nalmefene samples were heated from 20 to 120°C at 5°C per minute until equilibrated at<br>
120°C. The temperature was then ramped to 214°C at 2°C per minute. The initial moisture<br>
content before drying was about 4.4% and after drying, the moisture content was reduced to<br>
about 0.03%.<br>
[0063] The particle size of the nalmefene before and after sieving was determined using<br>
a Coulter LS 13,230 particle size analyzer. A solution of 0.1% Span 85/heptane was used<br>
to suspend the nalmefene particles for the particle size analysis. The mean particle size<br>
before sieving was 203.5 urn and the mean particle size after sieving was 99.87 µm.<br>
Preparation of dry blends for extrusion<br>
[0064] Nalmefene and EVA, prepared as described above, were combined in a screw-<br>
cap glass jar. The jar was sealed and inverted several times for 5 minutes while<br>
occasionally rotating the jar sideways until the components were uniformly mixed as<br>
indicated by visual appearance. The nalmefene/EVA blends were prepared inside a glove<br>
box under nitrogen to keep the nalmefene dry.<br>
Preparation of coated nalmefene implant formulations<br>
[0065] Coated implants were prepared using a two-step process. The core was first<br>
extruded as a monolithic rod using an RCP-0500 extruder. A coating was then applied<br><br>
separately by passing the rod through a heated die coating assembly containing the coating<br>
material.<br>
[0066] A monolithic rod was prepared from a 75/25 nalmefene/EVA blend using an<br>
RCP-0500 extruder using process conditions as shown in Table 4.<br><br>
[0067] Seven cm length samples were cut from the 75/25 nalmefene/EVA rod to<br>
prepare coated implants. A stainless steel die coating assembly with a 4.4 mm diameter<br>
orifice was preheated to about 127°C and was then loaded with a coating material of a 10<br>
or 20% nalmefene in EVA. Each implant was suspended on a needle and then passed<br>
through the orifice of the die coating assembly where it was coated with the molten coating<br>
material.<br>
[0068] Coated implants were cooled to room temperature and then cut to lengths of 5.2<br>
cm. The ends of the coated implants were sealed with the respective molten coating<br>
material.<br>
Core loading determination procedure<br>
[0069] Triplicate samples (20 to 40 mg) of implant formulations were placed in 50 ml<br>
screw-cap culture tubes. Five ml of methylene chloride was added to each sample. The<br>
tubes were sealed and sonicated for approximately 10 minutes, or longer if required for<br>
complete disintegration of the samples by visual inspection.<br><br>
[0070] Forty ml of deionized water was added to each sample and vortexed vigorously<br>
for 60 seconds to extract the nalmefcne from the methylene chloride suspension. The<br>
samples were permitted to stand at room temperature for approximately 1 hour with<br>
frequent vortexing. The samples were then permitted to stand at room temperature until the<br>
two layers separated. The upper layer (deionized water) from each sample was transferred<br>
to a 100 ml volumetric flask. Thirty ml of deionized water was added to each sample.<br>
Samples were then vortexed vigorously for 30 seconds. The tubes were then permitted to<br>
stand at room temperature until the two layers separated. The upper layer was combined<br>
with the upper layer from the previous extraction in the appropriate volumetric flask.<br>
[0071] Each flask was diluted to volume with deionized water and mixed thoroughly.<br>
Approximately 1.5 ml of each sample was transferred into a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube<br>
and centrifuged for 5 minutes at 8,000 rpm to separate the two layers. Approximately 1 ml<br>
of each sample was transferred to an HPLC vial for analysis. Samples were diluted with<br>
deionized water as appropriate for keeping sample concentrations within the limits of the<br>
standard curve.<br>
[0072] Triplicate control samples were prepared consisting of approximately 30 mg of<br>
nalmefcne and 10 mg of EVA and processed as above.<br>
In vitro release procedure<br>
[0073] Coated implants were weighed and placed in clear glass bottles containing 100<br>
ml of normal saline. The bottles were scaled with Teflon-lined screw caps and placed in a<br>
37 ± 2°C shaking water bath and agitated at 50 rpm. Samples were removed for analysis<br>
after 15 minutes, 1,2, and 5 hours, and 1, 2,4, 7,10, and 14 days. At each time point, a 2<br>
ml aliquot was removed for analysis and replaced with 2 ml normal saline, except for the 4,<br>
10, and 14 day time points, when the implants were transferred to bottles containing 100 ml<br>
of fresh normal saline. Samples removed for analysis were stored at 2-8°C until analyzed<br>
by HPLC for nalmefene content.<br>
[0074] Operating conditions for HPLC analysis were as shown in Table 5.<br><br><br><br>
Results<br>
Nalmefene content of implant formulations<br>
[0075] Nalmefene content in coated and uncoated implants was determined using the<br>
core loading determination procedure described above. Mean recoveries were 96,90, and<br>
101% of the theoretical loading for uncoated implants, coated implants with 10%<br>
nalmefene coating, and coated implants with 20% nalmefene coating, respectively. The<br>
mean recovery for nalmefene/EVA control samples was 97%.<br>
In vitro nalmefene release<br>
[0076] in vitro release of nalmefene from coated and uncoated implants was<br>
determined as described above.<br>
[0077] By Day 14, uncoated implants released approximately 92% of the nalmefene<br>
core loading compared to approximately 33-36% for implants with a 10% nalmefene<br>
coating and approximately 65% for implants with a 20% nalmefene coating. With a low<br>
initial burst, the coated implants provided a steady release of nalmefene through Day 14.<br>
[0078] Coated implant samples were sterilized by exposure to 2.5 (± 10%) Mrads of<br>
gamma radiation. Very little difference in the release profiles was observed between the<br>
sterilized and unsterilized implant formulations containing the 10% nalmefene coating.<br>
