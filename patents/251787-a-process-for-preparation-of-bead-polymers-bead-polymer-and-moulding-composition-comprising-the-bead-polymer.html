				<td>Method for producation of bead polymers with an average particle size in the range of 1 µm to 40 µm and moulded masses and moulded bodies<br>
comprising bead polymers<br>
The present invention relates to processes for preparation of bead polymers whose average particle size is in the range from 1µm to 40 µm, by dispersing and polymerizing a polymerizable composition in an aqueous phase. The present invention further relates to moulding compositions and mouldings which comprise the inventively prepared bead polymers.<br>
Various applications require bead polymers whose particle diameter is of the order of size of from 1 µm to 40µm with relatively narrow particle size distribution. One of the uses of these beads, among others, is as additives for PMMA moulding compositions.<br>
A particular application sector here is that of light-scattering moulding compositions. In this sector, standard moulding compositions are blended with what are known as scattering beads, which have crosslinking and whose refractive index differs from that of the matrix. Materials currently used in these moulding compositions are scattering particles based on PMMA whose particle size is well above 40 µm. The advantage of these scattering particles is the high degree of forward scattering of the mouldings once the scattering particles have been incorporated into the moulding compositions. Because the loss via backward scattering is smaller, the result here is substantially higher luminous efficiency when comparison is made with traditional opacifiers, e.g. BaSO4 or TiO2, at a high level of scattering. This preferred forward scattering can be determined via measurement of transmittance in combination with the halved-<br><br>
energy angle or halved-intensity angle of mouldings comprising scattering beads.<br>
The smaller the particle size of the scattering beads, the higher the level of scattering effect for an identical proportion by weight in the moulding composition. Use of smaller beads can therefore reduce their amount. This saves costs and conserves resources. Furthermore, the moulding compositions equipped with the smaller bead polymers exhibit excellent mechanical properties, because the reduced amount of scattering beads has a less marked effect on these properties. If scattering beads whose diameter is smaller than 5 µm are used, the resultant moulding compositions appear markedly more yellow.<br>
Furthermore, the beads described above can also be used for matted moulding compositions and polyalkyi (meth)acrylate (PAMA) plastisols. However, these application sectors are not of pnme importance in the present invention.<br>
Polymer particles whose order of size is from 1µm to 10µm can be produced with good results by way of a precipitation polymerization reaction in which large amounts of organic solvents are used. However, the solvents used create problems of safety and disposal. There are also problems with work-up. Beads obtained in this way are therefore expensive and, for reasons of cost, are not used in the application sectors described above.<br>
Polymer beads can be obtained via conventional suspension polymerization reaction at lower cost. However, the size of the resultant particles is generally greater than 40µm, with broad distribution.<br><br>
By way of example, European Patent Application EP 0 443 609 A2 discloses a suspension process for preparation of bead polymers by combining two separately introduced phases (monomers and continuous phase) into a mixing cell with a high level of shear energy and then polymerizing the monomers in a conventional reaction vessel. Various auxiliaries are mentioned for stabilization of the dispersion. Among these are, inter alia, inorganic substances, such as calcium phosphate, and organic compounds, such as cellulose derivatives or polyvinyl alcohol. EP 0 443 609 A2 does not describe the use of aluminium compounds.<br>
Monomers used in EP 0 443 609 A2 are, inter alia, styrene and (meth)acrylates. The examples show polymerization of monomer mixtures which encompass 80% by weight of styrene and 20% by weight of butyl acrylate. The resultant polymer particles here have particle sizes in the range from 5µm to 10 µm. EP 0 443 609 A2 does not describe the use of a crosslinking agent.<br>
According to EP 0 443 609 A2, the polymer particles can in particular be used in the powder-production industry. However, they are not suitable for light-scattering moulding compositions because the non-crossiinked polymer particles would dissolve in the moulding composition to be prepared and would therefore be ineffective as light-scattering particles.<br>
The specification DE 100 65 501 A1 discloses a process for preparation of bead polymers whose average particle size is in the range from 1µm to 40µm, by dispersing and polymerizing, in an aqueous phase, a polymerizable composition which comprises at least 50% by weight of (meth)acrylates. The dispersion, stabilized by an aluminium compound, is prepared at a shear rate &gt; 103 s"'.<br><br>
The resultant bead polymers are used, inter alia, for production of mouldings with matt surface, and the mouldings shown in the associated examples have transmittance to DIN 5036 in the range from 76.3 to 91.1, yellowness index to DIN 6167 in the range from 2.9 to 9.4 and halved-energy angle in the range from 18.5 to 22.5. However, a higher level of scattering action is desirable for many applications.<br>
In view of the prior art stated and discussed herein, it was therefore an object of the present invention to provide mouldings which scatter light more markedly which at the same time have maximum transparency and minimum yellowness index. The intention here was to achieve the improvement in scattering action in a manner which minimizes cost.<br>
These objects, and also other objects which although not expressly mentioned can be derived in a self-evident manner from the circumstances discussed herein or are a necessary result of these circumstances, are achieved via mouldings obtainable from bead polymers which are obtainable via the process according to Claim 1. Accordingly, the present invention protects the process for preparation of the bead polymers, the bead polymers, the moulding compositions encompassing the bead polymers and the mouldings obtainable from the moulding compositions. The respective dependent subclaims describe particularly useful embodiments of the process, of the bead polymers, of the moulding compositions and of the mouldings.<br>
Surprisingly, a process for preparation of high-specification bead polymers whose average particle size is in the range from 1µm to 40 µm is provided, without use of large amounts of any organic solvent requiring disposal after the polymerization reaction, by dispersing and polymerizing a polymerizable composition composed as stated in Claim 1 in an aqueous phase, where the<br><br>
dispersion stabilized by an aluminium compound is prepared at a shear rate<br>
The inventive measures achieve in particular the following advantages, inter alia:<br>
The inventive process permits filtration of the resultant bead polymers. The polymerization process of the present invention can be carried out using commercially available systems.<br>
According to the invention, the bead polymers can be obtained with relatively little safety risk, because the amounts of organic solvents used are zero or only minimal. This in particular can eliminate the liberation or handling of environmentally hazardous substances. The bead polymers are extremely inexpensive.<br>
Bead polymers prepared according to the invention exhibit a very high level of scattering action when incorporated into moulding compositions and moulded to give mouldings. They moreover feature low yellowness index, high transmittance and a large halved-intensity angle.<br>
The average particle size of the bead polymers prepared for the purposes of the present invention is in the range from 1 |Lim to 40 |am, preferably in the range from 5 |im to 35 [im. The particle size is based on the particle diameter. This value can be obtained by way of example via laser extinction methods. A CIS particle analyser from L.O.T. GmbH can be used for this purpose, and the measurement method for determination of particle size is found in the user manual. This method is preferred. Particle size can also be determined via measurement and counting of the particles on appropriate scanning electron micrographs.<br>
Particular embodiments of the inventively prepared bead polymers exhibit narrow size distribution. The standard deviation from the average particle<br><br>
diameter is particularly preferably

2,3-epoxycyclohexyl methacrylate, 10,11-epoxyhexadecyl methacrylate;<br>
glycidyl methacrylate.<br>
These monomers can be used individually or in the form of a mixture.<br><br>
The polymerization reaction is generally initiated by known free-radical initiators. Among the preferred initiators are, inter alia, the azo initiators well known to persons skilled in the art, e.g. AIBN and 1,1-azobiscyclohexanecarbonitrile, and also peroxy compounds, such as methyl ethyl ketone peroxide, acetylacetone peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, tert-butyl 2-ethylperhexanoate, ketone peroxide, methyl isobutyl ketone peroxide, cyclohexanone peroxide, dibenzoyi peroxide, tert-butyl peroxybenzoate, tert-butyl isopropyl peroxycarbonate, 2,5-bis(2-ethylhexanoylperoxy)-2,5-dimethylhexane, tert-butylperoxy 2-ethylhexanoate, tert-butyl peroxy 3,5,5-trimethylhexanoate, dicumyl peroxide, 1,1-bis(tert-butylperoxy)cyclohexane, 1,1-bis(tert-butylperoxy)-3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexane, cumyl hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, bis(4-tert-butylcyclohexyl) peroxydicarbonate, mixtures of two or more of the abovementioned compounds with one another, and also mixtures of the abovementioned compounds with compounds not mentioned above which can likewise form free radicals.<br>
The amount used of these compounds is often from 0.1 to 10.0% by weight, preferably from 0.5 to 3.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers.<br>
The water .monomer ratio is usually in the range from 0.4:1 to 20:1, preferably from 2:1 to 8:1, based on the weight of the components.<br>
In order to stabilize the dispersion, it is necessary to use aluminium compounds sparingly soluble in water. Among these are in particular aluminium oxide AI2O3 and aluminium hydroxide AI(0H)3, preference being given to AI(0H)3. Aluminium hydroxide of particular interest is prepared via precipitation, and the time between this precipitation and subsequent formation of the dispersion should be minimized. In particular embodiments of the inventive process, the precipitation takes place within 2 hours, preferably within a period of 1 hour, and very<br><br>
particularly preferably within a period of 30 minutes, prior to formation of the dispersion.<br>
By way of example, Al2(SO4)3 can be dissolved in water. This solution can then be treated with a sodium carbonate solution until the pH is in the range from 5 to 5.5. This procedure gives a particularly preferred colloidal dispersion of the aluminium compound in water.<br>
The amount of aluminium compound used is from 0.5 to 200.0% by weight, particularly preferably from 3.0 to 100.0% by weight and very particularly preferably from 4.0 to 20.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers used. If smaller amounts are used, there is a risk of obtaining merely an unstable dispersion and a phase separation occurs, or at least formation of relatively large aggregates. If the amounts used are larger, there is a risk that it will be impossible to produce a uniform dispersion.<br>
Other processes of particular interest are those in which other auxiliaries are used alongside the aluminium compound for stabilization. Among these are in particular surfactants, such as anionic, cationic and neutral emulsifiers.<br>
Examples of anionic emulsifiers are alkali metal salts of higher fatty acids having from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, such as palmitic, stearic and oleic acid, alkali metal salts of sulphonic acids having by way of example from 8 to 30 carbon atoms, in particular sodium salts of alkyl- or arylalkylsulphonic acids, alkali metal salts of half-esters of phthalic acid, and alkali metal salts of resin acids, such as abietic acid.<br>
Among cationic emulsifiers are, inter alia, salts of long-chain, in particular unsaturated, amines having from 10 to 20 carbon atoms, or quaternary ammonium compounds having relatively long-chain olefin or paraffin radicals.<br><br>
Examples of neutral emulsifiers are ethoxylated fatty alcohols, ethoxylated fatty acids and ethoxylated phenols and fatty acid esters of polyhydric alcohols, such as pentaerythritol or sorbitol.<br>
The amounts used of the abovementioned emulsifiers are preferably in the range from 0.0 to 5.0% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.3 to 3.0% by weight, based on the weight of aluminium compound.<br>
It is moreover possible for the conventional additives and auxiliaries to be added to the mixture prior to, during or after formation of the dispersion. Among these are in particular substances which give the particles particular properties, e.g. polymers, dyes and pigments, if appropriate having ferromagnetic properties. Complexing agents, such as EDTAor Trilon A, and compounds, such as polyethylene glycol, which inhibit formation of tank deposit can moreover be used.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the dispersion process takes place at a shear rate &gt; 10^ s-1 The shear rate is preferably in the range from 10"^ s-1 to 10 s-1. At shear rates 
The dispersion can be prepared by any process suitable for this purpose. Dispersers known to the person skilled in the art are generally used for this purpose. Among these are Dispermat, VMA-Getzmann, Reichshof; Ultra-Turrax, Janke and Kunkel, Staufen and pressure homogenizer, Gaulin, Lubeck. There are also known devices using a rotor-stator system, for example Dispax, Janke and Kunkel, Staufen; Cavitron homogenizers, V. Hagen &amp; Funke,<br><br>
Sprochhovei; homogenizers from Kotthoff, Essen and homogenizers from Doee Oliver, Grevenbroich, These devices are usually operated at rotation rates of from 1000 to 25 000 rpm, preferably from 2000 to 25 000 rpm. Other ways of generating the high shear forces required to form the dispersion are exposure to ultrasound, use of high pressure to discharge the mixture to be dispersed through a narrow gap or through small-diameter nozzles, or use of colloid mills.<br>
Dispersion of the monomers and of the other constituents of the reaction mixture generally takes place at temperatures in the range from 0 to 100°C, preferably in the range from 20 to 60°C, with no restriction thereto.<br>
The dispersion time can be in a wide range as a function of the desired diameter of the monomer droplets, of the size distribution to be established and of the quantitative proportions of the constituents of the mixture. The dispersion can generally be prepared within a period of a few hours.<br>
The dispersion process generally takes place prior to the start of the polymerization reaction. However, in particular at the start at the polymerization reaction, the dispersion can be exposed to a high shear force, in order to eliminate any possible formation of relatively large aggregates. On the other hand, the polymerization reaction should take place soon after formation of the dispersion. Surprisingly, however, it has been found that the dispersion stabilized by the aluminium compound can be stored for a relatively long period. This property makes it easier to use conventional polymerization systems, because, unlike in many conventional processes, there is no requirement for exposure to shear forces at the start of the polymerization reaction.<br>
The polymerization reaction can be carried out at atmospheric pressure, or subatmospheric or superatmospheric pressure. Neither is the polymerization temperature critical. However, as a function of the initiator system used, it is<br><br>
generally in the range from 0° to 200°C, preferably from 40° to 130X and particularly preferably from 60° to 120°C, with no intended resultant restriction.<br>
Once the polymerization reaction has ended, the aluminium compound can be converted into a water-soluble form, for example via addition of sulphuric or hydrochloric acid. The bead polymer can be isolated via pressure filtration from the water without difficulty. If known organic compounds are used instead of the aluminium compound significant according to the invention for stabilization of the dispersion, this type of filtration is prevented by the rheological properties of the mixture.<br>
The bead polymers obtained according to the process described above are used in particular in moulding compositions, which are likewise provided by this invention. Suitable matrix polymers are any of the thermoplastically processible polymers known for this purpose. Among these are, inter alia, polyalkyi (meth)acrylates, such as polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA), polyacrylonitriles, polystyrenes, polyethers, polyesters, polycarbonates, polyvinyl chlorides. Among these, preference is given to polyalkyi (meth)acrylates. These polymers can be used individually or else in the form of a mixture. These polymers can also be present in the form of copolymers.<br>
The refractive indices of the matrix polymer and of the bead polymer are advantageously different from one another, their difference preferably being at least 0.02.<br>
The content of the bead polymer, based on the total weight of the moulding composition, is advantageously from 0.1% by weight to 20.0% by weight, preferably from 1.0% by weight to 15.0% by weight, with advantage from 3.0% by weight to 10.0% by weight, in particular from 4.0 to 8.0% by weight.<br><br>
The moulding compositions can comprise conventional additives of any type. Among these are, inter alia, antistatic agents, antioxidants, mould-release agents, flame retardants, lubricants, dyes, flow improvers, fillers, light stabilizers and organophosphorus compounds, such as phosphites or phosphonates, pigments, weathering stabilizers and plasticizers.<br>
Known processes, such as extrusion, can be used to produce mouldings with light-scattering properties from the moulding compositions described above. The transmittance to DIN 5036 of these mouldings is advantageously greater than 40.0%, preferably greater than 45.0%, in particular greater than 50.0%, The halved-intensity angle (li) of the mouldings is advantageously in the range from 35.0° to less than 90.0°, preferably in the range from 50.0° to less than 90.0°, in particular in the range from 72.0° to less than 90.0°. The mouldings moreover advantageously feature a yellowness index to DIN 6167 smaller than 10.0%, preferably smaller than 9.5%. in particular smaller than 9.0%.<br>
If there is no refractive index difference between the matrix and the scattering beads, the result is mouldings with a matt surface.<br>
Inventive examples and comparative examples are used below to provide more detailed illustration of the invention, but there is no intention that the invention be restricted to these inventive examples.<br>
Scattering beads A and C-F<br>
To prepare the suspension polymer, an aluminium hydroxide Pickering stabilizer is used, prepared via precipitation from aluminium sulphate and soda solution immediately prior to the start of the actual polymerization reaction. For this, 16 g of Al2(SO4)3, 0.032 g of complexing agent (Trilon A) and 0.16 g of emulsifier (K30 emulsifier obtainable from Bayer AG; sodium salt of a C15-paraffinsulphonate) were first dissolved in 0.8 I of distilled water. A 1N<br><br>
sodium carbonate solution was then added, with stirring, at a temperature of about 40°C to the aluminium sulphate dissolved in water, whereupon the pH was then in the range from 5 to 5.5. This procedure gave a colloidal dispersion of the stabilizer in water. In order to prevent tank-wall deposit, polyethylene glycol (molar mass from 5000 to 6000 g/mol) is then added to the dispersing-agent-precipitation process.<br>
Once the stabilizer had been precipitated, the aqueous phase was transferred to a glass beaker. 200 g of a monomer mixture whose composition is stated in Table 1, and also 4 g of dilauroyl peroxide, 0.4 g of tert-butyl 2-ethyl-perhexanoate and 1.6 g of ammonium peroxodisulphate were added thereto. This mixture was dispersed for 15 minutes at 7000 rpm by means of a disperser (Ultra-Turrax S50N-G45MF, Janke and Kunkel, Staufen).<br>
Following the shear process, the reaction mixture was charged to the reactor, which was preheated to the appropriate reaction temperature of 90°C, and was polymerized at about 90°C (polymerization temperature) for 45 minutes (polymerization time) with stirring (600 rpm). A post-reaction phase of 1 hour at about 85°C internal temperature followed. After cooling to 45°C, the stabilizer was converted into water-soluble aluminium sulphate via addition of 50% strength sulphuric acid. For work-up of the beads, the resultant suspension was filtered through a commercially available filter fabric and the product was dried at 50°C for 24 hours in a heated cabinet.<br>
Size distribution was studied via laser extinction methods to determine average size V50 and the associated standard deviation. The results are collated in Table 1. The shape of the beads was spherical, and no fibres could be found. No coagulation occurred.<br>
Scattering beads G and H<br><br>
The preparation method followed the polymerization specification for scattering beads A and C-F, except that the monomer mixtures stated in Table 1 were used and no Pickering stabilizer was added.<br>
The size distribution of the resultant bead polymers is likewise stated in Table 1<br>
Scattering beads B<br>
The preparation method was substantially the same as the polymerization specification for scattering beads A and C-F, but in each case 200 times the amounts of the constituents were used. This required adoption of some changes on technical grounds. The precipitated Pickering stabilizer was used as initial charge with monomers, initiator and additives in the reactor and dispersion was then achieved at a temperature of 40°C with the aid of a through-flow disperser (Dispax-Reaktor, Janke and Kunkel). For this, the mixture was cycled through the disperser for 30 minutes, and within the reactor the dispersion was stirred at 150 rpm by a conventional stirrer.<br>
After 30 minutes, the dispersion was heated to 80°C. The polymerization reaction and work-up followed the polymerization specification for scattering beads A and C-F.<br>
The size distribution of the resultant bead polymer is likewise stated in Table 1.<br><br><br>
Light-scattering test specimens<br>
For further investigation, a standard PMMA moulding composition (PLEXIGLAS® 7N obtainable from Rohm GmbH) was modified with the amounts stated in Table 2 of scattering beads A-H. These moulding compositions were used to produce test specimens of dimension 60 mm x 45 mm x 3 mm via injection moulding, and the transmittance (T) of these to DIN 5036 was determined, as were their yellowness index (Y) to DIN 6167 and halved-intensity angle (fi) measured to DIN 5036, using a GO-T-1500 goniometer test unit from LMT.<br><br>
The resultant data are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br>
The test results in Table 2 show that when the scattering beads prepared according to the process of the present invention are compounded into moulding compositions (inventive examples 1-17), they scatter light very effectively without any great loss of energy. The scattering beads whose styrene content is 85% by weight have the highest level of scattering action here. Although scattering beads whose styrene content is lower or higher achieve a high halved-intensity angle, this falls off more rapidly with reducing concentration of the scattering beads in the moulding composition.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
