States Provisional Application No. 60/754,086, filed on December 27, 2005, and United States<br>
Provisional Application No. 60/802,458, filed on May 22, 2006, the entire contents of each of<br>
the above applications being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00101]	The present invention relates to modulators of ATP-Binding Cassette<br>
("ABC") transporters or fragments thereof, including Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane<br>
Conductance Regulator ("CFTR"), compositions thereof, and methods therewith. The present<br>
invention also relates to methods of treating ABC transporter mediated diseases using such<br>
modulators.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[00102]	ABC transporters are a family of membrane transporter proteins that<br>
regulate the transport of a wide variety of pharmacological agents, potentially toxic drugs, and<br>
xenobiotics, as well as anions. ABC transporters are homologous membrane proteins that bind<br>
and use cellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for their specific activities. Some of these<br>
transporters were discovered as multi-drug resistance proteins (like the MDR1-P glycoprotein,<br>
or the multi-drug resistance protein, MRP1), defending malignant cancer cells against<br>
chemotherapeutic agents. To date, 48 ABC Transporters have been identified and grouped into<br>
7 families based on their sequence identity and function.<br>
[00103]	ABC transporters regulate a variety of important physiological roles<br>
within the body and provide defense against harmful environmental compounds. Because of<br>
this, they represent important potential drug targets for the treatment of diseases associated with<br>
defects in the transporter, prevention of drug transport out of the target cell, and intervention in<br>
other diseases in which modulation of ABC transporter activity may be beneficial.<br>
[00104]	One member of the ABC transporter family commonly associated with<br>
disease is the cAMP/ATP-mediated anion channel, CFTR. CFTR is expressed in a variety of<br>
cells types, including absorptive and secretory epithelia cells, where it regulates anion flux<br>
across the membrane, as well as the activity of other ion channels and proteins. In epithelia<br>
cells, normal functioning of CFTR is critical for the maintenance of electrolyte transport<br><br>
throughout the body, including respiratory and digestive tissue. CFTR is composed of<br>
approximately 1480 amino acids that encode a protein made up of a tandem repeat of<br>
transmembrane domains, each containing six transmembrane helices and a nucleotide binding<br>
domain. The two transmembrane domains are linked by a large, polar, regulatory (R)-domain<br>
with multiple phosphorylation sites that regulate channel activity and cellular trafficking.<br>
[00105]	The gene encoding CFTR has been identified and sequenced (See<br>
Gregory, R. J. et al. (1990) Nature 347:382-386; Rich, D. P. et al. (1990) Nature 347:358-362),<br>
(Riordan, J. R. et al. (1989) Science 245:1066-1073). A defect in this gene causes mutations in<br>
CFTR resulting in Cystic Fibrosis ("CF"), the most common fatal genetic disease in humans.<br>
Cystic Fibrosis affects approximately one in every 2,500 infants in the United States. Within<br>
the general United States population, up to 10 million people carry a single copy of the<br>
defective gene without apparent ill effects. In contrast, individuals with two copies of the CF<br>
associated gene suffer from the debilitating and fatal effects of CF, including chronic lung<br>
disease.<br>
[00106]	In patients with cystic fibrosis, mutations in CFTR endogenously<br>
expressed in respiratory epithelia leads to reduced apical anion secretion causing an imbalance<br>
in ion and fluid transport. The resulting decrease in anion transport contributes to enhanced<br>
mucus accumulation in the lung and the accompanying microbial infections that ultimately<br>
cause death in CF patients. In addition to respiratory disease, CF patients typically suffer from<br>
gastrointestinal problems and pancreatic insufficiency that, if left untreated, results in death. In<br>
addition, the majority of males with cystic fibrosis are infertile and fertility is decreased among<br>
females with cystic fibrosis. In contrast to the severe effects of two copies of the CF associated<br>
gene, individuals with a single copy of the CF associated gene exhibit increased resistance to<br>
cholera and to dehydration resulting from diarrhea - perhaps explaining the relatively high<br>
frequency of the CF gene within the population.<br>
[00107]	Sequence analysis of the CFTR gene of CF chromosomes has revealed a<br>
variety of disease causing mutations (Cutting, G. R. et al. (1990) Nature 346:366-369; Dean, M.<br>
et al. (1990) Cell 61:863:870; and Kerem, B-S. et al. (1989) Science 245:1073-1080; Kerem, B-<br>
S et al. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:8447-8451). To date, &gt; 1000 disease causing<br>
mutations in the CF gene have been identified (http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/). The<br>
most prevalent mutation is a deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 of the CFTR amino acid<br>
sequence, and is commonly referred to as AF508-CFTR. This mutation occurs in approximately<br>
70% of the cases of cystic fibrosis and is associated with a severe disease.<br><br>
[00108]	The deletion of residue 508 in AF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein<br>
from folding correctly. This results in the inability of the mutant protein to exit the ER, and<br>
traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, the number of channels present in the membrane is<br>
far less than observed in cells expressing wild-type CFTR. In addition to impaired trafficking,<br>
the mutation results in defective channel gating. Together, the reduced number of channels in<br>
the membrane and the defective gating lead to reduced anion transport across epithelia leading<br>
to defective ion and fluid transport. (Quinton, P. M. (1990), FASEB J. 4: 2709-2727). Studies<br>
have shown, however, that the reduced numbers of AF508-CFTR in the membrane are<br>
functional, albeit less than wild-type CFTR. (Dalemans et al. (1991), Nature Lond. 354: 526-<br>
528; Denning et al., supra; Pasyk and Foskett (1995), J. Cell. Biochem. 270: 12347-50). In<br>
addition to AF508-CFTR, other disease causing mutations in CFTR that result in defective<br>
trafficking, synthesis, and/or channel gating could be up- or down-regulated to alter anion<br>
secretion and modify disease progression and/or severity.<br>
[00109]	Although CFTR transports a variety of molecules in addition to anions, it<br>
is clear that this role (the transport of anions) represents one element in an important mechanism<br>
of transporting ions and water across the epithelium. The other elements include the epithelial<br>
Na+ channel, ENaC, Na+/2C17K+ co-transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase pump and the basolateral<br>
membrane K+ channels, that are responsible for the uptake of chloride into the cell.<br>
[00110]	These elements work together to achieve directional transport across the<br>
epithelium via their selective expression and localization within the cell. Chloride absorption<br>
takes place by the coordinated activity of ENaC and CFTR present on the apical membrane and<br>
the Na+-K+-ATPase pump and Cl- channels expressed on the basoiateral surface of the cell.<br>
Secondary active transport of chloride from the luminal side leads to the accumulation of<br>
intracellular chloride, which can then passively leave the cell via Cl" channels, resulting in a<br>
vectorial transport. Arrangement of Na+/2C17K+ co-transporter, Na+-K+-ATPase pump and the<br>
basolateral membrane K+ channels on the basolateral surface and CFTR on the luminal side<br>
coordinate the secretion of chloride via CFTR on the luminal side. Because water is probably<br>
never actively transported itself, its flow across epithelia depends on tiny transepithelial osmotic<br>
gradients generated by the bulk flow of sodium and chloride.<br>
[00111]	In addition to Cystic Fibrosis, modulation of CFTR activity may be<br>
beneficial for other diseases not directly caused by mutations in CFTR, such as secretory<br>
diseases and other protein folding diseases mediated by CFTR. These include, but are not<br>
limited to, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), dry eye disease, and Sjo"gren's<br>
Syndrome.	<br><br>
[00112]	COPD is characterized by airflow limitation that is progressive and not<br>
fully reversible. The airflow limitation is due to mucus hypersecretion, emphysema, and<br>
bronchiolitis. Activators of mutant or wild-type CFTR offer a potential treatment of mucus<br>
hypersecretion and impaired mucociliary clearance that is common in COPD. Specifically,<br>
increasing anion secretion across CFTR may facilitate fluid transport into the airway surface<br>
liquid to hydrate the mucus and optimized periciliary fluid viscosity. This would lead to<br>
enhanced mucociliary clearance and a reduction in the symptoms associated with COPD. Dry<br>
eye disease is characterized by a decrease in tear aqueous production and abnormal tear film<br>
lipid, protein and mucin profiles. There are many causes of dry eye, some of which include age,<br>
Lasik eye surgery, arthritis, medications, chemical/thermal burns, allergies, and diseases, such<br>
as Cystic Fibrosis and Sjogrens's syndrome. Increasing anion secretion via CFTR would<br>
enhance fluid transport from the corneal endothelial cells and secretory glands surrounding the<br>
eye to increase corneal hydration. This would help to alleviate the symptoms associated with<br>
dry eye disease. Sjogrens's syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which the immune system<br>
attacks moisture-producing glands throughout the body, including the eye, mouth, skin,<br>
respiratory tissue, liver, vagina, and gut. Symptoms, include, dry eye, mouth, and vagina, as<br>
well as lung disease. The disease is also associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus,<br>
systemic sclerosis, and polymypositis/dermatomyositis. Defective protein trafficking is<br>
believed to cause the disease, for which treatment options are limited. Modulators of CFTR<br>
activity may hydrate the various organs afflicted by the disease and help to elevate the<br>
associated symptoms.<br>
[0.0113]	As discussed above, it is believed that the deletion of residue 508 in<br>
AF508-CFTR prevents the nascent protein from folding correctly, resulting in the inability of<br>
this mutant protein to exit the ER, and traffic to the plasma membrane. As a result, insufficient<br>
amounts of the mature protein are present at the plasma membrane and chloride transport within<br>
epithelial tissues is significantly reduced. In fact, this cellular phenomenon of defective ER<br>
processing of ABC transporters by the ER machinery has been shown to be the underlying basis<br>
not only for CF disease, but for a wide range of other isolated and inherited diseases. The two<br>
ways that the ER machinery can malfunction is either by loss of coupling to ER export of the<br>
proteins leading to degradation, or by the ER accumulation of these defective/misfolded<br>
proteins [Aridor M, et al, Nature Med., 5(7), pp 745- 751 (1999); Shastry, B.S., et al,<br>
Neurochem. International, 43, pp 1-7 (2003); Rutishauser, J., et al, Swiss Med Wkly, 132, pp<br>
211-222 (2002); Morello, JP et al, TIPS, 21., pp. 466- 469 (2000); Bross P., et al, Human Mut.,<br>
14, pp. 186-198 (1999)]. The diseases associated with the first class of ER malfunction are<br><br>
Cystic fibrosis (due to misfolded AF508-CFTR as discussed above), Hereditary emphysema<br>
(due to al-antitrypsin; non Piz variants), Hereditary hemochromatosis, Coagulation-Fibrinolysis<br>
deficiencies, such as Protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, Lipid processing<br>
deficiencies, such as Familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia,<br>
Abetalipoproteinemia, Lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/Pseudo-Hurler,<br>
Mucopolysaccharidoses (due to Lysosomal processing enzymes), Sandhof/Tay-Sachs (due to p-<br>
Hexosaminidase), Crigler-Najjar type II (due to UDP-glucuronyl-sialyc-transferase),<br>
Polyendocrinopathy/Hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus (due to Insulin receptor), Laron<br>
dwarfism (due to Growth hormone receptor), Myleoperoxidase deficiency, Primary<br>
hypoparathyroidism (due to Preproparathyroid hormone), Melanoma (due to Tyrosinase). The<br>
diseases associated with the latter class of ER malfunction are Glycanosis CDG type 1,<br>
Hereditary emphysema (due to al-Antitrypsin (PiZ variant), Congenital hyperthyroidism,<br>
Osteogenesis imperfecta (due to Type I, n, IV procollagen), Hereditary hypofibrinogenemia<br>
(due to Fibrinogen), ACT deficiency (due to al-Antichymotrypsin), Diabetes insipidus (DI),<br>
Neurophyseal DI (due to Vasopvessin hormone/V2-receptor), Neprogenic DI (due to Aquaporin<br>
II), Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome (due to Peripheral myelin protein 22), Perlizaeus-<br>
Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease ( due to (3APP and<br>
presenilins), Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive supranuclear plasy,<br>
Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders asuch as Huntington,<br>
Spinocerebullar ataxia type I, Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Dentatorubal pallidoluysian,<br>
and Myotonic dystrophy, as well as Spongiform encephalopathies, such as Hereditary<br>
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (due to Prion protein processing defect), Fabry disease (due to<br>
lysosomal cc-galactosidase A) and Straussler-Scheinker syndrome (due to Prp processing<br>
defect).<br>
[00114]	In addition to up-regulation of CFTR activity, reducing anion secretion<br>
by CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of secretory diarrheas, in which<br>
epithelial water transport is dramatically increased as a result of secretagogue activated chloride<br>
transport. The mechanism involves elevation of cAMP and stimulation of CFTR.<br>
[00115]	Although there are numerous causes of diarrhea, the major consequences<br>
of diarrheal diseases, resulting from excessive chloride transport are common to all, and include<br>
dehydration, acidosis, impaired growth and death.<br>
[00116]	Acute and chronic diarrheas represent a major medical problem in many<br>
areas of the world. Diarrhea is both a significant factor in malnutrition and the leading cause of<br>
death.(5,000,000 deaths/year) in children less than five years old:<br><br>
[00117] Secretory diarrheas are also a dangerous condition in patients of acquired<br>
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). 16<br>
million travelers to developing countries from industrialized nations every year develop<br>
diarrhea, with the severity and number of cases of diarrhea varying depending on the country<br>
and area of travel.<br>
[00118]	Diarrhea in barn animals and pets such as cows, pigs, and horses, sheep,<br>
goats, cats and dogs, also known as scours, is a major cause of death in these animals. Diarrhea<br>
can result from any major transition, such as weaning or physical movement, as well as in<br>
response to a variety of bacterial or viral infections and generally occurs within the first few<br>
hours of the animal's life.<br>
[00119]	The most common diarrhea causing bacteria is enterotoxogenic E-coli<br>
(ETEC) having the K99 pilus antigen. Common viral causes of diarrhea include rotavirus and<br>
coronavirus. Other infectious agents include cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and salmonella,<br>
among others.<br>
[00120]	Symptoms of rotaviral infection include excretion of watery feces,<br>
dehydration and weakness. Coronavirus causes a more severe illness in the newborn animals,<br>
and has a higher mortality rate than rotaviral infection. Often, however, a young animal may be<br>
infected with more than one virus or with a combination of viral and bacterial microorganisms<br>
at one time. This dramatically increases the severity of the disease.<br>
[00121]	Accordingly, there is a need for modulators of an ABC transporter<br>
activity, and compositions thereof, that can be used to modulate the activity of the ABC<br>
transporter in the cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[00122]	There is a need for method of treating ABC transoter mediated<br>
diseases using such modulators of ABC transporter activity.<br>
[00123]	There is a need for methods of modulating an ABC transporter activity in<br>
an ex vivo cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[00124]	There is a need for modulators of CFTR activity that can be used to<br>
modulate the activity of CFTR in the cell membrane of a mammal.<br>
[00125]	There is a need for methods of treating CFTR-mediated diseases using<br>
such modulators of CFTR activity.<br>
[00126]	There is a need for methods of modulating CFTR activity in an ex vivo<br>
cell membrane of a mammal.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
[00129]	As used herein, the following definitions shall apply unless otherwise<br>
indicated.<br><br>
[00130]	The term "ABC-transporter" as used herein means an ABC-transporter<br>
protein or a fragment thereof comprising at least one binding domain, wherein said protein or<br>
fragment thereof is present in vivo or in vitro. The term "binding domain" as used herein means<br>
a domain on the ABC-transporter that can bind to a modulator. See, e.g., Hwang, T. C. et al, J.<br>
Gen. Physiol. (1998): 111(3), 477-90.<br>
[00131]	The term "CFTR" as used herein means cystic fibrosis transmembrane<br>
conductance regulator or a mutation thereof capable of regulator activity, including, but not<br>
limited to, AF508 CFTR and G551D CFTR (see, e.g., http://www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/, for<br>
CFTR mutations).<br>
[00132]	The term "modulating" as used herein means increasing or decreasing,<br>
e.g. activity, by a measurable amount. Compounds that modulate ABC Transporter activity,<br>
such as CFTR activity, by increasing the activity of the ABC Transporter, e.g., a CFTR anion<br>
channel, are called agonists. Compounds that modulate ABC Transporter activity, such as<br>
CFTR activity, by decreasing the activity of the ABC Transporter, e.g., CFTR anion channel,<br>
are called antagonists. An agonist interacts with an ABC Transporter, such as CFTR anion<br>
channel, to increase the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to<br>
endogenous ligand binding. An antagonist interacts with an ABC Transporter, such as CFTR,<br>
and competes with the endogenous ligand(s) or substrate(s) for binding site(s) on the receptor to<br>
decrease the ability of the receptor to transduce an intracellular signal in response to<br>
endogenous ligand binding.<br>
[00133]	The phrase "treating or reducing the severity of an ABC Transporter<br>
mediated disease" refers both to treatments for diseases that are directly caused by ABC<br>
Transporter and/or CFTR activities and alleviation of symptoms of diseases not directly caused<br>
by ABC Transporter and/or CFTR anion channel activities. Examples of diseases whose<br>
symptoms may be affected by ABC Transporter and/or CFTR activity include, but are not<br>
limited to, Cystic fibrosis, Hereditary emphysema, Hereditary hemochromatosis, Coagulation-<br>
Fibrinolysis deficiencies, such as Protein C deficiency, Type 1 hereditary angioedema, Lipid<br>
processing deficiencies, such as Familial hypercholesterolemia, Type 1 chylomicronemia,<br>
Abetalipoproteinemia, Lysosomal storage diseases, such as I-cell disease/Pseudo-Hurler,<br>
Mucopolysaccharidoses, Sandhof/Tay-Sachs, Crigler-Najjar type II,<br>
Polyendocrinopathy/Hyperinsulemia, Diabetes mellitus, Laron dwarfism, Myleoperoxidase<br>
deficiency, Primary hypoparathyroidism, Melanoma, Glycanosis CDG type 1, Hereditary<br>
emphysema, Congenital hyperthyroidism, Osteogenesis imperfecta, Hereditary<br>
hypofibrinogenemia, ACT deficiency, Diabetes insipidus (DI), Neurophyseal DI, Neprogenic<br><br>
D1, Charcot-Marie Tooth syndrome, Perlizaeus-Merzbacher disease, neurodegenerative diseases<br>
such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Progressive<br>
supranudear plasy, Pick's disease, several polyglutamine neurological disorders asuch as<br>
Huntington, Spinocerebullar ataxia type I, Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, Dentatorubal<br>

aliphatic group in at least one instance. The term aliphatic chain includes alkyl chains, alkenyl<br>
chains, and alkynyl chains, where alkyl, alkenyl, and alkynyl are defined above.<br>
[00192]	The phrase "optionally substituted" is used interchangeably with the<br>
phrase "substituted or unsubstituted." As described herein, compounds of the invention can<br>
optionally be substituted with one or more substituents, such as are illustrated generally above,<br>
or as exemplified by particular classes, subclasses, and species of the invention. As described<br>
herein, the variables R1, R2, R3, and R4, and other variables contained therein formulae I<br>
encompass specific groups, such as alkyl and aryl. Unless otherwise noted, each of the specific<br>
groups for the variables R1, R2, R3, and R4, and other variables contained therein can be<br>
optionally substituted with one or more substituents described herein. Each substituent of a<br>
specific group is further optionally substituted with one to three of halo, cyano, oxoalkoxy,<br>

[00193]	In general, the term "substituted," whether preceded by the term<br>
"optionally" or not, refers to the replacement of hydrogen radicals in a given structure with the<br>
radical of a specified substituent. Specific substituents are described above in the definitions<br>
and below in the description of compounds and examples thereof. Unless otherwise indicated,<br>
an optionally substituted group can have a substituent at each substitutable position of the<br>
group, and when more than one position in any given structure can be substituted with more<br>
than one substituent selected from a specified group, the substituent can be either the same or<br>
different at every position. A ring substituent, such as a heterocycloalkyl, can be bound to<br>
another ring, such as a cycloalkyl, to form a spiro-bicyclic ring system, e.g., both rings share<br>
one common atom. As one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize, combinations of<br>
substituents envisioned by this invention are those combinations that result in the formation of<br>
stable or chemically feasible compounds.<br>
[00194]	The phrase "up to", as used herein, refers to zero or any integer number<br>
that is equal or less than the number following the phrase. For example, "up to 3" means any<br>
one of 0,1, 2, and 3.<br><br>
[00195]	The phrase "stable or chemically feasible," as used herein, refers to<br>
compounds that are not substantially altered when subjected to conditions to allow for their<br>
production, detection, and preferably their recovery, purification, and use for one or more of the<br>
purposes disclosed herein. In some embodiments, a stable compound or chemically feasible<br>
compound is one that is not substantially altered when kept at a temperature of 40° C or less, in<br>
the absence of moisture or other chemically reactive conditions, for at least a week.<br>
[00196]	As used herein, an effective amount is defined as the amount required to<br>
confer a therapeutic effect on the treated patient, and is typically determined based on age,<br>
suiface area, weight, and condition of the patient. The interrelationship of dosages for animals<br>
and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described by Freireich<br>
et al., Cancer Chemother. Rep., 50: 219 (1966). Body surface area may be approximately<br>
determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Ardsley, New York, 537 (1970). As used herein, "patient" refers to a<br>
mammal, including a human.<br>
[00197]	Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also meant to<br>
include all isomeric (e.g., enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or conformational))<br>
forms of the structure; for example, the R and S configurations for each asymmetric center, (Z)<br>
and (E) double bond isomers, and (Z) and (E) conformational isomers. Therefore, single<br>
stereochemical isomers as well as enantiomeric, diastereomeric, and geometric (or<br>
conformational) mixtures of the present compounds are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Unless otherwise stated, all tautomeric forms of the compounds of the invention are within the<br>
scope of the invention. Additionally, unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein are also<br>
meant to include compounds that differ only in the presence of one or more isotopically<br>
enriched atoms. For example, compounds having the present structures except for the<br>
replacement of hydrogen by deuterium or tritium, or the replacement of a carbon by a C- or<br>
uC-enriched carbon are within the scope of this invention. Such compounds are useful, for<br>
example, as analytical tools or probes in biological assays.<br>

d) in the presence of a catalyst such as, for example, palladium acetate or dichloro-[l,l-<br>
bis(diphervylphosphino) ferrocene] palladium(IT) (Pd(dppf)Cl2 ), provides compounds of the<br>
invention wherein R1 is aryl, heteroaryl, or cycloalkenyl. The boronic acid deR1vatives vi are<br>
commercially available or may be prepared by known methods such as reaction of an aryl<br>
bromide with a diborane ester in the presence of a coupling reagent such as, for example,<br><br>
palladium acetate as descnDea in me examples.<br>
[00314]	In another instance where one R1 is aryl and mother R1 is an aliphatic,<br>
alkoxy, cycloaliphatic, or heterocycloaliphatic, compounds of the invention can be prepared as<br>
descR1bed in steps a, b, and c of Scheme I using an appropR1ately substituted aminopyR1dine such<br>
as R2HN	5 where X is halo and Q is C1-6 aliphatic, aryl, heteroaryl, or 3 to 10 membered<br>
cycloaliphatic or heterocycloaliphatic as a substitute for the aminopyR1dine of formula iv.<br>

[00325]	The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending<br>
on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the seveR1ty of the infection, the<br>
particular agent, its mode of administration, and the like. The compounds of the invention are<br>
preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage.<br>
The expression "dosage unit form" as used herein refers to a physic illy discrete unit of agent<br>
appropR1ate for the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage<br>
of the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be; decided by the attending<br>
physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific effective dose level for any<br>
particular patient or organism will depend upon a vaR1ety of factors including the disorder being<br>
treated and the seveR1ty of the disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the<br><br>
specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient;<br>
the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific<br>
compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental<br>
with the specific compound employed, and like factors well known in the medical arts. The<br>
term "patient", as used herein, means an animal, preferably a mammal, and most preferably a<br>
human.<br>
[00326]	The pharmaceutically acceptable compositions of this invention can be<br>
administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally, parentera[lly, intracistemally,<br>
intravaginally, intrapeR1toneally, topically (as by powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an<br>
oral or nasal spray, or the like, depending on the seveR1ty of the infection being treated. In<br>
certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention may be administered orally or<br>
parenterally at dosage levels of about 6.01 mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg and preferably from about<br>
1 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day, to obtain<br>
the desired therapeutic effect.<br>
[00327]	Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited <br>
to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions, syrups and<br>
elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents<br>
commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solveats, solubilizing agents and<br>
emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl<br>
alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene giycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in<br>
particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and seszme oils), glycerol,<br>
.tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures<br>
thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting<br>
agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoR1ng, and perfuming agents.<br>
[00328]	Injectable preparations, for example, steR1le injectable aqueous or<br>
oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing<br>
or wetting agents and suspending agents. The steR1le injectable preparation may also be a steR1le<br>
injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenteral y acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, R1nger's solution, U.S.P. md isotonic sodium chloR1de<br>
solution. In addition, steR1le, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending<br>
medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglyceR1des. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br><br>
[00329]	The injectable formulations can be steR1lized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacteR1al-retaining filter, or by incorporating steR1lizing agents in the form of steR1le<br>
solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in steR1le water or other steR1le injectable<br>
medium pR1or to use.<br>
[00330]	In order to prolong the effect of a compound of the present invention, it is<br>
often desirable to slow the absorption of the compound from subcutaneous or intramuscular<br>
injection. This may be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or<br>
amorphous mateR1al with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the compound then<br>
depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline<br>
form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered compound form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the compound in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot<br>
forms are made by forming microencapsule matR1ces of the compound in biodegradable<br>
polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of compound to polymer<br>
and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of compound release can be<br>
controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly (orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydR1des). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the compound<br>
in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00331]	Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositoR1es which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable<br>
non-irR1tating excipients or carR1ers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository<br>
wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in<br>
the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[00332]	Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at least<br>
one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carR1er such as sodium citrate or dicalcium<br>
phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and<br>
silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, carboxymethylcellulos 3, alginates, gelatin,<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating<br>
agents such as agar-agar, calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain<br>
silicates, and sodium carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption<br>
accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite clay, and i)<br>
lubR1cants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid polyethylene glycols, sodium<br>
lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form<br><br>
may also compR1se buffeR1ng agents.<br>
[00333]	Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose: or milk sugar as well as<br>
high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,<br>
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteR1c<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They may<br>
optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the<br>
active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a<br>
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeR1c<br>
substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using, such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as<br>
high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[00334]	The active compounds can also be in microencapsulated form with one or<br>
more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteR1c coatings, release controlling<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical form .dating art. In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least or e inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, lactose or starch. Such dosage forms may also compR1se, as is normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubR1cants and other tableting aids<br>
such a magnesium stearate and macrocrystalline cellulose. In the cj.se of capsules, tablets and<br>
pills, the dosage forms may also compR1se buffeR1ng agents. They raay optionally contain<br>
opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s)<br>
only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeR1c substances and<br>
waxes.<br>
[00335]	Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound of<br>
this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays,<br>
inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under steR1le conditions with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carR1er and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be required.<br>
Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being within the<br>
scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use of transdermal<br>
patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the<br>
body. Such dosage forms are prepared by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper<br>
medium. Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across<br><br>
the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane or by<br>
dispersing the compound in a polymer matR1x or gel.<br>
[00336]	As descR1bed generally above, the compounds; of the invention are useful<br>
as modulators of ABC transporters. Thus, without wishing to be bound by any particular<br>
theory, the compounds and compositions are particularly useful for treating or lessening the<br>
seveR1ty of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or inactivity of ABC<br>
transporters is implicated in the disease, condition, or disorder. Wh ;n hyperactivity or<br>
inactivity of an ABC transporter is implicated in a particular disease, condition, or disorder, the<br>
disease, condition, or disorder may also be referred to as an "ABC transporter-mediated disease,<br>
condition or disorder".. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention provides a method<br>
for treating or lessening the seveR1ty of a disease, condition, or disorder where hyperactivity or<br>
inactivity of an ABC transporter is implicated in the disease state.<br>
[00337]	The activity of a compound utilized in this invention as a modulator of an<br>
ABC transporter may be assayed according to methods descR1bed ge nerally in the art and in the<br>
Examples herein.<br>
[00338]	It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable compositions of the present invention can be employed in combination therapies,<br>
that is, the compounds and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions can be administered<br>
concurrently with, pR1or to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or medical<br>
procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a<br>
combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or<br>
procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the<br>
therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example, an<br>
inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another agent used to treat the<br>
same disorder), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). As<br>
used herein, additional therapeutic agents that are normally administered to treat or prevent a<br>
particular disease, or condition, are known as "appropR1ate for the disease, or condition, being<br>
treated".<br>
[00339]	The amount of additional therapeutic agent present in the compositions of<br>
this invention will be no more than the amount that would normally be administered in a<br>
composition compR1sing that therapeutic agent as the only active agsnt. Preferably the amount<br>
of additional therapeutic agent in the presently disclosed compositions will range from about<br>
50% to 100% of the amount normally present in a composition compR1sing that agent as the<br><br>
only tnerapeuucaliy active agent.<br>
[00340]	The compounds of this invention or pharmacoutically acceptable<br>
compositions thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating an implantable<br>
medical device, such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an<br>
implantable device compR1sing a compound of the present invention as descR1bed generally<br>
above, and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carR1er suitable for coating said implantable<br>
device. In still another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with<br>
a composition compR1sing a compound of the present invention as descR1bed generally above,<br>
and in classes and subclasses herein, and a carR1er suitable for coatir. g said implantable device.<br>
Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices are descR1bed in US<br>
Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically biocompatible<br>
polymeR1c mateR1als such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane, polycaprolactone,<br>
polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures thereof. The coatings<br>
may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of fluorosilioone, polysaccaR1des,<br>
polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to impat controlled release<br>
characteR1stics in the composition.<br>
[00341]	Another aspect of the invention relates to modulating ABC transporter<br>
activity in a biological sample or a patient (e.g., in vitro or in vivo), which method compR1ses<br>
administeR1ng to the patient, or contacting said biological sample with a compound of formula I<br>
or a composition compR1sing said compound.. The term "biological sample", as used herein,<br>
includes, without limitation, cell cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied mateR1al obtained from a<br>
mammal or extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, uR1ne, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or<br>
extracts thereof.<br>
[00342]	Modulation of ABC transporter activity in a biological sample is useful<br>
for a vaR1ety of purposes that are known to one of skill in the art. Examples of such purposes<br>
include, but are not limited to, the study of ABC transporters in biolagical and pathological<br>
phenomena; and the comparative evaluation of new modulators of ABC transporters.<br>
[00343]	In yet another embodiment, a method of modulating activity of an anion<br>
channel in vitro or in vivo, is provided compR1sing the step of contacting said channel with a<br>
compound of formulae (I, II, III, IV, V-A, V-B, I', I'-A, and I'-B). In preferred embodiments,<br>
the anion channel is a chloR1de channel or a bicarbonate channel. In other preferred<br>
embodiments, the anion channel is a chloR1de channel.<br><br>
[00344]	According to an alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
method of increasing the number of functional ABC transporters in a membrane of a cell,<br>
compR1sing the step of contacting said cell with a compound of formula (I, II, III, IV, V-A, V-<br>
B, I', I'-A, and I'-B). The term "functional ABC transporter" as used herein means an ABC<br>
transporter that is capable of transport activity. In preferred embodiments, said functional ABC<br>
transporter is CFTR.<br>
[00345]	According to another preferred embodiment, the activity of the ABC<br>
transporter is measured by measuR1ng the transmembrane voltage potential. Means for<br>
measuR1ng the voltage potential across a membrane in the biological sample may employ any of<br>
the known methods in the art, such as optical membrane potential assay or other<br>
electrophysiological methods.<br>
[00346]	The optical membrane potential assay utilizes voltage-sensitive FRET<br>
sensors descR1bed by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) "Voltage<br>
sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single ce Us" Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80,<br>
and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) "Improved indicators of cell membrane potential<br>
that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with<br>
instrumentation for measuR1ng fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader<br>
(VDPR) (See, Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) "Cell-based assays and instrumentation for<br>
screening ion-channel targets" Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439).<br>
[00347]	These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence<br>
resonant energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye,<br>
DiSBAC2(3), and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet<br>
of the plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes n membrane potential (Vm) cause<br>
the negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistR1bute across the plasma membrane and the amount<br>
of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence<br>
emission can be monitored using VIPR™ II, which is an integrated liquid handler and<br>
fluorescent detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates.<br>
[00348]	In another aspect the present invention provides a kit for use in measuR1ng<br>
the activity of a ABC transporter or a fragment thereof in a biological sample in vitro or in vivo<br>
compR1sing (i) a composition compR1sing a compound of form ila (I, II, III, IV, V-A, V-B, I',<br>
I'-A, and I'-B) or any of the above embodiments; and (ii) instractions for a.) contacting the<br>
composition with the biological sample and b.) measuR1ng activity of said ABC transporter or a<br>
fragment thereof. In one embodiment, the kit further compR1ses instructions for a.) contacting<br><br>
an additional composition with the biological sample; fa.) measuR1ng the activity qf said ABC<br>
transporter or a fragment thereof in the presence of said additional cDmpound, and c.)<br>
compaR1ng the activity of the ABC transporter in the presence of the additional compound with<br>
the density of the ABC transporter in the presence of a composition of formula (I, II, III, IV, V-<br>
A, V-B, I', I'-A, and I'-B). In preferred embodiments, the kit is used to measure the density of<br><br>

Assays for Detecting and MeasuR1ng AF508-CFTR Correction Properties of Compounds<br>
JJ. Membrane potential optical methods for assaying AF508-CFTR modulation properties<br>
of compounds<br>
[00462]	The optical membrane potential assay utilized voltage-sensitive FRET<br>
sensors descR1bed by Gonzalez and Tsien (See, Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1995) "Voltage<br>
sensing by fluorescence resonance energy transfer in single cells" Biophys J 69(4): 1272-80,<br>
and Gonzalez, J. E. and R. Y. Tsien (1997) "Improved indicators of cell membrane potential<br>
that use fluorescence resonance energy transfer" Chem Biol 4(4): 269-77) in combination with<br>
instrumentation for measuR1ng fluorescence changes such as the Voltage/Ion Probe Reader<br>
(VIPR) (See. Gonzalez, J. E., K. Oades, et al. (1999) "Cell-based assays and instrumentation for<br>
screening ion-channel targets" Drug Discov Today 4(9): 431-439).<br>
[00463]	These voltage sensitive assays are based on the change in fluorescence<br>
resonant energy transfer (FRET) between the membrane-soluble, voltage-sensitive dye,<br>
DiSBAC2(3), and a fluorescent phospholipid, CC2-DMPE, which is attached to the outer leaflet<br>
of the plasma membrane and acts as a FRET donor. Changes in membrane potential (Vm) cause<br>
the negatively charged DiSBAC2(3) to redistR1bute across the plasma membrane and the amount<br>
of energy transfer from CC2-DMPE changes accordingly. The changes in fluorescence<br>
emission were monitored using VIPR™ II, which is an integrated liquid handler and fluorescent<br>
detector designed to conduct cell-based screens in 96- or 384-well microtiter plates.<br>
1.	Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[00464]	To identify small molecules that correct the trafficking defect associated<br>
with DF508-CFTR; a single-addition HTS assay format was developed. The cells were<br>
incubated in serum-free medium for 16 hrs at 37 °C in the presence or absence (negative<br>
control) of test compound. As a positive control, cells plated in 384-well plates were incubated<br>
for 16 hrs at 27 °C to "temperature-correct" AF5O8-CFTR. The cells were subsequently R1nsed<br>
3X with Krebs R1ngers solution and loaded with the voltage-sensitive dyes. To activate AF508-<br>
CFTR, 10 M forskolin and the CFTR potentiator, genistein (20 uM), were added along with<br>
Cl"-free medium to each well. The addition of Cl"-free medium promoted Cl efflux in response<br>
to AF508-CFTR activation and the resulting membrane depolaR1zation was optically monitored<br>
using the FRET-based voltage-sensor dyes.<br>
2.	Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br><br>
[00465] To identify potentiators of AF508-CFTR, a double-addition HTS assay<br>
format was developed. DuR1ng the first addition, a Cl'-free medium with or without test<br>
compound was added to each well. After 22 sec, a second addition of CF-free medium<br>
containing 2 -10 JJM forskolin was added to activate AF508-CFTR. The extracellular Cl"<br>
concentration following both additions was 28 mM, which promoted Cl" efflux in response to<br>
AF508-CFTR activation and the resulting membrane depolaR1zation was optically monitored<br>
 using the FRET-based voltage-sensor dyes.3	Solutio?isBath Solution #1: (in mM) NaCl<br><br>
 [00467]	NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF5O8-CFTR are used for<br>
optical measurements of membrane potential. The cells are maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and<br>
90 % humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamme,<br>
10 % fetal bovine serum, 1 X NEAA, |3-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2<br>
culture flasks. For all optical assays, the cells were seeded at 30,000/well in 384-well matR1gel-<br>
coated plates and cultured for 2 hrs at 37 °C before cultuR1ng at 27 °C for 24 hrs for the<br>
potentiator assay. For the correction assays, the cells are cultured at 27 °C or 37 °C with and<br>
without compounds for 16 - 24 hoursElectrophysiological Assays for assaying AF508-CFTR<br><br>
[00468]	Using chamber expeR1ments were performed on polaR1zed epithelial cells<br>
expressing AF508-CFTR to further characteR1ze the AF508-CFTR modulators identified in the<br>
optical assays. FRTAF508-CFrR epithelial cells grown on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts were<br>
mounted in an Ussing chamber (Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA), and the<br>
monolayers were continuously short-circuited using a Voltage-clamp System (Department of<br>
BioengineeR1ng, University of Iowa, IA, and, Physiologic Instruments, Inc., San Diego, CA).<br>
Transepithelial resistance was measured by applying a 2-mV pulse. Under these conditions, the<br><br>
FRT epithelia demonstrated resistances of 4 KQJ cm2 or more. The solutions were maintained<br>
at 27 °C and bubbled with air. The electrode offset potential and fluid resistance were corrected<br>
using a cell-free insert. Under these conditions, the current reflects the flow of Cl" through<br>
AF508-CFTR expressed in the apical membrane. The ISc was digitally acquired using an<br>
MP100A-CE interface and AcqKnowledge software (v3.2.6; BIOPAC Systems, Santa Barbara,<br>
CA).<br>
2. Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[00469]	Typical protocol utilized abasolateral to apical membrane Cl"<br>
concentration gradient. To set up this gradient, normal R1nger was used on the basolateral<br>
membrane, whereas apical NaCl was replaced by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH<br>
7.4 with NaOH) to give a large Cl" concentration gradient across the epithelium. All<br>
expeR1ments were performed with intact monolayers. To fully activate AF5O8-CFTR, forskolin<br>
(10 M) and the PDE inhibitor, IBMX (100 M), were applied followed by the addition of the<br>
CFTR potentiator, genistein (50 M).<br>
[00470]	As observed in other cell types, incubation at low temperatures of FRT<br>
cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR increases the functional density of CFTR in the plasma<br>
membrane. To determine the activity of correction compounds, the cells were incubated with<br>
10 M of the test compound for 24 hours at 37°C and were subsequently washed 3X pR1or to<br>
recording. The cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc in compound-treated cells was normalized to<br>
the 27°C and 37°C controls and expressed as percentage activity. Preincubation of the cells<br>
with the correction compound significantly increased the cAMP- and genistein-mediated Isc<br>
compared to the 37°C controls.<br>
5=	Identification of Potentiator Compounds.<br>
[00471]	Typical protocol utilized a basolateral to apical membrane Cl"<br>
concentration gradient. To set up this gradient, normal R1ngers was used on the basolateral<br>
membrane and was permeabilized with nystatin (360 g/ml), whereas apical NaCl was replaced<br>
by equimolar sodium gluconate (titrated to pH 7.4 with NaOH) to give a large Cl" concentration<br>
gradient across the epithelium. All expeR1ments were performed 30 min after nystatin<br>
permeabilization. Forskolin (10 M) and all test compounds were added to both sides of the<br>
cell culture inserts. The efficacy of the putative AF508-CFTR potentiators was compared to that<br>
of the known potentiator, genistein.<br>
4. Solutions<br><br><br><br>
[00472]	Fisher rat epithelial (FRT) cells expressing AF508-CFTR (FRT^508'01™)<br>
were used for Ussing chamber expeR1ments for the putative AF5O8-CFTR modulators identified<br>
from our optical assays. The cells were cultured on Costar Snapwell cell culture inserts and<br>
cultured for five days at 37 °C and 5% CO2in Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium<br>
supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 jug/ml streptomycin. PR1or<br>
to use for characteR1zing the potentiator activity of compounds, the cells were incubated at 27 °C<br>
for 16 - 48 hrs to correct for the AF5O8-CFTR. To determine the activity of corrections<br>
compounds, the cells were incubated at 27 °C or 37 °C with and without the compounds for 24<br>
hours.<br><br>
[00473]	The macroscopic AF508-CFTR current (IAFSOS) in temperature- and test<br>
compound-corrected NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR were monitored using the<br>
perforated-patch, whole-cell recording. BR1efly, voltage-clamp recordings of IAFSOS were<br>
performed at room temperature using an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier (Axon<br>
Instruments Tnc,5 Foster City, CA). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10<br>
kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz. Pipettes had a resistance of 5 - 6 MO when filled with the<br>
intracellular solution. Under these recording conditions, the calculated reversal potential for Cl"<br>
(Eci) at room temperature was -28 mV. All recordings had a seal resistance &gt; 20 GQ and a<br>
seR1es resistance 
using a PC equipped with a Digidata 1320 A/D interface in conjunction with Clampex 8 (Axon<br>
Instruments Inc.). The bath contained 
rate of 2 ml/min using a gravity-dR1ven perfusion system.<br>
7. Identification of Correction Compounds<br>
[00474]	To determine the activity of correction compounds for increasing the<br><br>
density of functional AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane, we used the above-descR1bed<br>
perforated-patch-recording techniques to measure the current density following 24-hr treatment<br>
with the correction compounds. To fully activate AF508-CFTR, 10 M forskolin and 20 M<br>
genistein were added to the cells. Under our recording conditions, the current density following<br>
24-hr incubation at 27°C was higher than that observed following 24-hr incubation at 37 °C.<br>
These results are consistent with the known effects of low-temperature incubation on the density<br>
of AF508-CFTR in the plasma membrane. To determine the effects of correction compounds on<br>
CFTR current density, the cells were incubated with 10 uM of the test compound for 24 hours at<br>
37°C and the current density was compared to the 27°C and 37°C controls (% activity). PR1or to<br>
recording, the cells were washed 3X with extracellular recording medium to remove any<br>
remaining test compound. Preineubation with 10 M of correction compounds significantly<br>
increased the cAMP- and genistein-dependent current compared to the 37°C controls.<br>
8. Identification of Potentiator Compounds<br>
[00475]	The ability of AF508-CFTR potentiators to increase the macroscopic<br>
AF508-CFTR Cl" current (IAFSOS) in NIH3T3 cells stably expressing AF508-CFTR was also<br>
investigated using perforated-patch-recording techniques. The potentiators identified from the<br>
optical assays evoked a dose-dependent increase in I^KSOS with similar potency and efficacy<br>
observed in the optical assays. In all cells examined, the reversal potential before and duR1ng<br>
potentiator application was around -30 mV, which is the calculated EQ (-28 mV).<br><br>
[00476]	NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF5O8-CFTR are used for<br>
whole-cell recordings. The cells are maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and 90 % humidity in<br><br>
Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutamine, 10 % fetal bovine<br>
serum, 1 X NEAA, -ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2 culture flasks. For<br>
whole-cell recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-coated glass coverslips<br><br>
and cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at 27 °C before use to test the activity of potentiators; and incubated<br>
with or without the correction compound at 37 °C for measuR1ng the activity of correctors.<br>
11. Single-chminel recordings<br>
[00477]	The single-channel actdivities of temperature-corrected AF508-CFTR<br>
stably expressed in NIH3T3 cells and activities of potentiator compounds were observed using<br>
excised inside-out membrane patch. BR1efly, voltage-clamp recordings of single-channel<br>
activity were performed at room temperature with an Axopatch 200B patch-clamp amplifier<br>
(Axon Instruments Inc.). All recordings were acquired at a sampling frequency of 10 kHz and<br>
low-pass filtered at 400 Hz. Patch pipettes were fabR1cated from Corning Kovar Sealing #7052<br>
glass (World Precision Instruments, Inc., Sarasota, FL) and had a resistance of 5 - 8 MQ, when<br>
filled with the extracellular solution. The AF5O8-CFTR was activated after excision, by adding<br>
1 mM Mg-ATP, and 75 nM of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, catalytic subunit (PKA;<br>
Promega Corp. Madison, WI). After channel activity stabilized, the patch was peR1fused using a<br>
gravity-dR1ven microperfusion system. The inflow was placed adjacent to the patch, resulting in<br>
complete solution exchange within 1-2 sec. To maintain AF508-CFTR activity duR1ng the<br>
rapid peR1fusion, the nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor F (10 mM NaF) was added to the bath<br>
solution. Under these recording conditions, channel activity remained constant throughout the<br>
duration of the patch recording (up to 60 min). Currents produced by positive charge moving<br>
from the intra- to extracellular solutions (anions moving in the opposite direction) are shown as<br>
positive currents. The pipette potential (Vp) was maintained at 80 mV.<br>
[00478]	Channel activity was analyzed from membrane patches containing 
active channels. The maximum number of simultaneous openings determined the number of<br>
active channels duR1ng the course of an expeR1ment. To determine the single-channel current<br>
amplitude, the data recorded from 120 sec of AF5O8-CFTR activity was filtered "off-line" at<br>
100 Hz and then used to construct all-point amplitude histograms that were fitted with<br>
multigaussian functions using Bio-Patch Analysis software (Bio-Logic Comp. France). The<br>
total microscopic current and open probability (Po) were determined from 120 sec of channel<br>
activity. The Po was determined using the Bio-Patch software or from the relationship Po =<br>
M(N), where I = mean current, i = single-channel current amplitude, and N = number of active<br>
channels in patch.<br><br><br><br>
[00479]	NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts stably expressing AF508-CFTR are used for<br>
excised-membrane patch-clamp recordings. The cells are maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and<br>
90 % humidity in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mM glutarnine,<br>
10 % fetal bovine serum, 1 X NEAA, (3-ME, 1 X pen/strep, and 25 mM HEPES in 175 cm2<br>
culture flasks. For single channel recordings, 2,500 - 5,000 cells were seeded on poly-L-lysine-<br>
coated glass coverslips and cultured for 24 - 48 hrs at .27 °C before use.<br>
