TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing a 1-substituted 5-hydroxymethylimidazole of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 wherein<br>
R represents alkyl, hydroxyalkyl, allyl, or substituted or unsubstituted arylmethyl or diarylmethyl, and preferably, C1-4alkyl, hydroxyC1-4alkyl, allyl, benzyl, substituted benzyl such as halogen-substituted benzyl or 3,4-dioxymethylenebenzyl, or 2-arylmethyl<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to a process for preparing compound of the above formula (1) from a 1-substituted 2-mercapto-5-hydroxymethylimidazole of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R is as defined above, which is prepared by reacting 1,3-dihydroxyacetone dimer of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with an acid addition salt of.amine of the formula: RNH2 (4)<br>
. wherein R is as defined above, and thiocyanate of the formula:<br>
M-SCN (5)<br>
, wherein M represents alkali metal, in the presence of a transition metal catalyst such as tungstic acid, etc. and an oxidizing agent.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The 1-substituted 5-hydroxymethylimidazole of the formula (1) and its intermediate, i.e. 1 -substituted 2~mercapto-5-hydroxymethylimidazole of the formula (2) are key intermediates known to be useful for preparing various anticancer agents under development, especially, farnesyl transferase inhibitors[J. S. Ko, et al., PCT W099/05 1 17 Al 19990204, p129].<br>
Various processes for the preparation of the compound of the formula (2) have alreads been known in the literature. For example, according to the process disclosed in EP1- J8B1, 1985, the 1-substituted 2-mercapto-5-hydroxymethylimidazole is obtained in the yield of 68.2% as a pale brown powder by reacting 1,3-dihydroxyacetone dimer of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
, as the starting material, with amine of the formula:<br>
RNH2(4)<br>
, wherein R represents alkyl, allyl, arylmethyl or diarylmethyl, and<br>
thiocyanate of the formula:<br>
M-SCN (5)<br>
, wherein M represents potassium,<br>
in the mixture of an organic acid and a lower alcohol solvent.<br>
However, under the above reaction conditions, there are some problems associated with the isolation of the product in good purity since an unidentified black tar is formed as a by-product and turned out to be difficult to purify.<br>
For preparing compound of the formula (1) from compound of the formula-(2), the known process, an oxidative desulfurization is conventionally performed by warming compound of the formula (2) in the presence of concentrated nitric acid, with or without the catalytic amount of nitritefR. G. Jones, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 1949, 71, 383] This method is useful in the laboratory scale preparation. However, this process has some problems associated with safety in the industrial scale. These are evolution of environmentally toxic nitrogen oxide gas and difficult control of the reaction. In addition, if the compound of the formula (2) has an aromatic functionality, electrophilic aromatic nitration reaction on the aromatic ring is accompanied as a side reaction.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors performed extensive studies to develop a novel process for the preparation of a 1-substituted 5-hydroxymethylimidazole and its intermediate, a 1-substituted 2-mercapto-5-hydroxymethylimidazole. As a result, they have identified that the problems of the previous process for preparing compound of the formula (2) could be removed by replacing amine by its acid addition salt. That is, if the acid addition salt of amine such as ammonium chloride is used, the formation of the colored by-products are eradicated completely Therefore, the desired compound, compound of the formula (2) , can be obtained in high purity and yield.<br>
In addition, since there are few practical examples of oxidative cleavage of thiol group, which allows to prepare compound of the formula (1) from compound of the formula (2), the present inventors made a research to develop a new process which could be viable in the industrial scale Finally, they have identified that the desired imidazole derivative can be obtained in high purity under safe and environmentally benign reaction conditions by employing a transition metal catalyst and an oxidizing agent such as hydrogen peroxide and thus, completed the present invention.<br>

As for the substituent "R", however, any conventional substituents other than those as mentioned above may be applied without any explicit indication.<br>
The term "alkyl" as used herein includes straight or branched chain alkyl.<br>
The preparation process according to the present invention comprises 2 steps The first step is that a 1-substituted 2-mercapto-5-hydroxymethylimidazole of the formula (2) is prepared by reacting 1,3-dihydroxyacetone dimer of the formula (3) with an acid addition salt of amine of the formula (4) and thiocyanate of the formula (5). The second step is that a 1-substituted 5-hydroxymethylimidazole of the formula (1) is prepared from the above compound of the formula (2) via oxidative desulfurization.<br>

More preferable is tungstic acid (H2WO4), vanadium pentoxide (V205) or vanadyl sulfate (VOS04). The molar ratio of the transition metal catalyst such as tungstic acid (H2W04), vanadium pentoxide (V,O5) or vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4) to the compound of the formula (2) is generally 0.001 -0.2:1, preferably 0.001 -0.02:1.<br>
As the useful oxidizing agent in the present invention, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydrogen peroxide(such as t-butyl hydrogen peroxide etc.) or alkaline hypochlorite (sodium or calcium salt) is preferable More preferable is 10-30% hydrogen peroxide. They are used in an amount of 3 to 10 molar equivalents with respect to compound of the formula (1).<br>
