				<td>ADJUSTABLE ANTI-SPLITTING DEVICE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an anti-splitting<br>
device for logs. •<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
End splits in logs are a serious problem because they downgrade the logs and seriously decrease their value.  A current method used to lessen the damage is to drive various types of anti-splitting devices into the end of a log in accordance with the teachings for instance of U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,208,255; 1,737,908; 1,925,238; 2,080,962; 2,223,596; 2,287,964; 3,082,658; 4,486,999; and 5,244,328; and German Patent 368,020.<br>
Prior to the ^328 patent, previous anti-splitting devices posed several problems, namely, they are difficult to install, and being conventionally formed of steel, they cause "rust spotting" of the wood of a log adjacent to their points of insertions and they must be removed prior to further processing of the log in order to avoid damage to saws, veneer knives, etc.<br>
The *328 patent redesigned anti-splitting devices to solve these other problems of previous anti-splitting devices. Applicant recognized the superiority of the *328 patent and therefore became the exclusive worldwide licensee of the ^328 patent. While using the anti-splitting device of the X328 patent, Applicant discovered some problems with it.<br>
The '328 patent relates to an anti-splitting device preferably molded from a recycled plastic material. The device has a central web portion and a pair of end web portions, which are joined adjacently to their midpoints to opposite ends of the central web portion to provide<br>
the device with generally    I-shaped cross-sectional configurations.     Each   weh&gt;   portion has   first   side  edges tapered to define a cut-ting   edge and second  side edges serving to define a planar   driven surface disposed parallel to the cutting   edge.     When the  second side edges  are formed,   it  is   preferable to provide integrally formed radiused filler    portions joined to the web portions adjacent their   junctures and to arrange projections to upstand    from  a  driven surface adjacent such junctures.    The projections are  adapted to removably attach the  device  to a driver employed to insert  the device into    a   log.<br>
The driver of the     A328   patent  is preferably in the form of a manually operational hammer having a planar driver surface of circular  planar form configuration  and a  plurality of pairs   of   recesses positioned near the outer perimeter of the    driver  surface.     The  recesses open through the driver   surface and serve to slidably, fractionally receive   each,   surface of the projections  and' to selectively orient    the   device relative to the driver surface and thus the   end   of  a  log into which the device is  to be driven upon   swinging of the  driver.<br>
A problem with the    *328  anti-splitting device  is that the projections   sometimes get  stuck in the pair of recesses  since the recesses  frictionally contact each surface of the projections.     When this  occurs,  the projections have to be   physically removed with another instrument/   like an awl,   before a second anti-splitting device can be inserted   into that pair of recesses.     This additional  step of removing the projections  is not<br>
desired.<br>
Another problem with the *328 anti-splitting device is that sometimes the device cannot be positioned into the desired position in the log without altering the<br>
position of the user,  or moving the log - which could be too heavy to move - because the recesses are not positioned correctly.<br>
' To overcome these problems, applicant has designed the instant invention .<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The anti-splittirxcj device of the present invention has a central web portion and a pair of end web portions, which are joined adjacently at their midpoints to opposite ends of tln.e central web portion to provide the device with generally I-shaped cross-sectional configurations. The vxzeb portions, have first side edges tapered to define a curtting edge and second side edges serving to define a pXanar driven surface disposed parallel to the cutting edge.  And on the central web portion are at least "two projections to upstand from a driven surface. The projections are adapted to removably attach the device to a driver employed to insert the device into a log.<br>
The driver of trxe present invention is preferably in the form of a mama ally operational hammer having a planar driver surface of circular plan form configuration and a circular groove that has an outer diameter equidistant and an inner diameter equidistant from a given fixed point, the center of the planar driving surface. The groove receives the projections and contacts a predetermined portion of the projections; the projections exert a force on either the outer diameter or the innear diameter, and do not contact both diameters at the same time.  The device can then be freely rotated in th.e groove to obtain a desired position on the driver surface.  Thus, the device can be driven into the end of a log upon swinging of the<br>
driver, and the projections will not remain in the groove, if they happen to break off.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Reference is first made to FIGS. 1 and 2, wherein an anti-splitting device of the present invention is generally designated as 10, and shown as inserted into an end of a log L for purposes of minimizing or preventing enlargement of splits S, and in association with a driver 12 adapted for use in manually driving the device into such logs .<br>
Device 10 is best shown in FIGS. 2-7 as generally including a central wet&gt; portion 14 and a pair of end web portions 16 and 18.  Tine end portions 16, 18 are joined<br>
at  their respective mid-points  to  opposite ends of the central web portion 14.       And  on the  central web portion 14   are  at  least two and   preferably  a pair of projections 20  and 22,   which serve   to   orient and removably attach, the  device 10 to driver   12   in the manner to be<br>
described.<br>
Web portions 14, 16 and 18 are considered to have first and second or opposite side edges 14a and 14b, 16a and I6b, and 18a and 18b.  The first side edges 14a, 16a and 18a are tapered, best shown in FIGS. 4 and 5, to define a cutting edge 24.  And the second side edges 14b, 16b and 18b are essentially coplanar and cooperate to define a driven surface 26, best shown in FIGS. 3 and 4, disposed essentially parallel to cutting edge 24.<br>
In a presently preferred and commercially available form of device 10, web portions 16 and 18 are semicircular and the facing surfaces of such end web portions 16 and 18 are generally concave.  Moreover, projections 20 and 22 are integrally mold formed from plastic material, as opposed to being formed of metal. By using plastic, the device 10 avoids discoloration or "rust spotting" of those portions of the wood of a log adjacent the area into which the device 10 is driven by driver 12, and permits subsequent cutting operations to be performed on the log without need for prior removal of the device 10 therefrom.  When so formed, it is preferable to provide integrally formed radiused filler portions 30 and 32 joined to web portions 14, 16 and 18 adjacent their junctures.  Filler portions 30 and 32 • have proven effective in minimizing structural failure of device 10 adjacent the junctures of web portion 14 with web portions 16 and 18 incident to the driving of device 10 into a log.<br>
On the  central wefc&gt;    portion 14,   at  a predetermined distance,   are projections   20  and 22 to upstand from driven  surface 26,   as     best   shown in FIG.   4.     Projections 20  and  22 may be variously  configured,   but  they are preferably shaped to   cJefine  generally cylindrical base portions  20a and 22a   srid   rounded or generally conical free  end or guide portions   20b and 22b.<br>
Driver 12 is  shown   in  FIG.   2 as being in the form of a  hammer 12 having    a.   weighted head 34  and a manually manipulated handle 36 ,    wherein head 34  is provided with a  planar driver surface    38.     On the planar driver surface  is  a circular     groove 40.     The circular groove 40 has  an outer diameter     41   equidistant and an inner diameter 42 equidistant   from a given fixed point,  the center  43 of the planar   driving surface 38.     The groove 40  receives the projections  20,   22 and contacts a predetermined portion,    of   the projections  20,   22.     In order  for the device    1O   to  remain attached to the hammer 12,   the projections  2O,    22  exert a force  on either  the outer diameter 41 or   the   inner diameter 42,   and do not contact both diameters   41,   42  at the same time.     Thus, if the projections 2O ,    22 become detached from the device 10,   the projections 20,   22 do not remain in the groove  40;   instead detached projections  20,   22 merely fall to the ground in    the present invention.<br>
The distance of    trie projections  20,   22  on the central web portion  3- -4   correspond to the diameter of the inner diameter 42 or    the  outer diameter 41.     It has been determined that placi_ng  the groove 40 near the perimeter of the planar driver     surface  38,   as disclosed in the '328 patent,   is not p»3referred.     Instead,   the groove  40 should be firmly in tine   interior 88 portion,   as shown in Figure  2,   of the plan.air   driver surface 38.     Otherwise,<br>
the  device  10 will be     more  difficult to rotate and<br>
properly align.<br>
Moreover,   when the   projections  are within the groove  40,   the device     1O   can be orientated in the desired position without   removing or lifting  the device 10   from the driver surface  38.    Also it allows the user to  obtain the desired    position of the device  10 every • time without having to   adjust the user's position as<br>
well.<br>
As with prior loo;   anti-splitting devices,  devices 10 would normally be    applied to logs resting on the ground in the field oar   in a  log collection area prior   to transport of the logs     to  a point at which they are intended to be cut into   lumber or veneer.     For the case of  devices of the   '32 8   patent,   it was necessary for  a Worker to manually position a device on the  planar driver surface into t-tie   correct recesses/   and since splits  are randomly a. arranged,   it was normally necessary for the worker to change his position relative to the log after each insert :Lon operation.<br>
In accordance wd-th the present  invention,   device   10 may be inserted into     log L without the requirement of   a worker to adjust his     [position relative to the log. Specifically,   it is  contemplated that each insert 10, after being temporarily attached to the driver surface 38  by means  of projecations  20 and 22  and then rotated while still attached     -to the driver surface 38 to obtain the desired position     of the device 10 into the log,  may be  driven into log L     toy a single backhand or underhand swing of driver 12.         Care  should be exercised by a worker to ensure that   the driver surface is arranged essentially at right      angles to the direction of the grain of the log,   duotring the terminal portion of the swing of the driver,       to thereby ensure that the device<br>
is driven fully into the log in a direction parallel to its grain.  Rebound or • bounce back of the driver serves to disengage the inserted device therefrom.  Like swings are employed to drive additional devices 10 into log L with their orientation relative thereto and to each other being determined t&gt;y the pre-positioning of projections 20 and 22 of such devices 10 within the circular groove 40 and rotating the devices 10 while in the groove 40 to obtain the desired position.<br>
As by way of examjple of a present commercial form of the invention, device 10 shown in FIGS. 1-1, has a central and end web po art ions having lengths of about 3 3/4, 2 and 1 inches, respectively, thicknesses of about 3/64 inch, and widths,  as measured between their side edges, of about % incti .  When anti-splitting devices of the present invention are intended for use with a flitch or cant, as opposed to a log, the lengths of the web portions of such devices would be reduced by about one half with their web portion thicknesses and widths remaining essentially the same.  Enlargements 46 located in the area cutting edge 24 occur as a result of the device mold forming operation, and do not appear to adversely affect driving of the device into a log.<br>
While the anti-splitting device of the present invention may be cast from metal, it is preferably integrally mold formed from recycled plastic material, like polycarbonate.<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 iH-lustrate alternative anti-splitting devices 10 wherein tlieir end web portions 16 and 18 are right angled to form a letter *I" and V-shaped, respectively.  Collectively, all device 10 embodiments described in this application are referred to as wl-shaped plan view configurations."  These embodiments<br>
are excellent alternatives  to  those  shown in Figures   3-5 and obtain similar or   superior results.<br>
The anti-splitting   device  of the present invention has been disclosed for    use with a manually operated hammer having a groove -        However,   it is  contemplated that the device would   have utility with a portable electrically or pneumatically powered driver,  where   a suitable source of power   is   available,   and for this latter  case the driver    would only require one pair  of device positioning recesses,   if the driver could be conveniently positioned   to vary the orientation of  the devices,   as presented   "to   an  end of a log.<br>
It is  intended tin.at   the  above description of  the preferred embodiments    of  the  structure of the present invention and the description of  its  operation are but one  or more enabling best mode embodiments  for implementing the invention.     Other modifications  and variations  are likely    to  be  conceived of by those skilled in the art upon   a reading of the preferred embodiments and a consideration of the  appended claims and  drawings.     These rrxodifications  and variations   still fall within the bread-tin   and  scope of the disclosure  of the present invention -<br><br><br>
