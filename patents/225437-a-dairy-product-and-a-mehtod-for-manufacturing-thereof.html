				<td>A DAIRY PRODUCT AND A METHOD FOR MANUFACTURING THEREOF<br>
Introduction<br>
The invention relates to a dairy product.<br>
Manufacture of cheese from milk is traditionally accomplished by coagulating milk<br>
using rennet enzyme. The coagulum has the tendency to contract into a curd as it<br>
expresses whey. The removal of whey from the curd is then effected. The curd may<br>
be further processed in different ways to become the final cheese. Casein<br>
macropeptide (CMP) is cleaved from the casein protein as a result of the action of<br>
the rennet on kappa casein and about 90% of this CMP is typically removed with<br>
the whey. Thus traditional cheese is an excellent source of nutrition, rich in<br>
minerals and protein while being low in whey proteins but also low in CMP.<br>
CMP is known to be therapeutically beneficial. A number of researchers have<br>
reported that CMP has significant bioactivity in regulating the digestive system<br>
(Stan et al. (1983) Fiziol Zh SSSR 69, 855-859). Research (Otani et al<br>
Milchwissenschaft 47 (8) 1992) has also shown that CMP was able to inhibit<br>
mitogenesis and that this could modulate the immune system to help prevent atopic<br>
reactions to food antigens. CMP was also found to have Bifidogenic (prdbiotic)<br>
properties (Azuma et al (1984) Agric. Biol. Chem., 48 (8), 2159-2164). Additionally<br>
CMP has been found to be effective against the cholera toxin (Kawasaki et al.,<br>
(1992)Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 56, 195-198) and has demonstrated inhibition of<br>
all strains of influenza virus (Kawasaki et al. (1993) Biosci. Biotech. Biochem., 57,<br>
1214-1215). The characteristics and potential uses of CMP are reviewed by Abd E1-<br>
Salam et al. (1996) in the Int. Dairy Journal 6, 327-341.<br>
CMP is a heterogeneous group of proteins. CMP contains all the genetic variations<br>
and post-translational modifications of kappa casein (Yvon et al Reprod Nutr Dev<br>
(1994) 34, 527-537). As a result of this CMP may have two amino acid sequence<br>
(variants type A and B), differing degrees of phosphorylation and most significantly<br>
a range in the level, position and type of carbohydrate moieties. The predominant<br>
carbohydrate is sialic acid. Kappa casein is a rich source of the amino acid<br>
threonine with 14 to 15 threonine residues depending on the genetic variant.<br>
However about 80% of the total threonine in kappa casein resides in the CMP<br>
portion. CMP has a molecular weight of about 7,000KDa and as such may be<br>
considered to be more like a small protein. Due to the degree of glycosylation,<br>
CMP occupies a much larger hydrodynamic volume than its molecular weight<br>
would indicate and therefore is retained by ultrafiltration membranes. Casein<br>
macropeptide is variously referred to as casein macropeptide, caseinomacropeptide,<br>
casein-derived peptide, casein glycopeptide and sometimes, erroneously as<br>
glycomacropeptide. CMP has varying levels of carbohydrate moieties. A small<br>
fraction of CMP however, may have very low or no carbohydrate moiety and<br>
therefore is not technically a glycomacropeptide. Glycomacropeptide or GMP<br>
however is the principal (50 to 75%) component of CMP. The carbohydrate content<br>
of the GMP renders it soluble in a 12% trichloroacetic acid solution. A number of<br>
the analytical measurement techniques have a pre-treatment, which involves a TCA<br>
solution, this may remove at least a portion of the non-glycosylated CMP. For<br>
example the method published in The Official Journal of the European<br>
Communities (L228/10 Annex IV). This details a HPLC method for measuring<br>
GMP in dairy products and uses the GMP level to calculate the level of cheese<br>
whey present in a sample. For any specified GMP content it can be assumed that<br>
the corresponding CMP level is 1.33 to 2 times greater. The heterogeneity of CMP<br>
makes it difficult to measure. However there are a number of suitable<br>
methodologies for example that of Leonil et al (Journal of Dairy Research (1991),<br>
58, 321-328) which relies on ion exchange chromatography and eliminates the need<br>
for a TCA treatment and therefore measures the CMP rather than just the GMP.<br>
Indirect techniques to determine the level of CMP in a cheese would include<br>
measuring the level of sialic acid or Threonine levels.<br>
In comparison to CMP whey proteins, particularly beta lactoglobulin (BLg) and<br>
alpha lactalbumin (ALA) are known milk allergens (Internet Symposium on Food<br>
Allergens 2(l):9-74 (2000) http:/www.food-allergens.de). The presence of whey<br>
proteins in cheese also have an adverse effect on functionality, particularly in<br>
mozzarella cheese.<br>
Faquant et al. Technique Laitiere &amp; Marketing 1988 No. 1028, 21-23 describes the<br>
separation of whey proteins from casein proteins utilising microfiltration.<br>
EP-A-0 542 583 describes a process using microfiltration to remove soluble whey or<br>
serum proteins and subsequently subjecting the deserumproteinised material to a<br>
heat treatment to make a dairy material which is said to be suitable for<br>
transformation into cheese. The process involves the removal of about 80% of the<br>
cheese milk volume in a whey separation step so that 80% of the CMP is also<br>
removed. This results in at most a doubling of the CMP present in the finished<br>
cheese compared to traditional cheese, however a processor would still incur the<br>
cost of processing /disposing the retained whey.<br>
PCT/NZ95/00086 describes a process for making a whey protein depleted milk<br>
protein concentrate (wpdMPC) and the use of the wpdMPC product in the<br>
manufacture of dairy products.<br>
US-A-5 378 478 describes ultrafiltration and evaporation of skim milk to make a<br>
milk protein concentrate for cheese manufacture. The CMP component and all of<br>
the whey proteins are retained.<br>
EP-A-0 435 573 describes a process for making a skim cheese utilising a Dorr-<br>
Oliver ultrafiltration retentate. The resultant product retains all of the CMP and all<br>
of the whey proteins normally present in milk.<br>
Another approach has been to remove or isolate the whey proteins or CMP from a<br>
raw milk product. The whey proteins or CMP are then re-introduced to a final<br>
product. Such processes, however, involve additional processing steps and<br>
significant levels of whey protein are still present.<br>
WO-A-00 49885 describes the use of a milk protein hydrolysate for addressing bone<br>
or dental disorders. Casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP) is extracted from sweet<br>
whey by a combination of electrodialysis, cation exchange resin, anion exchange<br>
resin, evaporation, spray drying, ultrafiltration and freeze drying. The CGMP is<br>
used to enrich foods or liquid enteral compositions with CMP. The fermented and<br>
gelled milk products are enriched in CMP but the level of whey protein also<br>
remains high.<br>
WO-A-94/15952 describes a method of producing kappa casein glycomacropeptide<br>
or CMP. CMP is removed from casein via rennet whey as a first step. The lactose<br>
and some of the minerals are then removed from the whey by ultrafiltration to<br>
produce a whey protein concentrate (WPC). The major whey proteins are then<br>
removed from the WPC by a process of thermal denaturation and precipitation of<br>
the protein to leave the CMP and some non-protein nitrogen in solution. This<br>
supernatant is then further concentrated by hyperfiltration and spray drying, before<br>
being incorporated into a protein free food product.<br>
US-A-4,919,943 describes a process to remove whey proteins however the whey<br>
protein is then re-introduced to the final product. While this provides a solution to<br>
the functionality problem associated with whey proteins the whey proteins are still<br>
present in the final product and pose a potential allergy problem. Processing costs<br>
are also increased.<br>
There is therefore a need for a dairy product containing dairy proteins that is rich in<br>
CMP with reduced allergenicity and enhanced functionality. There is also a need<br>
for a process for producing such a product on an economic factory scale.<br>
Statements of Invention<br>
The present invention proposes a dairy product containing dairy<br>
proteins, the product being at least semi-solid and containing greater than 0.15% by<br>
weight of casein macxopeptide (CMP) and a mass ratio of CMP to whey protein<br>
being greater than 1:4.9. For clarity, in this specification for example a ratio of 1:2<br>
is greater than a ratio of 1:4, therefore a greater ratio requires lower whey protein<br>
levels.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a dairy product containing<br>
dairy proteins, the product being at least semi-solid and containing from 0.15%<br>
to 1% by weight of casein macropeptide (CMP) and a mass ratio of CMP to<br>
whey protein of from 1:2 to 1:4.<br>
In this specification, "at least semi-solid" refers in particular to any cheese which<br>
offers greater than 450g of peak force of resistance to deformation as measured as<br>
follows.<br>
Firsdy the cheese is cut into 16mm cubes covered with cling film, and tempered in a<br>
5°C incubator for 2 hours. Using the Stable Micro Systems TA.XT2i texture<br>
analyser, on TPA mode with the following settings: -<br>
Test Set-up: The sample is positioned centrally under the cylinder and the test<br>
commenced. The peak force is then determined by selecting the highest force<br>
reading recorded during the entire test.<br>
For many food applications it is advantageous to have a solid or semi-solid food<br>
such as in sandwich and pizza applications. It is very difficult to slice or shred<br>
cheese with a peak force resistance of less than 450g. Generally however, the cheese<br>
needs to be firmer than this for slicing and shredding. The cheese of the present<br>
invention may be made to a wide range of final textures.<br>
The invention also provides an at least semi-solid dairy product containing greater<br>
than 0.15% by weight of casein macro-peptide (CMP), the product having a high<br>
CMP to whey protein ratio and the product has a total solids content as measured<br>
by the method based on I.D.F. 4:1985 of at least 50% by weight.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides an at least semi-solid dairy product<br>
containing greater than 0.15% by weight of casein macropeptide (CMP), and the<br>
product has a total solids content as measured by the method based on I.D.F. 4:<br>
1985 of at least 42% by weight.<br>
In another aspect the invention provides an at least semi-solid dairy product<br>
containing greater than 0.15% by weight of casein macropeptide (CMP) and the<br>
product, on manufacture, has a sodium chloride content of at least 1.0%, preferably<br>
1.5% as determined by B.S. 770 1963. In the context of this specification, the term<br>
"on manufacture" means that the salt can be incorporated into the liquid mix, in<br>
effect directly into the cheese milk, since no whey need be removed and<br>
consequently the salt remains with the product. Thus the salt is present in the<br>
correct proportions at the point the liquid mix becomes a cheese, that is at the point<br>
of rennet coagulation. Thus the necessity for subsequent processing of the cheese<br>
such as milling the cheese and then salting it or immersing the cheese in a brine<br>
solution or rubbing dry salt to the surface of the cheese is eliminated.<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides an at least semi-solid dairy product<br>
containing greater than 0.15% by weight of casein macropeptide (CMP), and<br>
contains a biologically functional additive. Preferably the biologically functional<br>
additive is present in an amount of at least sufficient to produce a desired biological<br>
effect in the consumer. The precise amount required varies considerably depending<br>
on the nature of the additive and the quantity of cheese consumed. While not<br>
wishing to be proscriptive the amount that the product of the current invention can<br>
carry can be as high as 25% by weight of the finished product and greater,<br>
depending on the nature of the additive.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the product contains a CMP to whey<br>
protein mass ratio of greater than 1:4.5, preferably greater than 1:4.0, most<br>
preferably greater than 1:3.5, ideally greater than 1:3. As the level of whey protein is<br>
reduced the allergenicity of the finished product is reduced for those individuals<br>
that have an allergic reaction to the ALA and BLg whey proteins. Furthermore the<br>
functional properties of the cheese such as texture, flavour, melt and stretch are<br>
improved with lower levels of whey protein. As the Ala and BLg proteins are<br>
allergens and the CMP helps to reduce allergenic response it is particularly<br>
beneficial to have a high ratio of CMP to whey protein.<br>
In one embodiment the product contains greater than 0.25%, preferably greater<br>
than 0.35% by weight of CMP, preferably greater than 0.45% by weight of CMP,<br>
more preferably greater than 0.55%, most preferably greater than 0.75% by weight<br>
of CMP.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the CMP levels are in excess of 0.85% by<br>
weight, most preferably 0.95% by weight, of the cheese.<br>
The advantage of increasing levels of CMP are accomplished by removing less and<br>
less whey, until ultimately no whey is removed at all. Because there are lower levels<br>
of whey to process processing costs are reduced and ultimately eliminated. The<br>
resultant cheese will be more beneficial to the consumer with increasing levels of<br>
CMP in view of the bioactive properties of CMP whilst being substantially free of<br>
whey protein.<br>
Other benefits of an essentially whey-less cheese make are that salt added during<br>
the process is not lost in the whey so the need for mill salting, brine salting or dry<br>
salting is eliminated. Furthermore, water soluble nutrients and ingredients with<br>
physical and biological functionality such as certain vitamins, prebioties like<br>
fructoohgosaccharides can be incorporated into the cheese without contaminating<br>
or being lost to the whey.<br>
The process also allows for the incorporation of insoluble ingredients like fibre,<br>
lipids and oil soluble ingredients with health promoting properties or for other<br>
technical or commercial benefits. In traditional cheese manufacture the whey<br>
separation process results in some of these ingredients being lost to the whey.<br>
The product of the invention contains less than 2.5% by weight of whey protein,<br>
preferably less than 1.75%, most preferably less than 1.4%, ideally less than 1.25%.<br>
The product may be a process cheese product or a natural cheese product. The<br>
process cheese product includes emulsifying salts while the natural cheese product<br>
is free of such salts.<br>
A further aspect the invention provides a method to manufacture an at least semi-<br>
solid product which comprises:<br>
(i) combining with the aid of mixing and heating as necessary:-<br>
a) an amount of natural casein isolate (NCI) protein source such that 7% to 85% of<br>
the product by weight is NCI protein;<br>
b) an amount of a moisture source such that 10% to 85% of the product by weight is<br>
moisture;<br>
c) an amount of a fat source such that 0.1% to 60% of the product by weight is fat;<br>
d) a food grade acid, either added externally or generated internally through the<br>
action of microbial fermentation to reduce the pH to about 6.5 to 5.0<br>
(ii) subjecting the mixture thus formed to the action of a coagulant such as rennet<br>
enzyme in sufficient concentration and with sufficient time and temperature to<br>
convert the product to a semi-solid product at room temperature or below.<br>
This provides a semi-solid product with the benefits of high levels of CMP and low<br>
levels suitable for consumption.<br>
In this specification, the term NCI or natural caseinate refers to the product<br>
produced by removing the serum proteins from whole casein. Whole casein refers<br>
to casein, which has not been enzymatically hydrolysed to paracasein. However<br>
any whole casein can be used to produce the product of the invention. This<br>
specification describes in detail the ideal source of whole casein, NCI. However<br>
this description should not be seen as restrictive. Other suitable sources of whole<br>
casein would include caseinate, for example calcium caseinate or calcium sodium<br>
caseinate. A person skilled in the art will immediately recognise how these<br>
products, combined with various salts can be manipulated to generate a variety of<br>
finished product textures and physical functionality.<br>
The process used to produce the at least semi-solid dairy product uses a rennet<br>
enzyme to liberate the CMP from the casein and in this way the fluid material is<br>
converted into a more amenable solid or semi solid.<br>
Preferably the amount of NCI is such that from 7% to 60% of the product by weight<br>
is NCI protein. Most preferably the amount of NCI is such that from 15% to 30%<br>
of the product by weight is NCI protein. While the product may be consumed in a<br>
dry or semi-dry state as it would be with a NCI protein content of 85%, a more<br>
useful product is obtained at lower levels of protein. The higher levels of protein<br>
result in a harder product that may be difficult to consume. When proteins are<br>
present in the lower range, particularly in the 20% to 25% protein range, semi-solid<br>
products are produced that can be easily formed into shapes, sliced, diced and<br>
shredded and are easily consumed.<br>
In one embodiment the amount of moisture is such that from 20% to 76% of the<br>
product by weight is moisture. Ideally the amount of moisture is such that from<br>
30% to 60% of the product by weight is moisture. Most preferably the amount of<br>
moisture is such that from 40% to 55% of the product by weight is moisture.<br>
The lower moisture range provides a product that has improved microbial stability<br>
but less desirable sensory properties. At the higher moisture range the product has<br>
poorer microbial stability and may be a little too soft to be of wide utility. As the<br>
moisture tends towards the intermediate range a very useful product results with<br>
good microbial stability, improved sensory characteristics and yet still retaining the<br>
benefits of low whey protein and high CMP.<br>
In a further embodiment the amount of fat is such that from 0.1% to 50% of the<br>
product by weight is fat. Ideally the amount of fat is such that from 5% to 40% of<br>
the product by weight is fat. Most preferably the amount of fat is such that from<br>
10% to 35% of the product by weight is fat.<br>
At the lower fat levels the resultant product may have poor sensory characteristics,<br>
while at the higher end of the range the resultant products become nutritionally<br>
inferior as fat displaces the more nutritionally useful minerals and proteins.<br>
Preferably the renneting temperatures are in the range of 30 to 65°C. Most<br>
preferably the renneting temperatures is approximately 50°C. This higher<br>
temperature allows the use of higher solids in the mixing stage.<br>
In one aspect the mixture is converted to a semi-solid product by:-<br>
pasteurising the mixture;<br>
cooling the pasteurised mixture; and<br>
inoculating or acidifying the mixture before or after subjecting the mixture to<br>
the action of a rennet enzyme.<br>
in another aspect the mixture is converted to a semi-solid product by:-<br>
subjecting the mixture to the action of a rennet enzyme before or after<br>
acidification; and<br>
pasteurising, packaging and cooling the product thus formed.<br>
Acidification may be carried out by direct acidification with a food grade acid such<br>
as lactic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid for example or by inoculating with an<br>
acid producing culture and allowing it to ferment for a period of time .<br>
The advantage of acidifying the product is to improve the flavour, microbial<br>
stability of the product and to increase the clotting activity of the enzyme. At the<br>
higher end of the pH range the clotting activity is reduced and processing times are<br>
increased. In addition the shelf stability is low and the flavour may not be acidic<br>
enough. At the lower end of the pH range the shelf stability is good but the stability<br>
of the protein to thermal processing is low (if thermal processing is required). Also<br>
the flavour may be a little too acidic.<br>
It will be immediately obvious to one skilled in the art that the NCI may be at least<br>
partly acidified thus eliminating or reducing the need for acidification during the<br>
conversion process described above. This acidification also assists in<br>
demineralisation of the NCI to provide for a variety of textures and melt behaviours<br>
in the finished cheese.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The invention will be more clearly understood from the following description<br>
thereof given by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
in which:-<br>
Fig. 1 is an overview of natural casein isolate (NCI) production including<br>
ancillary products; and<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic block diagram of one of the embodiments of the<br>
conversion of NCI into a natural cheese or a process cheese.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The invention provides a method of manufacture of an at least semi-solid dairy<br>
product, which has a number of unique and useful advantages over existing<br>
technologies. . The invention provides a commercially viable semi-solid dairy<br>
product wherein the CMP to total whey protein is dramatically altered. The CMP<br>
is generated in situ within the food and is retained within it naturally with minimal<br>
processing. Furthermore the invention provides a cheese making procedure that<br>
does not generate whey.<br>
Whey proteins are a heterogeneous group of proteins and may be measured by a<br>
variety of techniques. They are variously referred to as serum protein, albumins and<br>
soluble proteins. The typical distribution of major proteins in cheese whey is beta-<br>
lactoglobulin at 45%, alpha-lactalbumin at 18%, serum albumin, immunoglobulins<br>
and lipoproteins at 5% each, about 2% enzymes and importantly, 15% to 20% CMP<br>
(Marshall S. C. Food Res. Quar. 1991, 51, p81).<br>
In this specification whey proteins include the typical proteins of cheese whey.<br>
However this specification teaches that the CMP to whey protein ratio can be<br>
altered. For the purposes of this specification the term whey protein does not extend<br>
to that portion of the CMP that is in excess of that which is normally present. Some<br>
of the more basic techniques for estimating whey protein concentration rely on the<br>
solubility of this group of proteins and therefore consider nitrogen solubility under<br>
defined conditions to be a measure of whey protein concentration. In cheese<br>
however, on maturation, the casein proteins may be hydrolysed to release soluble<br>
peptides, commonly with a molecular weight below 1000. This increases the soluble<br>
nitrogen content, but not the whey proteins as we have defined them and therefore<br>
it is not a suitable measure. While there is some debate over the rate of denatured<br>
whey proteins during cheese maturation, it is agreed that the undenatured whey<br>
proteins alpha lactalbumin and beta lactoglobulin are resistant to hydrolysis during<br>
cheese maturation. It is possible therefore to measure these by HPLC. It is<br>
common to measure a major protein like beta lactoglobulin and calculate the total<br>
whey protein level by comparison with a control, alternatively one might do so by<br>
assuming that beta lactoglobulin comprises 45% of the total whey protein.<br>
Alternatively, though not usually one might measure the alpha lactalbumin content<br>
and calculate the total whey protein by dividing by 0.18. For the purposes of clarity,<br>
it would not be appropriate to determine whey protein content by dividing the<br>
CMP level by 0.2 since this specification teaches how the normal ratio in whey is<br>
altered by the use of the technology herein described. However levels of beta<br>
lactoglobulin and alpha lactalbumin may vary slightly with seasonality. A more<br>
accurate measure would be to measure the content of beta lactoglobulin (BLg),<br>
alpha lactalbumin (Ala) and CMP are determined by chromatography. The minor<br>
proteins and enzymes may be calculated as follows:-<br>
Minor Proteins = BLg x 17/45<br>
The total whey protein content is then calculated as:-<br>
Total whey protein = BLg + Ala + CMP + Minor Proteins<br>
An alternative method is to measure the sulphur amino acid content such as<br>
methionine and cystine. Whey proteins are a rich source of these amino acids<br>
relative to casein and the ratio of sulphur amino acids to total protein might also be <br>
used to determine whey protein levels indirectly. ,<br>
The amount of CMP generated during rennet hydrolysis of casein may vary<br>
depending on the conditions used. Kappa casein represents 10% to 15% of the total<br>
casein protein. CMP represents 36.84% of the kappa casein. Thus 3.68% to 5.5%<br>
CMP (by weight of total casein) can be generated from casein. During cheese<br>
manufacture at least 85% of the CMP must be liberated if the milk is to clot<br>
(Dagleish D. G. J. Dy. Res. 1979, 46, 653). Thus the lower concentration of 3.13%<br>
is possible during cheese manufacture. These figures are consistent with the<br>
estimate that CMP comprises 15% to 20% of whey proteins (Marshall S.C. Fd. Res.<br>
Quart. 1991, 51, 81-91) or a ratio of CMP to whey protein of 1:6.66 to 1:5. As CMP<br>
is very soluble it tends to partition similarly to whey proteins which are also very<br>
soluble. Consequently cheese would be expected to have a ratio of CMP to whey<br>
protein similar to that present in the whey but at a significantly lower overall<br>
quantity. In practise these ratios may be significantly higher. Whey proteins are<br>
much larger than CMP and therefore are more easily physically trapped by the<br>
casein curd. Whey proteins may further aggregate as a result of various processing<br>
conditions to greatly increase the rate at which they are retained in the cheese curd.<br>
Furthermore, whey protein may complex with casein via thiol - disulphide<br>
exchange to be chemically trapped by the casein and retained in the cheese to a<br>
greater extent than the CMP. In practise, cheese may have a CMP to whey protein<br>
ratio of about 1 to 10.<br>
In this specification the term casein macropeptide or CMP is intended to describe<br>
the peptides produced by the action of rennet or any commercial milk coagulant as<br>
a result of cleaving kappa casein between amino acid position 105 and 106.<br>
Currently available technology can provide a cheese with low levels of CMP and<br>
low CMP : whey protein ratio, for example in traditional cheese, or high levels of<br>
CMP and a low CMP : whey protein ratio, for example in cheese from UF milk.<br>
However it does not provide for high levels of CMP with a high ratio of CMP :<br>
whey protein.<br>
It has been found in the present invention that an at least semi-solid dairy product<br>
containing dairy proteins with both a high level of CMP and a high ratio of CMP to<br>
whey protein can be prepared.<br>
The present invention provides the cheese maker with, an alternative method for<br>
making cheese which greatly decreases the capital investment required and<br>
produces both finished and by-products with value added properties. Furthermore<br>
the present invention offers the possibility of eliminating the need for the cheese<br>
maker to have any whey processing equipment. In addition, brining of the cheese<br>
or milling or dry salting is not required in the process.<br>
The process of the present invention is beneficial as the CMP is generated in situ<br>
within the food and retained within it naturally, with minimal processing.<br>
Importantly the present invention provides cheese with key functional attributes<br>
necessary for broad appeal. Specifically the semi-solid product is suitable for<br>
shredding and slicing because of its texture and it exhibits stretch characteristics<br>
required of pizza topping applications.<br>
Traditional cheese making process<br>
Normal cheese making procedures physically separates the whey from the renneted<br>
curd by a variety of processes including cutting, culturing, cooking, washing,<br>
cheddaring and pressing. Thus the levels of CMP and whey proteins are quite low<br>
ranging from about 0.03% up to 0.10% for CMP and 0.28% to 0.62% for whey<br>
protein by wt of the cheese. Of course if the curds are washed both CMP and whey<br>
proteins will be further reduced and to the same extent ie. the ratio of CMP to whey<br>
protein remains largely unaffected.<br>
Traditional cheese using Ultrafiltration to pre-concentrate the milk.<br>
Cheese made utilising ultrafiltration to concentrate the milk protein prior to<br>
coagulation can have CMP levels over 9 times greater than the equivalent cheese<br>
made using milk which has not been ultrafiltered. The actual level depends on the<br>
concentration factor used during the UF process. As with the traditional make<br>
procedure, both CMP and whey protein levels can be reduced to close to zero if the<br>
curds are washed with potable water. It is important to note that both the CMP and<br>
the whey proteins are increased at best proportionately since generally UF<br>
membranes concentrate both CMP and whey proteins to the same extent. So,<br>
regardless of these additional steps and regardless of the extent of ultrafiltration pre-<br>
treatment the ratio of CMP to whey protein is largely conserved. Thus the CMP:<br>
whey protein ratio remains at about 1: 5 or less.<br>
Cheese making utilising the technology of this invention<br>
The invention provides a semi-solid product in which the ratio of CMP to whey<br>
protein is greater than 1:4.9, typically in the range of 1:2 to 1:4. The total level of<br>
CMP depends on the make procedure but is at least 0.15% (wt/wt) and generally in<br>
the range of 0.3% to 1% by weight of the cheese or about 10 times greater than the<br>
levels attainable using traditional cheese making methods.<br>
For example, in the preferred embodiment, whey protein is reduced to 5% or less of<br>
the NCI protein. This NCI has a protein content of about 85% on a fat free dry<br>
basis and is combined with moisture and fat to achieve a final composition of 50%<br>
moisture and 25% protein. This results in a cheese with a CMP level of about 0.74<br>
to 1.1% and a ratio of CMP to whey protein of 1:1.7 to 1:1.1.<br>
The process for manufacturing the product of the invention utilises milk as a<br>
starting material. In the first stage of a two-stage process, the milk has most of the<br>
whey proteins and lactose removed to produce a natural casein isolate (NCI) using<br>
known methods. The second stage of the process involves mixing of the NCI with<br>
other ingredients and subsequent conversion to cheese without requiring the<br>
removal of whey. Throughout the specification unless otherwise specified milk is to<br>
be construed as whole milk, cream, skimmed milk, partly skimmed milk,<br>
evaporated milk, or any combination of these, which may have been heat treated,<br>
fat or protein standardised, pH adjusted, or have some non dairy fat or proteins<br>
added.<br>
In the present invention it was found that temperatures in excess of 50°C could be<br>
used for renneting. The temperature for renneting in cheese is normally 30°C, the<br>
optimum is 40°C and the rennet is inactivated at 55°C (Cheese and Fermented milk<br>
Foods by Frank Kosikowski 2nd ed. 1982 p420 to 421). Surprisingly we found that<br>
temperatures of up to 65°C can be used given the speed of reaction under the<br>
conditions described. This higher temperature allows the use of higher solids in the<br>
mixing stage , specifically total solids in excess of 42%, preferably 50% or greater.<br>
Even higher solids may be attained by using a rermeting enzyme with higher heat<br>
stability. Such enzymes are well known to those skilled in the art and are selected<br>
from any one or more of animal, bacterial, fungal or genetically modified sources.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 the first stage of the process is outlined schematically. The<br>
preferred embodiment utilises raw whole milk as the starting material. The raw<br>
whole milk is pasteurised, skimmed and subjected to microfiltration to reduce the<br>
whey protein content of the retentate to less than 10%, preferably about 5% to 6%<br>
of the total protein. The milk may be partially acidified, for example by<br>
hydrochloric acid or other suitable food grade acid or by microbial fermentation to<br>
the pH range of 6.4 to 5.2 if desired to solublise some of the milk minerals and to<br>
facilitate their partial removal from the retentate. This will modify the functional<br>
properties of the retentate and the texture, melt and stretch of the resultant cheese.<br>
The retentate is subsequently ultrafiltered (UF) to reduce the lactose content to less<br>
than 6%, preferably to about 1% to 2% of the total solids. The microfiltration<br>
retentate may be coagulated with rennet enzyme prior to ultrafiltration as the UF<br>
membrane largely retains the CMP, and while ultrafiltration also largely retains the<br>
whey protein, these would have been substantially removed by the previous<br>
microfiltration step. However, in the preferred embodiment rennet coagulates at a<br>
later stage. Thus, the whey or serum from the process is uncontaminated by the<br>
microbes or enzymes normally used during cheese manufacture. Furthermore, the<br>
serum is uncontaminated by the by-products of the action of these microbes and<br>
enzymes. As a result, the serum of this process has unique flavour and functional<br>
properties superior to that of traditional cheese whey. The retentate material of the<br>
first stage of this process is known as "Natural Casein Isolate" (NCI) or (Native)<br>
Phosphocaseinate (Faquant et al Technique Laitiere &amp; Marketing 1988 no. 1028, 21-<br>
23). The NCI is further concentrated by moisture removal and preferably dried to a<br>
powder of about 5% moisture, but may be used in a liquid or paste form. The<br>
process is described in more detail in example 1<br>
The second stage of the process is outlined schematically in Fig. 2. The NCI from<br>
the first stage is converted to a semi-solid dairy product with high levels of CMP<br>
and a high ratio of CMP : whey protein, using two methods, a natural cheese<br>
method or a process cheese method.<br>
In both methods the NCI is first reconstituted in water to about 20% protein (by<br>
weight of the finished product). A fat source such as cream, anhydrous milk fat<br>
(AMF), butter oil or vegetable oil is added to achieve about 20% to 25% fat in the<br>
finished product. Salt especially sodium chloride is added to taste.<br>
In Step 1 the ingredients, NCI, water, fat and salt are mixed until homogenous and<br>
free of lumps. Mixing is carried out with a single or twin screw cooker, ribbon<br>
blender or paddle mixer for example a Green Bay Machinery twin screw cooker or<br>
a Damrow single screw. The Stephan or Scanema cookers may be used. Also, for<br>
higher solids, an extruder such as a twin screw co-rotational extruder such as the<br>
type manufactured by Wenger for example may also be used. The mixing is<br>
preferably carried out at a temperature of approximately 50°C.<br>
Process cheese method<br>
In step 2 emulsifying salts well known to those skilled in the art are added to<br>
modify the melt properties or texture of the finished product. These salts also effect<br>
shelf life and flavour of the finished product. The emulsifying salts may be selected<br>
form any one or more of disodium phosphate, monosodium phosphate, trisodium<br>
phosphate, sodium acid pyrophosphate, terra sodium pyrophosphate, sodium<br>
aluminium phosphate, sodium hexa meta phosphate, sodium citrate, di calcium<br>
phosphate, EDTA.<br>
In step 3, a Rennet enzyme preparation such as Chymax from Chr. Hansens or<br>
other commercially available material is added. Concentration may vary but 0.25<br>
ml per kg of mix is adequate. While a temperature of 50°C is considered to destroy<br>
most commercial rennet enzyme preparations, the concentration of the enzyme and<br>
substrate (kappa casein) can be about ten times higher than normal cheese makes.<br>
As a result of this the action of the rennet enzyme proceeds at a pace that allows it<br>
to hydrolyse the casein sufficiently before it is thermally denatured. Rennet may<br>
also be added prior to the addition of the emulsifying salts as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Step 4 involves any suitable pasteurisation treatment with a time temperature<br>
combination of 72°C for 30 seconds for example. Excessive time temperatures can<br>
damage the flavour and texture of the cheese, while inadequate time temperature<br>
combinations may pose microbial and other quality problems. This may be<br>
accomplished by direct culinary steam injection or by indirect heat. It may be<br>
necessary to maintain a low temperature difference between the product and the<br>
heating medium (delta-T), or to use a swept or scraped heating surface, or a<br>
combination of both, to prevent heat damage to the product.<br>
Step 5 involves acidification to about 6.4 to 5.2 with a suitable food grade acid such<br>
as, but not limited to, vinegar, citric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid or glucono-<br>
delta-lactone (GDL), Preferably the acidification is conducted while mixing<br>
vigorously and using a dilute solution at or below 10% total solids (TS) so as to<br>
minimise localised pH drop. A pH at or below 6.6 is preferable for swift action of<br>
the rennet enzyme. However a pH above 5.0 is desirable to avoid thermal<br>
denaturation and coagulation of the protein during the pasteurisation step. While<br>
susceptibility to thermal coagulation is dependant on a variety of factors known to<br>
one skilled in the art such as concentration of protein, ionic environment, type of<br>
pasteurisation equipment and time temperature combination, a pH of about 6.40 to<br>
5.4 generally provides adequate thermal stability and a swift clotting time. The<br>
acidification step may be carried out before or after renneting, step 3.<br>
If all the required acidification is not accomplished before step 3 then final pH<br>
adjustment may take place at this point. Again the usual food grade acids may be<br>
used. Also if gradual pH decline after packaging is desired, glucono delta lactone<br>
or indeed starter cultures, particularly thermophillic cultures may be added after<br>
pasteurisation. Equally, a relatively static pH can be achieved in the packaged<br>
product by a number of means, firstly pasteurisation will tend to eliminate acid<br>
producing cultures or by limiting the amount of fermentable substrate.<br>
Natural cheese making process<br>
After mixing the NCI, water, fat and salt in step 1 pasteurisation (step 6) as<br>
described for the process cheese method, step 4, is carried out.<br>
In step 7 cooling of the reaction mixture is accomplished by a number of methods<br>
known to those skilled in the art such as indirect cooling by addition of ice, infusing<br>
CO2 or indeed quiescent cooling. A temperature high enough to keep the product<br>
plastic and suitable for pumping and filling into containers is generally desirable<br>
and this depends on the compositional characteristics such as fat level and type,<br>
moisture content and pH. Generally a temperature of above 40°C is adequate. The<br>
temperature should be low enough to allow acidification. If a food grade acid is<br>
used, the temperature should preferably be below approximately 70°C to avoid<br>
coagulation induced by elevated temperatures and localised low pH. If<br>
thermophillic cultures are used a temperature of 52°C or below is required<br>
(depending on the thermal sensitivity of the culture used). In general a temperature<br>
of approximately 50°C is adequate.<br>
In step 8 commercially available dairy cultures and more specifically thermophilic<br>
cultures are used to provide the necessary acidification depending on the<br>
availability of a fermentable carbohydrate substrate . For example a fermentation of<br>
an available lactose content of 1 to 2g per 100g of finished product by a Chris<br>
Hansen DVS thermophilic culture ABT-21, TCC 4 or TCC 21 might be used with<br>
to produce a suitable pH drop. The residual lactose in the NCI can provide this or<br>
any fermentable carbohydrate can be added. The amount of lactose is not narrowly<br>
critical and it depends on the initial pH, desired final pH and the buffering capacity<br>
of the product. Generally about 2% lactose is adequate. Those skilled in the art will<br>
recognise that more or less lactose can be added limited only by the requirement for<br>
certain textural, sensory or shelf life requirements. Cultures may also be used<br>
including non-starter lactic acid bacteria for the development of probiotic properties<br>
or flavour during storage or exo-polysaccharide producers to alter the texture.<br>
In step 9, the same enzymes as described in step 3 for the process cheese method are<br>
used. However the level used will be about a half to a tenth of the levels used in step<br>
3. Much less heat denaturation of the enzyme will occur in the "Natural" method,<br>
if it is added after pasteurisation, as compared with the "Process" method and<br>
generally high levels of residual rennet enzyme activity is not desirable if bitter<br>
flavour development is to be avoided. It is also possible with the natural process to<br>
add the rennet enzyme before pasteurisation or during the heating up phase prior to<br>
pasteurisation, as described elsewhere temperatures in the range of 50°C work well.<br>
Process Cheese Method &amp; Natural Cheese Method<br>
Packaging in step 10 is readily accomplished as at this point the product is a plastic<br>
mass and is easily pumped and moulded. The product may be cooled to 15°C to<br>
10°C and stored for some time if flavour development is desired. Temperatures of<br>
below 10°C should be used for longer term storage. The product will firm up to a<br>
semi-solid on storage and may be subsequently demoulded and sliced or shredded<br>
as required.<br>
One of the principal benefits of the process of the invention is that the cheese maker<br>
using either process does not generate any whey during manufacture. The benefits<br>
of this are tremendous since traditional cheese plants must process about 19 parts of<br>
highly perishable milk and whey for every 1 part of cheese produced at considerable<br>
capital, operational and often environmental expense. The process of the current<br>
invention provides for the processing of about 0.5 parts of shelf stable dry<br>
ingredients (although perishable ingredients like liquid NCI and cream are not<br>
excluded) together with 0.5 parts of water (the water may be provided partly or<br>
completely by liquid cream or liquid NCI if they are used) to produce 1 part of<br>
cheese with unique nutritional properties. The capital savings this process offers are<br>
enormous and conservatively estimated to be a ten-fold reduction on a traditional<br>
plant with the same production capacity. Other benefits are that the stability of the<br>
ingredients and simplicity of the conversion process allows for this cheese to be<br>
manufactured in regions where there is no native milk supply. In addition the<br>
conversion or cheese making process could easily be performed in store or<br>
restaurant. The make time of minutes is significantly less than the hours required<br>
for conventional methods.<br>
EXAMPLE 1: Manufacture of the NCI<br>
Microfiltration/Ultrafiltration<br>
For the micronltration steps, a Crossflow Microfiltration system (MFS-7, Terra Pak<br>
Filtration, Aarhus, Denmark) is used. The unit consisted of 7 ceramic membrane<br>
elements, each having a surface area of 0.2 m2, giving a total membrane area of<br>
1.4m2. The membranes used (Societe des Ceramiques Technique-Membralox,<br>
Bazet, France) have an average pore diameter of 0.1µ., a channel diameter of 4mm<br>
and are aluminium based ceramic membranes. This plant is operated in a<br>
continuous mode.<br>
For the ultrafiltration step, a batch concentration ultrafiltration system is used. The<br>
unit comprises 2 membranes each having a surface area of 6.4m2, giving a total<br>
membrane area of 12.8m2. The membranes used are KOCH type - HFK131. These<br>
membranes are spiral wound, polyethersulfone having a nominal molecular weight<br>
cut off(MWCO) in the range 5,000-8,000 Dalton.<br>
Operating conditions<br>
The microfiltration plant operates using the Terra Pak designed Uniform<br>
Transmembrane Pressure (UTMP) control system. This system results in a uniform<br>
transmembrane pressure all over the membrane area.<br>
The microfiltration is carried out at 50°C. The pressure at the retentate inlet and<br>
outlet is 4.5 bar and 2.6 bar, and at the permeate inlet and outlet it is 3.8 and 2,2<br>
bar.<br>
When operating the plant, the difference between the inlet and outlet Trans<br>
Membrane Pressures (TMP) is maintained at a value of 0.3. This difference was<br>
calculated as follows:<br>
Retentate in (PBS) = 4.5 bar<br>
Permeate in (PPi) = 3.8 bar<br>
TMP inlet = 0.7 bar<br>
Retentate out (PRo) = 2.6 bar<br>
Permeate out (PPo) = 2.2 bar<br>
TMP inlet = 0.4 bar<br>
Difference (TMPi-TMPo) = 0.3 bar<br>
The plant is operated at a concentration factor (CF) of 2.5X and a permeate flux of<br>
50 L/m2/h. The concentration factor for MF is calculated as follows:<br>
CF = (retentate flow + permeate flow)/retentate flow<br>
The ultrafiltration plant is operated at an inlet pressure of 4 bar and an outlet<br>
pressure of 1.5 bar.<br>
NCI Process conditions<br>
The process is illustrated in Fig. 1.<br>
Pasteurised skimmed milk was obtained from a production run at Glanbia<br>
Ingredients, Ballyragget Factory, Co. Kilkenny. This material was heated to 50°C<br>
and processed through the MF plant at a CF of 2.5X and a permeate flux off 50<br>
L/mVh. The micellar casein is retained during MF and is further washed using<br>
diafiltration.<br>
The diafiltration was carried out in a batch mode by diluting the MF retentate to<br>
8% TS with the diafiltration water and passing it through the MF plant again. The<br>
MF was again operated at 50°C, CF of 2.5X and a permeate flux off 50 L/m2/h.<br>
The MF retentate from the DF step was diluted to 10% total solids. This material<br>
was HTST pasteurised at 72°C x 16 sec. Ultrafiltration and diafiltration of this<br>
material was then carried out at 50°C.<br>
The UF retentate (NCI) was dried at 50°C and 20-25%TS. A spray dryer (APV<br>
Anhydro, Copenhagen, Denmark) with nozzle atomisation was used. The inlet and<br>
outlet air temperatures were 200°C and 98°C, respectively.<br>
It will be appreciated that this example of NCI manufacture is not intended to be<br>
proscriptive. Indeed alternative operating parameters are attainable, for example<br>
higher flow rates and CF factors are attainable. Also an evaporation step may be<br>
employed prior to or in-place of the spray-drying step. Indeed the MF/UF retentate<br>
may be utilised if a sufficiently high protein is attained. Furthermore, as is known to<br>
those skilled in the art lower pH during UF and MF facilitates the removal of some<br>
of the calcium.<br>
The invention is not limited to the embodiments herein described and may be<br>
varied in detail. For example oils of plant, marine or other origins may be used in<br>
place of the cream described herein. Other ingredients with physical or biological<br>
functionality may be added to further enhance the finished product to the tastes of<br>
the local market. Indeed since no whey need be removed, this technology is ideally<br>
suited to these modifications since the added ingredients will remain with the<br>
product and not tend to be largely lost in the whey.<br>
