CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent<br>
Application Serial Number 09/730,174, filed December 5, 2000, entitled<br>
ANTIBODIES AND PEPTIDE ANTIGENS FOR PRODUCING ANTIBODIES<br>
HAVING A SELECTIVE BINDING SPECIFICITY TO BIOACTIVE INTACT<br>
PARATHYROID HORMONE (PTH) 1-84, and now in the issuance process, the<br>
teachings of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
STATEMENT RE:     FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT<br>
Not Applicable<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and its importance in regulating the concentration<br>
of calcium ions in the blood is well-known. In this regard, such hormone is created<br>
by the parathyroid glands and, in combination with other factors, functions to regulate<br>
the blood calcium ion levels such that the same is maintained in a steady<br>
concentration in both cells and surrounding fluids. Essentially, PTH functions to<br>
release stored calcium in the body when serum calcium levels decrease. On the other<br>
hand, such secretion is suppressed to the extent the serum calcium concentration<br>
increases.<br>
In its complete form PTH comprises a unique peptide comprised of 84 amino<br>
acids. The specific sequence of PTH, as provided for a plurality of species, namely,<br>
humans, rats, mice, bovids, dogs, pigs, cats and monkeys are depicted in Figure 1, and<br>
a variation thereof in Figure 2, which illustrates the relatively consistent structure<br>
such hormone maintains between such identified species.<br>
Given its significance in calcium metabolism for not only humans, but a<br>
variety of species, accurately measuring PTH has and continues to be of substantial<br>
clinical significance. As is well-documented, serum PTH levels serve as an important<br>
parameter    for    patients    having    diseases    such    as    hypercalcemia,    primary<br>
2<br><br>
hyperparathyroidism and osteoporosis, among many others. PTH likewise becomes<br>
of substantial clinical importance in patients afflicted with chronic renal failure who,<br>
because of PTH abnormalities, can develop renal osteodystrophy.<br>
Notwithstanding its important role in metabolism and clinical significance,<br>
substantial difficulties have and continue to exist with regard to determinating<br>
circulating biologically active PTH levels. First of all, it is well-known that PTH is<br>
normally present at extremely low levels, which are normally between 10 pg/ml to 65<br>
pg/ml. Furthermore, it is known that the PTH peptide can be present in a variety of<br>
circulating PTH fragments, and in particular large non-(l-84) circulating PTH<br>
fragments which appear to co-migrate chromatographically with the (7-84) PTH<br>
molecule and are known to significantly interfere with conventional PTH assay<br>
measurements. Indeed, the large non-(l-84) PTH fragments may represent about one-<br>
half (1/2) of the PTH measured by a majority of current assays. Exemplary of the<br>
current shortcomings of the accurate measurement of PTH are set forth in published<br>
Patent Cooperation Treaty International Application No. PCT/US00/00855,<br>
International Publication No. WO/00/42437, entitled Methods for Differentiating and<br>
Monitoring Parathyroid and Bone Status Related Diseases, and Lepage, Raymond et<br>
al., A Non-(l-84) Circulating Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Fragment Interferes With<br>
Intact PTH Commercial Assay Measurement In Uremic Samples, Clinical Chemistry<br>
44:4, 1998 pages 805-809, the teachings of which are expressly incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
In an attempt to address such shortcomings, a new assay for detecting PTH<br>
levels was introduced by Scantibodies Laboratory, of Santee, California, which<br>
incorporates a tracer antibody having a binding specificity for the very end N-terminal<br>
fraction of human PTH, and more specifically, the first six amino acid residues<br>
thereof. As presently understood, such assay appears to minimize cross-reactivity<br>
with large non-(l-84) PTH fragments. However, to derive such antibodies requires<br>
substantial effort and expense in purifying the same. Moreover, such tracer antibodies<br>
have maximum recognition for only the first amino acid residue of PTH, and<br>
substantially reduced specificity for any subsequent residues thus obviating its use for<br>
some other species where the first amino acid is different. Such drawbacks are<br>
discussed in the article by John, M.R.et al., entitled A Novel Immunoradiometric<br>
Assay  Detects   Full-Length  Human   PTH   but  not  Amino-Terminally  Truncated<br>
3<br><br>
Fragments: Implications for PTH Measurements in Renal Failure, The Journal of<br>
Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, Vol. 84, No. 11, 1999, p. 4287-4290, the<br>
teachings of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Thus, there has been and continues to be a long felt need in the art for an assay<br>
binding partner and method of generating the same that is specific for bioactive intact<br>
PTH that can determine PTH levels with mitigated cross-reactivity to PTH peptide<br>
fragments. There is likewise a need in the art for improved PTH binding partners that<br>
can measure PTH levels in a more cost-effective manner and have a greater affinity<br>
for PTH that can be readily incorporated into immunoassay kits and the like. Still<br>
further there is a need for binding partners, namely, antibodies having a binding<br>
recognition that is specific to PTH and can be utilized to detect PTH levels over a<br>
wide-variety of species. Finally, there is a need in the art for an improved binding<br>
partner having a high binding affinity for PTH that may be readily derived using<br>
conventional mechanisms that requires minimal purification, results in greater binding<br>
recognition for intact PTH, possesses minimal cross reactivity to large non-(l-84)<br>
PTH fragments, and can be derived utilizing methods that generate higher antibody<br>
yields than prior art binding partners.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention specifically addresses and alleviates the above-<br>
identified deficiencies in art. In this regard, the present invention is directed to certain<br>
antigens, antibodies, and methods for producing antibodies that are useful in<br>
determining bioactive intact PTH levels in a sample fluid, such as serum, plasma or<br>
cell culture media. The antibodies and methods of the present invention have the<br>
particular advantages of possessing greater affinity for PTH, and in particular, are<br>
designed to have a novel recognition for the first few amino acid residues extending<br>
from the first N-terminal PTH residue but preferably not beyond the fourth amino<br>
acid residue of PTH. In a most highly preferred embodiment, the antibodies will have<br>
a specificity for the first three amino acid residues of N-terminal PTH. The antibodies<br>
further have no cross-reactivity with the large non-(l-84) molecular forms of PTH.<br>
Moreover, the antigens, antibodies and methods of producing the same according to<br>
the present invention have substantial cross- reactivity with a wide variety of species,<br><br>
and may be utilized to detect PTH levels in not only humans, but also in rais, mice,<br>
bovids, dogs, pigs, cats and monkeys.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the antigen comprises the formula:<br>
VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY<br>
wherein X is selected from the group consisting of LEU [SEQ ID NO. 1] and<br>
PHE [SEQ ID NO. 2], With respect to such embodiment, such antigenic peptide<br>
represents amino acid residues 2-12 of PTH, with the sixth amino acid residue thereof<br>
being selective between LEU and PHE, the former occurring in the PTH of humans,<br>
rats, mice and pigs, on one hand, and the latter, being inherent in the PTH of bovines<br>
and dogs, on the other hand. In a more highly preferred embodiment, the antigen<br>
comprises a peptide having the formula:<br>
Y-VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY<br>
wherein X is an amino acid residue selected between LEU and PHE, as<br>
discussed above, and Y is an amino acid residue consisting of either SER or ALA<br>
[SEQ ID NO. 3, SEQ ID NO. 4, SEQ ID NO. 5, and SEQ ID NO. 6, respectively], the<br>
former reflecting the amino acid present in humans, dogs, and pigs, and the latter<br>
being inherent in the PTH of rats, mice and bovines.<br>
In further preferred embodiments, the antigen comprises the formula:<br>
VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY-LYS-HIS-LEU<br>
wherein X is selected from the group consisting of LEU [SEQ ID NO. 7] or<br>
PHE [SEQ ID NO. 8]. Such antigenic peptide represents amino acid residues 2-15 of<br>
PTH, with the sixth amino acid residue comprising either LEU or PHE, to thus reflect<br>
the corresponding amino acid residue occurring in the appropriate species specified<br>
above. In another embodiment, the antigenic peptide represents amino acid residues<br>
1-15 of PTM and comprises the formula:<br>
Y-VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY-LYS-HIS-LEU<br>
5<br><br>
wherein X comprises amino acid residue LEU or PHE and Y is an amino acid<br>
residue consisting of either SER or ALA [SEQ ID NO. 9, SEQ ID NO. 10, SEQ ID<br>
NO. 11, and SEQ ID NO. 12, respectively], the latter being selective to correspond to<br>
a particular species identified above.<br>
With respect to the antibodies and methods of producing the same according<br>
to the present invention, such are directed to antibodies having an affinity and<br>
specificity for the aforementioned antigens.  Preferably, the antibodies are specific to<br>
amino acid residues 2-12, 1-12, 2-15 and 1-15, respectively, of PTH. In a most highly<br>
preferred embodiment, the antibodies are specific to only the first three amino acid<br>
residues   of  PTH.   Such   antibodies   are   preferably   produced   via  the   steps   of<br>
administering a peptide antigen of the aforementioned variety, either alone or in<br>
combination with a carrier protein, to a host animal, which preferably comprises a<br>
goat, to produce antibody production against the peptide antigen.   In an alternative,<br>
preferred embodiment, antibody production is induced via the administration of larger<br>
peptide fragments of PTH.    Preferably, such PTH fragment may comprise (1-34)<br>
PTH, which may further optionally include a carrier protein covalently linked-or fused<br>
thereto to increase antigenicity or intact (1-84) PTH.   To the extent antibodies are<br>
sought to be derived to detect PTH in humans, the intact (1-84) PTH molecule<br>
preferably comprises intact rat PTH or, to a lesser extent, human PTH. The antibody<br>
titer produced  by the administration of the antigen  to the host animal  is then<br>
monitored.  Thereafter, antisera produced in the host animal is then isolated and the<br>
antibodies thereof are selected by affinity chromatography to have specificity for the<br>
desired antigenic region of PTH (i.e., amino acid residues 2-12, 1-12, 2-15 and 1-15<br>
of PTH, respectively). In an additional step, the isolated antibodies are further purified<br>
to remove those antibodies having an affinity for amino acid residues extending<br>
beyond the fourth or fifth N-terminal PTH amino acid residue by using bound<br>
antigens corresponding to either (4-34) PTH and/or (4-84) PTH or (5-34) PTH and/or<br>
(5-84) PTH that retain unwanted antibodies but allow those antibodies specific for<br>
only (1-3) or (1-4) PTH to pass. The antibodies may then be labeled or otherwise<br>
incorporated into any of a variety of conventional assays for use in the detection of<br>
PTH, whether it would be for humans or any of a variety of species.<br>
6<br><br>
As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the antigens, antibodies and<br>
methods of the present invention, by focusing on amino acid residues 2-12, 1-12, 2-15<br>
and 1-15 of PTH, respectively, focus on that portion of the PTH molecule possessing<br>
N-terminal biological activity, and thus maximize detection of the same. Moreover,<br>
with respect to the more highly preferred embodiments, by providing antigens,<br>
antibodies and methods of producing the same that are inclusive of other amino acid<br>
residues extending beyond the N-terminal biologically active site (i.e., up to and<br>
including the twelfth (12th) and fifteenth (15th) amino acid residues of PTH), the<br>
specificity and affinity of such antibodies are thus more highly refined and enable the<br>
same to detect PTH levels with greater specificity and affinity than prior art receptors,<br>
as incorporated into assays and the like. In a most highly preferred embodiment, the<br>
antibodies have a specificity for no more than the first three amino acid residues of<br>
PTH which, as discussed, is accomplished via a removal or "scrubbing" step whereby<br>
antibodies produced via the use of the antigens of the present invention are selectively<br>
removed to the extent any such antibodies have an affinity for (4-34) PTH or (4-84)<br>
PTH. As a consequence, the antibodies produced according to the present invention<br>
(as well as the methods and peptide antigens disclosed herein for achieving that end)<br>
have substantially eliminated cross-reactivity to large, non (1-84) PTH peptide<br>
fragments, do not possess maximum recognition for only the first amino acid residue<br>
of PTH, and further, may be readily derived in a cost-effective manner insofar as the<br>
antibody yields generated from methods of the present invention should be greater<br>
than prior art methods.<br>
Alternatively, such removal or "scrubbing" step will be utilized to selectively<br>
remove antibodies having an affinity for (5-34) PTH or (5-84) PTH. By doing so, the<br>
antibodies ultimately isolated will have an affinity for no more than the first four<br>
amino acid residues of N-terminal PTH. It is therefore an object of the present<br>
invention to provide: 1) select antigens for the production and isolation of antibodies;<br>
2) antibodies; and 3) methods of producing antibodies that have a binding affinity and<br>
specificity for PTH that possess mitigated cross-reactivity to large non (1-84) PTH<br>
peptide fragments.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide: 1) select antigens for the<br>
production of antibodies; 2) antibodies; and 3) methods of producing antibodies that<br>
have a greater affinity and specificity for PTH than prior art binding partners and<br><br>
further, possess a higher degree of cross reactivity between inter-species PTH such<br>
that the antigens, antibodies and methods producing the same according the present<br>
invention can be readily utilized for the detection of PTH in a variety of species.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide: 1) select antigens for the<br>
production and isolation of antibodies; 2) antibodies; and 3) methods of producing<br>
antibodies which have a binding affinity and specificity for more of the biologically<br>
active N-terminal portion of PTH and, hence, are more effective and accurate in<br>
determining bioactive intact PTH levels than prior art binding partners directed<br>
thereto.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide: 1) select antigens for the<br>
production and isolation of antibodies; 2) antibodies; and 3) methods of producing<br>
antibodies which do not possess a maximum binding affinity for only the first N-<br>
terminal amino acid residue of PTH.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide: 1) select antigens for the<br>
production and isolation of antibodies; 2) antibodies; and 3) methods of producing<br>
antibodies that are less expensive to produce and generate higher antibody yields than<br>
prior art methods for producing antibodies having a binding affinity and specificity<br>
for the N-terminal of PTH.<br>
Still further objects of the present invention are to provide: 1) select antigens<br>
for the production and isolation of antibodies; 2) antibodies; and 3) methods of<br>
producing antibodies which readily derive antibodies which may be readily<br>
incorporated into any of a variety of commercially-available assays and further, can<br>
be modified (e.g., to include a label, and the like) as may be desired for any of a<br>
variety of immunoassay applications.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The detailed description set forth below is intended as a description of the<br>
presently preferred embodiment of the invention, and is not intended to represent the<br>
only form in which the present invention may be constructed or utilized. The<br>
description sets forth the functions and sequences of steps for constructing and<br>
operating the invention. It is to be understood, however, that the same or equivalent<br>
functions and sequences may be accomplished by different embodiments and that<br>
they are also intended to be encompassed within the scope of the invention.<br>
The present invention encompasses antigens, antibodies and methods of<br>
producing antibodies that are directed to an antigenic region of PTH positioned in the<br>
N-terminal region thereof, and more precisely, the first fifteen (15) amino acid<br>
residues extending from the N-terminal depicted as 10 in Figures 1-3. In a most<br>
highly preferred embodiment, the antibodies are specific for only the first three (3)<br>
amino acid residues of PTH. As is well-known, the N-terminal region of PTH is<br>
recognized as necessary for PTH/PTHrp receptor binding, and is further recognized as<br>
being most desirable epitope for measuring bioactive intact PTH levels, as may be<br>
found in a biological fluid sample, such as serum, plasma or cell culture media.<br>
Indicative of the current state of the art associated with PTH and the methods of<br>
detecting the same are discussed at length in published Patent Cooperation Treaty<br>
International Application No. PCT/USOO/00855, International Publication No.<br>
WO/00/42437, entitled Methods for Differentiating and Monitoring Parathyroid and<br>
Bone Status Related Diseases, and Lepage, Raymond et al., A Non-(l-84) Circulating<br>
Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) Fragment Interferes With Intact PTH Commercial Assay<br>
Measurement In Uremic Samples, Clinical Chemistry 44:4, 1998 pages 805-809, the<br>
teachings of which are expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
9<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the antigenic peptide of the present<br>
invention comprises those amino acid residues corresponding to amino acid residues<br>
2-12 of PTH, collectively identified as 12 in Figures 1-3. Specifically, such antigenic<br>
peptide will have the formula:<br>
VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY<br>
wherein X is an amino acid residue selected from either LEU [SEQ NO. 1] or<br>
PHE [SEQ NO. 2]. As will be recognized by those skilled in the art, the sixth (6th)<br>
amino acid residue of this PTH peptide fragment does differ between the cited species<br>
whereby such residue comprises LEU in humans, rats, mice and pigs, on one hand,<br>
but PHE for bovids and dogs on the other. As will be appreciated by those skilled in<br>
the art, notwithstanding the single amino acid residue difference, such antigenic<br>
peptide remains otherwise constant between the cited species which, as discussed<br>
more fully below, can enable antibodies to be prepared and ultimately utilized that are<br>
cross-reactive and, hence, effective in detecting PTH levels in a variety of such<br>
species.<br>
In a more highly preferred embodiment, the peptide antigen reflects the first<br>
twelve (12) amino acid residues of PTH, identified as 14, and comprises the formula:<br>
Y-VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY<br>
wherein X is an amino acid residue selected from either LEU or PHE and Y is<br>
an amino acid residue selected from either SER or ALA [SEQ ID NO. 3, SEQ ID NO.<br>
4, SEQ ID NO. 5 and SEQ ID NO. 6, respectively]. With respect to the variation at<br>
the first amino acid residue, it will be readily appreciated that such antigenic peptide<br>
may be formed such that such amino acid comprises SER, as found in humans, dogs<br>
and pigs, or ALA, as found in rats, mice and bovids. In this respect, the variation<br>
provided for in the antigenic peptide in the present invention, and in particular the<br>
more highly preferred embodiments thereof, provide leeway such that the antibodies<br>
ultimately derived from such antigenic peptides may be formed to possess a higher<br>
binding affinity as may be desired to detect PTH in a given species.<br>
10<br><br>
In more highly refined embodiments of the present invention, the antigenic<br>
peptides comprise sequences that correspond to amino acid residue 2-15 and 1-15,<br>
respectively, of PTH. With regard to the former, identified in Figures 1-3 as 16, such<br>
antigenic peptide will have the formula:<br>
VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY-LYS-HIS-LEU<br>
wherein X is an amino acid residue selected from either LEU [SEQ ID NO. 7]<br>
or PHE [SEQ ID NO. 8]. With respect to the latter embodiment corresponding to<br>
amino acid residues 1-15 of PTH, identified as 10, such antigenic peptide will have<br>
the formula:<br>
Y-VAL-SER-GLU-ILE-GLN-X-MET-HIS-ASN-LEU-GLY-LYS-HIS-LEU<br>
wherein X is an amino acid residue selected from either LEU or PHE and Y is<br>
an amino acid residue selected from either SER or ALA [SEQ ID NO. 9, SEQ ID NO.<br>
10, SEQ ID NO. 11, and SEQ ID NO. 12, respectively]. A compact disc providing a<br>
computer readable form of SEQ ID NOS. 1-12 in compliance with the requirements<br>
of 37 CFR 1.821-1.825, which is identical to the written sequence listing provided<br>
herein, has been submitted to comply with such statutory requirements.<br>
Notwithstanding the foregoing formulas for the aforementioned peptides, it will be<br>
recognized that the same will extend to all functional derivatives thereof, which is<br>
meant to include functionally comparable peptides derived from the same region of<br>
PTH, as reflected in the sequences of Figures 1-3, and having a similar ability to<br>
induce specific anti-PTH antibodies, and more particularly antibodies specific to the<br>
N-terminal amino acid residues of PTH. In this regard, such functional derivative<br>
may be similarly positioned peptides or peptides derived from the sequences<br>
discussed above and reflected in Figures 1-3 having substitutions, additions or<br>
deletions of amino acids, provided the derivation does not alter the ability of the<br>
peptide antigen to induce antibody reactive to PTH.<br>
It should further be recognized that the peptide antigens of the present<br>
invention include those peptides whose amino acid sequence may be shifted within a<br>
few amino acids upstream or downstream of the peptides discussed above in Figures<br>
II<br><br>
1-3, as well as those peptides having conservative amino acid changes such that<br>
substitutions, additions or deletions of amino. acids or changes do not significantly<br>
effect the ability of the peptide antigen to induce antibodies with high affinity and<br>
specificity for the first twelve amino acid residues of PTH , or any sub-components<br>
thereof.<br>
With regard to antibody production, there is illustrated in Figure 4 the method<br>
20 of generating the same. Initially, there is provided a peptide 22 of the<br>
aforementioned variety which corresponds to all or a portion of the first twelve (12) to<br>
fifteen (15) amino acid residues of PTH of a given species. According to a more<br>
highly preferred embodiment, however, the antigenic peptide utilized to generate<br>
antibody production will include larger PTH fragments, including but not limited to<br>
the (1-34) PTH and the entire intact (1-84) PTH peptide. Along these lines, while the<br>
antibodies ultimately produced will have specificity to those amino acid residues<br>
corresponding to the aforementioned antigenic peptides (i.e., amino acid sequencing<br>
2-12, 1-12, 2-15 and/or 1-15 of PTH) within the method of the present invention, at<br>
least with respect to the initial step of providing an antigen 22 and subsequently<br>
administering the same, via step 24 discussed below, it will be appreciated that the<br>
entire PTH peptide and any N-terminal fragment thereof can preferably serve as a<br>
suitable antigenic peptide to induce the production of antibodies which will ultimately<br>
possess the ideal binding affinity and specificity for the biologically active portion of<br>
PTH at the N-terminal thereof. In a most highly preferred embodiment, the antigenic<br>
peptide provided and administered will comprise the PTH fragment corresponding to<br>
amino acid residues 1-34 of PTH, which may optionally be coupled to a carrier<br>
protein. Such peptide fragment may alternatively preferably be administered as whole<br>
length (1-84) PTH, which may take the form of any of the species identified in<br>
Figures 1 and 2. Preferably, in the context of developing antibodies specific for<br>
human PTH, the use of (1-34) rat PTH or whole length (1-84) rat PTH is preferred.<br>
Such antigenic peptides may be produced by any of a variety of methods well-<br>
known in the art, including synthesis by conventional methods, such as solid-phase<br>
chemical synthesis or by recombinant technology. As will be further appreciated, the<br>
synthetic peptides may optionally be chemically coupled to a carrier protein or,<br>
alternatively, recombinant peptides may be generated as fusion proteins to increase<br>
antigenicity. As will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art, such antigenic<br>
12<br><br>
peptides may be screened based upon their ability to induce anti PTH antibody. In<br>
this respect, such screening techniques may include, but are not limited to,<br>
immunoprecipitation or immunoassay.<br>
Once derived, such peptide antigens may then be utilized to generate the<br>
antibodies of the present invention using conventional techniques. In this regard, the<br>
peptide antigen(s), preferably in combination with an adjuvant, is/are administered to<br>
a host animal 24, which preferably comprises a goat. It should be recognized,<br>
however, that other species, such as rabbits, mice, sheep, chicken, etc., may<br>
additionally be utilized as host animals. In this respect, the administration of such<br>
antigens may be accomplished by any of a variety of methods, including but not<br>
limited to subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. As will be appreciated, the dose<br>
of peptide antigen administered will correspondingly vary with the specific peptide<br>
utilized, as well as the animal host. As will additionally be recognized, however, in<br>
order to obtain antibodies possessing the highest affinity and specificity possible for a<br>
given species, separate antibodies should be generated against the appropriate<br>
comparable peptide from each species.<br>
Once administered, the results of antibody titers produced in the host animal<br>
are then monitored 26, which may be conducted by any of a variety of techniques<br>
well-known in the art, using routine bleeds and the like, with the antisera being<br>
isolated (e.g., via centrifugation), in step 28, and thereafter screened for the presence<br>
of anti-peptide antibodies having a binding affinity therefor. It will further be<br>
recognized that given the foregoing conventional immunological methods for deriving<br>
the antibodies of the present invention, such antibodies may be monoclonal or<br>
polyclonal in nature. Consistent with conventional practice it is preferred that the<br>
antisera be derived from a plurality of host animals.<br>
The resultant antisera derived from the host animal may be affinity purified to<br>
derive the antibodies for the present invention. As is well-known in the art, the<br>
antisera may be purified via conventional techniques, such as the introduction into a<br>
separation column with the aforementioned antigenic peptides corresponding to<br>
amino acid residue sequences 2-12, 1-12, 2-15 and/or 1-15 of PTH being bound to a<br>
solid phase (e.g., beads and the like). The antiserum may then be washed to remove<br>
antibodies not having specificity for the antigenic peptide or peptides, with the<br>
remaining bound antibody, specific for the antigenic peptide or peptides, ultimately<br>
13<br><br>
being eluted therefrom.  Such antibody may then be stored per conventional practices<br>
well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
In an additional step 29, the antibodies derived through such isolation and<br>
purification process will undergo a further purification process whereby any<br>
antibodies present in the antisera having an affinity for (4-34) or (5-34) PTH and/or<br>
(4-84) or (5-84) PTH are selectively removed or "scrubbed." To that end, it is<br>
contemplated that once the antisera is isolated in step 28, the same may be purified to<br>
remove any antibodies having specificity for (4-34) or (5-34) PTH and/or (4-84) or<br>
(5-84) PTH for any of the species specified herein via the use of a separation column<br>
or other known conventional techniques whereby antigenic peptides corresponding to<br>
either amino acid sequences (4-34) or (5-34) PTH or (4-84) (5-84) PTH are bound to<br>
a solid phase with the antisera sought to be purified being subjected thereto. Any<br>
antibody having a specificity for a specific (4-34) or (5-34) PTH and/or (4-84) or (5-<br>
84) PTH peptide will remain bound and the remaining antibodies not having<br>
specificity for the (4-34) or (5-34) PTH or (4-84) or (5-84) PTH peptide will be<br>
separated therefrom. Advantageously, such process will thus isolate only those<br>
antibodies having an affinity for at most the first three (3) or four (4) amino residues<br>
of PTH, and thus will have no binding affinity whatsoever for any amino acid<br>
residues at or beyond the fifth amino acid residue of the N-terminal of PTH. Such<br>
process thus ensures that any antibodies ultimately isolated will, in fact, be specific to<br>
the N-most terminal of (1-84) PTH and thus not otherwise bind to any type of PTH<br>
fragment that does not include at least the first three or four N-terminus amino acid<br>
residues of PTH.<br>
As such antibodies are isolated using those antigenic peptides corresponding<br>
to amino acid residue sequences 2-12 and 2-15 of PTH, respectively, there will thus<br>
correspondingly be isolated antibodies that have not necessarily acquired a binding<br>
affinity, much less a maximum binding affinity, for the first amino acid residue of<br>
PTH, which is known to be problematic of antibodies derived via prior art methods.<br>
Along these lines, the elimination or substantial suppression of antibodies having an<br>
affinity for the first amino acid residue of PTH will likewise be achieved by utilizing<br>
peptide sequences corresponding to 1-12 and 1-15, respectively, of PTH provided that<br>
such sequences are selected from those species having a dissimilar first amino acid<br>
residue from the species for which the antibodies ultimately derived will be utilized.<br><br>
For example, in order to derive antibodies suitable for detecting PTH levels in humans<br>
that lack in specificity for the first amino acid residue of human PTH, it will be<br>
recognized that anti-rat PTH sera derived from the host animal may be purified<br>
against peptides corresponding to amino acid residue sequences 1-12 and 1-15 of<br>
human PTH. As will be understood, because the first N-terminal amino acid residue<br>
of rat PTH comprises ALA, as opposed to SER found in humans, any antibodies<br>
ultimately isolated will necessarily possess a binding affinity for the amino acid<br>
residues extending beyond such first amino acid residue sequence.<br>
Once derivatized in step 30, such antibodies may be used in immunological<br>
techniques to correlate the presence of bioactive intact PTH as may be found in a<br>
given sample (e.g., serum or plasma). In this respect, the antibodies of the present<br>
invention may be used alone or in combination to screen a given sample to determine<br>
the presence of bioactive intact PTH but yet advantageously avoid cross-reactivity<br>
with the large non (1-84) PTH fragments. By way of example, such antibodies may be<br>
incorporated into an immunological assay kit. Exemplary of such applications<br>
include the human bioactive intact PTH and rat bioactive intact PTH ELISA kits,<br>
produced by Immutopics, inc., of San Clemente, California which provide an<br>
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the quantitative determination of<br>
bioactive intact PTH levels in serum, plasma or cell culture media. In this regard,<br>
given the foregoing applicability to derive antibodies specific to PTH for a variety of<br>
species, it will be recognized that such immunological assay kits, such as those<br>
provided by Immutopics, Inc., may be specifically designed such that the affinity and<br>
specificity of such antibodies apply to a wide variety of species or alternatively,<br>
generated against the appropriate comparable peptide of a given species such that the<br>
kits are more narrowly tailored for a given species.<br>
Additional modifications and improvements of the present invention may also<br>
be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art. Thus, the particular combination of<br>
parts described and illustrated herein is intended to represent only a certain<br>
embodiment of the present invention, and is not intended to serve as a limitation of<br>
alternative devices within the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br>
