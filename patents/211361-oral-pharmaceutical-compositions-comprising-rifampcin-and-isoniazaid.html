				<td>NOVEL PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITIONS OF ANTI - TUBERCULAR DRUGS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
Tuberculosis is a major problem largely of developing countries but lately emergence of Mycobacterium infections in HIV infected individuals is also on the rise in developed countries. The management of tuberculosis treatment is further complicated due to emergence of drug resistance. Drug resistance in tuberculosis is due to inappropriate prescribing or taking of medications, effectively resulting in monotherapy. To reduce the possibility of monotherapy, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases (IUATLD) have recommended that antitubercular drugs should be taken in combination (Fixed dose combination tablets for the treatment of tuberculosis, Report of an informal meeting held in Geneva 27 April 1999, World Health Organization Communicable Diseases Cluster, 1999). A number of combinations of first line drugs containing rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol. This fixed dose combination (FDC) tablets provide a simple approach to delivering the correct number of drugs at the correct dosage as all the necessary drugs are combined in a single tablet. By altering the number of pills according to the patient's body weight, complete treatment is delivered without the need for calculation of dose. However, such FDC tablets are not free from disadvantages. The major issue is the adverse effect on bioavailability of rifampicin in presence of other drugs. Various researchers have worked on several aspects of this problem of FDC tablets and several recommendations are recorded in literature. WHO attributes that when rifampicin combined with the other drug within the same formulation the bioavailability negatively affected if the manufacturing procedures are not strictly controlled. Against this background, WHO and IUATLD issued a joint statement in 1994 advising that only FDC tablets of good quality and proven bioavailability of rifampicin should be used in the treatment of tuberculosis (Anonymous; 1994; Tuber. Lung Dis.; 75: 180-181). There are several forthcoming articles in a special supplement of the International Journal of Tuberculosis and Lung disease devoted to the quality assurance of FDC tablets. These include a simplified protocol for assessing rifampicin bioavailability and its use in studies carried out in South Africa and India (Ellard, G.A.; 1999; Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis.; Nov 3; 11; Suppl. 3 : S284-5; Mclleron, H. et al.; 1999; Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis. 1999; Supplement; in preparation;<br>
Panchagnula, R. et al.; 1999; Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis.; Supplement; in preparation), high performance liquid chromatographic methods for assaying of rifampicin, isoniazid and Pyrazinamide (Smith, P. et al.; 1999; Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis.; Supplement; in preparation) procedures for ensuring laboratory proficiency for rifampicin bioavailability studies (Ellard, G.A.; 1999; Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis.; Supplement; in preparation) improved procedure of dissolution testing of rifampicin in presence of isoniazid (Shishoo, C.J. et al.; 1999; Int. J. Pharm.; Nov 10; 190 (1) : 109-23) and a review of the pharmacology of rifampicin (Ellard, G.A. et al.; 1999; Int. J. Tuberc. Lung Dis.; Nov 3; 11 Suppl 3;S301-8:S317-21).<br>
It has been reported that the poor absorption of rifampicin from combination products may be due to decomposition of the drug in acidic stomach conditions, which is accelerated in the presence of isoniazid (Shishoo, C.J. et al.; 1999; Int. J. Pharm.; Nov 10; 190 (1): 109-23; Singh, S. et al ; 2000 ; Pharm. Pharmacol.Commun: 6 : 491-494). The mechanism of this degradation was proposed by Singh et al.(Singh, S. et al.2000: Pharm. Pharmacol. Commun.:_6_: 405-410). Studies revealed that the decomposition of rifampicin in acidic conditions in the absence of isoniazid stopped at the formation of 3-formylrifamycin, while the reaction in the presence of isoniazid proceeded to form a hydrazone between 3-formylrifamycin and isoniazid. Further, it was suggested that once 3-formylifamycin is formed, it interacts with isoniazid to form the hydrazone, though a fast second order reaction. As hydrazone are unstable in acid conditions, 3-formylrifamycin and isoniazid are regenerated in a reversible manner through a slower first order reaction. In this complex reaction process rifampicin is further degraded, while isoniazid is recovered.<br>
Devani et al. (Devani, M.B. et al.; 1985; J. Pharm. Sci.; 74 : 427-432), has also discussed kinetics of hydrazone formulation from isoniazid in presence of reducing sugars.<br>
None of the reports has suggested a pharmaceutical technological solution to the above problem. The inventors after careful experimentation and expenditure of considerable amount of mental faculties and time have found a novel way to solve the bioavailability problems of drugs in FDC tablets.<br>
The invention described herein discloses compositions of anti-tubercular drugs where attempts have been made to prevent the loss in bioavailability of rifampicin in presence of isoniazid.<br>
During experimentation the inventors have found that the degradation of rifampicin is pH dependent in presence of isoniazid. At pH around 1 the degradation is minimum and increases abruptly as pH ranges between 2 and 3. Thereafter, above pH 3 the degradation is minimal.<br>
The pH of the gastric contents is normally between 1 and 3 which results in significant degradation of Rifampicin when administered orally alongwith other anti-tubercular agents, in particular Isoniazid.<br>
This problem has been solved by controlling the release or dissolution of both the drugs in such a way that the release takes place at different locations inside the gastrointestinal tract without compromising the total bioavailability of either of the drugs. It means that the two drugs i.e. rifampicin and isoniazid do not come in contact with each other in solution state in the gastrointestinal tract thereby preventing the interaction. The composition may also include other known anti-tubercular drugs like Ethambutol Hydrochloride and Pyrazinamide.<br>
The site-specific release of active ingredients has been achieved by various techniques like<br>
a)	Controlling release of rifampicin and isoniazid at different locations in the<br>
gastrointestinal tract by use of pH sensitive materials<br>
b)	Controlling dissolution of drugs by forming barrier coat and/or matrix with pH<br>
insensitive materials such that the contact of rifampicin and isoniazid in<br>
solution state is avoided.<br>
c)	Using different crystal forms of the drugs such that there is significant<br>
difference in dissolution rate of the drugs.<br>
d)	Modifying the surfactant action of rifampicin with use of materials like<br>
Methylpolysiloxane, natural and synthetic oils. Use of such materials reduces<br>
the surfactant action with corresponding reduction in solubility of rifampicin.<br><br>
Preferably the drug is modified such that the release takes place at pH of approximately 5.0. At pH 5.0 the drug release takes place very rapidly such that there is no loss of bioavailability. Whereas the other drug or drugs are released In the more acidic (pH 1.0 - 3.0) environment of stomach.<br>
Further, the invention discloses the Fixed Dose Combination of anti-tuberculosis drugs in oral suspension form. Suspension type dosage forms are of particular importance for fixed dose combination where the total amount of active ingredients of a single dose becomes very high. Such high doses cannot be filled into hard or soft gelatin capsules. Even compressed tablets become too big and are very difficult to swallow.<br>
It has surprisingly been found in the present invention that it is possible to conveniently administer such high dose combinations of anti-tubercular drugs wherein one or more active ingredients may be present in extended or delayed release form, in the form of oral suspension leading to no loss of bioavailability of any of the actives. This has been achieved by making molecular dispersion of Rifampicin and/or isoniazid having pH dependent delayed release characteristics even when finely powdered. Such powders can be blended with other drugs and compressed into tablets or made into suspensions alongwith the other drugs. Another advantage is minimal increase in size of tablets which is serious problem for high dose drugs.<br>
Further, the active ingredients may be in taste masked form. Such dosage forms will be highly desirable for treatment of tuberculosis in masses and reduction in the development of drug resistance which commonly occurs due to non compliance of existing type of dosage forms.<br>
The active ingredients may be having barrier coating to prevent drug -drug/excipients interactions.<br>
The suspension may be in ready-to-use form or to be reconstituted before use. Preferably the ready-to-use suspensions will have non-aqueous base/carrier. Suitable example of suspension bases include glycols and glycol derivatives;<br><br>
Propylene carbonate; glycerol; oils of animal, vegetable or mineral origin; medium chain triglycerides; transesterification products of natural vegetable oils with alkylene polyols; Esters of polyols with fatty acids.<br>
Other ingredients of the suspension dosage form includes suspending agents, viscosity imparting agents, anti-caking agents, sweeteners, flavors, coloring agents and the like, known to persons skilled in the art.<br>
The polymers used to modify the release of drugs may be natural, semi-synthetic,<br>
synthetic or man-modified. Suitable materials include cellulose and ceiluiose<br>
derivatives like microcrystalline cellulose, methyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose,<br>
hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, cellulose acetate phthalate,<br>
cellulose acetate, cellulose acetate butyrate, cellulose acetate propionate, cellulose<br>

Buffers like sodium dihydrogen orthophosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, di-potasium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate, borate buffer, phthalate buffer, oxalate buffer and the like.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the active ingredient may be present in micronized form to achieve faster absorption. Micronisation may be carried out by processes like air jet milling, ball mill and the like. The average particle size should be less than 5 microns.<br>
Further the invention also discloses use of bioavailability enhancers like pipertne and its derivatives, Ayurvedic preparations tike trikatu alongwith the compositions of present invention may also help in increasing bioavailability.<br>
