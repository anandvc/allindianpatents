				<td>Title: Manually operated respiration apparatus and balloon unit and valve<br>
housing for a manually operated respiration apparatus<br>
The invetion relates to a manually operated respiration apparatus.<br>
and to a balloon unit and to a valve housing for a manually operated<br>
respiration apparatus.<br>
Manually operated respiration apparatuses are known from practice<br>
and usually comprise a respiration housing, provided with a respiration<br>
channel for connection with a patient to whom artificial respiration is to be<br>
applied,which respiration channel is connected via a valve system in the<br>
respiration housi ig with an. inflow port which is connected to a balloon unit<br>
for supplying air to the patient via the respiration channel, and which is<br>
further connectec with an outflow port opening into the environment for<br>
evacuating air exhaled by the patient via the respiration channel to the<br>
environment. Here, the balloon unit comprises a resilient bellows provided<br>
with an inlet opening and an outlet opening, with a non-return valve being<br>
included in the inlet opening and with the outlet opening being connected to<br>
the inflow port of the respiration housing, all this such that, upon squeezing<br>
the bellows from a starting position, air enclosed by the bellows exits via the<br>
outlet opening and that, upon releasing the bellows, it rebounds to the<br>
starting position by sucking in environmental air via the inlet opening.<br>
Such a manually operated respiration apparatus is known to a skilled<br>
person by the name of resuscitator and is used for manually applying<br>
artificial respiration to persons or animals, for instance during reanimation.<br>
Such a respiration apparatus has a simple construction and can easily be<br>
transported. Further, the apparatus has a high reliability, while a minimum<br>
of maintenance is required.<br><br>
A drawback of the known respiration apparatus is that, thereby, the<br>
volume of the lungs of the patient can be increased too much, so that the<br>
lungs stretch too for. Such an overstretching of the lung leads to damage<br>
and dying off of lang cells, so that the oxygen transfer capacity of the lungs<br>
decreases. Although, after a few weeks, the lung cells have regenerated<br>
again and the oxygen transfer capacity is restored again, precisely the<br>
temporary decrease of the oxygen transfer capacity of the lungs can inflict<br>
great damage to the patient and even cause death of the patient.<br>
In order to obviate this drawback, it has already been proposed to<br>
include an overpressure protection in the respiration housing to limit the<br>
pressure of the air supplied via the respiration channel at a predetermined<br>
value.<br>
However, it has been found in practice that, despite this overpressure<br>
protection, overstretching of the lung is still caused during artificial<br>
respiration.<br>
The invention contemplates a manually operated respiration<br>
apparatus of the type referred to in the introduction, by means of which<br>
these drawbacks can be prevented while preserving the advantages.<br>
For this purpose, the respiration apparatus according to the invention<br>
is characterized in that the balloon unit is further provided with an<br>
overpressure protection for evacuating air from the bellows to the<br>
environment when a predetermined pressure of the air in the bellows is<br>
exceeded.<br>
It has been found that, in this manner, lung damage can be prevev.ted<br>
in practice. The invention resides in the insight that, during the bustle of<br>
the reanimation a nd/or in case of use by less expert or untrained staff, the<br>
bellows can sometimes be squeezed too forcefully, so that a great pressure<br>
wave may be created which can insufficiently rapidly be evacuated via the<br>
overpressure protection included in the respiration housing, so that a<br>
considerable part of the pressure wave is suitable to propagate via the<br><br>
respiration housing into the lungs of the pattern.. Particularly with a<br>
diseased or damaged lung in which the active volume is limited, this may<br>
result in severe damage- By providing the balloon unit with an overpressure<br>
protection, a rapid reduction of the pressure wave can be made possible, so<br>
that the pressure wave is prevented from reaching the lungs of the patient<br>
via the respiration housing and the respiration channel.<br>
The balloon unit, particularly the bellows, ia a suitable mounting<br>
place for such an overpressure protection, since, on or to the balloon,<br>
relatively much space is available for a relatively large outflow area of the<br>
overpressure protaction, so that the flow resistance of the overpressure<br>
protection can be relatively low. Here, the overpressure protection may, for<br>
instance, be provided on the body of the bellows, but may also be provided in<br>
or to the inlet or cutlet opening thereof.<br>
By including an overpressure protection in the inlet opening, it is<br>
thus achieved that the overpressure protection can have a relatively large<br>
outflow area. Also, by inclusion in the inlet opening, it is achieved that the<br>
balloon unit of an already existing respiration apparatus - which is<br>
optionally provided with an overpressure protection in the respiration<br>
housing - can be equipped with a reliable overpressure protection in a<br>
simple manner. Further, this place is the most comfortable both for the<br>
operator of the balloon and for the patient.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment, in the inlet opening of the bellows,<br>
a substantially cylindrical valve housing is included in which the non-return<br>
valve and the overpressure protection are accommodated. The non-return<br>
valve and the overpressure protection are preferably integrated, but may<br>
also form separate parts. The overpressure protection may, for instance, be<br>
designed as a spring-loaded valve. It is noted that the non-return valve and<br>
the overpressure protection, may be integrated into one part, but that they<br>
may also be separate parts.<br><br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the cylindrical valve housing<br>
is, on an end face, provided with one or more suction openings and. on a part<br>
of the cylinder jacket located near the end face, provided with one or move<br>
blow-off openings. In this manner, it is achieved that, on its end face, the<br>
valve bousing can be coupled with, for instance, an oxygen bag, while the<br>
blow-off openings remain clear.<br>
In an advantageous manner, the cylindrical valve housing may be<br>
provided with a clamp for airtight clamping of the circumferential edge of<br>
the inlet opening.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for manually applying<br>
artificial respiration to a patient.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments of the invention, are shown in the<br>
subclaims.<br>
The invention will be further elucidated on the basis of exemplary<br>
embodiments which are shown in a drawing, in which:<br>

respiration apparatus;<br>

The drawirgs are only diagrammatic views of preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention which are provided by way of non-limiting exemplary<br><br>
embodiments. ID. the drawings, same or corresponding parts are designated<br>
by the same referenee nvmerals.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a manually operated respiration apparatus 1.<br>
comprising a respiration housing 2 and a balloon, unit 3 connected thereto<br>
The respiration housing 2, which is shown in detail in Fig. 2, is provided<br>
with a respiration channel 4 which is connected via a valve system 5 with<br>
an inflow port 6 connected to the balloon unit 3 for supplying air to the<br>
patient via the respiration channel 4. The respiration channel 4 is further<br>
connected via the valve system 5 with one or more outflow ports 7 for<br>
evacuating the an exhaled by the patient into the respiration channel to the<br>
environment. The respiration channel 4 is, by its free end. connected with a<br>
mask (not shown) which is, during use, placed over the mouth and nose of<br>
the patient to whom artificial respiration, is to be applied, or with a tube<br>
(not shown either; placed in the respiratory tract for artificial respiration.<br>
The balloor unit 3 comprises a resilient bellows 10 provided with an<br>
inlet opening 8 and an outlet opening 9. The resilient bellows 10 may, for<br>
instance, be designed as an airtight wall from flexible material, for instance<br>
plastic, which is supported by resilient, arched ribs. The resilient bellows 1.0<br>
may also be formed in a different manner, for instance as a hollow,<br>
somewhat elongated ball with relatively thick walls from rubberlike<br>
material. Such a balloon unit is known to a skilled person as a balloon unit<br>
of the self-inflating type and will not be further elucidated here.<br>
In the inlet opening 8 of the bellows 10, a non-return valve 11 is<br>
included in a manner which will be further elucidated hereinbelow. The<br>
outlet opening 9 of the bellows 10 is connected with the inflow port 6 of the<br>
respiration housing 2. Upon squeezing the bellows 10 from the starting<br>
position shown in Fig. 1, air enclosed by the bellows exits via the outlet<br>
opening 9. With reference to Fig. 2, the exiting air enters the inflow port 6 of<br>
the respiration be using 2 and flows via non-return valve 12 of the valve<br>
System 5 into the respiration channel 4. The valve body simultaneously<br><br>
closes off outflow ports 7. Via the respiration channel 4 and the mask, the<br>
air is supplied via nose and mouth to the lungs of the patient. Upon<br>
releasing the bello ws 10. the bellows rebounds to the starting position<br>
shown in Fig. 1 by sucking in environmental air via the non-return valve 1.1<br>
provided in the in et opening 8. Thereby, the non-return valve 12 in the<br>
respiration housing 2 slams shut.<br>
With reference to Fig. 2. during and alter the rebound of the resilient<br>
bellows 10, the patients will exhale air into the respiration channel 4. By air<br>
exhaled into the respiration channel 4 and/or by action of spring 14 the<br>
valve body 13 of valve system 5 will get off its seating 15 to the position<br>
shown in Fig. 2 in which the exhaled air can be evacuated to the<br>
• environment via the outflow ports 7 of the respiration housing 9.<br>
The respiration housing 2 may optionally be provided with an<br>
overpressure prot sction for evacuating air to the environment when a<br>
predetermined pressure value in the respiration housing is exceeded. In this<br>
exemplary embodiment, the overpressure protection is designed as a<br>
spring-loaded valve 16 in the wall of a chamber 17 № the respiration<br>
housing 2, which chamber connects to the inflow port 6. Given an elevate i<br>
pressure, the valve body of the overpressure protection 16 is pressed from its<br>
seating 19 agaias; the action of the spring, so that the air can pass the wall<br>
of the chamber 17 and can be evacuated to the environment. Given an<br>
overpressure, the air can thus pass the overpressure protection 16 and be<br>
evacuated to the environment via outflow ports 7A. The construction of the<br>
respiration bousing for a respiration apparatus is well enough known to a<br>
skilled person and will not be further elucidated here.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, in the intet opening 8 of the bellows 10, an<br>
overpressure protection 19 is mcluded for evacuating air frora the bellows<br>
via the inlet opening 8 when a predetermined pressure value is exceeded<br>
The overpressure protection induded in the inlet opeinng comes into action<br>
when, as a reult of squeezing the balloon too forcefully, the pressure in the<br><br>
balloon exceeds a predetermined value. By placement in the inlet opening 8,<br>
the pressure wave may be prevented from moving via the respiration<br>
housing 2 and the respiration channel 4 into the lungs of the patient<br>
With refere ice to Fig. 3, it is shown therein that, in the inlet<br>
opening 8 of the bellows 10, a substantially cylindrical valve housing 20 v<br>
included in which the non-return valve 11 and the overpressure<br>
protection 19 are integrated.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3, the valve housing 20 is provided<br>
with a central passageway 21 extending from a suction opening 23 provided<br>
in the and face 22 of the valve housing 20 to the interior of the bellows 10<br>
In the cential passageway 21, a valve body 24 is included which is<br>
pressed against a seating 26 by action of a spring 25. The valve body 24,<br>
spring 25 and seasing 26 together form the overpressure protection 19<br>
which, during normal use prevents outflow of gas from the balloon via the<br>
inlet opening 8. Given an overpressure caused by squeezing the bellows too<br>
forcefully, for instance given a pressure in the bellows of 60 cm water<br>
column, the valve body 24 will get off its seating 26 against the action of the<br>
spring 25, so that air from the bellows can flow out to the environment via<br>
outflow openings :28 provided in the jacket surface 27 of the valve<br>
housing 20, near the end face 22.<br>
In the valve body 24, passage openings 29 are provided which are<br>
sealed on a side of the valve body 24 facing the bellows by means of a<br>
flexible valve body 30. The passage openings 29 and the flexible valve<br>
body 30 form a non-return valve 12 which prevents exiting of air from the<br>
bellows during squeezing. but which allows inflow of air from the<br>
environment to the interior of the bellows during the rebound.<br>
The valve housing 20 is provided with clamping means 31 for airtight<br>
clamping of the circumferential edge of the inlet opening 8 of the bellows 10.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Fig. 3. the clamping means are formed by a<br>
supporting flange 31A provided on the valve housing 20, which cooperates<br><br>
with a pressure flange 31B of a screw ring 32 which is attached on the<br>
jacket 27 of the valve housing 20 by means of screw thread 33.<br>
With reference to Fig. 4. a second embodiment of the valve housing 20<br>
is shown therein, .n which the valve body 24 has an annular design and is<br>
located in a blow-off channel 34 arranged around the central<br>
passageway 21. Here, the suction opening 23 has a cylindrical design and<br>
the blow-off channel 34 is arranged annularly around it. Here, the<br>
passageway 21 extends somewhat outwardly with respect to the end face 22,<br>
so that, the suction opening 23 is located outside the end face 22. In this<br>
manner, the inflow opening can easily be connected to a bag. Via the bag,<br>
enriched air can be supplied to the balloon, for instance air with extra<br>
oxygen and/or a small amount of narcotic, such as laughing gas for relief<br>
Then, besides air, enrichment gas can likewise be continuously supplied to<br>
the bag from a gas cylinder with a relatively low flow rate, for instance<br>
0-15 liters per minute.<br>
Optionally, as shown in Fig. 5. an ove;rpressure protection 35 may be<br>
provided in the will of the central passageway 21 so that, when the<br>
pressure in the oxygen bag exceeds a predetermined value, oxygen can<br>
directly be evacuated to the blow-off channel 34. An example of such an<br>
overpressure protection is a duckbill valve 36 in the shape of a ring which<br>
clears passage openings 37 in the wall of the passageway given a pressure of<br>
approx 15 cm water column in the oxygen bag. For the record, it is noted<br>
that, when the respiration apparatus is coupled with an oxygen bag, the<br>
term air is to bo interpreted to mean oxygen in this context,<br>
Fig. 6 shows a variant of the valve housing where the predetermined<br>
pressure value of the overpressure protection is settable. In this variant, the<br>
pressure value of the overpressure protection is settable between a pressure<br>
of approx 20 cm vater column and a pressure of approx 60 cm water<br>
column. Of course, for less common applications of manual artificial<br>
respiration, an overpressure protection with a higher maximum pressure<br><br>
may be possible, for instance an overpressure protection with a setting<br>
range up to approx 80 or 120 cm water column.<br>
Here, the settable overpressure protection is designed with a setting<br>
element designed with a rotatable part 40 of the housing of the valve<br>
housing. The rotaible part 40 is connected with a stationary part 43 of the<br>
valve housing via a. screw thread connection 42.<br>
Via the screw thread connection 42, the rotatable pan: 40 of the valve<br>
housing 20 is rotaable over an angle range of approx 270° with respect to<br>
the stationary part 43 of the valve housing. For obtaining a simple.,<br>
unambiguous operation, the angle range is less than approx 360°, and is<br>
preferably between approx 90° and 360º. In this manner, the whole setting<br>
range can be traversed with a turn of the wrist, while further, with each<br>
angular position, exactly one pressure value corresponds. For the purpose of<br>
a stable construct on, the jacket 45 of the rotatable part 40 is included in an<br>
annular guide 46.<br>
Preferably, further, the closing pressure exerted on the valve body 24<br>
by means of spring 25 can be set linearly. By using a screw thread 42 with<br>
variable pitch, the spring 25 can have a non-linear design, while a linear<br>
setting characteristic is still obtained across the angle range.<br>
In an advantageous manner, the end face 44 of the rotatable part 40<br>
of the valve housing may be graduated for re ading the set value of the<br>
overpressure protection on the basis of the relative angular position<br>
between the adjustable part of the valve housing 40 with respect to the<br>
stationary part 40. For this purpose, for instance an annular graduation<br>
may be represented on the part of the end face 44 surrounding the<br>
stationary part 43 of the valve housing, while a reference line is provided on<br>
the end face of this screw ring 32 and/or the end face of the stationary<br>
part 43. The settable overpressure protection may of course also be applied<br>
to other variants of the valve housing.<br><br>
With refere ice to Ftg. 7, it is shown that the rotatable part. 40 of the<br>
housing of the valve housing is provided with a control button 41 to<br>
facilitate the engaging.<br>
Optionally, the suction channel 23 surrounded by the stationary<br>
part 43 of the vahe housing may also be provided with a protective cap with<br>
passage openings, for instance a protective grid.<br>
With the ai i of the settable overpressure protection, the air present<br>
in the bellows can thus be blown off via a. settable barrier in or to the<br>
bellows. It will be clear that the settable overpressure protection may<br>
further be designed in many different manners than the preferred<br>
embodiment described hereinabove. For instance, a settable overpressure<br>
protection may be realized with the aid of a slidable stop or an adjustable<br>
clamp and the adjustment can be carried out either continuously or<br>
discontinuously. further, if desired, the predetermined pressure value may-<br>
be non-linearly settable across the setting range.<br>
It will further be clear that such a settable overpressure protection in<br>
itself can already be advantageously applied in conventional manually<br>
operated respiration apparatuses, in other words, a respiratiox. apparatus in<br>
which the overpressure protection is not provided in or to the balloon unit.<br>
Such a manually operated respiration apparatus then comprises a<br>
respiration housing, provided with a respiration channel for connection with<br>
a patient to whoir. artificial respiration is to be applied, which respiration<br>
channel is connected via a valve system with an inflow port connected to a<br>
balloon unit for supplying air to the patient via the respiration channel and<br>
with one or more outflow ports for evacuating air exhaled by the patient into<br>
the respiration channel to the environment, while the balloon unit<br>
comprises a resilient bellows provided with an inlet opening and an outlet<br>
opening, while, further, in the inlet opening of the bellows, a non-return<br>
valve is included and while the outlet opening of the bellows is connected<br>
with the inflow port of the respiration housing, and while the respiration<br><br>
apparatus is provided with an overpressure protection for evacuating air<br>
from the respiration apparatus when a predetermined pressure value is<br>
exceeded, with the predetermined pressure value of the overpressure<br>
protection being sottable.<br>
It will be clear that the invention is not. limited to the preferred<br>
exemplary embodiments shown herein, but that many variations are<br>
possible. For instance, the overpressure protections may be designed as<br>
overpressure protections with a settable initial value. Further, the<br>
overpressure protection, may be integrated in the inlet opening with the<br>
non-return valve, for instance by designing a flexible valve body of a<br>
non-return valve such that it will leak in case of overpressure. Such<br>
variants will be char to a skilled person and are understood to be within he<br>
scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.<br><br>
