				<td>Blade and tie-rod assembly for gangsaw for the sawing of<br>
stone material<br>
The present invention relates to blade and tie-rod<br>
assembly for gangsaw for the sawing of stone material, in<br>
particular blocks of stone material for the production of<br>
rough slabs which must undergo subsequent finishing<br>
operations.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to<br>
assembly and fixing of the sawing blades to the supports or<br>
tie-rods used for fastening to the gangsaw.<br>
For many years now the sawing of hard stone materials<br>
has been performed using machines comprising essentially a<br>
structure formed by four angular columns having, mounted<br>
thereon, oscillating-arm units which are movable vertically<br>
along the columns and which have, pivotably mounted at<br>
their bottom ends, a horizontal blade-carrying frame. The<br>
latter, which supports a plurality of parallel and spaced<br>
cutting blades, is imparted a to-and-fro oscillating<br>
movement such that it is obliged to perform oscillating<br>
strokes with respect to the axes - likewise horizontal -<br>
for pivotably mounting the frame on the oscillating-arm<br>
units.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a blade and<br>
tie-rod assembly for gangsaw for the sawing of stone<br>
material, comprising a blade carrying frame and a plurality<br>
of blades mounted to the frame, each blade having the<br>
function of keeping into contact and pressing abrasive<br>
elements against the groove formed in the surface of the<br>
stone material being sawn, each blade being fixed to two<br>
opposite sides of the frame by means of coupling means or<br>
tie-rods called respectively "connecting-rod side tie-rod"<br>
and "tensioning side tie-rod", the latter also functioning<br>
as tensioning elements so as to keep the blade at a<br>
predefined tension by means of sets of oil pistons being<br>
mounted so that each piston acts on the related "tensioning<br>
side tie-rod" of each blade, each tie-rod having its outer<br>
end fixed in a known manner to said frame and its other end<br>
fastened to the end of the blade by means of a pin passing<br>
through concentric holes formed in the superimposed parts<br>
of said blade and said tie-rod, wherein said blade and tie-<br>
rod assembly comprises<br>
- at each end of each blade, only one pin for fastening<br>
to the related tie-rod,<br>
- said pin and said holes having corresponding non-<br>
circular shape and being coaxially arranged to permit<br>
insertion of said pin within the hole(s).<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show a side view and a partially<br>
sectioned view, at right angles to the first view, of an<br>
example of a sawing machine (more precisely the model<br>
"Alcione" which is manufactured and marketed by the company<br>
Barsanti Macchine S.p.A.).<br>
As can be seen from the two abovementioned<br>
figures, the machine consists of four vertical columns<br>
10 on which a carriage 12 is mounted, said carriage,<br>
during sawing, as the cutting depth increases, being<br>
displaced vertically along the columns in a controlled<br>
manner and over a desired distance. The carriage 12<br>
has, pivotably mounted thereon, two arms 14 carrying at<br>
the bottom a blade-carrying frame 16 performing the<br>
aforementioned oscillating movement in the direction<br>
indicated by the double arrow F.<br>
The oscillating movement is produced by a<br>
connecting-rod and crank mechanism (Fig. 1 show's the<br>
connecting rod 18 which is operated by means of a<br>
motorized flywheel 20 actuated by an electric drive<br>
system).<br>
Since these are machines which have been well-<br>
known in the art for several decades, further details<br>
are not required.<br>
Each blade-carrying frame, which has a<br>
substantially rectangular shape, is formed, on two<br>
opposite sides,' by two sections or plates 22 having,<br>
mounted between them, a plurality of sawing blades<br>
which are made of ferrous material (normally varying<br>
from 100 to 200 in number) and mounted, parallel to<br>
each other and in an adjustable manner, at a variable<br>
mutual distance of between a few millimetres and a few<br>
centimetres: each blade is fixed to the two opposite<br>
sides of the frame by means of coupling elements or<br>
tie-rods, called respectively "connecting-rod side tie-<br>
rod" and "tensioning side tie-rod"; the latter also<br>
function as tensioning elements so as to.keep the blade<br>
at a predefined tension. For this purpose usually sets<br>
of oil pistons are used, being mounted so that each<br>
piston acts on the "tensioning side tie-rod" of a<br>
blade, so that the latter is tensioned with a<br>
predetermined force.<br>
An example of an arrangement of oil pistons for<br>
tensioning the blades is described and illustrated in<br>
Italian patent No. 1,263,312.<br>
Usually, in order to tension the blades, a tensile<br>
force of various tonnes, in particular in the region of<br>
7-8 tonnes, is applied.<br>
The abovementioned blades in reality do not have a<br>
cutting edge, but, depending on the type of sawing<br>
blade (grit frames and diamond frames), have the<br>
function of keeping in contact and pressing abrasive<br>
elements (such as an aqueous suspension containing lime<br>
and abrasive' particles in the former case) against the<br>
groove formed in the surface of the material to be<br>
sawn.<br>
In the case of diamond frames the blade has, fixed<br>
thereto, diamond-coated inserts consisting of sintered<br>
blocks of highly abrasive material.<br>
As each groove formed in the surface of the block<br>
to be sawn deepens, the blade-carrying frame, as<br>
already mentioned, is lowered along the columns<br>
(descent): depending on the nature and in particular<br>
the hardness of the stone material forming the block to<br>
be sawn into slabs, the lowering speed varies from 2 to<br>
8 cm/hour, so that sawing of an entire block, usually<br>
having a height of 1.5 - 2 metres, involves many hours<br>
of machining.<br>
The blades, during the sawing operation, become<br>
worn and wear of the blades occurs within a relatively<br>
short amount of time (usually a blade wears to the<br>
point that it needs to be replaced, within the space of<br>
one or two sawing cycles) , such that replacement<br>
thereof with new blades must be performed frequently:<br>
if it is considered that each blade has a length in the<br>
region of 3 to 5 metres and that each time from 100 to<br>
200 blades must be disassembled and replaced with the<br>
same number of new blades (each of which must also be<br>
tensioned), it is obvious that this operation results<br>
in a considerable amount of downtime which obviously<br>
affects the productivity and consequently the<br>
profitability of the industrial process in question.<br>
Hitherto attempts have been made to simplify as<br>
far as possible the methods used for coupling the<br>
blades to the frame and thus fixing them to the<br>
aforementioned tie-rods, so that universally a first<br>
end of each blade is seated inside a bracket, forming<br>
the end of the tie-rod, and is secured inside the<br>
bracket by means of a cross-pin which engages inside<br>
holes aligned axially and formed in the terminal<br>
portion of the blade and in the two flanges of the end<br>
bracket between which said blade end is inserted.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 of the accompanying drawings show<br>
a detail of the system for fastening the end of the<br>
blade to the connecting-rod side tie-rod (Fig. 3) and<br>
tensioning side tie-rod (Fig. 4).<br>
These figures show a blade portion 24 which, at<br>
its ends, is fixed to the end of the tie-rod denoted by<br>
26 (connecting-rod side tie-rod) and 28 (tensioning<br>
side tie-rod). These figures also show schematically<br>
fixing together thereof by means of the cylindrical pin<br>
30."<br>
Fig. 5 shows, schematically also in this case, but<br>
on a larger scale, the already mentioned system for<br>
fixing together tie-rod 26 and blade 24, an identical<br>
system also being used for fixing the end of the blade<br>
24 and the tie-rod 28.<br>
The end of the tie-rod 26 is shaped in the manner<br>
of a bracket comprising two flanges 23 forming a seat<br>
for the end of the blade 24. The cylindrical pin 30 is<br>
inserted into the holes 31 which are axially aligned<br>
and formed in the two flanges 23' and in the terminal<br>
portion of the blade 24.<br>
In Fig. 4 it can also be seen how a locking wedge<br>
32 is provided in the region of the tie-rod 28, being<br>
inserted between the outer end of the tie-rod and the<br>
perimetral structure of the blade-carrying frame.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show again, but in schematic form,<br>
a tie-rod/blade/tie-rod assembly according to the known<br>
art in the situation where the blade is new (Fig. 6)<br>
and the blade is worn (Fig. 7) .<br>
In fact, as already mentioned, the sawing blades<br>
wear rapidly: however, their wear, precisely owing to<br>
the abovementioned oscillating movement of the sawing<br>
frame, has a very particular progression, as shown in<br>
Fig. 7, in which it is possible appreciate in<br>
qualitative terms the condition of a blade and in<br>
particular its bottom edge 25 (its "cutting" edge in<br>
the sense of the edge engaged with the groove which is<br>
formed in the block being sawn) after one or two sawing<br>
cycles, namely with considerable wear of material in<br>
the central portion of the blade.<br>
This condition, as the blade become worn, is<br>
accentuated since the tensile forces applied to the two<br>
ends of the blade (which are equivalent to about 7-8<br>
tonnes) and which initially are distributed over the<br>
whole height of the blade, are instead transmitted<br>
solely to the upper portion of the blade, so that the<br>
latter not only is not perfectly tensioned, but also<br>
tends to rotate about the two pins used for fixing to<br>
the two end tie-rods and the wear of the central<br>
portion of the blade is consequently increased.<br>
This progression in the wear of the blades also<br>
has consequences on the characteristics and quality of<br>
the slabs resulting from sawing of the block: in fact,<br>
when the blade is worn, each slab has:<br>
(a) opposite surfaces with a marked roughness,<br>
making the subsequent slab finishing operations<br>
(calibrating honing and polishing) more difficult;<br>
(b) a surface which is not perfectly flat; and<br>
(c) a pronounced concavity in the central portion<br>
of the cut slab.<br>
Special mention needs to be made of the dimensions<br>
of the blades in terms of both height and thickness.<br>
The blades used hitherto (except in special cases)<br>
have a maximum height of 110 mm and a thickness of not<br>
less than 4.2 mm.<br>
These values are determined by requirements<br>
relating to strength and quality of the cut performed.<br>
In fact blades with a height greater than 110 mm,<br>
taking into account their length which on average is<br>
about 4 metres or more, would tend to deviate, along<br>
their edges and therefore their bottom edge (i.e. the<br>
edge which engages with the cutting groove), from a<br>
perfectly straight condition, with negative effects on<br>
the characteristics of the resultant cut slabs.<br>
As regards instead the thickness, blades with<br>
thicknesses smaller than that indicated above tend to<br>
buckle in the sense that the top and bottom edges curve<br>
inwards with a concavity directed upwards.<br>
In this case also this deformation is to the<br>
detriment of the quality of the cut slabs and in any case<br>
of the cutting speed.<br>
With the blades known hitherto it is possible to<br>
perform two cutting cycles since the wear of the blades<br>
after two cutting cycles is such that the residual blade<br>
height (in the central portion and symmetrically with<br>
respect thereto) is reduced to about 38-40 mm, which is not<br>
sufficient for completion of a third cutting cycle.<br>
On the other hand, replacement of the blades performed<br>
not at the end of a cutting cycle, but during an<br>
intermediate stage thereof, results in problems and<br>
drawbacks not only as regards extraction of the blades from<br>
the grooves formed in the block, but also in respect of<br>
reinsertion of the set of new blades in the previously<br>
formed grooves.<br>
It is obvious that if it were possible to increase the<br>
height of the blade without the drawbacks mentioned above,<br>
each blade could be used for a greater number of cycles.<br>
Equally well, if it were possible, for the same<br>
performance, to reduce the thickness of the blades, this<br>
would mean an increase in the number of blades which can be<br>
used for each sawing cycle.<br>
All these considerations show how an improvement in<br>
fixing of the blades to the blade-carrying frame as well as<br>
an increase in the height of the blade and a reduction in<br>
the thickness of the blade are of great interest<br>
industrially speaking and these improvements represent the<br>
main object of the present invention.<br>
It has now been found, according to<br>
the present invention, that substantial<br><br>
improvements, as regards rate of wear and hence<br>
duration of the sawing blades, cutting speed, more<br>
advantageous dimensions of the blades, and finally<br>
improvements of the slabs resulting from sawing, are<br>
achieved with a blade and tie-rod assembly for stone-<br>
material gangsaws, in which each tie-rod has its outer<br>
end fixed in a known manner to the frame and its other<br>
end fastened to the end of the blade by means of a pin<br>
passing through concentric holes formed in the<br>
superimposed parts of said blade and said tie-rod,<br>
characterized in that said holes have a non-circular<br>
shape and said pin has a shape suitable for engagement<br>
in said holes so as to prevent a relative rotation of<br>
tie-rod and blade about the axis of said holes.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, said pin has an oval shape so that said<br>
concentric holes also have a correspondingly oval-<br>
shaped form.<br>
It should be noted that the scope of the invention<br>
also extends to the two individual components of the<br>
assembly defined above, namely on the one hand the<br>
blade and on the other hand the tie-rod.<br>
The different aspects and advantages of the<br>
present invention will emerge more clearly from the<br>
detailed description which follows of a preferred<br>
embodiment provided with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings in which, in addition to the figures already<br>
mentioned, relating to solutions of the prior art and<br>
the problems associated therewith,<br>
Fig. 8 is a side view of a blade according to the<br>
present invention;<br>
Figs. 9 and 10 are views, similar to those of<br>
Figs. 3 and 4, but simplified, of the tie-rods<br>
according to the present invention on the connecting<br>
rod side and the tensioning side respectively;<br>
Fig. 11 is a view, similar to that of Fig. 5, of<br>
the tie-rod and blade assembly according to the present<br>
invention; and<br>
Figs. 12 a, b, c, d, e, f, g and h show a cross-<br>
sectional view of variations of embodiment of the pin<br>
for assembling the blade with the tie-rod.<br>
With reference to Figures 8 to 11, it is possible<br>
to appreciate readily the inventive aspect introduced<br>
with the present invention: the blade 24 is provided at<br>
its two ends with an eyelet hole 33 having a non-<br>
circular shape, suitable for receiving a pin 34 of<br>
corresponding shape, which also engages with an eyelet<br>
hole of corresponding shape 36 or 38 respectively<br>
formed in the end of the tie-rod to be coupled with<br>
the end of the blade.<br>
In order to facilitate comprehension of the<br>
present invention, in these figures parts corresponding<br>
to those in Figures 3 to 5 have been identified by the<br>
same reference numbers.<br>
Therefore, in this case also the blade 24 is<br>
fastened at its two ends to the tie-rods 26 and 28<br>
which, in the shaped bracket ends, have coaxial holes<br>
3.6 and 38 able to receive the pin 34 which, as can be<br>
easily appreciated, has a non-circular cross-section<br>
and in particular an oval or elliptical shape.<br>
It is therefore obvious that, with this coupling<br>
system, relative rotation of blade 24 and tie-rods 26<br>
and 28 is not possible.<br>
Fig. 11 shows how .in the preferred embodiment the<br>
end of the tie-rod, in this case the tie-rod 26 (but<br>
the same is also applicable to the tie-rod 28) is<br>
shaped in the form of a bracket having two parallel<br>
flanges 23, each of which is provided with the<br>
respective eyelet hole 36 intended to be arranged<br>
coaxially with the eyelet hole 33 formed in the end of<br>
the blade 24 so as to allow insertion, preferably with<br>
a slight forcing action, of the pin 34.<br>
It is nevertheless understood that the shaping of<br>
the end of the tie-rods in the form of a bracket<br>
provided with flanges is preferred, but not obligatory,<br>
since the desired technical effect is obtained owing to<br>
shaping of the eyelet holes 33 and 36 and 38,<br>
respectively, as well as the pin 34.<br>
Fig. 12 shows other possible embodiments of the<br>
pin 34 (identified by the reference numbers 34A-H<br>
respectively): it is obvious that in this case also the<br>
shape of the eyelet holes 33, 36 and 38 must be<br>
correspondingly modified.<br>
Sawing tests were carried out with the tie-rod and<br>
blade assemblies according to the present invention,<br>
mounting on a same blade-carrying frame blades and tie-<br>
rods according to the present invention and one or more<br>
sets of blades and tie-rods according to the prior art,<br>
i.e. of the type shown in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
The tests were carried out at a sawmill in<br>
Pietrasanta (Lucca, Italy), more precisely the sawmill<br>
Tirrenia, using a Barsanti gangsaw with interchangeable<br>
unit, performing the cutting of blocks of so-called<br>
"Nero Africa" granite, with a height of 145 cm, and<br>
using abrasive grit of the type Murga HG1, size 9.<br>
The blade-carrying frame was fitted with 31 blades<br>
according to the present invention, having dimensions<br>
of 4066 x 3.9 x 120 mm with an eyelet hole (51 x 20<br>
mm), and a blade which had the same dimensions, but in<br>
which the connection between blade and tie-rods was<br>
performed using circular pins with a diameter of 20 mm.<br>
The maximum speed of descent was 35 mm/h and the<br>
power consumption of the motor was 26 kW.<br>
The following tests were carried out:<br>
1) "Res 1": for checking the resistance of the<br>
hole to the tensile force of 8.5 tonnes (1 tonne more<br>
than the value normally used). The blade/tie-rod<br>
assemblies according to the present invention did not<br>
raised any problems.<br>
2) "Lin 2": for checking the curving effect of the<br>
blade (known technically as "buckling"), due to the<br>
tensile force which is applied centrally. In the case<br>
of the blade/tie-rod assemblies according to the<br>
present invention there was no curving, while a small<br>
of degree of curving was detectable in the conventional<br>
blade.<br>
3) "Con 1": for checking the degree of use or wear<br>
in the vertical direction. The vertical wear was the<br>
same both in the conventional blade and in the blade<br>
coupled to the tie-rod according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
4) "Sup 1": for checking the roughness of the cut<br>
surface. The surface of the slab obtained with the<br>
tie-rod/blade/tie-rod assembly of the present invention<br>
was smoother than that obtained with the tie-<br>
rod/blade/tie-rod assembly according to the prior art.<br>
5) "Sup 2": for checking the levelness of the cut<br>
slab. The vertical linearity of the slab cut with the<br>
blade and tie-rod assembly according to the present<br>
invention was good, while the slab cut with the<br>
blade/tie-rod assembly according to the prior art was<br>
bowed at the top, at about 60 cm from the start of the<br>
cut .<br>
The same tests were carried out cutting granite of<br>
the quality known as "Desert Brown".<br>
In this case also, advantageous results in terms<br>
of flatness of the cut slabs and lack of bowing were<br>
encountered.<br>
It is worth noting that, in the abovementioned<br>
tests in which the blade/tie-rod assembly according to<br>
the invention was that shown in Figures 8-10, the<br>
height of the blade was 120 mm, while the thickness was<br>
3.8 mm.<br>
In these conditions, instead of the usual two<br>
cycles, it was possible to perform three sawing cycles<br>
and moreover about 20 cm was recovered over the whole<br>
width of the blade-carrying frame, allowing a<br>
corresponding increase in the number of slabs cut<br>
during a single sawing cycle.<br>
The results of these experiments lead one to<br>
conclude that, with the blade and tie-rod assembly<br>
according to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
reduce the thickness of the blade to 3.5 or also 3 mm<br>
and at the same time increase the height of the blade<br>
to 130 mm or more.<br>
Obviously the choice of the height of the blade<br>
and the thickness are also dependent upon the<br>
characteristics of the stone material to be sawn; for<br>
example in the case of so-called "poor" granites the<br>
height of the blade must be reduced to 120 mm or less<br>
and the thickness must instead be increased, without<br>
varying obviously the main characteristic feature of<br>
the invention.<br>
Finally, a reduction or saving, in the region of<br>
10-15%, in the consumption of electric power needed for<br>
the oscillating movement of the blade-carrying frame<br>
was noted. If it is considered that the sawing of a<br>
block of 1.5 to 2 metres height requires on average a<br>
sawing cycle of about 70 hours, the savings in electric<br>
power which can be achieved is immediately obvious.<br>
Finally, during the above tests it was also found<br>
that it is possible to increase the speed of descent or<br>
lowering of the blade-carrying frame, which increase<br>
may be in the region of 0.5 cm/hour, with obvious<br>
advantages in industrial terms.<br>
Finally, it must be commented that the present<br>
invention may be used equally well in frames using so-<br>
called diamond blades, namely blades where the bottom<br>
edge has a plurality of diamond-coated inserts.<br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
1. Blade and tie-rod assembly for gangsaw for the sawing<br>
of stone material, comprising a blade carrying frame (16)<br>
and a plurality of blades mounted to the frame, each blade<br>
having the function of keeping into contact and pressing<br>
abrasive elements against the groove formed in the surface<br>
of the stone material being sawn, each blade (24) being<br>
fixed to two opposite sides of the frame (16) by means of<br>
coupling means or tie-rods (28, 26) called respectively<br>
"connecting-rod side tie-rod" and "tensioning side tie-<br>
rod", the latter also functioning as tensioning elements so<br>
as to keep the blade at a predefined tension by means of<br>
sets of oil pistons being mounted so that each piston acts<br>
on the related "tensioning side tie-rod" of each blade<br>
(24), each tie-rod having its outer end fixed in a known<br>
manner to said frame (16) and its other end fastened to the<br>
end of the blade (24) by means of a pin passing through<br>
concentric holes (33, 36, 38) formed in the superimposed<br>
parts of said blade (24) and said tie-rod (26, 28), wherein<br>
said blade and tie-rod assembly comprises<br>
- at each end of each blade (24), only one pin (34) for<br>
fastening to the related tie-rod (26, 28),<br>
- said pin (34) and said holes (33, 36, 38) having<br>
corresponding non-circular shape and being coaxially<br>
arranged to permit insertion of said pin (34) within the<br>
hole(s) (33, 36, 38).<br>
2. Blade and tie-rod assembly as claimed in claim 1,<br>
wherein said end of said tie-rod (26, 28) coupled to said<br>
blade end is U-shaped so as to receive said blade end<br>
between the flanges of said U, said concentric holes (33,<br>
36, 38) being formed in said two flanges and in the blade<br>
seated between them.<br>
3. Blade and tie-rod assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2,<br>
wherein said holes (33, 36, 38) and said pin (34) have an<br>
elliptical shape (34G, 34H).<br>
4. Blade and tie-rod assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2,<br>
wherein said holes (33, 36, 38) and said pin (34) have a<br>
prismatic shape (34A, 34B).<br>
5. Blade for sawing frames comprising a blade and tie-rod<br>
assembly as claimed in claim 1, wherein at the ends for<br>
coupling with the tie-rods of the frame it has fastening<br>
holes with a non cylindrical shape.<br>
6. Blade for sawing frames as claimed in claim 5, wherein<br>
said holes have an elliptical shape (34G, 34H).<br>
7. Blade for sawing frames as claimed in claim 5, wherein<br>
said holes have a prismatic shape (34A, 34B).<br>
8. Blade and tie-rod assembly as claimed in claim 1 or 2,<br>
wherein said blade (24) has a height of at least 120 mm and<br>
a thickness not greater than 4 mm.<br><br>
In a blade and tie-rod assembly for gangsaw for the<br>
sawing of stone material, comprising a blade carrying frame<br>
and blades (24) mounted to the frame, each blade keeping<br>
into contact and pressing abrasive elements against the<br>
groove in the surface of the stone material being sawn,<br>
each blade (24) being fixed to two opposite sides of the<br>
frame by coupling means or tie-rods (28, 26) namely, a<br>
"connecting-rod side tie-rod" and a "tensioning side tie-<br>
rod", the latter also functioning as tensioning elements<br>
to keep the blade at a predefined tension by means of sets<br>
of oil pistons, so that each piston acts on the related<br>
"tensioning side tie-rod" of each blade (24), each tie-rod<br>
having its outer end fixed to the frame and its other end<br>
fastened to the end of the blade (24) by means of a pin<br>
passing through concentric holes (33, 36) formed in the<br>
superimposed parts of the blade (24) and tie-rod (26),<br>
-	at each end of each blade (24), only one pin (34) is<br>
provided for fastening to the related tie-rod (26), and<br>
-	pin (34) and holes  (33,36) have corresponding non-<br>
circular  shape  and  are  coaxially  arranged  to  permit<br>
