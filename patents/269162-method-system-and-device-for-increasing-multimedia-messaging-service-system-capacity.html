				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to Multimedia Messaging Service (MMS)<br>
technologies, and in particular to a method, system and device for increasing a capacity<br>
of a multimedia messaging service system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The MMS is a further development of the Short Message Service (SMS) and the<br>
Enhanced Message Service (EMS) and provides a complete end-to-end solution for<br>
personal multimedia mobile communication services. The MMS enables both<br>
information transmission between mobile terminals and the diversity of contents<br>
including various combinations of picture, voice, image, data and text. As an open media<br>
access platform, the MMS can derive abundant content service applications from<br>
interactions between mobile users and Internet content providers. Emergence of the<br>
MMS and relevant applications provides operators with a new service increase point<br>
while consolidating and further expanding the achievements of operators already gained<br>
in message services, so that the operators can strengthen their core competitiveness and<br>
are preponderant in severe competition for the telecommunication operation service<br>
market.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a diagram of a structure of an existing multimedia<br>
messaging service system and the connection relationship with the outside world.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, the system includes a relay and a server.<br>
Particularly, the relay is adapted to receive a multimedia message sent from a<br>
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) gateway, a mail server and a Service Provider (SP)<br>
server and to perform MM2 encoding of the multimedia message and then transmit it to<br>
the server for processing; to receive a message sent from the server and to perform MM1<br>
encoding of a message intended for the WAP gateway and then transmit it to the gateway;<br>
to perform MM3 encoding of a message intended for the mail server and then transmit it<br>
to the mail server; and to perform MM7 encoding of a message intended for the SP and<br>
then transmit it to the mail server.<br>
The server is adapted to receive a multimedia message sent from the relay for<br>
storing and processing. The server can interoperate with an application server of an<br>
external network via a standard interface and provide a mobile terminal with abundant<br>
types of services.<br><br>
The relay and the server constitute a Multimedia Messaging Service Center<br>
(MMSC) node which performs protocols translation, content adaptation, storage and<br>
scheduling of a multimedia message and accomplishes an operation of transporting the<br>
multimedia message between different multimedia devices.<br>
In summary for above, only one MMSC node which processes all multimedia<br>
messages in the present network is present in the existing multimedia messaging service<br>
system. With an increasing of users of the multimedia messaging service, one node can<br>
not process all multimedia messages in a timely way due to a limited processing power<br>
of the single node, which may result in a service interruption and an influence upon the<br>
use by the users.<br>
For the problem of the limited processing power of the multimedia messaging<br>
service in the prior art, there are primarily two capacity extension methods adopted<br>
currently.<br>
One method is a dual-host scheme for a vertical capacity extension by means of<br>
extending a Central Processing Unit (CPU)/memory, but the processing power of a<br>
dual-host multimedia messaging service in this scheme may be at most a double of that<br>
of a single-host one. Further, the CPU/memory in a computer can not be extended<br>
infinitely, and consequently the processing power of its multimedia messaging service<br>
may still be limited.<br>
The other method is a capacity extension by segments. This method comprises a<br>
plurality of MMSC nodes, such as two MMSC nodes. Figure 2 is a schematic diagram of<br>
a structure of a multimedia messaging service system using a capacity extension by<br>
segments. Referring to Figure 2, the system divides mobile phone numbers with the<br>
beginning of 139102 into two number segments, in that 1391020-139104 is the first one<br>
whose service is processed by a server 1 and 1391025-139109 is the second one whose<br>
service is processed by a server 2. A sender sends a multimedia message to a load<br>
balancer. The load balancer determines a relay to receive the multimedia messaging<br>
service request according to its load balancing algorithm. The relay relays the<br>
multimedia messaging service request to a corresponding server according to a mobile<br>
phone number of the sender in a way that the service of the first number segment is<br>
processed by the server 1 and the service of the second number segment is processed by<br>
the server 2. The server stores the received multimedia message in a multimedia message<br>
storage module, reads the multimedia message from the multimedia message storage<br>
module upon determination of that a corresponding receiver can receive the multimedia<br>
message, and relays it to a relay which is determined according to loads of the relays, and<br><br>
the relay relays the multimedia message to the receiver. This method still has the<br>
following problems of limiting the processing power of the multimedia messaging<br>
system despite of an increased capacity thereof.<br>
Firstly, since the relays and the servers are separate modules, messages have to<br>
be relayed over the network, and the number of cross accesses between hosts is too large,<br>
which may result in the problem of a low speed of processing multimedia messages and<br>
limit the processing power of the multimedia messaging service system.<br>
Secondly, all the servers store received multimedia messages centrally into the<br>
multimedia message storage module. In the case of a large multimedia message service,<br>
an Input/Output (I/O) performance bottleneck of the multimedia message storage module<br>
may limit the speed of reading and writing of the multimedia messages, thereby limiting<br>
the processing power of the multimedia messaging service system. A demand of<br>
operators can not be satisfied in the case of a large service.<br>
Thirdly, the relays and the servers are separate modules and a situation may<br>
occur in which the relays and the servers have different loads due to a limitation of a<br>
service type variation, an interface, etc. For example, a relay is fully loaded and a server<br>
is far from a full load, which may result in a waste of resources.<br>
Fourthly, this method can not ensure that the two number segments have exactly<br>
uniform service, and the service is interrupted if one of the two servers fails due to an<br>
overload, which may affect the user experience.<br>
Summary of the Present Invention<br>
In view of above, an embodiment of the present invention provides a method<br>
for increasing a capacity of a multimedia messaging service system, which may increase<br>
a processing power of the multimedia messaging service system.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides a system for increasing a<br>
capacity of a multimedia messaging service system, which may increase a processing<br>
power of the multimedia messaging service system.<br>
An embodiment of the present invention provides an MMSC node for<br>
increasing a processing power of a multimedia messaging service system.<br>
To achieve the above objects, technical solutions of the embodiments of the<br>
present invention are realized as follows.<br>
A method for increasing a capacity of a multimedia messaging service system<br>
includes the steps of:<br><br>
determining, by a message distribution device upon receiving a multimedia<br>
message sent from a sender, a first Multimedia Messaging Service Center MMSC node<br>
to receive the multimedia message, and relaying the multimedia message to a relay of the<br>
first MMSC node;<br>
delivering, by the relay of the first MMSC node, the multimedia message to a<br>
server of the first MMSC node for storage, the server of the first MMSC node<br>
corresponding uniquely to the relay of the first MMSC node; and<br>
sending, by the server of the first MMSC node, the multimedia message to a<br>
receiver through the relay of the first MMSC node and the message distribution device.<br>
A Multimedia Messaging Service Center MMSC node includes a relay, a server<br>
one-to-one corresponding to the relay and a shared memory;<br>
the relay is adapted to receive a multimedia message sent from a message<br>
distribution device and relay the multimedia message to the server through the shared<br>
memory;<br>
the server is adapted to store the multimedia message sent from the relay and send<br>
the multimedia message to the relay through the shared memory, which is delivered to a<br>
receiver through the relay and the message distribution device; and<br>
the shared memory is adapted to transfer the message between the relay and the<br>
corresponding server.<br>
A system for increasing a capacity of a multimedia messaging service system,<br>
comprising at least two MMSC nodes as any of claims 9-10 and a message distribution<br>
device<br>
the message distribution device is adapted to receive the multimedia message,<br>
determine an MMSC node to process the multimedia message, relay the multimedia<br>
message to the relay of the MMSC node processing the multimedia message and receive<br>
and relay a multimedia message sent from the relay.<br>
As can be seen from the above solutions, the method, system and device for<br>
increasing a capacity of a multimedia messaging service system provided according to<br>
the embodiments of the present invention proposes a peer cluster solution for a capacity<br>
extension of a large capacity multimedia messaging service. In the present solution a<br>
relay and a server constitute correspondingly an independent MMSC node, so that<br>
processing of the same multimedia message is accomplished on the same node in the<br>
system, thereby reducing cross accesses between MMSC nodes and improving the speed<br>
of transferring the message. Since the server stores a received multimedia message by<br><br>
itself instead of centralized storage at a multimedia message storage module, each<br>
MMSC node can enable independently I/O reading and writing of the multimedia<br>
message, avoiding the problem of limited service processing of the multimedia<br>
messaging service system due to centralized reading and writing of the multimedia<br>
messages, and increasing the processing power of the multimedia messaging service<br>
system.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The present invention will be described in details hereinafter with reference to<br>
the drawings and the embodiments to make the objects, technical solution and<br>
advantages of the present invention more apparent.<br><br>
A method for increasing a capacity of a multimedia messaging service system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention provides a peer cluster solution for<br>
a horizontal capacity extension of a large capacity multimedia messaging service, and its<br>
primary idea is constituting a relay and a server correspondingly an MMSC node; a<br>
message distribution device determines an MMSC node to process the multimedia<br>
message upon receiving the multimedia message and relays the multimedia message to<br>
the relay of the MMSC node; the relay of the MMSC node relays the received<br>
multimedia message to the server uniquely corresponding to the relay and the server<br>
stores the multimedia message; and the server delivers the multimedia message through<br>
the corresponding relay corresponding and the message distribution device.<br>
A system for increasing a capacity of a multimedia messaging service system<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a message distribution<br>
device and at least two MMSC nodes.<br>
Particularly, the MMSC nodes include a relay and a server corresponding to the<br>
relay.<br>
The relay is adapted to transfer a message between the message distribution<br>
device and the server corresponding to the relay; and the server is adapted to receive and<br>
store the multimedia message sent from the relay corresponding to the server and to<br>
process and then transmit the multimedia message to the relay corresponding to the<br>
server.<br>
The message distribution device is adapted to receive the multimedia message,<br>
to determine an MMSC node to process the multimedia message, relay the multimedia<br>
message to the relay of the MMSC node and to receive the multimedia message sent<br>
from the relay and then relay the multimedia message.<br>
The peer cluster solution will be described below taking an example of a peer<br>
cluster architecture including four nodes. In this embodiment, a relay and a server<br>
corresponding to the relay constitute an MMSC node in a way that both the relay and the<br>
server process are incorporated on a host. A message distribution device in this<br>
embodiment is a load balancer.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram of a structure of the system for increasing a capacity of a<br>
multimedia messaging service system according to a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to Figure 3, the system includes a load balancer, a switch<br>
and four separate MMSC nodes each consisting of a relay and a server corresponding to<br>
the relay.<br><br>
Particularly, the four MMSC nodes constitute two sets of dual hosts and each<br>
set of dual hosts includes two node resource groups. Each node resource group has its<br>
own independent array of disks, or two node resource groups share a same array of disks,<br>
and each node resource group has its own dual-host Float Internet Protocol (FIP) address.<br>
All of the MMSC nodes in the system are numbered uniformly, and a port number of the<br>
server of the MMSC node is determined according to the type of a multimedia message<br>
receiver. The port number of the server indicates an application process of the server. For<br>
example, if a multimedia message is to be sent to a mobile terminal through a WAP<br>
gateway, a port number of the server of the MMSC node 1 may be 8001 and a port<br>
number of the server of the MMSC node 2 may be 8002. If a multimedia message is to be<br>
sent to a mail server or another MMSC node, the port number of the server of the MMSC<br>
node 1 may be 2501 and the port number of the server of the MMSC node 2 may be 2502.<br>
If a multimedia message is to be sent to an SP, the port number of the server of the<br>
MMSC node 1 may be 8801 and the port number of the server of the MMSC node 2 may<br>
be 8802. The FTP address of the MMSC node indicates an Internet Protocol (IP) address<br>
of the MMSC node and may also be set by means of the same sequential numbering as<br>
above.<br>
When the load balancer receives a multimedia message sent through the WAP<br>
gateway by a mobile terminal, the load balancer determines an MMSC node to process<br>
the multimedia message, such as the MMSC node 1, according to load conditions of the<br>
MMSC nodes and relays the multimedia message to the relay 1 of the MMSC node 1;<br>
and the relay 1 performs protocol translation of the multimedia message and then<br>
delivers it to the corresponding server 1.<br>
The server 1 processes the multimedia message upon receiving the multimedia<br>
message and generates identification information including node number information.<br>
The identification information includes a Transaction ID and a Message ID.<br>
If the multimedia message is a message to be sent to the mail server, the server 1<br>
generates a response message and sends it to the corresponding relay 1. The relay 1<br>
performs protocol translation of the response message and then sends it to the load<br>
balancer. The load balancer performs IP address translation (NAT, Network Address<br>
Translation) of the IP header of the response message and then sends it to the WAP<br>
gateway. Also, the server 1 sends the multimedia message to the load balancer through<br>
the corresponding relay 1. The load balancer performs source IP address translation<br>
(SNAT, Source Network Address Translation) of the IP header of the multimedia<br>
message and then sends it to the mail server.<br><br>
If the multimedia message is a message to be sent to an SP server, the server 1<br>
sends a response message to the WAP gateway through the corresponding relay 1 and the<br>
load balancer. The server 1 sends the multimedia message to the load balancer, and the<br>
load balancer stores session information of the multimedia message upon receiving the<br>
multimedia message, and performs SNAT of the IP header of the multimedia message<br>
and then sends it to the SP. The SP sends a response message to the load balancer upon<br>
receiving the multimedia message. The load balancer sends the response message to the<br>
relay 1 of the MMSC node 1 according to the stored session information.<br>
If the multimedia message is a message to be sent through the WAP gateway by<br>
a mobile terminal to another mobile terminal, the server 1 generates a response message<br>
and a notification message respectively, sends the response message through the<br>
corresponding relay 1 to the WAP gateway and sends the notification message through<br>
the corresponding load balancer to the WAP gateway. The WAP gateway sends the<br>
messages to the mobile terminal according to address information in the messages. The<br>
notification message includes the identification information carrying the MMSC node<br>
number information and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the notification message<br>
carries the port number of the server 1 receiving the multimedia message, such as 8001.<br>
The WAP gateway sends to the load balancer a notification response message<br>
carrying the identification information. The load balancer determines an MMSC node to<br>
receive the notification response message, such as the MMSC node 2, according to load<br>
conditions of the MMSC nodes and sends the notification response message to the relay<br>
2 of the MMSC node 2. The relay 2 sends the notification response message through a<br>
switch to the server of the MMSC node, such as server 1, according to the identification<br>
information of the notification response message, and the server of the MMSC node<br>
corresponds to the MMSC node number information of the identification information.<br>
Then, the mobile terminal sends through the WAP gateway to the load balancer<br>
a message retrieval request carrying the port number and the identification information<br>
of the server 1. The load balancer sends the message retrieval request to the server<br>
corresponding to the server port number, such as the server 1, according to the server port<br>
number of the message retrieval request upon receiving the message retrieval request.<br>
The server 1 finds the multimedia message corresponding to the identification<br>
information of the message retrieval request upon receiving the message retrieval request,<br>
and sends it to the mobile terminal through the corresponding relay 1, the load balancer<br>
and the WAP gateway.<br>
The mobile terminal sends to the load balancer through the WAP gateway a<br><br>
success message meaning successful download carrying the identification information.<br>
The load balancer determines an MMSC node to receive the success message, such as<br>
the MMSC node 3, according to load conditions of the MMSC nodes upon receiving the<br>
success message and sends it to the relay 3 of the MMSC node 3. The relay 3 sends the<br>
success message to the server of the MMSC node corresponding to the MMSC node<br>
number information of the identification information, such as the server 1, according to<br>
the identification information of the success message.<br>
The load balancer receives a multimedia message sent from the SP, and<br>
determines an MMSC node to receive the multimedia message, such as the MMSC node<br>
1, according to load conditions of the MMSC nodes and sends the multimedia message<br>
to the relay 1 of the MMSC node 1. The relay 1 performs protocol translation of the<br>
multimedia message and then delivers it to the corresponding server 1. Then the<br>
multimedia message is delivered in the above flow of sending the multimedia message to<br>
the mobile terminal through the WAP gateway.<br>
The load balancer receives a multimedia message sent from the mail server, and<br>
determines an MMSC node to receive the multimedia message, such as the MMSC node<br>
1, according to load conditions of the MMSC nodes and sends the multimedia message<br>
to the relay 1 of the MMSC node 1. The relay 1 performs protocol translation of the<br>
multimedia message and then delivers it to the corresponding server 1. The server 1<br>
generates a response message and sends it to the mail server through the corresponding<br>
relay 1 and the load balancer. Then the multimedia message is delivered in the above<br>
flow of sending the multimedia message to the mobile terminal through the WAP<br>
gateway.<br>
Since underlying platforms for all components of the MMSC nodes in the<br>
system are based upon the same message bus and an appropriate communication manner<br>
can be selected automatically according to a connection deployment, therefore<br>
communication between the hosts is conducted through the switch and communication<br>
internal in the host is conducted through a shared memory. That is, for a session initiation<br>
message, a relay delivers it to the server located in the same host as the relay through a<br>
shared memory; and for a transaction handling process, the relay delivers a message to a<br>
server processing the present session according to identification information of the<br>
message; and a message initiated from a server is delivered to a relay on the present host<br>
through a shared memory.<br>
Normally, the two sets of resource groups in the dual hosts of the system<br>
operate respectively on two single hosts among the dual hosts. When one single host<br><br>
among the dual hosts fails due to the host or application software, the entire resource<br>
group on the host is switched to the other host through the switch for operating. When a<br>
process of the relay/server of the failing host is operated, the original FTP address is still<br>
in use, and an IP address in a multimedia message processed on the relay and the server<br>
is not changed, so that the failure of the host has no influence upon processing of the<br>
multimedia message. At this time, two sets of relays/servers operate on a host, and each<br>
set can use only a half of CPU and memory resources of the system, so a processing<br>
power of each set of relay/server is halved but this does not influence the effectiveness of<br>
the entire system, both the message buffered due to the failure and the ongoing session<br>
processing is reserved, and only a new message submitted during switching due to the<br>
failure is lost. In this case, since the load balancer can balance loads of the respective<br>
MMSC nodes, a sum of processing powers of the two sets of relays/servers of the entire<br>
host can be substantially equivalent to that of a normal cluster node, that is, a system with<br>
a number N of MMSC nodes loses 1/N of a processing power of the system upon failure<br>
of a single point. In this embodiment, the system with four hosts loses 25% of the<br>
processing power. In a practical application, the larger the N is, the lower the proportion<br>
of loss will be.<br>
Further, the relay in this embodiment of the present invention are components<br>
implemented by software, and an initial memory is not allocated in a way with the<br>
consistency of a maximum memory and a minimum memory but is scheduled<br>
automatically by software so as to reduce a memory occupied during switching due to a<br>
failure.<br>
Three embodiments are described below respectively. The message distribution<br>
device in the three embodiments is a load balancer. The method that the load balancer<br>
determines an MMSC node to receive a multimedia messaging service request is<br>
selecting an MMSC node whose load is minimum among all the MMSC nodes. The<br>
method includes following three methods.<br>
In one method, the load balancer sends detection information to the MMSC<br>
nodes upon receiving a multimedia messaging service request, receives response<br>
information from the respective MMSC nodes, and determines the most rapidly<br>
responding node as the node with the minimum load.<br>
In another method, upon receiving a new multimedia messaging service request,<br>
the load balancer records the number of multimedia messaging service requests<br>
processed by each MMSC node, and determines the node currently processing the<br>
smallest number of multimedia messaging service requests as the node with the<br><br>
minimum load.<br>
In yet another method, load of each MMSC node resource group is calculated<br>
according to CPU model numbers, the number of CPUs, a memory, and the number of<br>
current connections of the MMSC node resource group, and the node with the minimum<br>
load is determined as the node with the minimum load. A specific conversion process is<br>
known in the prior art and descriptions thereof will be omitted here.<br>
A relay and a server corresponding to the relay in the embodiments of the<br>
present invention operate on the same host to constitute an independent MMSC node. A<br>
message received by the relay can be delivered directly to the server corresponding to the<br>
relay through a shared memory, and the server delivers a message for transmission<br>
directly to the relay corresponding to the server through the shared memory.<br>
The One Embodiment<br>
Referring to Figure 4, Figure 4 is a flow chart of a method for implementing a<br>
multimedia messaging service sent by a mobile terminal to another mobile terminal<br>
according to the one embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the<br>
following steps.<br>
Steps 400 to 402: A sender sends an MM1 multimedia message submit request<br>
(MMl_Submit.req) to the load balancer through the WAP gateway. The load balancer<br>
sends the multimedia message to the relay of the minimum load. MMSC node, such as<br>
the relay 1. The relay 1 performs MM2 encoding of the multimedia message and then<br>
submits it to the server 1 on the present node through a shared memory.<br>
In this step, before the sender sends the multimedia message to the load<br>
balancer, a Transfer Control Protocol (TCP) connection is firstly established between the<br>
sender, the gateway and load balancer, and a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)<br>
connection is established between the load balancer and the relay of the MMSC node.<br>
Data transmission between the sender and the MMSC node is enabled through the two<br>
connections. A specific process of establishing the connections is known in the prior art<br>
and descriptions thereof will be omitted here.<br>
Steps 403 to 405: The server 1 stores the multimedia message upon receiving<br>
the multimedia message, performs processing such as format translation and the like, and<br>
returns a response message to the relay 1 of the host. The server 1 also generates<br>
identification information including node number information. The relay 1 performs<br>
MM1 encoding of the received response message and then returns it to the load balancer<br>
in the original HTTP connection. The load balancer performs an NAT operation on the IP<br><br>
header of the response message and then sends it to the WAP gateway through the<br>
established TCP connection, and in turn the WAP gateway relays the message to the<br>
sender according to a sender address in the response message.<br>
Step 406: The server 1 constructs a MM2 notification message<br>
(MM2_Notification.ind) and delivers it to the relay 1 on the present node.<br>
The notification message includes the identification information generated by<br>
the MMSC node 1, where the identification information includes the node number<br>
information of the present node, and address information of a receiver. A URL of the<br>
notification message carries the port number of the server of the node, such as 8001, and<br>
an IP address of the URL is a outward-mapped public IP address of the multimedia<br>
messaging service system.<br>
Steps 407 to 408: The relay 1 performs MM1 encoding of the notification<br>
message and then sends it to the load balancer. The load balancer performs an SNAT<br>
operation on the notification message and then sends it to the WAP gateway according to<br>
the receiver address in the notification message. The WAP gateway relays the message to<br>
the receiver.<br>
Step 409: The receiver responds with an MM1 notification response message<br>
(MMl_NotifyResp.ind) upon receiving the notification message.<br>
The notification response message carries the identification information of the<br>
notification message. A response address is an information server address set by a mobile<br>
terminal, that is, an SNAT operated source IP address, and thus points to the load<br>
balancer.<br>
Step 410: The load balancer determines the MMSC node with the minimum<br>
load upon receiving the notification response message, and sends the notification<br>
response message to the relay of the MMSC node with the minimum load, such as the<br>
relay 2 of the MMSC node 2.<br>
Step 411: The relay 2 performs MM2 encoding upon receiving the notification<br>
response message while recognizing the identification information of the notification<br>
response message, and relays the notification response message to the server of the<br>
MMSC node corresponding to the MMSC node number information of the identification<br>
information.<br>
In this step, the server receiving the notification response message is a server<br>
processing the present session. The server receiving the notification response message is<br>
server 1 in this embodiment.<br><br>
Step 412: The WAP gateway sends an MM1 message retrieval request<br>
(MMlRetrieve.req) message of the sender to the load balancer.<br>
The request message includes a message identifier of the multimedia message,<br>
and URL of the multimedia message includes the port number of the server processing<br>
the multimedia message to be downloaded, such as 8001 in this embodiment.<br>
Steps 413 to 414: The load balancer distributes the message retrieval request to<br>
the relay on the MMSC node processing the present transaction, according to the port<br>
number in the URL of the request message. The relay is relay 1 in this embodiment. The<br>
relay 1 performs MM2 encoding of the request message and sends it to the server 1 of the<br>
MMSC node through the shared memory.<br>
Steps 415 to 417: The server 1 searches in all multimedia messages stored on<br>
itself the corresponding multimedia message according to the message identifier in the<br>
request message, and returns the corresponding multimedia message to the relay 1<br>
through the shared memory. The relay 1 performs MM1 encoding of the multimedia<br>
message and then sends it to the load balancer in the original HTTP connection. The load<br>
balancer performs an NAT operation on the IP header of the multimedia message and<br>
then sends it to the gateway through the reserved TCP connection. The WAP gateway<br>
relays the multimedia message to the receiver.<br>
Steps 418 to 420: The receiver sends an MM1 success<br>
message(MMl_acknowledge.ind) carrying the transaction identification information to<br>
its information server, i.e., the load balancer, upon receiving the multimedia message.<br>
The load balancer relays the success message to the relay of the MMSC node with the<br>
minimum load, such as the relay 2. The relay 2 performs MM2 encoding upon receiving<br>
the success message while recognizing the identification information in the message, and<br>
relays the success message to the server, a server processing the present session, of the<br>
MMSC node corresponding to the MMSC node number information of the identification<br>
information. The server processing the present session is server 1 in this embodiment.<br>
The server 1 upon receiving the success message deletes the stored multimedia message<br>
and releases the resources, thereby terminating present transaction processing.<br>
In the above steps, the steps 400 to 405 constitute a process in which the sender<br>
submits the multimedia message and receives the response message with which the<br>
server responds, and the steps 406 to 411 constitute a process in which the server sends<br>
the notification message to the receiver and receives the notification response message;<br>
and the steps 412 to 420 constitute a process in which the receiver receives the<br>
multimedia message and sends the success message.<br><br>
The Another Embodiment<br>
Referring to Figure 5, Figure 5 is a flow chart of a method for implementing a<br>
multimedia messaging service sent by a mobile terminal to an SP according to the<br>
another embodiment of the present invention and the method includes the following<br>
steps.<br>
The steps 500 to 505 constitute a process in which a mobile terminal of the<br>
sender submits a multimedia message and receives a response from an MMSC node, and<br>
are the same as the steps 400 to 405 in the embodiment as illustrated in Figure 4.<br>
Steps 506 to 508: The server 1 constructs an MM2 multimedia message<br>
delivery request message (MM2_Delivery.req), and the relay 1 of the node encodes it<br>
into an MM7 multimedia message delivery request message (MM7_Delivery.req) and<br>
then sends it to the load balancer. The load balancer performs an SNAT operation on the<br>
request message and then sends it to a corresponding SP according to address<br>
information of a receiver in the request message, i.e., an IP address of the SP.<br>
Steps 509 to 510: The SP sends an MM7 response message (MM7_Delivery.res)<br>
to the load balancer. The load balancer relays the response message to the relay of the<br>
MMSC node processing the present session, according to the stored session information.<br>
The relay of the MMSC node processing the present session is relay 1 in this<br>
embodiment.<br>
Since the MM7_Delivery.req/res are in a socket session, the load balancer<br>
deliver the MM7_Delivery.res to the node processing the present transaction according<br>
to the stored session information.<br>
Step 511: The relay 1 receives and performs MM2 encoding of the response<br>
message and sends it to the sever 1. The server 1 upon receiving the response message<br>
deletes the stored multimedia message and releases the resources, thereby terminating<br>
present transaction processing.<br>
The steps 506 to 511 in this embodiment constitute a process in which the<br>
server of the MMSC node delivers the multimedia message to the SP and receives a<br>
response message from the SP.<br>
If the SP is replaced with a mail server, then the steps 506 to 508 are as follows.<br>
The server 1 constructs an MM2 multimedia message sending request message<br>
(MMSMTPSend), and the relay 1 of the node performs MM3 encoding and then sends<br>
it to the load balancer. The load balancer performs an SNAT operation of the request<br>
message and then sends it to the corresponding mail server according to the address<br><br>
information of the receiver, i.e., the IP address of the mail server. The steps 509 to 511<br>
may be omitted.<br>
The Yet Another Embodiment<br>
Referring to Figure 6, Figure .6 is a flow chart of a method for implementing a<br>
multimedia messaging service from an SP to a mobile terminal according to the yet<br>
another embodiment of the present invention and the method includes the following<br>
steps.<br>
Steps 600 to 602: An SP submits an MM7 multimedia message submit request<br>
(MM7_Submit.req) message to the load balancer. The load balancer determines the<br>
MMSC node with the minimum load and sends the request message to relay of the<br>
MMSC node with the minimum load, such as the relay 1. The relay 1 performs MM2<br>
encoding of the request message and then submits it to the server 1 through a shared<br>
memory.<br>
Steps 603 to 605: The server 1 processes the request message and returns an<br>
MM2 response message (MM2_Submit.res). The relay 1 receives the response message,<br>
performs MM7 encoding and returns it to the load balancer in the original HTTP<br>
connection; and the load balancer performs an NAT operation on the IP header of the<br>
response message and then sends it to the SP through the reserved TCP connection.<br>
The steps 606 to 620 may be the same as the steps 406 to 420.<br>
In this embodiment, the steps 600 to 605 constitute a process in which the SP<br>
submits the multimedia message and receives the response message, the steps 606 to 611<br>
sends for the server the notification message to the receiver and receives the response<br>
message with which it responds, and the steps 612 to 620 constitute a process in which<br>
the receiver retrieves the multimedia message and sends the success message.<br>
If the SP is replaced with a mail server, then step 800 is that the mail server<br>
submits an MM3 multimedia message submit request (MM3_SMTP.Send) to the load<br>
balancer, and the steps 603 to 605 may be omitted while the other steps remain the same.<br>
When a sender and a receiver of a multimedia message are not in the same<br>
network, an MMSC node to which the sender belongs forwards the received multimedia<br>
message to an MMSC node to which the receiver belongs for processing. A flow chart of<br>
the method at this time is as illustrated in Figure 7. Referring to Figure 7, the method<br>
includes the following steps.<br>
Steps 700 to 702: The server 1 of the MMSC node receiving a multimedia<br>
messaging service request constructs contents of a multimedia message to be relayed and<br><br>
control information into an MM2 forward request message (MM2_Forward.req). The<br>
control information includes identification information and an address of a receiver. The<br>
relay 1 encodes it into an MM4 forward request message (MM4_Forward.req) and then<br>
sends it to the load balancer. The load balancer performs an SNAT operation of the<br>
forward request message and then sends it to an MMSC node to which the receiver<br>
belongs.<br>
Steps 703 to 705: The MMSC node to which the receiver belongs sends an<br>
MM4 forward response message (MM4_Forward.res) to the load balancer upon<br>
receiving the forward request message. The load balancer sends the response message to<br>
the relay of the MMSC node with the minimum load, such as the relay 2. In turn the relay<br>
2 parses the identification information of the response message and routes the response<br>
message to a server processing the session, the server 1 in this embodiment.<br>
Steps 706 to 708: The MMSC node receiving the forward request message<br>
sends an MM4 report message of multimedia message relaying success<br>
(MM4_DeliveryReport.rep) to the load balancer upon successful issuing of the<br>
multimedia message. The load balancer relays it to the relay with the minimum load,<br>
such as the relay 2. The relay 2 parses the identification information in the report<br>
message and routes the report message to a server processing the session, the server 1 in<br>
this embodiment.<br>
Steps 709 to 711: The server 1 sends an MM4 report response message<br>
(MM4_Deliver.res) to the load balancer through the relay 1 on the node. The load<br>
balancer performs an SNAT operations of the response message and then sends it to the<br>
MMSC node receiving the forward request message to which the receiver belongs,<br>
thereby terminating present transaction processing.<br>
In this embodiment, the steps 700 to 705 constitute a process in which the<br>
MMSC node receiving the multimedia messaging service request sends the MM4<br>
forward request message and receives the forward response message, and the steps 706<br>
to 711 constitute a process in which the MMSC node to which the receiver belongs sends<br>
the MM4 report message of multimedia message relaying success upon successful<br>
relaying of the multimedia message and receives the report response message.<br>
When an MMSC node to which the sender belongs sends the forward request,<br>
an MMSC node receiving the forward request message in the receiving network<br>
proceeds with an inward forward flow. It is assumed that the receiver is a mobile terminal,<br>
and Figure8 illustrates a flow chart of a method for inward MM4 forward. Referring to<br>
Figure 8, the method includes the following steps.<br><br>
Steps 800 to 802: An MMSC node to which the sender belongs submits an<br>
MM4 forward request message (MM4_Forward.req) to the load balancer. The load<br>
balancer sends the request message to the relay of the node with the minimum load in the<br>
receiving network, such as the relay 2. The relay 2 distributes it to the server 1 according<br>
to a message identifier in the request message.<br>
It is required in this step that multimedia messages with the same message<br>
identifier shall be distributed to the same server.<br>
Steps 803 to 805: The server 1 constructs an MM2 forward request response<br>
message (MM2_Forward.res) upon receiving the request message, and the relay 1 on the<br>
node encodes it into an MM4 forward request response message (MM4_Forward.res)<br>
and then sends the message to the load balancer. The server 1 records the old message<br>
identifier and transaction identifier and generates a new message identifier and<br>
transaction identifier. The load balancer receives the forward request response message<br>
sent from the relay and then performs an SNAT operation on the response message and<br>
relays it to the MMSC node sending the forward request message in the sending network.<br>
Step 806: The server 1 constructs an MM2 notification message<br>
(MM2_Notification.ind) to be sent to a mobile terminal of the receiver with the new<br>
message identifier and transaction identifier and sends the message to the relay 1 on the<br>
node.<br>
In this step, a URL in the notification message includes the port number of the<br>
server processing the transaction, such as 8001.<br>
The steps 807 to 820 are the same as the steps 407 to 420 in the flow of the<br>
method for implementing a multimedia messaging service method from a mobile<br>
terminal to a mobile terminal according to the first embodiment of Figure 4 and<br>
descriptions thereof will be omitted here.<br>
Steps 821 to 823: The server 1 generates an MM2 report message of multimedia<br>
message relaying success (MM2_DeliveryReport.req) including information on the old<br>
message identifier and the new transaction identifier. The relay 1 of the node encodes it<br>
into an MM4 report message of multimedia message relaying success<br>
(MM4_DeliveryReport.req) and then sends it to the load balancer. The load balancer<br>
performs an SNAT operation on the report message and then sends it to the MMSC node<br>
sending the forward request message in the sending network according to the<br>
information on the old message identifier.<br>
Steps 824 to 825: The MMSC node sending the forward request message in the<br><br>
sending network returns an MM4 report response message (MM4_DeliveryReport.res)<br>
to the load balancer upon receiving the report message of multimedia message relaying<br>
success; and the load balancer sends the response message to the relay of the MMSC<br>
node with the minimum load, such as the relay 2.<br>
Step 826: The relay routes the message to the server 1 processing the session<br>
according to the identification information in the response message.<br>
In this embodiment, the steps 800 to 805 constitute a process in which the MM4<br>
forward request message is received and the MM4 forward response is sent, the steps<br>
806 to 811 constitute a process in which the notification message is sent to the mobile<br>
terminal and a process in which the notification response message is received from the<br>
mobile terminal, the steps 812 to 820 constitute a process in which the mobile terminal<br>
retrieves the multimedia message and sends the success message, and the steps 821 to<br>
826 constitute a process in which an MMSC node to which the receiver belongs sends<br>
the report message of multimedia message relaying success upon successful relaying of<br>
the multimedia message and receives the report response message.<br>
The WAP gateway in the present invention can also be an IP gateway.<br>
In a practical application, the number of MMSC nodes in the system can be set<br>
as required for a service, less or more than four.<br>
Figure 9 is a diagram of a structure of an MMSC node according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in Figure 9, the node includes a relay,<br>
a server corresponding uniquely to the relay and a shared memory.<br>
Particularly, the relay is adapted to receive a multimedia message sent from a<br>
message distribution device and relay the multimedia message to the server through the<br>
shared memory. The server is adapted to store the multimedia message sent from the<br>
relay and send it to the relay through the shared memory. The multimedia message is<br>
delivered to a receiver through the relay and the message distribution device. The relay is<br>
adapted to transfer the multimedia message between the relay and the corresponding<br>
server.<br>
Specifically, the server includes a storage module adapted to store the<br>
multimedia message sent from the relay through the shared memory; an identification<br>
information generation module adapted to generate identification information including<br>
an information identifier and a transaction identifier upon receiving the multimedia<br>
message; and an issuing module adapted to deliver the multimedia message stored in the<br>
storage module to the receiver of a multimedia messaging service through the shared<br><br>
memory and the relay according to the identification information.<br>
The server further includes a determination module and a forward request<br>
generation module. Particularly, the determination module is adapted to determine<br>
whether address information of the receiver in the multimedia message belongs to the<br>
MMSC node; if yes, the issuing module delivers the multimedia message; otherwise, the<br>
forward request generation module generates a forward request message and sends it to<br>
the message distribution device through the shared memory and the relay.<br>
As can be seen from above, the method, system and device for implementing a<br>
large capacity multimedia messaging service provided according to the embodiments of<br>
the present invention propose a peer cluster solution for a horizontal capacity extension<br>
of a large capacity multimedia messaging service and have the following advantages.<br>
Firstly, the relay and the server are integrated to constitute an independent<br>
MMSC node, so that processing of contents of the same multimedia message is<br>
accomplished on the same node in the system, thereby reducing cross accesses between<br>
nodes, improving the efficiency of transferring the message and hence increasing the<br>
processing power of the multimedia messaging service system. Further, all MMSC nodes<br>
are numbered uniformly and number information is made correspond to the port number<br>
of the server, so that the message distribution device can send a message retrieval request<br>
directly to the MMSC node processing the session, and the relay can deliver the<br>
multimedia message directly to the corresponding server, thereby improving the<br>
efficiency of transferring the message, reducing greatly the demand for a transmission<br>
speed of network devices and increasing the processing power of the multimedia<br>
messaging service system.<br>
Secondly, each MMSC node can enable independently I/O reading and writing<br>
of a multimedia message, thereby optimizing the storage architecture of the multimedia<br>
message and avoiding the problem of limited service processing of the multimedia<br>
messaging service system due to centralized reading and writing of the multimedia<br>
messages. Further, the respective MMSC nodes in the peer cluster perform the<br>
multimedia messaging service concurrently, thereby improving the processing speed of<br>
the multimedia messages and hence increasing the processing power of the multimedia<br>
messaging service system.<br>
Thirdly, as new demands for the multimedia messaging service constantly<br>
emerge, a proportion of the demand for a processing power required for the relay and the<br>
server will vary dynamically, and the relay and the server are integrated on a host to<br>
constitute an independent node in the embodiments of the present invention, thereby<br><br>
achieving an online smooth extension of the system; and each MMSC node can adjust<br>
dynamically CPU and memory resources occupied for a relay and a server according to a<br>
practical consumption so as to be adapted to the varying service demand, thereby<br>
avoiding a waste of the resources.<br>
Fourthly, the load balancer determines an MMSC node to receive a service<br>
request according to a load condition of a relay and a server corresponding to the relay<br>
instead of allocating a service by number segments, and makes identification information<br>
generated by the server correspond to number information of the MMSC node, so that<br>
the relay can relay a message to the server processing the present service request, which<br>
corresponds to the node number information, according to the identification information,<br>
thereby achieving indeed a load balancer among the MMSC nodes.<br>
Fifthly, the inventive system is structured simply, and the respective MMSC<br>
nodes can be configured with the same system software and thus can be maintained and<br>
managed equally thereby improving maintainability of the system.<br><br>
