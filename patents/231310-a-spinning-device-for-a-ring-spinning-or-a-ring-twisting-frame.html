The invention relates to a spinning device for a ring spinning or a ring twisting frame, with a spindle shaft driven by a whorl and with a yarn clamping device, which, within the upper section, comprises an under-winding crown or cutting ring, as well as a sliding sleeve enveloping the whorl or the spindle shaft, the sliding sleeve being in connection with the under-winding crown, in order to hold clamped the under-winding of the yarn wound-up on a sleeve being mounted on the spindle shaft between the sliding sleeve and the under-winding crown.<br>
Such a spinning device is for example known from the disclosures EP-B-0 462 467 or DE 197 55 971.9, and/or 197 19 166.5, and comprises a yarn clamping device. It consists of a spindle shaft provided with an under-winding crown and a fixation sleeve, and a spinning ring with a traveller, provided on a ring frame. The fixation sleeve or sliding sleeve is pre-tensioned, by means of a compression spring positioned between the front surface of the whorl and a flange of the fixation sleeve, against the under-winding crown. The fixation sleeve is provided with an outer ring, which rests against a stop on the ring frame. By means of the ring frame the fixation sleeve is thus moved upward or downward within a limited zone. During under-winding the ring and the traveller are below the under-winding crown, so that the fixation sleeve is lifted off the under-winding crown. During the doffing movement, if the ring frame is moved upward, the fixation sleeve also moves upward and clamps the under-wound yarn against the under-winding crown, so that the yarn is torn off at the under-winding crown.<br>
The object of the invention is the task to improve a known spinning device in such a manner that the yarn-clamping device is easily replaceable.<br>
This task is solved by a spinning device with the characteristic feature of the invention, wherein the yarn clamping device is an exchangeable pre-assembled structural unit with a sleeve part, which is positioned on the spindle shaft as a support part, the under-winding crown or the cutting ring, the sliding sleeve, a compression spring and a cover ring, and the sleeve part has, in relation to the spindle shaft, a slide fit and is connected with the<br>
2<br><br>
shaft by positive connections, that is rotation locked and non-shiftable in axial direction, and the compression spring on the one hand supports itself against the sliding sleeve and on the other hand rests against a cover ring on the sleeve part, and the compression spring, together with the sliding sleeve, is centred on the sleeve part. A spinning device, in particular for a ring spinning or a ring-twisting frame, with a spindle shaft driven by a whorl, comprises an under-winding crown within the lower section. A sliding sleeve envelops a sleeve part, with the under-winding crown fastened to it, which also has the ftmction of a cutting ring on the spindle shaft, which is operatively connected with the under-winding crown, in order to hold the under-winding of the yam wound-up on a sleeve positioned by clamping on the spindle shaft. The spinning device is characterized by a replaceable yam clamping device, containing the parts mentioned, said yam clamping device is engaged in a positive connection with the spindle shaft.<br>
Further advantages of the invention result from the following description, in which the invention is described in more detail on the basis of an exemplified embodiment illustrated in the schematic accompanying drawings.<br>
It shows:<br>
Figure 1        a cross section through a spinning device with a spindle shaft, a whorl and a sliding sleeve in the under-winding position:<br>
Figure la       a part of the spindle and of the clamping device.<br>
In figure 1 is a spinning device with a spindle shaft 1, a slipped-on sleeve and a yam cop 3 formed on it is illustrated in longitudinal cross section. On a ring frame 6 a spinning ring 5 is provided with a traveller 4, by which the, not shown in the drawings, yam is spun and wound onto the sleeve 2. The spindle shaft 1 with its lower section is pressed into a whorl 7, which comprises a bomb-shaped section for the driving belt not further illustrated. On the whorl 7 a sliding sleeve 9 is shiftable arranged. A compression spring 10 presses the sliding sleeve 9 upward. A stop ring 13 on the outside of the sliding sleeve<br>
3<br><br>
9 stands against a downward projecting stop 21 of the ring frame 6, so that the sliding sleeve 9, by the spring force of the compression spring 10 directed upward, takes part in the up and downward movement X of the ring frame 6 within a limited zone. Furthermore, on the spindle shaft 1, an under-winding crown 15 is provided in known manner, below which spacers 22 are arranged which are configured as projections. The internal cylindrical wall of the ring-shaped guidance part 14 in the illustrated configuration is shaped complementary to the spacers 22, i.e. does comprise corresponding grooves (here not further illustrated).<br>
The spinning device in figure 1 is illustrated in the so-called under-winding position, i.e. the traveller 4 remains, for a short time, at same height with the spacers 22 of the spindle shaft 1, so that the under-winding 45 can be wound below the under-winding crown 15 after completion of a cop 3. The yarn is clamped after the upward motion of the sliding sleeve 9 and, with the removal of the cop sleeve 2 off the under-winding crown 15 and/or the toothed cutting ring, it is torn off and the under-winding remains on the spindle shaft 1. Supplementally a knife 11 can be provided, if coarse yarn is produced.<br>
As can be see from the detail illustration in figure 1, the knife 11 is below the under-winding crown 15 and above the sliding sleeve 9, whereby the downward directed cutting edge lies radially outside the clamping surface 14, 14' on the sleeve part 15' and/or the sliding sleeve 9. The clamping surface 14' of the sleeve part 15', directed downward, and the clamping surface 14 at the sliding sleeve 9, directed upward, can be configured plane or be provided with a serration. The cutting edge of the knife 11, in the clamped condition of the thread and/or in the closed condition of the sliding sleeve 9, if the clamping surfaces 14, 14' lie on top of one another, is below these clamping surfaces 14, 14', so that the cutting edge 11' is farther away from the yarn cop 3, than the clamping surface 14, 14'. The length of the under-winding between the clamping surfaces 14, 14' amounts to preferably less than a length of the circumference on the sleeve part 15', based on a measurement at the outer radius of the spacers 22.<br>
4<br><br>
The spacers 22 are preferably configured as protruding, semicircular cylinders which are aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the spindle shaft 1. The spacers 22 are arranged at regular spaces to each other along the circumference of the spindle shaft 1.<br>
Preferably the under-winding crown 15, with sleeve part 15', is made of aluminium die cast or plastic with integrated spacers 22, which comprise a slide fit on the spindle 1. On the lower surface of the under-winding crown 15 there is preferably a serration for the yarn, said serration is furnished complementary to a serration on top of the guiding part<br>
14	of the sliding sleeve 9 on the clamping surface 14'.<br>
The sliding sleeve 9 is preferably made from PBTP, reinforced with glass fibres, while the stop ring 13 is made from plastic doped with MoS2. Preferably the sleeve part 15' is made from PA 6 injection moulded reinforced with glass fibres, whereby the cutting ring<br>
15	is included in the injection moulding.<br>
On the other hand, in place of the before-described cylindrical spacers 22, longitudinal slots can also be furnished on the spindle shaft 1 below the under-winding crown 15, into which inward protruding noses of the guidance part 14 engage.<br>
According to the invention the sleeve part 15', the under-winding crown and/or the cutting ring 15 as well as the sliding sleeve 9 with the compression spring 10 and the cover ring 16 form a structural unit, positioned on the spindle shaft 1, which altogether is called yarn clamping device 150. This structural unit can be slided from the top over the spindle shaft 1, whereby the sleeve part 15' comprises a slide fit on the corresponding part of the spindle shaft 1. The sleeve part 15' must become secured both in axial direction of the spindle shaft 1 and in its circumferential direction. For axial fastening a groove 15'a is formed into the sleeve part 15' and likewise a groove lb into the spindle shaft 1. A retainer ring la secures the positions of the sleeve part 15' and spindle shaft 1 and/or groove 15'a and groove lb to each other, so that only with the generation of a pulling force in longitudinal upward direction of the spindle shaft 1, the parts 15', 10, 9<br>
5<br><br>
etc. can be taken off. Furthermore, a positive connection 17 is to be provided in the lower section of the sleeve part 15' and/or the spindle shaft 1. In figure 1 an indentation (teeth) is being indicated on the spindle shaft 1. A corresponding indentation (teeth), and/or serration or a thread, are to be provided on the inside of the sleeve part 15' within the section of the positive connection 17.<br>
In figure la an alternative embodiment of the positive connection 17 is illustrated. One part, for example the whorl 7 or the spindle shaft 1, is provided with at least one projection 7' corresponding to a tooth of an indentation (teeth). In figure la this projection 7' is illustrated as circle-cylindrical pin. When resting the clamping device 150, and/or the sleeve part 15', on the spindle shaft 1 and/or approaching the whorl 7, the sleeve part 15' must be held in such a way that a recess 15" comes to rest at the height of the projection 7' on the respective opposite part. When sliding-over the sleeve part 15', then said sleeve part moves with the recess 15" over the projection 7'. When rotating the sleeve part 15' according to figure la, the projection 7' slides to the left into a recess 15", so that a snap connection is being produced between the sleeve part 15' and the part 7 and/or the projection 7'.<br>
Within the lower section of the sleeve part 15' a cover ring 16 can be provided, which is pressed onto the sleeve part 15', in order to secure the compression spring 10 at the outer circumference of the sleeve part 15' and/or on the spacers 22 on the sleeve part 15'. As is to be seen from the left partial section of the cover ring 16 in figure 1, the lower part of the compression spring 10 can be enclosed by a rim 16', which centres the sliding sleeve 9 within the middle and lower section during the shifting motion of the sliding sleeve 9 on the sleeve part 15'.<br>
Above the spacers 22 and underneath the under-winding crown, and/or the cutting ring 15, a groove 15b can be seen in the left part of the vertical cross section in figure 1. The diameter of the groove 15b in relation to the outside diameter of the sleeve part 15' at the spacers 22 is dimensioned in such a way, that the piece of yarn of 3', which is put in<br><br>
circumferential direction on the spacers 22, when shifted by means of the sliding sleeve 9 during its upward motion, comprises such an oversize in upward direction in relation to the diameter of the groove 15b, that the piece of yarn of 3', within this section, comes to lie, without tension, between the clamping surface 14', toothed opposite each other, on the top side of the sliding sleeve 9 and on the lower surface of the upper rim on the sleeve part 15'. The under-winding crown, and/or the cutting ring 15, can be made as a one-piece part with the sleeve part 15', for example from polyamide reinforced with glass, or the cutting ring 15 and the sleeve part 15' are joined from two parts, whereby the cutting ring is being made from steel or light alloy. In this case the cutting ring 15, as is illustrated in the cross section at the left in figure 1, can be furnished with a rim 15a, and/or a projection, that engages into a groove 15'b, and/or a recess within the sleeve part 15'. While in the left part of the figure 1 the two-piece embodiment of a cutting ring 15 and sleeve part 15' is illustrated, one recognizes in the right part of figure 1, at the same height level, the one-piece version.<br>
The described embodiment of the yarn clamping device 150 has the advantage in relation to the conventional embodiment, that the spindle shaft 1 and the whorl 7, if necessary also a rotor of an electric motor connected with the whorl, can be manufactured separately from the yarn clamping device 150. During the final assembly of the spindle, thus the prefabricated structural unit of the yarn clamping device 150, consisting of the essential parts sleeve part 15', compression spring 10, sliding sleeve 9 etc. must only, without special tools, be slided from the top onto the spindle shaft 1 and over the positive connection 17 and together with this be brought into a non-shiftable position. During maintenance work the structural unit 150 can be easily replaced by the personnel in the spinning mill.<br>
Instead of the indentation (teeth) 17 a thread connection of the sleeve part 15' with the spindle shaft 1 can also be provided.<br>
Protruding ring parts 40 of the under-winding crown 15, within the diverting zone of the under-winding 45, can be provided with a cutting edge 44.<br><br><br>
