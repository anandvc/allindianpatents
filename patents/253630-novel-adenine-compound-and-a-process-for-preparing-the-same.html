				<td>SPECIFICATION 9-SUBSTITUTED 8-OXOADENINE COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel adenine compound useful as a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for viral diseases, allergic diseases, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Interferon is an endogenous protein having an important role in an immune system in mammals, and not only takes a partial role in a nonspecific defense mechanism in a living body but also strongly participates in a specific defense mechanism thereof.   Actually, interferon has been used as an agent for treating viral diseases such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C in a clinical field.    A low molecular weight organic compound (an interferon-inducing agent) which induces a biosynthesis of the said interferon has been developed as the next generation interferon therapy, including an imidazoquinoline derivative (refer to the patent document 1) and an adenine derivative (refer to the patent documents 2 and 3), and an imidazoquinoline derivative, Imiquimod has been used as an external antiviral agent for genital wart in a clinical field.<br>
On the other hand, T-cell taking a central role in an immune response in a living body is classified into two groups, Thl-cell and Th2-cell, and in a living body of a patient suffering from an allergic disease, an excess amount of cytokines such as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) is excreted from Th-2 cell, and thus a compound suppressing an immune response of Th2 cell can be expected as an agent for treating allergic diseases.<br>
The above imidazoquinoline derivative and adenine derivative have been known as showing a suppressing activity of production of interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-5 (IL-5) as well as an inducing activity of interferon, and have been actually known to be effective to an allergic disease also in a model animal.<br>
However, there is such a fear that systemic adverse effects based on the interferon inducing activity would be problem upon using such<br><br>
derivatives as an anti-allergic agent. [Patent Document 1] US Patent 4,689,338 [Patent Document 2] WO 98/01448 [Patent Document 3] WO 99/28321<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The problem to be solved by the present invention is to provide a novel 8-oxoadenine compound useful as an immuno-modulator and a therapeutic or prophylactic agent for allergic diseases, viral diseases and cancers comprising the said compound as an effective ingredient.<br>
The present inventors have made extensive study for obtaining an immuno-modulator useful as a therapeutic or a prophylactic agent for allergic diseases such as asthma, viral diseases and cancers to find the 8-oxoadenine compound of the present invention.   Namely, the compound of the present invention is an immuno-modulator having an immunoactivation effect such as an interferon inducing activity and also having a suppressing activity of production of a cytokine such as IL-4 and IL-5 originated from Th2-cell, and thus is effective as a therapeutic or prophylactic agent for allergic diseases, viral diseases and cancers.<br>

Example 12 Interferon inducing activity of rat spleen cells (in vitro)<br>
Spleen was removed from CD(SD)IGS rat (male; 8-10 weeks old).   A suspension of spleen cells of lxl07 cells/ml was prepared by using non serum MEN broth, and each 0.1 ml thereof was poured in a well of 96-well microplate.   The test sample diluted with the broth (containing 0.2% DMSO) in each 0.1 ml was poured in the well and incubated in 5% CO2 inbubator at 37°C for 24 hours.   The culture broth was centrifuged to give a supernatant of the incubation.    The interferon activity in the supernatant of the broth was quantitatively measured by the partially-improved bioassay method described in A. Armstrong, Methods in Enzymology 78, 381-7.    Namely after mouse fibroblast L929 in 4 x 104 cells/ 50μl was cultured in a 96-well culture plate for 7 hour, thereto was added 50μl of the diluted culture supernatant and the mixture was further<br><br>

After the cultured broth in each well was removed, each 100μl of vesicular stomatitis virus was added to each well and the effect of the cell denaturation 44 hours after the virus infection was confirmed by the neutral red stain.    In Table 30, an interferon inducing activity (minimum effective concentration) on each compound was shown.<br><br>
