  THE PATENTS ACT 1970<br>
[39 OF 1970]<br>
COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A PACKET FOR CIGARETES"<br>
G.D. S.p.A., an   Italian Company, of Via Pomponia   10, 40133 Bologna, Italy,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature oi the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
Description<br>
A packet for articles of elongated shape<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a packet for articles of elongated shape.<br>
More particularly, the present invention relates a packet for tobacco products such as cigarettes, cigars or the like, to which reference will be made throughout the following specification albeit with no limitation in scope implied; such a packet can be either of the soft type, or the rigid type with a hinged lid.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally speaking, the soft or 'crush1 type of cigarette packet is substantially parallelepiped in appearance and comprises an inner wrapper usually of paper or metal foil, fully enveloping a group of cigarettes, and an outer wrapper or label fashioned from a sheet of material, generally paper, folded in part about the inner wrapping in such a way that the top face of this same inner wrapping remains exposed.<br>
Similarly, a conventional cigarette packet of the rigid type with a hinged lid appears substantially as rectangular parallelepiped and comprises an outer wrapper of box-like embodiment fashioned from a precreased flat diecut blank, generally card or<br><br>
paperboard, also an inner wrapper normally of paper or metal foil accommodated internally of the outer wrapper, fully enveloping the group of cigarettes and identical in shape to the inner wrapper of the soft type of pack.<br>
The box-like outer wrapping typically comprises a container of cupped appearance, a lid likewise of cupped appearance hingedly associated with a rear top edge of the container, and a reinforcing frame disposed partly inside the container, which is anchored to a front face and to two side faces of the selfsame container.<br>
It is standard practice in the case both of soft cigarette packets and of rigid cigarette packets to affix a revenue stamp functioning as a seal and indicating that the packet is subject to an excise duty in the country of sale.<br>
It will be appreciated from the foregoing that the individual packet comprises a number of specific wrapping components, namely the inner wrapping and the outer wrapping, whether for cigarette packets of the soft type or for cigarette packets of the rigid type, also the revenue stamp, and the frame in the case of the rigid type packet.<br>
Cigarette packets of the types described above are generally enveloped and sealed within a protective overwrapping of transparent plastic film material, typically polypropylene, that serves to create a substantially airtight enclosure and<br><br>
maintain a desired level of moisture internally of the packet. The overwrapping generally incorporates a ribbon designed to facilitate the operation of breaking open the packet by establishing a looped tear line that extends around the lateral faces adjacent to the end face, in the case of a soft type cigarette packet, or to the lid in the case of a rigid packet with a hinged lid.<br>
It is also the practice in the tobacco industry to distribute packets of the two types in question with additional items such as cards, coupons and the like, bearing a variety of messages directed at the consumer. Such messages are often written, but more often pictorial, and might refer for example to competitions and prize draws or lotteries, and to other games of a similar nature.<br>
These additional inserts, especially when bearing pictures relative to prize draws, lotteries and similar games, are associated with the respective<br>
9<br>
packets  internally or externally,   as best  expedient for  the particular marketing   requirement,   and  in such  a  way  that   the  consumer  will  be  able  to  see the   illustrative  content   only  after  one  or more obligatory unwrapping steps have  been performed. The  decision  to  associate   these   additional inserts with  single packets of  cigarettes brings with it  a  serious  cost  drawback,   in  that  special  cigarette packaging machines  have  to be procured.<br><br>
The object of the invention is to provide a packet for articles of elongated shape, tobacco products in particular, such as will afford a simple and economic solution to the drawback in question.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
A packet according to the present invention for articles of elongated shape is of the type comprising a first inner wrapper enveloping a group of the articles and a second outer wrapper placed around the first wrapper, the first and second wrappers constituting specific packaging components of the packet, also removable concealing means intended to mask at least one predetermined area of at least one of the specific packaging components, wherein the removable concealing means consist in a layer of opaque material that is removable by scratching.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail, by way of example, with the aid of the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
-figs 1 and 2 illustrate two respective embodiments of a soft type of packet for tobacco products according to the present invention, viewed in perspective with one part cut away for clarity; -figs 3 and 4 illustrate two further respective embodiments of a soft type of packet for tobacco products according to the present invention, viewed fragmentarily in perspective with one part cut away for clarity;<br><br>
-fig 5 illustrates an embodiment of a packet for tobacco products of the rigid type with a hinged lid, according to the present invention, viewed in perspective with one part cut away for clarity; -figs 6, 7 and 8 illustrate three further respective embodiments of a rigid packet with a hinged lid according to the present invention, viewed fragmentarily in perspective with one part cut away for clarity.<br>
Referring to the drawings, 1 denotes a packet, in its entirety, serving to contain an ordered group of cigarettes (not illustrated) enveloped entirely by an inner wrapper 2 fashioned from metal foil paper and appearing substantially parallelepiped in shape, with four side faces 3 (illustrated in part only), a bottom end face (not illustrated) and a top end face 4.<br>
In each of the packets 1 illustrated, the inner wrapper 2 is accommodated internally of an outer wrapper denoted 5; in the examples of figs 1 to 4 which relate to a soft type of packet 1, the outer wrapper 5 appears as a label 6 enveloping all of the inner wrapper 2 except for the top end face 4, whereas in the examples of figs 5 to 8 which relate tea packet 1 of the rigid type with a hinged lid, the outer wrapper 5 appears as a container 7 of cupped appearance surmounted by a lid 8, likewise of cupped appearance, hingedly associated with the container 7 along a rear edge 9 (visible only in fig 8) and rotatable thus<br><br>
between a position in which the packet 1 is closed (as in figs 5, 6, 7 and 8) and a position in which the  packet   is  open   (not  illustrated) .<br>
The  rigid type of packet   1  also  comprises  an  inner reinforcing frame  10  disposed partly inside  the container 7,   which is  fixed to a  front  face  11  and two flank faces 12  of  the  selfsame  container.<br>
The  single packet  1   is thus  composed of specific packaging components  13,   and more  exactly the  inner<br>
    wrapper  2,   the  outer  wrapper  5,   whether  a   label   6 as   in  the  case  of   the   soft   type   of  packet   or  a container 7 and lid 8  as  in the  case of  the rigid type of packet,   and the inner frame  10   likewise in the  case of the  rigid packet.<br>
 	Each packet   1,   be   it  of   the   soft   type  or  the<br>
rigid type,   exhibits a revenue stamp 14  constituting a further specific packaging component  13  that  serves both to establish a seal  when applied to  the packet  and to indicate that  an excise duty  is  payable on the<br>
     contents.<br>
In the soft type of packet 1, the revenue stamp 14 is applied straddling the top end face 4 of the inner wrapper 2 and with the two longitudinal ends affixed to the top edge of the label 6, whereas in the rigid type<br>
   of packet 1 the stamp 14 is applied to a rear face 15 of the wrapper 5, coinciding with the hinge edge 9.<br>
Each packet 1 illustrated, soft type and rigid type alike, comprises a removable concealing element 16 designed to mask a predetermined area 17 of one of the<br><br>
specific packaging components 13 making up the packet 1. In practice, the concealing element 16 consists in a layer of opaque material that can be removed by scratching, and the hidden area 17 will exhibit at least one item of print, an image 18 in the example indicated, carrying a message targeted directly at the consumer, typically a competition or prize draw. The concealing element 16 is shown partly removed in figs 1 to 8, in the interests of clarity.<br>
In the examples of figs 1 and 5, the concealing element 16 masks a predetermined area 17 afforded by the external surface 19 of the outer wrapper 5, whereas in figs 2, 3 and 6 the element 16 conceals a predetermined area 17 afforded by the external surface 20 of the inner wrapper 2. More precisely, in the packet 1 of fig 1, the element 16 conceals a predetermined area 17 afforded by a front face 21 of the label 6; in the packet 1 of fig 5, the element 16 conceals a predetermined area 17 of a front face 11 of the container 7; in the packet 1 of fig 2, the element 16 conceals a predetermined area 17 of the top end face 4 of the inner wrapper 2; in the packet 1 of fig 3, the element conceals a predetermined area 17 afforded by a flank face 3 of the inner wrapper 2; and in the packet 1 of fig 6, the element 16 conceals a predetermined area 17 of the face 3 of the inner wrapper 2 that coincides with the front face 11 of the container 7. In this latter instance, the concealed area 17 forms part of a portion 22 of the relative side face 3 that<br><br>
projects from a front face 23 of the frame 10.<br>
In the example of fig 7, the concealing element 16 masks a predetermined area 17 of the outer surface presented by the front face 23 of the frame 10. In particular, the area 17 in question forms part of a portion 24 of the face 23 that projects from the container 7.<br>
Finally, in the examples of fig 4 and fig 8, the concealing element 16 masks a predetermined area 17 of the external surface presented by the revenue stamp 14.<br>
In other versions of the soft and/or rigid packet 1 (not illustrated), the element 16 might conceal a predetermined area 17 of the internal surface of the inner wrapper 2 and/or of the outer wrapper 5 and/or of the frame 10 and/or of the stamp 14.<br>
Finally, the single packets 1 can be overwrapped in familiar manner with an additional outer sheet (not indicated) of transparent plastic material (such as polypropylene) of which the function is to create a substantially hermetic seal around the packet 1 and maintain a given level of moisture in the contents. Likewise in familiar manner, the plastic material can incorporate a tear ribbon (not indicated) that will extend in a loop around the side faces of the finished packet 1 and thus facilitate the operation of breaking open the overwrapping.<br><br>
