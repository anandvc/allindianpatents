Detailed Description of Specific Embodiments<br>
Each of the embodiments is directed to a cradle which can be utilised with a guide whereby the cradle supports a powered hand tool which takes the form of a planer or alternatively a router and which can be utilised with a guide to finish a work<br>
piece formed of timber.  The cradle can be formed of any suitable timber and/or<br>
i<br>
metallic and/or plastics as can be the guide.<br>
The first embodiment of the invention as illustrated at Figures 1 to 4 comprises a cradle 11 which is adapted to clampingly support a hand planer 13., The hand planer is of a substantially conventional form and incorporates a cutting element which is associated with a planar cutting face 17 which is formed with a slot through which the cutting element is able to access a work piece.<br>
The cradle 11 comprises a' base 19 which is of a generally rectangular configuration and is farmed with a central aperture to provide a frame around the aperture whereby the planer 13 is receivable on the cradle 11 such that one side edge of the cutting face 15 will rest on the upper surface of the cradle 11.<br>
The cradle 11 is intended for use with a guide 21 as illustrated at Figures 3 and 4 where the guide 21 is provided with a substantially horizontal support face 23 which terminates at its inner end with a guide face 25 which extends upwardly from the support face 23 to be perpendicular thereto and extends for the length of the support face 23, The cradle 11 is provided with a lower face 27 which is intended to be supported from the support face 23 and a side face 29 which is intended to be in face to face relationship with the guide face 25. The lower face 27 is provided with a number of first supports 28 (shown in Figure 2) which extend downwardly from the lower face in order to space the lower face from the support face 23 in a parallel face to face relationship. The supports enable the cradle to be readily capable of slldable movement over the support face 23 with the minimum of friction as a result of both their configuration and the material of which they are formed. Similarly the side face 29 is provided with a set of second supports 31 which when the side face 29 is in face to face relationship with the guide face 25, the second supports 31 slidably engage the guide face 25 to<br><br>
support the side face 29 in spaced face to face relation from the guide face 25. In addition the second supports, by their configuration and the material of which they are formed, are capable of ready slidable movement along guide face 25 with the minimum of friction.<br>
The base 19 is associated with pair of upstanding support posts 33 which are located at either end of the base. Each support post is associated with a clamping element 35 which is fixed to the upper end of the support post 33 by an adjustment means comprising a pair of threaded nuts threadably received on the threaded post 33. The clamping members 35 extend in a cantilever fashion from the support post 33 and are provided with a bearing element on the under face of the outer end which is capable of bearing upon the chassis of the pianer 13 by adjustment of the position of the clamping members 35 on the support post 33. The height of the clamping members from the base 19 can be adjusted to accommodate for planers of differing dimensions. In addition, a guard plate 41 is ciampingly received between the bearing members 37 and the chassis 39 of the hand tool to be ciampingly retained in position such that it extends beyond the edge of the cutting face in opposed parallel relation to the guide.<br>
As illustrated at Figures 3 and 4 the cradle is utilised to support a planer and to enable the planer to be positioned on the guide such that the cutting face 15 is located above the guide face 25 of the guide. The guide face 25 is associated with a support surface 30 which extends perpendicularly from the guide face 25 in opposed relation to the support face 23 and which is intended to support a work piece W. In use the work piece W is fixed in position on the support surface 30 by suitable clamps C such that the edge which is to be worked is located in general alignment with the guide face 25 and a sufficient distance from the guide face 25 such that it will be engaged by the cutting element of the planer 13.<br>
In use, once the work piece W is located in position, the planer is positioned on the guide 21 such that the side face 29 of the base 19 is in engagement with the guide face 25 or as close to the guide face 25 as the exposed edge of the work piece W will allow. By longitudinal movement of the cradle 11 over the support face 23, the exposed;edge of the work piece W will be worked by the planer 13 to<br>
8<br><br>
bring the worked edg'b into parallel relationship with the guide face 25. As shown at Figures 3 and 4 the work piece W may comprise a piece of timber which is located longitudinally, parallel with the guide face 25 as shown in Figure 4 or may be located oblique to the guide face 25 as illustrated at Figure 4. In addition, as shown at Figure 4, the support for the work piece W can include a fence element F which is located along the trailing edge of the work piece W in order to support that trailing edge of the work piece in the region where it is being worked by the cutting element to prevent chipping of the trailing edge.<br>
In order to stabilise the cradle 11 In its movement along the support face 23, and to prevent lateral movement of the cradle 11 away from the guide face 25, the support face 23 may incorporate a support element in the form of a rib element (not shown) which is positioned in spaced parallel relation from the guide face 25 at a distance corresponding to the width of the cradle 11 such that in use the cradle 11 will be received between the rib element and the guide face 25. The presence of the rib element serves to prevent lateral displacement of the cradle 11 away from the guide face 25 in its longitudinal movement along the support face 23. According to a variation of the embodiment, the rib element may be formed such that it engages a formation on the cradle 11 to prevent relative displacement between the exterior side face 43 of the cradle 11 and the support face 23 at the point of support between the rib element and the cradle 11.<br>
According to a further variation of the first embodiment, the support surface 30 of the guide 21 may be pivotally supported, or capable of pivotal movement, about an axis parallel with the upper edge of the guide face 25 such that the inclination of the support surface 30 which accommodates the work piece W can be varied. Suitable locking means is provided between the guide 21 and the support surface 30 to maintain the support surface in the desired angular disposition relative to the guide face 25.<br>
In addition, the support surface 30 of the guide 21 can be provided with slotted openings and/or grooves which can be transverse to the guide face 25 and/or parallel to the guide face 25 and which are capable of supporting fence elements, bevel guides or stops which are utilised to locate a work piece in the desired<br><br>
provided with a suitable clamping means to enable them to be clampingly positioned to the support surface in order to provide a rigid support for the work piece.<br>
According to a second embodiment of the invention, as illustrated at Figure 5 (the same reference numerals have been used as those used in respect of first embodiment of Figures 1 to 4), the base 19 of the cradle is formed with a lower portion 19A and an upper portion 19B which are hingedly interconnected by a hinge which is located at the side face 29. Suitable locking mechanisms 47 are provided between the portions 19A and 19B at each end of the base in order that the desired angular disposition of the upper portion 19B relative to the lower portion 19A can be fixed. The locking mechanism as shown at Figure 5 comprises an elongate link 49 which is pivotally mounted at one end to the upper portion 19B. The elongate link 49 is provided with a slotted opening at its other end where the axis of the slot is substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of the elongate member 49. The slot is associated with a stud provided on the lower portion 19A which is associated with a suitable wing nut in order that the elongate member can be locked into position.<br><br>
The third embodiment of the invention, as shown at Figures 6 to 8, comprises a cradle 111 which can be utilised to support a router in association with the guide and which can take the same form as that as described in relation to the first and second embodiments at Figures 1 to 5. The cradle 111 comprises a base 119 which is receivable on the support surface 23 and has side face 129 which is slidably engageable with the guide face of the guide as in the case of the previous embodiments. The base 119 has an upper support plate 149 which is adjustably<br>
mounted to the base 119 and which extends in a cantilever fashion from the base<br>
119 and where the cantilevered portion is configured to receive the face plate of a<br>
router (not shown) which defines the cutting face of the router such that the router bit extends downwardly from the support plate 149 into a position above the guide. The support plate is formed with a circular recess on its upper face which will receive the face plate of the router and which is formed with a keyhole like opening at its centre which enables the cutting tool to extend through the centre of<br>
10<br><br>
the opening when the router is supported by the support plate 149 and which will enable the router to be engaged with, and disengaged from, the support plate 149. The recess is associated with a plurality of clamping elements which are located at angularly spaced intervals around the perimeter of the recess and which are able to clampingly engage the exposed face of the face plate of the router to hold it in position on the support plate 149. The base 119 may be provided with a set of spacer elements 151 which can be introduced between the base 119 and the support plate 149 or removed therefrom in order to vary the spacing of the router element from the guide, in addition to variation in spacing which can be achieved through the axial movement which is available for the router bit as a result of the inherent adjustment characteristics of the router.<br>
A general arrangement according to the third embodiment (router not shown) is shown in Figure 8. In that arrangement, the support surface is provided with a groove 126 which may be used to slidably locate a bevel gauge 127 (or other element as described above). The cradle 111 may be utilised in the same manner as the cradle of the previous embodiments (although the bevel gauge may need to be removed) in order that the cutter bit of the router can be moved in association with an exposed edge of a work piece in order to work that work piece.<br>
In the case of the fourth embodiment (not shown) the guide face 125 is provided by a profiled template which is mounted to the guide face 25 of the guide 21 and which defines a guide face 125 which is non-linear for at least a portion of the longitudinal extent of the guide face 125. In such an instance, the second support members 131 which support the side face 129 of the cradle 111 from the guide face 125 are formed as post elements or like elongate elements and are spaced and dimensioned such that they will remain in contact with the contoured guide face 125 throughout the longitudinal movement of the cradle 111 relative to the guide face 125. In this regard, the rib element which locates the opposed side of the cradle 111 to guide face 25 would be connected to the cradle 111 by utilisation of adjustment means which will allow for the relative lateral displacement of the 'cradle 111 with respect to the rib but which will prevent the displacement of the outer side of the cradle 111 from the support face 23.<br><br>
In the case of the fifth embodiment, as illustrated at Figures 9 and 10, the guide face 125 is provided by an elongate template 128 which is rotatably supported at<br>
I!<br>
either end between a pair of opposed chucks which are in turn supported by a pair<br>
of upstanding brackets 153. The template 128 has a guide face125 which has a<br>
three dimensional shape which is to be copied (such as a spiral spindle as shown<br>
at Figure 10). The upstanding brackets 153 further rotatably support a work piece<br>
W in substantially parallel, vertically-spaced relation from the guide face 125. The<br>
guide, illustrated at'Figures 9 and 10, is utilised with a router supported from a<br>
cradle according to the third embodiment as illustrated at Figures 6, 7 and 8 such<br>
that the second support members 131 on the side face 129 of the base 119 are in<br>
engagement with the surface of the guide face 125 while the router 161 is<br>
supported from the mounting plate 149 such that the router bit 163 will engage<br>
with the work piece W. The rotatable supports for the guide face 125 and the<br>
work piece W are interconnected by a suitable pulley belt 155 and are driven<br>
either manually or through a suitable drive motor such that they will rotate<br>
simultaneously.	<br>
The cradle base 119 of the cradle is further supported by an elongate guide<br>
ii element in the form of an upstanding rib 157 provided on the support face 123 in<br>
parallel spaced relation from the guide face 125 and the base 119 is supported from the upstanding rib 157 by a support element in the form of a plurality of elongate peg members 165 provided at their outer end with sockets 167.   The<br>
sockets 167 are engageable over the rib 157 and enable the pegs 165 to slide<br>
i) longitudinally along the rib 157 but to resist lateral movement of the outer end of<br>
the pegs 165 from the rib 157. The inner portions of the pegs 165 are received in bores 169 provided in the base 119 such that the pegs 165 are slidable transversely within the base 119. The utilisation of the pegs 165 in association with the rib 157 stabilises the cradle 111 in its longitudinal movement along the support face 123 and prevents displacement of the cradle 111 away from the support face 123 and at the same time will permit transverse movement of the cradle on the support face 123 as a result of the contours of the guide face 125. The fifth embodiment thus enables the three dimensional shape of a guide face to be copied onto a workpiece.<br>
