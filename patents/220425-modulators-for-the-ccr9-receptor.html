RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]	This application claims priority to U.S. provisional<br>
application Serial No. 60/427,670 filed November 18,2002. The disciosurs of the priority application is incorporated by reference hereto in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	The present invention provides compounds,<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of those compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts which are effective in inhibiting the binding or function of various chemokines to receptors, such the chemckine TECK to the CCR9 receptor. As antagonists or modulators for the CCR9 receptor, the compounds and compositions have utility In treating inflammatory and immune disorder conditions and diseases.<br>
f0003]	Chemokines are chemotadic cytokines that ere released<br>
by a wide variety of cells and attract various types of Immune system cells, such as macrophages, T cells, eosinophils, basophils and neutrophils, to sites of inflammation (reviewed in Schall, Cytokine, 3:165-183 (1991), Schall. et a/., Curr. Opin. Immunol., 6:865 873 (1994) and Murphy, Rev. Immun&gt;r 12:593-633 (1994)). In addition to stimulating chemotaxis, other changes can be selectively induced by chemokines in responsive cells, including changes in cell shape, transient rises m the concentration of intraceRular free calcium ions ([Ca2+]), granule exocytosfs, integrin up-regulation, formation of bioactive lipids (e.g., leukotrienes) and respiratory burst, associated with leukocyte activation. Thus, the chemokines are early triggers of the inflammatory response, causing inflammatory mediator release, chemotaxis and extravasation to sites of infection or inflammation.<br>
[0004]	T lymphocyte (T cell) infiltration into the small intestine<br>
and colon has been Finked to the pathogenesis of coeliac diseases, food allergies, rheumatoid arthritis, human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD)<br><br>
which include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Blocking trafficking of relevant T cell populations to the intestine can tead to an effective approach to treat human IBD. More recently, chemokine receptor 9 (CCR9) has been noted to be expressed on gut-homing T ceils in peripheral blood, elevated in patients with small bowel inflammation such as Crohn's disease and celiac disease- The only CCR9 llgand Identified to date, TECK (thymus-expressed chemokine) is expressed in the small intestine and the llgand receptor pair is now thought to play a pivotal role in the development of IBD. In particular, this pair mediates the migration of disease causing T ceils to the intestine. See for example, Zabatlos, ef a/,t J. Immunol., 162(10):5871-5675 (1999); Kunkel, et al., J. Exp. Med 192(5):761-768 (2000); Papadakis, et a/., J. Immunol. &gt; 165(9):5069~5076 (2000); Papadakis, eteL Gastroenterology* 121(2):246-254 (2001); CampbeU, etaL% J. Exp. Mod., 195(1):135*141 (2002); Wurbel, et at. Blood, 98(9);2626-2632 (2001); and Uehara, et a/.. 1 Immunol, 158(6)2811-2819 (2002).<br>

Compounds that Modulate CCR9 Activity<br>
[0043]	The present friverrtion provides compounds that modulate<br>
CCR9 activity. Specifically, the invention provides compounds having antiinflammatory or kraiunoregulatory activity. The compounds of the invention are thought to interfere with inappropriate T-cell trafficking by specifically modulating or inhibiting a chemokine receptor function. Chemokine receptors are integral membrane proteins which interact with an extracellular Iigand, such as a chemokine, and mediate a cellular response to the Iigand, e.g., chemotaxis, increased intracellular calcium ion concentration, etc. Therefore, modulation of a chemokine receptor function, e.g., interference with a chemokine receptor Iigand interaction, will modulate a chemokine receptor mediated response, and treat or prevent a chemokine receptor mediated condition or disease. Modulation of a chemokine receptor function includes both inducement and inhibition of the function. The type of modulation accomplished will depend on the characteristics of the compound, i.e., antagonist or full, partial or inverse agonist.<br><br>
£0044]	Without intending to be bound by any particular theory, it<br>
is believed that the compounds provided herein interfere with the interaction between a chemokine receptor and one or more cognate ligands. In particular, it is believed that the compounds interfere with the interaction between CCR9 and a CCR9 ligand, such as TECK, Compounds contemplated by the invention include, but are not limited to, the exemplar/ compounds provided herein and salts thereof.<br>
[0045]	For example, compounds of this invention act as potent<br>
CCR9 antagonists, and tNs antagonistic activity has been further confirmed in animal testing for inflammation, one of the hallmark disease states for CCR9. Accordingly, the compounds provided herein are useful In pharmaceutical compositions, methods for the treatment of CCR9-rnediated diseases, and as controls in assays for the identification of competitive CCR9 antagonists.<br>
CCR9 antagonists as treatments of clncer<br>
[0046]	In additional to inflammatory diseases, cancers that are<br>
caused by uncontrolled proliferation of T cells may be treated with a CCR9 antagonist Certain types of cancer are caused by T ceils expressing chemokine receptor CCR9* For example, thymoma and thymic carcinoma are diseases in which cancer cells are found in the tissues of the thymus, an organ where lymphocyte development occurs. T cells in the thymus, called thymocytes, are known to express functional CCR9; its tigand is highly expressed in the thymus. Another example is the acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), also called acute lymphoblastic leukemia and acute, is a common leukemia, which can occur in children as wefl as adults. Recent studies have shown that T cells in patients with ALL selectively express high level of CCR9 (Qhjplng Zet at, Cancer Res. 2003,1;63(19):6469-77)<br>
£0047]	Chemokine receptors have been implicated in cancer.<br>
Although the exact mechanisms of chemokfrie receptors' involvements have yet to be full- understood, such receptors are known to promote the growth of cancer cells (proliferation), facilitate the spread of cancer cells (metastasis) or help them resist program cell death (apoptosrs). For example, CCR9 in a<br><br>
cancer T cell line MOLT-4 provides the cells with a survival signal, allowing them to resist apoptosis (Youn BS, et al., Apoptosis. 2002 Jun;7(3):271-6).

Measuring efficacy of CCR9 modulators In vitro assays<br>
[00179]       A variety of assays can be used to evaluate the compounds provided herein, including signaling assays, migration assays, and other assays of cellular response. CCR9 receptor signaling assays can be used to measure the ability of a compound, such as a potential CCR9 antagonist to block CCR9 ligand- (e.g. TECK)4nduced signaling. A migration assay can be used to measure the ability of a compound of interest, such as a possible CCR9 antagonist, to block CCR9-mediated cell migration in vitro. The latter is believed to resemble chemokine-induced cell migration in vivo.<br>
[00180]       In a suitable assay, a CCR9 protein (whether isolated or recombinant) is used which has at least one property, activity, or functional characteristic of a mammalian CCR9 protein. The property can be a binding property (to, for example, a ligand or inhibitor), a signaling activity (e.g., activation of a mammalian G protein, induction of rapid and transient increase in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium [Ca++]), cellular response function (e.g., stimulation of chemotaxis or inflammatory mediator release by leukocytes), and the like.<br><br>
[00181]        The assay can be a cell based assay that utilizes cells stably or transiently transfected with a vector or expression cassette having a nucleic acid sequence which encodes the CCR9 receptor. The cells are maintained under conditions appropriate for expression of the receptor and are contacted with a putative agent under conditions appropriate for binding to occur. Binding can be detected using standard techniques. For example, the extent of binding can be determined relative to a suitable control (for example, relative to background in the absence of a putative agent, or relative to a known ligand). Optionally, a cellular fraction, such as a membrane fraction, containing the receptor can be itsed in Heu of whole cells.<br>
[00182]        Detection of binding or complex formation can be detected directly or indirectly. For exampfe, the putative agent can be labeled with a suitable label (e.gM fluorescent label, chemiluminescent label, isotope label, enzyme label, and the like) and binding can be determined by detection of the label. Specific and/or competitive binding can be assessed by competition or displacement studies, using unlabeled agent or a ligand (e.g., TECK) as a competitor.<br>
[00183]       Binding inhibition assays can be used to evaluate the present compounds. In these assays, the compounds are evaluated as inhibitors of ligand binding using, for example, TECK. In this embodiment, the CCR9 receptor is contacted with a ligand such as TECK and a measure of ligand binding is made. The receptor is then contacted with a test agent in the presence of a ligand (e.g., TECK) and a second measurement of binding is made. A reduction in the extent of ligand binding is indicative of inhibition of binding by the test agent The binding inhibition assays can be carried out using whole cells which express CCR9, or a membrane fraction from cells which express CCR9.<br>
[00184]       The binding of a G protein coupled receptor by, for example, an agonist, can result in a signaling event by the receptor. Accordingly, signaling assays can also be used to evaluate the compounds of the present invention and induction of signaling function by an agent can be monitored using any suitable method. For example, G proteip activity, such<br><br>
as hydrolysis of GTP to GDPT or later signaling events triggered by receptor binding can be assayed by known methods (see, for exarnple,<br>
PCT/US97/15915; Neote, etai, Cell, 72:415425 (1993); Van Riper, etal.t J. Exp. Med, 177:851-356 (1993) and Dahinden, et a/., J. Exp. Med&gt; 179:751-756(1994)).<br>
[00185]        Chemotaxis assays can also be used to assess receptor function and evaluate the compounds provided herein. These assays are based on the functional migration of cells in vitro or in vivo induced by an agent, and can be used to assess the binding and/or effect on chemotaxis of ligands, inhibitors, or agonists. A variety of chemotaxis assays are known in the art, and any suitable assay can be used to evaluate the compounds of the present invention. Examples of suitable assays include those described in PCT/US97/15915; Springer, etat.f WO 94/20142; Berman ef a/M Immunol. Invest, 17:625-677 (1988); and Kavanaugh et a/., J. Immunol, 146:4149-4156 (1991)).<br>
[00188]        Calcium signaling assays measure calcium concentration over tfme, preferably before and after receptor binding. These assays can be used to quantify the generation of a receptor signaling mediator, Ca*4", following receptor binding (or absence thereof). These assays are useful in determining the ability of a compound, such as those of the present invention, to generate the receptor signaling mediator by binding to a receptor of interest. Also, these assays are useful in determining the ability of a compound, such as those of the present invention, to inhibit generation of the receptor signaling mediator by interfering with binding between a receptor of interest and a ligand.<br>
[00187]       In calcium signaling assays used to determine the ability of a compound to interfere with binding between CCR9 and a known CCR9 ligand, CCR9-expressing cells (such as a T cell line MOLT-4 cells) are first incubated with a compound of interest, such as a potential CCR9 antagonist, at increasing concentrations. The cell number can be from 105 to 5X105 cells per well in a 96-well microtiter plate. The concentration of the compound being tested may rap.ge from 0 to 100 pM. After a period of incubation (which<br><br>
can range from 5 to 60 minutes), the treated ceils are placed in a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR^ (available from Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The FLIPR system is well known to those skilled in the art as a standard method of performing assays. The cells are then stimulated with an appropriate amount of the CCR9 ligand TECK (e.g. 5-100 nM final concentration) and the signal of intracellular calcium increase (also called calcium flux) is recorded. The efficacy of a compound as an inhibitor of binding between CCR9 and the ligand can be calculated as an 1C50 (the concentration needed to cause 50% inhibition in signaling) or IC90 (at 90% inhibition).<br>
[00188]        In vitro cell migration assays can be performed (but are not limited to this format) using the 96-wetI microchamber (called ChemoTX™). The ChemoTX system is well known to those skilled in the art as a type of chemotactic/cell migration instrument In this assay, CCR9-expressing cells (such as MQLT-4) are first incubated with a compound of interest, such as a possible CCR9 antagonist, at increasing concentrations. Typically, fifty thousand cells per well are used, but the amount can range from 103-105 cells per well. CCR9 ligand TECK, typically at 50 nM (but can range from 5-100 nM), is placed at the lower chamber and the migration apparatus is assembled. Twenty microliters of test compound-treated cells are then placed onto the membrane. Migration is allowed to take place at 37 C for a period of time, typically 2.5 hours. At the end of the incubation, the number of cells that migrated across the membrane into the lower chamber is then quantified. The efficacy of a compound as an inhibitor of CCR9-mediated cell migration is calculated as an IC50 (the concentration needed to reduce cell migration by 50%) or IC90 (for 90% inhibition).<br>
In vivo efficacy models for human IBD<br>
[00189]        T cell infiltration into the small intestine and colon have been linked to the pathogenesis of human inflammatory bowel diseases which include Coeliac disease, Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Blocking trafficking of relevant T cell populations to the intestine is believed to be an effective approach to treat human IBD. CCR9 is expressed on gut-homing T<br><br>
cells in peripheral blood, elevated in patients with small bowel inflammation such as Crohn's disease stnd Coefiac disease. CCR9 ligand TECK is expressed in the small intestine. It is thus believed that this ligand-recepior pair plays a role in IBD development by mediating migration of T cells to the intestine. Several animal nodels exist and can be used for evaluating compounds of interest, such as potential CCR9 antagonists, for an ability to affect such T cell migration and/or condition or disease, which might allow efficacy predictions of antagonists in humans.<br>
Animal models with pathology similar to human ulcerative colitis<br>
[00190]        A murine model described by Panwala and coworkers (Panwala, et aL, J ImmunoL 161(10):5733-44 (1998)) involves genetic deletion of the murine mufli-drug resistant gene (MDR). MDR knockout mice (MDR-/-) are susceptible to developing a severe, spontaneous intestinal inflammation when maintained under specific pathogen-free facility conditions. The intestinal inflammatior seen in MDR-/- mice has a pathology similar to that of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and is defined by Th1 type T cells infiltration into the lamina propria of the large intestine.<br>
J Exp Med., 184(1):241-51 defeted and mice rendered<br>
[00191]        Another murine model was described by Davidson et a/.,<br>
(1986). In this model, the murine IL-10 gene was deficient in the production of interleukin 10 (IL-10-/-). These mice develop a ckhronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that predominates In the colon sand shares histopathological features with human<br>
IBD.<br>
[00192]       Another murine model for IBD has been described by<br>
Powrie et at., Int Immunol., 5(11):1461-71 (1993), in which a subset of CD4+ T cells (called CD45RB(hrgh)) from immunocompetent mice are purified and adoptively transferred into immunodeficient mice (such as C.B-17 scid mice). The animal restored with the CD45RBhighCD4+ T cell population developed a<br><br>
lethal wasting disease with<br><br>
severe mononuclear cell infiltrates in the colon,<br><br>
pathologically similar with human IBD.<br>
Murine models with patholcgy similar to human Crohn's disease<br><br>
[00193]        The TNF AREfV-1 model. The role of TNF in Crohn's disease in human has been demonstrated more recently by success of treatment using anti-TNF alpha antibody by Targan et a/., N Engl J Med, 337(15):1O29-35 (1997). Mice with aberrant production of TNF-alpha due to genetic alteration in the TNF gene (ARE-/-) develop Crohn's-Iike inflammatory bowel diseases (see Kontoyiannis et a/., Immunity, 10(3):387-98 (1999)).<br>
[00194]        The SAMP/yit model. This is model described by Kosiewicz ef ait J Clin Invest, 107(6):695-7O2 (2001). The mouse strain, SAMP/Yit spontaneously develops a chronic inflammation localized to the terminal iieum. The resulting ileitis is characterized by massive infiltration of activated T lymphocytes into the lamina propria, and bears a remarkable resemblance to human Crohn's disease.<br>
Example 40<br>
[00195]       This example illustrates the activity associated with representative compounds of the invention. Materials and Methods (in vitro assays)<br>
Reagents and cells<br>
[00196]        MOLT-4 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMl tissue culture medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37° C. Recombinant human chemokine protein TECK was obtained from R&amp;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). ChemoTX® chemotaxis microchambers were purchased from Neuro Probe (Gaithersburg, MD). CyQUANT9 cell proliferation kits were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, Oregon). Calcium indicator dye Fluo-4 AM was purchased from Molecular Devices (Mountain View, CA).<br>
Conventional migration assay<br>
[00197]       Conventional migration assay was used to determine the<br>
m<br>
efficacy of potential receptor antagonists in blocking migration mediated<br><br>
through CCR9. This assay was routinely performed using the ChemoTX microchamber system with a 5-urn pore-sized polycarbonate membrane. To begin such an assay, MOLT-4 ceils were harvested by centrifugation of ceil suspension at 1000 PRM on a GS-6R Beckman centrifuge. The cell pellet was ^suspended in chemotaxis buffer (HBSS with 0,1% BSA) at 5x105 cells/mL Test compounds at desired concentrations were prepared from 10 mM stock solutions by serial dilutions in chemotaxis buffer. An equal volume of cells and compounds were mixed and incubated at room temperature for 15 minutes. Afterwards, 20 p.L of the mixture was transferred onto the porous membrane of a migration microchamber, with 29 \iL of 50 nM chemokine TECK protein placed at the lower chamber. Following a 150-minute incubation at 37° C, during which celts migrated against the chemokine gradient the assay was terminated by removing the cell drops from atop the filter. To quantify cells migrated across the membrane, 5 ^L of 7X CyQUANT0 solution was added to each well in the lower chamber,.and the fluorescence signal measured on a Speptrafluor Plus fluorescence plate reader (TECAN, Durham, NC). The degree of inhibition was determined by comparing migration signals between compound-treated and untreated cells. IC50 calculation was further performed by non-linear squares regression analysis using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software, San DiegoT CA).<br>
RAM assay<br>
£00198]       The primary screen to identify CCR9 antagonists was carried out using PvAM assay (WO O2101350), which detects potential hits by their ability to activate cell migration under inhibitory TECK concentration. To begin such an assay, MOLT-4 celis were harvested by centrifugation of cell suspension at 1000 RPM on a GS-6R Beckman centrifuge. The cell pellet was resuspended in chemotaxis buffer (HBSS/0.1% BSA) at 5x10s cells/mL Twenty-five microliters of cells was mixed with an equal volume of a test compound diluted to 20 jiM in the same buffer. Twenty microliters of the mixture was transferred onto the filter in the upper chemotaxis chamber, with<br><br>
29 pL of 500 nM chemokine protein TECK placed in the lower chamber Following a 150-minute incubation at 37° C, the assay was terminated by rernovfng the cell drops from atop the filter To quantify cells migrated across the membrane, 5 \xL of 7X CyQUANT® solution was added to each well in the lower chamber, and the fluorescence signal measured on a Spectrafluor Plus fluorescence plate reader (TECAN, Durham, NC),<br>
[00199]        For selection of potential hits, the level of migration activation was calculated as a RAM index-the ratio between the signal of a particular well and the median signal of the whole plate. Compounds with a RAM index of greater than 1.8 were regarded as RAM positive, and were selected for IC50 determinations in conventional functional assays.<br>
Calcium flux assay<br>
[0O200]        Calcium fiux assay measures an increase in intracellular calcium following iigand-induced receptor activation. In the screen of CCR9 antagonists, it was used as a secondary assay carried out on a FLIPR® machine (Molecular Devices, Mountain View. CA). To begin an assay, MOLT-4 cells were harvested by centrifugation of cell suspension, and resuspended to 1.5x106 cells/mL in HBSS (with 1 % fetal calf serum). Cells were then labeled with a calcium indicator dye Fluo-4 AM for 45 minutes at 37° C with gentle shaking. Following incubation, cells were pelfetted, washed once with HBSS and resuspended in the same buffer at a density of 1.6x10s cells/mL. One hundred microliters of labeled cells were mixed with 10 (±L of test compound at the appropriate concentrations on an assay plate. Chemokine protein TECK was added at a final concentration of 25 nM to activate the receptor. The degree of inhibition was determined by comparing calcium signals betweeen compound-treated and untreated cells. ICSO calculations were further performed by non-linear squares regression analysis using Graphpad Prism (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA).<br>
Discovery of CCR9 antagonists<br><br>
[0O201]        The discovery of CCR9 antagonists was carried out in two steps: First, RAM assay was used to screen a compound library in a high-throughput manner. The assay detected compounds by their ability to cause a positive migration signal under RAM condition. Secondly, RAM positive compounds were tested to determine their ICsoS using the conventional migration and calcium flux assays.<br>
[0O2O2]        For instance, in a screen of approximately 100,000 compounds, 2000 individual wells representing approximately 2% of total compounds showed a RAM index greater than 1.8, These compounds were cheery-picked and retested in duplicate wells by RAM assay. A total of 270 compounds, or 0.27% of the library, were confirmed RAM positives.<br>
[0O203]        Since a RAM positive signal indicates only the presence of a receptor antagonist and not how strongly it blocks receptor functions, the RAM positive compounds were further tested for potency in calcium flux assay using MOLT-4 cells. ICso determinations on this subset discovered several compounds with ICso's less than 1 μM and that dfd not inhibit other chemokine receptors examined at significant levels.<br>
fn vivo efficacy studies<br>
[0O204]       The MDRtct-knockout mice, which lack the P-glycoprotein gene, spontaneously develop colitis under specific pathogen-free condition. The pathology in these animals has been characterized as Th1-type T cell-mediated inflammation similar to ulcerative colitis in humans. Disease normally begins to develop at around 8-10 weeks after birth. But the ages at which disease emerges and the ultimate penetrance level often vary considerably among different animal facilities,<br>
[0O205]        In a study using the MDR1a-knockout mice, the known compound shown below was tested for its ability to delay disease onset during a short treatment regimen.<br><br><br>
[0O206]       This compound is structurally similar to the claimed modulators (I) of the present invention. Female mice (n=15) were dosed with 50 mg/kg twice a day by intraperitonial injection, starting at age 13 weeks for 14 consecutive days. The study was terminated when the mice reached age 17 weeks at which point the disease penetrance level measured by diarrhea incidence reached 55%. The study showed that the compound was well tolerated; mice in the compound-treated group showed a significant delay in the onset of IBD symptoms. This protection extended one to two weeks after treatment stopped (Figure 1).<br>
