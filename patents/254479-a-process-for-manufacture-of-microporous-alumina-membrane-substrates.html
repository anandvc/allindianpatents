				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for manufacture of microporous alumina substrate with high porosity and the substrate thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Organic membranes used for industrial separation process has been increasingly replaced by inorganic membranes because of their high mechanical strength and chemical, biological and thermal inertness. Unlike polymer membranes inorganic membranes can be used under extreme conditions of pH, temperature, pressure, radiations and the like. 50% of the total market share in membrane separation technology is for microfiltration membranes with pore size in the range 0.1 to 10 urn.. Microporous inorganic membranes are used for separation of microbes from drinking water, concentration of fruit juices in food industry, filtration of beverages for their clarification and sterilization, water treatment and recovery of various chemicals from black liquor in paper industry and in biotechnology [Das et. al Brit. Ceram. Trans. 101 (5) 208-212 (2002)]. They also find application as substrate for nanofikration, ultra filtration and reverse osmosis membranes. Process such as powder pressing; slip casting, tape casting, extrusion and centrifugal casting followed by partial sintering of powders of appropriate particle size and size distribution are used for the preparation of microporus alumina membrane substrate in planar and tubular configuration [Das et. al j. Euro. Ceram. Soc, 19, 314-345 (1999); Lama et. al. Ceram. Int 19, 121-24 (1993); Darcovich et. al J, Am. Ceram. Soc, 82 (8) 2073-73 (1990); Nijmeijer, et. al Am. Ceram. Soc. Bull. 77 [4]95-98 (1998). Permeate flux of a membrane is directly proportional to its porosity [Clark et. al. Br. Ceram. Proc. 43, 77-91 (1998); Das et. al br. Ceram. Trans. 101(5) 208-212(2002)]. Literature shows porosity of membrane substrates prepared by the above methods was 
Gelcasting is a novel ceramic shape forming process for preparation of dense near-net-shape ceramic bodies [Omatete et. al. Am. Ceram.Soc., 70 (10)1641-1647 91991). This process based on gelation of concentrated ceramic powder suspensions containing an organic monomer in a mould by in situ polymerization of the monomer. Acrylic and urea formaldehyde monomers have been used for gelcasting process [Young et. al J. Am. Ceram.<br>
Soc. 74 (3) 612-18 (1991); Prabhakaran et. al. Ceram. (nt 26, 67-71 (2000)]. Recently, a freeform gelcasting process for fabrication of tubular microporous alumina membrane substrate with porosity - 42% based on urea formaldehyde gelation process has also been reported [Prabhakaran et. al. J. Am. Ceram. Soc., 85 (12) 3126-28 (2002). United State Patent 5,415,775 (May 16, 1995) describes a process for preparation of porous monolithic ceramic support with pore volume greater than 30% and pore diameter ranging from 1 to 20 µm from alumina particulates coated partially with TiO2 for composite inorganic micro/ultrafiltration devices.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention proposes a process for manufacture of microporous alumina substrate with porosities 40% to 75% and average pore size 0.2 µm in planar and tubular configurations. Porosity and pore size of the membrane is controlled by the amount of urea formaldehyde. Urea formaldehyde acts template for micropores. Porosity measurement using mercury porosimeter showed all pores are accessible (interconnected), suitable for<br>
microfiltration applications. They can also be used as substrate for ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis membranes.<br>
The process comprises of following steps:<br>
(i) Preparation of methylol urea by mixing urea and formaldehyde solution (35 to 37 w/v%) in basic condition preferably at pH in the range 8 to 9 and aging the solution for 24 hrs. Any base preferably sodium hydroxide is used for pH adjustment. The molar ratio of urea and formaldehyde used is in the range 1:2 to 1:6.<br>
(ii) Dispersion of alumina powder in the methylol urea solution in acidic pH preferably at pH in the range 2 to 3 by ball milling. Any mineral acid preferably nitric acid is used for pH adjustment.<br>
(iii) Mixing the alumina slurry with additional urea to make urea to formaldehyde mole ratio 1:2 and casting the slurry in moulds to fabricate tubular or planar shapes.<br>
(iv) Drying of the gelled body under humidity controlled conditions preferably at relative humidity in the range 60 to 90% and at temperature in the range 25% to 40% C.<br>
(v) Binder burnout from the dried bodies by heating at slow rate/up to 600°C at a rate of 60°C c/h preferably at 5° C/hrs.<br>
(vi) Sintering of the debinderised bodies by heating at a rate 
In basic medium urea react with formaldehyde to form methylol urea derivatives. Alumina slurry prepared in the methylolurea solution when supplemented with additional urea undergoes gelation in 15 to 30 minute due to condensation polymerization of urea and methylol urea. The gelled body has sufficient strength to be removed from the mould without deformation.<br>
The porosity and pore size of the membrane substrate is controlled by the amount of urea-formaldehyde used with respect to alumina powder and the amount of urea formaldehyde used is preferably in the range 10 to 60% by weight of alumina.<br>
According lo one preferred embodiment of the invention, the alumina used for the present process has an average particle size of from 0.1 5µn to 5µm.<br>
According to another embodiment, the gelation of alumina slurry is achieved by mixing urea, formaldehyde and methylol urea with alumina slurry.<br>
The moulds for fabricating the substrate are made of a metal. According to one embodiment the mould is made of any plastic material. According to another embodiment the mould is made of glass. According to one embodiment the mould is made of wax.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment the substrates obtained by this process have a thickness in the range of 1.5 mm to 4 mm.<br>
