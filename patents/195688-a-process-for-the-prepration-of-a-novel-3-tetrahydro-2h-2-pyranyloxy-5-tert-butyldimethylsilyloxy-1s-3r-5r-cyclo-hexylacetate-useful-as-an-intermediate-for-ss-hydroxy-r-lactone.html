The prior art processes have following drawbacks :<br>
1.	The processes use chemicals such as butyl lithium, lithium aluminium hydride, methoxy-diethylborane which are costly and dilTicult to handle and therefore make the process difficult.<br>
2.	All known process are however involves large number of synthetic steps resulting in low over all yields.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclohexylacetate useful as an intermediate for 6-hydroxymethyi-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4R,6S)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone.<br>
Yet  another  object  is  to  provide  a   process  for the  preparation   of  6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4R,6S)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone which obviates the drawbacks of the prior art processes and use cheaper and easily accessible chemicals.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel 3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-cyclo-hexylacetate having formula 6<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
useful as an intermediate for 6-hydroxymethyl-4-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(4R,<br>
6S)-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranone which comprises<br>
reacting a compound 3-hydroxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(15,3R,5R)-<br>
cyclohexylacetate (5) with dihydropyran in an organic solvent in the presence of p-<br>
toluene sulphonic acid at a temperature ranging from 5 -10 °C for a period ranging<br>
from 2 to 5 hrs, quenching the above reaction with an aqueous sodium bicarbonate,<br>
separating the organic layer, drying, on evaporating and column chromatography to<br>
obtain	3-tetrahydro-2H-2-pyranyloxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1S,3R,5R)-<br>
cyclohexylacetate.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the organic solvent used is selected from the group consisting of ethyl acetate, chloroform, dichloromethane, methanol or diethyl ether.<br>
The	compound	3-hydroxy-5-(tert.butyldimethylsilyloxy)-(1 S,3R,5R)<br>
cyclohexylacetate (5) is prepared by a procedure as described and claimed in our earlier co-pending patent application no. NF 27/01<br>
