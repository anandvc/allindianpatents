				<td>USE OF SILICON-CONTAINING POLYMERS TO IMPROVE<br>
RED MUD FLOCCULATION IN THE BAYER PROCESS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the removal of suspended solids from Bayer<br>
alumina process streams by contacting the streams with Si-containing polymers<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Bauxite is the basic iaw material for almost all manufactured alumina<br>
compounds. In the course of production of aluminum compounds, most bauxite is refined<br>
to aluminum hydroxide by the Bayer process. The Bayer process involves hot leaching of<br>
bauxite with NaOH solution in pressuie vessels to obtain supersaturated sodium<br>
aluminate solutions from which Al(OH)3 is precipitated by seeding Bayer process<br>
refineiies share six common process stages: bauxite mining; iaw material preparation;<br>
bauxite digestion; separation, washing, disposal of insoluble bauxite residue; aluminum<br>
hydroxide (tiihydrate) precipitation; and calcinations to anhydrous alumina The process<br>
of separating bauxite residue solids from the supeisatutated green liquor near its boiling<br>
point Is known as "clarification".<br>
 In the clarification stage, the coarser solid particles are generally<br>
removed with a "sand hap" cyclone, To separate the finei solid particles from the liquor,<br>
the sluny is normally fed to the center well of a mud settler where it is heated with a<br>
flocculant composition that may be based on a variety of flocculating agents including<br>
starch, flout, polyaciylate salt polymer, actylate salt/actylamide copolymer, and/or water-<br>
soluble polymers containing pendant hydtoxamic acid or salt groups As the mud settles,<br>
clarified sodium aluminate solution, referred to as green liquor, overflows a weir at the<br>
top of the mud settling tank and is passed to the subsequent process steps The sodium<br>
aluminate solution is generally cooled to enhance supersaturation and then seeded, e.g.<br>
with fine gibbsite seed fiom previous cycles to initiate precipitation of the desired end<br>
product Al(OH)3<br>
 The settled solids from the flocculation procedure, known as red mud,<br>
are withdrawn from the bottom of the mud settler and passed through a countetcunent<br>
washing circuit for recovery of sodium aluminate and soda. Aluminate liquor<br>
overflowing the settler may still contain significant amounts of suspended solids This<br>
liquor is generally further clarified by filtration to give a filtrate that contains a very low<br>
level of suspended solids Depending on the level of silicates in the bauxite, the red mud<br>
and/or aluminate liquor may contain sodium aluminosilicates. Dissolved sodium<br>
aluminosilicates may precipitate to form scale. Insoluble sodium aluminosilicates, also<br>
known as desilication product (DSP), may remain suspended in the red mud and/or<br>
aluminate liquet.<br>
 Alumina in relatively pure form is precipitated from the filtrate as<br>
alumina ttihydrate crystals. The remaining liquid phase is returned to the initial digestion<br>
step and, after being reconstituted with additional caustic, is employed as a digestant of<br>
additional ore<br>
 The suspended solids are ptefetably separated at a relatively fast late if<br>
the overall Bayet process is to be efficient. Efficient removal of suspended solids from<br>
Bayer process streams has been a major challenge for many years. Among the methods of<br>
speeding up separation of suspended solids from process stteams as well as providing a<br>
cleaner separation of the constituents are those disclosed in US Pat No. 3,390,959,<br>
which employs polyaciylates as flocculants, and US Pat. No. 3,681,012, which uses<br>
combinations of polyacrylates and starch in Bayer alumina recovery circuits U S. Pat.<br>
No. 4,083,925 discloses the use of polyaciylamide within the mud settler. U.S. Pat. No<br>
4,678,585 teaches that different stages in the Bayer alumina recovery circuit are<br>
advantageously treated with different flocculant compositions. U.S. Pat. No. 4,767,540<br>
describes a process for removing suspended solids from Bayer alumina process streams<br>
by contacting and mixing a Bayet process stream with hydroxamated polymers The<br>
hydroxamated polymers may be employed with anionic polyactylate. U.S Pat No<br>
5,516,435 and U.S. Pat No 5,539,046 use blends of hydroxamated polymer emulsions<br>
with polyacrylate emulsions to remove suspended solids from Bayer alumina process<br>
streams. Other polymers disclosed for the treatment of red mud in the Bayer process<br>
include phosphonic acid-containing polymers (U.S. Pat No. 5,534,235), water continuous<br>
methyl actylate emulsion polymers (US. Pat. No 6,036,869), and salicylic acid<br>
containing polymers (U.S. Pat. No. 6,527,959).<br>
 Silicon-containing polymers have been disclosed for water<br>
clarification For instance, US. Pat. No 3,779,912 uses silicon-containing<br>
arninomethylphosphonates to flocculate suspended solids in water Copolymers of<br>
diallydimethylamraoniitm halide and a vinyltrialkoxysilane are disclosed as a coagulant<br>
used In demulsification of oily waste watets (U.S. Pat. No. 5,560,832), dewateiing of<br>
mineral sluiries (U.S. Pat. No. 5,597,475), and clarification of waste waters (US Pat. No<br>
5,679,261). US Pat- No 6,605,674 discloses the use of vinylttialkoxysilanes as cross-<br>
linking agents to modify structure of nonionic, cationic and anionic water-soluble<br>
polymers and the use of the structuially-modified polymers as flocculating agents. None<br>
of the above-mentioned silicon-containing polymer patents relate to the treatment of<br>
suspended solids fiom the Bayet process streams<br>
 The use of silicon-containing polymers to control aluminosilicate scale<br>
has been disclosed, see US Pat No. 6,814,873 and U.S. Pat Pub Nos. 2004/0162406<br>
Al, 2005/0010008 A2, and 2005/0274926 A2. These publications describe methods for<br>
using the silicon-containing polymers to inhibit dissolved aluminosilicates (such as<br>
sodium aluminosilicate) from depositing on surfaces to form scale, but not foi<br>
flocculating DSP<br>
 It has been now discovered that greatly improved flocculation of<br>
suspended solids, especially DSP, from Bayer process streams may be obtained by adding<br>
and efficiently mixing a silicon-containing polymer into the Bayer piocess stream alone or<br>
subsequent to, followed by or in association with a conventional flocculant. This<br>
treatment is particularly effective in treating bauxite residue solids containing high<br>
silicates and sodium aluminosilicates when compared with state-of-the ait processes, as<br>
exemplified by the patents mentioned above Such reductions in suspended solids can<br>
significantly reduce the need for filtration Since the suspended solids may contain<br>
undesirable impuiities, the reductions in suspended solids achieved by practice of the<br>
present invention may also result in improved purity of the resultant alumina product<br>
SUMMARY<br>
 The present invention provides silicon-containing polymers, flocculant<br>
compositions and processes for the reduction of suspended solids from a process stream<br>
of the Bayer alumina piocess. The processes involve contacting a Bayer process sheam<br>

suspended solids in Bayer process streams. In preferred embodiments, silicon-containing<br>

can be desirable to include other pendant groups in addition to the silicon-containing<br>
group pendant group. Examples of other pendant groups include carboxylate gioups such<br>
as -C(=O)O- or -C(=O)OH, amide groups such as -C(=O)NH2, hydioxamated groups<br>

ethylene recurring units, e.g., -[CH2C(RX)H]-, whetein Rx comprises a silane gtoup with<br>
ot without a linking group as described elsewhere herein, or another pendant substituent<br>
A single kind of linking group can be employed, or combinations of linking groups can be<br>
employed In certain embodiments, additional hydrogen atoms of the ethylene lecutting<br>
unit can be substituted by a pendant silane group or some other pendant gioup.<br>
Ihe silicon-containing polymers described herein can be made in a<br>
variety of ways. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,814,873 and U S. Pat. Pub.. Nos. 2004/0162406;<br>

 The flocculant compositions and methods for using them described<br>
herein can include any suitable flocculant or combinations of flocculants. For example,<br>
an embodiment provides a flocculant composition, comprising a silicon-containing<br>
polymer flocculant as described herein (e.g., a silicon-containing polymer flocculant for a<br>
DSP) and a polymer flocculant for a Bayer process red mud In an embodiment, the<br>
polymer flocculant for the Bayer process red mud can be an anionic polymeric flocculant<br>
In an embodiment, the weight ratio of the amount of the silicon-containing polymer<br>
flocculant to the amount of the anionic polymeric flocculant in the flocculant composition<br>
is in the lange of about 100:1 to about 1:10, e.g., in the range of about 10:1 to about 1:2,<br>
such as about 1:1.<br>
 Polymeric flocculants useful in the Bayei piocess include anionic<br>
polymers known by those skilled in the ait to be useful as polymer flocculants for Bayer<br>
piocess red mud. Examples of useful anionic polymer flocculants include homo-polymeis<br>
of acrylic acid oi aciylates; copolymeis of acrylic acid or aciylate monomeis; homo-<br>
polymeis of methacrylic acid or methaciylates; copolymers of methaciylic acid or<br>
methacrylate monomeis; polyacrylamides, alkali metal, alkaline eaith metal or ammonium<br>
salts of said acids; polymers containing hydioxamic acid oi salt gioups; or a combination<br>
of any of the foregoing. In an embodiment, the anionic polymetk flocculant is a<br>
hydioxamated polymer, e.g., a hydroxamated polyaciylamide. The amount of anionic<br>
iecuning units in the anionic polymer may vaty over a broad tange. For example, in an<br>
embodiment, the anionic polymeric flocculant compiises at least about 50% anionic<br>
iecuiiing units Weight aveiage moleculai weights of anionic polymer flocculants are<br>
typically about 1,000 or greatei, e.g., about 10,000 or greater; about 100,000 oi greatei;<br>
about 1,000,000 oi greater, or about 5,000,000 oi greater In some embodiments,<br>
molecular weights at* 30,000,000 oi less Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
foregoing piovides descriptions of ranges between each of the stated values, and thus will<br>
understand, for example, that the anionic polymer flocculant may have a weight aveiage<br>
molecular weight of from about 5,000,000 to about 30,000,000.<br>
 Other types of flocculants commonly employed in the Bayer process<br>
include nonionic flocculants such as starch (eg., pregelatinized, from corn or potato),<br>
polysaccharides, alginates, dexttan or flour While anionic flocculants are particularly<br>
preferred for use in the Bayer process, selected cationic, nonionic, or amphoteric<br>
flocculants can also be advantageously employed in suitable amounts, as will be<br>
appreciated by one skilled in the art.<br>
 Flocculant compositions, including those containing a silicon-<br>
containing polymer flocculant as described herein (e.g., a silicon-containing polymer<br>
flocculant for a DSP) and/or a polymer flocculant for a Bayer piocess red mud, may be<br>
concentrated or diluted (eg., in water), and may include additional ingredients. It will be<br>
appreciated by those skilled in the art that Bayer process sites are often located far from<br>
flocculant manufactureies, and thus it is often desirable to transport the flocculant<br>
composition to the Bayer process site in a relatively concentrated form in order to<br>
minimize shipping costs. The concentrated flocculant composition can then be<br>
conveniently diluted in an aqueous medium on site to foim a dilute flocculant<br>
composition, at or about the time that it is to be used. Ihe aqueous medium with which<br>
the concentrated flocculant composition is diluted may be water in a relatively pure foim,<br>
recycled water from various sources, or an aqueous Bayer process stream.<br>
 In view of the foiegoing, those skilled in the ait will appreciate that a<br>
flocculant composition, including those containing a silicon-containing polymei<br>
flocculant as described herein (e.g, a silicon-containing polymer flocculant for a DSP)<br>
and/or a polymer flocculant for a Bayer piocess red mud, may be formed duiing<br>
manufacture (eg, in a relatively concentrated foim) and/or prior to use, e.g., by on site<br>
inteimixing with an aqueous medium, and that it may contain additional components.<br>
Examples of additional components include water, salts, stabilizers, and pH adjusting<br>
agents, as well as ingredients such as DSP and Bayer process red mud. The DSP may<br>
comprise, for example, a sodium aluminosilicate. In an embodiment, at least a portion of<br>
the DSP is suspended in the flocculant composition. The concentration of any particular<br>
polymer flocculant in a flocculant composition may vary over a broad range, e.g., from<br>
about 0 1 part per million to about 100 % (e.g., highly concentrated form containing little<br>
or no water) For relatively dilute flocculant compositions, examples of suitable<br>
concentrations of the anionic polymer flocculant in the flocculant composition include<br>
amounts in the range of from about 01 part per million to about 1,000 parts per million,<br>
and examples of suitable concentrations of the silicon-containing polymeric flocculant in<br>
the flocculant composition include amounts in the range of from about one part pet<br>
million to about 500 parts per million. For flocculant compositions containing multiple<br>
polymer flocculant components, including those containing a silicon-containing polymer<br>
flocculant as described herein (e.g., a silicon-containing polymer flocculant for a DSP)<br>
and a polymer flocculant for a Bayer process red mud, it will be appreciated that the<br>
components can be combined at or near the time or manufacture and/or shipping, or<br>
combined at or near the time of use, e.g, on site in the vicinity of a Bayer process stream<br>
 The polymer flocculants and flocculant compositions described herein<br>
are useful as flocculants. For example, an embodiment provides a flocculation method,<br>
comprising inteimixing a silicon-containing polymer flocculant and/or flocculant<br>
composition as described herein with a Bayer process stream in an amount effective to<br>
flocculate at least a portion of solids suspended therein In an embodiment, the suspended<br>
solids include one or moie of red mud and/or DSP. Anothei embodiment provides a<br>
flocculation method, comprising intermixing a silicon-containing polymer flocculant with<br>
a Bayer process stream in an amount effective to thereby flocculate at least a portion of a<br>
desilication product suspended therein; and separating at least a portion of the flocculated<br>
desitication product thus formed<br>
 An embodiment provides a method of reducing the level of suspended<br>
solids in a Bayer process stream whereby a polymer with the pendant group or end group<br>
containing - Si(OR)3 (where R is H, an alkyl group, Na, K, or NH4) is added alone,<br>
subsequent to, followed by, or in association with a conventional flocculant in order to<br>
effectively flocculate the suspended solids so that they can be conveniently separated from<br>
the process stream. The amount of reduction in suspended solids content can be<br>
measured and compared with controls, which generally comprise state-of-the-art alumina<br>
process samples The amounts of polymer flocculant(s) effective to flocculate a particular<br>
type of solids in a particular Bayer process stream can be determined by routine<br>
experimentation informed by the guidance provided herein. The amount of flocculant is<br>
often in the range of from about 0.01 lb to about 40 lbs. of flocculant per ton of solids<br>
(dry basis), e.g., in various ranges from about 0.1,0.2, 0.3, 0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8, or 0.9 lb.<br>
to about 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35 lbs. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the<br>
foregoing provides descriptions of ranges between each of the stated values, and thus will<br>
understand, for example, that the polymer flocculant can be used in an amount in the<br>
range of from about 1 lb to about 10 lbs of flocculant per ton of solids (dry basis).<br>
 In an embodiment, the Bayer process stream comprises suspended<br>
DSP, e.g., fiom about 0 02 grams per liter to about 200 grams per liter of suspended DSP<br>
As illustrated in the examples below, in some embodiments the polymer flocculants and<br>
flocculant compositions described herein are particularly useful for flocculating<br>
suspended DSP in Bayer process streams.<br>
 In the context of commercial plant operation, the polymer flocculants<br>
and/or flocculant compositions can be added to the settler feed, as are the anionic<br>
flocculants described above. Alternatively, the polymers can be added to the overflow<br>
fiom a piimaiy settler or to the blow-off from the digesters The polymers can also be<br>
used in the settling of muds in the mud washing circuit. The polymers, alone 01 in<br>
combination with other- process chemicals, can advantageously be added at other points in<br>
the commercial plant operation as well.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Test Procedure<br>
 A synthetic Bayet liquor is made by adding 256 g sodium aluminate,<br>
66 g sodium hydroxide, and 40 g sodium carbonate to water to make a total of 1000 ml<br>
and heating to 100°C<br>
 A DSP is made by heating kaolin in sodium hydioxide solution to<br>
150°C, followed by filtration, washing, and drying to recover diy DSP. Red mud solids<br>
are obtained fiom mud sluiiy typically being discharged to waste at an opeiating Bayei<br>
plant This mud is washed free of the associated dilute sodium aluminate solution, dried<br>
and ground.<br>
 For the settling tests, eithei a DSP alone oi a mixture of DSP and red<br>
mud solids are dispersed in the above liquoi, generally to give a slurry containing about<br>
40 g/1 of suspended solids Dilute reagent is mixed into sluny contained in a graduated<br>
cylinder, using a perforated plunger, and the time to settle a fixed distance is measured so<br>
that a settling rate for the flocculated solids could be calculated. Also, after five minutes a<br>
sample of the supernatant liquor is taken and filtered; the solids collected on the filter are<br>
then washed and dried to give a measure of the supernatant clarity.<br>
Example 1 -Reagent A<br>
 81.4 g of a water-free polyethyleneimine is mixed with 18.6 g of<br>
glycidoxypropyltiimethoxysilane and the mixture is heated at 60°C for 16 houis. 50 g of<br>

to 90°C to make a 20% solution. The effectiveness of Reagent A in enhancing<br>
flocculation when employed in combination with commercially available flocculants is<br>
tested. Ihe commercial flocculants tested included Supeifloc HX-400, a hydroxamate-<br>
based flocculant based on polyacrylamide, and Superfloc 1227, an ammonium<br>
polyacrylate flocculant, both available from Cytec Industries Inc.. of West Paterson, New<br>
Jersey, USA Unreacted polyethyleneimine is employed as a control As demonstrated by<br>
the data presented in Iable 1, Reagent A in combination with flocculant significantly<br>
increased settling rate in both a 30/70 and a 40/60 DSP/red mud mixture when compared<br>
to flocculant alone, or flocculant in combination with polyethyleneimine control. A<br>
significant improvement in clarity is also observed for the combination of Reagent A and<br>
flocculant. Reagent A is also effective in flocculating DSP even without added<br>
commeicial fiocculant<br><br>

then heated to 95°C in 20 g/1 aqueous NaOH to make a 3% solution The product is<br>
Reagent C. As demonstrated by the data presented in Table 2, Reagent C exhibits<br>
significantly increased settling rates for suspended DSP oi red mud, compaied to<br>
iinfunctionalized pearl starch, indicating that Reagent C is an effective flocculating agent<br>
in its own right. Reagent C is even moie effective in flocculating suspended DSP/red<br>
mud mixtures (10/70,20/80, and a 40/60). Good claxity is also obseived for red mud and<br>
DSP/red mud mixtures treated with Reagent C.<br><br>

flocculation of DSP/red mud mixtures (10/70, 20/80, and a 40/60 when employed in<br>
combination with Supeifloc 1227 Claiity is also substantially improved when Reagent C<br>
is employed in combination with Supeifloc 1227.<br>
