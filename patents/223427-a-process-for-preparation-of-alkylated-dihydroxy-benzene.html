				<td>The present invention relates to a process for preparation of alkylated dihydroxy benzene. The present invention more particularly relates to a process for producing alkylated di-hydroxy benzenes which are used as antioxidant, polymer stabilizers and in the treatment of mitochondrial respiration ailments, by the alkylation of dihydroxy benzene over solid acid or polyaniline sulfate as catalyst in the presence of tertiary butyl alcohol.<br>
Friedel-Crafts catalysis is one of the major and industrially important processes and widely used in the synthesis of low and high volume chemicals. Acylations, benzylations, alkylations and sulphonylations giving a wide range of useful products like ketones, alcohols, alkyl aromatics and sulphones are included in this name reaction. Petrochemical industry is also a beneficiary of this class of reaction, where a number of alkyl hydrocarbons are synthesized by alkylation reactions. The conventional catalysts used in these reactions are A1C13, HF, H2SO4, BF3 and BPO4 the likes.<br>
Most of the batch processes use A1C13 as soluble acid catalyst which is inexpensive, very reactive and is one of the most powerful Lewis acids. Unfortunately, it is difficult to handle A1C13 and similar metal halides as catalysts since they get readily hydrolyzed. Very often such catalysts are required in stoichiometric quantities. A large inventory of these materials pose health, safety and storage problems. Furthermore, the traditional route of liquid phase alkylation using mineral acids and A1C13 as catalysts suffer from the disadvantages of high capital cost, reactor corrosion, formation of by-products and the difficulty in catalyst regeneration. In recent times, the scientist's world wide have been devoting their attention to the development of environmentally friendly catalysts for the production of intrinsically important chemicals and chemical intermediates.<br>
The use of safe solid acids in place of traditional Friedel-Crafts catalysts and mineral acids has become important. Several alkylation reactions of aromatic hydrocarbons and functional aromatic hydrocarbons have been tried out over zeolites, oxides, mixed oxides and supported<br>
oxides. Clays such as montmorillonite having acidic functions are also being considered as alternative catalysts for these reactions. Clays have also been modified for this purpose by pillaring with polyhydroxy metal cations such as Zr, Al, Cr, Ga etc. acid activation, ion exchange with transition metals and by metal oxide impregnation.<br>
•<br>
Alkylation of phenols are important chemicals and chemical industries, especially in agrochemical and pharmaceutical industries (Fiege et al, in Gehartz W.et al eds, 1987 - Valmann Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 5th Editon, Wemheim, VCH Verlagsglsellaschaft; Lowenheim F.A. et al. 1975 Industrial chemicals; A. Wiley Interscience, New York; Kirk J. et al 1981, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd Edition, Wiley, New York). Alkylation of phenol with methanol over various catalysts has been studied (Nozaka et al. Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan. 50,<br>
1997, 614; Narayanan et al. J. Mol. Catal. 52, 1987, 129; Velu et al. React. Kinetic. Catal. Lett.<br><br>
62(2), 1997, 339 and Appl. Catal. A. General 119, 1994, 241.) Alkylation of phenol with alcohol over thoria was studied (Karuppanasamy et al., J. Catal. 63, 1980, 433) Alkylation of phenol with 2-propanol was investigated over alumina (Klemm et al., J. Org. Chem.. 45. 1980, 4326), Alkylation of phenol with isopropanol over zeolite catalyst was examined (Guo Changwen et al., Beijing Huagon Yanjuyuan. 27(3), 1998, 163), tertiary butylation of phenol was carried out over acid catalyst (Corma et al. J. Catal. 134, 1992, 58 and Appl. Catal. 105, 1993, 271) and tertiary butylation of phenol over zeolite solid acid catalyst was investigated in vapour phase (Peimo et al. Huadong Huadong Xueynan Xuebao. 14 (4), 1998, 476; Chang et al. US 5,288,927, 1993 and Kuizhang et al, Appl. Catal. A General. 166, 1998, 89).<br>
Alkylation of dihydroxy benzene with tertiary butyl alcohol was investigated by Korneev et al (USSR Patent No. 1,583,407, 1990) using mineral acids.<br>
The drawbacks of using mineral acid as catalyst as given in the referred works are:<br>
(i) Catalyst can not be reused, (ii) Disposal of acid is not environmentally safe and it is not economical, (iii) Low selectivity is frequently observed, (iv) Corrosion of the reaction vessel and reactors, (v) Not easy to handle and (iv) High inventory of the catalyst.<br>
The main object of the present is to provide a process for preparation of alkylated dihydroxy benzene with tertiary butyl alcohol using solid acid or polyaniline-sulfate as catalyst which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use solid acid or polyaniline-sulfate as catalyst for alkylation reaction.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of alkylated dihydroxy benzene which comprises; alkylating dihydroxy benzene with tertiary butyl alcohol in presence solid acid or polyaniline-sulfate catalyst in the temperature range from 40 to 90°C for a period of 2 to 8 hrs, separating the alkylated dihydroxy benzene by conventional method from the reacting mixture<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the dihydroxy benzene used may be selected from resorcinol, hydroquinone and catechol.<br>
In an another embodiment of the present invention, the catalysts used may be selected from zeolites of types HZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 30), HY (SiO2/ A12O3 = 5.2), H-MORDENITE (HM) (SiO2/ A12O3 = 20), MCM-41, MONTMORINLLONITE-K10 CLAY, ALUMINA or polymer of type polyaniline-sulfate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction may be carried out in the temperature from 60 to 90°C.<br>
In still yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reaction may be carried out for a period of 6 to 8 hrs.<br>
These embodiments will be apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the present invention.<br>
The process of alkylating dihydroxy benzene may be carried out reacting dihydroxy benzene with tertiary butyl alcohol in presence of catalyst, removing the catalyst by conventional method such as filtration followed by isolation of alkylated products by conventional column gromatography using adsorbent such as silica gel, alumina and solvent such as chloroform, ethylacetate, hexane and mixture there off.<br>

Filtered the reaction mixture and analyzed the filtrate using a CHEMITO 8510 Gas Chromatography using 20 % SE-30 column, coupled with flame ionization detector for product distribution.<br>
A typical Gas Chromatography - Mass spectral fragmentation pattern and Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectra (1HNMR) of the products proves that the products obtained were the mixture of mono and dialkylated benzene.<br>
