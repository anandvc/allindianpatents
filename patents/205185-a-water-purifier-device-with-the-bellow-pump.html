FIELD  OF  THE  INVENTION   [WATER PURIFIER  DEVICE  WITH  THE   BELLOW PUMP]<br>
The present invention relates to water purifying system and in particular to a water purifier container involving the use of air pressure. The purifier container of the invention is directed to a simple and cost effective manner of purified water generation involving air pressure forces by which the water / fluid in a container is forced to flow from the bottom to a top outlet through a multistage purifier. The purifier container is very convenient for use and can be utilized by consumers very simply and readily. The invention is also directed to water purifier cartridge units such as sediment filter unit, disinfections unit, and carbon based purification unit adapted for such air pressure driven water purifier containers and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is well known that filtering and purifying water is a challenging process in the present day hazards concerning the wide ranging contamination of drinking water. It is found that in many parts of the world even the municipality tap water is found to the contaminated with bacteria and chemicals.Various devices / system for taking guard against such harmful contamination of water have been provided which range from simple ceramic filtration to more sophisticated purification systems like ultraviolet^ reverse osmosis, ozone treatment etc.<br>
Moreover, the water outside home is even badly affected by problems of pollution. Bottle water or mineral water is the most common source for drinking water outside of home. It is rarely that we find any form of purifiers in bottle containing water and therefore it is also experienced that sometimes even such bottled water and mineral water if not properly treated or left unused for a long period can have contamination at a later point when used for drinking/consumption. Therefore there is a serious concern even as regards provision of packaged drinking water as to its capability to maintain the contents pure and harmless for human consumption.<br>
The use of dispensing liquids from container using air pressure inside the container is well known.<br>
US3955780 describes a reusable dispensing apparatus for dispensing a flowable product by pressurised air. The air pressure is created by an external air pump operated by the user.<br>
US390520 and JA1973000043468 describe the means of pouring a liquid contained in vacuum flax without tilting the flask or opening the lid. The<br><br>
Liquid is pumped up a tube by the pressure created by bellow design pump in<br>
the lid of the flux. Such type of devices usually thermos flask, to dispense either hot and cold liquid which has a bellow type of pump In the lid is commonly known as wAir Pots".<br>
US4113147 and US4310104 discloses further modification and easy dispensing of fluids. Further varieties of air pots wherein the water tubes are concealed in the walls of the container are further disclosed under US4359174 and US4238054. Based on the above concept numerous other products are made available that use either simple bottle to dispense fluid or use thermos flasks to dispense hot or cold fluids into a cup without opening the lid or tilting the flasks.<br>
US4054526 discloses the manner of pressurized water flow through purifier cartridge wherein external pump is used to create the pressure.<br>
US5733448 discloses the use of bellow pump to push water one chamber to another lower chamber having a purifier between two chambers.<br>
US5431813 provides a water purifier cartridge in the neck of the bottle.In such system pressure is created inside the bottle by squeezing the sides of the bottle which pushes the water through the purifier cartridge.<br>
US5545315 discloses system where the water to the purified flows up longitudinally inside the purifier cartridge. The required pressure that enable the flow of water is attained by combination of squeezing of the sides of the bottle and also sucking on the outlet mouthpieces.<br>
It would be apparent from the above that while the use of air pressure to force fluid / water in containers and its application in purifier cartridges in isolation have been known and in use, there is no system available which could advantageously provide combination of air pressure based fluid /water displacement and integrate the same with in-house purifiers in containers thereby favouring a more reliable and ready purification of the liquid/water in such containers before consumption. Importantly also there is no such air pressure based discharge container which could facilitate immediate ready purification of water and thereby avoid the problems of insufficient and / or ineffective purification of bottled purified water or mineral water and the like. There has thus been a continuing need in the art to provide for purifying containers which would ensure that the purified discharged is effectively purified and is safe for consumption.<br><br>
1<br>
