				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of priority of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No.<br>
60/638,143, filed December 23, 2004, and 60/713,340, filed September 2, 2005, each of which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to resins for use in separation processes, and especially<br>
the selective separation of solids and/or ionic species such as metallic cations from aqueous<br>
media. Such processes include froth flotation (e.g., used in the purification of clay-containing<br>
ores), the separation of drill cuttings from oil drilling fluids, clay and coal slurry dewatering,<br>
sewage treatment, pulp and paper mill effluent processing, the removal of sand from bitumen,<br>
and the purification of water to render it potable. The resins comprise the reaction product of a<br>
primary or secondary amine and an aldehyde (e.g., a urea-formaldehyde resin).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Froth Flotation<br>
[0002] Industrially, processes for the purification of liquid suspensions or dispersions (and<br>
especially aqueous suspensions or dispersions) to remove suspended solid particles are quite<br>
prevalent. Froth flotation, for example, is a separation process based on differences in the<br>
tendency of various materials to associate with rising air bubbles. Additives are often<br>
incorporated into the froth flotation liquid (e.g., aqueous brine) to improve the selectivity of the<br>
process. For example, "collectors" can be used to chemically and/or physically absorb onto<br>
mineral(s) to be floated, rendering them more hydrophobic. On the other hand, "depressants,"<br>
typically used in conjunction with collectors, render other materials (e.g., gangue minerals) less<br>
2<br><br>
likely to associate with the air bubbles, and therefore less likely to be carried into the froth<br>
concentrate.<br>
[0003] In this manner, some materials (e.g., value minerals) will, relative to others (e.g.,<br>
gangue materials), exhibit preferential affinity for air bubbles, causing them to rise to the surface<br>
of the aqueous slurry, where they can be collected in a froth concentrate. A degree of separation<br>
is thereby effected. In less common, so-called reverse froth flotations, it is the gangue that is<br>
preferentially floated and concentrated at the surface, with the desired materials removed in the<br>
bottoms. Gangue materials typically refer to quartz, sand and clay silicates, and calcite,<br>
although other minerals (e.g., fluorite, barite, etc.,) may be included. In some cases, the material<br>
to be purified (i.e., the desired material) actually comprises predominantly such materials, and<br>
the smaller amounts of contaminants are preferentially floated. For example, in the<br>
beneficiation of kaolin clay, a material having a number of industrially significant applications,<br>
iron and titanium oxides can be separated by flotation from the impure, clay-containing ore,<br>
leaving a purified kaolin clay bottoms product.<br>
[0004] The manner in which known collectors and depressants achieve their effect is not<br>
understood with complete certainty, and several theories have been proposed to date.<br>
Depressants, for example may prevent the gangue minerals from adhering to the value materials<br>
to be separated, or they may even prevent the collector(s) from absorbing onto the gangue<br>
minerals. Whatever the mechanism, the ability of a depressant to improve the selectivity in a<br>
froth flotation process can very favorably impact its economics.<br>
[0005] Overall, froth flotation is practiced in the beneficiation of a wide variety of value<br>
materials (e.g., mineral and metal ores and even high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as<br>
bitumen), in order to separate them from unwanted contaminants which are unavoidably co-<br>
extracted from natural deposits. A particular froth flotation process of commercial significance<br>
involves the separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay, which are ubiquitous in oil sand<br>
deposits, such as those found in the vast Athabasca region of Alberta, Canada. Bitumen is<br>
recognized as a valuable source of "semi-solid" petroleum or heavy hydrocarbon-containing<br>
crude oil, which can be upgraded into many valuable end products including transportation fuels<br>
such as gasoline or even petrochemicals. Alberta's oil sand deposits are estimated to contain 1.7<br>
trillion barrels of bitumen-containing crude oil, exceeding the reserves in all of Saudi Arabia.<br>
For this reason, significant effort has been recently expended in developing economically<br>
3<br><br>
feasible operations for bitumen recovery, predominantly based on subjecting an aqueous slurry<br>
of extracted oil sand to froth flotation. For example, the "Clark Process" involves recovering the<br>
bitumen in a froth concentrate while depressing the sand and other solid impurities.<br>
[0006] Various gangue depressants for improving froth flotation separations are known in the<br>
art and include sodium silicate, starch, tannins, dextrins, lignosulphonic acids, carboxyl methyl<br>
cellulose, cyanide salts and many others. More recently certain synthetic polymers have been<br>
found advantageous in particular beneficiation processes. For example, U.S. Patent No. Re.<br>
32,875 describes the separation of gangue from phosphate minerals (e.g., apatite) using as a<br>
depressant a phenol-formaldehyde copolymer (e.g., a resol, a novolak) or a modified phenol<br>
polymer (e.g., a melamine-modified novolak).<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 3,990,965 describes the separation of iron oxide from bauxite using as<br>
a depressant a water soluble prepolymer of low chain length that adheres selectively to gangue<br>
and that can be further polymerized to obtain a cross-linked, insoluble resin.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent No. 4,078,993 describes the separation of sulfide or oxidized sulfide ores<br>
(e.g., pyrite, pyrrhotite, or sphalerite) from metal mineral ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead, nickel)<br>
using as a depressant a solution or dispersion of a low molecular weight condensation product of<br>
an aldehyde with a compound containing 2-6 amine or amide groups.<br>
[0009] U.S. Patent Nos. 4,128,475 and 4,208,487 describe the separation of gangue materials<br>
from mineral ore using a conventional frothing agent (e.g., pine oils) combined with a<br>
(preferably alkylated) amino-aldehyde resin that may have free methylol groups.<br>
[0010] U.S. Patent No. 4,139,455 describes the separation of sulfide or oxidized sulfide ores<br>
(e.g., pyrite, pyrrhotite, or sphalerite) from metal mineral ores (e.g., copper, zinc, lead, nickel)<br>
using as a depressant an amine compound (e.g., a polyamine) in which at least 20% of the total<br>
number of amine groups are tertiary amine groups and in which the number of quaternary amine<br>
groups is from 0 to not more than 1/3 the number of tertiary amine groups.<br>
[0011] U.S. Patent No. 5,047,144 describes the separation of siliceous materials (e.g.,<br>
feldspar) from minerals (e.g., kaolinite) using as a depressant a cation-active condensation<br>
product of aminoplast formers with formaldehyde, in combination with cation-active tensides<br>
(e.g., organic alkylamines) or anion-active tensides (e.g.. long-chained alkyl sulfonates).<br>

[0012] Russian Patent Nos. 427,737 and 276,845 describe the depression of clay slime using<br>
carboxymethyl cellulose and urea-formaldehyde resins, optionally combined with methacrylic<br>
acid-methacrylamide copolymers or starch ('845 patent).<br>
[0013] Russian Patent Nos. 2,169,740; 2,165,798; and 724,203 describe the depression of clay<br>
carbonate slimes from ores in the potassium industry, including sylvinite (KCl-NaCl) ores. The<br>
depressant used is a urea/formaldehyde condensation product that is modified by<br>
polyethylenepolyamine. Otherwise, a guanidine-formaldehyde resin is employed ('203 patent).<br>
[0014] Markin, A.D., et. al, describe the use of urea-formaldehyde resins as carbonate clay<br>

[0015] As is recognized in the art, a great diversity of materials can be subject to<br>
beneficiation/refinement by froth flotation. Likewise, the nature of both the desired and the<br>
unwanted components varies greatly. This is due of the differences in chemical composition of<br>
these materials, as well as in the types of prior chemical treatment and processing steps used.<br>
Consequently, the number and type of froth flotation depressants is correspondingly wide.<br>
[0016] Also, the use of a given depressant in one service (e.g., raw potassium ore<br>
beneficiation) is not a predictor of its utility in an application involving a significantly different<br>
feedstock (e.g., bitumen-containing oil sand). This also applies to any expectation regarding the<br>
use of a depressant that is effective in froth flotation, in the any of the separations of solid<br>
contaminants from aqueous liquid suspensions, described below (and vice versa). The<br>
theoretical mechanisms by which froth flotation and aqueous liquid/solid separations occur are<br>
significantly different, where the former process relies on differences in hydrophobicity and the<br>
latter on several other possibilities (charge destabilization/neutralization, agglomeration, host-<br>
guest theory (including podands), hard-soft acid base theory, dipole-dipole interactions, Highest<br>
Occupied Molecular Orbital-Lowest unoccupied Molecular Orbital (H0M0-LUM0)<br>
interactions, hydrogen bonding, Gibbs free energy of bonding, etc). Traditional depressants in<br>
5<br><br>
froth flotation for the benefication of metallic ores, such as guar gum, are not employed as<br>
dewatering agents, or even as depressants in froth flotation for bitumen separation. Moreover, in<br>
two of the applications described below (waste clay and coal dewatering), no agents are<br>
currently used to improve the solid/liquid separation. Overall, despite the large offering of<br>
flotation depressants and dewatering agents in the art, an adequate degree of refinement in many<br>
cases remains difficult to achieve. There is therefore a need in the art for agents which can be<br>
effectively employed in a wide range of separation processes, including both froth flotation and<br>
the separation of solid contaminants from liquid suspensions.<br>
Other Separations<br>
[0017] Other processes, in addition to froth flotation, for the separation of solid contaminants<br>
from liquid suspensions can involve the use of additives that either destabilize these suspensions<br>
or otherwise bind the contaminants into larger agglomerates. Coagulation, for example, refers to<br>
the destabilization of suspended solid particles by neutralizing the electric charge that separates<br>
them. Flocculation refers to the bridging or agglomeration of solid particles together into<br>
clumps or floes, thereby facilitating their separation by settling or flotation, depending on the<br>
density of the floes relative to the liquid. Otherwise, filtration may be employed as a means to<br>
separate the larger floes.<br>
[0018] The additives described above, and especially flocculants, are often employed, for<br>
example, in the separation of solid particles of rock or drill cuttings from oil and gas well<br>
drilling fluids. These drilling fluids (often referred to as "drilling muds") are important in the<br>
drilling process for several reasons, including cooling and lubricating the drill bit, establishing a<br>
fluid counterpressure to prevent high-pressure oil, gas, and/or water formation fluids from<br>
entering the well prematurely, and hindering the collapse of the uncased wellbore. Drilling<br>
muds, whether water- or oil-based, also remove drill cuttings from the drilling area and transport<br>
them to the surface. Flocculants such as acrylic polymers are commonly used to agglomerate<br>
these cuttings at the surface of the circulating drilling mud, where they can be separated from the<br>
drilling mud.<br>
[0019] Other uses for flocculants in solid/liquid separations include the agglomeration of clays<br>
which are suspended in the large waste slurry effluents from phosphate production facilities.<br>
Flocculants such as anionic natural or synthetic polymers, which may be combined with a<br>
fibrous material such as recycled newspaper, are often used for this purpose. The aqueous clay<br>
6<br><br>
slurries formed in phosphate purification plants typically have a flow rate of over 100,000<br>
gallons per minute and generally contain less than 5% solids by weight. The dewatering (e.g.,<br>
by settling or filtration) of this waste clay, which allows for recycle of the water, presents one of<br>
the most difficult problems associated with reclamation. The settling ponds used for this<br>
dewatering normally make up about half of the mined area, and dewatering time can be on the<br>
order of several months to several years.<br>
[0020] In the separation of solids from aqueous liquids, other specific applications of<br>
industrial importance include the filtration of coal from water-containing slurries (i.e., slurry<br>
dewatering), the treatment of sewage to remove contaminants (e.g., sludge) via sedimentation,<br>
and the processing of pulp and paper mill effluents to remove suspended cellulosic solids. The<br>
dewatering of coal poses a significant problem industrially, as the BTU value of coal decreases<br>
with increasing water content. Raw sewage, both industrial and municipal, requires enormous<br>
treatment capacity, as wastes generated by the U.S. population, for example, are collected into<br>
sewer systems and carried along by approximately 14 billion gallons of water per day. Paper<br>
industry effluent streams likewise represent large volumes of solid-containing aqueous liquids,<br>
as waste water generated from a typical paper plant often exceeds 25 million gallons per day.<br>
The removal of sand from aqueous bitumen-containing slurries generated in the extraction and<br>
subsequent processing of oil sands, as described previously, poses another commercially<br>
significant challenge in the purification of aqueous liquid suspensions. Also, the removal of<br>
suspended solid particulates is often an important consideration in the purification of water, such<br>
as in the preparation of drinking (i.e., potable) water. Synthetic polyacrylamides, as well as<br>
naturally-occurring hydrocolloidal polysaccharides such as alginates (copolymers of D-<br>
mannuronic and L-guluronic acids) and guar gum are flocculants in this service.<br>
[0021] The above applications therefore provide several specific examples relating to the<br>
treatment of aqueous liquid suspensions to remove solid particulates. However, such<br>
separations are common in a vast number of other processes in the mineral, chemical, industrial<br>
and municipal waste, sewage treatment, and paper industries, as well as in a wide variety of<br>
other water-consuming industries. Thus, there is a need in the art for additives that can<br>
effectively promote selective separation of a variety of solid contaminants from liquid<br>
suspensions. Advantageously, such agents should be selective in chemically interacting with the<br>
solid contaminants, through coagulation, flocculation, or other mechanisms such that the<br>
7<br><br>
removal of these contaminants is easily effected. Especially desirable are additives that are also<br>
able to complex unwanted ionic species such as metal cations to facilitate their removal as well.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
All Uses<br>
[0022] The present invention is directed to amine-aldehyde resins for removing, generally in a<br>
selective fashion, a variety of solids and/or ionic species from the liquids in which they are<br>
suspended and/or dissolved. These resins are highly versatile, as they are especially useful as<br>
froth flotation depressants in the separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay or in the<br>
purification of clay (e.g., kaolin clay) from a clay-containing ore. The amine-aldehyde resins are<br>
also useful for treating aqueous liquid suspensions (eg., aqueous suspensions containing sand,<br>
clay, coal, and/or other solids, such as used drill cutting fluids, as well as process and effluent<br>
streams in phosphate and coal production, sewage treatment, paper manufacturing, or bitumen<br>
recovery facilities) to remove solid particulates and also potentially metallic cations (e.g., in the<br>
purification of drinking water).<br>
Froth Flotation<br>
[0023] Without being bound by theory, the amine-aldehyde resins of the present invention are<br>
highly selective in froth flotation processes for (1) binding to sand and/or clay to purify bitumen,<br>
as well as (2) refining clay-containing ores. Also, because these resins have affinity for water,<br>
the sand and/or clay particles, which interact and associate with the resin, are effectively<br>
sequestered in the aqueous phase in froth flotation. Consequently, sand and/or clay can be<br>
selectively separated from bitumen or impurities in clay-containing ores such as iron oxide.<br>
[0024] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying<br>
bitumen from a bitumen-containing slurry comprising sand or clay. The method comprises<br>
treating the slurry with a depressant comprising a resin that is the reaction product of a primary<br>
or a secondary amine and an aldehyde and recovering, by froth flotation either after or during<br>
the treating step, purified bitumen having a reduced amount of sand or clay. In another<br>
embodiment, the resin is a urea-formaldehyde resin, which is typically the reaction product of<br>
urea and formaldehyde at a formaldehyde : urea (F:U) molar ratio from about 1.75:1 to about<br>
8<br><br>
3:1. In another embodiment, the depressant comprises a resin in a solution or dispersion having<br>
a resin solids content from about 30% to about 90% by weight.<br>
[0025] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying clay from a<br>
clay-containing ore comprising an impurity selected from a metal, a metal oxide, a mineral, and<br>
mixtures thereof. The method comprises treating a slurry of the clay-containing ore with a<br>
depressant comprising a resin and recovering, by froth flotation of the impurity either after or<br>
during the treating step, a purified clay having a reduced amount at least one of the impurities.<br>
The resin is the reaction product of a primary or a secondary amine and an aldehyde. In another<br>
embodiment, the clay-containing ore comprises kaolin clay. In another embodiment, the<br>
impurity comprises a mixture of iron oxide and titanium dioxide. In another embodiment, the<br>
impurity comprises coal.<br>
Other Separations<br>
[0026] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying an aqueous<br>
liquid suspension comprising a solid contaminant. The method comprises treating the liquid<br>
suspension with a resin as described above and removing, either after or during the treating step,<br>
(1) at least a portion of the solid contaminant in a contaminant-rich fraction and/or (2) a purified<br>
liquid. In another embodiment, the treating step comprises flocculating the solid contaminant<br>
{e.g., sand or clay). In another embodiment, the removing step is carried out by sedimentation,<br>
flotation, or filtration. In another embodiment, the liquid suspension is an oil well drilling fluid<br>
and the method comprises removing a purified drilling fluid for reuse in oil well drilling. In<br>
another embodiment, the aqueous liquid suspension is a clay-containing effluent slurry from a<br>
phosphate production facility and the method comprises removing purified water for reuse in<br>
phosphate production. In another embodiment, the aqueous liquid suspension is an aqueous<br>
coal-containing suspension and the method comprises removing a coal-rich fraction by filtration.<br>
In another embodiment, the aqueous liquid suspension comprises sewage and the method<br>
comprises removing purified water by sedimentation. In another embodiment, the aqueous<br>
liquid suspension comprises a pulp or paper mill effluent, the solid contaminant comprises a<br>
cellulosic material, and the method comprises removing purified water. In another embodiment,<br>
the aqueous liquid suspension is a bitumen production process intermediate or effluent slurry<br>
comprising sand or clay. In still another embodiment, the purified liquid is potable water.<br>
9<br><br>
[0027] In another embodiment, the present invention is a method for purifying water<br>
comprising a metallic cation. The method comprises treating the water with the resin described<br>
above and removing at least a portion of the metallic cation by filtration to yield purified water<br>
(e.g., potable water). In another embodiment, the removing step comprises membrane filtration.<br>
In another embodiment, the metallic cation is selected from the group consisting of As+S, Pb+2,<br>
Cd+2, Cu+2, Mn+2, Hg+2, and mixtures thereof. In yet another embodiment, the resin is modified<br>
with an anionic functional group.<br>
[0028]   These and other embodiments are apparent from the following Detailed Description.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0029] FIG. 1 is a photograph of four jars containing graphite (two left jars) and bentonite<br>
(two right jars) that were left to stand for 24 hours after vigorous shaking to suspend these solids<br>
in water. The leftmost jar and the third jar from the left were treated with Urea-Formaldehyde<br>
resin prior to shaking.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
All Uses<br>
[0030] The resin that is used in separation processes of the present invention is the reaction<br>
product of a primary or secondary amine and an aldehyde. The primary or secondary amine, by<br>
virtue of having a nitrogen atom that is not completely substituted (i.e., that is not part of a<br>
tertiary or quaternary amine) is capable of reacting with an aldehyde, to form an adduct. If<br>
formaldehyde is used as the aldehyde, for example, the adduct is a methylolated adduct having<br>
reactive methylol functionalities. Typical primary and secondary amines used to form the resin<br>
include compounds having at least two functional amine or amide groups, or amidine<br>
compounds having at least one of each of these groups. Such compounds include ureas,<br>
guanidines, and melamines, which may be substituted at their respective amine nitrogen atoms<br>
with aliphatic or aromatic radicals, wherein at least two nitrogen atoms are not completely<br>
substituted. Often, the primary amines are used. Urea is representative of these, due to its low<br>
cost and extensive commercial availability.  In the case of urea, if desired, at least a portion<br>
10<br><br>
thereof can be replaced with ammonia, primary alkylamines, alkanolamines, polyamines (e.g.,<br>
alkyl primary diamines such as ethylene diamine and alkyl primary triamines such as diethylene<br>
triamine), polyalkanolamines, melamine or other amine-substituted triazines, dicyandiamide,<br>
substituted or cyclic ureas (e.g., ethylene urea), primary amines, secondary amines and<br>
alkylamines, tertiary amines and alkylamines, guanidine, and guanidine derivatives (e.g.,<br>
cyanoguanidine and acetoguanidine). Aluminum sulfate, cyclic phosphates and cyclic<br>
phosphate esters, formic acid or other organic acids may also be used in conjunction with urea.<br>
The amount of any one of these components (or if used in combination then their combined<br>
amount), if incorporated into the resin to replace part of the urea, typically will vary from about<br>
0.05 to about 20% by weight of the resin solids. These types of agents promote hydrolysis<br>
resistance, flexibility, reduced aldehyde emissions and other characteristics, as is appreciated by<br>
those having skill in the art.<br>
[0031] The aldehyde used to react with the primary or secondary amine as described above, to<br>
form the resin, may be formaldehyde, or other aliphatic aldehydes such as acetaldehyde and<br>
propionaldehyde. Aldehydes also include aromatic aldehydes (e.g., benzylaldehyde and<br>
furfural), and other aldehydes such as aldol, glyoxal, and crotonaldehyde. Mixtures of<br>
aldehydes may also be used. Generally, due to its commercial availability and relatively low<br>
cost, formaldehyde is used.<br>
[0032] In forming the resin, the initial formation of an adduct between the amine and the<br>
aldehyde is well known in the art. The rate of the aldehyde addition reaction is generally highly<br>
dependent on pH and the degree of substitution achieved. For example, the rate of addition of<br>
formaldehyde to urea to form successively one, two, and three methylol groups has been<br>
estimated to be in the ratio of 9 : 3 : 1, while tetramethylolurea is normally not produced in a<br>
significant quantity. The adduct formation reaction typically proceeds at a favorable rate under<br>
alkaline conditions and thus in the presence of a suitable alkaline catalyst (e.g., ammonia, alkali<br>
metal hydroxides, or alkaline earth metal hydroxides). Sodium hydroxide is most widely used.<br>
[0033] At sufficiently high pH values, it is possible for the adduct formation reaction to<br>
proceed essentially in the absence of condensation reactions that increase the resin molecular<br>
weight by polymerization (i.e., that advance the resin). However, for the formation of low<br>
molecular weight condensate resins from the further reaction of the amine-aldehyde adduct, the<br>
reaction mixture is generally maintained at a pH typically from about 5 to about 9. If desired, an<br>
11<br><br>
acid such as acetic acid can be added to help control the pH and therefore the rate of<br>
condensation and ultimately the molecular weight of the condensed resin. The reaction<br>
temperature is normally in the range from about 30°C to about 120°C, typically less than about<br>
85°C, and often the reflux temperature is used. A reaction time from about from about 15<br>
minutes to about 3 hours, and typically from about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, is used in<br>
preparing the low molecular weight amine-aldehyde condensate resin from the primary or<br>
secondary amine and aldehyde starting materials. Various additives may be incorporated, prior<br>
to or during the condensation reaction, in order to impart desired properties into the amine-<br>
aldehyde resin. For example, guar gum; carboxymethylcellulose or other polysaccharides such<br>
as alginates; or polyols such as polyvinyl alcohols, pentaerythitol, or Jeffol™ polyols (Hunstman<br>
Corporation, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA) may be used to alter the viscosity and consistency of<br>
the final amine-aldehyde resin and improve its performance in froth flotation and other<br>
applications. Otherwise, quaternary ammonium salts including diallyl dimethyl ammonium<br>
chloride (or analogs such as diallyl diethyl ammonium chloride) or alkylating agents including<br>
epichlorohydrin (or analogs such as epibromohydrin) may be used to increase the cationic<br>
charge of the amine-aldehyde resin and thereby improve its performance in certain solid/liquid<br>
separations (e.g., clay dewatering) discussed below. In this manner, such additives may be more<br>
effectively reacted into the amine-aldehyde resin than merely blended with the resin after its<br>
preparation.<br>
[0034] Condensation reaction products of the amine-aldehyde, amide-aldehyde, and/or<br>
amidine-aldehyde adducts described above include, for example those products resulting from<br>
the formation of (i) methylene bridges between amido nitrogens by the reaction of alkylol and<br>
amino groups, (ii) methylene ether linkages by the reaction of two alkylol groups, (iii)<br>
methylene linkages from methylene ether linkages with the subsequent removal of<br>
formaldehyde, and (iv) methylene linkages from alkylol groups with the subsequent removal of<br>
water and formaldehyde.<br>
[0035] Generally, in preparing the resin, the molar ratio of aldehyde : primary or secondary<br>
amine is from about 1.5:1 to about 4:1, which refers to the ratio of moles of all aldehydes to<br>
moles of all amines, amides, and amidines reacted to prepare the resin during the course of the<br>
adduct formation and condensation reactions described above, whether performed separately or<br>
simultaneously.  The resin is normally prepared under ambient pressure.  The viscosity of the<br>
12<br><br>
reaction mixture is often used as a convenient proxy for the resin molecular weight. Therefore<br>
the condensation reaction can be stopped when a desired viscosity is achieved after a sufficiently<br>
long time and at a sufficiently high temperature. At this point, the reaction mixture can be<br>
cooled and neutralized. Water may be removed by vacuum distillation to give a resin with a<br>
desired solids content. Any of a wide variety of conventional procedures used for reacting<br>
primary and secondary amine and aldehyde components can be used, such as staged monomer<br>
addition, staged catalyst addition, pH control, amine modification, etc., and the present invention<br>
is not limited to any particular procedure.<br>
[0036] A representative amine-aldehyde resin for use in separation processes of the present<br>
invention is a urea-formaldehdye resin. As described above, a portion of the urea may be<br>
replaced by other reactive amine and/or amides and a portion of the formaldehyde may be<br>
replaced by other aldehydes, to provide various desirable properties, without departing from the<br>
characterization of the resin as a urea-formaldehyde resin. Urea-formaldehyde resins can be<br>
prepared from urea and formaldehyde monomers or from precondensates in manners well<br>
known to those skilled in the art. Typically, the urea and formaldehyde are reacted at a molar<br>
ratio of formaldehyde to urea (F:U) in the range from about 1.75:1 to about 3:1, and usually at a<br>
formaldehyde : urea (F:U) mole ratio from about 2:1 to about 3:1, in order to provide sufficient<br>
methylolated species for resin cross-linking (e.g., di- and tri-methylolated ureas). Generally, the<br>
urea-formaldehyde resin is a highly water dilutable dispersion, if not an aqueous solution.<br>
[0037] In one embodiment, the condensation is allowed to proceed to an extent such that the<br>
urea-formaldehyde resin has a number average molecular weight (Mn), of greater than about 300<br>
grams/mole, and often from about 400 to about 1200 grams/mole. As is known in the art, the<br>
value of Mn of a polymer sample having a distribution of molecular weights is defined as<br><br>
[0038] where N1 is the number of polymer species having i repeat units and Mj is the<br>
molecular weight of the polymer species having i repeat units. The number average molecular<br>
weight is typically determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC), using solvent,<br>
standards, and procedures well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
13<br><br>
[0039] A cyclic urea-formaldehyde resin may also be employed and prepared, for example,<br>
according to procedures described in U.S. Patent No. 6,114,491. Urea, formaldehyde, and<br>
ammonia reactants are used in a mole ratio of urea : formaldehyde : ammonia that may be about<br>
0.1 to 1.0 : about 0.1 to 3.0 : about 0.1 to 1.0. These reactants are charged to a reaction vessel<br>
while maintaining the temperature below about 70°C (160°F), often about 60°C (140°F). The<br>
order of addition is not critical, but it is important to take care during the addition of ammonia to<br>
formaldehyde (or formaldehyde to ammonia), due to the exothermic reaction. In fact, due to the<br>
strong exotherm, it may be preferred to charge the formaldehyde and the urea first, followed by<br>
the ammonia. This sequence of addition allows one to take advantage of the endotherm caused<br>
by the addition of urea to water to increase the rate of ammonia addition. A base may be<br>
required to maintain an alkaline condition throughout the cook.<br>
[0040] Once all the reactants are in the reaction vessel, the resulting solution is heated at an<br>
alkaline pH to between about 60 and 105°C (about 140 to about 220°F), often about 85 to 95°C<br>
(about 185 to 205°F), for 30 minutes to 3 hours, depending on mole ratio and temperature, or<br>
until the reaction is complete. Once the reaction is complete, the solution is cooled to room<br>
temperature for storage. The resulting solution is storage stable for several months at ambient<br>
conditions. The pH is between 5 and 11.<br>
[0041] The yield is usually about 100%. The cyclic urea resins often contain at least 20%<br>
triazone and substituted triazone compounds. The ratio of cyclic ureas to di- and tri- substituted<br>
ureas and mono-substituted ureas varies with the mole ratio of the reactants. For example, a<br>
cyclic urea resin having the mole ratio of 1.0:2.0:0.5 U:F:A resulted in a solution characterized<br>
by C13-NMR and containing approximately 42.1% cyclic ureas, 28.5% di/tri-substituted ureas,<br>
24.5% mono-substituted ureas, and 4.9% free urea. A cyclic urea resin having the mole ratio of<br>
1.0:1.2:0.5 U:F:A resulted in a solution characterized by C13-NMR and containing<br>
approximately 25.7% cyclic ureas, 7.2% di/tri-substituted ureas, 31.9% mono-substituted ureas,<br>
and 35.2 free urea.<br>
[0042] In addition, the cyclic urea-formaldehyde resin may be prepared by a method such as<br>
described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,674,971. The cyclic urea resin is prepared by reacting urea and<br>
formaldehyde in at least a two step and optionally a three-step process. In the first step,<br>
conducted under alkaline reaction conditions, urea and formaldehyde are reacted in the presence<br>
of ammonia, at an F/U mole ratio of between about 1.2:1 and 1.8:1. The ammonia is supplied in<br>
14<br><br>
an amount sufficient to yield an ammonia/urea mole ratio of between about 0.05:1 and 1.2:1.<br>
The mixture is reacted to form a cyclic triazone/triazine or cyclic urea resin.<br>
[0043] Water soluble triazone compounds may also be prepared by reacting urea,<br>
formaldehyde and a primary amine as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 2,641,584 and 4,778,510.<br>
These patents also describe suitable primary amines such as, but are not limited to, alkyl amines<br>
such as methyl amine, ethyl amine, and propyl amine, lower hydroxyamines such as<br>
ethanolamine cycloalkylmonoamines such as cyclopentylamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
hexamethylenediamine, and linear polyamines. The primary amine may be substituted or<br>
unsubstituted.<br>
[0044] In the case of a cyclic urea-formaldehyde or a urea-formaldehyde resin, skilled<br>
practitioners recognize that the urea and formaldehyde reactants are commercially available in<br>
many forms. Any form which is sufficiently reactive and which does not introduce extraneous<br>
moieties deleterious to the desired reactions and reaction products can be used in the preparation<br>
of urea-formaldehyde resins useful in the invention. For example, commonly used forms of<br>
formaldehyde include paraform (solid, polymerized formaldehyde) and formalin solutions<br>
(aqueous solutions of formaldehyde, sometimes with methanol, in 37 percent, 44 percent, or 50<br>
percent formaldehyde concentrations). Formaldehyde also is available as a gas. Any of these<br>
forms is suitable for use in preparing a urea-formaldehyde resin. Typically, formalin solutions<br>
are used as the formaldehyde source. To prepare the resin of the present invention,<br>
formaldehyde may be substituted in whole or in part with any of the aldehydes described above<br>
(e.g.,glyoxal).<br>
[0045] Similarly, urea is commonly available in a variety of forms. Solid urea, such as prill,<br>
and urea solutions, typically aqueous solutions, are commercially available. Any form of urea is<br>
suitable for use in the practice of the invention. For example, many commercially prepared<br>
urea-formaldehyde solutions may be used, including combined urea-formaldehyde products<br>
such as Urea-Formaldehyde Concentrate (e.g., UFC 85) as disclosed in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,362,842 and 5,389,716.<br>
[0046] Also, urea-formaldehyde resins such as the types sold by Georgia Pacific Resins, Inc.,<br>
Borden Chemical Co., and Neste Resins Corporation may be used. These resins are prepared as<br>
either low molecular weight condensates or as adducts which, as described above, contain<br>
reactive methylol groups that can undergo condensation to form resin polymers, often within the<br>
15<br><br>
number average molecular weight ranges described previously. The resins will generally<br>
contain small amounts of unreacted (i.e., free) urea and formaldehyde, as well as cyclic ureas,<br>
mono-methylolated urea, and di- and tri-methylolated ureas. The relative quantities of these<br>
species can vary, depending on the preparation conditions (e.g., the molar formaldehyde : urea<br>
ratio used). The balance of these resins is generally water, ammonia, and formaldehyde.<br>
Various additives known in the art, including stabilizers, cure promoters, fillers, extenders, etc.,<br>
may also be added to the resin.<br>
[0047] The amine-aldehyde resins described above are highly selective for binding with<br>
unwanted solid materials (e.g., sand or clay) and/or ionic species such as metallic cations to be<br>
separated in the separation/purification processes of the present invention. Without being bound<br>
by theory, the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention, in one embodiment, is generally<br>
cationic (i.e., carries more overall positive than negative charge) to attract most clay surfaces,<br>
which are generally anionic (i.e., carry more overall negative than positive charge). These<br>
differences in electronic characteristics between the resin and clay can result in mutual attraction<br>
at multiple sites and even the potential sharing of electrons to form covalent bonds. The<br>
positive-negative charge interactions which cause clay particles to become attracted to the resin<br>
is potentially explained by several theories, such as host-guest theory (including podands), hard-<br>
soft acid base theory, dipole-dipole interactions, Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital-Lowest<br>
unoccupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO-LUMO) interactions, hydrogen bonding, Gibbs free<br>
energy of bonding, etc.<br>
[0048] Silica, silicates, and/or polysiloxanes may be used in conjunction (e.g., added as a<br>
blending component) with the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention to potentially<br>
improve its affinity for various materials, especially siliceous materials including sand and clay,<br>
whether these materials be desired or unwanted in any particular application. Other agents that<br>
may be used to improve the performance of resins in the separation processes of the present<br>
invention include polysaccharides, polyvinyl alcohol, polyacrylamide, as well as known<br>
flocculants (e.g., alginates). These agents can likewise be used with modified urea-<br>
formaldehyde resins wherein, as described above, at least a portion of the urea is replaced with<br>
ammonia or an amine as described above (e.g., primary alkylamines, alkanolamines,<br>
polyamines, etc.). Otherwise, such agents can also be used with resins which are modified with<br>
16<br><br>
anionic functional groups (e.g., sulfonate) or stabilized by etherification with an alcohol (e.g.,<br>
methanol), as described below.<br>
[0049] Silica in the form of an aqueous silica sol, for example, is available from Akzo Nobel<br>
under the Registered Trademark "Bindzil" or from DuPont under the Registered Trademark<br>
"Ludox". Other grades of sol are available having various particle sizes of colloidal silica and<br>
containing various stabilizers. The sol can be stabilized by alkali, for example sodium,<br>
potassium, or lithium hydroxide or quaternary ammonium hydroxide, or by a water-soluble<br>
organic amine such as alkanolamine.<br>
[0050] Silicates, such as alkali and alkaline earth metal silicates (e.g., lithium silicate, sodium-<br>
lithium silicate, potassium silicate, magnesium silicate, and calcium silicate), as well as<br>
ammonium silicate or a quaternary ammonium silicate, may also be used in the preparation of<br>
the resin. Additionally, stabilized colloidal silica-silicate blends or mixtures, as described in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,902,442, are applicable.<br>
[0051] In the separation processes of the present invention, particularly good performance is<br>
obtained when the resin is prepared in a solution or dispersion, having a solids content from<br>
about 30% to about 90%, and typically from about 45% to about 70%. Otherwise, "neat" forms<br>
of the resin, having little or no added solvent or dispersing agent (e.g., water), may also be<br>
employed. In any event, usually at least about 90% by weight, and often at least about 95% by<br>
weight, of the amine and aldehyde components, used to form the resin, are reacted, in order to<br>
reduce the amounts of free (unreacted) amines and aldehydes. This practice more efficiently<br>
utilizes the amine and aldehyde components in the production of the resin polymer, while<br>
minimizing any deleterious effects (e.g., vaporization into the environment) associated with<br>
these components in their free form. Overall, amine-aldehyde resins for use in separation<br>
processes of the present invention generally contain from about 40% to about 100% resin solids<br>
or non-volatiles, and often 55% to 75% non-volatiles. The non-volatiles content is measured by<br>
the weight loss upon heating a small (e.g., 1-5 gram), sample of the composition at about 105°C<br>
for about 3 hours. When an essentially "neat" form of the amine-aldehyde resin, having few or<br>
no volatile components, is employed, the pure resin may be added (e.g., as a viscous liquid, a<br>
gel, or a solid form, such as a powder), to the froth flotation slurry or liquid dispersion to be<br>
purified, such that an aqueous resin solution or dispersion is formed in situ. Neat forms of the<br>
17<br><br>
amine-aldehyde resins may be obtained from solutions or dispersions of these resins using<br>
conventional drying techniques, for example spray drying.<br>
[0052] Aqueous solutions or dispersions of the resins of the present invention will generally<br>
be a clear liquid or a liquid having a white or yellow appearance. They will typically have a<br>
Brookfield viscosity from about 75 to about 500 cps and a pH from about 6.5 to about 9.5. The<br>
free formaldehyde content and free urea content of urea-formaldehyde resin solutions are each<br>
typically below 5%, usually are each below 3%, and often are each below 1%. A low content of<br>
formaldehyde is generally achieved due to health concerns associated with exposure to<br>
formaldehyde emissions. If desired, conventional "formaldehyde scavengers" that are known to<br>
react with free formaldehyde may be added to reduce the level of formaldehyde in solution.<br>
Low amounts of free urea are also desirable, but for different reasons. Without being bound by<br>
theory, free urea is not believed to have the requisite molecular weight, (1) in froth flotation<br>
separations, to "blind" the gangue or desired (e.g., clay) materials to their interaction with rising<br>
air bubbles, (2) in the purification of liquid dispersions, to agglomerate a sufficiently large<br>
number of solid contaminant particles into floes, or (3) in the removal of ionic species from<br>
aqueous solutions, to bind these species to a molecule of sufficient size for retention by<br>
filtration. In particular, it has been found that resin polymers having a number average<br>
molecular weight of greater than about 300 grams/mole exhibit the mass needed to promote<br>
efficient separations.<br>
Froth Flotation<br>
[0053] When used as depressants in froth flotation separations, resins of the present invention,<br>
due to their high selectivity, provide good results at economical addition levels. For example,<br>
the resins may be added in an amount from about 100 to about 1000 grams, and typically from<br>
about 400 to about 600 grams, based on resin solution or dispersion weight, per metric ton of the<br>
material (e.g., clay-containing ore) that is to be purified by froth flotation. In general, the<br>
optimal addition amount for a particular separation can be readily ascertained by those of skill in<br>
the art and depends on number of factors, including the type and amount of impurities.<br>
[0054] Resins of the present invention can be applied in the froth flotation of a variety of<br>
materials (e.g., high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as bitumen) containing sand and/or<br>
clay, for which these resin depressants are especially selective. Although clay is often<br>
considered an impurity in conventional metal or mineral ore beneficiation, it may also be present<br>
18<br><br>
in relatively large quantities, as the main component to be recovered. Some clays, for example<br>
kaolin clay, are valuable minerals in a number of applications, such as mineral fillers in the<br>
manufacture of paper and rubber. Thus, one froth flotation process in which the resin of the<br>
present invention may be employed involves the separation of clay from a clay-containing ore.<br>
The impurities in such ores are generally metals and their oxides, such as iron oxide and<br>
titanium dioxide, which are preferentially floated via froth flotation. Other impurities of clay-<br>
containing ores include coal. Impurities originally present in most Georgia kaolin, which are<br>
preferentially floated in the purification method of the present invention, include iron-bearing<br>
titania and various minerals such as mica, ilmenite, or tourmaline, which are generally also iron-<br>
containing.<br>
[0055] Thus, the clay, which selectively associates with the amine-aldehyde resin of the<br>
present invention, is separately recoverable from metals, metal oxides, and coal. In the<br>
purification of clay, it is often advantageous to employ, in conjunction with the resin of the<br>
present invention as a depressant, an anionic collector such as oleic acid, a flocculant such as<br>
polyacrylamide, a clay dispersant such as a fatty acid or a rosin acid, and/or oils to control<br>
frothing. One approach, particularly in the refining of clay-containing ores, involves the<br>
modification of the resin with an anionic functional group, as described in greater detail below.<br>
[0056] The resin of the present invention is also advantageously employed in the separation of<br>
bitumen from sand and/or clay that are co-extracted from natural oil sand deposits.<br>
Bitumen/sand mixtures that are removed from oil or tar sand deposits, often within several<br>
hundred feet of the earth's surface, are generally first mixed with warm or hot water to create an<br>
aqueous slurry of the oil sand, having a reduced viscosity that facilitates its transport (e.g., by<br>
pipeline) to processing facilities. Steam and/or caustic solution may also be injected to<br>
condition the slurry for froth flotation, as well as any number of other purification steps,<br>
described below. Aeration of the bitumen-containing slurry, comprising sand or clay, results in<br>
the selective flotation of the bitumen, which allows for its recovery as a purified product. This<br>
aeration may be effected by merely agitating the slurry to release air bubbles and/or introducing<br>
a source of air into the bottom of the separation cell. The optimal amount of air needed to float<br>
the desired bitumen, without entraining excessive solid contaminants, is readily determined by<br>
one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
19<br><br>
[0057] Thus, the use of the resin depressant of the present invention advantageously promotes<br>
the retention of the sand and/or clay impurities in an aqueous fraction, which is removed from<br>
the bottom section of the froth flotation vessel. This bottoms fraction is enriched (i.e., has a<br>
higher concentration of) the sand and/or clay impurities, relative to the initial bitumen slurry.<br>
The overall purification of bitumen may rely on two or more stages of flotation separation. For<br>
example, the middle section of a primary flotation separation vessel may contain a significant<br>
amount of bitumen that can ultimately be recovered in a secondary flotation of this "middlings"<br>
fraction.<br>
[0058] Generally, in any froth flotation process according to the present invention, at least<br>
70% of the value material (e.g., bitumen or kaolin clay) is recovered from the raw material (e.g.,<br>
the clay-containing ore), with a purity of at least 85% by weight. Also, conventional known<br>
collectors may be used in conjunction with resins of the present invention, when used as<br>
depressants. These collectors include, for example, fatty acids (e.g., oleic acid, sodium oleate,<br>
hydrocarbon oils), amines (e.g., dodecylamine, octadecylamine, a-aminoarylphosphonic acid,<br>
and sodium sarcosinate), and xanthanate. Likewise, conventional depressants known in the art<br>
can also be combined with the resin depressants. Conventional depressants include guar gum<br>
and other hydrocolloidal polysaccharides, sodium hexametaphosphate, etc. Conventional<br>
frothing agents that aid collection, (e.g., methylisobutylcarbinol, pine oil, and polypropylene<br>
oxides) may also be used, in accordance with normal flotation practice, in conjunction with the<br>
resin depressants of the present invention.<br>
[0059] In froth flotation separations, the pH of the slurry to which the resins of the present<br>
invention, when used as depressants, are added will vary according to the particular material to<br>
be processed, as is appreciated by those skilled in the art. Commonly, the pH values range from<br>
neutral (pH 7) to strongly alkaline (e.g., pH 12). It is recognized that in some flotation systems,<br>
high pH values (e.g., from about 8 to about 12.5) give best results.<br>
[0060] Typically in froth flotation for the beneficiation of solid materials, the raw ore to be<br>
subjected to beneficiation is usually first ground to the "liberation mesh" size. The solid<br>
material may be ground to produce, for example, one-eighth inch average diameter particles<br>
prior to incorporation of the material into a brine solution to yield an aqueous slurry. After<br>
crushing and slurrying the material, the slurry may be agitated or stirred in a "scrubbing"<br>
process that breaks down some of the solids into very fine particles that remain in the brine as a<br>
20<br><br>
muddy suspension. Some of these fines may be washed off the ore particles prior to froth<br>
flotation. Also, as is known in the art, any conventional preconditioning steps including further<br>
crushing/screening, cycloning, and/or hydro separation steps, may be employed, respectively, to<br>
further reduce/classify raw material particle size and/or recover smaller solid particles, prior to<br>
froth flotation.<br>
[0061] Before or during froth flotation, the resin of the present invention, to be used as a<br>
depressant, is added to the aqueous slurry, usually in a manner such that the depressant is readily<br>
dispersed throughout. As stated above, conventional collectors may also be used to aid in the<br>
flotation of certain materials. In the froth flotation process, the slurry, typically having a solids<br>
content from about 10 to about 50% by weight, is transferred to one or more froth flotation cells.<br>
Air is forced through the bottoms of these cells and a relatively hydrophobic fraction of the<br>
material, having a selective affinity for the rising bubbles, floats to the surface (i.e., the froth),<br>
where it is skimmed off and recovered. A bottoms product that is hydrophilic relative to the<br>
froth concentrate, may also be recovered. The process may be accompanied by agitation.<br>
Commercially salable products can be prepared from the separate fractions recovered in this<br>
manner, often after further conventional steps, including separation (e.g., by centrifuge), drying<br>
(e.g., in a gas fired kiln), size classification (e.g., screening), and refining (e.g., crystallization),<br>
are employed.<br>
[0062] The froth flotation of the present invention may, though not always, involve flotation<br>
in "rougher cells" followed by one or more "cleanings" of the rougher concentrate. Two or<br>
more flotation steps may also be employed to first recover a bulk material comprising more than<br>
one component, followed by a selective flotation to separate these components. Amine-<br>
aldehyde resins of the present invention, when used as depressants, can be used to advantage in<br>
any of these steps to improve the selective recovery of desired materials via froth flotation.<br>
When multiple stages of froth flotation are used, the resins may be added using a single addition<br>
prior to multiple flotations or they may be added separately at each flotation stage.<br>
Other Separations<br>
[0063] Because of their affinity for solid contaminants in liquid suspensions or slurries, the<br>
amine-aldehdye resins of the present invention are applicable in a wide variety of separations,<br>
and especially those involving the removal of siliceous contaminants such as sand and/or clay<br>
from aqueous liquid suspensions or slurries of these contaminants. Such aqueous suspensions or<br>
21<br><br>
slurries may therefore be treated with amine-aldehyde resins of the present invention, allowing<br>
for the separation of at least a portion of the contaminants, in a contaminant-rich fraction, from a<br>
purified liquid. A "contaminant-rich" fraction refers to a part of the liquid suspension or slurry<br>
that is enriched in solid contaminants (i.e., contains a higher percentage of solid contaminants<br>
than originally present in the liquid suspension or slurry). Conversely, the purified liquid has a<br>
lower percentage of solid contaminants than originally present in the liquid suspension or slurry.<br>
[0064] The separation processes described herein are applicable to "suspensions" as well as to<br>
"slurries" of solid particles. These terms are sometimes defined equivalently and sometimes are<br>
distinguished based on the need for the input of at least some agitation or energy to maintain<br>
homogeneity in the case of a "slurry." Because the methods of the present invention, described<br>
herein, are applicable broadly to the separation of solid particles from aqueous media, the term<br>
"suspension" is interchangeable with "slurry" (and vice versa) in the present specification and<br>
appended claims.<br>
[0065] The treatment step may involve adding a sufficient amount of the amine-aldehyde resin<br>
to electronically interact with and either coagulate or flocculate the solid contaminants into<br>
larger agglomerates. The necessary amount can be readily determined depending on a number<br>
of variables (e.g., the type and concentration of contaminant), as is readily appreciated by those<br>
having skill in the art. In other embodiments, the treatment may involve contacting the liquid<br>
suspension continuously with a fixed bed of the resin, in solid form.<br>
[0066] During or after the treatment of a liquid suspension with the amine-aldehyde resin, the<br>
coagulated or flocculated solid contaminant (which may now be, for example, in the form of<br>
larger, agglomerated particles or floes) is removed. Removal may be effected by flotation (with<br>
or without the use of rising air bubbles as described previously with respect to froth flotation) or<br>
sedimentation. The optimal approach for removal will depend on the relative density of the<br>
floes and other factors. Increasing the quantity of resin that is used to treat the suspension can in<br>
some cases increase the tendency of the floes to float rather than settle. Filtration or straining<br>
may also be an effective means of removing the agglomerated floes of solid particulates,<br>
regardless of whether they reside in a surface layer or in a sediment.<br>
[0067] Examples of liquid suspensions that may be purified according to the present invention<br>
include oil and gas well drilling fluids, which accumulate solid particles of rock (or drill<br>
cuttings) in the normal course of their use. These drilling fluids (often referred to as "drilling<br>
22<br><br>
muds") are important in the drilling process for several reasons, including transporting these<br>
drill cuttings from the drilling area to the surface, where their removal allows the drilling mud to<br>
be recirculated. The addition of amine-aldehyde resins of the present invention to oil well<br>
drilling fluids, and especially water-based (i.e., aqueous) drilling fluids, effectively coagulates or<br>
flocculates solid particle contaminants into larger clumps into larger clumps (or floes), thereby<br>
facilitating their separation by settling or flotation. The resins of the present invention may be<br>
used in conjunction with known flocculants for this application such as polyacrylamides or<br>
hydrocolloidal polysaccharides. Often, in the case of suspensions of water-based oil or gas well<br>
drilling fluids, the separation of the solid contaminants is sufficient to provide a purified drilling<br>
fluid for reuse in drilling operations.<br>
[0068] Other aqueous suspensions of practical interest include the clay-containing aqueous<br>
suspensions or brines, which accompany ore refinement processes, including those described<br>
above. The production of purified phosphate from mined calcium phosphate rock, for example,<br>
generally relies on multiple separations of solid particulates from aqueous media, whereby such<br>
separations can be improved using the resin of the present invention. In the overall process,<br>
calcium phosphate is mined from deposits at an average depth of about 25 feet below ground<br>
level. The phosphate rock is initially recovered in a matrix containing sand and clay impurities.<br>
The matrix is first mixed with water to form a slurry, which, typically after mechanical agitation,<br>
is screened to retain phosphate pebbles and to allow fine clay particles to pass through as a clay<br>
slurry effluent with large amounts of water.<br>
[0069] These clay-containing effluents generally have high flow rates and typically carry less<br>
than 10% solids by weight and more often contain only from about 1% to about 5% solids by<br>
weight. The dewatering (e.g., by settling or filtration) of this waste clay, which allows for<br>
recycle of the water, poses a significant challenge for reclamation. The time required to dewater<br>
the clay, however, can be decreased through treatment of the clay slurry effluent, obtained in the<br>
production of phosphate, with the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention. Reduction in<br>
the clay settling time allows for efficient re-use of the purified water, obtained from clay<br>
dewatering, in the phosphate production operation. In one embodiment of the purification<br>
method, wherein the liquid suspension is a clay-containing effluent slurry from a phosphate<br>
production facility, the purified liquid contains less than about 1% solids by weight after a<br>
settling or dewatering time of less than about 1 month.<br>
23<br><br>
[0070] In addition to the phosphate pebbles that are retained by screening and the clay slurry<br>
effluent described above, a mixture of sand and finer particles of phosphate is also obtained in<br>
the initial processing of the mined phosphate matrix. The sand and phosphate in this stream are<br>
separated by froth flotation which, as described earlier, can be improved using the amine-<br>
aldehdye resin of the present invention as a depressant for the sand.<br>
[0071] In the area of slurry dewatering, another specific application of the resin is in the<br>
filtration of coal from water-containing slurries. The dewatering of coal is important<br>
commercially, since the BTU value and hence the quality of the coal decreases with increasing<br>
water content. In one embodiment of the invention, therefore, the amine-aldehyde resin is used<br>
to treat an aqueous coal-containing suspension or slurry prior to dewatering the coal by<br>
filtration.<br>
[0072] Another significant application of the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention is<br>
in the area of sewage treatment, which refers to various processes that are undertaken to remove<br>
contaminants from industrial and municipal waste water. Such processes thereby purify sewage<br>
to provide both purified water that is suitable for disposal into the environment (e.g., rivers,<br>
streams, and oceans) as well as a sludge. Sewage refers to any type of water-containing wastes<br>
which are normally collected in sewer systems and conveyed to treatment facilities. Sewage<br>
therefore includes municipal wastes from toilets (sometimes referred to as "foul waste") and<br>
basins, baths, showers, and kitchens (sometimes referred to as "sullage water"). Sewage also<br>
includes industrial and commercial waste water, (sometimes referred to as "trade waste"), as<br>
well as stormwater runoff from hard-standing areas such as roofs and streets.<br>
[0073] The conventional treatment of sewage often involves preliminary, primary, and<br>
secondary treatment steps. Preliminary treatment refers to the filtration or screening of large<br>
solids such as wood, paper, rags, etc., as well as coarse sand and grit, which would normally<br>
damage pumps. The subsequent primary treatment is then employed to separate most of the<br>
remaining solids by settling in large tanks, where a solids-rich sludge is recovered from the<br>
bottom of these tanks and treated further. A purified water is also recovered and normally<br>
subjected to secondary treatment by biological processes.<br>
[0074] Thus, in one embodiment of the present invention, the settling or sedimentation of<br>
sewage water may comprise treating the sewage with the amine-aldehyde resin of the present<br>
invention.   This treatment may be used to improve the settling operation (either batch or<br>
24<br><br>
continuous), for example, by decreasing the residence time required to effect a given separation<br>
{e.g., based on the purity of the purified water and/or the percent recovery of solids in the<br>
sludge). Otherwise, the improvement may be manifested in the generation of a higher purity of<br>
the purified water and/or a higher recovery of solids in the sludge, for a given settling time.<br>
[0075] After treatment of sewage with the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention and<br>
removing a purified water stream by sedimentation, it is also possible for the amine-aldehyde<br>
resin to be subsequently used for, or introduced into, secondary treatment processes to further<br>
purify the water. Secondary treatment normally relies on the action of naturally occurring<br>
microorganisms to break down organic material. In particular, aerobic biological processes<br>
substantially degrade the biological content of the purified water recovered from primary<br>
treatment. The microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and protozoa) consume biodegradable soluble<br>
organic contaminants (e.g., sugars, fats, and other organic molecules) and bind much of the less<br>
soluble fractions into floes, thereby further facilitating the removal of organic material.<br>
[0076] Secondary treatment relies on "feeding" the aerobic microorganisms oxygen and other<br>
nutrients which allow them to survive and consume organic contaminants. Advantageously, the<br>
amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention, which contains nitrogen, can serve as a "food"<br>
source for microorganisms involved in secondary treatment, as well as potentially an additional<br>
flocculant for organic materials. In one embodiment of the invention, therefore, the sewage<br>
purification method further comprises, after removing purified water (in the primary treatment<br>
step) by sedimentation, further treating the purified water in the presence of microorganisms and<br>
the amine-aldehyde resin, and optionally with an additional amount of amine-aldehyde resin, to<br>
reduce the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the purified water. As is understood in the<br>
art, the BOD is an important measure of water quality and represents the oxygen needed, in mg/1<br>
(or ppm by weight) by microorganisms to oxidize organic impurities over 5 days. The BOD of<br>
the purified water after treatment with microorganisms and the amine-aldehyde resin, is<br>
generally less than 10 ppm, typically less than 5 ppm, and often less than 1 ppm.<br>
[0077] The amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention may also be applied to the<br>
purification of pulp and paper mill effluents. These aqueous waste streams normally contain<br>
solid contaminants in the form of cellulosic materials (e.g., waste paper; bark or other wood<br>
elements, such as wood flakes, wood strands, wood fibers, or wood particles; or plant fibers such<br>
as wheat straw fibers, rice fibers, switchgrass fibers, soybean stalk fibers, bagasse fibers, or<br>
25<br><br>
cornstalk fibers; and mixtures of these contaminants). In accordance with the method of the<br>
present invention, the effluent stream comprising a cellulosic solid contaminant is treated with<br>
the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention, such that purified water may be removed via<br>
sedimentation, flotation, or filtration.<br>
[0078] In the separation of bitumen from sand and/or clay impurities as described previously,<br>
various separation steps may be employed either before or after froth flotation of the bitumen-<br>
containing slurry. These steps can include screening, filtration, and sedimentation, any of which<br>
may benefit from treatment of the oil sand slurry with the amine-aldehyde resin of the present<br>
invention, followed by removal of a portion of the sand and/or clay contaminants in a<br>
contaminant-rich fraction (e.g., a bottoms fraction) or by removal of a purified bitumen fraction.<br>
As described above with respect to phosphate ore processing water effluents, which generally<br>
contain solid clay particles, the treating step can comprise flocculating these contaminants to<br>
facilitate their removal (e.g., by filtration). Waste water effluents from bitumen processing<br>
facilities will likewise contain sand and/or clay impurities and therefore benefit from treatment<br>
with the amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention to dewater them and/or remove at least a<br>
portion of these solid impurities in a contaminant-rich faction. A particular process stream of<br>
interest that is generated during bitumen extraction is known as the "mature fine tails," which is<br>
an aqueous suspension of fine solid particulates that can benefit from dewatering. Often, in the<br>
case of sand and/or clay containing suspensions from a bitumen production facility, separation<br>
of the solid contaminants is sufficient to allow the recovery or removal of a purified liquid or<br>
water stream that can be recycled to the bitumen process.<br>
[0079] The treatment of various intermediate streams and effluents in bitumen production<br>
processes with the resin of the present invention is not limited only to those processes that rely at<br>
least partly on froth flotation of an aqueous bitumen-containing slurry. As is readily<br>
appreciated by those of skill in the art, other techniques (e.g., centrifugation via the "Syncrude<br>
Process") for bitumen purification will generate aqueous intermediate and byproduct streams<br>
from which solid contaminant removal is desirable.<br>
[0080] The amine-aldehyde resins of the present invention can be employed in the removal of<br>
suspended solid particulates, such as sand and clay, in the purification of water, and particularly<br>
for the purpose of rendering it potable. Moreover, resins of the present invention have the<br>
additional ability to complex metallic cations (e.g., lead and mercury cations) allowing these<br>
26<br><br>
unwanted contaminants to be removed in conjunction with solid particulates. Therefore, resins<br>
of the present invention can be used to effectively treat impure water having both solid<br>
particulate contaminants as well as metallic cation contaminants. Without being bound by<br>
theory, it is believed that electronegative moieties, such as the carbonyl oxygen atom on the<br>
urea-formaldehyde resin polymer backbone, complex with undesired cations to facilitate their<br>
removal. Generally, this complexation occurs at a pH of the water that is greater than about 5<br>
and typically in the range from about 7 to about 9.<br>
[0081] Another possible mechanism for the removal of metallic cations is based on their<br>
association with negatively charged solid particulates. Flocculation and removal of these<br>
particulates will therefore also cause, at least to some extent, the removal of metallic cations.<br>
Regardless of the mechanism, in one embodiment, the treatment and removal of both of these<br>
contaminants can be carried out according to the present invention to yield potable water.<br>
[0082] The removal of metallic cations may represent the predominant or even the sole means<br>
of water purification that is effected by the amine-aldehyde resin, for example when the water to<br>
be purified contains little or no solid particulates. Solid forms of the resin may be used to<br>
remove cations in a continuous process whereby the impure water containing metallic cations is<br>
continuously passed through a fixed bed of the resin. Alternatively, soluble forms of the resin,<br>
generally having a lower molecular weight, may be added to the impure water in order to treat it.<br>
The complexed cations in this case can be removed, for example, by ultrafiltration through a<br>
porous membrane (e.g., polysulfone) having a molecular weight cutoff that is less than the<br>
molecular weight of the resin. The water purification methods described herein may also be<br>
used in conjunction with known methods including reverse osmosis, UV irradiation, etc.<br>
[0083] To increase the effectiveness of resins of the present invention in complexing with<br>
metallic cations, it may be desirable to modify this amine-aldehyde resin with one or more<br>
anionic functional groups. Such modifications are known in the art and can involve the reaction<br>
of the resin to incorporate the desired functional group (e.g., by sulfonation with sodium<br>
metabisulfite). Alternatively, the modification is achieved during preparation of the resin (e.g.f<br>
during condensation) by incorporating an anionic co-monomer, such as sodium acrylate, into the<br>
amine-aldehyde resin. Representative functionalities with which the resin, including a urea-<br>
formaldehyde resin, may be modified include the anionic functional groups bisulfite, acrylate,<br>
acetate, carbonate, azide, amide, etc.   Procedures for modifying the resin with additional<br>
27<br><br>
functionalities are known to those having skill in the art. The incorporation of anionic<br>
functional groups into the resin is also often employed in separations involving the purification<br>
of slurries containing solid clay particles (e.g., by froth flotation, flocculation, etc.), including<br>
the purification of kaolin clay ore. Without being bound by theory, sulfonation of the resin or<br>
the incorporation of other anionic functional groups can also increase hydrogen bonding<br>
between the resin and the surrounding aqueous phase to inhibit condensation of the resin or<br>
otherwise improve its stability.<br>
[0084] As described above, therefore, the present invention, in one embodiment, is a method<br>
for purifying water containing a metallic cation by treating the water with an amine-aldehdye<br>
resin as described herein and which may be modified with an anionic group. Removal of at least<br>
' a portion of the metallic cations may be effected by retaining them on a fixed bed of the resin or<br>
otherwise by filtering them out. In the latter case, removal by filtration such as membrane<br>
filtration is made possible by the association of the metallic cations either directly with the<br>
amine-aldehyde resin or indirectly with the resin via solid particulates, for which the resin has<br>
affinity. In the case of indirect association, as described earlier, flocculation of the solid<br>
particulates will also necessarily agglomerate at least a portion of the metallic cations, which<br>
may therefore be removed by flotation or sedimentation of these particulates.<br>
[0085] The amine-aldehyde resin of the present invention is therefore advantageously used to<br>
treat water for the removal of metallic cations such as arsenic, lead, cadmium, copper, and<br>
mercury that are known to pose health risks when ingested. These cations thus include As+5,<br>
Pb+2, Cd+2, Cu+2, Hg+2, and mixtures thereof. Generally, a degree of removal is effected such<br>
that the purified water, after treatment, is essentially free of one or more of the above metallic<br>
cations. By "essentially free" is meant that the concentration(s) of one or more metallic<br>
cation(s) of interest is/are reduced to concentration(s) at or below those considered safe (e.g., by<br>
a regulatory agency such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency). Therefore, in various<br>
embodiments, the purified water will contain at most about 10 ppb of As+5, at most about 15 ppb<br>
of Pb+2, at most about 5 ppb of Cd+2, at most about 1.3 ppm of Cu+2, and/or at most about 2 ppb<br>
of Hg+2. That is, generally at least one, typically at least two, and often all, of the above-<br>
mentioned cations are at or below these threshold concentration levels in the purified water.<br>
[0086] In any of the applications described herein, it is possible to stabilize the amine-<br>
aldehyde resin of the present invention by reaction with an alcohol (i.e., etherification). Without<br>
28<br><br>
being bound by theory, it is believed that etherification of pendant alkylol functionalities can<br>
inhibit further condensation of the amine-aldehyde resin (e.g., condensation of the urea-<br>
formaldehyde resin with itself). This can ultimately hinder or prevent the precipitation of the<br>
resin during long term storage, such that, relative to their corresponding non-etherified resins,<br>
the etherified resins can have increased molecular weight without an accompanying loss in<br>
stability.<br>
[0087] Etherification thus involves reacting the amine-aldehyde adducts or condensates, or<br>
even the resins, prepared as described above, with an alcohol. In one embodiment, a urea-<br>
formaldehyde resin is etherified with an alcohol having from 1 to 8 carbon atoms.<br>
Representative alcohols for use in the etherification include methanol (e.g., to effect<br>
methylation), ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, n-butanol, and isobutanol. In exemplary<br>
preparations of etherified resins, the amine-aldehyde adduct or condensate reaction product is<br>
heated to a temperature from about 70°C to about 120°C in the presence of an alcohol until the<br>
etherification is complete. An acid such as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, formic acid, acetic<br>
acid, nitric acid, alum, iron chloride, and other acids may be added before or during the reaction<br>
with alcohol. Often, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid is employed.<br>

[0090] The following examples are set forth as representative of the present invention. These<br>
examples are not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention as these and other<br>
equivalent embodiments will be apparent in view of the present disclosure and appended claims.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0091] Various urea-formaldehyde resins were prepared as low molecular weight condensate<br>
resins, initially under alkaline conditions to form methylolated urea adducts, and then under<br>
acidic conditions to form the condensate. The condensation reaction was stopped by raising the<br>
pH of the condensation reaction mixture. Other preparation conditions were as described above.<br>
These resins are identified in Table 1 below with respect to their molecular weight (Mol. Wt.) in<br>
grams/mole and their approximate normalized weight percentages of free urea, cyclic urea<br>
species (cyclic urea), mono-methylolated urea (Mono), and combined di-/tri-methylolated urea<br>
(Di/Tri). In each case, the resins were in a solution having a resin solids content of 45-70%, a<br>
viscosity of 500 cps or less, and a free formaldehyde content of less than 5% by weight.<br>

* Resin B is a very stable urea-formaldehyde resin, having a high cyclic urea content. This<br>
resin is described in U.S. Patent No. 6,114,491.<br>
** Resin C was formed by adding 2% by weight of diethylenetriamine and 2% by weight<br>
dicyandiamide to the mixture of urea and formaldehyde during resin preparation.<br>
***Resin D' was formed by adding 0.75% by weight cyclic phosphate ester to the mixture of<br>
urea and formaldehyde during resin preparation. The resin was a low molecular weight<br>
formulation with a high content of free urea, essentially no free formaldehyde, and a high<br>
content of non-volatiles (about 70% solids).<br>
a Number average molecular weight determined using gel permeation chromatography (GPC)<br>
with appropriately sized PLgel™ columns (Polymer Laboratories, Inc., Amherst, MA,<br>
USA), 0.5% glacial acetic acid/tetrahydrofuran mobile phase at 1500 psi, and polystyrene,<br>
phenol, and bisphenol-A calibration standards.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0092] Samples of urea-formaldehyde (UF) resins similar to those described in Example 1<br>
were tested for their ability to settle graphite and bentonite, suspended in aqueous media. In<br>
four separate experiments, 4.4 gram samples of particulate graphite (two experiments) and<br>
particulate bentonite (two experiments) were suspended in 220 grams of water in a jar, and the<br>
jars were in each case shaken vigorously for two minutes to suspend the solid particles.<br>
However, 22 grams of UF resin were added to one of the jars containing the graphite and also to<br>
31<br><br>
one of the jars containing bentonite prior to shaking. The four jars were left to stand for 24<br>
hours and observed to evaluate the effect of the added UF resin on the solid-liquid separation via<br>
settling. The four jars were photographed and are shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0093] As is apparent from FIG. 1, in the leftmost jar, to which UF resin was added, the<br>
graphite was settled on the bottom of the jar. No graphite was visible at the air-water interface<br>
or on the jar surface. The UF resin used in this case also settled with the graphite. In contrast,<br>
the second jar from the left, to which no resin was added, had a significant amount of the<br>
graphite clinging to its surface. Much of the graphite also remained at the air-water interface.<br>
The use of UF resin, therefore, greatly facilitated the separation of graphite from water via<br>
settling.<br>
[0094] Likewise, the bentonite was settled on the bottom of the third jar from the left, to which<br>
UF resin was added. The opaqueness of the liquid phase resulted from the use, in this case, of a<br>
water-dispersible UF resin. In contrast, the rightmost jar, to which no resin was added, had a<br>
significant amount of solid bentonite clinging to its surface and remaining at the air-water<br>
interface. Again, the use of UF resin significantly improved the separation of bentonite via<br>
settling.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0095] A urea-formaldehyde (UF) resin similar to those described in Example 1, was tested<br>
for its ability to reduce the dewatering time, by filtration, of various solid contaminants (i.e.,<br>
montmorillonite, bentonite, and graphite) suspended in aqueous slurries. In each experiment, a<br>
25 gram sample of solid contaminant was uniformly slurried with 100 grams of 0.01 molar<br>
KNO3. The pH of the slurry was measured. The slurry was then subjected to vacuum filtration<br>
using a standard 12.7 cm diameter Buchner funnel apparatus and 11.0 cm diameter Whatman<br>
qualitative #1 filter paper. Except for the first experiment using montmorillonte, the dewatering<br>
time in each case was the time required to recover 100 ml of filtrate through the filter paper. In<br>
the case of montmorillonite dewatering, the solid used was so fine that an excess of 5 minutes<br>
would have been required to remove 100 ml of filtrate. Therefore, the relative dewatering time<br>
was based on the amount of filtrate removed in 5 minutes.<br>
[0096] For each solid contaminant tested, a control experiment as run, followed by an<br>
identical experiment, differing only in (1) the addition of 0.5-1 grams of silane modified UF<br>
32<br><br>
resin to the slurry and (2) mixing of the slurry for one additional minute, after a uniform slurry<br>
was obtained upon stirring. Results are shown below in Table 2.<br>

quantities, to significantly decrease the dewatering time for a number of solid particles.<br>

Modified resins are disclosed for removing a wide variety of solids and/or ionic species from the<br>
liquids in which they are suspended and/or dissolved. These modified resins are especially useful<br>
as froth flotation depressants in the beneficiation of many types of materials (e.g., mineral and<br>
metal ores), including the beneficiation of impure coal comprising clay impurities, as well as in<br>
the separation of valuable bitumen from solid contaminants such as sand. The modified resins<br>
are also useful for treating aqueous liquid suspensions to remove solid particulates, as well as for<br>
removing metallic ions in the purification of water. The modified resins comprise a base resin<br>
that is modified with a coupling agent, which is highly selective for binding to solid<br>
contaminants and especially siliceous materials such as sand or clay.</td>
