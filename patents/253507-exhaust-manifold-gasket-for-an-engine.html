EXHAUST MANIFOLD GASKET<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/563,497, filed April 19, 2004.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.   Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The subject invention generally relates to an exhaust manifold gasket for use in an automotive exhaust system. More specifically, the subject invention relates to an exhaust manifold gasket that is adaptable for installation on a variety of engines.<br>
2.   Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] It is known that automotive exhaust systems interface with an engine to convey exhaust gas away from cylinders in the engine. More specifically, an exhaust manifold is mounted to a cylinder head of the engine, and receives the exhaust gas as the exhaust gas exits the cylinder head.<br>
[0004] Exhaust manifold gaskets are known in the art. Exhaust manifold gaskets seal the exhaust manifold to the cylinder head. The exhaust manifold gaskets prevent the exhaust gas from escaping, which could create noise, cause heat damage to components in the engine compartment, and/or create environmental issues. The exhaust manifold gaskets, which are also characterized as hot static seals due to the high temperatures that the exhaust manifold gaskets are required to withstand (up to 600Â°C and higher), are often made of one or more layers of steel. Some auto manufacturers impose additional specification requirements. For example, some manufactures require that an anti-friction coating, which is also heat resistant, be applied on a side of the exhaust manifold gasket that is in contact with the exhaust manifold. The anti-friction coating enables slight movement of the exhaust manifold with respect to the engine to optimize the seal between the exhaust manifold and the cylinder head.<br><br>
[0005] For engines having a V-shaped structure, two cylinder heads are arranged on opposite sides of the engine, due to the location of the cylinders. Thus, the exhaust system is required to have two separate exhaust manifolds on opposite sides of the engine, which requires two respective exhaust manifold gaskets. Fasteners are configured for the exhaust manifolds on the opposite sides of the engine to be generally mirror images of each other, which presents a number of problems for manufacturers of components for the exhaust system, in particular the exhaust manifold gaskets. For example, as described in further detail below, the exhaust manifold gasket must be flipped to be installed on the opposite sides of the engine, i.e., a different surface of the gasket faces the exhaust manifold on the opposite sides of the engine. As a result, both sides of the exhaust manifold gasket must be coated with the anti-friction coating. [0006] Exhaust manifold gaskets are generally configured to have a series of mounting holes, each for receiving a fastener on the engine. Referring to Figure 1, a conventional exhaust manifold gasket is disclosed. With this prior art exhaust manifold gasket, the mounting holes are diagonally spaced on each side of the exhaust manifold gasket and match a configuration of fasteners on the engine. More specifically, the exhaust manifold gasket defines multiple openings. The openings are defined along an axis A. One mounting hole is defined on each side of each opening. The mounting holes for each opening are arranged diagonally across the opening such that an axis B between the mounting holes intersects the axis A between the openings at a non-perpendicular angle. Because no complementary set of holes exist, the exhaust manifold gasket must be flipped during installation to fit the opposite side of the engine.<br>
[0007] However, for the exhaust manifold gasket described above, one surface of the exhaust manifold gasket faces the exhaust manifold on one side of the V-shaped engine, and an opposite surface of the exhaust manifold gasket faces the exhaust manifold on the other side of the engine. As such, the entire exhaust manifold gasket must be coated with the anti-friction coating, even though the coating is only required for the surface that is in contact with the exhaust manifold.   Anti-friction coatings are relatively costly.<br><br>
Therefore, coating both sides of the exhaust manifold gasket is more expensive than coating only one side of the exhaust manifold gasket.<br>
[0008]    Thus, there is an opportunity to overcome the deficiencies of the related art and lower the cost of the exhaust manifold gasket.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009]    Other advantages of the present invention will be readily appreciated as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings wherein: [0010]    Figure 1 is a plan view of a exhaust manifold gasket of the prior art; [0011]    Figure 2 is a partially exploded perspective view of an engine, an exhaust manifold, and an exhaust manifold gasket of the subject invention; [0012]    Figure 3a is a plan view of a first embodiment of the exhaust manifold gasket; [0013]    Figure 3b is a cross-sectional side view of a portion of the exhaust manifold gasket of Figure 3a;<br>
[0014] Figure 4 is another plan view of the exhaust manifold gasket of Figure 1; and [0015]    Figure 5 is a plan view of another embodiment of the exhaust manifold gasket.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0016] Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, an exhaust manifold gasket is shown generally at 10. The exhaust manifold gasket 10 is adaptable for installation on engines 12 preferably having a V-shaped configuration. However, it is also to be appreciated that the exhaust manifold gasket 10 may be installed on engines that have various other configurations, including, but not limited to, in-line engines.<br>
[0017] Referring to Figure 2, an exhaust manifold 16 is mounted to a cylinder head 14 of the engine 12, and receives the exhaust gas as the exhaust gas exits the cylinder head 14. The exhaust manifold 16 conveys the exhaust gas through the exhaust system. The<br><br>
V-shaped engine 12 also includes a second cylinder head that is not shown. A second exhaust manifold, also not shown, is mounted to the second cylinder head. Fasteners 30 are configured on each side of the engine 12 for mounting the exhaust manifold 16 and the second exhaust manifold to the engine 12. Preferably, the fasteners 30 are bolts, with a nut 31 securing the exhaust manifold gasket 10 and the exhaust manifold 16 to the engine 12. The configuration of fasteners 30 on one side of the engine 12 may be a mirror image of the configuration of fasteners (not shown) on the other side of the engine 12. Due to the design of the exhaust manifold gasket 10, however, the same side of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 will face the exhaust manifold 16 no matter which side of the engine 12 the exhaust manifold gasket 10 is installed on. The significance of this feature of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 of the present invention will be discussed in further detail below.<br>
[0018] The exhaust manifold gasket 10, also known as a hot static seal 10, has an antifriction coating 11. The anti-friction coating 11, which is heat resistant, is preferably applied to a surface 13 of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 that is to be in contact with the exhaust manifold 16. The anti-friction coating 11 preferably includes molybdenum or compounds including molybdenum, such as molybdenum disulfide, which provides excellent anti-friction properties. However, other anti-friction coatings may be used. [0019] The exhaust manifold gasket 10 may be made of embossed steel, high-temperature fiber material, graphite, ceramic composites, or any other type of material commonly used for exhaust manifold gaskets in the exhaust system. Furthermore, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 may include multiple layers.<br>
[0020]    Referring to Figures 3a and 4, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 defines an opening 20 having an axis 21 for allowing the exhaust gas to pass from the cylinder head 14 to the exhaust manifold 16. The opening 20 lies along an axis A of the gasket 10. Preferably, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 has at least two lobes 18, with each lobe defining one opening 20.  However, it is to be appreciated that the exhaust manifold<br><br>
gasket 10 may only include one lobe 18. The lobes 18 may be separated by relatively narrower neck regions 19.<br>
[0021] As shown in Figure 2, two separate exhaust manifold gaskets 10 may be installed on the engine 12. Alternatively, as shown in Figure 4, another exhaust manifold gasket 110 defining four openings 20 may be installed on the engine 12. [0022] Each lobe 18 includes an apron 22 that surrounds each opening 20 for facilitating attachment of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 to the engine 12. More specifically, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 is produced from a blank. The blank is preferably stamped out of a sheet of material and has an outer perimeter 24, which preferably remains unchanged in the final exhaust manifold gasket 10, which is shown in Figure 3a. Alternatively, excess portions 21 of the apron 22, which are crosshatched in Figure 4, may be trimmed off, leaving tabs 26 extending from the openings 20. However, since the excess portions 21 do not affect attachment of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 to the engine 12 and require additional processing to remove, it is preferred that the excess portions 21 remain on the exhaust manifold gasket 10. [0023] Referring to Figure 3b, a cross-section of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 is shown. The exhaust manifold gasket 10 preferably has two layers which separate around the opening 20.<br>
[0024] A first set of mounting holes 28 is defined in the apron 22 surrounding each opening 20. The mounting holes 28 receive a stud or a fastener (e.g., a bolt) 30. The mounting holes 28 are diagonally spaced on each side of the opening 20, i.e., with one hole 28 defined on each side of each opening 20. The mounting holes 28 coiTespond to the configuration of studs 30 on one side of the engine 10. The mounting holes 28 are spaced such that a line B between the mounting holes 28 intersects the axis A between the openings 20 at a non-perpendicular angle.<br>
[0025] A second set of mounting holes 32 is also defined in the apron 22 surrounding each opening 20. Like the first set of mounting holes 28, the second set of mounting holes 32 are diagonally spaced on each side of the opening 20.   The second set of<br><br>
mounting holes 32 are symmetrical to the first set of mounting holes 28 about an axis D passing through a center of the opening 20. Furthermore, the mounting holes 32 are spaced such that a line C between the mounting holes 32 intersects the axis A at a non-perpendicular angle. The position of the second set of mounting holes 32 enables the same exhaust manifold gasket 10 to be installed on the other side of the engine 12 such that the surface 13 of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 in contact with the exhaust manifold 16 remains the same on each side of the engine 12. In other words, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 may be simply installed on each side of the engine 12 without flipping the exhaust manifold gasket 10. As such, the gasket 10 has reflective symmetry across a longitudinal plane of symmetry containing the axis.<br>
[0026] Due to the two distinct sets of mounting holes 28, 32, and also due to the diagonal spacing of each mounting hole 285 32, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 is designed such that the surface 13 is in contact with the exhaust manifold 16 regardless of whether the configuration of studs 30 is identical or a mirror image from one side of the engine 12 to the other. As a result, the relatively expensive anti-friction coating is only required on one side 13 of the exhaust manifold gasket 10 to reduce the cost of manufacturing the exhaust manifold gasket. In addition, the exhaust manifold gasket 10 provides for ease of installation on the engine 12 since flipping is not required to install the exhaust manifold gasket 10 on the engine 12.<br>
[0027] Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. The invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
