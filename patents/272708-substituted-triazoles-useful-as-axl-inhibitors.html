SUBSTITUTED TRIAZOLES USEFUL AS AXL INHIBITORS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) of U.S. Provisional Patent Application No, 60/983,352, filed November 15, 2007; U.S. Provisional Patent 5 Application No. 60/883,713, -filed January 5, 2007; and Provisional Patent Application No. 60/882,893, filed December 29, 2006, where these three provisional applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention is directed to substituted triazoles and pharmaceutical<br>
10 compositions thereof which are useful as inhibitors of the receptor protein tyrosine kinase known as Axl. This invention is also directed to methods of using the compounds and compositions in treating diseases and conditions associated with Axl activity, particularly in treating diseases and conditions associated with angiogenesis and/or cell proliferation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
15	All of the protein kinases that have been identified to date in the human genome<br>
share a highly conserved catalytic domain of around 30Q aa. This domain folds into a bibbed structure in which reside ATP-binding and catalytic sites. The complexity of protein kinase regulation allows many potential mechanisms of inhibition including competition wfth activating ligarids, modulation of positive and negative regulators,<br>
20 interference with protein dimorization, and allosteric or competitive inhibition at the substrate or ATP binding sites.<br>
Axl (also known as UFO, ARK, and Tyro7; nucleotide accession numbers NM_Q21913 and NM_001699; protein accession numbers NPJJS6713 and NP_Q01690} is a receptor protein tyrosine kinase (RTK) that comprises a C-terminal extracellular<br>
25 frgand-binding domain and N-terminal cytoplasmic region containing the catalytic domain. The extracellular domain of Axl has a unique structure that juxtaposes Immunoglobulin and fibronectin Type Ill repeats and is reminiscent of the structure of neural cell adhesion molecules. Axl and its two close relatives, Mer /Nyk and Sky {Tyro3 / Rse I Dtk), collectively known as the Tyro3 family of RTK'sr alE bind and are stimulated<br>
30 to varying degrees by the same ligand, Gas6 (growth arrest specific-6), a ~76kDa<br>
secreted protein with significant homology to the coagulation cascade regulator, Protein <br>
S. fn addition to binding to ligands, the Axl extracellular domain has been shown to undergo homophilic interactions that mediate eel! aggregation suggesting that one important function of Axi may be to mediate cell-cell adhesion,<br>
Axl is predominantly expressed in the vasculature in both endothelial cells (EC's) 5 and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC's) and iri cells of the myeloid lineage and is also detected in breast epithelial cells, chondrocytes, Sertoli cells and neurons. Several functions including protection from apoptosis induced by serum starvation, TNF-a or the viral protein E1 A, as well as migration and cell differentiation have been ascribed to Axl signaling in cell culture. However, Axl -I- mice exhibit no overt developmental phenotype 10 and the physiological function of Axl in vivo is not clearfy established in the literature.<br>
Angiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels) is limited to functions such as wound healing and the female reproductive cycle in healthy adults. This physiological process has been co-opted by tumors, thus securing an adequate blood supply that feeds tumor growth and facilitates metastasis. Deregulated angiogenesis also a feature 15 of many other diseases (for example, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, endometriosis and blindness due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), retinopathy of prematurity and diabetes) and often contributes to the progression or pathology of the condition.<br>
The overexpression of Ax! andfor its ligand has also been reported in a wide variety of solid tumor types including, but not limited to, breast, renal, endometrial, 2D ovarian, thyroid, non-small cell lung carcinoma, and uveal melanoma as well as in<br>
myeloid leukemia's. Furthermore, it possesses "transforming activity in NIH3T3 and 32D cells. It has been demonstrated that loss of Axl expression in tumor cells blocks the growth of solid human neoplasms in an in vivo MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma xenograft model. Taken together, these data suggest Axl signaling can independently regulate EC 25 angiogenesis and tumor growth and thus represents a novel target class for tumor therapeutic development.<br>
The expression of Axl and Gas6 proteins is up regulated in a variety of other disease states including endometriosisr vascular injury and kidney disease and Axl signaling is functionally implicated in the latter two indications, Axl - Gas6 signaling 30 amplifies platelet responses and is implicated in thrombus formation. Axl may thus<br>
potentially represent a therapeutic target for a number of diverse pathological conditions including solid tumors, including, but not limited to, breast, renal, endometrial, ovarian, thyroid, non-small cell lung carcinoma and uveal melanoma; liquid tumors, including but not limited to, feukemias (particularly myeloid leukemias) and lymphomas; 35 endometriosis, vascular disease / injury {including but not limited to restenosis,<br>
atheroscSercsis and thrombosis), psoriasis; visual impairment due to macular degeneration; diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity; kidney disease {including but not limited to glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy and renal transplant rejection), rheumatoid arthritis; osteoporosis, osteoarthritis and cataracts.<br>

25 condition and its severity, and the age of the mammal to be treated, but can be determined routinely by one of ordinary skill in the art having regard to his own knowledge and to this disclosure.<br>
"Treating" or "treatment" as used herein covers the treatment of the disease or condition of interest in a mammal, preferably a human, having the disease or condition of<br>
30 interest, and includes:<br>
(I) preventing the disease or condition from occurring in a mammal, in particular, when such mammal is predisposed to the condition but has not yet been diagnosed as having it;<br>
(il) Inhibiting the disease or condition, i.e., arresting its development;<br>
35	(iii) relieving the disease or condition, i.e., causing regression of the disease<br>
or condition; or<br>
(iv) stabilizing (he disease or condition.<br>
As used herein, the terms "disease" and "condition" may be used interchangeably or may be different in that the particular malady or condition may not have a known 5 causative agent (so that etiology has not yet been worked out) and it is therefore not yet recognized as a disease but only as an undesirable condition or syndrome, wherein a more or less specific set of symptoms have been identified by clinicians.<br>
The compounds of the invention, or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may contain one or more asymmetric centres and may thus give rise to anantiomers. 10 diastereomers, and other stereoisomer^ forms that may be defined, in terms of absolute stereochemistry, as [Ry or (S)- or, as (D)- or (L}- for amino acids. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomers, as well as their racemic and optically pure forms. Optically active (+) and (-), (R)- and (S)-, or (D)- and (L)- isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional 15 techniques, such as HPLC using a chiral column. When the compounds described herein contain clofinic double bonds or other centres of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and 2 geometric isomers. Likewise, ail tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>
A "stereoisomer" refers to a compound made up of the same atoms bonded by 20 the same bonds but having different three-dimensional structures, which are not interchangeable. The present invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and includes "enantiomers", which refers to two stereoisomers whose molecules are nonsuperiimposeable mirror images of one another.<br>
A "tautomer" refers to a proton shift from one atom of a molecule to another atom 25 of the same molecule. The present invention includes tautomers of any said compounds.<br>
"AtropIsomers" are stereoisomers resulting from hindered rotation about single bonds where the barrier to notation is high enough to allow for the isolation of the conformers (Eliel, E. L.; Wiien, S. H. Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds; Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 1994; Chapter 14). Atropisomerism is significant because it introduces 30 an element of chirality in the absence of stereogenic atoms. The invention is meant to encompass atropisomers, for example in cases of limited rotation around the single bonds emanating from the core triazole structure, atropisomers are also possible and are also specifically included in the compounds of the invention.<br>
The chemical naming protocol and structure diagrams U3ed herein are a modified 35 form of the I.U.PAC. nomenclature system wherein the compounds of the invention are <br>
named herein as derivatives of the central core structure, i.e., the triazole structure. For complex chemical names employed herein, a substituent group is named before the group to which It attaches. For example, cyciopropylethyi comprises an ethyl backbone with cyclopropyl substituent. In chemical sLructure diagrams, all bonds are identified, 5 except for some carbon atoms, which are assumed to be bonded to sufficient hydrogen atoms to complete the valency.<br>
For purposes of this invention, the depiction of the bond attaching the R5 substituent to the parent triazole moiety in formula (I), as shown below:<br><br><br>
10 is intended to include only the two regtoisomers shown below, i.e,, compounds of formula (la) and (lb):<br><br><br>
The numbering system of the ring atoms in compounds of formula (la) is shown<br>

UTILITY AMD TESTING DF THE COMPOUNDS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The oncogenic RTK, Axl, was recently identified, using a retro viral-based functional genetic screening protocol, as a regulator of haptotactic migration, which is a 5 key event in angiogenesis. Axl inhibition by RNAi-mediated silencing blocked endothelial cell migration, proliferation and in vitro tube formation. These observations, which were disclosed at the American Association Cancer Research General Meeting, April 10-20, 2005, Anaheim, California, and The 7th Annual Symposium on Anti-Angiogenic Agents, February 10-13, 2005, San Diego, California; [Requirement for The Receptor Tyrosine 10 Kinase Axl in Angiogenesis and Tumor Growth, Holland, S.J, Powell, M.J., Franci, C„ Chan, E., Friera, A.M., Afchison, R., Xu, W., McLaughlin, J., Swift,S.E., Pali, E., Yam, G.f Wong, S., Xu, X., Hu, Y., Lasaga, J., Shen, M., Yu, S„ Daniel, R„ Hitoshi, Y., Bogenberger, J,, Nor, J.E., Payan, D.G and Lorens, J.B), were substantiated by an in vivo study which demonstrated that stable, shRNAi-mediated Axl knockdown impaired 15 formation of functional human blood vessels in a mouse model of human angiogenesis. These observations were published in a peer reviewed journal (Holland SJ, Powell MJ, Franci C, Chan EW, Friera AM, Atchison RE, McLaughlin J, Swift SE, Paii ES, Yam G, Wong S, Lasaga J, Shen MR, Yu S, Xu W, Hitoshi Y, Bogenberger J, Nor JE, Payan DG.

Published Patent Application 2005/0118604 and European Patent Application 1 563 094, the disclosures of which are incorporated in full by reference. Axl signaling, therefore, impacts multiple functions required for neovascularization in vitro, and regulates angiogenesis in vivo. Regulation of these pro-angiogenic processes required the 25 catalytic activity of Axl, Thus, Axl-mediated angiogenic stimulation would be amenable to modulation by a small molecule Inhibitor of Axl catalytic activity.<br>
Accordingly, the compounds of the invention are small molecule inhibitors of Axl catalytic activity, and are therefore useful in treating diseases and conditions which are associated with Axl catalytic activity Including those diseases and conditions which are 30 characterized by angiogenesis and/or cell proliferation. In particular, the compounds of the invention and pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are useful in treating diseases and conditions which are alleviated by the modulation of Axl activity. For purposes of this invention, diseases and condtions which are alleviated by the "modulation of Axl activity" includes diseases and conditions which are alleviated by a <br>
decrease in Axt activity arid diseases and conditions which are alleviated by an increase in Axl activity. Preferably such diseases and conditions are alleviated by a decrease in Axl activity. Diseases and conditions which are alleviated by the modulation of Axl activity include, but are not limited to, solid tumors, including, but not limited to, breast, 5 renal, endometrial, ovarian, thyroid, and non-small cell lung carcinoma, melanoma, prostate carcinoma, sarcoma, gastric cancer and uveal melanoma; liquid tumors, including but not limited to, leukemias (particularly myeloid leukemias) and lymphomas; endometriosis, vascular disease (injury (including but not limited to restenosis, atherosclerosis and thrombosis), psoriasis; visual impairment due to macular 10 degeneration; diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity; kidney disease<br>
(including but not limited to glomerulonephritis, diabetic nephropathy and renal transplant rejection), rheumatoid arthritis; osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and cataracts,<br>

METHODS: Day 1:<br>
A 96 well TC (tissue culture treated) plate was coated with 10^g/mL poly-L- Lysine at 373C for 30 min, washed twice with PBS, and air-dried for 5 minutes before 25 cells were added. Hela cells were seeded at 10,000 cells/well and the cells were starved in 100 |JL starvation medium containing Axl/Fcfor24 hrs.<br>
Pay.2:<br>
The cells were pre-treated with test compounds by adding 10Q pL of 2X test compound to the starvation medium on the cells, The cells were incubated at 37°C for 1 30 hr before stimulation.<br>
The cells were stimulated by Axl-antibody cross-linking as follows: A 5X iEV2nd Axl antibody mixture was made (37.5pg/mL 157 100|jgfrnL 2nd) in starvation medium and nutated at 4'C with thorough mixing for 1-2 hours for clustering. The resulting mix was <br>
warmed to 37°C. 50pL of 5X Axl 1Et /2nd of antibody cluster was added to the cells and the cells were incubated at 37C,C for 5 min.<br>
After 5 minutes stimulation, the plate was flicked to remove medium and the plate was tapped onto paper towels. Formaldehyde (4.0% in PBS, 1D0 pL) was added to fix 5 the cells and the cells were incubated at ambient temperature for 20 min without shaking.<br>
The cells were washed with a plate washor buffer to remove the formaldehyde solution, The plate was flicked to removed excess wash buffer and tapped onto paper towels. Quenching buffer (100 pL) was added to each well and the cells were incubaled 10 at ambient temperature for 20 minutes without shaking.<br>
The cells were washed with a plate washer buffer to remove the quenching buffer. Blocking buffer (100 pL) was added and the cells were incubated at ambierrt temperature for at least an hour with gentle shaking.<br>
The cells were washed with a plate washer buffer and diluted primary antibody 15 (50 pL) was added to each well (blocking buffer was added to the negative control wells instead). The plates were incubated overnight at 4° C with gentle shaking. Day 3:<br>
The wash buffer was removed, diluted secondary antibody (100 pL) was added, and the cells were incubated at ambient temperature for 1 hour with gentle shaking. 20 During the incubation, the chemiluminescent reagent was brought to ambient temperature.<br>
The secondary antibody was removed by washing the cells 1X with wash buffer, 1X with PBS by plate washer, The PBS was removed from the plate and the chemiluminescent reagent (SO pL; 40 pl_ A and 40 pL B) was added to each well at 25 ambient temperature.<br>
The resulting chemiluminescence was read with a Luminomitor within 10 minutes to minimize changes in signal inLensity. After reading the chemiluminescence, the cells were washed 1X with wash buffer and 1X with PBS by plate washer. The plate was tapped onto paper towels to remove excess liquid from wells and air-dried at ambient 30 temperature for 5 minutes.<br>
Crystal Violet working solution (00 pL) was added to each well and the cells were incubated at ambient temperature for 30 min. The crystal violet solution was removed, and the wells were rinsed wiLh PBS, then washed 3X with PBS (200 pL) for 5 minutes each.<br>
35	5% SDS solution (70 pL) was added to each well and the cells were incubated on <br>
a shaker for 30 min at ambienL temperature.<br>
The absorbance was read at 590 nM on a Wallac photospec. The 590nM readings indicated the relative cell number in each well. This relative call number was then used to normalize each luminescence reading.<br>
