3.PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical Field<br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel method for preparation of p-carbonylphenoxy-isobutyric acid ester derivatives having medicinal value and more particularly to a novel process for producing p-carbonyl phenoxy-isobutric acid derivative (commonly known as fenofibrate) represented by the following general Formula I:<br>
0      CH,<br>

JJ H3C<br>
O "^CH, CH3<br>

Formula I<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The compound represented by the above-mentioned general Formula I, namely the<br>
objective compound of the present invention, is known to be useful as a lipids /<br>
cholesterol     lowering    agent;    moreover, ' it    acts    as    normolipidemiant    and<br>
hypocholesterolemiant agents. The free acid of compound of Formula I is known to<br>
induce gastric ulcers .when administered by oral route and therefore product is desired to<br>
be of high purity &amp;' free from said acid impurity. For details on the synthesis and<br>
pharmaceutical use of the above compounds, please see US4058552, US2004073058,<br>
US4739101,etc.<br>
US4058552 patent gives two processes for the preparation of p-carbonylphenoxy-<br>
isobutyic acid ester derivatives of the general Formula I, which are represented in the<br>
following scheme.<br>
Scheme<br>
A:<br><br><br>

Formula II	Formula IV<br>
In the first alternative, the phenol derivative of Formula II is reacted with bromo-isobutyric acid to form a p-carbonylphenoxy-isobutyric acid Formula IV. The p-carbonylphenoxy-isobutyric acid of Formula IV is then isolated and converted to the title compound by first transforming to corresponding acid chloride using thionyl chloride followed by esterification with isoprpanol to obtain fenofibrate.<br>
In the second alternative the p-carbonylphenol derivative of Formula II is reacted with acetone and chloroform in presence of sodium hydroxide to form the p-carbonylphenoxy-isobutyric, acid, , which is isolated, converted to its acid chloride using thionyl chloride followed by esterification with isoprpanol to provide fenofibrate in a three step procedure.<br>
The patentee had also pointed out that alternative A is not preferred due to lower yields<br>
„■■*.■.'■■*■'	*   '      *<br>
and purity. It can be seen that both methods are multi-step process and not suitable to yield high purity Fenofibrate in good yield, as the esterification of p-carbonylphenoxy-isobutyric acid of formula IV via the acid chloride formation affects the purity of the product fenofibrate, since it is known to be contaminated with the traces of SO2 or its byproducts (gives foul smell). Hence both methods are not suitable for the production of high purity fenofibrate from industrial view point. Another serious problem associated with the above process is longer and incomplete reaction of p-carbonylphenol and bromo-isobutyric acid, which finally contaminates the product.<br>
Another process disclosed in US2004073058 patent describes the reaction of p-carbonylphenol with bromo-isobutyric acid isopropyl ester in presence of potassium bicarbonate in an alcohol solvent at a temperature ranging from room temperature to 100°C and claimed to have better yield &amp; industrial applicability as compared to the use of base potassium carbonate in US4058552. However it has been found that the process<br>
3<br><br>
still suffers from the above drawbacks like incomplete reaction and longer duration of reaction and no significant advantage is seen using the base potassium bicarbonate as compared to potassium carbonate.<br>
US4739101 patent provides yet another process alternative for Fenofibrate comprising p-carbofiylphenol witlrbromo-isobutyric acid isopropyl ester in presence of base potassium carbonate "under "solvent free conditions. This process may be workable at lab scale, however, is not suitable of industrial application, since both potassium carbonate and p-carbonylphenol are solid compounds and reaction mixture is too viscous to be able to mix properly on large scale. The process uses comparatively high temperature for reaction (&gt;140°C) and it has, been observed that even at the above temperature reaction is incomplete. This could be due to lack of effective mixing.<br>
According to the above-mentioned known processes, the yield of the compound of general Formula I is as low as about 50 to 69%, because there remains the unreacted phenol compound and requires repeated purification of Fenofibrate to remove the unreacted &amp; side products. Since the contaminative impurity is difficult to remove, production of a compound of Formula I having a high purity requires a complicated process of purification.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a phenoxyisobutyric acid ester derivative represented by the general Formula I at a low cost and by a simple procedure. It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a phenoxyisobutyric acid ester derivative represented by the Formula I without any complicated process of purification, in a high yield, and in a high purity.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide an industrially advantageous process for producing the fenofibrate, wherein the reaction can be completed to an extent of less than 1% of starting phenol derivative at a faster pace and the time cycle is reduced.<br>
4<br><br>
Summary of the invention<br>
In view of the above-mentioned present situation, the present inventors have conducted various studies with the aim of achieving the above-mentioned objects. As a result, it has been found in the process of the studies surprisingly that, when a phase-transfer catalyst is used as a catalyst, a compound of Formula I, by a reaction between the phenol of Formula II and the haloisobutyric acid isopropyl ester of Formula III is formed in higher yield and purity in shorter period of time. The reaction is fast and substantially complete conversion of phenol intermediate is achieved, and thereby the objects of the present invention can be met. Based on this finding, the present invention has been accomplished. As used herein, 'halo' phrase in haloisobutyric acid isopropyl ester refers to halogen which are selected from chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
In a second aspect of the present invention an improved process for esterification of bromo-isobutyric acid is provided, in which the acid is treated with molar amounts of isopropropanol in a solvent medium selected from hydrocarbon solvent and in presence of an acid catalyst like Para toluene sulphonic acid and removing the water formed during the reaction by distillation. The dehydration and anhydride impurity formation are<br>
minimized by the practice of the modification proposed in the present invention. Therefore a quantitative yield and purity of the required isopropyl ester intermediate can be achieved by following the process of present invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
According to the present invention, the objective phenoxyisobutyric acid ester derivative<br>
represented by the Formula I can be obtained in a high yield and a high purity by reacting<br>
