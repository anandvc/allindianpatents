				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel pharmaceutical formulation of tablets, which contain at least one high molecular weight polymeric agent which rapidly disintegrate in contact with water to form a smooth, homogenous, viscous and bioadhesive dispersion.<br>
TECHNICAL PROBLEM<br>
The main concern of the present invention is to incorporate two exactly bpposite properties viz. rapid disintegration and bioadhesion together in a tablet. Bioadhesive properties can be incorporated in tablets by using bioadhesive polymers, which are usually high molecular weight matrix forming polymers'that swell in contact with water. Because of the swelling behavior, high molecular weight polymers tend to absorb water and form a gel on the surface of tablet. This gel layer prevents penetration of fluid into the core of tablet thereby preventing further disintegration of tablets. In addition, viscosity of the surrounding disintegrating fluid increases as a result of dissolution of the high molecular weight polymer. Formation of gel layer and increase in viscosity of surrounding fluid slow down further penetration of fluids into tablets, hence prevent the disintegration of tablets.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Rapidly disintegrating tablets are either dispersible or effervescent in nature. Most of the dispersible tablets are prepared by conventional methods of dry and wet granulation and contain one or more intragranular and/or extragranular disintegrating agents. Methods for preparation of water dispersible tablets containing one or more disintegrating agents are well known in prior art (US patents 5047247, 5629016, 4774083, 5948422, and 5955107).<br>
Effervescent tablets contain a carbonate source and a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. The effervescent compositions when come in contact with water, an effervescent reaction takes place between the carbonate and acid resulting in evolution<br>
of carbon dioxide, which aids in rapid disintegration of tablet. Effervescent tablets are prepared by standard techniques of dry or wet granulation (with non aqueous granulating fluids). These methods for preparation of effervescent tablets are well known in prior art (US patents 5211957, 5178878, and 6274172).<br>
US patent 4886669 discloses a galenical formulation of a water dispersible tablet consisting of (a) microparticles which contain at least one pharmaceutically active substance, (b) a disintegrant, and (c) swellable material which is able to generate high viscosity on coming in contact with water. The tablets disclosed in this invention disintegrate rapidly in contact with water and form a homogenous suspension of high viscosity that can be easily swallowed. These tablets consist of (a) coated or uncoated microparticles containing drug, prepared by extrusion and spheronization, (b) granules of guar gum, the swelling agent, (c) dry granules containing inactive excipients such as Avicel (microcrystalline cellulose), Polyplasdone (cross-linked poly vinyl pyrrolidine), (d) lubricant such as magnesium stearate, and (e) taste enhancing agents such as saccharine sodium. The present invention is different from that of US patent 4886669 in several ways.<br>
US patent 5055306 discloses a granular sustained release formulation of a pharmacologically active substance presented in the form of a water dispersible or effervescent tablet, which disintegrate rapidly into granules on coming in contact with water. The granules are prepared by coating the core particles, in order to provide sustained release of the drug. The present invention is different from that of US patent 5055306. The present invention does not involve any complicated procedures like coating.<br>
Another method of preparing rapidly disintegrating tablets is disclosed in US patent 5298261. The tablets described in this patent consist of a collapsed matrix network (consisting of a gum, a carbohydrate and the drug) that has been vacuum dried above the collapse temperature of the matrix. The method of preparation of vacuum dried tablets involve steps of (a) preparing a mixture of gum, carbohydrate and water, (b) forming the mixture into a tablet shape, (c) freezing below equilibrium freezing temperature of the mixture. The present invention is different from US patent 5298261 since it does not involve any complicated procedures like vacuum drying. The rapidly<br>
disintegrating bioadhesive tablets in the present invention are prepared by simple techniques such as dry and/or wet granulation.<br>
US patent 4832956 describes a process for preparation of disintegrating tablets. The process comprises of melting a filler material, dispersing an effective amount of at least one disintegrating agent in the solid melt, cooling the melt, comminuting the cooled melt into granules of pre-determined particle size, admixing an active agent with granules, and pressing said matrix into tablet form. The present invention is different from US patent 4832956 since it does not involve any complicated procedures like melting and the rapidly disintegrating tablets of the present invention are prepared by simple techniques such as dry and/or wet granulation. In addition, the tablets of present invention are bioadhesive in nature.<br>
In another invention, US patent 6248358 discloses bioadhesive progressive hydration tablets for buccal and/or vaginal administration and the method for preparing the same. The bioadhesive tablets consist of a water soluble polymer (e.g. Carbopol 974P), insoluble Polycarbophil (NoveonÂ®), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose as binder, lactose, corn starch, and magnesium stearate and are prepared by conventional methods of wet granulation. These tablets remain in vaginal cavity and deliver active agents for as much as 72 hours or more. The tablets hydrate progressively whereby the inner core of tablets remains intact. This kind of tablets that do not disintegrate and remain as a solid structure in vaginal cavity may cause inconvenience to the users. To avoid inconvenience to users vaginal tablets must disintegrate in vaginal cavity as soon as possible after administration. On the other hand, present invention discloses a process to prepare tablets that disintegrate rapidly and are bioadhesive at the same time, hence will prolong the retention of formulation at the site without causing any inconvenience to the users.<br>
US patent 4153678 describes using 2 parts of granules for preparation of effervescent tablets of levamisole for oral administration in animals. The two parts of granules were used to separate the effervescent producing salts, sodium bicarbonate and adipic acid. The present invention is different from US patent 4153678. The present invention describes a method of preparing rapidly disintegrating and bioadhesive tablets containing high  molecular weight matrix  forming  agents.  In  the  present<br>
invention, the one part of granules (Part A) contain a high molecular weight matrix forming agent and another part of granules (Part B) do not contain any high molecular weight matrix forming agent. In the present invention, 2 parts granulation approach is used to form pores for penetration of fluid that aids in disintegration of tablets and prevents rapid swelling of the matrix forming agent.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the the<br>
preparation of novel pharmaceutical formulation of tablets, which contain at least one high molecular weight polymeric agent which rapidly disintegrate in contact with water to form a smooth, homogenous, viscous and bioadhesive dispersion.<br>
Another object of the present invention wherein the above tablets, when in contact with water disintegrate into granules in less than 5 minutes, in a small volume of fluid at 37Â°C.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide tablets, which disintegrate rapidly to form a smooth, homogenous, viscous, and bioadhesive dispersion.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present provides a process for the preparation of novel pharmaceutical formulation of tablets, which contain at least one high molecular weight polymeric agent which rapidly disintegrate in contact with water to form a smooth, homogenous, viscous and bioadhesive dispersion.<br>
The present invention consists of only two types of granules - one with and other without a high molecular weight polymeric agent, and other excipients such as a disintegrant, glidant and/or lubricant. A drug may be added in either type of granules. The granules of present invention are simple to prepare and does not require any complicated and expensive processes such as extrusion, spheronization, and coating. The granules can be prepared by simple methods of dry granulation or wet granulation, well known in prior art. In addition, tablets of present invention possess two exactly opposite pharmaceutical properties i.e. rapid disintegration and bioadhesion. These<br>
tablets disintegrate rapidly in contact with water and form a smooth, homogenous, viscous and bioadhesive dispersion.<br>

Sodium polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) is a synthetic high molecular weight (500,000 to 800,000 Da), polydisperse (polydispersity index 4.5), linear polymer comprised of repeated sulfonated styrene units. PSS is water soluble and contrasts with clinically used form of polystyrene sulfonate (Unites States Pharmacopeia 2000, 24th Edition), which is a sulfonated copolymer of styrene/divinyl benzene and is insoluble in nature. PSS possesses antimicrobial activities against several sexually transmitted pathogens including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), bovine papilloma virus, Neisseria gonorrhoea, and Chlamydia trachomatis. In addition, PSS also possess sperm inhibiting and contraceptive properties (US Patent 6239182; Anderson RA, Feathergill K, Diao X, Cooper M, Kirkpatrick R, Spear P, Waller DP, Chany C, Doncel GF, Herold B, Zaneveld LJ.

Two types of granules were made one with (Part A granules) and other without high molecular weight polymeric agent (Part B granules). Clotrimazole was incorporated in Part A granules and Part A granules were prepared by dry granulation. Slugs were prepared by compression of the powder mix in a single station tablet machine and the slugs were broken into granules using a dry granulator attached to Kalweka multipurpose machine (Karnavati Engineering Ltd., India) For Part A granules, only the particles that passed through BSS sieve number 22 and retained on BSS sieve number 60 were used in tablets. Part B granules were prepared by wet granulation. The powder mix was granulated with an aqueous dispersion of L-HPC (5% w/w of total weight of part B granules). Wet mass was passed through BSS sieve 16 and granules were dried at 50Â°C for 8 hours and dried granules passed through BSS sieve 22. Composition of both types of granules is as follows:<br>

* Only granules (part A) of particle size that pass through mesh BSS 22 and retained on mesh BSS 60 were used in final tablets.<br>
These tablets are non-effervescent, rapidly disintegrating (disintegration time 
The  performance  of present  pharmaceutical  invention   was  evaluated  by conducting following tests: Hardness<br>
Hardness of the tablets was tested with Erweka Hardness Tester TBH 20 (Erweka, GmbH, Germany). Disintegration test<br>
Disintegration time and behavior of tablets were evaluated using an in vitro method developed in house (Garg S, Vermani K, Kohli G, Tambwekar K, Kandarapu R, Garg A, Waller DP, and Zaneveld LZD. 2002 Survey of vaginal formulations available in Indian market and evaluation of selected products, Int. J. Pharm. Med., 16, 141-152). A defined volume of disintegrating fluid (10 ml) was taken in a cylindrical container fitted with a screen (BSS mesh # 10), maintained at 37Â°C and stirred at fixed rpm (300) with the help of magnetic stirrer. Test tablets were placed above the screen and disintegration time recorded. A tablet was considered to disintegrate when it completely dissolved or separated into component parts or became soft such that the mass had no solid core offering resistance to pressure with a glass rod. Disintegration was studied using water as disintegrating fluid. Disintegration time and behavior were recorded. Disintegration of tablets was also studied by IP method in 800 ml of water at 37Â°C.<br>
Uniformity of dispersion (Indian Pharmacopoeia, 1996)<br>
Two tablets were placed in 100 ml water and stirred gently until completely dispersed. The dispersion was passed through a sieve screen with a nominal mesh aperture of 710 ixM (sieve number 22). The tablet passes the test if the dispersion passes through the mesh. Viscosity determination of the dispersion<br>
Viscosity of dispersion of 1 tablet in 10 ml of water was measured using a Brookfield RVDV III+ Programmable Rheometer (Brookfield Engineering, USA) with coaxial cylinders (measuring spindle - SC4-21, small sample adapter). Viscosity of 8 ml of the sample maintained at 37Â°C was measured by rotating the spindle at 250 rpm for 1 minute (Garg S, Vermani K, Kohli G, Tambwekar K, Kandarapu R, Garg A, Waller DP, and Zaneveld LZD. 2002 Survey of vaginal formulations available in Indian market and evaluation of selected products, Int. J. Pharm. Med., 16, 141-152). Bioadhesion<br>
The method to measure bioadhesion is based on the principle of measuring the force required to break the adhesive bond between a model membrane and test formulation. Isolated sheep vaginal mucosa was used as the model membrane (Institute animal ethics committee's permission was obtained for the use of isolated sheep vagina in the experiments). The test formulation is sandwiched between two model membranes fixed on flexible supports in the modified probes of Texture Analyzer for a sufficient period of time. After the adhesive bond has formed, the force required to separate the bond is measured as bioadhesive strength (Garg S, Vermani K, Kohli G, Tambwekar K, Kandarapu R, Garg A, Waller DP, and Zaneveld LZD. 2002 Survey of vaginal formulations available in Indian market and evaluation of selected products, Int. J. Pharm. Med., 16, 141-152).<br>
Bioadhesive strength of vaginal formulations was measured using a calibrated Texture Analyzer (Model TA-XT2i, Stable Micro Systems, UK) equipped with a 5 kg load cell and modified probes. Data was acquired at a rate of 50 points per second, using fully integrated data acquisition and analysis software (Texture Expert, Version 1.22, 1999). The probes of equipment were modified so as to hold and provide a flexible support to sheep vaginal mucosa. Sheep (Ovis aries, non descriptive local breed) vaginal tissue was obtained immediately after the sacrifice of animals at a slaughterhouse. Vaginal tissue was cleaned, separated from the supporting muscular<br>
and connective tissues taking care to maintain the integrity of mucosa. The isolated tissue was frozen at -20Â°C till further use. Before experiments, sheep vaginal tissue was thawed in normal saline containing 0.1% w/v Sodium azide as preservative. Vaginal tube was incised longitudinally and tied with a thread to the modified probes with mucosal side exposed.<br>
For measuring bioadhesive strength, 0.5 gm of the dispersion (1 tablet dispersed in 3 ml normal saline) was applied in between the sheep vaginal mucosa on an area of 464 mm . Membranes were kept in contact with the test sample for a period of 5 minutes under a constant force of 0.25 N in order to establish proper contact between membrane and sample to allow the formation of adhesive bond. Force required to separate the two membranes (with dispersion in between) was measured by upper support of Texture Analyzer moving at a rate of 0.1 mm/sec. Maximum force required to break the adhesive bond was measured as bioadhesive strength and area under curve measured as work of adhesion. All the formulations were evaluated using isolated sheep vaginal mucosa (n = 5) and mean bioadhesive strength and work of adhesion were determined.<br>
Bioadhesive properties of tablets were compared with that of other vaginal formulations including Replens (Columbia Laboratories, Aventura, FL, claimed to have bioadhesive properties), KY JellyÂ® (Advanced Care Products, Raritan, NJ; a frequently used marketed vaginal lubricant), Acidform gel (an investigational acid buffering bioadhesive vaginal gel formulation being developed at TOPCAD, Rush Presbyterian St Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, USA, presently in clinical trials), CS gel (6% w/w gel, presently in clinical trails, being developed by TOPCAD, Chicago, USA) and PSS gel (10% w/w gel of PSS, presently in clinical trials, being developed by TOPCAD, Chicago, USA).<br>
NOVELTY: In the present invention, the formulation in the form of a tablet containing high molecular weight agent having bioadhesive and dispersible properties together has been achieved for the first time.<br>
