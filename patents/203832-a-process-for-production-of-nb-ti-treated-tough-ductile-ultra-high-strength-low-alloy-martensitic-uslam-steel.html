				<td>Introduction to the Field of the Invention<br>
This Invention relates to a process for production of Nb-Ti treated tough &amp; ductile Ultra-High Strength tow Alloy Martensitic (USLAM) steels.<br>
Necessity of the invention<br>
It is already known to prepare the above mentioned USLAM steels by defined technique in use. These USLAM steels are prepared because Ultra Strength Low Alloy Martensitic (USLAM) steels find wide application in several fields including, aviation/automobile and other engineering sectors as shafts, rotors, sheets, etc. due to their extremely high strength/density ratio in the quenched &amp; tempered condition coupled with cost-effectiveness.<br>
Prior Art and Draw backs<br>
However, these steels generally suffer from toughness &amp; ductility related deficiencies i.e. low toughness &amp; temper-embrittlement and poor ductility. The low tensile ductility &amp; impact toughness at ambient are clearly revealed from the Table 1, which depicts the chemistry &amp; properties of some existing USLAM steels. Moreover, these steels are highly susceptible to temper-embrittlement phenomena. Table 1, shows low impact toughness of some of these alloys when subjected to tempering/aging at around 500° C either the steels have poor toughness as the source of strength is primarily from medium carbon content i.e. 0.23%-0.5%, as shown for grades AISI 4340 (Si-modified), D-6a/D-6ac, Hy-TUF, AISi-4130, AISM140, AISI-4340 (Table-1) or they become expensive due to<br>
i,	Addition of costly alloying elements Ni &amp; Mo in substantial amount.<br>
ii.	Additional processing cost towards refining in order to make the steels ultra Clean.<br>
Both these above mentioned steps are restored to for achieving a higher toughness e.g. BP-25 (Table-1).<br>
The following may be noted from the Table-1.<br>
*AII existing USLAM steels with strength&gt;1500 MPa &amp; CVN&gt;50 J contain high amount of Ni &amp; Mo.<br>
2<br><br>
Steels containing lower Ni &amp; Mo content exhibit poor CVN vafues-sometimes nothing is specified.<br>
This reveals that combination of low Ni &amp; Mo could not impart adequate impact toughness to USLAM steels.<br>
AISI-4130 &amp; AISI-4140 are economical &amp; strong but brittle, making it unsuitable for many critical &amp; strategic applications.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
It is therefore a principal object of the Invention to propose improved USLAM steels and a method for the preparation of USLAM steels, which will have high toughness and good ductility. It is another object to propose such an improved process, which will enable the preparation of an improved USLAM steels, which will have carbon, nickel and molybdenum in smaller amounts than possible so far and yet have satisfactory properties.<br>
It is yet another object to propose such a method, which will enable use of Mn, Si &amp; Cr for optimum utilization.<br>
It is a further object to propose such a method, which will enable use of micro-alloying elements selected from V, Nb, Ti &amp; Al to achieve required properties.<br>
These and other objects of the Invention will be more clearfy understood from the following paragraphs.<br>
3<br><br>
Summary Of The Invention:<br>
Thus according to the basic aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for production of Nb -Ti treated tough &amp; ductile Ultra-High Strength Low Alloy Martensitic (USLAM) steel comprising the following steps:<br>
a.	melting selective EDD/Extra low Sulphur &amp; Phosphorus scrap such as<br>
to achieve a selective composition comprising of :<br>
C = 0.18 to 0.22 %;Mn.= 1.00 to 1.30 %;Si.  = 0.90 to 1.10<br>
%;Cr. = 1.10 to 1.70 %;Ni. = 0.65 to 0.75 %;Mo. =0.25 to,0.35<br>
%;V = 0.06 to 0.12 %;AI. = 0.04 to 0.09 %;S = upto0.015 %; <br>
P = upto 0.020 ; Nb. = upto 0.06 % and Ti = upto 0.02 % and<br>
balance  Fe.  after final addition of alloying  &amp; micro-alloying <br>
elements.	<br>
b.	subjecting the melt to complete de-oxidation using one or more of de-<br>
oxidisers selected from Fe-Si, Fe-Mn and At;	<br>
c.	effecting necessary final addition of any alloying elements in any<br>
conventional  manner  ,  preferably  by  ladle/VAD  treatment for<br>
effective alloying of the elements such as to maintain the final alloy<br>
having said desired composition;<br>
d.	subjecting the final alloy thus obtained to ingot casting by bottom-<br>
pouring technique;<br>
e.	subjecting the ingot to selective thermo-mechanically controlled<br>
processing comprising finish rolling temperature in the range of 760°<br>
to 950° along with &gt; 15% deformation; followed by,<br>
f) carrying out heat treatment operations with controlled parameters like temperature and holding/soaking period selectively involving Normalizing, Hardening, Low temperature Tempering ,High Temperature Tempering and Aging.<br>
Following the above process of the invention it is thus possible to provide the alloy having selective combination of the following elements :-<br>
i)	C, Mn. Cr, Ni &amp; Mo in small amounts; and<br>
ii)       V, Nb, Ti &amp; Al as micro-alloying elements.<br>
Importantly, the above method of the invention and in particular the process involving the stated Thermo-Mechanical Controlled Processing in the selective finish rolling temperature in the range of 760°-950° C alongwith the selective &gt; 15 % deformation enable achieving Yield Strength (YS) in the range of 1010 - 1360 Mpa and Tensile Strength (UTS) in the range of 1410-1535 Mpa, Impact Strength (J) of 49/0-145.0 J at 200C and an elongation of 11.0-17.0 %.<br>
-4-<br><br>
It is found that by way of the above selective Thermo-Mechanically Controlled processing,it is possible to achieve higher Yield Strength (YS) and Tensile Strength (UTS) much more than that could be achieved by the proposed forging at a temperature of 1800.degree. to 2300.degree. F. and directly quenching said forging in the prior US'492 which could achieve an Yield strength of only about 620.6- 1137.7 Mpa and Tensile Strength (UTS) of about 827.4 - 1447.95.<br>
The above clearly and sufficiently establishes the advantages in the selective Thermo-mechanically Controlled processing including the finish rolling temperature in the range of 760°- 950° C along with the &gt; 15 % deformation followed by the present process.<br>
It is thus possible following the above method to impart the Selective following combination of properties in the Ultra High Strength Low-Alloy Martensitic (USLAM) steel of the invention:<br>
i.      Y.S. in the range of 750 Mpa to 1350 Mpa or more;<br>
ii.       UTS in the range of 840 Mpa to 1540 Mpa or more ;<br>
iii.        Impact toughness (CVN) at room temperature in the range of 48J to 145J or more;<br>
iv.       Increase in impact toughness at room temperature to the tune<br>
of 10J (20%) compared to the existing /conventional alloys in      <br>
case of Low Temperature Tempering (LTT);	<br>
v. Remarkable enhancement (more than two-fold) in the imact toughness at R.T. after High Temperature Tempering (HTT) to the tune of 100J (220%) with a corresponding loss of 700 Mpa (82%) in UTS;<br>
vi. An almost fully ductile mode of fracture with fine &amp; deep dimple network coupled with small micro-voids, the plausible sites for initiation of fracture;<br>
vii.     Control of segregation/co-segregation of P,Mn,Cr,Ni etc.<br>
viii. Lesser susceptibility to both Temper Matensite Embrittlement and Tempered Embrittlement compared to similar steels.<br>
-5-<br><br>

i. The heat treatment product is then finally shaped by grinding, precision machining final bending etc.<br>
c)	Economics:<br>
This steel will be cheaper compared to similar existing grades due to<br>
•	lower Ni &amp; Mo contents<br>
•	Lower hot-working temperature<br>
•	Lower heat-treatment temperature.<br>
However, actual quantum of benefit in terms of processing cost will depend on many factors, some are as enumerated below: -<br>
a.	Which particular USLAM or any other steel will be replaced by this steel?<br>
b.	What are the absolute costs of ingredients like Ni, Mo, Si, Cr, Mn vis-a-vis their ferro-alloys at<br>
the plant of production.<br>
c.	Yield/recovery of the above mentioned alloying elements with respect to the sources of<br>
addition.<br>
11<br><br>
d.	The facilities available at the production unit or the process route followed compared to<br>
existing similar commercial grades of USLAM steel e.g. secondary refining, heat treatment<br>
furnace type &amp; size etc. The benefit will depend upon whether secondary refining techniques<br>
like VAD, ladle degassing etc. is resorted to or by-passed. Benefit at the heat treatment<br>
operations will depends on the type of furnace, their sizes &amp; capabilities.<br>
e.	The desired final properties (application specific) which will ultimately decide all the<br>
processing parameters.<br>
Hence any quantification of the benefit at this stage is difficult.<br>
d)	Impact in Industry :<br>
•	USLAM steels can be made with above mentioned properties for application in the<br>
following areas as cheaper substitute,<br>
-Aviation industry for aircraft under carriages<br>
-Pressure vessels<br>
-Engineering components like high-strength bolts/fasteners,<br>
-Springs, high-speed rotors/shafts e:tc.<br>
•	The steels can be processed/hot worked to desired shapes with out any difficulty.<br>
