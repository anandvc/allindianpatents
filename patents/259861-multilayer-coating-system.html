MULTILAYER COATING SYSTEM<br>
The invention relates to a multilayer coating system comprising at least one<br>
layer a) comprising a coating composition a) comprising at least one<br>
isocyanate-functional compound and at least one thiol-functional compound,<br>
and at least one layer b) comprising an aqueous coating composition b),<br>
wherein at least one layer a) and at least one layer b) have at least one<br>
common layer boundary. The invention also relates to a process of preparing<br>
the multilayer coating system, and to a kit of parts for preparation of a base coat<br>
composition.<br>
United States patent US 5578346 describes multilayer composite coatings<br>
which comprise (a) a first coat which is substantially free of isocyanate<br>
functionality and which comprises a film-forming composition capable of curing<br>
or drying and a catalyst for the reaction of isocyanate groups and active<br>
hydrogen groups, and (b) a second coat which is applied to the surface of the<br>
first coat and which comprises an active hydrogen compound and a<br>
polyisocyanate. Examples wherein the first coat comprises dibutyl tin dilaurate<br>
and the second coat is based on a polyol and a polyisocyanate are described.<br>
International patent application WO 0192362 describes a photoactivatable<br>
coating composition comprising a photolatent base and a base-catalyzed<br>
polymerizable or curable organic material comprising at least one<br>
polyisocyanate and at least one compound containing at least one thiol group.<br>
The photoactivatable coating composition can be a clear coat composition<br>
which is to be applied on top of a base coat composition. The photoactivatable<br>
coating composition has a long pot life and exhibits fast curing upon irradiation<br>
with ultraviolet and visible light. The known photoactivatable coating<br>
composition eventually also cures in shadow areas, i.e. those areas of a coated<br>
substrate which are not exposed to ultraviolet or visible light.<br><br>
A drawback of the known multilayer coating systems is that the curing speed of<br>
the top coats of the known systems is not always as fast as desirable. Fast<br>
curing of the photoactivatable coating composition according to WO 0192362 is<br>
only achieved upon irradiation with visible and/or ultraviolet light, while the<br>
curing speed in shadow areas is rather slow and subject to further improvement.<br>
The current invention seeks to alleviate the above-mentioned drawback of the<br>
known multilayer coating systems. More in particular, the coating composition<br>
comprising at least one isocyanate-functional compound and at least one thiol-<br>
functional compound should be rapidly curable also in shadow areas or even<br>
without any irradiation with visible and/or ultraviolet light. Rapid curability should<br>
not be achieved at the expense of the pot life of the composition. Furthermore, if<br>
the coating composition comprising at least one isocyanate-functional<br>
compound and at least one thiol-functional compound is a clear coat<br>
composition, it is desirable that application of the clear coat should lead to only<br>
minimal or even no strike-in effect in an underlying base coat layer.<br>
It has now been found that these objectives can be achieved with a multilayer<br>
coating system comprising<br>
-	at least one layer a) comprising a coating composition a) comprising at<br>
least one isocyanate-functional compound and at least one thiol-functional<br>
compound, and<br>
-	at least one layer b) comprising an aqueous coating composition b),<br>
wherein at least one layer a) and at least one layer b) have at least one<br>
common layer boundary, and wherein coating composition b) comprises at least<br>
17 mmol/kg, calculated on the weight of coating composition b), of a catalyst for<br>
the addition reaction of the at least one thiol-functional compound and the at<br>
least one isocyanate-functional compound.<br><br>
In the multilayer coating system according to the invention coating composition<br>
a) comprising at least one isocyanate-functional compound and at least one<br>
thiol-functional compound cures rapidly also in shadow areas or even without<br>
any irradiation with visible and/or ultraviolet light. Since no additional<br>
components, such as a catalyst, need to be added to coating composition a),<br>
the pot life of coating composition a) is not decreased. Thus, rapid curability is<br>
not achieved at the expense of the pot life of the composition.<br>
Furthermore, application of a clear coat composition of coating composition a)<br>
leads to minimal or even no strike-in effect in an underlying base coat layer<br>
produced from an aqueous base coat composition b).<br>
The invention also relates to a method of increasing the cure speed in a multi-<br>
layer coating system. The method comprises applying a clear coat composition<br>
a) comprising at least one isocyanate-functional compound and at least one<br>
thiol-functional compound on top of a base coat layer b) prepared from an<br>
aqueous base coat composition b) comprising at least 17 mmol/kg, calculated<br>
on the weight of coating composition b), of a catalyst for the addition reaction of<br>
the at least one thiol-functional compound and the at least one isocyanate-<br>
functional compound.<br>
Suitable isocyanate-functional compounds for use in coating composition a) are<br>
isocyanate-functional compounds comprising at least one isocyanate group.<br>
Alternatively, the isocyanate-functional compound in coating composition a) is a<br>
polyisocyanate, such as an aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic di-, tri- or tetra-<br>
isocyanate. Examples of diisocyanates include 1,2-propylene diisocyanate,<br>
trimethylene diisocyanate, tetramethylene diisocyanate, 2,3-butylene<br>
diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, octamethylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4-<br>
trimethyl hexamethylene diisocyanate, dodecamethylene diisocyanate, ω,ω'-<br>
dipropylether diisocyanate, 1,3-cyclopentane diisocyanate, 1,2-cyclohexane<br>
diisocyanate, 1,4-cyclohexane diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate, 4-methyl-<br><br>
1,3-diisocyanatocyclohexane, trans-vinylidene diisocyanate, dicyclohexyl<br>
methane-4,4'-diisocyanate (Desmodur® W), toluene diisocyanate, 1,3-<br>
bis(isocyanatomethyl) benzene, xylylene diisocyanate, α,α,α',α'-tetramethyl<br>
xylylene diisocyanate (TMXDI®), 1,5-dimethyl-2,4-bis(2-isocyanatoethyl)<br>
benzene, 1,3,5-triethyl-2,4-bis(isocyanatomethyl) benzene, 4,4'-diisocyanato-<br>
diphenyl,	3,3'-dichloro-4,4'-diisocyanato-diphenyl,	3,3'-diphenyl-4,4'-<br>
diisocyanato-diphenyl, 3,3'-dimethoxy-4,4'-diisocyanato-diphenyl, 4,4'-<br>
diisocyanato-diphenyl methane, 3,3'-dimethyl-4,4'-diisocyanato-diphenyl-<br>
methane, and diisocyanatonaphthalene. Examples of triisocyanates include<br>
1,3,5-triisocyanatobenzene, 2,4,6-triisocyanatotoluene, 1,8-diisocyanato-4-<br>
(isocyanatomethyl) octane, and lysine triisocyanate. Adducts and oligomers of<br>
polyisocyanates, for instance biurets, isocyanurates, allophanates, uretdiones,<br>
urethanes, and mixtures thereof are also included. Examples of such oligomers<br>
and adducts are the adduct of 2 molecules of a diisocyanate, for example<br>
hexamethylene diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate, to a diol such as<br>
ethylene glycol, the adduct of 3 molecules of hexamethylene diisocyanate to 1<br>
molecule of water (available under the trademark Desmodur N of Bayer), the<br>
adduct of 1 molecule of trimethylol propane to 3 molecules of toluene<br>
diisocyanate (available under the trademark Desmodur L of Bayer), the adduct<br>
of 1 molecule of trimethylol propane to 3 molecules of isophorone diisocyanate,<br>
the adduct of 1 molecule of pentaerythritol to 4 molecules of toluene<br>
diisocyanate, the adduct of 3 moles of m-α,α,α',α'-tetramethyl xylene<br>
diisocyanate to 1 mole of trimethylol propane, the isocyanurate trimer of 1,6-<br>
diisocyanatohexane, the isocyanurate trimer of isophorone diisocyanate, the<br>
uretdion dimer of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, the biuret of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane,<br>
the allophanate of 1,6-diisocyanatohexane, and mixtures thereof. Furthermore,<br>
(co)polymers of isocyanate-functional monomers such as a,a'-dimethyl-m-<br>
isopropenyl benzyl isocyanate are suitable for use.<br><br>
The polyisocyanate can comprise hydrophilic groups, for example covalently<br>
bonded hydrophilic polyether moieties, which facilitate the formation of aqueous<br>
dispersions.<br>
Thiol-functional compounds that can suitably be used in coating composition a)<br>
include dodecyl mercaptan, mercapto ethanol, 1,3-propanedithiol, 1,6-<br>
hexanedithiol, methylthioglycolate, 2-mercaptoacetic acid, mercaptosuccinic<br>
acid, and cysteine.<br>
Also suitable are esters of a thiol-functional carboxylic acid with a polyol, such<br>
as esters of 2-mercaptoacetic acid, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, 2-mercapto-<br>
propionic acid, 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid, and mercaptosuccinic acid.<br>
Examples of such esters include pentaerythritol tetrakis (3-mercaptopropionate),<br>
pentaerythritol tetrakis (2-mercaptoacetate), trimethylol propane tris (3-<br>
mercaptopropionate), trimethylol propane tris (2-mercaptopropionate), and<br>
trimethylol propane tris (2-mercaptoacetate). A further example of such a<br>
compound consists of a hyperbranched polyol core based on a starter polyol,<br>
e.g. trimethylol propane and dimethylol propionic acid, which is subsequently<br>
esterified with 3-mercaptopropionic acid and isononanoic acid. These<br>
compounds are described in European patent application EP 0448224 A and<br>
International patent application WO 9317060.<br>
Addition products of H2S to epoxy-functional compounds also give thiol-<br>
functional compounds. These compounds may have a structure of the following<br>
formula T[(0-CHR-CH2-O)nCH2CHXHCH2YH]m, with T being a m valent organic<br>
moiety wherein m is an integer between 1 and 25, R being hydrogen or methyl,<br>
n being an integer between 0 and 30, X and Y being oxygen or sulfur, with the<br>
proviso that X and Y are not equal. An example of such a compound is<br>
commercially available from Cognis under the trademark Capcure® 3/800.<br>
Other syntheses to prepare compounds comprising thiol-functional groups<br>
involve: the reaction of an aryl or alkyl halide with NaHS to introduce a pendant<br>
mercapto group into the alkyl and aryl compounds, respectively; the reaction of<br><br>
a Grignard reagent with sulfur to introduce a pendant mercapto group into the<br>
structure; the reaction of a polymercaptan with a polyolefin according to a<br>
nucleophilic reaction, an electrophilic reaction or a radical reaction; the reaction<br>
of disulfides.<br>
Good results have so far been obtained with pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercapto<br>
propionate), trimethylolpropane tris(3-mercaptopropionate), and Capcure 3/800<br>
as thiol-functional compounds.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the thiol group of the thiol-functional<br>
compound in coating composition a) can be covalently attached to a resin. Such<br>
resins include thiol-functional polyurethane resins, thiol-functional polyester<br>
resins, thiol-functional polyaddition polymer resins, thiol-functional polyether<br>
resins, thiol-functional polyamide resins, thiol-functional polyurea resins, and<br>
mixtures thereof. Thiol-functional resins can be prepared by the reaction of H2S<br>
with an epoxy group or an unsaturated carbon-carbon bond-containing resin,<br>
the reaction between a hydroxyl-functional resin and a thiol-functional acid, and<br>
by the reaction of an isocyanate-functional polymer and either a thiol-functional<br>
alcohol or a di- or polymercapto compound.<br>
A thiol-functional polyurethane resin can be the reaction product of a mono-, di-,<br>
tri- or tetrafunctional thiol compound with an isocyanate-terminated<br>
polyurethane and preferably is the reaction product of a diisocyanate compound<br>
and (a) diol-functional compound(s). Suitable thiol-functional polyurethane<br>
resins are obtainable by first preparing an isocyanate-functional polyurethane<br>
from diols, diisocyanates, and optionally building blocks containing groups<br>
which facilitate the stabilization of the resin in an aqueous dispersion, followed<br>
by reaction of the isocyanate-functional polyurethane with a polyfunctional thiol<br>
in a base-catalyzed addition reaction. Other thiol-functional polyurethane resins<br>
are known and described, e.g., in German patent publication DE 2642071 A and<br>
European patent application EP 0794204 A.<br>
The thiol-functional resin can be a polyester prepared from (a) at least one<br>
polycarboxylic acid or reactive derivatives thereof, (b) at least one polyol, and<br><br>
(c) at least one thiol-functional carboxylic acid. The polyesters preferably<br>
possess a branched structure. Branched polyesters are conventionally obtained<br>
through condensation of polycarboxylic acids or reactive derivatives thereof,<br>
such as the corresponding anhydrides or lower alkyl esters, with polyalcohols,<br>
when at least one of the reactants has a functionality of at least 3.<br>
Examples of suitable polycarboxylic acids or reactive derivatives thereof are<br>
tetrahydrophthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic anhydride, hexahydrophthalic acid,<br>
hexahydrophthalic anhydride, methyl hexahydrophthalic acid, methyl hexahy-<br>
drophthalic anhydride, dimethylcyclohexane dicarboxylate, 1,4-cyclohexane<br>
dicarboxylic acid, 1,3-cyclohexane dicarboxylic acid, phthalic acid, phthalic<br>
anhydride, isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, 5-tert. butyl isophthalic acid,<br>
trimellitic anhydride, maleic acid, maleic anhydride, fumaric acid, succinic acid,<br>
succinic anhydride, dodecenyl succinic anhydride, dimethyl succinate, glutaric<br>
acid, adipic acid, dimethyl adipate, azelaic acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable polyols include trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane,<br>
glycerol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-propylene<br>
glycol, 2-methylpropane-1,3-diol, neopentyl glycol, 2-butyl-2-ethyl-1,3-propane<br>
diol, cyclohexane-1,4-dimethylol, the monoester of neopentyl glycol and<br>
hydroxypivalic acid, hydrogenated Bisphenol A, 1,5-pentane diol, 3-methyl-<br>
pentane diol, 1,6-hexane diol, 2,2,4-trimethyl pentane-1,3-diol, dimethylol<br>
propionic acid, pentaerythritol, di-trimethylol propane, dipentaerythritol, and<br>
mixtures thereof.<br>
Examples of suitable thiol-functional organic acids include 3-mercaptopropionic<br>
acid, 2-mercaptopropionic acid, thio-salicylic acid, mercaptosuccinic acid,<br>
mercaptoacetic acid, cysteine, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Optionally, monocarboxylic acids and monoalcohols may be used in the<br>
preparation of the polyesters. Preferably, C4-C18 monocarboxylic acids and C6-<br>
Cia monoalcohols are used. Examples of the C4-C18 monocarboxylic acids<br>
include pivalic acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid, nonanoic acid,<br>
2-ethylhexanoic acid, isononanoic acid, decanoic acid, lauric acid, myristic acid,<br><br>
palmitic acid, isostearic acid, stearic acid, hydroxystearic acid, benzoic acid, 4-<br>
tert. butyl benzoic acid, and mixtures thereof. Examples of the C6-C18<br>
monoalcohols include cyclohexanol, 2-ethylhexanol, stearyl alcohol, and 4-tert.<br>
butyl cyclohexanol.<br>
In addition to thiol groups, the thiol-functional polyester prepared from the above<br>
components may also comprise hydroxyl groups. If hydroxyl groups are present,<br>
the ratio of thiol groups to hydroxyl groups suitably is in the range of 90:10 to<br>
10:90, preferably 75:25 to 25:75.<br>
The thiol-functional resin can be a thiol-functional polyaddition polymer, for<br>
example a poly(meth)acrylate. Such a poly(meth)acrylate is derived from<br>
hydroxyl-functional (meth)acrylic monomers, such as hydroxyethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, hydroxypropyl (meth)acrylate, hydroxybutyl (meth)acrylate, and<br>
other ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable monomers as described above for<br>
the polyaddition polymer preparation. The thiol group is introduced by<br>
esterification of (part of) the hydroxyl groups of the acrylate copolymer with one<br>
or more of the thiol-functional carboxylic acids described above.<br>
Alternatively, glycidyl methacrylate is introduced into the polymer to prepare an<br>
epoxy-functional poly(meth)acrylate. The epoxy groups are then reacted with<br>
suitable thiol-functional carboxylic acids such as mentioned above. Alternatively,<br>
the thiol group can be introduced by reacting an isocyanate-functional<br>
polyacrylate with a thiol-functional alcohol, e.g., mercapto ethanol. The<br>
polyaddition polymer is prepared by conventional methods as described above,<br>
for instance by the slow addition of appropriate monomers to a solution of an<br>
appropriate polymerization initiator, such as an azo or peroxy initiator.<br>
Coating composition a) in the multilayer system according to the present<br>
invention may be a water borne composition, a solvent borne composition or a<br>
solvent-free composition. Since the composition may be composed of liquid<br>
oligomers, it is especially suitable for use as a high-solids composition or a<br><br>
solvent-free composition. Suitably, the theoretical volatile organic content (VOC)<br>
in coating composition a) is less than 450 g/l, or less than 350 g/l, or even less<br>
than 250 g/l. Alternatively, coating composition a) may be an aqueous powder<br>
coating dispersion wherein the thiol-functional compound is a resin having a Tg<br>
above 20°C. The coating composition may also be a powder coating<br>
composition or a hot melt coating composition.<br>
In one embodiment coating composition a) comprises a combination of<br>
pentaerythritol tetrakis(3-mercapto propionate) and a thiol-functional polyester.<br>
It is preferred that the thiol-functional polyester additionally comprises hydroxyl<br>
groups.<br>
As mentioned above, in the multilayer system according to the invention coating<br>
composition a) cures rapidly even without any irradiation with visible and/or<br>
ultraviolet light. Nevertheless, it may be desirable to further increase the curing<br>
speed by irradiation with visible and/or ultraviolet light. Accordingly, in one<br>
embodiment of the invention coating composition a) comprises a photolatent<br>
base. Suitable photolatent bases include N-substituted 4-(o-nitrophenyl)<br>
dihydropyridines, optionally substituted with alkyl ether and/or alkyl ester<br>
groups, and quaternary organo-boron photoinitiators. Examples of N-substituted<br>
4-(o-nitrophenyl) dihydropyridines are N-methyl nifedipine, N-butyl nifedipine, N-<br>
butyl 2,6-dimethyl 4-(2-nitrophenyl) 1,4-dihydropyridine 3,5-dicarboxylic acid<br>
diethyl ester, and a nifedipine according to the following formula<br><br><br>
i.e., N-methyl 2,6-dimethyl 4-(4,5~dimethoxy-2-nitrophenyl) 1,4-dihydropyridine<br>
3,5-dicarboxylic acid diethyl ester. Examples of quaternary organo-boron<br>
photoinitiators are disclosed in GB 2307473 A, such as<br><br>
Thus far optimum results have been obtained with a photolatent base belonging<br>
to the group of a-amino acetophenones. Examples of a-amino acetophenones<br>
which can be used in the photoactivatable coating compositions according to<br>
the present invention are: 4-(methylthiobenzoyl)-1-methyl-1-morpholinoethane<br>
(Irgacure® 907 ex Ciba Specialty Chemicals) and (4-morpholinobenzoyl)-1-<br>
benzyl-1-dimethylamino propane (Irgacure® 369 ex Ciba Specialty Chemicals)<br>
disclosed in EP 0898202 A. Preferred is an a-amino acetophenone according to<br>
the following formula<br><br>
The photolatent base may be used in an amount of between 0.01 and 10 wt.%<br>
on solid curable material of coating composition a), preferably 0.05 to 5 wt.%,<br>
more preferably 0.05 to 3 wt.%.<br>
If coating composition a) comprises a photolatent base, it is radiation curable<br>
after application and, optionally, evaporation of solvents. Curing by irradiation<br>
with UV light is particularly suitable. Combinations of IR/UV irradiation are also<br>
suitable. Radiation sources which may be used are those customary for UV,<br>
such as high- and medium-pressure mercury lamps. In order to avoid any risk<br><br>
involved in handling UV light of very short wavelength (UV B and/or UV C light),<br>
preference is given, especially for use in automotive refinishing shops, to<br>
fluorescent lamps which produce the less injurious UV A light. Alternatively, it is<br>
also possible to use UV lamps equipped with a filter which does not allow the<br>
transmission of UV B and UV C radiation.<br>
When a photolatent base is used in coating composition a), a sensitizer may<br>
optionally be included in coating composition a).<br>
Suitable sensitizers are thioxanthones such as isopropyl thioxanthone according<br>
to the following formula<br><br>
(Quantacure® ITX ex G. Lakes), oxazines, and rhodamines. Colourless surfaces<br>
can be obtained with benzophenone and derivatives thereof. Examples of<br>
suitable derivatives of benzophenone are:<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 may be the same or different and stand for CH3 or H<br>
(Speedcure® BEM ex Lambson),<br><br><br>
wherein R1, R2, and R3 may be the same or different and stand for CH3 or H<br>
(Esacure® TZTex Lamberti).<br>
The sensitizer may be present in amount of 0.1 to 5 wt % on solid curable<br>
material in coating composition a), preferably 0.5 to 2.5 wt.%.<br>
In addition to the isocyanate-functional compound and the thiol-functional<br>
compound as described above, other compounds can be present in coating<br>
composition a). Such compounds may be main binders and/or reactive diluents,<br>
optionally comprising reactive groups which may be crosslinked with the<br>
aforesaid functional compounds. Examples include hydroxyl-functional binders,<br>
e.g., polyester polyols, polyether polyols, polyacrylate polyols, polyurethane<br>
polyols, cellulose acetobutyrate, hydroxyl-functional epoxy resins, alkyds, and<br>
dendrimeric polyols such as described in International patent application WO<br>
9317060. Also, hydroxyl-functional oligomers and monomers, such as castor oil<br>
and trimethylol propane, may be present.<br><br>
Coating composition a) can also comprise latent hydroxyl-functional compounds<br>
such as compounds comprising bicyclic orthoester or spiro-orthoester groups.<br>
These compounds and their use are described in WO 9731073.<br>
Finally, ketone resins, asparagyl acid esters, and latent or non-latent amino-<br>
functional compounds such as oxazolidines, ketimines, aldimines, diimines,<br>
secondary amines, and polyamines can be present. These and other<br>
compounds are known to the skilled person and are mentioned, int. al., in US<br>
5214086.<br>
The ratio of isocyanate-functional to thiol-functional groups in coating<br>
composition a) suitably is between 0.5:1 and 3:1, preferably 0.8:1 to 2:1.<br>
Coating composition a) may further comprise other ingredients, additives or<br>
auxiliaries commonly used in coating compositions, such as pigments, dyes,<br>
emulsifiers (surfactants), pigment dispersion aids, levelling agents, wetting<br>
agents, anti-cratering agents, antifoaming agents, antisagging agents, heat<br>
stabilizers, light stabilizers, UV absorbers, antioxidants, and fillers.<br>
If hydroxyl-functional compounds are present in coating composition a), the<br>
composition preferably comprises one or more catalysts for the crosslinking of<br>
isocyanate groups with hydroxyl groups. Examples thereof include Sn-based<br>
catalysts, such as dibutyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin diacetate, and tin octoate. Also<br>
basic catalysts are suitable.<br>
As mentioned above, the aqueous coating composition b) comprises at least 17<br>
mmol/kg, calculated on the weight of coating composition b), of a catalyst for the<br>
addition reaction of the at least one thiol-functional compound and the at least<br>
one isocyanate-functional compound of coating composition a). Such an<br>
amount of catalyst causes a measurable increase in the drying speed of coating<br>
composition a) upon application on the surface of a coating layer prepared from<br>
coating composition b). The actual amount of catalyst employed in coating<br><br>
composition b) further depends on the specific catalytic activity of the individual<br>
catalyst, on the equivalent weight of the catalyst, on the proportion of other<br>
components in coating composition b), on the type of isocyanate-functional<br>
compound selected, and on the required cure speed of coating composition a).<br>
Therefore, the most suitable amount of catalyst in coating composition b) may<br>
vary in very wide ranges. Generally, the amount of catalyst in coating<br>
composition b) is in the range of 17 millimol to 10 mol of catalyst per kg of<br>
coating composition, or 35 millimol to 9 mol per kg, or 50 millimol to 8 mol per<br>
kg, or 200 millimol to 7 mol per kg.<br>
Suitable catalysts in the aqueous coating composition b) are all compounds<br>
capable of accelerating the addition reaction of thiol-functional compounds and<br>
isocyanate-functional compounds.<br>
Generally, suitable catalysts are basic catalysts. Examples are inorganic basic<br>
compounds, such as hydroxides and basic oxides of metals. The hydroxides of<br>
lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium may be explicitly<br>

amine, N,N-diethyl ethanol amine, 1-dimethyl amino-2-propanol, 3-dimethyl<br>
amino-1-propanol, 2-dimethyl amino-2-methyl-1-propanol, N-methyl diethanol<br>
amine, triethanol amine, N-ethyl diethanol amine, N-butyl diethanol amine, N,N-<br>
dibutyl ethanol amine, and N-ethyl morpholine. N,N-dimethyl ethanol amine is a<br>
preferred catalyst in coating composition b).<br>
Also suitable are 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-<br>

The amine catalyst in coating composition b) can also be an amine-functional,<br>
optionally film-forming, polymer or resin, such as a (co)polymer of 2-<br>
(dimethylamino)ethyl (meth)acrylate.<br>
When the catalyst in coating composition b) is a base, it is preferred that the<br>
base is present as such, as compared to being present in blocked or neutralized<br>
form.<br>
The catalyst in coating composition b) can alternatively be a metal compound<br>
with an organic ligand where the metal is a metal of Groups 3 to 13 of the<br>
Periodic Table. Preferably, the metal is a transition metal. More preferably, the<br>
metal is a metal of Group 4 of the Periodic Table.<br>
The metal compounds comprise metal salts and/or complexes of organic<br>
compounds. The organic compounds are groups having 2 to 40 carbon atoms,<br>
optionally comprising atoms such as O, N, and S. The metal salts comprise<br>

Still another class of suitable catalysts in coating composition b) are co-catalysts<br>
comprising a phosphine and a Michael acceptor, such as described in<br>
International patent application WO 0168736. When such co-catalysts are used,<br>
it is possible that both components of the co-catalyst, i.e. the phosphine and the<br>
Michael acceptor, are present in coating composition b). Alternatively, it is also<br>
possible to include only one of the components in coating composition b) and to<br>
include the other component in coating composition a). Thus, when coating<br>
composition b) comprises a Michael acceptor, coating composition a) may<br>
comprise a phosphine. It is equally possible to include the phosphine in coating<br>
composition b) and to include the Michael acceptor ion coating composition a).<br>
The phosphine employed as one of the co-catalysts is a compound according to<br>

not directly linked to a phosphorus atom. Preferably, R is an alkyl or aryl group,<br>
more preferably the alkyl group has 1 to 15 carbon atoms and the aryl group<br>

of an addition polymer. The aqueous dispersion may be mixed with a metallic<br>
pigment such as aluminium, or a pigment such as a metal oxide-coated mica,<br>
so that coats of a metallic appearance may be obtained.<br>
The addition polymer suitably is a copolymer prepared in 2 or more steps by<br>
emulsion polymerization, and obtained by copolymerization in a first step of 60 -<br>
95 parts by weight, calculated on 100 parts by weight of the addition polymer, of<br>

90 parts by weight of the monomer mixture A and 10-20 parts by weight of the<br>

b)	relatively high-molecular weight organic polyhydroxyl compounds which<br>
have no hydrophilic groups or groups convertible into hydrophilic groups,<br>
c)	optionally, low-molecular weight compositions containing at least two<br>
isocyanate-reactive groups but no hydrophilic groups or groups capable of<br>
conversion into hydrophilic groups,<br>
d)	optionally, non-ionic hydrophilic starting components containing at least one<br>
isocyanate group or at least one isocyanate-reactive group, and<br><br>
e) optionally, starting components containing at least one ionic group or at least<br>
one group capable of conversion into an ionic group, as well as at least one<br>
isocyanate-reactive hydrogen atom,<br>
provided that the quantities of non-ionic groups and ionic groups present in<br>
components d) and e) are sufficient to ensure the dispersibility of the<br>
polyurethane polyureas in water.<br>
The reaction between isocyanate groups and hydroxyl groups results in<br>
urethane groups, while any urea groups present in the reaction products are<br>
formed from amine-functional starting components and/or the reaction between<br>
isocyanate groups and the dispersing water, which is always possible during the<br>
preparation of the aqueous polyurethane dispersions.<br>
Polyisocyanate component a) includes any polyisocyanate known from<br>
polyurethane chemistry. These polyisocyanates generally have a molecular<br>
weight of 112 to 1,000, preferably 140 to 400. Suitable polyisocyanates are<br>
those which correspond to the formula Q(NCO)n, wherein Q represents an<br>
organic group obtained by removing the isocyanate groups from an organic<br>
polyisocyanate having a molecular weight of 112 to 1,000, preferably 140 to<br>
400, and n stands for a number from 2 to 4, preferably 2 or 3, and more<br>
preferably 2. In the above formula Q preferably represents a divalent aliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon group having 4 to 18 carbon atoms, a divalent cycloaliphatic<br>
hydrocarbon group having 5 to 15 carbon atoms, a divalent aromatic<br>
hydrocarbon group having 6 to 15 carbon atoms or an araliphatic hydrocarbon<br>
group having 7 to 15 carbon atoms. Examples of suitable polyisocyanates<br>
include tetramethylene diisocyanate, 1,6-diisocyanatohexane (HDI) dodeca-<br>
methylene diisocyanate, 2,2,4-trimethylhexane diisocyanate, undecane<br>
diisocyanate-(1,11), lysine ester diisocyanate, cyclohexane-1,3- and -1,4-<br>
diisocyanate, 1 -isocyanato-3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethyl cyclohexane<br>
(IPDI), and 4,4'-diisocyanato dicyclohexylmethane. Also suitable are aromatic<br>
diisocyanates such as 2,4-diisocyanato toluene and/or 2,6-diisocyanato toluene,<br><br>
4,4"-diisocyanato diphenyl methane, and 1,4-diisocyanato isopropyl benzene.<br>
HDI, IPDI, and mixtures of these diisocyanates are particularly preferred.<br>
Component b) includes organic polyhydroxyl compounds having a molecular<br>
weight of 300 to 5,000, preferably from 500 to 3,000, and containing at least<br>
50% by weight, preferably more than 70% by weight, of polyhydroxy<br>
polycarbonates. The polyhydroxy polycarbonates are esters of carbonic acid<br>
obtained by the reaction of carbonic acid derivatives, e.g., diphenyl carbonate or<br>
phosgene, with diols. Examples of these diols include ethylene glycol, propane-<br>
1,2- and 1,3-diol, butane-1,4- and -1,3-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, octane-1,8-diol,<br>
neopentyl glycol, 1,4-bis-hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 2-methyl-propane-1,3-<br>
diol, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane-1,3-diol, diethylene glycol, tri- and tetraethylene<br>
glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycols, dibutylene glycol, polybutylene<br>
glycols, Bisphenol A and tetrabromo Bisphenol A. The diol component<br>
preferably contains from 40 to 100% by weight of a hexane diol, preferably<br>
hexane-1,6-diol, and/or hexane diol derivatives preferably containing ether or<br>
ester groups in addition to terminal OH groups, e.g., the products obtained by<br>
the reaction of 1 mole of hexane diol with &gt; 1 mole, preferably 1 to 2 moles, of<br>
caprolactone according to DE 17 70 245 or the products obtained by the self-<br>
etherification of hexane diol to form dihexylene or trihexylene glycol according to<br>
DE 15 70 540. The polyether polycarbonate diols described in DE 37 17 060 are<br>
also very suitable.<br>
The hydroxyl polycarbonates should be substantially linear although they may, if<br>
desired, be slightly branched by the incorporation of polyfunctional components,<br>
in particular low-molecular weight polyols such as glycerol, trimethylol propane,<br>
hexane-1,2,6-triol, butane-1,2,4-triol, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol,<br>
quinitol, mannitol and sorbitol, methyl glycoside and 1,4,3,6-dianhydrohexitols.<br>
In addition to the polyhydroxy polycarbonates, starting component b) may<br>
contain other known polyhydroxyl compounds having the previously described<br>
molecular weights, e.g.,<br><br>
b1) dihydroxy polyesters obtained from dicarboxylic acids such as succinic acid,<br>
adipic acid, suberic acid, azelaic acid, sebacic acid, phthaiic acid,<br>
isophthalic acid, terephthalic acid, tetrahydrophthalic acid, and from diols<br>
such as ethylene glycol, propane-1,2-diol, propane-1,3-diol, diethylene<br>
glycol, butane-1,4-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, octane-1,8-diol, neopentyl glycol, 2-<br>
methyl propane-1,3-diol, and the various isomeric bis-hydroxymethyl<br>
cyclohexanes;<br>
b2) polylactones such as the polymers of e-caprolactone initiated with the<br>
above-mentioned dihydric alcohols; and<br>
b3) polyethers, e.g., the polymers or copolymers of tetrahydrofuran, styrene<br>
oxide, propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, the butylene oxides or epichloro-<br>
hydrin initiated with divalent starter molecules such as water, the above-<br>
mentioned diols or amines containing 2 NH bonds, in particular the<br>
polymers and copolymers of propylene oxide and optionally ethylene oxide.<br>
Ethylene oxide may be used as a portion of the total quantity of ether<br>
molecules, provided the resulting polyether diol contains not more than 10%<br>
by weight of ethylene oxide units. It is preferred to use polyether diols which<br>
have been obtained without the addition of ethylene oxide, especially those<br>
based on propylene oxide and tetrahydrofuran alone.<br>
The optionally used starting components c) are known low-molecular-weight<br>
compounds which have a molecular weight below 300, contain hydroxyl and/or<br>
amino groups, and are at least difunctional in isocyanate addition reactions.<br>
Compounds which are difunctional in isocyanate addition reactions (chain<br>
extenders), compounds which are at least trifunctional in isocyanate addition<br>
reactions (cross-linking agents), and mixtures of such compounds may be used<br>
as starting components c). Examples of these compounds include low-<br>
molecular-weight polyhydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propane-1,2- and<br>
-1,3-diol, butane-1,4- and -1,3-diol, hexane-1,6-diol, octane-1,8-diol, neopentyl<br>
glycol, 1,4-bis-hydroxymethyl cyclohexane, 2-methyl-propane-1,3-diol, 2,2,4-<br><br>
trimethyl pentane-1,3-diol, glycerol, trimethylol propane, trimethylol ethane, the<br>
isomeric hexane triols and pentaerythritol; low-molecular-weight diamines such<br>
as ethylene diamine, 1,2- and 1,3-diaminopropane, 1,3-, 1,4- and 1,6-diamino-<br>
hexane, 1,3-diamino-2,2-dimethyl propane, isophorone diamine, 4,4'-diamino-<br>
dicyclohexyl methane, 4,4-diamino-3,3'-dimethyldicyclohexyl methane, 1,4-bis-<br>
(2-amino-prop-2-yl)-cyclohexane, hydrazine, hydrazide, and mixtures of such<br>
diamines and hydrazines; higher functional polyamines such as diethylene<br>
triamine, triethylene tetramine, dipropylene triamine, and tripropylene tetramine;<br>
hydrogenated products of addition of acrylonitrile to aliphatic or cycloaliphatic<br>
diamines, preferably those obtained by the addition of an acrylonitrile group to a<br>
molecule of a diamine, e.g., hexamethylene propylene triamine, tetramethylene<br>
propylene triamine, isophorone propylene triamine or 1,3- or 1,3-cyclohexane<br>
propylene triamine, and mixtures of such polyamines.<br>
The hydrophilic starting components d) are compositions containing ethylene<br>
oxide units incorporated within polyether chains, specifically:<br>
d1) diisocyanates and/or compositions which contain isocyanate-reactive<br>
hydrogen atoms and are difunctional in isocyanate polyaddition reactions,<br>
the diisocyanates and compositions also containing polyether side chains<br>
containing ethylene oxide units, and<br>
d2) monoisocyanates and/or compositions which are monofunctional in<br>
isocyanate polyaddition reactions and contain an isocyanate-reactive<br>
hydrogen atom, the monoisocyanates and compositions also containing<br>
terminal polyether chains containing ethylene oxide units, and<br>
d3) mixtures of d1) and d2).<br>
The preparation of these hydrophilic starting components is carried out by<br>
methods analogous to those described in US 3920598, US 3905929, US US<br>
4190566, and US 4237264.<br>
The compounds used as starting component e) have at least one isocyanate-<br>
reactive group and at least one (potentially) ionic group. They include the<br><br>
alcohols-containing tertiary amino groups, hydroxy carboxylic acids, hydroxy<br>
sulfonic acids, amino carboxylic acids, and amino sulfonic acids disclosed in US<br>
3479310. Instead of these starting components containing potentially ionic<br>
groups, the corresponding salt type derivatives thereof may be used, i.e. ionic<br>
groups formed by the quaternization or neutralization of the potentially ionic<br>
groups. Examples of suitable quaternizing and neutralizing agents for<br>
converting the potentially ionic groups into ionic groups are also set forth in US<br>
3479310. When potentially ionic starting components are used, the at least<br>
partial conversion of the potentially ionic groups into ionic groups is carried out<br>
by quaternization or neutralization after or during preparation of the<br>
polyurethane polyureas.<br>
Preferred starting components e) include 2,2-bis-(hydroxy-methyl)-alkane<br>
monocarboxylic acids having a total of 5 to 8 carbon atoms and/or salts thereof<br>
obtained by partial or complete neutralization with organic amines or NH3. 2,2-<br>
dimethylol propionic acid (2,2-bis-hydroxymethyl propionic acid) and/or salts<br>
thereof are particularly preferred for use as starting component e).<br>
Preparation of the polyurethanes from the starting components a) to e) is<br>
carried out in a known manner in one or more stages using the reactants in<br>
such proportions that the equivalent ratio of isocyanate groups present in the<br>
starting components to isocyanate-reactive groups present in the starting<br>
components is 0.8:1 to 2:1, preferably 0.95:1 to 1.5:1, and more preferably<br>
0.95:1 to 1.2:1.<br>
Component d) is used in a quantity such that the polyurethane polyurea<br>
contains 0 to 30% by weight, preferably from 1 to 20% by weight, of ethylene<br>
oxide units incorporated into terminal or lateral polyether chains.<br>
The quantity of component e) and the degree of neutralization required to form<br>
ionic groups are calculated to ensure that the polyurethane finally obtained<br>
contains 0 to 120, preferably 1 to 80 millimol, of ionic groups per 100 g of solids.<br>
The total quantity of ethylene oxide units and ionic groups must be sufficient to<br>
ensure the dispersibility of the polyurethane polyureas in water.<br><br>
The reaction of the starting components a) to e) may be carried out in one or<br>
more stages, optionally in the presence of an isocyanate-inert, water-miscible<br>
solvent, so that the reaction products are obtained in the form of a solution in<br>
such a solvent. In this context, the term "solution" denotes either a true solution<br>
or a water in oil emulsion which may be formed if, for example, individual<br>
starting components are used in the form of aqueous solutions. Examples of<br>
suitable solvents include acetone, methylethyl ketone, N-methyl pyrrolidone,<br>
and any mixtures of such solvents. These solvents are generally used in such<br>
quantities that the reaction products of starting components a) to e) are<br>
obtained in the form of a solution having a non-volatile content of 10 to 70% by<br>
weight.<br>
When the preparation of polyurethane polyureas is carried out as a single-stage<br>
reaction, the starting components containing isocyanate-reactive groups are<br>
preferably mixed together and then reacted with the starting components<br>
containing isocyanate groups. This reaction preferably is carried out initially in<br>
the absence of solvents at temperatures of 50 to 150°C, optionally in the<br>
presence of known catalysts.<br>
The viscosity of the mixture increases during the course of the reaction and one<br>
of the above-mentioned solvents is therefore gradually added to the mixture.<br>
The polyurethane content of the organic solution finally obtained is adjusted to a<br>
concentration of 10 to 70% by weight, in particular 15 to 55% by weight.<br>
When a two-stage process is employed, an isocyanate prepolymer preferably is<br>
first prepared solvent-free at about 50 to 150°C from excess quantities of<br>
isocyanate-containing starting components and hydroxyl-containing starting<br>
components at an NCO/OH equivalent ratio of 1.1:1 to 3.5:1, preferably 1.2:1 to<br>
2.5:1, with or without a solvent, and this isocyanate prepolymer is then taken up<br>
in a solvent if no solvent has been used up to this stage. The solution obtained<br>
is then further reacted with chain extenders or cross-linking agents c), which are<br>
optionally used in the form of aqueous solutions and are preferably starting<br>
components of the above-mentioned type containing primary and/or secondary<br><br>
amino groups. The quantity of starting components c) used in the second stage<br>
is calculated to ensure that the equivalent ratio of all the starting components<br>
used in the first and second stages conforms to the conditions previously stated.<br>
The end products of both variations (single-stage and two-stage) are solutions<br>
of the reaction products in the above-mentioned solvent having a solids content<br>
within the ranges indicated above.<br>
If any potentially ionic groups are present, their at least partial conversion into<br>
ionic groups by quatemization or neutralization is advantageously carried out<br>
before the addition of the dispersing water. If starting component e) contains<br>
carboxyl groups, which is preferred, in particular dimethylol propionic acid, the<br>
neutralizing agents used preferably are tertiary amines such as triethylamine,<br>
tri-n-butylamine, N,N,N-trimethyl cyclohexylamine, N-methyl morpholine, N-<br>
methyl piperazine, N,N-dimethyl ethanolamine, N-methyl piperidine, and<br>
triethanolamine. For the neutralization of carboxyl groups it is also preferred to<br>
use ammonia under the conditions set forth in EP 0269972 A.<br>
After the addition of water as solvent or dispersing medium, at least the major<br>
proportion of the auxiliary solvent used is optionally removed by distillation. The<br>
water is used in a quantity which is sufficient to provide a product with a solids<br>
content of 10 to 60% by weight, preferably 20 to 45% by weight.<br>
The polyurethane polyureas may also be prepared by other methods known in<br>
the art, for example by using hydrazine or diamines as chain extenders c) in a<br>
blocked form, i.e. in the form of the corresponding azines or ketimines, as<br>
disclosed in US 4269748 and US 4829122.<br>
Alternatively, the so-called prepolymer mixing process may be used. In this<br>
process, an NCO prepolymer is initially prepared as described above and after<br>
the at least partial conversion of any potentially ionic groups present into ionic<br>
groups, the prepolymer is mixed with water to form an emulsion. The NCO<br>
groups of the prepolymer are then brought to reaction in the aqueous phase by<br><br>
the addition of amine-functional chain extenders or cross-linking agents c)<br>
and/or by a reaction with water.<br>
One example of such a polyurethane polyurea dispersion is Bayhydrol VPLS<br>
2952 ex Bayer. Mixtures of polyurethanes may be used .<br>
Coating composition b) optionally comprises a curing agent capable of chemical<br>
reaction with the functional groups present in coating composition b). Examples<br>
of such functional groups are hydroxyl groups. Examples of suitable curing<br>
agents capable of chemical reaction are the polyisocyanates described above.<br>
In this case coating composition b) is at least partly curable by chemical<br>
reaction.<br>
A minor degree of crosslinking in layer b) can be beneficial for the performance<br>
of the multilayer coating system, in particular in view of an improved adhesion<br>
between layer a) and layer b). Therefore, in a preferred embodiment coating<br>
composition b) is a coating composition which dries essentially by physical<br>
drying, i.e. by evaporation of water, and to a minor degree by crosslinking.<br>
When coating composition b) dries essentially by crosslinking, the mobility<br>
and/or availability of the catalyst at the at least one layer boundary of layer a)<br>
and layer b) of the multi-layer system according to the invention may be<br>
insufficient to effectively cure coating composition a) in layer a). Accordingly, it<br>
is preferred that coating composition b) is not a coating composition comprising<br>
a polyisocyanate and a thiol-functional compound.<br>
Coating layer b) preferably is a colour- and/or effect-imparting base coat layer<br>
prepared from an aqueous base coat composition. Such a base coat<br>
composition usually comprises colour- and/or effect-imparting pigments. Colour-<br>
and/or effect-imparting pigments are well known in the art. Aluminium particles<br>
and mica particles may be specifically mentioned.<br>
As mentioned above, coating composition b) is an aqueous coating<br>
composition. This means that the volatile carrier liquid is mainly water. However,<br>
coating composition b) may also comprise minor amounts of organic solvents<br><br>
which are compatible with aqueous coating compositions. As suitable organic<br>
solvents may be mentioned ether group-containing alcohols such as<br>
butoxyethanol, 1-methoxy-propanol-2, 1-ethoxy-propanol-2, 1-propoxy-<br>
propanol-2, 1-butoxy-propanol-2, and 1-isobutoxy-propanol-2; alcohols, such as<br>
methanol and hexanol; and diols, such as ethylene glycol and diethylene glycol.<br>
The invention also relates to a kit of parts for the preparation of an aqueous<br>
base coat composition comprising a toner module comprising at least one resin<br>
and at least one colour- and/or effect-imparting pigment, optionally a connector<br>
module comprising at least one resin compatible with the resin of the toner<br>
module, and a reducer module essentially free of resins and pigments, wherein<br>
one of the modules comprises an effective amount of a catalyst for the addition<br>
reaction of a thiol-functional compound and a isocyanate-functional compound.<br>
Preferably, the effective amount of a catalyst for the addition reaction of a thiol-<br>
functional compound and an isocyanate-functional compound is comprised in<br>
the connector module or in the reducer module. The catalyst is present in non-<br>
neutralized form when the catalyst is a base catalyst.<br>
For the production of the multilayer coating system of the invention coating<br>
compositions a) and b) can be applied one after the other without intermediate<br>
drying, so called "wet-on-wet" application. Alternatively, there can be an<br>
intermediate drying step. The coating compositions a) and b) can be applied in<br>
random order and may be a filler composition, a primer composition, a base<br>
coat composition, a clear coat composition, and/or a top coat composition.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also relates to a process of preparing a multilayer<br>
coating system comprising the steps of<br>
(i) applying a layer b) of an aqueous coating composition b) comprising<br>
at least 17 mmol/kg, calculated on the weight of coating composition<br>
b), of a catalyst for the addition reaction of a thiol-functional<br>
compound and an isocyanate-functional compound to a substrate,<br><br>
(ii) prior to or subsequent to the application of layer b) applying a layer a)<br>
of a coating composition a) comprising at least one isocyanate-<br>
functional compound and at least one thiol-functional compound so<br>
that layer a) and layer b) have at least one common layer boundary,<br>
and<br>
(iii) curing layer a) at room temperature or elevated temperature,<br>
optionally supported by irradiation with UV and/or visible light.<br>
In one embodiment coating composition b) is first applied on an optionally<br>
coated substrate and subsequently coating composition a) is applied on top of<br>
coating composition b) in order to obtain the multilayer coating system<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Application onto a substrate can be via any method known to the skilled person,<br>
e.g., via rolling, spraying, brushing, flow coating, dipping, and roller coating.<br>
Preferably, at least one of the coating compositions a) and b) as described<br>
above is applied by spraying. Coating composition a) and coating composition<br>
b) may also both be sprayable coating compositions.<br>
The coating compositions according to the present invention can be applied to<br>
any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, e.g., iron, steel, and<br>
aluminium, plastic, wood, glass, synthetic material, paper, leather, or another<br>
coating layer, such as a primer or filler layer.<br>
Curing temperatures are generally between 0 and 80°C, or between 20 and<br>
60°C.<br>
A specific application of the coating system is as a base coat/clear coat system,<br>
such as is often used in the coating of automobiles and transportation vehicles.<br>
In this case coating composition b) may be an aqueous base coat composition<br>
and coating composition a) may be a clear coat composition. The coating<br>
system and the process are especially useful in the refinish industry, in<br>
particular the body shop, to refinish and to repair automobiles. The coating<br>
system and the process are also applicable in the automotive industry and for<br><br>
the finishing of large transportation vehicles, such as trains, buses, trucks, and<br>
airplanes, and parts thereof.<br>

drying base coat layers from comparative coating compositions bα) to be) to<br>
primed aluminium panels as prescribed in the technical documentation of<br>
Autowave. The dry layer thickness of the base coats was about 15 to 40 µm.<br>
Subsequently, the sprayable clear coat composition a) as described above was<br>
spray-applied on the base coat layers. The applied clear coats had a dry layer<br>
thickness of about 50 to 80 µm. The clear coats were allowed to dry at room<br>
temperature (20 to 24°C).<br><br>
Preparation of an aqueous coating composition b1) according to the invention:<br>
A physically drying sprayable water borne white base coat composition was<br>
prepared by mixing the following components:<br>
098 (toner module)	900 g<br>

DMEA	10 g<br>
Preparation of an aqueous coating composition b2) according to the invention:<br>
A physically drying sprayable water borne green base coat composition was<br>
prepared by mixing the following components:<br>
577 (toner module)	900 g<br>
Activator WB (reducer module)	90 g<br>
DMEA	10 g<br>
Preparation of an aqueous coating composition b3) according to the invention:<br>
A physically drying sprayable water borne red base coat composition was<br>
prepared by mixing the following components:<br>
504 (toner module)	900 g<br>
Activator WB (reducer module)	90 g<br>
DMEA	10 g<br>
Preparation of an aqueous coating composition b4) according to the invention:<br>
A physically drying sprayable water borne silver metallic base coat composition<br>
was prepared by mixing the following components:<br>
888EC (toner module)	900 g<br>
Activator WB (reducer module)	90 g<br>
DMEA	10g<br><br>
Preparation of an aqueous coating composition b5) according to the invention:<br>
A physically drying sprayable water borne gold, metallic base coat composition<br>
was prepared by mixing the following components:<br>
888YA (toner module)	900 g<br>
Activator WB (reducer module)	90 g<br>
DMEA	10 g<br>
Coating compositions b1) to b5) according to the invention contain 1% by<br>
weight, calculated on the weight of the total composition, of N,N-dimethyl<br>
ethanolamine (DMEA) as basic catalyst. This corresponds to 112 mmol/kg of<br>
basic catalyst, calculated on the weight of coating composition b). Multilayer<br>
coating systems 1 to 5 according to the invention were prepared by applying<br>
and drying base coat layers from coating compositions b1) to b5) to primed<br>
aluminium panels as prescribed in the technical documentation of Autowave.<br>
The dry layer thickness of the base coats was about 15 to 40 µm.<br>
Subsequently, the sprayable clear coat composition a) as described above was<br>
spray-applied on the base coat layers. The applied clear coats had a dry layer<br>
thickness of about 50 to 80 µrn. The clear coats were allowed to dry at room<br>
temperature (20 to 24°C) in a laboratory with normal illumination, i.e. without UV<br>
radiation.<br>
Drying of the clear coats was determined manually. The clear coat was<br>
considered dust-dry when gentle rubbing with the thumb hardly left a mark. A<br>
tuft of wadding, dropped on the paint, could be blown off. The clear coat was<br>
considered dry-to-handle when the mark from firm pushing with the thumb<br>
disappeared after 1-2 minutes.<br><br><br>
From Table 1 it can be inferred that the addition of a basic catalyst to coating<br>
composition b) leads to an increased drying speed of a coating composition a)<br>
comprising an isocyanate-functional compound and thiol-functional compounds,<br>
applied on top of a layer of coating composition b). In the multilayer coating<br>
systems 1 to 5 according to the invention the drying times of the clear coats are<br>
shorter than the drying times of the clear coats in the corresponding<br>
comparative multilayer coating systems A to E. This indicates an increase of the<br>
cure speed also when the clear coat is not irradiated with UV radiation. The<br>
multilayer coating systems according to the invention also have other desirable<br>
properties, such as low strike-in, good hardness, flexibility, scratch resistance,<br>
high gloss, and good resistance to organic solvents and water.<br><br>
