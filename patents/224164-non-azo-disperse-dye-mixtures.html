NON-AZO DISPERSE DYE MIXTURES<br>
This invention relates to mixtures of disperse non-azo dyes.<br>
Mixed disperse dyes and their use for dyeing polyester and its blends with other<br>
fibres such as cellulose, elastane, nylon and wool by normal exhaust dyeing,<br>
continuous dyeing and direct printing techniques are already known for example<br>
from the documents EP1188799 A1, and WO0022048. However, they have<br>
certain application defects, such as for example relatively poor leveling/migration<br>
properties, an overly large dependence of the colour yield on varying dyeing<br>
parameters in the dyeing process or an insufficient colour build-up on polyester<br>
(good colour build-up results from the ability of a dye to provide a proportionally<br>
stronger dyeing when used in higher concentrations in the dye bath), or<br>
unsatisfactory fastness properties.<br>
However there is a need for disperse dyes which provide dyeings of improved<br>
fastness properties, i.e. wash and light fastness properties of dyed polyester or<br>
its blends with other fibres such as cellulose, elastane, nylon and wool.<br>
The present invention, then, provides dye mixtures of disperse dyes which<br>
provide dyeings of very good wet and light fastness properties on polyester or<br>
its blends with other fibres.<br>
The invention accordingly provides dye mixtures comprising one dye of the<br>
herein below indicated and defined formula (I)<br>
and one or more, such as two or three, preferably 1 or 2, dyes of the herein<br>
below indicated and defined general formula (II)<br>
wherein<br>
R1 and R2 are independently<br>
hydrogen, alkoxy [OR3 ] or substituted alkoxy [O(CH2)n R4],<br>
in which<br>
n can be 1 to 6<br>
R3 is alkyl or alkenyl each of which can be optionally substituted by a<br>
unsubstituted or a substituted saturated or unsaturated 5-, 6-, or 7-<br>
membered heterocyclic or homocyclic residue;<br>
R4 is a group of the formula (1) or (2)<br>
-OR5 -COR6<br>
(1) (2)<br>
wherein<br>
R5 is hydrogen for n more than 1, alkyl for n more than 1, alkenyl, aryl,<br>
alkoxyalkyl, aryloxyaikyl, carbonylalkyl, carbonylalkenyl, carbonylaryl,<br>
carbonylalkoxyalkyl or carbonylaryloxyalkyl;<br>
R6 is alkoxy, alkenyloxy, aryloxy, arylalkoxy, aryloxyalkoxy,<br>
alkenyloxyalkyloxy or alkoxyalkoxy.<br>
Alkyl R may be straight-chain or branched and is in particular C1-C1, such as<br>
methyl, ethyl n-propyl, isopropyol, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl.<br>
Methyl and ethyl are preferred. The same logic applies to (C1-C4)-alkoxy groups.<br>
Alkenyl R is in particular C2-C4- such as ethenyl, propenyl, butenyl.<br>
Specific structures which would be of interest covered by the general formula<br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is a mixture comprising dyestuff<br>
according to formula (I) and at least one of the following dyestuffs of the<br>
formula (II-1), (II-9), (II-10) or (II-11), or a mixture comprising dyestuff (I) and<br>
one or more dyestuffs of the formula (II-2), (II-1 2), (II-1 3), (II-14), or a mixture<br>
comprising dyestuff (I) and one or more dyestuffs of the formula (II-3), (II-4), (II-<br>
5), (II-6), (II-7), (II-8).<br>
The dye of the general formula (I) is present in the mixtures in an amount of from 5<br>
to 95 % by weight, preferably of from 75 to 90 % by weight, and the dye, respectively<br>
dyes of the general formula (II) are present in the mixtures in an amount of from 95<br>
to 5 % by weight, preferably of from 10 to 25 % by weight.<br>
The dyes according to the general formula (I) are known from WO-9521958, the<br>
dyes of the general formula (II) are partially known from WO 9704031.<br>
Mixtures embodying the invention can be prepared, for example, by mixing the<br>
dye components in the required amounts. Suitable mixing methods include<br>
Co-crystallisation<br>
Typically, the dyes are dissolved in a hot solvent, for example, by placing the<br>
dyes in a suitable solvent and heating up to the reflux temperature of the solvent<br>
until the dyes are dissolved, thereafter filtering to provide a solution, and then<br>
allowing the solution to cool and crystals to form. The resultant mixture may<br>
then undergo further processing, such as milling and spray drying. Examples of<br>
suitable solvents for this process are organic solvents such as aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons, chlorinated hydrocarbons, aliphatic hydrocarbons, alicyclic<br>
hydrocarbons, alcohols, amides, sulphoxides, esters, ketones and ethers.<br>
Specific examples of organic solvents are toluene, ethyl cellosolve, acetone,<br>
chlorobenzene, pyridine, dimethyl formamide, dimethylsulphoxide, ethyl acetate,<br>
benzene, tetrahydrofuran and cyclohexane.<br>
Co-crystallisation is generally unsuitable for mixtures containing more than two<br>
components.<br>
Co-milling<br>
(a) The dyes are mixed and then milled together to give an intimate blend which<br>
is then spray dried to give a solid mixture; or<br>
(b) each dye is milled separately and then mixed in the required ratio before<br>
spray drying.<br>
Dry Blending<br>
Each dye is spray dried separately and then mixed in the required ratio by a dry<br>
blending process.<br>
Mixtures embodying the invention provide especially useful disperse dyes<br>
valuable for colouring synthetic textile materials such as polyester, microfibre<br>
polyester and fibre blends thereof such as polyester-cellulose, polyester-wool,<br>
polyester-polyurethane or polyester-nylon, by exhaust dyeing, padding or<br>
printing, and may be formed into dispersions for this purpose. They may also be<br>
used in, for example, ink jet printing of textiles and non-textiles, dye diffusion,<br>
thermal transfer printing and in the colouration of plastics.<br>
A particular aspect of the invention provides a composition comprising a mixture<br>
of dye (I) and (II), and additionally, at least one further ingredient conventionally<br>
used in colouring applications such as a dispersing agent and optionally a<br>
surfactant or wetting agent. The composition typically comprises from 1 % to<br>
65%, preferably 10 to 60%, more preferably 20 to 55%, of the total dye<br>
mixture in a solid medium.<br>
Typical examples of dispersing agent are lignosulphonates, naphthalene<br>
sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensates and phenol/cresol/sulphanilic<br>
acid/formaldehyde condensates, typical examples of wetting agent are alkyl aryl<br>
ethoxylates which may be sulphonated or phosphated and typical example of<br>
other ingredients which may be present are inorganic salts, de-foamers such as<br>
mineral oil or nonanol, organic liquids and buffers. Dispersing agents may be<br>
present at from 10% to 200% on the weight of the dye mixtures. Wetting<br>
agents may be used at from 0% to 20% on the weight of the dye mixtures.<br>
The compositions may be prepared by bead milling the dye mixture with glass<br>
beads or sand in an aqueous medium. The compositions may have further<br>
additions of dispersing agents, fillers and other surfactants and may be dried, by<br>
a technique such as spray drying, to give a solid composition comprising from<br>
5% to 65% of dyestuff.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention provides a process for colouring a<br>
synthetic textile material or fibre blend thereof which comprises applying to the<br>
synthetic textile material or fibre blend a mixture comprising a dye of the formula<br>
(I) and at least one dye of the formula (II).<br>
The synthetic textile material may be selected from aromatic polyester,<br>
especially polyethylene terephthalate, polyamide, especially polyhexamethylene<br>
adipamide, secondary cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, and natural textile<br>
materials, especially cellulosic materials and wool, or blends of polyester and<br>
polyurethane, or polyester and nylon. An especially preferred textile material is<br>
an aromatic polyester or fibre blend thereof with fibres of any of the above<br>
mentioned textile materials. Especially preferred fibre blends include those of<br>
polyester-cellulose, such as polyester-cotton, and polyester-wool. The textile<br>
materials or blends thereof may be in the form of filaments, loose fibres, yarn or<br>
woven or knitted fabrics.<br>
The mixtures of dyes of formulae (I) and (II) may be applied to the synthetic<br>
textile materials or fibre blends by processes which are conventionally employed<br>
in applying disperse dyes to such materials and fibre blends.<br>
Suitable process conditions may be selected from the following<br>
(i) exhaust dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 125°C<br>
to 140°C for from 10 to 120 minutes and under a pressure of from 1 to 2<br>
bar, a sequestrant optionally being added;<br>
(ii) continuous dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from<br>
190°C to 225°C for from 15 seconds to 5 minutes, a migration inhibitor<br>
optionally being added;<br>
(iii) direct printing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 160°C<br>
to 185°C for from 4 to 1 5 minutes for high temperature steaming, or at a<br>
temperature of from 190°C to 225°C for from 1 5 seconds to 5 minutes<br>
for bake fixation with dry heat or at a temperature of from 1 20°C to<br>
140°C and 1 to 2 bar for from 10 to 45 minutes for pressure steaming,<br>
wetting agents and thickeners (such as alginates) of from 5 to 100% by<br>
weight of the dye optionally being added;<br>
(iv) discharge printing (by padding the dye on to the textile material, drying<br>
and overprinting) at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, migration inhibitors and<br>
thickeners optionally being added;<br>
(v) carrier dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 95°C to<br>
100°C using a carrier such as methylnaphthalene, diphenylamine or 2-<br>
phenylphenol, sequestrants optionally being added; and<br>
(vi) atmospheric dyeing of acetate, triacetate and nylon at a pH of from 4 to<br>
6.5, at a temperature of 85°C for acetate or at a temperature of 90°C for<br>
triacetate and nylon for from 1 5 to 90 minutes, sequestrants optionally<br>
being added.<br>
In all the above processes, the dye mixture is applied as a dispersion comprising<br>
from 0.001 % to 20%, preferably from 0.005 to 16%, of the dye mixture in an<br>
aqueous medium.<br>
In addition to the above-mentioned application processes, the dye mixtures may<br>
be applied to synthetic textile materials and fibre blends by ink-jet printing, the<br>
substrates optionally having been pre-treated to aid printing. For ink-jet<br>
applications, the application medium may comprise water and a water-soluble<br>
organic solvent, preferably in a weight ratio of 1:99 to 99:1, more preferably<br>
1:95 to 50:50 and especially in the range 10:90 to 40:60. The water-soluble<br>
organic solvent preferably comprises a C1-4-alkanol, especially methanol or<br>
ethanol, a ketone, especially acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, 2-pyrrolidone or N-<br>
methylpyrrolidone, a glycol, especially ethylene glycol, propylene glycol,<br>
trimethylene glycol, butane-2,3-diol, thiodiglycol or diethylene glycol, a glycol<br>
ether, especially ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol<br>
monomethyl ether or diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, urea, a sulphone,<br>
especially bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) sulphone or mixtures thereof.<br>
The dye mixtures may also be applied to textile materials using supercritical<br>
carbon dioxide, in which case the dye formulating agents may optionally be<br>
omitted.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in more detail with<br>
reference to the following Examples, in which parts are by weight unless<br>
otherwise stated.<br>
Example 1<br>
A mixture of 27.77 parts of dye (I) and 4.53 parts of dyestuffs according to<br>
formula (II-1) was prepared by mixing the two dyes together and milling them as<br>
a 40% aqueous slurry with 20 parts of a high temperature stable dispersing<br>
agent until the dye particle size (mean diameter) was in the range 0.1-5<br>
microns.<br>
This dispersion was standardised to a solid brand containing 32.3% of the<br>
mixture and 67.7% dispersing agent, by the addition of 47.7 parts of a<br>
temperature stable dispersing agent and drying to either a grain or powder form<br>
in a spray dryer.<br>
A dyebath for the exhaust dyeing of polyester in piece form was prepared by<br>
adding 1.8 ml of an aqueous dispersion of the solid brand (1g dye in 100 ml<br>
water at 40-50° C) to 57 ml of deionised water and 1.2 ml of buffer solution.<br>
To this dyebath was added a 5g piece of polyester and the whole was held for<br>
45 minutes at 130° C in a high temperature dyeing machine. After rinsing with<br>
water and a reduction clearing treatment, the material was dyed a bright red<br>
shade with excellent wet and light fastness. An interesting feature of the<br>
mixture is its good leveling/migration performance during the dyeing process.<br>
Example 2<br>
A mixture of 31.19 parts of dye (I) and 12 parts of dyestuff (II-1) was prepared<br>
by mixing the two dyes together and milling them as a 40% aqueous slurry with<br>
25 parts of a high temperature stable dispersing agent until the dye particle size<br>
(mean diameter) was in the range 0.1-5 microns.<br>
This dispersion was standardised to a solid brand containing 43.19% of the<br>
mixture and 56.81 % dispersing agent, by the addition of 31.81 parts of a<br>
temperature stable dispersing agent and drying to either a grain or powder form<br>
in a spray dryer.<br>
A dyebath for the exhaust dyeing of polyester in piece form was prepared by<br>
adding 1.2 mls of an aqueous dispersion of the solid brand (1g dye in 100 ml<br>
water at 40-50° C) to 57.5 ml of de-ionised water and 1.2 ml of buffer solution.<br>
To this dyebath was added a 5g piece of polyester and the whole was held for<br>
45 minutes at 130° C in a high temperature dyeing machine. After rinsing with<br>
water and a reduction clearing treatment, the material was dyed a bright red<br>
shade with excellent wet and light fastness. An interesting feature of the<br>
mixture is its good leveling/migration performance during the dyeing process.<br>
Further dye mixtures based on dye (I) and a dyestuff corresponding to general<br>
formula (II) were applied to polyester under the exhaust dyeing conditions<br>
described in Examples 1 and 2. Again after the normal clearing treatments, the<br>
dyeings obtained were bright red in shade and gave excellent wet and light<br>
fastness. All the mixtures evaluated exhibited good leveling/migration<br>
performance during the dyeing process.<br>
A mixture of 25.81 parts of dye (I), 1.52 parts of dye of formula (II-1), 4.91<br>
parts of dye of formula (II-2) and 2.32 parts of dye of formula (II-3) was<br>
prepared by mixing the four dyes together and milling them as a 40% aqueous<br>
slurry with 20 parts of a high temperature stable dispersing agent until the dye<br>
particle size (mean diameter) was in the range 0.1-5 microns.<br>
This dispersion was standardised to a solid brand containing 34.64% of the<br>
mixture and 65.36% dispersing agent, by the addition of 45.36 parts of a<br>
temperature stable dispersing agent and drying to either a grain or powder form<br>
in a spray dryer. This product is especially suitable for the exhaust dyeing of<br>
polyester(including microfibre and weight reduced polyester), polyester/cellulose<br>
polyester/elastane and polyester/wool blends and can also be used for<br>
continuous dyeing and direct printing.<br>
A dyebath for the exhaust dyeing of polyester in piece form was prepared by<br>
adding 1.5 ml of an aqueous dispersion of the solid brand (1g dye in 100 ml<br>
water at 40-50° C) to 57.3 ml of deionised water and 1.2 ml of buffer solution.<br>
To this dyebath was added a 5g piece of polyester and the whole was held for<br>
45 minutes at 130° C in a high temperature dyeing machine.<br>
After rinsing with water and a reduction clearing treatment, the material was<br>
dyed a bright bluish red shade with excellent wet and light fastness. An<br>
interesting feature of the mixture is its good leveling/migration performance<br>
during the dyeing process.<br>
