FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general, relates to routing Mobile advertisements to display devices like TV via a short-range wireless/wired medium. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method to route incoming advertisements on a wireless handheld communication device to a display device such as TV for a larger display through a short range wireless bearer like Bluetoothor any wired medium such as Universal Serial Bus (USB).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Currently mobile advertisements are broadcasted by mobile operators and every subscriber gets the same advertisement, displayed on the mobile screen. However, since the display size of mobile phones is small, in most cases, the ads can't be well presented.<br>
In the US patent titled "Mobile Communication System and Method" bearing no, 2006/01500/0 describes a method and system for presenting promotional (advertising) content in association with main content on a presentation device {e.g. TV) However, the patent application does not describe detection of the mobile communication terminal by the presentation device. Moreover, the application does not mention about user profiling for the purpose of targeted advertising.<br>
In yet another US Patent publication, titled 'Method and System for Providing Targete.. Aaverusing in Public Places and Garners" (US patent no, US 2002/0156677) describes a method and system for displaying targeted advertisements on the basis of profiles of nearby users on an electronic display device Detection of an individual is done by means of RFID. Advertisements are selected from a pre-defined database on the basis of preferences of individuals. However the application does not indicate routing of advertisements from mobile device to display device.<br>
From the foregoing, it becomes obvious that even though the prior art talks about<br><br>
displaying targeted ads in mobile phones, and detection of mobile device using technology such as RFID, none mentions about a method by which ads received on a mobile communication device such as a PDA can be transferred to a display device such as TV for a larger display. Based on this premise, the present invention is detailed herein<br>
The present invention attempts to fill the void in the state of the art literature by proposing a method to route incoming advertisements on a wireless handheld communication device to a display device such as TV for a larger display through a short-range wireless medium such as Bluetooth, or any wired medium such as Universal Senal Bus (USB).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is theretore the primary object of the present invention to route incoming advertisements on a wireless handheld communication device to a display device such as IV for a larger display through a short-range wireless medium such as Bluetooth or any wired medium such as Universal Serial Bus (USB).<br>
It is another object of the invention to display advertisements on a display device irrespective of whether the display device is tuned to a broadcasted television program or not.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to let users interact with advertisements on<br>
TV through handheld devices.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to display advertisements on TV without using<br>
the TV Droadcast infrastructure.<br>
Accordingly the present invention proposes a method to route incoming advertisements on a wireless handheld communication device to a display device such as TV for a larger display, using short range wireless connectivity mechanism such as Bluetooth, Infrared, WLAN or any wired medium such as Universal Serial Bus (USB)  the method comprising.<br><br>
•	Detecting the mobile device by the display device automatically, using some detection mechanism like RFID, when it comes in its vicinity;<br>
•	Triggering a short-range wireless bearer like Bluetooth, WLAN, UWB or Infrared on detection of mobile device and thereby connecting the display device to the mobile device<br>
•	Forwarding the advertisements received by the mobile device to the display device using a pre-defined protocol;<br>
•	Displaying the received advertisements by the display device in a predefined or user specified dedicated screen area<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed deschption of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts advertisements from mobile operator to handheld device.<br>
Figure 2 depicts advertisement from phone to TV,<br>
Figure 3 depicts proposed mechanism on TV for displaying mobile advertisements.<br>
Figure 4 depicts when the icon is selected the channel could be displayed as shown<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be<br><br>
embodiea in various forms. The following description is not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However m certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, when a user is in the vicintiy of the TV, his mobile device will be detected by the TV automafica/ly by using some detection mechanism like RFID or other short range detection mechanism Once the mobile device is detected, the mobile device will trigger the short-range wireless bearer like Bluetooth, WLAN, UWB or Infrared and then mobile device establish a connection with the TV. Bearer mechanism to connect to the TV could also be wired (such as USB or Serial). The interaction between mobile device and display device like TV could be via STB. In that case the detection and data exchange takes place between mobile device and STB over short range wireless bearer then STB communicates with display device like TV over wired or wireless medium to display the contents send by mobile device.<br>
Now, the mobile device can receive advertisements from network operators through<br>
Using SMS as bearer Data connectivity Mobile TV protocols<br>
An application on the mobile device will forward these advertisements to the TV through a pre-defined protocol. The TV software will receive the advertisement from mobile device and display it in a predefined (or customized by user) dedicated screen area<br>
When  the  user changes  the  channels the  advertisements  will  continue to  be<br><br>
displayed on the screen The location of the advertisement may be different on different channels (as preset/customized by user)<br>
The TV manufacturer may also define a fixed area of screen for displaying the<br>
advertisements.<br>
Text based advertisements can be presented as scrolling text. Ads may also be in the form of an image, animation or video. Non-text based advertisement presentations may be on a small portion of the screen overlapping the channel contents<br>
An option can also be provided to enlarge the presentation on full screen. That option can be triggered by the user using his handheld device or through an external interface device (such as a remote control).<br>
An option could be provided where STB or TV can inform the mobile device the channel being viewed by the user. The mobile device can send this information to the operator over wireless bearer service like SMS, Data Call. In that case the operator can push the advertisement based on the channel being viewed by the user<br>
Operators, on the other hand, host a server for advertisements and earn revenue from enterprises to send these advertisements to mobile devices.<br>
Benefits to the user for viewing such advertisements on TV could be decided by the<br>
operatcr<br>
Viewing statistics of advertisements can be collected and also rated by the user and sent to the operator. The method for this kind of feedback sent to the operator could involve using any of the below bearer services provided to the user by the provider<br>
SMS Data Call<br><br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
•	A new mechanism for hosting advertisements on TV<br>
•	More viewing and better presentation for mobile advertisements<br>
•	Providing Operators a new source of revenue through advertisements<br>
•	Benefits could be provided to users for viewing advertisements.<br>
•	This method provides a way of interacting with advertisements on TV through handheld devices,<br>
•	Currently for posting any advertisement on TV, a company has to go through the TV Broadcasters, Above method enables advertisements to be displayed on TV without using the TV broadcast infrastructure. Hence companies wishing to advertise will be provided another mechanism to reach their consumers through televisions.<br>
•	Aaverusement could be potentially displayed even while the TV is not tuned to a broadcasted television program.<br>
