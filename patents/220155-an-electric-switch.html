				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to an electric switch according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
A generic electric switch is, for instance, an additional switch for being mounted to an automatic cutout which is known from publication DE 39 20 822 C2. This conventional additional switch shows a switching mechanism which can be actuated not only by the automatic cutout via a coupling member but also by an actuation hand gag linked to the additional switch. The switching mechanism switches an auxiliary and/or error signal contact. The actuation hand gag shows the switch position of the additional switch in such a manner that it can ibe recognized externally.<br>
Usually, such conventional additional switches are laterally mounted to the automatic cutout and coupled therewith by clamps, for example. The additional switch is supported with its housing on the automatic cutout which is locked onto a top hat rail fixed to a wall mostly horizontally. In this connection, the fitting position of the additional switch is determined such that the actuation hand gag being positioned in the upper end position indicates that the additional switch is switched on. This complies with the regulations uniform in all countries of the European Union.<br>
In Germany, for instance, the current supply to the switches locked onto the top hat rail is carried out via a bus bar located below the top hat rail, whereas in other countries, such as France and Italy, the current supply is carried out via a bus bar located above the top hat rail. Since the additional switch has separate connections which, when being clipped onto the top hat rail, are to be positioned on the side averted from the bus bar, usually different mirror symmetrical structural types of the additional switches have to be provided for<br>
Ythe different countries. Only in this way is it guaranteed that the actuation hand gag is located in the specified upper end position when the additional switch is switched on, although its connections are positioned on different sides of the top hat rail in the different countries due to the differ ently mounted bus bars. This leads to increased development and inventory cost as well as additional administrative expense .<br>
Therefore the invention is based on the object of further developing the electric switch according to the preamble of claim 1 such that it can be used for all purposes at the* lowest possible<br>
According to the invention, this problem is solved by the features of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous further developments are defined in the dependent claims .<br>
The electric switch according to the invention consists of two separate modules which can alternatively be fitted in different positions. In this manner, an electric switch assembly set which is uniform for all countries is provided, so that the inventory cost and the administrative expense are reduced. The two modules are put together as specified and assembled on the spot as electric switches. The electric switch which, according to the invention, is divided in an kit-like manner, cannot only be an additional switch which can be released externally for being mounted to an automatic cutout, but also the automatic cutout itself which can be released automatically.<br>
It is expedient to design the electric switch as an additional switch which can be released externally and which can be attached to an automatic cutout by coupling means.<br><br>
In an advantageous further development,, the built-on module of the assembly set put together with the base supporting module carries not only the actuation hand gag but also the complete switching mechanism. By this measure, a division of the electric switch into a base supporting module only comprising the electrical contact and a built-on module which shows all mechanical components is achieved. This division into an electrical module and a mechanical module has a great advantage as far as maintenance is relate toed, too. In case of a mechanical defect, only the mechanical module has to be replaced, so that the regular running costs can be reduced. Further, a mechanical module of an additional switch mounted adjacently can be transferred for test purposes, so that the test work can be performed without having to carry out a complicated loosening of the connections. Of course only the electrical module has to be exchanged if there is a defect in it, whereas the mechanical module can be re-used.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the built-on module can be pushed into a recess of the base supporting module, being preferably guided by guide means. First, the built-on module is pushed into the recess of the base supporting module in such a manner that the position of the actuation hand gag complies with the prescriptions concerning the switch-on position of the electric switch. Then, depending on the position of the bus bar, the assembled set is mounted in the correct position to the automatic cutout. If the electric switch is used as an additional switch, the assembled set is fitted to the automatic cutout by means of the coupling means. This fitting is particularly advantageous for the person carrying it out, because inadvertent confusions of the fitting positions are excluded.<br>
So as to prevent short-circuits and the like during fitting, the base supporting module of the additional switch is provided with connections accessible from the front only on one half in the vertical direction. The base supporting module can<br><br>
then be mounted to the automatic cutout locked on the top hat rail such that this half is located on the side averted from the bus bar, so that short-circuits due to an inadvertent contact of the cables plugged into the connections of the additional switch with the bus bar can be avoided.<br>
A particular advantage can be achieved if a tappet of the switching mechanism projects vertically centrally to the rear from the built-on module. Thereby the interaction of the tappet with the contact in the base supporting module is reliably guaranteed, in particular when both modules have the same width and the different fitting positions of the built-on module into the base supporting module are offset with respect to each other by an angle of 180 degrees.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments relate to guide means on both modules, which help to support a smooth pushing-in, as well as a division of the built-on module - particularly easy to be mounted - into a hollowed housing side part for pre-assembling the mechanical components and a flat housing cover.<br>
In the following, the invention will be further explained by means of a preferred embodiment while referring to the attached drawings.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of an embodiment according to the invention of an additional switch assembly set in an assembled state,<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic view of the embodiment of Fig. 1 just before the assembly for being used in Germany,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a schematic view of the embodiment of Fig. 1 just before the assembly for being used in France or Italy, respectively,<br><br>
Fig. 4 shows a perspective view of a housing side part of a built-on module,<br>
Fig. 5 shows a perspective view of a housing cover for the housing side part shown in Fig. 4, and<br>
Fig. 6 shows a schematic lateral view of a base module which can be assembled with the built-on module of Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic view of an embodiment of an electric switch in the form of an additional switch assembly set in an assembled state. The additional switch 1 serves as an auxiliary switch which can be fixed laterally to a non-shown automatic cutout. The auxiliary switch 1 consists of two separate modules which can be assembled, a base supporting module 5 and a built-on module 2 attachable thereto.<br>
The actuation hand gag 3 for manual acknowledgment as well as switching on and off manually is linked to the built-on module 2. A switching mechanism 4 which can be actuated by the actuation hand gag 3 is located within the built-on module 2. The switching mechanism 4 shows a plurality of levers linked in the built-on module 2, which are shown symbolically in Fig. 1.<br>
When mounting the auxiliary switch 1 to the automatic cutout, the switching mechanism 4 becomes coupled to a non-shown switching mechanism of the automatic cutout by a non-shown coupling member. Thus, the switching mechanism 4 of the auxiliary switch 1 can be released externally. Preferably, the coupling member is a straight pin engaging the automatic cutout, or a strap cranked twice to form right angles in a Z-like shape. The pin or strap extends through an opening 2'd shown in Fig. 4 or through an opening 2'd shown in Fig. 5 laterally through the housing of the built-on module 2 into the interior of the housing. In the state of delivery, the openings 2'd and 2'd are covered by seals which can simply be removed when necessary in order to unblock the openings. These openings 2'd<br><br>
afnd 2"d are provided on both sides of the built-on module 2, so that it can be mounted to the automatic cutout from both sides. In addition, it is not only possible to mount the auxiliary switch 1 to the automatic cutout from both sides, but a plurality of further additional switches can be stacked in any number whatsoever, each coupled by pins or straps. The auxiliary switch 1 according to the invention can be mounted to such a multiple combination of switches in the furthest right or left position as well as in a central position.<br>
The pin or strap is, at a coupling point, operatively engaged with one or more levers of the switching mechanism 4 of the built-on module 2. The strap for coupling shows the Z-like shape cranked twice to form right angles, so that an exact coupling of the switching mechanisms is achieved by twisting the Z-strap, if the positions of the coupling points are not coincident. A further coupling, which is known per se, is carried out by a pin penetrating the knob of the actuation hand gag 3 and being pushed into the knob of an actuation hand gag of the automatic cutout. Then both actuation hand gags move jointly.<br>
The switching mechanism 4 is preferably designed as shown in DE 39 20 822 C2. It is herewith explicitly referred to the contents of this printed publication. Instead of the switching mechanism shown in DE 39 20 822 C2, however, any other switching mechanism can be used, provided that it can be actuated not only by the actuation hand gag 3 but also by the automatic cutout via the coupling member. These two technical functions are of prime importance for the switching mechanism 4.<br>
From the mechanical point of view, the switching mechanism 4 should of course be designed such that it acts on a contact 6, to be described later, as suddenly as possible, and not gradually, in order to prevent an electric arc developing enormous heat during switching. Further, the switching mechanism 4 should be designed such that due to an external release by the<br><br>
automatic cutout, the actuation hand gag 3 is moved at the same time. Thereby an interrupted contact 6 can be recognized from the outside by a fitter or any other operator.<br>
In the shown embodiment, the switching mechanism 4 shows a tappet 4a which, in Fig. 1, projects approximately centrally, seen in the vertical direction, from the built-on module 2 to the rear (to the right in Fig. 1). This tappet 4a projecting to the rear acts on the contact 6, as will be described later. Instead of the single tappet 4a shown in the figures, two or plural tappets can alternatively project to the rear. These plural tappets are preferably arranged in a mirror- or point-symmetric manner.<br>
Referring again to Figs. 1, 4 and 5, it can be recognized that the built-on module 2 comprises a box-shaped housing. At the rear portion (lower portion in Fig. 4), the cross-section of the housing is smaller than at the front portion. Between the front and rear portions, there is a central portion in which the cross-section continuously increases symmetrically. The housing of the built-on module 2 comprises a hollowed housing side part 2' shown in Fig. 4 having circumferential boundary<br>
walls. The switching mechanism 4 and the actuation hand gag 3<br>
* can be pre-assembled to the housing side part 2'. For this<br>
purpose, the hollowed housing side part 2' comprises, at its bottom, a hub 2'c for the actuation hand gag 3, with the hub 2'c being formed integrally with the bottom of the housing side part 2' and the actuation hand gag 3 being adapted to be plugged onto the hub 2'c. Further, plural link axes for mounting levers of the switching mechanism 4 and pins as stops of the levers or as stopping points for springs are integrally formed with the bottom of the housing side part 2'. Moreover, the housing side part 2' comprises the opening 2'd through which the pin or Z-strap can be led in when the additional switch 1 is laterally mounted to the automatic cutout.<br><br>
'Further, the housing side part 2' of the built-on module 2 shown in Fig. 4 comprises stop recesses 2'f in its circumferential boundary walls. A further stop recess is located centrally inside the hub 2'c. The stop recesses 2'f can engage with the latches 2'f which are formed on and integrally with a plate-shaped housing cover 2' (shown in Fig. 5) in a projecting manner. Further the housing cover 2' comprises eyes which are arranged opposite the link axes or pins, respectively, in order to receive them. The housing cover 2' is also provided with the opening 2'd mentioned above, through which the pin or Z-strap can be inserted.<br>
The pre-assembled housing side part 2' to which the switching mechanism 4 and the actuation hand gag 3 are fitted is closed in a locking manner by the housing cover 2' ' by means of the latches 2'f and stop recesses 2'f, with the switching mechanism 4 and the actuation gag 3 being positioned in their operational positions. Instead of the latches and stop recesses, other means for securely connecting the housing parts, such as bolts, rivets and the like can be used as well. Preferably, the housing side part 2' as well as the housing cover 2' are produced of a resin material, such as synthetic resin, for example.<br>
Instead of the asymmetrical division of the housing 2 into the housing side part and the housing cover, the housing can also be divided symmetrically into two identical parts in the vertical direction. A trisection of the housing is also possible, with a central plate which can be pre-assembled and supports the switching mechanism and which is enclosed by housing covers on both sides. The individual housing parts are securely connected with each other by appropriate means, such as locking devices, bolts, rivets, and the like.<br>
It should be noted that the built-on module 2 supports all mechanical components of the auxiliary switch 1. Thus, to repair<br><br>
any mechanical defect that might occur, it is sufficient to replace the built-on module 2 only.<br>
According to Fig. 1, the built-on module 2 is inserted from the front (from the left in Fig. 1) into a recess 5a at the front of a base supporting module 5. The base supporting module 5 receives the electric contact 6 to be switched and the electric connections 51, 52, 53 which are accessible from the front and connected electrically with the contact 6 via bus bars. Thus the base supporting module 5 mainly supports electrical components only. Should an electrical defect occur, it is therefore sufficient as repair work to replace the base supporting module 5 only.<br>
The housing of the base supporting module 5 is mounted with one of its side surfaces to the non-shown automatic cutout from the left or the right and coupled therewith by clamps or similar means, after the built-on module 2 has been inserted into the base supporting module 5. The automatic cutout is locked onto a top hat rail (not shown) mounted to a wall. For this purpose, the rear 5b is provided with a recess corresponding at least to the width of the top hat rail, so that the upper and lower boundary walls of the recess embrace the top hat rail. The automatic cutout, which is locked onto the top hat rail, with the base supporting module 5 fixed thereto serves as a supporter of the entire auxiliary switch 1.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figs. 1 to 3, the connections 51, 52, 53 accessible from the front for the contact 6 are located, seen in the vertical direction, at only one half of the base supporting module 5; in the upper half in Figs. 1 and 2, and in the lower half in Fig. 3. As can clearly be recognized in Figs. 2 and 3, the half comprising the connections 51, 52, 53 lies, with the auxiliary switch 1 being mounted, on the side opposite a power supply bus bar S. It was mentioned in the introductory part of the description that in the various countries, the power supply bus bar S is located either above<br><br>
)r below the top hat rail. For this reason, it is necessary that the base supporting module 5 can be mounted onto the top hat rail in two different positions offset by 180 degrees. It is thereby guaranteed that the connections 51, 52, 53 are located on the half of the base supporting module 5 which is averted from the bus bar S. On the upper and lower side facing the bus bar S, the base supporting module 5 has a recess 5c in which the bus bar S stops in a manner protected from contact when the base supporting module 5 is mounted to the automatic cutout.<br>
In the shown embodiment, there are three connections 51, 52, 53 are provided. To the uppermost connection 51, a bus bar bent in an L-shaped manner is connected and carries a flexible leaf spring at its shorter leg. To the other two connections 52 and 53, bus bars bent in an L-shaped manner are connected, too, which show, at their free ends, elevated contact points, each of which can be made to make electric contact with the leaf spring. In the assembled state, the tappet 4a of the built-on module 2 inserted into the base supporting module 5 through the opening 5d presses against the leaf spring with its free rear end when the switching mecharvism 4 is actuated or released, in order to deflect the leaf spring against its own preload. In doing so, the leaf spring is released from the one contact point and is made to make electric contact with the other contact point. If the switching mechanism 4 is switched back, the leaf spring returns, under its own preload, to its initial position, while getting free from the other contact point and getting into contact with the one contact point.<br>
Even though above the contact was described as a change-over contact, the contact can also be a break or a make contact. Combinations consisting of plural contacts of the mentioned kinds can be used as well.<br>
The built-on module 2 and the base supporting module 5 have approximately the same width, with the built-on module 2 being insertable into the recess 5a of the base supporting module 5 in two different positions offset by 180 degrees. The recess 5a is located vertically centrally in the base supporting module 5, so that the base supporting module 5 can be fitted to the automatic cutout locked onto the top hat rail in a manner offset by 180 degrees, depending on the position of the bus bar, which differs in the various countries, without the recess 5a being located in different vertical positions in the base supporting module 5. It is particularly advantageous if the base supporting module 5 as well as the built-on module 2<br>
are provided with guide means 54, 55, 2a, 2b. As shown in Fig.<br>
»<br>
4, the housing side part 2' of the built-on module 2 comprises grooves 2a, 2b at vertically opposite sides (horizontally in Fig. 4) at the rear portion (lower portion in Fig. 4) having a smaller cross-section. These grooves 2a, 2b can be fitted to webs 54, 55 which are formed in opposite boundary walls of the recess 5a. By this groove/web combination, the built-on module 2 is reliably guided when being inserted from the front into the recess 5a of the base supporting module 5.<br>
As can be recognized in Fig. 5, the housing cover 2' has, at its rear edge (lower edge in Fig. 5), a latch 2'e projecting from the contour of the housing cover 2'. This latch 2'e is engaged with a locking recess 5e shown in Fig. 6 located the bottom of the recess 5a for securely holding the built-on module 2 in the recess 5a. The locking recess 5e is preferably provided on an elevation 5f at the bottom of the recess 5a. Instead of the mentioned locking means, other suitable means for holding the built-on module 2 in the base supporting module 5 in a releasable manner can be provided as well.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of the auxiliary switch 1 just before the assembly for the case in which the bus bar S runs below the non-shown top hat rail, as is the case in Germany. The base supporting module 5 is mounted to<br>
'the automatic cutout locked on the non-shown top hat rail such that its recess 5c faces the bus bar S and the connections 51, 52, 53 are located in the upper half. Prior to this, the built-on module 2 is inserted into the recess 5a such that the actuation hand gag 3 switched downward causes the position OFF of the auxiliary switch 1. Simultaneously, this means that the actuation hand gag 3 switched upward causes the position ON of the auxiliary switch 1.<br>
Fig. 3, on the other hand,, shows the base supporting module 5 mounted to the automatic cutout locked on the non-shown top hat rail in a position offset by 180 degrees compared to Fig.<br>
•<br>
2. In this case, the recess 5o~facing the bus bar S lies in the upper half, whereas the connections 51, 52, 53 are located in the lower half. Prior to this, the built-on module 2 is mounted in the same position as in Fig. 2 in order to guarantee that the actuation hand gag 3 is in the required position.<br>
Even though the embodiment shown in the figures describes an auxiliary switch which can be released externally, the kit-like division can be used in an error signal switch as well as in a combination of an auxiliary switch and an error signal switch. Furthermore, the modular way of assembling can be used in an advantageous manner in a main switch, such as a automatic cutout, for example. As far as automatic cutouts are relate toed, the kit-like division of the switch is not necessarily carried out into a mechanical and an electrical module. Rather can both modules consist of combinations of mechanical and electrical components. In a simplified embodiment, the built-on module only supports the actuation hand gag, whereas the base supporting module receives all the other elements.<br><br><br><br>
