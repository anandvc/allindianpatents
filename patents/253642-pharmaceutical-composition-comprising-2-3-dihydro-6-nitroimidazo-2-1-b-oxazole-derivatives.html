In the present invention, at least one member is preferably used selected from the group consisting of the aforementioned oxazole compounds, optically active isomers thereof, and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Optically active isomers of the oxazole compounds encompass those in the R- and S-configurations.<br>
Examples of pharmacologically acceptable salts include hydrochlorides, citrates, succinates, fumarates, and the like.<br>
A preferred oxazole compound is at least one member<br><br>
selected from the group consisting of compound A, compound H, compound N, and compound Q as well as optically active isomers and pharmacologically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The cellulose compound used in the present pharmaceutical composition is at least one member selected from the group consisting of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate. The addition of such a cellulose compound allows the water solubility of the oxazole compound to be remarkably improved.<br>
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate is a polymer resulting from half-esterifying phthalic acid with hydroxypropyl cellulose. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate is a known compound, and, for example, is available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. under the trade names HP-55, HP-55S and HP-50. Any of these commercial products can be used in the present invention. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate is substituted at the hydroxyl groups with 18 to 24% of methoxy groups; 5 to 10% of hydroxypropoxy groups; and 21 to 35% of carboxybenzoyl groups.<br>
Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate is a polymer resulting from esterifying acetic acid and succinic acid with hydroxypropyl cellulose. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate is a known compound, and, for example, is available from Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. under the trade names AS-L, AS-M, and AS-H. Any of these commercial products can be used in the present invention. Hydroxypropyl .methylcellulose acetate succinate is substituted at the hydroxyl groups with 20 to 26% of methoxy groups; 5 to 10% of hydroxypropyl groups; 5 to 14% of acetyl groups; and 4 to 18% of succinoyl groups.<br>
Among the aforementioned cellulose compounds, those which are soluble in pH 5 to 5.5 Mcllvaine buffer solutions are preferable. Such cellulose compounds include the products HP-55, HP-55S, HP-50, and AS-L.<br>
Among such cellulose compounds, those which are soluble in pH 5 Mcllvaine buffer solutions are especially preferable. Such cellulose compounds include the product HP-50.<br><br>
In order to achieve the excellent effects of the present invention, the proportion of ingredient (II) to ingredient (I) in the present pharmaceutical composition is such that ingredient (II) is typically used in an amount of about 0.5 part by weight or more, preferably about 1 part by weight or more, and more preferably about 1.5 parts by weight or more, per part by weight of ingredient (I) . In consideration of the dosage forms of present pharmaceutical compositions, ingredient (II) is typically used in an amount of about 15 parts by weight or less, preferably about 10 parts by weight or less, more preferably about 5 parts by weight or less, and still more preferably about 3 parts by weight or less, per part by weight of ingredient (I).<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may further include vitamin E.<br>
Examples of forms of vitamin E include natural and synthetic forms of vitamin E, such as d-a-tocopherol, d-5-tocopherol, d-a-tocopherol acetate, d-a-tocopherol succinate, dl-a-tocopherol, dl-a-tocopherol acetate, dl-a-tocopherol succinate, dl-a-tocopherol calcium succinate, dl-a-tocopherol nicotinate, and the like. Preferable forms of vitamin E are dl-a-tocopherol, dl-a-tocopherol acetate, dl-a-tocopherol succinate, and dl-a-tocopherol nicotinate; and dl-a-tocopherol is especially preferable.<br>
The present pharmaceutical composition preferably includes vitamin E. The addition of vitamin E allows the stability of the pharmaceutical composition to be remarkably improved. When compounds with similar antioxidant effects to vitamin E are used instead of vitamin E, such as dibutylhydroxytoluene, butylhydroxyanisole, soybean lecithin, ascorbyl palmitate, cysteine hydrochloride, ascorbic acid, citric acid, erythorbic acid, sodium nitrite, sodium sulfite, sodium thioglycolate, sodium thiomalate, and the like, the stability of the pharmaceutical composition cannot be remarkably improved, which is a fact discovered by the present inventors.<br>
The addition of such vitamin E, particularly <br>
dl-a-<br><br>
tocopherol, remarkably enhances the stability of the pharmaceutical composition without adversely affecting the water solubility of the oxazole compound.<br>
The amount of vitamin E added to the pharmaceutical composition is usually from about 0.001 to about 1 part by weight, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.8 part by weight, and more preferably from about 0.03 to about 0.5 part by weight, per part by weight of ingredient (I).<br>

The solubilities of the pharmaceutical compositions obtained in Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples 1 to 3 were examined as follows.<br>
First, 100 ml of a 0.3 wt% aqueous sodium lauryl sulfate solution was poured into a 100 ml beaker, and was stirred with a magnetic stirrer (number of revolutions: 500 rpm). Separately, one of each of the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions was weig'hed to contain 5 mg of compound A, and was placed into an agate mortar, after which a few ml of the test solution in the beaker was added to the pharmaceutical composition. After dispersion for about 1 minute, the mixture was poured into the beaker. After 5, 10 and 20 minutes from pouring the dispersion in the beaker, 6 ml of the solution in the beaker was sampled, and was filtered through a membrane filter with a pore diameter of 0.5 µm or less. The initial 2 ml of each filtrate was removed, and the subsequent 4 ml was used as a sample solution.<br>
The absorbance of each sample solution at a wavelength of 335 nm was measured by UV visible absorbance spectroscopy using a 10 mm long cell.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 1.<br>
