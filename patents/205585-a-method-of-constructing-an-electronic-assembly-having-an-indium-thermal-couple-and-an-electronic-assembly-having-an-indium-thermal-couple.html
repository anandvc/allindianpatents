"A METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING AN ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY HAVING AN INDIUM THERMAL COUPLE AND AN ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY HAVING AN INDIUM THERMAL COUPLE"<br>
INTEL CORPORATION, a Delaware Corporation, 2200 Mission College Boulevard, Santa Clara, California 95052, United States of America<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of   This invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
A METHOD OF CONSTRUCTING AN ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY HAVING AN INDIUM THERMAL COUPLE AND AN ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLY HAVING AN INDIUM THERMAL COUPLE<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1). Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a method of constructing an electronic assembly and to an electronic assembly which may be made according to the method of the invention.<br>
2). Discussion of Related Art<br>
Integrated circuits are formed on semiconductor wafers. The wafers are then sawed into semiconductor chips.  Each semiconductor chip is then mounted to a package substrate.  An integrated circuit within the semiconductor chip can be powered up and data signals can be sent to and received from the integrated circuit via the package substrate.<br>
When the integrated circuit is powered up, heat is generated on the semiconductor chip which could cause destruction of the integrated circuit if the heat is not transferred away.  A thermally conductive plate is often located next to the semiconductor chip.  A thermally conductive grease may be located between the semiconductor chip and the thermally conductive plate.  The thermally conductive grease contacts the semiconductor chip and the thermally conductive plate on opposing sides and acts as a thermal couple between the semiconductor chip and the thermally conductive plate.  Heat can then be transferred from the semiconductor chip through the grease to the thermally conductive plate, from where heat can be transferred to a heat sink or other device and be convected into the ambient.<br>
The use of a grease as a thermal couple is often unsuitable for high power applications.  A thermally conductive grease does not transfer a sufficient amount of heat when a large amount of heat is generated on a semiconductor chip. One reason why a thermally conductive grease is not a good conductor of heat is because there<br><br>
  we no metals in a thermally conductive grease.   Metals, on the other hand, are usually also electrically conductive. The use of a metal as a thermal couple is therefore usually avoided because an electrically conductive metal may cause shorting between components of the semiconductor chip or the package substrate.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of the invention a method of constructing an electronic assembly is provided.  The electronic assembly is constructed from a semiconductor package including a package substrate and a semiconductor chip mounted to the package substrate, a thermally conductive member, and a substance including indium.   The method comprises securing the thermally conductive     member and the semiconductor package in a selected orientation relative to one another with the thermally conductive member on a side of the semiconductor chip opposing the package substrate and with the substance located between the semiconductor chip and at least a portion of the thermally conductive member.  The substance is thermally coupled to the semiconductor chip on one side and thermally coupled to the portion of the thermally conductive member on an opposing side.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 to Figure 11 of the accompanying drawings illustrate a method of constructing an electronic assembly.  An indium containing alloy is located within a recess within a lid. The indium containing alloy is then heated which causes undesirable voids to form therein due to reaction between the alloy and the material of the lid. The voids are massaged out by heating the alloy and directing a jet of air onto the alloy.  A sheet of indium, having a higher melting temperature than the alloy, is used to prevent splattering of the alloy when the jet of air<br><br>
 mpinges thereon.  The cap and the alloy are then assembled together with a semiconductor package in an electronic assembly.  The alloy, primarily because of the use of indium, has good thermal conductivity.  The alloy is an electric insulator which ensures that components of the semiconductor package are electrically isolated from one another.  The alloy does not break through into the material of a package substrate of the semiconductor package. The alloy also has a relatively low melting temperature which makes it possible to melt the alloy without causing destruction of an integrated circuit in a semiconductor chip of the semiconductor package. Regardless thereof that the alloy causes voids when being heated, the voids are massaged away from a heat conducting portion of the alloy.<br>
Figure 1 of the accompanying drawings illustrates a thermally conductive lid 10 which is used in constructing an electronic assembly according to the invention. The lid 10 may be made of a material such as copper having good thermal conductivity. The lid 10 includes a central portion 12 and four sidewalls 14. A recess 16 is defined above the central portion 12 within the sidewalls 14.<br>
The lid 10 is cleaned and then, as shown in Figure 2 a first sheet 18 of a first alloy is inserted into the recess 16. The first sheet 18 is sized to fit between the sidewalls 14 and almost fills the recess 16. The first alloy preferably includes mass ratios of 44.7% bismuth, 22.6% lead, 19.1% indium, 8.3% tin, and 5.3% cadmium.  A sheet of an alloy of this kind can be obtained from Indium Corporation of America in Utica, New York. The choice and characteristics of such an alloy will be evident from the description that follows.<br>
The lid 10 and the first sheet 18 are then heated to above the melting temperature of about 115° C of the first alloy to cause melting of the first alloy 18 as shown in Figure 3. The indium in the first alloy 18 reacts with the copper of the lid 10 to cause bubbles or voids 20 within the first alloy 18. Voids within the first alloy 18 are undesirable for heat conduction purposes. The number of voids 20 are however much fewer than when pure indium is used instead of the alloy 18.<br>
The first alloy 18 is then allowed to cool to cause solidification thereof as shown in Figure 4. The voids 20 are then trapped within the solidified first alloy 18.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, a second sheet 22 is then located on top of the second alloy 18. The second sheet 22 is typically about 2 mm thick and is preferably made of pure indium. The second sheet 22 is located up to a rim 24 of the lid 10.<br>
As shown in Figure 6, infrared radiation 26 is then used to heat the lid 10<br><br>
-'from below.  Heat is transferred from the lid 10 to the first alloy 18.  The combination of the lid 10, the first alloy, and the second sheet 22 is heated to a temperature which is above the melting temperature of 115° C of the first alloy 18. The substantially pure indium of the second sheet 22 has a melting point of about 135° C. The combination of the cap 10, the first alloy 18, and the second sheet 22 is heated to a temperature which is below the 135° C melting point of the second sheet 22. The first alloy 18 is thereby melted but the second sheet 22 remains solid.  The lower melting point of the first alloy 18, when compared to the substantially pure indium of the second sheet 22, is primarily due to the inclusion of the lead within the first alloy 18. The lead is preferably present between 0.5% and 30% by mass.<br>
A nozzle 28 is used to direct a jet of air 30 onto a central portion of the second sheet 22. The jet of air 30 impinges at substantially right angles onto the second sheet 22 and spreads from a central portion of the second sheet 22 outwardly. Because of deflection of the jet of air 30, a force is created on the second sheet 22 from where the force transferred to the first alloy 18. The force created by the air massages the voids 20 outwardly away from a central portion 32 of the first alloy 18. Most of the voids 20 escape from between an interface between the rim 24 and an edge of the second sheet 22. Some voids 20 may still remain in outer portions of the first alloy 18. The central portion 32 of the first alloy 18 is however substantially or completely free of voids. The first alloy 18 is then allowed to cool to cause solidification thereof as shown in Figure 7. Some voids 20 may be located in outer regions of the solidified first alloy 18. The second sheet 22 is located on the solidified second alloy 18.<br>
Figure 8 illustrates the cap 10, including the first alloy 18 and the second sheet 22 which is inverted, and a semiconductor package 34 which is also used for constructing an electronic assembly according to an embodiment of the invention. The semiconductor package includes a package substrate 38 and a semiconductor chip 40.<br>
The package substrate 38 is at least partially made of an dielectric material. The dielectric material may for example be a resin such as bismateinite triazine resin which forms a surface thereof. An array of solder balls in the form of a ball grid array 42 is located on a lower surface of the package substrate 38.<br>
The semiconductor chip 40 is typically made of a semiconductor material such as silicon and has an integrated circuit (not shown) formed therein.  An array<br><br>
a solder bumps 44 are formed on an upper surface of the semiconductor chip 40   containing the integrated circuit and the semiconductor chip 40 is then flipped as shown in Figure 8 so that the solder bumps 44 are at the bottom according to a process commonly referred to as "controlled collapse chip connect" (C4).  The semiconductor chip 40 is located on an upper surface of the package substrate 38 with the solder bumps 44 located between the package substrate 38 and the semiconductor chip 40. The semiconductor package 34 is then heated and allowed to cool, thereby causing attachment of the other bumps 44 to the package substrate 38.<br>
A third sheet 50 of a second alloy is located over the semiconductor chip 40.<br>
The composition of the second alloy of the third sheet 50 may be the same as the<br>
composition of the first alloy 18.	<br>
As shown in Figure 9, a lower surface the second sheet 22 is then brought into contact with an upper surface of the third sheet 50 so that the combination of the second sheet 22, the first alloy 18, and the lid 10 rests on the third sheet 50.<br>
The combination shown in Figure 9 is then heated to a temperature above 135° C. The first and second alloys 18 and 50 and the second sheet 26 melt at a temperature above 135° C.  The combination shown in Figure 9 is never heated to a temperature above 150° C, so as to avoid destruction of an integrated circuit in the semiconductor chip 40. When the first and second alloys 18 and 50 and the second sheet 22 melt, the lid 10 drops onto the package substrate 38 is shown in Figure 10. The melted material of the third sheet 50 acts as a wetting layer to ensure proper thermal coupling onto an upper surface of the semiconductor chip 40.  A melted mixture 52 of the first and second alloys 18 and 50 and the indium of the second sheet 26 fill an entire area between the semiconductor chip 40 and the central portion 12 of the lid 10. The melted mixture 52 is therefore in contact with an upper surface of the semiconductor chip 40 and a lower surface of the central portion 12 of the lid 10.<br>
Because of the choice of the materials of the melted mixture 52, the mixture 52 does not break into the dielectric material of the package substrate 38 as may happen if another metal is used instead of the mixture 52.<br>
The combination as shown in Figure 10 is then allowed to cool to cause solidification of the mixture 52 as shown in Figure 11. An epoxy bead 54 is then located within a filleted interface between the lid 10 and the package substrate 38.<br><br>
the epoxy bead 52 secures the lid 10 to the package substrate 38, thereby finalizing construction of an electronic assembly 60.<br>
The mixture 52 provides an efficient thermal coupling between the semiconductor chip 40 and the lid 10, primarily because of the use of a metal in the form of indium in the mixture 52.  The indium in the mixture 52 is preferably at least 1% by mass to provide an efficient thermal couple, although a higher percentage such as at least 10% is a much better thermal conductor. The mixture, including the indium, is an electric insulator, so that components of the semiconductor package 34, for example the solder bumps 44 or electric traces on the package substrate 38, are electrically isolated from one another even if the mixture 52 contacts these components.  It should be noted that a central portion 3?, through which heat is conducted from the semiconductor chip 40 to the lid 10, is   substantially free of voids, as such ensuring that there is an efficient heat conduction path between the semiconductor chip 40 and the lid 10.<br>
While certain exemplary embodiments have been described and shown in the accompanying drawings, it is to be understood that such embodiments are merely illustrative and not restrictive of the current invention, and that this invention is not restricted to the specific constructions and arrangements shown and described since modifications may occur to those ordinarily skilled in the art.<br><br>
