				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PLUG-TYPE CONNECTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to the field of<br>
electrical plug-type connections. It relates to a plug-<br>
type connection in accordance with the preamble of<br>
 claim 1.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In robot technology, in particular in industrial<br>
 welding robots, comparatively high currents in the<br>
region of 100 A or more need to be guided from the base<br>
of the robots along the robot arm to the apparatuses<br>
fitted at the end of the robot arm (welding tools<br>
etc.) For this purpose, wiring with the corresponding<br>
conductor cross sections (typically 10-50 mm2) are used<br>
which are guided along the robot arm and are equipped<br>
with corresponding plug-type connections at the joints<br>
(in particular at the base and at the end of the arm).<br>
For the application with welding robots, the applicant<br>
already markets plug-type connections from the TSB/TSS<br>
series (primary circuit plug-type connectors for<br>
welding transformers), in which individual contacts in<br>
the form of sockets and corresponding pins are<br>
 electrically connected to the cable ends, from which<br>
the insulation has been stripped, by means of a screw-<br>
type or crimping connection and are then introduced<br>
into corresponding (cylindrical) insulating housings<br>
(see in this regard the catalog MC Roboticline 07.2001<br>
 (ex Ho7b) , 2001; pages 18, 19 and 31). In accordance<br>
with the assembly instructions MA 200, special tools<br>
are required for this purpose in order to press the<br>
individual contacts, which are resting on the cable<br><br>
ends, into the bores provided for this purpose in the<br>
insulating housings and to press them out again, if<br>
necessary, in the event of repair work (pages 41-44 of<br>
the abovementioned catalog).<br>
The known plug-type connections for the primary circuit<br>
of welding transformers in the welding robots sector<br>
have proven to be successful in practice. However,<br>
special tools (pin introduction tool, pin removal tool,<br>
socket introduction tool, socket removal tool etc.) are<br>
required for introducing and removing the individual<br>
contacts, and these tools not only need to be kept at<br>
the assembly/dismantling location, but also require<br>
special handling of the insulating housings when they<br>
are used. Since, in the case of welding robots, the<br>
associated cables are subject to pulse-like mechanical<br>
loads owing to the pulse-like welding currents and the<br>
associated magnetic fields, the cables need to be<br>
replaced more often during continuous operation of the<br>
robots in an industrial environment. In this case it is<br>
desirable for such a replacement to be capable of being<br>
carried out simply and quickly and also under<br>
restricted space conditions.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of new robot types it is now<br>
practice to lay the supply and control cables or cable<br>
harnesses, which until now have been guided on the<br>
outside along the robot arms, in the interior of the<br>
arms in order to prevent possible collisions between<br>
the cable harnesses and objects arranged in the<br>
vicinity of the swiveling range of the robot and<br>
therefore also to simplify programming. By laying the<br>
cables in the interior of the robot arm, simplified<br>
assembly/dismantling of the plug-type connections<br>
becomes even more important under restricted conditions<br>
as well.<br><br>
Furthermore, the plug-type connections should be as<br>
tight against one another as possible in a simple<br>
manner, both in the region of contact-making in the<br>
plugged-in state and in the region of the cable entry<br>
point (protection rating IP67) .<br>
Furthermore it is desirable to be able to secure the<br>
plug-type connection in the plugged-in state against<br>
unintentionally becoming unplugged in a simple manner<br>
and to be able to fix the plug-type connection at the<br>
use location in a simple manner.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the invention is to specify a plug-type<br>
connection for the described use which avoids the<br>
disadvantages of previous plug-type connections and can<br>
be assembled and dismantled simply and quickly without<br>
special aids and also under restricted spatial<br>
 conditions.<br>
The object is achieved by the entirety of the features<br>
of claim 1. The essence of the invention consists in,<br>
in the case of the plug-type connection according to<br>
the invention, individual contact elements, which are<br>
conductively connected to the cables, being plugged<br>
into an insulating plug housing and/or an insulating<br>
socket housing so as to latch in and being held<br>
replaceably in the plug housing and socket housing,<br>
respectively, wherein the latching-in of the contact<br>
elements in the housings is achieved by elastic<br>
deformation of the housings, and wherein the housings<br>
are made from a material with a hardness which makes it<br>
possible for the contact elements to be plugged in and<br>
replaced without the aid of tools. The material of the<br>
housings is therefore "soft" enough for the individual<br>
contacts, which are located at the cable ends and are<br>
equipped with latching apparatuses, to be capable of<br><br>
being pressed into the bores provided for this purpose<br>
in the housings and possibly also withdrawn again<br>
without the use of special tools, i.e. only by hand,<br>
counter to a certain resistance. The "softness" of the<br>
material in this case depends on the design of the<br>
latching mechanism which also determines the level of<br>
elastic deformation required.<br>
In accordance with a configuration of the invention,<br>
 the plug housing and/or the socket housing are designed<br>
to be integral and are made from a thermoplastic<br>
elastomer (TPE).<br>
A further configuration of the invention is<br>
 characterized by the fact that the contact elements<br>
are arranged in the plug housing and/or the socket<br>
housing parallel next to one another in one plane, and<br>
in that in each case three contact elements are<br>
arranged next to one another in the housings.<br>
With respect to the mechanical stability and<br>
sealtightness, it is particularly advantageous if cable<br>
sleeves for accommodating the ends of the cables<br>
connected to the contact elements are arranged on the<br>
plug housing and/or socket housing, and if releasable<br>
fastening means are provided, by means of which the<br>
cables can be fixed in the cable sleeves.<br>
Preferably, the fastening means each comprise a cable<br>
 strain-relief clamp, which fixedly clamps the cables in<br>
the cable sleeves as a result of external pressure on<br>
the cable sleeves, wherein the cable strain-relief<br>
clamps each comprise an upper part and a lower part,<br>
which surround the cable sleeves on opposite sides and<br>
 can be connected to one another, and wherein the cable<br>
sleeves are in the form of hollow cylinders which are<br>
arranged next to one another parallel at a distance,<br>
and the upper part and the lower part of the cable<br><br>
strain-relief clamps are each in the form of a bar,<br>
which extends transversely over the cable sleeves and<br>
is equipped, on the side facing the cable sleeves, with<br>
cutouts so as to conform to the cable sleeves.<br>
In particular, the upper and lower parts of the cable<br>
strain-relief clamps have mutually aligned bores in<br>
order for them to be connected to one another, wherein<br>
the upper and lower parts of the cable strain-relief<br>
clamps are connected to one another by means of<br>
fastening screws, which extend through the bores, and<br>
exert external pressure on the cable sleeves.<br>
Another configuration is characterized by the fact that<br>
 the cable strain-relief clamps and therefore the entire<br>
plug-type connection is fixedly screwed by means of the<br>
fastening screws on a base.<br>
A further configuration of the invention is<br>
 characterized by the fact that the plug housing and the<br>
socket housing can be secured against the plug-type<br>
connection being pulled apart from one another by means<br>
of a securing clip, which, in the plugged-together<br>
state of the plug-type connection, can be inserted into<br>
 the housings, wherein the securing clip preferably<br>
comprises an elongate base plate, from which pins<br>
protrude in perpendicular fashion in one direction at<br>
the ends, and through-bores, into which the securing<br>
clip with the pins can be plugged, are provided in the<br>
 housings.<br>
It is particularly favorable for the application if the<br>
pins are provided with slots at the free ends and have<br>
latching heads, with which they latch in at the outlet<br>
of the through-bores, and if recessed grips are<br>
integrally formed on the securing clip, by means of<br>
which recessed grips the securing clip can be drawn out<br>
of the housings without the use of a tool. In<br><br>
particular, the securing clip is designed to be<br>
integral and is produced as an injection molded part<br>
from a plastic.<br>
 The cable strain-relief clamps are preferably produced<br>
from a plastic, in particular a fiber-reinforced<br>
polyamide.<br>
In order to achieve sealing and clamping which is<br>
improved further still, it is advantageous if the cable<br>
sleeves taper slightly conically inwards towards the<br>
outlet, and if the cutouts are likewise slightly<br>
conical.<br>
In accordance with a further configuration of the<br>
invention, slightly conical socket receptacle sections,<br>
which are positioned next to one another at a distance<br>
and parallel and receive the contact sockets of the<br>
female contact elements, are arranged on the socket<br>
housing; corresponding contact protection means are<br>
arranged on the plug housing which receives the socket<br>
receptacle sections if the plug-type connection has<br>
been plugged together. Preferably in this case sealing<br>
beads are formed on the outside on the socket<br>
receptacle sections in order to increase the<br>
sealtightness.<br>
Another configuration is characterized by the fact that<br>
the housings each have connection chambers for<br>
 receiving the contact elements, that in each case one<br>
latching tab with a latching groove, which is<br>
positioned behind the latter in the plug-in direction,<br>
is formed in the connection chambers, and that in each<br>
case one holding groove and a latching collar is<br>
 provided on the contact elements so as to interact with<br>
the latching tab and the latching groove. In order to<br>
facilitate the insertion process, in this case the<br><br>
latching collar has a sloping flank on the plug-in<br>
side.<br>
In order to further improve handling, recessed grips<br>
 for drawing the housings apart from one another can be<br>
formed on the housings.<br>
In order to make it possible to use the plug-type<br>
connection in cables with different outer diameters, it<br>
is advantageous if the cable sleeves are split into two<br>
sections, which are arranged one behind the other in<br>
the plug-in direction, wherein the inner diameter of<br>
the section which is positioned further towards the<br>
outside is greater than the inner diameter of the other<br>
 section.<br>
In accordance with another configuration, the upper<br>
part and the lower part of the cable strain-relief<br>
clamps are guided with respect to one another by means<br>
of guide pins, wherein, preferably, the guide pins are<br>
coded for the purpose of clear orientation of the parts<br>
with respect to one another.<br>
Furthermore, it is advantageous if mutually fitting<br>
coding elements are provided on the strain-relief clamp<br>
and on the associated plug or socket housing and ensure<br>
a clear orientation of the strain-relief clamp with<br>
respect to the associated plug or socket housing.<br>

APPROACHES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE INVENTION<br><br>
Figure 1 reproduces a perspective illustration of a<br>
plugged-together plug-type connection (without the<br>
cables connected to the contact elements) in accordance<br>
with a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention.<br>
In the example, the plug-type connection 10 is designed<br>
for connecting three cable pairs, with the connection<br>
of two cable pairs or more than three cable pairs<br>
likewise being conceivable. In the example, the plug-<br>
type connection 10 comprises an insulating plug housing<br>
11 (illustrated individually in figures 5 and 6) , an<br>
insulating socket housing 12 (illustrated individually<br>
in figures 3 and 4), two cable strain-relief clamps 13<br>
and 14, and a securing clip 15, which secures the<br>
plugged-together housings 11, 12 against<br>
unintentionally becoming unplugged. All of parts 11,<br>
. . , 15 of the plug-type connection 10 are made from a<br>
plastic. The housings 11, 12 are preferably produced<br>
from a thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), whose hardness is<br>
set such that the contact elements shown in figures 7<br>
and 8 can be pressed into the housings 11, 12, but also<br>
withdrawn again (on the cables) without special aids<br>
(tools). Figure 2 shows the plugged-together plug-type<br>
connection 10 in a plan view from above.<br>
 The cable strain-relief clamps 13, 14 each comprise an<br>
upper part (figure 12) and a lower part (figure 13),<br>
which can be connected to one another by means of<br>
fastening screws 18, 19 in order to exert the necessary<br>
external pressure on the parts of the housing lying<br>
therebetween (cable sleeves 27 and 45, respectively).<br>
The cable strain-relief clamps 13, 14 are preferably<br>
produced from a fiber-reinforced polyamide in order to<br>
achieve the required mechanical strength.<br>
 The socket housing 12 illustrated in figures 3 and 4 is<br>
designed to be integral. It comprises a central part<br>
20, which extends transversely with respect to the<br>
plug-in direction and through which two vertical<br><br>
through-bores 24 and 25 run next to one another, into<br>
which bores the securing clip 15 can be plugged with<br>
two of its four pins (69, 70, 75, 76 in figure 10) .<br>
Three socket chambers 21, .., 23, which extend parallel<br>
to one another in the plug-in direction and lie in one<br>
plane, are integrally formed on the central part 20,<br>
wherein in each case one connection chamber 32, which<br>
ends at the front in a socket receptacle section 30 and<br>
at the rear in a cable sleeve 27, runs through said<br>
socket chambers 21, .., 23. Recessed grips 28 are<br>
integrally formed at the lateral ends of the central<br>
part 20, on which recessed grips 28 the hand can be<br>
placed when unplugging the plug-type connection 10. The<br>
arrangement of the individual plug-type connections in<br>
one plane means a particularly flat design of the plug-<br>
type connection, which is advantageous when integrating<br>
the associated cables in the robots.<br>
The individually shaped cable sleeves 27, which are<br>
spaced apart from one other, are designed to be<br>
cylindrical on the outside. On the inside, they are<br>
split into two sections 33, 34, which are arranged<br>
behind one another in the plug-in direction, wherein<br>
the outer section 34 has a greater inner diameter than<br>
 the section 33 lying further inwards. The two sections<br>
33, 34 with the different inner diameters make it<br>
possible to receive cables with different outer<br>
diameters (different sheath designs) given the same<br>
conductor cross section. It is thus conceivable, for<br>
example, to connect cables with a conductor cross<br>
section of 35 mm2 which have an outer diameter of<br>
between 11 and 17 mm. The same metal parts (contact<br>
elements 52, 60 from figures 7 and 8) are used for all<br>
of these cables. In the sections 33, 34, the cable<br>
 sleeves 27 are each tapered slightly conically towards<br>
the outside in terms of their inner diameter and have<br>
concentric ribbing on the inner wall, which ribbing<br>
assists both the mechanical fixing and the sealing of<br><br>
the cable in the cable sleeve 27. In each case one<br>
peripheral bead 26 is integrally formed at the outer<br>
ends of the cable sleeves 27, which peripheral bead 26<br>
ensures the fit of the cable strain-relief clamp 14 on<br>
the cable sleeves 27.<br>
The individually shaped socket receptacle sections 30,<br>
which are spaced apart from one another, taper slightly<br>
conically towards the front on the outside. When the<br>
 plug-type connection 10 is plugged together, they are<br>
plugged into corresponding contact protection means 67<br>
in the plug housing 11 (figure 5) . The socket<br>
receptacle sections 30 receive the contact sockets (53)<br>
of the female contact elements 52 (figure 7). Two<br>
 sealing beads 29, 31, which are used for sealing the<br>
plug-type connection between the two housings 11 and<br>
12, are formed on the socket receptacle sections 30 in<br>
such a way that they are spaced apart axially on the<br>
outside.<br>
The connection chambers 32 in the socket housing 12 are<br>
provided for receiving the female contact elements 52<br>
shown in figure 7. For this purpose, in each case one<br>
inwardly projecting latching tab 35 with a latching<br>
 groove 36, which lies behind said latching tab 35 in<br>
the plug-in direction, is formed in the connection<br>
chambers 32, which latching tabs interact with a<br>
matching holding groove 58 and a matching latching<br>
collar 57 on the contact element 52. In order to make<br>
 it easier to plug the contact element 52 into the<br>
connection chamber 32 of the socket housing 12, the<br>
latching collar 57 of the contact element 52 has a<br>
sloping flank on the plug-in side. In order to make it<br>
easier for the contact element 52 to be withdrawn from<br>
 the connection chamber 32, the side walls of the<br>
holding groove 58 can be designed to be slightly<br>
sloping.<br><br>
If the contact element 52 with the contact socket 53<br>
leading is introduced into the connection chamber 32<br>
from the rear through the cable sleeve 27, it can<br>
initially be pushed in, without any considerable<br>
resistance, until it hits the rear rim of the latching<br>
tab 35 with the latching collar 57. When it is pushed<br>
in further assisted by the sloping flank on the<br>
latching collar 57, the latching tab 35 is pressed<br>
elastically radially outwards until it snaps back<br>
completely into the holding groove 58 behind the<br>
latching collar 57 if, at the same time, the latching<br>
collar 57 latches into the latching groove 36. The<br>
contact socket 53 of the contact element 52 is then<br>
resting in the socket area 37 provided for this purpose<br>
of the socket housing 12 and is covered at the front by<br>
a contact protection means 47 so as to prevent<br>
unintentional contact being made. If the contact<br>
element 52 has reached this end position, the cable<br>
reaches with its sheath into the cable sleeve 27 and<br>
can be fixed there by means of the cable strain-relief<br>
clamp 14 (cables 97, 98 in figure 16).<br>
Similar conditions prevail in the case of the plug<br>
housing 11 shown in figures 5 and 6. The plug housing<br>
11 is designed to be integral. It comprises three plug<br>
chambers 39, .., 41, which extend parallel to one<br>
another in the plug-in direction and lie in one plane<br>
and through which in each case one connection chamber<br>
48 runs, which ends at the front in a common plug<br>
receptacle section 38 and at the rear in each case in a<br>
cable sleeve 45. Likewise recessed grips 46 are<br>
integrally formed at the lateral ends of the plug<br>
housing 11, with it being possible for the hand to be<br>
placed on said recessed grips 46 when the plug-type<br>
 connection 10 is unplugged.<br>
The individually shaped cable sleeves 45, which are<br>
spaced apart from one another, are designed to be<br><br><br>
cylindrical on the outside on the socket housing 12 in<br>
the same way as the cable sleeves 27 and on the inside<br>
are split into two sections 33, 34, which are arranged<br>
behind one another in the plug-in direction, with<br>
concentric ribbing. Likewise, a peripheral bead 44,<br>
which secures the fit of the cable strain-relief clamp<br>
13 on the cable sleeve 45, is integrally formed on the<br>
outer ends of the cable sleeves 45.<br>
The connection chambers 48 in the plug housing 11 are<br>
provided for receiving the male contact elements 60<br>
shown in figure 8. For this purpose, in each case one<br>
inwardly projecting latching tab 4 9 with a latching<br>
groove 50 lying behind it in the plug-in direction is<br>
 formed in the connection chambers 48, which latching<br>
tabs interact with a matching holding groove 65 and a<br>
matching latching collar 64 on the contact element 60.<br>
In order to make it easier to plug the contact element<br>
60 into the connection chamber 48 of the plug housing<br>
11, the latching collar 64 of the contact element 60<br>
also has a sloping flank on the plug-in side. In order<br>
to make it easier to withdraw the contact element 60<br>
from the connection chamber 48, the side walls of the<br>
holding groove 65 can also be designed to be slightly<br>
 sloping here.<br>
If the contact element 60 with the pin 63 leading is<br>
inserted into the connection chamber 4 8 from the rear<br>
through the cable sleeve 45, initially it can be pushed<br>
in, without any considerable resistance, until it hits<br>
the rear rim of the latching tab 49 with the latching<br>
collar 64. When it is pushed in further assisted by the<br>
sloping flank on the latching collar 64, the latching<br>
tab 49 is pressed elastically radially outwards until<br>
it snaps back completely into the holding groove 65<br>
behind the latching collar 64 if, at the same time, the<br>
latching collar 64 latches into the latching groove 50.<br>
The pin 63 of the contact element 60 then protrudes<br><br>
into the plug area 51 of the plug housing 11 provided<br>
for this purpose and is surrounded by the socket<br>
receptacle section 30 of the socket housing 12 if the<br>
plug-type connection 10 has been plugged together. If<br>
the contact element 60 has reached this end position,<br>
the cable reaches with its sheath in the cable sleeve<br>
4 5 and can be fixed there by means of the cable strain-<br>
relief clamp 13. The slightly conical embodiment of the<br>
plug area 51 and the socket receptacle section 30 and<br>
the sealing beads 29, 31 ensures that, in the plugged-<br>
in state, a sealtightness in accordance with IP67 is<br>
achieved at this point (see figure 16).<br>
The preferred female contact element 52 shown in<br>
figure 7 comprises, in a manner known per se, a contact<br>
socket 53 with a blind bore 55 and a shoulder 59, onto<br>
which a press bush 54 is pushed and fixedly soldered.<br>
The cable end with the exposed conductor is pushed into<br>
the press bush 54 and compressed. An annular groove 56<br>
for receiving a multi-contact contact lamination, which<br>
is bent in annular fashion, is provided in the blind<br>
bore 55, wherein the multi-contact contact lamination<br>
makes the electrical contact with the inserted pin 63<br>
of the male contact element 60 from figure 8. The male<br>
contact element 60 preferably comprises a contact plug<br>
61 with a shoulder 66 arranged at the rear, onto which<br>
a press bush 62 is pushed and fixedly soldered. The<br>
cable is in this case fitted in the same way as in the<br>
case of the contact element 52 in figure 7.<br>
As has already been mentioned further above, the cable<br>
strain-relief clamps 13, 14 each comprise an upper part<br>
16 (figure 12) and a lower part 17 (figure 13), which<br>
surround the cable sleeves 27 and 45, respectively, on<br>
opposite sides and can be connected to one another. The<br>
upper part 16 and the lower part 17 of the cable<br>
strain-relief clamps 13, 14 are each in the form of a<br>
bar, which extends transversely over the cable sleeves<br><br>
27, 45 and is equipped, on the side facing the cable<br>
sleeves 27, 45, with approximately semicylindrical<br>
cutouts 77, .., 79 and 84, .., 86, respectively, so as<br>
to conform to the cable sleeves 27, 45. The cutouts<br>
77, .., 79 and 84, .., 86, respectively, are preferably<br>
designed to be slightly conical in order to achieve<br>
improved clamping and sealtightness in accordance with<br>
IP67 in interaction with the slightly conical sections<br>
33, 34 in the cable sleeves 27, 45.<br>
The upper and lower parts 16, 17 of the cable strain-<br>
relief clamps 13, 14 have mutually aligned bores 82, 83<br>
and 89, 90, respectively, so as to connect them to one<br>
another. Fastening screws 18, 19 are plugged through<br>
these bores 82, 83 and 89, 90, respectively, in order<br>
to connect the two parts 16, 17 to one another and to<br>
exert external pressure on the cable sleeves 27, 45.<br>
For this purpose, corresponding nuts can be arranged on<br>
the opposite side. However, it is also possible to<br>
 fixedly screw the cable strain-relief clamps 13, 14 and<br>
therefore the entire plug-type connection 10 on a base<br>
(mounting plate or the like) by means of the fastening<br>
screws 18, 19. In addition, in order to align the clamp<br>
parts, guide pins 80, 81 can be provided on the upper<br>
part 16 and/or lower part 17, which guide pins 80, 81<br>
enter, in guiding fashion, corresponding bores 87, 88<br>
on the lower part 17 and/or upper part 16.<br>
It is furthermore possible to secure the plug housing<br>
11 and the socket housing 12 by means of a securing<br>
clip 15 which can be plugged in so as to prevent the<br>
plug-type connection 10 from being drawn apart. The<br>
securing clip suitable for this purpose (figures 9-11)<br>
comprises an elongate base plate 68, from which pins<br>
 69, 70 and 75, 76 protrude perpendicularly at the ends<br>
in one direction in pairs. Corresponding vertical<br>
through-bores 24, 25 and 42, 43, respectively, are<br>
provided in the housings 11, 12, into which through-<br><br>
bores the securing clip 15 can be plugged with the pins<br>
69, 70 and 75, 76, respectively.<br>
The pins 69, 70, 75, 76 are provided with slots at<br>
their free ends and have latching heads, with which<br>
they latch in at the outlet of the through-bores 24, 25<br>
and 42, 43, respectively. Advantageously, recessed<br>
grips 73, 74 are integrally formed laterally on the<br>
securing clip 15, by means of which recessed grips 73,<br>
74 the securing clip 15 can be withdrawn from the<br>
housings 11, 12 without the use of a tool. The securing<br>
clip 15 is preferably designed to be integral and is<br>
produced as an injection-molded part from a plastic.<br>
In order to ensure clear assignment of the two parts of<br>
the strain-relief clamps with respect to one another<br>
and furthermore to make it possible to clearly<br>
orientate the strain-relief clamps relative to the plug<br>
housing or socket housing, coding means can be arranged<br>
on the parts. Examples of such coding means are<br>
illustrated in figures 14 and 15. The cable strain-<br>
relief clamp from figure 14 has, similarly to<br>
figures 12 and 13, an upper part 16' and a lower part<br>
17', which together form the clamp. Two hexagonal<br>
openings 95, 96 can be seen on the upper side of the<br>
lower part 17', which hexagonal openings 95, 96 receive<br>
corresponding nuts if the two parts are screwed to one<br>
another. The two parts 16', 17' are guided with respect<br>
to one another by guide pins 80', 81', which in this<br>
example are coded: the guide pin 80' on the upper part<br>
16' has a rectangular cross section, which corresponds<br>
to that of a bore in the lower part 17' with a<br>
rectangular cross section. The guide pin 81' on the<br>
upper part 16', in contrast, has a circular cross<br>
section, which corresponds to that of a bore in the<br>
lower part 17' with a circular cross section. Other<br>
codings are also conceivable.<br><br>
Furthermore, laterally protruding, tab-shaped coding<br>
elements 91, 92 are integrally formed on the lower part<br>
17' of the strain-relief clamp, which coding elements<br>
91, 92 enter corresponding recesses (coding elements<br>
93, 94) in the plug housing 11' in figure 15 if the<br>
strain-relief clamp is fastened on the plug housing 11'<br>
in the correct orientation. This ensures that the<br>
strain-relief clamps clamp the cables ending in the<br>
plug-type connection in the desired manner.<br>
Furthermore, it can be seen on the plug housing 11' in<br>
figure 15 that the contact protection means 67 can have<br>
different opening diameters, which make it possible for<br>
there to be clear assignment between the two plug-type<br>
connectors during the insertion process.<br>
Overall, the functional principle of the plug-type<br>
connection according to the invention can be summarized<br>
as follows:<br>
The plug-type connection is designed, for example, for<br>
a cable cross section of 35 mm2. The cables may be<br>
three fixed cable types, whose outer diameter may vary<br>
from approximately 11 mm to approximately 17 mm. The<br>
cables are pressed against one and the same metal part<br>
(contact element). Then the cables together with the<br>
metal part (contact element) are plugged into the<br>
insulating housing from the rear through the cable<br>
sleeve without the use of a tool until they noticeably<br>
latch into it.<br>
If all of the three contacts have been latched in, the<br>
cable strain-relief clamp can be plugged onto the cable<br>
sleeves. Now the cable strain-relief clamp can be<br>
screwed against a mounting plate with the corresponding<br>
threads by means of two (M5) screws. With this strain<br>
relief, the required holding force of the cables in the<br>
insulation is achieved. Furthermore, the protection<br>
rating IP67 on the cable sleeve is achieved thereby.<br><br>
Furthermore, the entire plug-type connection is held<br>
and locked on the mounting plate via the screws in the<br>
cable strain relief.<br>
For dismantling the device, the complete sequence is<br>
conducted in reverse order.<br><br>
