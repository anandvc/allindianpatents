				<td>Title: Process for the integrated production of urea and melamine<br>
DESCRIPTION Field of application<br>
The present invention refers, in its most general aspect, to a process for the integrated production of urea and melamine synthesized from at least part of said urea.,<br>
In particular, the present invention refers to a process of the aforementioned type and comprising the steps of;<br>
-	carrying out a urea synthesis in a first urea synthesis reactor, fed with ammonia and carbon dioxide, obtaining a reaction mixture comprising urea and ammonium carbamate,<br>
-	carrying out melamine synthesis, with formation of off-gas comprising ammonia and carbon dioxide,<br>
-	carrying out a further urea synthesis in a second urea synthesis reactor, fed with said off-gas, with production of a respective reaction mixture comprising urea and ammonium carbamate,<br>
-	feeding said reaction mixture produced by said first reactor and said reaction mixture produced by said second reactor to a urea recovery unit, obtaining urea and an ammonium carbamate aqueous solution.<br>
Prior art<br>
As it is known a well established process for the production of melamine from urea is the so-called integrated process, according to which the urea necessary for  the  aforementioned production is  synthesized from<br><br>
ammonia and carbon dioxide in a urea production section of a  so-called  integrated  plant,  coexisting  with  and substantially flanked by a melamine  synthesis  section, included in the integrated plant itself.,<br>
In certain cases, the urea production section comprises a first urea synthesis reactor, a second urea synthesis reactor, and a urea recovery unit for recovering urea from the urea/ammonium carbamate aqueous mixtures produced in said reactors..<br>
And it is known, for improved integration of such a process, that it is required to use, in the urea production section, the off-gases, comprising ammonia and carbon dioxide, which form in the melamine synthesis section, in order to produce a further amount of urea with them.<br>
For such a purpose, said off-gases are fed to the second urea  synthesis reactor,  which operates  at  a pressure substantially equal to that of the melamine  synthesis section- The aqueous reaction mixture thus obtained and comprising ammonia and carbon dioxide is subjected, in an appropriate  decomposer,   to  a  partial  decomposition treatment of the ammonium carbamate contained in it and a recovery treatment of the free ammonia dissolved in it,. The aqueous reaction mixture, comprising urea and ammonium carbamate,  coming out  from said first  urea  synthesis reactor,  is  also  fed,  for the  same  purpose,  to  the aforementioned decomposer- Moreover, the vapours leaving said  decomposer  are  condensed,  in  an  appropriate condenser,   obtaining  an  ammonium  carbamate  aqueous solution,  in  turn  recycled  to  said  first  synthesis reactor..<br>
Although advantageous from the point of view of the use of<br><br>
the off-gases for the purposes of an increase in urea production, the prior art of integrated urea and melamine production and related plant actuated in the way schematically described above, has recognized drawbacks.<br>
In particular, an overall yield of the urea production section is obtained that is unsatisfactory with respect to current market requirements, in particular in the case of high capacity plants.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The technical problem underlying the present invention is that of devising and providing a process for the integrated production of urea and melamine of the type considered above, capable of overcoming the limitations and drawbacks cited with reference to the prior art, in a simple and effective manner, i.e.. capable of totally satisfying the requirement of using the off-gases for the production of urea and at the same time capable of maximizing the yield in the urea production section.,<br>
This problem is solved, according to the present invention, by a process for the integrated production of urea and melamine synthesized from at least part of said urea, comprising the steps of:<br>
-	carrying out a urea synthesis in a first urea synthesis reactor, fed with ammonia and carbon dioxide, obtaining a reaction mixture comprising urea and ammonium carbamate,<br>
-	carrying out melamine synthesis, with formation of off-gas comprising ammonia and carbon dioxide,<br>
-	carrying out a further urea synthesis in a second urea synthesis reactor, fed with said off-gas, with production of  a  respective  reaction mixture  comprising  urea  and<br><br>
ammonium carbamate/<br>
- feeding said reaction mixture produced by said first reactor and said reaction mixture produced by said second reactor to a urea recovery unit, obtaining urea and an ammonium carbamate aqueous solution,<br>
said process is characterized by the fact of:<br>
feeding said ammonium carbamate aqueous solution obtained in said recovery unit to said second urea synthesis reactor.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the process for the integrated production of urea and melamine according to the present invention shall become clear from the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, made for indicating and not limiting purposes, with reference to the attached drawings,.<br>
Brief description of the drawings<br>
Figure 1 schematically represents a block diagram of a process for the integrated production of urea and melamine according to the present invention.<br>
Detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
With reference to the figure, the process for the integrated production of urea and melamine according to the present invention is based upon urea synthesis, in a respective urea production section 12, starting from ammonia and carbon dioxide and upon melamine synthesis, in a respective melamine synthesis section 14, starting from at least a part of the urea produced in the urea production section 12,.<br>
In melamine synthesis,  off-gases are formed comprising<br><br>
ammonia and carbon dioxide (and - in minimal quantities -steam) that are in turn used in urea synthesis-<br>
In particular, said ammonia and said carbon dioxide are fed into a first urea synthesis reactor 16, which preferably operates at high pressure, i.e.. a pressure approximately between 100 and 450 bar., A first reaction mixture comprising urea and ammonium carbamate is discharged from said first reactor 16 and is sent into a urea recovery unit 18..<br>
Further urea is synthesized in a second urea synthesis reactor 28, included in the urea production section 12, into which said off-gases are fed.. A second reaction mixture comprising urea and ammonium carbamate is discharged from said reactor 16 and sent into the urea recovery unit 18.<br>
In the urea recovery unit. 18, the urea contained in said first and said second reaction mixture is separated from an ammonium carbamate aqueous solution,,<br>
More  specifically,  in  a  decomposition  section  20, comprising at least one decomposer, included in the urea recovery unit 18, the reaction mixtures undergo a partial decomposition treatment of the ammonium carbamate and a partial  separation  treatment  of  the  free  ammonia  in aqueous solution present in said first mixture, obtaining an  aqueous  solution  essentially  comprising  urea,.  The vapours leaving said decomposition section 20 are at least partially  condensed  in  a  condensation  section  22, comprising at least one condenser, included in the urea recovery unit 18, obtaining a carbamate aqueous solution, which is recycled in the urea production section 12 in the way described hereafter.<br>
The aqueous solution essentially com.prising urea undergoes<br><br>
a finishing treatment in a suitable per se conventional urea finishing apparatus 24, which is arranged downstream of the decomposition section 20, obtaining urea ready for packaging and waste water.. The Waste water is subjected to purification in a suitable per se conventional waste water treatment apparatus 26, which is arranged downstream of the urea finishing apparatus 24, before being released into the environment.<br>
In the waste water treatment apparatus 26 vapours are generated that are sent to the condensation section 2 2, for their at least partial condensation,.<br>
In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, said ammonium carbamate aqueous solution is fed to the second urea synthesis reactor 28,. The second reactor 2 G preferably operates at high pressure, i.e- at a pressure approximately between 70 and 250 bar..<br>
The second reaction mixture is treated in the decomposition section 20, together with the first reaction mixture obtained in the first urea synthesis reactor 16, so that both the urea contained in the first reaction mixture and the further urea contained in the second reaction mixture are separated in the unit 18 at the same time..<br>
The off-gases produced in the melamine synthesis section 14, comprising ammonia and carbon dioxide, which are fed into the second urea synthesis reactor 28, react with the ammonium carbamate solution, advantageously supplying the heat necessary for the reaction in the second reactor 2 6 itself-<br>
Preferably,  said ammonium carbamate aqueous solution is fed to said second urea synthesis reactor 28 after a<br><br>
ammonia recovery carried out in a per se conventional ammonia recovery apparatus 30.. The ammonia recovered here is then sent to the ammonia feed for the first reactor 16,<br>
Preferably, the ammonia and carbon dioxide are mixed before entry into the first reactor 16, and enter into it in a suitable proportion, in a per   se conventional manner,<br>
Preferably, the aforementioned ammonia and carbon dioxide mixture, before being made to react in the first reactor 16, is subjected to condensation, preferably partial, in a further condenser 32, in order to recover heat and at the same time to suitably lower the temperature of the mixture to be fed into the first reactor 16, so as to control the reactor outlet temperature,<br>
As far as the operating pressures are concerned, the decomposition section 2 0 preferably operates at medium pressure, for example at a pressure approximately between 10 and 80 bar - The first reaction mixture leaving the first reactor 16 is expanded at the operating pressure of the decomposition section 20, before being fed therein.<br>
Advantageously, the second reactor 2 8 operates at a pressure similar to that of the melamine synthesis reactor included in said melamine synthesis section 14, so that the of f-gases are fed to the second reactor 2 8 without having to operate any compression on them. The second reaction mixture leaving the second reactor 28 is expanded to the operating pressure of the decomposition section 20, before being fed therein,.<br>
The further condenser 32 preferably operates at the same pressure as the first reactor 16.<br>
The present invention also refers to a plant for the integrated production of urea and melamine, which carries<br><br>
out the process indicated above,.<br>
The plant comprises the urea production section 12, wherein the urea is discharged with a duct 33, and the melamine synthesis section 14, wherein the melamine is discharged with a duct 3 7 „ The section 14 is fed with at least part of said urea through a duct 35 that extends from the duct 33.,<br>
The  urea  production  section  12  is  fed	by a  duct  3 4<br>
carrying ammonia and by a duct 36 carrying	carbon dioxide„<br>
The ducts 34 and 36 join into a duct 38	that feeds the<br>
first urea synthesis reactor 16-.<br>
In the preferred embodiment schematized in figure 1 , the duct 38 feeds the further condenser 32 and a duct 4 0 is provided for the fluid communication between the furtner condenser 32 and the first urea synthesis reactor 16„<br>
A duct 42 is provided for the fluid communication betweer. the first reactor 16 and the decomposition section 20,.<br>
The decomposition section 20 is in communication with the condensation section 22 through a duct 4 4 and with the apparatus 2 4 through a duct 4 6..<br>
A duct 4 8 is provided for the fluid communication between the apparatus 24 and the apparatus 2 6.<br>
The apparatus discharges water through a duct 50 and is in communication with the condensation section 22 through a duct 52.<br>
A duct 54 is provided for the fluid ccmmunication betweer: the condensation section 22 and the apparatus 30.<br>
The apparatus 30 is in communication with the second reactor 2 8 through a duct 55 and with the duct 3 4 through<br><br>
a duct 58.. The duct 56 is used to completely recycle the carbamate aqueous solution generated in the urea recevery unit IS to the second reactor 28.. A duct 60 is provided for the fluid communication between the section 14 and the second reactor 28..<br>
The second reactor 28 is in fluid communication with the decomposition section 2 0 through a duct 62.. In an alternative embodiment the duct 62 can be fitted onto rhe duct 4 2 that is - as stated - in fluid communication with the decomposition section 20 itself..<br>
From the previous description it can clearly be seen that a process for the integrated production of urea and melamine according to the invention achieves numerous advantages the first of which lies in the fact that an unusually high overall yield of the urea production section is obtained.<br>
A titolo di esempio, per una sezione di produzione urea in cui il primo reattore di sintesi urea soddisfa il XX% della  capacita  produttiva,  si  puo  ottenere  una  resa complessiva  superiore  anche  al  XX%[SI  PREGA  INSERIRE VALORI   DI   ESEMPIO,   AGGIUNGENDO   EVENTUALMENTE   ALTRE INFORMAZIONI  PER  INQUADRARE  MEGLIO  L'ESEMPIO  STESSO  E POSSIBILMENTE  FARE  UN  CONFRONTO  CON  IL  BREVETTO  US 3723430 „ UN ESEMPIO DI CONFRONTO POTREBBE ESSERE DEL TIPO: "A titolo di  esempio,  una sezione  di produzione urea secondo la tecnica nota, che ha una produzione di urea di XX ton/giorno nel primo reattore © di XX ton/giorno nel secondo reattore, puo avere una resa complessiva del XX% Una sezione di produzione urea secondo 1' invenzione , che ha produzioni di urea analoghe all'esempio summenzionato, ha una resa complessiva superiore anche al XX% ] .,<br><br>
