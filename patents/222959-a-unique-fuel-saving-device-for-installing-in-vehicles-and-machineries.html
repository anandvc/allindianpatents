7. ABSTRACT OF THE INVENTION: Given on a separate sheet.<br>
1<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to a unique fuel saving device for installation in vehicles and other equipments where fuel is used.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
With the increase in number of vehicles there is increase in pollution and the cost of fuel is increasing day by day. The fuel goes from tank to engine through carburettor. At the time of backstroke of engine the fuel in gas form comes back from the engine and is excreted through air filter into the atmosphere.<br>
At present no such device and its application in the process of fuel saving is used in vehicles and other equipments to increase efficient use of fuel.<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
The present invention relates to construction of a device and its installation in vehicles and other equipments for maximizing the utilization of fuel and thereby<br>
increasing the per litre average of fuel, reducing starting problems and to increase pick up of the vehicles.<br>
The object of present invention is therefore to reduce pollution and save fuel thereby increasing the efficiency of vehicles and other equipments.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to benefit economy by saving cost as most of petroleum products are expensive.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to reduce the burden of cost on common man as cost of petroleum products are increasing day by day.<br>
2<br><br>
The scope of the present invention includes a device that can be installed in vehicles and other equipments. The said device is can be made in various shapes/sizes.<br>
ADVANTAGES OF PRESENT INVENTION ARE:<br>
1.   There is decrease in pollution level upto 50%.<br>
2   Efficient use of fuel is increased upto 30% i.e more mileage per litre of fuel.<br>
3.	That there are no starting problems of vehicles.<br>
4.	That there is increase in pick up of vehicles.<br>
5.	That there is no knocking problem in engine. It runs smoothly.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:<br>
A fuel saving device for installation in vehicles and other equipments comprising of a ring made up of rubber or any other metal or any other rigid material having a groove along with its rim and having a hole inside it for the flow of air and having a movable flap made up of rubber or any other flexible material bigger in size than that of the hole and which is fitted at one end on the ring by means of a screw or any other suitable means so that the movable flap can move in hinged manner about the inner periphery of rubber ring while fitting in the projection and the disc made up of plastic or rubber or any other rigid material is fitted on the said movable flap by means of screw or any other means,.<br>
Alternatively, the movable flap is attached to a circular rubber ring belt, which gets embedded in the groove of the ring. The movable flap prevents air from going out of the carburettor at the backstroke of engine.<br>
3<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
Detailed descriptions of the preferred embodiment are provided herein; however,<br>
it is to be understood that the present invention may be embodied in various forms.   Therefore, specific details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but rather as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in virtually any appropriately detailed system, structure or matter.<br>
CONSTRUCTION:<br>
This unique device for fuel saving is a flap type mechanism for fitting in vehicles and other equipments.<br>
The device of the present invention comprises of a ring made up of rubber or plastic or any metal or any rigid material having a groove along with its rim and having a hole inside it for the flow of air and having a movable flap made up of rubber or any other flexible material bigger in size than that of the hole and which is fitted at one end on the ring by means of a screw or any other resilient material so that the said flap can move in hinged manner about the inner periphery of said rubber ring while fitting in the projection and this movable flap prevents air from going out of the carburettor at the backstroke of engine.<br>
Alternatively, the said movable flap is attached to a circular rubber ring belt, which gets embedded in the groove of the ring. The said movable flap prevents air from going out of the carburettor at the backstroke of engine.<br>
A disc made up of plastic or rubber or any other rigid material is fitted on the flap by means of a screw or any other means to add weight to the flap.<br>
4<br><br>
WORKING:<br>
The device is installed at the carburetor air inlet or hose pipe i.e from where air enters, in such a manner that the hinge point of the rubber flap is positioned at the top portion and it opens to the inner side of carburettor. The changes/settings that may be made in carburettor are change of jet, needle pin settings, idling, internal settings, air screw settings etc.<br>
In case of diesel engine a bosch pump is used instead of carburettor. This bosch pump spreads diesel into the engine with pressure through the nozzles. In diesel engine after the device is fitted necessary changes/settings are to be made in bosch pump and nozzles.<br>
In some vehicles, air filter inlet hole is required to be widened to provide more air to the engine or in some vehicles, this hole is required to be shortened to control or to reduce the air which is to be provided to the engine. In case where the hole is widened, a small pipe may be used therein in such a manner so that the air passing through that pipe gets warm/hot and then goes to the engine.<br>
The function of the flap is to open at the time of the air going into the engine and to close/shut at the time of the backstroke of the engine because at the backstroke of the engine, the fuel in the gas form goes back from the engine.<br>
Therefore the device stops the wastage of fuel, which returns to the carburettor due to the engine backstroke. The returned fuel is burnt and consumed totally thereby reducing pollution and increasing mileage per litre of fuel.<br>
VARIATIONS:<br>
The said device can be made up of plastic, glass, wood, leather, canvass, rubber, metal, fibre etc.. or can be made by the combination or alloy of two or more materials mentioned above. The said device may be made in any shape/size.<br>
5<br><br>
The said device may also be installed at the inlet of air filter.<br>
The said device and the process of installing it may be used in all types of vehicles<br>
and other equipments where fuel is used .<br>
The device of the present invention is illustrated in the figures 1, 2,3 and 4 of the accompanying drawing.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 shows the front view of the device. Figure 3 shows the sectional view of the device. Figure 4 shows the rear view of the device.<br>
The reference number used in figures land 2 comprises of following parts.<br>
1 .Rubber ring<br>
2.Groove<br>
3.Hole<br>
4.Movable flap<br>
5.Point of attachment of movable flap<br>
6.	Screw<br>
7.	Projection<br>
8.	Point of attachment of movable flap<br>
9.	Circular rubber ring belt.<br>
A rubber ring(l) having a groove(2) along its rim and having a hole(3) inside it for the flow of air and having a movable flap(4) bigger in size than that of the hole and which is fitted at one end(5) on the ring(l) by means of a screw or any other resilient<br>
material. The movable flap(4) moves in hinge manner about the inner periphery of rubber<br>
ring(l) while fitting in the projection(7) around hole(3). The movable flap(4) is fitted on a plastic or rubber or any rigid material by means of screw(6) or any other resilient material to add weight to the flap.
