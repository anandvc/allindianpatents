3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
Technical field:<br>
The present invention relates to a stable and viable biocatalyst with high activity and operational stability. The invention further relates to process of preparation of biocatalyst using a method of simple immobilization combined with simultaneous precipitation, cross linking and entrapment, which is easy to scale-up, involves the use of non toxic materials for immobilization.<br>
Background and Prior art:<br>
The enzymes, if soluble in water or in a mixture of water and other co-solvent, can be used for a single conversion cycle. To overcome this drawback, the technique of immobilization has been developed.<br>
The increasing use of enzymes as catalysts in industrial processes has led to increasing demand of enzymes in immobilized form. The immobilized enzymes frequently termed as 'biocatalysts' are widely used for industrial organic synthesis and biotransformation. According to a 2002 review, there are more than 130 biotransformation currently performed in an industrial scale using biocatalyst, mostly in the manufacture of pharmaceutical intermediates and other fine chemicals- Over the years this widely accepted technique of immobilization, has witnessed significant changes and improvement. Today the immobilizations are directed to Specific use and tailor made for purpose of use like immobilized antibodies, macromolecular complexes and structural proteins. Immobilized enzymes (biocatalyst) however command greater attention.<br>
The biocatalysts can be produced using whole living or dead cells or the enzymes made thereof. The source of enzyme may vary from plants and animals to microorganisms. The expanded pool of enzymes and advances in protein engineering has made it possible to produce economically viable biocatalyst on a commercial scale.<br>
The enzymatic reactions are highly specific which is based on specific properties of the enzymes such as substrate specificity, activity, enantio-selectivity, productivity, stability,<br><br>
pH and temperature optimum profiles and so forth. The commercialization of many enzymes is hampered by lack of operational stability coupled with relatively high price. This impediment can be overcome if one can find an effective method for immobilization. If successful, this not only results in improved selective properties, operational stability but allows for the facile separation, reuse of enzyme and simplifies down stream processing. Hence to develop a suitable biocatalyst the selection of suitable immobilization process becomes crucial.<br>
Conceptually, immobilizations have several approaches. Amongst them are adsorption, carrier binding, entrapment, and cross linking .Physical adsorption relies on the affinity of enzyme with the support. Though simple, the interaction is weak and the enzyme can be readily desorbed and lost. Carrier binding involves connecting the enzyme to a water insoluble support by ionic or covalent bonds. This process has a disadvantage of partial inactivation of the enzyme molecule because of strong chemical bond. Also the target enzymes are required to be in more purified form which eventually increases the cost of catalyst production.<br>
The third method of immobilization involves entrapment of a given enzyme in gel or microcapsules made of suitable organic or inorganic natural or synthetic polymers. This method has an advantage as it does not entail protein inactivation due to strong covalent bond modification. The formation of pores of a given size of the selected gel matrix or fibers can be suitably adjusted so as to hold up high molecular weight enzyme molecules. And yet permit selective passage of small reactant molecules and consequently, preclude the otherwise possible separation of the enzyme from the carrier. More often the entrapment method is combined with cross linking method in a number of configurations. Specific bi-functional agents like glutaraldehyde which form covalent bonds with the protein molecule resulting in formation of large aggregates. Cross linking also imparts rigidity and physical strength to the entrapped enzyme. In addition, supports generally used in entrapment seem to be compatible with whole cells and enzymes with low specificity and lower purity as compared to those used in covalent binding. This essentially makes the process more cost effective.<br><br>
Ample Literature is available on use of different materials and products of immobilized enzymes formed thereof.<br>
An article on "Immobilization of permeabilized whole cell penicillin G acylase from Alcaligenes faecalis using pore matrix cross linked with glutaraldehyde" by Cheng, Shiwei et al, (Biotechnology Letters, Volume 28, Number 14, July 2006, pages 1129-1133) discloses the activity of penicillin G acylase from Alcaligenes faecalis increased 7.5-fold when cells were permeabilized with 0.3% (w/v) CTAB. The treated cells were entrapped.by polyvinyl alcohol crosslinked with boric acid, and crosslinked with 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde to increase the stability. The conversion yield of penicillin G to 6-aminopenicillanic acid is 75% by immobilized system in batch reaction. No activity is lost after 15 cycles and about 65% enzyme activity is retained at the end of the 31st cycle.<br>
US Patent No 4727030 and US Patent No 4978619 also reports use of gel matrix for immobilization of enzymes or cells.<br>
Recently, Cross linked Enzyme Aggregates (CLEAs) as immobilized enzymes, has gained much importance and is looked upon as lucrative alternative to use of polymers for immobilization. However, its industrial viability needs to be further evaluated as the CLEA particles of most of the enzyme is too small and poses serious filtration problems. Though, CLEA offers high advantage of very high specific activity of enzyme, this operational issue of filtration impediments commercial exploitation.<br>
Significant work has been reported and published in this particular field but few techniques have been successful at commercial level. Penicillin acylases of microbial origin are currently used in immobilized form for the synthesis of intermediates of beta lactam antibiotics. Literature reports whole cell penicillin acylase catalyst, enzyme immobilized by entrapment or covalently linked purified enzyme forms, including catalysts based on Cross Linked Enzyme Crystals (CLEC) and Cross Linked Enzyme Aggregates CLEA.<br>
Penicillin acylase immobilized on cross linked p-xylene diamine with glutaraldehyde (Poly-XDA-GA-PA), assemblase(r) 7500 entrapped in Gelatin and Chitosan , PGA- 450<br>
4<br><br>
FERMASE PA 250, whole cell cross linking on Polyethleneimine supports, are to name a few.<br>
US Patent No 5846762 claims use of gelatin with propylene glycol &amp; alginate with glutaraldehyde to form gel beads containing entrapped enzyme of different enzymes.<br>
In US Patent No 6060268 claims preparation of an immobilized penicillin G acylase by covalent bonding to a crosslinked gelled gelatin and other polymers such as alginate amine, chitosan or polyethylene imine.<br>
By whichever method immobilized enzyme is prepared, an ideal industrial immobilized enzyme has to meet several criteria, such as recyclability, broad applicability, cost effectiveness, environmental and safety issues. Further, the conditions on an industrial scale are more severe for immobilizations as there are problems of inactivation of cells or enzymes due to polyfunctional reagents used. Also the low physical strength of immobilized biomaterial may clog the pores leading to diffusional limitations and hence limiting long time catalyst usage. Consequently, the disposal of deactivated immobilized enzymes also has to be accounted for an industrial scale. This is especially evident in case of certain enzymes like immobilized penicillin acylase which are used in tons for production of semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotics, both in the preparation of intermediates as well as in final drug molecules.<br>
Therefore, there is a need in the art to develop a biocatalyst having high activity and operational stability with multiple usage in hydrolytic and synthetic biocatalyses namely in the area of biotransformation of semisynthetic beta-lactam antibiotics, which the present inventors have achieved in this invention.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
In accordance with the above, the present invention provides a stable and viable biocatalyst with high activity and operational stability and method of immobilization thereof. The immobilization process is based on the principle of entrapment of partially purified enzyme precipitate which is simultaneously aggregated by cross linking agent like glutaraldehyde and further entrapped in a combination of natural polymer like gelatin<br>
5<br><br>
and synthetic polymer like polyvinyl alcohol with effective gelation under mild conditions of temperature and pH, resulting in a stable biocatalyst.<br>
Thus the stable biocatalyst obtained is an efficient immobilized product, in which enzyme is retained in the gel matrix and is not diffusing out of it. The gel material forms a stable matrix which can not only resist mechanical stress and prevent leakage of the enzyme, but also help better mass transfer of the enzyme reactants, thus lowering the barrier of concentration gradients.<br>
In one aspect, the present invention uses penicillin acylase enzyme from rE.coli RE 111 (pKA18) which shows high hydrolytic activity and Novel Penicillin Acylase enzymes from rE.coli BL21 CCM7394 (pKXIPl) and rE.coli REX III (pKXIPl) which show high synthetic activity to prepare immobilized, stable and viable biocatalyst with high activity and operational stability.<br>
In an alternative aspect, whole cells are also used. Other enzymes like lipase, protease, aldolases, isomerases can also be immobilized by similar process.<br>
In another aspect, partially purified enzyme is used after effective precipitation at low temperatures with ammonium sulphate, the concentration of which is optimized for each of the enzymes used and is in the range of 20-50 gram /gram of protein. Further, enzyme in precipitate form is crosslinked with bifunctional agent like glutaraldehyde (GA) to form stable aggregates. This particular stage includes nonspecific proteins which probably aid in the cross linking stage and increases the size of the aggregates formed, which in turn can be retained in entrapment and prevent diffusion.<br>

Detailed Description:<br>
The invention will now be described in detail in connection with certain preferred and optional embodiments, so that various aspects thereof may be more fully understood and appreciated.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises use of enzyme as precipitated aggregates obtained by salting out crude protein solution at low temperatures to form partially soluble precipitate and further cross linking with aid of cross linking agent to form aggregates.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a stable and viable biocatalyst with high activity and operational stability prepared by a process comprising the following steps:<br>
(a)	precipitating simultaneously and cross linking of enzyme solution with ammonium sulphate and glutaraldehyde at temperature between 1 °C to 2 °C to obtain Cross Linked Enzyme Aggregates;<br>
(b)	Variation of enzyme linking with ammonium sulphate and glutaraldehyde at higher temperature between 18 to 23 deg C, more specifically between 20- 21 deg C to obtain self immobilized Cross linked enzyme aggregate;<br>
(c)	entrapping the said aggregated enzyme in a solutions of 10% w/w polyvinyl alcohol and 10% w/w gelatin at low temperature;<br>
(d)	gelation is further allowed to occur with cold incubation at 5°C for 12 hours;<br>
(e)	obtaining gel enzyme by sieving through 150 micron to obtain uniformly distributed gel aggregates and<br>
(f)	re-crosslinking further gel aggregates with glutaraldehyde at 30°C, at pH 7.5-7.6 for 30 minutes to improve the structural stability.<br>
In preferred embodiment, the said enzyme is selected from penicillin acylase enzyme obtained from rE.coli RE III (pKA18) which shows high hydrolytic activity and Novel Penicillin Acylase enzymes obtained from rE.coli BL21 CCM7394 (pKXIPl) and rE.coli REXIII(pKXIPl).<br>
Principally, precipitating agents used are inorganic salts or biopolymers or solvents or combinations of these. The selectivity is based on enzyme being precipitated and precipitant not having a negative effect on enzyme activity and stability. Some well known and conventionally, used precipitants include quarternary ammonium salts and polyethylene glycol and solvents such as methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol,<br>
8<br><br>
acetone and tert butyl alcohol. Polyamines can be used but these are known to react with cross linking process hence ammonium sulphate is used, preferably.<br>
The amount of ammonium sulphate is generally used upto its water saturation concentration. Reported literature states that the percentage varies between 10-80%. However, it has to be optimized for specific enzyme and process involved. Therefore, in the present embodiment, the concentration of ammonium sulphate used is based on protein concentration of the enzyme solution. The optimized concentration used is preferably between 20-30 gram per gram of proteins. So the saturation concentration range varies between 50-70%. Precipitation is preferably performed at low temperatures between 0-5°C preferably between 1 to 2 °C to obtain gel aggregates.<br>
The pH is maintained between 7 to 7.5 for period of time! ranging from 30 minutes to 60 minutes and precipitate is allowed to stand at 5°C for 12 hrs for better aggregation. The precipitated form is separated by centrifugation. The number of enzyme molecules and way they are folded in the aggregate may have a profound effect on the activity of the enzyme. During aggregation, the solubility of the enzyme decreases. During this stage, the enzyme might denature so the time of aggregation and temperature are critical and optimized for the process.<br>
Cross linking is carried out in buffer for 5 minutes and at 1-2°C with fast addition of cross linking agent. The buffer used is 0.1M of sodium phosphate buffer with pH range between 6.5 - 7.5, for optimizing the enzyme.<br>
As a variation to the above process, the cross linking time, temperature and addition of glutaraldehyde was altered in one of the embodiment to form an insoluble precipitate as cross linked enzyme aggregate (CLEA)<br>
Although various cross linking agents are known, glutaraldehyde remains a cheap and most versatile agent. The range of concentrations has been studied for each of the enzymes. In case of Penicillin acylase, the best results are obtained with concentration of 1.7%-2.0%. However the preferred concentration is between 1.7-1.8% calculated with<br><br>
respect to final weight of the product. Similarly for novel penicillin acylase, the concentration preferred is in the range of 1.0-1.5%.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, various carrier materials are used for the process of entrapement Both organic and inorganic, occurring naturally or synthesized, acrylamide, chitosan, sodium alginate, polyvinyl alcohol, gelatin are used. A combination of two or more materials in suitable concentrations has resulted in formation of stable immobilized biocatalyst. The best suited carriers are further optimized for the product development.<br>
Normally, the types of materials used for entrapment varies with each process and enzyme. The materials most commonly preferred are synthetic like acrylamide or natural like calcium alginate, karrageennan, gelatin etc. The choice varies depending on factors influencing the process. Though monomers like acrylamide form relatively non reactive polymer, the product may contain traces of unpolymerized monomer which is potentially hazardous to the handler and further have disposal problems. Also the polymerization initiator Dimethylaminopropionitrile is highly toxic and must be handled with great care.<br>
Entrapment in calcium alginate gels allows immobilizations under mild conditions and is widely used for whole cell immobilizations. However, it has lesser probability of scale up as these systems has inherent problem of operational stability and enzyme leaching effect.<br>
In addition to use of acrylamide, chitosan, calcium alginate; gelatin also shows good potential gelling properties. Gelatin is an animal protein and tends to gel in solution at particular temperature. Based on the viscosity and gel strength of gelatin used, the gel can be strengthened by mixing with other polymeric materials. The pore size of such gel can be controlled by optimizing the concentration of gelatin and other polymer used.<br>
Further, the aqueous mixture of PVA with enzyme at lower temperature forms a dehydrated gel which is molded into desired shape. However" addition of any other polymeric material may further assist in water retention and increase in mechanical strength but requires optimization.<br><br>
Since acrylamide has been conventionally known to be used as polymerizing agent, it is used additionally with (PVA) and gelatin; however the product yields are less as compared to that obtained without use of acrylamide with gelatin and polyvinylalcohol. One of the reasons being there was poor polymerization which is evident from the formation of very soft material. This possibly led to enzyme leaching from the immobilized enzyme, thus low yields. Though, it is possible to improve the crosslinking and polymerization, the choice was always to avoid using a hazardous material like Acryl amide. Hence, further work was not continued.<br>
When chitosan is used instead of PVA, the final product has lower stability. Chitosan has been reported to be used in mixture with gelatin for immobilization (Assemblase), however the concentration of gelatin and chitosan needs to be optimized further to improve the final product.<br>
In view of the above disadvantages, the present inventor have used polyvinyl alcohol	as<br>
polymer along with gelatin, which gives better entrapment polymer as compared	to<br>
combination with acrylamide, or calcium alginate, chitosan for immobilization	of<br>
penicillin acylase.<br>
In the present invention, the Polyvinyl alcohol used is with moleculat weight is 125000 having viscosity 35-50cs. The Gelatin used is of the pharmaceutical grade. It is preferable to use PVA with high molecular weight more than 100000.<br>
PVA which are commercially available have fairly wide molecular distribution, the polydisperity indices range from 2 to 5. Molecular weight affects many properties such as adhesion, crystallizability, mechanical strength and diffusivity.<br>
.The molecular weight of PVA is directly proportional to the degree of polymerization. The degree of polymerization affects the solubility of PVA in water. PVA with high degree of polymerization and hydrolysis has molecular weight more than 77000, wherein the hydrophobic acetate groups weaken the intra molecular hydrogen bonding of adjoining hydroxyl groups. Hence the temperature is raised well above 70°C for dissolution to occur. It has to be further cooled before addition to the enzyme.<br>
11<br><br>
PVA used for pharmaceutical purpose can be crosslinked with agents such as Glutaraldehyde which tend to be insoluble in water. PVA has a tendency to form Hydrogels which can be described as hydrophilic, cross linked polymer. This particular property of PVA is particularly useful in immobilization as it tends to retain water which in turn prevents dehydration of enzyme and helps retain its active form. PVA by virtue of its macromolecular form is capable of forming a gel with cross linking agent and hence suitably used in the present embodiment.<br>
Another polymer, Gelatin, is widely used in food and pharma industry. Gelatin has natural tackiness which assists in agglomeration of particles. Gelatin solutions are used as the binder in this process to form larger agglomerates containing the active, binder, diluents and glidants. The use of gelatin in the granulation process provides an efficient means for reducing fines and maintaining physiological inertness. In suspension polymerization, gelatin functions to control particle size as well as to prevent coalescence of the particles<br>
Gelatin is used in solution form, the concentration of which varied between lOto 20%, Hot water is used to dissolve gelatin and stirred to form a clear solution before addition to the enzyme for immobilization. Both PVA and Gelatin concentrations act as prepolymers suitable for gelation and have been optimized in the present process based on the desired product properties. The polyvinyl alcohol concentration is between 4.5-7.5% of the weight of the final product, whereas the gelatin concentration is between 1-5 %, more precisely between 1.2-1.5 times of the weight of the polyvinyl alcohol used.<br>
Further, entrapment within polymers is aided by cross linking with bifunctional agents like glutaraldehyde (GA). The use of GA as cross linker has been widely reported. By optimizing the concentration of GA to be used for particular enzyme so as to retain its catalytic activity, it is possible to obtain a relatively stable product. GA forms Schiff s base with amino groups on protein molecules and hence helps better cross linking, an irreversible linkage is obtained with reduction of Schiff s bases with sodium borohydride, which is not found suitable for penicillin acylase as it results in loss of enzyme stability.<br><br>
In present process, gelatin being protein, the presence of gelatin further enhances the linkages of GA resulting in better entrapment and stable product.<br>
The product and the process described in the present invention are particularly advantageous because the materials are readily available, are non toxic, may pose lesser disposal problems, have probability of commercialization, and the use of process can be extended for other enzymes.<br>
The efficiency of immobilized penicillin acylase or novel penicillin acylase is determined by comparing their parameters with native enzyme. The enzyme activity in terms of hydrolysis and synthesis are higher than that of native form. The yields in terms of weight and activity are acceptable with industrial levels.<br>
The present invention further encompasses preparing solutions of entrapment agents, polyvinyl alcohol and Gelatin. A 10% w/w solution of each agent is prepared in warm water and heated at 90 °C to achieve dissolution. Each of the above prepared solution is added to the aggregated enzyme solution at 5°C and stirred at 200 rpm with overhead stirrer enabled with teflon blade to form a gel. The ratio of PVA and Gelatin in the mixture studied with respect to Penicillin acylase immobilization is in the range of 1:1.1 to 1: 1.5, most preferably 1:1.3. The gel is further allowed to stand at 5°C for 12hours for gelation to occur. During this time, the unreacted glutaraldehyde probably reacts with gelatin which seems to harden the gel further and improve the structure of the product, The gelated form is then sieved mechanically in # 30 mesh to obtain spherical gel beads of suitable size. Amongst all the shapes, spherical beads are most preferred, as these provide the highest surface/volume ratio and the present method allows the flexibility of obtaining the same. These beads are further recrosslinked with Q.5%-0.75% glutaraldehyde at 30 °C for 40 minutes at pH ranging between 7.2-7.5. The further cross linking improves the stability of the product and prevents any leaching of the enzyme and support materials and hence represents a very critical step in the process. The leaching of support materials or protein are checked by determining the absorbance of ishings 280nm and 600nm.The gel beads were washed with water to remove traces of unreacted reagents and monomers. Further washing is done with water and immobilized product is stored in 50mM sodium phosphate buffer containing 500 ppm of ethyl paraben. The final<br><br>
product referred to as immobilized biocatalyst had dry weight in the range of 15-20% with 98% of particles having size between 100-300 microns.<br>
