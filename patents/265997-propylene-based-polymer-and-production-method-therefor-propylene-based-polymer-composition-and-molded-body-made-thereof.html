PROPYLENE-BASED POLYMER AND PRODUCTION METHOD THEREFOR, PROPYLENE-BASED POLYMER COMPOSITION AND MOLDED BODY MADE<br>
THEREOF<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a propylene-based polymer and a production method therefor, a propylene-based polymer composition and a molded body made thereof, in detail, the present invention relates to a method for producing polypropylene stably in high productivity, in particular, a propylene-based polymer having reduced amount of fine or lump, high bulk density and good fluidity, by using a specific gas-phase process in combination with a specific solid catalyst component, and a production method for a propylene-based block copolymer having reduced gel and excellent appearance characteristics, a propylene-based polymer produced thereby, a propylene-based polymer composition made thereof and a molded body made thereof.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Polypropylene is used for various applications because it has good physical properties such as rigidity and heat resistance, and can be produced in relatively low cost.<br>
On the other hand, a production process of polypropylene has been technically improved for simplification of the production steps, reduction of production cost and enhancement<br><br>
of productivity. When industrial production of polypropylene had just begun, catalyst performance was low, and the steps for removing a catalyst residue and an atactic polymer from the obtained polypropylene was necessary, and such a process using a solvent as a slurry was dominant. By the following significant progress of catalyst performance, nowadays, a gas-phase process is dominant. Among the various gas-phase processes, a method for removing the heat of polymerization by utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene is superior in heat removing capability with small facilities (refer to Patent Document 3 and the like).<br>
As a gas-phase olefin polymerization reactor with the heat removal system by utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, there is known a horizontal reactor equipped with an agitator, which rotates around a horizontal axis thereof.<br>
In general, catalyst particles gradually grow to polymer particles by a polymerization reaction. When polymerization is carried out in the horizontal reactor, these particles are gradually growing and moving along the shaft direction of the reactor by two forces of polypropylene generation by polymerization and mechanical agitation. Therefore, particles having the same growth degree, that is, having the same residence time, align with the residence time, from the upstream toward the downstream of the reactor. Therefore, in the horizontal reactor, the flow pattern is a piston-flow-type, making residence time distribution narrow to the same degree as in the case with several continuous stirring tank reactors in series.<br><br>
This is the excellent feature not observed in other types of polymerization reactors, and is economically advantageous in achieving the same mixing degree of solid particles easily with a single reactor as with 2, 3 or more reactors.<br>
For polypropylene production, a method with the heat removal system for polymerization by utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, and with a horizontal reactor equipped with an agitator, which rotates around a horizontal axis thereof, has excellent characteristics as described above.<br>
In this way, a gas-phase process utilizing the heat of vaporization  of  liquefied  propylene  has  excellent characteristics, however, it has a problem to be solved such as modification for a highly active catalyst, which has been developed by progress of catalyst technology in recent years, improvement of power characteristics associated with it, and reduction of the amount of fines, which are easily blown up and fixed on to a pipeline.  For example, vaporized gas passes through a gas exhaust line located at the upper part tank wall of a reactor, and is condensed by a condenser and used again as liquid coolant for heat removal. In the process using the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, a large amount of vaporized gas increases gas flow rate in a gas exhaust line system, which inevitably makes fines of polymer particles or the like accompanied with the vaporized gas (entrainment phenomenon), and causes adhering to the inside of a pipe or a filter of the gas exhaust line system, or clogging thereof. In the worst case, the process should be stopped for cleaning. Therefore, such a<br><br>
method has been proposed that a separation chamber is installed where un-reacted gas and cooled vapor exhausted from the upper part of the horizontal reactor pass through and where a liquid coolant is sprayed to reduce the amount of fines, or the like (for example, refer to Patent Document 3 or the like).<br>
However, in the case of the high production pace, the amount of vaporized gas increases, in the worst case, such a problem appears that fines cannot be separated unless the diameter of the separation chamber is quite similar to that of the reactor, or additional facilities are required further.<br>
In addition, in gas-phase polymerization achieving high polymerization activity, destruction of solid catalyst components during polymerization raises such problems as deterioration of the shape, generation of fines and deterioration of powder characteristics.<br>
Furthermore, in order to achieve uniform residence time of the polymer particles in the tank, there are known various technologies and methods such as an agitating method of a horizontal-mono-axial type with many rectangular-shape flat paddles on the horizontal rotating shaft (for example, refer to Patent Document 4 or the like) ; an agitator able to continuously operate with one or more rotating baffles fixed on the rotating shaft (for example, refer to Patent Document 5 or the like) ; or an agitator having tanks partitioned by baffles fixed vertically to the rotating shaft on the inner wall of the tank(for example, refer to Patent Document 5 or the like); and the like. By these known technologies, uniform residence time in the horizontally agitated bed reactor system, and reduction<br><br>
of short-pass particles and the amount of fines in the agitator have been pursued.<br>
Therefore, it has been desired to develop a technology to reduce the amount of fines, which could cause troubles, in "a gas-phase process where the heat of reaction is removed mainly by using the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene", having high production capability with compact facilities and advantage that high catalyst activity can be achieved.<br>
In addition, in the case of producing polypropylene having high MFR value recently desired, there is a problem to be solved in view of productivity. In the case of utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, it is a general method to exhaust a gas from a polymerization reactor, to be liquefied by cooling with a heat exchanger, and to return again into the polymerization reactor. Because the temperature at which the gas is liquefied (due point) depends on the pressure and the gas composition, by adding such a gas component having low due point as hydrogen or ethylene into propylene, due point decreases in comparison with that of pure propylene. Cooling capability of the heat exchanger is determined by a facility, therefore, when the same facility is used, lower due point of the gas component lowers the capability to liquefy the gas, that is, lowers the heat removal capability. On the other hand, for polypropylene production, it is general to use hydrogen, which can induce a chain transfer reaction, as an agent to control the molecular weight. In order to produce polypropylene having higher MFR value, that is, lower molecular weight, hydrogen must<br><br>
be used in higher concentration. Therefore, in the gas-phase process utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, when polypropylene having high MFR value is produced, a problem of reduced productivity appears by the heat removal limitation. <br>
There have been several proposals on methods for solving these problems by catalyst improvement. First, for the problem of fines, for example, a method for spraying a molten mixture of a magnesi\am compound and an alcohol to obtain a mixture and then supporting a halogen-containing component on a solid catalyst (for example, refer to Patent Document 6); and also a method characterized by using a specific silane compound having an Si-O-C bond, have been proposed. In addition, a method for prepolymerizing a catalyst is also known, and a method for using a specific catalyst component prepolymerized with ethylene has been proposed (for example, refer to Patent Document 7) . Furthermore, a method for conducting prepolymerization under the higher pressure than that in a gas-phase polymerization reactor was also proposed (for example, refer to Patent Document 8).<br>
On the other hand, in order to produce polypropylene having high MFR value, it is effective to employ a catalyst system having high hydrogen response, and for example, there have been proposed a method for using an organoaluminum component in combination with an aluminoxane as co-catalysts (for example, refer to Patent Document 9) ; a method for using an organoaluminum component in combination with an organozinc component as<br><br>
co-catalysts (for example, refer to Patent Document 10) ; a method for supporting a halogen-containing component on a solid catalyst (for example, refer to Patent Document 11); a method for using an organosilicon compound having an amino group(for example, refer to Patent Documents 12, 13 and 14) ; a method for using a specific organosilicon compound having both a branched or aliphatic cyclic hydrocarbon group and an amino group (for example, refer to Patent Documents 15 and 16) and the like.<br>
In addition, in view of enhancing productivity, a method for using a highly active catalyst is considered. The present applicants have found that a highly stereospecific and highly active catalyst can be obtained by using a specific vinylsilane compound as a polymerization catalyst for propylene, and have filed patent application (refer to Patent Document 1 and 2 and the like). This method highly improves stereospecificity and activity, however, did not improve the productivity of a propylene-based polymer having high MFR value, especially in a slurry polymerization process or the like.<br>
Therefore, as far as the present inventors know, there has not yet been proposed a method with sufficient performance in view of the productivity of polypropylene having high MFR value, and furthermore, it has been desired to develop an improved technology reducing the amount of fines, and having good powder characteristics and high polymerization activity at the same time. In particular, in a gas-phase process having the heat removal system for polymerization utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, which is advantageous in productivity, it has been desired to apply the most effective catalyst system.<br><br>

A method for producing polypropylene of the present invention is conducted by a gas-phase process where the reaction heat is removed mainly by the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, and the catalyst previously contacted with the specific components reduced the amount of fines, therefore, in a gas-phase process where a large amount of vaporized gas is generated and fines are easily accompanied with it, polypropylene can be industrially produced in high productivity. In addition, in a gas-phase process which has an agitator, the amount of fines tends to increase by physical contact of a polymer with the agitator, however, the catalyst previously contacted with the specific components of the present invention can reduce the amount of fines even in the process.<br>
In addition, morphology of the obtained polymer powders is good, and reduction of the amount of fines decreases a load in the gas exhaust line system, and enhances the operation stability of the reactors and the downstream system, and furthermore, the economical process is achieved due to high catalytic activity and suppressed production cost.<br>
Furthermore, use of a method for producing polypropylene of the present invention is capable of producing a propylene-based polymer having high MFR value, for example, a polypropylene homopolymer, a propylene-based random copolymer and a propylene-based block copolymer, in high productivity.<br>
In addition, because of high stereoregularity of the obtained polypropylene, a high quality product with high<br><br>
rigidity and less stickiness can be obtained. In addition, because the comonomer content in a random copolymer component can be increased, a high quality product, with the excellent balance of rigidity and impact strength, not only at room temperature but also at low temperature, can be obtained. Polypropylene obtained in this way can be used suitably, in particular, for injection molding applications represented by automotive parts or home appliances parts.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Explanation will be given below on the present invention specifically and in detail, for a catalyst, production process and conditions, a propylene-based polymer, and applications of<br><br>
a propylene-based polymer.<br>
[I] Catalyst<br>
The present invention is characterized by using a solid catalyst component (A) , which is made by contacting a solid component (Al) containing titanium, magnesium and a halogen as essential components; a vinylsilane compound (A2); organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group (A3a) and/or a compound having at least two ether bonds (A3b), to contact treatment, as a catalyst for polypropylene.<br>
It is preferable that an organoaluminum compound (A4) or a halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) is contacted in addition to them, in the solid catalyst preparation.<br>
In addition, optional components such as an organoaluminun compound (B) , an organosilicon compound (C) and a compound having at least two ether bonds (D) and the like may be used, within a range not to impair the effects of the present invention, in polymerization.<br>
1. Solid catalyst component (A)<br>
The solid catalyst component (A) used in the present invention is prepared by contacting the following (Al) to (A3) . In the preparation, other optional components such as an organoaluminum compound (A4) may be contacted by an arbitrary method, within a range not to impair the effects of the present invention. Explanation will be given in detail on each of the components.<br>
(1) A solid component (Al)<br><br>
In the present invention, as the solid component (Al), titanium (Ala), magnesium (Alb) and a halogen (Ale) are contained as essential components, and an electron donor (Aid) may be used as an optional component. Here, "are contained as essential components" means that optional components, other than the exemplified three components, may be contained in arbitrary forms within a range not to impair the effects of the present invention. A solid component, containing titanium, magnesium and a halogen as essential components itself is known, and will be explained below in detail.<br>
(Ala) Titanium<br>
As a titanium source, an arbitrary titanium compound can be used. As a typical example thereof, a compound disclosed in JP-A-3-234707 may be included. As for valence of titanium, a titanium compound having arbitrary valence of tetra-, tri-, di- or zero-valence may be used, however, it is desirable that a titanium compound having preferably tetra- and tri-valence, more preferably a titanium compound having tetra-valence is used.<br>
As a specific example of a tetra-valent titanium compound, we can exemplify halogenated titanium compounds as represented by titanium tetrachloride; alkoxy titanium compounds as represented by tetrabutoxy titanium; condensation compounds of an alkoxy titanium compound having a Ti-O-Ti bond as represented by tetrabutoxy titanium dimer, (BuO)sTi-O-Ti(OBu)3 organometallic titanium compounds as represented by dicyclopentadienyltitanium dichloride; or the like.  Among<br><br>
them, titanium tetrachloride and tetrabutoxy titanium are particularly preferable.<br>
■ As a specific example of a three-valent titanium compound, titanium halide compounds represented by titanium trichloride may be included. As titanium trichloride, compounds produced by a known arbitrary method may be used, such as a hydrogen reduced-type, a metal aluminum reduced-type, a metal titanium reduced-type, an organoaluminum reduced-type or the like.<br>
The above titanium compounds may be used singly or in combination of them. In addition, it is possible to use a mixture of the above titanium compounds, or a compound having an average composition equal to a mixed equation thereof (for example, a compound such as Ti (0Bu)mCl4_n,; 0<m or a complex with any other compound such as phthalate ester example ph ticl the like.></m>
(Alb) Magnesium<br>
As a magnesium source, an arbitrary magnesium compound may be used. As a typical example thereof, a compound disclosed in JP-A-3-234707 may be included. In general, there may be used magnesium halide compounds as represented by magnesium chloride; alkoxy magnesium compounds as represented by diethoxy magnesium; oxymagnesium compounds as represented by metal magnesium, magnesium oxide; hydroxy magnesium compounds as represented by magnesium hydroxide; Grignard compounds as represented by butyl magnesium chloride; organometallic magnesium compounds as represented by butyl ethyl magnesium; magnesium salts of an inorganic acid and an organic acid as<br><br>
represented by magnesium carbonate or magnesium stearate; and a mixture thereof, or a compound having an average composition equal to a mixed equation thereof (for example, a compound such as Mg(0Et)niCl2-m; 0<m and the like. among them particularly-preferable ones are magnesium chloride diethoxy metal butyl chloride.></m>
In particular, if large particles are produced, it is preferable to use a dialkoxymagnesium compound, by which a catalyst particle diameter is easily controlled. As a dialkoxymagnesium compound, we can use not only one produced in advance but also one obtained by the reaction between metal magnesium and alcohol in the presence of a halogen or a halogen-containing metal compound, in the catalyst preparation.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, dialkoxymagnesium suitable for the component (Alb) is in the form of a granule or a powder, and irregular or spherical shape may be applicable. For example, a spherical dialkoxymagnesium is used, polymer powders having a better particle shape and narrow particle size distribution can , be obtained, and handling operability of generated polymer powders in the polymerization operation is enhanced, and such a problem can be solved as clogging caused by fines contained in the generated polymer powders.<br>
The above spherical dialkoxymagnesium is not necessarily a true sphere, and one having an ellipse shape or a potato shape may also be used. Specifically, as the shape of the particle, ratio of a longer shaft diameter 1 to a shorter shaft diameter W, (1/W), is equal to or smaller than 3, preferably from 1 to<br><br>
2, and more preferably from 1 to 1.5.<br>
In addition, as the dialkoxymagnesium, one having an average particle diameter of 1 to 200 jam, preferably from 5 to 150 ijm may be used. In the case of the spherical dialkoxymagnesium, the average particle diameter thereof is from 1 to 100 )jm, preferably from 5 to 500 ^m, and more preferably from 10 to 40 jam. In addition, as for the particle size distribution thereof, it is desirable to use one having less fine and large powders, and narrow particle size distribution. Specifically, the amount of particles whose diameter is no more than 5 ym is no more than 20%, preferably than 10%. On the other hand, the amount of particles whose diameter is no less than 100 pm is no more than 10%, preferably than 5%. Furthermore, when the particle size distribution thereof is represented by ln(D90/D10) (wherein D90 is a particle diameter at 90% in the integral distribution curve; and DIO is a particle diameter at 10%), it is equal to or smaller than 3, and preferably equal to or smaller than 2.<br>
A method for producing the spherical dialkoxymagnesium as above is exemplified in, for example, JP-A-58-41832, JP-A-62-51633, JP-A-3-74341, JP-A-4-368391, JP-A-8-73388 or the like.<br>

An optional component such as an electron donor, a silicon compound having an alkoxy group represented by tetraethoxysilane, and silicon halide compounds may be contacted, if necessary. In this case, the optional component may be contacted with the titanium-containing compounds simultaneously, or may be contacted separately.<br>

As the vinylsilane compound (A2) used in the present invention, compounds disclosed in JP-A-2-34707 and JP-A-2003-292522 may be used.

In the general formula (2), m represents the number of a<br><br>
vinyl group, and is in the range of 1 to 4; more preferably m is desirably 1 or 2, and particularly preferably 2.<br>
In the general formula (2) , X represents a halogen and may be exemplified by fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine or the like. If there are some Xs, each of them may be the same or different. Among them, chlorine is particularly preferable.

It may be because it behaves in the same manner as t-butyltriethoxysilane having a similar structure (as will be described later, this t-butyltriethoxysilane is effective as the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group (A3c) in the present invention). More preferably, it is desirable that the k value is in the range of 0 to 1, and particularly preferably 0. If the k value is 2, each of two R^s may be the same or different.

As an example of such optional components, the organoaluminum compound (A4) may be included.<br>
For the organoaluminum compound (A4) as an optional component in the preparation of the solid catalyst component (A) in the present invention, compounds and the like disclosed in JP-A-2004-124090 may be used.

(5) A halogen-containing silicon compound (A5)<br>
As the other optional component of the solid catalyst<br><br>
component (A), the halogen-containing silicon compound may be included.<br>
The halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) in the present invention can be represented by the following general formula (5):<br>
R^^SiX4-a     (5)<br>
(wherein R^^ is a hydrogen atom, a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group or an aromatic hydrocarbon group; X is a halogen atom; and "a" is an integer of 0, 1, 2 or 3.)<br>
In the general formula (5), R^"' represents a hydrogen atom, a saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon group or an aromatic hydrocarbon group; preferably, a Ci to Cio hydrocarbon group, and may be chain-like or cyclic.<br>

In addition, the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) may be used not only singly but also in -combination of a them.<br><br>
If the halogen (Ale) used in the preparation of the solid catalyst (Al) is originated from a silicon halide compound, it is differentiated from the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) shown here, as follows.<br>
(i) If the silicon halide compound is contacted with the solid component which does not contain any compound selected from the carboxylic acid derivatives (Aid) or the compounds having at least two ether bonds (Ale), this silicon halide compound is defined as (Ale) instead of (A5).<br>
(ii) If the electron donor (Aid) and the silicon halide compound are simultaneously contacted with the solid component which does not contain any compound selected from the carboxylic acid derivatives (Aid) or the compounds having at least two ether bonds (Ale), this silicon halide compound is defined as (Ale) instead of (A5) .<br>
(iii) If the silicon halide compound is contacted with the solid component (Al) containing at least one compound selected from the carboxylic acid derivatives (Aid) or the compounds having at least two ether bonds (Ale), this silicon halide compound is defined as (A5).<br>
Furthermore, the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) may be the same as or different from the silicon halide compounds as the halogen (Ale) that is an optional component in the solid component (Al).<br>
When the silicon halide compound is used as the halogen<br>
(Ale) source of the solid catalyst (Al) , the role of this silicon<br>
halide compound is to supply a halogen to the solid catalyst<br><br>
(Al) to form MgCl2 as a catalyst support. On the other hand, the role of the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) is to modify the surface of the solid catalyst (Al) prepared in advance for the enhanced interaction with the organoaluminum compound (A4), and also to remove unfavorable Ti species by extraction. Therefore, roles of both compounds are essentially different, and even if the same compound is used, the roles can be differentiated strictly. In addition, because the role of the carboxylic acid derivatives (Aid) and the compounds having at least two ether bonds (Ale) is to modify a crystal structure and an electron state of MgCl2 for a solid catalyst support, they must be supported on the solid catalyst (Al) before the reaction with the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5).<br>
Therefore, it is not defined as the silicon halide compound (A5), if it is used in the preparation of the solid catalyst (Al) before supporting at least one compound selected from the carboxylic acid derivatives (Aid) and the compounds having at least two ether bonds (Ale) on it, or simultaneously in the supporting processing.<br>
2. A preparation method for the solid catalyst component (A) The solid catalyst component (A) in the present invention is prepared by contacting (Al) the solid component, (A2) the vinylsilane compound, and, (A3) the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group, and/or, the compound having at least two ether bonds. In this case, other optional compounds such as (A4) the organoaluminum compound, (A5) the halogen-containing silicon compound and the like may be contacted by an arbitrary method, within the range not to impair<br><br>
the effects of the present invention. Contact conditions of each component of the solid catalyst component (A) may be arbitrary, within the range not to impair the effects of the present invention, although the absence of oxygen is necessary. In general, the following conditions are preferable.<br>
Contact temperature is in the range of about -50 to 200°C, preferably in the range of -10 to 100°C, still more preferably in the range of 0 to 70°C, and particularly preferably in the range of 10 to 60°C. As a contact method, we can exemplify a mechanical method by a rotation ball mill or a vibration mill; a method for contacting by agitation in the presence of an inert diluent; or the like. Preferably, it is desirable to use a method for contacting by agitation in the presence of the inert diluents.<br>
Ratio of the amounts of each components used, which composes the solid catalyst component (A) in the present invention, may be arbitrary within the range not to impair the effects of the present invention, however, in general, the following range is preferable.<br>
It is desirable to use the vinylsilane compound (A2) preferably within the range of 0.001 to 1,000, and particularly preferably within the range of 0 . 01 to 100, in molar ratio (moles of the vinylsilane compound (A2) / moles of titanium atoms) with respect to a titanium component composing the solid component (Al) .<br><br>
When the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group (A3a) is used, it is desirable to use it preferably within the range of 0.01 to 1,000, and particularly preferably within the range of 0.1 to 100, in molar ratio with respect to a titanium component composing the solid component (Al) (moles of the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group (A3a) / moles of titanium atoms).<br>
When the compound having at least two ether bonds {A3b) is used, it is desirable to use it preferably within the range of 0.01 to 1,000, and particularly preferably within the range of 0.1 to 100, in molar ratio with respect to a titanium component composing the solid component (Al) (moles of the compound having at least two ether bonds (A3b) / moles of titanium atoms),<br>
When the organoaluminum compound (A4) is used as an optional component, it is desirable to use it preferably within the range of 0.1 to 100, and particularly preferably within the range of 1 to 50, in atomic ratio of aluminum with respect to a titanium component composing the solid component (Al) (moles of an aluminum atom / moles of titanium atoms).<br>
When the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) is used as an optional component, it is preferable to use it within the range of 0.1 to 10, and preferably within the range of 5.0 to 10, in molar ratio with respect to a titanium component composing the solid component (Al) (moles of the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5) / moles of titanium atoms).<br>
If amount of the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5)<br><br>
used exceed 10 in molar ratio, particles are broken, and fines increase, by the halogen-containing silicon compound (A5), and still more significantly the activity decreases due to the excessive removal of Ti by extraction. On the other hand, if the amount is less than 1.0, the surface of the magnesium halide support can not be modified, and catalytic performance such as stereoregularity or comonomer incorporation is hardly improved sufficiently.<br>
As a contacting procedure of (Al) the solid component, (A2) the vinylsilane compound, and (A3) the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group (A3a), and/or, the compound having at least two ether bonds (A3b) , an arbitrary procedure may be used.

In this case, any of (A2) the vinylsilane compound, and (A3) the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group (A3a) and/or the compound having at least two ether bonds (A3b) in each contact may be the same or different.

Components other than the above organoaluminum compound (B) , the organosilicon compound (C) and the compound having at least two ether bonds (D) may be used as optional components of the catalyst within the range not to impair the effects of the present invention. For example, by using a compound (E) having a C(=0)N bond in the molecule, as disclosed in JP-A-2004-124090, production of an amorphous component such as CXS (a cold xylene soluble component) can be suppressed. In this case,  a  preferable  example  includes  tetramehylurea,<br><br>

For example, after pre-polymerization of (Al) the solid component, (A2) the vinylsilane compound together with (A3) the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group and/or the compound having at least two ether bonds may be contacted. In addition, after contacting (Al) the solid component, the vinylsilane compound together with (A3) the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group and/or the compound having at least two ether bonds, pre-polymerization may be conducted. Furthermore, when (Al) the solid component is contacted with (A2) the vinylsilane compound together with (A3) the organosilicon compound having an alkoxy group and/or the compound having at least two ether bonds, pre-polymerization may be conducted simultaneously.<br>
Reaction conditions between the solid catalyst component<br>
(A) or the solid component (Al) and the above monomers may be<br>
selected arbitrarily in the range not to impair the effects of<br>
the present invention.  In general, the following range is<br>
preferable.<br>
The amount of pre-polymer is desirably within the range of 0.001 to 100 g, preferably within the range of 0.1 to 50 g, still more preferably within the range of 0.5 to 10 g, based on 1 g of the solid catalyst component (A) or the solid component (Al) . Reaction temperature of pre-polymerization is within the range of -150 to 150°C, and preferably within the range of 0 to 100°C. And, it is desirable to conduct pre-polymerization at lower temperature than polymerization temperature. In general, the reaction is preferably conducted under agitation, and in this case an inert solvent such as hexane, heptane may<br><br>
be present.<br>
Pre-polymerization may be conducted some times, and in this case, monomers in each use may be the same or different. In addition, after pre-polymerization, the catalyst may be washed with an inert solvent such as hexane, heptane or the like. After pre-polymerization, the catalyst may be used without further treatment corresponding to the style how to use the catalyst, however, it may be dried, if necessary.<br>
Furthermore, during contacting or after contacting of each of the above components, a polymer such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, or a solid of inorganic oxide such as silica, titania may be present together.<br>
The catalyst (A) after pre-polymerization is covered with a polymer shell, however, the average particle diameter (the size including the polymer shell) of the catalyst used in the following polymerization is preferably no less than 30 \im, still more preferably no less 40 pm, in addition, it is preferably no more than 250 ]im, and still more preferably no more than 200 jjm.<br>
[II] Production process and polymerization conditions<br>
As a production process of polypropylene, an arbitrary process may be used as long as it is a gas-phase process which mainly utilizes the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene for the heat removal.<br>
In the present invention, a gas-phase process does not mean complete absence of liquid. It is sufficient to use a substantially gas phase for polymerization, and liquid may be<br><br>
present within the range not to impair the effects of the present invention. As this liquid, not only liquefied propylene for the heat removal but also an inert hydrocarbon component such as hexane may be exemplified.<br>
As a mixing type, both of a method using a fluidized bed and a method using an agitator may be used. When an agitator is used, a fluid bed equipped with an agitator may be also used. An agitating shaft of the agitator may be in the vertical direction or in the horizontal direction. As the shape of an agitating wing, an arbitrary one such as a paddle, a helical-type may be used. Among them, a method using the agitating shaft in the horizontal direction with paddles is most preferable.<br>
A reactor is not limited in the shape, size, material or the like, as long as it is suitable for the reaction, depending on the raw materials used, reaction conditions, reaction types, products and the like, and may be used by selecting arbitrarily from conventional ones. A preferable shape is a horizontal reactor having a cylindrical part. Any size can be used depending on the reaction type, however, it is preferable to be equal to or larger than 20 m'^ in view of productivity and economical efficiency.<br>
In general, in the case of carrying out polymerization of propylene in a gas-phase process using a horizontal reactor having an agitator inside, which rotates around a horizontal axis thereof, the amount of fines generally increases by physical contact of polymer particles with the agitator, however, the method for producing polypropylene of the present invention<br><br>
is characterized by the suppressed amount of fines which can be achieved by the above-described catalyst prepared by the preceding contact with the specific component.<br>
As an alignment of polymerization reactors, an arbitrary method may be used as long as it does not impair the effects of the present invention. The polymerization reactor alignment may be single or multiple. As a method for further narrowing the residence time distribution without increasing the number of reactors, baffles for restricting powder flow may be installed in the polymerization reactors. As the type of the baffles, fixed baffles, which are fixed onto the polymerization reactors, may be used, or rotating baffles, which are fixed on the rotating shaft, may be used. When there are some polymerization reactors, they may be connected in series or in parallel. In particular, in the case of producing a block copolymer of propylene and other monomers, it is desirable to adopt an alignment containing at least two polymerization reactors in series.<br>
As a polymerization method, both of a batch method and a continuous method may be used, however, it is desirable to use the continuous method in view of productivity. As a particularly preferable example, a continuous polymerization method, where 2 to 4 polymerization reactors are connected in series, may be exemplified.<br>
In the present invention, in a continuous polymerization, it is preferable to achieve complete plug flow in the reactors,<br><br>
however, while the raw materials are fed into the reactors, reacted during the residence time, and discharged as the reaction product from the reactor, local back-mixing may be achieved to enhance the tank number effect by installing baffles and the like inside the reactor, and in the present invention, these modifications are also included in the expression of the plug flow.<br>
Therefore, in the present invention, it is preferable to conduct a continuous polymerization by a gas-phase process utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene having a horizontal reactor equipped with an agitator inside, which rotates around a horizontal axis thereof, in the manner of plug flow or the like, and by the combination of such a method and a catalyst of the present invention, a propylene-based polymer having uniform and almost spherical shape, being hardly broken down, having less fines and also high MFR value, can be produced in high productivity.<br>
As a method of the heat removal by utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, an arbitrary method may be used. In order to remove the heat by utilizing the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene, propylene substantially in the liquid state should be supplied into the polymerization reactors. Fresh liquefied propylene may be supplied into the polymerization reactors, however, it is generally desirable to use recycled propylene. A general procedure to use recycled propylene will be exemplified below. Propylene-containing gas is discharged from a polymerization reactor, and cooled until at least partly condensed, and at least a part of the liquefied<br><br>
component is supplied into the polymerization reactor. In this case, the liquefied component needs to contain propylene, however, a comonomer component represented by butene or an inert hydrocarbon component represented by isobutane may be included.<br>
As a method for supplying liquefied propylene, an arbitrary method may be uses as long as supplying propylene substantially in the liquid state to the polymerization reactors. It may be supplied to a bed of polypropylene particles, or it may be supplied to a gas-phase. In the case of supplying to the gas-phase, it may be supplied to the gas-phase inside the polymerization reactors, or it may be supplied to a recycled gas line. In particular, in the case of a stirred tank reactor having the agitating shaft in the horizontal direction, it is desirable to supply the liquefied propylene to the gas-phase inside the polymerization reactors.<br>
In the present invention, "to remove the heat by using mainly the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene" does not mean "to remove the heat by using only the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene". Other heat removal methods may be used together as long as it does not impair the effects of the present invention. Specifically, we can exemplify a method for the heat removal by using a jacket installed at the polymerization reactor; a method for discharging a part of the gas from the polymerization reactor which is cooled in a heat exchanger and returned to the polymerization reactor; or the like. However, in the present invention, it is necessary that the heat removal by using the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene should be major.<br><br>
Specifically, at least half of the heat should be removed by-using the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene in at least one polymerization reactor.<br>
Polymerization conditions such as temperature or pressure may be set arbitrarily as long as it does not impair the effects of the present invention. Specifically, polymerization temperature is preferably equal to or higher than 0°C, still more preferably equal to or higher than 30°C, and particularly preferably equal to or higher than 40°C; preferably equal to or lower than 100°C, still more preferably equal to or lower than 90°C, and particularly preferably equal to or lower than 80°C. Polymerization pressure is preferably equal to or higher than 1200 kPa, still more preferably equal to or higher than 1400 kPa, and particularly preferably equal to or higher than 1600 kPa; preferably equal to or lower than 4200 kPa, still more preferably equal to or lower than 3500 kPa, and particularly preferably equal to or lower than 3000 kPa. However, polymerization pressure should not be set lower than the vapor pressure of propylene at the polymerization temperature.<br>
Residence time may be adjusted arbitrarily depending on the constitution of the polymerization reactors or the product indices. In general, it is set within the range of 30 minutes to 5 hours.<br>
The polymerization catalyst or other optional components of the present invention may be supplied into the polymerization reactor by any known method. The polymerization catalyst may be supplied into the polymerization reactor as a powder without<br><br>
further modification, however, it may be supplied in the diluted form with an inert solvent such as hexane or mineral oil.<br>
Because the catalyst of the present invention has very high activity,  it  is  preferable  to  be  supplied  into  the polymerization reactor in the diluted form. In particular, when an ethylene-propylene random copolymer or the like is produced, the activity becomes extremely high, and therefore insufficient dilution could cause a trouble of fouling or the like.  In such a case, it is effective to use at least one compound selected from the group of the optional components consisting of the organosilicon compound (C), the compound having at least two ether bonds (D) and the compound (E) having a C(=0)N bond in the molecule.  It is preferable that the solid catalyst component is contacted with these optional components before supplied into the polymerization reactor, because of the further higher effect of fouling prevention.  In this case, a contact method of both components is arbitrary, however,  it is preferable that the optional components are supplied into the supply line of the solid catalyst component  into the polymerization reactor, or the optional components are added to the solid catalyst in the tank after diluted with the inert solvent.<br>
In a gas-phase process with the heat removal system by utilizing the heat of vaporization, fluidization by gas happens in any of the process. Vaporized gas is recovered, and passes through a gas exhaust line located at the upper part tank wall of the reactor, then condensed by a condenser and used again<br><br>
as a liquid coolant for heat removal. Because around a catalyst feed point in the reactor in continuous polymerization, there are polymer particles in the early stage of their growth, whose diameter is equal to or smaller than 50 jam, and because a large quantity of vaporized gas generate, fines such as polymer particles and catalyst particles tend to be accompanied with the vaporized gas. Therefore, it is necessary to select a catalyst having high activity and less fines.<br>
In addition, deterioration of the powder morphology tends to accelerate powder breaking, which is caused by agitation and fluidization by gas, and in particular, increase of fines originated from powder breaking by the agitation increases the entrainment amount. In addition, also in a transfer system, fines are increased by fracture caused by contacting, resulting in the worse productivity in the finishing system.<br>
"The entrainment amount" in the present invention means the amount of particles passing through a gas exhaust line located at the upper part tank wall or the like (or at the side part or the bottom part) of a reactor and discharged from the reactor accompanied with gas. As a method for specifically measuring the entrainment amount, an example includes a method for installing an apparatus for fine removal, such as a cyclone or a bag filter, before the condenser, and weighing the amount of fines [g/kg] (
By the catalyst of the present invention, because of its large average particle size, polypropylene having a large<br><br>
average particle size is produced. Therefore, polymer particles corresponding to the particle size distribution of the solid catalyst component are formed, and less fines of a polymer is produced, and also fracture caused by the agitation or the gas flow is reduced.<br>
In this way, the catalyst of the present invention is useful from the viewpoint of the specific capability of producing polypropylene with the reduced amount of fines produced by fracture caused by the agitation and the gas flow, and from the viewpoint of less fines produced and less particles accompanied with the vaporized gas into an off-gas line.<br>
In addition, when a homopolymer and a copolymer of polypropylene is produced, it is preferable that the amount of fines produced, with a particle size equal to or smaller than 100 ]xm, is equal to or less than 0.10 g/kg respect to the unit production amount.<br>
The higher this value is, because of the increased entrainment amount, the higher the load to the gas exhaust line system is, and the more the adhesion onto it or the like is, and the lower gas condensation capability is, because more fines are blown into the condenser. In addition, frequent occurrence of fines extremely increases sticking onto the polymerization reactor in the downstream system, and makes the operation unstable.<br>
In the present invention, in particular for the production of a block copolymer, (F) the electron donating compound may be added as a killing agent in the polymerization reaction.<br><br>
When a gas-phase polymerization process has two stages of polymerization composed of the first stage where propylene is homo-polymerization or co-polymerized with one or more kinds of comonomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene and C4 to Cs a-olefins; and the second stage where propylene is co-polymerized with one or more kinds of comonomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene and C4 to Cs a-olefins in the higher ratio of the said comonomer than that at the first stage, it is preferable that the electron donating compound (F) is added at the first stage and/or the second stage.<br>
The purpose of the electron donating compound added in the polymerization reaction is to deactivate the short-passed particles, different from that of the electron donating compound (an internal donor or an external donor) used in the catalyst component. Deactivation of the particles passing through the first stage shortly can reduce the particles excessively active for the copolymerization at the second stage, resulting in suppressing gels or fish-eyes.<br>
In view of effective deactivation of the short-passed particles, as the addition timing of the component (F), it is preferable to add it between the position of 1/3 length upstream from the downstream end of the reactor for the first stage and the position of 1/3 length downstream from the upstream end of the reactor for the second stage.<br>
The component (F) , which is the electron donating compound, is usually an organic compound containing oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorous or sulfur, and is capable of donating an electron.<br><br>

When a specific catalyst component described in the present application is used, catalyst activity is high, and a propylene-base block copolymer can be produced in high productivity, however, catalyst activity at the second stage is also high, which increases the frequency of gel or fish-eye<br><br>
troubles to happen. Therefore, by the addition of a killing agent, good appearance of a molded body can be achieved without impairing high catalytic activity, which is one of the characteristics of the present invention.<br>
Here, an explanation will be given in detail on a process using a horizontal reactor as a preferable embodiment of the gas-phase processes where the reaction heat is removed mainly by the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene used in the present invention, with reference to FIG. 1.<br>
A horizontal reactor 10 is slender, having the upstream end 12 and the downstream end 14, which is installed generally at a horizontal position, as shown in FIG. 1. A reaction in the reactor is conducted almost in the plug flow. A shaft 19 extends into the downstream end 14 of the reactor 10, and wings for the agitation are fixed onto it inside the reactor 10. The agitating wings mixes polymer particles, inside the reactor 10, and other substances introduced therein. The catalyst components introduced from the pipelines 1 and 2 in the upstream area of the reactor 10, initiate polymerization while mixed with the polymer particles by the agitating wings. In polymerization, the heat of polymerization generated is removed by the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene as the raw material supplied from the top part pipeline 17. Unreacted propylene gas is discharged from the reaction system by a pipeline 13, and a part thereof is condensed by a condenser 15, and separated into a liquid part and a gas part in a vapor-liquid separation tank 11.  The liquid part is introduced into the pipeline 17 for<br><br>
removing the heat of polymerization, and the gas part is mixed with hydrogen or the like for controlling the molecular weight, and supplied via a pipeline 18 installed at the bottom part of the reactor 10.<br>
FIG. 2 is the other preferable embodiment used in the present invention, and a schematic drawing of a process with two horizontal reactors used in a gas-phase process for two stages of polymerization composed of the first stage where propylene is homo-polymerization or co-polymerized with one or more kinds of comonomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene and C4 to Cs a-olefins to copolymerization; and the second stage where propylene and one or more kinds of comonomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene and C4 to Cs a-olefins in the higher ratio of the said comonomer than that at the first stage.<br>
Fig. 3 is the other preferable embodiment used in the present invention, and a schematic drawing of a process with vertical reactors used in a gas-phase process for two stages of polymerization. In addition, in the case of using in a gas-phase process for single stage, it is possible to operate a variable-type pipeline 316.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, in general, each of the reactors is installed at a horizontal position. Shafts 315 and 325 extend to an upper part of each of the reactors 10 and 20, and a wing for the agitation is attached each inside the reactors 10 and 20. The agitating wings mixes, inside the reactors 10 and 20, the polymer particles with other substances introduced thereto.<br><br>
In the vertical reactor similarly, the heat of polymerization generated in polymerization is removed by the heat of liquefied propylene as the raw material supplied from bottom part pipelines 314 and 324. Unreacted propylene gas is discharged into the circulation system by pipelines 311 and 321, condensed by condensers 312 and 322, and then cooled by compressors 313 and 323 to be supplied as raw material of liquefied propylene. Hydrogen for controlling the molecular weight, and one or more kinds of comonomers selected from the group consisting of ethylene and C4 to Cg a-olefins are supplied via pipelines 4 and 6.<br>
[Ill] Polypropylene (a propylene-based polymer)<br>
Polypropylene obtained by using the present invention is one produced in the low production cost and is excellent in processability and quality. In particular, a production method for polypropylene having high MFR value, in high quality and in the low cost, is disclosed in the present invention.<br>
In addition, because polypropylene obtained by using the present invention contains less of an amorphous component, which is represented by an index such as cold-xylene soluble (CXS), it has characteristics of less frequency of molding troubles to happen such as smoking, gum, mold contamination, resin burning. It also has high crystallinity and excellent rigidity of a molded product due to the low content of the amorphous component. Furthermore, it also shows high melting point and excellent heat resistance.<br>
Furthermore, polypropylene obtained by using the present invention is a propylene homopolymer (i) and a copolymer of<br><br>
propylene and other comonomers. The copolymer may be a random copolymer (ii) or a block copolymer (ill) . Explanation will be given in detail on each polymer.<br>
(i) A propylene homopolymer<br>
When polypropylene in the present invention is a propylene homopolymer, a MFR value thereof is preferably equal to or higher than 50 g/10 minutes, more preferably within the range of 50 g/10 minutes to 1, 000 g/10 minutes, still more preferably within the range of 60 g/10 minutes to 800 g/10 minutes, and most preferably within the range of 100 g/10 minutes to 500 g/10 minutes. A CXS value is preferably equal to or lower than 3% by weight, more preferably within the range of 0.1% by weight to 2% by weight, and still more preferably within the range of 0.2% by weight to 1.5% by weight.<br>
Here, a CXS value is defined as a value measured by the following method.<br>
A sample (about 5 g) is once dissolved completely in p-xylene (300 ml) at 140°C. Then, the solution is cooled to 23°C to precipitate a polymer at 23°C for 12 hours. The precipitated polymer is filtrated and then p-Xylene is evaporated from the filtrate. The residual polymer after evaporation of p-xylene was dried under the reduced pressure at 100°C for 2 hours. The polymer after drying is weighed to obtain the value of CXS as % by weight with respect to the sample.<br>
In order to adjust a MFR value, concentration of hydrogen, which is a chain transfer agent, in the polymerization reactor may be adjusted. At the higher hydrogen concentration, the<br><br>
higher MFR value of a polypropylene homopolymer is achieved, and vice versa. If the catalyst of the present invention is employed, the higher MFR value can be achieved at the relatively low concentration of hydrogen, and furthermore, polypropylene having high stereoregularity and the low CXS value can be produced, even at the high MFR value. In order to reduce CXS further within the range designated in the present invention, it is effective to use at least one group consisting of compounds selected from the organosilicon compound (C) , the compound having at least two ether bonds (D) , and the compound (E) having a C(=0)N bond in the molecule, as the optional components. The higher amount of these optional components is used, the lower CXS value of a polypropylene homopolymer can be achieved.<br>
(ii) A random copolymer<br>
When polypropylene in the present invention is a random copolymer of propylene and other monomers, it is desirable that the other monomers are ethylene and/or a C4 to Cio a-olef in; more preferably ethylene and/or 1-butene, and most preferably ethylene. It is desirable that a content of a monomer unit other than propylene in the random copolymer is equal to or lower than 10% by weight; more preferably within the range of 0 . 01% by weight to 8% by weight, still more preferably within the range of 0.05% by weight to 6% by weight, and particularly preferably within the range of 0.1% by weight to 5% by weight.<br>
Here, the content of these other monomers can be determined by an arbitrary analysis method. As a specific example, infrared spectrophotometry (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) or the like may be included.<br><br>
Here, as the monomer other than propylene, which is used in the random copolymer of the present invention, it is not especially limited, however, a C2 to C12 olefin, in particular, a C2 to C12 a-olef in is preferably used. • Specifically, ethylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene, 1-decene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 3-methyl-l-pentene and the like is included: among them, it is more preferable to use ethylene, 1-butene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, and these olefins may be used not only as singly but also in combination of them.<br>
In order to adjust MFR, in the same manner as in the case of the polypropylene homopolymer, concentration of hydrogen, which is a chain transfer agent, in the polymerization reactor may be adjusted. If the catalyst of the present invention is is employed, the higher MFR value can be achieved at the relatively low concentration of hydrogen, and furthermore, polypropylene having less of sticky components can be produced even at a high MFR value and high comonomer contents. In addition, by using a similar method to those for reducing the CXS value of the polypropylene homopolymer, the amount of the sticky components can be reduced further.<br>
In order to adjust a comonomer content, a concentration of the comonomer in the polymerization reactor may be adjusted.<br>
(iii) A block copolymer<br>
When polypropylene in the present invention is a block copolymer of propylene and other monomers, it is desirable that other monomers is ethylene and/or a C4 to Cio a-olefin, more<br><br>
preferably ethylene and/or 1-butene, and most preferably ethylene.<br>
Here, the block copolymer means a blend of a polymer component mainly composed of propylene, and a random copolymer component composed of propylene and other monomers, and in general, it is produced by the sequential polymerization under the conditions corresponding to each of the components to blend them in a reactor. The polymer component mainly composed of propylene may be the propylene homopolymer or the random copolymer of propylene and other monomers. When the polymer component mainly composed of propylene is the random copolymer of propylene and other monomers, it is desirable that a content of a monomer unit other than propylene in the random copolymer is equal to or lower than 10% by weight. Still more preferably, it is desirable that the content of the monomer unit other than propylene is equal to or lower than 5% by weight, and particularly preferably equal to or lower than 3% by weight. Most preferably, it is desirable that the polymer component mainly composed of propylene is the propylene homopolymer.<br>
It is desirable that a content of a propylene unit in the random copolymer is within the range of 10% by weight to 90% by weight, in the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers. More preferably, it is desirable that the content of the propylene unit is within the range of 15% by weight to 85% by weight, and particularly preferably within the range of 20% by weight to 80% by weight. Most preferably, the content of the propylene unit is within the range of 30% by weight to 70% by weight.<br><br>
For the weight ratio of the polymer component mainly composed of propylene to the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers in the block copolymer, an arbitrary value is applicable. Preferably, it is desirable that a content of the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers in the block copolymer is within the range of 2 % by weight to 95% by weight. More preferably, it is desirable that the content of the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers in the block copolymer is within the range of 2 % by weight to 85% by weight, and particularly preferably, within the range of 5 % by weight to 75% by weight. Most preferably, it is desirable that the content of the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers in the block copolymer is within the range of 10 % by weight to 65% by weight.<br>
It is desirable that an MFR value of the block copolymer of propylene and other monomers is equal to or higher than 30 g/10 minutes. More preferably, it is desirable that the MFR is within the range of 40 g/10 minutes to 1,000 g/10 minutes, and still more preferably, within the range of 50 g/10 minutes to 500 g/10 minutes. Too much low MFR values impair the processability of injection molding or the like, while too much high MFR values impair the properties such as impact resistance or the like. It is desirable that the MFR value of the polymer component mainly composed of propylene is equal to or higher than 50 g/10 minutes. More preferably, it is desirable that the MFR value is within the range of 50 g/10 minutes to 1,000 g/10 minutes, still more preferably, within the range of 60 g/10 minutes to 800 g-/10 minutes, and most preferably within the range<br><br>
of 100 g/10 minutes to 500 g/10 minutes. The CSX value is equal to or lower than 3% by weight, preferably within the range of 0.1% by weight to 2% by weight, and still more preferably within the range of 0.2% by weight to 1.5% by weight.<br>
The random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers may have an arbitrary MFR value. Specifically, the MFR value of the random copolymer component is uniquely determined from the relationship of the MFR value of the block copolymer, the MFR value of the polymer component mainly composed of propylene, and the weight ratio of the polymer component mainly composed of propylene to the random copolymer component composed of propylene and other monomers . Therefore, it is a usual method that the MFR of the random copolymer is controlled to the desirable value for the purpose of controlling the above three values to the desired ones.<br>
A method for adjusting the MFR value is similar to those for the propylene homopolymer and the random copolymer of propylene and other monomers. For the CXS value of the polymer component composed of mainly propylene, it may be adjusted in the same manner as in the case of the propylene homopolymer. For the comonomer content in the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers, it may be adjusted in the same manner as in the case of the random copolymer of propylene and other monomers. For the content of the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers in the block copolymer, it may be adjusted by using a known arbitrary method. Specifically, in order to increase the content of the random copolymer component of propylene and other monomers, the<br><br>
activity may be enhanced by increasing the pressure or prolonging the residence time in the polymerization reactor for producing the component, and vice versa.<br>
Because polypropylene having high MFR values can be produced in high productivity by using the present invention, it is superior in view of achieving without CR treatment as compared with a conventional method. In a conventional production method, because it is difficult to produce polypropylene having high MFR values in high productivity, such a method is generally used that polypropylene having low MFR values is produced (in high productivity) , and then this polypropylene having low MFR values is treated with a radical initiator such as a peroxide in the pelletization or the like to increase MFR values. Usually this treatment with a peroxide or the like is called CR treatment. This CR treatment is capable of increasing MFR values of polypropylene, however, because of a byproduct of a decomposed compound such as a peroxide, it has a problem that the quality of polypropylene is deteriorated in view of odor, hue, taste or the like. In addition, when CR treatment is conducted on the block copolymer of propylene and other monomers, it also has a problem of the enhanced frequency of gel generation caused by cross-linking of the random copolymer component. Therefore, the present invention that is capable of producing polypropylene having high MFR values in high productivity without CR treatment, is highly superior to a conventional technology.<br>

(Example 1)<br>
(1) Preparation of a solid component<br>
The atmosphere of the autoclave with an inner volume of 10 L, equipped with the agitator, was sufficiently replaced with nitrogen, and 2 L of purified toluene was introduced therein. Into the autoclave, 200 g of Mg(0Et)2, and 1 L of TiCl4 were introduced at room temperature. After it was heated up to 90°C, 50 mL of di-n-butyl phthalate was introduced.  Then, the reaction was conducted for 3 hours at 110°C.  The reaction product was sufficiently washed with purified toluene. Then, purified toluene was introduced to adjust the total liquid amount to 2L. One liter of TiCl4 was added at room temperature, and it was heated up to 110°C to react for 2 hours. The reaction product was sufficiently washed with purified toluene. Then, purified toluene was introduced to adjust the total liquid amount to 2L. One liter of TiCl4 was added at room temperature, and it was heated up to 110°C to react for 2 hours. The reaction product was sufficiently washed with purified toluene. Furthermore, by purified n-heptane, toluene was replaced with n-heptane to obtain the slurry of the solid component (Al). A part of the slurry was sampled and dried. As a result of analysis, Ti content of the solid component (Al) was 2.7% by weight.<br>
Then, the atmosphere of the autoclave with an inner volume of 20 L, equipped with the agitator, was sufficiently replaced with nitrogen, and the slurry of the above solid component (Al) was measured and introduced therein corresponding to 100 g of<br><br>
the solid component (Al). By introducing purified n-heptane, the concentration of the solid component (Al) was adjusted to 25 g/L. Then, 50 mL of SiCl^ was added and reacted at 90°C for 1 hour. The reaction product was sufficiently washed with purified n-heptane.<br>
After that, purified n-heptane was introduced to adjust the liquid level "to 4 L. Into the slurry, 30 mL of dimethyldivinylsilane, 30 mL of (i-Pr) 2Si (OMe) 2 and a solution of EtaAl (TEA) in n-heptane corresponding to 80 g of EtsAl, were added to react at 40°C for 2 hours. The reaction product was sufficiently washed with purified n-heptane, and a part of the obtained slurry was sampled and dried. As a result of analysis, the solid component was found to contain 1.2% by weight of Ti, and 8.8% by weight of (i-Pr)2Si(OMe)2 .<br>
(2) Pre-polymerization<br>
With the solid component obtained in the above, pre-polymerization was conducted by the following procedure. Purified n-heptane was introduced into the above slurry to adjust the concentration of the solid component to 20 g/L. After the slurry was cooled to 10°C, a solution of EtsAl in n-heptane corresponding to 10 g of EtsAl was added, and 280 g of propylene was supplied in 4 hours. After the propylene supply, the reaction was continued for further 30 minutes. Then, a gas part was sufficiently replaced with nitrogen and the reaction product was sufficiently washed with purified n-heptane.

The solid catalyst component (A) was found to contain 2.5 g of polypropylene per<br><br>
1 g of the solid component. As a result of analysis, the solid catalyst component (A) was found to contain 1.0% by weight of Ti and 8.2% by weight of (i-Pr) 2Si (OMe) 2 in the solid component without pre-polymer.<br>
(3) Polymerization of propylene<br>
Explanation will be given with reference to the flow sheet shown in attached FIG. 4. A gas-phase polymerization reactor with two polymerization reactors was used. The two polymerization reactors 10 and 20 are continuous horizontal gas-phase polymerization reactors (length/diameter=3.7) equipped with the agitator having an inner diameter D of 34 0 mm, a length L of 1260 mm, a diameter of the rotating shaft of 90 mm and an inner volume of 110 dm"'.<br>
After replacing the atmosphere of the polymerization reactor 10 with nitrogen, 25 kg of polypropylene powder (the average particle size of 1500 \im) previously removed the polymer particles whose sizes are equal to or smaller than 500 ^m was introduced, and the solid catalyst component (A) obtained in the above was continuously supplied into the polymerization reactor 10 in the form of n-hexane slurry. The feed rate of the solid catalyst component (A) was adjusted so that the production rate of polypropylene became constant. In addition, the n-hexane solution of 15% by weight of triethylaluminum was continuously supplied in the molar ratio of 100 with respect to a Ti atom in the catalyst component (A) . In addition, hydrogen was supplied into the polymerization reactor 10 so that the ratio of hydrogen concentration to propylene concentration in the polymerization reactor 10 became 0.08, and a propylene<br><br>
monomer was supplied into the polymerization reactor 10 so that the pressure and temperature in the polymerization reactor 10 were maintained to 2.2 MPa and 65°C, respectively. Unreacted gas exhausted from the polymerization reactor 10 was discharged from the reactor system through a pipeline 404 for exhausting unreacted gas, and cooled, condensed, and separated into liguefied propylene and mixed gases. The mixed gases were returned to the polymerization reactor 10 through a pipeline 402 for recycling gas. In addition, hydrogen gas for adjusting the molecular weight of the propylene-based polymer was also supplied from the pipeline 402. Liquefied propylene condensed outside the reactor system was supplied from a pipeline 403 for supplying raw material mixed gases, together with fresh raw material propylene. The heat of polymerization was removed by the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene supplied from the pipeline 403.<br>
Polypropylene produced in the polymerization reactor 10 was continuously discharged from the polymerization reactor 10 through a pipeline 411 for discharging a polymer to keep the level of a polymer at 50% of the reaction volume, and supplied to the polymerization reactor 20 for the second polymerization stage.<br>
A polymer and propylene gas from the first polymerization stage were continuously supplied into the polymerization reactor 20 to conduct propylene polymerization. Reaction conditions were the set of the temperature of 65°C and the pressure of 2.0 MPa. Unreacted gas exhausted from the polymerization reactor 20 was discharged from the reactor system through a pipeline 407 for exhausting unreacted gas, and cooled.<br><br>
condensed, and separated into liquefied propylene and mixed gases. The mixed gases were returned to the polymerization reactor 20 through a pipeline 405 for recycling gas . In addition, hydrogen gas, for adjusting the molecular weight of a propylene-based polymer, was also supplied from the pipeline 405. In this case, the ratio of hydrogen concentration to propylene concentration was adjusted to the same value as that of the polymerization reactor 10. Liquefied propylene condensed outside the reactor system was supplied from a pipeline 406 for raw material mixed gases, together with fresh raw material propylene. The heat of polymerization was removed by the heat of vaporization of liquefied propylene supplied from the pipeline 406.<br>
Polypropylene produced in the second polymerization stage was continuously discharged from the polymerization reactor 20 through a pipeline 413 for discharging a polymer to keep the level of a polymer at 60% of the reaction volume. Discharged powders and gases were separated at a degassing tank 40, and a powder part was transferred to a recovery system. Production rate of propylene was 15 kg/hr, average residence time in the polymerization reactor 10 was 1.6 hr, and average residence time in the polymerization reactor 20 was 1.0 hr. Activity was calculated by dividing the production rate with the feed rate of the solid catalyst component (A) (without pre-polymer), and found to be 50,000 g-PP/g-catalyst.<br>
As a result of analysis of the obtained polypropylene, the MFR value was 120 g/10 minutes, and the CXS value was 1.6 % by weight. BD of the polypropylene particles was measured and found to be 0.45 g/ml.<br><br>
(Examples 2 to 5)<br>
Polymerization was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1 with the solid catalyst component (A) of Example 1 except for employing the polymerization conditions shown in Table 1. In Example 4 and Example 5, a silicon compound described in the Table was continuously supplied into the polymerization reactor 1. Results are shown in Table 1.<br>
(Example 6)<br>
According to Example 1, a propylene-ethylene block copolymer was produced, instead of a propylene homopolymer. In this case, in the polymerization reactor 10, homopolymerization of propylene was conducted in the same manner as in Example 1, and in the polymerization reactor 20, copolymerization of propylene and ethylene was conducted by using mixture gas of propylene and ethylene, instead of a propylene monomer. Production amount of the copolymer in the polymerization reactor 20 was adjusted by the amount of oxygen supplied from a pipeline 408 for adding an activity inhibitor. Content of the propylene-ethylene copolymer in the final product was determined by the total production rate and the production rate in the polymerization reactor 10. In addition, ethylene content in the propylene-ethylene copolymer produced in the polymerization reactor 20 was calculated from ethylene content of the final product and the content of the propylene-ethylene copolymer in the final product. Polymerization conditions and results are shown in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
