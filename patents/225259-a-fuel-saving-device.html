				<td>DEVICE FOR SAVING FUEL AND REDUCING EMISSIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a device for saving fuel in combustion<br>
engines and reducing emissions, e.g. gaseous Omissions to the atmosphere.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
This invention relates particularly but not exclusively to a device<br>
for saving fuel and reducing emissions for use on internal combustion<br>
engines, e.g.. normally aspirated engines and engines with fuel injectors. It<br>
will therefore bo convenient to describe the invention with reference to these<br>
example applications.<br>
However, it is to be dearly understood that tho invention is<br>
capable of broader application.<br>
For example, the invention can be applied to any combustion<br>
engine and not just motor vehicle engines.<br>
Incomplete combustion of liquid fuels increases the cost of<br>
running engines. Further unburned fuel e.g. hydrocarbons are vented to the<br>
atmosphere through tho exhaust and are generally harmful to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
Some of the gases emitted into the atmosphere include carbon<br>
monoxide, various nitrogen oxides, and unburned hydrocarbons.<br>
Naturally therefore any device which acted to decrease fuel<br>
consumption and thereby lower the running costs of n vehicle as well as<br>
lowering the pollution released to the atmosphere would be a major advance<br>
in the art and would be most advantageous to society generally.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect of this invention there is provided a fuel<br>
saving device including magnetic means for applying a magnetic force to a<br>
mixture of fuel dropiets in air which is used to energise an engine prior to its<br>
introduction to the engine, the magnetic moans being located intermediate<br>
fuel/air mixing means and a manifold leading to the engine.<br>
Thus the magnet means applies a force to the droptots causing<br>
the droplets to be reduced in size which in turn leads to more complete<br>
combustion and less pollution<br>
Large droplets above a predetemined size tend to be<br>
susceptible to incomplete combustion.<br>
Typically the engine to which this engine is applied is a normally<br>
aspirated engine, e.g. a petrol internal combustion engine, and the device is<br>
located between the carburettor and a common inlet manifold leadiny to the<br>
cylinders.<br>
Alternatively, the engine may have fuel injection with the device<br>
being positioned upstream of the fuel injectors.<br>
In one form the device may ho associated with a fuel rail. In<br>
another form, the device may be positioned intermediate the fuel rail and the<br>
injectors.<br>
The device may include a support, e.g. a spacer, defining a<br>
passage for (he fuel air mixture which is coupled in series with the rest of the<br>
fuel line.<br>
Typically, the magnetic means comprises a plurality of magnets,<br>
e.g. permanent magnets, mounted on the support.<br>
In a preferred form, there arc an even number of magnets<br>
mounted on the support with the poles of the magnets reversed relative to<br>
each other.<br>
Preferably the device has at least four magnets with the poles of<br>
adjacent magnets being reversed relative to each other.<br>
In a preferred form, the N/S axis of the magnets is arranged<br>
broadly in the direction of the fuel/air passageway through the device, i.e. the<br>
axis is longitudinally arranged.<br>
However. It Is to be borne in mind that in some embodiments the<br>
N/S axis of the magnet may be transverse to the fuel/air passageway through<br>
the support.<br>
Preferably, the magnets may be spaced opart from each other<br>
around the circumference of the fuel/air passageway.<br>
However, it should also be borne in mind that the magnets may<br>
be axially spacod apart from each other, e.g. in the direction of the fuel/air<br>
passageway<br>
Advantageously, the magnets are powerful magnels. e.g. rare<br>
earth magnels.<br>
Preferably the magnets are neodymium iron boron magnets and<br>
even more preferably specific grades of these magnets.<br>
In a most preferred form an N-30 grade magnet supplied by A<br>
MAGNETIC FORCE based in Warrlewood in New South Wales, Australia is<br>
used.<br>
The rare earth magnets described above produce high strength<br>
magnetic fields. This enhances the magnetic force which is applied to the fuel<br>
droplets as they pass through the device. This enhances the breaking up or<br>
size reduction of the droplets as they pass through the device.<br>
While neodymium iron boron magnets are particularly preferred,<br>
applicant believes that other magnets may also be used although they will not<br>
produce as affective a result, e.g. AINiCo magnets.<br>
Naturally, the size of the magnets will influence the strength of<br>
the magnetic field genorated in the fuel air passageway. In one particular<br>
form, each magnet has a cross sectional surface area in the range of 20-<br>
50mm x 20-S0mm. This will suffice to produce a suitable magnetic field In a<br>
fuel air passageway having a diameter of 22 mm to 40mm, preferably about<br>
25mm or 38mm. The depth or thickness of the magnet will typically be 10-<br>
30mm, the actual depth being influenced by the thickness of the spacer in<br>
which the magnet is received. It will be appreciated however that the size of<br>
the magnets can vary.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there i6<br>
provided a fuel saving device comprising a support body having a centralised<br>
opening therein, a plurality of radially spaced magnets associated with the<br>
body and disposed about tho circumference of the opening and in an<br>
arrangement which provides a continuous magnetic fleld across the opening.<br>
The support body can be disc-like and is provided with a plurality<br>
of apertures therein to facilitate the fixture of the body in a fuel/air line leading<br>
to a combustion chamber of an internal combustion engine line.<br>
Suitably rha support body can be provided with top ane bottom<br>
cover plates winch secure the magnets against displacement via top and<br>
bottom surfaces of the support body<br>
The magnets can be secured to the suppo/l body by key slots of<br>
a complimentary shape.<br>
An even number of magnets can be provided with the polls of<br>
the magnets reversed relative to each other.<br>
The device can have foul magnets spaced substantially<br>
equidistantly about the circumference of a circular opening in the support<br>
body, arranged at approximately 90o apart from each other.<br>
The device can include six magnets spaced substantially<br>
equidistantly about the circumferenco of a substantially oval shaped opening<br>
in the support body.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention them is<br>
provided a fuel saving system for an internal combustion engine comprising a<br>
single or double throat carburettor and a fuel saving device as aforesaid<br>
positioned between the carburettor and an inlet to a combustion chamber of<br>
the engine.<br>

Figures 11 to 13 Illustrate examples of installation situs for the<br>
device of the present invention in typical motor vehicle engine fuel systems.<br>
In Figs. 1 to 3 reference numeral 1 refers generally to a fuel<br>
saving and emission control device in accordance with the invention<br>
Broadly, the device 1 comprises a support 2 in the form of a<br>
flattened rectangular block defining a fuel/air passageway 3 therethrough<br>
A plurality ot permanent magnets 4 are arranged around the<br>
circumference of the possageway 3<br>
Fig. 1 shows recesses or apertures without magnets fitted or<br>
inserted for clarity.<br>
Each magnet is a ncodymium iron boron magnet. These are<br>
recently developed high power permanent magnets.<br>
The specifications of liese magnets are available from the<br>
Australian based supplier mentioned eaerier.<br>
The arrangement of the North-South Poles of the magnets 4 are<br>
shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The polar axes arc arranged generally in the direction of the<br>
air/fuel passageway.<br>
Adjacent magnets have opposed N-S orientations as shown in<br>
the drawings.<br>
in use the support 2 is coupled in line with the carburettor and<br>
common inlet manifold of an internal combustion engine such that the fuel air<br>
mixture passes through the passageway 3 therein.<br>
This exposes fuel droplets passing from the carourottor to the<br>
manifold to the magnetic field of the magnets causing the droplets to reduce<br>
in size.<br>
This leads to more complete combustion when the fuel enters<br>
the cylinder causing lower fuel consumption and less exhaust gas pollution.<br>
Without being bound by theory, applicant believes that the<br>
magnetic forces applied to the fuel droplets by the magnetic fields of the<br>
various magnets acts to substantially reduce the size of the droplets.<br>
The applicant believes that the strong magnetic flelds break<br>
down the siza of the droplets and that the droplets may be reduced in size to<br>
as low as 3 micron diameter.<br>
As a result, the fuel droplets have a substantially greater surface<br>
area in contact with the air and the subsequent combustion reaction in the<br>
cylinder is more complete and more efficient.<br>
It is closer to a complete burn where all the hydrocarbons react<br>
with oxygen.<br>
Experiments conducted by the applicant show that the device<br>
does reduce substantially the number nf large droplets of fuel passing Into the<br>
cylinder<br>
Experiments have also shown that the use of the device leads to<br>
reduced fuel consumption.<br>
Experiments also show that some forms of the device<br>
substantially reduce CO, CO2 and NO* emission levels.<br>
While the fuel consumption savings have been emphasised the<br>
reduction in emissions are also significant and important<br>
The applicant has achieved fuel savings of up to 63% with a<br>
preferred device according to the invention on a four cylinder petrol engine.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates a device in accordance with a second possible<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The device is structurally and functionally very similar to that in<br>
Fig. 3 and unless otherwise indicated the same reference numerals are used<br>
to refer to the same components.<br>
The device is used on a vehicle with a twin throat carburettor.<br>
This explains why It has an elongate oval passage of substantially greater<br>
cross sectional surface area than the Fig. 1 embodiment.<br>
Another structural difference between this device and the Fig. 1<br>
device is the six magnets arranged around the circumference of the<br>
passageway.<br>
This provides a magnetic field across the larger cross sectional<br>
surface urea of the passageway comparable to that of the four magnets of the<br>
Fig. 1 device.<br>
Fig. 5 Illustrates a device in accordance with yet another<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
In this arrangement ttie magnets 4 are (which may be layered)<br>
are of substantially C-shaped configuration<br>
In the case of the devices illustrated by fiyures 1 to 6 fixture<br>
apertures 2a of various shapes and in various positions can be provided in the<br>
supports 2.<br>
Top and bottom cover plates (not shown) can be provided to<br>
secure the magnets against displacement via the top and bottom surfaces of<br>
the body 2.<br>
Fig. 6 illustrates a device in accordance with yet another<br>
embodiment of the. invention. This device has some fundamental structural<br>
differences over the previously described embodiments.<br>
Specifically, the magnets 4 are arranged with their North-South<br>
axes transverse to the fuel/air passageway 3. In the previous embodiments<br>
the North-South axes were parallel to the fuel air passageway In essence a<br>
plurality of magnets 4 are arranged head to toe around the circumference of<br>
the passageway with smalt spacings between adjacent magnets.<br>
in the illustrated device there are six magnets 4 spaced apart<br>
around the circumference of the support 1.<br>
The polos of adjacent magnets are opposed, i.e. the North Pole<br>
of one magnet is adjacent the South Pole of the adjacent magnet.<br>
This pattern Is continued around the circumference of the flow<br>
passage 3.<br>
While six magnets have been shown in this embodiment this<br>
precise number is not critical.<br>
Another feature of this embodiment is that there is only a single<br>
layer of magnets 4 in the fuel air passageway.<br>
Fig. 7 illustrates yet another embodiment similar to the<br>
embodiment in Fig. 6.<br>
The crucial difference between the Fig. 6 and the Fig. 7<br>
embodiment is that it has a plurality of layers of magnets 4 which are<br>
longitudinally spaced from each other.<br>
Each layer comprises a plurality of magnets, eg. two magnets 4,<br>
arranged relative to each other as with the previous embodiment.<br>
The magnets are mceived Within a sleeve 5, e.g. of copper,<br>
aluminium, steel or other material having slots 6 defined therein. The sleeve 5<br>
is then passed into a housing (not shown) which is mounted inline with a fuel<br>
line<br>
The housing typically has flanged ends (not shown) for attaching<br>
it to the adjacent components. The slcevos 5 and magnet 4 are sized to be<br>
received within the housing with a small clearance.<br>
Figs. 8 to 10 illustrate a fuel saving device for use on a fuel<br>
injection system as distinct from a carburettor system.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates a device mounted on a centre point injector<br>
system. More specifically, the device Is fitted intermediate (he fuel injection<br>
fuel rail and the injector.<br>
A device will typically be installed for each injector.<br>
The fuel saving device is only illustrated schematically in the<br>
drawings.<br>
The structure and function thereof however is similar to mat<br>
described above with reference to anyone of Figs. 1 to 0.<br>
Fig. 9 illustrates a device which is incorporated into the injector<br>
fuel rail.<br>
The device comprises a plurality of magnets 4 spaced apart<br>
around the periphery of the fuel rail as shown in the drawings.<br>
With this embodiment, a single device serves all injectors. By<br>
contrast with the Fig. 8 embodiment, there is a separate device for each<br>
Injector.<br>
Fig. 10 illustrates a fuel saving device which is mounted in the<br>
head, e.g. of the cylinder, adjacent the inlet<br>
The fuel saving device will be mounted in each of the cylinders<br>
to achieve the fuel saving and emission reduction otfoct therein.<br>
While tho Illustrated device has six magnets, this number is not<br>
essential. It might equally hove two or four magnets.<br>
Where the device i* fitted to a hoad the device may be fitted to a<br>
round or square support which receives square ui round magnets, and the<br>
support may provide an internally threaded mounting, for receiving and<br>
securing a fuel injector valve. Alternatively similar arrangements may be built<br>
into hood cylinders when engines are manufactured<br>
Figures 11 to 13 of the drawings indicate specific installation<br>
sites for the device of the present invention.<br>
In figure 11 in an electronic fuel system the device can be<br>
inserted in either of the positions "X" being at the opening to a combustion<br>
chamber adjacent an injector 7 and/or in the air line 8 preceding the injector 7.<br>
In figure 12 a typical mechanical Injection system the device can<br>
be positioned at sites "X" to either side of the injector 7.<br>
In figure 13 being that of a typical inlet manifold 9 of a four-<br>
cylinder engine the device can be interposed at site "X" hetween the<br>
carburetor 10 and common inlet of the manifold 11.<br>
Applicant has found its fuel saving and emission device to be<br>
highly effective.<br>
A particular advantage of the device is that it is of relatively<br>
simple structure, ran easily be manufactured, and can he retrofitted to<br>
existing motor vehicles.<br>
The device is most effective on carburettor and centrepoirtt<br>
injection systems, however It docs have application to other systems such as<br>
fuel injection systems.<br>
The device can be used on the exhaust of a diesel engine where<br>
it has been found to reduce exhaust emissions, e.g. Including black smoke.<br>
The following is a typical example of comparative emission<br>
levels from recent tests on comhustion engines showing levels of emissions<br>
with and without a device of the present invention installed in a fuel system.<br>
II will of course he realised that Uto above has been given by<br>
way of illustrative examples of the invention and thai all such modifications<br>
