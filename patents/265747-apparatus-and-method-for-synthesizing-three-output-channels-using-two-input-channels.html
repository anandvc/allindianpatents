				<td>Apparatus and method for synthesizing three output channels<br>
using two input channels<br>
Specification<br>
The present invention is related to multi-channel synthesiz-<br>
ers and, particularly, to devices generating three or more<br>
output channels using two stereo input channels.<br>
Multi-channel audio material is becoming more and more popu-<br>
lar also in the consumer home environment. This is mainly due<br>
to the fact that movies on DVD offer 5.1 multi-channel sound<br>
and therefore even home users frequently install audio play-<br>
back systems, which are capable of reproducing multi-channel<br>
audio. Such a setup consists e.g. of 3 speakers L, C, R in<br>
the front, 2 speakers Ls, Rs in the back and a low frequency<br>
enhancement channel LFE and provides several well-known ad-<br>
vantages over 2-channel stereo reproduction, e.g.:<br>
improved front image stability even outside of the op-<br>
timal central listening position due to the Center<br>
channel (larger "sweet-spot" = optimum listening posi-<br>
tion)<br>
increased sense of listener "involvement" created by<br>
the rear speakers.<br>
Nevertheless, there exists a huge amount of legacy audio con-<br>
tent, which consists only of two ("stereo") audio channels,<br>
e.g. on Compact Discs (CDs).<br>
To play back two-channel legacy audio material over a 5.1<br>
multi-channel setup there are two basic options:<br>
1. Reproduce the left and right channel stereo signals<br>
over the L and R speakers, respectively, i.e., play<br><br>
it back in the legacy way. This solution does not<br>
take advantage of the extended loudspeaker setup<br>
(Center and rear loudspeakers).<br>
2. One may use a method to convert the two channels of<br>
the content material to a multi-channel signal (this<br>
may happen "on the fly" or by means of preprocessing)<br>
that makes use of all the 5.1 speakers and in this<br>
way benefits from the previously discussed advantages<br>
of the multi-channel setup.<br>
Solution #2 clearly has advantages over #1, but also contains<br>
some problems especially with respect to the conversion of<br>
the two front channels (Left and Right = LR) to three front<br>
channels (Multi-channel Left, Center and Right = L'C'R').<br>
A good LR to L'C'R' conversion solution should fulfill the<br>
following requirements:<br>
1)	To recreate a similar, but more stable front image in<br>
the L'C'R' than in the LR playback case, The Center<br>
channel shall reproduce all the sound events which usu-<br>
ally are perceived to come from the middle between the<br>
Left and Right loudspeaker, if the listener is in the<br>
"sweet spot". Furthermore, signals in left front posi-<br>
tions shall be reproduced by L'C, and signals in the<br>
right front positions shall be reproduced by R'C, re-<br>
spectively (see J.M. Jot and C. Avendano, "Spatial En-<br>
hancement of Audio Recordings", AES 23rd Conference,<br>
Copenhagen, 2003).<br>
2)	The sum of the acoustical energy emitted by the chan-<br>
nels L'C'R' should be equal to the sum of the acousti-<br>
cal energy of the source channels LR in order to<br>
achieve an equally loud sound impression for L'C'R as<br>
for LR. Assuming equal characteristics in all reproduc-<br>
tion channels, this translates into "the sum of the<br><br>
electrical energy of the channels L'C'R' should be<br>
equal to the sum of the electrical energy of the source<br>
channels LR."<br>
Due to requirement #1 the signals of the Left and Right chan-<br>
nels may be mixed into one (single) center channel. This is<br>
particularly true, if the Left and the Right channel signals<br>
are near identical, i.e. they represent a phantom sound<br>
source in the middle of the front sound stage. This phantom<br>
image is now replaced by a "real" image generated by the Cen-<br>
ter speaker. Due to requirement #2, this Center signal shall<br>
carry the sum of the Left and the Right energy. If the level<br>
of the Left or the Right channel signals is close to the<br>
maximum amplitude that can be transmitted by the channel (= 0<br>
dBFS; dBFS = dB Full Scale), the sum of the levels of both<br>
channels will exceed the maximum level, which can be repre-<br>
sented by the channel/system. This usually results in the un-<br>
desirable effect of "clipping".<br>
The clipping situation is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 illustrates<br>
a time waveform of a signal 60 processed by a processor hav-<br>
ing a maximum positive threshold 61a and a maximum negative<br>
threshold 61b. Depending on the capability of the digital<br>
processor processing the digital signal, the maximum positive<br>
threshold and the maximum negative thresholds may be +1 and -<br>
1. Alternatively, when a digital processor is used represent-<br>
ing the numbers in integers, the maximum positive threshold<br>
will be 32768 corresponding to 215, and the maximum negative<br>
threshold will be -32768 corresponding to -215.<br>
Since a time waveform signal is represented by a sequence of<br>
samples, each sample being a digital number between -32768<br>
and +32768, it is easily clear that higher numbers can be ob-<br>
tained, when, for a certain time instance, the first channel<br>
has a quite high value and the second channel also has a<br>
quite high value, and when these quite high values are added<br>
together. Theoretically, the maximum number obtained by this<br><br>
adding together of two channels can be 65536. However, the<br>
digital signal processor is not able to represent this high<br>
number. Instead, the digital processor will only represent<br>
numbers equal to the maximum positive threshold or the maxi-<br>
mum negative threshold. Therefore, the digital signal proces-<br>
sor performs clipping in that a number higher or equal to the<br>
maximum positive threshold or the maximum negative threshold<br>
is replaced by a number equal to the maximum positive thresh-<br>
old and the maximum negative threshold so that, with regard<br>
to Fig. 6., the illustrated situation appears. Within a clip-<br>
ping time portion 62, the waveform 60 does not have its natu-<br>
ral (sine) shape, but is flattened or clipped. When this<br>
clipped waveform is evaluated from a spectral point of view,<br>
it becomes clear that this time domain clipping results in<br>
strong harmonic components caused by a high gradient magni-<br>
tude at the beginning and the end of the clipping time por-<br>
tion 62.<br>
This "digital clipping" is not related to the replay setup,<br>
i.e., the amplifier and the loudspeakers used for rendering<br>
the audio signal. However, each amplifier/loudspeaker combi-<br>
nation also has only a limited linear range, and, when this<br>
linear range is exceeded by a processed signal, also a kind<br>
of clipping takes place, which can be avoided using the in-<br>
ventive concept.<br>
In any case, the occurrence of clipping introduces heavy dis-<br>
tortions in the audio signal, which degrade the perceived<br>
sound quality very much. Thus, the occurrence of clipping has<br>
to be avoided. This is even more due to the fact that the<br>
sound improvement by rendering a stereo signal by a multi-<br>
channel setup such as a 5.1 speaker system is small compared<br>
to the very annoying clipping distortions. Therefore, when<br>
one cannot guaranty that clipping does not occur, one would<br>
prefer to only use the left and the right speakers of a<br>
multi-channel setup for rendering a stereo signal.<br><br>
There exist prior art solutions to overcome this clipping<br>
problem.<br>
A simple solution to overcome this problem is to scale down<br>
all channels equally to a level where none of the channel<br>
signal (especially the Center signal) exceeds the 0 dBFS<br>
limit. This can be done statically by a predefined fixed<br>
value. In this case the fixed value must also be valid for<br>
worst case situations, where the Left and Right channel have<br>
maximum levels. For the average LR to L'C'R' conversion this<br>
leads to a significantly quieter L'C'R' version than the<br>
original stereo LR, which is undesirable, especially when us-<br>
ers are switching between stereo and multi-channel reproduc-<br>
tion. This behavior can be observed at commercially available<br>
matrix decoders (Dolby ProLogicII and Logic7 Decoder) that<br>
can be used as LR to L'C'R' converters. See Dolby Publica-<br>
tion: "Dolby Surround Pro Logic II Decoder - Principles of<br>
Operation", htp://www.dolby.com/assets/pdf/tech_library/209<br>
_Dolby_Surround_Pro_Logic_II_Decoder_Principles_of_Operation.<br>
pdf or Griesinger, D.: "Multichannel Matrix Surround Decoders<br>
for Two-Eared Listeners", 101st AES Convention, Los Angeles,<br>
USA, 1996, Preprint 4402.<br>
Another simple solution is to use dynamic range compression<br>
in order to dynamically (depending on the signal) limit the<br>
peak signal, sometimes also called a "limiter". A disadvan-<br>
tage of this approach is that the true dynamic range of the<br>
audio program is not reproduced but subjected to compression<br>
(see Digital Audio Effects DAFX; Udo Zolzer, Editor; 2002;<br>
Wiley &amp; Sons; p. 99ff: "Limiter").<br>
The downscaling problem is undesirable, since it reduces the<br>
level or volume of a sound signal compared to the level of<br>
the original signal. In order to completely avoid any even<br>
theoretical occurrence of clipping, one would have to down-<br>
scale all channels by a scaling factor equal to 0.5. This re-<br>
sults in a strongly reduced output level of the multi-channel<br><br>
signal compared to the original signal. When one only listens<br>
to this downscaled multi-channel signal, one can compensate<br>
for this level reduction by increasing the amplification of<br>
the sound amplifier. However, when one switches between sev-<br>
eral sources, the (legacy) stereo signal will appear to a<br>
listener very loud, when it is replayed using the same ampli-<br>
fication setting of the amplifier a set for the multichannel<br>
reproduction.<br>
Thus, a user would have to think about reducing the amplifi-<br>
cation setting of its amplifier before switching from a<br>
multi-channel representation of a stereo signal to a true<br>
stereo representation of the stereo signal in order to not<br>
damage her or his ears or equipment.<br>
The other prior art method using dynamic range compression<br>
effectively avoids clipping. However, the audio signal itself<br>
is changed. Thus, the dynamic compression leads to a non-<br>
authentic audio signal, which, even when the introduced arti-<br>
facts are not too annoying, is questionable from the authen-<br>
ticity point of view.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an im-<br>
proved concept for multi-channel synthesis using two input<br>
channels.<br>
This object is achieved by an apparatus for synthesizing in<br>
accordance with claim 1, a method of synthesizing in accor-<br>
dance with claim 14, a computer program in accordance with<br>
claim 15 or a three channel representation in accordance with<br>
claim 16.<br>
The present invention is based on the finding that, for over-<br>
coming the clipping problem and for nevertheless achieving<br>
the advantages incurred by replaying a stereo signal using<br>
three or more channels of a multi-channel setup, the center<br>
channel is generated as usual, i.e., receives sound events<br><br>
located in the middle between the left and the right loud-<br>
speakers, which is also called a "real center" rendering.<br>
However, when the real center would come into the clipping<br>
range, only a portion of the energy of the signal components<br>
representing the events in the middle of the audio setup are<br>
fed into the center channel. The remainder of the energy of<br>
these sound events is fed back into the first and third (or<br>
left and right) channels or remains there from the beginning.<br>
Thus, for a time frame, where clipping may occur, when the<br>
two/three upmix procedure is performed without modifications,<br>
the center channel is scaled down the level below or equal to<br>
the maximum level possible without clipping. Nevertheless,<br>
the missing part/energy of the signal, which cannot be ren-<br>
dered by the center channel is reproduced with the left chan-<br>
nel and the right channel as a "virtual center" or "phantom<br>
center".<br>
The signal of the real center and the virtual center is then<br>
acoustically combined during playback recreating an intended<br>
center without clipping. This "mixing" of the real center and<br>
the virtual center results in an improved more stable front<br>
image of a stereo audio signal, i.e., in an increased sweet<br>
spot, although the sweet spot is not as large as when there<br>
would not be a phantom center at all. However, the inventive<br>
process does not have any clipping artifacts, since the re-<br>
mainder of the energy not being processable within the second<br>
channel due to the clipping problem is not lost but is ren-<br>
dered by the original left and right channels.<br>
It is noted here that, for any situations, the energy of the<br>
left and right channels in the multi-channel setup is lower<br>
than the energy in the original left and right channels,<br>
since the energy of the center channel is drawn from the left<br>
and right channels. Therefore, even when, in accordance with<br>
the present invention, a remaining part of the energy is fed<br><br>
back to the left and right output channels, there will never<br>
exist a clipping problem within these channels.<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that the in-<br>
ventive signal generation is performed in a way that, in a<br>
preferred embodiment, the total electrical or acoustical en-<br>
ergy of the generated three output channels (and optionally<br>
generated additional output channels such as Ls, Rs, Cs, LFE,<br>
...) is preserved with respect to the energy of the original<br>
stereo signal. The same overall loudness irrespective of the<br>
way of rendering the signal, i.e., whether the signal is ren-<br>
dered using a stereo setup having only two speakers or<br>
whether the signal is rendered using a multi-channel setup<br>
having more than two speakers, can be guaranteed.<br>
Furthermore, the inventive signal generation and distribution<br>
of sound energy to the center channel and the left and right<br>
channels is dynamically applied only if clipping would be un-<br>
avoidable, i.e., the second center channel is completely un-<br>
changed in situations, which are not effected by clipping,<br>
i.e., when sampling values of the second channel remain below<br>
or are only equal to the maximum threshold.<br>
Furthermore, the resulting acoustic combination of the "real<br>
center" and the "phantom center" produces a signal which is<br>
much closer to the optimal three channel configuration, i.e.,<br>
three channels without clipping or three channels in which<br>
sampling values without any min/max threshold are allowable.<br>
The inventive sound image is, therefore, in preferred embodi-<br>
ments neither different in level compared to the stereo input<br>
signal nor non-authentic as would be the case when using a<br>
limiter or a simple clipper.<br>

Fig. 1 illustrates a preferred embodiment of an inventive ap-<br>
paratus for synthesizing three output channels using two in-<br>
put channels, wherein a second channel of the three output<br>
channels is intended for a speaker in an audio replay setup,<br>
which is positioned between two speakers, which are intended<br>
to receive the first output channel and the third output<br>
channel. The input channels are indicated by 10a, which chan-<br>
nel can be for example the left channel L, and 10b for the<br><br><br>
second channel, which can be the right channel R. The output<br>
channels are indicated as 12a for the right channel, 12b for<br>
center channel and 12c for the left channel. Additional out-<br>
put channels can be generated such as a left surround output<br>
channel 14a, a right surround output channel 14b and a low<br>
frequency enhancement channel 14c. The arrangement of the<br>
corresponding speakers for these channels is shown in Fig. 5.<br>
In the middle of these speakers 12a, 12b, 12c, 14a, 14b is a<br>
sweet spot 50. When a listener is positioned within the sweet<br>
spot, then he or she will have an optimum sound impression.<br>
Additionally, one might add a center surround channel 51 Cs,<br>
which is positioned between the left surround channel 14a and<br>
the right surround channel 14b. The signal for the center<br>
surround channel 51 can be calculated using the same process<br>
as calculating the signal for the center channel 12b. Addi-<br>
tionally, the inventive methods can, therefore, also be ap-<br>
plied to the calculation of the center surround channel in<br>
order to avoid clipping in the center surround channel.<br>
It is to be noted that the inventive process is usable for<br>
each audio channel constellation, in which two input channels<br>
intended for two different spatial positions in a replay<br>
setup are used and in which three output channels are gener-<br>
ated using these two input channels, wherein the second chan-<br>
nel of the three channels is located between two additional<br>
speakers in the replay setup, which are provided with the<br>
first and the third input channel signals.<br>
The inventive synthesizer apparatus of Fig. 1 includes an in-<br>
put channel analyzer 15 for analyzing the two input channels<br>
in order to determine signal components which occur in both<br>
input channels. These signal components which occur in both<br>
input channels can be used to build the real center channel,<br>
i.e. can be rendered via the center channel C shown in Fig.<br>
5. Typically, a stereo signal includes a lot of such mono-<br>
phonic signal components such as a speaker person or, when<br><br><br>
music signals are considered, a singer or a solo instrument<br>
positioned in front of an orchestra and, therefore, posi-<br>
tioned in front of the audience.<br>
The inventive synthesizer apparatus additionally includes a<br>
time and frequency selective and, furthermore signal depend-<br>
ent signal generator 16 for generating the three output chan-<br>
nels 12a, 12b, 12c using the two input channels 10a, 10b and<br>
information on detected signal components occurring in both<br>
input channels as provided via line 13. Particularly, the in-<br>
ventive signal generator is operative to feed detected signal<br>
components at least partly into the second channel. Further-<br>
more, the generator is operative to only feed a portion of<br>
the detected signal components in the second channel, when<br>
there exists a situation, in which a complete feeding of the<br>
detected signal components would result in exceeding the<br>
maximum threshold.<br>
Thus, the second output channel has a time portion, which<br>
only includes a part of the detected signal components to<br>
avoid clipping, while in a different portion of the second<br>
output channel, the complete detected signal components have<br>
been fed into the second output channel. The remainder of the<br>
detected signal components are included in the first and<br>
third output channels and, therefore, form the "phantom cen-<br>
ter" when these channels are rendered via the speaker setup<br>
for example shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Depending on the implementation of the inventive concept, the<br>
"portion" of the detected signal components located in the<br>
second channel, and the remainder of the detected signal com-<br>
ponents located in the first and third channels can be an en-<br>
ergy portion or frequency portion or any other portion, so<br>
that the second channel only includes a portion of the de-<br>
tected signal components and will not have any value above<br>
the maximum threshold and will, therefore, not induce any<br>
clipping distortions.<br><br><br>
Fig. 2a illustrates a preferred embodiment of the inventive<br>
signal analyzer 16 of Fig. 1. Particularly, in the Fig. 2a<br>
embodiment, the signal analyzer includes a 2-3-upmixer 16<br>
performing an upmixing process controlled by the input chan-<br>
nels analyzer 15 of Fig. 1. The output of the 2-3-upmixer L,<br>
R, C are upmixed channels. However, channel C might be sub-<br>
ject to clipping, since channel C is generated using an add-<br>
ing process, in which signal components from the left channel<br>
and from the right channel are added together.<br>
The center channel C is input into a clipping detector 16d,<br>
which feeds a post processor 16c, which also receives infor-<br>
mation on detected signal components. Particularly, the clip-<br>
ping detector 16b is operative to examine the time wave form<br>
of the center channel 12c.<br>
Depending on the implementation, the clipping detector can be<br>
constructed in different ways. When it is assumed that the<br>
Fig. 2a signal generator can process numbers having a magni-<br>
tude being higher than a predetermined maximum threshold,<br>
then the clipping detector 16b simply examines the time wave-<br>
form to see, whether there are higher numbers than the maxi-<br>
mum threshold of the subsequent processing stage. When such a<br>
situation is detected, the post processor 16c is activated<br>
via activation line 16d to start post processing such that<br>
the energy of the center channel is reduced and the energy of<br>
the left and right channels is increased so that the three<br>
output channels 12a, 12b, 12c are finally output by the post<br>
processor 16c. Thus, in accordance with the Fig. 2a embodi-<br>
ment, the LR to LCR conversion process is done as usual. The<br>
internal first-stage center channel signal 20b is analyzed to<br>
check, whether clipping would occur if it has to be output as<br>
an external signal such as in an AES/EBU or as SPDIF format.<br>
When this happens, a part of the signal 20b is removed in the<br>
post processor 16c resulting in a modified center channel<br>
signal 12b and distributed instead to the intermediate left<br><br><br>
and right channels 20a, 20c as a "phantom center" contribu-<br>
tion. After the postprocessing, the center channel signal 12b<br>
is again below 0 dBFS.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the post processor 16c is shown in<br>
Fig. 2b. The center channel 20b after the upmixer 16a is in-<br>
put into a part extractor 25. The part extractor receives in-<br>
formation 13 on detected signal components and a control sig-<br>
nal via line 16d from the clipping detector, which may also<br>
include an indication of an amount of extraction. Alterna-<br>
tively, the amount of extraction per iteration step may be<br>
fixed independent of any occurring clipping, and an iterative<br>
trial/error process can be applied to extract increasing<br>
amounts of the detected signal components in a step-by-step<br>
fashion until the clipping detector 16b does not detect any<br>
clipping anymore. Then, the modified center channel 12b is<br>
output by the part extractor, and the remainder of the de-<br>
tected signal components corresponding to the extracted part<br>
have to be re-distributed to the left and right channels 20c,<br>
20a output by the upmixer after multiplying by 0.5. To this<br>
end, the post processor includes two multipliers 26 in each<br>
branch or a single multiplier before branching, and a left<br>
adder 27a and a right adder 27b.<br>
When the detection of the signal components occurring in both<br>
input channels has been perfect, then the left and right<br>
channels 20a, 20c do not include any "phantom center". How-<br>
ever, by adding the extracted components (after multiplica-<br>
tion by 0.5) to these channels, a phantom center is added to<br>
the left and right channels.<br>
Subsequently, a further embodiment of the present invention<br>
and, particularly, of the signal generator 16 of Fig. 1 is<br>
discussed in connection with Fig. 3. The input channels are<br>
input into a controllable 2-3-upmixer receiving information<br>
on detected signal components for generating three output<br>
channels in a first iteration step controlled by an iteration<br><br><br>
controller 30. The first step will be equal to the upmixer<br>
operation in Fig. 2a, i.e., the center channel 20b can have<br>
clipping problems. Such a clipping situation will be detected<br>
by a clipping detector 16b. In contrast to the Fig. 2a em-<br>
bodiment, the clipping detector 16b controls the upmixer 16a<br>
in a feed-back way via the upmixer control line 31 to change<br>
the upmixing rule in a certain way so that the generated cen-<br>
ter channel 20b receives, after one or more iteration steps<br>
as controlled by the iteration controller 30, only an allowed<br>
portion of the detected signal components so that no clipping<br>
occurs anymore.<br>
Thus, the Fig. 3 embodiment illustrates an iterative process.<br>
In a first pass of the iterative process, the up-mixer opera-<br>
tion is done as usual. At the output, a detector 16b checks,<br>
whether clipping occurs. When clipping is detected, this time<br>
frame is processed again, now using the re-mapping process<br>
and using re-routing of a part of the center signal energy to<br>
the left and right channels as a phantom center contribution.<br>
The Fig. 4 embodiment completely operates in the parameter<br>
domain. To this end, an up-mixer parameter calculator 40 is<br>
provided, which is connected to a parameter changer 41. Addi-<br>
tionally, a clipping detector 42 is provided, which is opera-<br>
tive to examine the original left and right channels or the<br>
calculated up-mixer parameters to find out, whether clipping<br>
will occur or not after a straight forward up-mix process.<br>
When the clipping detector 42 detects a clipping danger, it<br>
controls a parameter change 41 via a control line 44 to pro-<br>
vide changed up-mix parameters, which are then provided to a<br>
straight-forward up-mixer 16a, which then generates the<br>
first, second, and third output channels so that no clipping<br>
occurs in the second channel and, for a time frame, in which<br>
the clipping detector 42 has originally detected a clipping<br>
problem, the left and right channels 12c, 12a, have a phantom<br>
center contribution.<br><br><br>
In contrast to the Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 embodiments, the inven-<br>
tive process is carried out based on processing parameters<br>
that are used for deriving the output signals 20a, 20b, 20c,<br>
or 12a, 12b, 12c from the input stereo signals. Thus, in or-<br>
der to provide implementations with still lower computational<br>
complexity, also the clipping detection and the manipulation<br>
of signal levels or part of it are based on the processing<br>
parameters. This is in contrast to the Fig. 2 and 3 embodi-<br>
ments, in which the inventive process is carried out on ac-<br>
tual audio channel signals that were already created for the<br>
center channel after a possible clipping could be detected.<br>
The inventive clipping detection/control can be performed by<br>
a post-processing. Thus, the intended conversion parameters<br>
are analyzed and modified according to the inventive concept<br>
to provide clipping after the synthesis of the actual output<br>
audio signals. An alternative way to control the parameter<br>
change 41 is via an iterative way. Intended conversion pa-<br>
rameters are analyzed. When, after the synthesis of the real<br>
audio signal, clipping may occur, the conversion parameters<br>
are modified. Then, the process is again started and finally,<br>
the output channel signals are synthesized without any clip-<br>
ping and with real center and phantom center contributions in<br>
the corresponding channels.<br>
Subsequently, a preferred implementation of the input chan-<br>
nels analyzer will be discussed. To this end, reference is<br>
made to Fig. 8, which illustrates such a preferred input<br>
channels analyzer 15. First of all, subsequent or overlapping<br>
frames following each other are generated using a windowing<br>
block 80 so that, at the output of block 80, there is, on<br>
line 81a, a block of values of the left channel and, on<br>
line 81b, a block of values of the right channel. Then, a<br>
frequency analysis is performed for each block individually.<br>
To this end, a frequency analyzer 82 is provided for each<br>
channel.<br><br>
The frequency analyzer can be any device for generating a<br>
frequency domain representation of a time domain signal. Such<br>
a frequency analyzer can include a short-time Fourier trans-<br>
form, an FFT algorithm, or an MDCT transform or any other<br>
transform device. Alternatively, the frequency analyzer<br>
block 82 may also include a subband filter bank for generat-<br>
ing for example 32 subband channels or a higher or lower num-<br>
ber of subband channels from a block of input signal values.<br>
Depending on the implementation of the subband filter bank,<br>
the functionality of the framing device 80 and the frequency<br>
analysis block 82 can be implemented in a single digitally<br>
implemented subband filter bank.<br>
Then, a band-wise cross correlation is performed as indicated<br>
by device 84. Thus, the cross-correlator determines a cross<br>
correlation measure between corresponding bands, i.e., bands<br>
having the same frequency index. The cross correlation meas-<br>
ure determined by block 84 can have a value between 0 and 1,<br>
wherein 0 indicates no correlation, and wherein 1 indicates<br>
full correlation. When the device 84 outputs a low cross cor-<br>
relation measure, this means that the left and right signal<br>
components in the respective band are different from each<br>
other so that this band does not include signal components<br>
occurring in both bands, which should be inserted into a cen-<br>
ter channel. When, however, the cross correlation measure is<br>
high, indicating that the signals in both bands are very<br>
similar to each other, then this band has a signal component<br>
occurring in the left and right channels so that this band<br>
should be inserted into the center channel.<br>
A further criterion for deciding whether signals in bands are<br>
similar to each other is the signal energy. Therefore, the<br>
preferred embodiment of the inventive input channels analyzer<br>
includes a band-wise energy calculator 85, which calculates<br>
the energy in each band and which outputs an energy similar-<br>
ity measure indicating, whether the energies in the corre-<br><br>
sponding bands are similar to each other or different from<br>
each other.<br>
The energy similarity measure output by device 85 and the<br>
cross correlation measure output by device 84 are both input<br>
into a final decision stage 86, which comes to a conclusion<br>
that, in a certain frame, a certain band i occurs in both<br>
channels or not. When the decision stage 86 determines that<br>
the signal occurs in both channels, then this signal portion<br>
is fed into the center channel to generate a "real center".<br>
Fig. 8 shows an embodiment for implementing the input chan-<br>
nels analyzer. Additional embodiments are known in the art<br>
and, for example, illustrated in "Spatial enhancement of au-<br>
dio recordings", Jot and Avendano, 23rd International AES<br>
Conference, Copenhagen, Denmark, May 23-25, 2003. Particu-<br>
larly, other methods of analyzing two channels to find signal<br>
components in these channels include statistical or analyti-<br>
cal analyzing methods such as the principle component analy-<br>
sis or the independent subspace analysis or other methods<br>
known in the art of audio analysis. All these methods have in<br>
common that they detect signal components occurring in both<br>
channels, which should be fed into a center channel to gener-<br>
ate a real center.<br>
Subsequently, reference is made to Fig. 7 to illustrate an<br>
energy situation before and after a two-three upmix process<br>
has been implemented by the two-three upmixer 16a in the Fig-<br>
ures. A left input channel L illustrated at 70 in Fig. 7 has<br>
a certain energy. In this example, the right input channel of<br>
the two stereo input channels has a different (lower) energy<br>
as illustrated at 71. It is assumed that the channel analyzer<br>
has found out that there are signal components occurring in<br>
both channels. These signal components occurring in both<br>
channels have an energy as illustrated at 72 in Fig. 7. When<br>
the whole energy 72 would be fed into the center channel as<br>
shown at 73, the energy of the center channel would be above<br><br>
an energy limit, wherein the energy limit at least roughly<br>
illustrates that the signal having such a high energy has am-<br>
plitude values above the amplitude maximum threshold. There-<br>
fore, only a portion of the energy 72 is input into the real<br>
center, while the exceeding portion is equally (re-) distrib-<br>
uted to the synthesized left and right channels L' and R' as<br>
illustrated by arrows 76.<br>
In this context, it is to be noted that there are different<br>
ways of redistributing energy from the center channel back to<br>
the left and right channels or for introducing a correct<br>
amount of energy from an original left channel and an origi-<br>
nal right channel into the center channel. One could, for ex-<br>
ample, scale down all detected signal components by a certain<br>
downscaling factor and introduce the downscaled signal into<br>
the center channel. This would have equal consequences for<br>
the signal components in each band, when a frequency-<br>
selective analysis was applied. Alternatively, one could also<br>
perform a band-wise energy control. This means that when<br>
there have been detected e.g. 10 bands having detected signal<br>
components, one could introduce only 5 bands into the center<br>
channel and leave the remaining 5 bands in the left and right<br>
channels in order to reduce the energy in the center channel.<br>
Depending on certain implementation requirements of the in-<br>
ventive methods, the inventive method can be implemented in<br>
hardware or in software. The implementation can be performed<br>
using a digital storage medium, in particular a disk or a CD<br>
having electronically readable control signals stored<br>
thereon, which can cooperate with a programmable computer<br>
system such that the inventive method is performed. Gener-<br>
ally, the present invention is, therefore, a computer program<br>
product with a program code stored on a machine-readable car-<br>
rier, the program code being configured for performing the<br>
inventive method, when the computer program product runs on a<br>
computer. In other words, the invention is also a computer<br><br><br>
program having a program code for performing the inventive<br>
method, when the computer program runs on a computer.<br><br>
