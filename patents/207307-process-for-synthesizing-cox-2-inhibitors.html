TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROCESS FOR SYNTHESIZING COX-2 INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for synthesizing certain COX-2 inhibiting compounds.  Additionally certain intermediate compounds are included.<br>
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme that is implicated in pain, inflammation, hormone-induced uterine contrations and certain types of cancer growth.  Until recently, only one form of cyclooxygenase had been characterized, this corresponding to cyclooxygenase-1 or the constitutive enzyme, as originally identified in bovine seminal vesicles.  Recently the gene for a second inducible form of cyclooxygenase (cyclooxygenase-2) has been cloned, sequenced and characterized from chicken, murine and human sources.   This enzyme is distinct from the cyclooxygenase-1.  COX-2, is rapidly and readily inducible by a number of agents including mitogens, endotoxin, hormones, cytokines and growth factors.  While the constitutive enzyme, cyclooxygenase-1, is responsible, in large part, for endogenous basal release of prostaglandins and hence is important in their physiological functions such as the maintenance of gastrointestinal integrity and renal blood flow, the inducible form, cyclooxygenase-2, is mainly responsible for the pathological effects of prostaglandins where rapid induction of the enzyme would occur in response to such agents as inflammatory agents, hormones, growth factors, and cytokines.   Thus, a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 will reduce fever, inhibit the inflammatory process, counteract hormone-induced uterine contractions and have potential anti-cancer effects, along with a diminished ability to induce some of the mechanism-based side effects.<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide a synthesis scheme for COX-2 inhibiting compounds which utilizes reduced temperatures in the synthesis.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to utilize a synthetic route that provides high yields.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a synthesis scheme that utilizes a minimum of process steps.<br>
These and other objects will be apparent to those of ordinary skill from the teachings contained herein.<br>

For purposes of this specification, the reactions, unless<br>
otherwise specified, are generally carried out in a solvent such as<br>
benzene, chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, toluene and xylene; etheral<br>
solvents such as diethyl ether, di-n-butyl and diisopentyl ethers, anisole,<br>

The reaction can surprisingly be conducted at substantially room temperatures.<br>
The compounds of formula I are useful for the relief of pain, fever and inflammation of a variety of conditions including rheumatic fever, symptoms associated with influenza or other viral infections, common cold, low back and neck pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, toothache, sprains and strains, myositis, neuralgia, synovitis, arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis degenerative joint diseases (osteoarthritis), gout and ankylosing spondylitis, bursitis, burns, injuries, following surgical and dental procedures.   In addition, such a compound may inhibit cellular neoplastic transformations and metastic<br><br>
tumor growth and hence can be used in the treatment of cancer. Compounds of formula I may also be useful for the treatment of dementia including pre-senile and senile dementia, and in particular, dementia associated with Alzheimer Disease (ie Alzheimer's dementia).<br>
By virtue of its high cyclooxygenase-2 (COX'2) activity and/or its selectivity for cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1), compounds of formula I are useful as an alternative to other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID'S) particularly where such non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be contraindicated such as in patients with peptic ulcers, gastritis, regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis or with a recurrent history of gastrointestinal lesions; GI bleeding, coagulation disorders including anemia such as hypoprothrombinemia, haemophilia or other bleeding problems (including those relating to reduced or impaired platelet function); kidney disease (eg impaired renal function); those prior to surgery or taking anticoagulants; and those susceptable to NSAID induced asthma.<br>
The compounds are inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2 and are thereby useful in the treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated diseases as enumerated above. This activity is illustrated by their ability to selectively inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 over cyclooxygenase-1.  Accordingly, in one assay, the ability of the compounds of this invention to treat cyclooxygenase mediated diseases can be demonstrated by measuring the amount of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesized in the presence of<br>
arachidonic acid, cyclooxygenase-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 and a compound<br>
of formula I.  The IC50 values represent the concentration of inhibitor required to return PGE2 synthesis to 50 % of that obtained as compared<br>
to the uninhibited control.<br>
For the treatment of any of these cyclooxygenase mediated diseases, compounds of formula I may be administered orally, topically, parenterally, by inhalation spray or rectally in dosage unit formulations containing conventional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, adjuvants and vehicles.   The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous, intramuscular, intrasternal injection or infusion techniques.  In addition to the treatment of warm-<br><br>
blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle sheep, dogs, cats, etc., the compound of the invention is effective in the treatment of humans.<br>
The process is further described in connection with the following scheme.<br><br>
The process described herein can be described in connection with the generic description above. Grignard reagent a (0.1 - 3 M, 0.8 - 2 equivalents) is prepared from the corresponding halide, e.g., Z equals chloride, and magnesium  in a suitable solvent, such as THF, ether, toluene or mixtures thereof. The Grignard reagent is added to a cold solution (0 to -78 °C, preferrably - 10 to - 30 °C) of amide b in a suitable solvent, leading to the formation of ketone III.  The ketone III is isolated after aquous workup by extraction and crystallization.<br>
Treatment of ketone III (0.05 - 2 M) with a suitable base, e.g., a metal alkoxide, in a suitable solvent at about - 78 °C to about 50 °C, typically less than about 20°C, results in the formation of an enolate<br><br>
intermediate (not shown).  The enolate is reacted with the trimethinium salt to form an intermediate (not shown) which is quenched into a suitable acid (0.05 - 10 M). An example is acetic acid.<br>
Ammonia is added to the mixture  (typically as an aqueous solution) and the mixture is aged at ambient to reflux temperature) for several hours.  The product is isolated by extraction using, e.g., ether, ethyl acetate or methylene chloride and crystallization to form a compound of formula I.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-<br>
limiting examples in which, unless stated otherwise:<br>
(i)	all operations were carried out at room or ambient<br>
