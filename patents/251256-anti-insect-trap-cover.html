v	The Specialty Feature of this Anti-Insect Trap Cover is that it can be applied to<br>
Nahni-Traps and Gully Traps with some dimensional Modifications and Shape<br>
Modification applying the basic Design of the Anti-Insect Trap Cover.<br>
v	The Anti-Insect Trap Cover is well designed to cater the drainage needs and to protect<br>
bath rooms and kitchens with the help of an In-Built Water Seal which seals the<br>
Nahni or Gully Trap totally with the help of the drain water which passes through the<br>
Anti-Insect Trap Cover.<br>
The present Invention of "Anti-Insect Trap Cover" is an improved Product over the present practice, in use or being followed relating to Nahni Or Gully Traps in Drainage and Sewerage Systems, etc..<br>
(i) This Invention caters the present day needs of Society in a better manner over the present day practice relating to Nahni-Traps &amp; Gully Traps. Firstly, the present day professionals in this line, did not properly attend the Area of Making Nahni Or Gully Trap Covers with proper design Standards to cater to the Public,. The present Invention takes care of the actual Consumer to fully cater to his total requirements. The Consumer of the Conventional Nahni Or Gully Trap Cover is highly unhappy and feels unhygienic Conditions both in the Kitchens and Toilets with the Spread of Insects which forces the Consumer to use Insect Killer Sprays which is Poisonous to the micro-environmental conditions of his dwelling or Office. And another implication is that the Insects that comes from the drainage pipes through the Conventional Covers of the Nahni Or Gully Traps enters the other living and bedrooms and spreads into the ward robes and it is very difficult to hunt them with the help of poisonous Sprays which is hazardous to human health. Hence, it is a situation to pay a in-depth Thought to actually solve the issue of entry of Insects into the living environment. The Present Invention of Anti-Insect Trap Cover to Nahni or Gully Traps is well designed with a water seal all around the cover allowing water all around through the perforations of the Anti-Insect Trap Cover to pass through the Nahni Or Gully Trap thereby allowing the drain water to drain out through the drain Pipes of the Drainage System. The Design of the Anti-Insect Trap Cover does not allow any insects like Cockroaches or Other like insects into the Living Spaces of the Dwelling Or Office Spaces. Hence, the actual Problem of insects is solved totally, making human life happy.<br>
(ii) Hence, we require a highly efficient Product, which can overcome these constraints and shall also be cost-effective when compared with traditional or conventional type Covers for use in Nahni or Gully Traps. The Present Invention is made Possible by using high-technical Skills in designing the final New Product.<br>
(iii) As the Anti-Insect Trap Cover is called by itself is self explanatory by giving an Idea of a Modern Product which does not allow any Insects into the living environment. This is achieved through designing the perforations, which passes water into the drain-pipes, are kept within the water seal of the Product. Here, the water pressure from the flooring is increased with the coming up water which tries to pass through the Anti-Insect Trap Cover of the Nahni or Gully Trap, increases Pressure in the Water Seal of the Anti-Insect Trap Cover and thereby allowing water to Overflow through the Water Seal thereby allowing the drain water to pass through the Nahni Or Gully Trap.<br><br>
