The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
4. Description<br>
The present invention provides a single oral dose pharmaceutical composition comprising, triple combination of entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa, or salts thereof along with one or more sugar alcohols wherein entacapone is co-micronized with sugar alcohol, characterized in that one or both of the rate and the extent of absorption of the said composition is equal to or greater than that obtained by entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa formulation marketed under the trade name Stalevo200®.<br>
Entacapone, an inhibitor of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), is a nitro-catechol-structured compound with a molecular weight of 305.3 used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa therapy. The chemical name of entacapone is (E)-2-cyano-3-(3,4-dihydroxy-5-nitrophenyl)-N,N-diethyl-2-propenamide. Its empirical formula is C14H15N3O5, and its structural formula is:<br><br>
Carbidopa, an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid decarboxylation, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 244.3. It is designated chemically as (-)-L-(a-hydrazino-(a-methyl-|3-(3,4-dihydroxybenzene) propanoic acid monohydrate. Its empirical formula is C10H14N2O4H2O, and its structural formula is:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Levodopa, an aromatic amino acid, is a white, crystalline compound, slightly soluble in water, with a molecular weight of 197.2. It is designated chemically as (-)-L-a-amino-b-(3,4-dihydroxybenzene) propanoic acid. Its empirical formula is C9H11NO4, and its structural formula is:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Entacapone being a BCS (Biopharmaceutics Classification system) class IV drug, it poses problems of low solubility, low dissolution rate and hence low bioavailability.<br>
U.S. Patent No 4,963,590 provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising entacapone and pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 6,500,867 and 6,797,732 disclose oral solid tablet compositions comprising entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa, or pharmaceutically acceptable salts or hydrates thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient. Both these patents disclose that when carbidopa, levodopa and entacapone are mixed together, it results in stability problems and desired therapeutic effect is not achieved. On the other hand, when a substantial portion of carbidopa is separated from levodopa and entacapone, the formulation exhibits better stability and desired therapeutic effect is also achieved.<br><br><br>
U.S. Patent No 6,599,530 provides an oral compacted composition in the form of a tablet, which comprises entacapone, nitecapone, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt of entacapone or nitecapone, and croscarmellose sodium in an amount of at least 6% by weight of the composition.<br>
U.S. Application No. 20060222703 describes oral pharmaceutical compositions of entacapone, carbidopa and levodopa with microcrystalline cellulose and starch by simultaneous mixing of all the three actives. The composition is prepared by compaction granulation. The application describes the disadvantages associated with wet granulation technique which includes destabilization of composition and decreased dissolution of levodopa, carbidopa and entacapone due to use of water in wet granulation method.<br>
It is known that even if the micronization or the grinding of a substance in the presence of a surfactant or of a sugar can increase its solubility, these parameters are not always adequate. For example, the bioavailability of micronized progesterone is not adequate and should be improved, for example by dispersion in camauba wax. Such a technique is described in application WO-89,02742. Thus, it appears that the properties of a substance treated by micronization or grinding, in particular its solubility and its bioavailability, are not predictable, it being possible to obtain contradictory results.<br>
There are numerous prior art references, which quote use of sugar alcohols like mannitol, sorbitol etc as fillers in formulation or as sensory cue agents i.e which impart feeling of cooling in mouth in case of orally disintegrating tablets (WO2007080601, EP589981B1, EP906089B1, EP1109534B1, US6328994, WO2007001086, US20070196494, US20060240101, WO2006057912, US20060057199,). Sugar alcohols like mannitol are employed in most orally disintegrating formulations and not in conventional immediate release formulations as sensory cue agents because orally disintegrating tablets disintegrate in mouth instead of disintegrating in gastrointestinal tract as in case of conventional immediate release tablets.<br><br><br>
The present inventors have noticed that sugar alcohols like mannitol or sorbitol when used along with other known water insoluble drugs like fenofibrate, irbesartan, aripiprazole, either as physical mixture or in the form of complex, does not result in any significant increase in solubility of above mentioned poorly soluble drugs. It was observed that it does not make any significant difference either in solubility or percent release of these poorly soluble drugs, whether these drugs are present alone in formulation or along with sugar alcohols.<br>
The present inventors while working on the entacapone, levodopa, carbidopa triple combination formulation have surprisingly found when entacapone is co-micronized with sugar alcohols, it results in significant increase in solubility of entacapone and percent drug release of entacapone from triple combination of entacapone, levodopa, carbidopa formulation vis-a-vis the formulation wherein entacapone is not co-micronized with sugar alcohol.<br>
Stalevo 200® releases about 70% of entacapone in 30 minutes, whereas pharmaceutical composition of the present invention releases about 85% of entacapone in 30 minutes. This significant increase in percent release of entacapone leads to improved wettability, solubility, and hence increased percent release. This further leads to improved bioavailability.<br>
The inventors have further noticed that pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is further bioequivalent to commercially available triple combination of entacapone, carbidopa, levodopa (Stalevo 200®).<br>
"Bioequivalency" is established by a 90% Confidence Interval (CI) of between 0.80 and 1.25 for both Cmax and AUC under USFDA regulatory guidelines, or a 90% CI for AUC of between 0.80 to 1.25 and a 90% CI for Cmax of between 0.70 to 1.43 under the European EMEA regulatory guidelines.<br>
Bioequivalence studies were carried out between Stalevo 200® and composition of the present invention. The study was monitored in terms of Cmax, AUC, Tmax achieved with the test product (composition of the present invention) and<br><br><br>
reference product (Stalevo 200 ). Table 1 gives bioequivalence data of composition of the present invention and Stalevo 200. Table 2 provides bioequivalence data with respect to Test to reference Ratios (T/R ratios) at 90% Confidence Interval.<br>
One of the aspects of present invention provides a single oral dose pharmaceutical composition comprising, triple combination of entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa, or salts thereof along with one or more sugar alcohols wherein entacapone is co-micronized with sugar alcohol, characterized in that one or both of the rate and the extent of absorption of the said composition is equal to or greater than that obtained by entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa formulation marketed under the trade name Stalevo200®.<br>
In the single oral dose pharmaceutical composition of the invention a substantial portion of entacapone or a salt thereof may be separated from a mixture of levodopa and carbidopa or salts thereof; or a substantial portion of carbidopa or a salt thereof may be separated from a mixture of levodopa and entacapone or salts thereof; or the carbidopa, entacapone or levodopa may be present simultaneously in a mixture.<br>
The term "substantial portion" of entacapone or salts thereof herein refers to the amount of entacapone or salts thereof that do not interfere with stability and or dissolution and therapeutic effect or bioavailability thereof in a single oral dose triple combination of entacapone, levodopa and carbidopa.<br>
