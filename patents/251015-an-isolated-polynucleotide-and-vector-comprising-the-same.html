				<td>Vectors comprising novel regulatory elements<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The invention relates to the field of recombinant DNA technology and, in particular, the development of vectors for the expression of recombinant proteins. Expression of heterologous genes in eukaryotic cells is a fundamental aspect of biotechnology with many academic and commercial applications. Expression of such genes requires transcription by RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which is driven by c/s-acting genetic elements known as promoters and enhancers.<br>
In simple terms, promoters are directional elements that act to initiate transcription of sequences situated less than 100 (and usually less than 50) nucleotide base pairs (bp) downstream. They contain a number of short consensus nucleotide sequences that act as binding sites for various proteins that participate in the initiation of transcription and the assembly of a multi-subunit complex known as the pre-initiation complex (McKnight and Tjian, 1987, Cell 46: 795-805). In most genes,  this  occurs at a very widely conserved sequence known as the TATA box (TATAAA) to which the TATA box-binding protein (TBP, a subunit of the general transcription factor TFIID) binds. There follows an ordered assembly of more than ten further transcription factors to finally form the Pol II holoenzyme complex. RNA transcription actually starts at an initiator site about 25-30 bases downstream (Breathnach and Chambon, 1981, Annu Rev Biochem 50: 349-393) to which TBP also binds.<br>
Most functional promoters contain further upstream promoter elements (UPEs), of which the most highly conserved are the CAAT box (CCAAT, the binding site for the transcription factors CBF, C/EBP and NF-1), about 70-200bp upstream, and the GC box (GGGCGG, binding site for the general transcription factor Sp-1) a similar distance upstream. Although basal levels of transcription occur from the TATA box alone, for most promoters at least the CAAT and GC boxes are required for optimal levels of transcription.<br>
Enhancers are sequences that act non-lirectionally to increase transcription from promoters situated locally but not necessarily immediately adjacent (up to several kilobases away (Kadonaga (2004) Cell 116: 247-257). Enhancers contain short (8-<br>
12bp) consensus sequences representing the binding sites for a wide range oftranscriptional activator proteins (Ondek et al, 1988, Science 236:1237-1244) including<br>
some, such as NF-1 and SP-1 that are also associated with promoter elements. These sequences are often duplicated in tandem or inverted repeats.<br>
In some natural transcription units; including the very active immediate/early gene transcription units of many DNA viruses such as cytomegalovirus, enhancer and promoter elements may be functionally combined into what is effectively one extended upstream element.<br>
Promoters may be regulated, being responsive to cell type, temperature, metal ions or other factors; or constitutive, giving transcription that is unresponsive to such factors.<br><br>
For many purposes a strong, constitutive promoter giving consistent, high, levels of<br>
transcription in many, if not all, cell types is highly advantageous. For many years the enhancer/promoter element driving immediate/early gene expression in human cytomegalovirus has been very widely used for driving such expression of heterologous genes in eukaryotic expression vectors (Foecking &amp; Hoffstetter, 1986, Gene 45:101-105).<br>
Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a member of the betaherpesvirus family and is<br>
.responsible for gastrointestinal and respiratory infections, hepatitis, and retinltis. As with<br>
other herpesviruses, CMV can persist in latent infections and can be reactivated in immunocompromised individuals. In cell culture, human CMV replicates productively in terminally differentiated cells such as fibroblast, epithelial, and endothelial cells and in monocyte-derived macrophages (Isomura and Stinski, 2003, J Virol 77: 3602-3614 and references therein).<br>
During productive infection, there is an brdered expression of sets of CMV genes, designated immediate-early (IE), early, or late., The human CMV IE genes are thought to play a critical role in the efficiency of replication (reviewed in Castillo and Kowalik, 2002, Gene 290: 19-34).<br>
The region upstream of the human CMV IE promoter is divided into three regions, the modulator, the unique region, and the enhancer. The enhancer is also divided into a<br>
distal and a proximal enhancer. The distal enhancer is necessary for efficient IE gene<br><br>
expression and viral replication at a low MOI. Human CMVs have very strong enhancers<br>
for the expression of IE genes. The human. CMV e'nhancer has four 18-bp repeat elements containing an NF-KB or rel binding site, five 19-bp repeat elements containing<br>
a CREB or ATF binding site, two AP-1 binding sites, and multiple SP-1 sites (Thomsen et al, 1984, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 81: 659-663; Meier and Stinski, 1996, Intervirology 39: 331-342). The murine CMV enhancer contains six NF⁭B or re! binding sites, one CREB or ATF binding site, and at least seven AP-1 binding sites (Dorsch-Hasler et al,<br>
1985, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 82: ,8325-8329). The different c/s-acting elements act individually and synergistically to stabilize the RNA polymerase II transcription initiation complex on the promoter.<br>
A number of cytomegaloviruses predominantly infecting other host species are known, although, in many cases, the exact taxonomy and degree of cross-species relatedness is provisional. Cytomegalovirus-like viruses infecting a number of primate species (including African green monkey, Rhesus monkey and bonobo) and rodents including mouse, rat and guinea pig are recognised. Of these, only the murine and rat promoter-enhancers have been subject to detailed functional analysis. Comparison of these species with human CMV shows that the functions of the IE promoter-enhancers are not directly comparable, probably because of the presence of unrecognised c/s-acting elements contributing to downstream transcription in cells of different species (Isomura and Stinski, 2003, J Virol 77: 3602-3614).<br>
However, both human and murine CMV IE prompter-enhancers produce high levels of constitutive expression of heterologous genes in eukaryotic expression vectors and are widely used in biotechnology. Such use of the human CMV promoter was disclosed in US 5,168, 062 (Stinski / University of Iowa). Use of the promoter, enhancer and functionally complete 5' (upstream) untranslated region including the first intron of the<br>
human cytomegalovirus major immediate-early gene, wherein this is not directly linked to<br>
.its natural DNA coding sequence is claimed by US 5,591,639 (Bebbington /Celltech).<br>
Use of the murine CMV IE enhancer is disclosed by US 4,968,615 (Koszinowski et al)<br>
Guinea pig CMV (GPCMV) produces a disease of guinea pigs with many similarities to the pathology of human CMV infections. Attempts to characterise the genome (Isom et al, 1984, J Virology 49: 4267436; Gao and Isom, 1984, J Virology 52:436-447) suggested that the structural organisation of the genome was unique amongst herpesviruses. Although of a similar size to human and murine CMV, the GPCMV genome was far simpler than that of human CMV and most closely resembled that of murine CMV. However, the GPCMV genome had several unusual features, particularly in the structure of the terminal regions'. Later studies of IE gene expression identified an<br>
IE region by sequence comparison with human CMV (Yin et al, 1990, J Virol 64:1537-1548) and the expression and processing of IE transcripts was analysed.  However, there was no analysis  of the usefulness of the IE promoter-enhancer for the expression of heterologous genes.<br>
The sequence of the 'HRv' (Hind lll-EcoRV) immediate-early upstream fragment of the<br>
GPCMV genome, containing the 5' end of IE1 coding sequence and the upstream promoter/enhancer regions was sequenced (Yin, 1991, Guinea pig cytomegalovirus immediate-early gene expression, PhD thesis, Pennsylvania State University, USA) and shown to contain a region of repetitive sequences, typical of a CMV IE regulatory region. Three short repeats, GP-1, GP-2 and GP-3 were;identified. GP-1 is an 18-bp repeat occurring 9 times (73-100% similarity to a GGCCCGGGACTTTCCA consensus) containing an NF-kB binding site and corresponding to the HCMV 18-bp repeat. GP-2 is a 17-bp repeat occurring 10 times (86-100% similarity to a TGTCCTTTTTGGCAAA consensus) and containing a core sequence similar to the consensus SRE (serum response element). GP-3 is repeated 4 times In the proximal upstream region and contains GTGACTTT, a sequence identified as a binding site for c-jun or GCN4 (Hill et al, 1984, Science 234; 451-457).<br>
Although this work suggested that the GPCMV IE upstream region contained a strong promoter, due to the way the reporter constructs  were made certain artefacts could not<br>
be excluded. Firstly, the HRv fragment also appears to include the first exon and part of<br><br>
the first intron of the IE1 gene. This intron contains three copies of a putative NF-1 binding site, which may have artificially boosted the apparent strength of the promoter. Secondly, the reporter constructs used to test the GPCMV fragments contained an SV40<br>
promoter (itself a strong viral promoter), so that reporter expression resulted from the<br>
effect of a double GPCMV / SV40 promoter. As a result it is not possible to make<br><br>
comparisons of the GPCMV enhancer/promoter alone with other strong promoters<br>
generally, or even with other CMV IE enhancer/promoters.<br>
The applicant's co-pending patent application PCT/GB99/02357 (WO 00/05393),<br>
incorporated by reference herein, describes elements that are responsible, in their natural chromosomal context, for establishing an open chromatin structure across a<br>
locus that consists exclusiveiy'of ubiquitously expressed, housekeeping genes. These elements are not derived from a.Locus Control Region (LCR) and comprise extended<br>
methylation-free CpG islands. The term Ubiquitous Chromatin Opening Element (UCOE) has been used to describe such elements.<br>
In mammalian DNA, the dinucleotide  CpG is recognised by a DNA methyltransferase enzyme that methylates cytosine to, 5-methyicytosine. However, 5-methyicytosine is unstable and is converted to thymine. As a result; CpG dinucleotides occur far less frequently than one would expect by chance. Some sections of genomic DNA nevertheless do have a frequency bf CpG that is closer to that expected, and these sequences are known as "CpG islands". As used herein a "CpG island* Is defined as a sequence of DNA, of at least 200bp, that has a GC content of at least 50% and an observed / expected CpG content ratio of at least 0.6 (i.e. a CpG dinucleotide content of at least 60% of that which would be; expected-by chance) (Gardiner-Green M and Frommer M. J Mol Biol 196, 261-282, (1987); Rice P, Longden I and Bleasby A Trends Genet 16, 276-277 (2000).<br>
Methylation-free CpG islands are well-known in the art (Bird et al (1985) Cell 40: 91-99, Tazi and Bird (1990) Cell 60; 909-920) and may ;be defined as CpG islands where a substantial proportion of the cytosine .residues are not methylated and which usually<br>
extend over the 5' ends of two closely .spaced ,(0.1-3 kb) divergently transcribed genes.<br>
These regions of DNA are reported to remain hypomethylated in all tissues throughout<br>
development (Wise and Pravtcheva (1999) Genpmjcs 60: 258-271). They are often<br>
 associated with the 5 ends of ubiquitously expressed genes, as well as an estimated<br>
40% of genes showing a tissue-restricted expression profile (Antequera, F. &amp; Bird, A. Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. USA 90, 1195-11999 (1993); Cross, S.H. &amp; Bird, A.P. Curr. Opin, Genet. Dev. 5, 309-314 (1995) and are known to be localised regions of active chromatin (Tazi, J. &amp; Bird, A! Cell 60, 909:920 (1990).<br>
An 'extended' methylation-free CpG island is a methylation-free CpG island that extends<br>
across a region encompassing more than one transcriptional start site and/or extends for more than 500bp and preferably more than 500bp. The borders of the extended methylation-free CpG island are functionally defined through the use of PCR over the<br>
region in combination with restriction endonuclease enzymes whose ability to digest (cut) DNA at their recognition sequence is sensitive to the methylation status of any CpG residues that are present. One such enzyme is Hpall, which recognises and digests at the site CCGG, which is commonly found within CpG islands, but only if the central CG residues are not methylated. Therefore, PCR conducted with Hpall-digested DNA and<br>
over a region harbouring Hpall sites, does not give:an amplification product due to Hpall digestion if the DNA is unmethylated. The PCR will only give an amplified product if the DNA is methylated. Therefore, beyond the methylation-free region Hpall will not digest the DNA a PCR amplified product will be observed thereby defining the boundaries of the "extended methylation-free CpG Island".<br>
International application WO 00/05393 demonstrates that regions spanning methylation-free CpG islands encompassing dual, divergently transcribed promoters from the human TATA binding protein (7BP)/proteosome component-B1 (PSMBI) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (hnRNPA2)/heterochromatin protein 1Hsy(HP7 Hsj) gene loci impart enhanced levels of gene expression to operably linked genes. Methylation-free CpG islands associated with actively transcribing promoters possess the ability to remodel chromatin and are thus thought to be a prime determinant in establishing and maintaining an open domain at housekeeping gene loci.<br>
UCOEs confer an increased proportion of productive gene integration events with improvements in the level and stability pf transgene expression. This has important research and biotechnological applications including, the generation of transgenic animals and recombinant protein products  in cultured cells.<br>
WO 00/05393 discloses functional UCOE fragments of approximately 4.0kb, in particular, the '5.5 RNP' fragment defined by nucleotides 4102 to 8286 of Figure 21 (as<br><br>
disclosed on p11, lines 6 and 7). The same application discloses a '1.5kb RNP' fragment (Figs 22 and 29, derivation described on p51, lines 1 to 5). However, this fragment is actually a 2165b,p BamHl-Tth 1 111 fragment of the '5.5 RNP' fragment described above, consisting of nucleotides 4102 to 6267 of Figure 21 of that application.<br>
A further application , WO 02/24930, discloses artificially-constructed UCOEs composed of fragments of naturally-occurring CpG islands.  A third application, WO 04/067701<br>
describes polynucleotides comprising small functional fragments of UCOEs. Such<br>
polynucleotides comprise methylation-free CpG islands of no more than approximately<br>
2kb, or fragments of larger such islands, pf not more than approximately 2kb.<br>
Given the importance of recombinant protein expression in biotechnology, there remains a need for improve'd expression vectors comprising novel promoter / enhancer combinations.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the words "comprise" and "contain" and variations of the Words, for example'"comprising" and "comprises", means "including but not limited to", and is not intended to (and does not) exclude other moieties, additives, components, integers or steps,.<br>
Throughout the description and claims of this specification, the singular encompasses the plural unless the context otherwise requires. In particular, where the indefinite article is used, the specification is to be understood as contemplating plurality as well as singularity, unless the context requires otherwise.<br>
Features, integers, characteristics, compounds, chemical moieties or groups described in conjunction with a particular aspect, embodiment or example of the invention are to be understood to be applicable to any Other aspect, embodiment or example described herein unless incompatible therewith:<br>
As used herein, the term "pperably linked" refers to a relationship of operability between elements in the polynucleotides of the invention. "Operably linked" is a term, well known to those of skill in the art, that describes a functional relationship between c/s-acting DNA sequences. The exact structural relationship may or may not be relevant and differs for different types of elements. For a promoter, It implies an essentially adjacent (usually within less than 100bp) position 5' to the open reading frame that it drives. In the case of extended methylation-free CpG islands, It appears that a regional effect on chromatin structure is responsible for increasing the level and consistency of gene, expression. By way of example, the element comprising an extended methylation-free CpG-island may be positioned 5' of the enhancer / promoter controlling transcription of the expressible gene. However, "operably-linked" embraces the possibility of its being positioned elsewhere, as long as a clear functional effect can be demonstrated.<br>
By 'functional homologue' is meant a polynucleotide sequence capable of hybridising, under stringent conditions, to the disclosed sequence, and which has similar properties of conferring increased expression of operably-linked expressible open reading frames in two or more tissues. Stringent hybridisation/washing conditions are well known in the art. For example, nucleic acid hybrids that are stable after washing in 0.1 xSSC.0.1%<br><br>
SDS at 60°C. It is well known in the art that optimal hybridisation conditions can be calculated if the sequence of the nucleic acidis known.. For example, hybridisation<br>
conditions can be determined by, the. GC content of the nucleic acid subject to hybridisation. See Sambrook et a! (1989), Molecular Cloning; A Laboratory Approach. A common formula for calculating the stringency conditions, required to achieve hybridisation between nucleic acid molecules of a. specified homology is:<br>
Tm = 81.5° C + 16.6 Log [Na4+] + 0.41[% G + C] -0.63 (%formamide)<br>
An object of the invention is to provide novel DNA molecules and vectors containing<br>
transcriptional enhancers providing very high levels of expression of operably-linked expressible nucleic acid sequences in eukaryotic cells. Advantageously the enhancers may be used in combination with their naturally-associated promoters and / or other genetic elements that increase transcription.<br>
The invention relates to the guinea pig cytomegalovirus early-immediate promoter I<br>
enhancer and its use in expression vectors, particularly for obtaining high levels of<br><br>
expression of recombinant proteins. The invention provides eukaryotic expression<br>
  vectors that are capable of providing increased levels of expression in many cell types<br>
over that obtainable from human or murine CMV IE enhancer /promoter elements<br>
.<br>
The guinea pig cytomegalovirus early-immediate upstream regulatory region consists of the approximately 1500bp upstream of the IE1 gene and more especially the sequence disclosed by Figure 1 and SEQ ID NO:1. It comprises both promoter and enhancer elements. By 'promoter1 is meant at least the transcriptional start site, TATA box and CAAT box, being a fragment comprising nucleotides 779 to 880 of Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO: 1) or a functional homologue thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides an isolated polynucleotide comprising at least 100,<br>
 ,preferably 200, and more preferably at least 500, 'contiguous polynucleotides of the<br>
guinea pig CMV immediate/early regulatory region-as depicted in Figure 1 and SEQ ID<br><br>
 : NO:1 and an expressible polyhucleotide sequence, transcription of said  xpressible<br>
polynucleotide sequence being driver by a promoer situated between enhancer and gene or other expressible sequence, which may be the endogenous guinea pig CMV immediate/early promoter or some other, heterologous, promoter not naturally associated with the enhancer. The expressible polynucleotide sequence is not a guinea<br><br>
pig CMV immediate /early gene and is not naturally operably linked with the promoter. It will be understood, by one of skill in the art, that in the case of a circular isolated polynucleotide (as in a plasmid vector) by 'between' is meant upstream of the directly operably linked expressible polynucleotide sequence (5' with respect to the sense strand), and downstream (3'1) of the operably linked enhancer. It is understood that such an isolated polynucleotide may comprise other promoters, not associated with expression of the inserted expressible sequence of interest (such as those required for expression of selectable markers qr those associated with other elements).<br>
Hence the isolated polynucleotide comprises	.<br>
a)	an element comprising at least 200, and preferably at least 500, contiguous<br>
nucleotidesof SEQID N0:1 and,<br>
b)	an element comprising an expressible polynucleotide sequence;<br>
characterised in that said isolated polynucleotide 'comprises, in a 5' to 3' direction with<br>
respect to the sense strand of the expressible polynucleotide sequence, an enhancer, a<br>
single promoter, and said expressible polynucleotide sequence, and wherein said<br>
enhancer is operably linked to said promoter, which is directly operably linked to said<br><br>
expressible polynucleotide sequence and wherein said promoter is not naturally operably<br>
linked to said expressible polynucleotide sequence..<br>
Preferably the isolated polynucleotide contains a 5' fragment of the immediate/early<br>
regulatory region comprising nucleptides 50 to 550 or, alternatively, a 3' fragment<br>
comprising nucleotides 275 to 775. Such fragments contain functional enhancer<br><br>
fragments, without the endogenous prdmoter.<br>
In one embodiment, therefore, the isolated polynucleotide of the invention comprises at<br>
least the promoter from the immediate/early regulatory region of guinea pig CMV directly operably linked to an expressible nucleic acid sequence to which it is not naturally<br>
operably linked, said promoter preferably comprising nucleotides 779 to 880 of SEQ ID NO: 1. By 'directly operably linked' is meant that transcription of the gene or other expressible nucleic acid is driven directly from the promoter.<br>
Preferably, said isolated polynucleotide further comprises the enhancer from the major immediate/early regulatory region of guinea pig CMV, more preferably comprising nucleotides 1 to 887 of SEQ ID NO:1<br>
In one preferred embodiment, said isolated polynucieotide further comprises an extended, methylation-free CpG island operably linked to said expressible nucleic acid sequence. More preferably, said extended, methylation-free CpG island comprises one or more further promoters, particularly dual or bi-directional promoters that transcribe divergently. Hence the invention provides an isolated polynucieotide comprising at least 200 contiguous nucleotldes of Figure .1 (SEQ ID NO:1), operably linked to an expressible polynucieotide sequence, and further comprising an extended, methylation-free CpG island operably linked to said expressible polynucieotide sequence. Such an extended,<br>
methylation-free CpG island may  conveniently situated adjacent to, and upstream of, the enhancer sequence. Preferably such an isolated polynucieotide comprises at least 500 contiguous polynucleotides of Figure 1 (SEQ ID NO:1), more preferably a 5' fragment of the immediate/early regulatory region comprising nucleotides 50 to 550 or, alternatively, a 3' fragment combrising nucleotides 275 to 775. Most more preferably it comprises nucleotides 1 to 887 of SEQ ID Np:1<br>
In one embodiment, said extended, methylation-free CpG island comprises a 44kb DNA<br>
 fragment spanning the human TATA binding protein gene and 12kb each of the 5' and 3"<br>
flanking sequence, or functional fragment thereof. Preferably, the functional fragment comprises a 25kb DNA fragment spanning the human TATA binding protein gene with<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Example 1<br>
Generation of stably transfected CHO-K1 cells using vectors containing either the<br>
hCMVpromoter or the gpCMVpromoter.<br>
The plasmids constructs were'generated as follows. The ampicillin resistance gene was isolated from pBluescript® (Stratagene) by.PCR Incorporating Nrul sites within each end of the primer (S'-TGTCGCGAGTCTGACAGTTACCAAT GCTTAATC 3' (SEQ ID NO:5),<br><br>
5'- CATCGCGAGCACTTTTCGGGGAAATGTGTGCGC-31 (SEQ ID NO:6). The PCR product was inserted into the Pvull'slte of pMaell(Nucleic Acids Research 2001 29:E26) to generate pCA1. The following oligonucleotides<br>
1.	5'-TCGAAGTTTAAACATTTAAATCTAGMGCTTAT-3' (SEQ ID NO:7)<br>
2.	5'-CCGGTATCGATAAGCTTCTAGATTTAAATGTTTAAACT-3 (SEQ ID NO:8)<br>
3.	5'-CGATACCGGTGGCGCGCCAATTGTTAATTAAGATCTGG-3' (SEQ ID NO:9)<br>
4.	5'-CCCATTGGGCCAGATCTTAATTAACAATTGGCGCGCCA-3' (SEQ ID NO:10)<br>
5.	5'-CCCAATGGGCCGTACGAATTCCTTAGGCTCGAG-3' (SEQIDNO:11)<br>
6.	5'-GGCCCTCGAGCCTAAGAATTCGTACGG-3 (SEQIDNO:12)<br>
were annealed (1 with 2; 3 with 4; 5 with 6; and then the three dimers were annealed together) and used to replace the multicloning site of pCA1 between the Xhol and Notl sites destroying these sites during the construction. This generated pCAIMCS. The gel site was deleted from the PGK promoter/within pPGK-Puro-bgh pA by Agel restriction<br>
digestion followed by blunting wi.th T4 DNA polymerise and re-ligation. The PGK-<br>
Puromycin pA cassette was removed from this vector as an EcoRI-Xhol fragment and<br>
ligated into pCAIMCS that had similarly been digested with EcoRI and Xho\. This vector<br>
was designated pCIA-Puro (CET 1000). the bghpA in pCIA-Puro was then replaced with the HSV TkpA. The HSV-Tk polyA was removed from pEGFP-N1 as a BstBI-Eco109l<br>
fragment, blunted with T4 DNA pplymerase, and ligated into pCIA-Puro that had been digested with Sacl and blunted with T4. DNA pplymerase. This vector was designated GET 1005.<br>
To construct pCET1 005 1 .5kb-GPCMV-EGFP, the 1 .5kb hnRNP UCOE fragment was<br>
excised from pCET20 (described, previously) using BsmBI, blunt-ended using T4 polymerase and then cloned into the blunted Xhol site of pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Palo<br>
Alto, CA, USA) generating pEGFP-NI 1 .5kb-EGFP. The 2.4kb "hnRNP-EGFP" cassette<br>
was then excised from this plasmid using Nhe\ (blunt-ended)/Notl/ and subcloned into the<br>
backbone of pCET1005-EGFP that had been digested, with Swal/Notl to give pCET1005<br>
1 .5kb-EGFP. The GPCMV promoter was then excised from pPCRScript GPCMV (synthesized by Geneart, Regensburg, Germany) with Nhel and EcoRI, blunt-ended and subcloned into the blunted BamHI of this plasmid to yield pCET1005 1 .5kb-GPCMV-EGFP. Excising the 1.5kb hnRNP UCOE using Pmel/Sacl, blunt-ending and religating<br><br>
the backbone generated the plasmid pCET1 005 GPCMV-EGFP.<br>
To construct pCET1015 8kb-GPCMV-EGFP; the 5.3kb Sacl (blunt)/Pacl fragment of pCET1005 1.5kb-GPCMV-EGFP was subcloned into the scl (blunt)/Pacl-digested backbone of pCET1015. The plasmld pCET1005 1.5kb-HCMV-EGFP was constructed by subcloning the blunted 1.5kb hnRNP BsmBI fragment from pCET20 into the blunted C/al site of pCET1005-EGFP.<br>
CHO-K1 cells were maintained in F12MAM} nutrient mixture (Gibco, UK) supplemented with 10% Foetal Calf Serum (Invitrogen UK) and' 5 U/mi Penicillin and Streptomycin mix<br>
(Sigma, UK). For stable transfection of CHO-K1, plasmids were linearised with Pert, extracted in phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol and chloroform, precipitated in ethanol and resuspended at a concentration of 0.25µg/µl in sterile water. In a sterile electroporation cuvette, equivalent molar quantities of linearised plasmids were diluted to 25µl in sterile water (1.39µg pCET1005-EGFP, 1.78µg pCET1005 1.5kb-HCMV-EGFP, 1.45//g pCET1005 GPCMV-EGFP or 1.85µg pCET1005 1.5kb-GPCMV-EGFP) and mixed with 5x106 CHO-K1 cells in 250µl growth medium. After incubation on ice for 15 minutes, the cells were electroporated at 250V/975µ/F (BioRad Gene Pulser II™) and incubated at room temperature for a further 10 minutes. Cells were then transferred into 10ml of growth media, harvested by centrifugation and transferred into a 225cm2 tissue culture flask in a total of 50ml of growth medium. Cells were incubated for 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator before addition of Puromycin (Sigma, UK) to a concentration of 12.5µg/ml. Cells were cultured for 8 days (replacing selective media after 4 days) before the stable traosfectants were harvested, subcultured in 6-well tissue culture dishes (maintaining selection) and analysed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting using the FL1 channel to view EGFP. Figure 2 clearly shows that the two gpCMV containing constructs pCET1005-GPCMV-EGFP (Figure 3) and pCET1005-<br>
1.5kb-GPCMV-EGFP (Figure 5) generate pools which express the transgene to a higher level than the corresponding constructs which use the hCMV promoter, pCET1005-EGFP and pCET1005-1.5kb-HCMV -EGFP respectively.<br>
Example 2<br>
HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Sigma, UK) supplemented with 10%'Foetal Calf Serum and 5 U/ml Penicillin and Streptomycin mix. For stable transfection, HEK293 cells were seeded Into 6-well dishes at a density of 1x10B cells/well and cultured for 24 hours at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Cells were then transfected with 4jt/g of the indicated plasmid (pCET1005-EGFP or pCET1005-gpCMV-EGFP)(linearised with Pc/1) using 10µl Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, UK).<br><br>
The DNA and Lipofectamine 2000 were diluted separately in 250//I OptiMEM I (Gibco, UK) and, after incubation at room temperature for 5 minutes, mixed together and incubated for a further 20 minutes. Growth media on the cells was replaced with 1ml of OptiMEM I supplemented with 15% FCS and the DNA/Lipofectamine 2000 mixture was then added. Cells were incubated at 37°C In a 5% CO2 incubator for 5 hours before 3.5ml of OptiMEM I supplemented with 10% FCS was added. Cells were then incubated at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator for 24 hours before being harvested and transferred to a 225cm2 tissue culture flask in a' total of 50ml of DMEM growth medium, supplemented with 0.5µg/ml Puromycin. Cells were grown 'for approximately 14 days (replacing the selective media every 3-4 days) before the stable transfectants were harvested by centrifugation, subcultured in 6-well tissue culture dishes (maintaining selection) and analysed by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting using the FL1 channel to view EGFP. Figure 6 shows that the pools generated with the gpCMV construct give EGFP expression levels three to four fold higher than those generated with the hCMV construct.<br>
Example 3<br>
CHO-K1 cells were cultured as described for Example 1. 1.5x1 0s CHO-K1 cells were<br>
seeded 24 hrs before transfection into 12-wells. 24 hrs later, cells were transfected with<br>
1 ug Luciferase reporter plasmid (phCMV-Luc or pgpCMV-Luc) using 1.5 ul FUGENE (Roche, UK). For this, FUGENE and DNA were both diluted separately in Opti-MEM I<br>
(Invitrogen), mixed together and incubated for 30 min at RT before added to the cells. Luciferase expression was analysed 24 hrs later uslng a Berthold luminometer (Berthold, Wildbad, Germany). Generally, cell lysis and luciferasei reporter assay were performed as described earlier (Lipinski et al.. Gene Therapy, 2001 (8): 274-281). Transfections were done in triplicate and the mean and standard deviation of one representative experiment are shown (Figure 7). Clearly the gpCMV vector was at least two-fold more active luciferase than the hCMV plasmid.<br>
The plasmid hCMV-Luc has been described earlier (Lipinski et al., Gene Therapy (2001) 8: 274-281). The plasmid gpCMV-Luc was generated by preparing a M/el/EcoRI fragment from pCRScript/gpCMV (customer gener synthesis company: Geneart, Regensburg, Germany) and cloning this gpCMV promoter fragment into the blunted Xhol site of pGL3basic (Promega).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
