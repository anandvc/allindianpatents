				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to systems for treating industrial waters, and especially to<br>
systems for treating recirculating water passing through air-conditioning systems, heat-<br>
exchangers, cooling towers or the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In air-conditioning systems such as are used, for example in hospitals, schools,<br>
office, apartment and other buildings it is common to pass recirculated water over the<br>
surfaces of evaporative coolers. Similar equipment is found in many processing plants<br>
including those in the chemical, paper, textile, mining and other industries.<br>
Make-up water typically contains dissolved chemicals which become<br>
progressively more concentrated in the recirculating water due to evaporative losses.<br>
This is especially the case in air conditioning systems and cooling circuits. Corrosion<br>
of the plant including pumps, pipes, tanks, heat exchangers, evaporative coolers etc, is<br>
a major problem and commonly the pH of the water rises. The corrosion problem is<br>
usually addressed by the addition of various water treatment chemicals. The present<br>
state of the corrosion inhibition art is summarised by Hartwick, D. in ASHRAE Journal,<br>
Feb 2001. The primary corrosion Inhibitors may be classified as being (1) reducing<br>
Agents, (2) oxidizing agents, or (3) film formers. Reducing agents are rarely used<br>
nowadays because of their drawbacks. Oxidizing agents (e.g. chromate, molybdate,<br>
nitrite) react directly with the metal surface. While chromate and molybdate are<br>
effective, they are now seldom used because of environmental and health concerns<br>
and in many States their use is banned. Nitrite in too low a concentration can cause<br>
severe pitting, and too little nitrite is worse than none at all because it will speed up the<br>
corrosion process. Exposure of nitrite to bacteria has the potential to oxidize nitrite to<br>
nitrate or reduce it to ammonia both of which can reduce the nitrite concentration with<br>
deleterious results. Attempting to control biological activity with oxidizing biocides will<br>
oxidize the nitrite to nitrate and the efficacy of non-oxidizing biocides tends to be less<br>
certain. Consequently use of nitrites has fallen into disfavour. Among the film formers<br>
ortho-phosphate and organic phosphonates are the most common inhibitors. They act<br>
by forming a protective film on metal surfaces, but suffers from a tendency to precipitate<br>
with metal ions or hardness salts in the bulk water.<br>
A second problem arises from the existence of slimes, bio-film, bacteria and<br>
fungi in waters. Slime and bio-film reduce pump efficiency and may seriously interfere<br>
with flow rates. In addition slimes reduce heat transfer across heat exchange surfaces,<br>
blind filters, and plug nozzles. The presence of slime and bio-film promotes corrosion<br>
because sessile bacteria in the slime or bio-film release acids and because the slime<br>
and bio-film adsorb and reduce the effectiveness of other water treatment chemicals.<br>
The term "slime" refers to a broad range of mucous, viscous, and leathery materials.<br>
These materials typically comprise or originate from polymeric, generally<br>
polysaccharide excretions produced by a broad spectrum of micro-organisms.<br>
In the past and up to the present biological deposits of all types including slime and bio-<br>
film are treated by the addition of biocides. Where slime and bio-film are present,<br>
biocides are frequently added in an effort to destroy the bacteria or microflora<br>
population which may produce the slimes. Chemicals which are used for this purpose<br>
included chlorine compounds such as chlorophenates; organomercurial compounds<br>
such as phenylmercuric acids; thiocarbamate compounds; thiocyanate compounds<br>
such as the isothiocyanates and methylene-bis-thiocyanate (MBT); tributyltin oxide; and<br>
the like. However, these chemicals are costly and highly toxic in the quantities known<br>
to be required for effective control of microbial populations. The possibility of their<br>
release into the environment is unacceptable, and their removal from water prior to<br>
disposal is uneconomical and poses risks of environmental pollution. Environment and<br>
occupational health and safety regulations now prevent the use of many such biocides<br>
in water treatment systems. Additionally, it appears that no precise correlation exists<br>
between the size of the bacterial population and the accumulation of slime or bio-film.<br>
Substantial slime accumulations have been observed even in waters having a low<br>
bacterial count. Similarly, high bacterial counts have been observed in waters having<br>
no significant slime accumulation. Consequently, use of a biocide may not adequately<br>
control biological slime or bio-film accumulations.<br>
A further problem arises from the presence of planktonic bacteria in air-<br>
conditioning and some other systems, and especially from bacteria harmful to humans<br>
such as Legionella. First discovered in 1976, Legionella has the unusual characteristic<br>
of causing two diseases - Legionnaires disease and Pontiac Fever. Legionnaires<br>
disease is a pneumonia which affects 2-5% of those exposed. Between 5-15% of those<br>
who contract the disease die from it. Pontiac Fever attacks 95% of those exposed.<br>
Planktonic bacteria exist as a suspension in the bulk water. Planktonic Legionella<br>
bacteria may be carried by air borne spray particles from the system. Legionella<br>
pneumophilia bacteria are pathogenic when inhaled after the water in which they are<br>
resident becomes atomised. They may infect, or indeed ultimately kill, persons in the<br>
vicinity. It is therefore important to keep bacterial levels below acceptable limits. No<br>
biocide at a level safe to use in an air-conditioning system is effective to kill both sessile<br>
and planktonic Legionella in an operating system.<br>
Legionella breeds in bio-film and slime and it is widely believed that that the<br>
best means of control is to close down a plant periodically for removal of the slime and<br>
bio-film eg by physical scrubbing and then treating with sodium hypochlorite to disinfect<br>
its surfaces. In fact, the Law in the State of New South Wales requires such action in<br>
water cooling towers at intervals of no longer than 3 months, and many other states<br>
have, or propose, similar legislation.<br>
In the last decade, as an alternative to treatment with biocides, it has been<br>
proposed that slime and bio-film accumulation be controlled by use of enzymes. The<br>
various proposals for slime and bio-film control using one or more enzymes can be<br>
classified into two main groups. The first group consists of enzyme treatments<br>
including one or more protease enzymes, and the second to enzyme systems having<br>
one or more enzymes but not including a protease. The enzymes specifically attack the<br>
slime layer surrounding sessile bacteria but have little effect on planktonic Bacteria.<br>
Much of the work conducted with enzymes has been directed primarily at paper<br>
production where conditions are excellent for growing slime and bio-film, where the<br>
damage to production from slime and bio-film is costly, and where corrosion is a<br>
relatively minor problem so that other water treatment chemicals are not a complicating<br>
factor. The emphasis in such systems is on slime and bio-film elimination. Bacteria are<br>
only a problem in paper making insofar as they produce more slime, and as there is no<br>
correlation of slime production with the presence of planktonic bacteria, it is sufficient to<br>
prevent sessile micro-organism multiplication.<br>
In contrast, the present inventor has found have found that in cooling towers the<br>
presence of an enzyme can result in an increase in planktonic Legionella concentration.<br>
It is believed this is partly because the enzyme physically releases micro-organisms<br>
trapped in the bio-film, and also partly because a large number of Legionella organisms<br>
may be engulfed within protozoa and thereby protected from the enzyme while the<br>
protozoa is released from the slime or bio-film . Experiments have shown that some<br>
species of Legionella can multiply intra-cellularly within certain free living protozoa.<br>
This may well be a hitherto unrecognised problem in paper mills and possibly<br>
elsewhere.<br>
A similar problem to that occurring in recirculating water systems occurs in tepid<br>
water systems such as are found in hospitals, nursing homes, schools, jails and hotels<br>
to provide "hot" water at a "safe" temperature to showers, wash-basins or in spa baths..<br>
For almost thirty years it has been known that Legionella species can colonise such<br>
tepid water systems . Legionella species have adapted themselves to survive<br>
temperatures of up to approximately 55°C, conditions which kill many competing<br>
organisms. Legionella pneumophilia bacteria are pathogenic. At least one death has<br>
been attributed to infection with Legionella contracted from inhalation of the water spray<br>
of a shower in a hospital tepid water system. Hitherto the only treatment recommended<br>
for tepid water systems has been to periodically flush with sodium hypochlorite. The<br>
present inventors have found that chlorine treatment is ineffective against sessile<br>
Legionella harboured in a biofilm in the interior of a tepid water system.<br>
Any discussion of the prior art throughout the specification should in no way be<br>
considered as an admission of the state of the common general knowledge in the field.<br>
Although the present invention is discussed with particular reference to Legionella it will<br>
be understood that similar considerations apply to many other micro-organisms<br>
including other harmful bacteria, fungi, moulds, etc. In water treatment systems the<br>
bacteria of general concern are gram positive.<br>
It has also been proposed to treat water with a combination of an enzyme and a<br>
biocide. US 4,684,469 (Pederson) describes a method to increase the antimicrobial<br>
activity of a biocide in an industrial water stream in which a selected biocide is<br>
combined with a polysaccharide degrading enzyme. Pederson used enzymes<br>
generated in-situ by bacterial cultures which are themselves pathogenic and unsuitable<br>
for use in industrial water systems. His preferred biocides are MBT and<br>
dithiocarbamates both of which are undesirable from an environmental and<br>
occupational health viewpoint. The preferred enzyme is a levan hydrolase. Pederson<br>
requires that the concentration of enzyme be monitored to maintain a concentration of<br>
at least 2ppm of a preparation having an activity of at least 500 u/ml. However<br>
monitoring can not be done automatically and requires time consuming and labour<br>
intensive laboratory analysis. The examples given by Pederson show that under<br>
laboratory conditions the enzyme alone has substantially zero (or a negative) effect on<br>
microbial colony formation. When biocide was added half an hour after enzyme<br>
addition, the reduction in colony formation of the combination was greater than the<br>
reduction obtained by the biocide alone by a factor of 3 log or 4 log. US 5,324,432<br>
(Robertson) noted that Levan Hydrolase had no effect on sheathed micro-organisms<br>
such as are found in paper mill systems and proposed to treat with a protease and a<br>
biocide. The preferred combination is DBNPA and trypsin. The only example given is<br>
"contemplative" and involves treatment of the water with enzymes for 1 -15 minutes<br>
followed by addition of hypochlorite.<br>
These proposals prefer to add the biocide separately from, and subsequently to,<br>
addition of an enzyme to the papermaking machine"s water stream. However<br>
simultaneous separate addition was considered feasible.<br>
The present applicant has found combinations of biocide/enzyme as proposed<br>
in the prior art are not effective in cooling towers. At first it was hypothesized that this<br>
may be due to deactivation of the enzymes by the biocides. The present inventor has<br>
found that in systems of the kind described by Pederson and Robertson the enzyme is<br>
virtually ineffective within two hours of addition of the biocide. Thus even in a<br>
favourable case the enzyme must be added continuously or repetitively at short (less<br>
than 2 hour, preferably less than 30 min) intervals. This renders the system<br>
impracticable because of the difficulty of monitoring enzyme activity in a cooling tower<br>
environment and because of the low effectiveness and high cost over time. However<br>
the present inventor has also found that in the presence of corrosion inhibitors, this<br>
problem of enzyme denaturation is greatly exacerbated making use of enzyme/biocide<br>
combinations impractical in cooling towers and too expensive to be considered.<br>
In summary, the present inventor has found that corrosion inhibitors in practical<br>
use in cooling towers nowadays de-activate enzymes either via direct oxidation or via<br>
surface absorption. In addition, enzymes are not compatible with most biocides which<br>
absorb onto enzyme proteins thus effectively deactivating enzymatic activity. Although<br>
some enzyme manufacturers claim that enzyme maintain their activity in a chlorine<br>
environment, the claim relates to laundry conditions and exposure times of around 10-<br>
15 minutes, as opposed to at least 24 hours as required for cooling tower maintenance.<br>
To date no treatment has proved to be capable of avoiding the need for closure<br>
of cooling towers at 3 monthly intervals for cleaning. Enzymes are not effective in<br>
systems treated with preferred modern primary corrosion inhibitors (i.e. oxidizing agents<br>
or film formers). Biocides, at levels deemed safe to use, are not effective because they<br><br>
cannot penetrate through bio-film and attack Legionella in the bio-film or the Legionella<br>
that is parasitic within protozoa . Moreover, biocides are unable to kill both sessile and<br>
planktonic bacteria at levels of biocide considered safe. Combinations of enzymes and<br>
biocides result in each deactivating the other and have been found to be ineffective in<br>
the presence of modern corrosion inhibitors which rapidly deactivate enzymes.<br>
No enzyme system, biocide, or enzyme/biocide combination from the prior art<br>
has been found which simultaneously meets the requirements for:<br>
(1) compatibility with corrosion inhibitors,<br>
(2) environmental acceptability,<br>
(3) health and safety acceptability,<br>
(4) ability to control bio-film containing Legionella and ability to control planktonic<br>
Legionella sufficiently so that closure of the plant for cleaning at three monthly intervals<br>
can be avoided.<br>
In addition, in the prior art when an enzyme and a biocide have been combined<br>
it has usually been necessary to add them separately. That is because the biocides<br>
have tended deactivate the enzymes or the enzymes to deactivate the biocides. This<br>
separation necessitates duplication of pumps, storage and feed tanks, as well as<br>
ancillary equipment for stirring, feed control and the like. It would be very<br>
advantageous to provide a water treatment composition which met all the requirements<br>
for treating water in an air-conditioning system or any other bulk water system and<br>
which could be combined in or delivered from a single container or tank. More<br>
preferably the combination would be available as a storage stable composition or<br>
concentrate.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a method of treatment of industrial<br>
recirculating water which avoids or ameliorates at least some of the above discussed<br>
disadvantages of prior art. It is an object of preferred embodiments of the invention to<br>
provide a method and composition which will avoid the need for plant closure, or at<br>
least prolong the period in which the plant can be safely operated without closure for<br>
cleaning.<br>
It is a further object to provide a method and composition for remediation of<br>
tepid water systems in which a biofilm harbours micro-organisms, such as for example,<br>
Legionella.<br>

after said contacting, and wherein the enzyme is selected to be of a kind and in a<br>
concentration sufficient to planktonise said sessile micro-organisms; and wherein said<br>
enzyme and said boron compound are synergistically effective in combination.<br>
More particularly, the invention provides a method of treatment of a recirculating<br>
water system containing an oxidizing or film forming corrosion inhibitor, said method<br>
including the steps of adding one or more enzymes at an initial level of activity to the<br>
system ; each of said enzymes having been conditioned with a sufficient concentration<br>
of a boron compound to maintain its activity at greater than 40% of the initial level in the<br>
presence of the corrosion inhibitor for more than 2 hours after the enzyme addition, and<br>
adding one or more biocides to the system.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention sufficient boron compound is added<br>
so as to maintain the activity of the one or more enzymes in the presence of the<br>
corrosion inhibitor at greater than about 40% of the initial level for more than 4hrs, and<br>
more preferably for longer than 8hrs. Highly preferred embodiments maintain the<br>
activity of the enzyme at greater than 40% of the initial activity for longer than 12 hours<br>
In some cases activity of greater than 75% and as much as 100% has been retained<br>
after 24 hrs.<br>
Preferably, the method further includes the step of adding at least one biocide;<br>
and<br>
wherein said boron conditioned enzyme retains a level of activity at least 40% of said<br>
initial activity for at least two hours after addition.<br>
The method of the present invention maybe particularly suited for those cases where<br>
the biofilm is in a recirculating water system. It is also suitable for use where the<br>
biofilm is in a non circulating tepid water system.<br>
 Preferably, the boron conditioned enzyme retains at least 40% of the initial<br>
activity of said enzyme for at least 12 hours and even more preferably the boron<br>
conditioned enzyme retains at least 75% of the initial activity of said enzyme for at least<br>

It is important to note that the boron conditioned enzyme may be formed by<br>
contacting said enzyme and said boron compound prior to their addition to water<br>
(preconditioned), or alternatively the boron conditioned enzyme is formed by contacting<br>
said enzyme with said boron compound in water.<br>
It is preferred that the boron conditioned enzyme and said biocide are added<br>

equivalent to 10 to 1000 Nu/g, more preferably 100-500 Nu/g and most preferably about<br>
300Nu/g.<br>
It is desirable that the enzyme be combined with the boron compound prior to<br>
addition to water containing a corrosion inhibitor, or shortly thereafter. Without wishing<br>
to be bound by theory, the boron compound apparently preconditions the enzyme so as<br>
to protect it from denaturation. Boron compounds are sometimes herein referred to as<br>
"boron" for simplicity.<br>
Preferably the boron compound is selected from borax, boric acid, boric oxides,<br>
ortho-borates, meta-borates pyro-borates, perborates, boronic acids or mixtures<br>

concentration of 0.01 to 10%, more preferably 0.1 to 10%<br>
Preferably, the biocide is selected from thiazole/imidazole biocides, nitroparaffin<br>
biocides, thiadiazines, dithiocarbamates, thiocyanates or quaternary ammonium<br>
chlorides or their mixtures thereof, and is preferably employed in a concentration of<br>
from 0.1 to 1000 ppm, more preferably 1 to 150 ppm, most preferably 10 to 50 ppm.<br>
The biocide is preferably of a kind and in a concentration which is environmentally<br>
acceptable, and which in combination with the enzyme is effective to prevent growth of<br>
Legionella micro-organisms in the system. Highly preferred biocides are selected from<br>

biocides (such as 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3 diol).<br>
In preferred embodiments water includes one or more corrosion inhibitors, such<br>
as an oxidising corrosion inhibitor or a film forming corrosion inhibitor.<br>
Preferably the enzymes are added at a rate to maintain an effective activity in<br>
the recirculating water over at least 12 hours and the biocide is selected to maintain<br>
combined planktonic and sessile bacteria at below 1000, and more desirably at below<br>
10cfu per ml.<br>
Preferably, the planktonic and sessile bacteria in total in said water are<br>
maintained at below 1000 cfu/ml, and more preferably below 10 cfu/ml.<br>
Preferably, the biocide in combination with said boron conditioned enzyme is<br>
effective in reducing growth of organisms selected from the group consisting of<br>
Legionella micro-organisms, Aerobacter levanicum, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>
Rhodoturula glutinis yeasts, Bacillus subtilis. Most preferably the biocide in<br>
combination with said boron conditioned enzyme is effective in reducing growth of<br>

said water; and wherein said enzyme and said biocide are synergistically effective in<br>
combination.<br>
According to a fourth aspect the invention provides a method of remediating a<br>
tepid water system harbouring Legionella including the steps of treating the system with<br>
at least one enzyme having an initial activity in water;<br>
conditioning said enzyme with a sufficient concentration of a boron compound to<br>
produce a boron conditioned enzyme; and<br>
wherein when said boron conditioned enzyme is in contact with said water it retains a<br>
level of activity at least 40% of said initial activity for at least two hours after contacting<br>
said water; and wherein said enzyme and said boron compound are synergistically<br>
effective in combination.<br>

In certain embodiments, the invention provides a composition including in<br>
combination one or more enzymes, one or more biocides, and sufficient boron<br>
compound to precondition and stabilize said one or more enzymes so as to maintain at<br>
least 40% of its initial activity after 2 hours when added to water containing up to a<br>
predetermined concentration of an oxidizing or a film forming corrosion inhibitor.<br>
The boron conditioned enzyme and biocide may be added together or<br>
separately and continuously or intermittently. However it is strongly preferred that the<br>
boron conditioned enzyme, and biocide are added substantially simultaneously. More<br>
preferably they are added together in combination by making up a solution from a<br>
composition according to the second aspect. In practice of the invention the addition<br>
may be continuous or repeated at short intervals but for preference is repeated at long<br>
time intervals e.g. at 8,12, or 24 hour intervals. If desired the composition may also<br>
include selected corrosion inhibitors.<br>
The present applicant has found that unprotected enzymes are deactivated<br>
within about one hour by both biocides and by corrosion inhibitors. For example the<br><br>
present inventor has found that a protease when combined with a biocide such as 2,2-<br><br>
dibromo-3-nitriloproionamide (DBNPA) retains less than 5% of its activity after 1 hour in<br>
an industrial recirculating water system containing modern corrosion inhibitors. The<br>
present inventor has also found , on the other hand, that biocides at concentrations<br>
which are environmentally and otherwise safe to use, only become fully effective after<br>
several hours and may require 12 hours in the presence of an active enzyme to be<br>
effective. If the enzyme can be sufficiently stabilized to retain greater than 50% of its<br>
activity for say 8 or 12 hours, then the combination is astonishingly effective in<br>
comparison with prior art in systems containing corrosion inhibitors.<br>
Preferably the enzyme is selected from a group consisting of proteases, carbohydrases,<br>
esterases, hydrazes, amylases, catalases, lipases, cellulases, peroxidases, invertases,<br>
levanbiohydrolases and mixtures thereof. More preferably the enzyme is a protease,<br>
an amylase or mixtures thereof.<br>
For preference the enzyme is one or more enzymes selected from the group<br>
consisting of selected from the group consisting of proteases, carbohydrases,<br>
esterases, hydrazes, amylases, catalases, lipases, amylases, cellulases, peroxidases,<br>
invertases, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the protease is employed in a concentration sufficient to provide an<br>
activity of 5E-4 to 10E-3Au/g in use, more preferably 1E-3 to 3E-3Au/g in use and most<br>
preferably about 2.5E-3Au/g in use. Preferably, amylase is employed in a<br>
concentration sufficient to provide an activity of 10 to 1000 Nu/g in use, more preferably<br>
100-500 Nu/g in use and most preferably about 300Nu/g in use.<br>
Preferably, the boron compound is selected from borax boric acid, boric oxides,<br>
orthoborates, meta borates or pyroborates, perborates boronic acids or mixtures<br>
thereof, preferably in a concentration of 0.1 to 10%.<br>
While boron compounds have previously been added to enzymes to prevent<br>
autoproteolytic activity and to stabilize enzymes against deterioration in transit and<br>
storage they have not hitherto been combined with an enzyme in a concentration<br>
selected to protect the enzyme against the effect of corrosion inhibitors, or biocides, or<br>
for the purpose of maintaining the activity of the enzyme over time in the presence of<br>
those agents. Suitable boron compounds are boric acid, boric oxide, sodium ortho-,<br>
meta -, or pyro - borate and perborates. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art, boron has previously been combined with enzymes in small concentrations to<br>
protect an enzyme from autolysis or to act as a preservative during storage and<br>
shipment but it has not been practiced to pre-treat an enzyme with a boron compound<br>
in a concentration selected to protect the enzyme from loss of activity in the presence of<br>
corrosion inhibitors or the like.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention the efficacy of the boron compound is<br>
enhanced by addition of a suitable solvent such as a polyol or other micelle immiscible<br>
Solvent.<br>
In preferred embodiment, a polyol solvent is added to said boron compound.<br>
The polyol solvent is preferably selected from glycerol, propylene glycol, mixtures of<br>
glycerol and propylene glycol, and other micelle immiscible solvents.<br>
The biocide is preferably selected from thiazole/imidazole biocides, nitroparaffin<br>
biocides, thiadiazines, dithiocarbamates, thiocyanates, quaternary ammonium chlorides<br>
or their mixtures thereof. Preferably the biocide is employed in a concentration of from<br>
0.1 to 10%, more preferably 1 to 10%.<br>
As stated above highly preferred biocides for use in the invention are selected<br>

with reference to the accompanying data.<br>
Example 1 Effect of various corrosion inhibitors and various biocides on various<br>
enzymes<br>
Experiments conducted by the inventor have shown that enzymes are not stable<br>
in the presence of most corrosion inhibitors. Since abandoning chromium-based<br>
corrosion inhibitors and progressive phasing out molybdenum and inorganic<br>
phosphonates, fully organic corrosion inhibitors (such as 1-Hydroxyethylidene-1,1-<br>
diphosphonic acid, Sulfonate styrene/maleic anhydride copolymer, polyacrylates) have<br>
become industry standard. The latter group of inhibitors has detrimental effect on<br>

with known level of enzymes. After exposure of enzymes to the denaturing action of<br>
corrosion inhibitors and/or biocides for a pre-determined period of time (1,2,6,24 hrs), a<br>
known amount of a bacterial/fungal inoculum is added to the cooling water. This is to<br>
simulate a typical situation in cooling towers when microorganisms are introduced as a<br>
result of disturbing biofilm.<br>
The microorganisms are exposed to the combination of an enzymes with cooling water<br>

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS:<br>
Example 1, Tables 1-4, show that enzymes such as protease and amylase at<br>
both low and high concentrations are reduced to less than about 2% of their original<br>
activity (i.e. to below the threshold of detection in these experiments) in the presence of<br>
a wide range of corrosion inhibitors within about 2 hours in most cases, and are<br>
substantially ineffective within one hour in most cases at affordable concentrations. In<br>
no case was the concentration above 2% of the starting concentration after 3 hours.<br>
Example 1, Tables 5-10, show that biocides similarly reduce the efficacy of the <br>
enzymes to less than 1 or 2% of their starting concentration within about 2 to 3 hours<br>
after addition at both low and high concentrations.<br>
Example 2, tables 11 to 13, demonstrate that pre-conditioning of enzymes with<br>
boron compounds according to the invention serves to maintain their activity in the<br>
presence of commercially useful concentrations of common corrosion inhibitors. In<br>
each case the enzyme maintains at least about 40% and in some cases above 60% of<br>
its activity for 24 hours In the case of preferred embodiment formulation 3 the activity<br>
retained is from about 60 % to about 90% after 24 hours.<br>
Preferably the boron compound is combined with a solvent and more particularly<br>
with a solvent which facilitates dissolution of the boron in water for example a polyol<br>
such as propylene glycol. In the examples shown in tables 11 to 13, the biocides were<br>
introduced into the "cooling water" in concentrations such as are in general use. The<br>
compositions of the invention extend the enzyme activity in a bulk water environment<br>
sufficiently to make simultaneous addition of a isothiazolin and / or nitroparafftn biocide<br>
with enzyme a commercially feasible alternative to the use of biocides alone, but at<br>
much reduced biocide concentration in comparison to the prior art use of biocide alone.<br>
Example 3, tables 14 and 15, shows that of several common biocides trialed,<br>
formulations according to the invention in which an isothiazolin biocide (Kathon® KT - 5<br>
chloro-2 methyl 4 isothiazolin-3-one + 2 methyl 4 isothiazolin-3-one) and a nitroparaffin<br>
biocide (?-bromo-2nitropropane-1,3) were selected as the biocide for use unexpectedly<br>
gave surprisingly superior results in combination with enzymes. The preferred<br>
combination maintained activity over a long period even in the presence of corrosion<br>
inhibitors, and even when the concentration of the biocides exceed recommended<br>
concentrations in cooling tower by a factor of 10-15.<br>
Example 4 (table 16 - exp 1) shows that the Pederson prior art preferred biocide,<br>
MBT, at 22 ppm in the absence of an enzyme gives at least a 5 log reduction after 1 hr<br>
and remains better than 50% effective after 24 hrs. Moreover in the presence of the<br>
preferred enzyme, but absence of a corrosion inhibitor (exp. 2), MBT gives the same or<br>
better results as in the absence of the enzyme over 2hrs but not over 24 hrs. However,<br>
in the presence of a corrosion inhibitor, the MBT plus Levan Biohydrolase prior art<br>
combination fails (exp. 4). The presence of corrosion inhibitor reduces the<br>
effectiveness of the MBT/levan biohydrolase combination to less than the that of the<br>
MBT alone within 1 hour (exp 4), and the combination has an effectiveness of less than<br>
1 log reduction after less than 2 hours. This means that in practice the continuous<br>
addition of enzyme or repeated addition at intervals of about one hour would be<br>
required which would create serious enzyme activity monitoring problems, and make<br>
the process totally uneconomical for use in bulk water or air conditioning systems.<br>
These results are consistent with Pederson"s own data . Pederson"s experiments (in a<br>
system which did not contain corrosion inhibitors) showed that when the biocide was<br>
added 2 hours after enzyme addition the improvement of the combination over the<br>
biocide alone was less than 1 log although Pederson did not comment on this.<br>
Example 5 (table 17) shows that formulations according to the present invention are<br>
significantly more effective than the prior art combination in the presence of a corrosion<br>
inhibitor (as exemplified by Table 16 exp 3). Table 17 exp 1 shows that preferred<br>
embodiments formulated according to the invention, retain their effectiveness after 24<br>
hours even in the presence of denaturing corrosion inhibitors and/or biocides. The<br>
biocidal action of the combination is significantly better than biocide alone. Even the<br>
MBT/Levan biohydrolase combination from the prior art when conditioned with a boron<br>
compound according to the invention (table 17 - exp.4) retains some activity for 24<br>
hours. However, under conditions found in cooling towers, the MBT/Levan<br>
biohydrolase is among the least effective of the tested combinations according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Table 18 shows that the results obtained with Aerobacter levanicum (table 17)<br>
are equally applicable in the case of P. aerugnosa bacteria( table 18). Combinations<br>
according to the invention in which the enzymes are combined with boron or boron<br>
compounds have increased stability against the denaturing action of corrosion inhibitors<br>
and/or biocides. The biocidal action of the combined boron plus enzyme plus biocide is<br>
significantly better than biocide alone, whilst non-formulated enzymes after 1 hour show<br>
little or no improvement in biocidal action over biocide alone. Note a significant<br>
increase in concentrations of all biocides because P. aeruginosa is more resistant to the<br>
biocides.<br>
Table 19, 20 shows that similar results are evident with Rhodoturula glutinis<br>
yeast, and B. subtilis respectively. Again the enzymes plus boron are more stable<br>
against the denaturing action of corrosion inhibitors and/or biocides. The fungicidal<br>
action of the combined [boron plus enzyme plus biocide] is significantly better than<br>
biocide alone.<br>
Table 21 shows that in water treated with corrosion inhibitors and containing Legionella,<br>
treatments according to the invention result in a 4 log reduction in Legionella after 4<br>
hours and for up to at least 24 hours. In contrast, a simple combination of the same<br>
enzymes and biocide in the presence of corrosion inhibitors but in the absence of<br>
preconditioning with a boron compound does not maintain its activity beyond about 2<br>
hours, giving an almost undetectable log reduction in Legionella after 6 hours.<br>
Example 8<br>
Tepid water system remediation trial.<br>
A tepid water system remediation trial was conducted in a hospital under the<br>
scrutiny of appropriate Health Department officers. The institution was a tepid water<br>
system whose temperature range was 46.5 to 49.1°C. The treatment took place<br>
overnight with all access to the tepid water outlets being barred for the six hours of the<br>
trial. The product used was a two part product, the first part containing the conditioned<br>
enzyme, the second the biocide. Both parts were added into the bulk water system at a<br>
rate of 200 to 250 parts of water to 1 part product. The product was dosed into the<br>
circuit via a tepid water storage tank. All the taps and showers were opened slightly to<br>
ensure some small flow, with the water running to waste.<br>
The enzymes which have been found to be particularly suited to digest biofilm at<br>
higher temperature in accordance with the present invention, such as found in tepid or<br>
warmer water systems include the following Proteases such as Protinase T, Panazyme;<br>
Cellulases such as Promalt, Oloclast; Amylases such as Nervanase, Sbozzimante<br>
SPC; and Lipases such as Lipozyme, Any or all of these are suited for remediation of<br>
tepid water systems.<br>
Water samples were taken from various sampling points on the tepid water<br>
circuit for microbiological assessment prior to the trial. After six hours, all the taps and<br>
showers were fully opened so as to dissipate the product dosed in the system. A food<br>
grade dye was added as an indicator, and the absence of a visible detectable colour<br>
indicated a safe level (parts per million) of the enzyme. The water was sampled after<br>
completion of the water rinse cycle. The tepid water system was then put into normal<br>
service, and sampled again after six days. The collection technique involved collecting<br>
a sample for 30 seconds. All the water temperatures were in the 46.5 to 49.1 °C. ranges<br>
disclosed above.<br>
The results showed a significant level of remediation of the tepid water system.<br>
On the basis of the above results, the remediation would be repeated monthly.<br>
For use in lower temperature systems, such as cool or ambient temperature<br>
water, the following enzymes have been found to be more particularly suited: Proteases<br>
such as Savinase, Chymotrypsin; Cellulases such as 1,4(1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan 4-<br>
glocanohydrolase; Amylases such as amylozyme, highdiastase and Lipases such as L<br>
lipase, takamine lipase.<br>
The two can be used in conjunction, using the higher temperature enzyme<br>
systems to clean the hot water system, and the low temperature enzyme systems to<br>
treat the cold water systems. Alternatively, both can be employed on the same system<br>
to planktonise sessile biofilm if the temperature profile of the whole water system<br>
warrants this or is unknown.<br>
Thus, in summary, corrosion is a major problem in recirculating water systems.<br>
The existence of micro-organisms is also a major problem in those systems. Enzymes<br>
are deactivated by modern acceptable corrosion inhibitors and by biocides. Biocides<br>
alone, at safe levels of use, are not effective in killing both sessile and planktonic<br>
bacteria. Combinations of biocide and enzyme which have been suggested in the past<br>
are not effective in systems containing corrosion inhibitors because the enzymes are<br>
substantially deactivated! in less than an hour, and because at safe levels of use<br>
biocides require much longer than that to be effective. The vast majority of non-<br>
oxidising biocides kill bacteria via absorption onto the cell membrane. Biocides can<br>
also absorb onto enzyme proteins thus biocides also effectively deactivate enzymatic<br>
activity. Similar problems occur in tepid water systems wherein sessile micro-<br>
organisms are harboured within a biofilm. Hitherto it has been usual to treat such<br>
systems with chlorine agents such as hypochlorite, but these have only been effective<br>
against planktonic micro-organisms, leaving sessile micro-organisms viable within the<br>
biofilm.<br>
The present inventor has found that by adding or increasing the concentration of<br>
boron in the formulation sufficiently, a point can be reached at which the enzyme will<br>
retain at least 40% of its activity for 24 hours, and in some cases can retain almost<br>
100% of its activity for that period. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
compositions according to the invention may use combinations of enzymes and<br>
biocides other than those exemplified and may formulate the compositions in other<br>
concentrations and with other additives without departing from the inventive concept<br>
herein disclosed.<br>
