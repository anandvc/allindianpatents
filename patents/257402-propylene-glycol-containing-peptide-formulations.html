				<td>PROPYLENE GLYCOL-CONTAINING PEPTIDE FORMULATIONS WHICH ARE OPTIMAL FOR PRODUCTION AND FOR USE IN INJECTION DEVICES<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical formulations comprising a peptide and propylene glycol, to methods of preparing such formulations, and to uses of such formulations in the treatment of diseases and conditions for which use of the peptide contained in such formulations is indicated. The present invention further relates to methods for reducing the clogging of injection devices by a peptide formulation and for reducing deposits on production equipment during production of a peptide formulation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The inclusion of isotonicity agents in peptide-containing pharmaceutical formulations is widely known and one of the more common isotonic agents used in such formulations is mannitol. However, the present inventors have observed that mannitol causes problems during the production of peptide formulations as it crystallizes resulting in deposits in the production equipment and in the final product. Such deposits increase the need to clean the filling equipment during production of the formulation and this results in reduced production capability. In addition, such deposits may also result in reduced yield of the final product since vials/cartridges containing the peptide formulation may need to be discarded if particles are present. Finally, the present inventors have observed that in peptide formulations to be administered by injection, the presence of mannitol results in clogging of injection devices.<br>
Accordingly, it is desirable to identify an alternative isotonic agent to mannitol for inclusion in peptide-containing formulations and in particular, for inclusion in peptide formulations which are administered by injection.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have discovered that peptide formulations containing propylene glycol at certain concentrations exhibit reduced deposits in production equipment and in the final product and also exhibit reduced clogging of injection devices. The present compositions may be formulated with any peptide and are also physically and chemically stable thus rendering them shelf-stable and suitable for invasive (eg. injection, subcutaneous injection, intramuscular, intraveneous or infusion ) as well as non-invasive (eg nasal, oral, pulmonary, transdermal or transmucosal e.g. buccal) means of administration.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a pharmaceutical formulation comprising a peptide and propylene glycol, where the propylene glycol is present in a concentration of 1-<br><br>
1UO mg/ml and the pH of the formulation is from 7-10. In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention further contain a buffer and a preservative.<br>

water; and<br>
d)	adjusting the pH of the mixture in c) to the desired pH.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the method for preparing a peptide formulation comprises:<br>
a)	preparing a solution by dissolving preservative, buffer and propylene glycol in<br>
water;<br>
b)	adding the peptide to the solution of step a); and<br>

The present invention further relates to methods of treatment using the pharmaceutical formulations of the invention where the compositions are administered in an amount effective to combat the disease, condition, or disorder for which administration of the peptide contained in the formulation is indicated.<br>
In addition the present invention also relates to a method for reducing deposits on production equipment during production of a peptide formulation, where the method comprises replacing the isotonicity agent previously utilized in said formulation with propylene glycol at a concentration of between 1-100 mg/ml.<br>
In one embodiment, the reduction in deposits on the production equipment during production by the propylene glycol-containing formulation relative to that observed for the<br><br>
formulation containing the previously utilized isotonicity agent is measured by a simulated filling experiment.<br>
The present invention also relates to a method for reducing deposits in the final product during production of a peptide formulation, where the method comprises replacing the isotonicity agent previously utilized in said formulation with propylene glycol at a concentration of between 1-100 mg/ml.<br>
In one embodiment, the reduction in deposits in the final product is measured by a reduction in the number of vials and/or cartridges of the propylene glycol-containing formulation that must be discarded due to deposits relative to number of vials and/or cartridges of the formulation containing the previously utilized isotonicity agent that must be discarded due to deposits.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method for reducing the clogging of injection devices by a peptide formulation, where the method comprises replacing the isotonicity agent previously utilized in said formulation with propylene glycol at a concentration of between 1-100 mg/ml.<br>
In one embodiment, the reduction in clogging of the injection device by the propylene glycol-containing formulation relative to that observed for the formulation containing" the previously utilized isotonicity agent is measured in a simulated in use study.<br>

All scientific publications and patents cited herein are specifically incorporated by reference. The following examples illustrate various aspects of the invention but are in no way intended to limit the scope thereof.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Simulated filling experiments, drop and clogging tests of replacement candidates for<br>
mannitol<br><br>
As laboratory experiments have shown that with regards to clogging of needles and deposits on needles, formulations without peptide ("placebo") give the same conclusions as formulations with peptide at 0.3-5.0 mg/ml, the screening studies in Example 1 have been done using placebo except where indicated otherwise.<br>
Preparation of Formulations With Different Isotonic Agents<br>
Preservative (5.5 mg/ml phenol) and buffer 1,24 mg/ml disodium hydrogen phosphate, di-hydrate) were dissolved in water and the isotonic agent was added while stirring. pH was adjusted to pH 7.9 using Sodium Hydroxide and/or Hydrochloric acid. Finally, the formulation was filtered through a 0.22 urn filter. The isotonic agents tested in each formulation and their concn-trations are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1      Composition of the tested formulations (Table Remove)<br>
jpfcmolarity<br>
The osmolarity of the different placebo formulations was determined and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
An isotonic solution has an osmolarity of around 0.286 osmol/L. As can be seen from Table 2 three of the formulations (PEG 400, sucrose and xylitol) are more than 20% from being isotonic ( 0.229-0.343 osmol/l), however for these kind of experiments the osmolarity is not expected to influence the results, though, the tonicity of the formulations should be adjusted in future experiments.<br>
1 Table 2.    The measured osmolarity of the formulations (Table Remove)<br><br>
Drop test<br>
A droplet of each formulation is placed on a microscope slide and let to dry. The deposit is visually examined by eye and light microscope.<br>
A photograph of the dried droplets of some of the formulations is shown in Figure 1. In this figure it is clearly observed that mannitol cause deposits on the microscope slide when let to dry. No deposits were observed for sorbitol, xylitol, sucrose and glycerol. The droplet on the far right (Form 1) contains mannitol and Arg34, Lys26(Ne-(y-Glu(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37).<br>
In Figure 2, the candidates causing the most deposits on the microscope slide are shown. For comparison glycerol, which does not cause deposits, is shown (mannitol, arginine, inositol).<br>
Clogging test<br>
In this test 10 NovoPens® 1.5 ml mounted with NovoFine 30® G (G 30 needle) were tested for each formulation, 5 of them placed in upright and 5 in horizontal position. The Pensystems were stored at room temperature in between testing. Each day the needle was examined for deposits and an air shot was performed prior to injection into a tissue. Degree of resistance and clogging, if any, was noted. Injections were made on a daily basis with the same needle, and this was done for 9 working days for all the formulations.<br>
results from the clogging test are shown in Table 3. (Table Remove)<br><br>
In Table 3 and in Figure 3 it was observed that inositol and maltose clogged the needle. For comparison glycerol which does not clog the needle is shown in Figure 3. In Figure 4, and in Table 3, it was observed that formulations containing glycine, lactose and mannitol gave rise to a tot of deposits on the needle. For glycine, the deposits were a droplet deposited down the needle, whereas for lactose and mannitol the deposits occurred at the top of the needle.<br>
Simulated filling<br>
,l. of each formulation was subjected to a simulated filling experiment which lasted for 24 hours. After 24 hours the filling equipment was inspected for the presence of deposits.<br>
Based on the results from the simulated filling studies (data not shown), the placebo formulations can be divided into three categories. 1. Those isotonic agents that do not cause deposits on the filling equipment: Xylitol, glycerol, glucose monohydrate, maltose, PEG 400 and propyl-ene glycol. 2. Those isotonic agent that cause few deposits and have superior filling properties compared to mannitol: Sorbitol, sucrose and glycine. 3. Those isotonic agent that are comparable or worse than mannitol: Mannitol, lactose monohydrate, arginin, myo-inositol and dimethyl-sulfon.<br>
Conclusion<br>
In the simulated filling experiment xylitol, glycerol, glucose, maltose, PEG 400, propylene glycol, sorbitol, sucrose and glycine were found to be suitable replacements candidates for mannitol. However, as glucose is a reducing saccharide, and therefore is able to initiate unwanted degradation in the formulation, this tonicity modifier is ruled out. Furthermore, maltose is ruled out due to clogging of needles. This leads to the following candidates: glycerol, xylitol, sorbitol, sucrose, glycine, propylene glycol and PEG 400, which are found to have suitable properties as replacements candidates for mannitol in peptide formulations with regards to drop test, clogging of needles and simulated filling.<br>
However, on the basis of the following considerations, propylene glycol was chosen as the isotonic agent over the other candidates to be further investigated in head to head comparison studies with mannitol:<br>
a.	propylene glycol was observed to have no influence on the physical and<br>
chemical stability of Arg34, Lys26(NE-(y-Glu(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-<br>
37)-containing formulations;<br>
b.	propylene glycol was observed to have no influence on antimicrobial<br>
preservative testing; and<br>
c.	use of propylene glycol would no require that further toxicity studies be<br>
tested<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Comparison Of Mannitol and Propylene Glycol-Containing Placebo Formulations In Simulated Filling Studies and Simulated Use Studies<br>
Preparation of Formulations<br>
Preservative and buffer were dissolved in water and the isotonic agent was added while stirring. pH was adjusted to the aimed pH using Sodium Hydroxide and/or Hydrochloric acid. Finally, the formulation was filtered through a 0.22 urn filter. The compositions of the formulations were as follows:<br>
Disodium hydrogen phosphate, dihydrate: 1.42 mg/ml<br>
Phenol:	5.5 mg/ml<br>
Propylene glycol or mannitol:	13.7 or 35.9 mg/ml<br>
Water for Injection:	up to 1.0 ml.<br>
pH: 7.90<br>
Simulated Filling Study<br>
A simulated filling study lasting 24 hours was performed as described in Example 1 and after 24 hours, the filling equipment was inspected for the presence of deposits. No deposits were observed on the filling equipment for the propylene glycol formulation. By comparison, after 24 hours, a lot of deposits were observed on the filling equipment for the mannitol formulation (see Figure 6).<br>
Simulated In Use Study<br>
For the simulated in use study, a clogging test was conducted as described in Example 1. The same needle was used during the study period of ten working days and each day, the needle was inspected for the presence of deposits. Figure 7 shows photographs of needles dosed with the propylene glycol (top panel) or mannitol (bottom panel) containing formulations. Deposits on the needle were observed in 48% of the cases when mannitol was used as an isotonic agent whereas no deposits were observed when propylene glycol was used as the isotonic agent.<br>
Example 3<br>
Comparison of Propylene Glycol to Mannitol In Arg34, Lys26{NXY^&gt;Iu(Na4iexacleceuioyl)))-GLP-1(7-37) Containing Formulations<br>
Preparation of Formulations<br>
Preservative, isotonic agent (mannitol or propylene glyool) and buffer were dissolved in water and pH was adjusted to the desired pH. Arg34, Lys*(^-(y-Glu(Na-riexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37) was dissolved in water while stirring slowly. The two solutions were then mixed and pH adjusted to the desired pH using sodium hydroxide and/or hydrochloric acid. Finally, the formulation was filtered through a 0.22 urn filter. The compositions of the formulations were as follows:<br>
Arg34, Lys26(Ne-(Y-GIu(N°-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37) (6.25 mg/ml), Disodium hydrogen phosphate, dihydrate (1.42 mg/ml), Phenol (5.5 mg/ml),<br>
mannitol or propylene glycol (35.9 or 14.0 mg/ml), Water for Injection (up to 1.0 ml), pH:8.15<br>
Simulated In Use Study<br>
For the simulated in use study, a clogging test was conducted as described in Example 1 except that a G31 needle was used. The same G31 needle was used during the study period of ten working days and each day. the needle was inspected for the presence of deposits. Figure 7 shows photographs of needles with no deposits when dosed with the propylene glycol (bottom panel) or showing deposits when dosed with the mannitol (top panel) containing formulations.<br>
For the mannitol containing formulation, clogging of the needle was observed in 1 out of 10 cases on day 4, 2 out of 10 cases on day 5, 3 out of 10 cases on day 8 and 4 out of 10 cases on day 9. By comparison, no clogging of needles was observed for the propylene glycol containing formulation.<br>
It is believed that similar results to those obtained with the above-described propylene glycol-containing formulation would also be obtained if the pH was adjusted to 7.40, 7.70 or 7.90. In addition, additional formulations which could be tested include those having the following compositions:<br>
Buffering agents: glycylglycine (1.32 mg/ml), L-Histidine (1.55 mg/ml), Hepes (2.38 mg/ml), or bicine (1.63 mg/ml)<br><br>
Preservatives: phenol (5.0 or 5.5 mg/ml), benzylalcohol (18 mg/ml) or a mixture of m-cresol and phenol (2.5/2.0 mg/ml)<br>
Propylene glycol: 14.0 or 14.3 mg.ml Water for injection: up to 1.0 ml pH: 7.40, 7.70, 7.90 or 8.15<br>
Example 4 Influence of Peptide Concentration On Clogging of Needles<br>
Arg34, LysZ6(NXY-G'u(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1 (7-37) formulations were prepared as described in Example 3 using peptide concentrations ranging from 0-5 mg/ml of Arg34, Lys26(N£-(y-Glu(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37). The compositions of the formulations were as follows:<br>
Liraglutide: 0, 0.3, 3 and 5 mg/ml Disodium hydrogen phosphate, dihydrate: 0.71 mg/ml Sodium dihydrogenphosphate, dihydrate: 0.62 mg/ml Mannitol: 36.9 mg/ml Phenol: 5.0 mg/ml Water for injection: up to 1.0 ml pH 7.40<br>
A simulated in use study was conducted as in Example 3 except that a G30 needle was used and the results (data not shown) indicated that the clogging effect of the mannitol-containing formulations relative to the absence of clogging with the propylene glycol formulations was observed independent of the peptide concentration.<br>

Results<br>
A simulated in use study was conducted as described in Example 3 using G31 needles where 20 needles were investigated for 10 days. The results were as follows: Clogging of needles was observed for Lys B29 (Ne-tetradecanoyI) des(B30) human insulin on day 2 (5%), day 3 (70%) and on day 4 (100%). Clogging of needles for NovoMix 30 was observed on day 3 (5%), day 4 (10%), day 5 (35%), day 6 (40%), day 8 (50%), day 9 (55%) and day 10 (80%). Thus, the effect of mannitol on the clogging of needles is independent of the type of peptide included in the formulations since a comparable clogging effect was observed with Arg34, Lys26(Ne-(Y-Glu(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37), Lys B29 (Ne-tetradecanoyI) des(B30) human insulin and NovoMix 30.<br>

The preparation and composition of the Lys B29 (Ne-tetradecanoyI) des(B30) human insulin and NovoMix 30 formulations will be as described in Example 5 except that mannitol will be replaced with a concentration of propylene glycol that assures tonicity. A simulated in use test will then be conducted as described in Example 5.<br>
Based on the fact that the clogging effect of Lys 1129 (Ne-tetradecanoyI) des(B30) human insulin and NovoMix 30 mannitol-containing formulations was similar to that observed with Arg34, Lys26(Nc-(y-Glu(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1 (7-37) mannitol-containing formulations, it is believed that the effect of propylene glycol on the clogging effect of Lys IS29 (Ne-tetradecanoyI) des(B30) human insulin and NovoMix 30-containing formulations will be similar to that observed with Arg34, Lys26(Ne-(y-Glu(Na-hexadecanoyl)))-GLP-1(7-37)-containing formulations.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
