				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel synthetic peptide epitope having the amino acid sequence Leucyl-asparaginyl-prolyl-lysyl-threonyl-asparaginyl-lysyl-tryptophanyl-glutamyl-aspartyl-lysyl-arginyl-tyrosine useful for the diagnosis of Aspergillosis.<br>
The above said peptide is useful for diagnosis of aspergillosis by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The peptide of the present invention can be used to raise polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies m mice which are useful for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis by antigen detection.<br>
Reference can be made to Clinical Microbiological reviews, Oct. 1991, p. 439-56, wherein fungi, Aspergillus fumigatus causes a wide spectrum of human and animal disorders such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), extrinsic allergic alveolitis, aspergilloma, and invasive aspergillosis. Invasive form of aspergillosis is becoming increasingly important in immunosuppressed conditions due to environmental pollution, enhanced use of chemotherapeutic drugs and antibiotics etc. The most susceptible hosts are the immunocompromised patients, such as the cases with organ transplant, leukemia, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Currently available tests for identification of this fungi is based on tedious, time consuming , less sensitive methods such as microscopy, cultures, electrophoresis and immunodiffusion. Many clinical features of aspergillosis are similar to tuberculosis and most of the aspergillosis patients are put on antituberculous therapy. The microscopy of the specimen for identification of Aspergillus hyphae is not easy under field conditions and specimen<br>
for identification of Aspergillus hyphae is not easy under field conditions and specimen from the patients in the early stages of disease are often negative in the direct mounts. Further, the fungal culture generally takes 3-4 weeks and is expensive as a routine diagnostic measure. The widely used skin testing for Aspergillus allergic patients lacks sensitivity and specificity as the mixture of allergens used for testing is not well characterised and needs standardisation. The steroid therapy used for allergic patients and chemotherapy for invasive patients are more beneficial when employed in the early stages of the disease. Consequent to these factors, many investigators recommend that early diagnosis of aspergillosis should be considered as a priority area of research and development.<br>
Reference can be made to J. Med. Vet. Mycol. 22 : 381-394, Int. Arch. Allergy Appl. Immunol. 70: 108-111 wherein an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based sensitive test using a mixture of potent Aspergillus fumigatus antigens has been developed which provides a rapid diagnosis in early stages of the disease. However, there are variations in the mixture obtained from various clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus. Further, the present test is antibody based and thus is not useful for invasive patients.<br>
Reference can be made to Mycopathologia, 106 : 121-129, 1989, Applied Environmental Microbiology, 56: 2441-2452, 1990, Journal of Genetic Microbiology, 136: I99I-I994, 1990, Journal of Clinical Microbiology, 29 : 2099-2106, 1991,wherein an alternative method of diagnosis of aspergillosis has been the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridisation. Various groups have identified and synthesised primers for genes specific to A. fumigatus.<br>
Reference can be made to Preparative Biochemistry, 25 : 171-181, 1995, wherein a PCR<br>
based test specific for A. fumigatus has been developed. Gene based tests are highly<br>
sensitive and specific in comparison to immunodiagnosis. However, at present no gene<br>
based diagnostic kit for aspergillosis is available in the market as routine use of this test<br>
proves very expensive.<br>
Reference can be made to Methods in Enzymology, 178 : 571-717, wherein, peptides<br>
mimicking the epitope in native antigens have been utilised in diagnosis as well as<br>
therapy of hepatitis, influenza, malaria, AIDS etc. Peptides based diagnosis of<br>
aspergillosis would be standardised and cost-effective. Hence, an antigenic determinant<br>
of a major allergen/ antigen (Asp f 1) secreted by Aspergillus fumigatus was identified<br>
and synthesised. Asp f I is diagnostically relevant for allergic as well as invasive<br>
aspergillosis.<br>
Reference can be made to J. Immunology, 149: 454-60, 1992, J.Immunology 149: 3354-<br>
3359, 1992, XVI lUBMB Abstract S-142, 1994 wherein the gene for Asp f 1 has been<br>
cloned and sequenced. The three genes were isolated from different strains however, the<br>
sequences obtained from all the three were similar.<br>
Reference can be made to Peptides, 17: 183-190, 1996, wherein some peptides of Asp f 1<br>
have been synthesised but none of the sequences revealed by them is related to the<br>
sequence of the present invention. Further, they have not indicated diagnostic relevance<br>
of these peptides.<br>
The present synthetic peptide is a sequential epitope which is able to bind the A.<br>
fumigatus specific IgG and IgE antibodies in the sera of patients of aspergillosis. Further,<br>
it is able to raise significant amount of antibodies in the mice and these polyclonal antibodies can be used for diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel synthetic peptide epitope useful for the diagnosis of aspergillosis which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides process for preparation of novel synthetic peptide epitope, having the amino acid sequence Leucyl-asparaginyl-prolyl-lysyl-threonyl-asparaginyl-lysyl-tryptophanyl-glutamyl-aspartyl-lysyl-arginyl-tyrosine useful for the diagnosis of aspergillosis which comprises loading of suitably protected leucine such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z), 2-chlorobenzoylcarbonyl (Cl-Z) or 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) protected leucine attached with appropriately functionalised polystyrene resin by conventional methods in the presence of organic solvents, treating the said leucine loaded resin with deblocking agents as herein defined , thereby deblocking of the protecting moiety from the a-amino group of leucine, coupling a suitably protected asparagine using known coupling reagents, repeating the steps of coupling and deblocking with suitably protected proline, lysine, threonine, asparagine, lysine, tryptophan, glutamine. aspartic acid, lysine, arginine and tyrosine, , drying the resin coupled with desired peptide by conventional methods, cleaving of the peptide from the resin by acid treatment and neutralizing the cleaved peptide conventional methods, deblocking of the protecting groups of the side chains of the various amino acids, followed by hydrogenation and repeated precipitation to obtain the desired peptide .<br>
The polystyrene resin used may be such as Merrifield's resin, PAM resin, Wang resin etc.   The groups for protecting   a-amino and side chain functions of amino acids used may be<br>
such as t-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc), benzoyloxycarbonyl (Z), 2-chlorobenzoylcarbonyl (Cl-Z), 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (FMOC) and benzyl, methyl esters respectively. The attachment of suitably protected leucine with the resin may be carried out using ester or amide linkage with suitable reagents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)/ Dimethyl amino pyridine (DMAP), cesium salt or using a linker (for PAM resin) by DCC alone. The coupling reaction was performed in organic solvents such as methylene chloride, dicholoromethane, dimethylformamide, ether, petroleum ether, acetic acid, methanol, N-methyl-2-pyrolidone etc.<br>
The deblocking agents used for the removal of α-amino protecting group may be such as hydrochloric acid (HCl)/ dioxane, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)/ CH2Cl2, HBr/ Acetic acid (AcOH), formic acid etc. For deblocking L-tyrosine thioanisole has been used as a scavenger.<br>
The coupling during solid phase synthesis was carried out by using agents such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), mixed anhydride, active esters, Benzotriazole-1-yl-oxi-tris (dimethyl amino)- phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP reagent) and 2-(lH-Benzotriazole-l-yl)-l,l,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) etc. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin may be carried out using the acids such as HBr/ AcOH, TFA/ Trifluoro methane sulfonic acid (TFMSA), liquid ammonia, liquid HF or trifluoro acetic acid etc.<br>
The neutralisation may be carried out by tertiary bases such as N-methylmorpholine, triethyl amine or diisopropylethyl amine.<br>
The hydrogenation agents used maybe such as Pd/ C, Palladium chloride. Rhodium/ C, adams catalysts and palladium black etc. The precipitation may be carried out using anhydrous methanol and dry ether.<br>
The present invention describes a novel epitope of Asp f 1, a major allergen/ antigen, of A. fumigatus. As mentioned in the prior art, a few peptides of Asp f 1 have been reported but their relevance for diagnosis has not been shown. Thus, a novel diagnostically relevant antigenic determinant has been synthesised with potential applications in immunotherapy and immunoprophylaxis of aspergillosis.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1 Fmoc-protected L-Leucine was esterified with 1.0 g p-alkoxybenzyl alcohol functionalised polystyrene resin (Wang resin) having degree of substitution 0.72 millimoles per gram of the solid support. After the esterification the protected leucine was loaded on the resin and found to be 0.65 millimoles per gram of the resin. The above resin 1.0 g was placed in a manual synthesis vessel and treated with 20% piperidine in dichloromethane (DCM) for 1.5 minutes and dimethyl formamide (DMF) for 20 minutes respectively under stirring with nitrogen current. Then the resin was washed with dichloromethane and mixture of dichloromethane and dimethylformamide with a ratio of 1:1. The free a-amino group of leucine, thus generated was acylated with three molar excess of suitably protected asparagine (2 mM) using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole<br>
and diisopropyl carbodiimide both in three molar excess in DMF/ DCM mixture (1: 1) for a period of two hours. The completion of reaction was monitored by Kaiser's test. After complete coupling the resin was washed with a mixture of dichloromethane and dimethylformamide with a ratio of 1:1. The sequence of deblocking and coupling was carried in the same manner as described above with suitably protected proline, lysine, threonine, asparagine, lysine, tryptophan, glutamme, aspartic acid, lysine, arginine and tyrosine respectively. The resin was then removed from the vessel and dried over P2O5 under vacuum. The dried resin (1.8 g) was treated with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% thioanisol mixture (45 ml) for a period of 1.5 hrs. The contents were filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to half the volume. Addition of dry ether resulted in the precipitation of white hygroscopic powder. The crude product was precipitated with anhydrous methanol and ether to get the desired undecapeptide. The crude material was purified by reverse phase HPLC. All the reactions were carried out at 25°C. Yield: 0.38g, 42.5%,<br>

The above resin 820 mg was placed in a manual synthesis vessel and treated with 50% TFA in dichloromethane for 2 minutes and dimethyl tbrmamide (DMF) for 20 minutes respectively under stirring with nitrogen current. Then the resin was washed with dichloromethane and mixture of dichloromethane and dimethylformamide with a ratio of 1:1 and subsequently washed three times with 20% diisopropyl ethylamine (DIEA) in dichloromethane and finally three times with dichloromethane.<br>
The free a-amino group of leucine, thus generated was acylated with three molar excess of suitably protected asparagine (1.6 mM) using 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, DIEA and BOP reagent all in three molar excess in DMF/ DCM mixture (1: 1) for one hour. The completion of reaction was monitored by Kaiser's test. After complete coupling the resin was washed with a mixture of dichloromethane and dimethylformamide with a ratio of 1:1. The sequence of deblocking and coupling was carried in the same manner as described above with suitably protected proline, lysine, threonine, asparagine, lysine, tryptophan, giutamine, aspartic acid, lysine, arginine and tyrosine respectively. The resin was then removed from the vessel and dried over P2O5 under vacuum. The dried resin (1.93 g) was treated with trifluoroacetic acid and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (9: 1) and 5% thioanisol mixture (20 ml) for a period of 1.5 hrs. The contents were filtered and the filtrate was concentrated to half the volume. Addition of dry ether resulted in the precipitation of white hygroscopic powder. The crude product was precipitated with anhydrous methanol and ether to get the desired undecapeptide. The crude material was purified by reverse phase HPLC. All the reactions were carried out at 25°C. Yield: 0.18g, 28%, Fast atom bombardment mass spectrum (FABMS): [M+H+]+, 1768,<br>
Homogeneous on thin layer chromatography (TLC) and High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)<br>
Example 3 Boc-protected L-Leucine was esterified with 0.75 g functionalised polystyrene resin (Merrifield) having degree of substitution 0.9 millimoles per gram of the solid support. After the esterification the protected leucine was loaded on the resin and found to be 0.52 millimoles per gram of the resin.<br>
The above resin 870 mg was placed in a manual synthesis vessel and treated with 50% TFA in dichloromethane (DCM) for 2 minutes and dimethyl formamide (DMF) for 20 minutes respectively under stirring with nitrogen current. Then the resin was washed with dichloromethane and mixture of dichloromethane and dimethyl formamide with a ratio of 1:1 and subsequently washed with 20% DIEA in dichloromethane (three times) and finally with dichloromethane (three times).<br>
The free a-amino group of leucine, thus generated was acylated with three molar excess of suitably protected asparagine pentafluorophenyl ester (1.6 mM) in DMF/DCM mixture (1:1) for a period of two and a half hours. The completion of reaction was monitored by Kaiser's test. After complete coupling the resin was washed with a mixture of dichloromethane and dimethylformamide with a ratio of 1:1. The sequence of deblocking and coupling was carried in the same manner as described above with suitably protected proline, lysine, threonine, asparagine, lysine, tryptophan, glutamine, aspartic acid, lysine, arginine and tyrosine respectively.
