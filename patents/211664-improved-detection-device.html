COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
IMPROVED DETECTION DEVICE<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under <br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office <br>
at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, <br>
Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
		      15 MAR 2005<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present Invention relates to an optical device for the visual detection of<br>
colloidal entitles in fluid samples not otherwise detectable by the eye. The<br>
present invention particularly relates to an optical device for the visual detection<br>
of colloidal entities including microorganisms greater than 0.2 micron in water samples obtained from various sources. The present invention more particularly relates to an optical device for generating light intensity difference of at least 5000 LUX for detection of colloidal entities including microorganisms greater than 0.2 micron with unaided eye in water/ fluids.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
It is common knowledge that most fluid samples especially water samples although seemingly pure to the unaided eye are usually contaminated heavily with colloidal matter.<br>
Colloidal matter herein refers to any organic or inorganic extraneous matter present in the liquid medium of particle size of 0.2 micron or more, whose size and density difference with the surrounding medium, which is typically water, is such that these entities do not settle under gravity, even when left undisturbed for an extended period of time. These matter are not a constituent of the medium but is a resultant of an invariable contamination of the medium. This includes but is not limited to matter such as dust, pathogenic and non pathogenic bacteria, cysts, fibrous material, microorganisms, dead ceils, pollen and the like. Instruments capable of detecting and monitoring these particulate matter utilize chemical, microbiological and spectroscopic methods of analysis and have found applications in various industries like medical, pharmaceutical, biotechnological and food industries. These methods generally Involve use of staining the particles with dyes and further carrying out spectroscopic analysis of these samples to determine the purity.<br>
Microbial methods generally make use of membrane filtration techniques wherein the particles are collected on membrane filter, which can be cultured and measured or alternatively counted by microscopic observation.<br><br>
2 <br>
However both these methods require specialized skills and suitable facility requirements and in combination with the time consumed in sampling and<br>
analyzing the samples, they are found to be unfeasible especially in water<br>
filtration applications where results indicating online water purity are desirable. Optical methods are found attractive for this end use and several attempts have been made in this direction to arrive at a device that satisfies the need of a simpler and economic method of detecting the colloidal matter in the fluid samples.<br>
US 2004/0009473 A1 teaches a kit and process for detection of microbes in a liquid sample. The kit has a filtration device and the microbes are arrested on the filter when fluid containing the same is passed through the filter. The filter is<br>
coated with chemicals that lyse the microbial cells. Another coating is provided which provide for detecting such microbes by emission of signal in the form of radiant energy such as luminescent light. The apparatus is then placed in a radiant energy measuring apparatus to measure the radiant energy from the lysed cells. This is then compared with a standard that provides a measure of radiant energy as a function of concentration of microbes to determine microbe concentration in a liquid.<br>
The application thus refers to a filtration device equipped with a filter coated with chemical to lyse microbes and another coat to emit signal from lysed microbes and does not address the presence or detection of non-microbial particulate matter present in the fluid sample which is also a major source of contamination of such fluid samples.<br>
US 6,522,405 B2 teaches method and apparatus for detection of sub-micron particles in flowing stream of fluids. The apparatus comprises a coherent light source, light from which is converged by lens or otherwise on a cell with stream of fluid containing particles. The convergent light falling on the moving particles is diffracted on a photo detector placed on an optical axis of the light beam on opposite side of the light source. The photo detector produces electrical signals, which are treated by electrical circuits for counting the number of particles in the<br>
3<br><br>
stream. The cell through which the stream of fluid is flown is located near the focus of the convergent beam. Length of passage for particles near focus is less than those further away though the particles move by equal velocity. Thus the photo detector emits short signal corresponding to particles passing near focal point and long signal for particles farther from focus. Signal frequency corresponds to distance between passage of particles and focus as well as size of particles. The apparatus is such that suitable electrical signal representing characteristics of particles are produced when any change in intensity caused by diffraction image of a converged light appears in the photo detector.<br>
This system however requires extreme sophistication and expertise in handling focuses on detecting and counting the number of particles in flowing fluid using photo detectors and electric circuits and does not give any indication of visual detection of the particulate matter.<br>
US 2002/0139865 A1 teaches an odor reducing water display system comprising a reservoir, pump, and conduit in fluid communication with pump for returning water to reservoir and a germicidal light source at defined position. The light source projects UV light for eliminating microbes and mal odor.<br>
This application thus discloses a microbiocidal system utilizing UV light for this purpose and does not deal with the visual detection of the organic or inorganic particulate matter present in fluid samples.<br>
EP 098095 A2 teaches a process and apparatus for characterization or identification of microparticle physical parameters such as size, mean refractive index and shape when a beam of polarized light passing through spherical array of detectors is intercepted by stream of particles at the center of spherical array and selected observables are used for mapping the particle parameters.<br>
This system Is complex and cost-Intensive and involves complicated computerizing systems for mapping and identifying the particles. It however does<br><br>
not teach visual detection of the organic and inorganic articulate matter present in the fluid sample.<br>
None of the prior art discussed above teach a device for visual detection of colloidal matter especially of particles of size as less as 1 micron and specifically a device by which a column of light is passed through a stationary fluid sample in a container for detection of particles of above defined size by unaided eye.<br>
The prior art does not address devices capable of rapid visual detection of particulate matter normally undetected by the eye, inspite of the need existing for the same. The present inventors have thus sought to address this existing need by providing a simple to use and economical device not requiring special skills or facility requirements which aids in the visual detection of colloidal entities in the fluid samples not detectable by naked eye.<br>
Objects of the invention:<br>
Thus an object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of colloidal matter normally undetected by eye.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of colloidal matter, which produces a light intensity difference for detection of particles of above 0.2 micron size by unaided eye in a stationary fluid sample in a container.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of particulate matter, which has a simple construction and is easy to handle.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of particulate matter that is economical and does not utilize complicated methods of analysis and has no requirement of specialized skills or facility.<br>
5	 <br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of particulate matter that readily indicates the presence of colloidal matter having size of from 0.2 micron.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of colloidal matter that may be used to gauge the efficiency of water purification systems where the quality of raw feed and the finished output may be assessed.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an optical device for visual detection of colloidal matter that may be used to provide a speedy quality control check on continuous samples of water purified in water purification systems.<br>
