Field of Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a safe delivery system of agriculturally active material. And also the present invention relates to a process for preparing microencapsulated suspension of agriculturally active material particularly that of Pyrethroids wherein the encapsulating agent is a Graft Copolymers of starch and atleast one monomer of Vinyl group.<br>
Background and Prior Art of the Invention:<br>
In agrochemical industry insecticides are formulated as dust, emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, wettable powders or wettable granules, water dispersible granules, depending on the properties of the active ingredient, and the target pest species and market. In Insecticides such as Lambda Cyhalothrin, Cypermethrin, Fenvalerate, Permethrin, Alpha-cypermethrin, etc which are moderately toxic in the technical form, but have a high skin irritant property and in some cases may provoke an adverse skin reaction such as burning, tingling, numbness or prickling sensation or generally known as paraesthesia, during application of the insecticide, which is most pronounced in areas of operator"s face, hand, neck etc. For delivering such agriculturally active materials at the target, encapsulation or microencapsulation is one of the safe   modes.   Encapsulation   or  more   specifically   microencapsulation   is<br><br><br>
increasingly being used to target specific insects, as it also provides a safer handling of toxic fungicides and insecticides.<br>
A microcapsule is a 10-3 m to 10-9 m diameter particle, composed of a core material and an outer wall (Tsuji, 1993).<br>
Microencapsulation of these kinds of agrochemicals can also be advantageous in providing the active material in relatively more concentrated form than the emulsifiable concentrate, wettable powder etc., at the same time reducing the amount of other ingredients such as surfactants, solvents, dye(s) etc.<br>
Microencapsulation of a number of different agriculturally active materials and pesticides has been known for many years by using various processes or techniques for microencapsulation. The general technology for forming microcapsules is divided into two classifications known as physical methods and chemical methods. The physical methods are spray coating, spray drying, pan coating, rotary disk atomization etc. The chemical microencapsulation methods are phase separation, interfacial polymerization, simple and complex coacervation method etc.<br>
The total process of microencapsulation covers three separate steps on a time scale. The first step consists of forming a wall around the core material. The second step involves keeping the core inside the wall material so that it does<br><br><br>
not release. Also the wall material must prevent the entrance of undesirable materials that may harm the core. And finally, it is necessary to get the core material out beginning at the right time, stage and at the right rate.<br>
The US pat. No. 4285720 granted to Stauffer Chemical Company, teaches a process for preparation of microencapsulated water-immiscible material, including pesticides and other agrochemicals, by interfacial polymerization techniques by using one or more polyisocyanates and producing microcapsules having a droplet size of from 0.5 to about 4000 microns which provides a controlled or sustained release (over weeks) of the active ingredients. This type of controlled released encapsulation is useful in case of soil application whereas in case of foliar applications fast release is required.<br>
US Pat. No. 6133197, granted to ZENECA Limited, describes a process of encapsulation of a water-immiscible material i.e. pyrethroid insecticide within discreet capsules of polyurea prepared from an aromatic diisocyanate. The untreated isocynate, if any, of said isocynates may cause skin/eye irritation due to its high toxicity<br>
Release rates are governed by the capsule particle size, the thickness of the wall and the permeability of the wall. Small particles with thin walls and low cross-linking density allow the fastest possible release. (Pesticide Outlook- April 2000)<br><br><br>
The present invention provides a process of encapsulation of agriculturally active material without using any diisocyanate / isocyanate, In particular, the present invention provides a process of encapsulation of agriculturally active material such as Pyrethroids with the Graft Copolymers of starch and at least one monomer of Vinyl group. These polymers used are biodegradable polymer.<br>
Starch is a cheap and natural polymer and is a renewable degradable carbohydrate biopolymer that can be taken from various sources by environmentally sound processes.<br>
Starch is hydrophilic and partially water soluble polymer, which is being used in the present invention as a polymer wall to the core material after grafting with a monomer of Vinyl group.<br>
Starch-based biodegradable low-density polyethylene (LDPE) films are used for graft copolymerization of vinyl acetate with cerie ammonium nitrate. (Polymer International, March 2004, vol. 53, no. 3, pp. 339-343(5)).<br>

Neutralizing agent is an organic aliphatic amine such as tri-ethanol amine. Structuring agent is selected from xanthan gum, guar gum, arabic gum, HPMC, CMC and others.<br>
The process for preparing microencapsules of agriculturally active water<br>
immiscible material comprises the following steps:<br>
Firstly preparing an organic phase comprising an agriculturally active water<br>
immiscible material to be encapsulated and a solvent, in presence of at least<br>
one surfactant by continuously stirring to get a clear solution.<br>
The second step is to prepare an aqueous phase comprising water, starch, a<br>
protective colloid, a biocide, with or without an anti freezing agent and a<br>
surfactant, by heating the same at 65 - 85° C temperature for 15-45 minutes<br><br><br>
to get the aqueous phase in gelatinized form followed by cooling the system at<br>
room temperature (20 - 45° C).<br>
In third step is of adding the organic phase of first step into the aqueous phase<br>
of second step slowly with high shear to form an oil-in-water emulsion, in<br>
which the oil droplets size is less than 5 microns<br>
The forth step is of adding an initiator to generate free radicals to maintain the<br>
pH of the emulsion of third step between 2-5, and simultaneously purging an<br>
inert gas so as to keep the atmosphere, oxygen-free, at a temperature range<br>
between 15 - 30° C<br>
