COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
BEAUTY WASH PRODUCT COMPOSITIONS<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT7EP2005/002814<br><br>
BEAUTY WASH PRODUCT COMPOSITIONS<br>
The present invention relates to compositions delivering <br>
5	solid particulate optical modifiers (e.g., titanium dioxide, mica, etc.) delivering enhanced visual benefits (gloss, shine, color) to the skin using specific deposition systems capable 	of delivering the optical modifiers from rinse-off bar 	compositions to provide specific optical attributes <br>
10    (e.g., to enhance reflectance by a certain per cent value, 	  and/or to change unit lightness or color values in amounts 	  previously not possible in rinse-off systems).<br>
Generally, the enhancement is obtained by use of a specific <br>
15  	deposition system (e.g., cationic polymer/ anionic<br>
surfactant precipitates) and/or by ensuring dispersion of 	particles (e.g., little or no agglomeration) onto skin or 	deposited substrate.  In one embodiment of the invention, the deposition system comprises oil/emollient (separately <br>
20	prepared as an emulsion, wherein the separately prepared' emulsion is mixed with the composition at a separate time; or is added separately and becomes part of the particle/oil emulsion during dilution of the compound), although it is not necessary that the deposition system comprises <br>
25  oil/emollient.<br>
It is extremely difficult to deliver enhanced optical properties (radiance, whiteness, perceived blueness versus yellowness, or reds versus green) from a rinse-off <br>
30  composition.  The optical modifiers delivering these<br>
properties are not readily deposited, are readily rinsed off<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-  2   -<br>
and, because they readily agglomerate, are not in a sufficiently dispersed state to be efficiently delivered to substrate, which is another way to say that they rinse off too easily. <br>
5<br>
The applicants' co-pending U.S. Serial No. 10/241,401 to Zhang et al., filed September 11, 2002 discloses personal care formulations comprising particles of defined refractive index, thickness, geometry and size.  While this disclosure<br>
10  relates to how size, shape, etc. of the particles themselves help deposition (and thus shine), it fails to disclose specific deposition enhancement systems (e.g. based on the type of surfactant and/or polymers), and the use of such systems to deliver specifically targeted optical properties<br>
15  when values defining these targeted properties are changed by certain absolute or percentage.  It also does not disclose how particles must be adequately dispersed on the substrate (e.g., skin) to deliver defined change values needed to perceive or measure optical traits.<br>
20<br>
U.S.   Serial No.   10/443,396 to Zhang et  al.,   filed May 23, 2003 discloses structured benefit  agent  for the  enhanced delivery of optical modifier,  but again it  does  not  disclose specific delivery  systems,   nor does  it  disclose  the<br>
25     necessity of, or manner to achieve particulate dispersal, and does not disclose compositions  or materials  needed to deliver change in values   (absolute  or percentage)   associated with perceived optical benefit.<br>
30     Unexpectedly, the applicants have now found both<br>
compositions  and ways to manipulate  such compositions  to<br><br>

provide specific optical benefits from rinse-off systems. That is, using deposition enhancement systems (e.g., characterized, for example, by precipitates formed through interaction of polymers and surfactants and, at least in one <br>
5		embodiment of the invention, wherein the deposition system 	also comprises oil/emollient), modifiers associated with 	specified optical properties (e.g. gloss, whiteness, degree 	of "blueness") can be dispersed and delivered to provide 	desired optical attributes (i.e., by providing sufficient <br>
10  	change in absolute or percentage values of the components to 	result in perceived optical changes).  Changes in optical 	attributes previously unobtainable from wash-off/rinse-off 	systems are provided by selecting the specified components.<br>
15  	More particularly, in one aspect the invention comprises as follows:<br>
	Beauty wash product compositions for delivery of enhanced 	(changed) visual benefits to the skin with specific optical 20  	attributes comprising:<br>
a)	from 5.0 % to about 90 %, preferably 5 % to 75 %,<br>
more preferably 10 % to 75 % by weight surfactant<br>
selected from anionic, nonionic, amphoteric and<br>
25	cationic surfactants and mixtures thereof;<br>
b)	from 0.1 % to 35 %, preferably 0.2 % to 25 % by<br>
weight of solid particulate optical modifier which<br>
exhibits a specific set of optical properties<br>
(e.g., defining radiance or shine_ (A gloss),<br>
30	whiteness (∆L), degree of red or greenness (∆a*),<br>
degree of yellow or blueness (∆b*), change in<br><br>

	opacity) and which, in combination with a<br>
deposition enhancement system, provides at least 5<br>
% improvement (i.e., 5 % change) in at least one<br>
visual attribute being targeted (e.g., shine,<br>
5	color) , wherein values reflecting various optical<br>
properties are measured before or after conducting tests according to a defined protocol, when said composition is applied to the skin;<br>
c)	from 0.1 % to 25 % by wt. of a deposition<br>
10           	enhancement system, wherein the deposition<br>
	enhancement system enhances delivery to the skin of<br>
 a target or defined visual attribute (e.g. shine)<br>
by the optical modifier relative to a composition<br>
that has the same surfactant and optical modifier<br>
15	used at the same concentration, but does not have<br>
the deposition enhancement system; and<br>
d)	from about 0.1 % to 90 %, (preferably 0.1 % to 45<br>
% for liquids and 0.1 % to 80 % for bars) of a<br>
hydrophilic structural dispersant (e.g.,<br>
20	polyalkylene glycol).<br>
Although it is not necessary for the deposition enhancement system to comprise oil/emollient, in a preferred embodiment, it will.<br>

As noted, the changes in visual attribute may be measured by a change in value of at least one component (gloss value, color value defined by an a* or b* value) of at least 5 % in absolute or per cent terms.<br>

The present invention relates to composition and to methods of delivering enhancement in delivery of a targeted visual value (e.g., reflectance/shine; opacity/translucency; whiteness; blueness; rosiness) from rinse-off compositions.<br>
5  	Specifically, by using deposition enhancement systems (which may or may not comprise oil/emollient as part of deposition system), the targeted values can be manipulated to deliver the desired attribute or look.<br>
10 	The enhanced attribute can be delivered from a variety of forms which include facial cleansers, rinse-off bathing cleansers and bars.<br>
Specifically, in one embodiment the rinse-off compositions <br>
15  of the invention comprise:<br>
a)	5.0 % to 90 %, preferably 5 % to 75 %, more<br>
preferably 10 % to 75 % by wt. of a surfactant or<br>
mixture of surfactants;<br>
b)	0.1 % to 35 %, preferably 0.2 % to 25 % by wt. of<br>
20           a solid particulate optical modifier enhancing a<br>
specific set of properties (e.g. whiteness) and which, in combination with deposition enhancement system for the modifier (e.g. precipitate formed from interaction of polymer and surfactant)<br>
25	provides at least 5 % change in at least one<br>
targeted visual attribute, wherein said change is defined by increase or decrease in absolute or percentage value characterizing a specific trait (i.e., A gloss is associated with radiance or AL<br>
30	with whiteness), and evaluation is made after<br>
using a defined in vitro skin protocol test;<br><br>

c)	from 0.1 % to 25 % by wt. of said deposition<br>
enhancement system wherein, said system (c) is<br>
defined by its ability to enhance delivery of said<br>
targeted visual attribute, by the modifier<br>
5	relative to composition with some surfactant and<br>
modifier at same concentration, but which does not have the deposition enhancement system, and<br>
d)	from 0.1 % to 90  % by wt. of a hydrophilic<br>
structural dispersant;<br>
10<br>
In at least one embodiment of the invention, the deposition enhancement system comprises oil/emollient.<br>
In general, the surfactant system used is also not critical. 15  	It is, however, preferred that there be present at least one 	lathering anionic surfactant.<br>
	Surfactant is present at a level of 0.5 % to 90 %, preferably 	5 % to 75 %, more preferably 10 % to 75 %, even <br>
20  	more preferably 20 % to 70 %, by wt. of composition 	depending on product form.<br>
In general, as noted, the surfactant may be selected from the group consisting of soap (including pure soap systems),<br>
25  	anionic surfactant, nonionic surfactant, amphoteric/<br>
zwitterionic surfactant, cationic surfactant and mixtures thereof.<br>
"Soap" is used is in the popular sense i.e., an alkali metal 30  	or alkanol ammonium salts of aliphatic, alkane or alkene 	monocarboxylic acids.  Other surfactants which may be used<br><br>

are described in "Surface Active Agents and Detergents" (Vol. I &amp; II) by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch, a copy of which is incorporated by reference into the subject application.<br>
5  Bars may include pure soap bars, bars which are primarily (&gt;50 % of surfactant system) soap and have some synthetic, bars which are primarily synthetic and have some soap, bars which are primarily sugar based bars, bars which are primarily polyethylene glycol based bars, etc.<br>
10<br>
With regard to visual attributes targeted by the optical modifier, these attributes may include, but are not limited to, attributes such as skin shine, skin lightness, skin color, skin glow, skin radiance, skin optical uniformity,<br>
15  	skin evenness, and combinations thereof.<br>
As indicated, the particulate optical modifier should provide, in combination with deposition enhancement system, at least a 5 % change in a visual attribute being targeted, <br>
20  	wherein 5 % increase refers to at least one of various<br>
values (L, a*, b* gloss, etc.) which is associated with a particular attribute identified with the value (e.g.; L refers to "whiteness").<br>
25  	Specifically, improvement is measured by taking a value for a particular measured component (for example, gloss value, L value, a* value, b* value) and measuring (e.g. using an in-vitro pig assay) values of these components before and after application of particle deposition enhancement system.<br>

Thus, for example, if gloss score changes from 5.5 to 7.8 (or visa versa) (as measured in a gloss meter), there is a percent differential of 41.8 % in gloss.  Similarly, if "a*" value (measure of rosiness) goes from 2.3 to 0.8, this <br>
5  	is an absolute decrease of -1.5, well beyond 5 %.<br>
The optical benefit provided by the deposition of optical modifier can be targeted to either plateaux on the skin surface, or to skin crevices.<br>
10<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, in absolute value, the composition of the invention (with modifier and added deposition system relative to composition with no deposition) deposits modifier to exhibit AL values in range<br>
15  of 0 to ± 10 "L" units, wherein said L units are defined by Hunter Lab Color Meter as described in the protocol, reflectance change in range of 0 to about ±300 % as defined by a change in measured gloss from a gloss meter; and change in opacity in range from about 0 to ±50 % measured in<br>
20   opacity contrast defined as AL divided by 60; wherein, at least one value has a change of at least 5 % from the initial value prior to delivery of modifier.<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation deposition of <br>
25  	modifier creates a change in skin shine, glow or similar<br>
attributes, and the particulate optical modifier deposits to exhibit AL values in range of about 0 to about ±10 L units, reflectance change in the range from 0 to about ±300 % change in gloss, and a change in opacity in a range of 0 ±20 <br>
30  	%, wherein, ∆a* and ∆b* are within normal skin range.<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-   10  -<br>
Maintaining a normal skin range means that ∆a* and ∆b* are 
5<br>
In another embodiment, the formulation deposition of modifier creates skin lightening, whitening, and/or color or similar attributes and the composition deposits particulate optical modifier to exhibit AL value in the range of ±10 L<br>
10  	units, ∆a* value in range from about 0 to about ±10, ∆b* value in range from about 0 to about ±10, and a change in opacity in the range from about 0 to about ±50 %.  The reflectance is within normal skin reflectance range.  In this case, this means change in reflectance is 
15   as noted, there is more of a focus on ∆a* and ∆b* values, since there is a focus on general color attributes.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the formulation creates skin optical uniformity, evenness, blurring, soft focus or<br>
20   similar attributes, and the composition deposits particulate optical modifier to exhibit AL values in the range of ±5 L units, a reflectance change in the range from about 0 to about ±100 % (gloss units) and a change in the opacity in the range from about 0 to about ±50 % (defined by AL /60),<br>
25   wherein ∆a* and ∆b* are within normal skin color range, (change of 
What is important to note is that the formulation can be formulated to yield a mixture of one or more effects/visual<br>

-   11   -<br>
Obtaining specific visual attributes of this kind by manipulating L or a* or b* or gloss value has not been previously possible from a wash-off system.<br>
5	Specifically, any individual visual effect can be obtained by adjusting the optical space to specifically desired optical space within ranges of, for example,' AL, Aa*, Ab*, etc.  It should be noted, if not already clear, that ranges can be manipulated to obtain effect for one or more <br>
10  attributes or mixtures thereof.<br>
The structurant of the invention can be a water-soluble or water insoluble structurant.<br>
15  Water-soluble structurants include moderately high molecular weight polyalkylene oxides of appropriate melting point (e.g. 40°C to 100°C, preferably 50°C to 90°C) and in particular polyethylene glycols or mixtures thereof.<br>
20  Polyethylene glycols (PEG's) which are used may have a<br>
molecular weight in the range 2,000 to 25,000, preferably 3,000 to 10,000.  However, in some embodiments of this invention it is preferred to include a fairly small quantity of polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight in the range<br>
25   from 50,000 to 500,000, especially molecular weights of<br>
around 100,000. Such polyethylene glycols have been found to improve the wear rate of the bars. It is believed that this is because their long polymer chains remain entangled even when the bar composition is wetted during use.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-  12   -<br>
If such high molecular weight polyethylene glycols (or any other water soluble high molecular weight polyalkylene oxides) are used, the quantity is preferably from 1 % to 5 %, more preferably from 1 % or 1.5 % to 4 % or 4.5 % by <br>
5  	weight of the composition.  These materials will generally be used jointly with a large quantity of other water-soluble structurant such as the above mentioned polyethylene glycol of molecular weight 2,000 to 25,000, preferably 3,000 to 10,000.<br>
10<br>
Water insoluble structurants also typically have a melting point in the range 40° to 100°C, more preferably at least 50°C, notably 50°C to 90°C.  Suitable materials which are particularly envisage are fatty acids, particularly those<br>
15  	having a carbon chain of 12 to 24 carbon atoms.  Examples are lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic and behenic acids and mixtures thereof.  Sources of these fatty acids are coconut, topped coconut, palm, palm kernel, babassu and tallow fatty acids and partially or fully<br>
20  hardened fatty acids or distilled fatty acids.  Other<br>
suitable water insoluble structurants include alkenols of 8 to 20 carbon atoms, particularly cetyl alcohol.  These materials generally have a water solubility of less than 5 g/litre at 20°C.<br>
25<br>
Soaps (e.g. sodium stearate) can also be used at levels of about 1 % to 15 %.  The soaps may be added neat or made in situ by adding a base, e.g. NaOH to convert free fatty acids.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-   13   -<br>
The relative proportions of the water-soluble structurants and water insoluble structurants govern the rate at which the bar wears during use.  The presence of the water-insoluble structurant tends to delay dissolution of the bar <br>
5  	when exposed to water during use, and hence retard the rate of wear.<br>
The structurant is used in the bar in an amount of 20 % to 85 %, preferably 30 % to 7 0 % by wt. <br>
10<br>
By water-soluble is meant generally that 1 % or more of compound is soluble in water at room temperature.<br>
The optical modifier which may be used for the subject <br>
15  	invention may be chosen from non-colored and colored, organic and inorganic materials.<br>
Among the materials which may be used are included organic pigments, inorganic pigments, polymers and fillers such as<br>
20  titanium oxide, zinc oxide, colored iron oxide, chromium<br>
oxide/hydroxide/hydrate, alumina, silica, zirconia, barium sulfate, silicates, natural/alkaloid (including derivatives) polymers, polyethylene, polypropylene, nylon,' ultramarine, and alkaline earth carbonates.  The materials can be platy<br>
25   materials such as talc, sericite, mica, synthetic mica,<br>
platy substrate coated with organic and inorganic molecules, bismuth oxychloride, and barium sulfate.  Particles can be composed of several materials (such as dyes, lakes, toners). Lakes are, for example, dyes with aluminum .hydroxide to help<br>
30   bind to solid.  Color can be generated through fluorescence, absorption or iridescence.  That is, the color of modifier<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-  14<br>
materials is generated through optical means rather than, for example, chemical means.<br>
The optical modifier may also be a UV screen material with a <br>
5  	D50 
The optical modifiers may also be defined by their physical properties.  For example, the optical modifier may be <br>
10  	broadly defined as follows:<br>
i)  	an exterior surface having a refractive index of<br>
1.3 to 4.0;<br>
ii)  a geometry which is spheroidal, platy or<br>
15	cylindrical;<br>
iii) dimensions: spheroidal - 0.1 to 200 um, platy - 1<br>
to 200 um, cylindrical - 1 to 200 um in length and<br>
           0.5 to 5.0 um in diameter;<br>
iv)  a D50 of

Of course, the formulation can contain a mixture of particles, each containing characteristics of a specific visual benefit, to create a combination of visual effects.<br>
5   It is also to be understood that for visual effects/<br>
attributes to have maximum effect, the particles have to be well dispersed on the skin, and should also give minimal to no sensory negatives.<br>
10   By being "well dispersed" is meant that the particles should not agglomerate, and that they should be spread easily through the skin surface.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, less than 30 % of particles are 15   agglomerates having a size of ten times or more than the D50 	particles size.  This can be measured using optical or 	electron microscopy.<br>
The particle is used at about 0.1 % to 35 % by weight 20    preferably 0.2 % to 25 % by wt., of the composition.<br>
The deposition enhancement is key to the delivery of particles providing enhanced visual benefit (e.g. as defined in changes in AL, ∆a*, etc. and in methods to <br>
25   manipulate the values to provide the desired benefit, e.g. 	radiance, color, etc.).<br>

b)	about 0.1 % to 30 % by wt., preferably 0.5 % to 25<br>

The precipitate formed can be a floe which can be broken up upon shear or rubbing to form a uniform and dispersed film <br>

Examples of such surfactants include C10 - C24 fatty acid<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the deposition system comprises oil/emollient.  The oil/emollient which may comprise part of deposition system can be, for example, silicone, castor oil, or sunflower seed oil. <br>
5<br>
Preferably, by comprising part of the deposition system is meant that the deposited particle may be enveloped/ surrounded by the oil and/or be part of an emulsion system in which deposited particles are emulsified in the<br>
10  	oil/emollient, or becomes enveloped/surrounded during<br>
dilution with water.  That is, the oil/emollient emulsion may be separately prepared and added to the composition at separate time, or it may be added separately and become part of particle/oil emulsion during dilution.<br>
15<br>
One example of such particles suspended in oil, for example,<br>
is bismuth oxychloride suspended in castor oil (e.g., Rona®<br>
Biron Silver, a 70 % solids suspension in castor oil) .<br>
20<br>
In general, other deposition aids (e.g., for the optical modifier particles) may include granular anionic polymers<br>
(e.g. alkaloid polymer such as starch, cellulose or their derivatives).  That is, if the deposition system additionally comprises such deposition aids, results are<br>
25	further enhanced.  Incorporation of the emollient as part of the deposition system as noted above boosts the deposition system.  The enhancement would generally be, for example, at least 10 % in some value (e. g., gloss, AL, a* or Ab*) relative to if no emollient is added to the deposition <br>
30  	system at all.<br><br>

-   20   -<br>
It should be further noted that oils/emollients may be used which are not specifically associated with deposition and which are added for sensory (e.g., tactile) effect.  Among oils which may be used are included, for example, vegetable <br>
5  	oils such as orachis oil, castor oil, cocoa butter, coconut oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, palm kernel oil, rapeseed oil, sunflower seed oil, safflower seed oil, sesame seed oil and soybean oil.<br>
10  Emollients may include the vegetable oils noted above and may further comprise esters, fatty acids, alcohols, polyols and hydrocarbons.  Esters may be mono- or di-esters.  Acceptable examples of fatty di-esters include dibutyl adipate, diethyl sebacate, diisopropyl dimerate, and dioctyl succinate.<br>
15  Acceptable branched chain fatty esters include 2-ethyl-hexyl myristate, isopropyl stearate and isostearyl palmitate. Acceptable tri-basic acid esters include triisopropyl trilinoleate and trilauryl citrate. Acceptable straight chain fatty esters include lauryl palmitate, myristyl<br>
20  lactate, oleyl eurcate and stearyl oleate.  Preferred esters include coco-caprylate and co-caprate, propylene glycol myristyl ether acetate, diisopropyl adipate and cetyl octanoate.<br>
25  Suitable fatty alcohols and acids include those compounds<br>
having from 10 to 20 carbon atoms. Especially preferred are such compounds such as cetyl, myristyl, palmitic and stearyl alcohols and acids.<br>
30  Among the polyols which may serve as emollients are linear and branched chain alkyl polyhydroxyl compounds.  For<br><br>

example, propylene glycol, sorbitol and glycerin are preferred.  Also useful may be polymeric polyols such as polypropylene glycol and polyethylene glycol.<br>
5  Exemplary hydrocarbons which may serve as emollients are those having hydrocarbon chains anywhere from 12 to 30 carbon atoms. Specific examples include mineral oil, petroleum jelly, squalene and isoparaffins.<br>
10  Yet another way to enhance deposition may be through modification (e.g. surface modification) of particles.<br>
In another embodiment, the deposition enhancement system may comprise: <br>
15   1)   from 0.1 % to 10 % by wt. of an anionic polymer<br>
having charge density of at least &gt;; 1.0 Meq/gram; 2)   from about 0.1 % to 30 % .cationic surfactant which forms a precipitate with the anionic polymer upon dilution; and <br>
20   3)   optionally 0.1 % to 40 % by wt. oil/emollient.<br>
This system is the inverse of cationic polymer anionic surfactant system.  The precipitate can also be a floe which can be broken up on shear or rubbing and form a<br>
25   uniform and dispersed film on the skin surface.<br>
The cationic surfactant may typically be a quaternary amino surfactant or an amphoteric such as betaine (e.g., cocoamidopropyl betaine). <br>

WO 2005/094780<br><br>

The anionic polymer may typically be a polyacrylate, cross-linked polyacrylate, polyurethane and/or alkaloid derived polymer (e.g., starch, cellulose and derivatives), polysaccharide (e.g. xanthan gum), agar and/or mixtures <br>
5  thereof.<br>
Oils/emollients may include any of those noted above.<br>
This system may also additionally comprise 0.1 % to 30 % <br>
10  	granular anionic polymer which is natural alkaloid polymer (starch, cellulose and derivatives) as a deposition aid.<br>

Protocol<br>
20  	In Vitro Porcine/Pig Skin Assay<br>
A piece of black porcine skin is used (L = 40 ±3), which skin has dimensions of 5.0 cm by 10.0 cm, and the skin is mounted on black background paper card.  Initial <br>
25  	measurements of untreated skin are made.  The mounted skin is then washed and rinsed with 0.2 g of liquid wash-off formulation or soap bar.  After two (2) hours of drying, final measurements are made.<br>
30   Color Measurements<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-  23   -<br>
Initial and final color measurements were made of porcine or in-vivo human skin using a Hunter Lab spectra colormeter using a 0° light source and 4 5° detector geometry.  The spectra colormeter was calibrated with the appropriate black<br>
5  	and white standards.  Measurements were made before and<br>
after wash treatment.  Three measurements were made each time and averaged. Values of L, a*, and b*, which came from the L a* b* color space representation, were obtained in this manner.  L measures units of "Lightness", a* measures values<br>
10  	from red to green and b* measures values from yellow to blue.<br>
Reflectance (Gloss) Determination<br>
15  	Initial and final reflectance/radiance measurements of<br>
porcine or in-vivo human skin were made with a gloss meter which measures units of gloss.  The gloss meter was first set with both detector and light source at 85° from normal.  The gloss meter was calibrated with appropriate reflection<br>
20  	standard.  Measurements of gloss were taken before and after application of the formulation, and A gloss was calculated to obtain percent difference.<br>
Opacity Determination<br>
25<br>
The opacity of washable deposition was calculated from Hunter Lab color measurements.  Opacity contrast was calculated from AL (change in whiteness after deposition compared to prior to deposition) divided by 60 (which is the<br>
30  	difference in L value of skin and a pure white color).<br><br>

As seen from the Table above, systems of the invention create optical attributes (∆L, ∆a*, etc.) which vary in change of the value (and accordingly with the attribute <br>
5	which is highlighted) depending on exact particle, size of particle, and deposition system used.  Thus, the applicants are able to manipulate values from a wash-off system, and to provide values and the ability to manipulate previously unknown. <br>
10<br>
A more detailed discussion of observations which can be made from the many examples is set forth below.<br>
Examples 1 to 5, are Jaguar C13S based formulations, which 15  show some deposition.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 have 20 % TiO2 and 10 % TiO2, respectively, with the 20 % TiO2 formulation showing higher deposition and larger ∆L change.  There is also a large (and negative) <br>
20  	change in the b* value (becoming bluer).  The deposition 	also has a matting visual effect, as can be seen from the<br>
negative  ∆gloss (which indicates a lowering of shine).<br>
Examples 3 to 5 use Example 2 formulation with an addition <br>
25  of a reflective particle material.<br>
Example 3 has talc (D50 of 10 um) included into the<br>
formulation.  The slight reflectivity of talc counteracts the matting effect of the deposited Ti02, as can be seen by<br>
30  the zero change in ∆gloss.  This combination gives a whiter,<br><br>
-WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-   26  -<br>
lighter appearance while still maintaining the skin's normal shine. The addition of the talc did not alter the ∆L or ∆b* seen from Example 2.<br>
5  Example 5 is the same as Example 3, except that natural mica (D50 of 22 mn) is used.  The higher reflectivity of the larger sized mica counteracts the matting effect of the deposited TiO2 and increases the visual shine, as can be<br>
seen by the increase in ∆ gloss.  The addition of the natural 10  mica did not alter the ∆L or ∆b* seen from Example 2.<br>
Example 4 is the same as Example 3, except that a titan-coated mica (D50 of 6um) is used.  The greater reflectivity of the titan-coated mica counteracts the matting effect of<br>
15  the deposited Ti02 and increases the visual shine, as can be<br>
seen by the increase in ∆gloss.  The addition of the coated mica does increase the AL or Ab* as compared to Example 2.<br>
	The control is for comparison purposes.  It has the same <br>
20  	formulation as Example 2 except there is no cationic polymer (Jaguar C13S). From the L, a*, b*, and gloss values, no deposition is observed.<br>
From Examples 1 to 5, changes in visual attributes can be 25  	seen, but they are not large enough.  The particle<br>
deposition needs to be larger.  For this to occur, a cationic polymer with a larger charge density must be used (in this case Merquat 100).<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-  27   -<br>
Example 6 is the same as Example 2, except the cationic polymer used is Merquat 100.  As can be seen from the ∆L and ∆gloss, the deposition of the TiO2 is much greater (by a factor of 5). The visual effect is a much greater whiteness <br>
5  	but also a larger increase in mattness.  To counteract the mattness, natural mica or talc can be added to the formulations.<br>
Example 7 and 8 are Merquat 100 formulations with natural 10  mica or talc.  Both examples show an attenuation in the<br>
matting effect of the large Ti02 deposition as can be seen by the lower negative or even positive ∆gloss.<br>
The facial wash-off formulation can also use a different<br>
15  hydrophilic structural dispersent, such as starch. Similar 	correlations and trends can be seen with the starch 	formulation system as with the previous examples.<br>
	Example 12 and Example 11 compare the deposition of <br>
20   Ti02/talc from formulations using Jaguar C13S and Merquat 	100, respectively.  As before, the higher charge density 	Merquat shows greater deposition that Jaguar, with similar 	visual attributes.<br>
25  Example 9 is a control formulation, with no cationic<br>
polymer.  From the L, a*, b*, and gloss measurements, there is little to no deposition.<br>
i<br>
Example 10 shows the importance of compatibility of <br>
30   surfactant systems to deposition efficiency.  Example 10 	uses a mixture of CAP Betaine and LE(2)S.  In comparison with<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-   28   -<br>
Example 11, the deposition is less efficient as seen from the<br>
lower ∆L values.  This is an indication that the CAP<br>
Betaine/LE(2)S surfactant system is not as effective<br>
precipitating cationic polymer upon dilution.<br>

Example for Bars<br>
Formulations for Bars referred to as Formulations 1 to 7 are set forth below.<br>
Formulation 1<br><br>
60 % Talc in pure soap bar wherein soap is a mixture of 15 % to 20 % coconut oil and 80 % to 85 % tallow.  Basically,<br>

25  In Formulation 2, the cocoamidosulfosuccinate and Merquat are primary deposition aids.  The sunflower seed oil is believed to be sensory, but not to significantly enhance deposition (see % gloss figures of -45.1 and -44.6 in Table).  Further,<br>
TiO2 is not an oil emulsion so no further deposition<br>
30   enhancement  is  seen from oil being part  of the  deposition system.<br><br>

Same as Formulation 2, but with 10 % bismuth oxychloride (Rona Biron Silver, a 70 % solids suspension in castor oil) instead of instead of TiO2.<br>
5  Comparing Formulation 6 to 2 (Examples 23  and 24  to 15 and 16), it can be seen deposition (and % gloss) is significantly enhanced.<br>
Formulation 7 10<br>
Same as Formulation 3, but with 10 % bismuth oxychloride instead of TiO2.<br>
Similar to Formulation 6 relative to 2, when bismuth <br>
15  	emulsified in oil (as part of deposition system) is used (see 	26 and 27 versus 17 and 18), deposition (reflected in % 	gloss) is significantly enhanced.<br>
Formulation 8 20<br>
Same as Formulation 5, but with 2 % sodium lauryl ethersulfate (SLES) instead of sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS).<br>
Formulation 9 25<br>
Same as Formulation 5, but with 2 % alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) instead of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).<br>

A  brief explanation of examples is indicated below.<br>
5  From examples 15 to 26, the data shows that the new<br>
deposition system (cationic polymer/anionic surfactant) has significant amount of deposition that leads to large changes visual appearance and attributes.<br><br>

Examples 15, 16, 17and 18 (sugar and PEG bars) have a high deposition of Ti02, and have the ability to increase whiteness and opacity (hiding power) in a person's appearance. <br>
5<br>
Examples 19, 20, 21 and 22 show an increase in reflectance and whiteness using titania coated mica.  The effects are similar to examples 7 and 8, except now there is radiance.<br>
10  Examples 23, 24, 25 and 26 (sugar and PEG bars), with BiOCl, have a large increase in reflectance/radiance with little increase in whiteness.<br>
Examples 13 and 14 (85/15 bar with 60 % talc) however is a 15  	case of minimal/poor deposition.  It shows minimal 	whitening and reflectance, even though it contains 60 % 	talc. The other sugar and PEG bar examples have only 10 % 	particle composition.<br>
20  	Example 27 and 28 are sugar bars with titania coated mica<br>
	with a different surfactant (SLES) .  As compared to Examples 19, 20, 21, 22, these examples show lower/poor deposition and visual effect (reflectance).<br>
25  	Example 29 and 30 are sugar bars with titania coated mica<br>
	with another different surfactant (AOS).  The deposition and visual/reflectance results are intermediate between those using SDS and SLES.<br>

From Examples 31-33 above, several observations may be made.<br>
10  Example 31 uses sunflower oil as an emollient, although by itself it may not be an extremely efficient deposition aid. When silicone is added to be a part of the deposition system (Example 32) , it can be seen from gloss data that deposition is increasing (i.e., from % A gloss of 38 to 50).  Neither<br>
15  Examples 31 and 32 have cationic deposition polymer.<br><br>
WO 2005/094780<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/002814<br><br>
-  42   -<br>
Finally, Example 33 shows that when both the deposition system has oil/emollient as part of the deposition system, and there is cationic deposition polymer, then shine enhances significantly (% A gloss 71), even at lower oil <br>
5  	levels (only 4 % sunflower).<br><br>
