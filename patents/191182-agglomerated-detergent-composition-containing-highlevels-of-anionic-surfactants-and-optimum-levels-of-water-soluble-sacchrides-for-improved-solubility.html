				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is generally directed to an agglomerated compact detergent composition having improved solubility in cold temperature laundering solutions. More particularly, the invention is directed to a detergent composition containing high levels of a sulfated surfactant selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfates (also referenced herein as "AS"), alkyl ethoxy sulfates (also referenced herein as "AES"), and secondary alkyl sulfates (also referenced herein as "SAS") and mixtures thereof, and selected amounts of water-soluble saccharides, together which improve the overall solubility or dispersability of the composition in cold temperature washing solutions (e.g. 5°C to 30°C) and high water hardness conditions (e.g. 7 grains/gallon). For purposes of producing a high density, compact detergent composition, the detergent of the invention is in the form of detergent agglomerates rather than spray dried granules.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Typically, conventional detergent compositions contain mixtures of various surfactants in order to remove a wide variety of soils and stains from surfaces. For example, various anionic surfactants, especially the alkyl benzene sulfonates, are useful for removing particulate soils, and various nonionic surfactants, such as the alkyl ethoxylates and alkylphenol ethoxylates, are useful for removing greasy soils.<br>
While the art is replete with a wide variety of surfactants for those skilled in the art of detergent formulation, most of the available surfactants are specialty chemicals which are not suitable for routine use in low cost items such as home laundering compositions. The fact remains that many home-use laundry detergents still comprise one or more of the conventional alkyl benzene sulfonates or primary alkyl sulfate surfactants. Another class of surfactants which has found use in various compositions where emulsification is desired comprises the secondary alkyl sulfates. The conventional secondary alkyl sulfate surfactants are available as generally pasty, random mixtures of sulfated linear and/or partially branched alkanes.<br>
The limited solubility of alkyl sulfate surfactants including both primary and secondary alkyl sulfates is especially prevalent in modern granular laundry detergents which are typically used in cold temperature (e.g. 5°C to 30°C) washing solutions and are formulated in "condensed" or "compact' form for low dosage usage. For the consumer, the smaller package size attendant with compact detergent products provides for easy storage and handling. For the manufacturer, unit storage costs, shipping costs and packaging costs are lowered.<br>
The manufacture of acceptable compact or condensed granular detergents has its difficulties. In a typical compact detergent formulation, the so-called "inert" ingredients such as<br>
sodium sulfate are substantially eliminated. However, such ingredients do play a role in enhancing solubility of conventional detergents. As a consequence, compact detergents often suffer from solubility problems, especially in cold temperature laundering solutions. Moreover, conventional compact or low density detergent granules are usually prepared by spray drying processes which result in extremely porous detergent particles that are quite amenable to being dissolved in aqueous washing solutions. By contrast, compact detergents are typically comprised of less porous, high density detergent particles which are less soluble, e.g. agglomerates. Thus, since the compact form of granular detergents typically comprise particles or granules which contain high levels of detersive ingredients with little or no room for solubilizing agents, and since such particles are intentionally manufactured at high bulk densities, the net result can be a substantial problem with regard to in-use solubility.<br>
In the art of detergency, sugars have been to some extent used to replace sodium silicate for purposes of improving solubility of spray dried granular detergents. For example, one attempt in the past was directed to a spray-dried detergent composition containing sugars and a seed crystal for calcium carbonate to provide improved solubility.   However, only "spray-dried" detergent compositions having low concentrations of sulfated surfactants have been considered in the past. Thus, the problems associated with modern day compact detergents having densities which are much higher (650 g/1 or more) have not been addressed, as yet. Generally speaking, only the highly densified agglomerated detergent compositions encounter a much more difficult problem of dissolving in cold temperature laundering solutions as compared to less dense spray-dried detergents.<br>
Accordingly, despite the disclosures in the art, there remains a need for an agglomerated, high density detergent composition which has improved water solubility, especially in cold temperature washing solutions.   This need is especially prevalent in the art of compact or high density detergents currently being used by consumers.<br>

The following patent discloses secondary'alkyl sulfates: Rossall et al, U.S. Patent No. 4,235,752.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention meets the needs identified above by providing a detergent composition in the form of agglomerates which exhibits improved solubility or dissolution of the anionic surfactants in cold temperature washing solutions as well as under high water hardness conditions. The detergent composition comprises a surfactant system having a high level of a sulfated surfactant selected from the group of alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxy sulfates, secondary alkyl sulfates and mixtures thereof, in combination with a water-soluble saccharide. Other adjunct detergent ingredients may also be included in the detergent agglomerates which form the detergent composition. Additionally, the composition surprisingly exhibits improved water solubility despite being in the form of high density agglomerates and being subjected to cold temperature washing solutions.<br>
As used herein, the phrase "improved solubility" means that the solubility of the anionic surfactants of the detergent composition is enhanced by at least 5% in the laundering solution when employed in the manner of this invention, as compared to the solubility of the same anionic surfactants per se, under the same test conditions (i.e. water temperature and pH, stirring speed and time, particle size, water hardness, and the like). As used herein, the term "agglomerates" refers to particles formed by agglomerating particles which typically have a smaller mean particle size than the formed agglomerates. All percentages, ratios and proportions used herein are by weight, unless otherwise specified. All documents including patents and publications cited herein are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the invention, a detergent composition in the form of agglomerates is provided herein. The detergent composition comprises from about 1% to 50% by weight of a detersive surfactant system. The surfactant system itself comprises, by weight of the surfactant system, at least about 30% of a sulfated surfactant selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxy sulfates, secondary alkyl sulfates and mixtures thereof. The detergent composition includes from about 0.1% to about 5% of a water-soluble saccharide selected from the group consisting of cellobiose, glucose, maltose, lactose, ribose, and lactulose mixtures thereof. Also, the detergent composition includes at least about 1% by weight of a detergency builder to enhance cleaning. The surfactant system, water-soluble saccharide, and builder are agglomerated to form detergent agglomerates having a density of at least about 650 g/1. The detergent composition has improved solubility in aqueous laundering solutions. Thus, the solubility of the sulfated surfactant (AS, AES and/or SAS) is enhanced by at least 5%, preferably 10 to 50%, over those same surfactants alone under the same test conditions in aqueous washing solutions at cold temperatures, i.e. 5°C to 30°C.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the sulfated surfactant is a mixture of alkyl sulfate and alkyl ethoxy sulfate surfactants. Further, the detergent composition may include adjunct ingredients selected from the group consisting of bleaches, bleach activators, suds suppressers and soil release agents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the detergency builder is selected from the group consisting of carbonates, zeolites and mixtures thereof. The surfactant system may further comprise, by weight of the surfactant system, from about 1% to about 50% of a C10-C18N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid amide for use as an adjunct surfactant. In another embodiment, the composition may include from about 0.1% to about 15% of a linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactant.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the detergent composition comprises: (a) at least about 30% by weight of a sulfated surfactant selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxy sulfates, secondary alkyl sulfates and mixtures thereof; (b) from about 0.1% to about 5% by weight of sucrose; and (c) at least about 1% by weight of a detergency builder; wherein the surfactant system, saccharide and builder are agglomerated to form detergent agglomerates having a density of at least 650 g/1. The sulfated surfactant of the surfactant system has improved solubility in an aqueous laundering solution and the composition is substantially free of phosphates.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a method for laundering soiled fabrics is provided. The method comprises the step of contacting soiled fabrics with an effective amount of a detergent composition as described herein in an aqueous laundering solution. An effective amount is typically on the order of 1000 to 1500 ppm. Yet another embodiment of the invention is directed to a laundry bar formed from compositions described herein.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a granular detergent composition which has improved solubility, especially in cold temperature washing solutions. It is also an object of the invention to provide such a detergent composition which has improved biodegradability. These and other objects, features and attendant advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from a reading of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and the appended claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
The invention is directed to a granular detergent composition having improved solubility in cold temperature laundering solutions. A multitude of consumers around the world launder soiled clothes in conventional washing machines unique to their particular geographic location. Typically, these conventional washing machines launder the soiled clothes in water supplied at relatively cold temperatures, for example in range of 5°C to 30°C, and at high hardness concentrations, e.g. 7 grains/gallon (rich with Ca and Mg ions). Most of the modern day consumers also use compact or condensed laundry detergents to accomplish their laundering needs. Under the aforementioned conditions, solubility of current detergents in aqueous laundering solutions has been a problem, as mentioned previously. This problem is especially exacerbated when the detergent composition has high levels of alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxy sulfate and/or secondary alkyl sulfates which are not particularly amenable to dissolution in cold aqueous laundering solutions. Such surfactants are particularly useful in modern laundry detergents since they minimize or eliminate the need for linear alkylbenzene sulfate surfactants which generally have poor biodegradability. Moreover,<br>
recent compact detergents have strived to limit or eliminate the use of phosphates which are known to increase water solubility. In view of this trend, the water solubility problem is exacerbated further.<br>
It has been found that highly dense, agglomerated detergent compositions can experience improved water-solubility if selected amounts of a water-soluble saccharide are included. Such detergent compositions preferably also include a surfactant system which comprises at least 30%, preferably from about 35% to about 90%, of a sulfated surfactant selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxy sulfates, secondary alkyl sulfates and mixtures thereof. Preferably, the detergent composition is in the form of agglomerates and has an overall density of 650 g/1 or higher. These features provide the "compact" nature of the detergent composition in accordance with the invention. Preferably, the detergent composition of the invention also comprises at least about 1%, preferably from about 10% to about 40%, and most preferably from about 15% to about 35%, of a detergency builder. The detergent composition may also include one or more of adjunct detergent ingredients. Nonlimiting examples of the detergency surfactant, water-soluble saccharide, detergency builder and adjunct ingredients are described in detail hereinafter.<br>
For purposes of enhancing biodegradability, the detergent agglomerates which form the detergent composition of the invention preferably do not contain phosphates. Further, it is important for the detergent composition to be in the form of "agglomerates" as opposed to spray dried granules. In addition to being amenable for modern compact detergents, this is particularly important since most sulfated surfactants cannot be readily subjected to spray drying processes without causing or creating extremely adverse plumes from the spray drying towers.<br>
The "improved solubility" achieved by the detergent composition is concerned with enhanced solubility of the anionic surfactants contained in the surfactant system, i.e. AS, AES, SAS or LAS if used. Preferably, the improvement represents at least a 5% increase in solubility of these anionics in the wash solution over the solubility of the same surfactants if they were dissolved alone or without being contained in a detergent composition as defined herein. More preferably, the solubility improvement is from about 10% to about 50%. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, any comparison of anionic surfactant solubility should be completed under the same laundering conditions, e.g. water temperature, hardness and pH, stirring speed and time, and particle size. Typical anionic surfactant solubility improvements are set forth in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
Those skilled in the art should also appreciate the numerous ways in which the amount of the surfactant system in the washing solution can be determined. For example, in the so-called "catSO3" titration technique, samples of the aqueous laundering solution containing the detergent composition can be taken after one minute and filtered with 0.45 mm nylon filter HPLC, after which the filtered solution can be titrated with a cationic titrant, which can be commercially purchased, e.g. from Sigma Chemical Company under the trade name Hyamine, in the presence of anionic<br>
dyes. From the foregoing, the amount of anionic surfactant which was dissolved in the washing solution can be determined.<br>
Water-Soluble Saccharide<br>
It has been found that the solubility of high-content alkyl sulfate, alkyl ethoxy sulfate and/or secondary alkyl sulfate ("sulfated" surfactant system) compact detergent composition in the form of agglomerates can be increased by incorporating a water-soluble saccharide selected from the group consisting of glucose, maltose, cellobiose, lactose, ribose, and lactulose mixtures thereof into the composition. Other mono-, di-, and poly- saccharides and derivatives thereof may be used in the compositions herein without departing from the scope of the invention. The saccharide repeating unit can have as few as five carbon atoms or as many as Fifty carbon atoms consistent with water solubility. To that end, the preferred detergent composition of the invention comprises from about 0.1% to about 5%, more preferably from about 0.5% to about 4%, and most preferably from about 2% to about 4% by weight of the water-soluble saccharide. The most preferred water-soluble saccharide is sucrose for its availability, inexpensiveness and performance. By "water-soluble" in the present context, it is meant that the saccharide is capable of forming a clear solution or a stable colloidal dispersion in distilled water at room temperature at a concentration of 0.01 g/1.<br>
Surfactant System<br>
The surfactant system in the detergent composition must include a sulfated surfactant selected from the group consisting of alkyl sulfates, alkyl ethoxy sulfates, secondary alkyl sulfates, and mixtures thereof. As mentioned previously, the anionic surfactants in the surfactant system of the invention, i.e. AS, AES, and/or SAS, have improved solubility and more particularly, on the order of 5% or higher. Optionally, the surfactant system may contain one or more of additional surfactants, nonlimiting examples of which are provided hereinafter.<br>
The surfactant system preferably includes conventional primary alkyl sulfate surfactants have the general formula<br>
ROSOs-NT1" wherein R is typically a linear C10-C2O hydrocarbyl group and M is a water-solubilizing cation. Branched-chain primary alkyl sulfate surfactants (i.e., branched-chain "PAS") having 10-20 carbon atoms can also be used herein; see, for example, European Patent Application 439,316, Smith et al, filed 21.01.91, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference (Included in the term "alkyl" is the alkyl portion of acyl groups). Included in the surfactant system are the C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy sulfates ("AEXS"; especially EO 1-7 ethoxy sulfates).<br>
Conventional secondary alkyl sulfate surfactants can also be used herein and include those materials which have the sulfate moiety distributed randomly along the hydrocarbyl "backbone" of the molecule. Such materials may be depicted by the structure<br>
(Structure Removed)<br>
wherein m and n are integers of 2 or greater and the sum of m + n is typically about 9 to 17, and M is a water-solubilizing cation.<br>
More preferably, a selected secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfate surfactant is used herein which comprises structures of formulas A and B<br>
(A)	CH3(CH2)x(CHOS03-M+) CH3 and<br>
(B)	CH3(CH2)y(CHOS03-M+)CH2CH3<br>
for the 2-sulfate and 3-sulfate, respectively. Mixtures of the 2- and 3-sulfate can be used herein. In formulas A and B, x and (y+1) are, respectively, integers of at least about 6, and can range from about 7 to about 20, preferably about 10 to about 16. M is a cation, such as an alkali metal, ammonium, alkanolammonium, alkaline earth metal, or the like. Sodium is typical for use as M to prepare the water-soluble (2,3) alkyl sulfates, but ethanolammonium, diethanolammonium, triethanolammonium, potassium, ammonium, and the like, can also be used. It is preferred that the secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates be substantially free (i.e., contain less than about 20%, more preferably less than about 10%, most preferably less than about 5%) of such random secondary alkyl sulfates.<br>
The preparation of the secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates of the type useful herein can be carried out by the addition of H2SO4 to olefins. A typical synthesis using a-olefins and sulfuric acid is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,234,258, Morris, or in U.S. Patent 5,075,041, Lutz, granted December 24, 1991, both of which are incorporated herein by reference. The synthesis, conducted in solvents which afford the secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates on cooling, yields products which, when purified to remove the unreacted materials, randomly sulfated materials, unsulfated by-products such as C10 and higher alcohols, secondary olefin sulfonates, and the like, are typically 90+% pure mixtures of 2- and 3-sulfated materials (up to 10% sodium sulfate is typically present) and are white, non-tacky, apparently crystalline, solids. Some 2,3-disulfates may also be present, but generally comprise no more than 5% of the mixture of secondary (2,3) alkyl mono-sulfates. Such materials are available as under the name "DAN", e.g., "DAN 200" from Shell Oil Company.<br>
If increased solubility of the "crystalline" secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfate surfactants is desired, the formulator may wish to employ mixtures of such surfactants having a mixture of alkyl chain lengths. Thus, a mixture of C12-C18 alkyl chains will provide an increase in solubility over a secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfate wherein the alkyl chain is, say, entirely C16. The solubility of the secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates can also be enhanced by the addition thereto of other surfactants such as the material which decreases the crystallinity of the secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfates. Such crystallinity-interrupting materials are typically effective at levels of 20%, or less, of the secondary (2,3) alkyl sulfate.<br>
Builder<br>
The detergent composition of the invention also includes a detergency builder material to assist in controlling mineral hardness. Inorganic as well as organic builders can be used. Builders<br>
are typically used in fabric laundering compositions to assist in the removal of particulate soils. Inorganic detergent builders include, but are not limited to, the alkali metal, ammonium and alkanolammonium salts of phytic acid, silicates, carbonates (including bicarbonates and sesquicarbonates), sulphates, and aluminosilicates.<br>
Examples of silicate builders are the alkali metal silicates, particularly those having a SiO2:Na20 ratio in the range 1.6:1 to 3.2:1 and layered silicates, such as the layered sodium silicates described in U.S. Patent 4,664,839, issued May 12, 1987 to H. P. Rieck. NaSKS-6 is the trademark for a crystalline layered silicate marketed by Hoechst (commonly abbreviated herein as "SKS-6"). Unlike zeolite builders, the Na SKS-6 silicate builder does not contain aluminum. NaSKS-6 has the delta-Na2SiO5 morphology form of layered silicate. It can be prepared by methods such as those described in German DE-A-3,417,649 and DE-A-3,742,043. SKS-6 is a highly preferred layered silicate for use herein, but other such layered silicates, such as those having the general formula NaMSixO2x+1yH2O wherein M is sodium or hydrogen, x is a number from 1.9 to 4, preferably 2, and y is a number from 0 to 20, preferably 0 can be used herein. Various other layered silicates from Hoechst include NaSKS-5, NaSKS-7 and NaSKS-11, as the alpha, beta and gamma forms. As noted above, the delta-Na2SiO5 (NaSKS-6 form) is most preferred for use herein. Other silicates may also be useful such as for example magnesium silicate, which can serve as a crisping agent in granular formulations, as a stabilizing agent for oxygen bleaches, and as a component of suds control systems.<br>
Examples of carbonate builders are the alkaline earth and alkali metal carbonates as disclosed in German Patent Application No. 2,321,001 published on November 15, 1973. Aluminosilicate builders are useful in the present invention. Aluminosilicate builders are of great importance in most currently marketed heavy duty granular detergent compositions, and can also be a significant builder ingredient in liquid detergent formulations. Aluminosilicate builders include those having the empirical formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein z and y are integers of at least 6, the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264.<br>
Useful aluminosilicate ion exchange materials are commercially available. These aluminosilicates can be crystalline or amorphous in structure and can be naturally-occurring aluminosilicates or synthetically derived. A method for producing aluminosilicate ion exchange materials is disclosed in U.S. Patent 3,985,669, BCrummel, et al, issued October 12, 1976. Preferred synthetic crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange materials useful herein are available under the designations Zeolite A, Zeolite P (B), Zeolite MAP and Zeolite X. In an especially preferred embodiment, the crystalline aluminosilicate ion exchange material has the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein x is from about 20 to about 30, especially about 27. This material is known as Zeolite A. Dehydrated zeolites (x = 0 - 10) may also be used herein. Preferably, the aluminosilicate has a particle size of about 0.1-10 microns in diameter.<br>
Organic detergent builders suitable for the purposes of the present invention include, but are not restricted to, a wide variety of polycarboxylate compounds. As used herein, "poly-carboxylate" refers to compounds having a plurality of carboxylate groups, preferably at least 3 carboxylates. Polycarboxylate builder can generally be added to the composition in acid form, but can also be added in the form of a neutralized salt. When utilized in salt form, alkali metals, such as sodium, potassium, and lithium, or alkanolammonium salts are preferred.<br>
Included among the polycarboxylate builders are a variety of categories of useful materials. One important category of polycarboxylate builders encompasses the ether polycarboxylates, including oxydisuccinate, as disclosed in Berg, U.S. Patent 3,128,287, issued April 7, 1964, and Lamberti et al, U.S. Patent 3,635,830, issued January 18, 1972. See also "TMS/TDS" builders of U.S. Patent 4,663,071, issued to Bush et al, on May 5, 1987. Suitable ether polycarboxylates also include cyclic compounds, particularly alicyclic compounds, such as those described in U.S. Patents 3,923,679; 3,835,163; 4,158,635; 4,120,874 and 4,102,903.<br>
Other useful detergency builders include the ether hydroxypolycarboxylates, copolymers of maleic anhydride with ethylene or vinyl methyl ether, 1, 3, 5-trihydroxy benzene-2, 4, 6-trisulphonic acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, the various alkali metal, ammonium and substituted ammonium salts of polyacetic acids such as ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid and nitrilotriacetic acid, as well as polycarboxylates such as mellitic acid, succinic acid, oxydisuccinic acid, polymaleic acid, benzene 1,3,5-tricarboxylic acid, carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, and soluble salts thereof.<br>
Citrate builders, e.g., citric acid and soluble salts thereof (particularly sodium salt), are polycarboxylate builders of particular importance for heavy duty liquid detergent formulations due to their availability from renewable resources and their biodegradability. Citrates can also be used, however, in granular compositions, especially in combination with zeolite and/or layered silicate builders. Oxydisuccinates are also especially useful in such compositions and combinations.<br>
Also suitable in the detergent compositions of the present invention are the 3,3-dicarboxy-4-oxa-l,6-hexanedioates and the related compounds disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,566,984, Bush, issued January 28, 1986. Useful succinic acid builders include the C5-C20 alkyl and alkenyl succinic acids and salts thereof. A particularly preferred compound of this type is dodecenylsuccinic acid. Specific examples of succinate builders include: laurylsuccinate, myristylsuccinate, palmitylsuccinate, 2-dodecenylsuccinate (preferred), 2-pentadecenylsuccinate, and the like. Laurylsuccinates are the preferred builders of this group, and are described in European Patent Application 86200690.5/0,200,263, published November 5, 1986. Other suitable polycarboxylates<br>
are disclosed in U.S. Patent 4,144,226, Crutclifield et al, issued March 13, 1979 and in U.S. Patent 3,308,067, Diehl, issued March 7, 1967. See also Diehl U.S. Patent 3,723,322.<br>
Fatty acids, e.g., C12-C18 monocarboxylic acids, can also be incorporated into the compositions alone, or in combination with the aforesaid builders, especially citrate and/or the succinate builders, to provide additional builder activity. Such use of fatty acids will generally result in a diminution of sudsing, which should be taken into account by the formulator.<br>
Adjunct Surfactants<br>
One or more adjunct surfactants may be included generally at a level of from about 1% to about 50% by weight of the surfactant system described herein. Nonlimiting examples of surfactants useful in conjunction with the surfactants described herein are the C10-C18 alkyl alkoxy carboxylates (especially the EO 1-5 ethoxycarboxylates), the C10-C18  glycerol ethers, the C10-C18 alkyl polyglycosides and their corresponding sulfated polyglycosides, and C12-C18 alpha-sulfonated fatty acid esters. If desired, the conventional nonionic and amphoteric surfactants such as the C12-C18 alkyl ethoxylates ("AE") including the so-called narrow peaked alkyl ethoxylates and C6-C12 alkyl phenol alkoxylates (especially ethoxylates and mixed ethoxy/propoxy), C12-C18 betaines and sulfobetaines ("sultaines"), can also be included in the overall compositions. The C10-C18 N-alkyl polyhydroxy fatty acid amides can also be used. Typical examples include the C12-C18 N-methylglucamides. See WO 9,206,154. The N-propyl through N-hexyl C12-C18 glucamides can be used for low sudsing. C10-C20conventional soaps may also be used. If high sudsing is desired, the branched-chain C10-C16 soaps may be used.<br>
Also included in the surfactant system is the conventional C11-C18 alkyl benzene sulfonates (also referenced herein as "LAS). While the biodegradability of the so-called "LAS" surfactants have been the subject of some concern, the surfactant system herein may include an optimum level, from about 0.1% to about 15% and more preferably from about 3% to about 8% by weight, for improving the overall solubility of the detergent composition without substantially decreasing the overall biodegradability of the present detergent composition. Alternatively, the level of LAS may be included as from about 1% to about 40%, more preferably from about 10% to about 25%, by weight of the surfactant system in the detergent composition.<br>
The surfactant system may also include an amine oxide surfactant. Nonlimiting examples include C10-18 amine oxides, secondary amine oxides such as dimethyl amine oxide, and tertiary amine oxides having the general formula RRR'NO in which R is a primary alkyl group containing 8 to 24 carbon atoms; R1 is methyl, ethyl, or 2-hydroxyethyl; and R" is independently selected from methyl, ethyl, 2-hydroxyethly and primary alkyl groups containing 8 to 24 carbon atoms. Additionally, the tertiary amine oxide surfactant may be in hydrated form and have the general formula RR'R"NO nH2O wherein R, R' and R" are the same as above and n is 1 or 2. Examples of other tertiary amines suitable for use herein include those containing one or two short-chain groups independently selected from methyl, ethyl, and 2-hydroxyethyl groups, with the remaining valences<br>
of the amino nitrogen being satisfied with long-chain groups independently selected from primary alkyl groups containing 8-24 carbons, e.g., octyl, decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, eicosyl, docosyl, and tetracosyl groups. The primary alkyl groups may be branched-chain groups, but the preferred amines are those in which at least most of the primary alkyl groups have a straight chain.<br>
Exemplary of these tert-amines are N-octyldimethylamine, N,N-didecylmethylamine, N-decyl-N-dodecylethylamine, N-dodecyldimethylamine, N-tetradecyldimethylamine, N-tetradecyl-N-ethylmethylamine, N-tetradecyl-N-ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamine, N,N-di-tetradecyl-2-hydroxyethylamine, N-hexadecyldimethylamine, N-hexadecyldi-2- hdroxyethylamine N-octadecyldimethylamine, N,N-dieicosylethylamine, N-docosyl-N-2-hydroxyethylmethylamine, N-tetracosyldimethylamine, etc.<br>

Agglomeration Process<br>
The following describes and exemplifies the agglomeration process by which the detergent composition of the invention is produced. The parameters noted herein are exemplary only and should not be considered as limiting in any way.<br>
Step A - Preparation of Surfactant Paste - The objective is to combine the surfactants and liquid in the compositions into a common mix in order to aid in surfactant solubilization and agglomeration. In this Step, the surfactants and other liquid components are mixed together in a Sigma Mixer at 140°F (60°C) at about 40 rpm to about 75 rpm for a period of from 15 minutes to about 30 minutes to provide a paste having the general consistency of 20,000-40,000 centipoise. Once thoroughly mixed, the paste is stored at 140°F (60°C) until agglomeration Step (B) is ready to be conducted.<br>
Step B - Agglomeration of Powders with Surfactant Paste - The purpose of this Step is to transform the base formula ingredients including the water-soluble saccharides described herein into flowable detergent agglomerates having a mean particle size range of from about 800 microns to about 1600 microns. In this Step, the powders (including materials such as zeolite, citrate, citric acid builder, layered silicate builder (as SKS-6), sodium carbonate, ethylenediaminedisuccinate, magnesium sulfate and optical brightener) are charged into the Eirich Mixer (R-Series) and mixed briefly (ca. 5 seconds - 10 seconds) at about 1500 rpm to about 3000 rpm in order to mix the various dry powders fully. The surfactant paste from Step A is then charged into the mixer and the mixing is continued at about 1500 rpm to about 3000 rpm for a period from about 1 minute to about 10 minutes, preferably 1-3 minutes, at ambient temperature. The mixing is stopped when course agglomerates (average particle size 800-1600 microns) are formed.<br>
Step C - The purpose of this Step is to reduce the agglomerates' stickiness by removing/drying moisture and to aid in particle size reduction to the target particle size (in the mean particle size range from about 800 to about 1600 microns, as measured by sieve analysis). In this Step, the wet agglomerates are charged into a fluidized bed at an air stream temperature of from about 41°C to about 60°C and dried to a final moisture content of the particles from about 4% to about 10%.<br>
Step D - Coat Agglomerates and Add Free-Flow Aids - The objective in this Step is to achieve the final target agglomerate size range of from about 800 microns to about 1600 microns, and to admix materials which coat the agglomerates, reduce the caking/lumping tendency of the particles and help maintain acceptable flowability. In this Step, the dried agglomerates from Step C are charged into the Eirich Mixer (R-Series) and mixed at a rate of about 1500 rpm to about 3000 rpm while adding 2-6% Zeolite A (median particle size 2-5 µm) during the mixing. The mixing is continued until the desired median particle size is achieved (typically from about 5 seconds to about 45 seconds). At this point, from about 0.1% to about 1.5% by weight of precipitated silica (average particle size 1-3 microns) is added as a flow aid and the mixing is stopped.<br>
In order to make the present invention more readily understood, reference is made to the following examples, which are intended to be illustrative only and not intended to be limiting in scope.<br>
EXAMPLE I<br>
Several detergent compositions (A and B) are made in accordance with the agglomeration process described above. Composition B is within the scope of the invention and composition A is outside of the invention and is presented for purposes of comparison as described in Example II hereinafter. The relative proportions of compositions A and B, in agglomerate form, are listed in Table I below.   (Table Removed)<br>
EXAMPLE n<br>
This Example illustrates the surprisingly improved solubility achieved by the detergent composition of the invention. Specifically, standard dosages of compositions A and B (1170 ppm) are dissolved in an aqueous laundering solution having a water temperature of 10°C and a water hardness of 7 grains/gallon (Ca:Mg ratio of 3:1). The laundering solution is continuously agitated at a rate of 75 rpm and samples of the wash solution were taken at various time intervals as shown in Table I below. For purposes of illustrating the improved solubility of the detergent composition according to the invention, the amount of surfactant in the laundering solution is determined by conducting the well known "catSC&gt;3" titration technique on the samples taken from individual wash solutions containing one of the compositions A or B. In particular, the amount of anionic surfactant in the laundering solution is determined by filtering the samples through 0.45 nylon filter paper to remove the insolubles and thereafter, titrating the filtered solution to which anionic dyes (dimidium bromide) have been added with a cationic titrant such as Hyamine™ commercially available from Sigma Chemical Company. Accordingly, the relative amount of anionic surfactant dissolved in the wash solution can be determined. This technique is well known and others may be used if desired. The results are shown in Table II below  TABLE II   (Table Removed)<br><br>
From the results in Table II, it is quite clear that composition B which is within the scope of the invention surprisingly has improved solubility over composition A which is outside the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE III<br>
A laundry bar C suitable for hand-washing soiled fabrics is prepared by a standard extrusion process and comprises the following ingredients listed in Table III:<br>
TABLE III<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
