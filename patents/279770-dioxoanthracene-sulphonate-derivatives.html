				<td>Dioxoanthracene sulphonate derivatives<br>
The present invention relates to certain dioxoanthracene sulphonate<br>
derivatives, to a process for the preparation thereof, and to the use of the<br>
compound as a medicament, particularly in the therapy of conditions that are<br>
influenced by pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, particularly<br>
inflammatory and auto-immune diseases, for instance arthritic diseases.<br>
Rhein, 4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid, and its<br>
diacetylated derivative diacerein, are known for a number of pharmaceutical<br>
applications. Particularly rhein and diacerein are known for use in the treatment<br>
of arthritic diseases, in particular osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, for<br>
instance as described in US 4,244,968, GB 1 578 452, EP 544 880 B1, EP 636<br>
602 B1 and US 6,610,750, and psoriasis and associated conditions, as<br>
described in EP 1 248 608 B1. Rhein and diacerein have also been described<br>
for the treatment of various conditions, for instance inflammatory diseases,<br>
auto-immune diseases, vascular diseases, pain relief, diabetic nephrosis.<br>
The cytokines IL-1 (a, ß) and TNF-a are considered to play an essential role in<br>
the mediation of the inflammatory process and cartilage degradation. IL-1 and<br>
TNF-a are also considered to be implicated in the mediation of biological<br>
responses to endotoxins and other infectious stimuli. An extensive review of<br>
pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines is given by CADinarello, MD<br>
et L.L.Moldawer.PhD in the primer for clinicians "Proinflammatory and Anti-<br>
inflammatory Cytokines in Rheumatoid Arthritis", 2000, Amgen Inc. The<br>
cytokines IL-1 and TNF-a have been implicated in the mechanism of a number<br>
of inflammatory and auto-immune conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid<br>
arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, Paget's disease, osteoporosis,<br>
inflammatory bowl diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,<br>
endometriosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, neurological dysfunctions such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, myeloma, myeloid leukaemia,<br>
bone metastasis, diabetic nephrosis, chronic heart disease, arthrosclerosis,<br>
asthma.<br>
Diacerein and its active metabolite rhein are known to inhibit the synthesis and<br>
activity of pro-inflammatory catabolic cytokines of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family,<br>
particularly IL-1ß. Rhein and diacerein have been shown to inhibit expression<br>
of IL-6, IL-8 and other cytokines such as tissue necrosis factor (TNF-a).<br>
Inhibition of inflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-a by rhein and diacerein is<br>
described, for instance, in WO 02/058681, WO 01/051044, J. Martel-Pelletier<br>
et al. Journal of Rheumatology, 1998, 25(4), 753-762, E. Douni et al. Arthritis<br>
Res Ther, 2004, 6: R65-R72.<br>
Chondrocytes from patients suffering from these conditions express high levels<br>
of TNF-a and IL-1, compared to chondrocytes from healthy individuals, and this<br>
specific mechanism of action of rhein as an IL-1 inhibitor is believed to explain,<br>
at least in part, the effectiveness of rhein and diacerein in the treatment of<br>
certain arthritic conditions, for instance, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and<br>
psoriatic arthritis.<br>
The metabolite Aloe-emodin present in diacerein has, however, been shown to<br>
have clastogenic effect in colon and kidney cells. Genotoxicity of Aloe-emodin,<br>
tested by Comet assay, is reported, for instance, by S.O. Muller et al., Mutation<br>
Research, 371, (1996), 165-173.<br>
Further, rhein and diacerein have the drawback of being poorly soluble in<br>
aqueous solution, making the preparation of pharmaceutical dosage forms,<br>
from which the therapeutic agent is bioavailable, difficult. The poor solubility of<br>
rhein and diacerein is a particular problem with respect to formulations for<br>
parenteral administration.<br>
Diacerein, and its active metabolite rhein, are known to have a tendency to<br>
produce laxative effects in patients over long-term treatment. It is believed that<br>
this laxative effect may be attributed, at least in part, to the very poor solubility<br>
of rhein and diacerein.<br>
There is an ongoing need to provide further compounds for the treatment or<br>
therapy of conditions that are influenced or mediated by pro-inflammatory<br>
cytokines of the IL-1 family, particularly inflammatory and auto-immune<br>
diseases, including arthritic diseases.<br>
It would further be advantageous to provide alternative compounds having<br>
activity for the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family, and<br>
which allow to address certain drawbacks of rhein and/or diacerein.<br>
It would be further advantageous to provide compound having improved activity<br>
for the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family.<br>
There are now provided novel pharmaceutical compounds of the formula (I):<br>
wherein R1, R2, R3 are each independently H or a C1-4 alkyl group or a C2-4 acyl<br>
group;<br>
R4 and R5 are each independently H or a group of formula -SO3R6, wherein R6<br>
is H or a C1-4 alkyl group or a C2-4 acyl group;<br>
with the proviso that at least one of R4 and R5 is a group of formula -SO3R6.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the present invention there is provided<br>
a compound of the formula (I) wherein R1, R2, R3 and R4 are H, and R5 is<br>
-SO3H (formula (III)).<br>
It has unexpectedly been found by the inventors that compounds of the formula<br>
(I) are capable of inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1<br>
family. Compounds of formula (I) wherein R4 and/or R5 is -SO3H have also been<br>
shown to exhibit advantageous solubility properties.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for<br>
the preparation of a compound of formula (I), which comprises treating the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (II):<br>
<br>
Wherein R1, R2 and R3 are each independently H, with sulphuric acid.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention there is now provided a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula (I) in<br>
combination with suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
According to further aspects, the present invention relates to a compound of<br>
formula (I) for use as a medicament for human or veterinary application, to a<br>
compound of formula (I) for the treatment of conditions that are mediated or<br>
influenced by cytokines of the IL-1 family, particularly for the treatment of<br>
inflammatory or auto-immune diseases, to the use of a compound of formula (I)<br>
for the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of conditions that are<br>
mediated or influenced by cytokines of the IL-1 family, particularly inflammatory<br>
or auto-immune diseases, and to a method for the treatment of a condition<br>
mediated or influenced by cytokines of the IL-1 family, which comprises<br>
administering to a subject a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of<br>
formula (I).<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from<br>
the claims and the following detailed description, examples and accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
Figures 1(a), 1(b) and 1(c) show the 1H-NMR spectra of a compound according<br>
to the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the MS analysis of the same compound according to the<br>
present invention;<br>
Figure 3 is a graphical representation showing the effects of a compound<br>
according to the present invention on the inhibition of IL-1ß cytokine production<br>
in human chondrocytes; and<br>
Figure 4 is a graphical representation showing the dose-dependent inhibition of<br>
IL-1ß cytokine production in human chondrocytes by a compound according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
The present invention provides a compound of the formula (I):<br>
Wherein R1, R2, R3 are each independently H or a C1-4 alkyl group or a C2-4 acyl<br>
group;<br>
R4 and R5 are each independently H or a group of formula -SO3R6, wherein R6<br>
is H or a C1-4 alkyl group or a C2-4 acyl group;<br>
with the proviso that at least one of R4 and R5 is a group of formula -SO3Re.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention R1 and R2 are independently<br>
selected from H, a C1-4 alkyl group or a C1-4 acyl group; R3 is H, and R4 and R5<br>
may be H or -SO3H, with the proviso that at least one of R4 and R5 is -SO3H. In<br>
a preferred embodiment, R1 and R2 are either both H or both acetyl groups, R3<br>
and R4 are both H, and R5 is -SO3H.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention R1, R2, R3 are H, and R4 and R5<br>
are independently H or -SO3H, with the proviso that at least one of R4 and R5 is<br>
-SO3H.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention there is provided<br>
a compound of the formula (III) (6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene<br>
carboxylic acid):<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. Particularly sodium, potassium or<br>
ammonium salts are contemplated.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) may be prepared by a process according to the<br>
present invention, which comprises treating a compound of formula (II)<br>
<br>
in which R1, R2 and R3 are H, with concentrated sulphuric acid to produce the<br>
corresponding compound of formula (I), in the form of the sulphonic acid. In a<br>
further step desired C1-4 alkyl group or a C2-4 acyl group can be selectively<br>
substituted using conventional techniques. For instance, reaction with a C2-4<br>
acyl halide, or corresponding acyl anhydride, to introduce the desired C2-4<br>
acyloxy group, reaction with a C1-4 alcohol to form the corresponding ester, or<br>
for instance reaction with diazomethane (CH2N2) to introduce C1 alkyl group or<br>
with a C2-4 alkyl halide to introduce the corresponding C2-4 alkyl group.<br>
Depending on the desired substitution, known protecting groups may be<br>
introduced, where necessary, and cleaved using conventional processes.<br>
Alternatively, sulphuric acid can be replaced with pyrosulphuric acid.<br>
The reaction with sulphuric acid is preferably carried out at a temperature<br>
between 60 and 120° C, preferably around 100°C.<br>
The reaction time with the acid may vary, dependent for instance on the<br>
reaction temperature, the acid used, the desired product (i.e. di- or mono-<br>
sulphonic acid substitution) etc. As a general indication reaction times of<br>
between 1 hour and 48 hours may be envisaged, for instance around 24 hours.<br>
The progress of the reaction may advantageously be monitored, for example by<br>
HPLC, and the reaction stopped at completion of the reaction to the desired di-<br>
or mono- sulphonate substituted product.<br>
The product may be isolated in the form of its corresponding salt, for instance<br>
by addition of the corresponding metal halide (e.g. NaCI), or the corresponding<br>
metal alkalizing agent (such as NaOH, KOH or NH3). Salts envisaged include<br>
any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, such as, for instance, sodium, potassium<br>
or ammonium.<br>
The thus obtained compound of formula (I) may be purified using any suitable<br>
conventional purification process, such as, for instance, preparative HPLC or<br>
liquid-liquid partitioning.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention exhibit activity in<br>
the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family.<br>
In in-vitro studies in human chondrocytes, compounds of formula (I) have<br>
unexpectedly been shown to exhibit improved inhibition of interleukin-1 (IL-1 (3),<br>
compared to rhein.<br>
Advantageously, compounds of formula (I) can allow to avoid the metabolite<br>
aloe-emodin, present in diacerein.<br>
In view of their activity in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1<br>
family, compounds of the present invention are contemplated for the treatment<br>
of conditions characterised by an abnormally high or increased level of IL-1.<br>
The conditions that may be treated with compounds of the present invention<br>
include inflammatory and auto-immune diseases. Conditions that may be<br>
mentioned include rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, psoriatic<br>
arthritis, psoriaris, artherosclerosis, Paget's disease, chronic heart disease,<br>
inflammatory bowl diseases including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease,<br>
endometriosis, Wegener's granulomatosis, neurological dysfunctions such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, myeloma, myeloid leukaemia,<br>
bone metastasis, diabetic nephrosis, pneumonary emphysema, asthma.<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention relates to a method of treating<br>
conditions characterised by increased levels of IL-1, as compared to healthy<br>
individuals, which comprises administering to a subject an effective amount of a<br>
compound according to the present invention or a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salt thereof. The conditions are preferably inflammatory diseases or auto-<br>
immune diseases. Particularly the conditions to be treated include inflammatory<br>
diseases of the joints in particular osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis may also be particularly mentioned.<br>
It is likely that the compounds of the present invention will be of clinical utility in<br>
the wide range of inflammatory and auto-immune diseases described above,<br>
due also to their improved physical properties compared with rhein.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprising the compound of formula (I) in combination with<br>
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable excipients. Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
according to the present invention may be for human or veterinary use.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions according to the present invention may have<br>
a formulation suitable for administration by any route, including, for example,<br>
oral, intramuscular, intravenous, subcutaneous, rectal, topical, transcutaneous,<br>
intranasal, intrarticular, sublingual and intraperitoneal administration.<br>
Formulations for oral administration may include, for instance, tablets, hard or<br>
soft gelatin capsules, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible<br>
powders or granules for reconstitution, syrups or emulsions.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration may be in any suitable<br>
pharmaceutical form, such as in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous<br>
buffered solution or suspension, as a sterile injectable solution or suspension<br>
in any other non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, or in a freeze-<br>
dried form for reconstitution at the time of use.<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be also be provided in<br>
formulations for topical administration, for instance in the form of a cream, gel,<br>
ointment or emulsion in an aqueous or oily carrier.<br>
Compounds of formula (I) according to the present invention are expected to<br>
show better solubility in water than rhein or diacerein due to the presence of<br>
the sulphonate group. For instance, compounds of formula (I) according to the<br>
present invention wherein R1, R2, R3 are H and R4 and R5 are independently or<br>
both SO3H, have been shown to exhibit particularly good solubility in aqueous<br>
solution. For example, the compound of formula (III) has a solubility in water of<br>
1.2 mg/ml while rhein and diacerein are practically insoluble in water.<br>
The good solubility properties of the compounds of the present invention allows<br>
the compounds to be advantageously administered by parenteral routes, e.g.<br>
by injection or infusion, particularly as intraarticular, intramuscular, intravenous<br>
or subcutaneous injection or infusion.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared according to methods<br>
known in the art, using suitable known pharmaceutically excipients and/or<br>
additives.<br>
Any suitable conventional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients are<br>
contemplated, for example diluents, binders, surfactants, lubricants,<br>
suspending agents, emulsifiers, buffers anticaking agents, aqueous or oily<br>
carriers, disintegrating agents, preserving agents, flavouring agents,<br>
sweetening agents, colouring agents, in accordance with the selected route of<br>
administration.<br>
Suitable dosage regimes will vary dependent, amongst other things, on factors<br>
such as the therapeutic application, the severity of the condition and with<br>
respect to the patient to be treated. Typical daily dosage amounts may vary in<br>
the order of from about 0.05 mg to about 150 mg per kg of patient bodyweight<br>
per day. In general terms a daily dosage of from about 10mg to 500mg per day,<br>
such as between about 10mg and about 250mg per day may be envisaged.<br>
The amount of active ingredient in a unit dosage from will depend on the above<br>
factors and also on the chosen route of administration, and will generally be in<br>
the region of 1 mg to 500 mg of active ingredient per unit dosage form.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following-non limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of 6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid<br>
Rhein (1g) produced by the deacetylation of pure diacerein, having a purity<br>
more than 99%, was dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid (100 ml). The<br>
solution was heated at 100° C and stirred for 24 hours. Progress of the reaction<br>
was followed in real time using HPLC to completion of the reaction. The<br>
reaction mixture was then allowed to cool and poured into 21 water with stirring.<br>
The resultant solution was then stored over the night at 4°C. The unreacted<br>
rhein salting material was eliminated by centrifuge. The compound 6-sulfo-4,5-<br>
dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid was precipitated as its<br>
sodium salt by the addition of 110 g of sodium chloride. The resulting<br>
suspension was cooled at 4°C for one hour, then centrifuged to separate out<br>
the solid product and dried under vacuum. 2.32 g of product was obtained.<br>
Elimination of salts:<br>
The product obtained above was added to water (115 ml) with mixing at 4°C for<br>
30 minutes. The suspension was then centrifuged and decanted to eliminate<br>
the supernatant with the residual salts. This operation was repeated seven<br>
times until a constant conductivity (around 330 µS/cm), measured with a<br>
conductivity meter (Radiometer CDM 206). The residue after centrifuging was<br>
then dried under vacuum to obtain 480 mg of product, with a purity of 95.6% as<br>
determined by HPLC.<br>
Example 2<br>
Characterization<br>
1H-NMR analysis:<br>
1H-NMR spectaim of the product obtained in example 1 was carried out in<br>
dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) using a Bruker® spectrometer at 400 MHz. The<br>
spectra obtained, shown in figures 1(a) to 1(c), shows concordance with the<br>
product 6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid.<br>
The 1H-NMR spectra indicates the presence of only four aromatic protons, two<br>
in the meta position and two in ortho positions. Showing that the sulphonic acid<br>
substitution has occurred in the ring which previously had only a hydroxyl<br>
substituent. The chemical displacements (shifts), compared to caculated<br>
chemical displacements on the basis of increments, show the substitution of the<br>
sulphonic acid group to be in the ortho position.<br>
MS analysis:<br>
Mass spectroscopy carried out on the product of example 1 with an Agilent<br>
1100 LC-MS Spectrometer, with ionisation at atmospheric pressure in negative<br>
eletro-spray mode. The spectrum obtained, shown in figure 2, shows a peak at<br>
364, and thus concords with the product 6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-<br>
anthracene carboxylic acid, formula (III).<br>
Example 3<br>
Preparation of 6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid<br>
sodium salt<br>
Rhein (1g) produced by the deacetylation of pure diacerein, having a purity<br>
more than 99%, was dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid (100 ml). The<br>
solution was heated at 100° C and stirred for 24 hours. Progress of the reaction<br>
was followed in real time using HPLC to completion of the reaction. The<br>
reaction mixture was then allowed to cool and poured into 21 water with stirring.<br>
The resultant solution was then stored over the night at 4°C. The unreacted<br>
rhein salting material was eliminated by centrifuge. The pH of the surnatant<br>
was adjusted to 7.0 with NaOH 1M. The product 6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-<br>
dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid, in the form of its sodium salt, was then<br>
isolated and purified from the solution by preparative HPLC using a reversed<br>
phase C18 silica column and methanol/water/H3PO4 eluent. 1g of product was<br>
isolated and characterised as 6-sulfo-4,5-dihydroxy-9,10-dioxo-2-anthracene<br>
carboxylic acid sodium salt by NMR and MS as in example 2.<br>
Example 4<br>
In vitro studies on IL-1ß inhibition in human chondrocytes<br>
The activity of the compound of example 1, and of rhein in inhibiting the<br>
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated production of IL-1ß cytokine by human<br>
normal and osteoarthritic (OA) chondrocytes was studied.<br>
Materials and methods:<br>
Human cartilage was obtained during orthopaedic surgery for total hip<br>
prosthesis due to traumatic fracture in normal subjects or OA patients. Patients<br>
with OA were selected on the basis of the following criteria (1) bi-lateral OA, (2)<br>
diagnoses of moderate OA (grade l-lll, Kellgren-Laurence), supported by<br>
radiology and pathology.<br>
A suspension of isolated chondrocytes was prepared from cartilage specimens<br>
obtained from four OA patient and nine normal subjects. Specimens were<br>
obtained and maintained under aseptic conditions. The cartilage was cut into<br>
small fragments and incubated with 1 mg/ml clostridial collagenase in<br>
carbonate/bicarbonate buffer for 48 hours at 37°C. Once separated from the<br>
cartilage matrix, chondrocytes were centrifuged at 1500 RPM for five minutes.<br>
The separated chondrocytes, suspended in culture medium (DMEM<br>
supplemented with 10% SCF) were used for the experiment. Cell viability was<br>
evaluated by Trypan blue exclusion.<br>
In vitro stimulation of chondrocytes with bacterial endotoxin (LPS) for the<br>
production of IL-1ß was carried out as follows:<br>
Aliquots of 1 x 106 cells/ml in culture medium were seeded in 15 ml Falcon<br>
tubes and maintained under agitation on a gyratory shaker (100 RPM).<br>
Chondrocytes were cultured for 48 hours in the presence of MPS (10 µg/ml)<br>
with 20 mg/ml rhein, or increasing concentrations (1, 5,10, 20 and 30 µg/ml) of<br>
the test compound (compound of Example 1). For the samples with rhein the<br>
solution was subjected to five minutes sonication in order to minimize solubility<br>
problems related to the hydrophobic nature of rhein. This problem was not<br>
present for the solutions of the test compound due to its good solubility.<br>
IL-1ß production by chondrocytes was assayed in the culture medium in the<br>
various sample cultures by an ELISA kit.<br>
Figure 3 shows the results obtained with rhein and the compound of Example 1<br>
on IL-1ß production in LPS-stimulated normal and OA chondrocytes, as<br>
evaluated by ELISA. Figure 4 shows the dose-dependent inhibition of IL-1ß<br>
production of normal chondrocytes by the test compound (compound of<br>
Example 1). The results illustrated in figure 3 show the compound of the<br>
present invention to exhibit significantly increased IL-1ß inhibition activity<br>
compared with rhein. Figure 4 shows the compound according to the invention<br>
to provide significant inhibition of IL-1ß production, with maximum inhibition<br>
between 10 and 20 mg/ml.<br>
