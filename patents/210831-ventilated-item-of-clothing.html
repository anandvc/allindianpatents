Description<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a ventilated item of clothing such as a coat, jacket, overcoat or the like. Background Art<br>
It is known that man wears clothing and shoes to protect his body from atmospheric agents such as snow, rain, wind and in particular from the cold.<br>
The human body is protected mainly by resorting to various layers of clothing; the first one, underwear, is in direct contact with the body and is in turn covered by successive layers according to the outside temperature and to the environmental conditions.<br>
Accordingly, it is sufficient to add or remove one or more layers of clothing to achieve comfort and find oneself at an optimum temperature.<br>
The human body is inherently provided with "mechanisms" which help it to adapt thermally to the environment in which it is placed.<br>
In the presence of overheating, for example, the body reacts by increasing perspiration which, by evaporating, allows a natural reduction in body temperature.<br>
The heat generated by the human body, in addition to producing perspiration, is also dissipated externally by radiation.<br>
This heat, which is always present, warms the air contained between the body and the item of clothing; the air, by raising, causes further overheating and discomfort, for example at the shoulders, which constitute regions of accumulation.<br>
If water vapor is unable to escape from the protective enclosure that surrounds the human body (clothing), humidity increases until the vapor condenses and returns to the liquid state of perspiration, soaking the clothing starting from the underwear that constitutes the first inner layer.<br>
This unpleasant drawback can currently be remedied by removing the wet item of clothing to replace it with a dry one, for example immediately after the end of a challenging mountain climb, but this causes a sudden cooling of the body and the danger of pneumonia and other chill-related diseases.<br><br>
2<br>
While on the one hand protection of the human body against the most adverse cold conditions is very effective by way of the use of highly insulating materials, on the other hand one cannot avoid noting the inability to allow the body to perspire naturally, ensuring the escape of the water vapor produced by perspiration.<br>
Evidently, during the warm season the problem is more significant one force many people to take several showers and change clothing continuously through the day.<br>
An attempt has been made to solve these drawbacks by using clothing which has special vapor-permeability characteristics, for example by resorting to a material known commercially by the trademark "Gore-Tex" owned by the company WL Gore Ass Inc.; however, such clothing is able to expel only a fraction, often a small fraction, of the vapor produced by sweating and generated by the human body, especially at the regions that are richer is sweat glands, and in any case is unable to ensure an effective changing of the air inside the item of clothing.<br>
Vapor permeation in fact occurs to a limited extent, because of partial pressure of vapor sufficient to expel the sweat (in the vapor phase) outward does not form inside the layer of the item being worn.<br>
In other cases, a remedy has been attempted by forming the items of clothing openings which can be closed to varying extents at the regions where sweat concentrates most, for example under the armpits, but even this does not ensure particular effects, since actual air changing is not produced.<br>
It should also be noted that the attempt to increase effectiveness by providing a large number of openings also has not yielded satisfactory results.<br>
In practice, in fact some portions of the items of clothing always cling directly to the body, particularly the shoulders and chest, and therefore the water vapor generated by the evaporation of body sweat remains trapped between the body and the regions of the clothing that do not cling directly to the body (generally the abdominal region, the lumber region of the back and most of all the region under the armpits), thus preventing its escape.<br><br>
3<br>
 US-A-3 213 485 discloses an item of dress rainwear, with completely covered shoulders, and with shoulder spacer elements and concealed air vents at the armpits and front pockets, for providing a conventional overall and attractive appearance. US-A-5 727 256 disclosed a shoulder zipper which when open accesses a mesh fabric in contact with the user's shoulders. Disclosure of the Invention<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide an item of clothing which solves the drawbacks noted above a conventional ones.<br>
Within this aim an important object of the present invention is to provide an item of clothing which ensures adequate air changing inside the protective enclosure that surrounds the body.<br>
Another object of the invention is to allow, for ail practical purposes, the natural thermoregulation of the human body.<br>
In accordance with the invention, there is provided an item of clothing as defined in the appended claims. Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the present invention will become better apparent from the following detailed description of an embodiment thereof, illustrated only by way of non-limitative example in the accompanying drawings, wherein :<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view, partially in phantom line, of the upper part of an item of clothing according to the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a partially output front view of the item of clothing of Figure 1, shown being worn by a user. Wavs of carrying out the Invention<br>
With reference to the figures, an Item of clothing such as a coat, jacket, overcoat or the like in generally designated by the reference numeral 10 and comprises spacer means 11 which in the specific case are constituted by elements made of soft material such as terry, felt, non-woven fabric, woven fabrics (for example those known as "double jersey') or the like, joined to the item of clothing by means of stitched seams, Velcro couplings, zip fasteners, adhesives, etcetera, in the internal part of the shoulders 12 of the item of clothing so as to generate as interspace 13 between the shoulders 14 of the user 15 and the fabric which the item of clothing is mode of.<br><br>
4<br>
By lifting the item of clothing 10 off the user's shoulders 14 by way of the spacer means 11, the water vapor of heat generated fay the user's body no fonger remain strapped in the abdominal region, in the lumbar region of the back and most of all in the region under the armpits, but tend to rise, encountering none of the obstacles currently formed by the regions in which the item of clothing clings to the body.<br>
The item of clothing 10 further comprises elements 16 for venting the warm air, produced by the user's body, that has risen into the interspace 13; such elements are constituted, in this case, by a mesh 16 which is applied to a corresponding opening of each shoulder 12 of the item of clothing.<br>
The mesh 16 can be conveniently combined, in a downward region, with a membrane which is impermeable to water and permeable to vapor, is not shown in the figures, and is for example of the type commonly known as Gore-Tex.<br>
As an alternative, it is possible to provide per se known ventilation elements, for example of the type with a metallic ring which surrounds the edges of a corresponding hole of the item of clothing.<br>
Accordingly, by combining the interspace 13 formed between the user's body and the item of clothing 10 by means of the spacers 11 with the air venting elements 16 one obtains outward expulsion of the warm air that has risen due to the stack effect<br>
above the shoulders 14.<br>
By adjusting the extension of the area effected by the air venting elements 16 it is<br>
of course possible to adjust the amount of air expelled, so as to not cause problems in<br>
the natural thermoregulation of the human body.	<br>
In practice it has been observed that the intended air and objects of the present<br>
invention have been achieved.<br>
The  invention thus conceived is susceptible of numerous modification and<br>
variations, all of which are within the scope of the inventive concept.<br>
All the details may furthermore.be replaced with other technically equivalent<br>
elements.<br><br>
