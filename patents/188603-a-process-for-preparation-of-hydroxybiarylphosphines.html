				<td>- 1A -<br>
a present invention relates to a process which is improved with respect  to the prior art for the preparation  of  hydroxybiaryl-phosphines and novel compounds of this group as substances. Hydroxybiarylphosphirtes are important intermediates, for  example in the synthesis of phospbinophosphite ligands of the formula (A)<br><br>
The hydroxybiarylphosphines, prepared according to the present invention, are used as starting materials for the preparation of phosphite  igands. Such 1igands are used for the preparation of transition metal complexes, which are useful in the preparation of optically active a1dehydes.<br>
The abovementioned phosphinophosphite 1igands are used in enantioselective hydrofarmylation (EP 0614901, EP 0614902, EP 0614903, EP 0614870), By means of ensntioselective hydroforroy-lation, by reacting a suitable olefin with carbon monoxide and hydrogen, optically active aldehydes, for example, can be prepared -<br>
The preparation of the hydroxybiarylphosphines required as intermediates for the preparation of the phosphinophosphite ligands is described in more detail in HP 0614903 and in Tetrahedron Letters, 31, 6321 (19900 and J org Chem 58, .1945 (1993). It starts from dihydroxybiary1 compounds and proceeds via not less than 4 stages, described in more detail by the reaction equations below- Some of these reaction stages are costly and are associated, furthermore, with high expenditure for the necessary purification steps.<br>
iA<br><br>
2<br>
The reaction proceeds via the following 4 stages:<br>
1st stage<br><br>
Tf2O: Trifluoromethylsulfonic anhydride 2nd stage<br><br><br>
3 3rd stage<br><br>
4th stage<br><br>
HSiCl3:   Trichlorosilane NEt3:     Triethylamine<br>
HSiCl3:   Trichlorosilane NEt3:     Triethylamine<br>
A further disadvantage of this process is that a disub-stituted phoaphine oxide, that is diphenylphosphine oxide, must be employed in the second stage. However, only a restricted number of suitable disubstituted phosphine oxides are available. This considerably restricts the possibilities of this synthesis.<br>
A further critical disadvantage is the fact that diphenylphosphine oxide reacts at random with one of the two TfO radicals. This reaction is therefore not suitable for specifically substituting one of the two TfO radicals by the diphenylphosphine oxide radical. A mixture of both substitution products always forms. This is a disadvantage, in particular, when unsyrametri-cal dihydroxybiaryl compounds are used, since mixtures<br><br>
4<br>
form which cannot be separated into the individual components, or can only be separated with a disproportionately high expenditure.<br>
This process is therefore chiefly suitable only for the reaction of symmetrical dihydroxybiaryl compounds in which the two hydroxyl groups are identical in the sense of being indistinguishable. In this case, it does not actually matter which of the two hydroxyl groups or TfO radicals are exchanged for the diphenylphosphine oxide, since an exchange of the one hydroxyl group or of the one TfO radical always leads to the same end product as exchange of the other hydroxyl group or of the other TfO radical.<br>
There is therefore vigorous interest in providing a process for the preparation of hydroxybiarylphosphines which does not have the above described disadvantages, can be implemented industrially without great expense starting from comparatively readily accessible starting materials, does not start from dihydroxybiaryl compounds and is therefore also not restricted to the reaction of symmetrical dihydroxybiaryl compounds.<br>
This object is achieved by a process for the preparation of hydroxybiarylphosphines of the formula<br><br>
in which R1, R2, a, b, Ar-Ar, R3 and R4 have the meaning below. It comprises reacting an oxaphosphorine of the formula <br>
in which Ar-Ar is biphenyl, 1-phenylnaphthyl or 1,1*-binaphthyl, R1 and R2 are identical or different and are F, Cl, alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 8 car-<br><br>
5<br>
bon atoms or are substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a and b are identical or different and are an integer from 0 to 4, X in each case is Cl or Br and the Ar-P and the Ar-O bond are each arranged in the ortho-position to the Ar-Ar bond, with a compound R3-Me and R4-Me, in which R3 and R4 are identical or different and are alkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, alkaryl having 7 to 9 carbon atoms, Ar3-(R5)n, in which Ar3 is an aryl radical having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, R5 is alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 8 carbon atoms, F, Cl, CF3, dialfcylamino having a total of 2 to 8 carbon atoms or -CH2N(alkyl)2 having 1 to 3 carbon atoms per alkyl and n is an integer from 0 to 5, or with a compound Me-R3-R4-Me, in which -R3-R4- forms a chain of 3 to 5 members to which one or two aromatic rings or ring systems having 6 to 10 carbon atoms are optionally anellated. Me is a monovalent metal or one equivalent of a polyvalent metal, in the presence of a solvent at a temperature of -40 to 160°C, then adding water and, if appropriate, a water-insoluble organic solvent and separating the aqueous phase from the organic phase.<br>
The reaction proceeds, as described for example by the equation below, with cleavage of the P ring in the oxa-phosphorine (II):<br><br>
It is to be considered as highly surprising that it is possible using the process of the invention to open the phosphorus-containing ring in the oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) with very high selectivity, not only the Ar-Ar bond, but also at the same time the Ar-P bond remaining unchanged.<br><br>
6<br>
This ensures that even when unsymmetrical oxaphosphorines are used, a uniform hydroxy-biarylphosphine is always formed and not a mixture containing various hydroxybiarylphosphines and other byproducts and breakdown products.<br>
Furthermore/ the process of the invention permits the phosphorus atom to be specifically substituted either by two identical radicals or by two different radicals.<br>
The process of the invention, moreover, starts from comparatively readily accessible oxaphosphorines of the formula (II) whose preparation is subject-matter of a German patent application (File number: 195 21 339.4) filed on the same day as the present patent application.<br>
A further advantage of the process of the invention is that it is not necessary to isolate one of the intermediates between the individual working steps in order then to process this further.<br>
In order to illustrate which oxaphosphorines of the formula (II) can be used, the following compounds of the formulae (IIIa), (IV), (IV), (IVa) and (V) may be mentioned, but without making in this case any claim as to completeness of the enumeration.<br>
The oxaphosphorines of the formula (III)<br><br>
are derived from 6-chloro-6H-dibenz[c,e][l,2]oxa-<br>
phosphorine or 6-bromo-6H-<br>
dibenz[c,e][l,2]oxaphosphorine. The oxaphosphorine of<br><br>
7 the formula (IlIa)<br><br>
is 6-chloro-6H-4-phenyldibenz[c,e][1,2]oxaphosphorine or 6-bromo-6H-4-phenyldibenztc,e][1,2]oxaphosphorine. The oxaphosphorines of the formula (IV) containing a 1-phenylnaphthyl radical as Ar-Ar<br><br>
are derived from 6-chloro-6H-benzo[e]naphth[2,1-c][1,2]oxaphosphorine or 6-bromo-6H-benzo[e]naphth[2,1-c][1,2]oxaphosphorine and the oxaphosphorines of the formula (IVa) similarly containing a  1-phenylnaphthyl radical as Ar-Ar<br><br>
are derived from 5-chloro-5H-benzo[c]naphth[1,2-<br>
c][1,2]oxaphosphorine or 5-bromo-5H-benzo[c]naphth[l,2-<br>
c][1,2]oxaphosphorine.<br>
The oxaphosphorines of the formula (V) containing a<br><br>
8<br>
binaphthyl radical as Ar-Ar<br><br>
are derived from 3-chloro-3H-dinaphtho[2,l-c:l',2'-e]-[1,2]oxaphosphorine or 3-bromo-3H-dinaphtho-[2,lc:l' ,2' -e][1,2]oxaphosphorine.<br>
It is understood that, in the abovementioned formulae, R1, R2, a and b have the meaning already given.<br>
Compounds of particular interest are oxaphosphorines of the formula (II) in which R1 and R2 have the meaning mentioned above and a is 0 and b is 1 or a is 1 and b is 0. These oxaphosphorines are relatively readily accessible, since they only have one radical R1 and R2, and at the same time they are unsymmetrical. Particular preference is to be given to oxaphosphorines of the formula (II) in which a and b are each 0.<br>
The process of the invention can be carried out with great success by using an oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) , in which R1 and R2 are identical or different and are F, Cl, alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 4 carbon atoms or are substituted or unsubstituted phe-nyl, a and b are identical or different and are an integer from 0 to 2, in particular a is 0 and b is 1 or a is 1 and b is 0, and by using, in particular, an oxaphosphorine of the formula (II), in which R1 and R2 are identical or different and are F, Cl, alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 4 carbon atoms, a and b are identical or different and are 0 or 1, in particular a and b are different and are 0 or 1.<br>
According to a process variant, an oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) is used, in which Ar-Ar is<br><br>
9<br>
1-phenylnaphthyl and the Ar-P bond is arranged on the phenyl ring of the 1-phenylnaphthyl or on the naphthyl ring of the 1-phenylnaphthyl. These oxaphosphorines can, as already described by the compounds of the formulae (IV) and (IVa), be substituted by (R1)a and (R1)b, oxaphosphorines of this type, in which a is 0 and b is 1 or a is 1 and b is zero or in which a and b are each zero, because of their relatively good availability, achieving particular interest.<br>
As compounds R3-Me and/or R4-Me or Me-R3-R4-Me, in which R -R4 are joined together and form a chain having 3 to 5 carbon atoms and the chain can be substituted or unsubstituted, in particular one or two aromatic rings or ring systems each having 6 to 10 carbon atoms can be anellated to the chain, use can generally be made of organometallic compounds. Me is, for example, MgX, where X is chlorine, bromine or iodine, in particular chlorine or bromine, or an alkali metal, for example lithium, sodium or potassium, in particular sodium or lithium, preferably lithium.<br>
The reaction is carried out in the presence of a solvent. It is advisable to use as solvent a dipolar aprotic solvent or a nonpolar solvent or a mixture of these solvents.<br>
In this context, it may be noted that organometallic compounds are usually handled in specific solvents. Grignard compounds are frequently used dissolved or suspended in an ether.<br>
The solvents used can be, without making any claim as to the completeness, an ether or an ether mixture, for example dialkyl ether having 2 to 4 carbon atoms per alkyl, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, toluene, ortho-xylene, meta-xylene, para-xylene, a mixture of isomeric xylenes, mesitylene, ethylbenzene or mixtures of these solvents.<br>
The reaction is presumed to proceed in two stages, one<br><br>
10<br>
equivalent of the organometallic compound first reacting with the oxaphosphorine. In this case, the X on the P atom in the oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) is probably substituted.<br>
In a subsequent stage, a further equivalent of the organometallic compounds reacts with the previously-substituted P atom of the oxaphosphorine, the ring probably being opened by cleavage of the P-0 bond.<br>
Utilizing this reaction sequence, the oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) can first be reacted with the compound R -Me and then with the compound R4-Me or, vice versa, the oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) can first be reacted with the compound R4-Me and then with the compound R3-Me.<br>
By this means, hydroxybiarylphosphines of the formula I are obtained in a simple manner whose P atom, because of the substitution by two different radicals R3 and R4, has in total three different radicals, that is the hydroxybiaryl radical, the radical R3 and the radical R4.<br>
This reaction sequence can of course also be applied to the reaction of the compound Me-R3-R4-Me, the phosphorus atom being incorporated into a ring.<br>
In most cases it is sufficient to carry out the reaction at a temperature of 40 to 160°C, in particular 60 to 120°C. This relates to the entire reaction sequence, that is both stages.<br>
However, the reaction can also be allowed to proceed in a first stage at -40 to 80, in particular -20 to 60, preferably -10 to 50, °C and then in a second stage at 20 to 160, in particular 40 to 140, preferably 60 to 120, °C.<br>
The reaction conditions also depend to a certain extent on the type of organometallic compound used.<br><br>
11<br>
Organometallic compounds having a high reactivity/ for example alkyl-Grignard compounds or alkali metal alkyls, can be reacted even at very low temperatures, whereas less reactive organometallic compounds, for example aryl-Grignard compounds, necessitate higher reaction temperatures.<br>
However, the reaction conditions also depend to a certain extent on the type of the oxaphosphorine used. Oxaphosphorines of the formula (II) having elevated reactivity can be reacted at lower temperatures. These may include oxaphosphorines whose P-containing ring is under stress, for example owing to twisting of the two aryl radicals with respect to each other about the Ar-Ar bond. Oxaphosphorines whose p-containing ring has no stress, or only low stress, or oxaphosphorines whose P atom is sterically hindered owing to bulky substituents and is not freely accessible to an attack by the organometallic compound can, in contrast, make a reaction at elevated temperatures necessary.<br>
Usually, a solution of the oxaphosphorine of the formula (II) is introduced, one of the abovementioned solvents being able to be used. A solution or suspension of the organometallic compound R3-Me, R4-Me or Me-R3-R4-Me is added dropwise with stirring to this solution. The organometallic compound is used in the stoichiometrically required amount or in a stoichiometric excess.<br>
In the first reaction stage, 1.0 to 1.5, in particular 1.0 to 1.3, mol of the organometallic compounds R3-He or R4-Me or Me-R3-R4-Me are added per mol of oxaphosphorine of the formula (II), and in the second reaction stage, 1.0 to 1.5, in particular 1.0 to 1.3, mol of the organometallic compounds R3-Me or R4-Me are added per mol of oxaphosphorine of the formula (II)o<br>
The reaction proceeds in the absence of water, due to the use of the water-sensitive organometallic<br><br>
12<br>
compounds. It Is advisable to allow the reaction to proceed under a protective gas atmosphere, for example under anhydrous N2 or argon.<br>
The procedure can alternatively be performed the other way round and the solution or suspension of the organo-metallic compound can be introduced and the oxaphos-phorine or the solution of the oxaphosphorine can be added with stirring.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture is cooled, if a high reaction temperature should make this necessary, and water is added. The addition of water is necessary in order to hydrolyse any organometallic compounds still present and to hydrolyse the products formed due to the reaction.<br>
In order to promote or induce the phase separation, a water-insoluble organic solvent can be added to the reaction mixture. Usually, toluene, ortho-xylene, meta-xylene, para-xylene, mixtures of isomeric xylenes, mesitylene, ethylbenzene, esters which are derived from a carboxylic acid, in particular an aliphatic carboxylic acid having 1 to 8, in particular 1 to 4, carbon atoms and an aliphatic alcohol having 1 to 8, in particular 1 to 4, carbon atoms, for example ethyl, propyl or butyl acetate, are suitable for use as water-insoluble organic solvent.<br>
In some cases, it can be useful to adjust the reaction mixture or the aqueous phase contained therein to a pH 
 <br>
13<br>
The hydroxybiarylphosphines of the formula (I) are usually further purified by crystallization.<br>
The process of the invention may be carried out continuously or discontinuously, particularly simply discon-tinuously. It may be carried out at superatmospheric pressure, atmospheric pressure or reduced pressure, particularly simply under the reaction pressure which establishes itself.<br>
The present invention further relates to novel hydroxybiarylphosphines of the formula I<br><br>
in which Ar-Ar is biphenyl, 1-phenylnaphthyl or 1,1'-binaphthyl, in particular 1-phenylnaphthyl, R1 and R2 are identical or different and are F, Cl, alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 8 carbon atoms or are substituted or unsubstituted aryl, a and b are identical or different and are an integer from 0 to 4, and the Ar-P and the Ar-0 bond are each arranged in the ortho-position to the Ar-Ar bond, R3 and R4 are identical or different and are alkyl having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, alkaryl having 7 to 9 carbon atoms, Ar3-(R5)n, in which Ar3 is an aryl radical having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, R5 is alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 8 carbon atoms, F, Cl, CF3, dialkylamino having a total of 2 to 8 carbon atoms or -CH2N(alkyl) 2 having 1 to 3 carbon atoms per alkyl and n is an integer from 0 to 5, or -R3-R4- forms a chain of 3 to 5 members to which one or two aromatic rings or ring systems having 6 to 10 carbon atoms are optionally anellated, and, together with the P atom, forms a ring having 4 to 6 members, with the proviso that Ar3-(R5)n is not phenyl or a phenyl substituted by halogen, alkyl or alkoxy each having 1 to 8 carbon atoms, if Ar-Ar is biphenyl or 1,1'-binaphthyl and R3 and R4 are identical in each<br><br>
14 case.<br>
The invention relates in particular to hydroxybiaryl-phosphines of the formula (I), in which Ar-Ar is biphenyl, 1-phenylnaphthyl or 1,1-binaphthyl, in particular 1-phenylnaphthyl, R1 and R2 are identical or different and are F, Cl, alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 4 carbon atoms or substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, a and b are identical or different and are an integer from 0 to 2, in particular 0 or 1.<br>
The invention further relates to<br>
hydroxybiarylphosphines of the formula (I), in which Ar-Ar is biphenyl, 1-phenylnaphthyl or 1,1'-binaphthyl, in particular 1-phenylnaphthyl, R3 and R4 are identical or different and are alkyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having 4 to 6 carbon atoms, benzyl, Ar3-(R5), where Ar3 is an aryl radical having 6 to 10 carbon atoms, R5 is alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 4 carbon atoms, F, Cl, CF3, dialkylamino having a total of 2 to 8 carbon atoms or -CH2N(alkyl) 2 having 1 to 3 carbon atoms per alkyl and n is an integer from 0 to 5, with the proviso that Ar3-(R5)n is not phenyl or a phenyl substituted by halogen, alkyl or alkoxy having in each case 1 to 8 carbon atoms, if Ar-Ar is biphenyl or 1.1'-binaphthyl and R3 and R4 are identical.<br>
In the event that Ar-Ar is 1-phenylnaphthyl, a feature of the novel hydroxybiarylphosphines is that the radical -PR3R4 is arranged either on the phenyl ring of the 1-phenylnaphthyl or on the naphthyl ring of the 1-phenylnaphthyl.<br>
