				<td>PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING MINERAL WOOL,<br>
COBALT-BASED ALLOYS FOR THE PROCESS<br>
AND OTHER USES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing mineral wool<br>
by fiberizing a molten mineral composition, using tools made of a cobalt-based<br>
alloy having a high-temperature mechanical strength in an oxidizing medium, such<br>
as molten glass, and to cobalt-based alloys that can be used at high temperature,<br>
especially for the production of articles for the manufacture and/or hot-conversion<br>
of glass or other mineral material, such as components of machines for<br>
manufacturing mineral wool.<br>
One fiberizing technique, called internal centrifuging, consists in letting<br>
liquid glass drop continuously into an assembly of parts rotating at a very high<br>
rotation speed about their vertical axis. A master part, called a "spinner dish",<br>
receives the glass against one of its walls called the "band" which is pierced with<br>
holes through which the glass passes due to the effect of the centrifugal force in<br>
order to escape therefrom on all sides in the form of molten filaments. An annular<br>
burner located above the outside of the spinner dish, which produces a downward<br>
blast of gas hugging the outer wall of the band, deflects these filaments<br>
downwards and attenuates them. The latter then "solidify" in the form of glass<br>
wool.<br>
The spinner dish is a fiberizing tool which is highly stressed thermally (heat<br>
shocks when stopping and starting and the creation, in steady use, of a<br>
temperature gradient along the part), mechanically (centrifugal force, and erosion<br>
due to the passage of the glass) and chemically (oxidation and corrosion by the<br>
molten glass, and by the hot gasses expelled by the burner around the spinner<br><br>
dish). Its main modes of deterioration are: deformation of the vertical walls by hot<br>
creep, horizontal or vertical cracking, or wear of the fiberizing orifices by erosion,<br>
which purely and simply require the components to be replaced. Their constituent<br>
material must therefore withstand the above for a production time long enough to<br>
remain compatible with the technical and economic constraints of the process. For<br>
this purpose, materials are sought which exhibit a certain ductility, creep strength<br>
and corrosion and/or oxidation resistance.<br>
A conventional material for producing these tools is a superalloy based on<br>
nickel and chromium, reinforced by chromium and tungsten carbides, which can<br>
be used up to a maximum temperature of about 1000 to 1050°C.<br>
To fiberize glasses at a higher temperature, especially for manufacturing<br>
mineral wool from highly viscous glasses such as basalt, it has been proposed to<br>
use superalloys based on cobalt, this being a refractory element (melting point<br>
equal to 1495°C) which gives the matrix of the alloy a higher high-temperature<br>
intrinsic mechanical strength than a nickel-based matrix.<br>
These alloys always contain chromium for oxidation resistance, and<br>
generally carbon and tungsten in order to obtain a reinforcing effect caused by the<br>
precipitation of carbides. They also contain nickel in solid solution, the nickel<br>
stabilizing the face-centred cubic crystal lattice of cobalt at all temperatures.<br>
Thus, WO-A-99/16919 discloses a cobalt-based alloy having improved<br>
high-temperature mechanical properties, essentially comprising the following<br>
elements (in percentages by weight of the alloy):<br><br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt and inevitable impurities, the molar ratio of<br>
tantalum with respect to carbon being of the order of 0.4 to 1.<br>
The selection of carbon and tantalum proportions is intended to form, in the<br>
alloy, a dense but discontinuous network of intergranular carbides essentially<br>
consisting of chromium carbides in the Cr7C3 and (Cr,W)23C6 forms and of<br>
tantalum carbides TaC. This selection gives the alloy improved high-temperature<br>
mechanical properties and oxidation resistance, allowing a molten glass at a<br>
temperature of 1080°C to be fiberized.<br>
The objective of the invention was to be able to fiberize glass or a similar<br>
material at even higher temperatures in order to work within a more varied range<br>
of compositions of mineral materials.<br>
In this regard, the subject of the invention is a process for manufacturing<br>
mineral wool by internal centrifuging, in which a stream of molten mineral material<br>
is poured into a fiberizing spinner dish, the peripheral band of which is pierced by<br>
a multitude of orifices through which filaments of molten mineral material escape,<br>
these filaments then being attenuated into wool due to the action of a gas,<br>
characterized in that the temperature of the mineral material in the spinner dish is<br>
at least 1100°C and in that the fiberizing spinner dish is made of a cobalt-based<br>
alloy comprising the following elements (in percentages by weight of the alloy):<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt and inevitable impurities, the molar ratio of<br>
tantalum to carbon being at least 0.3.<br>
This process is especially characterized by the use of an alloy very rich in<br>
tantalum compared with the known alloys. In such an alloy composition, the<br>
intragranular and intergranular reinforcement essentially makes use of the<br><br>
tantalum, which is present especially at the grain boundaries in the form of the<br>
carbide TaC.<br>
Very surprisingly, it has been found that these alloys exhibit excellent<br>
mechanical properties at high temperatures of about 1200 to 1300°C, which allow<br>
them to withstand the very high stresses imposed by the centrifuging technique of<br>
fiberizing, despite the presence of highly aggressive oxidizing media (glass, hot<br>
air).<br>
This is because the inventors have been able to observe that, for fiberizing<br>
temperatures as high as 1150-1200°C and higher, the mechanical strength is<br>
the predominant factor in the lifetime of the spinner dishes. Although other alloys,<br>
especially those according to WO-A-99/16919 have excellent resistance to<br>
oxidation and to corrosion by the glass, their mechanical properties prove to be<br>
inadequate above 1100°C, particularly above 1150°C, causing the spinner dish to<br>
be rapidly destroyed.<br>
The process according to the invention is characterized by the use of alloys<br>
having a good compromise between mechanical strength and oxidation resistance<br>
above 1100°C, and advantageously above 1150°C. This compromise is obtained<br>
using alloys whose intergranular regions are rich in tantalum carbide precipitates<br>
which have a high melting point and fulfil a mechanical reinforcement function by<br>
preventing intergranular creep at very high temperature. The high tantalum<br>
content present in the alloy furthermore has an appreciable effect on the oxidation<br>
behaviour:<br>
-	in the matrix, the tantalum present in solid solution or in the form of fine<br>
intergranular carbides (TaC) may form oxides (Ta2O5) which mix with the<br>
self-passivating surface layer of chromium oxide (Cr2O3) to which they further<br>
provide cohesion and bonding with respect to the alloy;<br>
-	at the grain boundaries, the intergranular tantalum carbides close to the<br>
surface of the spinner dish oxidize there to form Ta2O5, the clusters of Ta2O5<br>
forming "plugs" which prevent penetration by the aggressive medium (liquid glass,<br>
hot gases) into the intergranular spaces.<br>
The alloy thus obtained remains stable at high temperature by virtue of the<br>
limited solid solubility of TaC at 1200-1300°C.<br>
The process according to the invention therefore makes it possible to<br><br>
fiberize glass or a similar molten mineral composition having a liquidus<br>
temperature Tliq of about 1100°C or higher, more particularly 1140°C or higher.<br>
In general, these molten mineral compositions may be fiberized within a<br>
temperature range (for the molten composition entering the spinner dish) of<br>
between Tliq and Tlog2.5 where Tlog2.5 is the temperature at which the molten<br>
composition has a viscosity of 102.5 poise (dPa.s). In order to fiberize above<br>
1150°C, the corresponding compositions are, according to the invention,<br>
preferably those whose Tliq is at least 1140°C.<br>
Preferable among these mineral compositions are compositions containing<br>
a significant amount of iron, these being less corrosive with respect to the<br>
constituent metal of the fiberizing components.<br>
Thus, the process according to the invention advantageously uses an<br>
oxidizing mineral composition, especially one which is oxidizing with respect to<br>
chromium, capable of repairing or reconstituting the protective Cr2O3 oxide layer<br>
which forms on the surface. For this purpose, compositions containing iron<br>
essentially in the ferric form (oxide Fe2O3), especially with a molar ratio of II and III<br>
oxidation states, expressed by the ratio FeO/(FeO + Fe2O3) of about 0.1 to 0.3,<br>
especially 0.15 to 0.20, are preferable.<br>
Advantageously, the mineral composition contains a high iron content<br>
allowing a rapid rate of reconstitution of the chromium oxide, with an iron oxide<br>
content (called "total iron" content, corresponding to the total iron content<br>
expressed conventionally in the form of equivalent Fe2O3) of at least 3%,<br>
preferably at least 4%, and especially about 4 to 12%, particularly at least 5%.<br>
Within the above redox range, this corresponds to a content of ferric iron alone<br>
(Fe2O3) of at least 2.7%, preferably at least 3.6%.<br>
Such compositions are known, especially from WO-99/56525, and<br>
advantageously comprise the following constituents:<br><br><br><br>
Other compositions prove to be particularly suitable for the process<br>
according to the invention.<br>
They are characterized by the following percentages by weight:<br><br>
MgO being between 0 and 5%, especially between 0 and 2%, when R2O ≤ 13.0%.<br>
Advantageously, the mineral wool composition comprises the constituents<br>
mentioned below in the following percentages by weight:<br><br><br><br>
The compositions may include up to 2 or 3% of compounds to be<br>
considered as unanalysed impurities, as is known in this kind of composition.<br>
Because of the combination of a high alumina content, of between 16 and<br>
27%, preferably greater than 17% and/or preferably less than 25%, especially<br>
less than 22%, for a sum of network formers - silica and alumina - of between 57<br>
and 75%, preferably greater than 60% and/or preferably less than 72%, especially<br>
less than 70%, with a high amount of alkalis (R2O: soda and potash) of between<br>
10 and 17%, with MgO between 0 and 5%, especially between 0 and 2%, when<br>
R2O ≤ 13.0%, the compositions have the remarkable property of being fiberizable<br>
over a very wide temperature range and furthermore endow the fibres obtained<br>
with biosolubility at acid pH. Depending on the particular embodiments, the alkali<br>
content is preferably greater than 12%, especially greater than 13.0% and even<br>
13.3%, and/or preferably less than 15%, especially less than 14.5%.<br>
This range of compositions proves to be particularly beneficial as it has<br>
been possible to observe that, contrary to the received opinions, the viscosity of<br>
the molten glass does not drop significantly with increasing alkali content. This<br>
remarkable effect makes it possible to increase the difference between the<br>
temperature corresponding to the viscosity for fiberizing and the liquidus<br>
temperature of the phase which crystallizes, and thus to considerably improve the<br>
fiberizing conditions, and especially makes it possible to fiberize a new family of<br>
biosoluble glasses by internal centrifuging.<br>
According to one embodiment, the compositions have iron oxide contents<br>
of between 5 and 12%, especially between 5 and 8%, which may allow mineral-<br>
wool blankets to exhibit fire resistance.<br>
Advantageously, these compositions satisfy the ratio:<br>
(Na2O + K2O)/Al2O3 ≥ 0.5 , preferably (Na2O + K2O )/AI2O3 ≥ 0.6 , especially<br>
(Na2O + K2O)/Al203 ≥ 0.7 which appears to favour the obtaining of a temperature<br><br>
corresponding to the viscosity for fiberizing which is above the liquidus<br>
temperature.<br>
According to a variant, the compositions according to the invention<br>
preferably have a lime content of between 10 and 25%, especially greater than<br>
12%, preferably greater than 15% and/or preferably less than 23%, especially<br>
less than 20%, and even less than 17%, combined with a magnesia content of<br>
between 0 and 5%, with preferably less than 2% magnesia, especially less than<br>
1% magnesia and/or a magnesia content of greater than 0.3%, especially greater<br>
than 0.5%.<br>
According to another variant, the magnesia content is between 5 and 10%<br>
for a lime content of between 5 and 15%, and preferably between 5 and 10%.<br>
Adding P2O5, which is optional, at contents of between 0 and 3%,<br>
especially greater than 0.5% and/or less than 2%, may allow the biosolubility at<br>
neutral pH to be increased. Optionally, the composition may also contain boron<br>
oxide which may allow the thermal properties of the mineral wool to be improved,<br>
especially by tending to lower its coefficient of thermal conductivity in the radiative<br>
component and also to increase the biosolubility at neutral pH. Optionally, TiO2<br>
may also be included in the composition, for example up to 3%. Other oxides,<br>
such as BaO, SrO, MnO, Cr2O3 and ZrO2, may be present in the composition,<br>
each up to contents of approximately 2%.<br>
The difference between the temperature corresponding to a viscosity of<br>
1025 poise (decipascal.second), denoted Tl0g2.5, and the liquidus of the<br>
crystallizing phase, denoted Tliq, is preferably at least 10°C for these<br>
compositions. This difference, Tlog2.5- Tliq, defines the "working range" of the<br>
compositions of the invention, that is to say the range of temperatures within<br>
which it is possible to fiberize, most particularly by internal centrifuging. This<br>
difference is preferably at least 20 or 30°C, and even more than 50°C, especially<br>
more than 100°C.<br>
The invention can be carried out in various advantageous ways depending<br>
on the choice of the composition of the alloy.<br>
Nickel, present in the alloy in the form of a solid solution as element for<br>
stabilizing the crystal structure of the cobalt, is used within the usual range of<br>
proportions of about 6 to 12%, advantageously 8 to 10%, by weight of the alloy.<br><br>
Chromium contributes to the intrinsic mechanical strength of the matrix in<br>
which it is partly present in solid solution, but also in the form of carbides,<br>
essentially of the Cr23C6 type, finely dispersed within the grains where they<br>
provide resistance to intragranular creep. It may also contribute to intergranular<br>
reinforcement of the alloy in the form of carbides of the Cr7C3 or Cr23C6 type,<br>
present at the grain boundaries, which prevent grain-over-grain slip. A heat<br>
treatment explained in detail below allows the Cr7C3 carbides to be converted into<br>
Cr23C6 carbides which are more stable at high temperature. Chromium contributes<br>
to the corrosion resistance as precursor of the chromium oxide which forms a<br>
protective layer on the surface exposed to the oxidizing medium. A minimum<br>
amount of chromium is needed to form and maintain this protective layer.<br>
However, too high a chromium content is deleterious to mechanical strength and<br>
to toughness at high temperatures as it results in too high a stiffness and too low<br>
a ductility incompatible with the high-temperature stresses.<br>
In general, the chromium content of an alloy that can be used according to<br>
the invention will be from 23 to 34% by weight, preferably about 26 to 32% by<br>
weight and advantageously around 28 to 30% by weight.<br>
Tantalum is present in solid solution in the cobalt matrix, tantalum being a<br>
heavy atom which locally distorts the crystal lattice and impedes, or even blocks,<br>
the movement of dislocations when the material is subjected to a mechanical load,<br>
thus contributing to the intrinsic strength of the matrix. It is furthermore capable of<br>
forming, with carbon, TaC carbides present firstly as a fine dispersion within the<br>
grains, where they prevent intragranular creep, and secondly at the grain<br>
boundaries, where they provide intergranular reinforcement, possibly<br>
complemented by chromium carbides.<br>
The minimum tantalum content making it possible to achieve the<br>
mechanical strength at very high temperature according to the invention is about<br>
3%, the upper limit possibly being chosen around 10%. The tantalum content is<br>
preferably about 4 to 10%, particularly 4.2 to 10%, very advantageously 4.5 to<br>
10% and more particularly 5 to 10%. The amount of tantalum is more<br>
advantageously about 5.5 to 9%, especially around 6 to 8.5%, by weight.<br>
Carbon is an essential constituent of the alloy, needed to form metal<br>
carbide precipitates.<br><br>
The carbon content directly determines the amount of carbides present in<br>
the alloy. It is at least 0.2% in order to obtain the minimum desired reinforcement,<br>
but is limited to at most 1.2% in order to prevent the alloy from becoming hard and<br>
difficult to machine because of too high a density of reinforcements. The lack of<br>
ductility of the alloy with such contents prevents it from withstanding, without<br>
fracturing, an imposed strain (for example of thermal origin) and from resisting<br>
crack propagation sufficiently.<br>
Advantageously, the carbon content is about 0.3 to 1.1% by weight and<br>
preferably about 0.35 to 1.05% by weight.<br>
According to the invention, the composition of the alloy is adjusted so as to<br>
have a significant amount of tantalum carbides present at the grain boundaries.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the composition of the alloy is such that all the<br>
intergranular carbides are tantalum carbides. This may be achieved by choosing a<br>
tantalum content high enough to shift the carbide formation reactions in favour of<br>
TaC formation.<br>
For this purpose, tantalum and carbon contents are advantageously<br>
chosen so that the Ta/C molar ratio is greater than or equal to 0.9, and is<br>
preferably around 1 to 1.2.<br>
The TaC tantalum carbides are remarkably stable at high temperature<br>
since the inventors have observed, in metallographic sections that the structure of<br>
these carbides is hardly affected by being exposed to a high temperature of about<br>
1300°C. Only a slight "dissolution" of the TaC carbides probably starting from Ta<br>
and C in the matrix can be observed, with no consequence on the mechanical<br>
properties. Thus, an alloy whose intergranular reinforcement consists only of TaC<br>
tantalum carbides guarantees the perpetuity of the reinforcement under extreme<br>
operating conditions at very high temperatures.<br>
The tantalum carbides also contribute to the oxidation resistance of the<br>
alloy under such conditions as, by partially oxidizing into Ta2O5 particles, they<br>
form, at the grain boundaries, clusters which act as plugs, preventing penetration<br>
of the oxidizing medium into the material. The oxidizing medium is maintained at<br>
the surface of the tool, where it would seem the protective chromium oxide layer<br>
retains its good adhesion to the base alloy owing to the formation in the surface<br>
region of the spinner dish of Ta2O5 which favours bonding of Cr2O3 to the alloy.<br><br>
Thus, an effective and lasting reinforcement is obtained, thereby making it<br>
possible to use only a relatively low carbon content which does not impair the<br>
machineability of the material.<br>
In this embodiment, the carbon content is advantageously around 0.3 to<br>
0.55%, preferably around 0.35 to 0.5%, by weight of the alloy.<br>
These quite low carbon contents make it possible to obtain an intergranular<br>
precipitated reinforcement phase which is sufficiently dense, but not continuous,<br>
and is therefore inconducive to crack propagation at the grain boundaries.<br>
In a less preferred embodiment, the alloy composition is such that the<br>
intergranular carbides do not only comprise tantalum carbides, these however<br>
being present in quite a large amount. This may be achieved by choosing a<br>
relatively high carbon content so that the proportion of TaC with respect to all the<br>
intergranular carbides gives the desired amount of tantalum carbide.<br>
For this purpose, it is advantageous to choose the carbon content to be<br>
about 0.8 to 1.2%, preferably about 0.9 to 1.1% and particularly around 0.95 to<br>
1%.<br>
With such carbon contents, the intergranular carbide network is very dense<br>
but does not prove to be prejudicial for use at high temperature, greater than<br>
1150°C. This is because above this temperature some of the M23C6 carbides tend<br>
to dissolve in solid solution so that the intergranular precipitated phase gradually<br>
becomes discontinuous and actively impedes crack propagation.<br>
A tantalum-to-carbon Ta/C molar ratio of less than 0.9 may then be as low<br>
as 0.3, preferably 0.35, the proportion of TaC among all the intergranular carbides<br>
being about 50% by volume, the rest consisting of carbides of the M23C6 type<br>
where M is essentially chromium.<br>
Advantageously, the Ta/C molar ratio is about 0.35 to 0.45.<br>
Despite the presence of M23C6 carbides which are less stable at high<br>
temperature, the intergranular reinforcement remains effective at 1200-1300°C<br>
because of the presence of a sufficient amount of TaC which are intact or oxidized<br>
to Ta2O5. Moreover, the presence of chromium at the grain boundaries constitues<br>
a source of chromium diffusion useful for corrosion resistance.<br>
Tungsten may optionally be present in the alloy of the spinner dish. It is is<br>
then in solid solution in the matrix, where it improves the intrinsic mechanical<br><br>
strength by an effect whereby the cobalt crystal lattice is distorted. It may also<br>
together with chromium help to form intergranular M23C6 carbides (which are then<br>
referred to as (Cr,W)23C6) when the Ta/C molar ratio is less than 0.9.<br>
However, for both the above embodiments, it is apparent that the presence<br>
of tungsten could have a deleterious effect on the mechanical strength of the<br>
alloy.<br>
This is because it has been found that alloys containing tungsten have a<br>
microstructure which reveals the formation of a new intergranular phase<br>
consisting of one of the TCP (Topologically Close Compact) phases - the<br>
σ - CoCr phase - which embrittle the alloy. This phase is formed because of an<br>
excessively high concentration of elements supposed to pass into solution in the<br>
crystallised cobalt. Since the alloys according to the invention are already<br>
characterized by a relatively high proportion of tantalum, the additional presence<br>
of tungsten together with chromium, nickel and carbon would force some of the<br>
elements of the matrix to combine in the grain boundaries or even in the matrix.<br>
Furthermore, it has been possible to show that, after exposing alloys containg<br>
tungsten to very high temperatures of about 1300°C, the local chemical<br>
composition results, in the manner of a eutectic, in grain boundary melting. In the<br>
absence of tungsten, the melting point at the grain boundary would be higher and<br>
this local melting would not be observed at 1300°C; consequently such melting is<br>
not observed and the grain boundaries remain intact even at 1300°C.<br>
Thus, a preferred process according to the invention uses a tungsten-free<br>
alloy or an alloy substantially free of tungsten, it being understood that a minor<br>
amount of tungsten may be tolerated of the order of the amount of traces of a<br>
metallic impurity generally admitted in the metallurgical sense. This alloy is<br>
particularly preferred for very high working temperatures, especially when the<br>
mineral composition enters the spinner dish at a temperature of at least 1150°C,<br>
particularly if the mineral composition has a liquidus temperature of 1140°C or<br>
higher. But this alloy also exhibits interesting mechanical properties at a lower<br>
temperature, of the order of 1000°C in the spinner dish, especially an improved<br>
creep resistance that allows new fiberizing conditions as far as the dimensions of<br>
the spinner dish or the speed of rotation of the dish are concerned. In a very<br>
preferred process, the tungsten-free alloy is exclusively reinforced by tantalum<br><br>
carbide and suffers only a slight modification to the density of intergranular<br>
reinforcement.<br>
The alloy may contain other standard constitutents or inevitable impurities.<br>
In general, it includes:<br>
-	silicon, as a deoxidizer for the molten metal during smelting and casting of<br>
the alloy, in an amount of less than 1% by weight;<br>
-	manganese, which is also a deoxidizer, in amount of less than 0.5 % by<br>
weight;<br>
-	zirconium, for trapping undesirable elements such as sulphur or lead, in<br>
an amount of less then 0.1% by weight;<br>
-	iron, in an amount possibly up to 3% by weight without impairing the<br>
properties of the material;<br>
-	the cumulative amount of the other elements introduced as impurities with<br>
the essential constituents of the alloy ("inevitable impurities") advantageously<br>
represents less than 1 % by weight of the composition of the alloy.<br>
The alloys according to the invention preferably contain no B, Hf, Y, Dy, Re<br>
and other rare earths.<br>
Among the alloys described above, some of them also form the subjects of<br>
the invention.<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt and inevitable impurities and the Ta/C molar ratio<br>
In particular, the subject of the invention is a cobalt-based alloy exhibiting<br>
high-temperature mechanical strength in an oxidizing medium, which also<br>
includes chromium, nickel, tantalum and carbon, characterized in that it does not<br>
contain tungsten and in that it is essentially composed of the following elements<br>
(the proportions being indicated as percentages by weight of the alloy):<br><br>
being at least 0.3, preferably at least 0.35.<br>
This alloy according to the invention is essentially characterized by a high<br>
tantalum content and the absence of tungsten. This makes it possible to form<br>
reinforcing phases which are precipitated or in solid solution, are mainly based on<br>
tantalum and ensure high strength at high temperature.<br>
The chromium, nickel and carbon contents may be chosen to be within the<br>
advantageous ranges indicated above.<br>
The tantalum content is preferably about 4 to 10%, particularly 4.2 to 10%<br>
and very advantageously 4.5 to 10%.<br>
Preferably, the Ta/C molar ratio is greater than or equal to 0.9;<br>
advantageously, it is about 1 to 1.2. The carbon content is therefore<br>
advantageously from 0.3 to 0.55%, preferably around 0.35 to 0.5%, by weight.<br>
As a variant, the carbon content is about 0.8 to 1.2%, preferably 0.9 to 1%<br>
and particularly around 0.95 to 1%. The Ta/C molar ratio is then advantageously<br>
from 0.3 to 0.5, advantageously from 0.35 to 0.45.<br>
These tungsten-free alloys are particularly appreciated for carrying out a<br>
process at high temperature, of at least 1150 to 1200°C, but they can, of course,<br>
be employed in more standard processes for manufacturing mineral wool in which<br>
the spinner dish is heated to a temperature of about 900 to 1100°C.<br>
The subject of the invention is also another cobalt-based alloy which<br>
comprises the following elements:<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt and inevitable impurities and the Ta/C molar ratio<br>
being at least 0.3, preferably about 0.3 to 0.5, advantageously at least 0.35 and in<br>
particular from 0.35 to 0.45.<br><br>
The chromium, nickel, tantalum and carbon contents may be chosen to be<br>
within the advantageous ranges indicated above.<br>
The alloys that can be used according to the invention, when they contain<br>
no highly reactive elements such as B, Hf and rare earths, including Y, Dy, Re,<br>
may be very easily formed by conventional melting and casting using standard<br>
means, especially by inductive melting, in at least partially inert atmosphere, and<br>
casting into a sand mould.<br>
These alloys containing a certain proportion of tungsten are less preferred<br>
than the previous alloys as they make it possible instead to work around 1100 to<br>
1150°C. As previously, they may be used in processes in which the tool is heated<br>
to a temperature of 900 to 1100°C.<br>
After casting, a particular microstructure may advantageously be achieved<br>
by a two-step heat-treatment which makes it possible, in particular, to convert the<br>
M7C3 -type carbides into M23C6 carbides:<br>
-	a solution phase, which comprises annealing at a temperature of 1100 to<br>
1250°C, especially about 1200 to 1250°C, in particular for a time possibly of<br>
between 1 and 4 hours, advantageously about 2 hours; and<br>
-	a carbide precipitation phase, which comprises annealing at a<br>
temperature of 850 to 1050°C, especially about 1000°C, in particular for a time<br>
possibly ranging from 5 to 20 hours, advantageously about 10 hours.<br>
The subject of the invention is also a process for manufacturing, in a<br>
foundry, an article from the alloys described above as subject of the invention,<br>
possibly with the above heat-treatment steps.<br>
The process may include at least one cooling step, after the casting<br>
operation and/or after the first heat-treatment phase, and after the heat treatment.<br>
The intermediate and/or final cooling steps may be carried out for example,<br>
by air cooling, especially with the temperature returning to ambient temperature.<br>
The process may furthermore include a forging step after the casting<br>
operation.<br>
The alloys forming the subject of the invention can be used to manufacture<br>
all kinds of components mechanically stressed at high temperature and/or made<br>
to work in an oxidizing or corrosive environment. The subject of the invention is<br>
also such articles manufactured from an alloy according to the invention,<br><br>
especially by foundrywork.<br>
Among such applications, mention may especially be made of the<br>
manufacture of articles that can be used for the production or hot-conversion of<br>
glass, for example fiberizing spinner dishes for the manufacture of mineral wool.<br>
Although the invention has been principally described within the context of<br>
the manufacture of mineral wool, it can be applied to the glass industry in general<br>
in order to produce furnace, spinneret, or feeder components or accessories,<br>
especially for the production of textile glass yarn and glassware.<br>
Apart from the glass industry, the invention may be applied to the<br>
manufacture of a very wide range of articles when these have to exhibit high<br>
mechanical strength in an oxidizing and/or corrosive environment, particularly at<br>
high temperature.<br>
In general, these alloys can be used to produce any type of fixed or moving<br>
component made of refractory alloy serving in the operation or running of a high-<br>
temperature heat treatment furnace (operating above 1100°C), a heat exchanger<br>
or a reactor for the chemical industry. Thus, they may, for example, be hot fan<br>
blades, firing supports, furnace-charging equipment, etc. They may also be used<br>
to produce any type of resistance heating element intended to operate in a hot<br>
oxidizing atmosphere, and to produce turbine components, used in the engines of<br>
land-based, seagoing or airborne vehicles, or in any other application not aimed<br>
at vehicles, for example in power stations.<br>
Thus, the subject of the invention is the use, in an oxidizing atmosphere at<br>
a temperature of at least 1100°C, of an article made of a cobalt alloy as defined<br>
above.<br>
The invention will be illustrated by the following examples and the Figures<br>
1 to 7 of the appended drawings, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 shows a micrograph of the structure of an alloy according to the<br>
invention;<br>
-	Figure 2 is a graph illustrating the mechanical properties of this alloy;<br>
-	Figures 3 and 4 show micrographs of the structure of a comparative alloy;<br>
-	Figures 5 and 6 are graphs comparing the mechanical properties of<br>
various alloys;<br>
-	Figure 7 shows a micrograph of the structure of another alloy used<br><br>
according to the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Using the technique of inductive melting in an inert atmosphere (especially<br>
argon), a molten charge of the following composition was produced and then<br>
formed by simply casting it into a sand mould:<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt.<br>
The casting operation was followed by a heat treatment comprising a<br>
solution treatment phase for 2 hours at 1200°C and a secondary-carbide<br>
precipitation phase for 10 hours at 1000°C, each of these temperature holds<br>
being concluded by air-cooling down to ambient temperature.<br>
The microstructure of the alloy obtained, revealed by optical or electron<br>
microscopy, using conventional metallographic techniques and possibly X-ray<br>
microanalysis, is composed of a cobalt matrix with a face-centred cubic structure,<br>
stablized by the presence of nickel, including, in solid solution, chromium and<br>
tantalum, with carbide precipitates present within the grains and at the grain<br>
boundaries. This structure can be seen in Figure 1 which shows a view of the<br>
alloy in a scanning electron microscope (SEM) with a magnification of 250 : the<br>
grain boundaries, which do not appear in the micrograph with the magnification<br>
used, have been depicted by the thin lines 1. Within the grains defined by the<br><br>
boundaries 1, the intragranular phase consists of fine secondary carbides 2 of the<br>
Cr23C6 and TaC types, precipitated uniformly in the matrix and appearing in the<br>
form of small specks. At the grain boundaries there is a dense but discontinuous<br>
intergranular phase composed exclusively of tantalum carbides (TaC) 3 which<br>
appear as well-separated islands of generally elongate shape.<br>
This microstructure is due to the tantalum-to-carbon molar ratio in the<br>
composition of the alloy, which is equal to 1.07.<br>
The thermal stability of this microstructure was demonstrated by the<br>
following treatment:<br>
- an alloy specimen having undergone the aforementioned solution and<br>
precipitation heat treatment by annealing, was heated for 5 hours at a<br>
temperature of 1300°C, after which it was quenched in water in order to freeze the<br>
microstructure.<br>
The structure of the specimen was examined in the SEM with a<br>
magnification of 250. This examination showed that the structure of the grain<br>
boundaries had only been slightly affected by the heat treatment: no onset of<br>
melting of the alloy and of the still-numerous TaC carbides was observed.<br>
The high-temperature mechanical strength properties of the alloy were<br>
evaluated in three-point bending creep resistance tests at various temperatures<br>
(1200, 1250, 1300X) under various loads (21 MPa, 31 MPa, 45 MPa). The tests<br>
were carried out on a parallelepipedal test piece 30 mm in width and 3 mm in<br>
thickness, the load being exerted midway between the supports, which were<br>
37 mm apart, subjected to each of the indicated temperatures in succession to the<br>
three loads in increasing order. Another series of measurements was carried out<br>
under a constant load at a variable temperature. The results are illustrated in<br>
Figure 2 which shows, on the same graph, the deformation (in urn,) of the test<br>
piece as a function of time (in hours) for each test. Table 1 gives the slope of the<br>
three-point creep curves at the temperature and stress applied and the time under<br>
load.<br>
The alloy exhibits excellent creep properties at 1200°C and 1250°C and<br>
even appreciable creep resistance at 1300°C under the load applied.<br>
The oxidation resistance properties were evaluated in thermogravimetric<br>
tests at 1200°C: a parabolic oxidation constant Kp of 96 5 x 10-12 g2.cm-4.s-1 and a<br><br>
parabolic evaporation constant Kv of 3.96 / 10-19 g.cm-2s-1 were obtained.<br>
The mechanical strength properties of the alloy at a lower temperature<br>
under high load were evaluated in three-point bending creep resistance tests at<br>
1000°C under a load of 103 MPa, the results of which are reported below in light<br>
of the comparative examples.<br>
The ability of this alloy to be used for constructing a tool for forming molten<br>
glass was evaluated in the application to the manufacture of mineral wool. A<br>
fiberizing spinner dish 200 mm in diameter, of conventional shape, was<br>
manufactured by casting and heat treatment as above, and then used under<br>
industrial conditions for fiberizing a glass of the composition below, the<br>
temperature of the spinner dish being between 1150 and 1210°C :<br><br>
This is a relatively oxidizing glass compared with a conventional glass<br>
because of its high iron content and a redox of 0.15. Its liquidus temperature is<br>
1140°C.<br>
The spinner dish was used with an output of 2.3 metric tons per day until it<br>
was decided to stop it after the spinner dish was deemed to be ruined as<br>
demonstrated by visible damage or by the quality of the fibre produced becoming<br>
not high enough. The temperature of the mineral composition entering the spinner<br>
dish was about 1200 to 1240°C. The temperature of the metal along the profile of<br>
the spinner dish was between 1160 and 1210°C. The lifetime (in hours) of the<br>
spinner dish thus measured was 390 hours.<br>
During the fiberizing trial, the spinner dish was subjected to many heat<br>
shocks, by being stopped and restarted some fifteen times, without any cracks<br>
appearing. This testifies to the good ductility of the alloy at 1100-1200°C.<br>
The long withstand time of the spinner dish is due to the good creep<br>
resistance of the alloy at 1200°C under moderate stress (the mechanical<br>
conditions resulting from the geometry of the spinner dish).<br>
The combination of the alloy of Example 1 and glass rendered less<br><br>
corrosive by the presence of iron made conditions favourable to the manufacure<br>
of mineral wool at very high temperature.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
For comparison purposes, an alloy according to WO-99/16919 was<br>
prepared and tested under the same conditions, the alloy having the following<br>
composition:<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt.<br>
With a Ta/C ratio of 0.51, the microstructure of this alloy, illustrated in<br>
Figure 3, shows the presence at the grain boundaries of about 50% of (Cr,W)23C6<br>
carbides (visible at 4 in the form of thin eutectic areas) and 50% of TaC carbides<br>
(visible at 3).<br>
The thermal stability of the microstructure of this alloy at very high<br>
temperature is poorer than that of Example 1, as illustrated in Figure 4 which<br>
shows the SEM micrograph of a specimen of the alloy of Comparative Example 1<br>
after 5 hours at 1300°C and water-quenching.<br>
It may be seen that the intergranular carbides, including the tantalum<br>
carbides, have disappeared and that liquid (melted) regions 5 appeared at<br>
1300°C, which resolidified upon quenching.<br>
By creep strength tests, it was verified that the mechanical strength of the<br>
comparative alloy at high temperature is less than that of the alloy of Example 1.<br>
These results are collected in the graph in Figure 5 which shows compared<br>
results of creep resistance at 1200°C under 31 MPa, in the graph of Figure 6<br><br>
which shows compared results of creep resistance at 1000°C under 103 MPa and<br>
in Table 1.<br>
The 1200°C oxidation resistance properties evaluated by thermogravimetric<br>
analysis are: Kp = 92.4.10-12 g2cm-4.s-1 and Kv = 4.86.10-9 g.cm-2.s-1.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
Figures 5 and 6 and Table 1 also show the high-temperature mechanical<br>
properties of another comparative alloy of a different type: this is an ODS-type<br>
super alloy which has a matrix consisting of nickel-chromium and is reinforced by<br>
an oxide phase, such as yttrium oxide.<br>
These very high-performance alloys cannot be obtained by casting but by<br>
the tricky technique of powder metallurgy, by producing a mechanical alloy by<br>
mechanical synthesis of metal and ceramic powders, sintering under pressure,<br>
complex thermo-mechanical working and heat treatment at very high temperature,<br>
with consequently a very high manufacturing cost.<br>
The grade tested in Comparative Example 2 is MA 758 from Special<br>
Metals.<br>
It should be noted that the ODS alloy of Comparative Example 2 has a<br>
much better creep resistance than the cobalt alloy of Comparative Example 1: the<br>
slope of the creep curve at 1200°C is fifteen times greater in the case of the<br>
cobalt-based comparative alloy.<br>
The alloy of Example 1 remains inferior to the ODS alloy, having a creep<br>
curve slope at 1200°C two to three times greater, but this constitutes a<br>
considerable improvement over the alloy of Comparative Example 1.<br>
A similar difference in the behaviours at 1000°C is observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Another alloy according to the invention was prepared as in Example 1 and<br>
its properties were evaluated in the same way, the said alloy having the following<br>
composition:<br><br><br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt.<br>
Its microstructure is similar to that of the alloy of Example 1, with an<br>
intergranular phase consisting exclusively of tantalum carbides TaC (Ta/C molar<br>
ratio = 1.13).<br>
The results of the mechanical strength tests are given in Figure 5 and in<br>
Table 1.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Another alloy according to the invention was prepared as in Example 1 and<br>
its properties were evaluated in the same way, the said alloy having the following<br>
composition:<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt.<br>
Its microstructure differs from those of the alloys of Examples 1 and 2 by<br>
the presence, at the grain boundaries, in addition to the same amount of tantalum<br>
carbides, of Cr23C6 chromium carbides. The high carbon content produces a high<br><br>
density of carbides in which the distribution is about 50% Cr23C6 for 50% TaC ,<br>
because the Ta/C molar ratio is equal to 0.39.<br>
The results of the mechanical strength tests are given in Figure 5 and in<br>
Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Another alloy, containing tungsten, was used, this having the following<br>
composition:<br><br>
the balance consisting of cobalt.<br>
Its microstructure, illustrated in Figure 7, showing a view obtained in a<br>
scanning electron microscope, reveals quite a dense intergranular network of<br>
eutectic tantalum carbides (TaC) 6 with the cobalt solid solution. When the<br>
microstructure is observed in optical microscopy, after suitable metallographic<br>
etching, it seems that there are different types of MC carbides present, probably<br>
due to tungsten contributing to the formation of these carbides.<br>
The microstructure clearly shows a phase 7 in the form of dispersed<br>
compact areas rich in cobalt and in chromium in almost equal parts, which consist<br>
of one of the TCP (Topologically Close Compact) phases - the σ-CoCr phase<br>
known to embrittle the alloy.<br>
These phases do not appear in the microstructure of the alloy of Example 1<br>
although very similar in composition if tungsten is absent. In this Example 4, the<br>
presence of 5.6% tungsten adding to the 28% chromium, 8% nickel and 6%<br>
tantalum seems to make the overall content of elements passing into solid<br>
solution exceed a kind of solubility limit.<br>
The oxidation resistance at 1200°C of this alloy was evaluated by<br>
thermogravimetric analysis: The values obtained were Kp=190.10-12 g2.cm-4.s-1<br>
and Kv = 4.17.10-9g.cm-2.s-1.<br><br>
In a 3-point bending creep resistance test at 1200°C under a load of<br>
31 MPa, this alloy had a creep rate of about 7 to 8 µm.h-1, this being slightly less<br>
good than the alloys of Examples 1 to 3 but a marked improvement over the alloy<br><br><br>
