				<td>BI-CENTRIC HIP SYSTEM<br>
IS A HIGHLY VERSATILE SYSTEM TO SATISFY PATIENTS SURGICAL AND NURSING NEEDS<br>
CLINICAL INDICATIONS PRIMARY<br>
Fractures of the proximal femur. Non-unions of proximal femoral fractures. Aseptic necrosis of the femoral head™<br>
SECONDARY<br>
Qsteo,, rheumatoid, and post-traumatic arthritis of the hip with minimal distortion of the acetabulum.<br>
Salvage of failed total hip arthroplasty,<br>
which will be used to marry the cup and the ball. Another jig will be used to un-match them if it. is needed.<br>
The greatest advantage of this system is that after serving for a couple of years in the human body when the system fails usually the cup compo-nent then it can be converted into total hip by reoperating. In the second surgery the cup will be dismantled and thrown out instead a new cup of the total hip system will be fitted into the ascetabu-lum with the help of cement, and the already exist-ing prosthesis with 22mm diameter head will be married to the new cup, thus reducing the time of surgery as well as the cost to a great extent.<br>
The presently designed system has got certain advantages over the already existing bipolar hip prostheses,<br>
The two component of the bipolar already  existing are not dismantable.<br>
The seating angle of the prosthesis is unac-ceptably low so, the surgeon have to cut a lot of calcarbone which is so disadvantageous to the patient as far as the long term results are con-cerned .<br>
The long term results are not good because of the stiffness that develops probably due to abnor-mally high stress generated at. the acetabular<br>
cartliage and the metallic cup level as well as the<br>
metallic head and the polyethylene cup.<br>
The  inner  ball of  the  presently  existing<br>
bipolar has got a diameter of 28mm which is diffi¬cult to marry with the commonly existing cup of the total hip system which has got a 22.5mm inner diameter.<br>
The present existing bipolar system cannot be converted into a total hip system.<br>
Brief description of the accompanying drawings:<br>
Fig 1 represents the right hand side view of the Bi-Centric Hip device.<br>
Fig 2 represents the front view of the Bi-Centric Hip device.<br>
Fig 3 represents the view of the Disarticulating Jig<br>
Fig 4 represents the view of the Articulating jig.<br>
Fig 5 represents the view of the hollow hemispherical cup.<br>
Accordingly the present invention describes about A Bi-centric hip device comprising<br>
(a)	A stem portion (endoprosthesis) having a distal end (1) of a predetermined<br>
length which is straight and an opposed proximal end(2) which is<br>
arcuately shaped; the said proximal end (2) having a collar portion (3);<br>
said collar portion having a neck of reducing diameter; a head portion (4)<br>
which is an extension of the said neck portion; the said head portion being<br>
in the shape of a spheroid having a predetermined diameter; the said collar<br>
[portion having a groove of a predetermined radius for inserting the said<br>
stem into the hollow bone structure by way of slight hammering; the said<br>
arcuated potion (2) having at least two through  holes of predetermined<br>
radius at predetermined positions for removing the said stem from the<br>
hollow bone structure; the said proximal end (2) being so arcuated such<br>
that the angle formed between the straight distal end(l) of the stem and the<br>
opposed proximal end(2) is about 138° and the angle between the collar<br>
(3) and the straight distal end(l) is about 40° -50° preferably 45°;<br>
(b)	A bi-centric hemispherical hollow cup (6) having a predetermined<br>
diameter   and   predetermined   thickness;   the   inner   portion   of  the<br>
hemispherical hollow cup having a layer of a suitable material of a<br>
predetermined thickness; the said layer(5) being arcuately shaped so that<br>
the resulting obstruction between the said layer and the portion between<br>
the said neck and head portion is minimal; the said cup being adapted to<br>
be inserted on to the head portion (4) of the stem in a manner wherein the<br>
center of the said head portion (4) and the center of the said hollow cup(6)<br>
is offset by about 2mm providing greater movement of the said head<br>
portion(4) in the said cup (6) as compared to the movement of the hollow<br>
cup(6) itself.<br>
Accordingly the present invention also describes about a disarticulating jig for dismantling the bi-centric hip device comprising a rod portion (8) of a predetermined length; an arcuated frame portion (11) shaped to accommodate the head portion of the said stem; a threaded spindle (10) attached to a screw (9); the said spindle having soft pads (12) wherein the said frame portion (11) is adjusted over the head portion of the stem and the spindle is moved through screw(9) to hold the said head portion.<br>
Also the present invention describes about an articulating Jig for fixing the Bi-centric hip device comprising two leg portions (14,15) having a straight distal end(17) and proximal ends(18, 19) which are arcuately shaped; the said legs (14, 15) being pivoted at a point (16) closer to the proximal end; the said proximal end (18,19) being so shaped so as to properly hold the Bi-Centric hip device on the soft pads(12).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I claim<br>
1.    A Bi-centric hip device comprising<br>
a)	A stem portion (endoprosthesis) having a distal end (1) of a predetermined length which is straight<br>

portion (3); said collar portion having a neck of reducing diameter; a head portion (4) which is an<br>
extension of the said neck portion; the said head portion being in the shape of a spheroid having a<br>
predetermined diameter and set collar portion having a groove of a predetermined radius for inserting<br>
the said stem into the hollow bone structure by way of slight hammering; the said arcuated potion (2)<br>
having at least two thorough holes of predetermined radius at predetermined position for removing the<br>
said stem from the hollow bone structure; the said proximal end (2) being so arcuated  such that the<br>
angel formed between the straight distal end(l) of the steam and the opposed proximal end(2) is about<br>
138° and the angle between the collar (3) and the straight distal end(l) is about 40°- 50° preferably 45°<br>

between the said layer and the portion between the said neck and head portion is minimal; the said cup<br>
being adapted to be inserted on to the head portion (4) of the stem in a manner wherein the center of<br>
the said head portion (4) and the center of the said hollow cup(6) is offset by about 2mm providing<br>
