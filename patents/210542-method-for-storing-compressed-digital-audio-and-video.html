METHOD FOR STORING COMPRESSED DIGFTAL AUDIO AND VIDEO<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method as recited in the preamble of Claim 1. Classical video recording allows trick modes such as fast forward and fast reverse. Trick modes have become more complex to implement for digital video that is compressed on the basis of groups of pictures (GOP), because uniform video intervals may correspond to data packet sequences of non-uniform lengths, depending on the information content of the video. US Patent 5,701,386 allows fast forward and fast reverse by providing each Group of Pictures with a GOP header and each sequence of GOPs with sequence headers both before its first GOP and also before its last GOP, Hereinafter, the term "picture" will be used consistently. Depending on the actual video standard, the term "picture" may include "frame" as well as "field". However, modem digital broadcast, in particular via satellite, uses Transport Streams (TS) according to system layer standard ISO/IEC 13818-1 for transmitting multi-channel audio and/or video. The video layer standard may be H262 or ISO/DEC 13818-2, the audio layer standard ISO/nEC 13818-3. These features are used inter alia for DVB and are intended for linear play without feedback from a decoder. Packets arrive at a receiver one by one and their assignment to a particular program is generally not known, before the packet itself will have arrived: indeed, assignment is through PSI-tables. For storage, one or more specific programs are selected from a received Transport Stream. This will necessitate either at storing time or at replay time the adapting of cenain stream parameters for retaining a valid Transport Stream for replay.<br>
Replay systems will generally support jumping over a selectable physical storage distance, but the probability of then hitting an entry point to the actually stored program is low. The fmding of such entry points will necessitate repeated and time intensive searches, which may cause buffer underflow. It also becomes nearly impossible to replay the stream at an n times higher speed with n integer, as well as to land immediately on a video fragment that may be played independently. Therefore, if storage takes place on a dedicated apparatus, the locations of the entry points must be immediately known, either directly, or via pointers. The problem becomes more severe if a plurality of program must be stored.<br><br>
SUMMARY TO THE INVENTION<br>
In consequence, amongst other things, it is an object of the present invention to format stored video in such manner that various trick modes will become feasible for a Transport Stream environment, whilst maintaining the data handling facilities proper to this environment.<br>
Now therefore, according to one of its aspects the invention is characterized according to the characterizing part of Claim L The invention also relates to a method for replaying such recorded Transport Stream and to a device arranged for practising the invention. Further advantageous aspects of the invention are recited in dependent Claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
These and further aspects and advantages of the invention will be discussed more in detail hereinafter with reference to the disclosure of preferred embodiments, and in particular with reference to the appended Figures that show:<br>
Figure 1, a block diagram of a recording organization;<br>
Figure 2, a diagram of a Transport Stream structure;<br>
Figure 3, a diagram of the stored data structure;<br>
Figure 4, a block diagram of a replaying organization;<br>
Figure 5, packaging a Transport Stream;<br>
Figure 6, unpackaging a Transport Stream.<br>
STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION OF A RELEVANT ENVIRONMENT<br>
According to their agreed upon format. Transport Stream Packets start with a Transport Stream packet header, which contains a Packet IDentifier PID. Through the Program Specific Information PSI tables, the data content m a TS packet will be known. The PID for the video data V_PID of each transmitted program is stored in the PSI tables in the Transport Stream. A variable payloadunitstartindicator pusi is stored in the Transport Stream packet header and mdicates whether the payload of the packet in question starts indeed with the first byte of a Packetized Elementary Stream PES packet (ISO/IEC standards supra). Finally, the adaptation_fieid__coiitrol (afc) indicates whether the Transport Stream packet contains mdeed an adaptation field and/or a payload.<br>
To set a pointer, the system usually only needs to access packets that have PID=V_PID, pusi=l and an afc that is either equal to 1 or equal to 3. If the table would be<br><br>
too long for a single 188 byte packet, two or more contiguous packets with PID=V_PID must be accessed. Only packets so signalled need be checked for presence of an entry point. Entry points may be as follows:<br>
•	a TS packet with the start of an I-picture;<br>
•	a TS packet with the start of a GOP;<br>
•	a TS packet with the start of a sequence header.<br>
The pointers may be transiently stored in RAM memory and evenmally written to disc. A program with a video take length of 135 minutes with 25 pictures per second, a 12-picture GOP size and a pointer length of 4 bytes, will produce about 0.54 Mbit or 67 kByte pointer information. At a 16 Mbaud transfer speed, writing all pointers this will need about 35 millisecs, provided they get a separate disc area. If RAM is too small, the pointers must be written earlier. The pointers may be kept within the stored stream, such as by storing them when reaching a certain number such as 1000 selected packets. At replay, pointer positions will then be known immediately. Alternatively, a table of pointer locations may be used. If the pointers are kept on a separate location, they may be written either after a certain time interval, or at instants when actual bitrate is low, or anyway before reaching buffer storage capacity.<br>
The following further information may be stored with the pointers to facilitate the replay of a stored program:<br>
•	the length in seconds of the video at recording time to calculating the remaining time;<br>
•	size of the GOPs, and if applicable, the characterization of the GOPs as being closed or non-closed, such as according to MPEG-standard, and whether their sizes are uniform or not;<br>
•	the PED of packets containing the Program Map Table PMT;<br>
•	the PID of packets storing the Program Clock Reference PCR;<br>
•	the PID of packets with video information;<br><br>
•	Start Time Code that may be used to calculate elapsed time;<br>
•	Frame Rate that in combination with a uniform GOP size may be used to jump to a particular instant in time;<br>
•	the total number of TS packages which may be used to calculate the end of the program in question;<br>
•	the overall numbers of I-, B- and P-pictures;<br>
•	the total number of I-pictures;<br><br>
• average bitrate.<br>
The use of Pointers may support replaying of a panicular program at higher speed. Transport Stream conditions should be maintained by avoiding referencing non-existent picmres. Further, certain fields may have to be adapted.<br>
Trick play is facilitated by forwarding to a decoder only TS packets that contain video information, inclusive of SI information and PCR packets. Faster play of sound is generally not useful. The storing of extra information will allow to select for forwarding exclusively those packets that have a PID corresponding to that of PAT, PMT, PCR, and V_PID. The GOP size mformation may be used for in a "non-closed" GOP enviromnent, during replay of complete GOP's, selectably bypassing a particular B-picture, and possibly to adapt temporal references in odier packages. The video duration at recording time may be used, in combination with the time code stored in the GOP header to calculate and display elapsed time. The combination of frame rate and a fixed GOP size allows to periodically replay exactly a specified number of seconds, and to subsequently jump n times the earlier number, where n may have values such as in the range 1-100. An extra advantage of pointer-supported storage is that a program need to be stored only once. The described organization supports the recording of a plurality of programs in parallel in the secondary Transport Stream in an interleaved manner. In that case, each program will need its associated array of pointers.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram of an exemplary recording organization. Input 20 receives a Transpon Stream. In block 22, selection of the required TS packets and time stamp insertion take place, followed by storing in Stream Info Memory 24. In block 26, the selected TS packets are counted, and the count acmally attained is forwarded to Pointer Info Memory 28. In block 32, entry points are extracted, and counted in block 30: the count is forwarded both to Pointer Info Memory 28 and to Stream Info Memory 36 that is m fact the same as block 24. In block 34, the Time Code is retrieved from the GOP header and if its value is zero, any necessary modification may be effected. In block 38, the Start Time Code is extracted for forwarding to the Stream Info Memory. In block 40, the GOP size and Picture Rate informations are extracted and forwarded to Stream Info Memory, now block 50. In block 42, the Closed GOP Indicator is extracted, in block 44 the PCR__PID, in block 46 the PMT PID, and in block 48 the video PID, all for forwarding to the Stream Info<br><br>
Memory 50. The information on output 49 is ready for being stored. The Figure does not specify the mapping of various partial functionalities on proper hardware, which may be realized as conventional mechanisms that have not been shown for brevity.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatical embodiment of the Transpon Stream structure. Here, the uppermost level shows the sequence of Transport Stream Packets that each contain 188 bytes. On the next level a packet consists of a 4-Byte header that accommodates at least the informations PID, pusi and afc. The remainder is the TS-packet data. On the third level the data field may contain an adaptation field and/or a payload field that are sized according to need, and may be internally specified through the afc information.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagram of the stored data structure. Block 64 symbolizes the stream information formed by TS packets containing all information that has been selected on the basis of the information stream received on input 22 in Figure 1. Block 62 symbolizes the pointer information that has been produced by blocks 26, 30, 32 in Figure 1. Block 60 symbolizes the stream information produced by the various blocks in Figure 1, such as in particular blocks 22, 30, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46 and 48. Now, first the informations from blocks 60 and 62 are combined for contiguous storage. Next, the compound so formed, as well as the informations from block 64 are stored on the medium. The latter informations may be stored in physically distant locations from the former: the linking is through the file system. The overall information is collectively stored on disc in a format that may be configured along the exemplary teachings of Figure 2. During a program, TS packets will be written continually. Pointer and stream informations are being written either after termination of the video take, or in relatively small-sized amounts during the video take.<br>
Figure 4 is a block diagram of an exemplary replaying organization. Item 70 represents the rewritable storage disc together with its associated electromechanical, electro-optical and electronic components for driving and information accessing, mclusive of demodulation, error correction and similar features that operate on a relatively lower organizational level than the present invention. Block 72 executes demultiplexing into three sub-streams. Block 74 symbolizes the Pointer Info Memory substream. Block 76 symbolizes the Stream Info Memory substream. These two streams are forwarded to control unit 80 that may execute the following user control functions:<br>
•	setting the disc replay velocity, such as l.-.n times normal speed;<br>
•	optionally, setting the minimum play duration before effecting a jump; here, various possibilities exist, such as play n GOPS before a jump, jump speed xn GOPs, or: play an I-<br><br>
picture, repeat n times, then jump to the next I-picture, etcetera;<br>
•	if a plurality of programs had been stored: program select;<br>
•	setting the video start position where to start playing the program in question from;<br>
•	play/record;<br>
•	stop;<br>
•	goto a specified point in time;<br>
•	fast forward &amp; fast reverse.<br>
Control functions are for example as follows:<br>
•	display actually elapsed time from the start of the program that is being read out;<br>
•	retrieving pointer and stream information from disc;<br>
•	control goto operations to specific byte positions such as to access an entry point;<br>
•	play as starting from a specified physical location;<br>
•	record unto a specified physical location.<br>
The control unit may forward signals so developed along control lines 92, 94, 96, 98 to various subsystems to be identified hereinafter. First, the disc-oriented subsystem 70 is controlled along line 92. The Transport Stream demultiplexed from block 72 is forwarded to block 82 for extracting of the time code. Block 84 detects whether the indicator Closed-GOP is false (?^1) and play n GOPs, replace first B-picture packets with null packets. Furthermore, block 84 detects whether the indicator Closed-GOP is false (?£l), or play I-pictures only, update continuity counter in the TS packet header, update temporal reference in picture header, and set broken link in GOP header to 1, the latter dependhig on the decoder type.<br>
Block 86 detects whether replay speed 7^1, and in the positive case replaces all TS packets, except Video PID packets, PCR PID packets, PMT PID packets and PAT PID(0) packets with null packets. Furthermore, Presentation Tune Stamp, Decoding Time Stamp, and PCR numbers are modified to reflect the correct presentation and decoding times.<br>
Block 88 detects whether there are timestamps or not; in the positive case, the Time Base is reconstructed and the Time Stamps removed. Output 90 will present an amended Transport Stream according to the MPEG-2 standard. For brevity, the Figure does not specify mapping various partial functionalities on hardware.<br>
A particular aspect of a Transport Stream is that all TS packets will start with a TS Header that contains a PID.<br><br>
Figure 5 illustrates the packaging of a Transport Stream. At left, both video data and audio data arrive at their respective encoders 110 and 112. Both encoders then feed respective packetizers 112 and 116, respectively to produce a stream of video PES and a stream of audio PES. In multiplexer 118, the two streams are multiplexed to constimte an input Transport Stream that is ready for storage.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates unpackaging a Transport Stream. At left, a compound Transport Stream enters a demultiplexer annex decoder 120, that will separate video from audio. Block 126 is furthermore operative for clock extraction, and synchronizes video decoder blocks 122 and audio decoder block 124. The decoded video and audio informations are then available for consumer replay.<br>
Various relevant aspects of the invention are as follows:<br>
•	The elapsed time indicator may be retrieved from the GOP-header and the Start Time Code and is independent from bitrate and GOP-size;<br>
•	Fast forward and fast reverse are feasible at any speed, even if a single disc contains more programs in a physically, but not logically intermixed manner;<br>
•	Both the pointer table and the TS information may be stored on an arbitrary disc location. There is some kind of Table Of Contents that for all programs contains starting locations of the TS packets/program, of the pointer tables and of the TS information tables.<br>
•	Trick play requires no extra regrouping or reformatting of the picmre sequences;<br>
•	External as well as an internal decoders may be used;<br>
•	No explicit sector argument needed for TS-packets containing an entry point;<br>
•	Data need not be stored in a physically contiguous manner;<br>
•	Interleaved storage of audio, video and other data is allowed;<br>
•	The invention allows all GOP-sizes, even non-uniform GOP-sizes.<br><br><br><br><br>
