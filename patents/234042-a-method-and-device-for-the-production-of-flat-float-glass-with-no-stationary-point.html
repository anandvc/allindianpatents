				<td>FLAT FLOAT GLASS WITH NO STATIONARY POINT<br>
The invention concerns the production of flat float<br>
glass, and particularly of fiat glass-ceramic.<br>
Glass-ceramics are materials rich in silica comprising<br>
at least one crystalline phase and obtained after a<br>
ceramization heat treatment from a precursor glass (or<br>
mother-glass). Glass-ceramics have a very low<br>
coefficient of linear expansion, usually less than<br>
15xl0-7 Glass-ceramics may comprise at least 50%<br>
silica by mass. An important family of glass-ceramic is<br>
that comprising both and Li20 for which the<br>
ceramization process leads to crystals of beta-<br>
eucryptite or beta-spodumene or beta-quartz.<br>
These glass-ceramics, which may be translucent or<br>
opaque, find a use particularly as hob plates or fire-<br>
resistant plates, and more generally in uses requiring<br>
a glass with a very low coefficient of expansion.<br>
Glass-ceramics however have the disadvantage of having<br>
a strong tendency to devitrify when hot, which usually<br>
leads to many maintenance operations on the forming<br>
installations. Specifically, the plates or sheets of<br>
glass-ceramics are usually made by rolling between<br>
metal rolls and devitrification deposits damage the<br>
surface of the said rolls. The latter must therefore be<br>
periodically rectified (even every two to three days)<br>
or even replaced. The glass-ceramic forming<br>
installations are therefore usually designed to make<br>
maintenance operations easy, which involves a high<br>
degree of accessibility to the rolls, even during<br>
production. It is thus unthinkable for those skilled in<br>
the art to form glass-ceramics in gigantic<br>
installations whose core remains inaccessible during<br>
operation as is the case with float glass<br>
installations. Specifically, these installations are<br>
several tens of metres or even several hundreds of<br>
metres long and several metres wide and the transition<br>
times to start-up or to shut-down are considerable.<br>
Such installations must therefore operate non-stop and<br>
a shut-down for maintenance is catastrophic and ruled<br>
out. The conventional installations for forming glass-<br>
ceramics by rolling between rolls also do not allow the<br>
production of very large sheets. The width is limited<br>
to less than 700 mm. There is however a need today for<br>
plates of greater widths. Similarly, this rolling<br>
process cannot be used to produce very thin sheets of<br>
less than 3 mm.<br>
The applicant has effectively been able to ascertain<br>
that the floating of a glass-ceramic could not be<br>
achieved in the usual manner for a conventional glass<br>
of the soda-lime-silica type. Specifically, a<br>
devitrification always occurs in the zone where the<br>
glass is cast onto the metal float bath. Remember that,<br>
in the production of a ribbon of float glass, to<br>
produce sheets of flat glass, molten glass is poured<br>
onto a bath of molten metal, usually of tin or of a<br>
predominantly tin alloy, where it forms the said<br>
continuous ribbon which cools progressively and is<br>
extracted with the aid of extractor rollers which take<br>
it to an annealing furnace called a lehr. The zone<br>
covering the ribbon of glass when it runs onto the<br>
float bath is encumbered with heating systems and<br>
cooling systems which are provided to condition the<br>
temperature and more precisely the viscosity of the<br>
glass so that it can be drawn to the required thickness<br>
and then set.<br>
The central zone of the molten floated material<br>
situated on the longitudinal axis of the float and the<br>
furthest upstream on the float bath is in fact a zone<br>
where the speed of the floated material is low or zero.<br>
This type of zone appears to promote devitrification,<br>
in particular when glass-ceramic is involved. The<br>
devitrification causes the formation of crystals<br>
accumulating in the same location and requiring the<br>
shut-down of production.<br>
Accordinq to the invention, this problem is remedied by<br>
conceiving a float installation devoid of any<br>
stationary points for the molten floated material. The<br>
speed of the molten floated material is therefore not<br>
zero at any of its points.<br>
US3843345 teaches the floating of a conventional glass<br>
on a float bath, but without a pouring (or fall) of the<br>
glass. At the location where the glass passes over the<br>
metal, there is a glass/metal/refractory triple point<br>
(in fact a line) which is necessarily stationary. In<br>
addition, the speed of the glass at the edges seems to<br>
be zero. This device is therefore not suitable for<br>
glass-ceramic precursor glass.<br>
US3684475 teaches the passing of a ribbon of rolled<br>
glass on a float bath. It therefore does not involve a<br>
pouring of molten glass. Such rolling at these very<br>
high temperatures does not make it possible to obtain<br>
wide and/or thick sheets of glass.<br>
US2002/0023463 teaches a particular composition of<br>
glass-ceramic capable of being floated without surface<br>
crystallization.<br>
The abstract of JP2000281365 teaches the recirculation<br>
of the tin from downstream to upstream via the edges of<br>
the float bath of a float enclosure.<br>
Other documents that may be mentioned are US3539320,<br>
US4115091 and US3718450.<br>
According to the invention, use can be made of a<br>
conventional float installation normally procuring a<br>
point or a zone of low speed or zero speed glass at the<br>
location where the precursor glass is poured, but while<br>
arranging the casting also of a molten metal at this<br>
location in order to remove any stationary point for<br>
the glass. The casting of the molten metal is arranged<br>
so as to constitute a zone in motion for the glass.<br>
Molten, metal is introduced at the float points which<br>
would be fixed for the glass if there were no<br>
introduction. This molte'n metal is preferably of the<br>
same kind as that of the float bath and will mix with<br>
it. This casting of molten metal draws along the molten<br>
material in that critical zone and prevents it from<br>
being stationary. Thus, all the molten glass material<br>
introduced into the float installation is drawn along<br>
toward the outlet of the latter, without stagnation at<br>
any location, and therefore without devitrification at<br>
any location, which is particularly advantageous when<br>
the requirement is to produce glass-ceramic The<br>
casting of the molten metal intended to prevent the<br>
stationary points is carried out in a symmetrical<br>
manner relative to the longitudinal axis of the float<br>
installation so as not to disrupt the pouring symmetry<br>
of the glass relative to this axis. This casting is<br>
preferably carried out over a certain width<br>
corresponding for example to at least 50% of the width<br>
of the glass spout lip, even at least 80% of the width<br>
of the glass spout lip. It may therefore involve a<br>
veritable curtain or cascade over a large width of the<br>
installation. Preferably, the metal is poured so as not<br>
to cause turbulence in the float bath. Thus, it is<br>
preferable to pour it onto an inclined plane of<br>
refractory material (for example made of sillimanite),<br>
the said inclined plane ending at the float bath. In<br>
this manner, the metal is poured gently into the bath.<br>
According to one embodiment, to avoid the excess of<br>
molten metal due to the casting of metal at the head of<br>
the installation, molten metal is tapped from at least<br>
one point further downstream of the same float bath.<br>
Advantageously, it is at least in part this same tapped<br>
metal that is cast at the head of the bath. In this<br>
case, the metal circulates in fact at least partially<br>
in a loop from upstream to downstream and vice-versa.<br>
This recirculation may also serve to limit, or even<br>
prevent, the natural recirculations inside the bath<br>
that can disrupt the forming. Preferably, the molten<br>
metal is tapped off and reintroduced in a symmetrical<br>
manner relative to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
installation, so as not to disrupt the symmetrical<br>
operation of the assembly. Thus, if metal is tapped<br>
from one side downstream of the installation, metal is<br>
also tapped and at the same rate from the other side of<br>
the installation and at the location symmetrical to the<br>
first relative to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
installation. In this case, it can be the said that<br>
molten metal is being tapped on the lateral portions of<br>
the float bath and in a symmetrical manner relative to<br>
the longitudinal axis. The same applies for the<br>
reintroduction, it being understood that usually this<br>
is carried out via a duct whose axis is on the<br>
longitudinal axis of the installation and pours metal<br>
at least at the point furthest upstream of the glass<br>
and on the longitudinal axis. As has already been the<br>
said, this metal pouring duct is preferably fairly wide<br>
relative to the width of the float bath at this<br>
location. This symmetry of the molten metal circulation<br>
system can be assured by the use of calibrated pumps.<br>
The flow rate of these pumps may usually be adjusted by<br>
an air pressure which is supplied to them. An<br>
adjustment is sought that ensures a symmetry of the<br>
temperatures and a pulse-free drawing of the glass<br>
sheet.<br>
According to the invention, molten metal is introduced<br>
continuously at the glass float point furthest upstream<br>
and situated on the longitudinal axis of the bath. This<br>
introduced molten metal may in particular originate at<br>
least partially from a tapping point of the same bath<br>
situated further downstream.<br>
The flow rate of metal poured upstream depends on the<br>
size of the installation. The flow rate of metal is<br>
sufficient to prevent the formation of a stationary<br>
point for the glass. The flow rate at this point<br>
furthest upstream usually lies between 0.05 and<br>
5 litres per second.<br>
In one embodiment, the vitreous composition spread out<br>
on the float bath is a glass-ceramic precursor glass.<br>
The particular structure of glass-ceramic is achieved<br>
by a specific heat treatment (called ceramization)<br>
after the forming in sheet/plate form and even usually<br>
after the longitudinal and transversal cutting of the<br>
floated ribbon. This glass-ceramic precursor glass may<br>
also be called "mother" glass. For simplicity, it may<br>
simply be called "glass" in the context of the present<br>
application.<br>
The invention relates to a method for the production of<br>
a ribbon of float glass, particularly a glass-ceramic<br>
precursor, in which the ribbon, formed on a float bath,<br>
floats along on this bath, this ribbon being removed<br>
from the bath when it has sufficiently solidified. The<br>
invention is used for the production of varied<br>
thicknesses of glass and relates more specifically to<br>
the production of a thin ribbon, and particularly<br>
thinner than 3 mm.<br>
More specifically, the invention relates to a method<br>
for the production of flat glass comprising the<br>
continuous floating of a molten glass on a float bath<br>
in a float installation, the said floated glass<br>
progressively forming a ribbon running on the said<br>
float bath without having any stationary point in the<br>
installation.<br>
The thickness of the ribbon is determined by the<br>
traction force exerted on it on the one hand by the<br>
extractor rollers and where necessary on the other hand<br>
by the action of knurled "top rolls" which act on the<br>
top edges of the ribbon. Specifically, for a given<br>
drawing, that is to say for a quantity of glass coming<br>
out of the furnace per given unit of time, the<br>
thickness of the ribbon of float glass is a function of<br>
the speed of the said ribbon in the lehr and of the<br>
width of the latter.<br>
At the moment when the glass is poured on the metal, at<br>
the entrance of the float enclosure, the glass is<br>
sufficiently fluid to spread on the metal surface under<br>
the effect of its own weight. Advantageously, the<br>
temperature at this location is such that the dynamic<br>
viscosity of the glass lies between 3 and 4.5 poise.<br>
For a glass-ceramic precursor glass, the temperature of<br>
the glass, at this location, usually lies between 1300<br>
and 1450°C.<br>
While the ribbon of glass is running on the float bath,<br>
the said ribbon will therefore be drawn, out to reduce<br>
its thickness. This drawing process is usually obtained<br>
for outputs of between 500 and 600 tonnes per day with<br>
ribbon speeds lying between 15 and 30 metres per<br>
minute, for conventional thicknesses of the order of 2<br>
to 5 mm. Such outputs and speeds of the glass ribbon<br>
running on the float bath furthermore cause, under the<br>
said ribbon, a current of tin directed towards the<br>
colder outlet end of the bath; this may be called a<br>
downstream current. The metal carried along by the<br>
ribbon on this downstream current hits the outlet wall<br>
of the bath and then by reflection tends to form a<br>
return current directed towards the upstream portion of<br>
the bath; this may be called an upstream current. This<br>
upstream current may be particularly strong between the<br>
edges of the ribbon of glass and the side walls of the<br>
bath. This cooler upstream current mixes with the<br>
downstream current causing disruptions such as<br>
turbulence and injects metal at a temperature lower<br>
than that of the metal of the downstream current. Then,<br>
particularly along the transverse zones, high<br>
temperature variations appear particularly in the<br>
drawing zone where the glass is particularly sensitive<br>
to these temperature variations. These temperature<br>
differences are particularly harmful because they<br>
locally change the viscosity of the glass and so the<br>
drawing may not be homogeneous. This results in<br>
deformations of the glass ribbon and also a lateral<br>
instability of the said glass ribbon which moves<br>
periodically from one side to the other of the bath.<br>
Such an instability may in particular disrupt the<br>
temperatures at the lehr and so have a harmful effect<br>
on the annealing and even be capable of causing<br>
breakages.<br>
To remedy the disadvantages arising from this upstream<br>
current, FR 2 254 527 teaches, in the case of a soda-<br>
lime-silica glass, the placing of transverse barriers<br>
beneath the ribbon of glass, in order to prevent the<br>
upstream current reflected by the outlet wall of the<br>
bath from mixing with the downstream current in the<br>
drawing zone. To do this, a first tweel is provided<br>
beneath the ribbon of glass at the downstream end of<br>
the drawing zone; this tweel allows only a portion of<br>
the downstream current to flow beneath the ribbon and<br>
forces the upstream current to travel along the edges<br>
of the said ribbon. A second tweel, spaced upstream of<br>
the first and situated in the region of maximum<br>
acceleration of the glass, acts in the same manner in<br>
this second location allowing only a portion of the<br>
downstream current to flow beneath the ribbon of glass<br>
and forcing the upstream current to travel along the<br>
edges of the said ribbon. FR 2 372 122 furthermore<br>
proposes to associate the aforementioned transverse<br>
tweel with fixed deflectors situated upstream of the<br>
tweel and having the function of intercepting the<br>
currents of metal travelling along the side walls of<br>
the bath.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the float<br>
bath is fitted with one or more of these tweels and,<br>
where appropriate, with one or more of these fixed<br>
deflectors, limiting the intensity of the upstream<br>
current.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
ribbon runs on the float bath, a portion of the molten<br>
metal being tapped at the downstream end of the bath<br>
and reintroduced upstream into the bath. According to a<br>
variant, the quantity of tapped molten metal<br>
corresponds substantially to the quantity of molten<br>
metal that would be drawn along by the aforementioned<br>
upstream current, that is to say by the current created<br>
by the reflection on the bath's outlet wall of the<br>
current of molten metal which accompanies the run of<br>
the ribbon of glass. According to a variant, the method<br>
according to the invention is used to virtually totally<br>
eliminate the return current in the bath and hence the<br>
disruptions which derive therefrom, particularly in<br>
terms of turbulence. Furthermore, and in combination<br>
with this effect, the molten metal being cast upstream<br>
of the bath so that it forms a moving reception zone<br>
for the glass, it prevents any devitrification in the<br>
zone furthest upstream of the floated glass.<br>
The molten metal may undergo a heat treatment before it<br>
is reintroduced into the bath. Specifically, the<br>
temperature of the tapped metal is preferably brought<br>
to a temperature corresponding to that of the metal in<br>
the zone of the bath where the tapped metal is to be<br>
reintroduced. It is thus possible not only to prevent<br>
the turbulence but also to avoid causing temperature<br>
variations at the location where the metal is<br>
reintroduced.<br>
The molten metal may be tapped from the lateral portion<br>
of the bath and preferably in a symmetrical manner on<br>
either side. The molten metal may be tapped on the<br>
surface of the bath. The molten metal may also be<br>
tapped via the bottom of the bath at the sides or via<br>
the bottom. Preferably, the tapping is carried out in a<br>
symmetrical manner relative to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the bath so as not to disrupt the trajectory of the<br>
•ribbon of glass which is running on the molten metal.<br>
The tapping may be carried out totally at the end of<br>
the bath or further upstream of this end.<br>
According to a variant, the tapped molten metal may be<br>
reintroduced, simultaneously:<br>
- on the one hand, partially in the zone furthest<br>
upstream of the mass of glass in order to prevent<br>
devitrification, and<br>
- on the other hand, at at least one second point<br>
between the inlet and the outlet of the float<br>
installation. According to a variant, this second<br>
point (in fact preferably a pair of second points<br>
placed symmetrically relative to the longitudinal<br>
axis of the bath) is situated at the end of the glass<br>
drawing zone. This choice first makes it possible to<br>
carry out this operation in a zone with few<br>
encumbrances since this is after the last top rolls<br>
which draw along the ribbon of glass from above. In<br>
addition, the choice of this zone makes it possible<br>
to limit the energy necessary to increase the<br>
temperature of the metal which in this zone is<br>
usually at a temperature lying between 1200 and<br>
800°C.<br>
Thus, according to a variant, the flow of tapped and<br>
reintroduced metal is divided, on the one hand, in<br>
order to supply the float point the furthest upstream<br>
and situated on the longitudinal axis of the bath, and,<br>
on the other hand, in order to supply at least one<br>
other reintroduction point situated between the<br>
preceding point and the tapping point.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the molten<br>
metal is reintroduced into the bath at this second<br>
point (and naturally this is not the case for the zone<br>
furthest upstream) at a virtually zero speed and<br>
preferably in a symmetrical manner relative to the<br>
longitudinal axis of the float installation. According<br>
to this variant, it is possible to prevent or at the<br>
least limit the creation of a new current due to the<br>
volume of reintroduced molten metal. The preferred<br>
choice of a symmetrical reintroduction also makes it<br>
possible not to disrupt the trajectory of the ribbon of<br>
glass by a unilateral addition of material.<br>
The invention also proposes a device for applying the<br>
method that has just been presented. This device for<br>
the production of a ribbon of float glass comprises a<br>
float bath on which the ribbon runs, a means of pouring<br>
the glass upstream of the bath and a means of casting<br>
molten metal, upstream and on the longitudinal axis of<br>
the bath.<br>
According to a variant, this device also comprises   at<br>
least one system of tapping the molten metal and   at<br>
least one pipe connecting the tapping orifice to    at<br>
least one reintroduction point or zone.<br>
The system for tapping metal may be an orifice in the<br>
floor of the float bath.<br>
According to a variant, the system of tapping the<br>
molten metal is an overflow at the downstream end of<br>
the bath, at least one pipe connecting the overflow<br>
system to at least one reintroduction point or zone.<br>
The overflow system may consist of a tank, or reserve<br>
close-coupled to the bath and connected thereto by a<br>
spillway in which case the pipe is outside the bath.<br>
This also allows reintroduction of the metal at at<br>
least one second point (the first point, as has already<br>
been said, being the zone furthest upstream of the<br>
floated glass and on the longitudinal axis)<br>
advantageously either side of the bath, which is<br>
carried out from above. Again advantageously, the<br>
invention provides for the use of a device of the<br>
spillway type with flared surface which allows the<br>
metal reintroduced at this second point to flow into<br>
the bath at a virtually zero speed. The external pipe<br>
is resistant to the corrosion due to the molten metal;<br>
it is made for example of refractory material of the<br>
zircon/alumina type.<br>
According to another variant embodiment of the<br>
invention, an overflow system and a pipe are produced<br>
within the bath. This pipe may in particular be formed<br>
by the presence in the bath of a wall which therefore<br>
allows a return current in the bath without contact<br>
with the current of molten metal created by the run of<br>
the ribbon of glass.<br>
Preferably, according to one or other of these<br>
variants, the invention makes provision for associating<br>
the pipe with heating elements. The latter will<br>
advantageously be heating means of the induction type,<br>
particularly in the case of a pipe outside the bath<br>
made of a refractory material. In the case of the<br>
provision of a return channel in the bath, it is again<br>
possible to provide heating means such as electrodes<br>
indirectly heating the said channel.<br>
Thus the invention also concerns a float method on a<br>
float bath recirculating at least partially from<br>
downstream to upstream via at least one external duct,<br>
the metal tapped downstream being reheated before being<br>
reintroduced upstream.<br>
The invention again advantageously provides for a<br>
pumping system such as at least one graphite pump,<br>
introduced between the tapping system and the zone and<br>
the point or points of reintroduction. The pumping<br>
system will allow a circulation of the molten metal in<br>
the pipe such that the leve  of molten metal in the<br>
bath remains constant. If there are several pumps, a<br>
system of controlling the flow rate of recirculated<br>
metal can be provided to ensure the symmetry of the<br>
system. According to a variant embodiment and<br>
particularly when the pipe is of reduced length, the<br>
variation of density of the molten metal linked to the<br>
heat treatment that it undergoes for example within the<br>
pipe is used to give a speed to the molten metal<br>
leading to the same result.<br>
Other details and advantageous features of the<br>
invention will emerge hereinafter from the description<br>
of exemplary embodiments of the invention with<br>
reference to Figures 1 to 8 which represent,<br>
- Figure 1, a schematic side view (a) and top view (b)<br>
of the upstream portion of a conventional tank (prior<br>
art), comprising a float bath for the production of a<br>
glass ribbon by floating,<br>

according to the invention,<br>

conventional float installation (prior art),<br>
- Figure 4, a schematic top view of one embodiment of<br>
the invention,<br>

according to the invention,<br>
- Figure 6, a schematic top view of another embodiment<br>
of the invention,<br>

of a portion of a device corresponding to the case in<br>
Figure 4,<br>
- Figure 8, a top view of the representation of<br>
Figure 7.<br>
Figure 1 shows the upstream portion of a tank elongated<br>
for the production of float glass according to prior<br>
art, seen from the side (a) and seen from above (b) .<br>
The glass i flows on a spoutl.p 2 after adjustment of<br>
the thickness and of load between the said spoutlip and<br>
a vertical front tweel 3, then floats on the metal 5.<br>
It can be seen that the glass forms a heel 4 beneath<br>
the spoutlip. Arrows suggest the movement of the molten<br>
glass. The zone furthest upstream 6 of this heel<br>
situated symmetrically on the longitudinal axis AA' is<br>
a zone of stationary points. This zone is situated<br>
symmetrically on the axis AA' between two flows of<br>
glass travelling either side of the installation.<br>
Figure 2 shows a device according to the invention seen<br>
from the side. As hereinabove, the glass runs on a<br>
spoutlip 2 after thickness calibration by a front tweel<br>
3 to float thereafter on the float bath 5. A heel 4<br>
forms beneath the spoutlip 2. According to the<br>
invention, molten unetal of the same kind as that of the<br>
bath 5 constantly flows in the zone 6 preventing the<br>
formation of a stationary point for the molten glass.<br>
The duct 7 brings this molten metal which, is made to<br>
flow on an inclined plane 201 before it reaches the<br>
float bath itself, so doing to prevent turbulence in<br>
the bath of liquid metal.<br>
Figure 3 shows a conventional float installation<br>
without the particular device according to the<br>
invention. The invention provides an adaptation of this<br>
type of installation for floating glass of the glass-<br>
ceramic type. The invention may therefore make use of<br>
the same installation with the addition of a molten<br>
metal inlet at the zone or at the point furthest<br>
upstream and in a symmetrical manner relative to the<br>
longitudinal axis AA' of the installation and therefore<br>
also of the float glass. The tank comprises side walls<br>
8 and end walls 9 and 10, respectively at the inlet and<br>
at the outlet of the tank. The tank, containing a bath<br>
5 of molten tin, has a narrower downstream portion 11.<br>
The molten glass is poured onto the bath at its inlet<br>
end, from a distribution channel 12 ending in the<br>
spoutlip and placed above the inlet wall of the tank.<br>
Temperature regulators, not shown in the figures, are<br>
incorporated into the roof that surmounts the bath.<br>
These regulators establish the heat conditions of the<br>
glass while keeping it in the deformable state until<br>
the end of the drawing zone.<br>
In glass production, the bath comprises several zones<br>
shown in Figure 3 which may be distinguished in the<br>
following manner:<br>
- a zone I for spreading out the glass after it has<br>
been cast onto the float bath, upstream.<br>
- a zone II in which the ribbon of glass being formed<br>
is subjected to longitudinal forces directed outwards<br>
under the actions of lift-out rollers 12 and top<br>
rolls 13. In this zone, the drawing of the glass<br>
begins and the latter becomes thinner;<br>
- a zone III in which the ribbon of glass takes its<br>
definitive form under the action of the lift-out<br>
rollers 12.<br>
Zones II and III together form the drawing zone.<br>
- a consolidation zone IV in which the set ribbon of<br>
glass cools progressively.<br>
After having been poured onto the float bath, the glass<br>
spreads out freely to the maximum in zone I. It thus<br>
forms a ribbon 14 which moves downstream under the<br>
effect of the traction of the lift-out rollers 12<br>
outside the tank.<br>
The desired thickness is then obtained by the combined<br>
action of the traction of the lift-out rollers 12 and<br>
the knurled top rolls 13, usually made of steel,<br>
slightly oblique relative to the perpendicular to the<br>
direction of travel of the ribbon. These top rolls are<br>
connected by shaft 15 to motors 16 which drive them<br>
usually at speeds differing depending on their position<br>
and increasing downstream. These rolls apply to the<br>
edges of the ribbon of glass being formed forces<br>
opposing a narrowing of the ribbon of glass. The ribbon<br>
of glass is thus drawn out in the zone of these top<br>
roils. The ribbon of glass is then brought to the<br>
desired thickness by a drawing due to the lift-out<br>
rollers.<br>
The movement of the ribbon of glass on the bath causes<br>
beneath the ribbon a current of molten metal directed<br>
downstream of the tank and called the downstream<br>
current. This downstream current butts against the<br>
outlet face of the tank and rebounds to form an<br>
upstream current. The downstream current is schematized<br>
in the figure by a full arrow and the upstream current<br>
is schematized by dashed arrows (in zone IV).<br>
Figure 4 shows a partial top view of a diagram<br>
representing half of a float bath 17 . According to the<br>
invention, a portion of the molten metal may be tapped<br>
off at the downstream end of the bath and transported<br>
by a pipe 18. The metal is partially reintroduced in<br>
zone 6 across the whole width upstream of the bath (the<br>
flow of metal at 6 is represented by arrows),<br>
symmetrically relative to the longitudinal axis AA'<br>
(Figure 4 therefore shows only half of the width of<br>
reintroduction of the molten metal). Another<br>
reintroduction zone may be situated at different points<br>
19 of the bath. The invention also makes provision for<br>
the possibility of carrying out a heat treatment and<br>
more precisely a raising of the temperature to bring<br>
the tapped metal to a temperature closer to that of the<br>
reintroduction zone; such an operation is used to<br>
further limit the disruption due to temperature<br>
variations. In the case of Figure 4 and of a division<br>
into two reintroduction points 6 and 19, it is possible<br>
to make provision for example for a progressive heat<br>
treatment all along the pipe; according to this<br>
embodiment, the heat regulation is adapted to obtain at<br>
point 19 a temperature of the tapped molten metal<br>
corresponding to the temperature of the bath at this<br>
reintroduction point 19 in the bath and the heat<br>
treatment continues, while the rest of the molten metal<br>
is on its journey, up to point 6 so that the<br>
temperature of the metal at this point; 6 corresponds to<br>
the temperature in the bath in this reintroduction<br>
zone. According to another embodiment, it is possible<br>
to provide a heat treatment only for the metal taken up<br>
to point 6, considering that the metal reintroduced at<br>
point 19 is at such a temperature that it will not<br>
disrupt the reintroduction zone of the bath, the<br>
temperature difference being slight. The heating means<br>
used may be any means known to those skilled in the art<br>
and advantageously means of heating by induction<br>
particularly when a pipe 18 is made of a refractory<br>
material. According to the invention, the device<br>
illustrated in this Figure 4 is advantageously made in<br>
a symmetrical manner on the two edges of the bath so<br>
that the tapping and reintroduction of the molten metal<br>
do not disrupt the trajectory of travel of the ribbon<br>
of glass.<br>
It is again possible to provide a pumping device such<br>
as a graphite pump as previously stated. Such a pump<br>
will ensure that the tapped metal travels in the pipe<br>
18. According to another embodiment and more<br>
particularly when heating is provided, the variation of<br>
density of the molten metal inside the pipe 18 may be<br>
sufficient to ensure that the tapped metal travels as<br>
has also already been stated previously.<br>
Figure 5, which shows a partial schematic side view of<br>
a float bath, illustrates a device similar to the<br>
previous one according to which the molten metal is no<br>
longer tapped through the side of the bath but through<br>
the bottom thereof, via a pipe 18. This figure shows a<br>
pump 20 and a heating device, but the latter are<br>
optional as in the case of Figure 4. The pump 20 is<br>
advantageously provided at the beginning of the pipe 18<br>
and the heating device 51 is for its part provided at<br>
the end of the said pipe 18 just before the<br>
reintroduction zone 6. The reintroduced metal runs on<br>
an inclined plane 52 before rejoining the float bath<br>
53.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates another embodiment of the<br>
invention according to which the tapped molten metal is<br>
brought back upstream, on the one hand, by a pipe 27<br>
created inside the bath 5 by the presence of a wall 23<br>
and, on the other hand, by a duct 18 returning the<br>
molten metal all the way upstream to zone 6 in order to<br>
prevent the formation of a stationary point of glass. A<br>
pump 61 returns the molten metal through the duct 18.<br>
This Figure 6 shows first of all the ribbon of glass 1<br>
which is running on the float bath 5 delimited by the<br>
walls 8. The molten metal is drawn along by the ribbon<br>
of glass which creates a downstream current indicated<br>
by the arrows 26. At the end of the bath, this<br>
downstream current is transformed into an upstream<br>
current. This transformation occurs naturally as<br>
previously explained by the rebound on the end of the.<br>
bath and the molten metal is channelled in the pipe 27<br>
by a bath-bottom geometry judiciously provided for this<br>
purpose. This Figure 6 again shows heating elements<br>
such as radiant elements positioned above the bath to<br>
thermally recondition the tapped molten metal and bring<br>
it to the point 29 for reintroduction into the bath at<br>
a temperature as close as possible to that of the bath<br>
at this point. As in the case of the previous<br>
embodiments, these heating elements are optional and<br>
advantageously present when the reintroduction point is<br>
far upstream. Similarly, it is possible to add to such<br>
an embodiment a pump which would be advantageously<br>
placed at the beginning of the pipe 27 .<br>
Figures 7 and 8 represent a diagram of an installation<br>
that may correspond to an embodiment according to<br>
Figure 4, that is to say a lateral tapping of the<br>
molten metal. These figures show the downstream portion<br>
of the bath 37, the molten metal tapping point 30 and<br>
further upstream a reintroduction point 31. An overflow<br>
device 33 is made in close-coupled manner in the wall<br>
32 of the bath. This device 33 will naturally receive<br>
the molten metal which is drawn along by the ribbon of<br>
glass and which butts against the downstream end of the<br>
bath, then takes it to the pump 34 and finally into the<br>
pipe 35. The overflow device 33 consists essentially of<br>
an inclined plane 36 which helps the excess molten<br>
metal to be drawn along so that no upstream current<br>
appears within the bath 37. The pump 34 is<br>
advantageously a graphite pump and, as in all the<br>
previously presented embodiments, is optional. It is<br>
again possible to add to this device a heating system<br>
that is also optional.<br>
At the point 31 of reintroduction into the bath 37,<br>
there is advantageously provided a device, not shown in<br>
the figures, used to reintroduce the molten metal at a<br>
virtually zero speed; it is for example a spoutlip with<br>
flared surface.<br>
The duct returning the molten metal is divided in order<br>
to supply the reintroduction point 6 furthest upstream<br>
and is placed on the axis to prevent the glass from<br>
forming a stationary point.<br>
In the same manner as the other embodiments according<br>
to the invention, the system shown in Figures 7 and 8<br>
is advantageously produced either side of the bath in<br>
particular so as not to disrupt the trajectory of the<br>
ribbon of glass both at the tapping zone and at the<br>
reintroduction zone.<br>
Naturally, irrespective of which embodiment of the<br>
invention is chosen, the greatest volume created<br>
particularly by the molten metal circulation device is<br>
taken into account to determine the total volume of<br>
molten metal necessary for the correct operation of the<br>
device for producing the ribbon of float glass.<br>
These embodiments according to the invention have<br>
further advantages; it is known that, in the system of<br>
producing a ribbon of float glass, impurities are<br>
created which are found in the downstream zone of the<br>
bath and may contaminate the bottom surface of the<br>
ribbon of glass. The invention will make it possible at<br>
the same time as the tapping of the molten metal in the<br>
downstream zone to tap off these impurities and either<br>
remove them or subsequently reintroduce them into the<br>
bath further upstream, the latter following the route<br>
of the tapped molten metal. The reintroduction of these<br>
impurities upstream of the bath and hence in a hotter<br>
zone at reduced atmosphere will cause them to be<br>
reduced and hence disappear. The method according to<br>
the invention therefore also makes possible a treatment<br>
of the molten metal that removes the impurities.<br>
The method according to the invention has the further<br>
advantage of being simple to implement and being able<br>
in particular to be adapted to existing installations<br>
without requiring major implementation work.<br>
The ribbon of floated glass, particularly glass-ceramic<br>
precursor, may be from 1 mm to 30 mm thick, and more<br>
particularly from 1.5 mm to 25 mm and from 50 to 500 cm<br>
wide and more particularly from 60 to 4 60 cm.<br>
On leaving the forming installation, the ribbon passes<br>
into a lehr to cool progressively, after which the<br>
ribbon is cut up into sheets comprising two main faces<br>
and one sheared edge. Each main face of these sheets<br>
may have a surface area of 0.15 m to 20 m . In<br>
particular, each main face may be from 0.4 m to 6 m<br>
long and from 0.4 m to 3.5 m wide.<br>
These sheets then undergo the ceramization heat<br>
treatment specific to transforming them into glass-<br>
ceramic. As an example, for a glass-ceramic based on<br>
Si02-Li20, the ceramzation treatment may usually<br>
be carried out in the following manner:<br>
a)  raising the temperature at the rate of 30 to<br>
80C/minute to the nucleation domain, usually<br>
situated in the vicinity of the glass transformation<br>
domain;<br>
b)  passing through the nucleation range (670-800°C) in<br>
15 to 25 minutes;<br>
c)  raising the temperature at the rate of 15 to<br>
30°C/minute up to the temperature of the<br>
ceramization level usually lying between 900 and<br>
1100°C ;<br>
d)  maintaining the temperature of the ceramization<br>
level for a period of 10 to 25 minutes;<br>
e)  rapid cooling to the ambient temperature.<br>
After the ceramization cycle, the sheet of glass<br>
comprises the crystalline phase characteristic of the<br>
glass-ceramic structure.<br>
The invention also concerns a flat glass-ceramic<br>
preparation method comprising the float process<br>
according to the invention with no stationary point,<br>
leading to a flat glass, which then undergoes a<br>
ceramization treatment leading to the said flat glass-<br>
ceramic .<br>
The invention also concerns the device for applying the<br>
method that has been described and more particularly a<br>
device for producing a ribbon of float glass, according<br>
to which the ribbon runs on a float bath, characterized<br>
in that it comprises a means of introducing molten<br>
metal substantially at the point furthest upstream of<br>
the float glass and situated on the longitudinal axis<br>
of the bath. The means of introduction is preferably<br>
such that the molten metal is in motion at the point of<br>
meeting with the float bath. More particularly, the<br>
means of introduction may comprise an inclined plane of<br>
refractory material, the said inclined plane ending at<br>
the float bath, such that the molten metal to be<br>
introduced first runs onto the inclined plane before<br>
pouring into the bath. In particular, the device may<br>
comprise at least one duct supplied with metal tapped<br>
from the bath and returning the said tapped metal to<br>
the point furthest upstream of the glass and situated<br>
on the longitudinal axis of the bath. It may also<br>
comprise at least one overflow system at the downstream<br>
end of the bath to tap off molten metal and connected<br>
to the duct. The overflow system may be a tank close-<br>
coupled to the bath and connected thereto by a<br>
spillway, the pipe being outside the bath. Preferably,<br>
the metal is withdrawn and reintroduced in a<br>
symmetrical manner relative to the longitudinal axis of<br>
the float installation.<br>
The invention also relates to a (flat) sheet of glass-<br>
ceramic at least one dimension of which (width or<br>
length) is greater than 75 cm, and even greater than<br>
80 cm and even greater than 100 cm and even greater<br>
than 200 cm, usually less than 600 cm. In particular,<br>
the sheet may be thin, that is to say thinner than 3 mm<br>
and even thinner than 2.5 mm, even thinner than 2 mm,<br>
furthermore usually thicker than 0.8 mm.<br>
Any type of glass-ceramic precursor glass may be worked<br>
according to the invention, including those comprising<br>
more than 1.5% ZnO and even more than 1.6% by weight of<br>
ZnO.<br>
It is clearly understood that this invention, described<br>
more particularly for producing glass-ceramic, also<br>
applies to glass of a non glass-ceramic type. It is<br>
also well understood that the metal in the float bath<br>
may be recirculated independently of the reintroduction<br>
at the head of the float bath. The recirculation of the<br>
molten metal (usually tin-based) is more particularly<br>
described in relation with the production of glass for<br>
glass-ceramic and other glasses sensitive to<br>
crystallization, but this recirculation method applies<br>
also to any float chamber, whatever the glass produced,<br>
so as to benefit from advantages other than that of<br>
preventing crystallization.<br>
