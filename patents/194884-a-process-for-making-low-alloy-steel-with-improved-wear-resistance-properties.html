				<td>The present invention relates to process for manufacture of a low alloy steel with improved wear resistant properties<br>
In plant the sinter screen made of stainless steels suffers from high rate of wear due to its low hardness Since the sinter particles arc hard enough to make the indent in steel components the same result in the net loss of weight The screen is made by punching the stainless plate and set at inclined angle under continuous vibration The sinters falling on the surface slide down to the conveyor belt Thus huge amount of sinter causes degradation of steel plates which result in loss of material and time for charging<br>
I The basic object of the present invention is to provide a low alloy steel having selective chemical   constitution which would have improved wear resistant properties and avoid the above discussed<br>
   problems of the known art  <br>

providing the molten steel of desired chemical composition ;<br>
tapping the molten steel in the temperature range of 1600 - 1660°C with<br>
or without addition of further ingot/concast ;<br>
forming blooms from the molten metal ;<br>
soaking the blooms ; and    <br>
obtaining the finished steel there from preferably as plates in the minimum temperature of 800°C such as to thereby produce the required low alloy steel with high wear resistant properties<br>
The invention is described hereunder in greater detail with reference to the non-limitmg exemplary embodiments illustrated in accompanying figures wherein<br>
Figure 1 is a flow diagram showing basic steps involved in the manufacture of the low alloy steel of this invention.<br>

Figure 2 illustrate the mechanical properties as a function of temperatures in the laboratory testing.<br>
Figure  3  shows the bar chart of the mechanical properties as a function of<br>
thickness and heat treatment.	<br>
Figure 4 illustrates the hardness variation as a function of tempering temperature in the laboratory testing.<br>
Figure 5 illustrates the effect of heat treatment on wear loss of steel in the laboratory testing.<br>
Figure 6 shows the component, called as cold sinter screen, obtained of the low alloy steel of this invention.<br>
As illustrated in figure 1 the process of the present invention comprises the following steps in sequence :<br>
(a) producing the molten steel of required chemical composition in both basic oxygen furnace (BOF) and electric arc furnace (EAF) using iron ore, spar, burnt dolo, sand, mill scale steel strips and ferro alloys as raw materials ;<br>
b)	tapping  the  molten steel  is  tapped  at   1630±30°C  in  a preheated  ladle with<br>
addition of a part of the ferro alloys in ladle ;   ??<br><br>
c) top pouring of the molten steel to form ingot;<br>
d) the ingots are rolled after soaking at  1300±20°C for 3-5 hrs.  or alternatively<br>
molten steel is concast directly into blooms at the tundish temperature of 1540-<br>
1550°C-with high bending point temperature (&gt;800°C).<br>
e) soaking of the blooms at about 1250°C for period of 1 min per mm thickness of<br>
the blooms and finished rolled in between 900-950°C into plates.<br>
f) The plates are next air cooled to ambient temperature.<br><br><br>
The mechanical properties of the steel produced following the above process of the invention are next determined in laboratory.<br><br>
First the steel is austenitised in temperature range of AC3  and AC3 + 50°C for the period of 1 min per mm thickness followed by oil quenching and then tempering. The variation of strength  as a function of temperature noted is  shown  in  figure  2,. Similarly the strength shown in figure 3 reveals the effect of thickness and heat treatment. The tempering is conducted to ascertain the optimum hardness as shown in figure 4 upto 700°C. Upto 250 - 300°C the hardness does not change much but only stresses are relieved. Above 300°C there is loss in hardness drastically. This is used to increase the hardness which is basic requirement for improving the we. resistant properties.<br>
The mechanical properties of the alloy steel of the invention achieved one represente in following table I.<br>

The wear properties are determined as ASTM standard. The wear loss as a function of heat treatment is shown in figure 5.<br>
The. plates are subjected to the fabrication by using gas cutting and punching the required sizes of slots. This is austenitised in the range of AC3 and AC3 + 50°C at the rate of 1 min per mm thickness of plates followed by oil quenching and ther tempering is carried out at 250 ± 15°C at the rate of 1 min per mm thickness. Thus the hardness of the plates are increased upto 380 BHN as compared to stainles steel plates which has a hardness of 140 BHN.<br>

The   plate  obtained  following  the  present  invention  is  punchable   upto   10   mm thickness. It can be fabricated easily. The weldability is also good.<br>

Reference is invited to figure 6 which illustrates a cold sinter screen obtained of the low alloy steel obtained in accordance with the present invention.<br>
Importantly, the structure study of the steel obtained by the invention showed the presence of bainites. Increasing the hardness of the used components confirms the presence of retained austenite during oil quenching treatment. The process of the invention thus achieve to provide special end use characteristics to the steel.<br>
The steel produced by the process of the invention is also cost effective by way of the use of low content of chromium, nickel. Moreover the process advantageously provides adequate heat treatment schedule for improvement in hardness and thus increase in service life.<br>
