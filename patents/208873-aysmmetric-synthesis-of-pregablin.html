"AYSMMETRIC SYNTHESIS. OF PREGABLIN"<br>
WARNER-LAMBERT COMPANY, a corporation organized under the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 201 Tabor Road, Morris Plains, New Jersey, 07950, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner<br>
in which it is to be performed:	<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method of making (S)-(+)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid (pregabalin) in an asymmetric synthesis. Pregabalin is useful for the treatment and prevention of seizure disorders, pain, and psychotic disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION.<br>
(S)-(+)-3-(Aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid is known generically as pregabalin. The compound is also called (S)-(+)-p-isobutyl-y-aminobutyric acid, (S)-isobutyl-GABA, and CI-1008. Pregabalin is related to the endogenous inhibitory neurotransmitter y-aminobutyric acid or GAB A, which is involved in the regulation of brain neuronal activity. Pregabalin has anti-seizure activity, as described by Silverman et al., U.S. Patent No. 5,563,175. Other indications for pregabalin are also currently being pursued (see, for example, Guglietta et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,127,418: and Singh et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,001,876).<br>
A seizure is defined as excessive unsynchronized neuronal activity that disrupts normal brain function. It is thought that seizures can be controlled by regulating the concentration of the GAB A neurotransmitter. When the concentration of GAB A diminishes below a threshold level in the brain, seizures result (Karlsson et al., Biochem. Pharmacol., 1974;23:3053); when the GABA level rises in the brain during convulsions, the seizures terminate (Hayashi. Physiol. (London), 1959;145:570).<br>
Because of the importance of GABA as a neurotransmitter, and its effect on convulsive states and other motor dysfunctions, a variety of approaches have been taken to increase the concentration of GABA in the brain. In one approach, compounds that activate L-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) have been used to increase the concentration of GABA, as the concentrations of GAD and GABA vary in parallel, and increased GAD concentrations result in increased GABA<br><br><br>
concentrations (Janssens de Varebeke et al., Biochem. Pharmacol, 1983;32:2751; Loscher, Biochem. Pharmacol., 1982:31:837; Phillips et al., Biochem. Pharmacol, 1982;31:2257). For example, the racemic compound (±)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid (racemic isobutyl-GABA), which is a GAD activator, has the ability to suppress seizures while avoiding the undesirable side effect of ataxia.<br>
The anticonvulsant effect of racemic isobutyl-GABA is primarily attributable to the S-enantiomer (pregabalin). That is, the S-enantiomer of isobutyl-GABA shows better anticonvulsant activity than the R-enantiomer (see, for example, Yuen et al., Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters, 1994;4:823). Thus, the commercial utility of pregabalin requires an efficient method for preparing the S-enantiomer substantially free of the R-enantiomer.<br>
Several methods have been used to prepare pregabalin. Typically, the racemic mixture is synthesized and then subsequently resolved into its R- and S-enantiomers (see U.S. Patent No. 5,563,175 for synthesis via an azide intermediate). Another method uses potentially unstable nitro compounds, including nitromethane, and an intermediate that is reduced to an amine in a potentially exothermic and hazardous reaction. This synthesis also uses lithium bis(trimethylsilylamide) in a reaction that must be carried out at -78°C (Andruszkiewicz et al., Synthesis, 1989:953). More recently, the racemate has been prepared by a "malonate" synthesis, and by a Hofmann synthesis (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,840,956; 5,637,767; 5,629,447; and 5.616,793). The classical method of resolving a racemate is used to obtain pregabalin according to these methods. Classical resolution involves preparation of a salt with a chiral resolving agent to separate and purify the desired S-enantiomer. This involves significant, processing, and also substantial additional cost associated with the resolving agent. Partial recycle of the resolving agent is feasible, but requires additional processing and cost, as well as associated waste generation. Moreover, the undesired R-enantiomer cannot be efficiently recycled and is ultimately discarded as waste. The maximum theoretical yield of pregabalin is thus 50%, since only half of the racemate is the desired product. This reduces the effective throughput of the process (the amount that can be made in a given reactor volume), which is a<br><br><br>
component of the production cost and capacity.<br>
Pregabalin has been synthesized directly via several different synthetic schemes. One method includes use of n-butyllithium at low temperatures (
Because pregabalin is being developed as a commercial pharmaceutical product, the need exists for an efficient, cost effective, and safe method for its large-scale synthesis. In order to be viable for commercial manufacturing, such a process needs to be highly enantioselective, for example, where the product is formed with a substantial excess of the correct enantiomer. An object of this invention is to provide such a process, namely an asymmetric hydrogenation process.<br>
Asymmetric hydrogenation processes are known for some compounds. Burk et al, in WO 99/31041 and WO 99/52852, describe asymmetric hydrogenation of ß-substituted and ß,ß-disubstituted itaconic acid derivatives to provide enantiomerically enriched 2-substituted succinic acid derivatives. The itaconic substrates possess two carboxyl groups, which provide the requisite steric and electronic configuration to direct the hydrogenation to produce an enriched enantiomer. The disclosures teach that salt forms of the formula RR'C=C<br>
(C02Me)CH2C02-Y+ are required to obtain hydrogenated products having at . least 95% enantiomeric excess.<br>
According to U.S. Patent No. 4,939,288. asymmetric hydrogenation does not work well on substrates having an isobutyl group. We have now discovered that an isobutyl cyano carboxy acid, salt or ester substrate, of the formula iPrCH=C(CN)CH2C02R- can be selectively hydrogenated to provide an enantiomerically enriched nitrile derivative, which can be subsequently hydrogenated to produce substantially pure pregabalin. This selectivity is<br>
particularly surprising given the dramatic differences in steric configuration ar inductive effects of a nitrile moiety compared to a carboxy-group. Indeed, ther no teaching in the prior art of the successful asymmetric hydrogenation of any cyano substituted carboxy olefin of this type.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an efficient method of preparing (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid (pregabalin). The method compris asymmetric hydrogenation of a cyano substituted olefin to produce a cyano precursor of (S)-3-(aminomethyI)-5-methylhexanoic acid. The method further comprises a reaction to convert the cyano intermediate into (S)-3-(aminomethyl 5-methylhexanoic acid. The asymmetric synthesis of (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid described herein results in a substantial enrichment of pregabalin over the undesired (R)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid. The R-enantiomer is produced only as a small percentage of the final product.<br>
The present invention offers several advantages over previous methods o making pregabalin. For example, processing to remove the undesired R-enantiomer and subsequent disposal of this waste is minimized. Because the S-enantiomer is greatly enriched in the final product, the asymmetric approach is more efficient. Furthermore, the present method does not require the use of hazardous nitro compounds, costly chiral auxiliaries, or low temperatures as required in previous methods. Moreover, unlike the classical resolution approaches or the chiral auxiliary route, which require stoichiometric amounts oi the chiral agent, this synthesis utilizes sub-stoichiometric quantities of the chiral agent as a catalyst. Thus, the method of the present invention has both economic and environmental advantages.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, the term "lower alkyl" or "alkyl" means a straight or branched hydrocarbon having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms and includes, for exampli<br><br>
methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, n-hexyl. and the like.<br>
The term "aryl" means an aromatic carbocyclic group having a single ring (e.g., phenyl), multiple rings (e.g., biphenyl), or multiple condensed rings in which at least one is aromatic (e.g., 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthyl, naphthyl, anthryl, or phenanthryl). The aryl group may be unsubstituted or substituted by 1 to 3 substituents selected from alkyl, O-alkyl and S-alkyl, OH, SH, -CN, halogen, 1,3-dioxolanyL CF3, N02, NH2, NHCH3, N(CH3)2, NHCO-alkyl, -(CH2)mC02H, -(CH2)mC02-alkyl, -(CH2)mS03H, -NH alkyl, -N(alkyI)2, -CH2)mP03H2, -(CH2)mP03(alkyI)2, -(CH2)mS02NH2, and -(CH2)mS02NH-aIkyl, wherein<br>
alkyl is defined as above and m is 0, 1, 2, or 3. A preferable aryl group of the present invention is phenyl. Typical substituted aryl groups include methylphenyl, 4-methoxybiphenyl, 3-chloronaphth-l-yl, and dimethylaminophenyl.<br>

The disclosures in this application of all articles and references, including patents, are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The present invention provides an efficient synthesis of (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid (pregabalin). This synthesis is depicted in Scheme 1, below,<br><br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
wherein R1 is lower alkyl, aryl, arylalkyl or allyl; and Y is a cation, and preferably H+, the salt of a primary or secondary amine, an alkaline earth metal, such as /erf-butyl ammonium, or an alkali metal such as sodium.<br>
As illustrated in Scheme 1, a metal salt 2 (where Y is potassium, for example) of a cyano alkanoic acid may be obtained from the cyano hexenoate ester la or lb by sequential asymmetric hydrogenation and ester hydrolysis to the free acid or salt. Subsequent reduction of the nitrile 2 by routine hydrogenation with a catalyst such as nickel, followed by acidification of the carboxylate salt, affords pregabalin. Alternatively, these steps can be reversed, such that the substrate for asymmetric hydrogenation is the acid or salt 4<br>
  v<br>
where X is CO2H or CO2-Y, and Y is a cation. Compound 4 can exist as the<br>
individual E or Z geometric isomer, or a mixture thereof: Salts can be formed by reacting the free acid (X is CO2H) with a strong base such as a metal hydroxide,<br>
e.g., KOH. Alternatively, the salt may be formed with, for example, a counterion WH+ such as that derived from an amine (W) or a phosphine (W). Primary C1-10<br>
alkylamines and cycloalkylamines are preferred, in particular, tert-butylamine. Tertiary amines such as triethylamine may also be'used. Again, subsequent reduction of the nitrile 2 by standard methods, followed by acidification of the carboxylate salt, affords pregabalin.<br>
In the general synthesis of pregabalin according to Scheme 1, the cyano olefin compound la or lb undergoes ester hydrolysis and asymmetric hydrogenation to form the desired enantiomer of a 3-cyano-5-methylhexanoic acid or the corresponding carboxylate salt 2. The olefin substrate can be the individual E or Z geometric isomer, or a mixture thereof. Subsequent reduction of the nitrile 2, followed by acidification of the carboxylate salt;'affords pregabalin.<br><br>
The asymmetric hydrogenation step is performed in the presence of a chiral catalyst, preferably a rhodium complex of an (R,R)-DuPHOS or (S.S)-DuPHOS ligand. commercially available from Strem Chemicals, Inc. (7 Mulliken Way, Newburyport, MA 01950-4098) and Chirotech Technology-Limited (Cambridge Science Park, Cambridge, Great Britain) (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,532,395 and 5,171,892). The ligand preferably has the formula<br><br><br><br>
  or <br>
wherein R is lower alkyl. Preferred alkyl groups for R are w-alkyl groups, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl or hexyl. More preferred alkyl groups for R are methyl or ethyl. Other catalysts that can be used include rhodium complexes of chiral-BPE and chiral-DIPAMP which have the formulas<br><br><br><br>
chiral-BPE<br><br>
Such catalysts generally are complexed with 1,5-cyclooctadiene (COD). These agents are fully described by Burk et al. in J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1995;117:9375.<br>
The asymmetric hydrogenation reaction is carried out under a hydrogen atmosphere and preferably in a protic solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, or a mixture of such alcohols with water.<br>
The cyano hexenoate starting materials (e.g., la) are readily available<br><br>
 (Yamamoto et ai. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jap., 1985;58:3397). They can be prepared according to Scheme 2, below,<br><br><br>
wherein R1 is as defined above in Scheme 1 and R2is COCH3 or C02alkyl-<br>
In the synthesis of a compound la according to Scheme 2, amine catalyzed addition of acrylonitrile (i.e., the Baylis-Hillman reaction) to 2-methylpropanal affords the cyano allylic alcohol. Typical amines used to catalyze the condensation include agents such as l,4-diazabicyclo[2,2,2]octane (Dabco). The cyano allylic alcohol is subsequently converted to either an alkyl carbonate (e.g., by reaction with an alkyl halo formate such as ethyl chloro formate) or the respective acetate (by reaction with acetic anhydride or acetyl chloride). The resulting 2-(2-methylpropyl)prop-2-enenitrile is then subjected to palladium-catalyzed carbonylation to produce ethyl 3-cyano-5-methylhex-3-enoate la (e.g.,<br>
where R1 is methyl or ethyl).<br>
In one embodiment of the invention illustrated in Scheme 3 below, asymmetric hydrogenation is first.carried out on la (where R1is ethyl for example) to form the (S)-3-cyano-5-ethylhexanoic acid ester 3. Use of chiral (S,S) hydrogenation catalysts from the bisphospholane series, for example [(S,S)-Me-DuPHOS]Rh(COD)+BF4" on the ester substrates (e.g., R1 is alkyl) provides<br>
products enriched in the desired S-enantiomer. The ester 3 is subsequently hydrolyzed to the acid or salt 2. Scheme 3 below shows this synthetic route.<br><br><br>
wherein Y is as defined above for Scheme l.-By switching to the catalyst [(R,R.)-<br>
Me-DuPHOS]Rh(COD)+ BF4-, the hydrogenation product is enriched in (R)-3-<br>
cyano-5-methylhexanoic acid ethyl ester. Typically, these hydrogenation processes provide for substrate conversion of at least 90%. and enantiomeric enrichment (e.e.) of 20% to 25%. Further enrichment of the product can be effected by selective recrystallization with a chiral resolving agent, as described below.<br>
Scheme 3<br><br><br>
A preferred embodiment of the invention is illustrated in Scheme 4. where the ester la is first hydrolyzed to the salt of the 3-hexenoic acid 4, (e.g., 4a as shown in Scheme 4 where Y is sodium or potassium). The cyano hexanoic acid salt 4a is then hydrogenated to the salt 2. The cyano hexanoic acid salt 4a may be isolated, or may be prepared in situ prior to hydrogenation. Scheme 4 below depicts this preferred embodiment, wherein Y is as defined above for Scheme 1. A distinctive feature of the hydrogenation of the salt 4a is that the desired S-enantiomer 2 is obtained by use of a chiral (R,R) catalyst from the<br>
bisphospholane series, for example [(R,R)-Me-DuPHOS]Rh(COD)+BF4-. This represents an unexpected switch in absolute stereochemistry when compared to hydrogenation of the ester substrate la (Scheme 3). In addition, the<br><br>
enantioselectivity achieved in the hydrogenation of the salt 4a is much higher, typically at least about 95% e.e. The choice of cation Y does not appear to be critical, since comparable enantioselectivities are observed with metallic cations<br>
(e.g.. K+) and non-metallic cations (e.g., tert-butyl ammonium). Without being bound by theory, the contrasting properties of substrates la and 4a may derive from binding interactions between functional groups of each substrate and the rhodium center in the catalyst/which in rum may influence both the direction and degree of facial selectivity during hydrogenation of the olefin. Thus, in the hydrogenation of the ester la, the cyano substituent may participate in binding to the catalyst. This effect appears to be entirely overridden in hydrogenation of the salt 4a, in which binding by the carboxylate group is likely to be dominant.<br>
Scheme 4<br><br><br><br><br>
asymmetric hydrogenation<br><br>
As a further embodiment, the invention provides novel compounds of the formula 4<br><br><br>
wherein X is CO2H or CO2-Y, and where Y is a cation as described above in<br>
Scheme 1. These compounds are useful substrates in the synthesis of pregabalin.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the invention, the final pregabalin product may be selectively recrystallized with (S)-mandelic acid to provide still further enhanced enrichment of the desired S-isomer. Thus, high levels of the (R)-enantiomer (up to at least 50%) can be removed by classical resolution via the S-mandelic acid salt (U.S. Patent 5,840,956; U.S. Patent 5,637,767). Suitable solvents for such selective recrystallizations include, for example, water or an alcohol (e.g., methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, and the like) or a mixture of water and an alcohol. In general, excess mandelic acid is used. It is also noted that mandelic acid can be used in combination with another acid.<br>
Alternatively, pregabalin containing low leyels.(<l of the can be enriched to>99.9% of the (S)-enantiomer by simple recrystallization from, for example, water/isopropyl alcohol. Pregabalin containing higher levels (up to 3.5%) of the (R)-enantiomer), can also be enriched by simple recrystallization from, for example, water/isopropyl alcohol, although successive recrystallizations are usually required to reach &gt;99.9% of the (S)-enantiomer. "Substantially pure" pregabalin, as used herein, means at least about 95% (by weight) S-enantiomer, and no more than about 5% R-enantiomer. The following detailed examples further illustrate particular embodiments of the invention. These examples are not intended to limit the scope of the invention and should not be so construed. The starting materials and various intermediates may be obtained from commercial sources, prepared from commercially available compounds, or prepared using well-known synthetic methods well-known to those skilled in the art of organic chemistry.<br>

The solution is cooled at 10°C to 15°C in an ice bath. Using a 1 L graduated addition funnel, a mixture of 0.5 L of methylene chloride and 200 mL (2.1 mol) of ethyl chloroformate is added slowly while maintaining the reaction temperature at 20°C ±5°C. The reaction is stirred at 22°C ±3°C for about two additional hours. The reaction solution is poured into a 6 L separatory funnel containing 200 mL (2.3 mol) of hydrochloric acid and 1.25 L of water. The lower organic layer is washed again with a solution of 60 mL (0.7 mol) of HC1 and 0.5 L of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (30 g), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide 226 g of carbonic acid 2-:cyano-l-isopropyl-allyl ester ethyl ester as a yellow oil which may be used in the next step without further purification.<br><br>

The solution is cooled at 10°C to 15°C in an ice bath. Using a 500 mL graduated addition funnel, a mixture of 100 mL of methylene chloride and 43 mL (0.6 mol) of acetyl chloride is added slowly while maintaining the reaction temperature at 25°C ±5°C. The reaction is stirred at 22°C ±3°C for about one additional hour. The reaction solution is poured into a 4 L separator}' funnel containing 85 mL (1.0 mol) of hydrochloric acid and 750 mL of water. The lower organic layer is washed again with a solution of 20 mL (0.2 mol) of HC1 and 250 mL of water. The organic layer is dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate (20 g), filtered, and concentrated by rotary evaporation to provide 66 g of acetic acid 2-cyano-l-isopropyl-allyl ester as a yellow oil which may be used in the next step without further purification.<br>
Acetic acid 2-cyano-l-isopropyl-allyl ester (using acetic anhydride)<br>
To a 500 mL, four-necked, round-bottom flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, a temperature probe, a reflux condenser, and a nitrogen inlet is charged acetic anhydride (40 mL, 0.45 mol). This solution is heated to 50°C, and a solution of 3-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-methylenepentaneriitrile (50 g, 0.40 mol) and 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine (1.5 g) in tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) is added over 35 minutes.

G.	By following the general procedures from above, 250 mg (1.634 mmol) of<br>
3-cyano-5-methylhex-3-enoic acid was reacted with hydrogen (50 psi. 16 hours,<br>
24°C) in the presence of 12 mg (0.01634 mmol) of [(R,R)-<br>
DIPAMP]Rh(COD.)+BF4- in methanol (10 mL) to provide 51% of 3-cyano-5-methylhexanoic acid having 72% e.e. for the R-enantiomer.<br>
EXAMPLE 6 Recrystallization of Pregabalin<br>
Pregabalin solid (117 kg, 735 mol) containing 0.6% of the (R)-enantiomer is combined with water (550 L; 4.7 L/kg pregabalin) and isopropyl alcohol (1100 L: 9.4 L/kg pregabalin). The mixture is heated to dissolve the solids (about 75°'C ±5°C). filtered while hot. and cooled to 0°C ±5°C to crystallize the product.<br><br>
The solid is collected on a centrifuge and rinsed with isopropyl alcohol. The damp solid is dried under vacuum at 35°C to 45°C and then milled to give 91.8 kg (78.5%&gt;) of pregabalin as a white crystalline solid. The enantiomer ratio is 99.94% (S)-enantiomer (pregabalin) and 0.06% of the (R)-enantiomer.<br>
