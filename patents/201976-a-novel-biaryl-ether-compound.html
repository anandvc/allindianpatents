"A NOVEL BIARYL ETHER COMPOUND"<br>
PFIZER PRODUCTS INC., a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Connecticut, United States of America, of Eastern Point Road, Groton, Connecticut 06340, United States of America,<br>
GRANTED<br>
31-3-2006<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the                                manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
                                                                                                             141/MUM/2000<br>
                                                                                                                       21-2-2000<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a novel biaryl ether compound.<br>
Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) currently provide efficacy in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MOD) and are generally perceived by psychiatrists and primary care physicians as effective, well-tolerated and easily administered. However, they are associated with undesirable features, such as high incidence of sexual dysfunction, delayed onset of action and a level on non-responsiveness estimated to be as high as 30% (see M. J. Gitlin, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 1994, 55, 406-413 and R. T. Segraves, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 1992, 10(2), 4-10). Preclinical and clinical evidence has indicated that the sexual dysfunction associated with SSRI therapy can be reduced through the use of dopamine reuptake inhibitors (DRIs), such as bupropion (see A. K. Ashton, Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 1998, 59(3),112-115). Furthermore, the combination of SRI and DRI may hasten the onset of action as well as offering relief to refractory patients, possibly through a synergistic mechanism (see R. D. Marshall et al, Journal of Psychopharmacology, 1995, 9(3), 284-286).<br>
This invention relates to novel biaryl ether derivatives that exhibit activity as monoamine (e.g., dopamine, serotonin) reuptake inhibitors, to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds and to methods of using such compounds to treat central nervous system (CNS) and other disorders.<br>
United States Patent 4,018,830, published on April 19, 1997, refers to phenylthioaralkylamines and 2-phenylthiobenzylamines which are active as antiarrhythmics.<br>
PCT publication 97/17325, published on May 15, 1997, refers to derivatives of N,N- dimethyl-2-(arylthio)benzylamine which selectively influence serotonin transport in the central nervous system and are useful as antidepressants.<br>
United States Patent 5,190,965, published on March 2, 1993, and United states Patent 5,430,063, issued July 4, 1995, refer to phenoxyphenyl derivatives which have utility in the treatment of depression.<br>
United States Patent 4,161,529, published on July 17, 1979, refers to pyrrolidine derivative which possess anticholesteremic and hypolipemic activity.<br>

Compounds of the formulas II and III are commercially available or can be made by methods well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.

When L = F, the procedure of A. J. Bridges et aL, Tetrahedron Letters, 1992, 33(49), 7499-7502, is particularly useful for the synthesis of substituted ortho-fluorobenzaldehydes. Other such transformations have been described by C. F. H. Allen et aL, Organic Synthesis, 1951, 31, 92; T. DePaulis et al, J. Med. Chem., 1986, 29, 61; I. M. Godfrey et aL, J. Chemical Society, Perkm Transactions 1, 1974, 1353; K. M. Tramposil et aL, J. Med. Chem., 1983, 26(2). 121; and M. E. CracKnell et aL, Chem. Ind., (London), 1985, (9), 309.<br>
Referring to Scheme 1, a compound (Le^, an aldehyde or ketone) of the formula Ma, wherein L is a suitable leaving group such as fluoro, chloro, nitro or triflate, is reacted with a compound (Le., a phenol) of the formula Ilia in the presence of a base to form the corresponding compound of formula IV. This reaction is generally carried out at a temperature from about 0°C to about 150°C for about 1 hour to about 3 days, preferably at about 90-95°C for about 18 hours, in a polar solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA) or N-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP), preferably DMF. Suitable bases include anhydrous sodium carbonate (Na2C03), potassium carbonate (K2C03), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH) and amines such as pyrrolidine, triethylamine and pyridine, with anhydrous K2C03 being preferred. Details for conducting this procedure can be found in G. W. Yeager et aL, Synthesis, 1995, 28-30; J. R. Dimmock et aL, Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, 1996, 39(20), 3984-3997. Alternatively, phenols of the formula lib and compounds of the formula lllb may be converted into aldehydes or ketones of the general formulae IV according to the procedures described by K. Tomisawa et al., Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 1984, 32(8), 3066-3074,<br>
Compounds of the formula IV can be converted into compounds of the formula I by subjecting them to reductive amination conditions.  For example, a compound of the formula<br><br><br>
IV can be reacted with a compound of the formula HNR'R: to form an intermediate of the formula XVII:<br><br><br><br>
or, if R2 = H,<br><br>
XVII<br>
which may be isolated or converted directly in the same reaction step into a compound of the formula I. This conversion, whether in situ or starting with the isolated compound of formula XVII, can be performed using one or more methods known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For example, the compound of formula IV and the appropriate compound of formula HNR'R2 can be combined in the presence of a dehydrating reagent such as titanium (IV) tetrachloride or titanium (IV) isopropoxide, in a reaction inert solvent such as benzene, toluene, ethanol or a like solvent, until the reaction is judged to be complete, according to the procedure of S. Bhattarcharyya (Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1995, 60(15), 4928-4929). Alternatively, the compound of formula IV and the compound of formula HNR1R2 can be combined in an inert solvent such as benzene or toluene, in the presence or absence of a water scavenger such as molecular sieves, and heated to eliminate water generated during the formation of the intermediate of formula XVII. The degree of completion of the conversion of compounds of the formula IV into the above intermediate(s) of formula XVII can be assessed using one or more known analytical techniques, including 'H-NMR spectroscopy.<br>
In some instances, it may be possible or desirable to isolate the intermediate(s) of formula XVII, or they may be further reacted with a reducing agent selective for the reduction of the intermediate to the desired compounds of formula I. Such reducing agents are widely known to those skilled in the art and include, for example, sodium borohydride (NaBHJ, sodium cyanoborohydride (NaBH3CN) and sodium triacetoxy-borohydride (NaBHCOAc)^, as described by A. F. Abdel-Magid et al. in Tetrahedron Letters, 1990, 31, 5595). This reduction is generally carried out in a polar solvent such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol or a like<br><br><br>
solvent, and at temperatures of about 0"C to about 100~C. preferably at room temperature. Ir the procedure described by Bhattarcharyya, the intermediate of formula XVII is formed in an ethanol solvent and. without isolation, is reduced to the product of formula I using NaBHj. As an alternative to the aldehyde or ketone intermediates of formula IV, one skilled in the art can also prepare compounds of formula VI (Le_, nitriles), as illustrated in Scheme 2, for use as intermediates in the syntheses of the desired compounds of formula I, using a diphenyl ether formation procedure analogous to that described in Scheme 1. Procedures for preparation of compounds of formula VI can be adapted from those found in the literature. (See, e^, D. C Remy et aL, J. Med. Chem., 1975, 18(2), 142-148; E. A. Schmittling et al., Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1993, 58(12), 3229-3230).<br>
The conversion of the nitriles of formula VI so obtained into the desired products of formula I can be achieved by several routes, as depicted in Scheme 2. For example, the nitrile group of VI can be hydrolyzed under acidic conditions using methods well known to those of skiil in the art, to produce a carboxylic acid derivative of formula VII. (See, e.g., A. I. Meyers et el., Tetrahedron Letters, 1984, 25 (28), 2941; and R. W. Higgins et al., J. Organic Chemistry, 1951, 16, 1275). This carboxylic acid derivative, in turn, can be converted into a carboxamide derivative having the formula VIM using one or more standard methods which are disclosed in the chemical literature, e.g., via reaction of an acid halide prepared from compounds of the formula VII with an amine of general formula HNR'R2. (See R. E. Kent et aL, Organic Synthesis. Coll. Vol. Ill, 1955, 490; and R. M. Herbst et al., Organic Synthesis, Coll, Vol II. 1943, 11 for discussions of the Schotten-Bauman reaction). The resulting carboxamides of the formula VIII, wherein R1 and R2 are hydrogen, can also be prepared directly from the corresponding nitriles of formula VI by specific hydrolysis methods, employing, for example, hydrogen peroxide or strong aqueous alkalis metal salts. (See Chemistry &amp; Industry, 1961, 1987; C. R. Noller, Organic Synthesis, Coll. Vol. II, 1943, 586; and J. H. Hall and M. Gisler, J. Organic Chemistry, 1976, 41, 3769). Subsequently, the carboxamide derivatives of formula VIII may can be reduced using one of a variety of reducing agents available for such conversion, to produce the desired compounds of formula I. (See, e.g., A C. Cope et aL, Organic Synthesis, Coll. Vol. IV, 1963, 339, for use of lithium aluminum hydride in a diethyl ether or THF solvent.) Alternatively, the nitriles of formula VI can be reduced to form the desired compounds of general formula I, wherein R1 and R2are hydrogen, by using one of a variety of reducing agents disclosed in the chemical literature which are selective for this transformation (including catalytic hydrogenation using hydrogen gas and platinum (II) oxide, as described by J. A. Secrist, III and M. W. Logue in J. Organic Chemistry, 1972, 37, 335; hydrazine hydrate and Raney nickel in ethanol, as described by W. W. Zajac, Jr. et al in J. Organic Chemistry, 1971, 36, 3539; and sodium trifluoroacetoxy borohydride in<br><br><br>
THF. as described by N. Umino et al. in Tetrahedron Letters. 1976, 2875). Such reducing agents can also include lithium aluminum hydride in a nonreactive solvent such as diethyl ether or tetrahydrofuran<br>
Finally, the nitriles of formula VI may be converted to the corresponding aldehydes of general formula IV, wherein R3 is hydrogen, using reaction conditions specific for this transformation, such as lithium triethoxyaluminum hydride in a solvent such as THF or diethyl ether, as described by H. C. Brown and C. P. Garg in J. American Chemical Society, 1964, 86, 1085 and by J. Malek and M. Cerny in Svnthesis, 1972. 217.<br>
Using an alternative synthetic pathway, the intermediate carboxylic acids of formula VII (or their methyl or ethyl ester derivatives) can be reduced to their corresponding benzylic alcohols of formula IX. This process is well precedented in the literature and can be accomplished using selective reducing agents such as sodium borohydride (see, e_g_., J. V. B. Kanth et al., J. Organic Chemistry, 1991, 56, 5964), diborane in THF (see, e.g, M. N. Moon et al., J. Organic Chemistry, 1973, 38, 2786), and similar reducing agents.<br>
The alcohols of formula IX so obtained can then be selectively re-oxidized to form the corresponding aldehydes of formula IV (R- = H), for example, using pyridinium chlorochromate in methylene chloride, according to the procedure of E. J. Corey et aL, Tetrahedron Letters, 1975, 31, 2647-2650, or C.-G. Huang, Journal of Organic Chemistry, 1991, 56(16), 4846-4853. The hydroxyl group of the compound of formula IX may be also converted into a more reactive leaving group L2 (e.g., mesylate, triflate), as described in the scientific literature (see, e.g, M. S. Newman et aL, J. Organic Chemistry, 1974, 39, 1036; and E. K. Anderson et aL, Synthesis, 1974, 665), to generate intermediates of the formula X, which can then be reacted with the appropriate amines of formula HNR1R2 to produce the corresponding desired compounds of formula I.<br>
Schemes 3 and 4 illustrate processes that can be used to introduce substituents (R3, R4) at the alpha position of the benzylamine side chain. In Scheme 3, according to the procedure of D.J. Calderwood et aL, (Tetrahedron Letters, 1997, 38(7), 1241-1244), a nitrite of the formula VI or an amide of the formula VIII can be treated with a reagent of the formula R3MJ- (wherein M is a metal such as cerium and J is a halogen such a CI or Br) to produce a compound of the formula | wherein R^R^hydrogen. Such compounds can then be converted to compounds of formula I wherein R1 and R2 are other than hydrogen, for example, via the reductive amination procedures described herein<br>
Alternatively, according to Scheme 4, intermediates of the formula IV can be reacted with, for example, a Grignard reagent (La, R'MgJ) under well established conditions to generate the intermediate alcohols of formula XI. Such alcohols of formula XI may be converted in one of several manners.  For example, the alcohol may be reacted with NaN, in<br><br><br>
aqueous DMF, replacing the OH in formula XI with N:, according to the procedure o Sharpless et al . Tetrahedron Letters, 1996, 37(19), 3219-3222. The azide derivative thus formed can then be reduced to the primary amine of formula I (R'=R2=H) under a variety o conditions, for example, using hydrogen and barium sulfate in ethanol, (A. Guy et al. Synthesis, 1988, 11, 900-904), lithium aluminum hydride in ether (M. Saito et al., Journal o Medicinal Chemistry, 1980, 23(12), 1364) or tributyltin hydride in benzene (J. Wasserman e ai, Journal of American Chemical Society, 1985, 107(2), 519), The primary amine (-NH2 compound of formula I so obtained can be converted to compounds of formula 1 wherein R and R; are other than hydrogen, as described previously.<br>
In addition to the methods described above in Schemes 1 and 2 for the preparation o1 the intermediate aldehydes and ketones of formula IV. other methods exist which can provide compounds of the formula IV. For example, a compound of formula XII, in which the group Z is a hydrogen atom, can be reacted, under conditions of Friedel-Crafts acylation (ej^, AICl3/CH:CU/R3COCI), to produce ketones of the formula IV in which R3 is not hydrogen. This procedure is depicted in Scheme 5 and is well precedented in the scientific literature and familiar to those skilled in the art. The location of the acyl group (COR3) can be determined by the nature and location of the X and/or Y substituents present, as well as the conditions employed for the reaction. In instances where it is desireable to prepare compounds of formula IV (R3 =H), from XII (Z=H), introduction of the aldehyde functional group (CHO) may be achieved using conditions described above for the preparation of the intermediates lla and lib in Scheme 1.<br>
Preparation of compounds of the formula IV wherein R3 = H (L^, aldehydes) can be achieved using one or more of the known procedures for the formylation of aromatic rings, including reacting dichloromethyl methyl ether and titanium (IV) tetrachloride in methylene chloride according to the procedure described by M. L. Mancini et al, Synthetic Communications. 1989, 2001-2007, or H. Chikashita et al., J. Organic Chemistry, 1991, 56, 1692.<br>
Alternatively, reaction of the compounds of formula XII wherein Z is a halogen (e.g., Br, I) with a strong base (e.g., n-sec- or tert-butyl lithium, lithium diisopropylamide) in an inert solvent such as hexane or THF, followed by reaction with a reagent such as N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), will produce aldehydes like those of formula IV. (See G. Voss et al, Chemishe Benchte, 1989, 122, 1199; M. P. Hoyer et al., J. Organic Chemistry, 1986, 51(26), 5106; and N. Eisen et al., Angew. Chem. International Edition, 1986,25(11), 1026).<br>
Another method for the preparation of compounds of formula IV relies on the oxidation of an alkyl group (e_g., CH3, C2H6) at the Z position of compounds of the formula XII. The oxidation can Droaress to the formation of the aldehvde of the formula IV. wherein R3 = H<br><br><br>
'eg F M Hauser et aL. Synthesis. 1987. 723: S D. Carter et aL. Synthesis, 1983, (12), 1000: European Patent 451650, 1991, Bayer AG), or, under more vigorous conditions, can proceed to the formation of a carboxylic acid compound of formula VII, from which it can then be converted into compounds of the formula I, as depicted in Scheme 2. The success of this oxidation procedure will, of course, depend upon the nature and location of any additional substituents X and Y on the compounds of formula XII.<br>
Yet another alternative for the preparation of the intermediates of formula IV is illustrated by Scheme 6. Compounds of the formula XIII, containing a nitro group and prepared according to procedures described by R. Beugelmans et aL (Tetrahedron Letters, 1994, 35(31), 5649-5652), J. H. Clark et aL, (Tetrahedron Letters, 1987, 28(31), 3627) and E. Roberts et aL, (Journal of the Chemical Society, 1925, 127, 2004), can be reduced under conditions disclosed in the chemical literature to the corresponding amine compounds of formula XIV. There reductions can be accomplished using gaseous hydrogen (H2) and a catalyst (ex^, Pd/C, Raney nickel) in an alcohol solvent such as ethanol, at pressures of about one to about 5 atmospheres of H2, or using an in situ reduction using an iron/acetic acid or t'n'hydrochloric acid system to produce the corresponding compounds of formula XIV. These latter intermediates of formula XIV can then be converted, via their diazonium salts (prepared, for example, using NaN02 and aqueous HCI) into the nitriles of formula VI (Le., see H. T. Clarke and R. R. Read, Organic Synthesis, 1941, 514) which may then be converted via the corresponding carboxylic acids of formula VII as shown in Scheme 2 into aldehydes of the general formula IV wherein R3 = H.<br>
The intermediates of formula XIV can also be converted directly into the corresponding aldehydes of formula IV by reacting them with formaldoxime, followed by acid hydrolysis, as described by R.B. Woodward et aL, Tetrahedron, 1958, 2, 1 and W. F. Beech in J. Chemical Society, 1954, 1297.<br>
For the preparation of compounds of the general formula I wherein R2 and R3 taken together with the nitrogen to which R2 is attached and the carbon to which R3 is attached form a nitrogen containing ring, an adaptation of the procedure described by L. S. Bleicher et al (J. Organic Chemistry, 1998, 63, 1109) can be employed, as shown in Scheme 7. Thus, an ester of the general formula IV (R3 = O-alkyl) is reacted with a cyclic lactam of the general formula XXX<br><br><br><br>
where L is a reaction labile group such as -CH=CH:, in the presence of a strong base such as sodium methoxide. to produce the intermediate of general formula XXI. This intermediate can then be converted to the corresponding cyclic imine of formula XXII in the presence of a strong acid, such as hydrochloric acid, usually under reflux conditions. Subsequently, the compounds of formula XXII can be reduced to form the cyclic amines of formula XXIII (wherein R' = H) using, for example, sodium borohydride in methanol as described previously. Such compounds of formula XXIII can further be converted into compounds of the formula XXIII (wherein R: is as defined for compounds of formula I) as previously discussed.<br>
The in vitro activity of the compounds of the present invention at the individual monoamine reuptake sites can be determined using rat synaptosomes or HEK-293 cells transfected with the human serotonin, dopamine or norepinephrine transporter, according to the following procedure adapted from those described by S. Snyder et aL (Molecular Pharmacology, 1971, 7, 66-80), D.T. Wong et aL (Biochemical Pharmacology, 1973, 22, 311-322), H. F. Bradford (Journal of Neurochemistry, 1969, 16, 675-684) and D. J. K. Balfour (European Journal of Pharmacology, 1973, 23, 19-26).<br>
