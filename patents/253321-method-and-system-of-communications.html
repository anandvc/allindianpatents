				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD OP THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to high data rate communica-<br>
tions, and more especially it relates to line of sight,<br>
LOS, multiple input multiple output, MIMO, links, such as<br>
radio links and optical wireless communications links. For<br>
reasons of simplicity elements receiving or emitting elec-<br>
tromagnetic fields are referred to as antenna elements as,<br>
e.g., light emitters and sensors are direct correspondences<br>
in light communications to antenna elements for radio wave<br>
communications.<br>
BACKGROUND AND DESCRIPTION OP RELATED ART<br>
High-speed wireline or fiber optic connections of backbone<br>
networks interconnecting nodes of a terrestrial radio ac-<br>
cess network are previously known. It is also known to in-<br>
terconnect radio base stations with microwave links provid-<br>
ing interconnections of moderate data rates.<br>
Increased antenna area of prior art microwave link antennas<br>
increases signal quality, but also increases irradiated mi-<br>
crowave power as does transmission power increases. An in-<br>
creased antenna area can be achieved by arranging a plural-<br>
ity of smaller area antenna elements in an array.<br>
Efficient modulations and signal constellations offer re-<br>
lieved power requirement, or improved performance if micro-<br>
wave power is maintained, as number of signal points in the<br>
signal constellation increases.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Next generation radio access networks are expected to be<br>
required to support peak user data rates in the order of<br>
magnitude of 30 Mbps - 1 Gbps. With a vast amount of base<br>
stations, it would be advantageous to interconnect base<br>
stations over radio links for flexibly connecting/discon-<br>
necting links of a mobile station active set of radio links<br>
with the base station as the mobile station moves.<br>
Present radio link solutions do not offer sufficient data<br>
rates of aggregate user data, as to/from a base station,<br>
including a plurality of high rate user data links at rea-<br>
sonable power levels for reasonably sized element antenna<br>
apertures.<br>
Consequently, there is a need of antennas of large aper-<br>
tures providing required data rates at reasonable transmis-<br>
sion power for reasonably sized element antenna apertures.<br>
It is consequently an object of the present invention to<br>
achieve an antenna configuration for line of sight communi-<br>
cation useful for providing low error rates at moderate<br>
transmission power within limits as may be required by due<br>
authorities.<br>
It is also an object to achieve a system flexible to dif-<br>
ferent transmission ranges and wavelength ranges.<br>
An object is also to offer high data rates for low trans-<br>
mission power levels as regards antenna properties.<br>
Another object is to achieve an antenna configuration<br>
adapted to particular communications distance and wave-<br>
length.<br><br>
Finally, it is an object to relieve the dependency on tan-<br>
gible interconnections, such as wire lines or optical fi-<br>
bers, for interconnection of base stations or other nodes<br>
of a telecommunications system. Such interconnections are<br>
generally associated with great initial investment costs<br>
and maintenance costs.<br>
These objects are met by a method and system of antennas<br>
configured for a particular communications distance over<br>
line of sight links providing multiple input multiple out-<br>
put communications links.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In backbone networks based on wireless communications it is<br>
important to achieve capacity to handle data rates of ag-<br>
gregate traffic, where individual peak user data rates are<br>
in the order of 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps.<br>
Fixed fiber optical networks are not always applicable.<br>
They are often associated with great costs, provide little<br>
or no flexibility and occupy extensive ground space.<br>
Prior art Multiple Input Multiple Output, MIMO, communica-<br>
tions systems most commonly are designed to utilize scat-<br>
tering and, therefore, requires a scattering environment.<br>
The present invention is not dependent on such scatterers<br>
and suits line of sight communication very well. A theo-<br>
retical reason for this is its exploitation of spherical<br>
wave fronts and associated phase differences.<br>
Figure 2 schematically illustrates propagation paths and<br>
principles of the invention. Respective propagation paths<br>
«P11», «p12», P13 between a transmitter antenna «T1» and<br>
receiver antennas «R1», «R2», «R3» differ slightly in length<br>
due to a spherical wave front property of the transmitted<br>
signal. The small differences in path lengths «δ11», «δ12»,<br>
«δ13» add to the communications distance D. With path pij as<br><br>
a reference for the communications distance, δij equals zero.<br>
I.e. when p11 is selected as reference then δ11-0. The an-<br>
tenna configuration according to the invention essentially<br>
maximizes MEMO channel capacity for great signal to noise<br>
ratios, SNR, in respect of the spherical wave front prop-<br>
erty for LOS communications. This is in contrast to, e.g.,<br>
maximizing antenna directivity as illustrated in and ex-<br>
plained in relation to figure 14 below.<br>
With each MIMO sub-channel operating close to its maximum<br>
theoretical performance, according to the configuration of<br>
the invention, great performance gains are achieved.<br>
Figure 3 illustrates example capacity versus SNRSISO for LOS<br>
MIMO and non-LOS MIMO (fading uncorrelated channels) for a<br>
four-element linear array. For the comparison illustrated<br>
in figure 3, non-LOS MIMO array antenna elements are as-<br>
sumed to be placed such that the antenna elements experi-<br>
ence channels with no or negligible cross correlation. In<br>
a typical local scattering environment, this is achieved by<br>
placing the antenna elements separated by half a wave-<br>
length. The illustrated capacity of LOS MIMO is achieved<br>
for a system according to the invention. The gain of LOS<br>
MIMO as compared to non-LOS MIMO in terms of capacity in-<br>
crease or SNR gain is the vertical or horizontal difference<br>
between the curves, respectively. The SNR gain implies,<br>
e.g., increased noise immunity or reduced transmission<br>
power requirement.<br>
Radio Access Networks, RAM's, are frequently realized with<br>
base stations connected in series, with at least one of the<br>
serialized base stations serving as an anchor to the core<br>
network. Consequently, the individual links between base<br>
stations may carry data traffic of a plurality of base sta-<br>
tions. With individual peak user data-rates in the range<br><br>
of 100 Mbps - 1 Gbps required peak rates of data links be-<br>
tween base stations could be expected to be in the range of<br>
1-100'6bps.<br>
Prior art radio data links is not known to provide data<br>
rates of more than one Gbps for the spectrum efficiency<br>
achieved with the invention. The major two reasons for<br>
this are that there are practical limits on signal constel-<br>
lation sizes, practical and regulatory constraints on<br>
available radio spectrum, and power limits.<br>
Prior art relies upon uncorrelated channels between the<br>
various antenna elements. This could e.g. be the case for<br>
channels fading due to scattering. The presumption, how-<br>
ever, normally does not hold for LOS communications over<br>
wireless links, such as e.g. radio links. However, the in-<br>
vention points out that exploitation of the spherical prop-<br>
erty of wave fronts results in ideal MIMO gain in absence<br>
of scatterers. According to the invention rectangular or<br>
square grid LOS MIMO antenna array and linear LOS MIMO an-<br>
tenna arrays are preferred, see figures 4 and 6 respec-<br>
tively. This does not exclude circular or hexagonal pack-<br>
ing as a means to increase antenna elements surface density<br>
as illustrated in figures 9 and 10 respectively. In the<br>
hexagonal packing of figure 9 the respective distances be-<br>
tween (at most 6) nearest neighboring antenna elements «An-<br>
tenna element» are all essentially equal «d». Spatially<br>
oversampled and clustered antenna arrays, see figure 8 and<br>
11 respectively, are preferred for some situations. Fig-<br>
ures 12 and 13 show some other clustered directional hy-<br>
brids for 16 antenna elements «Antenna element».<br>
With reference to figures 11-13, while the total number of<br>
antenna elements, N, are kept constant equal to 16 elements<br>
the respective number of groups of elements, k {1<k of></k><br>
the figures varies. In figure 11 there are eight groups<br>
with two antenna elements «Antenna element» each. Within<br>
each group the antenna elements ^Antenna element* are posi-<br>
tioned sufficiently close for signals to add coherently in<br>
phase, thereby generating a directivity gain. Figure 13<br>
illustrates an example realization with four groups, each<br>
of four antenna elements «Antenna element &gt;. In figure 13,<br>
an example for N=16 and k=2 is illustrated. In the figures<br>
each group of antenna elements «Antenna element &gt; generates<br>
a MIMO sub-channel. With N/k antenna elements for each MIMO<br>
sub-channel on receiver and transmitter side, the total<br>
achievable gain is (N/k)2, since both sides contribute to<br>
the gain. If equivalent isotropic radiated power, EIRP, is<br>
at its maximum level allowed, the gain at transmitter side<br>
is achieved as a reduction of transmit power and not in in-<br>
creased received power or energy per symbol. Assuming an<br>
SNR gain of (N/k)2 fox grouped directional antennas with k<br>
groups, equations (1) and (2) transform into<br><br>
There are SNR ranges where MIMO communications with clus-<br>
tered elements antennas outperform MIMO with the same num-<br>
ber of antenna elements, not being clustered. As noted in<br>
figure 14 a channel capacity increase is achieved with<br>
clustering particularly for poor transmission conditions<br>
(small SNR). Figure 14, plots the channel capacity per<br>
bandwidth Ccluatered /B for MIMO communications with clustered<br>
antenna elements versus SNR «SNRSISO» normalized to SISO com-<br>
munications conditions, and where k is the number of clus-<br>
ters of antenna elements at transmitter and receiver ends,<br>
ke[l,N]. The figure illustrates performance for an example<br>
of 16 antenna elements according to equation (5), with SISO<br><br>
performance of N=1 antenna element antennas included for<br>
reference.<br>
Typically high SNR conditions prevail in short range commu-<br>
nications . Consequently, gain increase by unclustered MIMO<br>
communications with great number of antenna elements is<br>
preferred for short-range communications.<br>
For high SNR, the MIMO channel capacity in (4) is approxi-<br>
mate to<br><br>
where f is a monotonically increasing function of one vari-<br>
able and |.| denotes absolute value. (Equations (4) and (6)<br>
turn out to be maximized by the same maximizing channel ma-<br>
trix, H=Hopt.) The inventors observe that the channel ma-<br>
trix H can be separated into a Xronecker product of two ma-<br>
trices, Hv and Hh.<br><br>
where Hv is of dimension NVXNV and Hy is of dimension NhxNh,<br>
Nv being the number of vertical antenna elements and Nh be-<br>
ing the number of horizontal antenna elements. The deter-<br>
minant in equation (6) then rewrites<br><br>
A further observation according to the invention is that<br>
each of Hv and Hh can be separated<br><br>
where the determinants<br><br><br>
and that the matrices Hv12 and HH12 are Vandermonde matrices.<br>
In a final step of observing it is noted that<br><br>
In equations (13). and (14) , the maximum is attained for<br>
vertical and horizontal distances dv and dh, respectively,<br><br>
For a generalized rectangular grid array with Nh elements in<br>
each row and Ny elements in each column, communicating at a<br>
frequency corresponding to wavelength λ over a communica-<br>
tions distance D, the optimum antenna elements distances in<br>
equation (15) and (16) converts to antenna dimensions equal<br>
to<br><br>
Figure 5 illustrates an example rectangular array with four<br>
rows and three columns of elements, each row comprising an-<br>
tenna elements separated a distance dh, and each column com-<br>
prising antenna elements separated distance dv. According<br>
to the invention the preferred antenna element distances<br><br>
are determined in accordance with equations (15) and (16) .<br>
The dimension (WidthXHeight) of the antenna array is then<br><br>
In figure 6, for an optimum MIMO system and for a communi-<br>
cations distance D much greater' than element separation d<br>
the distance a=d(N-1) is specified by<br><br>
where the approximation in equation (20) holds for great<br>
number of antenna elements N. For N=16 antenna elements<br>
«Antenna element&gt;, the approximation error is about 7%.<br>
Table 1 illustrates element separation, d, of a transmitter-<br>
receiver pair of linear MIMO antennas versus communications<br>
distance, D, at some example wavelengths, X, equal to 3 mm,<br>
7.9 mm and 42 .9 mm.<br><br>
For the square grid LOS MIMO antenna array in figure 4, the<br>
distance a, corresponding to that of equation (19) for lin-<br>
ear arrays, is determined to <br><br><br>
where the approximation in equation (22) holds for great<br>
number of antenna elements N. For N=16 antenna elements<br>
«Antenna element&gt;, the approximation error is about 33%.<br>
An important observation is that for the square grid LOS<br>
MIMO antenna array in figure 4 the distances a and d get<br>
relatively smaller in proportion to the fourth root of N,<br>
whereas for the linear array of figure 6 the distance de-<br>
pendency is proportional to the square root of N.<br>
With the antenna area A=a2, and using the approximation in<br>
equation (22), the MIMO channel capacity, CMiIMO=N.CSISO, ex-<br>
pressed in terms of channel capacity for a SISO system,<br>
CSISO, with the example design of figure 4 according to the<br>
invention is<br><br>
In figure 4 and equation (21) the antenna elements «Antenna<br>
elements are assumed to be electrically active elements,<br>
supplying a voltage or current to a receiver. However, as<br>
illustrated below basically the same distance relations<br>
hold for antenna elements being directors guiding received<br>
electromagnetic field to electrically active antenna ele-<br>
ments .<br>
Figure 7 illustrates an equilateral triangular antenna<br>
realization according to an embodiment of the invention.<br>
The antenna elements are all separated by dtd. Similarly to<br><br>
the rectangular realization in figure 5, the optimum an-<br>
tenna element separation of the equilateral triangular an-<br>
tenna structure with three antenna elements equals <br>
where D is communication distance and λ is communication<br>
wavelength.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates a realization with director elements<br>
«Director»- direct electromagnetic fields received and elec-<br>
tromagnetic fields to be transmitted, preferably with one<br>
director per electrically active antenna element «Active<br>
elements &gt;. Preferably the directors «Director» are pure<br>
reflectors but can also be made of dielectric material.<br>
The supports «Supports» are designed not to shadow, or only<br>
have a small shadowing impact on, the electrically active<br>
antenna elements «Active elements&gt;. The positioning of the<br>
directors is preferably in accordance with equation (19)<br>
and (21) for a linear and square grid LOS MIMO antenna re-<br>
spectively. The relevant distance d is essentially equal to<br>
the separation distance of the projection of the directors<br>
onto a plane, the plane being perpendicular to the LOS<br>
transmission path to the other receiver/transmitter end.<br>
Advantages achieved by the realization of figure 15 in<br>
addition to those mentioned above are, e.g., simplified<br>
wiring of the antenna elements and the antenna elements<br>
spanning a smaller distance range thereby being mechani-<br>
cally robust. Also, by adjusting the directors the elec-<br>
trically active antenna elements need not always be reposi-<br>
tioned even if communications distance changes.<br>
The dependency of α, A and dv/dh/d on D for an LOS MIMO an-<br>
tenna has practical implications, addressed by the inven-<br>
tion. An obvious solution to the problem of getting a, to<br>
the communications distance D, appropriately matched ele-<br><br>
ment distance, dv, dh, d, is to manufacture custom-made an-<br>
tennas. From a cost perspective, however, a more attrac-<br>
tive solution is manufacturing of a set of antenna models<br>
for MIMO communications, each designed for a range of com-<br>
munications distances D, and upon installation selecting an<br>
antenna model within the set that best matches the communi-<br>
cations distance. For frequency non-selective channels,<br>
SVD (singular value decomposition) provides robustness and<br>
close to optimum performance also with non-perfect matching<br>
of communications distance, D, and element separation, dv,<br>
dh, d. Another embodiment is realized by individually ad-<br>
justable antenna elements. Preferably this is realised by<br>
a grid «Grid» of interconnected rods or tensed wires to<br>
which the antenna elements «Antenna element» are attached<br>
as illustrated in figure 16. The wires or rods are pref-<br>
erably connected to a frame «Frame». Models that are elec-<br>
tromechanically adjustable comprise electromechanical mo-<br>
tors to which the rods are connected, such that the rods to<br>
which the antenna elements «Antenna element» are attached<br>
may move along the frame. A further embodiment of adapting<br>
an LOS MIMO antenna to communications distance D uses spa-<br>
tial oversampled antennas as schematically illustrated in<br>
figure 8 and activating the antenna elements by signal<br>
processing providing best performance at actual communica-<br>
tions distance. The particular element distribution may be<br>
varied, e.g. as illustrated in figures 9 and 10, An impor-<br>
tant issue of the invention is that active elements are<br>
distributed such that their mutual distances reflects com-<br>
munications distance (distance between transmit and receive<br>
antennas) and wavelength such that the spherical properties<br>
of the radio wave can be exploited.<br>
It is observed that as transmitter and receiver antennas<br>
form an antenna pair for a communications link, the respec-<br><br>
tive element distances dv, dh and d in e.g. equations (15)<br>
and (16) of an example transmitter antenna can be reduced<br>
(or increased) if the element distance of a corresponding<br>
example receiver antenna of the communications link is in-<br>
creased (or reduced) in proportion to the distance reduc-<br>
tions (or increase) of the transmitter antenna. Indexing<br>
distances of transmitter and receiver antennas by T and R,<br>
respectively, if respective element distances of a receiver<br>
antenna, dvR., dhR and dR, are reduced (or increased) in rela-<br>
tion to an initially determined distance dv, dh or d1<br>
transmitter-side antenna-element distance, dvT, dhT and dr,<br>
should be increased (or reduced) in proportion thereto (in<br>
relation to dv, dh and d) , Consequently, the distances dv, dh<br>
in equations (15) and (16) are the geometrical averages of<br>
receiver and transmitter antenna element distances, respec-<br>
tively.<br>
The actual antenna dimensions in equations (17) and (18),<br>
of course, are determined by actual respective vertical and<br>
horizontal element distances. Correspondingly, also an-<br>
tenna dimensioning in equations (19) and (21) are deter-<br>
mined by actual distances, if adjusted as described above.<br>
At transmitter side equations (17), (18), (19) and (21)<br>
translate to equations (24), (25), (26) and (27)<br><br>
and correspondingly for receiver side, they translate to<br>
equations (28), (29), (30) and (31)<br><br><br>
where<br><br>
The invention does not only cover planar antenna configura-<br>
tions, but also three-dimensional configurations as illus-<br>
trated in figures 17-19. Figure 17 illustrates a two-layer<br>
square grid LOS MIMO antenna with two layers of antenna<br>
elements each on a square grid. Figures 18 and 19 illus-<br>
trate realisations with equal distance between all nearest<br>
neighboring antenna elements. In figure 18 the antenna<br>
elements are positioned to the vertices of a cube and in<br>
figure 19 the antenna elements are positioned to the verti-<br>
ces of a tetrahedron.<br>
Various embodiments of the invention also cover different<br>
realizations of signal processing at transmitter and re-<br>
ceiver ends. The processing is necessary for adaptation to<br>
prevalent channel conditions. At receiver or transmit<br>
side, determining channel singular values as described in<br>
relation to equation (3) and singular value decomposition<br>
can be achieved by digital signal processing of base band<br>
signals. If determined at transmitter side, information on<br>
channel matrix, H, need to be transferred from receiver<br><br>
side, or the channel matrix otherwise estimated at trans-<br>
mitter side, see figure. For a 2X2 channel matrix, singu-<br>
lar value decomposition can also be achieved by a 3-dB hy-<br>
brid to perform multiplication or weighting as need be, op-<br>
erating on high-frequency signals. Also, for channel ma-<br>
trices greater than 2X2 a generalization of a 3-dB hybrid,<br>
a Butler matrix directional coupler, may be used. A fur-<br>
ther embodiment realizes the processing by means of an ar-<br>
rangement of microstrip or waveguides, also operating on<br>
high-frequency signals. At receiver side, channel equali-<br>
zation requires processing. This processing can be per-<br>
formed by any of the processing realizations described for<br>
transmitter side, or received signal can be equalized by<br>
means of zero forcing, for which the received signal being<br>
multiplied by the inverse matrix of channel matrix H, or by<br>
means of minimum mean square error, MMSS, for which the<br>
mean square error is minimized, the various processing re-<br>
alizations giving rise to further embodiments.<br>
If there is multipath propagation, this is preferably in-<br>
corporated into the singular value decomposition at trans-<br>
mitter side through feedback information. Corresponding<br>
information can also be derived through channel reciprocity<br>
if the reverse direction channel matrix is determined at<br>
transmitter side (the transmitter side also comprising ra-<br>
dio receiver). Another solution comprises a self-tuning<br>
antenna, optimizing performance at receiver side, transmit-<br>
ter side or both. The antenna element positioning is then<br>
adapted to channel propagation properties corresponding to<br>
a measured channel matrix, H. This can be achieved by,<br>
e.g. a stochastic gradient algorithm. Particularly for<br>
fixed positioned antenna elements, they may require the an-<br>
tenna elements to be re-distributed for optimum perform-<br>
ance. For an electromechanically adjustable element an-<br><br>
tenna the optimization can be achieved by automatic posi-<br>
tion adjustments of the antenna elements. The different<br>
solutions to multipath propagation can also be combined.<br>
Preferably and in accordance with the invention, singular<br>
value decomposition is applied, to flat (frequency non-<br>
selective) fading channels. If a channel nevertheless is<br>
frequency-selective fading, the channel can be considered<br>
piecewise flat fading for sufficiently small frequency in-<br>
tervals. Such piecewise flat fading channels can, e.g., be<br>
achieved by dividing a given frequency range or bandwidth,<br>
using orthogonal-frequencies sub-carriers of sufficiently<br>
narrow one or more bandwidths for the one or more band-<br>
widths to be much less than the coherence bandwidth. One<br>
technique for achieving such sub-carriers is orthogonal<br>
frequency division multiplex, OFDM.<br>
The concept of the present invention combines well with<br>
other known means to increase throughput, such as transmis-<br>
sion at both vertical and horizontal polarization or trans-<br>
mission at left-hand and right-hand circular polarization,<br>
or different coding of different sub-channels depending on<br>
their respective channel quality, which further demon-<br>
strates the usefulness of the invention. Such combinations<br>
are also within the scope of this invention.<br>
Dimensioning has been expressed in relation to particular<br>
orientation, e.g. horizontal or vertical orientation, re-<br>
ferring to orthogonal directions, perpendicular to the di-<br>
rection of communications. However, this does not exclude<br>
rotation of receiver and transmitter antennas in a plane<br>
parallel to the antenna elements, with corresponding rota-<br>
tion of both antennas such that their mutual orientation is<br>
preserved. Despite somewhat inappropriate, the notation of<br>
vertical and horizontal is kept for reasons of simplicity.<br><br>
The invention is not intended to be limited only to the em-<br>
bodiments described in detail above. Changes and modifica-<br>
tions may be made without departing from the invention. It<br>
