				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an apparatus for examining a Gemstone and a method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is important to be able to determine whether a polished gemstone is an untreated, natural diamond. It is possible to make gemstone diamonds synthetically. It is also possible to subject natural diamonds to high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) treatment, or to subject natural diamonds to irradiation treatment, to increase their value, for instance by enhancing their colour.<br>
The present invention relates to an instrument for indicating or determining whether a polished gemstone is a natural diamond which has not been subjected to irradiation treatment and/or is an untreated natural diamond which has not been subjected to HPHT treatment. Such a determination can be made in the laboratory by irradiating the gemstone so that the gemstone emits photoluminescence spectra, and analysing the spectra. Such a procedure is discussed in a publication by Adamas Gemological Laboratory under the title"SAS2000 RAMAN Spectra"on their website http ://www. gis. net/-adamas/raman. html. Another such procedure is disclosed in a paper by Fisher et al in"Gems &amp; Gemology", Spring 2000, pages 42 to 49.<br>
The use of photoluminescence spectra is a good technique for detecting minor atomic impurities and other defects in a crystal lattice, but is very insensitive at room temperature. If the temperature of the gemstone is reduced to liquid nitrogen temperatures (about-196° C), sensitivity levels can be improved by orders of magnitude in some cases, and such a level of sensitivity may be required in order to detect whether a diamond is synthetic or not or whether certain diamonds have been treated in order to improve their colour. However, providing liquid nitrogen temperatures is a laboratory facility and not available in retail premises. The facility is usually a costly cryostat such as that disclosed in WO 01/33203 A. A modern commercial cryostat is expected to<br>
provide a controlled, pre-selected temperature which is continuously variable at will up to room temperature and beyond. In general, commercially-available cryostats involve evacuating the sample space in order to avoid condensation. Although some liquid nitrogen cryostats can be small, they require gas flow systems and vacuum pumps, adding complexity and requiring time for evacuation. Peltier-cooled and Joule- Thomson cryostats can be small, but they are fragile and expensive; Joule-Thomson cryostats also need high pressure gases in order to operate. In addition, the lasers would normally be gas lasers which are relatively large, cumbersome and expensive. Overall the equipment requires high skill in use.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome or ameliorate at least one of the disadvantages of the prior art, or to provide a useful alternative.<br>
It is desirable to provide an instrument that can be used by jewellers, which therefore must not require high levels of skill, be relatively inexpensive, be easy to manipulate, and be quick to use, whilst accepting that the instrument will not be able to detect all categories of diamonds with complete accuracy. The primary aim is to significantly reduce the number of gemstones requiring more intensive and time- consuming examination on more sophisticated equipment.<br>
THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides an instrument as set forth in Claim 1,2,3,39 or 40 and a method as set forth in Claim 41,42 or 43. Claims 24 to 38 and 44 to 46 claim preferred and/or optional features of the invention.<br>
The instrument of the invention can be robust, compact, easy and quick to use and relatively inexpensive, and can thus be used by jewellers without the employment of high skill or difficult manipulative actions, although the instrument can also be used in gemmological laboratories.<br>
Unlike conventional cryostats, the instrument of the invention involves neither a vacuum system nor a thermoelectric cooler. It employs a very simple way of avoiding condensation problems. The sample gemstone can be immersed directly in a cryogen (i. e. a cryogenic liquid or liquefied gas) and held within a bath of the cryogen in the thermally-insulated container. The size of the container and its thermal insulation can be designed such that cryogen hold times of a few minutes to several tens of minutes can be achieved. In order to prevent condensation forming on the window, the cryogen bath is not allowed to run dry during the measurement period. A cryogen bath can be much smaller, cheaper and quicker to use than a conventional cryostat, and the arrangement can be such that little manipulative skill is required, in particular by using a special holding part for holding the gemstone against the window.<br>
The preferred cryogen is liquid nitrogen as it is readily available and safe to use. However, with proper precautions, liquid oxygen can be used and provides a temperature only about 10° C higher than that of liquid nitrogen. In general, any suitable liquefied gas or gas mixture can be used, provided it has a temperature below about minus 100°, preferably below about minus 120°, more preferably below about minus 150° or about minus 160° C ; for detecting HPHT treated stones, the maximum temperature is about minus 100°C.<br>
The invention enables rapid photoluminescence measurements to be made at temperatures lower than minus 100°C. Measurement times may extend from a few seconds to a few tens of seconds. In one example using liquid nitrogen, the instrument can be operated at the rate of fifteen to twenty seconds per sample, topping up the container with liquid nitrogen every fifteen minutes-this compares with fifteen to thirty minutes per sample using conventional laboratory equipment such as that disclosed in WO 01/33203 A. After measurement, the photoluminescence spectra are analysed using the processor, which will have a suitable algorithm, and the result is displayed on the screen. In view of the speedy examination, the instrument of the<br>
invention may be particularly useful in gemmological laboratories, which typically examine hundreds of diamonds per day.<br>
The instrument of the invention cannot infallibly determine whether a polished gemstone is an untreated diamond which has not been subjected to HPHT treatment. The instrument will detect as referrals (i. e. reject) all untreated synthetic diamonds and also HPHT treated natural or synthetic diamonds. However, it will also detect as referrals about 15% to 30% of untreated natural type II diamonds. Nonetheless, the instrument can be very useful in practice, particularly if associated with one or more other instruments for testing gemstones, such as the DiamondSure 1 instrument (as in WO 91/16617) or the DiamondSure 2 instrument (as in WO 91/16617 but modified to make broader spectral measurements). The instrument of the invention is regarded as a predicting or screening instrument, rather than an HPHT treatment detector, the aim of the invention being to significantly reduce the number of stones that required detailed and time-consuming investigation on more sophisticated spectroscopic equipment.<br>
The instrument of the invention is primarily designed to screen for natural type II diamonds that have undergone HPHT treatment in order to reduce their colour. For this application, the diamonds would have been previously screened in order to identify them as both natural and type II, i. e. to reject all that are synthetic or are not type II natural diamonds. Type II diamond is defined as that which exhibits no absorption in the so-called 'defect-induced-one-phonon' region of the infra-red spectrum between 500 and 1500 cm-1. The type may be determined from a measurement of the infra-red spectrum in this region or by use of the DiamondSure 2 instrument. As the DiamondSure2 instrument refers (i. e. rejects) both natural and synthetic type II diamonds, referrals from the DiamondSure 2 instrument are tested in order to determine whether they are synthetic; alternatively standard gemmological techniques may be applied.<br>
The instrument of the invention will also refer all HPHT treated natural type 1 diamonds (type I is defined as that which exhibits absorption due to nitrogen impurities in the defect-induced-one-phonon region). However a relatively large number of untreated natural type I diamonds will also be referred, so the instrument of the invention is not as efficient in detecting HPHT treatment of natural type I diamond.<br>
If the instrument of the invention is used to detect just irradiation treatment, no pre-screening with other instruments is necessary. All types of diamond have the 741 nm zero phonon line when they have been irradiated.<br>
The instrument of the invention can be programmed merely to indicate whether the gemstone is an untreated natural diamond or not. Thus the instrument can be programmed to classify the gemstones in two categories, namely" pass" (i. e. an indication that the gemstone is an untreated natural diamond which has not been subjected to irradiation treatment or to HPHT treatment), and" refer", and if the "refer" category is indicated, the ratios of relevant spectral features can be given, to aid further sorting. Alternatively, the instrument can be programmed to give considerably more information, such as whether the gemstone is a diamond at all, or is a synthetic diamond or a synthetic diamond/natural diamond doublet (which can be produced by the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of synthetic diamond on a natural diamond), or is a natural diamond which has been irradiated and/or has undergone HPHT treatment to improve its colour. In this case, the instrument can display one of three possible results, as follows :-<br>
"pass"-no further testing is required and the sample can be taken as natural and untreated;<br>
"refer"-more sophisticated spectroscopic testing will be required since a small percentage of natural untreated type II diamonds also give this result (in addition to all HPHT treated natural and synthetic diamonds);<br>
"refer with a numerical result giving the intensity ratios of certain spectroscopic features"-the numerical result displayed may be sufficient to determine the sample as HPHT treated without the need for more sophisticated spectroscopic measurements (the usefulness of such intensity ratios has been described in e. g. the Fisher et al paper referred to above).<br>
Whilst the instrument will give a "refer "result for all synthetic diamond, HPHT treated synthetic diamond can be explicitly identified by the observation of unique spectroscopic features.<br>
It is possible to arrange the instrument such that the diamond Raman line and its magnitude are detected, and in this way photoluminescence features of interest may be normalised to make the technique more quantitative. The magnitude of the Raman line varies according to the size of the gemstone or the cut characteristics of the gemstone, and the luminescence features can be ratioed in accordance with the Raman magnitude to reduce the effect of the size or cut of the gemstone.<br>
The instrument may be useful if there is only one laser and only one wavelength of irradiation. However, it is preferred to provide irradiation of two different wavelengths, and in order to do this, it is preferred to provide two lasers, and preferably two spectrometers. The spectrometers can cover two different but overlapping wavelength regions. In theory, it is possible to use non-coherent or broadband radiation for irradiating the gemstone to produce the photoluminescence spectra, though highly monochromatic radiation is required to produce the Raman line referred to above.<br>
The window can be formed by the end of the fibre optic cable or cables, which may be surrounded by a ferrule. The ferrule and the fibre should have a low thermal mass and to be able to withstand the thermal cycles. Normally, there would be only one window in the container, although in theory it would be possible to have more than<br>
one, one being coupled to the laser (s) and the other being coupled to the spectrometer (s). In practice, the window will normally be in the very bottom of the container as the diamond can be placed easily in position and can rest by gravity on the window. However in theory the window could be in the side of the container though it would be awkward and special holding means would be required.<br>
The thermally-insulated container can have a depth of less than about 50 mm or about 30 mm and a plan-view area of less than about 5000 mm or 4000 mm2 or even less than about 400 mm2. The power rating of the laser, or of the first or second laser, may be less than about 100 mW, say between about 10 and about 50 mW. One of the lasers can be a diode laser and extremely small, of a size less than about 10x10 mm.<br>
The other lasers can have diameters of less than 30 mm and lengths of less than 200 mm or even less than 75 mm. The spectrometer can have dimensions less than about 150 x 200 x 50 mm. The instrument can have a height of about 150 mm or less, say about 150 mm or about 100 mm, and an outside plan-view length of less than about 550 and an outside plan-view width of less than about 250 or about 200 mm.<br><br>

The Instrument of Figures 1 to 6<br>
The instrument-has a frame 1 which acts as a support structure to mount the other components in order to provide a self-contained, stand-alone instrument. The frame 1 is open at the sides, to provide access, and is covered by a removable plastics housing Ia (see Figures 5 and 6) which encloses most of the components. The frame 1 comprises a cover Ia and a base plate 1b bolted to die cover la and to which most of the components are bolted. A thermally-insulated cylindrical (elongate cross-section) thermoplastic thin-walled container or cryogen bath 2 is mounted in the top of the frame 1. The bath 2 is within a cylinder 2a of expanded rigid foam such as polystyrene, acting as thermal insulation. The bath 2 is for receiving liquid nitrogen 3 and a polished gemstone 4 to be examined; the bath 2 has to be of a suitable size to receive the largest diamond expected and sufficient quantity of liquid nitrogen; it is of elongate shape in order to maximise its plan view area while keeping the front to back dimension of the instrument as small as possible. The bath 2 has a window 5 in its bottom, upon which a facet, preferably the table, of the gemstone 4 is to be placed. The both 2 has an elliptical cover or sample chamber lid 6. There is a downwards projection or holder pin 8 for holding and centering the gemstone 4 against the window 5.<br>
The pin 8 is a rigid tube of low thermal mass, having an inner diameter of typically 1 to 3 mm, and is made of a suitable engineering thermoplastic which resists the temperature of liquid nitrogen. The pin 8 is in the form of a sliding member with e.g. a friction fit or a simple sliding fit, to accommodate gemstones of different heights (table-to-culet point distances). The arrangement is such that the culet of the gemstone 4 can be pressed into the lower end of the pin 8, and eimer held in position by friction or by an adhesive material such as "BIu-Tac", prior to lowering the pin 8 into liquid nitrogen already in the bath 2 until the table of the gemstone 4 contacts the window 5.<br>
The top part of the instrument, including the bath 2, cover 6 and projection 8, are described in more detail below.<br>
The frame 1 contains a first, compact solid state (green) laser 9 as well as a second (red) laser 10. The frame 1 also contains two compact and sensitive CCD spectrometers 11a, 11b, sensitive in a suitable range or ranges. The lasers 9,10 and the spectrometers 1 Ia, 1 1b are bolted to the base plate lb. The lasers 9,10 and the spectrometers 11a, 11b are coupled by individual fibre optic cables 12, 13,14a, 14bor a single quadro-furcated fibre optic cable to the window 5. The window 5 is formed by the ends of the fibre optic cables 12,13,14a, 14b, or the end of the single cable, which terminate or terminates in the plane of the bottom of the bath 2. In this way, the lasers 9,10 are coupled to the window 5, for irradiating the gemstone 4 with radiation of two different wavelengths, and the spectrometers 1 Ia, 11b are coupled to the window 5 for sensing photoluminescence spectra emitted by the gemstone 4 and giving corresponding spectral data signals at their outputs. The ends of the fibre optic cables 12,13,14a, 14b are surrounded by a very thin e.g. steel ferrule (not shown) retained in a spool-shaped retainer 15. An alternative is to have a smaller hole in the bottom of the bath 2 and omit the retainer 15. The retainer 15 and fibre optic cables 12,13,14a, 14b have a low thermal mass (i.e. in general are thin or of small diameter) and can withstand thermal shock. Preferably a single fibre forming each of tbe cables 13,14a, 14b is surrounded at the window 5 by a bundle of fibres forming part of the excitation cable 12 from the laser 9. The fibres of the excitation cable 12, and optionally of all the cables 12,13,14a, 14b, are preferably all of about 250 micron or about 200 micron, or less, in diameter.<br>
There are blocking filters shown schematically at 16a, 16b between the window 5 and the spectrometers 11a, 11b, for filtering out radiation at the wavelength of the irradiating radiation, e.g. blocking the wavelength of the laser 9,10 in whose wavelength region the particular spectrometer 11b, 11b detects. There is a simple arrangement for switching between the two lasers 9,10. For safety, the excitation cable 12 has a mechanical shutter (not shown) in front of it, arranged such that the shutter is closed when the cover 6 is open. The laser 10 has an electronic safety device (not shown) actuated by a positive-break micro-switch associated with the cover 6, which de-energises the laser 10 when the cover 6 is open.<br>
The output of the spectrometers 11a, 11b are connected to a processor in the form of an electronic control board on a printed circuit base 17 bolted to the base plate 1b for analysing the spectral data from the spectrometer and determining whether the gemstone 4 is an untreated natural diamond, etc. The processor is connected to a display 18 for displaying information indicating whether the gemstone 4 is an untreated natural diamond or an irradiated diamond or a synthetic diamond. The display 18 can give numerical or text results. Manual control members in the form of control buttons 19,20 are indicated schematically.<br>
Figures 3 and 4 show details of parts immediately associated with the bath 2. There is a platform 31 which is fixed to the cover Iaso that it fits over the top of the bath 2 and the insulation cylinder 2a. The platform 31 carries a pivot block 32 mounting a pivot pin 33 on which is pivoted an arm 34 fixed to the sample chamber lid 6. The arm 34 has a tail 35 (see Figure 1) provided with a number of holes for connection to the mechanical shutter (not shown) in front of the laser 9 so that the laser 9 is occulted when the lid 6 is open;<br>
The platform 31 has two upwardly-projecting pins 36, over which pass holes on the ends of a removable sample holder 37. The sample holder 37 has an integral sample holder cover or lid 38, through which the holder pin 8 passes as a simple sliding fit (though it could be a friction fit), the pin 8 having a collar 39 at its top end, for manipulation. The sample holder 37 has knurling on the sides of its ends, and can be simply manipulated by gripping the sides of the ends between the thumb and forefinger of each of the hands, to place the holder 37 over the pins 36.<br>
As can be seen in Figures 1 and 3, there is an apertured plate 41 engaging the top edge of the bath 2, with a large central hole and other holes for the passage of the gasified cryogen. The plate 41 reduces the danger of the user putting a finger in the cryogen 3 in the bath 2. As can be seen in Figure 1, the sample holder lid 38 registers with the large central opening in the plate 41, but is just above it.<br>
A rear cover 42 is shown for protecting the rear of the laser 9. The housing Is is held on the base plate Is by two screws (not shown), and has suitable openings for the lid 6, the display 18, the control buttons 19,20 and the rear cover 42.<br>

processor:    Texas TMS320 F206 single chip integrated circuit 16 bit with 32 kwords of programmable memory and 9 kwords of storage memory, with other components on a printed circuit board 17. of roughly 235 x 160 mm size;<br>
display 18:      Liquid crystal device with 2 lines and 24 characters on each line, forming the front panel of the printed circuit board above, the display measuring approximately 105 x 30 mm;<br>
weight:    Less than 3 kg, i.e. a readily portable, self-contained, stand-alone instrument;<br>
operation:  The Fisher et al paper referred to above can be consulted for spectroscopic details relating to HPHT treatments. The instrument of the invention detects luminescence features with zero-phonon lines at 575 nm, 637 nm and 737 nm. These lines are typically characteristic of diamond grown by CVD methods. The instrument can also detect features characteristic of some synthetic diamond grown by HPHT syntheses. These features arise from atomic cobalt and nickel related impurities and have luminescence peaks at 580.4 nm, 720 nm, 753 nm and 793 nm. The instrument also detects a zero phonon line at 741 nm (the GR1 band) which is characteristic of diamond that has been subjected to irradiation treatment. HPHT treatment can be determined from the ratio of the intensities of the 575 nm and 637 nm features. The instrument can also be designed to detect a feature at 987 nm (the H2 band), whose presence determines that a type I diamond has undergone HPHT treatment in order to affect its colour. The instrument of the invention can furthermore detect the first-order Raman Stokes line arising from irradiation at a frequency of 532 nm or 655 nm, and use the height of the line to normalise the amplitude of the photoluminescence signals to give quantitative results for the photoluminescence spectra.<br>
The instrument of Figures 1 to 6 is arranged to display one of three possible results, namely "pass", "refer" and "refer with a numerical result giving the intensity ratios of certain spectroscopic features", as described above.<br>
Thus the instrument of Figures 1 to 6 indicates whether a polished gemstone is a natural diamond which has not been subjected to irradiation treatment and which has not been subjected to HPHT treatment. However, by selective detection of specific luminescence peaks, it is possible for the instrument to be arranged to indicate solely whether a polished gemstone is a natural diamond which has not been subjected to irradiation treatment or solely whether a polished gemstone is a natural diamond "which has not been subjected to HPHT treatment<br>
The Instrument of Figures 7 and 8<br>
The instrument of Figures 7 and 8 is fundamentally similar to that of Figures 1 to 6, and the same reference numerals are used for the same or like parts. There is a single spectrometer 11, with a single detection cable 14. There is a single filter 16. This demonstrates that if desired, one spectrometer can be removed from the arrangement of Figures 1 to 6, inserting a suitable filter in the single spectrometer, and removing the associated fibre optic cable or leg. The pin 8 is fixed to a flat cover 7 forming part of the cover arrangement, and the lay-out is much simpler than in the instrument of Figures 1 to 6. There is no indication of a mechanical shutter for the laser 9, but such can be provided so that when the lid 6 is open, the laser 9 is occulted.<br>
In a different arrangement (not shown) of the instrument of Figures 7 and 8, a bifurcated fibre optic is used. The light from one laser 9,10 fells directly onto a shutter in front of one leg of the fibre optic cable. Light from the second laser is deflected along the path of the first laser by a double-prism arrangement which is actuated by a mechanical solenoid.<br>
The instrument of Figures 7 and 8 can be as in the Example set out above. The single filter 16 can be a combined long-wavelength-pass filter (e.g. a Schott Glass OG 550) to block light from the first laser 9, and a notch filter centred at the wavelength of the second laser 10 and blocking light over a wavelength range of 1 to 5 nm.<br>
The container, which is of circular cross-section, can be 20 mm deep and of 20 mm internal diameter, giving apian view cross-sectional area of about 315 mm2.<br>
The Instrument of Figure 9<br>
The instrument of Figure 9 has different dimensions to the instrument of Figures 7 and 8, but is otherwise very similar except that the second laser 10 is omitted. Like references indicate like parts. The fibre optic cables 12,14 are shown schematically.<br>
