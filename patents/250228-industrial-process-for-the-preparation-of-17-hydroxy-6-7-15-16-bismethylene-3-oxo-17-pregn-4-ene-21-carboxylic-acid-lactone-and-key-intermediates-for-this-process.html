The object of the invention is an industrial process for the preparation of the known<br>
17-hydroxy-6β,7β;15β,16β-bismethylene-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21-carboxylic acid γ-lactone<br>
(hereinafter: drospirenone) of the formula (I), as well as key intermediates for the synthesis.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) is known by the name drospirenone in the therapy<br>
and is a svnthetic progestin having also anti-mineralocorticoid and antiandrosenic effects. In<br>
combination with ethynylestradiol it is marketed under the name of Yasrnin as an oral<br>
contraceptive.<br>
For the preparation of drospirenone several processes are known in the chemical<br>
literature which differs in the starting material used and in the order of the reaction steps.<br>
Introduction of the functional groups is accomplished by known chemical methods. All<br>
processes are suitable for laboratory-scale use and a scale-up for industrial application may<br>
imply several, unexpected problems.<br>
A synthesis of drospirenone is first disclosed in the German patent specification DE<br>
2,652,761. The synthesis starts from 3β-hydroxy-15β, 16β-methyieneandrost-5-en-17-one<br>
which is reacted with 1-bromo-3,3-dimethoxypropane in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of<br>
lithium, followed by a cyclization in position 17 carried out in 70 % acetic acid to give, the<br>
"lactol-ether". The hydroxy and ether groups being present in the molecule were oxidized<br>
with cyclohexanone in the presence of aluminium isopropylate, then the double bond was<br>
izomerized by using 2N sulfuric acid to yield 17-hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3-oxo-17α-<br>
pregn-4-ene-21carboxylic acid γ-lactone.<br>
The "lactone" derivative was reacted with chloranil (2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-2,5-<br>
cyclohexadiene-1,4-dione) in tert-butanol to form the "3-oxo-androsta-4,6-diene" in which a<br>
methylene group was introduced in positions 6,7 (by using trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and<br>
sodium hydride producing in situ a "methylide") giving the drospirenone.<br><br>
For the preparation of 3β-hydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-5-ene-17-one (the<br>
starting material for the above synthesis) a five step reaction route is disclosed in the German<br>
patent specification DE 1,593,500.<br>
The first drospirenone synthesis includes several reactions which cannot be realized at<br>
industrial scale and gave typically low yields. Purification of the intermediates and the end-<br>
product accomplished by chromatography gave also low yields (49 %, 26 % and 16 %,<br>
respectively.<br>
In the German, patent specification DE 2,746,298 intermediates which can be used<br>
also for the preparation of drospirenon are described. To form double bonds (which are<br>
required for. the introduction of the methylene groups), first hydroxyl groups were brought<br>
into the molecule via a microbiological process. The dehydroepiandrosterone —. the starting .<br>
material for the synthesis - was hydroxylated microbiologically to give 3β,7α,15α-<br>
trihydroxyandrost-5-ene-17-one which, in turn, was oxidized in an additional fermentation<br>
step to yield 7α,15α-dihydroxyandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione. Elimination of the hydroxy group<br>
in position 15 was accomplished with p-tomenesulfonie acid catalyst yielding the "4,6,15-<br>
triene".<br>
When the 7α,15α-dihydroxy derivative was acetylated with acetic anhydride in<br>
pyridine the 3-acetoxy-7a-hydroxy-androst-5,15-diene-17-one in one step was obtained, to<br>
said compound a methylene moiety was introduced in positions 15,16 by a process discussed<br>
above, the compound obtained was oxidized microbiologically and after elimination of water<br>
15β,16β-methylenandrosta-4,6-diene-3,17-dione was obtained. Then the compound having<br>
the "diene" structure in the AB rings of the steroid was treated with ethylene glycol in the<br>
presence of orthoformic acid trialkyl ester and p-toluenesulfonic acid catalyst to give the<br>
ketal in a mariner known per se, said ketal was reacted with dimethoxybromopropane in the<br>
presence of lithium as described above to yield the "17-acetal", which then was cyclized to<br>
form the corresponding "lactol-methyl ether" and this was subjected to Jones oxidation to<br>
give the corresponding "lactone". The intermediate obtained in such a way has a double bond<br>
in position 6,7 to which a methylene group can be introduced in a known manner.<br>
Theoretically another synthesis route is described for the preparation of drospirenone<br>
in the European patent specification EP 051,143 and its equivalents (US 4,416,985 and US<br>
4,614,616). The process is also published in Angew. Chem. 94, 718-719 (1982). What is<br><br>
novel is that the 6β,7β-methylene group is formed in a stereospecific manner by the<br>
Simmons-Smith reaction.<br>
The starting material of the process is 3β-hydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-5-en-<br>
17-one. The hydroxy in 7β position is introduced in a fermentation process using<br>
Botryodiplodia malorum, the resultant compound is acetylated in a regioselective manner<br>
with pivalic anhydride in the presence of 4-dimemylaminopyridine yielding the<br>
corresponding 3β-pivaloyloxy derivative. Said pivaloyloxy derivative was reacted with tert-<br>
butyl hydroperoxide in the presence of VO (acetonylacetonate)2 catalyst to give the 5β,6β-<br>
epoxy derivative which, in turn, was reacted with triphenylphosphine and carbon<br>
tetrachloride in dichloromethane to yield the 7α-chloro derivative. Said 7α-chioro derivative<br>
was reacted with zinc in a mixture of acetic acid and tetrahydrofuran yielding the 5β-<br>
hydroxy-15β,16β-methylene-3β-pivaloyloxyandrost-6-en-17-one which then was hydrolyzed<br>
with potassium hydroxide to give 3β,5β-dihydroxy-15β,16β-methyleneandrost-6-en-17-one.<br>
Into the compound having a double bond in position 6 the methylene group was<br>
introduced by using diiodomethane in the presence of zinc in ethylene glycol dimethyl ether<br>
solvent and the. "6β,7β;15β,16β-dimethylene" derivative so obtained was propynylated in<br>
position 17 in the presence of potassium ethylate in tetrahydrofuran. Said 17α-(3-hydroxy-1-<br>
propynyl)-6β,7β;15β,16β-dimethyleneandrostan-3β,5β,17β-triol was hydrogenated in a<br>
mixture of tetrahydrofuran, methanol and pyridine in the presence of Pd/CaCO3 or Pd/C<br>
catalyst and the compound obtained was oxidized, lactonized and dehydrated in one step by<br>
using chromium trioxide in aqueous pyridine.<br>
According to EP 0,051,143 instead of pivaloyloxy protective group tert-butyl<br>
dimethylsilyl, dimethyl-(3-methylbutyl)-silyl or tribenzylsilyl substituent is also suitable.<br>
Beyond that the synthesis consists of 15 steps, the realization thereof at industrial<br>
level may go with several problems. In the epoxidation step the use of tert-butyl<br>
hydroperoxide in large quantities is dangerous. When zinc dust is applied in a heterogenous<br>
system under vigorous stirring a special apparatus is required. The sodium perchlorate is a<br>
hazardous material, the carbon tetrachloride as a reactant cannot already be used even at<br>
laboratory scale, whereas the potassium ethylate is flammable. Based on experiments, when<br>
an ethynyl group is hydrogenated, besides the completely hydrogenated product there are<br><br>
always partially hydrogenated impurities present and said impurities can only be separated<br>
with considerable loss of the useful compound either it is a straight chain or cyclic one.<br>
Both the EP 075,189 and the US 4,435,327 patent specifications relate to combined<br>
synthetic/microbiological processes. Starting material for the synthesis is, again, the<br>
dehydroepiandrosterone which is dihydroxyiated by a fermentation process (Colletotrichuxn<br>
phomodies) to give the 3p,7a,15a-trihydroxyandrost-5-en-17-one; the hydroxy substituent in<br>
position 7 of said compound is then epimerized by using 35 % perchloric acid as catalyst e.<br>
g. in a mixture of acetone and dichloro-meLhane; finally the 3p,7p,15a-irihydroxy derivative<br>
is reacted with pivaioyl chloride in pyridine, in the presence of 4-dimemylaminopyridxne<br>
catalyst to give the 3,15-pivaloyiated derivate. An alternative process for the preparation of<br>
the compound is also disclosed.<br>
The subsequent steps of the synthesis are the same as those described in EP 051,143.. .<br>
Besides mat this process consists of 12 steps, it uses the reactions mentioned before,<br>
which make uncertain a possible industrial application.<br>
In the German patent specification DE 3,626,832 a different novel method for .<br>
forming the y-lactone ring is disclosed. The synthesis starts from 15p,i6p-methyiene-3-<br>
methoxy-androsta-3,5-diene-17-one which is reacted with 2-(l-ethoxyethoxy)-3-butenenitrile<br>
and the "unsaturated nitrile" derivative obtained is cyclized to form the y-lactone structure in<br>
two steps. Difficulties of this process arise from the synthesis of a special reagent and the<br>
bromination in position 6. The use of butyl hthium at industrial scale is not without risk.<br>
According to the German patent specification DE 1,963,3683 (=US 6,121,465) from<br>
known intermediates, i. e. from 17oc(3-hydroxy-l-propynyl)-6f3,7i3;15p,16P-bismethylene-<br>
androstan-3p,5p,17j3-triol and 6|3,7p;15|3,16(3-bismethylene-5p,17(3-dihydroxy-3-oxo-17a-<br>
pregnane-21-carboxylic acid y-lactone the drospirenone is prepared by new .process. The<br>
17aK3-hydroxy-l-propynyl)-6(3,7(3;15p,16p-bismemyleneandrostane-3p,5p,17p-triol	is<br>
hydrogenated. in tetrahydrofuran in the presence of palladium/carbon; the product obtained<br>
was used in the next reaction step without further purification.<br>
The "bismethylene propanol" obtained was suspended in acetonitrile, the suspension<br>
is heated to 45 °C, then 1 mol % of ruthenium trichloride is added in aqueous solution.<br>
Subsequently aqueous solution of sodium bromate is added dropwise, the reaction mixture is<br>
kept at 50 °C for 2 hours then worked up by extraction method. The 6p,7P;15P,l6P-<br><br>
bismet3iylene-5j3,17p-d3liydroxy-3-oxo-17a-pregnane-21-carboxylic acid y-lactone obtained<br>
is recrystallized, dehydrated with p-toluenesulfonic acid and purified by chromatography.<br>
According to the specification the hydrogenation and oxidation step can be performed with<br>
65-72 % yield.<br>
In the European patent EP 0,150,702 a process starting from androst-4-ene-3,17-dione<br>
is disclosed. The 15a-hydroxy derivative is prepared by a fermentation step, said compound<br>
is benzoylated to give an oily product which is reacted with trimethylsulfonium methylide<br>
prepared in situ from trimethylsulfonium iodide. From 40 g of 15a-hydroxy-aadrcst-4-ene-<br>
3,17-dione after purification by chromatography 22.7 g of 15p,16p-methyleneandrost-4-ene-<br>
3,17-o.ione were OL&gt; tamed.<br>
Subsequently a propargyl group was introduced into position 17 by using propargyl<br>
alcohol in the presence of potassium ethylate. A compound mixture is obtained in which the<br>
double bond of 17p-hydroxy-17a-(3-hydroxy-l-propynyl)-15p,16p-methyleneandrost-5-ene-<br>
3-one component is isomerised into the "3-oxo-androst-4-ene" in an additional reaction step.<br>
Said "propynyl" derivative is hydrogenated in the presence of<br>
tris(triphenylphosphine)rhodium (1) chloride catalyst, formation of the lactone ring is carried<br>
out by using chromium trioxide in pyridine. The carbolactone obtained is .reacted with<br>
orthoformic acid triethyl ester to yield 3-ethoxy-15j3,16p-methylene-17a-pregna-3,5-diene-<br>
21,17-carbolactone which at position 6 is brominated, the oily product obtained is reacted<br>
. with lithium bromide and lithium carbonate in dimethylformamide at 100 °C to give the<br>
15(3,16P-methyiene-3-oxo-17a-pregna-4,6-diene-21,17-carbolactone intermediate after<br>
purification by chromatography. Difficulties arising from hydrogenation of propynyl<br>
compound and from the bromination at position 6 were discussed above.<br>
According to the German patent specification DE 1,920,145 3-methoxy-15p,16pV<br>
methyleneandrosta-3,5-diene-17-one is synthetized from 15p,16j3-methyleneandrosta-4-ene-<br>
17-one, which is refluxed with catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid and 2,2-<br>
dimethoxypropane in the presence of methanol in dimethylformamide. Said "3-methoxy"<br>
derivative can be used as intermediate for the preparation of drospirenone.<br>
Processes known in the art and realized at laboratory scale can be the source of<br>
further unexpected problems when scaling up is carried out. According to recent<br>
pharmacopoieal requirements several tests (e. g. TLC or HPLC) are specified to control<br><br>
purity of the drugs which may contain only a limited number of impurities in limited amount.<br>
To meet these requirements it is practical to know what impurities and in which amount are<br>
present in the intermediates.<br>
Careful analysis of such impurities - particularly in the case of an industrial process -<br>
may help to choose the suitable purification methods and to determine which steps can be<br>
combined to make the process profitable.<br>
Taking into consideration the above aspects, our aim was to provide a process which<br>
can be realized at industrial scale that is safe, lacks the drawbacks of previous processes and<br>
by which the drug obtained is pure and meets the pharmacopoieal requirements..<br>

problems. The 15a-acetoxy compound obtained can be used in the next reaction step without<br>
purification.<br><br>
The 15a-pivaloyloxy derivative - a novel compound of the general formula (TV),<br>
wherein R is a tert-butyl group - can similarly be prepared in pyridine, using 4-<br>
dimethylaminopyridine as catalyst and pivaloyl chloride as acylating agent.<br>
The 15a-acyloxy derivatives of the general formula (TV) is then dissolved in dry<br>
tetrahydrofuran,tlie solution is cooled to 0 °C and in the presence of sulfuric acid catalyst is<br>
reacted preferably with trimethyl or triethyl orthoformiate. When the reaction is complete, to<br>
the solution pyridine is added and the tetrahydrofuran is distilled off using a solvent ■<br>
replacement technique (to acetonitrile), the suspension is filtered and the solid substance is<br>
dried. The 15a-acetoxy-3-memoxy-androsta-3,5-diene of the formula (V) is obtained with 95<br>
% yield.<br>
The same method is followed when the new 15a-pivaloyloxy-3-methoxy-andosta-<br>
3,5-diene-17-one and also when the new 15a-pivaloyloxy-3-ethoxy-androsta-3,5-diene-17-<br>
one of the general formula (IV) are prepared.<br>
The 15a-acetoxy-3-methoxy-androsta-3,5-diene-17-one of th general formula (V) is<br>
treated with a reagent prepared in situ from trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and potassium<br>
hydroxide hi a solvent, the reaction mixture is stirred for 6 hours then added to water. The<br>
precipitate is filtered off, washed to remove the mother liquor and dried. Finally the 15p,16<br>
8-methylene-3-methoxy-androsta-3,5-diene-17-one obtained (a compound of the general<br>
formula (VH)) is crystallized from methanol.<br>
The 15(3,16p-methylene-3-ethoxy-andosta-3,5-diene-17-one is prepared by the<br>
method described above.<br>
The "3-alkoxy" derivatives of the general formula (VI) formed in the reaction are<br>
reacted with 2-(2-bromoethyl)-l,3-dioxolane in dry tetrahydrofuran in the presence of<br>
lithium at 0 °C. When the reaction is finished the Uthium is transformed into lithium<br>
hydroxide with a mixture of methanol and water, the solvent is removed by distillation, the<br>
residue is mixed with water, the precipitate is filtered, washed to remove the mother liquor,<br>
dried and crystallized from methanol. The new compound of the general formula (VH) is<br>
obtained with a yield of 92 %.<br>
The	(17a)-15p,16P-methylene-17-hydroxy-3-metoxy-pregna-3,5-diene-21-<br>
carboxaldehyde cyclic 1,2-ethanediyl-acetal, as well as the (17a)-15P,16P-metylene-17-<br><br>
hydroxy-3-metoxy-pregna-3,5-diene-21-carboxaldehyde-diethyl-acetal of the general<br>
formula (VII) are also new compounds and are prepared in a manner described-above.<br>
Said new "acetals" of the general formula (VII) - of which the (17a)-15p,16p-<br>
methylene-17-hydroxy-3-metoxy-pregna-3,5-diene-21-carboxaldehyde cyclic 1,2-ethanediyl-<br>
acetal is particularly preferred - are dissolved in acetone/water mixture and reacted with<br>
chloranil at 25 °C. When the reaction is complete, the excess of the chioranil is decomposed .<br>
with sodium pyrosulfite and the target compound is extracted with dichloromethane. From<br>
the extract an oily substance, the (I7a)-15p,16jj-meuiylejie-17-hydroxy-3-oxo-pregna-4,6-<br>
diene-21-carboxaidehyde cyclic 1,2-ethanediyl-acetaI of the general formula (VHT) is<br>
obtained which in methanol is cyclized with concentrated hydrochloric acid at 0 °C yielding<br>
the 15p,16p-memylene-3-oxo-andiosta^,6-diene-[17(P-l&gt;pko-51-pemydrofuran-2'^-ol-<br>
methyl ether (or in a similar manner the "propyl ether") of the general formula (IX).<br>
Said compounds of the general formula (IX) in dimethyl sulfoxide under nitrogen<br>
atmosphere are reacted with a reagent in situ prepared from trimemylsulfoxonium iodide and<br>
potassium hydroxide. When the reaction is finished, the reaction mixture is diluted with<br>
water, the precipitate obtained is filtered, washed until is neutral and dried. The crude<br>
product bearing a methylene group of alf&gt; configuration at positions 6,7 and an alkoxy<br>
substituent also of two different configuration on the lactol ring, is isolated and is left without<br>
further purification.<br>
The alkoxy derivatives of the general formula (X) obtained are reacted in acetone<br>
with Jones-reagent at 0-5 °C, the excess of the reagent is decomposed by isopropanol and the<br>
mixture is added to water. From the aqueous solution the acetone and isopropanol are<br>
removed by distillation, the residue is diluted with water and the precipitate is filtered and<br>
dried to yield the compound of the general formula (XI). The crude product is dissolved.in<br>
ethyl acetate, the solution is clarified with activated carbon, then the adsorbent is removed by<br>
filtration, the solvent is evaporated. The oily product is first subjected to normal<br>
chromatograpohy (normal phase, atmospheric pressure) and then to HPLC to give the<br>
separated 6 p,7 P — and 6 cc,7 a - methylene isomers, respectively.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention the "3-oxo-pregna-4,6-diene" of the general<br>
formula (VET) can be converted into the "bismethylene" derivative of the general formula<br>
(X) in such a way that the "diene" of the general formula (Vm) first is treated with a reagent<br><br>
prepared in situ from trimethylsulfoxonium iodide and then the substituents being present in<br>
position 17 are cyclized in acidic medium to give the bismethylene compound of the general<br>
formula (X).<br>
Separation of the compound of general formula (XI) into the 6p,7(3 - and 6a,7 a -<br>
methylene isomers is performed by two-step chromatography : one of them is carried out at<br>
atmospheric pressure in normal phase mode (pre-chromatography), the other one is a HPLC<br>
method (fine chromatography).<br>
Both in the pre-chromatogrsplry and in the fine chromatography silica gel is used as<br>
stationary phase and in plant-scale operation a diisopropyl ether/ethyl<br>
acetate/dichloromethane mixture of 57:33:10 v/v ratio is used as eluent.<br>
At laboratory scale cyclohexane/ethyl acetate/acetone mixture of the 64:18:18 v/v<br>
ratio is also applicable as eluent resulting in the same separation efficiency.<br>
Similar result can be achieved when cyciohexane/ethyi acetate/acetonitrile of the<br>
55:35:10 v/v ratio or cyclohexane/methyl tert-butyl ether/acetone mixture of the 50:30:20 v/v<br>
ratio are anplied.<br>
Separation of the "pVcc" mixture by chromatography is performed with a yield of<br>
50.73 %. Description of the pre- and fine chromatography is given in examples 21 and 22.<br>
Further purification of the chromatographed product can be achived by crystallization<br>
from a solvent selected from methanol, ethanol, propane!, isopropanol, ethyl acetate; a<br>
solvent rnixture containing water up to 10 vol % selected from methanol/water,<br>
ethanol/water, propanol/water, isopropanol/water; acetone/diisopropyl ether mixture<br>
containing acetone up to 50 vol %; cyclohexane/ethyl acetate mixture containing ethyl<br>
acetate up to 50 vol %; dichloromethane/diisopropyl ether rnixture containing<br>
dichloromethane up to 10 vol %; and dichloromethane/hexane mixture containing<br>
dichloromethane up to 10 vol %.<br>
Enclosed is a flow-sheet showing our process in an easy to follow form.<br>
The inventive step of this invention is supported by the following features:<br>
a) A plant-scale process is provided for the synthesis of drospirenone. Published<br>
patents and other scientific publications describe laboratory processes. Our<br>
process can further be scaled up compared to the batch-size given in the<br>
examples.<br><br>
b)	' Starting materials for our process, such as the known 15 a-hydroxy-androst-4-<br>
• ene-3,17-dione is readily available being an industrial product.<br>
c)	Our process consists of 8 steps, while the other processes known in the art<br>
consist e. g. of 15,12 and 10 steps, respectively.<br>
d)	According to this invention also the intermediates are obtained with good<br>
yield. E. g. in Example 1. 88 %, in Example 3. 95 %, in Example 6. 76 %, in<br>
Example 8. 92 %, in Example 11-12. 74 %, in Example 15. 65 % yield has<br>
e)	The mixture obtained in the last synthetic step is separated by pre- and fine<br>
chromatography with 49.2 % yield which is excellent compared with the 16 %<br>
given in the German patent specification DE 2,652,761.<br>
f)	The intermediates obtained in our process are purified by simple<br>
. crystallization methods. In the other processes, (e. g. in that disclosed in DE<br>
2,652,761) not only the end-product, but also two intermediates are purified<br>
by chromatography. In our process in the case of the intermediates disclosed<br>
in examples 1, 3,10 and 14, there was no need for purification.<br>
g)	According to the technical literature drospirenone was prepared by using<br>
carbon tetrachloride (a prohibited reagent), tert-butylhydroperoxide, sodium<br>
hydride, butyliithium, sodium perchlorate and sodium ethylate. These<br>
reactants are hazardous materials especially in plant scale applications. The<br>
use of zinc requires special apparatus to provide intensive stirring necessary in<br>
the case of heterogeneous reactions. Our process is free from such or similar<br>
difficulties.<br>
h) Plant-scale production demands intermediates which are easy-to-handle, stable<br>
and easy-to-purify. Stability of the (17a)-15p,16p-methylene-17-hydroxy-3-<br>
metoxy-pregna-3,5-diene-21-carboxaldehyde cyclic 1,2-ethanediyl-acetal, a<br>
specific intermediate of the synthesis, is excellent contrary to other acetals<br>
mentioned as applicable in the technical literature.<br>
i) In the case of the preparation of known intermediates any effort has been<br>
taken to use easier methods and to achieve better yields in comparison with<br>
those described in the technical literature. E. g. the 15oc-acetoxy-androst-4-<br><br>
. ene-3,17-dione is obtained with a yield of 88 % in an easy to reproduce and<br>
easy to scale-up way, while in the US 5,236,912 patent specification a yield of<br>
62 % is given for this compound,<br>
j) Intermediates and the end-product obtained in our process-particularly with<br>
respect to stereochemistry and purity - were carefully analysed by NMR<br>
spectroscopy, the amount of the impurities was determined by HPLC.<br>
Regarding intermediates described in the technical litt.ature in most cases<br>
k) Strategically important and specific products of our synthesis are new. Beyond<br>
. these, several closely related compounds are also novel. The new<br>
intermediates are described in examples 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, and<br>
18.<br>
1) We studied in detail the introduction of the "methylene" into the 15a-acyloxy<br>
compound to obtain a compound of the general formula (VI) in order to<br>
determine the exact reaction parameters. In "said reaction dimethyl-[(3-<br>
methoxy-i7-oxo-androsta-3,5-diene-15p-yl)methyI] sulfonium iodide (Via)<br>
was identified as intermediate which can be transformed into the "15p\16p-<br>
methylene" derivative with strict attendance of the temperature. Said<br>
intermediate was isolated, its structure was identified, and then was<br>
transformed into the 15,16p-compound according to Example 6. We want to<br>
remark that we didn't find such studies in the technical literature.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following non-limiting Examples.<br><br>
Example 1<br>
5g-Acetoxvandrost-4-ene-3,17-dione<br>

g of 4-dimemylaminopyridine and 8.45 1 of acetic anhydride are added in sequence, while the<br>
temperature is kept below 40 °C. As the reaction proceeds the mixture becomes clear. After •<br>
the addition of the acetic anhydride has been finished the mixture is stirred for 30 minutes,<br>
then added slowly to 540 i of water and stirred for additional 2 hours, until the precipitate<br>
formed becomes dense, filtered by centrifuge, washed with portions of water until it is<br>
neutral and dried to constant weight at a temperature below 40 °C. The title compound<br>
obtained can be used in the next reaction step without further specification.<br>

The column (diameter: 32 cm; length: 250 cm) was packed with 90 kg of silica gel<br>
(Merck Kieselgel, 40-60 \xm particle size) by using the slurry method. 2.5 kg of crude<br>
drospirenone is dissolved in 13.51 of dichloromethane and the solution in gravitation way is<br>
layered to the top of the silica gel bed, then is washed in with the eluent mixture (diisopropyl<br>
ether/ethyl acetate/dichlororaethane of 57:33:10 v/v ratio) also in gravitation way. The<br>
column is filled up with the eluent, closed, and the elution is started with a flow rate of .<br>
200 1/hour. After 600 1 of eluent had come down, fractions of 50 1 are collected (about 20<br>
fractions) and checked by TLC. Based on the TLC results fractions are formed: one that is<br>
"rich in 6a, 7a isomer", another "mixed" fraction and one containing the "pre-purified<br>
drospirenone". Each fraction is evaporated to dryness, the solids obtained are crystallized<br>
from dichloromethane/diisopropyl ether (10:90 v/v %). The "mixed" fraction - besides the<br>
target compound (drospirenon) - contains the 6a,7a - isomer nearly in an amount as it<br>
present in the starting material. The "pre-purified drospirenone" contains maximum 2 %<br>
6a,7a-isomer. From 2.5 kg of crude drospirenone about 1.1 kg of "pre-purified"<br>
drospirenone is obtained, while the "mixed" fraction weighs about 0,6 kg. The latter one can<br>
be recirculated into the pre-chromatographic operation.<br>

breakthrough of the compound a pre-fraction (3.6 1) is collected containing an isomeric<br>
mixture; then the "fine chromatographed" fraction is collected upon UV detection<br>
(about 20 1). Both fractions are evaporated and the residues are crystallized from<br>
dichloromethane/diisopropyl ether (10:90 v/v %). The pre-fraction yielded 20-25 g of<br>
crystalline substance (max. 2 % 6a,7a-isomer content), the "fine chromatographed" fraction<br>
gave 55-60 g of drospirenone (max. 0.1 % 6a, 7a-isomer content). The pre-fraction was<br>
recirculated into the fine chromatography; such way the total amount of drospirenone is 75 g<br>
(93.7%).<br>
