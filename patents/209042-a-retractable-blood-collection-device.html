Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Figure 1 is a perspective view of an elongated generally cylindrical housing 10, preferably made of polypropylene plastic. The elongated tubular housing has a transversely extending end wall 12 which partially closes the right end of the housing as seen in the drawing. The left end of the housing 10 includes an integrally<br><br>
formed finger gripping collar 16 and plastic cover 20 connected to the housing by a hinge 30 of any suitable type, but preferably an integrally formed plastic hinge 30 which has elastic memory to bias the cover 20 to a position in which it ordinarily closes the open left end of the housing. The cover 20 also includes an integrally formed generally semi-circular guide skirt 22 on the inner side wall of the cover which is closely received in the interior of the preferably generally cylindrical wall 12 of the housing. The inherent elasticity of the materials of the cover and housing retain the cover in the closed position but permit easy opening thereof by finger pressure. As seen in Figure 1, the longitudinally extending wall 12 of the housing is configured with a thickened section to provide a seat 18 of reduced diameter to prevent passage of a cannula support hub 60 (Figs. 4 - 6) to the left past the seat.<br>
Figures 1 and 3 illustrate the right end of the housing including the transversely disposed end wall 14 which terminates in an integrally formed axially extending cylindrical end 15 of reduced diameter. An annular rounded retainer enlargement 24 and a reduced diameter restraining groove 26 on the exterior of the cylindrical wall 12 of the housing mate with the interior wall of a retainer ring 50 to be described with reference to Figures 7 and 8 for holding the retainer ring on the end of the housing while permitting relative rotation between the retainer ring 50 and housing 10. The retainer ring 50 is preferably made of polypropylene plastic so that the retainer ring 50 can be elastically pressed onto the end of the housing to be retained thereon by the enlargement 24 and groove 26. Engageable rotation limit stops 42, 44, 52 are provided on the end wall 14 of the housing and interior surface of the retainer ring 50 to limit relative rotation therebetween preferably to not exceed about 45° so that the ring 50 can easily be rotated manually relative to the housing 10 with one hand without having to shift the position of the user's hand. The rotation limit stops 42, 44 on the end of the housing can take any suitable form but, as shown, comprise the ends of an annular skirt 40 which are positioned for abutment with the<br><br>
rotation limit stop 52 on the retainer ring.<br>
In order to tactilely determine the relative position of the retainer ring 50 and housing 10, two circumfrentially spaced buttons or enlargements 46, 48 are provided on the outside of the end wall 14 of the housing positioned in the arc of the annular stop skirt 40 between the stops 42, 44 provided by the ends thereof. The rotation limit stop 52 on the retainer ring 50 is sized to snap into one or the other of the recesses between the limit stops 42, 44 and the enlargements 46, 48 to enable the user to feel whether the retainer ring is 50 in correct position relative to the housing 10. As seen in Fig. 7, the retainer ring is a generally cup shaped part having an exterior finger gripping surface 54 preferably formed by grooves or enlargements. As seen in Figure 8, the retainer ring 50 has a non-circular central opening 56 which may take the shape of a rectangle, and the rotation limit stop 52 is integrally formed and extends radially inwardly from the side wall of the retainer ring to engage the stops 42, 44 provided by the ends of the annular skirt on the end wall of the housing 10. The stop 52 in the retaining ring has an end surface 56 receivable in the spaces between the enlargements 46, 48 on the exterior surface of the end wall 14 of the housing and the stops 42, 44 provided by the ends of the annular housing skirt 40.<br>
A generally cup-shaped cannula support hub 60 (Figs. 4-6), preferably also made of polypropolene plastic, is comprised of a transversely extending disk 62 and an axially extending skirt 64 , preferably having two or more spaced annular sections 64a, 64b and a centrally located cannula support 66 having a non-circular portion 68, which for example may be rectangular or square, integrally formed on its end for passage through the opening 56 in the retainer ring 50. Preferably, the hub also includes an integrally formed retainer 70 having an enlarged lip 72 suitable for retaining a rubber or plastic protective boot 74 initially covering the left end of a double ended cannula 80 firmly supported in a centrally disposed<br><br>
passageway 82 which extends through the hub 60. The cannula 80 may be permanently attached in the cannula support 66 or the cannula passage in the support 66 may be threaded to receive a cannula of the user's choice. A permanently attached cannula will have one end which initially protrudes from the housing with the cannula 80 extending from each side of the hub 60 as seen in Fig. 9 which shows the assembled blood collection device. The centrally located non-circular opening 56 in the retainer ring 50 is sized to prevent passage of the non-circular end 68 of the cannula support 66 therethrough when the retainer ring 50 is in a first rotational position with respect to the hub 60 and housing 10 with the opening 56 permitting passage of the end 68 of the cannula support 66 therethrough when the retainer ring 50 is rotated to a second position with respect to the hub and housing.<br>
A coil compression spring 90 (Fig. 9), preferably of stainless steel, is seated in the housing between the hub disc 62 and the transversely extending end wall 14 of the housing to bias the hub 60 and cannula 80 supported therein to the left so that the double ended cannula 80 is completely enclosed within the housing after use. The compression spring 90 may be cylindrical or, as shown, of generally conical shape and closely surrounds the elongated cannula support 66 to prevent mis¬alignment of the hub 60 as it longitudinally slides in the housing 10 to its engagement with the seat 18 where continued leftward motion of the hub and supported cannula is terminated.<br>
The spaces between the annular skirt portions 64a, 64b_ of the hub conveniently form keyways for receiving longitudinally extending keys 92 integrally formed on the interior cylindrical wall of the housing as seen in Figs. 1 and 2 to guide the hub 60 in its sliding movement in the housing and prevent relative rotation therebetween.<br><br>
The assembled device preferably also is shipped with a protective sheath 100 of rubber, plastic or otherwise elastically stretchable material for covering the projecting end of the cannula 80 prior to use. The sheath is frictionally retained on the non-circular end 68 of the cannula support which essentially comprises a lip for elastically retaining the sheath.<br>
In operation, the elastic bootL74 or cover over the interior end of the double ended cannula 80 is first removed then a suitable blood collection container having a piercable end is inserted into the open end of the housing where it is pierced by the inner end of the cannula 80. The outer protective sheath 100 covering the cannula is then removed, the blood collection device used in its intended fashion, and, after drawing of the blood sample, the cannula 80 is removed from the patient's vein. The retainer ring 50 is then easily rotated, preferably clockwise, relative to the housing with one hand through its path of travel to permit the non-circular end 68 of the cannula support hub to align with the non-circular opening 56 in the retainer ring 50 to permit the spring 90 to passively withdraw the end 68 of the cannula support hub and the cannula 80" completely into the housing 10 for safe disposal.<br>
