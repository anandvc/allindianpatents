				<td>A PHARMACEUTICAL LIQUID FORMULATION OF OXALIPLATIN FOR<br>
PARENTERAL ADMINISTRATION<br>
ACID CONTAINING OXALIPLATIN FORMULATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to formulations containing oxaliplatin.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Oxaliplatin is an anticancer agent. Oxaliplatin (CAS 61825-94-3), also known as L-OHP, is a<br>
third generation platinum complex. The term "oxaliplatin" as used herein includes cis-<br>
oxalato(trans-l-l,2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum(H), its optic enantiomer cis-oxalato(trans-<br>
d-1,2-diaminocyclohexane) platinum(n), and any mixture thereof.<br>
Oxaliplatin is currently approved and marketed for second-line treatment of colorectal<br>
cancer in combination with 5-FU and LV. Oxaliplatin is available in a lyophilised form (20<br>
mg, 50 mg or 100 mg vials). Just prior to administration, the lyophilised powder is<br>
reconstituted using water for injection or 5% glucose injection solution to provide a solution<br>
containing 5 mg/ml oxaliplatin. Typically, the reconstituted solution is then further diluted<br>
in 250-500 mL of 5% glucose injection solution. The diluted oxaliplatin solution is then<br>
infused either by peripheral vein or central venous line over 2 to 6 hours.<br>
Lyophilized oxaliplatin has some disadvantages as a pharmaceutical form. The<br>
manufacturing process for a lyophilised dosage form is complicated and expensive. For<br>
example, the risk of sterility failure during manufacture of freeze dried forms is generally<br>
higher than is the case for liquid solutions. In addition, the reconstitution of freeze dried<br>
preparations requires both skill and care as it involves several risks, inter alia , incomplete<br>
dissolution of the powder, contamination through handling a highly toxic substance as a<br>
powder or cake, and maintaining the sterility of both the vial and the infusion solution<br>
during reconstitution and transfer to the infusion bag. Thus, to administer a lyophilized<br>
drug, multiple handling of the drug is required - the lyophilised oxaliplatin is first<br>
reconstituted, then diluted with a 5% glucose solution and then administered by intravenous<br>
infusion.<br>
Further, following reconstitution, oxaliplatin is prone to instability, particularly in solutions<br>
containing certain nucleophilic agents. For example, some reconstitution solutions<br>
containing chloride ions, such as 0.9% sodium chloride solution, are commonly used in<br>
hospitals. The mistaken use of such a reconstitution solution in the case of the lyophilized<br>
form of oxaliplatin has the serious consequence of rapidly decomposing the oxaliplatinum<br><br>
metal complex, forming a precipitate (dichloro-diammocyclohexane-platinum derivative)<br>
with NaCl.<br>
As a consequence of the limitations described above, several stabilised aqueous ready-to-use<br>
(RTU) liquid oxaliplatin preparations have been proposed:<br>
1.	US 5,716,988 and AU 731981 disclose a pharmaceutical formulation consisting of a 1<br>
to 5 mg/mL solution of oxaliplatin in water having a pH range of 4.5 to 6.<br>
2.	WO 99/43355 and US 6,306,902 disclose an oxaliplatin solution formulation<br>
containing 1 to 7 mg/ml oxaliplatin, a buffering agent and a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier. The preferred buffering agent (and only example) is oxalic acid or<br>
an alkali metal salt thereof.<br>
3.	WO 01/15691 discloses solutions of at least 7 mg/ml oxaliplatin containing a solvent<br>
containing a sufficient amount of at least one hydroxylated derivative selected from<br>
1,2-propane-diol, glycerol, maltitol, sucrose and inositol. The specification states that<br>
these are the only suitable agents to use after consideration of several options.<br>
Further, if buffering agents are used, the specification teaches that the buffer should<br>
have an oxalic acid base.<br><br>
4.	US 6,476,068 discloses an oxaliplatin solution formulation comprising 0.1 to 10<br>
mg/ml oxaliplatin, an effective stabilizing amount of the monocarboxylic acid, lactic<br>
acid, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The preferred concentration range of<br>
oxaliplatin is 2 to 5 mg/ml.<br>
5.	US Patent Application No. 20030109515 discloses an oxaliplatin solution formulation<br>
containing a stabilising amount of malonic acid. The examples are directed to<br>
formulations having an oxaliplatin concentration of 2 mg/ml. In contrast to the<br>
teaching of this application, and as is discussed below, the present inventors have<br>
found that malonic acid destabilises oxaliplatin in solution.<br>
Buffering agents are used in liquid pharmaceutical formulations to adjust the pH of the<br>
formulation and to maintain the formulation within a desired pH range. As mentioned<br>
above, the dicarboxylic acid, oxalic acid, and its salts have been proposed as a buffering and<br>
stabilising agent for oxaliplatin. Oxalate ion is formed in aqueous solutions of oxaliplatin by<br>
hydrolysis, thus conceivably this reaction may be slowed (using Le Chatelier's principle)<br><br>
through purposeful addition of oxalate ion to solutions of oxaliplatin. However, oxalic add<br>
has some disadvantages as a pharmaceutical buffering agent, notably it's toxicity. Oxalic<br>
acid is potentially nephrotoxic and also requires special handling precautions, which<br>
complicate and limit its use in pharmaceutical products.<br>
There is a need for agents that can be used with oxaiiplatin solutions as alternatives to the<br>
prior art buffering agents (oxalic acid, lactic acid and malonic acid) and which do not have<br>
the disadvantages associated with the use of oxalic add.<br>
Ideally, the alternative agents would not destabilise oxaiiplatin in solution. In particular, it<br>
would be useful if the alternative agents improve the stability of oxaiiplatin in aqueous<br>
formulations in a manner that minimises significant degradation of oxaiiplatin and limits the<br>
formation of unwanted impurities such as diaquo DACH platinum and diaquo. DACH<br>
platinum dimer.<br>
Further, it would be preferable to limit the amount of unknown degradation products in the<br>
aqueous formulation. Any unknown degradation product present in an amount exceeding<br>
the thresholds set in the guidelines of the ICH (International Conference on Hannoiusation<br>
of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) is required to<br>
be identified. This imposes significant requirements on the manufacturer of the formulation,<br>
as they arc required to identify trace amounts of an unknown degradation product. In<br>
addition, the presence of unknown degradation products is an indication that there may be<br>
additional risks of toxicity and unknown side-effects as a consequence of the presence of<br>
these products. It is therefore of interest to a manufacturer of a formulation to avoid<br>
producing unknown degradation products.<br>
Ideally, additional pharmaceutically acceptable buffering agents should bo non-toxic and be<br>
present in the smallest possible quantity. Furthermore, during manufacture they should be<br>
introduced in the Safest and most convenient manner possible.<br>

As will be understood, the additive should be used at a concentration which does not<br>
destabilise the oxaliplatln and preferably aids stability of the oxaliplatln. The desired<br>
stability of oxaliplatln will depend on the intended shelf life of the pharmaceutical<br>
formulation and the manipulation prior to administration. More specifically, a stable<br>
aqueous oxaliplatin formulation is one in which there will be no significant change in<br>
oxaliplatln potency at the specified storage condition. The criteria for 'significant change"<br><br><br>
are as defined in the International Conference on Hannonisatian (LCH) Guideline: Stability<br>
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products Q1A (R2). Ihus in the cose of injectable ETU<br>
oxaliplatln solution, potency of oxallplatin should be at least 95% of initial content/ and.<br>
solution remains clear, colourless and tree of precipitation for a phannaceutically acceptable<br>
duration of time.<br>

the range of from about 3 to about 8, more preferably about 4 to about 7, even mora<br>
preferably about 5.<br>
As is known to a person skilled in the art a buffering system is a mixture o£an add with it<br>
conjugate base in a solution, the mixture being formulated so as to maintain the pH at a<br>
desired level. As defined herein, "buffering agent" refers to an acid or a base which may<br>
form a component of a buffering system whether or not the acid or base is assodated with its<br>
conjugate base or conjugate add, respectively.<br>
Preferably the pharmaceutical formulation of the invention is provided in a sterile, sealed<br>
container. For example, a neutral glass of type land a stopper. Examples of the stopper<br>
include those made of an elastomer based on halogenated butyls, possibly coated with a<br>
fluorinated polymer.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Measurement of Stability of Oxaliplatln formulations<br>
The stability of an oxaliplatln formulation over a period of time can be measured by a<br>
number of complementary methods. Visual appearance and stability of the pH of the<br>
formulation ore important indicators and these can be measured by techniques well known<br>
to those skilled in the art<br>
Stability can also be measured by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques.<br>
HPLC is a technique mat is widely used and well known in the art. HPLC can be used to<br>
measure the potency of the oxaliplatln where potency is denned as a percentage of the initial<br>
concentration of oxaliplatln. HPLC can also be used to measure the relative proportions of<br>
known and unknown degradants in an oxaliplatin solution.<br>
Known degradation products of oxaliplatln include:<br>
•	(truis-l-1,2diamocydortexane)trans-dihydroxo(oxalato) platinum (TV). This a<br>
oxidative degradation product of oxaliplatin. This degradation product has been,<br>
designated as Impurity C in the Examples.<br>
•	(SP-4-2)-diaqua-[(1R, 2R)-cydorxane-1,2-diamino-kn,kn']plantinum, or diaque<br>
DACH platinum. This is a hydrolysis degradation product of oxaliplatin. This<br>
degradation product has been designated as Impurity B in the Examples.<br>
•	•	(SP-4-2)-diaqua-[(1R, 2R)-cydorxane-1,2-diamino-kn,kn']plantinum, or diaque<br>
DACH platinum dimer. This is a degradation product resulting from further reaction<br>
of impurity B. This degradation product has been designated as Dlmer in the<br>
Examples.<br>
R,S-oxaliplatin is an isomeric form of oxaliplatin which is found at low levels as an impurity<br>
in oxaliplatln (ie cis-oxalato(trans-l-1,2-diarnmocydohexane) platinum(II)).<br>
Overview of the Examples<br>
Example 1 details mn initial trial of oxaliplatin formulations using a number of agents over a<br>
pH range from 3 to 7 in which the ability of tartaric acid, maleic acid, succinic and malic<br>
acids to stabilise oxaliptatin was compared to a control. Of the acids tested, tartaric add was<br><br>
found to give the most stable oxaliplatin solutions and it was subsequently tested across a<br>
wide pH and concentration range as reported in Example 2. This study confirmed the<br>
advantaged of tartaric add and also indicated that there was a preferred concentration range<br>
for improved stability. A further study, reported in Example 3, then reviewed a number of<br>
other acids at a set concentration (0.3 mM) as buffering agents in solutions of oxaliplatin.<br>
This showed that formulations containing malic and succinic acid had impurity levels which<br>
were comparable to the tartaric acid formulation. Contrary; to the teaching of the prior art, ■<br>
the malorric acid formulation contained a surprisingly and unacceptable high level of<br>
impurities relative to the tartaric acid formulation. Solutions containing citric, maleic and<br>
saccharic acids also showed reasonably low levels of impurity. The stabilisers of the prior<br>
art, oxalic add and lactic acid, also displayed reasonably low levels of impurity which is<br>
unsurprising in the case of oxalic acid due to the operation of Le Chatclicr's principle.<br>
Example 4 provides details of a preferred formulation of an aqueous solution of oxaliplatin<br>
and tartaric acid.<br>
Example 1<br>
The stability of art array of oxaliplatin formulations in water for injection (WH) having an<br>
oxaliplatin concentration of 5mg/ml was assessed. Potential buffering agents of oxaliplatin<br>
that were tested were tartaric acid, malic acid, succinic add and maleic acid. The pH of the<br>
formulations covered a range of values.<br>
Comparative Example 1(a)<br>
Preparation of the Control solution<br>
WH (water for injaction) was added to a suitable glass vessel to about 80 % of the desired<br>
quantity of final volume and warmed to 45-50°C. While stirring and flushing with nitrogen,<br>
the desired quantity of oxaliplatin (calculated at 5 mg/ml, at the final desired volume) was<br>
added and dissolved. The solution was then made Up to the desired final volume with WJFL.<br>
Example 1(b)<br>
Preparation of Dicarboxylic Acid Solutions<br>
For the formulations described below, WF1 was added to a suitable glass vessel to about 80%<br>
of the desired final volume and warmed to 45-50°C While stirring and flushing with<br>
nitrogen, the desired quantity of oxaliplatin was added and dissolved. Thereafter the<br>
proposed stabilising dicarboxylic acid or its alkali salt was added to the oxaliplatin solution<br><br>
until completely dissolved. Where required, pH was adjusted through .the addition of dilute<br>
NaOH solution. The solution so formed was made tip to the final volume with WPI.<br><br><br><br>
The pH values used to designate the different formulations arc indications only and do not<br>
necessarily reflect the exact pH of each solution. The exact initial pH values are provided in<br>
tho tables above.<br>
Example 1(c)<br>
Stability Study<br>
Da accordance with an accelerated stability protocol, the formulations were stored at 40°C<br>
with 75% relative humidity fox 12 weeks.<br>
The potency of the formulations was examined by high performance liquid chromatography<br>
(HPLC) at 4 week intervals over the 12 week period. Potency is dofined as a percentage of<br>
the initial concentration of oxoliplatin. Most formulation* maintained at least 95% potency<br>
over the 12 week period. The exception to this was Mulch: pH 7 which had a potency of<br>
41.9% after the 12 week period. Malcic acid could not therefore he considered as a viable<br>
stabiliser.<br>
In respect of the use of malic acid as an stabiliser, the study of Malic pH 7 was terminated<br>
after 4 weeks due to significant precipitation and colour changes within the formulation.<br>
Accordingly, malic acid could not be considered as a viable stabiliser. As is discussed below<br>
this result may have been a consequence of the high concentrations of the malic acid disodium<br>
salt in the formulation.<br><br>
Only very low levels of the oxidative degradation product Impurity C [(ttans-/-1.2-<br>
diaminocyclohexano)trans-dihydroxo(oxalato) platinum (IV)] were detected in the<br>
formulations. This indicated that the formulations were substantially free of oxygen.<br>

Tt is clear from a visual comparison of the chromatograms mat the tartaric acid stabilised<br>
formulations are for more stable than the malicic acid and succinic acid stabilised<br>
formulations. In addition, in comparison to the chrumatogram of the control formulation/<br>
the formation of Dimer (diaqua DACH platinum dimer) is suppressed in the tartaric acid<br>
stabilised fomuuorions. further, at least in the case of the Tartaric pH 7 formulation,,<br>
significantly less impurity B (diaqua DACH platinum), the principle degradant, is formed.<br>
In addition, the tartaric acid stabilised formulations do not display as many unknown<br>
impurity peaks as the control formulation.<br>

In comparison to the chromatogram of the control formulation/ Dimer (diaqua DACH<br>
platinum dimer) formation is suppressed in the tartaric acid stabilised formulations.<br>
Summary<br>
It is clear from a visual comparison of the chromatograms of Figures 1 and. 2 that the tartaric<br>
acid stabilised formulations of oxallplatin are far more stable than the maleic acid and .<br>
succinic acid containing formulations. In addition/ in comparison to the chromatogram of<br>
the control formulation, the formation of Dimer (diaqua DACH platinum dimer) is<br><br>
suppressed in the tartaric acid stabilised formulations and, in some cases, significantly less<br>
Impurity B (diaqua DACH platinum), the principle degradant, is formed. Further, the<br>
tartaric acid stabilised formulations do not display as many unknown impurity peaks as the<br>
control formulation which is of importance in meeting the guide lines of the ICH and also in<br>
minimising any side effects due to the presence of unknown impurities. The increased<br>
stability of the oxaliplatin formulations applies across a range of pH values.<br>
Although malic acid and succinic acid were considered as unsuitable agents following this<br>
experiment, later investigations, as detailed in Example 3, demonstrated that malic acid,<br>
succinic acid and maleic acid can be used with oxaliplatin. A possible reason for the initial<br>
finding that these formulations were unsuitable is because of the relatively high .<br>
concentrations of certain of the succinic and malic acid formulations used in Example 1. For<br>
instance, the succinic pH 3 formulation has a concentration of succinic acid of about 1.10 mM<br>
and the succinic acid pH 7 formulation has a concentration of disodium salt of succinic acid<br>
of 6.38 mM. Similarly, the concentration of malic acid disodium salt in the malic pH 7<br>
formulation is 842 mM. The concentration of maleic acid in the Maleic pH 7 formulation is<br>
about 6.1 mM. By contrast the tartaric acid concentrations of the formulations of this<br>
Example range from about 02 to about 0.3 mM.<br>
Example 2<br>
2.1	Background<br>

acid and the effect of pH on the stability of oxaliplatin solution formulations. The tartaric<br>
acid formulations were compared to a control formulation of oxaliplatin in water and to a<br>
formulation of oxaliplatin in oxalic acid solution (according to US 6,306,902).<br>

control at 25ºC. At 40ºC, formulations A4, A5 and E4 contained less totat impurity than the<br>
control, In all cases the Dimer impurity was suppressed relative to the Control and indeed<br>
was not detected in formulations A5, A7 and E4.<br><br>
2.6 Summary<br>
The screening study indicated that tartaric acid is a suitable stabilising agent for oxalipiatin<br>
at a range of concentrations. In terms of the ability of tartaric acid to stabilise the oxalipiatin,<br>
concentrations of 0.2 mM and 03 mM (formulations E and A respectively) are preferred,<br>
although formulations at 0.6 mM (formulations B) also demonstrated some stabilising effect.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
A9 shown in Example 1, a formulation screening study showed that the presence of tartaric<br>
acid in an oxaliptatin solution can suppress the formation of impurities relative to a control<br>
solution and thereby stabilise the formulation. The studies discussed in Example 2 indicated<br>
that the total concentration of tartaric acid in the formulation was of importance in providing<br>
a stabilising effect. The possibility existed that other carboxylic acids may have the same<br>
stabilising effect. This study involved the screening of a range of carboxylic adds (other than<br>
tartaric acid) at a set concentration (0.3 mM) in oxaliplatin solutions. The formulations were<br>
placed at 40°C for 5 weeks and then evaluated for stability. The performance of the<br>
formulations were compared to a solution of oxaliplatin containing tartaric acid at 03 mM.<br>

up to final volume after dissolving the acid completely.<br>
3.1.2 Preparation of oxaliplatin formulations<br>
About 80% mL of the desired amount of WFI was added into a dean glass beaker and heated<br>
the WH to 50°C -55°C, while stirring and flushing with nitrogen. The oxalipiatin was then<br>
added to the beaker and mixed until clear solution was obtained (about 30 minutes was<br>
needed to achieve complete dissolution of oxaliplatin). The solution was then made up to<br>
volume with WFL The bulk solution was divided into 100 mL quantities and the required<br>
amount of acid solution was added to each 100 mL quantity according to Table 20. Each<br><br>
formulation was then flushed with nitrogen until the dissolved oxygen content in solution<br>
was below 045 ppm.<br>

3,3 Summary<br>
Formulations containing malic and succinic acid showed impurity levels which were<br>
comparable to me tartaric acid formulation. Contrary to the teaching of the prior art, the<br>
malonic acid formulation contained a surprisingly and unacceptably high level of impurities<br>
relative to the tartaric acid formulation. Solutions containing citric, mateic and saccharic<br>
adds also showed reasonably low levels of impurity and would be considered to be suitable<br>
buffering agents for oxaliplatin. The stabilisers of the prior art oxalic acid and lactic acid,<br>
also displayed reasonably low levels of impurity which is unsurprising in the case of oxalic<br>
acid due to the operation of Le Chateller's principle.<br>
