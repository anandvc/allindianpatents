The present invention relates to a sealant two-component epoxy resin composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell, a process for producing a plastic liquid crystal display cell, and a plastic liquid crystal display cell.<br>
In recent years, a light weight and thin liquid crystal display panel, i.e., a plastic liquid crystal display cell, is widely used as a display panel for a portable telephone. The plastic liquid crystal display cell is formed by filling a liquid crystal in a space surrounded by a pair of plastic substrates having transparent electrodes and an orientation film arranged thereon and a sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell, which is a thermosetting resin composition.<br>
The service environment of the liquid crystal display cell is becoming severer, and therefore a high quality plastic liquid crystal display cell is demanded that has impact resistance withstanding the environment and has high handling safety.<br><br>
As described in the foregoing, the demand of products using the plastic liquid crystal cell is being considerably increased, and in order to produce plastic liquid crystal cells of higher uniformity and higher quality in the production sites of those fields of art, the heat adhesion step of adhering the pair of substrates by curing the thermosetting resin composition between the pair of substrates is reviewed. A multiplaten heat press adhesion method, in which plural substrates are heat adhered at a time, is mainly employed from the standpoint of productivity, and a sheet heat press adhesion method, in which substrates are heat adhered one-by-one, is also employed from the standpoint of assuring further reliability of the plastic liquid crystal display cell.<br>
As the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell, a two-component thermosetting sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal cell has been known, and for example, two-component sealant compositions have been known that are formed with a curing agent liquid containing a trifunctional mercapto compound and a base resin liquid containing polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether or the like. Although these sealant compositions have sufficient basic performance with respect to the sealing characteristics for aplasticliquidcrystaldisplaycell, i.e., the adhesion sealing property, the electric insulating property, the non-contamination property for liquid crystals and the like<br><br>
under the ordinary state, the water vapor gas barrier property, the water resistant strength characteristics and the like under a high temperature and high humidity environment at from 60 to 80 °C are considerably low. Therefore, when they are used under a high temperature and high humidity environment for a long period of time, moisture is penetrated into the interior of the plastic liquid crystal display cell through the sealant composition with the lapse of time, and as a result, functional disorder of the liquid crystal display cell, such as display unevenness, decrease in response speed and the like, occurs.<br>
An obj ect of the invention is to provide a one-component or two-component sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell that is capable of being applied to not only a multiplaten heat press adhesion method but also a sheet heat press adhesion method and of producing a plastic liquid crystal display cell having high reliability under a high temperature and high humidity environment, a process for producing a liquid crystal display cell using the composition, and a liquid crystal cell.<br>
More particularly, it is to provide a sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell that enables secure adhesion without seal leak and effusion of the liquid crystal by an adhesion process using a vacuum sheet heat press adhesion or rigid sheet heat press adhesion method, has a small free ion concentration derived from the composition, and is excellent<br><br>
in water vapor gas barrier property, water resistant adhesion reliability, heat resistant adhesion reliability, impact resistant adhesion property and dimensional stability, a process for producing a liquid crystal display cell using the composition, and a liquid crystal cell.<br>

of a sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell.<br>
The characteristics shown by (I) to (IV) may be achieved by changing the amount ratios of the epoxy resin, the curing agent and the curing accelerator, such as an alkyl urea derivative, as well as, depending on necessity, the inorganic filler and the rubbery polymer fine particles.  The characteristics will be described in detail below.<br>
In the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell of the invention, it is preferred that an aqueous solution obtained by mixing the composition and 10 times by weight the composition of pure water at from 40 to 80°C has an ionic conductivity of 1 mS/m or less.

The plastic liquid crystal display cell using the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell of the invention is produced through the following process. Fig. 1 is a flow chart of the process for producing a plastic liquid crystal display cell of the invention.<br>
In the step al, the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell of the invention is coated by screen printing or dispenser coating on a contact seal region of one substrate of a pair of substrates for a plastic liquid crystal display cell.<br>
Inthestepa2, thepairof substrates are then positioned and adhered.<br>
In the step a3, the assembly is subjected to a heat<br>
pressing treatment at from 60 to 100°C to cure the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell.  The thickness between the pair of substrates (cellgap) is determined within a range of from 3 to 7 jim depending on the species of<br><br>
the liquid crystal used. In general, a uniform thickness with anerrorofO.Ol p,m or less is obtained by appropriately arranging the gap controlling agent between the substrates.<br>
In the step a4, a liquid crystal is charged in a space surrounded by the pair of substrates and the sealant composition. A charge inlet for charging the liquid crystal is then sealed with a photocuring liquid crystal sealant composition, a two-component liquid crystal sealant composition, an ultraviolet-curing liquid crystal sealant composition or the like.

The period of time for the pre-curing treatment is from 5 to 30 minutes . It is preferred that the higher the temperature is, the shorter the period is.

The heat curing conditions of the heat pressing treatment in the step a3 are from 60 to 100°C for from 0.5 to 24 hours, and preferably from 70 to 90°C for from 1 to 10 hours.<br>
In the case where the adhesion process of the substrate by the heat pressing treatment is carried out by a sheet heat press method, it may be produced by two steps or plural steps of the heating step and the aging step, in which the pair of substrates are adhered under the conditions that assure temporary adhesion, preferably conditions of from 100 to 110°C for from 3 to 20 minutes, and then the pair of substrates are taken out by releasing the pressure, followed by complete hardening and curing in a heating oven at the same temperature.<br>

A sheet heat pressing method of adhering by applying heat in vacuum is referred to as a vacuum sheet heat pressing method, and a sheet heat pressing method of forcibly adhering with applying heat and pressure through heat plates under atmospheric pressure is referred to as a rigid body sheet heat pressing method. Both the sheet heat pressing methods may be used. A multiplaten heat press method may be used instead of the sheet heat pressing<br><br>

5 parts of a glass short fiber spacer having a diameter of 5 pm was mixed with 100 parts of the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell Q2, and they were mixed and defoamed under sufficient vacuum to obtain a composition.<br>
The composition was charged in a dispenser syringe and dispenser-coated on an ITO substrate, which is one of a pair of substrates, to such a pattern that is formed from four cells of a 1-inch size per one substrate arranged vertically and horizontally with a width of the sealant of about 0.5 mm and a thickness thereof of about from 20 to 22 fxm.  After<br><br>
subjecting the ITO substrate to a heat treatment by a hot air dryer at 60°C for 30 minutes, an untreated ITO substrate, which is the other substrate of the pair of substrates, was placed thereon, followed by positioning, and the assembly was temporarily adhered by a pressing pressure of 0 . 03 MPa/cm^ at a temperature increased from 70 to 120°C over 10 minutes for 20 minutes in total, and then subjected to a step ofplacing<br>
it in a heating oven at 120°C for 9 hours, so as to produce a liquid crystal display cell. As a result, occurrence of seal leak was observed in from 1 to 5 liquid crystal display cells among 10 liquid crystal cells. The remaining liquid crystal display cells assured the sealing property to such an extent that the function as a liquid crystal display cell can be maintained while disorder of seal lines was observed. However, because the modulus ofthecured product of the sealant was too high, peeling phenomena at the ITO interface were often observed due to the low adhesion following property on deformation of the substrate when the resulting cells was taken out one-by-one. It was found that the foregoing phenomena often easily occurred when a weak stress of about 50 g as a T peel stress was applied.<br>
Consequently, owing to the fact that the foregoing phenomena were observed, it was easily expected that serious obstructions occurred upon cutting, washing, injection of a liquid crystal, transportation, packaging and assembly<br><br>
processing of the resulting plastic liquid crystal display cells.<br><br><br>

As it was apparent from Examples lto3, theliquidcrystal displaycells produced with the sealant compositions foraliquid crystal display cell of the invention had such functions at the same time as an E type viscosity characteristics at 50 to 100°C of a composition subjecting to B stage of the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell itself of from 5 to 5,000 Pa*s, a water vapor permeability of a cured product of the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell itself of less than 200 g/m^*24hrs, a heat deformation temperature of less than 85°C, a modulus of the cured product in a range of from 0.5x10 to 1 x 10 Pa, an ionic conductivity of an aqueous solution obtained by extraction by mixing with 10 times by weight of pure water at 60'C of 1 mS/m or less, and the like. As a result, the seal function durability of the resulting liquid crystal display cells exceeded 1,000 hours.<br>
On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1, the free ion amount of the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell was 2 mS/m or more, and the cured product had a considerably high water absorption and was swelled upon wetting, whereby the display quality was considerably deteriorated. As a result of the seal function durability test of the resulting liquid crystal display cell, stable maintenance of the display function was difficult at the time lapsing for 250 hours, and the service life of the liquid crystal display<br><br>
cell was short.<br>
In Comparative Example 2, because the cured product was as hard as having a modulus of 2 x 10" Pa or more, the adhesion following property to the plastic substrate was lacked, and as a result, it was difficult to produce a plastic liquid crystal display cell in a stable manner.<br>
Consequently, it is understood that the plastic liquid crystal display cell produced by using the sealant composition for a plastic liquid crystal display cell of the invention assures display stability for a long period of time under a high temperature and high humidity condition.<br>
The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing description and all changes which come within the meaning and the range of equivalency of the claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein.<br>
