BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention, in a method for the production of acrylic<br>
acid comprising steps for absorbing with water an acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas obtained by the reaction of catalytic<br>
gas phase oxidation, removing low boiling substances and high<br>
boiling substances, and a step for thermally decomposing an<br>
acrylic acid oligomer contained in the high boiling<br>
substance-containing solution obtained in the step for<br>
removal, relates to a method for the production of acrylic<br>
acid which allows to prevent the polymerization more<br>
efficiently and enjoys exalted productivity.<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
Acrylic acid is used in coating, textile processing,<br>
leather products, and building materials, as well as for<br>
copolymers destined to produce acrylic fibers and for<br>
emulsions to produce tackiness agents and adhesive agents.<br>
The demand for acrylic acid is now increasing. With a view<br>
to realizing mass production of acrylic acid by using an<br>
inexpensive raw material, therefore, it is common for acrylic<br>
acid to be produced by the reaction of catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation of propylene, for example. Since the reaction of<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation gives rise to by-production<br>
of low boiling substances and high boiling substances besides<br>
yielding acrylic acid, various processes are relied on to<br>
separate and remove such by-products and purify acrylic acid.<br>
The official gazette of JP-A-09-157213, for example,<br>
discloses a method for producing acrylic acid by introducing<br>
a mixed gas obtained by the catalytic gas phase oxidation<br><br>
of propylene, for example, to an acrylic acid absorption column,<br>
causing the gas to contact an aqueous absorbing solvent<br>
containing acrylic acid, acetic acid, and sparingly<br>
water-soluble solvent thereby obtaining an aqueous acrylic<br>
acid solution, dehydrating the aqueous acrylic acid solution<br>
in an azeotropic separation column and obtaining through, the<br>
bottom of this column acrylic acid substantially free from<br>
acetic acid, water, and sparingly water-soluble solvent,<br>
meanwhile expelling through the top of the column a mixture<br>
consisting of acetic acid, acrylic acid, water, and sparingly<br>
water-soluble solvent by distillation, separating the<br>
expelled mixture in a storage tank into an organic phase formed<br>
substantially of a solvent and a water phase formed of acrylic<br>
acid, acetic acid, a solvent, and water, and circulating the<br>
organic phase in the azeotropic separation column.<br>
The solution, the exhaust gas, and the like which emanate<br>
from such purification processes possibly contain raw<br>
material compounds, produced compounds, and other useful<br>
compounds. With the object of exalting the efficiency of<br>
production, the practice of putting these materials to<br>
circulatory use in the process of production is continuing<br>
in use.<br>
The official gazette of JP-A-11-012222, for example,<br>
discloses a method for recovering acrylic acid from acrylic<br>
acid containing acrylic acid dimer and maleic acid, which<br>
is characterized by introducing the acrylic acid containing<br>
acrylic acid dimer and maleic acid into an acrylic<br>
acid-recovering column, expelling acrylic acid by<br>
distillation through the top of the column to recover the<br>
acrylic acid, meanwhile introducing the bottom liquid (A)<br>
from the acrylic acid-recovering column into a thermal<br>
decomposition tank and decomposing the acrylic acid dimer<br><br>
in the bottom liquid (A), and then circulating at least part<br>
of the bottom liquid (B) from the thermal decomposition tank<br>
to the acrylic acid-recovering column. This method is<br>
directed toward effective use of the acrylic acid dimer and<br>
maleic acid and, by circulating the acrylic acid produced<br>
by the decomposition to an acrylic acid-recovering column,<br>
is enabled to obtain acrylic acid as a finished product.<br>
Acrylic acid is an easily polymerizing compound and is<br>
liable to generate an acrylic acid polymer during the process<br>
for absorption of acrylic acid and the subsequent process<br>
for purification. Various purification columns, therefore,<br>
have been used to produce acrylic acid while preventing the<br>
occurrence of polymerization by adjusting distillation<br>
pressure, temperature, feed rates of liquids, and the like.<br>
The official gazette of JP-A-2000-355570, for example,<br>
discloses a method for distilling an easily polymerizing<br>
compound by the use of a distilling device, specifically a<br>
method for preventing an easily polymerizing compound from<br>
being polymerized, characterized by supplying a liquid<br>
substantially identical in composition with the liquid<br>
existing in the periphery of component member disposed in<br>
the distilling device to the component member by an introducing<br>
means by spray. The concept of spraying a liquid substantially<br>
identical in composition with the liquid existing in the<br>
periphery of component member throughout the entire surface<br>
of the component member has originated in the discovery that<br>
an easily polymerizing compound begins to polymerize when<br>
it is left stagnating on the surface of a component member<br>
inside a distilling device and the subsequent discovery that<br>
the polymerization within the distilling device would be<br>
effectively prevented by performing distillation while<br>
allowing no stagnation of the liquid on the surface of the<br><br>
component member in the distilling device. The term "liquid<br>
identical in composition" as used herein embraces a feed liquid,<br>
a liquid extracted from the interior of the column, a reflux,<br>
and a circulating liquid of bottoms (a purified liquid). This<br>
liquid diluted to a low concentration with water, alcohol,<br>
azeotropic solvent, or extracting solvent can also be used.<br>
Since acrylic acid is an easily polymerizing compound,<br>
however, the process for the absorption of acrylic acid and<br>
the subsequent process for purification are liable to form<br>
acrylic acid polymers. Various purification columns have<br>
been used to produce acrylic acid while preventing the<br>
occurrence of polymerization by adjusting distilling pressure,<br>
temperature, and amount of feed liquid. The control of these<br>
factors is not easy because the pressure and the concentration<br>
change simultaneously with a change in temperature. The<br>
occurrence of an acrylic acid polymer results in lowering<br>
the yield of the product.<br>
In the process for the purification of acrylic acid,<br>
not only the acrylic acid polymer but also by-products<br>
generated by the reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
adheres to such devices as the distilling column and the<br>
occurrence of this adherence entails such harmful effects<br>
as blocking the devices and possiuiy impairs lasting stable<br>
production of acrylic acid.<br>
In the high boiling substance-containing solution<br>
resulting from the separation of high boiling substances,<br>
the so-called Michael type adduct of acrylic acid exists<br>
besides the acrylic acid dimer and forms a cause for degrading<br>
the efficiency of raw material for the process of acrylic<br>
acid production. When the Michael type adduct accumulates<br>
in the process, it inflicts a serious hindrance on the process<br>
for purification and the process of production as well and<br><br>
entails elevation of temperature and formation of by-products<br>
possibly to the extent of degrading the quality of product.<br>
When such compounds are recovered as acrylic acid, the recovery<br>
possibly results in degrading the quality of acrylic acid.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventor has discovered that in a method<br>
for the production of acrylic acid which comprises absorbing<br>
in water the acrylic acid-containing gas obtained by the<br>
reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation, separating a low<br>
boiling substance, separating a high boiling substance, and<br>
thermally decomposing an acrylic acid oligomer, the<br>
efficiency of production of acrylic acid can be improved by<br>
effecting either (i) a step for introducing a polymerization<br>
inhibitor to a stage other than a stage for supplying raw<br>
material(what is called "step for feeding") to a distilling<br>
column and a stage for supplying a reflux thereto, or (ii)<br>
a step for supplying to a step for dehydration the acrylic<br>
acid recovered by thermal decomposition of the oligomer. The<br>
method for producing the acrylic acid may incorporate therein<br>
a step for producing an acrylic ester from the produced acrylic<br>
acid or a step for further purifying the produced acrylic<br>
acid into acrylic acid of a higher purity. It may further<br>
incorporate therein a step for producing a polyacrylic acid<br>
(or salt thereof) by using the acrylic acid of a high purity<br>
mentioned above.<br>
This invention, particularly by providing a tank and/or<br>
a cooler between each the step for absorption in water, the<br>
step for separation of low boiling substances, the step for<br>
separating high boiling substances, and the step for thermal<br>
decomposition of the acrylic acid oligomer, cooling the feeds<br>
to the subsequent steps, and then performing the subsequent<br><br>
step's, prevents the occurrence of polymers to the subsequent<br>
steps and exalts the eventual yield of production.<br>
This invention, in the method for the production of<br>
acrylic acid which comprises steps for absorbing in water<br>
the acrylic acid-containing gas resulting from the reaction<br>
of catalytic gas phase oxidation, removing low.-boiling 	<br>
substances and high boiling substances, and thermally<br>
decomposing the acrylic acid oligomer contained in the high<br>
boiling substance-containing solution resulting fromthe step<br>
for removal, can prevent the polymerization more efficiently<br>
and exalt the productivity.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method for<br>
the production of acrylic and which comprises the steps of :<br>
(a) supplying one or more gas components selected from the<br>
group consisting of propylene, propane and acrolein to a<br>
reactor for catalytic gas phase oxidation,(b) obtaining an<br>
acrylic acid-containing gas by catalytic gas phase oxidation,<br>
(c)	introducing said acrylic acid-containing gas and<br>
supplying an aqueous absorbing solvent into an acrylic acid<br>
absorbing column, whereby an aqueous acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution is absorbed onto said acrylic acid absorbing column,<br>
(d)	obtainingsaid aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
absorbed onto said acrylic acid absorbing column,(e)obtaining<br>
crude acrylic acid from said aqueous acrylic containing<br>
solution in an azeotropic dehydration column by dehydration,<br>
(f) introducing a polymerization inhibitor to said azeotropc<br>
dehydration column at any point between a point for supplying<br>
said aqueous acrylic acid containing solution and a point for<br>
supplying a reflux and not including the point for supplying<br>
said aqueous acrylic acid containing solution material and the<br>
point for supplying the reflux; (g) optionally removing a low<br>
boiling substance from said aqueous acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution by using an azeotropic distillation column,<br>
(h)obtaining acrylic acid and a high boiling substance-<br>
containing solution by removing the high boiling substance<br>
from said crude acrylic acid, subsequently (I) recovering<br>
acrylic acid by thermally decomposing an acrylic acid oligomer<br>
contained in said high boiling substance-containing solution,<br>
and (j) supplying the acrylic acid recovered by thermally<br>
decomposing said acrylic acid oligomer from step (i) to said<br>
azeotropic dehydration column.<br><br>

production of polyacrylic acid (salt).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT(S)<br>
The first aspect of this invention relates to a method<br>
for the production of acrylic acid which comprises (a) a step<br>

refers to as a substance having a lower boiling point than<br>
acrylic acid under standard conditions and the term "high<br>
boiling substance" refers to as a substance having a higher<br>
boiling point than acrylic acid under standard conditions.<br>
The term "acrylic acid oligomer" refers to the Michael<br>
type adduct of acrylic acid which is represented by the<br>
following formula [I].<br>
CH2=CHCOO-(-X-COO)n-H [I]<br>
(wherein n is an integer of 1 - 5 and -X- stands for -CH2CH2-<br>

water-absorbent resin. As the polyacrylic acid salts,<br>
preferably univalent salts and more preferably alkali metal<br>
salts and ammonium salts may be cited. Such acrylic acid may<br>
be copolymerized with other monomer. For example, the acrylic<br>
acid (salt) monomer may be either cross-linked with<br><br>
approximately 0.01 - 5 mol% (based on the acrylic acid) of<br>
a cross-linking agent or graft polymerized to such other<br>

One example of the preferred mode of embodying this<br>
invention will be described below with reference to Fig. 1.<br>
The method of this invention for the production of acrylic<br>
acid comprises supplying a raw material gas 1 containing raw<br>
material component, inert gas, molecular oxygen, steam, and<br>
the like to a reactor 10 for catalytic gas phase oxidation<br><br>
and subjecting the raw material to the reaction of catalytic<br>
gas phase oxidation with a molecular oxygen-containing gas.<br>
Specifically, the raw material gas is supplied to the reactor<br>
10 such as, for example, a shell-and-tube type reactor packed<br>
with an oxidizing catalyst 11. The oxidation of propylene<br>
as a raw material component, for example, results in forming<br>
acrolein. The acrolein, when further subjected to the<br>
reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation, produces acrylic<br>
acid. The reaction conditions such as raw material gas,<br>
oxidizing catalyst, inert gas, molecular oxygen-containing<br>
gas, and reaction temperature which are used for this<br>
production of acrylic acid may be any of the sets of conditions<br>
which are used in the heretofore known processes for the<br>
reaction of acrylic acid.<br>
The raw material gas is composed of 1 to 15 vol. % of<br>
such a raw material component as one or more of propylene,<br>
propane, and acrolein, 1 to 3 times the amount of the raw<br>
material components a of a molecular oxygen, and the balance<br>
of such inert gas as carbon dioxide or steam. Though the<br>
reactor for performing the reaction of catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation does not need to be particularly restricted, a<br>
shell-and-tube type reactor can be used advantageously in<br>
respect that it excels in the efficiency of reaction. The<br>
acrylic acid is produced by the one-stage reaction when<br>
acrolein is used as the raw material component or by the<br>
so-called two-stage reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
when propylene is used as the raw material component. The<br>
former-stage catalyst and the latter-stage catalyst to be<br>
used in the two-stage reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation<br>
do not need to be particularly restricted.<br>
The former-stage catalyst is required to produce<br>
acrolein from propylene. As typical examples of this catalyst,<br><br>
those represented by the general formula: Moa-Bib-Fe<br>
c-Ad-Be-Cf-Dg-Ox (wherein Mo, Bi, and Fe respectively stand<br>
for molybdenum, bismuth, and iron, A stands for at least one<br>
element selected from the group consisting of nickel and cobalt,<br>
B stands for at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of alkali metals and thallium, C stands for- at<br>
least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
phosphorus, niobium, manganese, cerium, tellurium, tungsten,<br>
antimony, and lead, D stands for at least one element selected<br>
from the group consisting of silicon, aluminum, zirconium,<br>
and titanium, 0 stands for oxygen, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and<br>
x respectively represent atomic ratios of Mo, Bi, Fe, A, B,<br>
C, D, and 0 such that b = 0.1 - 10, c = 0.1 - 10, d = 2 -<br>
20, e = 0.001 - 5, f = 0 - 5, and g = 0 - 30 are satisfied<br>
when a = 12 is fixed, and x assumes a numerical value which<br>
will be fixed by the oxidizing states of the relevant elements)<br>
may be cited.<br>
The latter-stage catalyst is required to effect gas phase<br>
oxidation of ?. reaction gas containing acrolein to produce<br>
acrylic acid. As typical examples of this catalyst, those<br>
represented by the general formula: Moa-Vb-Wc-Cud-Ae-Bf-Cg-Ox,<br>
(wherein Mo stands for molybdenum, V stands for vanadium,<br>
W stands for tungsten, Cu stands for copper, A stands for<br>
at least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
antimony, bismuth, tin, niobium, cobalt, iron, nickel, and<br>
chromium, B stands for at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline earth metals,<br>
and thallium, C stands for at least one element selected from<br>
the group consisting of silicon, aluminum, zirconium, and<br>
cerium, 0 stands for oxygen, a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and x<br>
respectively represent atomic ratios of Mo, V, W, Cu, A, B,<br>
C, and 0 such that b=2-14,c=0-12,d=0.1-5, e<br><br>
=0-5, f = 0 -5, and g = 0 - 20 are satisfied when a =<br>
12 is fixed, and x represents a numerical value which is fixed<br>
by the oxidizing states of the relevant elements) may be cited.<br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas which is obtained from the<br>
reactor 10 generally contains 10 - 20 wt. % of acrylic acid,<br>
0.2 - 1*0 wt. % of acetic acid, and 5 - 15 wt. % of water.<br>
The acrylic acid-containing gas which is obtained by<br>
the reaction of catalytic gas phase oxidation is supplied<br>
to an acrylic acid absorbing column 20. The process which<br>
ensues therein is directed to absorbing the acrylic acid<br>
contained in the gas obtained by the process for reaction<br>
with an aqueous absorbing solvent. The reaction conditions<br>
such as the composition of gas components in the reaction<br>
gas, the composition of the aqueous absorbing solvent, and<br>
the temperature of the absorption which are used for this<br>
process may be any of the sets of conditions which are used<br>
in the heretofore known processes for the reaction of acrylic<br>
acid. When the acrylic acid-containing gas contains<br>
unaltered acrolein, the acrylic acid-containing gas may be<br>
supplied to the acrylic acid absorbing column 20 after the<br>
acrolein has been removed as by distillation or diffusion.<br>
It may be otherwise supplied to the absorbing column 2 0 after<br>
the gas has been cooled. This is because the degree with which<br>
the absorption efficiency is exalted increases in accordance<br>
as the gas temperature is lowered.<br>
The absorbing column 20 to be used herein may be any<br>
of such known absorbing columns as plate column, packed column,<br>
wetted wall tower, and spray tower. Generally, this absorbing<br>
column 20 is preferred to be a plate column or a packed column.<br>
In the case of the packed column, the interior thereof is<br>
packed regularly or irregularly with a filler having a large<br>
surface area and exhibiting air permeability. The gas-liquid<br><br>
contact is effected on the surface of the packed bed filled<br>
with the filler.<br>
In the absorbing column 20, while the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas is introduced thereto, an absorbing<br>
solvent 21 capable of absorbing acrylic acid is introduced<br>
from the upper part into this column to bring into counter<br>
current contact with the gas mentioned above and to effect<br>
absorption of acrylic acid.<br>
As the absorbing solvent 21 so supplied, an aqueous<br>
absorbing solvent may be used. This solvent is at an advantage<br>
in being inexpensive and allowing exhaust water emanating<br>
from the process for the production of acrylic acid to be<br>
reused. The aqueous absorbing solvent is only required to<br>
contain at least 80 - 100 wt. % of water. One example of such<br>
an aqueous absorbing solvent may be composed of 0.1 - 5.0<br>
wt. % of acrylic acid, 0.1 - 10 wt. % of acetic acid, and<br>
80 - 99.8 wt. % of water. The absorbing solvent 21 to be used<br>
herein may be prepared in advance as formulated in the<br>
composition mentioned above. For example, a water phase in<br>
an oil-water separator 32 annexed to an azeotropic dehydrating<br>
column 30 may be circulated as the absorbing solvent 21 for<br>
acrylic acid to an acrylic acid absorbing column and used<br>
as such.<br>
The absorption efficiency of the absorbing solvent 21<br>
increases in accordance as the solvent temperature decreases .<br>
The absorbing solvent 21 is preferred to be supplied at a<br>
fixed temperature in the range of 0 - 35°C, particularly 5<br>
- 30°C. The amount of the solvent expressed in the liquid-gas<br>
ratio, namely the amount of the solvent (L) to the amount<br>
of the feed gas (m3), is set in the range of 2 - 15L/m3, preferably<br>
3 - 12 L/m3, and more preferably 5 - 10L/m3. The polymerization<br>
of acrylic acid occurs most readily when the mass ratio of<br><br>
acrylic acid and water is approximately 50:50. The absorption<br>
of acrylic acid can be effected efficiently by maintaining<br>
the mass ratio in the range mentioned above and preventing<br>
the polymerization.<br>
This invention, for the purpose of preventing the<br>
polymerization of such a polymerizing substance as acrylic<br>
acid, prefers the absorbing solvent 21 to contain therein<br>
at least one compound selected from the group consisting of<br>
N-oxyl compounds, phenol compounds, manganese salts such as<br>
manganese acetate, copper dialkyldithiocarbamates such as<br>
copper dibutylthiocarbamate, nitroso compounds and amine<br>
compounds, and phenothiazine. The nitroso compound includs<br>
such compounds as N-nitrosophenyl hydroxylamines or the salts<br>
thereof, for example, ammonium salts of N-nitrosophenyl<br>
hydroxylamine, p-nitrosophenol, N-nitrosodiphenyl amine and<br>
ammonium salts thereof which are decomposed by the conditions<br>
of the distilling column and the decomposed components thereof<br>
manifest an effect of inhibiting polymerization of easily<br>
polymerizing substance. The polymerization inhibitor which<br>
is contemplated by the present invention does not embrace<br>
such a substance as undergoes decomposition in the distilling<br>
column and gives such a product of decomposition as manifests<br>
an effect of inhibiting polymerization.<br>
The N-oxyl compound does not need to be particularly<br>
restricted. Any of the N-oxyl compounds which have been<br>
generally known heretofore as agents for inhibiting the<br>
polymerization of a vinyl compound may be used. Among other<br>
such N-oxyl compounds, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidinoxyls<br>
represented by the following formula (1):<br><br><br>
(wherein R1 stands for CH2, CHOH, CHCH2OH, CHCH2CH2OH, CHOCH2OH,<br>
CHOCH2CH2OH, CHCOOH, or C=O and R2 stands for a hydrogen atom<br>
or CH2OH) are used advantageously. It is preferable to use<br>
one or more compounds selected among 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl<br>
piperidinoxyl, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6, 6-tetramethyl piperidinoxyl,<br>
and 4,4',4"-tris-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidinoxyl)<br>
phosphites which give good effects in preventing<br>
polymerization, although any of N-oxyl compounds can be used<br>
without any limitation. Particularly when<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl	piperidinoxyl	or<br>
4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidinoxyl is used as the<br>
N-oxyl compound, since it forms a stabilizing agent without<br>
requiring to include any metal in the components, there is<br>
no possibility of corroding the metallic material of the<br>
equipment due to the presence of stabilizer and the vaste<br>
liquid can be easily treated.<br>
In this invention, the N-oxyl compound may be used in<br>
combination with an N-hydroxy-2,2,6,e-tetrame^hyl<br>
piperidine compound and a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine<br>
compound.<br>
As representative examples of the<br>
N-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compound,<br>
l,4-dihydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine and<br>
l-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine may be cited.<br>
These N-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compounds<br>
may be used either singly or in the form of a mixture of two<br>
or more members.<br><br>
As typical examples of the 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl<br>
piperidine compound. 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine and<br>
4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine may be cited.<br>
These may be used either singly or in the form of a mixture<br>
of two or more members. Incidentally,<br>
N-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compounds and<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compounds are possibly<br>
contained as impurities in commercially available products<br>
of N-oxyl compounds . The use of such a commercially available<br>
product of N-oxyl compound equals the use in combination with<br>
N-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compound and<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piprdidine compound mentioned above.<br>
As typical examples of the phenol compound, hydroquinone,<br>
methoquinone (p-methoxy-phenol) may be cited. The<br>
methoquinone proves favorable in respect that it excels the<br>
hydroquinone in the effect of preventing polymerization when<br>
it is used in combination with an N-oxyl compound and a<br>
phenothiazine compound. These phenol compounds may be used<br>
in the form of a mixture of two or morp members.<br>
As typical examples of the phenothiazine compound,<br>
phenothiazine, bis-(a-methylbenzyl)phenothiazine,<br>
3,7-dioctylphenothiaz ine,	and<br>
bis-(a-dimethylbenzyl)phenothiazine may be cited.<br>
The copper salt compound does not need to be particularly<br>
restricted. Either copper inorganic salts or copper organic<br>
salts can be used. As typical examples, copper<br>
dialkyldithiocarbamates, copper acetate, copper napthenate,<br>
copper acrylate, copper sulfate, copper nitrate, and copper<br>
chloride may be cited. These copper salt compounds are usable<br>
in the form of monovalent or divalent compounds. Among other<br>
copper salt compounds mentioned above, copper<br>
dialkyldithiocarbamates prove favorable from the viewpoint<br><br>
of effect.<br>
As typical examples of the copper dialkyldithiocarbamate,<br>
copper	dimethyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
diethyldithiocarbamate, copper dipropyldithiocarbamate,<br>
copper	dibutyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
dipentyldithiocarbamate, copper dihexyldithiocarbamate,<br>
copper	diphenyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
methylethyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
methylpropyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
methylbutyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
methylpentyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
methylhexyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
methylphenyldithiocarbamate, copper ethylpropyl<br>
dithiocarbamate, copper ethylbutyldithiocarbamate, copper<br>
ethylpentyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
ethylhexyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
ethylphenyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
propylbutyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
propylpentyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
propylhexyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
propylphenyldithio-carbamate,	copper<br>
butylpentyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
butylhexyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
butylphenyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
pentylhexyldithiocarbamate,	copper<br>
pentylphenyldithiocarbamate,	and copper<br>
hexylphenyldithiocarbamate may be cited. These copper<br>
dialkyldithiocarbamates may be a monovalent copper salt or<br>
a divalent copper salt. Among other copper<br>
dialkyldithiocarbamates cited above, copper<br>
dimethyldithiocarbamate, copper diethyldithiocarbamate,<br>
and copper dibutyldithiocarbamate prove favorable in respect<br><br>
of its effects and easy acquisition, and copper<br>
dibutyldithiocarbamate proves especially favorable.<br>
As typical examples of the manganese salt compound,<br>
manganese dialkyldithiocarbamates (wherein the two alkyl<br>
groups may be identical or different and each may be methyl,<br>
ethyl, propyl, or butyl), manganese diphenyldithicarbamate,<br>
manganese formate, manganese acetate, manganese octanoate,<br>
manganese naphthenate, manganese permanganate, and manganese<br>
salt compounds of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid may be<br>
cited. These manganese salt compounds may be used either<br>
singly or in the form of a mixture of two or more members.<br>
This invention prefers the absorbing solvent to contain<br>
one or more compounds selected from the group consisting of<br>
N-oxyl compounds, phenol compounds, manganese salts, copper<br>
dialkyldithiocarbamates, nitroso compounds, and amine<br>
compounds or one or more compounds mentioned above in<br>
combination with phenothiazine. Naturally, when the<br>
absorbing solvent can be prepared as a system of three or<br>
more components by the addition of one or more of these six<br>
kinds of compounds and phenothiazone compound, it will<br>
manifest an effect in inhibiting polymerization equal to or<br>
better than the effect produced in a two-component system.<br>
The amount of the polymerization inhibitor to be used<br>
does not need to be particularly restricted but may be properly<br>
selected to suit the operating conditions to be involved.<br>
It is preferable to set the total amount of the polymerization<br>
inhibitor to be used in the range of 3 - 3500 ppm (by mass)<br>
based on the mass of the acrylic acid in the reaction gas<br>
to be absorbed. As regards the preferred amount of the<br>
individual polymerization inhibitor to be used, this amount<br>
of the N-oxyl compound is in the range of 1 - 500 ppm based<br>
on the mass of the acrylic acid in the reaction gas, that<br><br>
of the manganese salt compound or the copper salt compound<br>
is in the range of 1 - 200 ppm based on the mass of the acrylic<br>
acid in the reaction gas, that of the nitroso compound is<br>
in the range of 1 - 500 ppm, that of the phenol compound is<br>
in the range of 1 - 500 ppm, that of the phenothiazine compound<br>
is in the range of 1 - 500 ppm,' that of<br>
N-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compound is in the<br>
range of 1 - 500 ppm, and that of 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine<br>
compound is in the range of 1 - 500 ppm.<br>
In this invention, the polymerization inhibitor is<br>
preferred to be introduced into the reaction system in the<br>
form of a solution having the polymerization inhibitor<br>
dissolved in a solvent, namely in the form of a polymerization<br>
inhibitor-containing solution. The site for supplying the<br>
polymerization inhibitor-containing solution and the method<br>
for the introduction thereof do not need to be particularly<br>
restricted. The solution may be introduced into the<br>
absorption column at any stage other than the stage for supply<br>
of the raw materia] and the stage for supply of the reflux<br>
to the distilling column. Intheabsorptioncolumn, the "stage<br>
for supply of the raw material" means a stage for supplying<br>
an acrylic acid-containing gas and the "stage for supply of<br>
the reflux" means a stage for supplying a absorbing solvent.<br>
When the polymerization inhibitor is mixed with a solvent<br>
to prepare a polymerization inhibitor-containing solution<br>
and then this solution is to be supplied, the polymerization<br>
inhibitor is consumed effectively because it is uniformly<br>
dispersed in the acrylic acid absorption column. As the<br>
solvent for the preparation of the solution mentioned above,<br>
the acrylic acid-containing solution is available. When the<br>
absorbing solvent 21 which is used in the acrylic acid<br>
absorption column 20 contains acrylic acid, for example, the<br><br>
absorbing solvent 21 itself, part of the crude acrylic acid<br>
obtained in other process, a solution resulting from the<br>
thermal decomposition of an acrylic acid oligomer to be<br>
described specifically hereafter, or a bottom liquid of the<br>
absorption column may be used as an acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution. In the absorption column 20, it is particularly<br>
favorable to use waste liquid from a steam ejector used in<br>
the process for the production of acrylic acid as the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution. This is because the waste liquid<br>
from the steam ejector is an aqueous solution containing<br>
acrylic acid, which has nearly the same composition ratio<br>
as that of the liquid inside the absorption column and induces<br>
no decrease in the absorption efficiency in the absorption<br>
column. If the acrylic acid-containing solution to be used<br>
has a higher acrylic acid concentration than the acrylic acid<br>
composition in the absorption column, this excess would<br>
possibly result in decreasing the absorption efficiency or<br>
induce polymerization.<br>
The conditions for the operation of the absorption column<br>
2 0 vary with such factors as the temperature of the acrylic<br>
acid-containing gas to be supplied to the absorption column,<br>
the amount of the gas supplied per unit time, and the volume<br>
of the absorption column. Generally, the temperature of the<br>
top of the absorption column is in the range of 40 - 85°C.<br>
If this temperature is lower than 40°C, the shortage would<br>
be at a disadvantage in necessitating plant investment for<br>
cooling and entailing consumption of cooling energy,<br>
increasing the condensation of a substance having a lower<br>
boiling point than acrylic acid, and consequently degrading<br>
the purity of acrylic acid in the bottom liquid of the<br>
absorption column. Conversely, if the temperature exceeds<br>
80°C, the excess would result in increasing the loss of acrylic<br><br>
acid through the top of the absorption column and possibly<br>
lowering the yield of product.<br>
The pressure at the top of the absorption column 20 is<br>
in the range of 0 - 30 kPa (gauge pressure). If this pressure<br>
is lower than 0 kPa (gauge pressure), the shortage would result<br>
in necessitating a vacuum device and entailing plant<br>
investment and cost of energy. If the pressure exceeds 3 0<br>
kPa (gauge pressure), the excess would be at a disadvantage<br>
in necessitating a big capacity blower used for supplying<br>
a raw material gas to a reactor for catalytic gas phase<br>
oxidation and consequently entailing plant investment and<br>
cost of energy. When an exhaust gas from the top of the column<br>
is circulated to the realtor 10, diluting gas and unaltered<br>
raw material components can be effectively utilized.<br>
In this invention, the aforementioned adjustment is<br>
preferred to set the amount of the liquid wetting the absorption<br>
column per cross-sectional area of the column at a level of<br>
not less than 0.3 m3/m2-h, preferably not less than 1 m3/m2-h.<br>
The term "amount of wetting liquid" is referred to as a value<br>
obtained by dividing the amount of the liquid [m3] supplied<br>
per unit time onto one shelf by the cross-sectional area of<br>
the column. When this condition is satisfied, the interior<br>
of the absorption column is infallibly given a wetted state<br>
and the amount of the wetting liquid proves proper. Since<br>
the liquid is stored in a proper amount on the gas-liquid<br>
contact device, the state of the column wetted with the liquid<br>
and the state of the column avoiding drift and stagnation<br>
of gas or liquid can be both realized without fail.<br>
The bottom liquid of the absorption column 20 is cooled<br>
with a cooler (not shown) annexed to the bottom part of the<br>
column and then circulated to the absorption column to increase<br>
the concentration of acrylic acid in the bottom liquid.<br><br>
Generally, in the bottom liquid of the absorption column 20,<br>
namely the aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution, such<br>
by-products as propylene remaining in an unaltered state,<br>
such by-products as formaldehyde, acrolein, furfural,<br>
benzaldehyde, formic acid, acetic acid, maleic acid, and<br>
acrylic acid oligomer, and additives such as polymerization<br>
inhibitor are present in addition to acrylic acid.<br>
In this invention, the aqueous acrylic acid-containing<br>
solution mentioned above is led to the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column 30 and subjected, in conjunction with an azeotropic<br>
solvent supplied thereto, to azeotropic distillation.<br>
Subsequently to the process for obtaining the aqueous acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution, this invention prefers to install<br>
a tank and/or a cooler to cool the substance destined to be<br>
transferred to the subsequent process before the subsequent<br>
process is carried out. For example, the aqueous acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution, when necessary, is supplied to a<br>
distillation column 22 and deprived of such low boiling<br>
substance as acrolein therein, then the bottom liquid of the<br>
column is transferred via a pump 23 to a cooler 24, and the<br>
aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution which has been<br>
cooled herein is stored in a tank 25. By cooling this solution<br>
before it is transferred to the tank 25, it is made possible<br>
to cool the solution infallibly, decrease the retention time<br>
in the high-temperature state, and repress the amount of an<br>
oligomer to be formed. Optionally, the bottom liquid of the<br>
absorption column may be transferred to the tank without being<br>
passed through the distillation column 22, transferred via<br>
the pump 23 to the cooler 24, and then circulated to the tank<br>
25 and transferred to the subsequent process as well. As<br>
typical examples of the cooler, shell-and-tube type heat<br>
exchangers, plate type heat exchangers, and spiral type heat<br><br>
exchangers which have been heretofore known to the art may-<br>
be cited. Low boiling substances which can be removed in the<br>
distillation column 22 can be removed even in the azeotropic<br>
dehydration column 30. The separation of such low boiling<br>
substance can be effected as with a light-ends cut column<br>
which is separately installed. In this respect, theaqueous<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution contemplated by this<br>
invention broadly involves the water-containing acrylic acid<br>
prior to the transfer to the azeotropic dehydration column<br>
or the light-ends cut column and equals to the bottom liquid<br>
of the absorption column and the bottom liquid of the column<br>
obtained after the subsequent distillation. The cooling<br>
temperature for the aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
in the tank is preferred to be in the range of 20 - 50°C. Then,<br>
the aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution in the tank 2 5<br>
is supplied to the azeotropic dehydration column 30.<br>
As the azeotropic dehydration column 30, such known<br>
columns as plate column, packed column, wetted wall column,<br>
and spray column are usable. The azeotropic column 30f<br>
similarly to -che absorption column 2 0 mentioned above, is<br>
generally preferred to be a plate column or a packed column.<br>
Incidentally, the preferred number of theoretical plates in<br>
the azeotropic dehydration column 30 is in the range of .5<br>
- 30.<br>
As typical examples of the azeotropic solvent to be used<br>
in this invention, solvents containing at least one member<br>
selected from the group consisting of heptane, dimethyl<br>
cyclohexane, ethyl cyclohexane, toluene, ethyl benzene,<br>
chlorobenzene, xylene, and mixtures thereof;<br>
solvents containing at least one member selected from<br>
the group consisting of diethyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone,<br>
methylpropyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, methyl-t-butyl<br><br>
ketone, n~propyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, ethyl acrylatae,<br>
methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, vinyl acrylate,<br>
n-propyl acrylate, allyl acetate, isopropenyl acetate, vinyl<br>
propionate, propyl propionate, methyl crotonate, methyl<br>
valeate, ethyl butyrate, dibutyl ether, and mixtures thereof;<br>
and<br>
mixed solvents formed of a solvent containing at least<br>
one member selected from the group consisting of heptane,<br>
dimethyl cyclohexane, ethyl cyclohexane, toluene, ethyl<br>
benzene, chlorobenzene, xylene, and mixtures thereof with<br>
a solvent containing at least one member selected from the<br>
group consisting of diethyl ketone, diisopropyl ketone,<br>
methylpropyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, methyl-t-butyl<br>
ketone, n-propyl acetate, n-butyl acetate, ethyl acrylatae,<br>
methyl methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, vinyl acrylate,<br>
n-propyl acrylate, allyl acetate, isopropenyl acetate, vinyl<br>
propionate, propyl propionate, methyl crotonate, methyl<br>
valeate, ethyl butyrate, dibutyl ether, and mixtures thereof<br>
may be cited.<br>
More preferably, solvents containing at least one member<br>
selected from the group consisting of heptane, toluene, and<br>
mixtures thereof; solvents containing at least one member<br>
selected from the group consisting of ethyl methacrylate,<br>
methylisobutyl ketone, n-propyl acrylate, n-butyl acetate,<br>
and mixtures thereof; and a mixed solvent formed of a solvent<br>
containing at least one member selected from the group<br>
consisting of heptane, toluene, and mixtures thereof with<br>
a solvent containing at least one member selected from the<br>
group consisting of ethyl methacrylate, methylisobutyl ketone,<br>
n-propyl acrylate, n-butyl acetate, and mixtures thereof may<br>
be cited.<br>
The amount of the azeotropic solvent to be used cannot<br><br>
be uniquely defined because it is fixed by such factors as<br>
the water content of the aqueous acrylic acid-containinq<br>
solution supplied to the azeotropic dehydration column and<br>
the kind of azeotropic solvent to be used. It can be used<br>
at the known proportion adopted for the purpose of azeotrope.<br>
The amount of the azeotropic solvent is preferred to be large<br>
particularly from the viewpoint of preventing polymerization<br>
of acrylic acid. If it is unduly large, however, the excess<br>
would be at a disadvantage in necessitating a large amount<br>
of energy for distillation.<br>
The temperature of the top of the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column 30 may be properly selected, depending on such factors<br>
as the water content and the amount of by-product present<br>
in the aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution to be supplied,<br>
the amount of feed liquid per unit time, the temperature of<br>
the feed liquid, the degree of dehydration aimed at, the kind<br>
of other component to be separated and the content thereof,<br>
and the kind of distillation column incorporated in the process<br>
for purifying acrylic acid. Generally, the pressure at the<br>
top of the column is in the range of 20 - 200 hPa (abs.) and<br>
the temperature of the top of the column is decided by the<br>
azeotropic composition which is proper for this operating<br>
pressure. The operation of the azeotrop.LC dehydration column<br>
30 is rendered efficient by providing it with an oil-water<br>
separator, introducing the distillate from the top of the<br>
column into the oil-water separator, separating the<br>
distillate into an oil phase (azeotropic solvent phase) 31<br>
and a water phase 32, refluxing the oil phase 31 at a reflux<br>
ratio in the range of 0.5 - 10 to the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column 30, and circulating the water phase 32 to the absorption<br>
column 20 and used therein as the absorbing solvent 21.<br>
Consequently, the bottom liquid of the azeotropic dehydration<br><br>
column 30 acquires a composition having a water content of<br>
not more than 0.05 wt. % and an acetic acid concentration<br>
in the range of 0.02 - 3 wt. %.<br>
The azeotropic dehydration column 30 prefers proper<br>
addition thereto of a polymerization inhibitor for the purpose<br>
of preventing acrylic acid from undergoing unwanted<br>
polymerization. As the polymerization inhibitor, the<br>
typical examples cited in the paragraph dealing with the<br>
absorption column 20 may be used either singly or in the form<br>
of a mixture of two or more members.<br>
This invention prefers the polymerization inhibitor to<br>
be supplied in conjunction with acrylic acid. While water<br>
and the solvent are vaporized in the part of the distillation<br>
column above the stage for supply, acrylic acid escapes the<br>
vaporization and transfers to the bottom side of the column.<br>
Thus, the presence of acrylic acid is considered to be effective<br>
in preventing the polymerization inhibitor from being<br>
precipitated because the acrylic acid entrains the<br>
polymerization inhibitor. When the product of the thermal<br>
decomposition of the acrylic acid oligomer which will be<br>
described specifically herein below is used as the acrylic<br>
acid, it serves as an effective utilization of acrylic acid<br>
and contributes to the improvement of the productivity. When<br>
the acrylic acid is supplied to the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column 30, it will be at an advantage in enhancing the quality<br>
of product and preventing the polymerization inhibitor from<br>
being precipitated. It is inferred that while the by-produced<br>
maleic acid, when absorbed in water, is present in the aqueous<br>
solution in the form of hydrous maleic acid, it is gradually<br>
anhydridized when heated by repeating the work of distillation.<br>
Also in the acrylic acid recovered by the thermal decomposition,<br>
the water formed by this anhydridization is contained. By<br><br>
circulating this water to the azeotropic dehydration column<br>
and dehydrating it therein, therefore, it is made possible<br>
to lower the water content in the product. This dehydration<br>
process is at a further advantage in preventing the<br>
polymerization inhibitor from undergoing precipitation.<br>
According to this invention, the efficiency of production<br>
can be further improved by repressing the concentration of<br>
the acrylic acid oligomer (acrylic acid dimer and trimer)<br>
in the bottom liquid of the azeotropic dehydration column<br>
to a level of not more than 5 wt. %, more preferably to a<br>
level of not more than 3 wt. %.<br>
Though the treatment of azeotropic dehydration removes<br>
water and low boiling substance contained in the aqueous<br>
acrylic acid-containing solution, the process for hydration<br>
and the process for separation of the low boiling substance<br>
may be carried out separately of each other. Generally, after<br>
the treatment for dehydration, the product by this dehydration<br>
can be refined by performing the process for the separation<br>
of high boiling substance either alone or in combination with<br>
other heretofore known method for purification. Not solely<br>
by distillation, the purification of acrylic acid may be<br>
effected by crystallization. Owing to the wide range allowed<br>
for the selection of a process of purification, this invention<br>
designates what is obtained by removing water and low boiling<br>
substances from the aqueous acrylic acid-containing solution<br>
as the crude acrylic acid and transfers it to the process<br>
for separation of high boiling substance.<br>
In this invention, it is preferable to install a cooler<br>
or a tank between the process for azeotropic dehydration and/or<br>
the process for separation of low boiling substance and the<br>
process for separation of high boiling substance to cool the<br>
crude acrylic acid. The crude acrylic acid is cooled by<br><br>
transferring the bottom liquid with a pump 34 to a cooler<br>
35 and the crude acrylic acid cooled therein is stored in<br>
a tank 36. By this transfer similarly to the transfer to the<br>
tank 25, it is made possible to cool the liquid infallibly<br>
by the cooling, decrease the time of retention in the high<br>
temperature part, and repress the amount of an oligomer<br>
suffered to occur. The cooling temperature of the crude<br>
acrylic acid in the tank 36 is preferred to be in the range<br>
of 20 - 50°C. As the cooler, shell-and-tube type heat<br>
exchangers, plate type heat exchangers, and spiral type heat<br>
exchangers which have been heretofore known to the art are<br>
usable. Then, the crude acrylic acid in the tank 3 6 is supplied<br>
to a heavy-ends cut column 40. The heavy-ends cut column 40<br>
constitutes a process for heating the liquid under treatment<br>
and expelling acrylic acid by distillation through the top<br>
of a distillation column. From the viewpoint of the thermal<br>
efficiency, the feed liquid to the column 40 is preferred<br>
to have as high a temperature as permissible. If the<br>
temperature of the crude acrylic acid is unduly high, the<br>
excess of temperature would result in increasing the speed<br>
of oligomer formation, enlarging the possibility of<br>
polymerization, rendering easy the occurrence of a polymer<br>
in the heavy-ends cut column, degrading the final yiao.d of<br>
acrylic acid, and possibly hindering the continuous operation<br>
in consequence of the occurrence of a polymer. If the<br>
temperature falls short of 20°C and approximates closely to<br>
the freezing point, the shortage would be at a disadvantage<br>
in possibly freezing the content of the column and increasing<br>
the amount of heat to be applied during the process for the<br>
removal of high boiling substance. In consideration of the<br>
final efficiency of production based on the comparison with<br>
the amount of a polymer suffered to occur and the thermal<br><br>
efficiency, this invention has elected to cool the treated<br>
liquid between the subsequent processes. In the present<br>
invention, the yield can be improved at a highest level by<br>
cooling the treated liquid between the treatment for<br>
azeotropic dehydration and the treatment of high boiling<br>
substance.<br>
As the heavy-ends cut column 40, such known columns as<br>
plate column, packed column, wetted wall column, and spray<br>
column are usable. The heavy-ends cut column, similarly to<br>
the azeotropic dehydration column mentioned above, is<br>
generally preferred to be a plate column or a packed column.<br>
These columns may contain a packing or stepped plates. The<br>
number of theoretical plates is in the range of 3 - 30,<br>
preferably 5-20.<br>
The distillation in the heavy-ends cut column 40 may<br>
be performed under the conditions of distillation which have<br>
been heretofore known to the art. Specifically, the pressure<br>
at the top of the column is in the range of 20 - 200 hPa (abs. )<br>
and the temperature of the bottom of the column is not higher<br>
than 12 0°C.<br>
The heavy-ends cut column 40, similarly to the azeotropic<br>
dehydration column 30 mentioned above, prefers addition<br>
thereto of a proper amount of polymerization inhibitor with<br>
the object of preventing acrylic acid from undergoing unwanted<br>
polymerization.<br>
In this invention, the polymerization inhibitor is<br>
preferred to be introduced to any of the distillation columns<br>
at a stage other than the stage for supply of the raw material<br>
or the stage for supply of the reflux. More preferably, a<br>
polymerization inhibitor which conforms to the composition<br>
of the content of the column is injected at any of the stages<br>
which is present away from the stage for supply of the raw<br><br>
material and before the stage for supply of the reflux.<br>
Specifically, the polymerization inhibitor is supplied in<br>
conjunction with the acrylic acid-containing solution by an<br>
atomizing means through one or more spraying nozzles disposed<br>
in advance in the distilling column. The reason for the<br>
atomization is that it enables the solution containing the<br>
polymerization inhibitor to be sprayed in a wide range inside<br>
the distillation column and allows the polymerization to be<br>
prevented effectively. Even when the injection is made at<br>
the stage for supply of a raw material or the stage for supply<br>
of a reflux, the polymerization inhibitor may be injected<br>
as separated from the raw material and the reflux through<br>
another spraying nozzle or the polymerization inhibitor may<br>
be mixed in advance with the raw material and the reflux and<br>
the resultant mixture is injected through the spraying nozzle.<br>
Since the acrylic acid concentration does not vary very much<br>
in the heavy-ends cut column, the polymerization inhibitor<br>
may be supplied at a stage other than the stage for supply<br>
of the raw material and the staae for supply of the reflux<br>
or it may be injected at the stage for supply of the rawmaterial<br>
and/or the stage for supply of the reflux. In this case, it<br>
is preferable to use as the acrylic acid part of the distillate<br>
obtained through the top of the column. The reason for the<br>
use of part of the distillate is that since the heavy-ends<br>
cut column is a device for obtaining acrylic acid, the use<br>
of the distillate substantially identical in quality with<br>
the product (raw material as ester and high purity acrylic<br>
acid) results in stabilizing the quality of product.<br>
In this invention, it is permissible to condense the<br>
acrylic acid-containing distillate gas obtained through the<br>
top of the heavy-ends cut column 40 and supply at least part<br>
of the resultant acrylic acid-containing condensate liquid<br><br>
to the azeotropic dehydration column 30. Incidentally, the<br>
condensate liquid generally is a finished product of acrylic<br>
acid used as the raw material for the ester and high purity<br>
acrylic acid and the bottom liquid of the column contains<br>
the polymerization inhibitor, acrylic acid oligomer, and<br>
other high boiling substances . In this invention, the bottom<br>
liquid is designated as a high boiling substance-containing<br>
solution and is subjected to a process for thermally<br>
decomposing the acrylic acid oligomer contained therein and<br>
consequently recovering acrylic acid.<br>
The thermal decomposition of the acrylic acid oligomer<br>
is carried out in a thermal decomposition tank 51. The thermal<br>
decomposition tank 51 does not need to be particularly<br>
discriminated on account of its form. Since the oligomer has<br>
high viscosity, possibly shows precipitation of a solid<br>
substance, and displays an inferior liquid property, the tank<br>
is preferred to be endowed with an inclination toward the<br>
liquid outlet and provided with a liquid circulating and/or<br>
stirring device capable of uniformizing the composition<br>
inside the tank. The L.oncentration of maleic acid contained<br>
in the decomposed liquid obtained by the thermal decomposition<br>
is set so as to be not more than 5 wt. %, preferably in the<br>
range of 0 - 3 wt. %, and more preferably in the range of<br>
0 - 1 wt. %. The reason for restricting the malic acid<br>
concentration to not more than 5 wt. % is that the maleic<br>
acid readily converts into fumaric acid which is an isomer<br>
and the fumaric acid having a high melting point precipitates<br>
as a solid.<br>
For the purpose of obtaining the decomposed liquid of<br>
this description, it is preferred to provide the decomposition<br>
tank 51 in the lower part thereof with a distilling device<br>
such as, for example, a maleic acid separation column 46.<br><br>
The high boiling substance-containing solution is supplied<br>
to the maleic acid separation column 46, the bottom liquid<br>
of the column is concentrated with a thin film evaporator<br>
50 , and the oligomer is decomposed in the thermal decomposition<br>
tank 51. The liquid obtained from the thermal decomposition<br>
tank 51 may be again concentrated in the thin film evaporator<br>
50 and the acrylic acid obtained in consequence of the thermal<br>
decomposition may be recovered. Since the acrylic acid is<br>
vaporized in the thin film evaporator 50, this acrylic acid<br>
may be recovered through the top of the maleic acid separation<br>
column 46.<br>
The maleic acid separation column 46 has a number of<br>
theoretical plates of 1 - 10, preferably 1 - 5. The<br>
distillation in this column is preferred to be performed at<br>
a column top pressure in the range of 10 - 150 hPa (abs.)<br>
and a column bottom temperature of not higher than 120°C. The<br>
thin film evaporator 50 is preferred over a shell-and-tube<br>
type heat exchanger in respect that it is capable of<br>
concentrating even a liquid of high viscosity. This device<br>
does not need co be discriminated between a horizontal type<br>
and a vertical type.<br>
The thermal decomposition temperature in the thermal<br>
decomposition tank 51 is generally in the range of 120 - 2 2 0°^<br>
and particularly preferably in the range of 120 - 160°C. While<br>
the retention time (amount of liquid reserved in the thermal<br>
decomposition tank/amount of waste oil) is not generally<br>
defined because it varies with the temperature of thermal<br>
decomposition, it is generally required to be in the range<br>
of 20 - 50 hours. Thus, the thermal decomposition tank 51<br>
needs to provide with a heating means . It suffices, however,<br>
to maintain the temperature of the thermal decomposition by<br>
externally jacketing the tank and/or internally (or<br><br>
externally) disposing a heat exchanger and utilizing such<br>
a heat medium as steam or oil.<br>
This invention permits addition of a polymerization<br>
inhibitor to the high boiling substance-containing solution<br>
prior to subjecting this solution to thermal decomposition<br>
in the maleic acid separation column 46, the thin film<br>
evaporator 50, or the thermal decomposition tank 51. This<br>
addition results in efficiently preventing the polymerization<br>
and possibly promoting the thermal decomposition. As the<br>
polymerization inhibitor capable of promoting the thermal<br>
decomposition,	4,4',4"-tris-(2,2,6,6-tetramethyl<br>
piperidinoxyl)phosphite and one or more of the compounds,<br>
namely, 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidinoxyls represented by<br>
the following formula (1):<br><br>
(wherein R1 stands for CH2, CHOH, CHCH2OH, CHCH2CH2OH, CHOCH2OH,<br>
CHOCH2CH2OH, CHCOOH, or C=O and R2 stands for a hydrogen atom<br>
or CH2OH), one or more of the N,hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl<br>
piperidine compounds such as, for example,<br>
1,4-dihydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine and<br>
l-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine, and<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine compounds such as, for example,<br>
2,2,6,6-tetramethyl	piperidine	and<br>
4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl piperidine may be used in<br>
combination among other examples cited above.<br>
In this invention, the acrylic acid which is recovered<br>
by thermally decomposing the oligomer mentioned above is<br>
preferred to be supplied to the process for dehydration. This<br><br>
is because the purification by elimination of such impurities<br>
as water to be contained in the subsequent process will be<br>
attained and the polymerization inhibitor will be put to<br>
effective utilization. To be specific, the dehydration<br>
proves favorable, both in terms of lowering the water content<br>
in the product thereby heightening the quality of the product<br>
and preventing the polymerization inhibitor from being<br>
precipitated.<br>
Incidentally, the acrylic acid expelled by distillation<br>
through the top of the heavy-ends cut column 40 is enabled<br>
to produce an acrylic ester when it is supplied to a process<br>
for the production of the acrylic ester.<br>
Now, a method for producing an acrylic ester from acrylic<br>
acid will be explained below as one mode of embodying this<br>
invention.<br>
To an esterif ication reactor 60 packed with a strongly<br>
acidic cation-exchange resin as a catalyst, the acrylic acid<br>
obtained in the heavy-ends cut column 40 is supplied and then<br>
an alcohol and other are charged to the reactor 60 to form<br>
an ester. Then, the reaction solution is introduced into an<br>
acid separation column 80, which by distillation expels an<br>
acrylic ester, unaltered alcohol, water, and other low boiling<br>
substance through the top thereof. Subsequently, the<br>
distillate emanating from the top of the acid separation column<br>
80 is introduced into an oil-water separator and is separated<br>
therein into an oil phase 81 containing an acrylic ester and<br>
a water phase 82 having water and alcohol as main components.<br>
The water phase 82 is transferred to an alcohol recovery column<br>
90 like a water phase 72 in the oil-water separator which<br>
is the distillate through the top of the water-separation<br>
column 70, and the oil phase 81 is supplied to a light-ends<br>
cut column 100. In this while, part of the oil phase 81 may<br><br>
be refluxed to the acid separation column 80. In the<br>
light-ends cut column 100, the acrylic ester is separated<br>
through the bottom and supplied to a refining column 110 and<br>
the produced acrylic ester 111 is expelled by distillation<br>
through the top. Incidentally, the alcohol which has been<br>
expelled by distillation through the top of the alcohol<br>
recovery column 90 may be circulated to the oil phase 81 in<br>
the oil-water separator annexed to the acid separation column<br>
80. The water, alcohol, and other low boiling substances<br>
expelled by distillation through the top of the light-ends<br>
cut column 100 are circulated to the esterif ication reactor<br>
60 through the column provided in the upper part of the<br>
esterification reactor 60.<br>
In this process for the production of an acrylic ester,<br>
the bottom liquid of the acid separation column 80 eventually<br>
contains acrylic acid dimer and acrylic acid dimer ester and<br>
Michael type adducts such as alkoxypropionic acids and<br>
alkoxypropionic esters represented by the following formula<br>
[ II ] together with the raw material components such as acrylic<br>
acid.<br><br>
(wherein m is an integer in the range of 1 - 5, R1 and R2<br>
independently stand for a hvdrogen atom or an alkyl group,<br>
and -X- stands for -CH2CH2- or -CH(CH3)-, providing that when<br>
m is not less than 2, a plurality of -X-'s may be identical<br>
or different).<br>
Thus, the bottom liquid of the acid separation column<br>
80 may be circulated to the esterification reactor 60 as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1 or it may be supplied to a separately<br>
provided thin film evaporator and decomposition tank (not<br>
shown) to decompose the acrylic acid oligomer contained<br>
therein. The components contained in the bottom liquid are<br><br>
decomposed and further converted in the thin film evaporator<br>
into an alcohol, acrylic acid, and an acrylic acid ester.<br>
When these components are introduced again into the<br>
esterification reactor 60, they constitute effective<br>
utilization of components. Incidentally, the decomposition<br>
of the bottom liquid may be promoted by the addition of the<br>
aforementioned N-oxyl compound.<br>
The method for the production of an acrylic ester cons ists<br>
in obtaining an ester by subjecting acrylic acid and an alcohol<br>
to a reaction of dehydration. As typical examples of the<br>
preferred alcohol, various species of alcohol such as methanol,<br>
ethanol, n-butanol, isobutanol, sec-butanol, t-butanol,<br>
1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-pentanol, cyclopentanol,<br>
1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, cyclohexanol, 1-heptanol,<br>
2-heptanol, 3-heptanol, 1-octanol, isooctanol,<br>
2-ethylhexanol, isononyl alcohol, and lauryl alcohol may be<br>
cited. They may be in a linear form or in a branched form.<br>
They may be used either singly or in the form of a combination<br>
of two or more members . Incidentally, the reaction conditions<br>
and distillation conditions for each of the processes<br>
mentioned above may be arbitrarily selected from the known<br>
conditions.<br>
The acrylic acid which is obtained from the heavy-ends<br>
cut column 40 may be further refined as with a distillation<br>
column to obtain acrylic acid of high purity. For example,<br>
a conventional primary amine such as hydrazine hydrate and<br>
phenyl hydrazine and/or the salts thereof is added to the<br>
acrylic acid in an amount in the range of 1.0 - 10.0 moles,<br>
preferably 1.0 - 5.0 moles, per mol of the aldehyde contained<br>
therein, and after a treating agent is further added thereto,<br>
theresultant mixture is subjected to vacuum distillation<br>
with a known distillation column. This distillation is<br><br>
performed, for example, in a flash column fitted with a mist<br>
separator under a column top pressure in the range of 10 -<br>
150 hPa (abs.) at a column top temperature in the range of<br>
35 - 90°C. By this treatment, the concentrations of such<br>
aldehydes as furfural, acrolein, and benzaldehyde can be<br>
decreased to less than 10 ppm. Acrylic acid of equal purity<br>
can be obtained by using a crystallization device. When a<br>
water-absorbent resin is produced from acrylic acid, it<br>
possibly proves unfavorable for a given use because of its<br>
odor or stimulus to the skin. Acrylic acid of high purity<br>
obtained by such purification can be preferably used in this<br>
case. In this invention, the acrylic acid of high purity thus<br>
obtained is supplied to a polyacrylic acid (salt) production<br>
process 120 to produce polyacrylic acid (salt), which may<br>
be used to produce a water-absorbent resin, for example.<br>
When polyacrylic acid is produced from acrylic acid of<br>
high purity, this invention prefers the purified acrylic acid<br>
to be transferred with the pump 42 to the cooler 43 and the<br>
acrylic acid cooled in the cooler 43 to be stored in the tank<br>
44. The reason for commending this process is that by this<br>
cooling, it is made possible to cool the liquid infallibly,<br>
decrease the retention time in the high temperature part,<br>
and repress the amount of the oligomer suffered to form. The<br>
cooling temperature of acrylic acid in the tank is preferred<br>
to be in the range of 20 - 50°C.<br>
The polyacrylic acid (salt) production process 120 is<br>
capable of producing polyacrylic acid (salt) by sequentially<br>
introducing the acrylic acid mentioned above to a<br>
neutralization process 121, a polymerization process 122,<br>
a drying process 123, and a cooling process 124 and subjecting<br>
it to the relevant treatments therein. When acrylic acid is<br>
not neutralized, polyacrylic acid is obtained. The<br><br>
neutralization process mentioned above is performed<br>
optionally. The acrylic acid may be given a treatment adapted<br>
to improve a varying physical property. A cross-linking<br>
process may be additionally performed during or after the<br>
polymerization process.<br>
The neutralization process is an arbitrary additive<br>
process. Forexample, a method which comprises mixing acrylic<br>
acid or a produced polyacrylic acid (salt) with a prescribed<br>
amount of a powder or aqueous solution of a basic substance<br>
may be cited. This method does not need to be particularly<br>
restricted but may be properly selected from the known methods .<br>
This neutralization process may be carried out prior to<br>
polymerization (neutralized in the form of a monomer), during<br>
the polymerization, or after the polymerization (neutralized<br>
in the form of a gel), or both before and after the<br>
polymerization. Though the diagram depicts a process which<br>
performs polymerization after neutralization, the<br>
neutralization may be performed, when necessary, after the<br>
polymerization. In this case, the conf iauration of equipment<br>
and the sequence of component processes may be properly altered<br>
to suit the occasion. A polymerization device and a<br>
neutralization device may be identical or different.<br>
The basic substance to be used for neutralizing acrylic<br>
acid may be properly selected among the known basic substances<br>
such as, for example, (hydrogen) carbonates, hydroxides of<br>
alkali metals, ammonia, and organic amines. The radio of<br>
neutralization of acrylic acid does not need to be particularly<br>
restricted but may be properly selected in the range of 3 0<br>
- 100 mol% andpref erably 50 - 80mol% . When the heat of reaction<br>
which is generated during the neutralization is required to<br>
be removed, it suffices to introduce the product emitting<br>
the heat of reaction into a proper cooling means such as,<br><br>
for example, a cooling device represented by a cooling tower.<br>
The acrylic acid salt solution resulting from the<br>
neutralization, when necessary, is introduced into a<br>
polymerization process. The method of polymerization in this<br>
process does not need to be particularly restricted. When<br>
the polymerization needs to use a radical polymerization<br>
initiator, it may be performed by any of the known methods<br>
of polymerization such as stripping polymerization, electron<br>
stripping polymerization, and photosensitized<br>
polymerization. In the polymerization process, acrylic acid<br>
may be neutralized as occasion demands and then subjected<br>
in the form of an aqueous solution of acrylic acid (salt)<br>
of a concentration preferably of not less than 10 wt. %, more<br>
preferably not less than 2 0 wt. % and preferably of not more<br>
than 80 wt. %, more preferably not more than 7 0 wt. %.<br>
This invention allows various conditions such as the<br>
kind of polymerization initiator and the conditions for<br>
polymerization to be arbitrarily selected. Optionally,<br>
various known additives such =&gt;s cross-linking agent, other<br>
monomer, and even water-soluble chain transfer agent, and<br>
hydrophilic macromolecular substance may be added. For the<br>
polymerization process, reactors and devices selected<br>
arbitrarily may be used. Any of the polymerization devices<br>
in common use may be used without any particular restriction.<br>
The polyacrylic acid (salt) resulting from the<br>
polymerization is generally a polymer of the form of a hydrogel<br>
and, therefore, is further subjected to a drying process for<br>
the purpose of removing water. The method for this drying<br>
does not need to be particularly restricted. The polymer may<br>
be dried with any of the known drying devices such as hot<br>
air drier, fluidized bed drier, drum drier, and Nauter type<br>
drier at a proper drying temperature preferably in the range<br><br>
of 70 - 230 °C. As the heat medium to be supplied to a drying<br>
process 123, the vapor discharged in the process for the<br>
production of acrylic acid, particularly the heat of reaction<br>
emitted from the catalytic gas phase oxidizer may be utilized.<br>
The hydrogel, namely the hydrous polymer, of polyacrylic<br>
acid (salt) is thermally dried with a varying type of drier.<br>
The drying may be attained, for example, by exposing the<br>
hydrogel to the heating surface of such a conducting heat<br>
transfer drier as a drum drier or a paddle drier which has<br>
been heated with steam. From the viewpoint of decreasing the<br>
residual monomer content and exalting the drying efficiency,<br>
the hot air transfer drying which expose the hydrogel directly<br>
to the steam proves particularly preferable. Preferably, the<br>
hydrogel is dried with a steam-containing gas such as, for<br>
example, a hot air having a dew point preferably of not lower<br>
than 50°C, more preferably not lower than 60°C and preferably<br>
not higher than 9 0°C, more preferably not higher than 80°C<br>
and having a temperature preferably of not lower than 100°C,<br>
and more preferably not lower than 150°C and preferably not<br>
higher than 200°C, more preferably not higher thanl80°C becauba<br>
this drying promotes the decrease of the residual monomer<br>
content and the exaltation of the water-absorption ratio of<br>
the polyacrylic acid (salt). Incidentally, the duration &gt;)£<br>
drying is generally in the range of one minute to three hours,<br>
preferably five minutes to one hour.<br>
The polyacrylic acid (salt) which is obtained after the<br>
drying process is still hot at the time of its release from<br>
the drying device. Preferably, therefore, it is cooled in<br>
a cooling process 124 at a suitable temperature in the range<br>
of room temperature to 90°C, preferably 40 to 80°C. The method<br>
for cooling this polyacrylic acid (salt) does not need to<br>
be particularly restricted. It may be cooled, for example,<br><br>
by being blown with cold air or introduced into such a cooling<br>
device as a refrigerator.<br>
The polyacrylic acid (salt) which has been cooled to<br>
a prescribed temperature may be put to use in its unaltered<br>
form. Optionally, it may be further molded in a prescribed<br>
shape as by granulation or pulverization and then made to<br>
incorporate therein various additives such as reducing agent,<br>
flavoring agent, and binder so as to suit the purpose of<br>
application.<br>
This invention prefers the dried polyacrylic acid (salt)<br>
to be cooled. When the hydrogel is finely divided to a particle<br>
size in the approximate range of one - several mm and dried,<br>
the dried polyacrylic acid (salt) is in the form of dry<br>
particles measuring about one - several mm. Generally, the<br>
dried particles assume the form of an agglomerate. Thus , the<br>
dried polyacrylic acid (salt) may be optionally pulverized<br>
or further classified to obtain a polyacric acid (salt) powder<br>
having a weight average particle diameter in the range of<br>
10 - 1000 jum, preferably 100 - 800 |Am. When this powder and<br>
various modifying agents such as, for example, an aqueous<br>
solution of a surface cross-linking agent, pelletizing binder,<br>
and deodorant are added together, the application of a cooling<br>
process enhances the efficiency of pulverization and sharpens<br>
the particle diameter distribution and allows the various<br>
modifying agents to be uniformly added to the powder. Thus,<br>
the cooling process in this case can exalt various physical<br>
properties of the water-absorbent resin such as, for example,<br>
a water-absorption ratio under pressure while restraining<br>
dispersion among individual particles of powder.<br>
For this invention, it is preferable to introduce a<br>
polymerization inhibitor to any of the distillation columns<br>
at a stage other than the stage for supply of the raw material<br><br>
and the stage for supply of the reflux. Particularly, the<br>
site for supply of the polymerization inhibitor to the<br>
azeotropic dehydration column is preferred to be higher than<br>
the stage for supply of the raw material markedly different<br>
in composition and to be lower than the stage for supply of<br>
the reflux. The polymerization inhibitor in this case is<br>
preferred to be supplied together with the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution by the use of an atomizing injection<br>
means. Particularly in the azeotropic dehydration column,<br>
the acrylic acid which is recovered by thermally decomposing<br>
an acrylic acid oligomer is used efficiently as the acrylic<br>
acid-containing solution.<br>
Examples<br>
Now, this invention will be more specifically described<br>
below with reference to working examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Acrylic acid was produced by following the process flow<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1. First, by subjecting propylene to<br>
catalytic gas phase oxidation with a molecular oxygen in the<br>
presence of an oxidizing catalyst, a mixed gas containing<br>
7.1 vol. % of acrylic acid, 0.3 vol. % of acetic acid, and<br>
14.7 vol. % of water was obtained at <a rate of nm3></a>
This gas was introduced into an absorption column<br>
(cascade miniring 3P 10m) to obtain a bottom liquid at a rate<br>
of 8050 kg/h. This absorption column was operated with the<br>
top thereof kept under 1100 hPa abs. at 62°C. Through the<br>
top of the column, water obtained by mixing hydroquinone as<br>
a polymerization inhibitor, separated water occurring in an<br>
azeotropic dehydration column, and waste water generated from<br>
a vacuum generating device in a distillation column and<br>
containing 1.5 wt. % of acrylic acid and 5.4 wt. % of acetic<br><br>
acid was supplied as a absorbing water at a rate of 2720 kg/h.<br>
Part of the exhaust gas emanating through the top of the column<br>
was circulated to an oxidation reactor and the remainder<br>
thereof was released as the waste gas from the system. The<br>
bottom liquid of the absorption column was further distilled<br>
to obtain an aqueous acrylic acid solution containing 7 0 wt. %<br>
of acrylic acid, 3.4 wt. % of acetic acid, and 0.3 wt. % of<br>
maleic acid.<br>
The aqueous acrylic acid solution thus obtained was<br>
passed through a cooling device annexed to a tank interposed<br>
between the absorption column and the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column to be cooled to 40°C and the cooled aqueous solution<br>
was supplied together with part of the liquid at the top of<br>
a maleic acid separation column to the middle stage of the<br>
azeotropic dehydrating column provided with 50 sieve trays.<br>
The azeotropic dehydration column was operated under<br>
the conditions of 190 hPa abs. in column top pressure and<br>
1.0 in reflux ratio (total number of moles of the reflux per<br>
unit time/total number of moles of the distillate per unit<br>
time) to effect azeotropic beparation with toluene. The top<br>
liquid of the separation column was led together with the<br>
waste water from a steam ejector which was a vacuum generating<br>
device to a storage tank and separated therein into an organic<br>
phase and a water phase. As the polymerization inhibitor for<br>
the column, copper dibutyldithiocarbamate and hyqroduinone<br>
monomethyl ether were dissolved in the reflux, then the<br>
resultant mixture was introduced into the column together<br>
with the reflux. And hydroquinone dissolved in water were<br>
injected by spraying into the column together with part of<br>
the top liquid of a maleic acid separation column containing<br>
the acrylic acid recovered by thermally decomposing the<br>
oligomer from a stage intervening between the stage for supply<br><br>
of an aqueous acrylic acid solution and the stage for supply<br>
of the reflux. The concentration of the acrylic acid oligomer<br>
(acrylic acid dimer and trimer) in the bottom of the column<br>
was found to be 2 wt. %.<br>
The bottom liquid of the column was passed through a<br>
cooler annexed to a tank interposed between this column and<br>
a heavy-ends cut column to be cooled to 40°C and then supplied<br>
to the heavy-ends cut column provided with 45 sieve trays<br>
through the intermediary stage thereof. This column was<br>
operated under the conditions of 45 hPa abs. in tower top<br>
pressure and 1.4 in reflux ratio. Through the top of the column,<br>
acrylic acid was obtained at a rate of 5120 kg/h. The bottom<br>
liquid of this column which contained 31 wt. % of acrylic<br>
acid oligomer and 5 wt. % of maleic acid was supplied to a<br>
maleic acid separation column provided with five sieve trays<br>
through the bottom thereof.<br>
The column was provided in the bottom thereof with a<br>
thin film evaporator and a thermal decomposition tank and<br>
operated under the conditions of 45 hPa abs. in pressure and<br>
0.5 in reflux ratj.o to obtain acrylic acid containing 0.5<br>
wt. % of maleic acid at a rate of 400 kg/h through the top<br>
of the column. The acrylic acid thus obtained was used as<br>
the raw material for ester and high-purity acrylic acid. The<br>
high-purity acrylic acid was further used for the production<br>
of polyacrylic acid. Separately, the bottom liquid of the<br>
thin film evaporator was introduced into a thermal<br>
decomposition tank and subjected therein to thermal<br>
decomposition under the conditions of 150°C in temperature<br>
and 40 hours in retention time. Part of the bottom liquid<br>
formed in the tank was circulated to the thin film evaporator.<br>
To the heavy-ends cut column and the maleic acid separation<br>
column, a solution of copper dibutyl dithiocarbamate and<br><br>
hydroquinone monomethyl ether in acrylic acid was introduced<br>
as a polymerization inhibitor by spraying to a condenser.<br>
The waste oil containing 5.5 wt. % of acrylic acid and 39<br>
wt. % of acrylic acid oligomer (acrylic acid dimer and trimer)<br>
was discarded from the thermal decomposition tank at a rate<br>
of 170 kg/h. The plant was stopped after about three months'<br>
continued operation and then opened to test the interior.<br>
The test failed to detect any sign of problem. The results<br>
of working examples and a comparative experiment are shown<br>
in Table 1. In Table 1, (i) represents the case of injecting<br>
the polymerization inhibitor containing solution to stages<br>
other than the stage for supply of a raw material and the<br>
stage for supply of the reflux, (ii) the case of supplying<br>
the acrylic acid recovered by thermally decomposing the<br>
oligomer to the process of dehydration, (iii) the case of<br>
supplying the polymerization inhibitor containing solution<br>
together with an acrylic acid-containing solution with an<br>
atomizing injection means, and (iv) the case of adjusting<br>
the concentration of maleic acid contained in the acrylic<br>
acid solution recovered by thermally decomposing the oligomer<br>
contained in the high boiling substance-containing solution<br>
to below 5 wt. %. The symbol O represents actual application<br>
and the symbol - represents the absence of actual application.<br>
Example 2<br>
An operation was carried out by following the procedure<br>
of Example 1 while supplying hydroquinone dissolved in water<br>
together with an aqueous acrylic acid solution as part of<br>
the polymerization inhibitor to the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column at the stage for supply of the aqueous solution. The<br>
pressure loss in the azeotropic dehydration column showed<br>
a sign of rise in about one week' s continued operation. When<br>
the plant was opened and tested after about two months'<br><br>
continued operation, the deposition of a polymer was found<br>
on the sieve trays higher than the stage for supply of the<br>
aqueous acrylic acid solution.<br>
Example 3<br>
An operation was performed by following the procedure<br>
of Example 1 while supplying hydroquinone as part of the<br>
polymerization inhibitor directly to the azeotropic<br>
dehydration column without using the top liquid of a maleic<br>
acid separation column. On the day following the start of<br>
the operation, the azeotropic dehydration column showed a<br>
sign of an increase in the pressure loss. When the plant was<br>
opened to check the interior thereof after about one month's<br>
continued operation, the precipitation of the polymerization<br>
inhibitor occurred in the neighborhood of the stage for<br>
introduction of the polymerization inhibitor into the column<br>
and the holes in the trays were found to be blockage.<br>
Example 4<br>
An operation was performed by following the procedure<br>
of Example 1 while supplying the polymerization inhibitor<br>
directly to the column without using the cooler annexed to<br>
the tank. As a result, the concentration of the acrylic acid<br>
oligomer (acrylic acid dimer and trimer) in the waste oil<br>
from the thermal decomposition tank increased to 43 wt. %<br>
and the amount of the waste oil was increased to 200 kg/h.<br>
When the plant was stopped after about three months ' continued<br>
operation to test the interior thereof, no sign of trouble<br>
was detected.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
An operation was performed by following the procedure<br>
of Example 1 with the exception of the following modifications .<br>
First, hydroquinone as one of the components of the<br>
polymerization inhibitor supplied to the azeotropic<br><br>
dehydration column was dissolved in water and supplied<br>
together with the aqueous acrylic acid solution to the step<br>
for supply of the aqueous solution. The bottom liquid of the<br>
heavy-ends cut column was directly supplied to the thin film<br>
evaporator and the acrylic acid recovered from the evaporator<br>
was circulated to the heavy-ends cut column. Further, this<br>
process was directly shifted to the subsequent process without<br>
using the cooler annexed to the tank.<br>
The maleic acid concentration in the acrylic acid<br>
recovered from the thin film evaporator was about 6 wt. %.<br>
Thus, the water content and the concentration of such high<br>
boiling substances as maleic acid in the acrylic acid were<br>
higher than those obtained in Example 1. The amount of the<br>
waste oil was 210 kg/h and the oligomer concentration in the<br>
waste oil was 43 wt. %. The azeotropic dehydration column<br>
began to show a discernible sign of rise of pressure on the<br>
day following the start of the operation. Though the operation<br>
could be continued for about one month, it had to be stopped<br>
owing to the rise of the pressure during the refining process .<br>
When the plant was opened to test the interior thereof, the<br>
azeotropic dehydration column was found to have a discernible<br>
sign of precipitation of the polymer and the polymer inhibitor.<br>
In the neighborhood of the heavy-euus cut column and the thin<br>
film evaporator, precipitation of fumaric acid inferred to<br>
be formed by the transfer of heat of the maleic acid and the<br>
polymer were confirmed.<br>
The concentration of the acrylic acid oligomer (acrylic<br>
acid dimer and trimer) in the bottom of the azeotropic<br>
dehydration column was 6 wt. %.<br>
Example 5<br>
An operation was performed by following the procedure<br>
of Comparative Example 1 while introducing hydroquinone as<br><br>
the polymerization inhibitor to the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column at a stage between the stage for supply of the raw<br>
material and the stage for supply of the reflux. The plant<br>
was opened to test the interior thereof after one month's<br>
continued operation. Though the amount of the polymer<br>
suffered to occur in the azeotropic dehydration column was<br>
small as compared with Comparative Example 1, the<br>
precipitation of the polymerization inhibitor was found be<br>
occurred in the proximity of the site for injection of the<br>
polymerization inhibitor and blockage also was found in the<br>
holes in the trays. The neighborhood of the heavy-ends cut<br>
column and the thin film evaporator was not notably different<br>
from that in comparative Example 1.<br>
Example 6<br>
An operation was performed by following the procedure<br>
of Comparative Example 1 while circulating the acrylic acid<br>
recovered from the thin film evaporator to the azeotropic<br>
dehydration column. When the plant was opened to test the<br>
interior thereof after one month's continued operation, the<br>
results of test were not notably different from those of<br>
Comparative Example 1. The water content of the produced<br>
acrylic acid, however, was decreased.<br>
Example 7<br>
An operation was performed by following the procedure<br>
of Comparative Example 1 while introducing hydroquinone as<br>
the polymerization inhibitor to the azeotropic dehydration<br>
column by spraying together with part of the acrylic acid<br>
obtained through the top of the heavy-ends cut column at the<br>
stage intervening between the stage for supply of raw material<br>
and the stage for supply of the reflux. The plant was opened<br>
one month's continued operation to test the interior thereof.<br>
Though the azeotropic dehydration column showed no sign of<br><br>
any particular problem, the results of test in the neighborhood<br>
of the heavy-ends cut column and the thin film evaporator<br>
were not notably different from those of Comparative Example<br>
