				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the HIV Western Blot Assay rotary shaker which confirms the detection of antibodies to HIV-I and II in human serum or plasma.<br>
More specifically, it is especially designed to run HIV Western Blot Test so that the running of the test becomes accurate, consistent, easier, specific and efficient.<br>
Prior Art:<br>
The conventional rotary shaker used for the detection of antibodies to HIV -1/2 in human serum or plasma, was not accurate, consistent, specific in giving results, less efficient and not easy to handle.<br>
The conventional rotary shaker is heavy in weight say 12-15 kg and the speed of the shaker is not maintained at a fixed r.p.m due to fluctuation which causes inaccuracy in the end-results.<br>
Besides this the conventional rotary shaker has no flexibility of time.<br>
It is thus the object of the subject invention is to have a rotary shaker which avoids the disadvantages of the known state of the art.<br>
It is an object of the invention that the speed for the rotary shaker is maintained at a desired r.p.m. to render desired results.<br>
It is another object of the invention that the rotary shaker should be light in weight.<br><br>
It is an embodiment of the invention that it is provided with a digital timer, covering all the timing steps of the tests except the one which requires sample incubation.<br>
Summary of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to the HIV Western Blot Shaker specially designed to run HIV Western Blot Test by overcoming the drawbacks aforementioned.<br>
The rotary shaker has a platform which is designed so that four tests can be performed at a time. Besides this it is provided with a fixed angular speed. This speed of the rotary shaker is optimised for giving the accurate, specific, consistent, efficient results. Further once the speed of the rotary shaker is setup cannot be altered during the operation.<br>
The digital timer of the rotary shaker is from 0 to 60 minutes or untimed for unlimited duration. The said timer covers all the timing steps of the test except the one which requires sample incubation. The sample incubation is either for 4 hrs in case of the HIV Western Blot rapid assay or overnight in case of the HIV-Western Blot overnight assay. In case of the overnight assay, an unlimited duration mode can be used. In an unlimited duration mode, the digits keep on blinking as long as the operation is going on.<br>
Accordingly the present invention relates to a rotary shaker for testing HIV western Blot test for carrying out four tests simultaneously comprising a rectangular platform placed on a rigid flat level table or bench, placed in a clean room, means for providing the fixed angular speed, means for controlling the time duration for incubation of the sample under test, means for providing the power supply to the shaker and an indicator provided in the shaker for indicating the position of the said power supply.<br><br>
Further the present invention relates a rotary shaker wherein the said means for providing to the said shaker the fixed angular speed of 60 rpm is a tamper proof rotary disc controller by the timer.<br>
The present invention also relates a rotary shaker wherein the said means for controlling time duration is a digital timer covering all the timing steps of the test except the requiring sample incubation.<br>
Further the present invention relates a rotary shaker wherein the said incubation period charges for 4 hrs. or even overnight 16 to 20 hrs. in the unlimited duration mode.<br>
Further the present invention also relates a rotary shaker wherein the said digital timer is maintain from 0 to 60 minutes or even untimed in the event of unlimited duration.<br>
Further the present invention relates a rotary shaker wherein the said means for power supply is a power service ensuring the proper earthing and 2 amp fuse in circuit.<br>
Further the present invention also relates a rotary shaker wherein the said timers blinking indicates 00, indicating that the shaker can be started, passing the said timer.<br>
The subject invention may better be understood with reference to accompanying drawings. However, the same should not be construed to restrict the scope of application as they are for illustrative purposes only.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS:<br>
Fig. 1     HIV Western Blot Rotary Shaker. Fig. 2    Inside View of the Rotary Shaker.<br><br>
BREIF  DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention relates to the Western Blot rotary shaker as shown in figure-1 designed to run the HIV Western Blot test, so that the running of the HIV Western Blot test becomes accurate, specific, efficient, and easy.<br>
The rotary shaker has been provided with a rectangular platform(1) as shown in figure-1 to run the four tests simultaneously and efficiently. The rotary shaker has a unit height of 100-105 mm. The Western Blot shaker has a fixed angular speed of 60 rpm which has been optimised for giving the best results of HIV Western Blot. The speed is tamper proof. The digital timer(2) as shown in figure-1 of the rotary shaker is maintained from 0 to 60 min. or untimed for unlimited duration. This digital timer(2) covers all the timing steps of the test except the one which requires sample incubation. The sample incubation step is either for 4 hrs. or for overnight procedure (16 to 20 hrs) wherein unlimited duration mode can be used. In this mode, the digits of the digital timer(2) keep on blinking as long as the operation is going on.<br>
The rotary shaker is unpacked from the carton by pulling the base portion of the unit. Care should be taken not to pull the platform by force, as it is delicately positioned on the base.<br>
For installation, the HIV Western Blot rotary shaker is placed on rigid flat level table or bench. This table or bench free from vibration is placed in a clean room where test is to be conducted. Sufficient clear area must be available around the shaker to allow uninterrupted rotation of the platform(1). The precautions are to be taken while handling the rotary shaker. The unit is not supposed to be picked by the platform(1). This action could cause the platform(1) to shift from the support tracks. After installation, the shaker is plugged to the mains to confirm proper operation and to see that the platform pathway is unobstructed.<br><br>
The tests and procedural set-up is done by connecting the three-pin power plug to a suitable three-pin 230 VAC power socket having proper earthing and 2 amp fuse in circuit. The earthing of the shaker is the most important as it will reduce the leakage of the current and also some local heating. When the shaker is connected to the powers supply, an indicator blinks indicating that power is available for the unit. The smooth functioning of the shaker is ensured by operating the unit initially without placing anything on the platform(1). The shaker can be started if properly connected. The mains switch is put on to start the shaker. The timer(2) starts blinking indicating "00". In this mode the shaker can be started. It can be used by passing the timer that is "ON" without timer. The shaker to be used in "timer mode", the "set time" switch(3) is pressed. The switch(3) is pressed continuously until the desired time is attained. The shaker is ready to operate in "time mode".<br>
The precautions have to be taken for proper functioning of the rotary shaker. The cleaning of external parts of the rotary shaker is done by wiping with a soft cloth dampened with a mild soap water solution. It is further dried with a soft absorbent cloth. The platform(1) has to be immediately dried after any spills. The internal components of the rotary shaker are permanently lubricated. The rotating tracks under the platform(1) should be lubricated with a light machine oil.<br>
The subject invention as described herein should not be construed to restrict the broad scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br>
