				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to polymeric assisted delivery of benefit agents. More particularly, the polymer particles exhibit affinities for selected benefit agents, such as perfume, to form polymeric assisted benefit agent delivery systems, which can effectively deposit benefit agents onto the surface of a substrate, e.g., fabrics being laundered, hard surfaces, hair, skin or nails. The present invention also relates to compositions containing the polymeric assisted benefit agent delivery systems and methods of making the same, preferably by separate addition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is frequently desirable or advantageous to treat the surfaces of a variety of substrates, such as fabrics, skin, and hair, with benefit agents; exemplary benefit agents include perfumes; flavors; pharmaceuticals or bio-control agents, such as biocides, insecticides, and mildew control agents; and the like.<br>
Products, systems and methods for depositing benefit agents onto the surfaces of substrates are well known in the art. For example, in the context of fabric treatment, including fabric laundering, a variety of laundry and other products exist that can be used to form aqueous washing liquors or rinse baths containing benefit agents; upon contact with the liquors or baths, the benefit agents are deposited onto the fabric. Personal care products also exist that deliver, in a similar manner, benefit agents to substrates, such as skin and hair. These laundry, personal care, and other products can be applied directly to the surface of the substrate as leave-on products or wash-off products. Li either product format, the objective of using these products in substrate treatments is to deposit sufficient benefit agents on the substrate surface so that the substrate surface exhibits a residual or longer lasting benefit after treatment of the substrate is completed.<br>
In addition, in many consumer products, it is desirable for certain benefit agents, such as perfume raw materials, to be deposited more effectively on the surface and/or released in a controlled manner over time. Since the most volatile perfume raw materials, referred to as "top notes" are responsible for the "fresh feeling" consumers experience, it is especially desirable for the more volatile top notes to be deposited more effectively and/or released in a controlled manner over an extended period of time.<br>
Since top notes are conventionally lost due to dissolution and/or evaporation hi aqueous media, formulators have tried to rninimize the loss of top notes by exploring technologies that enhance the deposition of top notes on substrates, even when the substrate is immersed in or treated with copious amount of water and/or when the substrate subsequently is exposed to<br>
atmospheric moisture. Even when directly deposited on substrates, there still remains a need to release the perfume raw materials in an extended, controlled manner.<br>
Prior art attempts disclose the use of pre-loaded perfume polymeric particles to aid the deposition of perfume raw materials onto surfaces and/or control the release of perfume from surfaces. Such attempts include matrix systems in which the fragrance is dissolved or dispersed into the polymer matrix, as well as reservoir system in which the fragrance is surrounded by a rate controlling membrane. Other attempts have included polymerizing the perfume raw materials into a polymer particle or absorbing perfume into polymer particles. These systems are "pre-loaded perfume polymeric particles". Details of these attempts are described in US 6,149,375; WO 98/2839; WO 00/68352; WO 01/79303 and EP 925,776.<br>
Formulators have been less than successful in efficiently depositing perfume raw materials, especially top notes, onto substrates using pre-loaded perfume polymeric particles. Without being bound by theory, the lack of efficiency can be due to reduction or loss of the interaction between the benefit agent and the delivery system during in-product storage. For example, the interaction between perfume and polymer particle can be lost via uncontrolled diffusion of perfume raw material from the pre-loaded perfume polymeric particles into the product matrix or atmosphere. Such loss is quite common under the strorage conditions consumer products typically experience.<br>
Attempts to stabilize the pre-loaded perfume polymeric particles to in-product diffusion have resulted in limited success. Attempts to increase stability can be accompanied by undesirable changes in the rate of release of the benefit agent from the delivery system.<br>
Notwithstanding the advances in the art, there remains a continuing need for better benefit agent delivery systems, especially those delivery systems that are effective for delivering residual and long-lasting benefit agents to substrates treated with such delivery systems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the present invention relates to a benefit agent delivery system suitable for delivering a benefit agent to a substrate, the benefit agent delivery system comprising a polymer particle and a benefit agent, wherein the polymer particle and the benefit agent are separately added to a matrix to form the benefit agent delivery system; and when the benefit agent delivery system is deposited onto the substrate, directly or indirectly, the Response Factor (RF) exhibited by the benefit agent delivery system is at least about 1.5.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention relates to method for making a granular or liquid composition containing a benefit agent delivery system comprising the steps of:<br>
providing a granular or liquid matrix;<br>
adding a polymer particle to the matrix; and<br>
adding a benefit agent to the matrix;<br>
wherein the polymer particle and benefit agent are added as separate, discrete components from different sources to form the benefit delivery system.<br>
The present invention also relates to the composition comprising the polymeric assisted benefit agent delivery systems.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As used herein, "separate addition" means that the perfume and the preformed polymer particles are separately added to and mixed in a matrix or medium containing adjunct ingredients to form the perfume polymeric particles in the final product/composition. In other words, the perfume and the polymer particles are not pre-mixed hi a carrier solvent to form the perfume polymeric particles prior to being added to the a matrix or medium containing adjunct ingredients to form the final product.<br>
As used herein, "different sources" means different containers, different conduits, different compartments of a container or a conduit, and the like, so long as the polymer particles and benefit agents do not come into contact with one another prior to being added to the matrix.<br>
As used herein, "non-polvmerically associated" means that the benefit agent is absorbed hi, adsorbed on or otherwise associated with the polymer after the polymer has been formed. In other words, the benefit agent is not present with the polymer during polymerization or melting of the polymer, rather, the benefit agent is mixed with preformed polymer particles to produce a benefit agent delivery system. For purposes of the present invention, this definition excludes encapsulation wherein a polymer encapsulates a perfume.<br>
"Benefit agent delivery system" or "delivery system" comprises a benefit agent and a polymer particle, which are combined in such a manner as to (i) enhance or increase the deposition of benefit agent onto a substrate and/or (ii) increase or prolong the release of benefit agent from a substrate after said substrate has been exposed to said benefit agent delivery system. Benefit agent delivery systems can be incorporated into a product composition, which may comprise optional adjunct ingredients. Such product composition include, but are not limited to, personal care/cleansing products, fabric care/cleaning products, hard surface care/cleaning products.<br>
As used herein, "adjunct ingredients" means those formulation ingredients that are used in the end product compositions. Such adjunct ingredients are not intended to be those ingredients<br>
used in the process of producing the polymer particles that form the basis of the benefit agent delivery system of the present invention, such as processing aids and/or stabilizing agents.<br>
As used herein, "directly applied", "direct applications" or "delivering directly" means that a benefit agent is applied to a substrate via a composition containing the benefit agent delivery system such that the benefit provided by the benefit agent is realized and/or recognized prior to or without subsequent dilution. That is, the benefit agent delivery system can be formulated into a composition that is used as a leave-on product, which is applied to the substrate without dilution or rinse off. For example, the benefit agent delivery system or the product composition containing it is sprayed onto a substrate and/or wiped on to a substrate, rather than having the benefit agent delivery system or the product composition containing it contact or deposit indirectly onto a substrate from a dilute solution (i.e., wash liquor). Nonlimiting examples include fine fragrance perfume applications or products; home care perfume products, such as freshening compositions that are typically applied to upholstery, carpets and other fabric articles; hard surface treating products; beauty care products, such as creams, lotions, deodorants, antiperspirants, and other topical compositions; hair care products, such as hair spray, leave-in conditioners, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "indirectly applied", 'Indirect applications" or "applied indirectly" means that the substrate is contacted with a dilute solution of the benefit agent delivery system or a product composition containing it, such as in an aqueous solution or dispersion of such a delivery system or product composition. For purposes of this invention, a "dilute solution" of the delivery system or product composition is a solution that contains a concentration of the benefit agent that is at least about 10%, preferably at least about 30%, more preferably at least about 50% lower than the concentration of the benefit agent hi the delivery system or product composition prior to such dilution. Such dilute solutions or dispersions can, of course, be formed by diluting the delivery system or the product composition containing it, with water. For example, a laundry detergent containing a perfume delivery system is diluted with water and the dilute solution is used as the wash liquor or bath for laundering fabric articles.<br>
Indirect application also includes the situation where a substrate is initially contacted with the concentrated delivery system-containing product and subsequently diluted/rinsed. For example, even though a shampoo or body wash product may initially be contacted with and applied directly to hair or skin, such products are quickly diluted by the addition of water and used thereafter as an indirect application of the benefit agent delivery system. It is understood that for the indirect application, there must be sufficient contact between the substrate and the delivery system to deposit at least some measurable amount of the benefit agent onto the surface before<br>
dilution or rinse takes place. Such contact time can range from about 5 seconds to about 30 minutes, preferably from about 15 seconds to about 15 minutes, and more preferably from about 30 seconds to about 5 minutes.<br>
For purposes of this invention, an aqueous solution or dispersion of a delivery system or product composition may contain no more than about 5000 ppm, preferably no more than about 500 ppm, more preferably no more than about 50 ppm, and most preferably no more than about 10 ppm. In some embodiments, a dilute solution of the delivery system or product composition may even contain no more than about 1 ppm, of the benefit agent. Benefit Agent Delivery System<br>
The present invention provides a benefit agent delivery system suitable for delivering a benefit agent to a substrate, wherein the benefit agent delivery system comprises a benefit agent and a polymer particle such that when the polymer particle and the benefit agent are directly or indirectly applied to a substrate, the benefit agent provides a benefit to the substrate that is more intense and/or for a longer period of time than when the benefit agent is delivered to the substrate without the polymer particle being present.<br>
The enhancement provided by the present benefit agent delivery system may be shown in the amount of benefit agent deposited onto the substrate surface or in the amount of benefit agent released from the substrate surface. The enhancement may also be shown hi the type of benefit agent that is difficult or impossible to be delivered to the substrate by other delivery methods or delivery vehicles, specifically the type of benefit agents that tend to have higher affinity for the product matrix than for the substrate surface, and/or the type of benefit agent that is easily washed away from the substrate surface during the rinse process.<br>
Further, enhancement is shown when the benefit agent delivery system is applied, directly or indirectly, to a substrate, the benefit agent provides a benefit to the substrate for a longer period of time than when the benefit agent is delivered to the substrate without the polymer particle being present.<br>
Contrary to the general notion that the polymer particles and the benefit agents should be pre-mixed (i.e., when both are present in high concentrations in a carrier solvent) before the pre-mix is added to the product matrix or medium, it is surprising to discover that when the polymer particle and the benefit agent are separately added as discrete components to the product matrix (e.g., a granular or liquid matrix) they are also effective in forming a benefit agent delivery system, which imparts enhanced and/or prolonged benefit to the surface of a substrate. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that the polymer particle and the benefit agent can be selected/paired for their selectivity or affinity for each other such that the polymer particle and the<br>
benefit agent can become associated even when they are diluted by the product matrix and in the presence of adjunct ingredients.<br>
Moreover, because of the selectivity or affinity between the benefit agent and the polymer particle, they can be separately added to a diluted, and preferably an aqueous, solution or dispersion of the product composition and still able to form the benefit agent delivery system that delivers the enhanced and/or prolonged benefit to a substrate surface. Additionally, the benefit agent and polymer particle can be applied onto the substrate surface in separate, undiluted solution or dispersion and still able to form the benefit agent delivery system that delivers the enhanced and/or prolonged benefit to a substrate surface.<br>
It is also discovered that regardless of the sequence in which the polymer particles and the benefit agents are added to the matrix, the resulting benefit agent delivery system, made by the separate addition mode (i.e., not by the pre-mix mode), would impart enhanced benefit to the substrate surface.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer particle is introduced into the product matrix, or composition via a source that is different from the source that introduces the benefit agent. In another embodiment, the polymer particle is introduced into the product matrix before, after or simultaneously with the benefit agent. In yet another embodiment, the polymer particle and the benefit agent are separate, discrete components at least one point in time after the product or composition has been produced and become associated with one another prior to, during or as result of being applied, directly or indirectly, to a substrate.<br>
In a specific embodiment of the present invention, the benefit agent is a perfume raw material, preferably a perfume raw material having a Kovats Index (KI) less than about 1700, and more preferably a perfume raw material having a Kovats index from about 1000 to about 1400. The "Kovats Index" is a term known hi the perfume industry. All KIs disclosed herein are determined using polydimethylsiloxane as the non-polar stationary phase in the column (referred to as a "DB-5 column").<br>
hi liquid matrices, especially, on a weight basis, the ratio of polymer particle to benefit agent can vary widely, and will frequently range from about 1000:1 to about 1:50. Li one embodiment, the ratio of polymer particle to benefit agent is from about 1000:1 to about 1:5, more typically from about 100:1 to about 1:2, even more typically from about 50:1 to about 1:1.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the polymer particle is present in the final composition at a level of about 0.002 to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.05 to about 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the benefit agent is present in the final composition at a level of from about 0.001 to about 10%, preferably from about 0.01 to about 5% by weight of the composition. Liquid or Granular Matrix<br>
The benefit agent delivery systems can be incorporated into a liquid matrix to form the end product. The term "liquids", as used herein, includes fluids as well as gels and foams. The liquid matrix may be aqueous or non-aqueous, wherein water is typically the major component of the aqueous matrix and conventional organic solvents (e.g., lower alcohols) may be used to form the matrix for the non-aqueous matrix. Liquid products, i.e., those containing about 10% or greater of water or other solvents, are typical for the present invention.<br>
The benefit agent delivery systems can be incorporated into a granular matrix. The term "granular matrix", as used herein include which any type of solid material, including porous and non-porous particles, powders or sponges that can be fashioned into agglomerates, tablets, sheets, and the like. In some embodiments, the granular matrix comprises particles or granules ranging in size from about 1 [un to about 100 mm. The granular matrix may further comprise either inert or active ingredients, or both.<br>
The liquid or granular matrix used to form the delivery systems herein can comprise one or more adjunct ingredient, such as surfactant, polymer additive, deposition polymer, thickener, etc., either in the presence or absence of water. In the case where there is no water, the adjunct ingredient can serve as the matrix.<br>
The polymer particles and benefit agents can be separately added to the liquid or granular matrix to form an end product containing the delivery system of this invention. Examples for the end product include, but are not limited to, liquid or granular detergent composition for laundry or hard surface cleaning; personal care composition for hair or skin cleaning or maintenance. Separate Addition of Polymer Particle and Benefit Agent<br>
As discussed above, it is advantageous to have the polymer particle and the benefit agent added separately to the liquid or granular matrix. Thus, the polymer particle and the benefit agent may be added to the matrix at separate times, or from separate containers and/or conduits, or from separate holding or delivery means.<br>
In another embodiment of the separate addition method, the polymer panicle and the benefit agent may be separately prepared or mixed with carrier fluids or portions of the matrix, then the pre-dispersions or mixtures are combked to form the benefit agent delivery system in the<br>
end product. For example, the polymer particle or the benefit agent can be separately added to the matrix in the form of a concentrate or an aqueous dispersion, wherein each concentrate or dispersion comprises at least about 50 wt% of the polymer particle or the benefit agent.<br>
In still another embodiment of the separate addition method, the polymer particle and the benefit agent may even be mixed together prior to combination with the matrix so long as substantially no chemical interaction occurs between these materials prior to their contact with the matrix.<br>
In a further embodiment of the separate addition method, the polymer particle is added to a fully formulated, perfume-containing product.<br>
Additional adjunct ingredients can be added to the matrix at any time. Thff adjunct ingredient can also serve as the matrix into which the polymer particle and benefit agent are incorporated.<br>
Encapsulation, referring to the structure where a polymer physically surrounds a benefit agent, is excluded from the benefit agent delivery system of the present invention. An example of encapsulation is the physical relationship exhibited by cyclodextrin and perfume. However, the polymer particle of the invention may encapsulate material that is not among the benefit agents disclsoed herein. Furthermore, polymer may be heated to its melting point and a perfume is added to the melt before cooling. These structures are outside the scope of the benefit agent delivery system of the present invention. Polymer Particle<br>
The polymer particle of the present invention is polymerized from at least one cationic monomer and one or more non-cationic monomers, preferably also a cross-Unking monomer. The polymerization process may be any suitable process known in the art, such as emulsion, suspension or mini-emulsion polymerization. During the polymerization, an emulsifier or stabilizer may be present to keep the polymer particles from coagulating, crashing and/or settling out of the aqueous solution in which the polymer particles are being formed.<br>
The monomers of the polymer particle may be selected such that the resulting polymer particle has an affinity for perfume raw materials having a molecular weight of less than about 200, a boiling point of less than about 250°C, a ClogP of less than about 3, or a Kovats Index value of less than about 1700, preferably from about 1000 to about 1400.<br>
The polymer particle can be derived from about 50% to about 100%, preferably from about 60 to about 95% by weight of non-cationic monomers; from about 0% to about 50%, preferably from about 0% to about 10% by weight of cationic or anionic monomers; and from about 0% to about 25%, preferably from about 1% to about 10% by weight of cross-Unking<br>
monomers. The monomers polymerized to form the polymer particle may be used in a weight ratio of non-cationic monomercationic monomer:cross-linldng monomer of from about 10:0.02:0 to about 5:2.5:1.<br>
The polymer particles may be in the form of micro-particles or nanoparticles having an average particle size of from about lOOnm to about SOum, as measured by light scattering using Brookhaven Particle size analyzer or Hbriba particle size analyzer. In one embodiment, the polymer particle may have an average particle size of from about lum. to about 39fim, preferably from about 3|-un to about 20ujn and more preferably from about 5(nm to about 12um. In another embodiment, the polymer particle may have an average particle size of from about lOOnm to about Ipm, preferably from about 200nm to about 900nm and more preferably from about 700 nm to about 900nm.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer particles have a glass transition temperature, Tg, from about 50 °C to about 150 °C, preferably from about 80 °C to about 120 °C.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer particle may comprise a single polymer after polymerization of the monomers. In another embodiment, the polymer particle may comprise two or more polymers, which are produced by the reaction (e.g., grafting) between the emulsifier or stabilizer and the polymerizing monomers or resulting polymer particle. For example, the polymer particle may comprise a first polymer resulting from the polymerization of the monomers, and a second polymer grafted or associated with the first polymer, such as polystyrene and poly(methyl methacrylate - dimethyl amino ethyl methacrylate) copolymer.<br>
It is desirable that the polymer particle is stable hi aqueous dispersions. It is also desk-able that the polymer particle is stable within product formulations, such as perfume compositions or fabric softener compositions that contain laundry adjuncts, fabric softeners, and the like.<br>
Stability of the polymer particle can be influenced by factors such as the average particle size of the resulting polymer particle, the net charge of the resulting polymer particle, the interactions or compatibility between the polymer particles and other ingredients in the compositions, such as emulsifiers or stabilizers.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer particle has a net cationic charge about 20 mV to about 80 mV, preferably from about 30 mV to about 50 mV and more preferably from about 35 mV to about 45 mV, as measured by a Brookhaven zeta potential analyzer.<br>
To aid in the stabilizing the polymer particle hi aqueous dispersions and/or in product formulations, such as perfume compositions, a stabilizer, also known as a colloidal stabilizer may be added to the aqueous dispersion and/or product formulation. It is desirable that the colloidal<br>
stabilizer be compatible with other ingredients within the aqueous dispersion and/or product formulation.<br>
The polymer particle may be water-insoluble. In other words, when added to water, the polymer particle physically separates from the water (i.e. settles-out, flocculates, floats) within 5 minutes after addition, whereas a material that is "soluble in water " does not physically separate from the water within 5 minutes after addition. Another way of describing water-insoluble materials for purposes of the present invention is the fact that water-insoluble materials are not soluble in distilled (or equivalent) water, at 25°C, at a concentration of greater than about 5%, preferably greater than about 3% and more preferably greater than about 1% by weight of the mixture containing water and polymer particles.<br>
The polymer particle may have a weight-average molecular weight of from about 1,000 to about 2,000,000 preferably from about 5,000 to about 1,000,000, more preferably from about 10,000 to about 750,000, more preferably from about 20,000 to about 500,000 daltons. The weight-average molecular weight of the polymer particle, can be determined via conventional methods such as gel permeation chromatography.<br>
A.	Non-Cationic Monomer<br>
The non-cationic monomer may be a hydrophobic group-containing monomer. Examples of the hydrophobic group include, but are not limited to, alkyls, cycloalkyls, aryls, alkaryls, aralkyls and mixtures thereof.<br>
The non-cationic monomer may be a hydroxyl-containing monomer, an anionic group-<br>
containing monomer, or a zwitterionic monomer. The non-cationic monomer include, but are not<br>
limited to, ethylene glycol phenyl ether acrylate (EGPhA.), trans-cinnamic acid, 2-ethyl hexyl<br>

Protocol 1 - The Delivery or Longevity Test (Indirect Application)<br>
The following Protocols are provided for determining if a benefit agent delivery system increases the level of benefit agent deposited and/or prolong or increase its subsequently release from a substrate. A benefit agent delivery system falls outside the scope of the present invention when it fails all of the following test protocols. For the purpose of illustration, perfume raw materials are used as the benefit agents and the benefit agent delivery system is a perfume delivery system (e.g., a perfume polymeric particle) hi the following Protocols. More details of the Test Protocols using perfume or perfume raw materials are described hi the co-filed patent<br>
application entitled "Perfume Polymeric Particles" in the name of Jordan et al. (P&amp;G Case 9083M&amp;).<br>
Protocol IA (Perfume Accord Delivery or Longevity Test); The perfume delivery system of the present invention include polymer particles that enhance/increase the level of perfume raw materials (PRMs) deposited onto and/or subsequently released from a substrate; the polymer particles may be selected to have an affinity for perfume raw materials having a Kovats Index value of less than about 1700, preferably from about 1000 to about 1400. Multiple PRMs, available in the form of commercial perfume accord, may be tested together in the presence of a single or multiple polymer particles, as long as the analytical measurements (such as chromatography) are not affected by such combination. Typically, when the concentration of the PRMs are within a factor of about 10, the measurements do not appear to be affected by the presence of other PRMs in the same test. A fabric article in an aqueous medium is used as the substrate for purposes of this test protocol, a) Concentration of PRM(s) and PPfsl hi the Test Solution<br>
The concentrations of PRMs and PP to be used in the Longevity Test (LT) are the lowest concentrations, in a series of solutions prepared from an initial test solution (TSo), at which each PRM in the test solution is detected in the headspace sample collected from the treated substrate at one or more of the designated time points. If this condition is not met by TS0, the concentrations of PRMs and PP in the test solution are doubled and the new solution (TSO is tested hi the same manner. The process is repeated until the above PRM detection condition is met. The concentrations of PRMs and PP in the test solution (TSn) that meets the above PRM detection condition relate to the concentrations of the PRMs and PP in TSo according to the following equation:<br>
[PRM, PP] in TSn = 2n [PRM, PP] hi TS0; where n = 0,1,2, 3...<br>
In some instances, the process of doubling the concentration is repeated until the concentration of the PRMs and of PP both exceed 5% by weight of the test solution and the above PRM detection condition is still not met. Then, the following alternatives may be used in conducting the test. The aliquot of TSn transferred onto the substrate is increased from 1.0 mL to 3 mL, then to 10 mL, or the substrate size is increased to 1.0 g, 3.g, then to 10 g, until (i) the above PRM detection condition is met, or (ii) with respect to individual PRM that has a concentration greater than 0.1 wt% of the perfume, at least one of the following two alternative conditions is met:<br>
at least 80 % of the low KI PRMs in the test solution and at least 80 % of high KI<br>
PRMs in the test solution are detected in the headspace sample collected from the treated<br>
substrate at one or more of the designated time points; or<br>
at least 10 of the low KI PRMs in the test solution and at least 5 of the high KI PRMs<br>
in the test solution are detected hi the headspace sample collected from the treated<br>
substrate at one or more of the designated time points.<br>
b)	The Test Procedure<br>
The test solution is prepared by dissolving or mixing PRM(s) and PP(s) are separately added into a composition at concentrations equal to those used in a consumer product, such as a laundry detergent. For example, the respective concentration of PRM(s) and PP(s) in a consumer product may be 2.0% and 4.0% by weight of the product. The mixture is thoroughly mixed so that it is visually uniform. The, the mixture is closed to the atmosphere and aged for 24 hours at room temperature to obtain the initial test solution, designated TS0.<br>
A 4 cm diameter fabric circle, weighing 0.45 to 0.65 g, is cut from an 86/14 cotton/poly terry wash cloth (obtained from EMC, 7616 Reinfold Drive, Cincinnati, OH 45237) and used as the test substrate. The weights of substrates in a given test should be within ± 0.02 g of one another. A 1.0 mL aliquot of TSo is transferred by a pipette onto the substrate, with the pipette pointing close to the center of the substrate. Then, a 1.0 mL aliquot of deionized (DI) water is added to the substrate in the same manner. The substrate is lathered by rubbing against the palm of a nitrile-gloved hand for 1 minute. The substrate is then placed in a bottle containing 40 mL of 35'C DI water; the bottle is capped and shaken for 30 seconds. The substrate is then removed using forceps and gently blotted on paper towels to remove excess water. The substrate, treated by the above steps (including charging with test solution, diluting, lathering/washing and rinsing) is left open to the atmosphere under ambient conditions to air dry for the specified period of time. Subsequently, the substrate is analyzed via headspace gas chromatography (HSGC) to determine the amount of each perfume raw material in the headspace at each of the following times: 2,6 and 24 hours.<br>
c)	jfeadspace Gas Chromatography CHSGO<br>
A suitable equipment is described by S. Maeno and P.A. Rodriguez hi J.Chromatography, vol. A731 (1996) pages 201-215. The equipment includes:<br>
a headspace collector to contain the substrate (treated and air dried as described above)<br>
and allow PRM(s) to partition into the headspace and reach equilibrium;<br>
a trap containing a porous polymer, which has the ability to retain aroma materials<br>
(e.g., perfume or perfume raw materials);<br>
a transfer device to transfer the trapped headspace vapors onto a GC for quantitative<br>
analysis; and<br>
GC-MS with headspace detection capabilities, and uses helium as the mobile phase.<br>
A substrate, which has been treated and air dried for a specified time period as described above, is placed in a headspace collector and allowed to partition and reach equilibrium, which takes about two hours. After equilibration, a trap containing a porous polymer having the ability to retain aroma materials, preferably Tenax® TA 35/60 mesh (available from Gerstel, Inc., Baltimore, MD), is operatively connected to the headspace collector to capture the equilibrated headspace vapors. A transfer device is used to transfer the trapped headspace vapors, which contains perfume raw materials, onto a GC for quantitative analysis. This device is able to heat the porous polymer trap containing the collected headspace vapors, and transfer the vapors to a cold trap cooled to lower than about -100°C (generally by liquid nitrogen). Following complete transfer to the cold trap, the cold trap is flash heated hi a short period of time, typically about 1 minute, to a temperature of about 280°C, resulting hi the transfer of the headspace vapors directly onto a capillary GC column.<br>
A typical column is a 30 - 60 meters long with an inner diameter of 0.18 - 0.32 mm, with a stationary phase, which can be, 100% dimethylpolysiloxane (a DB-5 column) or phenylmethylpolysiloxane containing about 5% phenyl. The GC-MS has the capability of identifying and quantifying PRMs of the aldehyde- or ketone-type. Identification is accomplished via Mass Spectrometry and quantification is performed using a separate detector, such as an FID (flame ionization) detector or PID (photo ionization) detector. Specific GCMS conditions are described below.<br>
The perfume components are separated on a DB-5 column (dimethylsiloxane, 60m x 0.32mm, 0.25/im) in split mode to both an MS (for identification) and FID (for quantitation). GC conditions are as following: the sample is held at oven temperature of about 35°C for 2 min, then the GC is programmed to ramp up to 200°C at 4°C/min, followed by a ramp to 325°C at 10°C/min. Inlet pressure is kept constant at 13.7 psi (9.45 N/m2), which is equivalent to an inert gas (e.g., helium) flow of about 2.4mL/min. MS conditions are as following: scan range 35 to 400 amu (atomic units). Transfer line is maintained at about 250°C.<br>
The quantitative measurements should be reproducible to within 20% of the average from the runs. If the result from a given run is not within said range, the data from said run should be discarded and the test repeated. The average of at least 3 satisfactory runs is reported.<br>
d)        Exemplary Results<br>
A suitable test solution TSn meeting the PRM detection condition or alternative coudition(s) described above is prepared. A second test solution TS0 is prepared containing all the components at the same concentrations as in TSn except that the polymer particles have been removed. TSC serves as the control solution in the test. Data are gathered for a given test solution (either TSC or TSn) as described above and analyzed via headspace gas chromatography (HSGC) to determine the amount of each benefit agent in the headspace at each of the following three designated times: 2, 6 and 24 hours.<br>
A longevity benefit is confirmed for a particular PRM/PP delivery system when the quantitative amount of the PRM in the headspace collected from the substrate treated with TSn at any one of the three designated times points is greater than the amount of the same PRM in the headspace collected from the substrate treated with TSC at the corresponding time point.<br>
The Longevity Test results can be reported as the Response Factor (RF), which is the ratio of the amount of benefit agent (e.g., perfume raw material) in the headspace collected from a substrate treated with TSn at a specific time point, compared to the amount of the same benefit agent in the headspace collected from a substrate treated with TSC at the same time point. A benefit agent delivery system falls with in the scope of the present invention when its KF is at least about 1.5, preferably at least about 3, and more preferably at least about 5, and most preferably at least about 10.<br>
The following table demonstrates the type of results that can be obtained from a Longevity Test. The data confirms a greater longevity benefit for PRM1 and PRM2 compared to PRM3 and PRM4 (at t = 24 h, the area count from TSn &gt; TSC). Longevity Test (Time = 24 h):<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Alternatively, a perfume delivery system falls within the scope of the present invention when the Response Factor (RF uo) reported for any perfume raw material having a Kovats Index between about 1000 and 1400 is greater than the Response Factor reported for any perfume raw material having a Kovats Index greater than about 1700 (RF hki)- In other words, a perfume delivery system falls within the scope of the present invention when the ratio RF lki / RF hki is at<br>
least about 1.2, preferably at least about 3, and more preferably at least about 5, and most preferably at least about 10.<br>
Further, a perfume delivery system falls within the scope of the present invention when the Average Response Factor (ARF lh) reported for all measured perfume raw material having a Kovats Index between about 1000 and 1400 is greater than the Average Response Factor (ARF mo) reported for all measured perfume raw materials having a Kovats Index greater than about 1700. Specifically, a perfume delivery system falls within the scope of the present invention when the ratio ARF ua / ARF hki is at least about 1.2, preferably at least about 3, and more preferably at least about 5, and most preferably at least about 10.<br>
Protocol IB (Selected Perfume Raw Material Accord): Each benefit agent deli very system comprising a polymer particle is tested in accordance with Protocol IB, in which an accord, made of selected perfume raw materials, is tested with each polymer particle (PP) to determine if the combination of PRMs and PP(s) demonstrates an enhancement or increase in the level of PRM(s) delivered to or released from a substrate, or a sustained release time, compared to that obtained for the PRM alone. The selected PRM accord is used to prepare test solutions (TSn and TSC) and tested in the manner as described above in Protocol IA.<br>
Since the polymeric particles of the present invention should desirably have enhanced affinity for low KI PRMs (i.e., top notes), it can be expected that a low KI PRM may be non-detectable in TSC and becomes detectable in TSn, which indicates that an enhanced delivery of said PRM to the substrate is achieved when the polymeric particle is present; hi this situation, the Response Factor value for such low KI PRM shall be defined as lOx. However, if a high KI PRM is non-detectable in TSC and becomes detectable hi TSn, result form such high KI PRM shall be excluded from the analysis. If any of the 20 PRMs exhibits an HSGC area count hi TSn (the sample solution) that is less than the HSOC area count in TSC (the control solution), the Response Factor value for such PRM(s) shall be defined as l.Ox.<br>
The perfume delivery system falls within the scope of the present invention when the Average Response Factor (ARF) reported for the following 10 Low Kovats Index PRM standards is greater than the Average Response Factor (ARF) reported for the following 10 High Kovats Index PRM standards. Specifically, the ratio of ARFua / ARFraa is at least about 1.2, preferably at least about 2, and more preferably at least about 4. Moreover, this ratio also demonstrates a selectivity or affinity of the polymeric particles for low KI PRMs than high KI PRMs.<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
Protocol II (Direct Applications'); The same procedure is followed as with indirect application, with the modifications (1) the aliquot of TSo is added to the substrate and the substrate does not receive the subsequent dilution with water or rinse; and (2) the tune points at which the test results ate evaluated include a fourth time point at 7 days.<br>
A longevity benefit is confirmed for a particular polymer particle (PP) when the quantitative amount of any PRM hi the headspace from TSn at any one of the four designated time points is greater than the amount of the same PRM in the headspace from TSC at the corresponding tune point.<br>
hi one embodiment where the perfume delivery system is used in a direct application mode (such as hi a leave-on product), the polymer particle hi the perfume delivery system may "flatten" the release profile of the PRMs. That is, the initial blooming of PRMs is<br>
reduced/suppressed and the PRMs are, instead, released from the perfume release system in a controlled, extended manner over tune. The suppression of initial blooming can result in the initial headspace count of a PRM released from a substrate treated with TSn (containing PRM and PP) at a short time point (e.g., from about 30 minutes to about 1 hour) to be lower than the headspace count of a PRM released collected from a substrate treated with TSC (containing PRM without PP) at the corresponding time point. At later time points however, the longevity benefit is observed. Preferably, the polymer particles of the present invention increase the longevity of PRMs having a Kovat Index of less than 1700, and more preferably increase the longevity of PRMs having a low Kovat Index, which is from about 1000 to about 1400, to a greater extent than PRMs have a high Kovat Index, which is greater than about 1700.<br>
The following table demonstrates the type of results that can be obtained from a Longevity Test with Direct Applications. The data confirms a longevity benefit for PRM1 (at t = 6 hours, the area count from TSn &gt; TSC) and PRM2 (at t = 2 and 6 hours, the area count from TSn &gt; TSC) in the presence of polymer particle (PP).<br><br>

ND a Not detected. Protocol HI     Affinity Test<br>
The polymer particles useful in the perfume delivery system of the present invention exhibit greater affinity for a PRM, which has one or more of the following characteristics: a molecular weight of less than about 200; a boiling point of less than about 250°C; a ClogP of less than about 3; or a Kovats Index value of less than about 1700, preferably from about 1000 to about 1400, than its affinity for other PRMs having none of these characteristics. The following Polymer particle Affinity Test Protocol IQ can be used to determine if a polymer particle falls within the scope of the present invention.<br>
The polymer particles are thoroughly mixed (vk stirring, shaking, and the like) in a liquid consumer product containing perfume (e.g., a commercially available liquid fabric softener typically contains perfume). The product and polymer particles are allowed to equilibrate (e.g., for 3-4 days), during which the polymer particles become associated (or "loaded") with one or more<br>
of the PRMs in the perfume. Then, the product and loaded polymer particles are separated via ultra centrifugadon at 40,000 rpm for 16 hours. Subsequent to centrifugation. the contents separate into distinguishable layers, e.g. a lipid layer on top, an aqueous layer in the middle, and a particle layer on the bottom. A sample from each layer is extracted with a suitable organic solvent (e.g. acetone) and analyzed via GC/MS for perfume identification using the instrument conditions given above.<br>
The selectivity or affinity of the polymer particle, as shown in the GC/MS analysis results, is demonstrated when the bottom particle layer is relatively enriched hi PRMs fitting the above criteria of Kovats Index value, molecular weight, boiling point, and/or QogP, compared to the concentrations of the same PRMs in either of the top or middle layer. In other words, the ARF of the low K3 PRMs in the bottom particle layer is at least about 1.2x, preferably at least about 4x, higher than the ARF of the low KI PRMs hi the top or middle layer. Benefit Agent Delivery System And Product Preparation<br>
The benefit agent delivery system comprising the polymer particles and the benefit agents is prepared by the separate addition mode wherein the polymer particle and the benefit agent are separately added to a product matrix (a liquid or a granule) in a manner similar to adding an ingredient to the product matrix in preparing the final product formulation. In the separate addition mode, the formation of the benefit agent delivery system is facilitated by the polymer particle's affinity for the benefit agent it is designed for. Thorough mixing is frequently carried out using high shear agitation. A gentle heating to about 40°C to about 65°C may be used. Essential or adjunct ingredients may be added to the matrix at any time, with respect to the addition of the benefit agent and the polymer particle, to form the complete end product. Cleaning and Fabric Treatment Products<br>
The benefit agent delivery systems of the present invention are preferably incorporated into a wide variety of cleaning products and fabric treatment products. Such products include both laundry and cleaning compositions which are typically used for laundering fabrics and cleaning hard surfaces such as dishware, floors, bathrooms, toilet, kitchen and other surfaces hi need of a prolonged or delayed release of the benefit agent. That is, laundry and cleaning compositions of the present invention include not only detergent compositions that provide fabric cleaning benefits, but also cleaning compositions that provide hard surface cleaning benefit Additionally, compositions containing the delivery systems of the present invention also include fabric treatment or finishing products, such as fabric softeners or fabric enhancers.<br>

be used to provide cleaning benefits to substrates in the form of shampoos or body wash compositions or to provide non-cleaning benefits to the substrates in the form of hair conditioners or skin lotions.<br>
In a specific embodiment, wherein the benefit agents comprise perfumes, the effectiveness of the delivery to treated surfaces of this benefit agent can be quantified by a parameter called the Dry Surface Odor Index. Determination of such a parameter is fully described in PCX Application No. WO 00/02982. Preferably, when the perfume delivery systems are incorporated into cleaning and fabric treatment products, a Dry Surface Odor Index of more than about 5 and preferably at least about 10 is achieved. In other embodiments, the perfume delivery systems will provide a deskable change in the display or character of the perfume on the substrate surface without necessarily providing an increase in the Dry Surface Odor Index.<br>
In general, the benefit agent delivery systems herein can be incorporated into cleaning or fabric treatment products herein such that levels of polymer particle plus benefit agent range from about 0.005% to 20%, more preferably from about 0.05% to 10%, even more preferably from about 0.1% to 5% by weight of the product composition. For cleaning products, the polymer particle plus benefit agent combination will generally be incorporated at concentrations of from about 0.005% to 10%, along with from, about 1% to 50% by weight of the product composition, of a surfactant. For fabric treatment products, the polymer particle/benefit agent combination will generally be incorporated at concentrations of from about 0.05% to 10% by weight of the product composition, along with from about 1% to 50% by weight of the product composition, of a fabric softening or treating agent.<br>

The fabric laundering compositions may include a deposition polymer to facilitate the deposition of the perfume polymeric particles. These deposition polymers may be anionic, cationic, nonionic and/or zwitterionic. When the polymer particles comprise anionic monomers, the deposition polymer for laundering compositions is preferably cationic. Examples<br>
