				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Translation of PCT/EP2005/004083<br>
The invention relates to a device for the analysis or absorption measurement<br>
of a small quantity of a liquid medium, for example, a drop, by means of<br>
light, which is guided through the medium and which then can be detected<br>
or analyzed photometrically, spectrophotometrically, fluorometrically, or<br>
spectrofluorometrically. The device has a receiving point area for depositing<br>
or applying drops of the medium at the top in the position of use, a<br>
horizontally oriented light inlet located underneath the receiving point in the<br>
position of use in its housing, and a first device located behind the light inlet<br>
in the beam path for guiding the light Upwards towards the receiving point.<br>
In many cases, only small quantities of liquid samples are available. This<br>
applies primarily in biochemical, medical, or pharmaceutical analysis. For<br>
systematic surveys with a plurality of similar samples, for example, titration<br>
plates as sample containers are used, which allow efficient, sequential, or<br>
parallel analysis.<br>
For individual measurements for qualitatively very different substances and<br>
especially for absorption measurements, such samples are filled into cells<br>
and then analyzed, in a known way.<br>
For cells with a measurement chamber volume of ten microliters and less <br>
that is, approximately drop sized - due to the small substance quantity, it is<br><br>
difficult to introduce the sample of the liquid medium into the measurement<br>
channel, because suitable cells provide only small access openings and the<br>
measurement channel has a correspondingly small cross section. When<br>
introducing a sample of the medium to be analyzed into the measurement<br>
channel, it must be guaranteed that the channel is completely rilled by the<br>
medium and, for example, that there are no bubbles within the volume of the<br>
liquid medium passed through by the measurement beam, because bubbles<br>
could considerably falsify the measurement results.<br>
Therefore, cells are usually first filled outside of a corresponding<br>
measurement device and the quality of the filling is checked visually. Then<br>
the cell is inserted into the cell holder of a measurement device. Here, the<br>
cell must be positioned in the measurement beam, so that there is no<br>
variation in the absorption level in the cell itself due to the screening effect<br>
of the measurement chamber cross section, because such variation could also<br>
falsify the measurement results. This can occur because the beam cross<br>
section of a spectrophotometer used as the measurement device usually<br>
exceeds the free aperture of the mentioned cell with very small sample<br>
volumes. Even small deviations in the positioning of the cell in comparison<br>
with a reference measurement or through the use of several cells, which are<br>
structurally identical but subject to variation in manufacturing, within one<br>
measurement cycle can lead to deviation in the measurement values. After<br>
the measurement, due to the shape of the cell holder in commercially<br>
available measurement devices it is practically unavoidable to be required to<br>
remove the cells from the holder for emptying and cleaning.<br><br>
From DE 33 44 387 A1 a photometer head for small measurement volumes<br>
is known, in which a pair of light transmitters and light receivers is arranged<br>
in a material block and this material block has a recess, which is covered<br>
with a plate, in the area of facing surfaces of the light transmitter and light<br>
receiver. This plate has a bore, through which an application device can be<br>
guided with a spacing between the facing surfaces of the light transmitter<br>
and light receiver. Therefore, the use of a cell is to be avoided. The drop of<br>
the liquid medium to be analyzed is to be introduced into this spacing and<br>
must be held there despite the force of gravity acting on it. Thus, the<br>
application of a sample drop must be carried out with great care, so that this<br>
drop is held stationary in the spacing, which is open at the bottom, between<br>
the surfaces despite the force of gravity, which incidentally also requires a<br>
corresponding consistency of the medium to be analyzed.<br>
Therefore, there is the objective of creating a device of the above-noted type,<br>
in which a small sample quantity of a liquid medium can be placed in a<br>
simple way at a measurement point and which allows reliable and simple<br>
cleaning after the measurement. Furthermore, a reference measurement<br>
should be possible, without the measurement conditions being able to<br>
change between the reference measurement and the sample measurement,<br>
which would be disadvantageous for the measurement result.<br>
To meet this objective, the device defined above is characterized in that the<br>
device has a reflector that can be attached detachably above the receiving<br>
point; in that, in its position of use, the reflector has a defined spacing from<br>
the receiving point, which is filled or can be filled with the medium at least<br><br>
in the area of the light passage; and in that a second device is provided for<br>
guiding the light coming from the reflector towards a detector.<br>
Thus, for this device the medium to be analyzed can also be deposited or<br>
applied in drops in very small quantities onto an essentially horizontal<br>
surface, with the light passing through this receiving point at least once. This<br>
can be the case on the way towards the reflector or from the reflector,<br>
wherein, however, advantageously a correspondingly large measurement<br>
distance is given when the light is guided through the sample both on its way<br>
to the reflector and also coming from this reflector.<br>
Because the medium can be deposited on a top receiving point area, it<br>
requires no special care and no special precautions to avoid the negative<br>
effects of the force of gravity. Instead, the force of gravity even helps to hold<br>
the medium in its position, in which the measurement is to be performed. In<br>
this way, complicated filling in a measurement channel can also be avoided.<br>
All that is necessary is to remove the detachable reflector, to deposit the<br>
sample onto the receiving or measurement point, and to bring the reflector<br>
into its position of use, in order to be able to then perform the measurement.<br>
Thus, the device is also suitable for effective execution of individual<br>
measurements on small and very small quantities of the medium to be<br>
analyzed. Furthermore, matching measurement conditions are given for all<br>
of these measurements, so that there are no disadvantageous changes<br>
between the reference measurement and the sample measurement. Here,<br>
applying drops of a sample, for example, by means of a pipette, is an<br>
extremely simple process to perform.<br><br>
Preferably, the receiving point can be accessed from above as a surface and<br>
the medium to be analyzed can be fixed or held at the receiving point by the<br>
force of gravity.<br>
Here, it is preferable when the receiving point has large enough dimensions<br>
that the light passing through this point towards the reflector and reflected<br>
back from this reflector is guided at least once, in particular twice, through<br>
the receiving point and/or through the medium. In the latter case, a<br>
measurement distance is produced that corresponds to twice the distance of<br>
the receiving point from the reflector, which allows effective measurements<br>
and analyses.<br>
A configuration of advantageous significance can be provided in that a light<br>
guide or a light-guiding fiber bundle is arranged for guiding the light from<br>
the first device towards the receiving point and, in particular, a light guide or<br>
a fiber bundle guiding the light is arranged between the receiving point and<br>
the second device for guiding the light coming from the reflector and the<br>
sample. In this way, the receiving point struck by the light or the effective<br>
measurement spot on the receiving point can be kept small, which<br>
simultaneously means the best possible use of the light. This applies even<br>
when the light makes two passes through the sample to be measured, namely<br>
on its way towards the reflector and on its way back from the reflector. With<br>
the help of the mentioned light guide or light-guiding fiber bundle, the light<br>
beams can be concentrated on a very small space.<br>
Here, the targeted guidance of the light can be improved, in that, underneath<br>
the receiving point for the medium, there are optics, at least one convergent<br><br>
lens, which bundle the light and which is optically coupled with the light<br>
guide(s). Such optics can be combined both with the light guide coming<br>
from the first device for guiding the light and also with the light guide<br>
leading to the second device for guiding the light. However, it is also<br>
possible to provide common optics for the two light guides or fiber bundles<br>
located close together at their ends.<br>
An especially advantageous configuration of the invention for limiting the<br>
lateral expansion of the receiving point and thus for further reducing the<br>
necessary quantity of medium to be analyzed can be provided in that the<br>
receiving point is an area recess on the top side of the device underneath the<br>
reflector and, in particular, is formed by the boundary of the optics or lens<br>
facing the receiving point or by the light guide ending at this boundary, with<br>
the lens or the optics and/or the ends of the light guides being set back<br>
relative to the top side of the holder for the lens or the optics or the light<br>
guides. In a preferred embodiment, the receiving point can be limited at the<br>
sides so that it is a recess or is arranged in a recess, which can preferably be<br>
formed so that the optics or lens or the ends of the light guides are arranged<br>
somewhat recessed or set back relative to the topmost boundary or surface of<br>
its holder, so that, in this way, the corresponding recess is formed<br>
automatically.<br>
Here, it is preferred when the lens or optics coupled - at least optically - to<br>
the light guides are formed simultaneously as the closing window of the<br>
device, on which the sample of the medium to be analyzed can be dropped.<br>
Thus, these features and possibilities produce a device, which can be<br>
operated very easily and on which a very small quantity of a medium can be<br><br>
deposited by drops, which produces a very simple operation. Nevertheless,<br>
this sample can also be passed through very effectively by light, which can<br>
be measured or detected easily.<br>
The reflector can be a mirror or a reflecting prism and can contact the<br>
sample without a gap in the position of use. The sample is passed through by<br>
the light in a correspondingly effective way and is guided back from the<br>
reflector, in order to reach the actual detector via the second guiding device.<br>
The measurement distance through the sample can be twice as large as the<br>
distance of the receiving surface from the surface of the reflector and the<br>
light can cover twice this distance, as already mentioned above.<br>
For a constant accuracy of the measurements and for avoiding changes in the<br>
measurement conditions between the individual measurements and also<br>
relative to the reference measurements, it is especially preferred when the<br>
reflector, which can be set or attached detachably, is locked in rotation and<br>
centered relative to the device and its housing in the position of use. In this<br>
way, it is guaranteed that it is always attached in the same position relative<br>
to the device and its housing and thus also to the receiving point after a<br>
sample has been deposited. The relevant reflection conditions match<br>
accordingly. Here, different structural possibilities are given for<br>
guaranteeing the torsional strength, even though the reflector can be<br>
removed from its position of use.<br>
So that the reflector achieves the prescribed distance to the receiving point in<br>
a repeatable way in the position of use, this distance can be set by at least<br>
one spacer between the reflector and housing or by a stop. Thus, the user<br><br>
does not need to take any precautions for maintaining the prescribed distance<br>
when placing the reflector on the device in the position of use. The<br>
formation of the spacer or a stop can also be solved structurally in different<br>
ways. Here, under some circumstances it is even conceivable that the spacer<br>
and the holder for the torsional strength of the reflector are combined<br>
together.<br>
The irradiation of light to the device can be realized in any way and also the<br>
detection can interact in a suitable way with the light outlet from the device,<br>
wherein any measurement devices can be used.<br>
However, it is especially preferred when the device has the external<br>
dimensions of a cell, which can fit into a photometer, spectrophotometer,<br>
fmorometer, or spectrofiuorometer, and which can be struck by light, and<br>
when the devices arranged in the interior of the device are arranged for<br>
guiding or directing light to the point of the device, at which inlet and outlet<br>
windows for the light used for the measurement are provided in conventional<br>
cells, wherein the first device for guiding light directs the light emitted by<br>
the photometer towards the receiving surface and the second device for<br>
guiding light directs the light coming back from the measurement point<br>
towards the detector. Through skillful selection of the dimensions of the<br>
device according to the invention, this device can be inserted into common<br>
photometers, spectrophotometers, fluorometers, or spectrofluorometers, in<br>
order to be able to be used for measuring also very small samples of a<br>
medium in terms of quantity. This considerably reduces primarily the<br>
investment and installation costs.<br><br>
It is favorable when the device is made from glass or plastic and has in the<br>
area of the light inlet, as a first guiding device, a tilted prism or a tilted<br>
mirror facing a shaft or channel at a right angle to the light inlet for a light<br>
guide or a light-guiding fiber bundle and in parallel another light guide with<br>
a second tilted prism or tilted mirror placed at its opening, which lies<br>
opposite an outlet window for the light or which forms this window.<br>
In this way, the light inlet and light outlet correspond to a commercially<br>
available cell, so that the supply line of the light and also its detection after<br>
passing through the sample can be performed very easily primarily in<br>
corresponding, already existing measurement devices.<br>
For example, the outer dimensions of the cross section of the device can<br>
correspond to those of a standard cell and can equal, in particular, 12.5<br>
millimeters by 12.5 millimeters.<br>
It should still be mentioned that the light beam emerging again from the<br>
device is aligned with the inlet light beam or can enclose a right angle with<br>
this beam. The latter is primarily preferably for fluorometers or<br>
spectrofluorometers.<br>
Primarily through the combination of individual or several of the previously<br>
described features and measures, a device is produced, which is defined<br>
above and which allows simple handling and analysis also for very small<br>
quantities of a liquid medium, independent of its viscosity. Even media of<br>
relatively high viscosity can be easily analyzed, because these media can be<br>
held without a problem on the essentially horizontal receiving surface.<br><br>
Furthermore, after a measurement is performed, cleaning is carried out very<br>
easily and can be carried out, for example, with the help of optics cleaning<br>
cloths or pads. If necessary, typical cleaning agents can be used here. It is<br>
favorable that the measurement point acted upon by the medium to be<br>
analyzed can be accessed very easily, wherein the device can even remain in<br>
the measurement device.<br>
As a whole, a device is produced, which can be used primarily in a<br>
configuration with cell-like dimensions in most commercially available<br>
measurement devices and here also in older measurement devices without<br>
modification. Reference measurement, sample measurement, and cleaning<br>
can be carried out with no interruptions with low expense and without<br>
significant time losses.<br>
Below, embodiments of the invention are described in more detail with<br>
accompanying<br>
reference to the drawing. Shown in partially schematized representation:<br>
Fig. 1 a longitudinal section of a device according to the invention with its<br>
housing, in which a light beam is input horizontally and directed<br>
upwards in the vertical direction by a first device, wherein a top<br>
receiving point area is provided for depositing the medium to be<br>
analyzed, above which a detachably fastened reflector is located, from<br>
which the light is led via a second light guide to a second device for<br>
guiding light back out of the device, wherein the receiving point is<br>
formed by optics bundling the light,<br><br>

a receiving shaft of a photometer or a similar measurement device<br>
defined for cells, and<br>

Fig. 2.<br>
In the following description, parts that are equivalent in terms of their<br>
function but that are in different embodiments have been indicated matching<br>
reference numbers, even if their shape has been somewhat modified.<br>
A device designated as a whole with 1, whose housing 6 and thus also whose<br>
housing contents are shown in a longitudinal section in Figs. 1,2, 5, and 6, is<br>
used for the analysis or absorption measurement of a small quantity, for<br>
example, a drop, of a liquid medium 2 using light, symbolized by arrows 3.<br><br>
This light is guided through the medium 2 and then detected or analyzed in a<br>
known way photometrically, spectrophotometrically, fluorometrically, or<br>
spectrofluorometrically.<br>
Primarily in the common view of Figures 1 to 4, it can be seen that the<br>
device 1 has an essentially horizontal and flat receiving point 4 area at the<br>
top in the position of use for depositing or applying drops of the medium 2, a<br>
light inlet 5 oriented horizontally in the position of use and located<br>
underneath the receiving point 4 in its housing 6, and a first device 7 located<br>
in the beam path behind the light inlet 5 for guiding the light upwards<br>
towards the receiving point 4, and also a reflector 8 that can be detachably<br>
attached above the receiving point 4. Here, in the position of use, this<br>
reflector 8 has a defined spacing from the receiving point 4, in order to<br>
produce a constant precise measurement distance for the light. According to<br>
Fig. 4, this spacing is filled or can be filled by the medium 2 at least in the<br>
area of the light passage. Furthermore, the device 1 has a second device 9 for<br>
guiding the light coming from the reflector 8 towards a detector, which is<br>
not shown in more detail in Figs. 1 and 2.<br>
With reference to Figs. 1 to 3 and here primarily Fig. 3, it becomes clear that<br>
the receiving point 4 can be accessed from above as a surface and the<br>
medium 2 to be analyzed can be fixed and held at this receiving point 4 by<br>
the force of gravity. Here, this receiving point 4 has dimensions so large that<br>
the light 3 moving towards the reflector 8 and reflected back from this<br>
reflector is guided at least once, and in both embodiments twice, through the<br>
receiving point 4 and through the medium 2. In this way, it is achieved that<br>
the measurement distance through the sample formed by the medium 2 is<br><br>
twice as large as the spacing of the receiving surface 4 from the surface of<br>
the reflector 8 and the light covers this spacing twice. In this way, the<br>
measurement distance can be twice as large as the mentioned spacing.<br>
In both embodiments according to Figs. 1 and 5, on one hand, and also<br>
according to Figs. 2 and 6, on the other hand, a light guide or light guiding<br>
fiber bundle 10 is arranged for guiding the light from the first device 7<br>
towards the receiving point 4, and similarly a light guide or a fiber bundle 11<br>
guiding the light is arranged between the receiving point 4 and the second<br>
device 9 for guiding the light coming from the reflector 8 and from the<br>
sample, so that the light can reach the receiving point 4 and the medium 2<br>
provided as a sample effectively and with the lowest possible losses.<br>
According to Figs. 1, 3,4, and 5, underneath the surface area receiving point<br>
4 for the medium 2 there are optics 12, for example, a convergent lens,<br>
which bundles the light and which is optically coupled with the light guides<br>
10 and 11.<br>
In contrast, in the embodiment according to Figs. 2 and 6, the light guides 10<br>
and 11 extend directly up to the receiving point 4.<br>
In both embodiments, the receiving point 4 is an area recess on the top side<br>
of the device 1 underneath the reflector 8. In the embodiment according to<br>
Figs. 1, 3, and 4, this receiving point 4 is formed by the boundary of the<br>
optics or lens 12 facing it, and in the embodiment according to Fig. 2 by the<br>
light guides 10 and 11 ending at this position, wherein the lens or optics 12<br>
and/or the ends of the light guides 10, 11 are set back relative to the top side<br><br>
13 of the holder for the lens or the optics or the light guides or relative to the<br>
top side 13 of the housing 6. The setting back of the optics 12 for forming<br>
the somewhat recessed receiving point 4 can be seen particularly well<br>
primarily in Figs. 3 and 4. Thus, the sample of the liquid medium 2 is also<br>
bounded and held towards the sides, to which its surface tension can also<br>
contribute. Thus, on a very small space a defined small quantity of a few<br>
microliters can be fixed and analyzed and detected by means of light.<br>
In this embodiment according to Figs. 3 and 4, the lens or optics 12 coupled<br>
with the light guides 10 and 11 are simultaneously formed as the closing<br>
window of the device 1, on which the sample of the medium 2 to be<br>
analyzed can be applied in drops. Accordingly, the operation and<br>
accessibility both for applying the sample and also for later cleaning is easy<br>
and simple.<br>
In the embodiment, the reflector 8 is a mirror, but could also be a reflecting<br>
prism, and according to Fig. 4 touches the sample without spacing in the<br>
position of use.<br>
Here, the reflector 8, which can be set or detachably attached, is locked in<br>
rotation and centered relative to the device 1 and its housing 6 in the position<br>
of use. This is realized, for example, in Figs. 1 and 2 by an edge 13 on the<br>
reflector 8 overlapping the housing 6, which has at least one open edge slot<br>
14	that is open downwards, with which a projection or pin 15 connected to<br>
the housing 6 or the device 1 can be overlapped. While the edge 13 provides<br>
the centering function, with the help of the slot 14 and the projection or pin<br>
15	the torsional strength can be implemented. Here, the pin - eccentric to the<br><br>
optics 12 - could also run through the entire device 6 and could interact at an<br>
opposite end with a second slot 14 of the edge 13 of the reflector 8 opening<br>
downwards.<br>
The spacing of the reflector 8 from the receiving point 4 is set in the<br>
embodiment by an annular spacer 16, which is arranged and, in particular,<br>
fixed between the reflector 8 and top side 13 of the housing 6. However,<br>
there could also be some other stop for the reflector 8, which also interacts,<br>
if necessary, indirectly with its edge 13. Instead of a peripheral spacer 16<br>
arranged like a ring on the reflector in the area of the edge 13, there could<br>
also be individual spacer pieces. Here, it is especially favorable when this<br>
spacer 16 is connected to the reflector 8, so that after removing the reflector,<br>
the top side 13 and the receiving point 4 are accessible unimpaired for<br>
cleaning.<br>
In Figs. 5 and 6, an especially preferred configuration of the devices 1 is<br>
shown, wherein both the device according to Fig. 1 and also that according<br>
to Fig. 2 have outer dimensions of a cell that can be struck by light and that<br>
can be used in a photometer, spectrophotometer, fluorometer, or<br>
spectrofluorometer. In each of Figs. 5 and 6, one can see a receiving shaft 17<br>
of such a photometer, spectrophotometer, fluorometer, or<br>
spectrofluorometer, which are each shown only greatly schematized. Here,<br>
the devices 7 and 9 arranged in the interior of the device 1 for feeding or<br>
guiding light to the point of the device 1, at which inlet and outlet windows<br>
are provided in typical cells for the light 3 used for the measurement,<br>
wherein the first device 7 for guiding light directs the light emitted from the<br>
photometer or the like towards the receiving surface 4 and the second device<br><br>
9 for guiding light directs the light from the measurement point and<br>
returning to the reflector towards the detector.<br>
Thus, for corresponding dimensions of the device 1, this device can be used<br>
in existing measurement devices, which increases its applicability, because<br>
they are suitable for also analyzing small and very small quantities of a<br>
medium 2. Here, it is preferable when the outer dimensions of the cross<br>
section of the device 1 correspond to a standard cell and equal, in particular,<br>
12.5 mm x 12.5 mm, because the majority of photometers or similar<br>
measurement devices are formed for such dimensions. Here, the outgoing<br>
light beam can be aligned with the incoming light beam, as is shown in Figs.<br>
1 and 2 and also in Figs. 5 and 6. However, it is also possible that the<br>
outgoing light beam encloses a right angle with the incoming light beam in<br>
an approximately horizontal plane, which is useful primarily in fluorometers.<br>
It should also be mentioned that the device 1 is preferably composed of glass<br>
or plastic and has, in the area of the light inlet 5, as a first guiding device 7, a<br>
tilted prism or a tilted mirror facing a shaft 18 or channel at a right angle to<br>
the light inlet for the light guide 10 and parallel to this light guide another<br>
light guide 11 with a second tilted prism or tilted mirror, which is arranged<br>
at the opening of the other light guide and which is opposite an outlet<br>
window for the light or forms this window. Here, the second light guide 11<br>
also extends into a shaft or channel 18.<br>
The device 1 has integrated beam steering with the help of corresponding<br>
devices 7 and 9, as well as fiber-optic light guides 10 and 11 for guiding the<br>
light 3 used for the analysis of a liquid medium 2, for example, in a<br><br>
spectrophotometer, spectrofluorometer, or a similar measurement device<br>
towards the measurement point located on the device 1 and formed as a<br>
receiving surface 4 for the medium and from this point back towards the<br>
detector of the spectrophotometer, spectrofluorometer, or the like. Here, this<br>
receiving point 4 is provided as a measurement point area on the top side of<br>
the device 1 and closed in the position of use by a cover-like, detachable<br>
reflector 8, which also touches the sample or the medium 2 without spacing<br>
and can be removed before applying the sample and also for cleaning the<br>
measurement point.<br><br>
