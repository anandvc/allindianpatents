				<td>Slip- and leveling agent<br>
The invention relates to a new slip- and leveling agent containing perfluoralkyi dicarboxylic acid /siloxane moieties and to its use as slip-and leveling agent and anti-cratering agent for a variety of applications.<br>
Difficulties related to the application of liquid resin solutions (liquid systems) such as paint, printing ink, plastic compounds and the like, to solid substrates are generally known in the art, in particular when the surface tension of the liquid system is high, and the surface tension of the solid substrate is lower.<br>
Such liquid systems are typically composed of solvents, resins, and optionally pigments, extenders and additives. In particular, modern synthetic resins have a higher intrinsic surface tension by design and function, in comparison to traditional resins based on natural fatty acids and oils. Thus, it may be more difficult to apply modern liquid systems such as modern 2-component systems like epoxies, polyester/melamines or polyurethanes, than to apply (conventional) alkyds.<br>
If water is employed as a solvent, the surface tension of the liquid formulation is high by definition. This obligates the technician to use leveling and anti-crater agents to obtain an aesthetic surface, which ensures its protective function through an uniform film. By reduction of the surface tension of the liquid system to a value below the surface tension of the substrate, spreading of the liquid is improved and the surface may level out to obtain an aesthetically more attractive film. Craters are caused by contaminates, which enter the liquid film from the outside, or are already present on the substrate. In order to avoid cratering, the liquid systems need to have a lower surface tension than the contaminate itself, usually silicone or mineral oil droplets.<br>
For the purpose of slip, leveling, substrate wetting and anti-cratering, the market offers a variety of products, ranging from organically modified polysiloxanes to fluorocarbons, waxes and other anionic, cationic or electroneutral organic surfactants, which however show well-known disadvantages such as foam formation, foam stabilisation, surface slip, overcoatability problems, and incompatibility in the liquid systems, causing craters, haze, loss of gloss, migration, sweating and poor storage stability.<br><br>
US 6,710,127 (Byk) describes a leveling agent which is a branched polymer comprising a polymeric backbone molecule into which macromonomeric units such as polydimethyl-siloxanes or perfluoroalkyl acrylates have been incorporated.<br>
WO03/033603 (EFKA) corresponding to US2004236007 describes the use of a polymer as a leveling agent or anti-cratering agent, said polymer comprising units of certain ester moieties of unsaturated dicarboxylic-acids with certain fluorinated units. Preferred co-monomers include alkyl(meth)acrylate units and/or (meth)acrylic acid and/or other vinylic compounds. WO03/033603 does not contain a monomeric unit containing a terminal reactive poly-siloxane.<br>
There is still a need for improved slip- and leveling agents having enhanced surface properties such as a good anti-cratering performance, a low coefficient of friction, a good intercoat adhesion and in addition show a good foam control.<br>
It has now been found that particular copolymers comprising perfluoroester units of an unsaturated dicarboxylic-acid; monoethylenically unsaturated polydimethylsiloxane units and common co-monomer units are very suitable slip- and leveling agents. Especially improved slip properties are obtained compared to leveling agents containing perfluoroester units of an unsaturated dicarboxylic-acid and (meth)acrylate units as disclosed in WO03/033603.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a slip- and leveling agent characterized in that it<br>
comprises a copolymer which is obtained by copolymerizing<br>
A       at least one unit of a mono- or di perfluoroester of an unsaturated dicarboxylic-acid;<br>
B      at least one terminal reactive polysiloxane unit;<br>
C      at   least   one   alkyl(meth)acrylate   unit   or   cycloalkyl(meth)acrylate   unit   and/or<br>
(meth)acrylic acid and/or other units originating from vinylic compounds that can form<br>
radicals.<br>
Advantage:<br>
The use of a slip- and leveling according to the invention gives benefits such as a low coefficient of friction, excellent slip, complete wetting of the substrate. It helps to prevent the formation of craters and pin-holes, to provide a smooth and/or equal leveling of the paint film<br><br>
without orange peel leading to improved aesthetics of the dry film. Also, edge crawling, air-draft sensitivity, fish eyes and/or other dewetting effects of the liquid resin solution during the drying stage may be avoided or at least reduced significantly.<br>
Additionally, it has been found that such a slip-and levelling agent exhibits low foam properties. All this may be achieved without loosing overcoatability of the dry film.<br>
Definitions<br>
A) Perfluoroester of unsaturated dicarboxylic-acids are mono- or diesters of fluoroalcohols or mixtures of fluoroalcohols or are as disclosed in WO03/033603 and thus may be represented by formula I,<br><br><br>
In a preferred embodiment the one or more fluorinated units A are represented by formula I wherein n is 4 -14, more preferably 4-10.<br>
Very good results have been achieved when using a copolymer wherein at least 50%, preferably 70 - 100% of the fluorinated units of the copolymer are represented by formula I wherein n is 4-14, preferably 4 -10 , and particularly wherein n is 4 or 6 or 8.<br>

In a preferred embodiment of the invention at least 50%f preferably 90 - 100% of the fluorinated monomeric units are mono-esters. An advantage of using a copolymer with a high level of monoesters, is related to the ease of manufacturing such esters. Another advantage of such a polymer is the fact that it can be rendered water-soluble in an efficient way through neutralisation of the remaining C02H-groups.<br>
Very goods results have also been achieved with a copolymer wherein at least the majority of the R1 moieties and optionally at least the majority of the R2 moieties represent a linear fluoroalkyl moiety.<br>

The slip-and levelling agent according to the invention may, for example, be a random copolymer, an alternating copolymer or a block copolymer. Preferably the co-polymer is a random copolymer.<br>
A preferred slip- and leveling agent is characterized in that it comprises a copolymer which<br>
is obtained by copolymerizing<br>
A      at least one unit of a mono- or di perfluoroester of maleic acid;<br>
B      a mono-(meth)acrylic functional polydimethylsiloxane or a mono-maleic functional<br>
polydimethylsiloxane; and C      an alkyl(meth)acrylate unit, cycloalkyl(meth)acrylate unit or a styrene unit, especially an alkyl(meth)acrylate unit or a cycloalkyl(meth)acrylate unit<br><br>
Use:<br>
The slip- and leveling agent according to the invention may be used in a variety of applications, e.g. in coatings and inks and plastics.<br>
Examples are aqueous systems (e.g. emulsion laquers, such as lacquers based upon polyurethane, alkyds, acrylics, polyester-melamine), water-reducible systems (2K-poly-urethane, alkyd, acrylic, epoxy, vinyl copolymers), (organic) solvent based systems (e.g. polyurethane-based, stoving alkyd/melamine- or polyester/melamine-based, epoxy-based, air-drying alkyds, nitrocellulose, CAB, unsaturated polyesters, acrylics, silicone resins, UV/EB-curing resins, vinyl copolymers, chlorinated rubber) and plastic compounds (hot and ambient curing unsaturated polyesters, epoxy, polyurethanes, polyvinylchloride).<br>
The slip- and leveling agent according to the invention may be present in a product (e.g. such as specified above) within a wide concentration range, of which the skilled professional will be able to determine a suitable concentration for a particular application.<br>
When the slip- and leveling agent is used in aqueous or organic solvent based systems very<br>
good results have been achieved with a product comprising<br>
A      0.1-10 wt%, preferably 0.2 - 2.5 wt%, more preferably 0.4 - 1.5 wt% of a mono- or di<br>
perfluoroester of an unsaturated dicarboxylic-acid; B      1-20wt%,  preferably  1-10wt%,   more  preferably  1-5wt%  of the  terminal  reactive<br>
polysiloxane compound; C      50-99wt%   alkyl(meth)acrylate   units   and/or  (meth)acrylic  acid   and/or  other   unit<br>
originating from vinylic compounds that can form radicals.<br>
A copolymer according to the invention or a copolymer used in accordance to the invention preferably has a number average molecular weight in the range of 1,000 to 50,000 g/mol, more preferably in the range of 2,000 to 20,000 g/mol, e.g. in the range of 2,500 to 4,000 g/mol.<br>
Very good results have also been achieved with a copolymer having a polydispersity (Mw/Mn) in the range of 1 -4, e.g. 1.1-2.<br><br>
The slip-and levelling agent may be a living copolymer, e.g. obtained by anionic polymerisation, atom transfer mechanism, nitroxide mediated techniques or other controlled polymerisation techniques. A benefit of a living copolymer is its tailor-made molecular architecture, combined with a narrower molecular weight distribution leading to smaller melting ranges and lower viscosities.<br>
Very good results have also been obtained with a copolymer in the form of a liquid or a solid (e.g. a powder), which is soluble in an organic solvent or in water, or made water-soluble after neutralization of acidic moieties. Such a system is particularly suitable for water-based systems. Suitable neutralizing agents for neutralising acidic moieties are e.g. dimethyl-ethanolamine, ammonia, other primary, secondary or tertiary amines or alkali hydroxides. An advantage of using a volatile amine neutralizing agent is that during the drying phase of a paint film, the amine neutralizing agent evaporates, leaving behind a more water resistant copolymer.<br>
In principle, the copolymer according to the invention may be prepared in any way, e.g. by a thermal radical, controlled radical, anionic or cationic polymerisation technique, of which the skilled professional will know how to employ them.<br>
The monomer employed are generally commercially available and/or may be prepared readily according to methods familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
The perfluoroesters are commercially available or may be prepared according to WO03/033603<br>
In order to prepare the leveling agent of the invention the monomers C are copolymerized with monomers A and B. e.g. using thermal random solution polymerisation or using controlled polymerisation.<br>
The invention further relates to compositions comprising a slip- and leveling agent according to the invention.<br>
Such a composition may, for example, further comprise one or more pigments, e.g. chosen from the group consisting of phthalocyanines, carbon black, titanium dioxide, ferrous oxides,<br><br>
alumino silicates, quinacridones, anthroquinones, diketopyrrolo-pyrrole, benzimidazolones and isoindolinones, one or more extenders, e.g. calcium carbonate, barium sulphate, silicium dioxide, alumium trihydoxide, organic fibres, glass and optionally one or more dispersants, e.g. polyurethane dispersants, polyester dispersants, polyacrylate dispersants, polyether derivatives, fatty acid derivatives, alkylsulphates.<br>
The slip-and leveling agents of the invention may very suitably be used in a dispersion, comprising 0-85 %, by weight, preferably 3 to 70%, of pigment and/or extender, 0.1 - 5% by weight, preferably 0.2 to 2% of a copolymer according to the invention, 10 - 95% by weight, preferably 25 to 40% of a resin, 0 - 90% by weight preferably 20 to 50% of water and/or non-aqueous liquid and 0 -15% by weight preferably 1 to 5% of dispersant.<br>
