				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
This invention is directed to hygienic absorbent articles, such as diapers, training pants and the like. Particularly, the invention is directed to disposable diapers designed to facilitate the process of fitting the diaper to a wearer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Absorbent articles are well known in the art. These articles typically have an absorbent core held or positioned in proximity to the body of a wearer during use by a fastening system in order to capture and absorb bodily exudates discharged from the wearer. Typical absorbent articles include a topsheet facing the wearer, which permits fluid exudates to pass through, and a backsheet, which prevents the exudates from escaping from the absorbent article.<br>
Disposable absorbent articles such as diapers are designed to absorb and contain bodily waste in order to prevent soiling of the body and clothing of the wearer. The disposable diapers typically comprise a single design available in different sizes to fit a variety of wearers ranging from newborns to toddlers undergoing toilet training. The design of the diaper typically affects performance, such as, ability to absorb and contain bodily waste. The size of the diaper typically affects fit, for example, the size of the diaper waist opening, the size of the openings around the thighs, and the length or "pitch" of the diaper.<br>
Articles worn externally to the body of the wearer, such as diapers, are commonly misapplied due to awkward positioning of the wearer or the restless movement of the wearer during fitting. Such misapplication may result in an uneven fit; gaps, which result in leakage; and misplaced parts (such as fasteners), which may result in marking the skin of the wearer and/or discomfort. This is particularly true of caregivers dealing with uncooperative wearers such as babies. Babies, even from a young age, move their legs into awkward positions, roll from side to side, or even violently resist diaper changes<br>
using hand and leg motions. As a result, the caregiver often has to hold portions of the wearer"s body as well as the diaper during the change process making it very difficult to<br>
achieve proper alignment of the diaper for fitting.<br><br>
Attempts have been made in the art to improve the process of applying an<br>
absorbent article to the wearer such as by using an external change aid such as described<br>
in co-pending European Patent Application No. 01117671 filed July 26, 2001. The change aids described in said application are devices that assist in the application or<br>
i<br>
removal of articles worn primarily externally on the body of the wearer, especially hygienic absorbent articles, such as diapers, adult incontinence articles, feminine protection articles and the like. However, such external devices are not integrated in the absorbent article itself requiring the caregiver to purchase an extra device<br>
Thus, there is a need for a disposable diaper including features that facilitate the changing process. Particularly, there is a need for a diaper having intuitive elements that facilitate a change by enabling a caregiver to get the fit on the wearer right the first time with minimal, if any, adjustment. There is also a need for a diaper having versatile change elements that enable it to be fitted to a wearer while the wearer is standing or lying down where in either case the diaper can easily be fitted to the wearer without costruction.<br>
SUMMARY <br>
The present invention provides a disposable absorbent article to be worn about the ower torso of a wearer that includes at least one serviceable indicium that facilitates an asy, intuitive change by aligning the article relative to an anatomical feature of the fearer or relative to a component of the article, thus enhancing the fit and corresponding ergbrmance of the article. The disposable absorbent article includes a body-facing surface and a garment-facing surface; a longitudinal axis and a transverse axis; a first aist region with a first end edge, a second waist region with a second end edge, and a backotch region interposed therebetween. A pair of opposing longitudinal side edges join the first end edge and the second end edge. The disposable absorbent article includes a acksheet having a body-facing surface and a garment-facing surface, and a core disposed in the body-facing surface of the backsheet.<br>
Embodiments of the disposable absorbent article include at least one externally visible serviceable indicium disposed on portions of the disposable absorbent article proximate the longitudinal side edges in at least the crotch region. The disposable absorbent article may also include at least one externally visible serviceable indicium disposed on portions of the disposable absorbent article proximate the first and second end edges. The externally visible serviceable indicia distinguish the portions of the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the longitudinal side edges and portions of the article proximate the first and second end edges from a portion of the garment-facing surface of the article proximate an intersection of the longitudinal and transverse axes. For these embodiments, the externally visible serviceable indicia can provide a contoured pattern complementing features of the disposable absorbent article such a shaped core, barrier leg cuffs and/or a fastening system.<br>
For instance, in one embodiment, the disposable article includes a first ear panel disposed along each longitudinal side edge in the second waist region. Each first ear panel includes a body-facing surface and a garment-facing surface. At least a portion of each of the first ear panels includes at least one externally visible serviceable indicium complementing the externally visible serviceable indicium disposed on the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the first and second end edges and/or proximate the longitudinal side edges. For this embodiment, the disposable absorbent article includes a fastening system for releasably securing the first waist region and the second waist region about the lower torso of the wearer. During fitting, the at least one externally visible serviceable indicia on the portion of each of the first ear panels are aligned with the externally visible serviceable indicia proximate the first end edge to form a composite substantially aligned indicia encircling the waist of the wearer. At the same time, the at least one externally visible serviceable indicium on the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the longitudinal side edges form composite substantially aligned indicia encircling the legs of the wearer. The composite substantially aligned indicia encircling the waist and the legs of the wearer denote proper alignment and fit of the article about (the hips and legs of the wearer.<br>
i	Alternate embodiments include at least one internally visible serviceable indicium<br>
observable on a portion of the body-facing surface of the disposable absorbent article<br>
facilitating the alignment of the article, or components thereof, to anatomic features of the<br>
wearer during fitting.    For these embodiments the disposable absorbent article may<br>
include an elasticized topsheet with an elongated slit opening disposed therein.   The<br>
elasticized slit opening is intended to align with the wearer"s anus and/or genitals to<br>
receive fecal matter and/or urine therein. The internally visible serviceable indicia can be<br>
used to facilitate such alignment.   <br>
In another embodiment, the disposable absorbent article includes a fastening<br>
system having separate primary land secondary landing members that attach to tab<br>
members during a first fit and a second fit, respectively.   The primary and secondary<br>
landing members include serviceable indicia providing instructional marks designating<br>
matching connections with the tab" members during the first fit and the second fit. The<br>
first fit provides a loose fit which can enable the article to be maneuvered about the<br>
wearer"s lower torso during fitting and the second fit provides a secure fit about the wearer"s waist.<br>

The diaper 20 may include a fastening system 50 such as a hook and loop type<br>
fastener including at least one engaging component (male fastening component) and at<br>
 east one landing zone (female fastening component). Altjematively, the fastening system<br>
»0 may include a tab and slot type fastener wherein the tab member includes a retaining<br>
dement that interlocks with an opening such as a slit, slot,! or loop.<br>
The diaper 20 may also include side panels, referred to herein as first ear panels<br>
10, disposed in the second waist region 38. The first earjpanels 30 may be integral with<br>
he chassis 22 comprising extensions of a unibody chassis! design or alternatively, the first<br>
jar panels 30 may comprise separate members attached toi the chassis 22 using adhesives,<br>
iltrasonic bonds, radio frequency ponds, or other suitable] means. The first ear panels 30<br>
i nay be elastic or extensible to provide a comfortable, and contoured fit by initially<br>
onformably fitting the diaper 20 to the wearer and sustaining this fit throughout the time<br>
f wear well past when the diaper (20 has been loaded with exudates since the elasticized<br>
rst ear panels 30 allow the sides of the diaper 20 to expand and contract. The first ear<br>
anels 30 may also provide more effective application of the diaper 20 because even if<br>
le caregiver pulls one elasticized first ear panel 30"farther than the other during<br>
)plicauon, the diaper 20 will "self-adjust" during wear.   Examples of diapers with<br>
asticized first ear panels are disclosed in U.S. Patent £,857,067, entitled "Disposable<br>

The diaper 20 can also include side panels, referred to as second ear panels 40, disposed in the first waist region 36. Similar to the first ear panels 30, the second ear panels 40 may be integral with the chassis 22 comprising extensions of a unibody chassis design or alternatively, the second ear panels 40 may comprise separate members attached to the chassis 22 using adhesives, ultrasonic bonds, radio frequency bonds, or other suitable means. The first and second ear panels 30, 40 may be constructed in any suitable configuration accommodating a particular product design.<br>
An exemplary disposable absorbent article including serviceable indicia for facilitating an easy, intuitive change according to the present invention is the disposable diaper 20 shown in Figures 2a-2d. The disposable diaper 20 includes at least one externally visible serviceable indicium 60 that is observable along at least portions of the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 in at least the crotch region 37 and also at least one externally visible serviceable indicium 60 along portions of the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the first and second end edges 10, 12 in the first and second waist regions 36, 38, respectively. In each portion, the serviceable indicia are externally visible so as to distinguish portions of the garment facing surface of the article proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 and first and second end edges 10,12 from a portion of the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the center of the article defined by an intersection of the longitudinal and transverse axes 100, 110. The externally visible serviceable indicia 60 may be disposed directly on the garment-facing surface of the backsheet 26, on the surface of the backsheet 26 opposite the garment-facing surface adjacent to the core 28, on one of the components of the jbacksheet 26, or beneath the backsheet 26 on underlying layers so long as the indicia are I externally visible. The externally visible serviceable indicia 60 may comprise a separate "element affixed to a component of the article or may comprise a colorant, such as a dye or<br>
ink, applied to a component of the article. In addition, the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 may include a color, a pattern, and/or a texture that distinguish the designated portions from the center portion of the article.<br>
For externally visible serviceable indicia comprising a pattern, the pattern may be in the form of a series of shapes and/or images. For example, the pattern may be formed of one or more dots, one or more ines, one or more regular or irregular shapes (such as circles, ellipses, diamonds, squares, and the like), or combinations thereof. Alternatively, a patten) may be in the form of a variation of color along a length of the serviceable indicia. For example, the color may vary from light to dark or from one hue to another, linages may include drawings of characters or objects readily recognizable to children.<br>
For serviceable indicia comprising texture, portions of the backsheet 26 may be mechanically treated to provide, texture by methods known in the art, including nechanical operations, such as pleating, corrugating, or ring rolling to provide folds that are able to open when the backsheet 26 is extended in a direction generally orthogonal to the pleats or folds. In addition to providing texture, these mechanical operations may also provide extensibility. Suitable processes for ring rolling or pre-corrugating, including extensible webs made thereby, are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,107,364 issued to sisson on August 15, 1978; U.S. Patent No. 4,834,741 issued to Sabee on May 30,19S9; J.S. Pat No. 5,167,897 issued to weber et al. on December 1,1992, and U.S. Patent No. i,702,382 issued to Osbom, HI et al. on December 30, 1997, each of which are hereby acorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alternatively, serviceable ijndicia comprising texture may be accomplished by rming a strainable network having at least two contiguous, distinct, and dissimilar ;gjons. Films thus formed have; in the past been termed structural elastic-like films SELF"). A structural elastic-like" film or web is an extensible material that can exhibit l elastic-like behavior in the direction of elongation without the use of added elastic aterials. However, SELF webs can be made which exhibit little elastic behavior. In articular, webs comprising a laminate of films and ndnwovens can be made which ihibit little elastic behavior beyond very low levels of strain.<br>
I        Serviceable indicia comprising SELF suitable for the present invention, and ethods of forming SELF webs suitable for use as backsheets 26, are more completely<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,518,801 entitled Web Materials Exhibiting Elastic-Like Behavior, issued to Chappell, et, al. on May 21, 1996; U.S. Patent No. 5,650,214 entitled Web Materials Exhibiting Elastic-Like Behavior and Soft, Cloth-like Texture, issued to Anderson et al. on July 22, 1997; and U.S. Patent No. 5,904,673 entitled Absorbent Article with Structural Elastic-like Film Web Waist Belt, issued to Roe et al. on May 18, 1999, all of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. For film/nonwoven laminate backsheets, the processes described in the above-mentioned patents can be performed on the laminate material, or on the separate components prior to lamination, or both.<br>
For the embodiment shown in Figure 2a, the first ear panels 30 disposed along each of the longitudinal side edges 14 in the second waist region 38, include a body-facing surface and a garment-facing surface, a proximal edge 32 joined to the longitudinal side edge 14 and a distal edge 34 opposite the proximal edge 32. At least a portion of each of the first ear panels 30 includes at least one externally visible serviceable indicium 60 complementing the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 disposed on the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the first end edge 10, the second end edge 12 and/or proximate the longitudinal side edges 14. Like the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 externally observable on the garment-facing surface of the article, the at least one externally visible serviceable indicium 60 on the first ear panels 30 are also externally visible as described above.<br>
Once the article is fitted to the wearer, the externally visible serviceable indicium 60 on the garment-facing surface of the first ear panels 30 and the externally visible serviceable indicium 60 on the portion of garment-facing surface of the article near the first end edge 10 facilitate as well as accentuate the fastening system 50 by forming a composite substantially aligned indicium appearing, in one non-limiting embodiment illustrated in Figures 2b-2d, as a band encircling the waist of the wearer. Alternatively, the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 form a partially overlapping or aligned composite indicium as the article is fitted to a wearer. At the same time, the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 disposed on the portions of the garment-facing surface of [the article along the longitudinal side edges 14 encircle the legs of the wearer in a substantially overlapping and aligned manner, forming a composite substantially aligned<br>
indicium appearing, for example, as a continuous band around each of the wearer"s legs as<br>
illustrated in Figure 2c .<br>
For this embodiment, the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 on portions of<br>
the garment-facing surface of the article proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 and the<br>
externally visible serviceable indicia 60 proximate the first and second end edges 10, 12<br>
can be made to form a contoured pattern that distinguishes the first waist region 36 from<br>
the second waist region 38.   At the same time, the contoured pattern can be made to<br>
complement the wearer"s  anatomy.     For instance, the  contoured pattern for the<br>
i embodiment shown in Figure 3 is  curvilinear such that fee pattern in the second waist<br>
region 38 and a portion of the crotch region 37 is concavie relative to the intersection of<br>
the longitudinal and transverse axes 100, 110.  Such concave curvilinear pattern can be<br>
made to complement the wearer"s bjuttocks. Alternatively or else in addition to the partem<br>
n the second waist region 38, the pattern in the first waist region 36 and a portion of the<br>
;rotch region 37 can be convex relative to the intersection of the longitudinal and<br>
ransverse axes 100, 110 as shown in Figure 2a.   Such convex pattern, particularly the<br>
pattern proximate the first end edge 10, can complement the shape of the wearer"s belly.<br>
In addition to accommodating the fastening system 50 and particularly the fit of<br>
he diaper 20, the contoured pattern formed by the externally visible serviceable indicia<br>
&gt;0 can be made to accentuate other! features of the disposable absorbent article such as the<br>
ibsorbent core, the gasketing leg cuffs, or the barrier leg cuffs.    For instance, the<br>
bsorbent core 28 may have an hourglass shape design having a narrow portion in the<br>
rotch region 37 to improve the overall fit of the diaper 20. Additionally, the core 28 may<br>
Dmprise one or more rounded of otherwise shaped ends.   As shown in Figure 4, the<br>
Dntoured shape formed by one or more externally visible serviceable indicia 60 may<br>
amplement or highlight the actual! core shape or an idealiked core shape (e.g., such as an<br>
lealized core shape having rounded ends on a diaper having a core with rectangular ends<br>
 illustrated in Figure 4), making it more appealing to the consumer.  In addition, the<br>
 mtoured pattern matching the core shape can provide a visual signal indicating proper<br>
ignment of the diaper 20 with respect to the wearer"s lower torso, i.e., in the lateral<br>
Tection, enhancing the fit of the diaper 20 in the wearer"s crotch region 37, thus<br>
lproving the overall performance of the diaper 20.   On fee other hand, the contoured<br>
pattern disposed on the garment-facing surface of the article may align with the barrier cuffs or gasketing leg cuffs disposed on the body-facing surface of the disposable absorbent article, accenting the articles ability to prevent leakage. In some of these embodiments, only externally visible serviceable indicia 60 proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 and/or proximate one of the end edges 10, 12, e.g., the second end edge 12 proximate the second waist region 38, may be required to accentuate the absorbent core 28 and facilitate lateral alignment of the article with respect to the wearer"s anatomy.<br>
In certain embodiments, the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 may be sufficiently opaque, or have a sufficiently dark color, to additionally provide a masking benefit, effectively preventing visual detection of a layer, material, or substance underlying the serviceable indicia. For example, the externally visible serviceable indicia 60 proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 of a diaper 20 may have an opacity such that feces and/or portions of the absorbent core 28 that may be present under the region of the backsheet 26 proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 of the diaper 20 are not visible from outside the diaper 20.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments, disposable absorbent article can include instructional serviceable indicia 70 providing guidance or instruction to the caregiver relative to the tightness of fit of the article about the wearer. In particular, the instructional serviceable indicia 70 can indicate to the caregiver whether to adjust the fit or switch to a different size diaper in which proper fit can be obtained. For example, instructional serviceable indicia 70 can be disposed on the garment facing surface of the article matching instructional serviceable indicia 70 on the garment facing surface of the first ear panels 30 to provide an indication that the first ear panels 30 either do not sufficiently overlap the first waist region 36 indicating a loose fit, or overlap the first waist region 36 too far indicating an uncomfortably tight fit In particular, too little an overlap may result in overly loose leg fit while too great an overlap may result in overly tight leg fit. Preferably, the instructional serviceable indicia 70 are disposed proximate the longitudinal side edges 14 of the article for at least a portion of the longitudinal side edge 14 and proximate the inner edge 35 of the first ear panel 30 for at least a portion of the inner edge 35 as shown in Figure 5.    The instructional serviceable indicia 70<br>
providing guidance or instruction to the caregiver relative to the tightness of fit may include dots, graphics of characters, numbers, line segments, and/or patterns.<br>
In an alternate non-limitin"g embodiment, the disposable absorbent article has a<br>
body-facing surface including portions thereof having at least one internally visible<br><br>
serviceable indicium 80. The internally visible serviceable indicium 80 may facilitate an<br>
easy, intuitive change by providing a guide for aligning the wearer with the article during<br>
fitting so that in turn the wearer is j accurately placed on tne article for fastening, requiring<br>
rmnimal adjustment.	<br>
hi certain non-limiting embodiments, the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 can be disposed on the body-facing surface of the articlje to facilitate the placement or alignment of the article, or a component thereof, with .respect to the lateral axis 110 and/or longitudinal axis 100 of the article with an anatomic feature of the wearer. For instance, the topsheet 24 of the article may comprise anhen aligned to the anus, results n improved fit and waste containment performance of the article. In an embodiment shown in Figure 6, the internally visible serviceable indicium 80 is visible on the body-facing side of diaper 20 identifying the crotch area to aid in longitudinal positioning. In he embodiment shown in Figure 7, the internally visible serviceable indicium 80 is<br>
colored and includes a three dimensional contour to facilitate alignment of the article with<br>
he wearer during fitting as shown in Figure 8.<br>
Similar to the embodiments including externally visible serviceable indicia 60, the<br>
ltemally visible serviceable indicia 80 may include a color, a pattern, and/or a texture<br>
lat distinguish the designated portions of the body-facing surface of the article from<br>
ther regions of the body-facing svirface not comprising the internally visible serviceable<br>
tdicia 80.   The internally visible serviceable indicia 80 may be associated with any<br>
portion or component of the article visible on or through the body-contacting surface of<br>
e article, including the topsheet 24, the absorbent core 28 or portions thereof, the<br>
stening system 50, the topsheet 24, and the backsheet 26.  In additional embodiments,<br>
e internally visible serviceable indicia 80 may be dispojsed proximate the longitudinal<br>
ie edges 14 and proximate the first and second end edges 10, 12 of the article to provide<br>
contoured pattern distinguishing jthe first waist region 3(5 from the second waist region<br>
38. The contoured pattern can be made to complement the wearer"s anatomy indicating to the caregiver where to place the wearer during fitting. For instance, internally visible serviceable indicia 80 can form a curvilinear pattern such that the pattern in the second waist region 38 is concave relative to the longitudinal and transverse axes 100, 110 in order to match the contours of the wearer buttocks. The pattern in the first waist region 36 can also be curvilinear relative to the longitudinal and transverse axes 100, 110 or else linear, but in either case, contoured to match the sides of the wearer"s lower back. As a result, the contoured partem can be produced to provide an imprint of a wearer"s lower back and buttocks region on the body-facing surface of the article directing the caregiver where to place the wearer during fitting.<br>
As described above for externally visible serviceable indicia 60, the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 may be disposed on the body-facing surface of the topsheet 24 or beneath the topsheet 24 as long as it is visible from the body-facing surface. In addition, the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 can have different colors, color patterns, gradient patterns, or textures used in order to communicate softness of the article towards the body and also provide some opacity sufficient to mask any underlying layer or material, thereby preventing the visual discernment of the layer, material, or substance through the serviceable indicia.<br>
In some preferred embodiments comprising an elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 having a hole or slit 90 adapted to allow feces to pass to the underside of the topsheet 24, such as those described above and in detail in copending Patent Application No. 01117670 filed July 26, 2001 and copending European Patent Application No. 01117669 filed July 26, 2001, the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 on the body-facing surface of the article may facilitate alignment of the hole or slit 90 with the anus and/or gluteal groove. In these embodiments, the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 may comprise colored regions on the body-facing surface of the article along the longitudinal and/or lateral edges of the hole or slit 90.<br>
In an embodiment shown in Figure 9, the diaper 20 includes an elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 having a hole 90 adapted to allow feces to pass to the underside iof the topsheet 24. In this particular embodiment, the internally visible serviceable indicium 80 highlights the front region of the article with a smooth curved transition<br>
towards the back aiming at better positioning of the article in the longitudinal direction. In addition, the curvature of the colored indicia in the back provides for improved transverse positioning of the hole 90 in relation to the anus. The embodiment shown in Figure 10 is similar to the embodiment in Figure 9 in that the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 identifies the crotch area of the article and also aids in positioning of the hole 90 in the topsheet 24 n lative to the anus.<br>
Other diaper embodiments including internally visible serviceable indicia 80 for aligning the hole or slit 90 in an slasticized topsheet 24 with the anus of the wearer are shown in Figures 11-18. For the embodiment shown in Figure 11, a diaper 20 comprising an elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 includes internally visible serviceable indicia SO identifying the crotch area of the" diaper 20 and also the position of the hole 90 in the topsheet 24 relative to the anus. <br>
Figure 12 shows an alternative embodiment of internally visible serviceable mdicia 80 on the body-facing side of an article having an elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 with the internally visible indicia identifying the front waist region of the diaper 20 and highlighting a target urination zone 95 therein that is particularly applicable for male wearers. Figure 13 shows an embodiment similar to the embodiment in Figure 12, with a gradient color and patterns to create a smoother transition between front and rack of the article. A further embodiment is shown in Figure 14, where internally visible ;erviceable indicium 80 on the body-facing side of the article highlights the slit area 90 vhile the internally visible serviceable indicium 80 in the front waist area highlights the arget urination zone 95, the combination of which facilitates alignment of the article ilative to the wearer"s anus and gentiles during fitting.     :<br>
The embodiment shown in Figure 15 provides two different internally visible serviceable indicia 80, an outer injdicium identifying the icrotch region 37 and aiding in intgitudinal positioning of the article and an inner mdiciurh identifying the position of the it or hole 90 in the elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 and aiding in positioning of the it or hole 90 relative to the anus." In the embodiment shown in Figure 16, the internally sible serviceable indicia 80 indicate the front and back wjaist areas and also highlight the rget zone therebetween for the anus relative to the elasticated slit area.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 17, the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 on the body-facing side of an elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 comprise curved colored elastics to highlight the elasticity and the positioning of the hole 90 with respect to the anus. In addition, the stripe pattern underneath the topsheet 24 highlights the passage area for feces.<br>
Figure 18 shows an alternative embodiment of a combination of different internally visible serviceable indicia 80 which highlight the crotch area to allow better longitudinal positioning of the diaper 20, indicate the target urination zone 95 in the front waist region, and highlight the slit or hole 90 disposed in the elastically foreshortened topsheet 24 providing alignment relative to the anus. The internally visible serviceable indicia 80 highlighting the slit or hole 90 can also provide masking of feces discharged by the wearer once it has passed through the hole 90.<br>
In addition to the internally visible serviceable indicia 80, the diaper 20 may include a pair of barrier leg cuffs and a pair of elastically contractible gasketing leg cuffs. Each of the gasketing leg cuffs is disposed outside of a barrier leg cuff, adjacent to the longitudinal side edge. The barrier leg cuffs and the gasketing leg cuffs may be tinted a color complementing the pattern or color of the internally visible serviceable indicia 80 on the topsheet 24 providing an additional guide for aligning the article with the wearer"s lower torso during fitting.<br>
In addition, each of the gasketing leg cuffs may comprise one or more elastic strands covered by a portion of the longitudinal side edge of the backsheet 26 that is folded over the one or more elastic strands to form a finished gasketing leg cuff. For this smbodiment, the garment-facing surface of the article may include serviceable indicia forming a pattern as previously described such that once the longitudinal side of the backsheet 26 is folded over the elastic strands forming the finished cuffs, the finished leg ;uffs may include the serviceable indicia on the body-facing surface of the diaper 20.<br>
In addition to the features described above, the disposable absorbent article iccording to the present invention may include a fastening system 50 designed to acilitate an easy intuitive change. An example of an embodiment including such a fastening system 50 is shown in Figure 19. For this embodiment, the fastening system 50 eleasably attaches the first waist region 36 to the second waist region 38 and provides a<br>
first fit and a second fit.   The first fit provides a loose fit enabling the article to be<br>
maneuvered about the wearer"s lower torso during fitting and the second fit provides a<br><br>
secure fit about the wearer"s waist For instance, during the first fit, the diaper 20 may be fitted loosely around the wearer"s ankles while standing and then pulled up around the<br>
wearer"s waist and tightly secured by the second fit. The fastening system 50 includes primary and secondary landing nembers 52, 54 corresponding to the first fit and the second fit. In addition to the instructional serviceable indicia 70 previously described for providing guidance or instruction to the caregiver relative to the tightness of fit, the primary and secondary landing members 52, 54 can include instructional serviceable indicium 70 providing instruction to the caregiver corresponding to the first fit and the<br>
second fit.<br><br>
For this embodiment, the fastening system 50 may include a hook and loop type fastener including at least one engaging component (male fastening component) and at least two landing zones (female fastening components). In this case, the two landing zones provide the primary and secondary landing members 52, 54. Alternatively, the fastener may include a tab and slot type fastener wherein the tab member includes a retaining element that interlocks with an opening such as a slit, slot, or loop as disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Pate; it No. 6,251,097 issued to Kline, et al. incorporated herein by reference. For this embodiment the tab and slot fastener comprises at least two slit, slot, or loop openings providing the primary and secondary landing members 52, 54. "or tab and slot type fasteners, primary and secondary landing members 52, 54 are eparated by a distance. For hoo c and loop type fasteners, the primary and secondary aiding members 52, 54 may be separated by a distance or, else contiguous.<br>
The instructional serviceab :e indicia 70 disposed on the landing members include<br>
instructions designating matching connections between the tab members and first or second landing members 52, 54. The instructions might include graphics of characters lustrating the orientation and/or configuration of the diaper 20 during the first fit and the second fit For instance, a graphic might illustrate a loose fitting diaper fitted about the aist of the character during the first fit and a tight fitting diaper secured about the waist of the character during the second fit.<br>
Instructional serviceable indicia 70 disposed on the first and second landing members may be particularly useful where the diaper includes the versatility of being fitted to the wearer while the wearer is standing or lying down. For such an embodiment, the first fit may comprise fitting the diaper to the wearer while the wearer is standing in which case the diaper is fitted around the wearer"s ankles by attaching the tabs to the first landing members and then pulled up around the lower torso of the wearer. Once the diaper is positioned around the lower torso, the diaper may be adjusted to achieve the second fit by removing the tabs from the first landing members and engaging them with the second landing members. For this embodiment, the graphic on the first landing member may include a character wearing a diaper around its ankles while the graphic on the second landing member includes a character wearing a diaper secured about its waist.<br>
In addition to graphics, the instructional serviceable indicia 70 may also comprise words such as "ankles" and "waist" associated with the position of the article during the first fit and the second fit or they may designate the type of fit such as "loose" and "snug". Also, the instructional marks may comprise numbers such as one "1" and two "2" designating the first and second fits, respectively.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 19, the fastening system 50 includes two tab members 56. Each tab member 56 has a tab proximal edge 57 disposed at the distal edge 34 of each of the first ear panels 30, a tab distal edge 58, a tab body-facing surface, and a tab garment-facing surface. Each tab member 56 includes fastening elements disposed proximate the tab distal edge 58. Second ear panels 40 are disposed along each longitudinal side edge 14 in the first waist region 36. Each second ear panel has a body-facing surface and a garment-facing surface, a proximal edge 42 joined to the longitudinal side edge 14 and a distal edge 44 opposite the proximal edge 42. A primary landing member 52 is disposed on the garment-facing surface of each of the second ear panels 40. The secondary landing member 54 is disposed on the garment-facing surface of the article in the first waist region 36. During fastening the primary landing member 52 provides a first fastening point wherein once the tab member 56 is engaged a first fit is achieved. Ihe first fit provides a loose fit about the wearer enabling the diaper to be maneuvered about to achieve an effective orientation for wear. The second landing member 54 provides a second fastening point for achieving a second fit where the article is tightly<br>
secured about the waist of the wearer. For this embodiment the instructional serviceable indicia comprise graphics. The graphic on the first landing member 52 includes a character wearing a diaper around its ankles while the graphic on the second landing member 54 includes a character wearing a diaper secured about its waist.<br>
While particular embodiments and/or individual features of the present invention have been illustrated and described, it would be obviousj to those skilled in the art that various other changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Further, it should be apparent that all combinations of such embodiments and features are possible and can result in preferred executions of the invention.
