				<td>INHIBITORS OF SODIUM GLUCOSE CO-TRANSPORTER 2 AND METHODS OF THEIR USE<br><br>
This application claims priority to U.S. provisional application nos. 60/848,156, filed September 29, 2006, 60/905,714, filed March 8, 2007, and 60/948,780, filed July 10, 2007, the entireties of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
1. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates to methods of treating metabolic diseases and disorders such as diabetes, and to compounds and pharmaceutical compositions useful therein.<br><br>
2. BACKGROUND<br><br>
The sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is a transporter that reabsorbs glucose from the renal filtrate and prevents the loss of glucose in the urine. Because competitive inhibitors of SGLT2 cause the renal excretion of glucose, they may be used to normalize high blood glucose levels associated with diseases such as diabetes. Handlon, A.L., Expert Opin. Ther. Patents 15(11^:1531-1540 (2005).<br><br>
A number of SGLT2 inhibitors have been disclosed. See, e.g., Handlon, supra; U.S. patent no. 6,515,117; U.S. patent application publication nos. US 2006/0035841, US 2004/0138439. At least one inhibitor is in clinical development as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes mellitus. See, e.g., Komoroski, B., et al., "Dapagliflozin (BMS-512148), a Selective Inhibitor of the Sodium-Glucose Uptake Transporter 2 (SGLT2), Reduces Fasting Serum Glucose and Glucose Excursion in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Over 14 Days" American Diabetes Assn. 67th Scientific Sessions. Abstract 0188-OR (2007).<br><br>
The first known SGLT2 inhibitor was the natural product phlorizin (glucose, l-[2-(ß- D-glucopyranosyloxy)-4,6-dihydroxyphenyl]-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)- 1 -propanone), and "all subsequent SGLT2 inhibitors have been glycosides derived from its structure." Handlon, supra, at 1533. Phlorizin consists of a glucose moiety and two hydroxylated aromatic rings joined by a propanone spacer. Ehrenkranz, J.R.L., et al.. Diabetes Metab. Res. Rev. 21 :31-38 (2005). A review of the patent literature does not reveal any synthetic SGLT2 inhibitors that do not contain a glucoside moiety or a derivative thereof. Handlon, supra. In fact, "because of the relative uniformity of the glycosides in the SGL T2 patent literature, it has become <br><br>
increasingly difficult for potential drug inventors to find unexplored chemical space." Id. at 1537. But attempts are still being made. See, e.g., U.S. patent application nos. 11/168,905 to Eckhardt et ah, entitled "D-Xylopyranosyl-Substituted Phenyl Derivatives, Medicaments Containing Such Compounds, Their Use and Process for Their Manufacture;" 11/182,986 to Eckhardt et ah, entitled "Methylidene-D-Xylopyranosyl- and Oxo-D-Xylopyranosyl-<br><br>
Substituted Phenyl Derivatives, Medicaments Containing Such Compounds, Their Use and Process for Their Manufacture;" and 11/199,962 to Eckhardt et al, entitled "D- Xylopyranosyl-Phenyl-Substituted Cycles, Medicaments Containing Such Compounds, Their Use and Process for Their Manufacture."<br><br>

Unless otherwise indicated, the term "stereomerically pure" means a composition that comprises one stereoisomer of a compound and is substantially free of other stereoisomers of that compound. For example, a stereomerically pure composition of a compound having one stereocenter will be substantially free of the opposite stereoisomer of the compound. A stereomerically pure composition of a compound having two stereocenters will be substantially free of other diastereomers of the compound. A typical stereomerically pure compound comprises greater than about 80% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 20% by weight of other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 90% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 10% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 95% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 5% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, greater than about 97% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 3% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound, or greater than about 99% by weight of one stereoisomer of the compound and less than about 1% by weight of the other stereoisomers of the compound. <br><br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the term "substituted," when used to describe a chemical structure or moiety, refers to a derivative of that structure or moiety wherein one or more of its hydrogen atoms is substituted with a chemical moiety or functional group such as, but not limited to, alcohol, aldehyde, alkoxy, alkanoyloxy, alkoxycarbonyl, alkenyl, alkyl (e.g., methyl, ethyl, propyl, t-butyl), alkynyl, alkylcarbonyloxy (-OC(O)alkyl), amide (-C(O)NH- alkyl- or -alkylNHC(O)alkyl), amidinyl (-C(NH)NH-alkyl- or -C(NR)NH2), amine (primary, secondary and tertiary such as alkylamino, arylamino, arylalkylamino), aroyl, aryl, aryloxy, azo, carbamoyl (-NHC(O)O-alkyl- or -OC(O)NH-alkyl), carbamyl (e.g., CONH2, as well as CONH-alkyl, CONH-aryl, and CONH-arylalkyl), carbonyl, carboxyl, carboxylic acid, carboxylic acid anhydride, carboxylic acid chloride, cyano, ester, epoxide, ether (e.g., methoxy, ethoxy), guanidino, halo, haloalkyl (e.g., -CCI3, -CF3, -C(CF3)3), heteroalkyl, hemiacetal, imine (primary and secondary), isocyanate, isothiocyanate, ketone, nitrile, nitro, oxo, phosphodiester, sulfide, sulfonamido (e.g., SO2NH2), sulfone, sulfonyl (including alkylsulfonyl, arylsulfonyl and arylalkylsulfonyl), sulfoxide, thiol (e.g., sulfhydryl, thioether) and urea (-NHCONH-alkyl-).<br><br>
Unless otherwise indicated, a "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound is an amount sufficient to provide a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of a disease or condition, or to delay or minimize one or more symptoms associated with the disease or condition. A "therapeutically effective amount" of a compound means an amount of therapeutic agent, alone or in combination with other therapies, which provides a therapeutic benefit in the treatment or management of the disease or condition. The term "therapeutically effective amount" can encompass an amount that improves overall therapy, reduces or avoids symptoms or causes of a disease or condition, or enhances the therapeutic efficacy of another therapeutic agent. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms "treat," "treating" and "treatment" contemplate an action that occurs while a patient is suffering from the specified disease or disorder, which reduces the severity of the disease or disorder, or retards or slows the progression of the disease or disorder.<br><br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the term "include" has the same meaning as "include, but are not limited to," and the term "includes" has the same meaning as "includes, but is not limited to." Similarly, the term "such as" has the same meaning as the term "such as, but not limited to." <br><br>
Unless otherwise indicated, one or more adjectives immediately preceding a series of nouns is to be construed as applying to each of the nouns. For example, the phrase "optionally substituted alky, aryl, or heteroaryl" has the same meaning as "optionally substituted alky, optionally substituted aryl, or optionally substituted heteroaryl." It should be noted that a chemical moiety that forms part of a larger compound may be described herein using a name commonly accorded it when it exists as a single molecule or a name commonly accorded its radical. For example, the terms "pyridine" and "pyridyl" are accorded the same meaning when used to describe a moiety attached to other chemical moieties. Thus, the two phrases "XOH, wherein X is pyridyl" and "XOH, wherein X is pyridine" are accorded the same meaning, and encompass the compounds pyridin-2-ol, pyridin-3-ol and pyridin-4-ol.<br><br>
It should also be noted that if the stereochemistry of a structure or a portion of a structure is not indicated with, for example, bold or dashed lines, the structure or the portion of the structure is to be interpreted as encompassing all stereoisomers of it. Moreover, any atom shown in a drawing with unsatisfied valences is assumed to be attached to enough hydrogen atoms to satisfy the valences. In addition, chemical bonds depicted with one solid line parallel to one dashed line encompass both single and double (e.g., aromatic) bonds, if valences permit.<br><br>

5.3. Methods of Synthesis<br><br>
Compounds of the invention may be prepared by methods known in the art and by those described herein. For example, compounds may be prepared by methods such as that shown below in Scheme 1 : <br><br><br><br><br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
In this method, known alcohol l(a) (see, e.g., Nucleosides Nucleotides, 20:649-652 (2001)) is oxidized under suitable conditions (e.g., with an oxidant such as oxalyl chloride in DMSO) to form aldehyde l(b). Treatment of a bromide of formula l(c) with an agent such as butyl lithium or magnesium bromide followed by addition to aldehyde l(b) produces alcohol l(d). Treatment of that compound with an alcohol or water under acidic conditions produces compound l(e). If desired, methods well known in the art may be used to transform compound l(e) into various other compounds encompassed by this invention (e.g., compounds of formula I, wherein one or more OfR2A, R2B and R2c is not hydrogen, and/or Ri is SRiA or NHRIA).<br><br>
With regard to scheme 1 and other synthetic approaches described herein, methods of preparing the A and A-Y-B moieties are well known, as are methods of their use to prepare SGL T2 inhibitors. For example, the synthesis of linked diaryl derivatives in the preparation of SGLT2 inhibitors is described in U.S. patent nos. 7,045,665 and 7,053,060; in U.S. patent application nos. 10/735,179; 10/745,075; 11/080,150; and 11/182,986; and in international patent application nos. WO 2006/006496 and WO 2006/089872.<br><br>
The synthesis of SGL T2 inhibitors containing linked phenyl-carbocycle moieties is described, for example, in U.S. patent application nos. 11/190,315 and 11/199,962. The synthesis of linked heterocycles and their use to provide SGL T2 inhibitors is described, for example, in U.S. patent application nos. 10/540,519; 10/734,573; 11/247,216; 11/247,356; and in international patent application nos.

Piperidine-based compounds may be prepared by methods such as that shown below in Scheme 2:<br><br><br>
Scheme 2<br><br>
In this method, compound 2(a), which may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1, is contacted with an azide (e.g. , diphenylphosphoryl azide) under conditions sufficient to provide the azide 2(b). The azide is then treated under acidic conditions to provide the deprotected furan 2(c), which is subsequently treated with a reducing agent (e.g., hydrogen in the presence of platinum oxide) under acidic conditions to provide compound 2(d). If desired, methods well known in the art may be used to transform compound 2(d) into various other compounds encompassed by this invention (e.g., compounds of formula I, wherein one or more Of R2A, R2B and R2c is not hydrogen, and/or Ri is SRIA or NHRIA).<br><br>

Scheme 3<br><br>
In this method, compound 3(a), which may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1, is contacted with a suitable sulfur-containing compound (e.g., thioacetate) under suitable <br><br>
conditions (e.g., in the presence of diethylazodicarboxylate) to form thioacetate 3(b). The thioacetate is then treated with a suitable base (e.g., cesium hydroxide) to provide the thiol of formula 3(c), which is subsequently treated with an alcohol or water under acidic conditions to provide compound 3(d). If desired, methods well known in the art may be used to transform compound 3(d) into various other compounds encompassed by this invention (e.g., compounds of formula I, wherein one or more OfR2A, R2B and R2c is not hydrogen, and/or Ri is SRiA or NHRIA).<br><br>
Compounds comprising a fluoronated sugar or sugar analogue (compounds of formula I, wherein R2 is F) may be prepared from the correspondingly substituted starting materials using methods known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. patent application no. 10/735,179.<br><br>

Scheme 4<br><br>
In this method, compound 4(a), which may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1, is contacted with a reactive compound (e.g., methylchloro formate) under suitable conditions to form methyl carbonate 4(b). The methyl carbonate is then treated with an alcohol under acidic conditions to provide compound 4(c). If desired, methods well known in the art may be used to transform compound 4(c) into various other compounds encompassed by this invention (e.g., compounds of formula II, wherein one or more OfR2A, R2B and R2c is not hydrogen).<br><br>
Using methods known in the art, the synthetic approaches shown above are readily modified to obtain a wide range of compounds. And chiral chromatography and other well- known techniques may be used to obtain stereomerically pure compounds. See, e.g., Jacques, J., et ah, Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions (Wiley Interscience, New York, 1981); <br><br>
Wilen, S. H., et al, Tetrahedron 33:2725 (1977); Eliel, E. L., Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds (McGraw Hill, NY, 1962); and Wilen, S. H., Tables of Resolving Agents and Optical Resolutions, p. 268 (E.L. Eliel, Ed., Univ. of Notre Dame Press, Notre Dame, IN, 1972). In addition, syntheses may utilize chiral starting materials to yield stereomerically enriched or pure products.<br><br>
5.4. Methods of Use<br><br>
This invention encompasses a method of inhibiting SGLT2 activity, which comprises contacting SGLT2 with an effective amount of a compound of the invention (i.e., a novel compound disclosed herein). In one embodiment, the protein is in vivo. In another, it is ex vzVo.<br><br>
The invention also encompasses a method of decreasing blood glucose in a patient (e.g., a mammal, such as a human, dog or cat), which comprises administering to the patient an effective amount of a compound of the invention.<br><br>
The invention also encompasses a method of increasing the excretion of glucose in the urine of a patient, which comprises administering to the patient an effective amount of a compound of the invention.<br><br>
The invention also encompasses a method of restoring or increasing insulin sensitivity in a patient, which comprises administering to the patient an effective amount of a compound of the invention. The invention also encompasses a method of treating, managing or preventing a disease or disorder in a patient, which comprises administering to the patient a therapeutically or prophylactically effective amount of a compound of the invention. Examples of diseases and disorders include atherosclerosis, cardiovascular disease, diabetes (Type 1 and 2), hyperglycaemia, hypertension, lipid disorders, obesity, and Syndrome X. A particular disease is type 2 diabetes.<br><br>
The amount, route of administration and dosing schedule of a compound may depend upon factors such as the specific indication to be treated, prevented or managed, and the age, gender and condition of the patient. The roles played by such factors are well known in the art, and may be accommodated by routine experimentation. <br><br>
5.5. Pharmaceutical Formulations<br><br>
This invention encompasses pharmaceutical compositions comprising one or more compounds of the invention. Certain pharmaceutical compositions are single unit dosage forms suitable for oral, mucosal (e.g., nasal, sublingual, vaginal, buccal, or rectal), parenteral (e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, bolus injection, intramuscular, or intraarterial), or transdermal administration to a patient. Examples of dosage forms include, but are not limited to: tablets; caplets; capsules, such as soft elastic gelatin capsules; cachets; troches; lozenges; dispersions; suppositories; ointments; cataplasms (poultices); pastes; powders; dressings; creams; plasters; solutions; patches; aerosols (e.g., nasal sprays or inhalers); gels; liquid dosage forms suitable for oral or mucosal administration to a patient, including suspensions (e.g., aqueous or non-aqueous liquid suspensions, oil-in-water emulsions, or a water-in-oil liquid emulsions), solutions, and elixirs; liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient; and sterile solids (e.g. , crystalline or amorphous solids) that can be reconstituted to provide liquid dosage forms suitable for parenteral administration to a patient.<br><br>
The formulation should suit the mode of administration. For example, oral administration requires enteric coatings to protect the compounds of this invention from degradation within the gastrointestinal tract. Similarly, a formulation may contain ingredients that facilitate delivery of the active ingredient(s) to the site of action. For example, compounds may be administered in liposomal formulations, in order to protect them from degradative enzymes, facilitate transport in circulatory system, and effect delivery across cell membranes to intracellular sites.<br><br>
The composition, shape, and type of a dosage form will vary depending on its use. For example, a dosage form used in the acute treatment of a disease may contain larger amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than a dosage form used in the chronic treatment of the same disease. Similarly, a parenteral dosage form may contain smaller amounts of one or more of the active ingredients it comprises than an oral dosage form used to treat the same disease. These and other ways in which specific dosage forms encompassed by this invention will vary from one another will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1990).<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of this invention are preferably administered orally. Discrete dosage forms suitable for oral administration include tablets (e.g. , chewable tablets), <br><br>
caplets, capsules, and liquids (e.g., flavored syrups). Such dosage forms contain predetermined amounts of active ingredients, and may be prepared by methods of pharmacy well known to those skilled in the art. See, e.g., Remington 's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18 ed. (Mack Publishing, Easton PA: 1990).<br><br>
Typical oral dosage forms are prepared by combining the active ingredient(s) in an intimate admixture with at least one excipient according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. Excipients can take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration.<br><br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms. If desired, tablets can be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such dosage forms can be prepared by conventional methods of pharmacy. In general, pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredients with liquid carriers, finely divided solid carriers, or both, and then shaping the product into the desired presentation if necessary. Disintegrants may be incorporated in solid dosage forms to facility rapid dissolution. Lubricants may also be incorporated to facilitate the manufacture of dosage forms (e.g. , tablets).<br><br>

6.27. Calculating ICsn Values<br><br>
The IC50 of a compound with regard to a given target is determined by fitting the relevant data, using the Levenburg Marquardt algorithm, to the equation: y = A + ((B-A)/(l +((C/x)?D))) wherein A is the minimum y value; B is the maximum y value; C is the IC50; and D is the slope. The calculation of the IC50 is performed using XLFit4 software (ID Business <br><br>
Solutions Inc., Bridgewater, NJ 08807) for Microsoft Excel (the above equation is model 205 of that software).<br><br>
6.28. In Vivo Effect of Compounds<br><br>
The pharmacological effects of compounds of the invention was determined using six drug-treated and six vehicle -treated c57 albino male mice weaned on 45% high fat diet and individually-housed in a Nalgene metabolic cage. The mice were provided drinking water and high-fat diet paste (2 parts diet to 1 part water) ad libitum.<br><br>
Compounds were delivered two ways. In the first, mice were gavaged with drug or vehicle on day 1 with 5 ml/kg dose volume. The entire urine volume was collected for the following 24 hours into the metabolic cage plastic urine collector. Measures of mouse body weight, water consumption, food consumption (accounting for evaporation of water in the paste), and urine volume were made daily. Urine was collected daily, centrifuged, and assessed for glucose concentration using a Cobas Autoanalyzer. The final result of milligrams of glucose excreted per day was calculated from total urine volume and urine glucose concentration.<br><br>
In the second method, compounds were delivered in the diet. This was done by mixing the test compound in the high fat diet paste at the appropriate concentration, when taking into account baseline body weight and baseline food consumption. Paste containing the drug was again provided in excess each day. The amount of compound delivered per day was confirmed by calculating animal body weight and food consumption.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the effect of four compounds of the invention (A, B, C and D), when orally dosed once at 30 mg/kg, on the amount of excreted glucose during the 24 hours following dosing. By comparison, control animals excreted about 1 mg glucose over the 24 hours.<br><br>
