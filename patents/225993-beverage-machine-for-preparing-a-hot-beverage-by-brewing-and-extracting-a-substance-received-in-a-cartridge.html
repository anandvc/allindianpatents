				<td>BEVERAGE MACHINE FOR PREPARING A HOT BEVERAGE BY BREWING AND EXTRACTING A SUBSTANCE RECEIVED IN A CARTRIDGE<br>
The present invention refers to a beverage machine for preparing<br>
a hot beverage by brewing and extracting a substance received<br>
in a cartridge. Further, the invention also refers to a cartridge<br>
to be used in a beverage machine, and finally, the invention<br>
refers to a method of preparing a hot beverage by brewing and extracting<br>
a substance received in a cartridge.<br>
Cartridges of the kind referred to herein serve for receiving<br>
a. hermetically sealed substance suitable for preparing a hot beverage.<br>
A fundamental advantage of such cartridges consists in the<br>
fact that the substance contained therein, for example coffee powder,<br>
can be kept fresh during an extended period of time. For extracting<br>
coffee powder contained in such a cartridge, for example,<br>
semi-automatic espresso coffee makers are used in which the cartridge<br>
is inserted into a cartridge holder with the cover of the<br>
cartridge downwards.<br>
The document EP-A-0,512,470 discloses such a coffee maker in<br>
which the cartridge is inserted into a cartridge holder with the<br>
cover downwards. The cartridge holder is manually inserted into<br>
the coffee maker by means of a bayonet fixture. The coffee maker<br>
is provided with a piercing member located in the region of the<br>
connecting means for the cartridge holder. The piercing member has<br>
radial outlet openings for feeding brewing water into the car-<br>
tridge. Upon connecting the cartridge holder to the coffee maker,<br>
the piercing member pierces the bottom of the cartridge. The bot-<br>
tom of the cartridge holder itself is provided with a plurality of<br>
embossments arranged on a grating. These embossments penetrate the<br>
cover of the cartridge and break it open as soon as the brewing'<br>
water fed into the interior of the cartridge has built up a cer-<br>
tain overpressure. During the subsequent brewing operation, the<br>
brewing water is fed into the cartridge through the piercing mem-<br>
ber, flows under pressure through the coffee powder and is dis-<br><br>
charged through the apertures in the cover. The freshly brewed<br>
coffee beverage can flow out through the grating and leave the<br>
coffee maker through outlet means located below the cartridge<br>
holder.<br>
The document DE-C-41,92,762 discloses an apparatus for prepar-<br>
ing a liquid product by feeding a fluid and/or steam into a cartridge.<br>
The apparatus is provided with a withdrawal member, com-<br>
prising a chamber for a cartridge. The cartridge has a bottom por-<br>
tion concavely curved towards its interior. At the apparatus, a<br>
piercing pin provided with fluid channels is provided, while the<br>
bottom of the withdrawal member comprises a plurality of emboss-<br>
ments causing a perforation of the bottom of the cartridge as soon<br>
as the cartridge is sufficiently deformed under the influence of<br>
the pressure of the brewing water. In an alternative embodiment,<br>
the bottom of the withdrawal member comprises a single piercing<br>
pin, having an integrated liquid discharge channel. By providing<br>
the cartridge with a concavely shaped bottom, it is to be realized<br>
that the bottom is pierced only when the bottom of the cartridge<br>
is deformed to a certain degree and the interior volume of the<br>
cartridge has been increased. Thereby, it should be ensured that<br>
the brewing water fed into the interior of the cartridge can soak<br>
the substance received in the cartridge before the bottom of the<br>
cartridge is broken open to have the prepared beverage flow out.<br>
The document EP-A-1,295,554 discloses a coffee maker for brewing<br>
coffee powder packed into a cartridge. The coffee maker is<br>
provided with a pressurized hot water sprinkler and with a dispensing<br>
cup movable relative thereto. The dispensing cup is provided<br>
with an open hollow space, i.e. a brewing chamber, as well<br>
as with a second space, communicating with a perculator spout for<br>
dispensing the brewed coffee beverage. Between the hollow space<br>
for receiving the cartridge and the second space, a plate is provided<br>
whose top side has a plurality of needles. Each of these<br>
needles has a conical outer surface as well as several slots, each<br>
of the slots communicating via an aperture in the plate with the<br>
second space. The hot water sprinkler is provided with a cup-<br><br>
shaped front portion that is axially movable against the force of<br>
a number of springs. At the rigid back portion of the hot water<br>
sprinkler, a piercing element in the form of a plate having a plurality<br>
of needles is provided. The cup-shaped front portion is<br>
provided with an end wall, having a number of holes, through which<br>
the needles can extend when the cup-shaped front portion is in its<br>
operating position, in order to pierce the top of the cartridge.<br>
To axially move the dispensing cup relative to the hot water<br>
sprinkler, a not further shown drive means is provided. When the<br>
dispensing cup is moved towards the hot water sprinkler, the top<br>
of the cartridge is pierced by the needles provided on the hot water<br>
sprinkler, while the bottom of the cartridge remains intact<br>
because the needles on the plate have a length that is approximately<br>
equal to, but not greater than the distance between an annular<br>
shoulder at the bottom of the hollow space and an annular<br>
groove, serving to receive the above mentioned plate. The height<br>
of the needles on the plate between the hollow space and the second<br>
space, thereby, is chosen such that the needles at the most<br>
touch the bottom of the cartridge, but do not weaken it or even<br>
pierce it when the brewing chamber is closed. The brewing water<br>
having fed into the interior of the cartridge, the bottom thereof<br>
is deformed outwards under the influence of the heat and the pressure<br>
such that the needles penetrate the bottom of the cartridge<br>
and gradually pierce it.<br>
The document EP-A-1,101,430 discloses a cartridge for a beverage<br>
filter cartridge system. The side wall of this cartridge is<br>
provided with several steps for supporting a filter member or a<br>
porous membrane, such that a free space remains between the filter<br>
element and the membrane, respectively, and the cartridge cover'<br>
and cartridge bottom, respectively. This free space is used for<br>
inserting an inlet pipe and an outlet pipe, respectively, through<br>
the side wall into the cartridge.<br>
The document WO 00/42891 discloses an automatic brewing system<br>
fro brewing substances received in a cartridge. The brewing system<br>
is provided with a liquid supply tank and a dosage chamber located<br><br>
therein, the dosage chamber being operatively connected to an air<br>
pump for conveying a certain amount of liquid. The system further<br>
comprises a cartridge holder, cooperating with a movable cover.<br>
Both the cover and the bottom of the cartridge holder are equipped<br>
with a hollow piercing member. If the cartridge holder is closed<br>
by means of the cover, both the cartridge cover and the cartridge<br>
bottom are pierced by means of the respective piercing elements.<br>
The piercing element located at the bottom of the cartridge holder<br>
is designed such that an outlet for the prepared beverage is cre-<br>
ated as soon as the bottom of the cartridge is pierced.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a beverage<br>
machine for preparing a hot beverage by brewing and extracting a<br>
substance received in a cartridge in which the cartridge is broken<br>
open and pierced, respectively, to form a beverage outlet only at<br>
a predetermined moment and at a predetermined location.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
beverage machine for preparing a hot beverage by brewing and ex-'<br>
tracting a substance received in a cartridge in which the contamination<br>
of the machine by the extract leaving the cartridge in liquid<br>
form should be reduced.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
beverage machine for preparing a hot beverage by brewing and extracting<br>
a substance received in a cartridge in which the pressure<br>
of the brewing water required to break open an outlet in the cartridge<br>
sxis reduced.<br>
To meet these and other objects, the present invention provides,<br>
according to a first aspect, a beverage machine for preparing<br>
a hot beverage by brewing and extracting a substance received<br>
in a cartridge having a cartridge cover and a cartridge bottom<br>
portion. The beverage machine comprises a brewing chamber adapted<br>
to receive the cartridge with a lower brewing chamber portion and<br>
a closure element, a pump for feeding brewing water under pressure<br>
into the brewing chamber, and at least one first piercing member<br>
adapted to pierce the cartridge cover.<br><br>
Further, the machine comprises, for piercing the cartridge<br>
bottom portion, at least one second piercing member comprising at<br>
least one piercing tip portion and at least one outlet channel.<br>
Thereby, means are provided for axially moving the lower brewing<br>
chamber portion relative to the closure element for closing the<br>
brewing chamber. The length of the path of the axial movement of<br>
the lower brewing chamber portion relative to the closure element<br>
is such that the cartridge cover is pierced by the first piercing<br>
element, while the second piercing element penetrates or pierces<br>
the cartridge bottom at the most to such an extent that the outlet<br>
channel of the second piercing element does not communicate with<br>
the interior of the cartridge.<br>
Due to the fact, upon closing the brewing chamber, that the<br>
lower portion of the brewing chamber, together with the cartridge<br>
received therein, is axially moved relative to the closure element<br>
to such an extent that the tip of the second piercing member penetrates<br>
the bottom of the cartridge at the most only to such a degree<br>
that the outlet channel does not yet communicate with the interior<br>
of the cartridge, it can be ensured that the bottom of the<br>
cartridge is fully pierced, upon feeding pressurized brewing water<br>
into the cartridge, at a relatively low pressure level of the<br>
brewing water and at a predetermined location, whereby, simultaneously,<br>
the danger of contamination is substantially reduced, because<br>
the piercing of the bottom of the cartridge is performed in<br>
a continuous manner.<br>
If the bottom of the cartridge, upon closing the brewing chamber,<br>
is pierced by the piercing member located on the lower portion<br>
of the brewing chamber only to such an extent that the outlet<br>
channel does not communicate with the interior of the cartridge,<br>
it also can be ensured that any gaseous medium usually present in<br>
the interior of the cartridge can escape during feeding brewing<br>
water into the cartridge to evenly soak the substance received in<br>
the cartridge, whereby simultaneously a certain overpressure can<br>
be built up in the interior of the cartridge before the liquid extract<br>
is discharged from the cartridge.<br><br>
According to a further aspect, the invention provides a bevel<br>
age machine for preparing a hot beverage by brewing and extracting<br>
a substance received in a cartridge having a cartridge cover and cartridge bottom portion. The brewing machine comprises a brewing<br>
chamber adapted to receive the cartridge for brewing and extracting<br>
the substance contained in the cartridge with a lower brewing<br>
chamber portion and a closure element, a pump for feeding brewing<br>
water under pressure into the brewing chamber, at least one first<br>
piercing member adapted to pierce the cartridge cover and attached<br>
to the closure element, and at least one second piercing member<br>
adapted to pierce the cartridge bottom portion and attached to or<br>
located in the region of the lower brewing chamber portion.<br>
Means are provided for axially moving the second piercing mem<br>
ber attached to or located in the region of the lower brewing<br>
chamber portion relative to the lower brewing chamber portion to<br>
such an extent, after the brewing chamber having been closed by<br>
the closure member, that the bottom of the cartridge is pierced.<br>
In this way, the bottom of the cartridge can be pierced independently<br>
of the closing operation of the brewing chamber and independently<br>
of the moment of feeding brewing water into the cartridge.<br>
According to a still further aspect, the invention also provides<br>
a cartridge adapted to be used in such a beverage machine.<br>
It comprises an essentially cup-shaped cartridge body and a car-<br>
tridge cover attached to the cartridge body. The cartridge con-<br>
tains a predetermined amount of a substance extractable by means<br>
of hot water. At least one sieve-like member is located between<br>
the bottom of the cartridge body and the substance contained in<br>
the cartridge. The sieve-like member has a central recess directed<br>
towards the interior of the cartridge and dimensioned such that<br>
the front portion of a piercing member adapted to pierce the bot-<br>
tom of the cartridge body can extend into the recess, once the<br>
cartridge bottom has been pierced, without piercing the first<br>
sieve-like member.<br><br>
A second sieve-like member can be located between the cover of the cartridge body and the<br>
substance contained in the cartridge, also having a central recess directed towards the interior of the<br>
cartridge and dimensioned such that the front portion of a piercing member adapted to pierce the<br>
cover of the cartridge can extend into the recess, once the cartridge cover has been pierced, without<br>
piercing the second sieve-like member.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a beverage machine for preparing a hot beverage<br>
by brewing and extracting a substance received in a cartridge having a cartridge cover and a cartridge<br>
bottom portion, comprising a brewing chamber adapted to receive said cartridge with a lower<br>

bodiment of the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a strictly schematic view of an embodiment of. a<br>
beverage machine, designed in the present example as a coffee mak-<br>
er. Particularly, shown in Fig. 1 are a brewing chamber 1, a fresh<br>
water tank 5, a pump 6 as well as a boiler 7. The brewing chamber<br>
1, shown in a longitudinal sectional view, comprises a lower por-<br>
tion 2 and a closure element 3. Also shown in Fig. 1 in a schemat-<br>
ic longitudinal sectional view is a cartridge 4 containing ground<br>
coffee 8.<br>
The means for fixing the lower portion 2 of the brewing cham-<br>
ber 1 to the coffee maker and to the closure element 3, respec-<br>
tively, are not shown in the drawings. Neither shown are the means<br>
required for realizing the axial relative movement between the<br>
lower portion 2 of the brewing chamber 1 and the closure element 3<br>
for closing the brewing chamber.<br>
The lower portion 2 of the brewing chamber 1 comprises an out-<br>
er base portion 10 and an inner cartridge receptacle 11. Both the<br>
base portion 10 and the cartridge receptacle 11 have essentially<br>
circular shape. The cartridge receptacle 11 is adapted to receiye<br>
the cartridge 4 in a positively fitting manner and supported on<br>
the outer base portion 10 by means of springs 12. The top portion<br>
of the cartridge receptacle 11 facing the closure member 3 is pro-<br>
vided with an annular shoulder 13. The outer base portion 10 is<br>
provided with an annular flange 24, constituting, together with<br>
the shoulder 13 of the cartridge receptacle 11, an axial limit<br>
stop during closing the brewing chamber 1.<br>
The bottom of the outer base portion 10 is provided with a<br>
piercing member 15, having a central outlet channel 16. The pierc-<br>
ing member 15 can extend into the interior of the cartridge recep-<br>
tacle 11 through an opening 17 provided in the bottom of the car-<br><br>
tridge receptacle 11. Below the bottom of the base portion 10, a<br>
Y-shaped beverage outlet 18 is located, communicating with the<br>
central outlet channel 16 of the piercing member 15. The cartridge<br>
receptacle 11 simultaneously serves as a finger guard inasmuch as<br>
it prevents access to the piercing member 15 as long as the coffee<br>
maker is in its rest position as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The bottom of the closure member 3 facing the lower portion 2<br>
of the brewing chamber 1 is provided with a piercing member 20,<br>
too. Through this piercing member 20, the brewing water required<br>
for brewing and extracting the coffee powder 8 is fed into the in-<br>
terior of the cartridge 4. To this end, the piercing member 20 is<br>
provided with radial outlet openings 21 through which the brewing<br>
water can escape from the piercing member 20. The closure member 3<br>
comprises an annular gasket 23 radially surrounding the piercing<br>
member 20 and serving for sealing the top portion of the cartridge<br>
4 with regard the lower portion of the cartridge 4.<br>
The cartridge 4 comprises a cup-shaped lower portion and a<br>
cover 4a welded thereto. Both the cup-shaped lower portion and the<br>
cover 4a are made of an oxygen impermeable multi layer foil of<br>
plastic material, whereby particularly the foil constituting the<br>
cup-shaped lower portion of the cartridge 4 should be elastic.<br>
Even if such a cartridge 4 is suitable to receive any sub-<br>
stance extractable by means of water, in the following, it is as-<br>
sumed that it is filled with ground coffee, i.e. coffee powder,<br>
adapted to be used to prepare a regular coffee or an espresso cof-<br>
fee beverage.<br>
Preferably, the bottom 4b is slightly bossed, i.e. it is<br>
curved to the outside to a convex shape. Moreover, the cartridge 4<br>
is preferably provided with an upper sieve-like member 25 and with<br>
a lower sieve-like member 26. Thereby, the upper member 25 serves<br>
as a distribution sieve member and the lower member 26 as a col-<br>
lection sieve member. The two sieve members 25, 26 are provided<br>
with a plurality of apertures through which the brewing water can<br>
be fed into the interior of the cartridge 4, and the coffee bever-<br>
age can escape from the interior of the cartridge 4 filled with<br><br>
coffee powder, respectively. Both sieve members 25, 26 comprise<br>
each a central recess 33, 34 directed to the interior of the car-<br>
tridge 4 into which the corresponding piercing members 15, 20 can<br>
extend after the cover 4a of the cartridge 4 and the bottom 4b<br>
thereof, respectively, have been pierced, without damaging the<br>
sieve members 25, 26.<br>
The coffee powder 8 to be extracted is received between the<br>
two sieve members 25, 26. The two rigidly designed sieve members<br>
25, 26 serve to ensure, on the one hand, that the coffee powder"<br>
cannot escape the cartridge 4 once its cover 4a and its bottom 4b,<br>
respectively, have been pierced. On the other hand, the upper dis-<br>
tribution sieve member 25 serves to evenly distribute the brewing<br>
water entering the cartridge 4 over the entire cross section of<br>
the cartridge 4, while the lower collection sieve member 26 serves<br>
to ensure that the liquid coffee extract flows to the central<br>
piercing member 15. To this end, both at the top and the bottom-,<br>
free spaces 14, 19 are provided between the upper distribution<br>
sieve member 25 and the cartridge cover 4a, and between the lower<br>
collection sieve member 26 and the cartridge bottom 4b, respec-<br>
tively. Instead of the free spaces 14, 19 shown in the drawings.,<br>
the sieve members 25, 2 6 could also be provided with recesses iri<br>
the shape of channels in which the brewing water flows to be dis-<br>
tributed over the cross section of the cartridge 4, and in which<br>
the extracted beverage flows to be collected, respectively. In<br>
this case, the sieve members 25, 26 can be directly supported by<br>
the cover 4a of the cartridge 4 and the bottom 4b of the car-<br>
tridge, respectively, on the raised portions extending between the<br>
channels.<br>
Fig. la shows an enlarged side view of the piercing member 15<br>
The piercing member 15 is provided with a two-tiered tip 28,<br>
whereby the first portion 28a has conical shape having a smooth<br>
jacket surface and ending in an acute tip end, while the second,<br>
portion 28b has the shape of a truncated cone with a larger cone<br>
angle and is provided with several radial apertures 29, opening<br>
into the central outlet channel 16. The lower portion of the<br><br>
piercing member 15 is provided with a thread 31 by means of which<br>
it can be screwed into the bottom of the lower portion 2 of the-<br>
brewing chamber 1. Instead of radial apertures 29, the second por-<br>
tion 28b can be provided, for example, with axially extending out-<br>
let grooves, channels or the like. Moreover, instead of the thread<br>
31, for example a push-fit connection can be provided for attach-<br>
ing the piercing member 15 to the bottom of the lower portion 2 of<br>
the brewing chamber 1. In any case, the outlet channel and the ra-<br>
dial outlet openings 29, respectively, are located behind or, as<br>
seen in the drawing, below the tip 28.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the brewing<br>
chamber 1 and the cartridge 4 in a first phase during closing the<br>
brewing chamber 1. The cartridge 4 having been inserted into the<br>
cartridge receptacle 11, the lower portion 2 of the brewing cham-<br>
ber 1 is axially moved upwards, in the direction of the arrow P,<br>
towards the closure member 3. Thereby, the cartridge receptacle II<br>
is pushed into the outer base portion 10 of the lower portion 2 of<br>
the brewing chamber 1 against the force of the springs 12. Simul-<br>
taneously, the upper piercing member 2 0 penetrates the cover 4a of<br>
the cartridge 4, while the lower piercing member 15 abuts against<br>
the bottom 4b of the cartridge 4 and pushes the bottom 4b upwards,<br>
with the result that the cartridge bottom 4b is deformed towards<br>
the cartridge cover 4a and the internal volume of the cartridge 4<br>
is decreased. Due to the fact that the cup-shaped lower portion of<br>
the cartridge 4 is made of an elastic material and that the car-<br>
tridge bottom 4b is bossed, the cartridge bottom 4b can be rela-<br>
tively easily deflected in a direction towards the cartridge cover<br>
4a.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the closed brew-<br>
ing chamber 1 and the cartridge 4 before brewing water is injected<br>
into the cartridge 4. The closed state of the brewing chamber 1 is<br>
realized by mechanically moving the lower portion 2 of the brewing<br>
chamber 1 upwards to such an extent that the shoulder 13 of the<br>
cartridge receptacle 11 rests against the flange 24 of the outer<br>
base portion 10. Simultaneously, the cartridge cover 4a is hy-<br><br>
draulically sealed with reference to the cartridge bottom 4b at*<br>
the outside, due to the fact that the gasket 23 provided at the<br>
bottom of the closure element 3 is pressed, against the top of the<br>
cartridge cover 4a to seal it radially against the outside. Fur-<br>
ther, it can be seen in Fig. 3 that the tip 28 of the piercing<br>
member 15 provided at the bottom of the lower portion 2 of the<br>
brewing chamber 1, particularly its first portion 28a (Fig. 1a),<br>
penetrates the bottom 4b of the cartridge 4. Due to the fact that<br>
the first portion 28a has an acuter angle than the second portion<br>
28b, the result is that the cartridge bottom 4b rests against the<br>
second portion 28b and keeps this position once the brewing chamber<br>
1 is closed, but before brewing water is injected into the<br>
cartridge 4.<br>
Because the cartridge bottom 4b rests against the second portion<br>
28b of the piercing member 15, it can be ensured that the radial<br>
apertures 2 9 and the outlet channel 16, respectively, do not<br>
yet communicate with the interior of the cartridge 4, even if the<br>
cartridge bottom 4b is already perforated. Instead of the here<br>
shown perforating of the cartridge bottom 4b by the tip 28 of the<br>
piercing member 15, it may be sufficient to partially weaken the<br>
cartridge bottom 4b by means of the tip 28, but without the tip 28<br>
really perforating the bottom 4b. In any case, the cartridge cover<br>
4a is made of a material having a lower extensibility and/or a<br>
lower tear strength than the material of which the cartridge bottorn<br>
4b is made, to ensure that the upper piercing member 20 perforates<br>
the cartridge cover 4a, while the cartridge bottom 4b is<br>
perforated at the most by the tip 28 of the relating piercing mem-<br>
ber 15.<br>
Fig. 4 shows the so-called brewing and extracting phase in a<br>
view similar to the view in Fig. 3. In this phase, water is fed<br>
from the fresh water tank 5 into the boiler 7 by means of the pump<br>
6. In the boiler 7, the water is heated to the required brewing<br>
temperature. The heated and pressurized water is led via the upper<br>
piercing member 20 into the space 14 between the cover 4a and the<br>
upper distribution sieve member 25, where it is evenly distributed<br><br>
over the cross section of the cartridge 4. Through the openings<br>
provided in the upper distribution sieve member 25, the brewing<br>
water enters the interior of the cartridge 4 and extracts the coffee<br>
powder. Through the openings provided in the lower collection<br>
sieve member 26, the liquid coffee extract flows into the space 19<br>
between the lower collection sieve member 26 and the cartridge<br>
bottom 4b. Since the cartridge 4 is positively surrounded by the<br>
cartridge receptacle 11, the overpressure generated by injecting<br>
pressurized water into the cartridge 4 has the effect that the<br>
cartridge cover 4a is pressed against the bottom of the closure<br>
member 3 and that the cartridge bottom 4b is deflected downwards<br>
such that the internal volume substantially reaches its former<br>
value. During the injection of brewing water into the cartridge 4,<br>
any gas present in the interior of the cartridge 4 can escape<br>
through the radial gap between piercing tip 28 and cartridge bottom<br>
4b, thus ensuring an even moistening of the coffee powder 8,<br>
received in the cartridge 4. By pressing the cartridge bottom 4b<br>
downwards, as herein before described, the opening in the bottom<br>
4b of the cartridge 4 is increased to such an extent that the radial<br>
apertures 2 9 and, thereby, the outlet channel 16 communicate<br>
with the interior of the cartridge 4. Now, the liquid coffee extract<br>
can flow from the lower space 19 through the radial apertures<br>
29 in the piercing member 15 into the outlet channel 16 and,<br>
there from, into the beverage outlet 18, from where it can be dispensed<br>
into a not further shown beverage container.<br>
The mechanical weakening and piercing of the cartridge bottom<br>
4b, respectively, as previously described, brings along a number<br>
of substantial advantages:<br>
•	The cartridge bottom 4b is weakened or pierced at a pre-<br>
determined location in a well defined manner.<br>
•	After brewing water has been injected into the cartridge,<br>
a continuous enlargement of the pierced opening in the<br>
cartridge bottom takes place by gradually generating a<br>
hydraulic overpressure in the interior of the cartridge<br><br>
such that the cartridge bottom is pressed and deflected<br>
downwards towards the piercing member. Thus, the liquid<br>
coffee extract can smoothly flow out downwards through<br>
the continuously enlarging outlet cross section in the<br>
lower piercing member, since its radial apertures are<br>
continuously more and more exposed during pressing the<br>
cartridge bottom downwards. The result is, on the one<br>
hand, that the danger of contamination is reduced because<br>
the liquid coffee extract cannot suddenly escape from the<br>
cartridge as is the case with a cartridge that is pierced<br>
only under the influence of the pressurized brewing wa-<br>
ter. On the other hand, the gaseous medium contained in<br>
the cartridge, for example air and/or CO-, can escape<br>
downwards through the narrow radial gap between piercing<br>
tip and cartridge bottom once brewing water is injected<br>
into the cartridge from the top thereof. The result is"<br>
that the ground coffee contained in the cartridge is ho-<br>
mogenously moistened over the entire cross section of the<br>
cartridge once the brewing water flows into the cartridge<br>
from its top.<br>
•	The brewing water pressure required for piercing the car-<br>
tridge bottom and for enlarging the pierced opening, re-<br>
spectively, is comparatively low.<br>
•	The brewing water pressure required for piercing the car-<br>
tridge bottom and for enlarging the pierced opening, re-<br>
spectively, can be more exactly calculated.<br>
•	The cartridge may show higher manufacturing tolerances<br>
with regards of its dimensions without the danger that<br>
the brewing operation would be impaired.<br>
•	The bottom of the cartridge has not to be rigid and needs<br>
not to have a concave basic shape.<br>
•	The danger of breaking open the cartridge at an undesired<br>
location under the influence of the required high hy-<br><br>
draulic overpressure of up to 10 bar is practically eliminated.<br>
Instead of perforating the bottom of the cartridge by means o<br>
the lower piercing member, alternatively, the design could be such<br>
that the bottom 4b is only weakened by the lower piercing member<br>
15 upon mechanically closing the brewing chamber 1, without the<br>
lower piercing member 15 penetrating the bottom 4b of the cartridge<br>
4. In any case, even by means of a mechanical weakening, it<br>
can be ensured that the bottom of the cartridge is continuously<br>
broken open at a well defined location even if the brewing water<br>
is injected into the cartridge with a relatively low pressure. Independently<br>
there from, the lower piercing member 15 could be provided<br>
with a pressure control valve, opening only after a certain<br>
overpressure is reached to release the outlet channel 16.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an alternative embodiment in a view similar to<br>
Fig. 4. In this embodiment, the lower piercing member 15a is not<br>
fixedly attached to the lower portion 2 of the brewing chamber 1,<br>
but axially movable in the direction of the arrow P1 and relative<br>
to the lower portion 2 of the brewing chamber 1. The means required<br>
to move the piercing member 15a are not shown. This embodiment<br>
shows the advantage that the moment in which the bottom 4b of<br>
the cartridge 4 is pierced can be arbitrarily chosen, independently<br>
of the closing operation of the brewing chamber and of the hydraulic<br>
pressure existing in the interior of the cartridge.<br>
Preferably, the cartridge bottom 4b is pierced shortly after the<br>
brewing water has been injected into the top of the cartridge 4-.<br>
Also in this case, the piercing operation can be performed in two<br>
steps. In other words, in a first step, the cartridge bottom 4b is<br>
pierced to such an extent that the outlet channel 16a in the inte-<br>
rior of the piercing element 15 does not yet communicate with the<br>
interior of the cartridge 4; thus, the gas contained in the inte-<br>
rior of the cartridge 4 can escape. In a second step, the piercing<br>
member 15a is pushed further into the cartridge bottom 4b until<br>
the radial apertures and the outlet channel 16a of the piercing<br><br>
member 15a communicate with the interior of the cartridge such<br>
that the liquid coffee extract can flow out through the outlet<br>
channel 16a. This variant has the advantage that the moment in<br>
which the cartridge bottom 4b is pierced can be chosen independent<br>
of the closing operation of the brewing chamber and of the injec-<br>
tion of brewing water into the cartridge. Otherwise, the alterna-<br>
tive embodiment described herein before shows most of the previ-<br>
ously named advantages.<br>
The solution according to the invention can be realized in<br>
substantially all kinds of coffee makers. Particularly suitable<br>
are not only manual coffee makers with a manually insertable car-<br>
tridge holder, but also semi-automatic coffee makers in which the<br>
cartridge is manually inserted into the cartridge receptacle and<br>
automatically removed as well as fully automatic coffee makers in<br>
which the cartridge is both automatically inserted into the car-<br>
tridge receptacle and automatically removed there from. However,<br>
essential is that a certain relative axial movement between the<br>
cartridge received in the lower portion of the brewing chamber and<br>
the closure element takes place upon closing the brewing chamber,<br>
to ensure that, on the one hand, the cartridge cover is reliably<br>
pierced and, on the other hand, the cartridge bottom is at least<br>
partially weakened. Such relative movement usually has to amount<br>
to several millimeters and can be realized, for example, by means<br>
of a bayonet fixing, an eccentric drive mechanism, a lever mecha-<br>
nism, a spindle drive mechanism, a hydraulic drive mechanism or a<br>
slotted link mechanism.<br><br>
