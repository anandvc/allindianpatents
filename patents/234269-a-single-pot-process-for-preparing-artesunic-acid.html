				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a single pot process for preparing artesunic acid from artemisinin. Artesunic acid is the 10 a-hemisuccinate ester of dihydroartcmisinin. Artesunic acid and artesunate are customary names for dihydroartemisinin hemisuccinate and its sodium salt, respectively.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Malaria is caused by protozoan parasites, notably Plasmodium falciparum. The range of drugs available in the market for prevention and treatment of malaria is limited, and there are problems of drug resistance. Artemisinin and its derivatives: artemether and arteether (oil soluble), artelinate and artesunate (water soluble), are a class of anti-malarial compounds derived from Artemisia annua which are now proving their promising activity and are being used for the treatment of uncomplicated/severe complicated/cerebral and multi drug resistant malaria. The chemistry and the anti-protozoal action of these compounds, described in the publications are listed as references cited.<br>
The water-insoluble artesunic acid is customarily administered orally in the form of tablets or rcctally in the form of suppositories, while the water- soluble artesunate is administered intravenously.<br>
Artesunic acid together with a number of other Cio-ester and Cio-ether derivatnes of dihydroartemisinin, were prepared for the first time by Chinese scientists at the end of 1979 to the beginning of 1980. Shaofeng et al. H Labeling of QHS Derivatives, Buil. Chin. Materia Medica 6 (4), 25-27 (1981) and Li et al., Synthesis of Ethers. Carboxyllc. esters and carbonates of Dihydroartemisinin, Acta Pharm. Sin 16(6), 429-39, 1981) describe the preparation of artesunic acid by acylation of dihydroartemisinin with succinic anhydride in pyridine. The above mentioned publications describe a general method for preparing various dihydroartemisinin do-esters and also provide a process for preparing artesunic acid in a yield of 60% by means of warming dihydroartemisinin and succinic anhydride-in pyridine at 30" C for 24 hours.<br><br>
Ying et al. in the Synthesis of some carboxylic esters and carbonates of<br>
Dihydroartemisinin by using 4-(N, N-Dimethylamino) pyridine as an active acylation<br>
catalyst, Acta Chim Sinica 40 (6), 557-561 982) proposed an improved version<br>
of the<br>
acyiation of dihydroartemisinin. The said publication described in detail with the aid<br>
of the preparation of dihydroartemisinin - 10-valerate the aforesaid process. In this<br>
process dihydroartimisinin was dissolved in 1,2-dichloroethane and treated with<br>
valeric anhydride, 4-(N, N-dimethylamino) pyridine and triethylamine, and the<br>
mixture was stirred at room temperature until dihydroartemisinin had been used up.<br>
The reaction mixture was then acidified with dilute hydrochloric acid and the aqueous<br>
phase was separated off. The oily residue, obtained after washing and drying the<br>
organic phase and distilling off the solvent, was purified by chromatography on silica<br>
gel using petroleum ether 60-80° C degree/ethyl acetate (10:1) as an eluent. The use of<br>
this procedure for the preparation of the artesunic acid from dihydroartemisinin with<br>
succinic anhydride and 4-(N, N-dimethylamino) pyridine afforded artesunic acid in a<br>
yield of 65% in 5 hours.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,654,446 granted to Ognyanov et al. titled "Process for preparation<br>
of Dihydroartemisinin Hemisuccinate (artesunic acid)", dated August 5, 1997 teaches<br>
a process for preparing CIQ a-artesunic acid by acylation of dihydroartemisinin with<br>
succinic anhydride, in the presence of trialkylamines and their mixture in a low<br>
boiling, neutral water miscible, inert organic solvent or solvent mixture at 20-60°C in<br>
0.5 hours and the artesunic acid is then isolated directly at pH 5 to 8 in 91.8 to 97.2%<br>
yield.<br>
The above mentioned methods carry some disadvantages being less cost effective and<br>
more time consuming as compared to the present invention it should be noted that all<br>
the above referenced methods require two separate steps to convert artemisinin into<br>
10-esters of dihydroartemisinin i.e. (a) reduction of artemisinin into<br>
dihydroartemisinin in the first pot following by isolation of dihydroartemisinin, and<br>
(b) esterification of dihydroartemisinin into different esters in the second pot.<br>
Further, solvent pyridine or 1,2 dichloroethane and catalyst, 4 (N, N-dimethylamino)<br>
pyridine used in these processes are not acceptable according to the health standard.<br>
Hence there is a need to provide a single step process that overcomes the above<br>
mentioned disadvantages.<br>
The present is able to overcome the shortcoming of the cited prior art processes being one pot conversion using artemisinin directly (rather than dihydroartemisinin as in above citations), using the process described at room temperature.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a single pot process for conversion of artemisinin to artesunic acid.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein reduction and esterification of artemisinin to obtain artesunic acid is carried out in a single pot.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a process wherein conversion of artemisinin to artesunic acid.is carried out at room temperature.<br>

avoids the process of isolation of dihydroartemisinin is avoided which saves<br>
chemicals, labour and losses of dihydroartemisinin in isolating it.<br>
2. Conversion of artemisinin into artesunic acid in one pot takes place in about 2-<br>
5 hours and is a less time consuming method as compared to previously<br>
reported methods in which conversion of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin<br>
in first pot followed by isolation of dihydroartemisinin and its esterification<br>
into artesunic acid in the second pot is also a long process.<br>
3. The conversion of artemisinin into artesunic acid in one pot is carried out at<br>
room temperature (20-35 degree C) and thereby avoids use of cooling unit.<br>
4. The solvent used to carry out the reduction reaction is also being used in<br>
esterification and thus enabling the process cost effective.<br>
5. The catalysts, polyhydroxy compound or cation exchange resin used to carry<br>
out the reduction of artemisinin into dihydroartemisinin at room temperature<br>
(20-35°C) are cost effective.<br>

in the range of 1:0.5 to 1:5.0 w/w to obtained solution in step(a), stirring the mixture at a temperature ranging between 20 to 35°C for about 0.5 h to 4 h to obtain the reduced product dihydroartemisinin,<br>
(c)	adding succinic anhydride and a base which is selected from the group consisting of triethylamine, sodium bicarbonate or anion exchange resm to the mixture of step (b) at a temperature ranging between 20 to 35°C .<br>
(d)	stirring cold water to the mixture of step(c) at a temperature ranging between 20 to 35 ° C for a period of 1 h to 3 h,<br>
  (e) adding cold water to the mixture of step (d), adjusting the pH of the solution between 5 to 7, extracting the solution of p H 5 to 7 with a mixture of 40% ethyl acetate and n-hexane, to avoid extraction of unwanted polar impurities and separating the organic layer,<br>
(0 washing the organic layer of step (e) with water, drying the washed<br>
organic layer over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtering, evaporating the organic layer to obtain a residue, and<br>
(g)  purifying the residue of step (f) over silica gel is in the range of 1:4 to 1:5 w/w column chromatography to obtain pure artesunic acid.<br><br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim J., wherein the two reactions, namely reduction of artemisinin to dihydroartemisinin and esterification of dihydroartemisinin are carried out in a single pot thereby avoiding the process of isolation of the intermediate dihydroartemisinin.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the polyhydroxy compound used is preferably dextrose.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the reducing agent used is preferably sodium borohydride.<br>
5.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein in step (c) succinic anhydride acts as an esterifying agent.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the w/w ratio of artemisinin and<br>
. succinic anhydride in the range of 1:0.3 to 1:0.7.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the w/w ratio of artemisinin and the base is in the range of 1:1.2 tol: 7.<br>
8.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein in step (e) the pH of the solution is adjusted between 6 to 7 by adding acetic acid.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein in step (g) the purification of crude artesunic acid is carried out over silica gel column.<br>
10.	A process as claimed in claim 11, wherein the silica gel column is eluted using a gradient solvent mixture of 20-30% ethyl acetate in n-hexane.<br><br>
11.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein 96% w/w artesunic acid is obtained.<br>
12.	A process as claimed in claim 1, wherein the time required for conversion of artemisinin into artesunic acid is about 6 h to 10 h.<br><br>
13.      A single pot process for preparing artesunic acid from artemisinin substantially as herein describe with refrences to examples accompanying this specilcuion.<br><br></td>
