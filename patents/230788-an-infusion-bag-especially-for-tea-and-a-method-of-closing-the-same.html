				<td>The invention concerns an infusion bag, especially for tea, which has a top pan with comers folded down and a middle part folded down over it, to which a string with two free ends is attached, which goes from one side of the top part, through a hole, forming a loop on the other side of the top part arid back, whereby the two free ends are pulled through the loop placed over the top edge of the infusion bag and are pulled to form a knot. The invention also concerns a method of closing an infusion bag, especially for tea, closed on top by comers folded down and then a middle part folded down, with a string, preferably having a tag on the other end, by means of two needles.<br>
It is known how to close infusion bags exclusively with a string. For this, the comers on top of the infusion bag are first folded down and then the middle part is folded over the folded down comers to make the closure of the infusion bag reliable. This closure is secured by a string that has several ways of being attached.<br>
In one known embodiment in German Utility Model 296 13 448, the string on the top part of the infusion bag is attached there by means of a separate attachment string. This connection between the end of the string and the infusion bag cannot withstand high stresses and is technically expensive.<br>
To create a simple way of attaching the string, it is known from EP 0 807 579 how to provide the folded top part with two recesses and place the infusion bag next to a tensed string in such a way that it runs at the height of the recesses and a tucking needle can be passed through each of the recesses, take the string and pull it through the recesses with both its ends. The free ends of the string pulled through the recesses in the infusion bag are attached to the tag, for example by welding or tacking. The disadvantage of this is that the attachment is loose and therefore not secure, and it is possible for the folded down areas on the top part to come unfolded, so the contents of the infusion bag can fall out or a loss of aroma and freshness can occur.<br>
EP 0 691 268 discloses a string closure in which a needle goes through a single hole in the top part of the infusion bag, grasps the string behind and pulls it through the hole, forming a noose, which is then used to make a knot. The disadvantage of this is that it does not make sure that the folded down corners and the middle of the top part folded down over it are grasped together and with the bag by the string connection<br>
and are connected by the knot formed. The closure itself is not secure enough during folding, perforating and stringing with high manufacturing precision.<br>
The problem of the invention is to provide a secure attachment between the folded down parts of an infusion bag and the bag itself with a string connection that can be made simply at a low technical cost and at high production speed.<br>
The invention solves the problem with an infusion bag of the type mentioned at the beginning that has two holes made in the top part at a lateral distance next to one another to the left and right of the longitudinal axis of the bag that grasp one folded corner and the middle of the top part; that the string forms a loop with one end that goes through one hole and the other end through the second hole; that the loop is placed over the top edge of the infusion bag and both ends of the string are passed from below through the loop forming a double knot. The loop is preferably made of crossed string parts laid one over another, whereby one short end and one long end of the string can be provided, especially for attaching a tag to the long end of the string, and whereby to increase the safety of the knot, the short end of the string in the preferred embodiment is arranged in the string parts of the loop criss-crossed over one another under the long end of the string on the wall of the bag. With the invention, the attachment of the folded down corners and the folded down middle part to one another and to the bag is secure, and production is simplified because the comparatively thick, and hence difficult to tool, middle longitudinal seam of conventional bags need not be pierced or perforated. The knots keep the connection itself from loosening by two holes spaced apart and separate ends of the string ends mat are doubled going through them, so that even if one end should come out of the loop, the knot through the second end of the string and the extra noose holds it secure.<br>
Developing the known method described at the beginning, the method of solving the problem in the invention is characterized by the fact that: the end of the string is looped through a recess in a holder; by the fact that the top part of the infusion bag is inserted into the holder and the string is looped around the top edge of the infusion bag; by the fact that the string is then grasped on its free end and on its long continuous end by two holes in the top part that go through the folded down parts and the free end, as well as the continuous part that first goes into a loop and is then pulled all the way out of the infusion bag; and by the fact that the noose is finally tightened by pulling, especially on the continuous part. To grasp the string, two needles are preferably used that go through the infusion bag under the closed part of the loop, whereby the holder can have guide holes for the needles. To pull the string through, it must be cut on the continuous part, before the needles are pulled back at the latest. That way, the continuous part forms one long end of string, which can be used to attach a tag.<br>
The method in the invention closes the folded down top part of the infusion bag exclusively using the string, and does not use extra string. The string is pulled through the top part of the infusion bag or pierces<br>
it with the needles, whereby the holder which is a gripper contains guide holes for the needles. The needles make only a simple motion to perforate the top part of the infusion bag, to allow a fast, simple sequence of movements. Previous perforation of the top part of the infusion bag is not essential. The top of the bag is securely closed by the two stitches to the right and left of the middle, whereby the folded down corners are also fixed. Attachment can be done in a continuous process at a calm machine pace and a high product count. The knot does not come loose due to the forces of friction even when slightly prestressed, i.e., when tightened loosely.<br>
The present invention relates to an infusion bag, especially for tea, which has a top part with folded down corners and a middle part folded over it, to which a string having two free ends is fastened, which goes from one side of the top part through a hole forming a loop on the other side of the top part and comes back, whereby the free ends are pulled from below through the loop laid over the top edge of the infusion bag and are pulled to form a knot, characterized in that in the top part, two holes are arranged at a lateral distance next to one another on the left and right of the longitudinal axis of the bag, each of which grasps a folded down corner and the middle part of the top part; by the fact that the string forms a loop with its one end and goes through the hole and with its other end through the second hole; by the fact that the loop is placed over the top edge of the infusion bag and both ends of the string run from below through the loop forming a double knot.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
With the invention, a method of closing an infusion bag with a string is created with simple technical equipment and high speed; this method will be described below with reference to the drawings using one example of embodiment.<br>
Fig. la	shows a perspective view of an infusion bag with folded down corners and the middle<br>
part folded down over it, plus the string closure;<br>
Fig. 1b	shows the infusion bag in Fig. la with an enlarged view of the string closure;<br>

Figs. 6a, 6b	show a side view and a top view of a tag and the other end of the string;<br>
Figs. 7a, 7b         show a corresponding side view and top view after the end of the string has been pulled through;<br>
Figs. 8a, 8b         show another side view and top view in which the string loop has been placed in the notch in the tag and<br>
Fig. 9a, 9b	show a side view and a top view of the string attached to the tag.<br>
In Fig.1c, the infusion bag shown in Figs, la to 1c is first closed on its top part 6 by folding down the corners la and Ib and then folding the middle part 1c over them, so that the substrate found inside the chamber, especially tea, cannot get out. Then the infusion bag 1 in Figs. 2a to 9b is provided with a string closure 7, whose construction can be inferred especially well from Fig. 1b. To make the string closure 7, on the top part 6, two holes 8 and 9 are made some distance apart laterally on the left and right of the longitudinal axis of the bag, each of which goes through one folded down corner la and Ib and the middle part Ic of the top part 6. To make this possible, according lo Fig. Ic, in the top part 6 of the infusion bag 1, a total of four recesses are provided on the as yet not folded down middle part Ic, which after the middle part Ic is folded down correspond to one another in pairs and form the holes 8 and 9 passing through the same axis.<br>
The string closure 7 also has a string 3, which forms a loop 3a with one end 3b through one hole 9 and the other end 3c of it through the second hole 8, whereby loop 3a is on the front of the bag 1 in the drawing, and ends 3b and 3c are on the back of the bag 1 in the drawing. The loop is placed over the top edge 10 of the infusion bag 1, and the two ends 3b and 3c of the string 3 are passed through the loop 3a from below. Pulling one or both ends of the string forms a double knot 11, which attaches corners la and Ib and the middle part Ic of the top 6 to one another and to the infusion bag in the closed position.<br>
It can also be seen from the drawing that loop 3a is made of crossed parts of string laid one over another, whereby the short end of the string 3b is arranged under the long end 3c of the string next to the wall of the bag in the criss-crossed string parts of the loop.<br>
To produce the closure described, the infusion bag 1 in Figs. 2a and 2b with its top part 6 closed is inserted in a recess 2a of a holder 2. Before that, a string 3 is laid over the recess 2a in the holder 2 in the form of a loop 3a, which can be best seen in Fig. 2b. The free end 3b of loop 3a here is put together with the continuous part 3c of the string 3 on the one side of the recess 2a, whereas the closed part of the loop 3a is on the other side of the recess 2a on the holder 2.<br>
As can best be inferred from Fig. 2a, the loop 3a is pressed through the top edge of the infusion bag 1 into recess 2a, so that it lies over the top edge.<br>
In Figs. 3a and 3b, two needles 4, which are shown in the starting position in Figs. 2a and 2b, go into the top part of the infusion bag under loop 3a. They grasp the free end 3b with their barb 4a (see Fig. 2a) on the bottom, on one hand, and part 3c of the continuous string 3, on the other, as shown in Figs. 3a and 3b.<br><br>
Now, when the needles 4 are pulled back into the starting position, as shown in Figs. 4a and 4b, they take the free end 3b, on one hand, and part of the continuous part 3c of the string 3 with them, as Fig. 4a and 4b show. While the free end 3b is pulled all the way out of the top part of the infusion bag 1, due to the withdrawal of the corresponding needle 4 a loop 3d is formed in the continuous part 3c of the string that is under the middle part of loop 3a. This situation is shown clearly in Fig. 4b.<br>
Now, to make a noose all around the top part of the infusion bag 1 with the ends of the string 3, as shown in Figs. 5a and 5b, it is still necessary to pull the continuous part 3c, hence the long end of the string 3 completely out of the infusion bag 1. This is done, for example, by moving the infusion bag 1 on, so that the remaining part of the continuous part 3c of the string 3 is pulled completely through loop 3a. By applying a certain tensile strength on the continuous part 3c of the string 3, the noose is finally tightened so the situation shown in Figs. 5a and 5b occurs.<br>
To attach a tag 5, shown in Figs. 6a to 9b, to the other end of the string 3, it is placed with its end 3e on one side of the tag 5, as in Figs. 6a and 6b. The tag 5 is pierced, preferably by means of a needle, in turn provided with a barb, and the end 3e of the string 3 is grasped. String end 3e is pulled through the tag 5 in the form of a loop 3f in Figs. 7a and 7b.<br>
This loop 3f is now grasped and placed in slits 5a, according to Figs. 8a and 8b, which are made on the edge of the tag.   That way, the closed part of loop 3f comes back to the same side of the tag 5, on which the end 3e of the string and the continuous part of the string 3 are found. This situation can best be seen in Fig. 9a.<br>
By pulling on the string 3, the tag 5 is looped around so that the situation shown in Fig. 9 occurs.<br>
As can be seen from the preceding explanation of both the closure of the top part of the infusion bag 1 and the attachment of a tag 5 to the two ends of a string 3, the noose is made on the infusion bag 1 or tag 5 in both cases by simple means, to produce a reliable closure of the infusion bag 1 and a reliable attachment of the tag 5.<br>
