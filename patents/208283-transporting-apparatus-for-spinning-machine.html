Transporting Apparatus for Spinning Machine<br>
The present invention concerns a transporting apparatus according to the introductory part of the independent claim.<br>
Transporting devices on modern spinning machines are used for transporting yarn packages to a neighbouring machine for further processing, e.g. to a winding machine, or to transfer them to a transporting device respectively, which is independent of the spinning machine. On the other hand yarn package support elements, especially bobbin tubes to be wound are to be supplied to the spinning machine.<br>
Preferentially devices are used for this purpose which operate all around the machine in which arrangement a traction means forming a closed loop is applied. A device of such type is described e.g. in the European Patent EP 0 450 661 (Object 820).<br>
Drive problems can arise concerning the traction means as the machine length is increased in case the drive means are driven at one point only. In a ring spinning machine equipped with more than one thousand spindles on which the traction means must transport a corresponding number of yarn packages slippage may occur between the traction means and a drive wheel. An increase in pre-tension can reduce the slippage, the life of the traction means however, is shortened.<br>
It is the goal of the present invention to lay out a transporting apparatus in such a manner that the load the traction means is subjected to is reduced, and that the traction means is carried on securely also if the drive means and the traction means engage under pressure merely (and not meshingly).<br>
This goal is achieved using an apparatus presenting the characteristics described in the first claim. The dependent claims concern an advantageous embodiment of the apparatus.<br><br>
The present invention is described in the following in more detail with reference to an illustration.<br>
The transporting apparatus is characterized in that at least two drive means are arranged at locations far distant from each other, in particular located at a head end part, and at a foot end part respectively, of the spinning machine, acting on the traction means.<br>
The traction means is deflected by 180° each using a deflecting means and the drive devices at each end of the machine.<br>
The traction means also can be deflected into the reverse direction of motion by one single wheel which is coupled to the drive device and the diameter of which is larger than the width of the spinning machine and which is arranged at an end of the machine. An extracting station or an insertion station can be provided directly adjacent to a deflecting element or a drive device.<br>
The traction means preferentially is laid out as a steel tape which in the zone of a head end portion or a foot end portion of the spinning machine each is guided on rubber coated wheels one of which is the drive wheel of a drive device each.<br>
A drive device can be arranged on a carriage shiftable along a guide extending in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine and coupled to a shifting mechanism.<br>
The motors of the drive device are provided with a control device, in particular with a frequency control device, in which arrangement the motors can be supplied with a current of variable frequency under identical conditions.<br>
In the Figure a schematic view is shown of a design example of the present invention on a ring spinning machine 10 provided on both longitudinal sides with a great number of spinning positions 54 arranged in interconnected sections 12. At one end of the spinning machine a head portion 16 is arranged<br><br>
and at the other end a toot portion 18 is arranged, i nese pottons OT Tne spinning machine contain among other items motors gear arrangements control arrangements and a suction arrangement. Along the spinning positions a traction means 14 extends on which carrier elements 26 are arranged supported by a rail 27. The carrier elements 26 are used for carrying support members 24 with yarn packages along a path 22. The traction means 14 is deflected in the zone of the head portion 16 or of the foot portion 18 by deflecting elements 36', 36", as well as at the opposite end of the spinning machine 10 is deflected by deflecting elements 46', 46", in particular wheels, the deflection at each end being 180°. Said wheels in the design example shown are rotating clockwise in order to transfer the support members 24 with yarn packages from the path 22' shown in the Figure as the lower path to the upper path 22 vie a deflection path 20 and to transfer them at the right hand side end of the path 22 via a second curved deflection path 28 to a first transporting means 56 in which arrangement the support members 52 with yarn packages are extracted at an extraction station 30 from the carrier elements 26 and are shifted onto the transporting means 56, preferentially formed by a transporting belt. From a second transporting means 58, laid out in analogy to the transporting means 56, but driven in the opposite direction, support members 50 with tubes are supplied to the spinning machine 10 where at an insertion station 31 they are coupled to the traction means 14 using the carrier elements 26. A third deflection path 48 supports the support members 50 with tubes on their way to the lower path 22. After completion of yarn packages on the spinning machine 10 the traction means 14 is set into motion in such a manner that all support members 24 with yarn packages are transported away from the spinning machine 10 and simultaneously new support members 50 with tubes are brought to the spinning positions 54. The traction means, as mentioned in the claims, is set into motion by two drive devices 36, 46 distant far apart from each other, via e.g. a wheel 46", a gear<br><br>
arrangement 44 and a motor 42. As can be seen from the Figure the drive device 36, 46 is arranged in the zone of the head portion 16, or of the foot portion 18 respectively. For pre-tensioning the traction means 14, which preferentially is laid out as a steel tape, e.g. the drive device 36 with a deflection element 36' (or wheel respectively) is arranged on a carriage 60 which is guided along a guide element 34 movable in the longitudinal direction of the spinning machine 10. A shifting device 40 subjects the traction means to a predetermined tension generated by spring load. The wheels 36', 36" can be supported in bearings mounted onto the carriage 60 in which arrangement a holder 62 arranged between a bearing 64' and the first deflection path 20 ensures that independently of the current position of the carriage 60 relative to the spinning machine 10 the first deflection path 20 always is located at the same distance from the drive device 36.<br>
Preferentially the drive device 36 comprises a large wheel 36a the dimensions of which are chosen in such a manner that the traction means 14 in the zone of the head portion 16 without using further deflecting means is guided along the spinning machine 10 in such a manner that the distance between the spinning positions 54 and the carrier elements 26, and the support members 24 respectively, is maintained constant. The large wheel 36a (indicated with broken lines) thus replaces the smaller wheels 36* and 36".<br>
The wheels 36", and 46" respectively, of the drive devices 36, 46 are arranged within the top projection outline of the head portion 16,or the foot portion respectively, of the spinning machine 10.<br>
The drive devices 36, 46 preferentially each are composed of a motor (asynchronous motor or synchronous motor) 64, 42, a gear box 39, 44 attached thereto and of a friction drive wheel, or a belt pulley respectively, 36", 46", in particular coated with rubber at its circumference. The motors 64, 42 are coordinated with a control device 18', in particular with a frequency control<br><br>
device or an inverter, and thus are rotating at the same rotational speed under identical load conditions.<br>
The arrows not designated specifically in the Figure indicate the directions of movement of the transporting elements.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
