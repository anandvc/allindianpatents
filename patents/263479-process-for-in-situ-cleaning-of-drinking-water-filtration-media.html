				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002! Tne present invention is generally directed toward a cleaning process-<br>
More specifically, the present invention is directed toward a process for cleaning granular<br>
water filtration media, such as various types of sand, anthracite coal or activated carbon,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Filtration is an essential step in the treatment of drinking and industrial<br>
water supplies, Filtration is carried out to remove contaminants which are either<br>
introduced with the source water or are produced during the treatonent process and which<br>
can affect water quality. Most commonly large-scale filtration involves passing the water<br>
either through granular filter media, such as various types of sand, anthracite coal,<br>
granular activated carbon or combinations thereof arranged in layers in a filter media Ded.<br>
[0004] Contaminants removed during filtration accumulate within a granular filter<br>
media bed. Over time, this accumulation leads to increased filter backpressure<br>
(measured by increased head loss), increased turbidity of the low-through or in the worst<br>
case scenario, to breakthrough of contaminants, Regular backwashing is used to remove<br>
accumulated filtrate in an effort to maintain filter performance and capacity.<br>
[0005] However, like every surface in contact with water, fitter media particles will<br>
over time accumulate deposits of biological and non-biological material which cannot be<br>
removed by backwashing and can significantly interfere with the filter's function. Thus, it<br>
is important to dean the filter bed not only of the loose particles removable by<br>
backwashing but also of these surface deposits.<br>
[0000| Depending on the water source and environmental conditions, these<br>
surface deposits on the fitter particles, can consist predominantly of organic matter<br>
(biofilm), metal oxides, or calcium carbonate scale. Heavy fouling or scaling will<br>
eventually reduce fitter performance. The consequences can be higher backwash<br>
frequency, reduced flow-rates, increased water turbidity, breakthrough of contaminants or<br>
a combination of these effects. If the deposits are not removed, the filter performance will<br>
decline below tolerable levels and filter media exchange becomes necessary.<br>
[0007] However, an exchange of the filtration media is very expensive in terms of<br>
filtration media and downtime cost and may not be a practical maintenance solution for<br>
water treatment installations which are exclusive to a number of consumers and have<br>
only a single filtration bed. Thus, maintenance procedures allowing for the cleaning of the<br>
filtration media as an alternative replacement are required.<br>
[0008] Mechanical methods of filtration media cleaning include filter bed aeration<br>
during backwash and spraying water on top of the filter bed to disperse soft aggregates.<br>
This does not remove persistent surface deposits such as biofilm and scale. Chemical<br>
treatments include washing the media in strong acids and bases, sometimes in<br>
combination with surfactants. These chemical treatments can be satisfactory for certain<br>
types of contamination, such as calcium carbonate scale. However, mixed deposits,<br>
which include metal oxides and biological films, are either not removed efficiently or<br>
require highly corrosive and hazardous cleaning agents which are difficult to use and may<br>
leave residue not acceptable in drinking water processing installations. This generates a<br>
need for alternative cleaning procedures, and products, which are sufficiently efficient and<br>
convenient to present an alternative to media replacement.<br>
[0009] Prior art filtration media cleaning methods of the chemical treatment type<br>
generally include the steps of applying an aqueous solution of a strong acid or base to the<br>
filtration media. However, the treatment liquid flows through the filtration media too<br>
quickly for the cleaning reaction to be completed. Therefore, the treatment liquid must be<br>
applied repeatedly, requiring vast amounts of treatment liquid, or the treatment liquid<br>
must be circulated through the filtration media until the clearing reaction is completed,<br>
requiring specialized and expensive circulation equipment. These approaches, although<br>
an alternative to extended plant shut-down for filter media replacement, do not offer an<br>
economical alternative to filter media replacement.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] It is an object of the present invention to provide an efficient and<br>
economical alternative to the prior art filtration media cleaning methods and products. The<br>
present invention provides a product and process for the removal of surface deposits<br>
from granular filter media. More particularly, the invention provides a product and<br>
process for the in-situ cleaning of filter media used in drinking water treatment systems,<br>
especially a product and process which is NSF certified for such use.<br>
{0011J In a preferred embodiment, the invention is directed toward a cleaning<br>
process for the cleaning of all types of granular water filtration media, such as sand,<br>
gravel, manganese greensand, anthracite coal, granular activated carbon (GAC), and ion<br>
exchange media or ceramic beads.<br>
[0012] The invention preferably provides a process for the in-siiu cleaning of<br>
water filtration media contained within a filtration bed. The preferred process includes the<br>
steps of applying a granular cleaner onto the filtration media while the media is located<br>
within the filtration bed and applying an activator compound thereafter for activation of the<br>
cleaning composition. The granular cleaner reacts in conjunction with the activator<br>
resulting in the cleaning of the media. After the cleaning has occurred, the residual<br>
cleaner and activator are washed away in a rinsing step along with any suspended and<br>
dissolved contamination which was removed from the filtration media. The granular<br>
cleaner is preferably wetted after application to dissolve the cleaner and initiate the<br>
cleaning reaction.<br>
[0013] The activator can be applied in granular or liquid form. Preferably, the<br>
activator is applied as an aqueous solution. In a variant of the preferred embodiment of<br>
the process, the steps of applying the activator and wetting the cleaner are combined by<br>
applying the activator in aqueous solution.<br>
[0014] In another preferred embodiment, the process includes the further steps of<br>
draining the water filtration bed prior to applying the granular cleaner. Preferably, the step<br>
of wetting the granular cleaner is carried out by spraying water onto the cleaner or by<br>
filling the filtration bed with water until the cleaner is submerged. The step of rinsing the<br>
water filtration bed is preferably conducted through backwashing said filtration bed. The<br>
process preferably includes the further step of allowing the chemical reaction to proceed<br>
for at least 1 hour prior to rinsing the filtration bed. The rinsing step is preferably delayed<br>
until the dissolved cleaner has reached a bottom of the filtration bed.<br>
[0015] In a further preferred embodiment, the process includes the additional<br>
steps of determining the degree of surface contamination of the filtration media and<br>
calculating the amount of granular cleaner to be applied for insuring removal of the<br>
surface contaminants. The determination of the degree of contamination preferably<br>
includes the steps of taking a representative core sample from the filtration media, the<br>
sample having a known volume, and the step of calculating the amount of cleaner<br>
includes the steps of measuring the amount of cleaner required for removal of the surface<br>
contaminants from the filtration media in the sample and extrapolating to the whole<br>
filtration bed by multiplying the measured amount of cleaner by the ratio of filtration bed<br>
volume/sample volume.<br>
[0016] In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the granular<br>
cleaner includes an acid component for dissolving scale and metal oxides on and<br>
removing biodeposits from the filtration media and optionally at least one component<br>
selected from the group of a free flow additive for preventing clumping of the cleaner, a<br>
surfactant for enhancing contact of the cleaner with the filtration medfa, an inhibitor for<br>
protecting exposed metal surfaces from corrosion by the acid component, and a dye The<br>
cleaner is preferably in the form of a free-flowing powder with a particle size of s O.Smm<br>
for easy spreading of the cleaner on the filtration media,<br>
[0017] In a preferred embodiment of the cleaner, the acid component is sulfamic<br>
acid. In another preferred embodiment, the granular cleaner includes at least one<br>
additional component selected from the group of citric acid, phosphoric acid, corrosion<br>
inhibitor, free-flow additive and surfactant. Preferably the granular cleaner includes the<br>
 [0018] In the process above, the activator used is an activated oxygen donor, For<br>
the purpose of this disclosure, the term activated oxygen donor defines compounds which<br>
in aqueous solution decompose to generate oxygen radicals. Numerous activated oxygen<br>
donors of this type are known and need not be listed in detail. The activated oxygen<br>
donor is preferably selected from peroxides, most preferably hydrogen peroxide,<br>
peracetic acid, precursors of peroxides, hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid and<br>
combinations thereof. The activator is most preferably either 5-50% hydrogen peroxide,<br>
or 0.2 - 10% peracetic acid, or a combination of hydrogen peroxide and peracetic acid,<br>
with the balance being water.<br>
[0019] In a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the activator<br>
can be in a liquid or dry state prior to its introduction into the filtration bed.<br>
[0020] In a further preferred embodiment, the invention provides a granular<br>
cleaner composition, comprising a granular cleaner as defined above and an activated<br>
oxygen donor as defined above.<br>
[0021] In another preferred embodiment of the process of the invention, the<br>
rinsing step is preferably carried out by a backwashing procedure.<br>
[0022] Further objects and features of the present invention will be apparent to<br>
those skilled in the art upon reference to the accompanying drawings and upon reading<br>
the following description of the preferred embodiments.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
(0029] Before explaining the present invention in detail, it is to be understood that<br>
the invention is not limited to the preferred embodiments contained herein. The invention<br>
is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or carried out in a variety of<br>
ways. It is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein are<br>
for the purpose of description and not of limitation.<br>
[0030] FIG, 1 is a schematic flow diagram of a preferred embodiment of a process<br>
in accordance with the invention for the cleaning of water filtration media 110 contained<br>
within a filtration bed 114 (see Fig. 4). In this embodiment, the process includes a first<br>
application step 20 in which a granular cleaner is applied to the water filtration media<br>
while the media is located within the filtration bed. In a wetting step 22, the granular<br>
cleaner is wetted with an aqueous medium to dissolve the cleaner and promote its<br>
vertical spread through the filtration media during the ensuing cleaning reaction.<br>
Thereafter, an activator is applied onto the granular cleaner in a third application step 30<br>
In a reaction step 40, the cleaner chemically reacts in conjunction with the activator<br>
resulting in the cleaning of the media. The duration of reaction step 40 varies depending<br>
on the degree of contamination of the media. However, the reaction step 40 is preferably<br>
carried out for at least one hour, preferably the reaction step is conducted over night.<br>
Most preferably, the reaction step 40 is carried out until the dissolved cleaner has<br>
reached a bottom of the filtration bed and the filtration media is completely cleaned. The<br>
point in time at which the filtration media is completely cleaned can be determined by<br>
visual inspection to check for any foaming which would indicate an ongoing cleaning<br>
reaction and/or by measuring the supernatant pH or metal content.<br>
[0031] The inventors of the present process surprisingly discovered that the<br>
automatic gradual advancement of the dissolved cleaner through the filtration media in<br>
combination with the even spreading of the cleaner on the top surface of the filtration bed<br>
completely obviates the need for circulation or re-circulation of the dissolved cleaner to<br>
ensure an even distribution of the dissolved cleaner during the reaction step. Agitation of<br>
the filtration bed during cleaning is also neither necessary nor desirable with the process<br>
in accordance with the invention. This provides the process of the current invention with<br>
significant economical and practical advantages.<br>
[0032] After the cleaning step 40, any residual granular cleaner and activator are<br>
washed away along with the suspended and dissolved contamination which was removed<br>
from the water filtration media by rinsing the filtration media with water in a rinsing step<br>
50. The rinsing step can be carried out by spraying water onto the filtration media or by<br>
backwashing the filter bed. Backwashing is the preferred method of rinsing the filtration<br>
media. The rinsing step 50 is best carried out until all residual cleaner and activator and<br>
all dissolved and suspended contaminants such as scale, metal oxides and biocontaminants<br>
have been removed. Completion of the rinsing step 50 can be determined<br>
by monitoring the turbidity, pH and dissolved metal content of the backwash water, for<br>
example. Since the filtration bed is not disturbed during the cleaning step, no settling<br>
period is required and the filtration bed can be returned to production after the rinsing<br>
step, the same as after a regular backwash cycle, providing the process of the invention<br>
with yet another advantage over prior art processes involving agitation of the filtration<br>
media during cleaning.<br>
[0033] In the first application step 20, the granular cleaner is preferably evenly<br>
spread on the top layer of the filtration media to promote an even distribution and<br>
concentration of the dissolved cleaner during the reaction step 40. In the wetting step 30,<br>
the filtration bed is filled with water until all the filter material is submerged. This can be<br>
done by initiating a slow backwash flow until the desired water level is reached. The<br>
backwash flow should be maintained sufficiently low to avoid agitation of the filter bed and<br>
mixing of the granular cleaner with the filter material. For filters with very light filter<br>
material which may be easily agitated by backwashing. the wetting step is preferably<br>
carried out by spraying water onto the cleaner.<br>
[0034] An even wetting of the cleaner over the whole area of the filtration media<br>
top surface is desirable in order to achieve an even dissolution and concentration of the<br>
cleaner throughout. The same applies for the activator, which is preferably evenly spread<br>
on the granular cleaner to ensure the same ratio of cleaner to activator throughout the<br>
filtration bed during the reaction step 40, The activator can be applied in granular or liquid<br>
form. When the activator is applied in granular form, the cleaner and activator may be<br>
mixed prior to application to produce a granular cleaner composition, which allows for the<br>
combination of the first and third application steps 20 and 30 into a single application step<br>
for the application of the cleaner composition. However, in the most preferred<br>
embodiment of the process, the activator is applied as an aqueous solution, which allows<br>
the compression of the steps of applying the activator and wetting the cleaner into a<br>
single second application step. In another preferred embodiment of the process of the<br>
invention the filtration bed is completely drained prior to the granular cleaner application<br>
step 20.<br>
[0035] The rinsing step 50 is preferably conducted through backwashing of the<br>
filtration bed.<br>
[0036] A further preferred embodiment of the process of the invention as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 2 includes an analysis step 10 for determining the degree of surface<br>
contamination of the filtration media and a calibration step 12 for calculating the amount<br>
of granular cleaner to be applied for ensuring that the whole filtration media are exposed<br>
to unreacted cleaner during the cleaning step 40. The analysis step 10 preferably<br>
includes the step of taking a representative core sample from the filtration media, the<br>
sample having a known volume, while the calibration step 12 preferably includes the<br>
steps of first measuring the amount of cleaner required for substantially complete removal<br>
of the surface contaminants from the filtration media in the sample and then extrapolating<br>
to the amount required for the whole filter bed by multiplying the measured amount of<br>
cleaner by the ratio of filtration bed volume/sample volume. Preferably, the core sample is<br>
taken in an area of maximum or at least average contamination and represents a<br>
cylindrical sample extending from the top to the bottom of the filtration bed. Adjusting the<br>
amount of cleaner used to the respective contamination conditions provides the process<br>
of the invention with a significant economical advantage, since substantially no excess<br>
cleaner will be used, reducing the cost of the cleaning materials as well as the cost of<br>
disposing any unreacted cleaner and activator. Furthermore, less backwashing is<br>
required, reducing the time required for the rinsing step 50 and, thus, the overall cleaning<br>
process. This is very important to the operator of drinking water treatment facilities who is<br>
desirous to achieve the shortest down times possible.<br>
[0037] The granular cleaner of a preferred embodiment of the invention includes<br>
an acid component for dissolving scale and metal oxides on and removing biodeposits<br>
from the filtration media; and at least one additional component selected from the group<br>
of a free flow additive for preventing clumping of the cleaner, a surfactant for reducing<br>
surface tension and enhancing contact of the cleaner with the filtration media, an inhibitor<br>
for protecting exposed metal surfaces from corrosion by the acid component, and a<br>
coloring agent.<br>
[0038] The acid component of the preferred granular cleaner is either sutfamic<br>
acid or a combination of a major amount of sulfamic acid with a minor amount of a<br>
granular acid, such as phosphoric acid, sodium bisutfate, or citric acid. The acid<br>
component is preferably substantially free of hydrochloric acid, in the preferred<br>
embodiment, the additional components are at least one of citric acid, phosphoric acid,<br>
corrosion inhibitor, free-flow additive and surfactant.<br>
[0039] Numerous free flow additives applicable for use in the granular cleaner of<br>
the present invention are commercially available. However, it is preferable to use inert<br>
free flow additives. Free flow additives preferred for use in a granular cleaner of the<br>
invention are fumed silicas which adsorb to the cleaner particles to inhibit clumping and<br>
are NSF certifiable for use in drinking water processing installations,<br>
[0040] Surfactants useful for inclusion in a granular cleaner in accordance with<br>
the invention can be selected for the group of anionic, cationic, non-ionic and amphoteric<br>
surfactants in granular form. Useful anionic surfactants include, by way of non-limiting<br>
example, alkali metal salts, ammonium salts, amine salts, aminoalcohol salts, fatty acid<br>
salts. Particularly preferred surfactants are isopropanol and isobutanol. Surfactants<br>
which are NSF certifiable for use in drinking water processing installations are preferred.<br>
[0041] Corrosion inhibitors useful for inclusion in a granular cleaner in accordance<br>
with the invention can be selected from the group of nitrogen containing organic<br>
compounds, such as amines, quaternary ammonium compounds, heterocyclic nitrogen<br>
compounds, urea, thiourea, amide, or mixtures thereof. The most preferred inhibitors are<br>
Inhibitor 60S, commercially available from Thoma, Inc. and Rodine 102, from Parker<br>
Amchem,<br>
[0042] Numerous coloring agents useful for inclusion in the granular cleaner of<br>
the invention are commercially available. The preferred coloring agent is a dye<br>
commercially available under the name Phylam Acid Red LX-6515 from Phylam<br>
Chemicals.<br>
[0043] In the process above, the activator used is an activated oxygen donor,<br>
preferably selected from hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, precursors of hydrogen<br>
peroxide and peracetic acid and combinations thereof. Examples of granular precursors<br>
of activated oxygen donors are sodium percarbonate and BSC 8080, available from<br>
Buckman Laboratories. The activator is preferably either 5-50% hydrogen peroxide, <br>
- 10% peracetic acid with the balance being water. The activator can be in a liquid or dry<br>
state prior to its introduction into the filtration bed.<br>
[0044] The cleaner in accordance with the invention preferably includes the<br>
following components at the indicated amounts:<br>
As will be readily understood from the indicated volume ranges, all components having a<br>
volume range with a lower value of 0 are optional components.<br>
[0045] The mineral or organic acid components of the granular cleaner<br>
composition of the invention are present in their respective crystalline form.<br>
{0046] Although the granular cleaner composition is preferably in the form of a<br>
free-flowing powder with a particle size of s 0.5mm for ease of spreading of the cleaner<br>
on the filtration media, the granular cleaner may also be in the form of compressed pellets<br>
or granules, especially for application in the form of a slurry, as will be described in more<br>
detail further below.<br>
[0047] Exemplary formulations illustrating preferred embodiments of the above<br>
general cleaner formulation are described in detail in the following:<br>
 [0048] The constituents of the granular cleaners described herein are known in<br>
the art and are commercially available from various sources including those described in<br>
McCutcheon's Functional Materials (Vol.2), North American Edition, 1991; and in Kirk-<br>
Othmer, Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd edition, Vol. 22, the contents of which<br>
are herein incorporated by reference. For any particular cleaner, the optional components<br>
used should be compatible with all other ingredients included in the cleaner.<br>
[0049] As shown in FIG. 4, the granular cleaner 100 in a preferred embodiment of<br>
the process of the invention is spread evenly on the top surface 112 of the filtration media<br>
110 in the filtration bed 114 during the first application step 10 (see FIG. 1). The cleaner<br>
100 is wetted to achieve dissolution of the cleaner. The activator 116 is then evenly<br>
spread on top of the cleaner 100 either in granular or liquid form. The dissolved cleaner<br>
and the activator together move downward through the filtration bed 114. This generates<br>
a moving cleaning front 120 of concentrated acid and activator as shown in FIG. 5 which<br>
illustrates the filtration bed 114 during the reaction step 40 (see FIG. 1). The cleaning<br>
front 120 is the front edge of the dissolved cleaner/activator mixture. The cleaning front<br>
120 normally advances through the filtration bed 114 at a constant speed which is<br>
dependent on the type and particle size of the filtration media 110, the degree of media<br>
contamination and the cleaning chemical dosage. In stratified filter beds including several<br>
strata of different filtration media, the speed of advance of the cleaning front 120 may<br>
change from one stratum to the next, again depending on the properties of the filtration<br>
media in the adjacent strata. Not only will the cleaning front 120 and, thus, the dissolved<br>
cleaner 100 and the activator 116, automatically move through the filtration bed 114, the<br>
even application of both together with the movement of the mixture around the filtration<br>
media particles ensures an even concentration and admixture of both components.<br>
Furthermore, the advancement of the cleaning front 120 is slowed sufficiently by the<br>
friction created during movement of the mixture though the filtration bed 114 to achieve<br>
more than sufficient residence time of the mixture on the filtration media particles to<br>
ensure a full cleaning thereof. Moreover, any unreacted mixture will continue to move<br>
downward until it comes in contact with a contaminated filtration media surface or the<br>
filtration bed 114 is completely cleaned. This provides several significant advantages over<br>
the prior art. The circulation equipment required with the prior art cleaning processes<br>
using liquid cleaning compositions to ensure complete spread of the cleaner and<br>
sufficient residence time is obviated with the process of the present invention, resulting in<br>
a significant economical advantage. Significant overdosing of the cleaning compounds as<br>
required in the prior art cleaning processes to ensure all contamination is removed is not<br>
necessary with the process of the invention, since alt of the cleaning mixture will 'drain1<br>
from the filtration bed, which means it will automatically move through the whole bed and<br>
can get used up completely. Additional advantages of the present method over the prior<br>
art are a minimized corrosion of metal parts and minimized formation of hazardous<br>
fumes.<br>
[0050] For large filtration beds, where it may be difficult to reach all locations of<br>
the bed's top surface, It may be challenging to spread the granular cleaner or granular<br>
cleaner composition in a dry form as described above. In those situations, the granular<br>
cleaner can be applied to the filtration media in the form of a slurry. The slurry is prepared<br>
by mixing the dry granular cleaner or cleaner composition with approximately the same<br>
volume of water at a mixing station 200 (see Fig.5} and then spread on the top surface of<br>
the filtration bed by way of a pressure pump 210 connected to the mixing station 200,<br>
delivery hoses 220 emanating from the pump 210 and an optional spreader nozzle 230.<br>
The granular cleaner shipping containers can be used as the mixing station 220 by filling<br>
the containers with water to the top. Various types of slurry mixing and pumping<br>
equipment are commercially available and need not be described in more detail herein.<br>
[0051] While the invention has been described with a certain degree of<br>
particularity, it is understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments set forth<br>
herein for purposes of exemplification, but is to be limited only by the scope of the<br>
attached claims or including the full range of equivalency to which each element thereof is<br>
entitled.<br>
[0052] The above-described embodiments of the present invention are intended<br>
to be examples only. Alterations, modifications and variations may be effected to the<br>
particular embodiments by those of skill in the art without departing from the scope of the<br>
invention, which is defined solely by the claims appended hereto.<br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.        A   process for removing surface contaminants from water filtration media<br>
contained in a water filtration bed, comprising the steps of:<br>
applying a granular cleaner onto said water filtration bed;<br>
wetting the granular cleaner for permitting the granular cleaner to dissolve and being vertically moved through the filtration media;<br>
applying an active oxygen donor activator to said water filtration bed for initiating a chemical reaction between the granular cleaner, the activator and the surface contaminants on the water Filtration media; and<br>
rinsing the filtration bed with water for removing residua! granular cleaner and residual activator along with suspended and dissolved contamination from the water filtration media.<br>
