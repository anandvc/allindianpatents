CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Serial No. 60/500,770, filed September 4, 2003, and assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION [0002] The present invention relates to processing image data, more specifically a method of processing image data in the transform domain after extracting data based on desired level resolution and desired level of quality.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Typically, digital information is compressed using a pre-selected format or a process by an encoder. However, conventional digital consumer formats such as High Definition Television (HDTV), Digital Versatile Disc or Video Disc (DVD), Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), Digital Satellite System (DSS) operate at various desired levels of resolution, frame rates and/or bit rates and desired levels of quality. Also, non-standard resolutions, may be used by mobile devices wherein the resolution based on screen size of user defined resolutions. Accordingly, in order to cater to multiple desired levels of resolution and desired levels of quality on image, various techniques must be developed.<br>
[0004] Therefore there is a need for a more versatile, simple and/or efficient system that can generate multiple descriptions of video without loosing quality.<br>
SUMMARY [0005] Accordingly, disclosed embodiments herein address the above stated needs by providing a method for an electronic device that extracts encoded data based on desired level of resolution and desired level of quality, and sub-samples the extracted data in the transformed domain, thereby allowing greater flexibility without loosing quality.<br><br><br>
 [0006] In an embodiment, an apparatus, such as a server or a base transmitter operable in wireless or wired communication system, encompasses a method of receiving a bit-stream, extracting data from the bit-stream based on one or more criteria and sub-sampling (for example, filtering and decimating) the extracted data. The server may either store the data for future transmission or transmit the data to one or more connected devices, such as a mobile terminal or a fixed terminal. [0007] In an embodiment, an apparatus, such as mobile terminal or fixed terminal operable in wireless or wired communication system, encompasses a method of receiving a bit-stream, extracting data from the bit-stream based on one or more criteria and sub-sampling (for example, filtering and decimating) the extracted data. The apparatus may complete processing the sub-sampled data and display the image on a display.<br>
[0008] A more complete appreciation of all the advantages and scope of the invention can be obtained from the accompanying drawing, the description and the appended claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
[0014] Generally, embodiments described below allow a compressed bit-stream to be extracted and sub-sampled in the transform domain. In the following description, specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the embodiments may be practiced without these specific detail. For example, circuits may be shown in<br><br>
block diagrams in order not to obscure the embodiments in unnecessary detail. In other instances, well-known circuits, structures and techniques may be shown in detail in order not to obscure the embodiments.<br>
[0015] Embodiments may be described as a process which is depicted as a flowchart, a flow diagram, a structure diagram, or a block diagram. Although a flowchart may describe the operations as a sequential process, many of the operations can be performed in parallel or concurrently. In addition, the order of the operations may be re-arranged. A process is terminated when its operations are completed. A process may correspond to a method, a function, a procedure, a subroutine, a subprogram, etc. When a process corresponds to a function, its termination corresponds to a. return of the function to the calling function or the main function.<br>
[0016] Moreover, as disclosed herein, the term "video" refers to the visual portion of multimedia and will be used interchangeably with the term "image." A storage medium may represent one or more devices for storing data, including read only memory (ROM), random access memory (RAM), magnetic disk storage mediums, optical storage mediums, flash memory devices and/or other machine readable mediums for storing information. The term "machine readable medium" includes, but is not limited to portable or fixed storage devices, optical storage devices, wireless channels and various other mediums capable of storing, containing or carrying instruction(s) and/or data.<br>
[0017] An input video or image data stream is typically composed of image frames. An image frame can generally be divided into slices, a slice can be divided into data blocks, and a data block can be divided into pixels which are the smallest units of an image. Each image frame comprises an integer number of slices and each image slice represents the image information for a set of 16 consecutive scan lines. In such case, each data block corresponds to a 16x16 pixel block across the image of the frame. Also, a frame may be separated into even and odd slices, thereby forming even half frame and odd half frame. A frame an also be separated into various predetermined sizes without departing from the invention. In one embodiment, half frames are the fundamental packets of compressed data information that are processed by a decoder. Moreover, an image pixel can be commonly represented in the Red, Green and Blue (RGB) color component system. However, because the human eye is more sensitive to changes in luminance and less sensitive to changes in chrominance, the YCbCr color space is typically used in video compression to represent image pixels. The YCbCr color space<br><br>
is a linear transformation of the RGB components, where Y is the luminance component, and Cb and Cr are the color components. If a frame is separated into even/odd frames, there would be three even half frames and three odd half frames corresponding to the components Y, Cb and Cr.<br>
[0018] In the description above, a slice can represent a set of consecutive scan lines other than 16-consecutive scan lines. Also, a different color space with the same or different number of color components may be used to represent an image pixel in accordance with the invention.<br>
[0019] Furthermore, compression techniques typically are based on a discrete cosine transform (DCT) in which the size of each data block is fixed. Alternatively, any reversible orthogonal transform like the integer transform can be used. One dynamic image compression technique capable of offering significant compression while . preserving the quality of image signals utilizes adaptively sized blocks and sub-blocks of encoded DCT coefficient data. This technique will hereinafter be referred to as the adaptive block size discrete cosine transform (ABSDCT). The adaptive block sizes are chosen to exploit redundancy that exists for information within a frame of image data. The technique is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,021,891, entitled "Adaptive Block Size Image Compression Method And System." DCT techniques are also disclosed in U.S. .Pat. No. 5,107,345, entitled "Adaptive Block Size Image Compression Method And System," and the use of the ABSDCT technique in combination with a Discrete Quadtree Transform technique is discussed in U.S. Pat No. 5,452,104, entitled "Adaptive Block Size Image Compression Method And System." The systems disclosed in these patents utilize intraframe encoding, wherein each frame of an image sequence is encoded without regard to the content of any other frame.<br>
[0020] Figures 1A and IB show adaptively sized blocks and sub-blocks for adaptive block size discrete cosine transfonn. Generally, each of the luminance and chrominance components is passed to a block interleaver (not shown). A 16x16 block is presented to the block interleaver, which orders the image samples within the 16x16 blocks to produce blocks and composite sub-blocks of data for DCT analysis. Figure 1A shows an example, where one 16x16 DCT is applied to a first ordering, four 8x8 DCTs are applied to a second ordering, 16 4x4 DCTs are applied to a third ordering, and 64 2x2 DCTs are applied to a fourth ordering. The DCT operation reduces the spatial redundancy inherent in the image source. After the DCT is performed, most of the image signals energy tends to be concentrated in a few DCT coefficients.<br><br>
 [0021] For the 16x16 block and each sub-block, the transformed coefficients are analyzed to determine the number of bits required to encode the block or sub-block. Then, the block or the combination of sub-blocks, which requires the least number of bits to encode is chosen to represent the image segment. Figure IB shows an example where two 8x8 sub-blocks, six 4x4 sub-blocks, and eight 2x2 sub-blocks are chosen to represent the image segment. The chosen block or combination of sub-blocks is then properly arranged in order. The DCT coefficient values may then undergo further processing such as, but not limited to quantization and variable length coding. [0022] For purposes of explanation, the transform based compression system for generating multiple descriptions or layers of compressed data will be discussed with reference to ABSDCT algorithm. However, it would be apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is not limited to the use of ABSDCT. Other mathematical transforms such as, for example, DCT, Hadamard transform and Integer transform may also be used,<br>
[0023] Generally, ABSDCT based compression supports encoding of up to 1920x1080 images. However, the ABSDCT algorithm is inherently scalable and can handle higher bit-depths with expanded bit-widths. It can also compress images of any size, including 4Kx4K, since it is a block-based compression. Given this flexibility of ABSDCT, a system compresses, for example, a 4Kx2K, image for visually lossless image quality. The resulting bit-stream of block-wise DCT coefficients would, if completely decoded, produce the DC playback sequence. This bit-stream is grouped and arranged such that lower resolution sequences can be extracted using simple operations of cropping. [0024] More particularly, the input data may be encoded once to generate a complete bit-stream or a "Master Inventory." Within the master inventory are multiple levels of inventories. Here, a high level inventory may comprise one ore more lower level inventories. Typically, the highest level inventory would be the master inventory. Also, each inventory comprises a compressed bit-stream that may cater to a different target application.<br>
[0025] The embodiments disclosed derive a unique characterization of digital image representations and their relationship in pixel and transform domain. Basic transform principles along with standard multi-rate DSP techniques, applied to these representations provide the required re-sampling of image data in the transform domain. The required reduction in complexity of this approach over the expansive theoretical approach is the prime advantage of the invention. In addition, the invention can be<br><br>
directly extended to quantization matrices to enable inverse quantization operations after the re-sampling. This eliminates the need to decode and inverse quantize before resampling thus reducing decoder/transcoder complexity. Generally, two aspects are involved: 1) re-sampling variable block size transform matrices and 2) inverse quantization after re-sampling so as to enable standard inverse transform operations. [0026] More particularly, re-sampling involves re-sampling an N point sequence to increase by any factor (interpolate) or decrease by any factor (decimate) the sampling rate by any integral or fractional factor, (I/D) - a rational number, where I and D are mutually prime integers, interpolate by factor I to generate the transform of an NI point sequence and then decimate by D to get the (NI/D) point sequence. The variable block-size inverse quantization after re-sampling requires appropriate modification of quantization parameters and values. The re-sampling scheme described in (1) above can be extended to generate the re-sampled quantization matrices. The scale factors used in re-sampling the image define the filters used in re-sampling the quantization matrices. [0027] Modified tables can be computed at the encoder and transmitted as metadata, or . computed at the distribution server for the required scale factors (determined by channel . or network conditions or QoS) or can be derived by the decoder based on the certain parameters defined at the terminal equipment (such as rescaling matrix for the appropriate re-quantization).<br>
[0028] Figure 2 is a block diagram of components of in an image processing system 2100. The image processing system comprises a distribution center 2102 for encoding one or more images to produce a bit-stream 2116 and transmitting the bit-stream 2116 to at least one receive center 2118. The receive center (may be an electronic mobile device or an electronic fixed device) for decoding received bit-stream 2116 and producing an image data.<br>
[0029] The distribution center 2102 comprises a content database 2105, a transmitter 2114 and an encode processor 2104 (hereinafter referred to as "encoder") having a variable block converter 2106, a DCT Logic, a quantizer, and bit-stream 2112. The encoder utilizes known image compression techniques to generate a compressed bit-stream 2116, which is transmitted using the transmitter 2114. Various techniques may be used by the bit-stream generator 2112 to compress and organize the image data into the bit-stream for efficient extraction at the receive center 2118. Figure 3, discussed below, shows one such organization of a bit-stream.<br><br>
[0030] The receive center 2118 comprises a transceiver 2122, a display logic 2132 a memory 2124, a decode processor 2120 (hereinafter referred to at "decoder") having a bit-stream extractor 2125, sub-sampling logic 2126, and inverse quantizer/transform 2128. Generally, the compressed bit-stream 2116 is received the transceiver 2122. Depending on the manufacture preference, the received bit-stream may be archived in memory 2124 for later processing.<br>
[0031] In an embodiment, the receive center 2118 represents a mobile electronic device, such a mobile digital terminal operable in a wireless communication system (for example, CDMA, OFDMA, GSM, WCDMA, MPEG systems, etc. wireless systems). In this embodiment, the bit-stream may be stored temporarily and may be retransmitted to other mobile device via base station (not shown).<br>
[0032] In another embodiment, the receive center 2118 represents an electronic device, such as a general-purpose computer or laptop, set up as a server. In this embodiment, the bit-stream may be stored temporarily man retransmitted to other mobile devices connected wirelessly or non-wirelessly to the server.<br>
[0033] Figure 3 illustrates an organization of a bit-stream configured according to an embodiment of the invention. The bit-stream is constructed and organized by the encoder 2104. Figure 3 includes a thumbnail inventory that may be generated by compressing the scaled (l/256th) image formed by the means of the blocks. The target bit rate for this layer is 200Kbps for a 112x64x24 frames per second (fps) image sequence. Multiple layers (for example 0-7) of compressed data are generated to meet the requirements of target applications. Generally, the layer associated with a quality level (for example 0-7). Thereafter, necessary layers are extracted or cropped from the multiple layers to provide a specific description of compressed data for a target application. In an alternative embodiment, an archival compression may be performed to generate an archival inventory. To generate a specific inventory for a target application, the bit-stream is decoded to an archival quality playback sequence. [0034] Figure 4 illustrates a flowchart 4300 of the tasks for the receive center 2118 according to an embodiment of the invention. At block 4302 the encoded and layered bit-stream is received. At block 4304, the bit-stream is stored. At block 4308, the desired resolution is determined based on one or more criteria. Depending on the manufacture of receiving center or an operator of the system, several methods may be used to determine desired resolution. In an embodiment, the receiver may be a server using an algorithm to determine the number of different resolutions required. For<br><br>
example, Digital Cinema requires a resolution of 1920x1080x24, High Definitii Television (HDTV) requires a resolution of 1920x1080x24, Standard Televisii (SDTV) requires a resolution of 720x486x24, Digital Satellite System (DSS) requires resolution of 352x240x24 and thumbnails require a resolution of 112x64x24 th operate at compressed bit-streams of different resolutions and bit rates. Oth applications include, but are not limited to, Digital Versatile Disc or Video Disc (DVT Advanced Television Systems Committee (ATSC), Digital Video Broadcast (DVB), another embodiment, the receiver center may be mobile terminal using a fix
[0035] At block 4312, desired level of quality is determined. The quality may 1<br>
predetermined or determined using an algorithm based on one or more criteria, such ;<br>
available resources, the desired resolution, system resources. In an embodiment of tl<br>
invention, the decoder 2120 utilizes information, retrieved from one or more devic
connected to the receiving center 2118 to derive a quality level (for example 0 to 7). Tl<br>
retrieved information, among other things, comprises resolution limitations, desire<br>
resolution, various system thresholds and subscription levels that may limit bandwid<br>
the mobile devices is allowed to use or capable of using. Generally, lower the qualii<br>
level; lower the required bits needed. For example, a high resolution with a high qualii<br>
level will require large number of bits to be extracted from the bit-stream. In contrac<br>
the lower resolution with lower quality level will require low number of bits to t<br>
extracted from the bit-stream. Different criteria and thresholds may be used to determir<br>
the level of quality allowable at a particular time of day. For example, an availafr<br>
transmission bandwidth criterion may be based on currently available bandwidth fc<br>
communication. Other criterion may be based on system traffic, number of use]<br>
connected to the system or the number of devices connected to the receive center.<br>
[0036] Upon determining the desired resolution and desired quality, at block 431(<br>
appropriate data is extracted from the bit-stream 2116 to create one or more extracte<br>
streams based on determined resolution and quality. For example, an extracted streai<br>
may be based DSS resolution with quality level 4. The required DC and AC coefficient<br>
are then extracted from the bit-stream based on DSS resolution and all the bi1<br>
associated with up to layer 4. Upon extracting the necessary data, the pixel blocks at<br>
reconstructed using the extracted data.<br><br>
[0037] At block 4320, the block extracted stream is sub-sampled in the transform domain. Generally, the extracted stream is in a block representation of the image in the original resolution. Using the sub-sampling method, described below, in the transformed domain, the image is filtered and decimated to get the desired resolution. According to the method described below, the dyadic or non-dyadic scaling may used for decimation to avoid aliasing. Thereafter, the adjusted image data are processed using known techniques for inverse quantization and inverse DCT.<br>
[0038] At block 4328 and 4332 the data is processed through inverse quantization and inverse DCT to produce a desired image, respectively. At block 4336, the desired image may be transmitted to other connected devices using the transceiver 2122 and/or displayed on a display using the display logic 2132.<br>
[0039] Figure 5 illustrates a high level flowchart 5400 of tasks performed for sub-sampling in the transformed domain according to an embodiment of the invention. At block 5402, the extracted data representing image in the original resolution is filtered and, at block 5404, the filtered data is decimated. DCT or transform domain resolution scaling is performed using frequency sub-sampling. Sub-sampling of images can be performed in the pixel domain or in frequency domain. Since sub-sampling is a process of filtering and decimation, it can be generalized to changing the sample rate of an N point 1-D sequence by any factor, which is a rational number (I/D), where I and D are mutually prime integers. Basically, the N point sequence is interpolated by a factor of I to generate the DCT of an NI point sequence and then decimated by D, to get the DCT of an (NI/D) point sequence. This requires that N is a multiple of D (N = MD). [0040] Let the original sequence be x(n) (n = O..MD-1), its DCT is:<br>
 [0041] This is interpolated by factor I by (conceptually) concatenating I copies of X and multiplying by the IMD point DCT of an appropriate interpolating filter H(k):<br>
 [0042] The result is then decimated by D, to generate the EVI (=NI/D) point DCT of the result:<br>
10 [0043] This is the expression that a routine performing this operation will evaluate (for  [0044] The 2D equivalent of this operation is used to achieve frequency domain sub-sampling. Equation 1 can be further simplified to simple additions for implementation purposes,<br>
[0045] The filter H(k) is a modified Remez low pass filter. A Parks-McClellan optimal equiripple FIR low pass filter with a passband to stopband ratio of 10:1 was used. It provided a smooth roll-off yet retaining sufficient high frequency content to avoid aliasing. This filter was modified to take into consideration the effect of quantization on the DCT coefficients. Variable block size quantization redistributes emphasis on lower order high frequency components. The decisions for block break down depend on the activity in the content. If the filter had a faster roll-off, some of these critical frequency components could be attenuated causing ringing artifacts after inverse transform due to aliasing [0046] For non-dyadic scaling, were I and D are not necessarily prime integers, the<br>
interpolated is by a factor of ' ' which is the nearest integer. The transform domain coefficients are zero padded to match the filter length to avoid aliasing. [0047] A generic filter as this minimized distortions in the image. The optimizations are based on MMSE techniques and data dependent thresholds were derived. PSNR with spatial domain re-sampled images could be used for optimizations as well. A statistically derived Wiener filter can also be used.<br>
[0048] Additionally, the inverse quantization tables for the re-sampled transform domain coefficients may be derived as follows: 1) The inverse quantization matrices are interpolated and decimated using the same procedure as for the transform domain coefficients; 2) The true DC quantization value is scaled by a factor equal to the resampling scale factor; 3) The intermediate DCs are scaled by the re-sampling scale factor of the sub-block.<br>
[0049] This technique provides for a direct transcodability to lower or higher resolutions eliminating the need to decode to pixel domain before scaling. In addition, it is sufficient to send the scale factors and not the entire table data to the decoder and save<br>
on transmission bandwidth. The decoder can reconstruct the new inverse quantization tables. This also reduces overhead associated with scalability, since different tables can be derived for different output resolutions from the same bit-stream and original quantization tables.<br>
[0050] As examples, the method and apparatus may also be implemented in mobile electronic devices such as a mobile telephone, PDA, portable computers, and other devices having a wireless connection system and receiving audio and video data. [0051] While the invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to a preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various , changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. That is, other modifications and variations to the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure and teachings. Thus, while only certain embodiments of the invention have been specifically described herein, it will be apparent that numerous modifications may be made thereto without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
