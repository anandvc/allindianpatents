				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
GLASS FIBER FOR REINFORCING RUBBER PRODUCTS AND METHOD<br>
FOR PRODUCING IT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products, which is to be used as a<br>
reinforcing material for various rubber products such as<br>
rubber tires or rubber belts including timing belts; and<br>
a process for producing such a glass fiber.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
It is common that a reinforcing glass fiber to be<br>
used to increase the strength or durability of various<br>
rubber products such as rubber tires or rubber belts<br>
including timing belts, is coated with a membrane formed<br>
by a rubber type treating agent in order to increase the<br>
adhesion between the glass fiber and a rubber base<br>
material in a rubber product and in order to increase the<br>
durability of the rubber product by protecting the glass<br>
fiber itself. As such a rubber type treating agent, a<br>
water-soluble treating agent comprising a condensate of<br>
resorcinol with formaldehyde, and a rubber latex, as the<br>
main components (hereinafter sometimes referred to as<br>
"RFL treating agent"), or a treating agent having a<br>
rubber composition dissolved in a solvent (hereinafter<br><br>
sometimes referred to as "rubber cement"), is known.<br>
Further, the above glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products is commonly produced by a producing method which<br>
includes the following processes (A) to (C).<br>
(A) A process of drawing together some of glass fiber<br>
strands obtained by bundling many glass filaments while<br>
applying a sizing agent thereto, followed by drying, and<br>
impregnating an RFL treating agent thereto, and then,<br>
solidifying the RFL treating agent impregnated to the<br>
glass fiber strands, to form a coating layer thereby to<br>
obtain a coated glass fiber.<br>
(B) A process of subjecting the coated glass fiber to<br>
twisting to form a twisted yarn.<br>
(C) A process of putting at least two twisted yarns<br>
together to form a plied yarn.<br>
Further, in order to increase the adhesion between a<br>
reinforcing glass fiber and a rubber base material in a<br>
rubber product, it is common to further include the<br>
following process (D) in addition to the above processes<br>
(A) to (C) .<br>
(D) A process of coating a rubber cement on the<br>
surface of the plied yarn, and then, solidifying the<br>
rubber cement applied on the plied yarn to form a coating<br>
layer.<br>
Here, the glass fiber strand used in the above<br>
process (A), is one prepared by bundling from 2 00 to<br>
2,000 glass filaments having a diameter of from 3 to 10<br><br>
m. Further, it has been common to draw a plurality of<br>
such glass fiber strands together and to impregnate an<br>
RFL treating agent thereto.<br>
That is, in the following Patent Document 1, it is<br>
disclosed that a high-strength glass strand prepared by-<br>
bundling from 200 to 2,000 high-strength glass filaments<br>
having a diameter of more than 8 m and at most 10m, is<br>
used, and 1 to 10 such high-strength glass fiber strands<br>
are drawn together and are continuously introduced into<br>
the RFL treating agent and impregnated therewith.<br>
Further, in the following Patent Document 2, it is<br>
disclosed that a high-strength glass fiber strand<br>
prepared by bundling from 200 to 2,000, preferably from<br>
300 to 600, high-strength glass filaments having a<br>
diameter of from 3 to 6 urn, is used, and from 1 to 10,<br>
preferably from 1 to 6, such high-strength glass fiber<br>
strands are drawn together to form a primary yarn of a<br>
specific yarn count, composed of from 200 to 5,000,<br>
preferably from 800 to 2,000, high-strength glass<br>
filaments, whereby a coated layer made of the RFL<br>
treating agent is formed on the surface of the primary<br>
yarn.<br>
Further, in the following Patent Document 3, it is<br>
disclosed that a high-strength glass fiber strand<br>
prepared by bundling from 500 to 800 high-strength glass<br>
filaments having a diameter of from 6 to 8 urn, is used,<br>
and from 1 to 8 such high-strength glass fiber strands<br><br>
are drawn together.<br>
Further, the following Patent Document 4 discloses a<br>
treating method of a glass fiber wherein a strand having<br>
glass fiber filaments drawn together or a group of such<br>
strands, is immersed in a treating agent, and then, it is<br>
passed through at least one die to squeeze and impregnate<br>
the treating agent. Further, the excess treating agent<br>
on the surface of the above glass fiber is removed by at<br>
least one pair of rollers.<br>
Patent Document 1: JP-A-11-217739<br>
Patent Document 2: JP-A-11-158744<br>
Patent Document 3: JP-U-1-111848<br>
Patent Document 4: JP-A-9-25141<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
As mentioned in examples of each of the above Patent<br>
Documents, in a conventional process for producing a<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products, it has been<br>
common for obtaining a coated glass fiber that 3 or more<br>
glass fiber strands each having bundled from 200 to 400<br>
glass filaments having a specific average diameter, are<br>
drawn together, and the RFL treating agent is impregnated<br>
to them, followed by solidification of the RFL treating<br>
agent.<br>
However, by such a common process, when the plurality<br>
of glass fiber strands are drawn together and are<br><br>
continuously introduced to a bath filled with the RFL<br>
treating agent, to impregnate the RFL treating agent to<br>
the glass fiber strands, surrounding air is likely to be<br>
included among the glass fiber strands, so that<br>
impregnation of the RFL treating agent to the glass fiber<br>
strands becomes insufficient because of the presence of<br>
such included air, and the physical performance of the<br>
finally obtainable glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products may sometimes be adversely affected.<br>
Further, if the impregnation of the RFL treating<br>
agent to the glass fiber strands is insufficient, the RFL<br>
treating agent which is not completely impregnated, will<br>
remain on the surface of the glass fiber strands, so that<br>
some portions will have an excess RFL treating agent,<br>
whereby when the RFL treating agent is dried and<br>
solidified to form a coating layer, the excess RFL<br>
treating agent may sometimes be blistered to form a scab-<br>
form membrane. Such blistered membrane will be peeled by<br>
friction between the coated glass fiber and a guide or<br>
traveler, whereby a working environment will be<br>
deteriorated, or the appearance of the obtainable glass<br>
fiber for reinforcing rubber products, will be impaired.<br>
A glass strand is usually wound up in a form of a<br>
drum into a coiled body called a cake, and the glass<br>
stand is used by being pulled out from such a cake. When<br>
the cake is heated to dry, the sizing agent applied to<br>
the glass strand will move to an inner section (towards<br><br>
the center of the coiled body) and an outer section of<br>
the cake, along with evaporation of moisture, whereby<br>
there will be a phenomenon (commonly called as migration)<br>
such that a large amount of the sizing agent is unevenly<br>
distributed at such sections of the glass fiber strand.<br>
The glass fiber strand having a large amount of the<br>
sizing agent at such sections, is relatively poor in<br>
impregnation of the RFL treating agent, so that the above<br>
problem which happens when impregnation is insufficient,<br>
tends to be more distinct. Therefore, a certain amount<br>
of the glass fiber strand at the innermost section and<br>
the outermost section of the cake, having a large amount<br>
of the sizing agent deposited, is required to be removed<br>
and disposed, thus leading to a decrease of the yield.<br>
Further, in the above process (A), when some glass<br>
fiber strands are drawn together, and the RFL treating<br>
agent is impregnated to them, a tension compensator such<br>
as a disk tenser is used to draw the respective glass<br>
fiber strands together with uniform tension. In such a<br>
case, if a load applied by the disk tenser is too large,<br>
the glass fiber strands will be damaged, and therefore<br>
the load has to be made as small as possible. As a<br>
result, it is difficult to draw the respective glass<br>
fiber strands together with uniform tension, and tension<br>
will be unevenly distributed. Such uneven distribution<br>
of tension may sometimes adversely affect the physical<br>
performance, particularly the tensile strength, of the<br><br>
finally obtainable glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products.<br>
Therefore, the object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products,<br>
having excellent appearance and a physical performance,<br>
and having little fluctuation of quality, wherein an RFL<br>
treating agent is uniformly and sufficiently impregnated<br>
to the glass fiber strand, and an excess RFL treating<br>
agent is prevented from remaining on and being peeled off<br>
from the surface of the glass fiber strand; and a process<br>
for producing such a glass fiber.<br>
MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS<br>
In order to accomplish the above object, the glass<br>
fiber for reinforcing rubber products of the present<br>
invention, is a glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products, which is obtained by subjecting to plying at<br>
least two twisted yarns each obtained by subjecting to<br>
twisting a coated glass fiber having a coating layer<br>
formed by impregnation and solidification of a RFL<br>
treating agent comprising, as the main components, a<br>
rubber latex and a water-soluble condensate of resorcinol<br>
with formaldehyde, wherein the coated glass fiber is a<br>
coated glass fiber having the coating layer formed by<br>
impregnating the RFL treating agent to a single glass<br>
fiber strand having from 200 to 2,000 glass filaments<br>
bundled, and solidifying the impregnated agent.<br><br>
According to the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products of the present invention, the RFL treating agent<br>
is impregnated to one glass fiber strand having from 200<br>
to 2,000 glass filaments bundled, and solidified to form<br>
a coating layer, whereby air is not included during the<br>
impregnation of the RFL treating agent to the glass fiber<br>
strand, and the RFL treating agent is uniformly and<br>
sufficiently impregnated among the respective filaments<br>
forming the glass fiber strand. Therefore, such a glass<br>
fiber for reinforcing rubber products will be free from<br>
such a possibility that a blistered membrane formed by an<br>
excess RFL treating agent, will remain and be peeled off,<br>
and it will have excellent appearance and physical<br>
performance, particularly excellent tensile strength.<br>
The glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products of<br>
the present invention, is preferably such that a coating<br>
layer of a treating agent comprising a rubber and a<br>
solvent, is further formed on the surface of the above .<br>
glass fiber obtained by the plying. It is thereby<br>
possible to increase its adhesion with a rubber base<br>
material in a rubber product.<br>
Further, in the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products of the present invention, the above glass fiber<br>
strand is preferably a glass fiber strand having from 500<br>
to 1,500 glass filaments bundled. It is thereby possible<br>
to have excellent impregnation of the RFL treating agent<br>
to the glass fiber strand while maintaining excellent<br><br>
productivity of the glass fiber strand in a fiber forming<br>
process.<br>
Further, with respect to the glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products of the present invention, the<br>
yarn count (g/km) and the cross section (mm2) preferably<br>
satisfy the relation of the following formula (1), more<br>
preferably satisfy the relation of the following formula<br>
(2) :<br>
145oryarn count (g/km)/cross section (mm2)1900 (1)<br>
1550yarn count (g/km)/cross section (mm2)1800 (2)<br>
On the other hand, the method for producing a glass<br>
fiber for reinforcing rubber products of the present<br>
invention, comprises an impregnation process (A) of<br>
impregnating a RFL treating agent comprising, as the main<br>
components, a rubber latex and a water-soluble condensate<br>
of resorcinol with formaldehyde, to a glass fiber strand,<br>
and solidifying the RFL treating agent impregnated to the<br>
glass fiber strand to form a coating layer thereby to<br>
obtain a coated glass fiber, a twisting process (B) of<br>
subjecting the coated glass fiber to twisting to obtain a<br>
twisted yarn, and a plying process (C) of putting at<br>
least two such twisted yarns together and subjecting them<br>
to plying, wherein in the impregnation process (A), as<br>
the glass fiber strand, one having from 200 to 2,000<br>
glass filaments bundled, is used, and the RFL treating<br>
agent is impregnated to each glass fiber strand<br>
independently without drawing such glass fiber strands<br><br>
together.<br>
According to the method for producing a glass fiber<br>
for reinforcing rubber products of the present invention,<br>
without drawing together a plurality of glass fiber<br>
strands having a specific number of glass filaments<br>
bundled, the above RFL treating agent is impregnated to<br>
each glass fiber strand independently, whereby air is<br>
hardly included during the impregnation of the RFL<br>
treating agent, and the impregnation state of the RFL<br>
treating agent to the glass strand is good. As a result,<br>
there will be no such a possibility that a blistered<br>
membrane by an excess RFL treating agent, will remain and<br>
be peeled off, and an obtainable glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products will have excellent<br>
appearance and physical performance. Moreover, it is<br>
possible to prevent deterioration of the working<br>
environment in the twisting process. Further, in the<br>
present invention, a plurality of glass fiber strands are<br>
not drawn together for the impregnation of the RFL<br>
treating agent, and tension among the glass fiber strands<br>
will not be unequal, whereby it is possible to provide<br>
excellent strength, particularly a tensile strength, of<br>
an obtainable glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products, thus to improve the quality.<br>
The process for producing a glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products of the present invention,<br>
preferably further includes an over-coating process (D)<br><br>
of applying a treating agent comprising a rubber and a<br>
solvent on the surface of the plied yarn obtained by the<br>
above plying process (C), and then, the treating agent<br>
applied on the plied yarn is solidified to form a coating<br>
layer. It is thereby possible to increase the adhesion<br>
with a rubber base material in a rubber product.<br>
Further, in the method for producing a glass fiber<br>
for reinforcing rubber products of the present invention,<br>
it is preferred to use, as the above glass fiber strand,<br>
a glass fiber strand having from 500 to 1,500 glass<br>
filaments bundled. It is thereby possible to have<br>
excellent impregnation of the RFL treating agent to the<br>
glass fiber strand while maintaining excellent<br>
productivity of the glass fiber strand in a fiber forming<br>
process.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, the impregnation<br>
of the RFL treating agent to the glass fiber strand is<br>
excellent, whereby the coating layer rarely has blister<br>
and scale, and appearance and physical performance are<br>
also excellent. Further, the strength, particularly<br>
tensile strength, of an obtainable glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products, is good and thus it is<br>
possible to improve the quality.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products of<br><br>
the present invention, is one obtained by subjecting to<br>
plying at least two twisted yarns of the coated glass<br>
fiber obtained by solidification of a RFL treating agent<br>
to form coating film layer, such a RFL treating agent<br>
comprises, as the main components, a rubber latex and a<br>
water-soluble condensate of resorcinol with formaldehyde,<br>
and which is impregnated to each glass fiber strand<br>
individually without drawing together a plurality of the<br>
glass fiber strands.<br>
The glass fiber strand to be used in the present<br>
invention is a glass fiber strand having from 200 to<br>
2,000 glass filaments bundled. Specifically, a glass<br>
fiber strand having from 500 to 1,500 glass filaments<br>
bundled, is preferred from a viewpoint such that it is<br>
possible to have excellent impregnation of the RFL<br>
treating agent to the glass fiber strand while<br>
maintaining excellent productivity of the glass fiber<br>
strand in a fiber forming process. Further, the glass<br>
fiber strand is preferably used after bundling glass<br>
filaments by applying a sizing agent comprising a silane<br>
coupling agent, a film-forming agent, etc.<br>
The average diameter of glass filaments is preferably<br>
from 5 to 15 m, more preferably from 7 to 9 m. Further,<br>
the composition of glass consisting the glass filaments,<br>
is not particularly limited, and it may, for example, be<br>
E glass, S glass, etc.<br>
The RFL treating agent to be used in the present<br><br>
invention is a composition comprising a rubber latex and<br>
a water-soluble condensate of resorcinol with<br>
formaldehyde (hereinafter "a water-soluble condensate of<br>
resorcinol with formaldehyde" will be referred to as "an<br>
RF condensate"), wherein an RF condensate and a rubber<br>
latex are uniformly mixed in water as a solvent in<br>
accordance with a common method.<br>
As the RF condensate to be incorporated to the RFL<br>
treating agent, it is possible to use a water-soluble<br>
addition condensate rich in oxymethyl groups, obtained by<br>
reacting resorcinol with formaldehyde in the presence of<br>
an alkaline catalyst such as an alkali metal hydroxide,<br>
ammonia or an amine, and it is preferably an RF<br>
condensate obtained by a reaction of resorcinol:<br>
formaldehyde in a molar ratio of 1:(0.3 to 2.5).<br>
The rubber latex to be blended for an RFL treating<br>
agent may, for example, be a latex of a<br>
vinylpyridine/styrene/butadiene terpolymer, a latex of an<br>
acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene terpolymer, a latex of an<br>
acrylonitrile/butadiene copolymer, a latex of a modified<br>
acrylonitrile/butadiene copolymer, a latex of a<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymer, a latex of a dicarboxylated<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymer, a latex of polybutadiene, or<br>
a latex of a halogen-containing polymer. They may be<br>
used alone or in combination as a mixture of two or more<br>
of them. Among them, a combination of a latex of a<br>
vinylpyridine/styrene/butadiene terpolymer (hereinafter<br><br>
referred to as "a vinylpyridine latex") with other rubber<br>
latexes is preferred, and it is preferably a combination<br>
of a vinylpyridine latex with a latex of a halogen-<br>
containing polymer, from a viewpoint such that it is<br>
possible to improve the heat resistance, flex fatigue<br>
resistance or water resistance of a finally obtainable<br>
rubber product such as a timing belt, or the like.<br>
Further, a halogen-containing polymer contained in the<br>
above latex of a halogen-containing polymer, may, for<br>
example, be a chlorinated rubber, a chloroprene rubber or<br>
a chlorosulfonated polyethylene, and a chlorosulfonated<br>
polyethylene is particularly preferred. Further, as the<br>
above vinylpyridine latex, it is possible to use one<br>
commonly used for treatment of a fiber for reinforcing<br>
rubber products, and it is preferably a latex obtained<br>
from a terpolymer having a content ratio of<br>
vinylpyridine:styrene:butadiene of 10 to 20:10 to 20:60<br>
to 80 by mass percent.<br>
As such a vinylpyridine latex, Nipol-2518FS<br>
(tradename, manufactured by ZEON CORPORATION) or Pyratex<br>
(tradename, manufactured by NIPPON A&amp;L INC.) may, for<br>
example, be suitably used.<br>
The content ratio of the RF condensate and the<br>
rubber latex in the RFL treating agent, is such that<br>
based on 100 parts by mass of the rubber latex, the RF<br>
condensate is preferably from 1 to 4 0 parts by mass,<br>
particularly preferably from 2 to 15 parts by mass.<br><br>
Further, when a vinylpyridine latex is used in<br>
combination with other rubber latexes, such other rubber<br>
latexes are preferably from 5 to 100 parts by mass,<br>
particularly preferably from 10 to 30 parts by mass,<br>
based on 100 parts by mass of the vinylpyridine latex.<br>
Further, the above content ratio of the respective<br>
components is a mass ratio of their solid contents.<br>
To the RFL treating agent, as the case requires, it<br>
is possible to incorporate a component which is commonly<br>
incorporated in a conventional RFL treating agent, in<br>
addition to the RF condensate and the rubber latex. For<br>
example, a stabilizer of a latex or an age resistor, may<br>
be mentioned. The stabilizer may, for example, be an<br>
aqueous ammonia or an aqueous solution of sodium<br>
hydroxide, and the age resistor may, for example, be a<br>
liquid type emulsified product of a mineral oil.<br>
The solid content, namely the concentration, of the<br>
RFL treating agent is preferably from 10 to 50 mass%,<br>
more preferably from 20 to 40 mass%. If the above<br>
concentration is less than 10 mass%, the RFL treating<br>
agent may not be impregnated in a sufficient amount to<br>
the glass fiber strand. If it is beyond 50 mass%, the<br>
stability of the RFL treating agent will be decreased,<br>
and the agent will tend to be gelled.<br>
The fiber for reinforcing rubber products of the<br>
present invention is one having a glass fiber strand<br>
coated with a coating layer (hereinafter referred to also<br><br>
as "the first membrane") formed by the above RFL treating<br>
agent. However, in order to further increase the<br>
adhesion with a rubber composition which will be the base<br>
material for a rubber product such as a tire or a rubber<br>
belt including a timing belt, it is preferred that the<br>
first membrane is further covered by a coating layer<br>
(hereinafter referred to also as "the second membrane")<br>
formed by the treating agent comprising a rubber and a<br>
solvent (hereinafter referred to as "the over-coat<br>
treating agent").<br>
Such an over-coat treating agent contains a rubber,<br>
as a main component, and it can be obtained by<br>
dissolving, to a solvent, a rubber and other components<br>
which are incorporated as the case requires, in<br>
accordance with a common method.<br>
The rubber to be used for the over-coat treating<br>
agent may be a rubber used for a conventional rubber<br>
cement such as a halogen-containing polymer, an<br>
acrylonitrile/butadiene copolymer rubber (NBR) or a<br>
hydrogenated nitrile rubber (H-NBR), etc. As the<br>
halogen-containing polymer may, for example, be a<br>
chlorinated natural rubber, a chloroprene rubber, a<br>
chlorinated polyethylene, a chlorinated<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymer, a chlorinated polyvinyl<br>
chloride, a chlorosulfonated polyethylene or a chloro-<br>
brominated polybutadiene.<br>
As the solvent to be used for the over-coat treating<br><br>
agent, it is possible to use an organic solvent. It may,<br>
for example, be xylene, toluene, methyl ethyl ketone<br>
(MEK), methyl isobutyl ketone (MIBK) or ethyl acetate.<br>
To the over-coat treating agent, as the case<br>
requires, it is possible to incorporate a curing agent,<br>
an isocyanate, a resin, an additive, etc., in addition to<br>
the above rubber and solvent.<br>
As the above curing agent, a polynitroso aromatic<br>
compound or a benzoquinone may, for example, be used. As<br>
the polynitroso aromatic compound, p-dinitrosobenzene or<br>
poly p-dinitrosobenzene may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
The benzoquinone may, for example, be<br>
tetrachlorobenzoquinone, p-, p'-dibenzoylbenzoquinone<br>
dioxime or p-benzoquinone dioxime. Among them, it is<br>
preferred to use poly p-dinitrosobenzene,<br>
tetrachlorobenzoquinone, p-, p'-dibenzoylbenzoquinone<br>
dioxime or p-benzoquinone dioxime.<br>
As the above isocyanate, methylenediphenyl<br>
diisocyanate (MDI), toluene diisocyanate (TDI),<br>
triphenylmethane triisocyanate or naphthalene<br>
diisocyanate (NDI) may, for example, be used. However,<br>
an isocyanate monomer is highly volatile and is not<br>
preferred from the viewpoint of the safety and the<br>
handling efficiency. Preferred is a polyisocyanate such<br>
as a dimer, which has a relatively small molecular weight<br>
and a high reactivity, and more preferred is a<br>
polyisocyanate having a polymerization degree of from 2<br><br>
to 10.<br>
As the above resin, it is possible to use an uncured<br>
phenol resin or an uncured epoxy resin. The uncured<br>
phenol resin is an uncured one among resins obtained from<br>
a phenol and an aldehyde, namely a phenol resin having<br>
reactivity for curing, and it may, for example, be<br>
novolac or resol. Further, an uncured epoxy resin is one<br>
which is not yet cured among epoxy resins, i.e. one<br>
having reactivity for curing. The epoxy resin may, for<br>
example, be a bisphenol A type epoxy resin, a bisphenol F<br>
type epoxy resin, a phenol novolac type epoxy resin, or a<br>
cresol novolac type epoxy resin.<br>
As the above additive, a curing accelerator, a<br>
softener, an antioxidant, an inorganic filler commonly<br>
used as an additive for a rubber composition may, for<br>
example, be used. As the inorganic filler, silica or<br>
carbon black may, for example, be used. Further, as the<br>
curing accelerator, a maleimide type curing accelerator<br>
may, for example, be used.<br>
A preferred example of a component for the over-coat<br>
treating agent used in the present invention, may be a<br>
combination of a halogen-containing polymer, an<br>
isocyanate and a curing agent, or a combination of an<br>
acrylonitrile/butadiene copolymer rubber, an uncured<br>
phenol resin and an uncured epoxy resin.<br>
The solid content, namely the concentration, of the<br>
over-coat treating agent is preferably from 3 to 20<br><br>
mass%, more preferably from 5 to 15 mass%. If the above<br>
concentration is less than 3 mass%, the over-coat<br>
treating agent may not be applied in a sufficient amount<br>
to the glass fiber strand. If it is beyond 20 mass%, the<br>
stability of the over-coat treating agent may be<br>
deteriorated.<br>
Further, the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products of the present invention, may be coated with a<br>
coating layer (a third membrane) formed by a treating<br>
agent containing the same rubber as the rubber base<br>
material in a rubber product, in order to increase the<br>
adhesion with the rubber composition as the base material<br>
for a rubber product, as disclosed, for example, in JP-A-<br>
3-269177 or JP-A-7-190149.<br>
Further, with respect to the glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products of the present invention, the<br>
yarn count (g/km) and the cross section (mm2) preferably<br>
satisfy the relation of the following formula (1), more<br>
preferably satisfy the relation of the following formula<br>
(2):<br>
1450yarn count (g/km)/cross section (mm2)1900 (1)<br>
1550yarn count (g/km)/cross section (mm2)1800 (2)<br>
When a value obtained by dividing the yarn count<br>
(g/km) of the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products<br>
by the cross section (mm2) of the fiber, is in the above<br>
range, the cohesion among twisted yarns constituting the<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products will be<br><br>
strong, so that the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
product will have excellent water durability because the<br>
penetration of water into the inside of the fiber is<br>
prevented even if the fiber is immersed in water, and the<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products will be able<br>
to maintain good flexibility. By using such a glass<br>
fiber for reinforcing rubber products, the water<br>
resistance of a finally obtainable rubber product such as<br>
a timing belt will be good.<br>
Now, the method for producing a glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products of the present invention,<br>
will be described.<br>
The glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products of<br>
the present invention is produced via an impregnation<br>
process (A) of impregnating an RFL treating agent to a<br>
glass fiber strand, and then, solidifying the RFL<br>
treating agent impregnated to the glass fiber strand to<br>
form a coating layer thereby to obtain a coated glass •<br>
fiber, a twisting process (B) of subjecting the coated<br>
glass fiber to twisting to obtain a twisted yarn, and a<br>
plying process (C) of putting at least two such twisted<br>
yarns together and subjecting them to plying.<br>
That is, first, in the impregnation process (A), a<br>
glass fiber strand to be coated, is continuously<br>
introduced to a bath filled with the RFL treating agent,<br>
and the RFL treating agent is adhered and impregnated to<br>
the fiber. Further, such a glass fiber strand having the<br><br>
RFL treating agent adhered, is continuously heated in a<br>
hot-air oven at from 200 to 350°C, followed by drying and<br>
solidifying the RFL treating agent, to form a first<br>
membrane, thereby to obtain a coated glass fiber having<br>
the first membrane.<br>
The present invention is characterized in that in<br>
such an impregnation process, glass fiber strands are not<br>
drawn together, but each strand is independently<br>
introduced to a bath filled with the RFL treating agent,<br>
and the RFL treating agent is impregnated to it.<br>
In such an impregnation process, if a plurality of<br>
glass fiber strands were drawn together and were<br>
introduced to a bath filled with the RFL treating agent<br>
as a conventional technique, they were introduced to the<br>
bath while surrounding air is included among the glass<br>
fiber strands, whereby the agent tended to be impregnated<br>
together with the air, and small air bubbles tended to<br>
remain in the first membrane. As a result, a blistered<br>
portion would be formed on the first membrane, and such a<br>
blistered portion would easily be peeled. Especially,<br>
with respect to the glass fiber strand taken out from the<br>
innermost or outermost section of the cake wherein<br>
migration took place, it had a large amount of the sizing<br>
agent, whereby the impregnation of the RFL treating agent<br>
was poor, and specifically, small air bubbles tended to<br>
remain, and blister and scale was like to result.<br>
Further, the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br><br>
products obtained by such a conventional technique, would<br>
easily be poor in strength, particularly tensile<br>
strength, and it was hardly able to stabilize the product<br>
quality.<br>
When the RFL treating agent is impregnated to glass<br>
fiber strands, uniform tension needs to be provided to<br>
draw the respective glass fiber strands together.<br>
However, if the tension is too large, the glass fiber<br>
strands will be damaged, whereby the physical performance<br>
may be deteriorated, and the fibers may be broken.<br>
Therefore, the tension needs to be as small as possible,<br>
which means that it will be difficult to provide uniform<br>
tension to the respective strands. As a result, it is<br>
considered that when the tensile stress is exerted on the<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products, the<br>
respective glass fiber strands constituting such a fiber<br>
cannot resist the stress equally.<br>
However, according to the producing method of the<br>
present invention, glass fiber strands are not drawn<br>
together, but individually introduced to a bath filled<br>
with the RFL treating agent. By impregnating the RFL<br>
treating agent to each glass fiber strand individually,<br>
it is possible to impregnate the RFL treating agent<br>
efficiently, and small air bubbles will hardly remain in<br>
the first membrane. Further, tension at the glass fiber<br>
strand will not be non-uniform, whereby tensile strength<br>
will sufficiently be obtained. Further, it is possible<br><br>
to prevent fluctuation of the quality.<br>
Further, since it is possible to have the efficient<br>
impregnation of the RFL treating agent, even in the glass<br>
fiber strand of an inner or outer section of the cake<br>
having a large amount of the sizing agent because of<br>
migration, blister and scale is hardly formed, and it is<br>
possible to improve the yield of the glass fiber strand.<br>
Further, it is possible to reduce an installation<br>
space of a rack (creel) for the cake, whereby it is<br>
possible to reduce the size of the whole production<br>
device, and installation space and device cost will be<br>
reduced.<br>
In the present invention, the deposited amount of<br>
the first membrane to the coated glass fiber is<br>
preferably from 12 to 25 mass%, more preferably from 16<br>
to 22 mass%, as solid content, based on the mass of the<br>
coated glass fiber. If the deposited amount is less than<br>
. 12 mass%, individual glass filaments of the coated glass<br>
fiber tend to be hardly adequately covered by the first<br>
membrane, and the glass filaments are likely to contact<br>
one another and tend to be abraded by friction, so that<br>
the bending fatigue resistant of the finally obtainable<br>
timing belts, etc., tends to be poor. If the deposited<br>
amount exceeds 25 mass%, the flexibility of the membrane<br>
tends to be poor, and also the flex fatigue resistance of<br>
the finally obtainable rubber belts, etc., tends to be<br>
poor.<br><br>
Then, in the twisting process (B), coated glass<br>
fibers obtained in the above impregnation process, are<br>
individually or in combination of a plurality of them,<br>
subjected to twisting by a twisting machine such as a<br>
ring twisting machine to obtain a twisted yarn. The<br>
number of twists of the coated glass fiber in such<br>
twisting process is preferably from 0.5 to 4 twists/25<br>
mm. Otherwise, in the present invention, the coated<br>
glass fiber obtained in the above impregnation process,<br>
may be once taken up, and then, the coated glass fiber<br>
may be subjected to twisting to obtain a twisted yarn, or<br>
the coated glass fiber obtained in the above impregnation<br>
process may be subjected to twisting without being taken<br>
up, to obtain a twisted yarn.<br>
Then, in the plying process (C), at least two,<br>
preferably from 5 to 20 twisted yarns obtained in the<br>
above twisting process, are put together, and subjected<br>
to plying by means of a twisting machine such as a ring<br>
twisting machine or a flyer twisting machine to obtain a<br>
plied yarn. The number of twists in such a plying<br>
process is preferably from 0.5 to 4 twists/25 mm. The<br>
twisting direction in the plying process is adjusted to<br>
be opposite from the twisting direction in the twisting<br>
process.<br>
In the present invention, after the plying process,<br>
it is preferred to carry out an over-coating process (D),<br>
wherein an over-coat treating agent is applied on the<br><br>
surface of the above plied yarn, and the over-coat<br>
treating agent applied on the plied yarn, is solidified<br>
to form a second membrane. By forming the second<br>
membrane, it is possible to improve the adhesion between<br>
the reinforcing glass fiber and a rubber composition as<br>
the base material for a rubber product.<br>
The second membrane may be formed in such a manner<br>
that after the above plying process, the plied yarn is<br>
continuously immersed in a bath filled with the over-coat<br>
treating agent, or the over-coat treating agent is<br>
sprayed or coated on the surface of the plied yarn to<br>
have the over-coat treating agent applied to the plied<br>
yarn. Then, the plied yarn is continuously heated in<br>
e.g. a hot air oven at from 12 0 to 2 0 0°C to dry and<br>
solidify the over-coat treating agent.<br>
At that time, the deposited amount of the second<br>
membrane to the reinforcing glass fiber is preferably<br>
from 1 to 15 mass%, particularly preferably from 3 to 10<br>
mass%, as solid content, based on the mass of the<br>
reinforcing glass fiber. If the deposited amount is less<br>
than 1 mass%, the effect for increasing the adhesion<br>
between the reinforcing glass fiber and the rubber<br>
composition as the base material for rubber products is<br>
likely to be inadequate. Even if the deposited amount<br>
exceeds 15 mass%, the effect for increasing the adhesion<br>
will not increase so much, and the adhesion may rather be<br>
hindered.<br><br>
Further, in the present invention, it is preferred to<br>
properly select a method from the following (a) to (e)<br>
methods, to adjust the yarn count (g/km) and the cross<br>
section (mm2) to satisfy the relation of the following<br>
formula (1), it is more preferred to adjust them to<br>
satisfy the relation of the following formula (2):<br>
1450<yarn count section></yarn>
15 5 0<yarn count section></yarn>
(a) By properly adjusting the incorporating amounts<br>
of the respective components, particularly the amount of<br>
a vinylpyridine latex, of the RFL treating agent to be<br>
impregnated to a glass fiber strand, proper tackiness<br>
(the degree of stickiness of a coating layer made by the<br>
RFL treating agent covering a coated glass fiber) will be<br>
provided to the coated glass fiber, and in the subsequent<br>
plying process, the coated glass fibers (the twisted<br>
yarns) will be easily bound to one another.<br>
(b) In the impregnation process, by properly<br>
adjusting the temperature of a hot air oven to heat the<br>
glass fiber strand having the RFL treating agent<br>
impregnated thereto, proper tackiness will be provided to<br>
the coated glass fiber.<br>
(c) In the plying process, the tension exerted on the<br>
respective plural twisted yarns to be twisted, is<br>
properly adjusted by a tension adjusting mechanism of a<br>
twisted yarn-supplying portion (commonly called creel) of<br>
the twisting machine for plying.<br><br>
(d) In the plying process, when a ring twisting<br>
machine is used, the number of revolution of the take-up<br>
portion (commonly called spindle) is properly adjusted/<br>
and the weight and size of a traveler to be used are<br>
properly selected.<br>
(e) In the plying process, when a flyer twisting<br>
machine is used, in order to arrange twisted yarns to be<br>
a core material or side material of a plied yarn, as<br>
disclosed in JP-A-2001-114906, a yarn-separating guide<br>
having small pores for individually introducing the<br>
respective twisted yarns, is used, and a plurality of<br>
twisted yarns for constituting a plied yarn are thereby<br>
separated into a core material and a side material.<br>

Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples. Here, in the<br>
following respective Examples, as an RFL treating agent<br>
and an over-coating agent, ones obtained by the following<br>
processes were used.<br>

EXAMPLE 1<br>
600 Glass filaments made of high-strength glass (S<br>
glass) and having an average diameter of 7 m, were<br>
bundled while applying a sizing agent containing an amino<br>
silane coupling agent as the main component, and were<br>
taken up by a winding machine, followed by drying to<br>
obtain a cake of a glass fiber strand having a mass of<br>
3,300 g.<br>
Then, the glass fiber strand was pulled out from the<br>
innermost section of such a cake, and 500 m each was<br>
pulled out from each of the following sections (1) to<br>
(7) . The glass fiber strand pulled out from each section<br><br>
was individually and continuously immersed in a bath<br>
filled with the RFL treating agent to have the RFL<br>
treating agent deposited and impregnated to the glass<br>
fiber strand.<br>
Then, such a glass fiber strand was continuously<br>
heated for one minute in a hot air oven at a temperature<br>
of 25 0°C to dry and solidify the RFL treating agent, to<br>
obtain a coated glass fiber having a coating layer (first<br>
membrane) made of the RFL treating agent. Then, such a<br>
coated glass fiber was taken up by using a ring twisting<br>
machine as a winding machine. In such a manner, 7<br>
twisted yarns having a number of twists of 2 twists/25 mm<br>
were obtained. Here, the deposited amount of the above<br>
first membrane was 18% as solid content based on the mass<br>
of the twisted yarn.<br>
(1) The section wherein about 50 grams of the glass fiber<br>
strand was removed from the innermost section of the cake<br>
by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake: about 3,250<br>
g).<br>
(2) The section wherein about 150 grams of the glass<br>
fiber strand was removed from the innermost section of<br>
the cake by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake:<br>
about 3,150 g).<br>
(3) The section wherein about 1,300 grams of the glass<br>
fiber strand was removed from the innermost section of<br>
the cake by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake:<br>
about 2,000 g).<br><br>
(4) The section wherein about 2,300 grams of the glass<br>
fiber strand was removed from the innermost section of<br>
the cake by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake:<br>
about 1,000 g).<br>
(5) The section wherein about 3,050 grams of the glass<br>
fiber strand was removed from the innermost section of<br>
the cake by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake:<br>
about 25 0 g).<br>
(6) The section wherein about 3.080 grams of the glass<br>
fiber strand was removed from the innermost section of<br>
the cake by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake:<br>
about 22 0 g).<br>
(7) The section wherein about 3,120 grams of the glass<br>
fiber strand was removed from the innermost section of<br>
the cake by pulling it out (remaining amount of cake:<br>
about 180 g).<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
200 Glass filaments made of high-strength glass (S<br>
glass) and having an average diameter of 7 m, were<br>
bundled while applying a sizing agent containing an amino.<br>
silane coupling agent as the main component, and were<br>
taken up by a winding machine, followed by drying to<br>
obtain a cake of a glass fiber strand having a mass of<br>
3,300 g.<br>
Further, the glass fiber strand was pulled out from<br>
the innermost section of each of such three cakes, and<br>
500 m each was pulled out from the same sections as in<br><br>
Example 1 (7 sections of (1) to (7)). Such three glass<br>
fiber strands were drawn together and continuously-<br>
immersed in a bath filled with the RFL treating agent to<br>
have the RFL treating agent deposited and impregnated to<br>
the glass fiber strands.<br>
Then, such glass fiber strands were continuously<br>
heated for one minute in a hot air oven at a temperature<br>
of 250°C to dry and solidify the RFL treating agent, to<br>
obtain a coated glass fiber having the above first<br>
membrane.<br>
Then, such a coated glass fiber was taken up by using<br>
a ring twisting machine as a winding machine. In such a<br>
manner, 7 twisted yarns having a number of twists of 2<br>
twists/25 mm were obtained. Here, the deposited amount<br>
of the above first membrane was 18% as solid content<br>
based on the mass of the twisted yarn.<br>
TEST EXAMPLE 1<br>
With respect to each of the 14 twisted yarns obtained<br>
in the above Example 1 and Comparative Example i, the<br>
yarn count and the tensile strength were measured, and a<br>
value obtained by dividing the tensile strength by the<br>
yarn count was used as an index for the physical<br>
strength. Further, with respect to each of the twisted<br>
yarns, evaluation of the impregnation degree of the RFL<br>
treating agent was carried out by the following method.<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
METHOD FOR MEASURING TENSILE STRENGTH<br><br>
Using a tensile tester, the measurement of stress at<br>
break was carried out under such conditions that the<br>
chuck distance was 250 mm, and the tensile speed was 250<br>
mm/min.<br>
EVALUATION OF IMPREGNATION DEGREE OF RFL TREATING AGENT<br>
TO GLASS FIBER STRAND<br>
40 cm of a terminal end (winding terminal of the<br>
coil) portion of each of the twisted yarns was pulled out<br>
and was visually observed. The number of blisters or<br>
scales (scab-form membrane or their peeled portions) in<br>
the first membrane was counted, and it was converted to a<br>
number per 10 cm. Smallness of the number was used as an<br>
index for the impregnation degree of the RFL treating<br>
agent to the glass fiber strand.<br><br><br><br>
As shown in Table 1, it is evident that the twisted<br>
yarn in Example 1 using a single glass fiber strand<br>
without drawing a plurality of them together, in the<br>
impregnation process, has higher tensile strength as<br>
compared with the twisted yarn in Comparative Example 1<br>
using three glass fiber strands drawn together. This is<br>
considered attributable to the fact that there is no<br>
problem of fluctuation in tension during drawing a<br>
plurality of glass fiber strands together. Further, it<br>
is evident that when in Example 1, the glass fiber strand<br>
of the inner or outer section of the cake is used, the<br>
number of blisters is small and the influence by<br>
migration is small. This is considered attributable to<br>
the fact that the impregnation of the RFL treating agent<br>
to glass filaments is improved.<br>
Thus, according to the present invention, the<br>
impregnation degree of the RFL treating agent to the<br>
glass fiber strand will be good. Especially, even with a<br>
glass fiber strand at a section of the cake where it used<br>
to be difficult to impregnate the RFL treating agent<br>
because of a large amount of a sizing agent deposited<br>
unevenly, the impregnation degree of the RFL treating<br>
agent will be good.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A cake of a glass fiber strand (600 glass filaments<br>
bundled) having a mass of 3,3 00g was obtained in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1.<br><br>
Further, the glass fiber strand was pulled out from a<br>
section wherein 200 g of the glass fiber strand was<br>
removed from the innermost section of such a cake by-<br>
pulling the strand out (remaining amount of cake: about<br>
3,100 g), and the strand was individually and<br>
continuously immersed into a bath filled with the RFL<br>
treating agent to have the RFL treating agent deposited<br>
and impregnated to the glass fiber strand.<br>
After that, such a glass fiber strand was<br>
continuously heated for one minute in a hot air oven at a<br>
temperature of 250°C to dry and solidify the RFL treating<br>
agent, to obtain a coated glass fiber having a coating<br>
layer (first membrane) made of the RFL treating agent.<br>
Then, such a coated glass fiber was taken up by using<br>
a ring twisting machine as a winding machine. In such a<br>
manner, 5 00 m of 11 twisted yarns having a number of<br>
twists of 2 twists/25 mm were obtained. Here, the<br>
deposited amount of the above first membrane was 18 mass%<br>
as solid content based on the mass of the twisted yarn.<br>
Further, while such 11 twisted yarns were drawn<br>
together, the plying was carried out in the opposite<br>
twisting direction from the twisting to have a number of<br>
twists of 2 twists/25 mm, by using a ring twisting<br>
machine different from the twisting process, to obtain a<br>
plied yarn. At that time, the weight of a traveler used<br>
by the ring twisting machine for plying, was properly<br>
chosen among commercially available ones, to adjust the<br><br>
relation of the yarn count and the cross section of an<br>
obtainable glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products to<br>
be in a range of the above formula (1).<br>
Then, such a plied yarn was continuously immersed in<br>
a bath filled with the above over-coat treating agent,<br>
and the over-coat treating agent was deposited on the<br>
plied yarn. After that, such a plied yarn was<br>
continuously heated for one minute in a hot air oven at a<br>
temperature of 130°C to dry and solidify the over-coat<br>
treating agent, to form a coating layer (second membrane)<br>
made of the over-coat treating agent, thereby to obtain a<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products of Example 2.<br>
Here, the deposited amount of the above second membrane<br>
was 4 mass% as solid content based on the mass of the<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
By using the same ring twisting machine and<br>
conditions as in Example 2, except for using a traveler<br>
having a weight lighter by 28.6% than the one used in<br>
Example 2, a plied yarn was obtained by subjecting 11<br>
twisted yarns obtained by the same method as in Example<br>
2, to plying while drawing them together. At that time,<br>
by using the traveler lighter than the one used in<br>
Example 2, the relation of the yarn count and the cross<br>
section of an obtainable glass fiber for reinforcing<br>
rubber products became out of the range of the above<br>
formula (1) (less than the lower limit value).<br><br>
Then, such a plied yarn was subjected to an over-<br>
coating process using the same treating agent and<br>
condition as in Example 2, to obtain the glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products of Example 3.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2<br>
Three cakes of glass fiber strands (200 glass<br>
filaments bundled, respectively) each having a mass of<br>
3,3 00 g were obtained in the same manner as in<br>
Comparative Example 1. The glass fiber for reinforcing<br>
rubber products of Comparative Example 2 was obtained in<br>
the same manner as in Example 2, except that from the<br>
respective portions where 200 g each of the glass fiber<br>
strand was removed respectively from the innermost<br>
sections of such three cakes (remaining mount of each<br>
cake: 3,100g), three glass fiber strands were pulled out<br>
and drawn together, and they were continuously immersed<br>
in a bath filled with the RFL treating agent to have the<br>
RFL treating agent deposited and impregnated to the glass<br>
fiber strands.<br>
TEST EXAMPLE 2<br>
With respect to the glass fiber for reinforcing<br>
rubber products obtained in each of the above Examples 2<br>
and 3 and Comparative Example 2, the yarn count and the<br>
tensile strength were measured, and a value obtained by<br>
dividing the tensile strength by the yarn count was used<br>
as an index for the physical strength. Further, the<br>
tensile strength after boiling treatment was measured,<br><br>
and a ratio (a retention before and after boiling)<br>
between a tensile strength at an original state and a<br>
tensile strength after the boiling treatment was<br>
calculated and was used as an index for water resistance.<br>
Further, the cross section was calculated by measuring<br>
the diameter of the glass fiber for reinforcing rubber<br>
products, and the yarn count was divided by the cross<br>
section, to obtain the relation between the cross section<br>
and the yarn count. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
METHOD FOR MEASURING TENSILE STRENGTH AT ORIGINAL STATE<br>
Using a tensile tester, the measurement of stress at<br>
break was carried out under such conditions that the<br>
chuck distance was 250 mm, and the tensile speed was 250<br>
mm/min.<br>
METHOD FOR MEASURING TENSILE STRENGTH AFTER BOILING<br>
TREATMENT<br>
The glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products was<br>
immersed in boiling deionized water for one hour, and<br>
then, it was immersed in deionized water at room<br>
temperature for five minutes to be cooled down. Water<br>
deposited on the surface of the glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products was lightly wiped off, and<br>
then, by using a tensile tester, the measurement of the<br>
stress at break was carried out under such conditions<br>
that the chuck distance was 250 mm, and the tensile speed<br>
was 250 mm/min.<br>
METHOD FOR MEASURING DIAMETER<br><br>
By using a constant pressure thickness tester, four<br>
glass fibers for reinforcing rubber products lined up in<br>
parallel without any space, were pressurized with a<br>
pressure of 226 g/cm2 for five seconds, and the thickness<br>
was measured as four of them lined. It was referred to<br>
as a diameter.<br><br><br>
As shown in Table 2, Examples 2 and 3 have higher<br>
tensile strengths as compared with Comparative Example 2.<br>
It is considered that, in Examples, the impregnation<br>
degree of the RFL treating agent to the glass fiber<br>
strand is good, and there is no fluctuation in tension<br>
during drawing a plurality of glass fiber strands<br>
together, like in the conventional technique.<br>
Further, it is evident that Example 2 wherein the<br>
relation of the yarn count and the cross section of the<br>
glass fiber for reinforcing rubber products, satisfies<br>
the above formula (1), is better in water resistance than<br>
Example 3 which does not satisfy the relation of the<br>
above formula (1). It is considered that the cohesion<br>
among twisted yarns constituting the glass fiber for<br>
reinforcing rubber products of Example 2 becomes higher,<br>
and penetration of water to inside of the fiber is<br>
prevented.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The reinforcing glass fiber of the present invention<br>
may be suitably used as a reinforcing material for<br>
various rubber products such as rubber tires or rubber<br>
belts including timing belts.<br>
