				<td>APPARATUS FOR INTEGRATED TOOL MANUFACTURE AND METHOD<br>
THEREFOR<br>
The invention relates to an apparatus for integrated<br>
tool manufacture and to a method for controlling a machine<br>
tool and an associated measuring device.<br>
For producing and grinding tools, tool grinding<br>
machines are often used in which one or more tools, such<br>
as grinding wheels, can be purposefully moved and rotated<br>
in multiple directions in space in order to generate<br>
complicated geometries, for instance of drills, milling<br>
cutters, step drills or the like. This is done by causing<br>
the corresponding grinding wheels to machine a blank, for<br>
which purpose the blank and/or the grinding wheels are<br>
moved along predetermined paths. The paths are generated<br>
by the superposition of motions of various driving and<br>
guiding devices. These devices are in turn controlled by<br>
a machine control program, such as an NC program.<br>
Generating suitable NC programs requires knowledge on the<br>
part of the user about the machine geometry and NC<br>
programming as well as a good capacity for thinking in<br>
three dimensions. While the NC programmer seeks to write<br>
a program in such a way that the moving grinding wheels<br>
create the shape specified by the scale drawing on the<br>
blank, he must specify the motion of the individual<br>
components (blank and grinding wheels) in increments which<br>
have no direct relationship with the drawing data.<br>
For the sake of quality control, measurements are<br>
often needed which might need to be performed<br>
automatically. This is done by measuring devices with<br>
tactile, optical or other kinds of measurement pickups.<br>
The measuring devices may be part of the grinding machine<br>
or may be in the form of a separate measuring machine.<br>
The motion of the specimen and the sensors, interrogating<br>
them, and processing the measured value must in turn be<br>
controlled by a measurement program which must be set up<br>
by the user.<br>
Changes in the grinding program (the NC program for<br>
controlling the grinding machine) in many cases also make<br>
it necessary to modify the measurement program. The user<br>
must assure both.<br>
US Patent 6,290,571 discloses a program system with<br>
which the setup of the NC program can be accomplished<br>
without detailed knowledge of machine geometry or NC<br>
programming. To that end, the image of a blank and the<br>
image of a grinding wheel or other grinding tool on a<br>
screen are moved relative to one another in such a way<br>
that the desired workpiece appears in virtual form on the<br>
screen. The workpiece or tool paths taken are plotted and<br>
converted into NC programs.<br>
Measuring the tools created in this way is a<br>
separate task, for which US Patent 6,290,571 offers no<br>
solution.<br>
With this as the point of departure, it is the<br>
object of the invention to create an apparatus for<br>
integrated tool manufacture.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to disclose a<br>
method for controlling a machine tool and an associated<br>
measuring device. Operating the apparatus and performing<br>
the method should be possible for a user without knowledge<br>
of programming languages.<br>
These objects are attained by an apparatus defined<br>
by claim 1 and by the corresponding method claim:<br>
The apparatus for integrated tool manufacture has an<br>
input module, with a preferably graphical user interface.<br>
The input module includes a display device or is<br>
connected to such a device. On this display device, a<br>
plurality of input windows and at least one display window<br>
can be opened. The input windows create access to a<br>
supply of input objects. Typically, input objects pertain<br>
to a machining operation. They can therefore be<br>
considered as machining objects and for instance define<br>
one complete machining operation. For instance, a<br>
grinding operation in which the grinding tool covers one<br>
complete positioning distance is a machining operation in<br>
the above sense. For instance, when a grinding wheel<br>
moves along a helical path on a cylindrical blank, a<br>
helical flute is obtained. Such a flute is one example of<br>
an input object. For instance, cutting edges of a tool<br>
are created by superimposing software objects, that is,<br>
input objects. The superposition is done by data<br>
processing in the same way as if the clearance created by<br>
the machining operation is taken away from a blank or a<br>
partly machined workpiece. This creates cutting edges or<br>
other body edges by subtracting the three-dimensional sum<br>
of all the machining objects from the blank. Body edges<br>
are then created, in the form of lines of intersection of<br>
input objects with the blank and lines of intersection<br>
between software objects superimposed on one another.<br>
Another example of input objects is flanks that are<br>
likewise generated by a relative motion between the<br>
grinding wheel and the workpiece. Finally, input objects<br>
thus always characterize a relative motion between a<br>
grinding wheel and a workpiece. These input objects are<br>
software objects and are selectable for instance via<br>
menus. At least one parameter or a set of parameters<br>
belongs to each input object, and with this parameter or<br>
set of parameters the length, depth, steepness, and other<br>
details of a flute or other details of some other input<br>
object are for instance defined. These input parameters<br>
are likewise assigned input windows or fields in the<br>
context of the input module, and these windows or fields<br>
make data acquisition possible. Thus the user can<br>
generate a workpiece on the screen on the basis of drawing<br>
data, without having to use a programming language. From<br>
the supply of input objects, he merely selects those input<br>
objects whose associated machining operations must be<br>
performed on the blank, and he parametrizes these objects.<br>
This is done by inserting values into masks on the<br>
screen.<br>
While the user in this way now generates a data set<br>
for describing the workpiece, he can actuate the inputs<br>
required for setting up the measurement program. To that<br>
end, the input module keeps a supply of measurement<br>
objects, that is, objects to be measured, in readiness<br>
from which measurement objects can be selected and<br>
parametrized. The parametrizing is done by linking<br>
measurement objects with input objects. As the<br>
measurement objects, inspection points can for instance be<br>
defined whose distance from the axis of rotation (radius),<br>
distance from other inspection points, distance from body<br>
edges, and so forth are detectable. Other measurement<br>
objects can for instance be angles, which are defined by<br>
inputting a plurality of inspection points, linear faces,<br>
or the like. The linkage between inspection points or<br>
other measurement objects with input objects can be done<br>
for instance by binding an inspection point with a body<br>
edge, such as a cutting edge. Once this linkage is<br>
defined, any change in the parametrizing of an input<br>
object that would cause a shift in the cutting edge at the<br>
same time causes a shift in the applicable inspection<br>
point which is bound to this cutting edge as well.<br>
The apparatus of the invention includes a display<br>
module for visually displaying an image of a tool<br>
resulting from the inputs, the tool serving here as a<br>
workpiece. The display module can cooperate with the same<br>
monitor as the input module. It can be fused with the<br>
input module to make a program module or can partly<br>
overlap the input module and share resources and/or<br>
routines. With the display module, the consistency and<br>
correctness of the inputs that have been made by selecting<br>
input objects and parametrizing them can be ascertained<br>
immediately and intuitively.<br>
A machining program module is also provided, which<br>
from the input objects and their parameters generates a<br>
machine control program, which can be transmitted to the<br>
grinding machine. This is an NC program generator.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention also<br>
includes a measurement program module, with which a<br>
measurement program is generated from the input objects<br>
and the measurement objects. Thus once the workpiece has<br>
been generated on the screen, not only is the NC machining<br>
program available, but parallel to it the NC measurement<br>
program as well. Both programs are consistent with one<br>
another, so that a sample workpiece produced can be<br>
automatically measured immediately.<br>
The linkage between the input module, the machining<br>
program module and the measurement program module is<br>
preferably done by way of a geometric model, which<br>
contains all the work instructions (data about work steps<br>
to be performed) and a mathematical representation of the<br>
outcome of the work (for instance, descriptions of surface<br>
structures of the workpiece in mathematical form or in the<br>
form of tables). The result is a data structure in which<br>
changes in the work instructions, for instance because of<br>
a change in the parametrizing of input objects,<br>
immediately leads to an adaptation of the measurement<br>
program as well.<br>
Further details of advantageous aspects of<br>
embodiments of the invention are the subject of dependent<br>
claims and will become apparent from the ensuing<br>
description and from the drawing. In the drawings<br>
exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated.<br>

In Fig. 1, a grinding machine 1 is shown for<br>
producing tools, such as drills, milling cutters and the<br>
like, which will thus be called workpieces here. The<br>
grinding machine 1 includes a workpiece holder 2, which<br>
can be supported in either fixed or movable fashion. It<br>
can be stationary or can be adjustable by means of an<br>
adjusting device in one or more directions in space.<br>
Associated with the workpiece 2 is a grinding head 3 with<br>
one or more grinding wheels. The grinding head 3 is<br>
movable and pivotable in multiple directions in space.<br>
The grinding wheel 4 is also driven to rotate.<br>
A machine control program 5 which has been created<br>
with a program generator 6 serves to control the motions<br>
of the grinding head 3 and/or the workpiece holder 2.<br>
This program also serves to set up a measurement program 7<br>
for a measuring device, for instance in the form of a<br>
measuring machine 8, with which a workpiece 9 machined by<br>
the grinding machine 1 is measured. To that end, the<br>
measuring machine 8 has a workpiece holder 11 and one or<br>
more measuring heads 12, which are movable spatially via a<br>
positioning device 13 in order to scan measurement points<br>
on the workpiece 9 and furnish measurement values<br>
accordingly.<br>
The measuring device can be embodied either, as<br>
shown, as a separate measuring machine 8 or as a component<br>
of the grinding machine 1.<br>
The program generator 6 includes an input module 14,<br>
which is used for acquisition of all the inputs required<br>
for setting up a machine control program and for setting<br>
up a measurement program. The inputting is done in<br>
object-oriented fashion using input objects 15, which can<br>
each be associated with individual machining operations.<br>
In this respect, see Fig. 6. This drawing shows a screen<br>
display 16, for instance on a PC or other computer<br>
provided in the grinding machine 2, on which computer the<br>
program generator 16 runs. The screen display 16, via a<br>
first input field 17, makes individual input objects of an<br>
object supply accessible. In Fig. 6, the input object<br>
"Clearance Step 2, Line" is for instance activated,, which<br>
is visible from the highlighted background of the<br>
applicable line. The rest of the input objects have the<br>
following meanings:<br>
Probing: Feeling the face end of the blank to<br>
detect the null point.<br>
Fluting: Creating flutes. This input object<br>
includes further details, which extend from Clearance Step<br>
1 through Clearance Ef. In the field captioned<br>
"Operation", still other input objects can be selected.<br>
Various tools can be associated with each input object.<br>
These can be selected under the input field captioned<br>
"Wheel". In Fig. 6, the selection has already been made<br>
and is shown in each respective line.<br>
Associated with the "Fluting" input object are input<br>
parameters which are primarily accessible in the input<br>
mask captioned "Clearance Step 2, Line". Input fields 18<br>
present here are used to parametrize the input object.<br>
Dimensions, ratios, and other input parameters can be<br>
input into the fields shown. In Fig. 1, this means that<br>
an input parameter supply 19 is associated with each input<br>
object in the input object supply 15.<br>
The input module 14 contemplates still other input<br>
possibilities. This purpose is served by a supply 21 of<br>
measurement objects, which are associated with links 22,<br>
selected input objects, and input parameters for them.<br>
For the sake of illustration, see Fig. 7. A measurement<br>
object can be a measurement parameter, an inspection<br>
point, an angle, or the like. In Fig. 7, a measurement<br>
parameter has been selected as the measurement object,<br>
namely the "Primary Clearance Width". The selection of<br>
this input parameter of a special input object as a<br>
measurement object at the same time is done by opening a<br>
menu 23 captioned "Measurement", which keeps various<br>
measurement objects in readiness. The menu 23 is disposed<br>
in a menu selection field 24, in which various workpiece<br>
profiles, grinding wheels, grinding machines and workpiece<br>
cross sections are held in readiness as a supply, in each<br>
case in subsidiary menus. The definition of the "Primary<br>
Clearance Width" as a measurement parameter is illustrated<br>
in Fig. 7 by the colored background of the input field<br>
and/or designation of the input parameter by a capital M<br>
next to it.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the input of inspection points as<br>
measurement objects. To that end, the "Measurement" menu<br>
is opened. In a display field of the screen display 16,<br>
the workpiece, configured by inputting input objects and<br>
their input parameters, is visually shown. By clicking on<br>
a mouse, inspection points A, B can now be set here and<br>
are reflected in the "Measurement" menu on the basis of<br>
their coordinates and radii. Via the "Measurement<br>
Function" menu, the function of the inspection points is<br>
defined. In the present case, distance and angle have<br>
been selected. Once the inspection points have been<br>
placed on body edges, the program assumes that they are to<br>
be bound to the edges. They are therefore linked with<br>
input objects, which either by themselves or jointly<br>
define the applicable edge. For the inspection point A,<br>
these are the input object for the adjacent chucking space<br>
and for the adjacent flank.<br>
The program generator 3 includes a machining program<br>
module 25. This module converts the data, acquired with<br>
the input module, into a machine control program. This is<br>
done by converting the parametrized input objects, each of<br>
which by itself already defines a relative motion between<br>
the workpiece and the grinding wheel, into NC data on the<br>
basis of the concrete geometry of the grinding machine<br>
selected. The program generator 6 also includes a<br>
modelling module. This module can be part of a display<br>
module 26 or can be connected to such a module. The<br>
display module 26 cooperates with the display field of the<br>
screen display 16. The modelling module generates a<br>
geometric model 27, which displays a representation of the<br>
workpiece to be created. The geometric model includes all<br>
the work instructions for the grinding machine 1 as well<br>
as a mathematical representation of the outcome of the<br>
work, that is, for instance, the completely machined<br>
workpiece. As an alternative to the above explanation,<br>
the display module 26 may be connected not to the<br>
modelling module but to the geometric model. The<br>
geometric model 27 forms the basis for setting up the<br>
measurement program 7. This purpose is served by a<br>
measurement program module 28, which combines data from<br>
the geometric model with data about the measurement task.<br>
The latter type of data are received by the measurement<br>
program module from the input module 14 on the basis of<br>
the defined measurement objects 21 and the associated link<br>
22. If for instance the flank between the inspection<br>
points A, B is present in defined form in the geometric<br>
model, and the measurement objects or in other words<br>
inspection points A, B and their evaluation are<br>
predetermined, for instance in the form of defining the<br>
radii and the angle enclosed, then the measurement program<br>
can predetermine the requisite position motions of the<br>
positioning device 13 and the evaluation of the data<br>
obtained as a result.<br>
In Fig. 2, a modified embodiment of the program<br>
generator 6 is shown in simplified form. The program<br>
structure has been modified such that the machining<br>
program module 25 operates on the basis of data present in<br>
the geometric model 27. The screen display 16 is also<br>
based on the data of the geometric model. The measurement<br>
program module 28, however, as usual combines data from<br>
the input module 14 with data from the geometric model 27<br>
to set up the measurement program 7 from them.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates one embodiment with a still more-<br>
centralized function of the geometric model 27. Here, the<br>
geometric model contains not only data about a three-<br>
dimensional presentation of the workpiece to be created<br>
but also data about the machining operations to be<br>
performed and also data about the measuring operations to<br>
be executed. These data have been taken from the input<br>
module 14. Both the machining program module 25 and the<br>
measurement program module 28 operate on the basis of the<br>
geometric model 27. Any change in the input parameters of<br>
the measurement objects or the links of the measurement<br>
objects with input objects or parameters thereof thus has<br>
an effect on the geometric model and beyond it on both the<br>
machine control program 5 and the measurement program 7.<br>
The screen display 16 is furthermore adapted<br>
synchronously. For the screen display 16 in Figs. 6- 8,<br>
this means for instance that after inspection points A, B<br>
have been placed using the screen display 16, they are<br>
input into the geometric model. If the user now, for<br>
instance in the menu shown in Fig. 6, changes one input<br>
parameter value, such as "Primary Clearance Width" from 1<br>
mm to 2 mm, then the appropriate screen display<br>
immediately appears - at least if thus-modified machining<br>
is within the realm of the possible. The area shown<br>
highlighted in Fig. 8 then becomes correspondingly wider.<br>
The inspection points A, B are now once again located on<br>
the applicable edges and are farther away from one<br>
another. In the menu shown in Fig. 8, displayed values<br>
change, for instance in the "Measured Distance" field.<br>
In this respect it should be noted in particular<br>
that the parametrized input objects show or describe<br>
machining operations. Since machining operations can be<br>
superimposed on one another, the parameters of the input<br>
objects only indirectly define the geometry of the<br>
workpiece. This becomes clear if the flank bounded by the<br>
inspection points A, B and shown in light colors in Figs.<br>
6-8, is looked at. The input object that characterizes<br>
this flank defines the three-dimensional distance along<br>
which the grinding wheel is guided. The boundary in terms<br>
of the cutting edge of this flank, however, is defined by<br>
the input object captioned "Chucking Space", because its<br>
parameters state how much material is removed at the<br>
cutting edge, or in other words where it is located<br>
precisely. The flank width, which is defined by the<br>
distance of the inspection points A, B from one another,<br>
is thus not purely an input value; instead, it results in<br>
the course of the machining. The interplay of the<br>
machining program module 2 5 and the measurement program<br>
module 28 on the basis of a common geometric model 27<br>
makes it possible not only to visualize these effects and<br>
interdependencies of individual machining operations on<br>
the screen, but also to generate the associated<br>
measurement program.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate the generation of the<br>
machine control program 5 and the measurement program 7<br>
once again, from a different standpoint:<br>
By suitable menu input, the type of tool to be<br>
created is first selected. This is done for instance in<br>
the "Profiles" menu in Figs. 6-8. This also includes<br>
defining the number of teeth, according to which card file<br>
cards with input fields 18 (in the example of Figs. 6-8,<br>
four file cards for four teeth) are accordingly created.<br>
This applies to the event, shown at the top left in Fig. 4<br>
in a round field, according to which the chip space<br>
(flute), for instance, or a new operation is input. Next,<br>
parametrizing of the applicable input object is performed,<br>
initially with standard values, which as becomes visible<br>
in the next field can be modified by the user.<br>
In the next step, the measurement program module<br>
(Figs. 1, 2 or 3) generates the track that a grinding<br>
wheel leaves behind in a space in its motion pertaining to<br>
the selected, parametrized input object. The track of the<br>
grinding wheel is stored in memory and in the next central<br>
step is subtracted from the blank or from an already<br>
partly machined tool. The result is the geometric model<br>
of a workpiece on which the most recently input operation<br>
has been performed. This process is repeated as many<br>
times as needed until all the input operations have been<br>
performed virtually on the workpiece, or in other words<br>
until the geometric model for a workpiece with all the<br>
material subtractions to be performed according to the<br>
input objects has been created. Once this model is<br>
available and has been checked and verified, the NC<br>
program is generated from it and transmitted to the<br>
grinding machine and executed in the grinding machine.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a diagram, also event-oriented, of the<br>
data flow in setting up a measurement program. The point<br>
of departure is the finished geometric model for the tool.<br>
It is also assumed that the user, in setting up the tool<br>
on the screen has not yet placed any measurement or<br>
inspection points. If he wants to do this now, then the<br>
event captioned "Add Measurement Parameters" appears when<br>
the user selects a measurement parameter. This<br>
information about the measurement parameter is added to<br>
the geometric model. This process can be repeated<br>
virtually arbitrarily often, to add various measurement<br>
parameters to the geometric model.<br>
Another possibility of predetermining measurements<br>
is to specify inspection points and their significance.<br>
This is illustrated in the left center of Fig. 5. The<br>
inputting is once again done by means of the masks in Fig.<br>
8. The information obtained is added to the geometric<br>
model. Once the geometric model has been finally<br>
supplemented with all the measurement parameters and<br>
inspection points, the measurement program is generated<br>
from the three-dimensional geometric model completed to<br>
this point and is transmitted to the measuring machine.<br>
