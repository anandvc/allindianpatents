INSECT REPELLENT COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESSES OF PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
MRS. WANKHEDKAR MAHALAXMIKAMLAKAR<br>
an Indian National <br>
of C/8, Kadamgiri, Opp.Baroda Bank, Kandivali (E), Mumbai 400 101,<br>
Maharashtra, India,<br><br>
THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES<br>
THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to insect repellent compositions and processes of preparation thereof.<br>
Still particularly this invention relates to non-synthetic insect repellent fumigant compositions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Insects are known to cause extensive damage to mankind, animals and plants.<br>
There are well over 1 million different known species of insects in the world, and it is estimated that there might be as many as 10 million.<br>
Many insects transmit bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other disease causing pathogens to animals and human beings.<br>
Insects such as mosquitoes are responsible for transmitting several diseases such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue, viral encephalitis and the like.<br>
Apart from causing extreme physical discomfort and mental agony they cause severe loss in terms of productive time, money and other resources.<br>
Several approaches have been used to reduce insect aggravation.<br>
Some of them include smoky fires, spreading mud and dust over the body to repel biting<br>
and tickling insects etc.<br>
But these crude methods often result in skin irritations such as rashes and other symptoms such as burning, itching, allergy and the like.<br>
To overcome these drawbacks several insecticides were developed most of which were made of synthetic chemicals.<br>
2<br><br>
Chemical insect repellent compositions commonly used to get rid of insects such as mosquitoes and their effects on human beings are discussed below:<br>
DDT (dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane) -This is a poison that can kill any living creature, including humans, and can cause sterility. It does potentially irreparable damage to the environment. While DDT is a useful tool in fighting malaria, its side effects are dangerous and it is considered as a potential cancer-causing agent.<br>
DEET (N, N-diethyl-3-methylbenzamide) -This is a chemical that can cause rashes, swelling and eye irritation. They are also suspected to cause brain swelling in children, anaphylactic shock and low blood pressure.<br>
Out of the chemical insect repellent fumigants commonly sold and used, allethrin and other synthetic pyrethroids are important ingredients in most compositions (those belonging to the same family include- d-Allethrin, Bioallethrin, Bioresmethrin, S-Bioallethrin, Cypermethrin, Deltamethrin, Fenothrin, Tetramethrinand the like).<br>
A study done by Industrial toxicology research center, Lucknow, India reports that allethrin the chemical used in most repellents is reported to be dangerous, being potentially harmful to the skin, eyes, respiratory tract and the nervous system. A study done on rats showed that the rats suffered from brain, lever and kidney damage after prolonged exposure to liquid repellents.<br>
There are also reports of studies in USA and Sweden that long term usage of allethrin could cause- brain damage, blood cancer and damage to the human fetus.<br>
The various forms in which chemical and other insect repellents are commonly employed are:<br>
Creams -They are applied directly over the body. The creams contain chemicals, which repel the mosquitoes. However they are not very popular, as the creams are rather sticky and inconvenient to use.<br>
3<br><br>
Coils - They are made by mixing chemicals with substances like coconut shell powder, sawdust, color, perfumes and synthetic or natural gums. The coils burn slowly, releasing the chemicals.<br>
Mats - They have a composition similar to coils; the mats are placed in a small heater, which is plugged into an electrical socket. When the mat is heated, the chemicals are released providing relief from mosquitoes.<br>
Sprays - These are chemicals in liquid form, sprayed in the area infested with mosquitoes. They are not very popular because of the strong smell of the chemicals.<br>
Vaporizers - They make use of small containers of a chemical solution, which is heated gently in an electrically operated apparatus, maintaining a constant temperature. The vapors of the chemicals released offer protection from mosquitoes.<br>
Chemical insect repellent fumigants also have other disadvantages.<br>
&gt;	They cause increased environmental pollution.<br>
&gt;	The chemical insecticides used to control insect pests may also directly or indirectly harm other components of the ecosystem such as birds, animals, and other useful life forms.<br>
&gt;	In addition the insects tend to be become immune to the effect of the chemicals over a period of time.<br>
However herbal insect repellent preparations do not commonly have any of the disadvantages described for their chemical counter parts.<br>
They have the added advantage of providing protection from insects without being fowl smelling, without causing damage to the environment and human beings.<br>
The use of herbs for protection against insects and in the treatment of insect bites is an age-old concept. The use of herb-based insecticides is well known and has been discussed in depth in ancient Indian scriptures of Ayurveda such as Charak Samhita and Susruta Samhita etc.<br>
4<br><br>
Insect repellent compositions can formulated in various ways and used / released in ways such as sprays, baits, slow-release diffusion, coils etc.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Several herb based insect repellent /insecticidal compositions have also been disclosed in prior art:<br>
US Patent No. 5,372,817 discloses an insecticidal composition derived from neem oil and neem wax fractions. The insect repellent composition is obtained using a non-polar, hydrophobic solvent. Neem seed extracts, which are substantially free of azadirachtin, are obtained by concentrating the hydrophobic solvent extract and cooling the resulting neem oil to separate a semi-solid neem wax fraction and a clarified neem oil fraction.<br>
US Patent No. 5,405,612 discloses an insecticide derived fiom a neem seed extract comprising neem oil, which is substantially free of azadirachtin. The said neem oil being prepared by extracting dried, coarsely ground neem seeds with a non-polar, hydrophobic solvent.<br>
CN 1104852A describes an insecticidal composition, composed of 6 traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. The constituents are- lemongrass 10-15%, Eugenia caryophyllata 10-15%, L. foenum graecum 40-50%, pine needle 5-10%, flue-cured tobacco 5-10% and perpermint 5-10%. The above-mentioned medicinal herbs are ground into a powder. To the powder mixture the solution of carboxy methyl cellulose is sprayed uniformly and stirred thoroughly. The invention is safe, non-toxic, does not contaminate clothing and other articles of daily use and environment. The insecticide has a wide range of applications, and is capable of effectively preventing moth or any other insect that eat books, clothes etc. and mildew.<br>
Indian Patent IN0187100 reveals a process for the preparation of insecticidal formulation comprising of neem seed kernel extract.<br>
5<br><br>
However all the inventions described in the prior art either describe the use of herbal ingredient which are mostly liquid compositions with limited applications. Liquid compositions have comparatively lesser dispersibility as compared to fumigant compositions and tend to leave stains or coatings on the surfaces they are used in.<br>
Therefore the need was felt for broad-spectrum herbal insect repellent compositions:<br>
&gt;	Which have higher dispensability as compared to liquid compositions and can effortlessly reach every nook and corner in the area it is used.<br>
&gt;	Which do not moisten surfaces when they are used.<br>
&gt;	Which do not leave sediments or residual spots in the areas they are used.<br>
&gt;	Which could provide relief from insects besides being pleasant smelling and safe for human exposure.<br>

EXAMPLES:<br>
EXAMPLE-1:<br>
A mixture of Litsea chinensis bark 20 grams was mixed with charcoal fine powder 10<br>
grams to which was added 8 grams of camphor.<br>
To the above mixture was added sixty grams of Eucalyptus globulus leaf powder and<br>
two grams of concentrated eucalyptus oil. All the above were homogenously blended<br>
together to give a sticky paste weighing sixty two grams. Dispensed quantities of water<br>
were added as and when needed while blending. The mixture so obtained was applied to<br>
20 cane splints, rolled and allowed to dry in shade. The dried incense sticks were<br>
wrapped in clean butter paper covers and sealed. The composition gave excellent results<br>
in driving away mosquitoes, flies and other flying insects.<br>
The incense sticks were light green in color.<br>
The incense sticks had a pleasing, soothing aroma.<br>
