Surprisingly, it has been found that polyolefin substrates are made scatch resistance by the incorporation therein of an additive combination of a maleated alpha-olefin functionalized with a long chain alcohol or long chain amine and a primary or secondary fatty acid amide.<br>
The present invention pertains to a composition comprising<br>
a)	a polyolefin,<br>
b)	a maleated alpha-olefin functionalized with a long chain alcohol or long chain amine,<br>
and<br>
c)	a primary or secondary fatty acid amide.<br>
Also disclosed is a method for providing scratch resistance to a polyolefin substrate, which method comprises incorporating into said polyolefin an effective amount of (b) a maleated alpha-olefin functionalized with a long chain alcohol or long chain amine and (c) a primary or secondary fatty acid amide.<br>
Examples for polyolefins are:<br>
1. Polymers of monoolefins and diolefins, for example polypropylene, polyisobutylene, po-lybut-1-ene, poly-4-methylpent-1-ene, polyisoprene or polybutadiene, as well as polymers of cycloolefins, for instance of cyclopentene or norbornene, polyethylene (which optionally can be crosslinked), for example high density polyethylene (HDPE), high density and high molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-HMW), high density and ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (HDPE-UHMW), medium density polyethylene (MDPE), low density polyethylene (LDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE), (VLDPE) and (ULDPE).<br>
Polyolefins, i.e. the polymers of monoolefins exemplified in the preceding paragraph, for example polyethylene and polypropylene, can be prepared by different, and especially by the following, methods:<br>
i) radical polymerization (normally under high pressure and at elevated temperature).<br><br>
ii) catalytic polymerization using a catalyst that normally contains one or more than one metal of groups IVb, Vb, Vlb or VIM of the Periodic Table. These metals usually have one or more than one ligand, typically oxides, halides, alcoholates, esters, ethers, amines, alkyls, alkenyls and/or aryls that may be either p- or s-coordinated. These metal complexes may be in the free form or fixed on substrates, typically on activated magnesium chloride, titanium(lll) chloride, alumina or silicon oxide. These catalysts may be soluble or insoluble in the polymerization medium. The catalysts can be used by themselves in the polymerization or further activators may be used, typically metal alkyls, metal hydrides, metal alkyl halides, metal alkyl oxides or metal alkyloxanes, said metals being elements of groups la, Ha and/or Ilia of the Periodic Table. The activators may be modified conveniently with further ester, ether, amine or silyl ether groups. These catalyst systems are usually termed Phillips, Standard Oil Indiana, Ziegler (-Natta), TNZ (DuPont), metallocene or single site catalysts (SSC).<br>
2.	Mixtures of the polymers mentioned under 1.), for example mixtures of polypropylene with<br>
polyisobutylene, polypropylene with polyethylene (for example PP/HDPE, PP/LDPE) and mix<br>
tures of different types of polyethylene (for example LDPE/HDPE).<br>
3.	Copolymers of monoolefins and diolefins with each other or with other vinyl monomers,<br>
for example ethylene/propylene copolymers, linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and<br>
mixtures thereof with low density polyethylene (LDPE), propylene/but-1-ene copolymers, pro-<br>
pylene/isobutylene copolymers, ethylene/but-1-ene copolymers,  ethylene/hexene copoly<br>
mers, ethylene/methylpentene copolymers, ethylene/heptene copolymers, ethylene/octene<br>
copolymers, propylene/butadiene copolymers, isobutylene/isoprene copolymers, ethylene/-<br>
alkyl acrylate copolymers, ethylene/alkyl methacrylate copolymers, ethylene/vinyl acetate<br>
copolymers and their copolymers with carbon monoxide or ethylene/acrylic acid copolymers<br>
and their salts (ionomers) as well as terpolymers of ethylene with propylene and a diene such<br>
as hexadiene, dicyclopentadiene or ethylidene-norbornene;   and mixtures of such copoly<br>
mers with one another and with polymers mentioned in 1) above, for example polypropy-<br>
lene/ethylene-propylene copolymers, LDPE/ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers (EVA), LDPE/-<br>
ethylene-acrylic acid copolymers (EAA), LLDPE/EVA, LLDPE/EAA and alternating or random<br>
polyalkylene/carbon monoxide copolymers and mixtures thereof with other polymers, for<br>
example polyamides.<br><br>
4. Blends of polymers mentioned under 1.) with impact modifiers such as ethylene-propy-lene-diene monomer copolymers (EPDM), copolymers of ethylene with higher alpha-olefins (such as ethylene-octene copolymers), polybutadiene, polyisoprene, styrene-butadiene copolymers, hydrogenated styrene-butadiene copolymers, styrene-isoprene copolymers, hydrogenated styrene-isoprene copolymers. These blends are commonly referred to in the industry as TPO's (thermoplastic polyolefins).<br>
Polyolefins of the present invention are for example polypropylene or polyethylene including polypropylene homo- and copolymers and polyethylene homo- and copolymers. For instance, polypropylene, high density polyethylene (HDPE), linear low density polyethylene (LLDPE) and polypropylene random and impact (heterophasic) copolymers. Preferred polyolefins of the present invention include polypropylene homopolymers, polypropylene impact (heterophasic) copolymers, blends thereof, and TPO's such as blends of polypropylene homopolymers and impact copolymers with EPDM or ethylene-alpha-olefin copolymers.<br>
The polyolefins of this invention are in particular TPO's. TPO is for example about 10 to about 90 parts propylene homopolymer, copolymer or terpolymer, and about 90 to about 10 parts (parts by weight) of an elastomeric copolymer of ethylene and a C3-C8 alpha-olefin. TPO is disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,048,942.<br>
The maleated alpha-olefin is for example as disclosed in U.S. app. 2003/0004245. The maleated alpha-olefin is for example a reaction product of an alpha-olefin with maleic anhydride or maleic acid. The reaction is effected by means known in the art. For example, the reaction can be conducted by a melt process in the presence of a free radical initiator. The radical initiators are for example peroxides or organic azo compounds.<br>
For instance, the alpha-olefin of the present maleated alpha-olefin is from C3 up to about C33, for example the alpha-olefin is a C18-C26 alpha-olefin, for example a C22-C26 or a C18 alpha-olefin.<br>
The maleated alpha-olefin is functionalized with a long chain alcohol or long chain amine. That is, the maleated alpha-olefin is reacted with a long chain alcohol or long chain amine to form the ester or amide or imide products.<br><br>
For example, the present functionalized maleated alpha-olefin is an ester or half ester product resulting from reaction with a long chain alcohol, or is an amide or imide product resulting from reaction with a long chain primary or secondary amine. Imides may be prepared by heating the half amide. The present functionalized maleated alpha-olefin may be a mixture of esters and amides.<br>
Half ester derivatives may be formed by dropwise addition of alcohol to a stirred, acid catalyzed solution of the maleated alpha-olefin in an appropriate solvent under conditions such that water is not removed from the reaction mixture. Appropriate solvent is for example methyl isobutyl ketone. Suitable acid catalysts include sulfuric acid, methanesulfonic acid, and p-toluenesulfonic acid. Diesters are prepared using excess alcohol and removing the water to drive the reaction towards full esterification.<br>
For instance, the functionalized maleated alpha-olefin is an ester or half ester of the formula<br><br>
wherein<br>
R is C16-C24alkyl,<br>
R and R2 are independently hydrogen, CrC22alkyl or C2-C22alkenyl wherein at least one of<br>
R1 and R2 are C12-C22alkyl or alkenyl, and<br>
n is an integer such that the average molecular weight is between about 20,000 and about<br>
50,000.<br>
For example, the present functionalized maleated alpha-olefins are primary or secondary amides of the formula<br><br><br><br>
For instance, the present functionalized maleatecl alpha-olefin is the half ester or ester of maleated C18-C26alpha-olefin with tallow fatty alcohol, ricinoleyl alcohol [CAS# 540-11-4] or oleyl alcohol. That is, the half ester or ester reaction products of maleated alpha-olefin with the long chain alcohols.<br>
For instance, the present functionalized maleated alpha-olefin is the amide of maleated C18-C2ealpha-olefin with oleamide, erucamide, stearamide, behenamide, oleyl palmitamide, stearyl erucamide, ethylene-bis-stearamide or ethylene-bis-oleamide, or is the imide of maleated C18-C26alpha-olefin with oleamide, erucamide, stearamide or behenamide. That is, the amide or imide reaction products of maleated alpha-olefin with long chain amines.<br>
The fatty group of the primary or secondary fatty acid amides are Cn-C2ialkyl or Cn-C2ialke-nyl. The present secondary fatty acid amides are not bis amides, that is methylene-bis or ethylene-bis amides.<br>
The primary or secondary fatty acid amide is for example at least one compound selected from the group consisting of oleamide, erucamide, stearamide, behenamide, oleyl palmitamide and stearyl erucamide.<br>
In particular, the present fatty acid amides are secondary fatty acid amides, for example stearyl erucamide or oleyl palmitamide.<br>
Suitable fatty acid amides are for example disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,228,915.<br>
Alkyl is straight or branched chain and is for example methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, sec-butyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl, 2-ethylbutyl, n-pentyl, isopentyl, 1-methylpentyl, 1,3-dimethyl-butyl, n-hexyl, 1-methylhexyl, n-heptyl, isoheptyl, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylbutyl, 1-methylheptyl, 3-methylheptyl, n-octyl, 2-ethylhexyl, 1,1,3-trimethylhexyl, 1,1,3,3-tetramethylpentyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, 1-methylundecyl, dodecyl, 1,1,3,3,5,5-hexamethylhexyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, icosyl ordocosyl.<br>
Alkenyl having 2 to 22 carbon atoms is a branched or unbranched radical such as, for example, vinyl, propenyl (allyl), 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, isobutenyl, n-2,4-pentadienyl, 3-methyl-<br><br>
2-butenyl,n-2-octenyl,n-2-dodecenyl, iso-dodecenyl, oleyl, n-2-octadecenyl or n-4-octade-cenyl.<br>
The weight:weight ratio of the functionalized maleated alpha-olefin additive [component (b)] to the primary or secondary fatty acid amide additive [component (c)] is for example between about 1:1 and about 20:1, for example between about 1:1 and about 15:1, between about 1:1 and about 10:1, between about 1:1 and about 7:1, or between about 1:1 and about 5:1. For instance, the weight:weight ration of the functionalized maleated alpha-olefin to the primary or secondary fatty acid amide is about 1.5:1, about 2:1, about 3:1, or about 4:1.<br>
The total of functionalized maleated alpha-olefin and primary or secondary fatty acid amide additive combination to be incorporated into the polyolefin substrate is for example between about 1% and about 15% by weight, based on the weight of the polyolefin substrate. For example, the additive combination is present from about 1% to about 10%, from about 3% to about 7%, or from about 3% to about 5% by weight, based on the weight of the polyolefin substrate.<br>
Component (b) is preferably added to the polyolefin in an amount of from 0.05 to 15 %, in particular from 1 to 10 %, for example from 1 to 7%, based on the weight of the polyolefin.<br>
Component (c) is preferably added to the polyolefin in an amount of from 0.05 to 15 %, in particular from 1 to 10 %, for example from 1 to 7%, based on the weight of the polyolefin.<br>
The additives of the invention may be added to the polyolefin substrate individually or mixed with one another. If desired, the individual components can be mixed with one another before incorporation into the polyolefin for example by dry blending, compaction or in the melt.<br>
The incorporation of the additives of the invention is carried out by known methods such as dry blending in the form of a powder, or wet mixing in the form of solutions, dispersions or suspensions for example in an inert solvent, water or oil. The additives of the invention may be incorporated, for example, before or after molding or also by applying the dissolved or dispersed additive or additive mixture to the polyolefin material, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent or the suspension/dispersion agent. They may be added directly<br><br>
into the processing apparatus (e.g. extruders, internal mixers, etc), e.g. as a dry mixture or powder or as solution or dispersion or suspension or melt.<br>
The incorporation can be carried out in any heatable container equipped with a stirrer, e.g. in a closed apparatus such as a kneader, mixer or stirred vessel. The incorporation is preferably carried out in an extruder or in a kneader. It is immaterial whether processing takes place in an inert atmosphere or in the presence of oxygen.<br>
The addition of the additives to the polyolefin substrate can be carried out in all customary mixing machines in which the polyolefin is melted and mixed with the additives. Suitable machines are known to those skilled in the art. They are predominantly mixers, kneaders and extruders.<br>
Processing includes extrusion, co-kneading, pultrusion, compression molding, sheet extrusion, thermoforming, injection molding or rotational molding. The process is preferably carried out in an extruder by introducing the additives during processing.<br>
Particularly preferred processing machines are single-screw extruders, contrarotating and corotating twin-screw extruders, rotomolding devices, planetary-gear extruders, ring extruders or cokneaders. It is also possible to use processing machines provided with at least one gas removal compartment to which a vacuum can be applied.<br>
Suitable extruders and kneaders are described, for example, in Handbuch der Kunststoffex-trusion, Vol. 1 Grundlagen, Editors F. Hensen, W. Knappe, H. Potente, 1989, pp. 3-7, ISBN.3-446-14339-4 (Vol. 2 Extrusionsanlagen 1986, ISBN 3-446-14329-7).<br>
For example, the screw length is 1-60 screw diameters, preferably 35-48 screw diameters. The rotational speed of the screw is preferably 10-600 rotations per minute (rpm), very particularly preferably 25-300 rpm.<br>
The maximum throughput is dependent on the screw diameter, the rotational speed and the driving force. The process of the present invention can also be carried out at a level lower than maximum throughput by varying the parameters mentioned or employing weighing machines delivering dosage amounts.<br><br>
If a plurality of components are added, these can be premixed or added individually.<br>
The additives of the invention can also be sprayed onto the polyolefin material. They are able to dilute other additives (for example optional conventional additives) or their melts so that they can be sprayed also together with these additives onto the material. Addition by spraying during the deactivation of the polymerization catalysts is particularly advantageous; in this case, the steam evolved may be used for deactivation of the catalyst. In the case of spherically polymerized polyolefins it may, for example, be advantageous to apply the additives of the invention, optionally together with other additives, by spraying.<br>
The additives of the invention and optional further additives can also be added to the polyolefin in the form of a masterbatch ("concentrate") which contains the components in a concentration of, for example, about 1% to about 40% and preferably about 2% to about 20% by weight incorporated in a polymer. The polymer must not necessarily be identical to the polyolefin where the additives are added finally. In such operations, the polymer can be used in the form of powder, granules, solutions, suspensions or in the form of latices.<br>
Incorporation can take place prior to or during the shaping operation, or by applying the dissolved or dispersed compound to the polyolefin, with or without subsequent evaporation of the solvent. A further possibility for incorporating the additives of the invention into polyolefins is to add them before, during or directly after the polymerization of the corresponding monomers or prior to crosslinking. In this context the additives of the invention can be added as it is or else in encapsulated form (for example in waxes, oils or polymers).<br>
The polyolefins containing the additives of the invention described herein can be used for the production of moldings, rotomolded articles, injection molded articles, blow molded articles, profiles, and the like.<br>
The polyolefins of the present invention may optionally also contain from about 0.01 to about 5%, preferably from about 0.025 to about 2%, and especially from about 0.1 to about 1% by weight of various further additives, such as the compouns listed below, or mixtures thereof.<br>
