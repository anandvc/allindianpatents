"A METHOD OF INTRODUCING MULTIPLE CATALYSTS INTO A CONTINUOUS GAS PHASE REACTOR OR A CONTINUOUS SLURRY PHASE<br>
REACTOR"<br>
UNIVATION TECHNOLOGIES LLC, a Delaware company, of Suite 1950, 5555 San Felipe, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America,<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method of introducing multiple catalysts into a continuous gas phase reactor or a continuous slurry phase reactor.<br>
FIELD OF  THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to methods to introduce multiple catalysts into a gas or slurry phase reactor, particularly for start-up of the reactor.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Lately in the art, there have been attempts to produce two polymers together at the same time in the same reactor using two different catalysts. For example, Mobil in PCT patent application WO 99/03899, discloses using a metallocene type catalyst and a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst in the same reactor to produce a bimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD) high-density polyethylene (HDPE). However, running two catalysts at once can be difficult and the start up of a multiple catalyst system can likewise be difficult. Therefore there is a need in the art for start-up procedures for running multiple catalyst systems.<br>
US Serial Number 09/451,792, (Attorney Docket No. 1999U034.US) entitled Solution Feed of Multiple Catalysts, filed December 1,1999, discloses, the use of multiple catalysts in gas and slurry phase to produce olefins.<br>
US serial number 09/312,878 filed May 17, 1999, (Attorney Docket No. 1999U019:US) discloses a gas or slurry phase polymerization process using a supported bisamide catalyst.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to methods to introduce multiple catalysts into a gas or slurry phase reactor comprising:<br>
(a)       introducing one or more olefins and a first catalyst and an activator into the reactor and allowing the olefins to polymerize,<br>
.(b)       obtaining a polyolefin,<br>
(c)       combining a second catalyst and an optional activator with the first catalyst and activator and thereafter introducing the combination into the reactor and allowing the olefins to polymerize,<br><br>
1999U036<br>
In an alternate embodiment step (b) comprises determining whether or not the polyolefin produced in step (a) is a desired polyolefin, and if it is not altering one or more reaction conditions and repeating this step (b),<br>
In another embodiment this invention also relates to a method to introduce multiple catalysts into a gas or slurry phase reactor comprising introducing one or more olefins, a first catalyst and an activator, and a second catalyst and an optional activator into the reactor, wherein the all the catalysts and activators are combined together prior to being introduced into the reactor. In a preferred embodiment, catalysts and activator(s) are introduced into the reactor in a liquid, preferably a solution, slurry or emulsion.<br>
	In additional embodiments, hydrogen is also introduced into the reactor during<br>
step (a). Preferably the hydrogen concentration present in the reactor or gas recycle stream is measured when the desired polyolefin of step (b) is produced and then the hydrogen concentration is not altered during step (c) to be more than 50% more or less than the concentration measured when the desired polyolefin of step (b) is produced.<br>
     Preferably the hydrogen concentration is not altered during step (c) to be more than 40% preferably not more than 30%, more preferably not more than 20%, more preferably not more than 10% more or less than the concentration measured when the polyolefin of step (b) is produced.<br>
In another preferred embodiment when the polyolefin produced during step (c) is not a desired polyolefin, then the ratio of the first catalyst to the second catalyst introduced into the,reactor can be altered.<br>
In another embodiment the method described above further comprises introducing a third catalyst (or more) and, optionally an activator into the reactor. This may optionally be done after determining whether the polyolefin produced in step (c) is a<br>
2 5     desired polyolefin and if it is not then altering one or more reaction conditions until the desired polyolefin is produced. In an alternate embodiment step (c) further comprises additional catalyst.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a catalyst system, that is capable of producing polyethylene, preferably a bi-modal or broad MWD polyethylene, where the catalyst system includes two or more different catalysts. Preferably, the two or more catalysts have differing, and more preferably greatly differing, hydrogen and/or comonomer responses. One or more activators are generally also present in the system in order to activate the catalysts. Various activation and feed schemes examples are presented below. In preferred embodiments of the invention, a first catalyst produces a resin with a low molecular weight (this catalyst is referred to as the low molecular weight 1 j)     catalyst), and a second catalyst produces a resin with a high molecular weight (this catalyst is referred to as the high molecular weight catalyst). These catalysts coexist in the same reactor to produce a resin with an overall broad or bimodal molecular weight distribution. The multiple catalysts and/or activators are preferably combined together then introduced into the reactor.<br>
For purposes of this invention a "catalyst" is a metal compound that polymerizes olefins alone or in combination with an activator. A "catalyst system" is the combination of a catalyst and an activator. The term "activator" is used interchangeably with the term "co-catalyst."<br>
     Start-Up Methods For Bimodal Systems Utilizing Solution Feed With Two Catalysts<br>
Although the following examples discuss the production of polyethylene (PE) produced with multiple catalysts, preferably solution catalysts, the applicability to any polyolefin produced with more than two catalysts is also recognized.   Typically, the polyolefins produced have broad, bimodal or multimodal molecular weight distributions (MWD's). The start-up procedures discussed below are also applicable to all polymerizable monomers and mixtures of such monomers such as propylene, ethylene/propylene, styrene and polar monomers.<br>
The following reactor start-up techniques are described in relation to a solution catalyst feed system, but can be applicable to emulsion, slurry, liquid, powdered, and/or supported catalyst systems. The following start-up techniques are applicable to any of the<br><br>
activation and feed schemes presented below.   The following methods are preferably used when the reactor is at a point where catalyst feed is ready to be initiated.<br>
One problem that occurs with the operation of two resin components in the same reactor is that frequently the resin properties of one of the components needs to be fixed. For instance, many times the Melt Index (MI), which is an indirect measurement of the molecular weight, of the low molecular weight (LMW) resin is desired to be within a certain range. With two resin components being simultaneously formed in the same reactor, direct measurement of the LMW resin MI (or HMW resin Flow Index) is difficult. Often times catalyst poisons or analyzer shifts can cause a significant amount of 1(}     resin to be produced with the wrong LMW or HMW properties.<br>
Additionally one should also consider that when a gas phase reactor is first started, reaction rates come on slowly as an inventory of catalyst is built in the reactor. As may be expected, the residence time changes from start-up to steady state operation. For a bimodal catalyst system, the residence time or STY directly affects the final product properties, such as flow index (I21). This is believed to be because, in most cases, the catalyst kinetics are different. Additionally we have noted that catalysts with different kinetic constants and/or half-lives can, in combination with residence time effects, cause a shift in the polymer product made. To compensate, or more preferably control, these variations, on-line control to feed catalysts and /or activators into the reactor at differing rates and/or volumes is preferred.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the multiple catalysts have identical or nearly identical kinetic behavior. In a preferred embodiment, the kinetic profiles or half-lives are within 50% or less of each other, preferably 40% or each other, preferably with 30% of each other, more preferably within 10% of each other.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the following start-up methods may be used.<br>
Method 1.<br>
A first start-up method applicable to a solution catalysts involves starting one catalyst and cocatalyst feed prior to starting the second catalyst feed. This first method allows for the determination of the reactor conditions necessary to produce the correct LMW or HMW resin component. In this method, either the low molecular weight<br><br>
catalyst (LMWC) or the high molecular weight catalyst (HMWC) can be started first. Preferrably the LMWC is started first since material produced on direct start-ups on the HMWC can cause significant gels in film blown from the resin (typically, a two or more component resin). Once the correct reactor gas conditions are known (or possibly may be 				   known in advance of the start-up), the second catalyst component can be started after reaction is seen from the first component. If the kinetic parameters of the catalysts are known for the production of a particular polymer, the catalysts feed ratios can be adjusted as reaction is brought up so as to be on-specification at full production rate. Alternately, the catalyst feed ratio can be set at the necessary value for operation at full production           rate once the second catalyst feed is initiated.<br>
Method 2.<br>
	The second start-up method applicable to solution catalyst is for both catalysts<br>
     (and cocatalyst(s)) to be started at the same time. This can be done if the correct reactor     conditions for the desired product are known or if small variations in the reactor<br>
conditions are not important in order to make the desired product. As in method 1, if the kinetic parameters of the catalysts are known, the catalysts feed ratios can be adjusted as reaction is brought up so as to be on-specification while the reactor is being brought to its full production rate. Alternately, the catalyst feed ratio can be set at the necessary value          for operation at full production rate.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, start the reactor on LMW component to avoid gels. The LMW component is then analyzed and conditions are adjusted to get the desired product, Then the HMW component feed is started.   In general, with the LMW component, a lot of fines are produced due to nature of the product. We can analyze fines           to get more rapid feed back on the product we are making.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, one or more of the following methods may be used to alter the conditions to obtain the desired polymer properties for the methods described herein:<br>
1)        changing the amount of the first catalyst in the polymerization system, and/or :   2)        changing the amount of the second catalyst in the polymerization system, and/or<br><br>
3)	adding hydrogen to the polymerization process and/or altering the concentration of hydrogen in the system; and/or<br>
4)	changing the amount of liquid and/or gas that is withdrawn and/or purged from the process; and/or<br>
5)	changing the amount and/or composition of a recovered liquid and/or recovered gas returned to the polymerization process, said recovered liquid or recovered gas being recovered from polymer discharged from the polymerization process; and/or<br>
6)	using a hydrogenation catalyst in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
7)	changing the polymerization temperature; and/or<br>
        8)        changing the ethylene partial pressure in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
9)	changing the ethylene to comonomer ratio in the polymerization process; and/or<br>
10)	changing the activator to transition metal ratio in the activation sequence; an/or<br>
11)	changing the comonomer type; and/or<br>
12)	changing activation time.<br><br>
Once this desired polymer property for one catalyst is obtained during start-up, the feed of the additional catalyst(s) and optional activator(s) may proceed.<br>
The methods of this invention can be used with any olefin polymerization catalyst or catalyst system.<br><br>

When two different catalysts are used, the first and second catalyst compounds may be combined at molar ratios of 1:1000 to 1000:1, preferably 1:99 to 99:1, preferably 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably 20:80 to 80:20, more preferably 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably 40:60 to 60:40. The particular ratio chosen will depend on the end product desired and/or the method of activation. One practical method to determine which ratio is best to obtain the desired polymer is to start with a 1:1 ratio, measure the desired property in the product produced and adjust the ratio accordingly.<br>
In one particular embodiment, when using Compound I and indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate where both are activated with the same activator, the preferred weight percents, based upon the weight of the two catalysts, but not the activator or any support, are 10 to 95 weight % Compound I and 5 to 90 weight % indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate, preferably 50 to 90 weight % Compound I and 10 to 50 weight % indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate, more preferably 60-80 weight % Compound I to 40 to 20 weight % indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate. In a particularly preferred embodiment the indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate is activated with methylalumoxane, then combined with Compound I, then injected in the reactor.<br>
 Multi-component .catalyst systems with similar activity and/or decay rates provide a route for olefin polymerization in which the effects of catalyst residence time in the reactor can be mitigated. The catalysts preferably have a decay rate that is similar as measured by a decay model, be it first or higher order. The decay rates or alternatively, the catalyst half lives, are preferably within about 40% of each other, more preferably about 20% of each other, and most preferably about 10 to 0% of each other. 0% would<br><br>
1999U036<br>
mean essentially the same. The decay constant (Kd) is measured by running a rector at set conditions, shutting off the catalyst feed, but keeping all the other feeds on. Then allowing the reactor to come to equilibrium. During this time the bed builds up and you get plot of bed weight versus time. Assume first order decay behavior and then calculate the decay constant. If one wishes to compare two or more catalysts, repeat the above procedure using exactly the same reactor conditions.<br>
It is recognized that the decay characteristics can be affected by temperature, monomer pressure, comonomer type and concentration, hydrogen, additives/modifiers/other catalysts, catalyst poisons or impurities in the gas stream, presence of condensing agents or operation in condensing-mode.<br>
A corollary to this is that one or both of the catalysts can have a fast decay such that they are relatively insensitive to residence time effects in the normal range of reactor operation. One can calculate how much the decay rates can differ between catalysts based upon their respective decay rates, in order that the variation of polymer properties in the reactor is relatively small when there are changes in residence time.<br>
In another embodiment the first catalyst is selected because when used alone it produces a high weight average molecular weight polymer (such as for example above 100, 000, preferably above 150, 000, preferably above 200,000, preferably above 250,000, more preferably above 300,000) and the second catalyst is selected because when used alone it produces a low molecular weight polymer (such as for example below 80,000, preferably below 70,000, preferably below 60,000, more preferably below 50,000, more preferably below 40,000, more preferably below 30,000, more preferably below 20,000 and above 5,000, more preferably below 20,000 and above 10,000).<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a second catalyst produces a polyolefin having a lower<br>
molecular weight than the first catalyst when both are polymerized independently in<br>
identical.systems.  .,..„.	,	,,,<br>
When three or more catalysts are used, multi component catalyst polymerization split can be estimated and controlled by perturbing the feed rate of one or both of the catalyst feed rates to the polymerization reactor and measuring the change in polymer production rate. The invention is especially useful when the catalysts are indistinguishable elementally but can be used with other systems. It is especially<br><br><br>
1999U036<br>
applicable in systems where the relative amounts of each catalyst can be easily varied such as for solution feed or hybrid solution feed.<br>
The change in catalyst feed is less than 40%, preferably less than 15% and most preferably about 5 to 10%. There are accompanying changes in the polymer split composition, however, these are relatively small and may be inconsequential as the time¬frame for observing changes in production rate may be short relative to residence time in the reactor. The change in polymer composition is diluted.<br>
The production rate need not line out, but can be estimated mathematically when it is about 30 to 80% of its final value based upon theoretical response of CSTR      (continuous stirred tank reactor) to a step change.<br>
The simplest case is for a catalyst with very fast decay so residence time effects<br>
are inconsequential (although decay can easily be dealt with using a simple formula). As<br>
an example, let catalyst A and B be fed at a 50:50 rate, producing 10,000 pph of resin.<br>
Increase catalyst A by 10% and hold B constant so the feed split is now 55:50. The<br>
production rate increases from 10,000 to 10,500 pph. The difference of 5000 pph is<br>
attributable to the 10% increase of catalyst A, so the initial amount of resin produce by A<br>
was 5000 pph and its new value is 5500 pph. The initial polymer split was 50:50 and the<br>
new split is 55:50. (In this example, the catalysts were taken to be equally active, but the<br>
equation work for other sytems.<br>
	The catalyst feed rate or one or both catalysts can be constantly perturbed by small<br>
amounts continuously around the aim split (back and forth) so that the net resin<br>
composition is always aim. A step change is made and the response measured. The<br>
system performance can include an update term based on measured split to account for<br>
variations in catalyst productivity and decay.<br>
	Catalyst productivity models including the effects of temperature, residence time,<br>
monomer partial pressure, cornonomer type and concentration, hydrogen concentration,	<br>
impurities, inerts such as isopentane, and/or operation in or close to condensing mode can be used for each component of a separate addition, multi-component polymerization system for polymerization fraction split control. In response to changes in variables, the     feed rates of component catalysts can be adjusted. For example, a change in residence time can be compensated for by forward control that automatically adjusts the catalysts<br><br>
1999U036<br><br>
feed rates to a new aim value. Effects of temperature, partial pressure and other variables can also be compensated in a feed forward fashion.<br>
The models can also be used for process control based upon measured polymer split fractions. Ethylene partial pressure, for example could be adjusted by the models based upon the measured split. The concentration of an inert that affects the productivity of one catalyst more than the other could also be adjusted (like isopentane due presumably to its tempered cooling effect).<br>
Most commonly, the catalyst feed rates would be adjusted to move the measured polymer split back to aim. The effects of catalyst decay and residence time are part of the model, so the even the use of catalysts with significant or different decay rates can be controlled.<br>
The instant invention is applicable to gas phase polymerization with solution or liquid feed.<br>
In general the combined catalysts and the activator are combined in ratios of about 1000:1 to about 0.5:1.

The particular ratio chosen will depend on the end product desired and/or the method of activation. One practical method to determine which ratio is best to obtain the desired polymer is to start with a 1:1 ratio, measure the desired property in the product produced and adjust the ratio accordingly.              In one particular embodiment, when using, Compound I and indenyl zircomum tris-pivalate where both are activated with the same activator, the preferred weight percents, based upon the weight of the two catalysts, but not the activator or any support, are 10 to 95 weight % Compound I and 5 to 90 weight % indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate, preferably 50 to 90 weight % Compound I and 10 to 50 weight % indenyl zirconium tris-pivalate, more preferably 60-80 weight % Compound I to 40 to 20 weight % indenyl<br><br>

Polymerization Process:<br>
The catalysts and catalyst systems described above are suitable for use in any polymerization process, including solution, gas or slurry processes or a combination thereof, most preferably a gas or slurry phase process.<br>
In one embodiment, this invention is directed toward the polymerization or copolymerization reactions involving the polymerization of one or more monomers<br>
    having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2-12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms.

Preferably a copolymer of ethylene is produced, where the comonomer is at least one alpha-olefm having from 3 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably from 4 to 12 carbon atoms, more preferably from 4 to 8 carbon atoms and most preferably from 4 to 7 carbon atoms. In an alternate embodiment, the geminally disubstituted olefins disclosed in WO 98/37109 may be polymerized or copolymerized using the invention herein described.<br>
In another embodiment ethylene or propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers to form a terpolymer.

Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fiuidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fiuidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fiuidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, 5,453,471, 5,462,999, 5,616,661 and 5,668,228 all of which are fully incorporated herein by reference.)<br>
The reactor pressure in a gas phase process may vary from about 10 psig (69 kPa) to about 500 psig (3448 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 100 psig (690 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), preferably in the range of from about 200 psig (1379 kPa) to about 400 psig (2759 kPa), more preferably in the range of from about 250 psig (1724 kPa) to about 350 psig (2414 kPa).<br>
The reactor temperature in the gas phase process may vary from about 30°C to about 120°C, preferably from about 60°C to about 115°C, more preferably in the range of from about 75°C to 110°C, and most preferably in the range of from about 85°C to about 110°C. Altering the polymerization temperature can also be used as a tool to alter the final polymer product properties.<br>
The productivity of the catalyst or catalyst system is influenced by the main monomer partial pressure. The preferred mole percent of the main monomer, ethylene or prdpylene,pfefe'rably ethylene, is from about 25 'to 90 rriole percent and the monomer partial pressure is in the range of from about 75 psia (517 kPa) to about 300 psia (2069 kPa), which are typical conditions in a gas phase polymerization process. In one embodiment the ethylene partial pressure is about 220 to 240 psi (1517-1653 kPa). In another embodiment the molar ratio of hexene to ethylene in the reactor is 0.03:1 to 0.08:1.<br><br>
1999U036<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the reactor utilized in the present invention and the process of the invention produce greater than 500 lbs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hr) to about 200,000 lbs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr) or higher of polymer, preferably greater than 1000 lbs/hr (455 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr), even more preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr), still more preferably greater than 35,000 lbs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr), still even more preferably greater than 50,000 lbs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) and most preferably greater than 65,000 lbs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to greater than 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
Other gas phase processes contemplated by the process of the invention include those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,627,242, 5,665,818 and 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200, EP-A- 0 802 202 and EP-B- 634 421 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor.<br>
    The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
	In one embodiment, a preferred polymerization technique of the invention is<br>
referred-to as a particle'fo'rm'polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Such technique is well known in the art, and described in for instance U.S. Patent No. 3,248,179 which is fully incorporated herein by reference. The preferred temperature in the particle form<br>
3(1     process is within the range of about 185°F (85°C) to about 230°F (110°C). Two preferred polymerization methods for the slurry process are those employing a loop reactor and<br><br>
1999U036<br>
those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,613,484, which is herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
In another embodiment, the slurry process is carried out continuously in a loop reactor. The catalyst as a solution, as a suspension, as an emulsion, as a slurry in isobutane or as a dry free flowing powder is injected regularly to the reactor loop, which is itself filled with circulating slurry of growing polymer particles in a diluent of isobutane containing monomer and comonomer. Hydrogen, optionally, may be added as a molecular weight control. The reactor is maintained at pressure of about 525 psig to 625 psig (3620 kPa to 4309 kPa) and at a temperature in the range of about 140 °F to about 220 °F (about 60 °C to about 104 °C) depending on the desired polymer density. Reaction heat is removed through the loop wall since much of the reactor is in the form of a double-jacketed pipe. The slurry is allowed to exit the reactor at regular intervals or continuously to a heated low pressure flash vessel, rotary dryer and a nitrogen purge column in sequence for removal of the isobutane diluent and all unreacted monomer and comonomers. The resulting hydrocarbon free powder is then compounded for use in various applications.<br>
In an embodiment the reactor used in the slurry process of the invention is capable of and the process of the invention is producing greater than 2000 lbs of polymer per hour (907 Kg/hr), more preferably greater than 5000 lbs/hr (2268 Kg/hr), and most preferably greater than 10,000 lbs/hr (4540 Kg/hr). In another embodiment the slurry reactor used in the process of the invention is producing greater than 15,000 lbs of polymer per hour (6804 Kg/hr), preferably greater than 25,000 lbs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to about 100,000 lbs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr).<br>
  In another erhbMiment in the "Slurry process of the invention-the total reactor pressure is in the range of from 400 psig (2758 kPa) to 800 psig (5516 kPa), preferably 450 psig (3103 kPa) to about 700 psig (4827 kPa), more preferably 500 psig (3448 kPa) to about 650 psig (4482 kPa), most preferably from about 525 psig (3620 kPa) to 625 psig (4309 kPa).<br><br>
1999U036<br>
In yet another embodiment in the slurry process of the invention the concentration of ethylene in the reactor liquid medium is in the range of from about 1 to 10 weight percent, preferably from about 2 to about 7 weight percent, more preferably from about 2.5 to about 6 weight percent, most preferably from about 3 to about 6 weight percent.

Example 1 - Start-up on both catalysts at the same time.<br>
An ethylene hexene copolymer was produced in a 14-inch (35.6 cm) pilot plant scale gas phase reactor operating at 85° C and 350 psig (2.4 MPa) total reactor pressure having a water cooled heat exchanger. The reactor was equipped with a plenum having about 1,600 PPH of recycle gas flow. (The plenum is a device used to create a particle lean zone in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor. See US Patent 5,693,727.) A tapered catalyst injection nozzle having a 0.041 inch (0.1 cm) hole size was position in the plenum gas flow. Prior to starting the catalyst feed, ethylene pressure was about 220 psia (1.5 MPa), 1-hexene concentration was about 0.6 mol % and hydrogen concentration was<br>
1(|     about 0.25 mol %. Nitrogen was fed to the reactor as a make-up gas at about 5-8 PPH. The catalyst solution was a 1:1 molar ratio of Catalyst A to Catalyst B in a toluene solution. Catalyst feed was started at 13 cc's per hour, which was sufficient to give the desired production rate of 17 lbs/hr. The catalyst and activator (modified methylalumoxane, MMAO-3A, 1 wt % Aluminum, commercially available from Akzo<br>
\\     Chemicals, Inc. under the trade name Modified Methylalumoxane type 3A, covered under patent number US 5,041,584) were mixed in line prior to passing through the injection nozzle into the fluidized bed. MMAO to catalyst was controlled so that the Al:Zr molar ratio was 300:1. 5.0 lbs/hr (2.3 kg/hr) Nitrogen and 0.20 lbs/hr (0.1 kg/hr) 1-hexene were also fed to the injection nozzle. A bimodal polymer having nominal 0.43 dg/min (I21) and<br>
     0.942 g/cc density properties was obtained. The resin average particle size was 0.023<br>
inches (0.06 cm). A residual zirconium of 2.2 ppmw was measured by x-ray fluorescence.<br>
Example 2 - Start-up on high molecular weight catalyst first.<br>
An ethylene hexene copolymer was produced in a 14-inch (35.6 cm) pilot plant    scale gas phase reactor operating at 85° C and 350 psig (2.4 MPa) total reactor pressure having a water cooled heat exchanger. The reactor was equipped with a plenum having about 1,600 PPH of recycle gas flow. (The plenum is a device used to create a particle lean zone in a fluidized bed gas-phase reactor. See US Patent 5,693,727.) A tapered catalyst injection nozzle having a 0.055 inch (0.14 cm) hole size was position in the plenum gas flow. Prior to starting the catalyst feed, ethylene pressure was about 220<br><br>

■PC<br>
psia(1.5 MPa), 1-hexene concentration was about 0.3 mol % and hydrogen concentration was about 0.12 mol %.<br>
Catalyst C was dissolved in a 0.5 wt% solution in toluene and was fed to reactor at 12 cc/hr. MMAO-3A, (1 wt % Aluminum) cocatalyst was mixed with the Catalyst C in the feed line prior to the reactor at a molar ratio of 400:1 Al/Zr. The production rate was about 24 lb/hr (10.9kg/hr). In addition, 5.0 lbs/hr (2.3 kg/hr) Nitrogen and 0.1 lbs/hr (0.05 kg/hr) 1-hexene and 0.2 lb/hr (0.09 kg/hr) isopentane were also fed to the injection nozzle. The polymer had a flow index of 0,31 dg/min and a density of 0.935 g/cc. After this was established, the catalyst feed rate was reduced to 6 cc/hr Catalyst C and a 0.125 wt% indenyl zirconium tris pivalate (Catalyst D) in hexane solution feed was added to the injection line at 13 cc/hr. The entire order of addition was the hexene and the MMAO mixed with the Catalyst D/Catalyst C solution was added, then isopentane and nitrogen. The Al/Zr for the entire system was about 500. Within 6 hours of the addition of the Catalyst D, the bimodal polymer had a nominal 12.9 dg/min (I2i), a 130 MFR and 0.953 g/cc density. The resin average particle size was 0.0479 inches (0.12cm). A residual zirconium of 0.7 ppmw was measured by x-ray fluorescence.<br>
Example 3 - Start-up on low molecular weight catalyst first.<br>
A high molecular weight high density (HMWHD) film product was produced from a bimodal catalyst system. Catalyst D produces the low molecular weight component (LMWC), and Catalyst C produces the high molecular weight component (HMWC).<br>
Before the catalyst flows were started, the reactor was brought up to the following conditions. 85°C bed temperature, 350 psig (2.4 MPa) total pressure, 220 psig (15.2MPa) C2 partial pressure, 0.005 C6/C2 ratio, and 1200 ppm H2. N2 carrier flow, which ties into the catalyst feed line approximately 5 ft (l:52.m) from the injection port,, was started at •„, 2.0 lb/hr (0.91 kg/hr). Shroud nitrogen, which helps create a particle free zone at the catalyst injection point of the reactor, was started at 2.5 lb/hr (1.13 kg/hr).<br>
0.125 wt% Catalyst D in a hexane solvent, was started to the reactor first with a flowrate of 20 cc/hr. Hexene kiss (which is a small amount of Hexene added to the system) contacted Catalyst D immediately downstream of the syringe pump, and helped<br><br>
1999U036<br>
carry the catalyst downstream. The volumetric ratio of hexene kiss to Catalyst D was set at 2.70. MMAO (3.55 wt% Al in hexane) contacted the Catalyst D/hexene kiss stream through a 100 cc coil. The MMAO flow was controlled such that the Al:Zr molar ratio was 700.<br>
Before the HMWC catalyst was brought on, the correct product of the LMWC was made. The target melt index was 550 dg/min, and this was obtained by adjusting the hydrogen concentration. The startup hydrogen concentration was 1200 ppm, which produced a melt index of approximately 350 dg/min. Therefore the hydrogen was adjusted to 1350 ppm to achieve the 550 dg/min product.<br>
	Once the desired LMWC product was established Catalyst C was started at 6.8<br>
cc/hr. This gave a 1.5 molar ratio of Catalyst C: Catalyst D. The Catalyst C stream mixed with the Catalyst D stream downstream of the Catalyst D and MMAO contact coil. This stream was fed to the reactor through a 0.055 inch (0.14 cm) diameter injection nozzle. The product obtained was 8.24 dg/min (I2i), 0.950 g/cc density, 0.0224 in APS.<br>
     The residual zirconium was measured to be 0.80 ppmw by x-ray flourescence.<br>
