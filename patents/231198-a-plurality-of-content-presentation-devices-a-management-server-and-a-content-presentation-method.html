[Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention]<br>
In what follows, an embodiment of the content presentation system in accordance with the present invention will be explained in detail. Fig. 1 is a schematic representation of the entire configuration of the content presentation system in accordance with the present invention.<br>
As shown in the figure, the content presentation system in accordance with the present invention includes a management server 1 for outputting instructions to deliver and replace content, a database 2 for accumulating a variety of data items 21 to 23, content presentation devices 41 to 4 3 which perform the presentation of content and the replacement of the content, the Internet 3 to which the respective devices are connected, a broadband line 5 connected to the Internet 3, wireless base stations 61 to 63 which are connected to the management server 1 through the broadband line 5 and serve to relay data to the content presentation devices 41 to 43 and communication terminals 10 (cellular phones, PHSs, mobile terminals) , and a personal computer 9 connectable to the Internet 3.<br>
The content presentation devices 41 to 43 are devices in the form of signboards which are installed on a building 83 alongside a load 81, in locations close to a railroad 84, on a platform 86 in a station yard, in a location of an urban area 87, in a train 85, on the exterior surfaces of vehicles 82 and so forth. More specifically speaking, as shown in Fig. 2, each of these content presentation devices 41 to 43 comprises a memory 4d for storing content data and the IP of the content<br><br>
presentation device, a communication interface 4c for performing transmission and reception of data with the management server 1 through a communication line such as a wireless LAN or a broadband line, a display 4a for displaying content, and a CPU 4b for controlling the output operation and switching operation of the content.<br>
The communication interface 4c is provided with the capability of receiving content data and a switching control signal delivered from the management server 1 through a wireless LAN, a wired LAN, the broadband line 5, a wireless communication line via the wireless base stations 61 to 63 and so forth, the capability of notifying the content presentation device IP to the other communication terminal apparatuses 10, and the network formation capability of forming a local communication network (wireless LAN) with the wireless base station 63 or the other content presentation devices located in a predetermined area.<br>
In addition, the communication interface 4c is provided with the capability of detecting the other communication terminal apparatuses 10 located in the wireless LAN, and notifying the content presentation device IP of its own device to the other communication terminal apparatuses. By this configuration, the communication terminal apparatus 10 can obtain the content presentation device IPs of the nearby content presentation devices, and start communication with the content presentation devices by the use of this content presentation device IP. As a result, it is possible to perform operations linked to the information presented by the content presentation devices, for example, a request for more detailed data, a reservation of a shop or service, purchase of a commodity, and so forth.<br>
When the switching control signal is received from the management server 1 through the wireless base stations 61 to 63, the CPU 4b analyzes the switching control signal, determines whether the presented data is switched to the content data which is accumulated in the memory 4d in advance or the content data which is streaming delivered from the management server 1. In the case where the presented data is switched to the content data which is accumulated in the<br><br>
memory 4d, the content IDs (index data: "0001" ~ "0003" in the figure) are extracted from the switching control signal, and the data is switched to the corresponding content data, and output.<br>
The management server 1 is a server unit serving to manage the content presentation devices 41 to 43 and, as illustrated in Fig. 3, provided with a database management unit 13 for managing the database 2 in which various types of data are accumulated, a timer unit 12 for periodically measuring the elapsed time, a data generation unit 16 for generating data to be transmitted to the content presentation devices, a data transmitter receiver unit 17 for data transmission and reception with the content presentation devices 41 to 43, a content updating management unit 15 for managing the updating and switching of content, an external information acquisition unit 14 for acquiring live traffic conditions, weather information and so forth from external information services 7, and a control unit 11 for controlling the operations of the respective units 12 to 17.<br>
The database 2 accumulates data in a local information database 21, a content management database 22 and a content data base 23. The local information database 21 is a database in which are accumulated, for example, the time tables of transportation facilities such as railway and bus services, the statistical data showing the change in population distribution, the statistical data showing traffic congestion, or other data showing the change in population distribution pertinent to the respective areas.<br>
The content management database 22 contains a content switching table as shown in a table 1, and a content updating table as shown in a table 2. As shown in the table 1, a group ID for managing a plurality of content presentation devices as a group, the IP addresses of the respective content presentation devices, content IDs for identifying the content to be presented by the respective content presentation devices, presentation times (times of day) of the respective content IDs, the way of switching content data, associated local information, associated external information, the conditions under which data is switched are written in the content<br><br><br>
The operation of the content presentation system in accordance with the present embodiment having the structure as described above is as follows. Fig. 4 is a flow chart which shows the operation of the content presentation system. In this case, it is assumed that the measurement in a predetermined cycle is started by the timer unit 12.<br>
As shown in the same figure, at first, the database 2 is searched, and external information is acquired from the external information services 7 in step S101. Specifically, the database management unit 13 searches the content management database in the database 2, reads the content switching table, and also reads the time tables, the statistical data of population distribution and the like which are local information.<br>
Next, content updating management information is generated on the basis of the content switching table in step S102. This content updating management information comprises a content updating schedule provided for each of the content presentation devices, and more specifically speaking it is generated by the procedure as shown in Fig. 5. The generation of this content updating management  information will be<br><br>
described later.<br>
Next, the time of the timer is acquired in step S103 to compare the content updating management information with the management time measured by the timer in step SI 04 and determine whether or not there is content to be replaced at the present time in step S105. Specifically, the presentation times of the content switching table are read and compared with the timer management time in order to determine whether or not there is content whose presentation time is expired. In step S105, if there is no content to be replaced ("N" in step S105), the process in the above steps S103 to S105 is repeated.<br>
On the other hand, in step S105, if there is content to be replaced ("Y" in step S105), then the way of switching content data is read, and it is determined whether or not there is content to be delivered (updated) in step S106. Namely, it is determined whether content is to be delivered anew from the content data base 23 or the current content is to be simply replaced by content already stored in the content presentation device. In the case where the current content is replaced by content already stored in the content presentation device ("N" in step S106) , the content ID for specifying the content for replacement is generated as index information in step S109. On the other hand, in step S106, if content is to be delivered anew ("Y" in step S106), the corresponding content is acquired from the content data base 23 in step S107.<br>
Then, transmission data (the switching control signal) is generated in step S108 by the data generation unit 16 on the basis of the index information as generated in step S109 or the content data as acquired in step S107, and transmitted to the respective content presentation devices 41 to 43 through the data transmitter receiver unit 17 in step S110. When receiving the switching control signal, the respective content presentation devices 41 to 43 switch the content presented on the displays 4a on the basis of the switching control signal.<br>
Then, the process of generating the content updating management information in step S102 as described above will be described in detail. Fig. 5 is a flow chart which shows the sub-routine of step S102.<br><br>
First, when the process of generating the content updating management information is started, the content switching table is read in order to extract records left unprocessed in step S201, and repeat processing of the records as extracted by the loop process in steps S202 to S208 as described in the following description.<br>
More specifically speaking, in step S202, it is determined whether or not a switching operation in accordance with time is to be performed on the basis of the presentation times of the record as read. For example, in the case where "all" is indicated as shown in the table 1, there is no switching operation in accordance with time and thereby the updating management is not necessary* Accordingly, in this case, the record is discarded in step S203, and the process proceeds to the process of the next record.<br>
On the other hand, in step S202, if it is determined that there is a switching operation in accordance with time ("Y" in step S202), then it is determined whether or not there is a switching operation in accordance with local information in step S204. In other words, in the case where the associated local information of the content switching table is referred to and it is determined that an association with local information is written in the associated local information, the local information database 21 is searched to acquire the local information in step S205. For example, in the case where "railroad time table" is written in the associated local information, the time table is read from the local information database 21.<br>
Next, it is determined whether or not there is a switching operation in accordance with external information in step S206. In other words, in the case where the associated external information of the content switching table is referred to and it is determined that an association with external information is written in the associated external information, the external information is acquired from the external information services 7 through the external information acquisition unit 14 in step S207. For example, in the case where "live traffic conditions", "weather forecast"<br><br>
or the like are written in the associated external information of the content switching table, the live traffic conditions, the weather forecast or the like are acquired from the external information services 7.<br>
Then, the switching conditions are referred to on the basis of the local information and the external information, and the switching time is determined in accordance with the record as matched with the switching conditions in step S208. For example, in the case where the switching condition is "three minutes before arrival", the switching time is set to be the arrival time of a train minus three minutes. Also, in the case where the switching condition is "in the rain" and the weather forecast acquired in step S207 is rain, there is a match with the switching condition so that the switching time is determined on the basis of the presentation time in the content switching table.<br>
Then, the process in the above steps S202 to S208 is performed with all the records, and after determining the switching times of the respective items of content the records are sorted in the switching order on the basis of the switching times in step S209.The collection of records as sorted are stored in the content updating management unit 15 as the content updating management information.<br>
In accordance with the content presentation system of the present embodiment as described above, the content data to be presented by the content presentation devices 41 to 43 installed in a train, a station yard, roadside locations and so forth can be centrally managed by the management server 1 in accordance with the management information. In addition, the respective content presentation devices 41 to 43 are given unique content presentation device IPs, and the content data can be controlled for the respective content presentation devices with reference to the content presentation device IPs in order to present content in accordance with the respective areas and hours.<br>
[Industrial Applicability]<br>
