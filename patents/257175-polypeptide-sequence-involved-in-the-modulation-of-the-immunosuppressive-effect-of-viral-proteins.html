				<td>POLYPEPTIDE SEQUENCE INVOLVED IN THE MODULATION OF THE IMMUNOSUPPRESIVE EFFECT OF VIRAL PROTEINS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
	The present invention relates to an amino acid sequence<br>
capable of modulating the immunosuppressive properties of a protein, especially from antigenic proteins. The invention also provides polypeptides, derived from an antigenic and immunosuppressive protein, having acquired modulated immunosuppressive properties with respect to<br>
        the protein from which it is derived, while substantially retaining its antigenic properties.<br>
The invention especially concerns the field of viral or retroviral infections, including the field of endogenous retroviruses, and provides means for the design of agents for the prophylaxis and/or treatment of<br>
	hosts susceptible to such viruses or retroviruses, including animal or human<br>
hosts.<br>
Polypeptides of the invention can especially be used in the generation of immunogenic compositions and in the production of attenuated viruses, for use in methods for prophylaxis and/or treatment of<br>
	viral infections or their detrimental consequences or for prophylaxis and/or<br>
treatment of the detrimental consequences of the induction of expression of endogenous retroviruses (ERV).<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 25<br>
Infectious agents, such as viruses, have evolved mechanisms<br>
and strategies to invade their hosts and to escape their immune response.<br>
Various publications have demonstrated the immunosuppressive properties<br>
of proteins encoded by viruses: the Epstein Barr human herpes virus 4<br>
30	(Suzuki et al. 1995. J. Exp. Med.182, 477-486; Qin et al. 1996 J. Immunol.<br>
156, 2316-2323), the Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (Blaise et al. 2001 J. Gen.<br>

Virol. 82, 1597-1600), the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Mangeney and<br>
Heidmann. 1998. Proc. Natl. Sci. USA. 95, 14920-14925) and others (see<br>
review Alcami et al. 2002 EMBO reports. 3(10), 927-932). This may be<br>
confirmed by the fact that infection by retroviruses is frequently associated<br>
5	with dysfunctions of the immune system of the host.<br>
These immunosuppressive effects include the inhibition of interleukin-2-dependent lymphocyte proliferation, of the cytolytic activity of human natural killer cells, and of monocyte-medicated tumor cell killing as well as modulation of cytokine synthesis.<br>
10	In vivo tests demonstrated that inactivated viruses, as well as<br>
synthetic peptides similar to retrovirus envelope proteins have immunosuppressive properties (Oostendorp et al. 1993 Grit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 14, 189-206; Haraguchi et al. 1997 J. Leukocyte Biol. 61, 654-666). More recently, Mangeney et al. (1998. Proc. Natl. Sci. USA. 95,<br>
15	14920-14925) showed that murine tumoral cells from C57BL/6 strain,<br>
expressing a retroviral envelope protein, form tumours when injected in Balb/c mice (allograft), whereas the same cells, which do not express the retroviral envelope protein, are rejected. By carrying out different deletions in the envelope protein, a domain responsible for the immunosuppressive<br>
20	function that was called  ISU (for "immunosuppressive") domain, was<br>
identified.<br>
The ISU domain was first identified in the transmembrane moiety of the envelope glycoprotein. The env (envelope) gene of retroviruses encodes a precursor polypeptide which is then cleaved into two<br>
25	proteins: the surface glycoprotein (SU) and the transmembrane subunit<br>
(TM). The SU protein is responsible for the recognition and the binding to the cellular receptor for the virus. The TM moiety is involved in anchoring the envelope complex (SU and TM) to the target cell membrane, and is directly responsible for cell membrane fusion and virus entry.<br>
30	The structure of the TM subunit has been elucidated for many<br>
viruses, especially for the Moloney murine leukaemia virus (Mo-MuLV), the<br>

human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and the human T-cell leukaemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). A highly conserved organization in the envelope proteins has also been found in non-retroviral proteins, such as those of influenza virus and Ebola virus.<br>
5	Immunosuppressive effects have also been discovered in<br>
another class of proteins, characterized in the ERVs, especially HERVs (Human Endogenous Retroviruses). HERVs comprise elements which are sequences of retroviral origin that have spread into the human genome, and represent proviral remnants of ancestral infections. Therefore, strong<br>
10	similarities can be inferred between HERVs and retroviruses. Some of<br>
these HERV elements are still functional and can encode active proteins, i.e., viral-like proteins although most of them have accumulated mutations, deletions and/or truncations.<br>
A role for these functional  HERVs has been proposed,<br>
15	including a protection against retrovirus infection (Best et al. 1997 Trends<br>
Microbiol. 5, 313-318) or a protection of the foetus against the maternal immune system via immunosuppressive effects (Cianciolo et al. 1985 Science 230, 453-455; Mangeney and Heidmann 1998 Proc. Natl. Sci. USA. 95, 14920-14925). An HERV encoding an envelope protein having<br>
20	immunosuppressive properties was identified by Mangeney et al. (2001 J.<br>
Gen. Virology 82, 2515-2518). This publication reports that the protein encoded by HERV-H allows the envelope-expressing cells to escape immune response and to proliferate, whereas the same cells transfected with empty vectors are normally rejected by engrafted mice.<br>
25	Other ERVs, especially HERVs, encoding functional envelope<br>
proteins were identified, which have fusogenic properties, i.e. are able to form syncytia in vitro (multi-nucleate cells): they include HERV-FRD and HERV-W (Blond et al. 2000 J. Virol. 74, 3321-3329; Blaise et al. 2003 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 22, 13013-13018). Moreover, in vivo experiments<br>
30	have shown that when co-expressed with MoMLV viral particles deficient<br>
for the production of their own envelope protein, the HERV-W envelope<br>
Demande Internationale n° PCT/EP2005/003339 deposee le 30 mars 2005 PriorM: Demande de brevet europeen n° 04 290 838.4 deposee le 30 mars 2004<br><br>

protein can form functional viral particles, capable of infecting human cells (Patience et al. 1998 J. Virol. 72, 2671-2676). In conclusion, HERV-W has conserved its fusogenic and infectiosity properties. Analog fusogenic and infectious properties have been observed for HERV-FRD.<br>
5	The observed immunosuppressive effects may be related,<br>
depending on the context, on the one hand to a virulent viral infection and on the other hand to an active proliferation of tumour cells, in mammals and particularly in human. Active proliferation of tumour cells is especially a consequence of expression of ERV viral-like proteins. However, whereas<br>
10	more insights are needed to completely understand the mechanisms of<br>
immunosuppression, the identification of these immunosuppressive proteins opens new perspectives for therapeutic, including vaccinal, strategies against viral infections, against induction of expression of endogenous retroviruses, or against their detrimental consequences in a<br>
15	host.<br>
Vaccines  currently used  can  especially be classified  as follows:<br>
-	live   attenuated   vaccines   (bacteria   or   virus   vaccine)<br>
consisting   in   an  attenuated  or  weakened,   modified   pathogen.  After<br>
20	administration to the host, the modified pathogenic organism replicates in<br>
the host and stimulates an immune response. This type of vaccine generally produces a long-lasting immunity upon single dose administration, but may cause side effects, i.e. a mild case of the illness caused by said pathogen, and thus should not be given to people with a<br>
25	weakened immune system.<br>
-	inactivated   or  killed   vaccines,   consisting   in   killed   or<br>
inactivated pathogen, especially as a result of heat and/or chemical<br>
treatments (whole organism). Such treated pathogens cannot replicate,<br>
and cannot cause the disease they normally raise. Therefore, they are<br>
30	safe and can be administered even to hosts whose immune system is<br>

weakened. However, they are not usually as effective as live vaccines and therefore require multiple dose administration.<br>
- vaccines consisting in antigenic fractions of a pathogen<br>
organism,  including whole proteins or antigenic determinants thereof,<br>
5	especially obtained  by recombinant technologies,  as  a result of the<br>
expression of genes encoding the antigen. The expressed protein can be administered to a patient, or the gene encoding the protein can be inserted into an expression vector which is administered to the host. Such vaccines however are usually not as effective as live vaccines and therefore require<br>
10	multiple doses.<br>
Principles applied for the design of compounds suitable for vaccine preparations capable of eliciting an immune response in a host, in order to protect a host from infection due to pathogens, including viruses, bacteria or others, have been transposed to the design of compounds<br>
15	suitable   for  treatment  of   established   infections,   by   immunotherapy.<br>
Efficiency of such compounds has however not proved to be sufficient enough, especially in the field of anti-viral or anti-viral-like prophylaxis or immunotherapy. Moreover, the use of compounds still raises many issues regarding safety.<br>
20	One drawback observed  in  the  use of some retroviral<br>
envelope proteins for immunisation, either as vaccine principles or for immunotherapy, lies in their immunosuppressive properties which can prevent or affect the efficiency of the host's immune response. Consequently these proteins cannot be administered to a patient in their<br>
25	native form because of their potential inhibition of the immune response. A<br>
great challenge would hence be to suppress or modulate the immunosuppression properties of these proteins, without altering their antigenic properties and/or their properties related to host cell infection. However, attempts to mutate the envelope protein complex, have led to a<br>
30	strong alteration of its fusion and infection functions and therefore of their<br>
interest as active principle to raise an immune response (Delamarre et al.<br>

This  is  a  purpose  of the  present invention  to  identify<br>
determinants of the immunosuppressive properties of proteins, including to<br>
5	identify polypeptide sequences and amino acid residues involved in the<br>
modulation of the immunosuppressive properties of proteins, particularly viral or viral-like proteins, which substantially retain their antigenic properties of said immunosuppressive proteins.<br>
It  is  a further object of the invention,  to identify such<br>
10	determinants of the immunosuppressive properties of the protein, and to<br>
use the same for the design of polypeptides having modified, i.e., modulated immunosuppressive properties.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide such polypeptides, which are derived from an antigenic and immunosuppressive<br>
15	protein,     which     polypeptides     are     characterized     by     modulated<br>
immunosuppressive properties while retaining antigenic properties of the starting protein.<br>
This is also an object of the present invention, to provide means  to  promote  an   efficient  immune  response  against  pathogen<br>
20	organisms, especially against viruses, i.e., a cell-mediated and/or humoral<br>
immune response which would be protective against infection by such pathogen organisms, especially viruses, or protective against their detrimental effects in the host, or protective against the detrimental consequences of expression of endogenous retroviruses in a host, with<br>
25	reduced risks of immune system alteration. The invention also provides<br>
means suitable for treatment by immunotherapy, of patients infected with pathogen organisms including viruses, or for treatment of their detrimental effects, including malignant effects or for the treatment of patients suffering from pathologies associated with induction of the expression of<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one aspect, the invention provides a polypeptide which is<br>
capable of modulating the immunosuppressive properties of a viral protein<br>
or a fragment thereof against the host in which it is expressed when it<br>
5	substitutes the homologous sequence of said protein or fragment, said<br>
polypeptide having the minimum following consensus amino acid sequence:<br>
X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)i-X2<br>
10<br>
wherein, X1 and X2 are selected to impact on said immunosuppressive properties, Y represents variable amino acid residues, and 3 and 1 represent the number of variable amino acid residues respectively between X1 and C and between C and X2.<br>
15	Said    minimum    consensus    sequence    is    designated<br>
"immunosuppression-modulatory sequence".<br>
In an embodiment, peptides replying to the above definition, comprising an immunosuppression-modulatory sequence, are derived from a viral including from a viral-like protein, especially a retroviral protein, in<br>
20	particular, a viral or retroviral envelope protein or an envelope protein from<br>
an endogenous retrovirus, especially from a human endogenous retrovirus (HERV).<br>
The amino acid sequences of several envelope proteins of viruses (including ERV) have been disclosed in Figure 3 of Benit et al (J<br>
25	Virol. December 2001, p. 11707-11719).<br>
Particular pairs of amino acid residues impacting on the immunosuppressive properties in the context of a determined protein have been characterized, and accordingly sequences having the desired "immunosuppression-modulatory" properties have been identified and can<br>
30	be selected from the group consisting of:<br>

a) sequences involved in the occurrence of immunosuppressive properties of a protein in which they are present comprise:<br>

and b) sequences altering, e.g. decreasing or suppressing immunosuppressive properties of an immunosuppressive protein when they are present therein, comprise<br>
10	R-(Y)3-C-(Y)rF<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a polypeptide derived from a determined antigenic and immunosuppressive protein, said polypeptide comprising an amino acid sequence (so-called immunosuppression-modulatory sequence) represented by X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)r<br>
15	X2 wherein Jn said polypeptide Y represents variable amino acid residues,<br>
3 and 1 represent the number of variable amino acid residues Y respectively between X1 and C and between C and X2, and X1 and X2 are chosen to confer to said polypeptide altered immunosuppressive properties with respect to the immunosuppressive properties of said determined<br>
20	protein.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the protein having antigenic and immunosuppressive properties is encoded by a gene derived from a virus, and especially by an env gene from a retrovirus.<br>
Such protein comprises an immunosuppressive sequence<br>
25	determinant having the following consensus sequence: E/Q-G-G-L/T/I-C-<br>
A/K/L/M/V/I-A. The same protein wherein X1 (E/Q) and optionally X2 (A) residues are substituted can be devoid of immunosuppressive properties but retains its antigenic properties. An example of modified immunosuppression-modulatory sequence is R-G-G-L/T/I-C-A/K/L/M/V/I-F,<br>
30	which alters immunosuppressive properties and especially can give rise to<br>
a non-immunosuppressive polypeptide which contains said sequence. A<br>

and/or fusion properties. The modification of the immunosuppression-modulatory sequence, e.g. by substitution of X1 and optionally X2 amino acid residues can advantageously be carried out in a way that does not affect one of these or both supplementary properties.<br>
25	In another aspect,  the invention  relates to compositions<br>
comprising such polypeptides or recombinant viral particles expressing these polypeptides. Such compositions or particles can be used in the prevention or treatment of a viral infection including for the prevention or treatment of its detrimental effects, or for prevention or treatment or the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The  present  invention   provides  a   polypeptide  having  a<br>
25	sequence of 7 to 20 amino acid residues, which is capable of modulating<br>
the immunosuppressive properties of a viral protein or a fragment thereof against the host in which it is expressed when it substitutes the homologous sequence of said viral protein or fragment, said polypeptide comprising the minimum following consensus amino acid sequence:<br>
30	X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2<br>

wherein, X1 and X2 are selected to impact on said immunosuppressive properties, Y represents variable amino acid residues, and 3 and 1 represent the number of variable amino acid residues Y, respectively between X1 and C and between C and X2.<br>
5	In all the sequences of the present invention, the amino acid<br>
one-letter code is used. X and Y are used to designate variable amino acid residues, X being determined to influence the immunosuppressive properties of a determined protein.<br>
Y represents amino acid residues that can vary for different<br>
10	polypeptides and within one determined polypeptide. "(Y)3" indicates that 3<br>
amino acid residues are present between the X1 residues and the cysteine residue (C). The 3 amino acid residues can be different or identical and can be selected independently of each other. The indication of a particular amino acid residue in a sequence, like the cysteine in the sequence above,<br>
15	means that this amino acid residue is invariant, i.e. it has a constant<br>
position in said sequence.<br>
Optionally the consensus sequence can also be noted as follows:<br>
Xi YgYi oYi 1 CYi 2X2<br>
20	wherein Xi represents X1, X2 represents X2, and Y9 to Yi2 represent any<br>
amino acid. As intended herein amino acids Y9 to Yi2 are identical or different.<br>
In the present invention, the expressions "virus" or "viral" apply both exogenous or endogenous viruses or their compounds, unless<br>
25	otherwise stated. Therefore, "viral protein" encompasses "viral-like proteins"<br>
which may also be referred to when describing the expression products of endogenous viruses, especially ERV, in particular HERV.<br>
The above consensus sequence of the polypeptide according to  the   invention   is   called   "immunosuppression-modulatory  sequence"<br>
30	meaning that, when it is present in the polypeptide having 7 to 20 amino<br>
acid    residues,    the    polypeptides    can    be    used    to    modulate<br>

immunosuppressive properties of a protein which has been identified as harbouring such immunosuppressive properties or, as lacking such properties despite the fact that is comprises a peptidic motif having a sequence X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2.<br>
5	More especially, X represents both amino acid residues (X1<br>
and X2) directly involved, individually or together, in the modulation of the immunosuppressive properties of a protein comprising the above consensus sequence. They are respectively located at the N-terminal and C-terminal ends of the minimum polypeptide having 7 amino acid residues.<br>
10	A protein is said to have immunosuppressive properties, when<br>
this protein, expressed in tumour cells engrafted in a host which would normally be rejected by said host, to the contrary allows these tumour cells to proliferate and to escape immune rejection by the host.<br>
An in vivo procedure to assay the immunosuppressive activity<br>
15	of a protein is that used by Mangeney M. and Heidmann T., 1998 PNAS or<br>
by Blaise et al. 2001 represented in Figure 5. A wild-type or modified nucleic acid expressing the protein to be tested is transfected in tumour cell Jines such as MCA 205 or CI8.1 cell lines by known transfection methods. The tumour cells expressing the protein to be tested are then injected<br>
20	especially s.c. injection to a host, generally mice. Following said injection,<br>
the establishment of tumour or, to the contrary, its rejection, is determined and the tumour area is measured. In vitro assay could be carried out, using high doses of synthetic peptides but they are indirect and less convincing, since the expression "immunosuppressive" is relevant when applied to<br>
25	animals possessing a complete immune system and not to cell lines.<br>
The expression "modified nucleic acid" as used herein refers to any genetic alteration such as nucleotide substitution, deletion or insertion that change the amino acid composition of the encoded polypeptide or protein. Thus, an amino acid sequence can substitute, i.e.<br>
30	replace a homologous sequence present in the original protein.<br>

19	CONFIDENTJEL<br>
The terms "homologous sequence" in the protein which is<br>
tested for modulation of its immunosuppressive properties refer to a<br>
sequence having the same amino acid sequence as that replacing (i.e.<br>
substituting) it for the assay, i.e., X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2 except for the X1 and<br>
5	X2 residues; at least one of which and possibly both, are selected to be<br>
different from their corresponding amino acid residues in the original sequence. Thus, the Y amino acid residues are conserved between the homologous sequence of the protein to be modified and the sequence of the polypeptide having 7-20 amino acid residues as defined above.<br>
10	Such homologous sequences are disclosed in Figure 9 for<br>
various viruses and are illustrated in the context of the TM subunit of various envelopes for several viruses in Benit L. et al. (J. Virol. Vol. 75, No. 23, December 2001, p. 11709-11719) in Figure 3.<br>
The X1 and X2 amino acid residues are chosen to modulate<br>
15	the immunosuppressive properties of the original viral protein. The term<br>
"modulate" as used herein refers to an increase or decrease of the immunosuppressive activity of the modified protein with respect to the immunosuppressive activity of the original (i.e., non modified) protein, when tested in the same conditions.<br>
20	The invention especially relates to an "immunosuppression-<br>
modulatory sequence" which allows a decrease in the immunosuppressive properties of the modified protein with respect to the originally immunosuppressive protein. The modulation is preferably significant meaning that the immune response of the host becomes detectable, and<br>
25	advantageously becomes sufficient to eliminate the pathogen agent or<br>
becomes sufficient to stop, stabilize or reverse the detrimental consequences of infection by said pathogen in a host or of the expression of endogenous viruses, especially of normally silent ERV, especially HERV, in a host.<br>
30	In a particular embodiment, modulation results in decreasing<br>
the immunosuppressive properties of the original protein.<br>

In a particular embodiment it corresponds to at least a twofold decrease of the immunosuppressive properties of the original protein, in the modified, i.e., derived protein.<br>
The above defined polypeptide of the invention having 7 to 20<br>
5	amino acid residues and comprising sequence X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2 is such<br>
that X1 and/or X2 are selected to modulate the immunosuppressive properties of a protein and accordingly:<br>
in a particular embodiment of the invention, X1 is an alkaline<br>
amino acid residue and X2 is an aromatic residue or wee versa.<br>
10	As intended herein "alkaline" relates to basic amino acids.<br>
In another particular embodiment of the invention, X1 is an alkaline residue or X2 is an aromatic residue or wee versa.<br>
The inventors have observed that the modulation effect of X1<br>
and X2 on immunosuppressive proteins is lower when only one of X1 or X2<br>
15	residues is modified in an original immunosuppressive protein.<br>
Therefore, modification of both X1 and X2 in an immunosuppression-modulatory sequence may be regarded as advantageous.<br>
In another particular embodiment of the invention, residues<br>
20	X1 or X2 located in amino acid sequence represented as X1-(Y)s-C-(Y)rX2<br>
are selected as follows:<br>
where X1 is chosen among R, H and K, X2 is chosen among F, W, Y and H or where X1 is chosen among F, W, Y and H, X2 is chosen among R, H and K.<br>
25	In a further embodiment of the invention, X1 is R, H or K and<br>
X2 is F, or wee versa.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, X1 is R and X2 is F, W, Y or H.<br>
In another further embodiment of the invention X1 and X2 are<br>
30	selected from the group consisting of:<br>
a. X1 is E, K or Q and X2 is A<br>

b.	X1 isWandX2islorV<br>
c.	X1 is R and X2 is F<br>

The inventors have identified the effects of particular X1 and<br>
5	X2 residues, in a immunosuppression-modulatory sequence on modulation<br>
of the immunosuppressive properties of a viral envelope protein.<br>
Their observations enable to consider that, when X1 is either<br>
glutamic acid (E) or glutamine (Q) and X2 can be alanine (A), the resulting<br>
viral envelope protein comprising the consensus sequence of the invention<br>
10	harbours immunosuppressive properties. To the contrary, when X1  is<br>
arginine (R) and X2 is phenylalanine (F), the resulting viral envelope protein<br>
having the consensus sequence of the invention has low or has no<br>
immunosuppressive  properties.   Interestingly,  whereas  van  der Waals<br>
interactions are suspected in the pair E/A, an electrostatic interaction may<br>
15	occur in the pair R/F, between the positively charged side chain of Arginine<br>
and the pi-electrons (negative pole) of Phenylalanine.<br>
Accordingly, in a particular embodiment of the invention, the<br>
polypeptide    having    7    to    20    amino    acid    residues    has    an<br>
immunosuppression-modulatory sequence X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2  suitable to<br>
20	confer low or no immunosuppressive properties to a protein, wherein X1 is<br>
R and/or X2 is F.<br>
In another embodiment, X1 is K and X2 is F to confer low or no immunosuppressive properties to a protein. In particular, such a protein has low immunosuppressive properties.<br>
25	It is recalled that the immunosuppressive properties are<br>
assayed in a test as defined above and illustrated in the Examples.<br>
The   consensus   sequence,    X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)1-X2,    can    be<br>
identified  in  viral  proteins  and  especially  in  viral  envelope  proteins.<br>
Particular envelope proteins are those of retroviruses that comprise two<br>

respectively between X1 and C and between C and X2, and X1 and X2 are chosen to confer to said polypeptide, altered immunosuppressive properties with respect to the immunosuppressive properties of said determined protein.<br>
15	The term "derived" as used herein indicates that the amino<br>
acid sequence, and especially the immunosuppression-modulatory sequence, in the polypeptide, is modified with respect to the sequence of the determined protein. Said "determined" protein is hence the original protein whose modification is required to modulate its immunosuppressive<br>
20	properties. A polypeptide according to the invention can be derived,<br>
biologically or chemically, from a determined protein by substitution, deletion, addition, recombination or insertion of one or several amino acid residues or sequences, provided the consensus sequence of the invention is such that X1 and X2 are selected to modulate the immunosuppressive<br>
25	properties of the starting determined protein, and therefore provided X1<br>
and/or X2 are mutated by substitution with respect to their original corresponding residues in said determined immunosuppressive protein. In case of sequence insertion, the immunosuppression-modulatory sequence can replace a homologous sequence present in the determined protein, or<br>

Obviously, the invention can be carried out with or without<br>
5	actually starting from said determined protein to derive the polypeptide of<br>
the invention. Hence, said determined protein is a reference for the design<br>
ofthe derived polypeptide rather than a necessary starting material from a<br>
biological or chemical point of view.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the invention, the derived<br>
10	polypeptide has lower immunosuppressive properties than said determined<br>
starting polypeptide and advantageously has substantially lost said immunosuppressive properties, e.g. has no immunosuppressive properties.<br>
The expressions "polypeptide" and "protein" throughout the<br>
present invention define molecules, whatever their length (except otherwise<br>
15	stated in the present description) comprising an amino acid sequence.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the polypeptide or protein is multimeric, especially trimeric.<br>
"Determined" as used herein refers to a starting protein from<br>
which the polypeptide of the invention is designed, i.e., derived to have<br>
20	modulated immunosuppressive properties. This protein can be a wild-type<br>
protein (for example isolated from a viral, especially retroviral, strain) or a protein previously modified (for example expressed from a vector in a host). Such protein is chosen among those having antigenic and immunosuppressive properties.<br>
25	The determined protein has immunosuppressive properties<br>
has defined above: when this determined protein is expressed in tumour cells normally rejected by an engrafted host, it allows these tumour cells to proliferate and to escape immune rejection.<br>
Second, it is an antigenic protein, i.e. it is capable of being<br>
30	recognized by antibodies formed in a host to whom it is administered.<br>
Advantageously it is capable of inducing an immune response, in the host<br>

In view of these desired property of the protein to be<br>
5	antigenic, especially immunogenic, and in view of the required property for<br>
the derived polypeptide to substantially retain these antigenic, especially immunogenic properties, the determined protein used to derive the polypeptide of the invention encompasses native or naturally occurring proteins or antigenic, especially immunogenic, fragments thereof, provided<br>
10	said   fragments   further   have   immunosuppressive   properties.   It   also<br>
encompasses modified proteins with respect to the native or naturally occurring protein, provided the modified proteins have antigenic and immunosuppressive properties.<br>
The determined  protein used as reference to derive the<br>
15	polypeptide of the invention can be a viral protein, i.e. coded by nucleic<br>
acids of infectious agents like viruses, or a protein coded by nucleic acid of viral origin, such as endogenous retroviruses, especially HERV. A particular protein is a protein originating from a subclass of viruses: retroviruses. In a particular embodiment, the determined protein is an envelope protein, i.e.,<br>
20	the expression product of the env gene.<br>
"Nucleic acid" as used herein refers to viral nucleic acids in DNA or RNA forms, including cellular nucleic acids such as genomic DNA, complementary DNA, coding sequences. All the nucleic acid quoted in the present application can be single or double-stranded.<br>
25	The X1 and X2 amino acid residues of the X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)1-X2<br>
motif are chosen as described above.<br>
The above defined polypeptide of the invention derived from an antigenic and immunosuppressive protein and comprising sequence X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2 can be defined as follows:<br>
30	in a particular embodiment of the invention, X1 is an alkaline<br>
amino acid residue and X2 is an aromatic residue or vice versa.<br>

In another particular embodiment of the invention, X1 is an alkaline residue or X2 is an aromatic residue or vice versa.<br>
The inventors have observed that the modulation effect of X1<br>
and X2 on immunosuppressive properties of proteins is usually lower when<br>
5	only one of X1 or X2 residues is modified in an original immunosuppressive<br>
protein.<br>
Therefore, modification of both X1 and X2 is an immunosuppression-modulatory sequence may be regarded as advantageous.<br>
10	In another particular embodiment of the invention, residues<br>
X1 or X2 located in amino acid sequence represented as X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2 are selected as follows:<br>
where X1 is chosen among R, H and K, X2 is chosen among<br>
F, W, Y and H or where X1 is chosen among F, W, Y and H, X2 is chosen<br>
15	among R, H and K.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, X1 is R, H or K and X2 is F, or vice versa.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, X1 is R and X2 is F, W, Y or H.<br>
20	The inventors have especially identified that a polypeptide,<br>
derived from an antigenic and immunosuppressive protein, has altered immunosuppressive properties compared to the immunosuppressive properties of the protein from which is derived when particular interesting X1 and X2 residues are respectively R and F or K and F.<br>
25	The determined protein can advantageously be a viral protein<br>
and particularly a retroviral protein or a protein of viral origin like one of an HERV, having antigenic and immunosuppressive properties.<br>
Known naturally occurring low or non-immunosuppressive envelope proteins of HERV-W, H1, F(c)1 or F(c)2 are not, as such, the 30         object of the present invention.<br>

39	CONFIDENTIEL<br>
In a particular embodiment of the present invention, the polypeptide derived from an antigenic protein has altered immunosuppressive properties and especially reduced immunosuppressive properties, while retaining its antigenic properties.<br>
5	In another particular embodiment, these proteins have, further<br>
to antigenic and immunosuppressive properties, infectious and/or fusion properties.<br>
When the determined starting protein further has fusion and infectious properties, such as those identified for viral envelope proteins,<br>
10	one of these or both properties can be retained, but not necessary, in the<br>
derived polypeptide.<br>
The evaluation or measurement of fusion and/or infectious properties to determine whether these properties of the original determined protein are maintained in the derived polypeptide of the invention can<br>
15	provide useful indications as to whether the derived polypeptide has<br>
substantially retained the structure, especially the antigenic structure, e.g., immunogenic determinants, of the original determined protein.<br>
A protein is said to have fusion properties when cells transfected with nucleic acids encoding said protein are able to form<br>
20	syncytia (multi-nucleated cells) with other cells probably not expressing the<br>
same protein. Indeed, it is suspected that a strong expression of a protein with fusion properties blocks the expression of the receptors of said protein involved in the fusion event. Therefore, the capacity of fusion can be defined by the formation of syncytia between cells expressing said protein<br>
25	with fusion properties and cells expressing its receptor. Cells can be<br>
transfected having recourse to various known methods such as calcium phosphate precipitation or with liposomes, such as Lipofectamine™.<br>
A protein is said to have infectious properties when pseudotypes coated with this protein are able to infect cells. "Pseudotypes"<br>
30	as used herein refers to viral particles in which an ENV protein from a<br>
different strain is incorporated. MLV core particles are currently used.<br>

Pseudotypes are produced in cell lines (such as 293T cells) in which a vector encoding the infectious protein is co-transfected with one or several vector(s) encoding the GAG and POL proteins of another viral strain.<br>
Particular polypeptides having the properties described are<br>
5	derived from viral envelope protein (ENV) and especially retroviral envelope<br>
proteins. Such retroviral ENV can be selected from the group of retroviruses consisting of: MoMLV, Friend retrovirus, FeLV, HTLV-1, STLV-1 and MPMV. Other interesting polypeptides are those encoded by nucleic acids of viral origin such as HERV. As far as viruses are concerned, Ebola<br>
10	and Marburg viruses have ENV proteins from which the polypeptides of the<br>
invention can be derived.<br>
Said envelope protein can be all or part of the native or naturally occurring protein or from an antigenic, especially immunogenic variant thereof, including a fragment thereof, i.e., an analogue of a naturally<br>
15	occurring viral envelope protein as far as antigenic, especially immunogenic<br>
properties, and immunosuppressive properties are concerned.<br>
Within the amino acid sequence of determined proteins described above, inventors have identified particular residues that are involved in the regulation of immunosuppression. Such a sequence, called<br>
20	immunosuppression-modulatory	sequence	which	confers<br>
immunosuppressive properties to a protein is the following: E/Q-G-G-L/T/I-C-A/K/L/MA//I-A, wherein "/" indicates that this sequence position accepts several types of amino acid residues. Thus, proteins comprising an immunosuppression-modulatory sequence selected from the group<br>

indicates that the amino acid sequence, and especially the immunosuppression-modulatory sequence, of the polypeptide is modified with respect to the sequence of the determined protein in order to impact on immunosuppressive properties, especially to decrease said properties.<br>
10	These altered immunosuppressive properties can be the consequence of<br>
substitution of the X1 and X2 residues according to the amino acid characteristics described above.<br>
These altered immunosuppressive properties can also be the consequence of the insertion of the polypeptide comprising X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)r<br>

The sequences given above have been derived by mutation of said X1 and X2 residues in identified naturally occurring retroviral ENV proteins.<br>
The same strategy can be applied with viruses which express<br>
5	proteins presenting a sequence similar to X1-(Y)3-C-(Y)rX2. In particular, the<br>
Y residues can be different amino acid residues from those described above (Benit et al. 2001).<br>
Moreover, the structure, e.g. their 3-dimensional structure of the determined ENV proteins of the present application have been shown to<br>
10	share similar structural features with that of other viruses and especially<br>
with other retroviruses, despite amino acid sequence diversity. Thus, a highly conserved organization of the TM structure has been found in proteins of Ebola or Marburg viruses, most probably relevant to a common mechanism for triggering the fusion process and viral entry. Consequently,<br>

tissue specific promoters can be chosen depending upon the organ in<br>

Other compositions of the invention comprise recombinant<br>

properties for the prophylaxis and or treatment of infections especially viral<br>
infections or for the treatment of detrimental consequences, especially<br>
25	malignant states, including tumors, resulting from the viral infection or also<br>

In a particular embodiment, the composition of the invention<br>
further comprises additional active compounds useful for the prophylaxis or<br>
5	the treatment of infections, especially viral infections, in particular retroviral<br>
infections, including cytokines or useful for the treatment of consequences<br>
resulting from the expression of normally silent ERV.<br>
When used for administration either for systemic or local administration, especially by injection, the composition further comprises a<br>
10	pharmaceutically suitable excipient or carrier and/or vehicle.<br>
Several types of compositions can be used to elicit an immune response against an antigenic polypeptide of the invention.<br>
First, a composition comprising a nucleic acid is administered to a host, for instance injected (known as DMA vaccination) and said<br>
15	nucleic acid expresses in vivo a polypeptide according to the invention.<br>
DMA vaccines usually consist of plasmid vectors comprising eukaryotic promoter, cloning site, a polyadenylation sequence, a selectable marker and a bacterial origin of replication. All these elements are well known to the man skilled in the art. The delivery of naked DMA has shown to be<br>
20	poorly efficient, and some carriers are needed to improve the delivery of<br>
DMA into cells. Two types of carriers have been developed: viral carriers (adenoviruses, lentiviruses) or non-viral carriers such as polymers (and especially cationic polymers), encapsulated-DMA (liposomes) or DMA linked to gold microparticles.<br>
25	Another type of composition comprises a polypeptide of the<br>
invention having altered immunosuppressive properties with respect to a determined protein and having antigenic properties. Such a composition may be immunogenic, i.e. it is capable of elicit an immune response in a host in which it is administered. However, since proteins are sometimes<br>
30	non-immunogenic or poorly immunogenic, an adjuvant can be administered<br>
with the polypeptide, to elicit or improve the immune response. An adjuvant<br>
Demande Internationale n° PCT/EP2005/003339 deposee le 30 mars 2005 PHorite: Demande de brevet europeen n° 04 290 838.4 deposee le 30 mars 2004<br><br>

is defined as any substance that enhances the immunogenicity of an<br>
antigen mixed with said adjuvant. Some adjuvants convert soluble antigens<br>
into small particles, such as aluminium hydroxide gel, oil in water emulsion<br>
or immune stimulatory complexes (ISCOMs). Another class of adjuvants<br>
5	comprises sterile constituents of bacteria such as cell wall or<br>
polysaccharides, Freund adjuvant.<br>
Therefore, a composition comprising a polypeptide having<br>
antigenic properties but altered immunosuppressive properties with respect<br>
to a determined protein is interesting in the elicitation of an immune<br>
10	response in a host in which it is administered and in the production of a<br>
humoral and/or cell-mediated immune response.<br>
Indeed, the administration, e.g., the injection, of a polypeptide<br>
having   non-immunosuppressive   properties   provides   a   more   efficient<br>
immune reaction than the administration of the determined protein (having<br>
15	immunosuppressive properties), because the immune system of the host is<br>
fully functional.<br>
In a particular embodiment, a polypeptide according to the<br>
invention has antigenic, fusion and infectious properties but has altered<br>
immunosuppressive     properties     with     respect    to     a     determined<br>
20	immunosuppressive protein.<br>
Altered immunosuppressive properties according to the invention advantageously correspond to decreased immunosuppressive properties with respect to the original starting protein.<br>
Viral   particles   coated   with   a   polypeptide   having   said<br>
25	properties described above can be constructed in recombinant cell lines<br>
transfected with gag-pol vectors and vector comprising a nucleic acid encoding said polypeptide.<br>
Optionally, these viral particles also express other compounds of therapeutic or prophylactic interest.<br>
30	Interestingly, such viral particles are able to infect and to fuse<br>
with  the cells of a  host,  and  incorporate a  non-immunosuppressive<br>

envelope protein. A composition comprising such viral particles elicits an<br>
efficient immune reaction, better than viral particle incorporating the<br>
determined protein having immunosuppressive properties. Indeed, the<br>
envelope protein is not able to immunosuppress its host, resulting in an<br>
5	optimal immune reaction. Another consequence is that viral particles that<br>
would have the capacity to replicate, due to recombination events which do not involve the ENV gene, would have their propagation in the host limited, since recombinant viral particle cannot evade the immune response.<br>
A composition  comprising viral  particles coated with an<br>
10	antigenic envelope protein with fusion and infectious properties appears to<br>
be an efficient and safe vaccine.<br>
Interestingly, such viral particles can be either replicative (functional) or non-replicative. This can have consequences on the time of residence of the particles once administered in the host and on the quality<br>
15	of the immune response.<br>
All compositions quoted above can be injected in a host via different routes: subcutaneous (s.c.), intradermal (i.d.), intramuscular (i.m.) or intravenous (i.v.) injection, oral administration and intranasal administration or inhalation.<br>

pDFG-envMPMV and its mutant derivatives (Figure 2B) were constructed<br>
by ligation of the Agel-Mlul fragments of phCMV-envMPMV into the pDFG-<br>

10	Fusion property: the Cell-Cell Fusion Assay.<br>
HeLa cells were transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen, 2 jjg of DMA for 5 x 105 cells). Fusion activity of envelope glycoproteins was measured 24 h after transfection with the corresponding expression vectors (Figures 1A, 2A and 3A). To visualize syncytia, cells were fixed in methanol and<br>

to the manufacturer's instructions. The fusion index, which represents the percentage of fusion events in a cell population is defined as [(N - S)/7] x 100, where N is the number of nuclei in the syncytia, S is the number of syncytia, and T is the total number of nuclei counted (Figure 4).

RESULTS<br>
1-	Determination of the infectious properties of various wild-type<br>
envelope proteins<br>
5	The infectiosity of envelope proteins was tested in NIH 3T3 cells (MoMLV)<br>
or HeLa cells (HERV-W and MPMV). Figure 6 shows that the three wild-type envelope proteins (lines 1, 5 and 9) were able to sustain an infection.<br>
2-	Determination of the immunosuppressive effects of various wild-<br>
10          type envelope proteins<br>
The immunosuppressive effect of MPMV retrovirus and HERV-W was<br>
tested in MCA205 cells, injected in allogenic balb/c or syngenic C57BI/6<br>
mice. Figure 7 shows that tumour expressing MPMV (black bars) were<br>
large comparing to tumours expressing HERV-W (white bars). Whereas<br>
15	inventors confirmed the immunosuppressive effect of MPMV envelope, they<br>
showed that HERV-W was not able to immunosuppress an allogenic host.<br>
In conclusion, the envelope proteins of MPMV and HERV-W have the same<br>
properties in term of fusogenicity and infectiosity, but differ for their<br>
20	immunosuppressive properties.<br>
3-	Strategy for the identification of envelope protein with altered<br>
immunosuppressive properties<br>
Based on the different properties  of HERV-W and  MPMV,  inventors<br>
25	attempted to identify domains in the amino acid sequence, which could be<br>
involved in the modulation of immunosuppression.<br>
A putative 17 amino acid immunosuppressive domain (ISU) was previously<br>
characterized in several publications between amino acid 30 and amino<br>
30	acid 47 of the cristallized subdomain, the TM domain, respectively two<br>
leucines (L) in the MoMLV (Blaise et al. 2001 J Viral. 82, 1597-1600).<br>

A two-step strategy was applied; the first step was to modify an envelope<br>
protein that in such a way that the derived protein (i.e., the modified protein)<br>
retains the fusion and infectious properties of the corresponding none<br>
5	modified  protein.  Once such a  modified envelope protein  has been<br>
identified, its immunosuppressive effect was tested and compared to that of the none modified protein.<br>
4- Study of modified HERV-W<br>
10	One difficulty lays in the fact that previous attempts to modify the amino<br>
acid composition of the TM subunit have lead to the loss of association of SU-TM and have altered the infectivity. A deletion from Leucine 30 to Threonine 40 of the MPMV immunosuppressive domain for instance completely abrogates the infectivity of the envelope proteins (Brody et al.<br>
15	1992 J Virol 66, 3466-3475; Brody et al. 1994 Virology 202, 673-683).<br>
Despite these unsuccessful attempts, the inventors studied the amino acid<br>
composition of the ISU domain, and their possible impact on the structure<br>
of the domain and achieve a novel definition of said ISU domain involved in<br>
20	immunosuppressive properties observed in vivo. They further determined<br>
that some positions in the amino acid sequence of proteins together with the nature of the amino acid residues at these positions were critical for the immuno suppressive effect.<br>
25	The inventors especially designed some modifications in the amino acid<br>
sequence of a non-immunosuppressive envelope protein, i.e., HERV-WEnv protein, to render it immunosuppressive, using for instance substitution of determined residues by the corresponding residues of MPMV.<br>

70	CONFIDENTIEL<br>
The A36G and T47I substitutions of the HERV-W envelope do not modify<br>
the infectiosity, the fusogenicity and the immunosuppressive effect of the<br>
envelope protein (Table 1). These two amino acids appear not to be<br>
determinant for these functions. To the contrary, the R44Q or F50A<br>
5	substitutions strongly altered both the infectious and fusion properties of the<br>
envelope protein (Table 1, and Figure 6, lines 2 and 3).<br>
A double mutant comprising both the R44Q and F50A substitutions was<br>
constructed. Surprisingly, the double mutant retained fusion and infectious<br>
10	properties similar to those of the wild type polypeptide (Table 1 and Figure<br>
6, line 4).<br>
This result and the design of this modified envelope protein using some homologous positions found in the envelope of MoMLV (Figure 8) suggest<br>
15	that these two amino acids could interact together because of both their<br>
respective location in the structure of the TM unit of the envelope protein, and their nature. This possible interaction may explain the compensatory behaviour of this pair of mutations. This was unexpected, because of the previous attempts that fail to identify such amino acids.<br>
20<br>
b. Immunosuppressive properties<br>
Another result, as surprising as the above-mentioned, arises from the study of the immunosuppressive effect. Indeed, whereas the wild-type HERV-W envelope protein was not immunosuppressive in view of the size of the<br>
25	tumours, the HERV-W double mutant was more immunosuppressive than<br>
the wild-type MPMV envelope proteins (Table 1 and Figure 7, white bars).<br>
Moreover, inventors identified two amino acids positions in the sequence,<br>
one of which was previously not reported as forming part of the ISU domain<br>
30	(position 50), which,  taken together,  revealed to be involved in the<br>

Firstly, a single mutation seems sufficient to modify the immunosuppressive properties of a retroviral immunosuppressive envelope protein. Indeed, the substitution of the glutamine or glutamic acid in position 44 with an arginine reduced the immunosuppressive behaviour of the mutants. However, the<br>
5	fusion and infectious properties, even if not abolished, are strongly reduced<br>
(MPMV).<br>
Secondly, double mutants (at positions 44 and 50) have reduced immunosuppressive properties when compared to the corresponding wild-type envelope protein. Interestingly, MPMV double mutants have fusion<br>
10	properties as efficient as those of wild-type protein, and high infectious<br>
properties. The interest of such a protein in the production of viral particles and live vaccine is promising.<br>

RESULTS<br>
1. Loss of envelope protein-induced immunosuppression leads to<br>
30	complete immune rejection of an infectious retrovirus: The genetic,<br>
double-mutation-generated disjunction between immunosuppression and<br>

infectivity evidenced in Example 1 opens the possibility to generate an entire retrovirus devoid of the immunosuppressive activity of its envelope protein, but still replicative and infectious.<br>
The Friend Murine Leukemia Virus (FV) was chosen as a model, because<br>
5	the mouse genome does not contain a related endogenous retrovirus that<br>
could impair its in vivo detection.<br>
The key residues of the FV envelope were replaced by those of Syncytin-1 (HERV-W ENV), and it was checked, as for the MPMV envelope, that the double mutation E14R + A20F (which corresponds to the E561R + A567F<br>
10	mutation of the full length ENV) reversed immunosuppression without<br>
altering infectivity (Figures 11A and 11B). The wild-type envelope gene was replaced by its non-immunosuppressive mutant in the FV molecular clone 57, and each type of retroviral particles was produced in vitro. The virus yields were similar as measured by a quantitative RT-PCR assay of the<br>
15	viral RNA in the cell supernatants.<br>
As expected, both virus types display the same propagation kinetics in an in vitro infection assay in NIH/3T3 cells (Figure 11C), and similarly when injected in vivo in 5-Gray irradiated, immunocompromised mice (Figure 12A).<br>
20	In normal mice, the wild-type FV first established high viremia in all mice<br>
during the primo-infection phase (at day 7 after virus injection, Figures 12A-12B). This phase was followed by the establishment of persistent infections, the mice being able to control viral replication to various extents, as expected with non-congenic, outbred mice. After 4 months, 80% of the<br>
25	infected mice disclosed an erythroleukemia syndrome, with a hematocrit<br>
level below 35%.<br>
In contrast the mutated non-immunosuppressive FV was undetectable as early as 14 days after injection of even very high doses of viral copies (106 RNA copies, 102 IDso) with no evidence for any pathology. Noteworthily,<br>
30	IgG directed against the FV envelope protein were detected persistently in<br>
mice infected with wild-type FV, but only transiently in mice infected with<br>

the double-mutant FV (Figure 13), indicating complete clearance of the mutated virus.<br>
In conclusion, the present experiments demonstrate that envelope-driven<br>
immunosuppression is essential for FV infection, as its absence leads to<br>
5	thorough immune rejection of the incoming virus.<br>
2. Increased immunogenicity of immunosuppression-negative recombinant envelope proteins and inactivated viral particles: As the<br>
key element for viral entry into the target cell, retroviral envelope proteins<br>
10	are  systematically  included   in   every  vaccinal  formulation,   either  as<br>
recombinant proteins, as fragments thereof, or as genes carried by a defective viral vector. One could suspect that envelope protein-mediated immunosuppression could inhibit the response mounted against an immunogen containing the ISU, thus lowering its vaccinal efficiency.<br>
15	To test this hypothesis, two kinds of ISU-containing immunogens were<br>
generated: 1) recombinant proteins corresponding to the ectodomains of the TM subunit of the wild-type or mutant FV envelope protein, produced in E.coli as soluble - thus correctly folded - and trimeric forms displaying identical behavior upon purification; 2) wild-type and mutant FV particles<br>
20	that were intact or inactivated by exposure to UV light, in order to preserve<br>
the native structure of their envelope proteins. These immunogens were injected thrice in Swiss mice to generate a strong secondary humoral response. As illustrated in Figure 14A, only the mutant non-immunosuppressive<br>
25	envelope protein raises such a response, with high IgG levels. In every<br>
cases, the signals obtained with plates coated with the wild-type or the mutant TM subunits were quantitatively the same, indicating that the anti-TM antibodies in the mice sera are not preferentially directed against the ISU itself but rather against other epitopes within the TM subunits.<br>
30	Thus, the double mutation introduced in FV envelope protein does not<br>
convert its ISU into a highly efficient epitope. In addition, IgM levels raised<br>
Demande Internationale n° PCT/EP2005/003339 deposee le 30 mars 2005 Priorite: Demande de brevet europeen n° 04 290 838.4 deposee le 30 mars 2004<br><br>

by the wild-type envelope protein are much higher than those raised by its<br>
non-immunosuppressive mutant counterpart. These results suggest that the<br>
immunosuppressive domain of FV envelope protein directly inhibits the<br>
immune system, and that this effect does not require viral entry and<br>
5	replication in the target cell nor even any other viral component than the TM<br>
subunit alone.<br>
Figure 14B confirms these results with MoMLV ENV and HERV-W ENV. Almost no IgG response is elicited against the wild type recombinant TM<br>
10	subunit of MoMLV ENV, whereas the non immunosuppressive double<br>
mutant (see Example 1) shows a strong IgG response. Furthermore, as expected, an IgG response is seen against the TM subunit HERV-W ENV, which is naturally deprived of immunosuppressive activity, whereas the immunosuppressive double mutant (see Example 1) elicits only a slight IgG<br>
15	response.<br>
3. Loss of envelope protein-induced immunosuppression improves the vaccinal efficiency of inactivated viral particles: One could suspect that this antigenicity-inhibiting effect of the ISU might lower the efficiency of<br>
20	any   vaccine   formulation   containing   an   immunosuppressive   envelope<br>
protein, and thus, that the specific, double mutation-induced disruption of this effect might improve vaccinal efficiency.<br>
To test this hypothesis, mice immunized with either wild type and double mutant inactivated viral particles or with intact double mutant viral particles<br>
25	were challenged with the intact wild-type FV. Serum viral loads were then<br>
assayed at peak viremia, five days after challenge (Figure 15). The virus was detectable in  all  mice immunized with the wild-type inactivated FV, yet with a geometric mean viral load 50-fold lower than that of control mice immunized with the adjuvant only, indicating a significant but<br>
30	incomplete protection conferred by immunization with wild-type particles. In<br>
contrast, the viral loads of 6 of the 14 mice immunized with the non-<br>
Demande Internationale n° PCT/EP2005/003339 deposee le 30 mars 2005 Priorite: Demande de brevet europeen n° 04 290 838.4 deposee le 30 mars 2004<br><br>

immunosuppressive inactivated double mutant FV were below the detection threshold of the assay, and the geometric mean viral load was reduced 7500-fold as compared to mice immunized with adjuvant only. Furthermore, the viral loads of 12 out of 14 mice immunized with the intact non-<br>
5	immunosuppressive double mutant FV were below the detection threshold<br>
and the geometrical mean viral load was also below the detection threshold.<br>
These results show that disrupting immunosuppression by mutations that preserve the canonical function - thus the structure - of an envelope<br>
10	protein improves the efficiency of vaccinal formulation based on such<br>
proteins.<br>
