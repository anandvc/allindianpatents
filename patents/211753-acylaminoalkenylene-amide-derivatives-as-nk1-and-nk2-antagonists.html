Qpjfeallv active compounds<br>
The invention relates to the compounds of formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
R is phenyl that is unsubstituted or is substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents selected from the group halogen, lower alkyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy and lower alkoxy,<br>
Ri rs hydrogen or lower alkyl,<br>
R2 is hydrogen, lower alkyl or phenyl that is unsubstituted or is substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents selected from the group halogen, lower alkyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy and lower alkoxy,<br>
R3 is phenyl that is unsubstituted or is substituted by 1, 2 or 3 substituents selected from the group halogen, lower alkyl, trifluoromethyl, hydroxy and lower alkoxy; or is naphthyl, 1H-indol-3-yl or 1-lower alkyl-indol-3-yl,<br>
R4' and R4" are each independently of the other hydrogen or lower alkyl, at least one of the radicals R4' and R4" being hydrogen, and<br>
Rs is Ca-Cacycloalkyl, D-azacycloheptan-2-on-3-yl or L-azacycloheptan-2-on-3-yl;<br>
and salts thereof, to processes for the preparation of those compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising those compounds, to the use of those compounds in the thera-<br>
i 1<br><br>
peutic treatment of the human or animal body or in the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The general terms used hereinabove and hereinbelow preferably have the following meanings within the scope of this Application:<br>
The term "lower" denotes a radical having up to and including 7 and especially up to and including 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Lower alkyl is, for example, Ci-C7alkyl, preferably CrC4alkyl, especially methyl and ethyl, and more especially methyl. Examples of lower alkyl are methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl, n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, n-pentyl, neopentyl, n-hexyl and n-heptyl.<br>
Halogen is, for example, fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine.<br>
Halophenyl is, for example, (fluoro-, chloro-, bromo- or iodo-)phenyl, preferably fluorophenyl or chlorophenyl, especially 4-fluorophenyl or 4-chlorophenyl, and more especially 4-chlorophenyl.<br>
Dihalophenyl is, for example, dichlorophenyl, difluorophenyl or chlorofluorophenyl, preferably dichlorophenyl or difluorophenyl, especially 3,4-dichlorophenyl or 3,4-difluorophenyl, and more especially 3,4-dichlorophenyl.<br>
Trihalophenyl is, for example, trifluorophenyl or trichlorophenyl.<br>
1-Lower alkyl-indoI-3-yl is, for example, 1-methyl-indol-3-yl.<br>
C3-C8Cycloalkyl - and analogously C5-C7cycloalkyl - is in each case a cycloalkyl radical having the number of ring carbon atoms indicated. C3-CeCycloalkyl is therefore, for example, cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl, preferably cyclohexyl.<br>
D-Azacycloheptan~2-on-3-yl corresponds to the following group<br><br><br>
which is derived from D(+)-epsilon-caprolactam (amino-)substituted in the 3-position [ * D-3-<br>
amino-epsilon-caprolactam = (R)-3-amino-hexahydro-2-azepinone]. Analogously, L-aza-cycloheptan-2-on-3-yl corresponds to the group<br><br>
which is derived from L(-)-epsilon-caprolactam (amino-)substituted in the 3-position [* L-3-amino-epsilon-caprolactam = (S)-3-amino-hexahydro-2~azepinone],<br>
Salts of compounds of formula I are especially pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts. Compounds of formula I having a basic group may, for example, form acid addition salts with suitable mineral acids, such as hydfohalic acids, sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid, for example hydrochlorides, hydrobromides, sulfates, hydrogen sulfates or phosphates.<br>
Where the compounds of formula I contain an acid group, corresponding salts with bases are also possible, for example corresponding alkali metal or alkaline earth metal salts, for example sodium, potassium or magnesium salts, or salts with ammonia or organic amines, for example ammonium salts.<br>
The compounds of formula I have valuable pharmacological properties. In particular, they act as neurokinin antagonists (NK antagonists) and are therefore capable of preventing disease symptoms that are caused inter alia by the production of substance P (NK1 receptor) and neurokinin A [ = NKA] (NK2 receptor).<br>
The respiratory tract is equipped with sensory nerves that contain a number of neuropeptides, especially tachykinins and CGRP ( = calcitonin gene-related peptide). The activation of the sensory nerves results in a local release of neuropeptides inside the lungs. More especially substance P and neurokinin A are produced, which trigger an acute inflammatory<br><br>
reaction termed neurogenic inflammation. That inflammatory reaction proceeds mainly via NK1 receptor activation and includes especially vasodilatation, microvascular leakage, recruitment of inflammatory leukocytes and excessive secretion of mucus, and also bronchoconstriction [mainly via activation of the neurokinin 2 receptor (NK2 receptor)]. Those tachykinin effects are typical features of asthma.<br>
The pharmacological action of the compounds of formula I is based especially on the antagonisation of the NK1 receptor and additionally generally also on the antagonisation of the NK2 receptor. The compounds of formula I are therefore capable of inhibiting neurogenic inflammation and tachykinin-induced bronchoconstriction.<br>
The advantageous effects of the compounds of formula I can be demonstrated by various in vitro or in vivo test methods. For example, in vitro they inhibit the [beta-Ala8]NKA(4-10)-induced Ca2+ influx into ovarian cells of transfected Chinese hamsters, which express recombinant human neurokinin 2 receptors, with IC50 values from about 10 nM. Furthermore, in an NK-2 binding assay, in which they are tested for their ability to inhibit the binding of 125I-NKA to hrNK2CHO cells [culture conditions and cell isolation for hrNK2CHO cells, see N. Subramanian et a/., Biochem. Biophys, Res. Comm. 200 (1994) 1512-1520], they exhibit IC50 values from about 1 nM. In addition, they are effective, for example, in vivo in the NK1 bronchospasm test in guinea pigs with ED50 values of about 0.05-1 mg/kg p.o., the test compounds being given 2, 4, 12 or 24 hours prior to the intravenous administration of 3.0 |ig/kg of [Sar9,Met(02)11]-substance P [ = SarSP]. The challenge by SarSP induces an increase in intratracheal pressure in the guinea pigs. Furthermore, some of the compounds of formula I are effective p.o. also in the in vivo NK2 bronchospasm test in guinea pigs. In that case the increase in intratracheal pressure is induced by intravenous administration of 0.8 jig/kg of [beta-Ala8]NKA(4-10), the test compounds being administered, for example, 2 hours prior to the challenge.<br>
The compounds of formula I are effective especially as antagonists of NK1 receptors. Their action on that class of receptors and their action on related receptor systems, for example NK2, render the compounds of formula I therapeutically useful in the prevention, the treatment or the diagnosis of a number of diseases, for example diseases of the upper and lower respiratory tract, for example bronchial asthma, allergic asthma, non-allergic asthma,<br><br>
allergic hypersensitivity and hypersecretion conditions, such as chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis; pulmonary fibrosis of various aetiologies; diseases of the pulmonary and bronchial circulation, such as pulmonary high blood pressure, angiogenesis, metastases; diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, such as Crohn's disease, Hirsprung's disease, diarrhoea, malabsorption conditions, inflammatory conditions; in affective, traumatic or inflammatory disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system, such as depression, anxiety states, migraine and other forms of cranial pain, strokes, emesis; diseases of the blood vessels, such as the cranial vessels; diseases relating to the microcirculation in various tissues, such as the skin and eyes; diseases of the immune system and of the reticulohistiocytary system, such as in the splenic and lymphatic tissues; conditions of pain and other disorders in which the action of neurokinins, tachykinins or other related substances are involved in the pathogenesis, pathology and aetiology.<br>
As already mentioned, the compounds of formula I act as antagonists of substance F, Substance P plays an important role in various disorders, for example in conditions of pain, in migraine and in certain disorders of the central nervous system, such as in anxiety states, emesis, schizophrenia and depression, and in certain motor disorders, such as in Parkinson's disease, and also in inflammatory diseases, such as in rheumatoid arthritis, iritis and conjunctivitis, in diseases of the respiratory organs, such as in asthma and chronic bronchitis, in disorders of the gastrointestinal system, such as in ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, and in hypertension.<br>
The substance-P-antagonising effects can be demonstrated, for example, as follows: in vitro, for example, the binding of 3H-substance P to the bovine retina in the radio receptor assay according to H. Bittiger, Ciba Foundation Symposium 91 (1982) 196-199, is inhibited with IC50 values of from about 0.2 nM.<br>
The invention relates preferably to the compounds of formula I wherein<br>
R is phenyl, 3,5-bistrifluoromethyi-phenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl,<br>
R1 is hydrogen or lower alkyl,<br><br>
R2 is hydrogen or phenyl,<br>

R5 is C5-C7cycloalkyl, D-azacycloheptan-2-on-3-yl or L-azacycloheptan~2-on-3-yl;<br>
and salts thereof.<br>

yi.<br>

RT is hydrogen or methyl,<br>
R2 is hydrogen or phenyl,<br>
R3 is phenyl, 4-chlorophenyl, 3,4-dichIoro-phenyl, 2-naphthyl, 1H-indol-3-yl or 1-methyl-indol-3-yl,<br>

R5 is cyclohexyl, D-azacycloheptan-2-on-3-yl or L-azacycloheptan-2-on-3-yl;<br>
and pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Special mention should be made of each of the following sub-groups of a group of compounds of formula I:<br>
(1) compounds of formula I wherein R5 is D-azacycloheptan-2-on-3-yl; (2) compounds of formula I wherein R4f and R4" are hydrogen; (3) compounds of formula I wherein R is phenyl, 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl-phenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyi; (4) compounds of formula I in free form, that is to say not in the form of a salt.<br>
The invention relates especially to the specific compounds described in the Examples.<br>
The compounds of formula I can be prepared in a manner known perse, for example by<br>
(A) N-acylating a compound of formula II<br><br><br>
with a carboxylic acid R-C(=0)-OH, or with a reactive derivative thereof, or<br><br>
or a reactive derivative thereof, with a C3~C8cycloalkyl-amine or D(+)- or L(-)-3-amino-epsilon-caprolactam, or<br>
(C) as a last step, synthesising the double bond by a Wittig reaction or a variant thereof, for example Wittig-Horner;<br>
and, if desired, converting a compound of formula I into a different compound of formula I and/or, if desired, converting a resulting salt into the free compound or into a different salt and/or, if desired, converting a resulting free compound of formula I having satt-forming properties into a salt and/or, if desired, separating a resulting mixture of stereoisomers, diastereoisomers or enantiomers into the individual stereoisomers, diastereoisomers or enantiomers.<br>
In the following more detailed description of the processes, unless otherwise indicated the symbols R, R1-R3, JV, R4" and R5 are each as defined for formula L<br><br>
Process (A): The reaction according to Process (A) corresponds to the N-acylation known perse of primary and secondary amines, that is to say the formation of arylcarboxylic acid amides from the corresponding carboxylic acids, or derivatives thereof, and primary and secondary amines. One of the numerous possible methods that may be mentioned is the N-acylation of a compound of formula II with a carboxylic acid chloride fVCOCI, e.g. 3,5-bis-trifluoromethyl-benzoic acid chloride, for example in the presence of triethylamine and optionally 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP),<br>
The compounds of formula II are prepared, for example, as follows: the starting material used is a compound of formula IV<br><br>
wherein Pr is an amino-protecting group [for example BOC = tert-butyloxycarbonyl (-COO-tert-butyl)] and Alk is CrCyalkyl. The alkyl ester is hydrolysed to the carboxylic acid, the radical -NHR5 is introduced by reaction with the corresponding amine H2NR5 [formation of -C(=0)-NHR5] and finally the protecting group -Pr is removed,<br>
A compound of formula IV can be obtained, for example, by using as starting material an alpha-amino acid derivative of formula V<br><br>
(e.g. R2=H, R3=phenyl, D-phenylalanine), protecting the free amino group with a protecting group "Pr" [e.g. BOC by reaction with (BOC)20], optionally introducing the group R1( for<br><br>
example by N-alkylation, and esterifying the carboxylic acid radical (preferably to form a lower alkyl ester, especially the methyl ester). If desired, the introduction of the group F^ and the esterification of the carboxylic acid radical can be carried out also in one step, for example with methyl iodide and Ag20 in DMF. The carboxylic acid ester is reduced to the corresponding aldehyde Va<br><br>
(e.g. with diisobutylaluminium hydride in toluene at -78°C) and finally reacted to form the<br>
compound of formula IV in a Wittig-Horner reaction. That can be effected, for example, by reaction with a phosphonoalkanoic acid trialkyl ester of the formula (AlkO)2P(=0)-CHrCOOAIk (Alk = Ci-C7alkyl).<br>
In an advantageous variant of the preparation of compounds of formula IV described above, the known esters of formula Vb (with Alk = lower alkyl, especially methyl)<br><br>
are used as starting material (instead of the carboxylic acids of formula V) and ihen a procedure analogous to that described above is carried out, that is to say the free amino group is again protected by a protecting group "Pr", optionally the group R^ is introduced and the compound is reduced to the aldehyde Va.<br>
If the aldehyde Va is reacted in the Wittig-Horner reaction with a phosphonoalkanoic acid ; trialkyl ester of the formula (AlkO)2P(=0)-CH(-Alk)-COOAIk (Alk = d-C7alkyl), then compounds of formula IV wherein R4" is lower alkyl are obtained.<br><br>
If compounds of formula IV wherein FV is lower alkyl are to be prepared, then, for example, an aldehyde of formula Va can be reacted with a lower alkyl-magnesiurn halide, for example methyl-magnesium iodide, to form a secondary alcohol which can then be converted, for example by Swern oxidation (oxalyl chloride, DMSO), into a ketone of formula Vc<br><br>
The latter is then reacted analogously to the aldehyde Va in a Wittig-Horner reaction to form a compound of formula IV (wherein FV = lower alkyl).<br>
Process (B): The reaction according to Process (B) corresponds to the formation known per se of carboxylic acid amides from the corresponding carboxylic acids, or reactive derivatives thereof, and primary amines. Of the large number of possible methods the following may be mentioned: (1) the reaction of a carboxylic acid of formula III with a primary amine H2NR5, for example in the presence of N-ethyl-N'"(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and 4^dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP); (2) the reaction of a carboxylic acid of formula III first with N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl~N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride in the presence of DMAP to form the corresponding N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and then with the corresponding amine H2NR5; (3) the reaction of a carboxylic acid of formula III with an amine H2NR5 in the presence of 1-propanephosphonic acid anhydride.<br>
The compounds of formula III are prepared, for example, as follows: starting from a com-oound of formula IV, the amino-protecting group is removed, for example in the case of BOC by reaction with trifluoroacetic acid, the amino group is acylated with a carboxylic acid R-COOH (e.g. 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl-benzoic acid), or with a reactive derivative thereof, [analogously to Process (A)], and finally the alkyl ester group is hydrolysed, for example with LiOH in methanol and THF.<br><br>
Process (C): A possible starting compound for the Wittig-(Horner) reaction is, for example, an aldehyde of formula Va in which the amino-protecting group is removed and which is then N-acylated with a carboxylic acid R-COOH (e.g. 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl-benzoic acid), or with a reactive derivative thereof, [analogously to Process (A)]. Such an aldehyde can, for example, be reacted with a phosphonoalkanoic acid dialkyl ester amide of the formula (AlkO)2P(=0)-CO-NHR5 in a Wittig-Horner reaction to form a compound of formula I.<br>
Compounds of formula I can also be converted in a manner known perse into other compounds of formula I.<br>
For example, compounds of formula I wherein Ri is lower alkyl can be obtained by N-alkyla-ting a compound of formula I wherein Ri is hydrogen with a compound Y3-R1 wherein Y3is hydroxy or reactive esterified hydroxy. Reactive esterified hydroxy is, for example, halogen, especially bromine, iodine or chlorine, or sulfonyloxy, for example methylsulfonyloxy or p-toluenesulfonyloxy. Another possible method consists of reacting a compound of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen with a compound Y4-R/ wherein Y4 is formyl and R/ is a radical R1 minus a CH2 group [R1 = -ChVR/], under reductive conditions (reductive amination).<br>
If any intermediates contain interfering reactive groups, for example carboxy, hydroxy, mercapto or amino groups, those groups can temporarily be protected by readily removable protecting groups. The choice of suitable protecting groups and the manner in which they are introduced and removed are known perse and are described, for example, in J.F.W, McOmie, Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, Plenum Press, London, New York 1973.<br>
Salts of compounds I can be prepared in a manner known perse. For example, acid adaition salts of compounds I are obtained by treatment with a suitable acid or with a suitable ion exchange reagent, and salts with bases are obtained by treatment with a suitable base or with a suitable ion exchange reagent. Salts of compounds of formula I can be converted into the free compounds I in customary manner; acid addition salts, for example, by treatment with a suitable basic agent or with a suitable ion exchange reagent, and salts with bases, for example, by treatment with a suitable acid or with a suitable ion exchange reagent.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I, including their salts (of salt-forming compounds of formula I), may also be obtained in the form of their hydrates and/or may include other solvents, for example solvents which may have been used for the crystallisation of compounds in solid form.<br>
Depending upon the nature of the variables and the corresponding number of centres of asymmetry and also upon the starting materials and procedures chosen, the compounds of formula I may be obtained in the form of mixtures of stereoisomers, for example mixtures of diastereoisomers or mixtures of enantiomers, such as racemates, or possibly also in the form of pure stereoisomers. Mixtures of diastereoisomers obtainable in accordance with the process or by some other method can be separated in customary manner into mixtures of enantiomers, for example racemates, or into individual diastereoisomers, for example on the basis of the physico-chemical differences between the constituents in known manner by fractional crystallisation, distillation and/or chromatography. Advantageously the more active isomer is isolated.<br>
Mixtures of enantiomers, especially racemates, obtainable in accordance with the process or by some other method can be separated into the individual enantiomers by known methods, for example by recrystallisation from an optically active solvent, with the aid of microorganisms, by chromatography and/or by reaction with an optically active auxiliary compound, for example a base, acid or alcohol, to form mixtures of diastereoisomeric salts or functional derivatives, such as esters, separation thereof and freeing of the desired enantiomer. Advantageously the more active enantiomer is isolated.<br>
The invention relates also to those forms of the process according to which a compound obtainable as intermediate at any stage of the process is used as starting material and the remaining steps are carried out or a starting material is used in the form of a derivative or salt or, especially, is formed under the reaction conditions. The invention relates also to the end products having the (4S)-configuration described in the following Examples, which likewise have a certain action as NK1/NK2 antagonists.<br>
In the process of the present invention it is preferable to use those starting materials and intermediates, in each case in free form or in salt form, which result in the compounds I, or<br><br>
their salts, described at the beginning as being especially valuable. The invention relates also to novel starting materials and intermediates, in each case in free form or in salt form, for the preparation of the compounds I or their salts, to their use and to processes for their preparation, the variable R being as defined for the compounds I.<br>
The invention relates also to the use of the compounds I and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts in the treatment of allergic conditions and diseases, preferably in the form of pharmaceutical^ acceptable compositions, especially in a method for the therapeutic treatment of the animal or human body, and to such a method of treatment.<br>
The invention relates likewise to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound I or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof as active ingredient, and to processes for the manufacture thereof. Those pharmaceutical compositions are compositions for enteral, such as oral and also rectal, administration, for parenteral administration, for local administration and especially for administration by inhalation to warm-blooded animals, especially human beings, the compositions comprising the pharmacological active ingredient alone or together with customary pharmaceutical excipients. The pharmaceutical compositions comprise (in % by weight), for example, from approximately 0.001 % to 100 %, preferably from approximately 0.1 % to approximately 50 %, active ingredient.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for enteral and parenteral administration are, for example, those in unit dose forms, such as dragees, tablets, capsules or suppositories, and also ampoules. They are manufactured in a manner known perse, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophilising processes. For example, pharmaceutical compositions for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, optionally granulating a resulting mixture and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary after the addition of suitable excipients, to form tablets or dragee cores.<br>
Suitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, for example lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tri-calcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and also binders, such as starch pastes using, for example, corn, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose and/or polyvinylpyrrolidone, and, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned<br><br>
starches, and also carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, or alginic acid or a gait thereof, such as sodium alginate. Excipients are especially flow-conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores are provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings, there being used inter alia concentrated sugar solutions which may contain gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate. Dyes or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.<br>
Other orally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are hard gelatin capsules and also soft, sealed capsules consisting of gelatin and a plasticiser, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard gelatin capsules may comprise the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, if desired, stabilisers. In soft capsules the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, it likewise being possible to add stabilisers.<br>
Suitable rectally administrable pharmaceutical compositions are, for example, suppositories that consist of a combination of the active ingredient with a suppository base material. Suitable suppository base materials are, for example, natural or synthetic triglycerides, paraffin hydrocarbons, polyethylene glycols or higher alkanols. It is also possible to use gelatin rectal capsules which comprise a combination of the active ingredient with a base material. Suitable base materials are, for example, liquid triglycerides, polyethylene glycols or paraffin hydrocarbons.<br>
For parenteral administration there are suitable, especially, aqueous solutions of an active ingredient in water-soluble form, and also suspensions of the active ingredient, such as corresponding oily injection suspensions, there being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate or triglycerides, or aqueous injection suspensions which comprise<br><br>
viscosity-increasing substances, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and optionally also stabilisers.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for local administration are, for example, for the topical treatment of the skin: lotions, creams and ointments, that is to say liquid or semi-solid oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsions; fatty ointments which are anhydrous; pastes, that is to say creams and ointments having secretion-absorbing powder constituents; gels which are aqueous, have a low water content or contain no water and consist of swellable, gel-forming materials; foams, that is to say liquid oil-in-water emulsions in aerosol form which are administered from pressurised containers; and tinctures having an aqueous-ethanolic base; each of which compositions may comprise further customary pharmaceutical excipients, s^^r\ as preservatives* The pharmaceutical compositions for local administration are manufactured in a manner known perse by mixing the active ingredient with the pharmaceutical excipients, for example by dissolving or suspending the active ingredient in the base material or, if necessary, in a portion thereof. For the preparation of emulsions in which the active ingredient is dissolved in one of the liquid phases, the active ingredient is usually dissolved in that phase prior to emulsification; for the preparation of suspensions in which the active ingredient is suspended in the emulsion, the active ingredient is mixed with a portion of the base material after emulsification and then added to the remainder of the formulation.<br>
The dosage of the active ingredient can depend on various factors, such as the activity and duration of action of the active ingredient, the severity of the disease to be treated and its symptoms, the mode of administration, the species, sex, age and weight of the warmblooded animal and/or its individual condition. In a normal case the daily dose for administration, for example oral administration, to a warm-blooded animal weighing about 75 kg is estimated to be from approximately 1 mg to approximately 1000 mg, especially from approximately 5 mg to approximately 200 mg. That dose may be administered, for example, in a single dose or in several part doses of, for example, from 10 to 100 mg.<br>
