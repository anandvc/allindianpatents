				<td>1,5-DIPHENYL-PYRROLIDIN-2-ONE COMPOUNDS AS CB-1 LIGANDS<br>
<br>
The cannabinoid CB-1 receptor (CB-1) is primarily found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and to a lesser extent in several peripheral organs. The cannabinoid CB 2 receptor (CB-2) is found primarily in the immune system.  The pharmacology and therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been reviewed (Pacher, et al. Pharmacol. Rev. (2006) 58, 389)).  CB-1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have been shown effective for reducing feeding and body weight in animal models of obesity.  CB-1 antagonists/inverse agonists have been shown to further potentiate the activity of antipsychotic agents in various assays and may be effective in treating both negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.  In addition, the weight loss effects of CB-1 antagonists/inverse agonists have been demonstrated in animal models of antipsychotic treatment-induced weight gain and therefore may also be effective in controlling the treatment-emergent weight gain and metabolic syndrome seen with current antipsychotic therapies.  Moreover, CB-1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption in animal models of alcohol drinking and therefore may be useful in the treatment of alcoholism and/or substance abuse.<br>
Compounds acting at the CB-2 receptor may have effects on immune function.  Therefore, in developing therapeutic agents active at the CB-1 receptor, it is desirable to have high selectivity for the CB-1 receptor versus the CB-2 receptor to avoid undesirable effects. <br>
A number of centrally acting CB-1 receptor antagonists/inverse agonists have been studied for the treatment of obesity and/or other disorders.  As for example, WO2007/020502 discloses certain substituted pyrrolidin-2-one compounds as CB-1 antagonists.<br>
Oral administration is typically the preferred route of administration for agents for the treatment of obesity and/or schizophrenia.  For compounds to display good oral bioavailability, they typically must have good aqueous solubility and sufficient metabolic stability to minimize first pass degradation in the liver.  Endogenous cannabinoid ligands and the complementary site to which they bind in the CB-1 receptor are highly lipophilic.  Consequently, known CB-1 receptor ligands have also tended to be lipophilic, which leads to poor solubility.  Also many CB-1 receptor ligands have been relatively metabolically labile.  These solubility and/or metabolism properties of many CB-1 compounds have resulted in limited oral absorption and bioavailability.  <br>
Oxidative metabolism of some compounds may lead to the formation of reactive, electrophilic metabolic intermediates.  Such intermediates are prone to reaction with other nucleophiles in the body such as proteins, glutathione, DNA, RNA, etc., which can lead to undesirable toxic effects.  <br>
The pharmacokinetic properties of a therapeutic agent can be influenced by the co-administration of other agents.  These so-called drug-drug interactions may lead to either an increase or decrease in the plasma exposure of the therapeutic agent, leading to problems with tolerability and/or efficacy of the agent.  Compounds which are metabolically cleared through saturatable mechanisms, (e.g. CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2) are particularly prone to suffer from such drug-drug interactions.  Conversely, compounds that inhibit these saturatable mechanisms are prone to cause such drug-drug interactions.  Some known CB-1 antagonists/inverse agonists exhibit such liabilities.<br>
There remains a need for CB-1 receptor antagonists or inverse agonists that have high selectivity over CB-2 receptor, have high in vivo potency (low nM Kb), have acceptable bioavailability, that do not form reactive metabolic intermediates, and that have decreased potential for drug-drug interactions.  The compounds of the present invention provide some or all of these advantages.<br>
The present invention provides compounds of Formula (I)<br>
  (I); <br>
Wherein: <br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, chloro, cyano, trifluoromethyl, difluoromethoxy, and trifluoromethoxy;<br>

and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br>
<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the compounds of the present invention may exist in forms having different points of attachment of particular hydrogen atoms and are thus tautomeric. The individual tautomers as well as mixtures thereof are contemplated within the scope of the compounds of Formula (I) as if specifically drawn.

Additionally, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation adapted for the treatment of an eating disorder associated with excessive food intake, weight gain, obesity, schizophrenia, cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, substance abuse, alcohol dependence, and/or weight gain associated with treatment with an antipsychotic, or for an aid for smoking cessation, comprising a compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.<br>
In the use of the compounds of the present invention in the simultaneous, separate, or sequential combination treatment with an antipsychotic,  an atypical antipsychotic is preferred, as for example olanzapine, clozapine, and/or risperidone.<br>
Compounds of Formula (I) are selective inverse agonists or antagonists for the CB-1 receptor.  The compounds are particularly selective for the CB-1 receptor over the CB-2 receptor.  As inverse agonists (or antagonists) of the CB-1 receptor, the compounds are useful for treatment and/or prevention of conditions associated with the CB-1 receptor.  Such conditions include, for example, eating disorders associated with excessive food intake, obesity, schizophrenia, particularly the negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia, as for example cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia, substance abuse, alcohol dependence, smoking cessation and weight gain associated with treatment with an antipsychotic.  See DSM-IV-TR., Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Revised, 4th Ed., Text Revision (2000).  The skilled artisan will recognize that there are alternative nomenclatures, nosologies, and classification systems for pathologic psychological conditions and that these systems evolve with medical scientific progress.  <br>
The compounds of Formula (I) can also be used to ameliorate weight gain, whether or not the associated weight gain subject can be classified as clinically obese. <br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a cosmetic method of inducing weight loss comprising administering to a human a compound of formula (I).<br>
An effective amount of the compounds of Formula (I) may be administered to a patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis in order to practice the present methods of therapy.  The need for a prophylactic administration according to the methods of the present invention is determined via the use of well-known risk factors. The effective amount of an individual compound is determined, in the final analysis, by the physician in charge of the treatment, but depends on factors such as the disorder to be treated, the severity of the disorder and other diseases or conditions present, the chosen route of administration, other drugs and treatments which the patient may concomitantly require, and other factors in the physician's judgment. The magnitude of therapeutic or prophylactic dose of a compound of Formula (I) will, of course, vary with the patient size and age, the nature and severity of the condition to be treated, the particular compound used, and the desired route of administration. <br>
The dose may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided multiple doses, as for example two, three, or four times daily.  Furthermore, based on the properties of the individual compound selected for administration and/or the characteristics of the dosage form (i.e., modified release), the dose may be administered less frequently, e.g., weekly, twice weekly, monthly, etc.  The unit dosage may be correspondingly larger for the less frequent administration.  When administered via, transdermal routes, or through a continual intravenous solution, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen. <br>
As used above and throughout the description of the invention, the following terms, unless otherwise indicated, will have the following meaning:<br>
	As used herein the term "(C1-C3)alkyl" refers to methyl, ethyl, propyl, and isopropyl.  <br>
	"Halo" refers to a fluoro, chloro, or bromo.<br>
	"(C1-C3)alkoxy" refers to methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy, and isopropoxy.  <br>
“Inverse agonist(s)” shall refer to those compounds which possess negative intrinsic activity by reversing the constitutive activity of the receptor.  Inverse agonists act to inhibit or reverse the activity of agonists.<br>
"Obesity" refers to the condition of having a high amount of body fat.  A person is considered obese if he or she has a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater.  A person with BMI = 27-30 is generally considered overweight.  Conventionally, those persons with normal weight have a BMI of 19.9 to 26.9. The obesity may be due to any cause, whether genetic or environmental.  Examples of disorders that may result in obesity or be the cause of obesity include overeating, decreased physical activity and pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity.  The invention is not affected by the exact definition of obesity by the BMI standard and all such definitions are to be considered as equivalents.<br>
	The term "pharmaceutical" or “pharmaceutically acceptable” when used herein as an adjective, means substantially non-toxic and substantially non-deleterious to the recipient. <br>
	By "pharmaceutical composition" it is further meant that the carrier, solvent, excipients and/or salt must be compatible with the active ingredient of the composition (e.g. a compound of Formula (I)).  It is understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the terms “pharmaceutical formulation” and “pharmaceutical composition” are generally interchangeable, and they are so used for the purposes of this application.  It will also be understood that a pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention will have one or more compounds of Formula (I) and may also contain one or more other active ingredients as desired for a given pharmaceutical composition.<br>
"Prevention" (of obesity or weight gain) refers to preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of the obese condition. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in an already obese subject, such treatment is expected to prevent, or to prevent the progression of further weight gain.  One example of such prevention is to prevent further weight gain in a human undergoing treatment with an antipsychotic.  <br>

Specific preferred compounds of the present invention are those described in the Examples herein, including the free bases and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.  <br>
General Schemes<br>
	The compounds of the present invention can be prepared according to the following synthetic schemes by methods well known and appreciated in the art.  Suitable reaction conditions for the steps of these schemes are well known in the art and appropriate substitutions of solvents and co-reagents are within the skill of the art.  Likewise, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that synthetic intermediates may be isolated and/or purified by various well known techniques as needed or desired, and that frequently, it will be possible to use various intermediates directly in subsequent synthetic steps with little or no purification.  Furthermore, the skilled artisan will appreciate that in some circumstances, the order in which moieties are introduced is not critical.  The particular order of steps required to produce the compounds of Formula I is dependent upon the particular compound being synthesized, the starting compound, and the relative lability of the substituted moieties, as is well appreciated by the skilled chemist.  All substituents, unless otherwise indicated, are as previously defined, and all reagents are well known and appreciated in the art.  <br>
Scheme I<br>
 	In Scheme I, a compound of Formula (II) may be prepared by the method described by Andreichikov and coworkers (Andreichikov, et al. Zhurnal Organicheskoi Khimii 22(10), 2208-13 (1986)), in which a mixture of an amine of Formula (1) and an aldehyde of Formula (2) is treated with an ester of pyruvic acid (3), where Q1 is a C1-3 alkyl group, in a suitable solvent such as glacial HOAc.  Suitable esters of pyruvic acid include ethyl pyruvate.  The reaction may proceed at temperatures between room temperature and the boiling point of the solvent.  In some cases, the product (II) may precipitate during the course of the reaction or upon addition of a solvent in which the product is not highly soluble.  These solvents include isopropyl alcohol and water and mixtures thereof.  If a precipitate is formed, the compound of Formula (II) may be isolated by filtration and vacuum drying or by filtration and chromatography.  Alternatively, the compound may be isolated by concentration of the reaction and chromatography of the residue or by aqueous workup and concentration and chromatography of the organic extracts.<br>
Scheme II<br>
 <br>
In Scheme II, a compound of formula (III) may be prepared by treatment of a compound of formula (II) with water, optionally in the presence of an acid.  This reaction may also optionally be performed in the presence of additional solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, acetic acid and ethanol or mixtures thereof.  A suitable acid includes trifluoroacetic acid and hydrochloric acid.  It is often advantageous to perform this reaction in the presence of at least one equivalent of 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran.  Once the compound of formula (III) has formed, it can be isolated by adding water and cooling to form a precipitate and subsequent isolation of the precipitate through filtration or by adding a mixture of solvents such as toluene and isopropyl acetate and washing with water and saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution.  The organic layer may be dried over a desiccant such as sodium sulfate and concentrated to provide the product as a crude mixture.  The organic layer also may be used directly in the next reaction without further concentration or purification.  <br>
Scheme III<br>
 <br>
In Scheme III, a compound of Formula (IV) may be prepared by treatment of a solution of a compound of Formula (III) with a compound of Formula (4) in a suitable solvent such as toluene, methanol, isopropyl acetate or a mixture of the solvents.  This reaction may also be performed in the presence of a catalyst such as HOAc.  The compound of Formula (IV) can be isolated, if desired, by methods known in the art such as by precipitation or by silica gel chromatography.  <br>
Scheme IV<br>
 <br>
In Scheme IV, a compound of formula (Ia) may be formed by treatment of a compound of formula (IV) under suitable reducing conditions.  Suitable reducing conditions include treatment with NaCNBH3 in the presence of HOAc in a solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.  The compound of Formula (Ia) can be isolated by means such as aqueous workup or precipitation of the product.  Further purification may be performed by use of such techniques as silica gel chromatography.  <br>
In the synthesis of a compound of Formula (Ia) either of the intermediates of Formula (III) or Formula (IV) may be used directly in subsequent reactions without purification of the crude intermediates.  <br>
Single enantiomers of compounds of Formula (Ia) are generally preferred over the corresponding racemates.  These enantiomers may be prepared by resolution of a compound of Formula (Ia) using techniques such as preparative chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase.  The enantiomers may also be prepared by resolution which comprises formation of a salt of the racemic mixture with an optically active acid and purification of the desired diastereomeric salt.  The desired diastereomeric salt may be purified by crystallization.  Alternatively, any of the intermediates of formula (II), (III), or (IV) may be resolved to provide substantially a single enantiomer which may then be converted using the methods described above to provide a compound of Formula (Ia) in its enantiomerically purified form such as compounds of Formula (I).  The intermediates of formula (II), (III), or (IV) may be prepared by resolution of compounds of the corresponding racemic compound using techniques such as preparative chromatography employing a chiral stationary phase.  <br>
Scheme V<br>
 <br>
An alternative and often preferred method for the preparation of purified enantiomers of compounds of formula (III) is outlined in Scheme V.  A racemic compound of formula (III) is reacted with a compound of formula (5), in which Q2 is hydrogen or halo to form a diastereomeric mixture of compounds of formula (Va) and (Vb).  Preferred compounds of formula (5) include R-alpha-methylbenzylamine or S-alpha-methylbenzylamine. This condensation may be performed such as described in previously in Scheme III by combining a compound of Formula (III) and compound (5) an inert solvent.  This reaction may also be performed in the presence of a catalyst such as HOAc. The diastereomers of formula (Va) and (Vb) are then separated using techniques such as silica gel chromatography or crystallization from inert solvents such as isopropanol, or methanol/KOH.  The desired diastereomer (designated (Va)) in Scheme V is then hydrolyzed to form the purified enantiomer of formula (IIIa).  Suitable hydrolysis conditions include treating a solution of the desired diastereomer in HOAc with aqueous hydrochloric acid or trifluoroacetic acid and water and optionally, 2,5-dimethoxytetrahydrofuran.  In some instances, the crude (IIIa) may contain substantial amounts of the dimer of formula (VI).  <br>
In Scheme V, the racemic compound of formula (III) may be crude product resulting from the process outlined in Scheme II.  In addition, the purified enantiomer (optionally containing (VI)) of formula (IIIa) may be used directly from the hydrolysis reaction, without further purification, in the process outlined in Scheme III.  <br>
In Scheme V, the (R)-enantiomer of compound (5) was chosen to exemplify the process.  One skilled in the art will recognize that the (S)-enantiomer of compound (5) may also be used in this process.  The choice of whether to use the (R) or (S)-enantiomer may be made depending on which will yield the desired diastereomer that is more readily isolated.  <br>
Scheme VI<br>
 <br>
In Scheme VI, the compound of formula (IVb) may also be formed by treatment of compound of formula (VI) with compound (4) under the same conditions as described for the reaction of compound (III) with (4)(Scheme III).  <br>
Scheme VII<br>
 <br>

<br>
As mentioned, the compounds of the present invention are selective and highly potent inverse agonists or antagonists of the CB-1 receptor and are therefore useful in the treatment of various disorders by virtue of this pharmacology.  The following assays may be used to demonstrate the claimed compounds’ CB-1 receptor activity, their selectivity for the CB-1 receptor, and their activity in animal models of various disorders believed to be treatable by CB-1 receptor inverse agonism or antagonism.  <br>
It is noted that by definition, a pure antagonist inhibits the ligand mediated activation of a receptor (i.e. blocks agonist dependent receptor stimulation).  Some receptors, including the CB-1 receptor, produce signal transduction even in the absence of agonists (endogenous/exogenous), which is referred to as the receptor’s basal activity  or consitutive activity.  With such receptors, inverse agonists not only inhibit agonist dependent stimulation of the receptor, but also reduce/inhibit the basal activity of the receptor.  In that CB-1 receptors have basal signaling activity, inverse agonists are preferred to pure antagonists as therapeutic agents for CB-1 mediated disorders.  The compounds of the present invention are selective inverse agonists or antagonists of the CB-1 receptor.  <br>
<br>
CB1 and CB2 in vitro functional assays<br>
Compounds of the present invention may be tested for functional activity at the CB-1 and CB-2 receptors in both agonist and antagonist modes using SPA (Scintillation Proximity Assay) based GTP-?-35S binding assays.  All assay components are prepared in assay buffer (20 mM HEPES, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) at room temperature.  Semi-log dilutions of test compound are prepared in assay buffer containing BSA (0.125% final conc.) for the agonist mode assays.  For the antagonist mode assays, test compounds are prepared in the same manner but also include an 80% efficacious dose of a full agonist (methanandamide).  GTP-?35S binding for the antagonist assay may be measured in a 96 well format using a modification of an antibody capture technique previously described. (DeLapp, NW, et al. (1999) J Pharmacol Exp Ther 289:946-955.)  The CB-2 receptor agonist activity may be measured using a similar method using hCB2-Sf9 membranes.  The CB-1 receptor agonist activity may be measured using a whole membrane capture technique using hCB1-CHO membranes.  All incubations are done at room temperature.<br>
<br>
Antagonist Mode Assays<br>
hCB1-CHO and rCB1-CHO antagonist assays:<br>
hCB1-CHO or rCB1-CHO membranes (Applied Cell Sciences, Rockville, MD) and GDP (1 µM final) are added to ice cold assay buffer and homogenized.  Diluted compounds, GTP-?-35S (500 nM final conc.) and membranes are added to wells of an assay plate and incubated for 30 min. at room temperature.  Next, a mixture containing Nonidet P40 detergent (0.2% final conc.), rabbit polyclonal IgG Gai-3 antibody (provided by Covance, Princeton, NJ), and 1.25 mg anti-rabbit antibody scintillation proximity assay beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) is added.  The plates are sealed, vortexed, and incubated for an additional 2 hr.  Plates are then centrifuged at 700 x g for 10 min. and the radioactivity counted. <br>
<br>
hCB1-Sf9 and hCB2-Sf9 antagonist assays:<br>
	hCB1-Sf9 and hCB2-Sf9 membranes (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) are prepared essentially as above with 1 µM (final conc.) GDP for hCB1-Sf9 and 0.05 µM (final conc.) GDP for hCB2-Sf9.  The assay is run essentially as described for the CHO membranes above.  Diluted membranes are pre-incubated with test compound for 15 min., which is followed by addition of GTP-?-35S and a further 35 min. incubation.  Nonidet P40 and anti-Gi-antibody are added sequentially with a 15 min. incubation after each addition.  The SPA beads are then added, the plates are sealed and vortexed, and then incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. <br>
<br>
Agonist Mode Assays<br>
hCB1-CHO agonist assay:<br>
hCB1-CHO membrane, GDP (1 µM final conc.), and saponin (10 µg/mL final conc., Sigma, St Louis, MO) are combined and prepared on ice as for the antagonist assays, above.  Diluted test compounds, GTP-?-35S (500 nM final conc.) and membranes are combined in the assay plate and incubated for 30 min.  Then 1 mg/well Wheatgerm Agglutinin SPA beads (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) are added, plates are sealed and vortexed and incubate for 1 hr. before spinning and counting in the same fashion as for the antagonist assays, above.<br>
<br>
hCB2-Sf9 agonist assay:<br>
The hCB2-Sf9 assay is run essentially as for the hCB1-sf9 and hCB2-sf9 antagonist assays above, with no challenging agonist added.  1 µM (final conc.) GDP is added to the membrane solution and nonidet P40, anti-Gi-antibody, and SPA bead are added together in a cocktail.<br>
<br>
Data are analyzed as follows: Background is subtracted from all wells.  Percent agonist efficacy is determine by normalizing agonist/inverse agonist dose response data to the response obtained for a full agonist (methanandamide).  Percent antagonist inhibition is calculated by first normalizing the data to the signal generated by a saturating concentration of the full agonist (methanandamide).  Then the data are analyzed using a 4 parameter logistic reduced fit (Activity Base™ and XLFit3™ from IDBS, Emeryville, CA).  Kb values are determined using a modification of the Cheng-Prusoff relationship: Kb = IC50/(1 + [agonist]/EC50), where “IC50” is determined from a four parameter fit of displacement curves, “[agonist]” is the agonist challenge concentration (nM), and “EC50” is determined from a four parameter fit of a full agonist concentration response curve (Cheng and Prusoff 1973).  Mean Kb values are calculated as a mean of at least three independent determinations ± standard error of the mean (SEM).  (Cheng YC and Prusoff WH. (1973), Biochem Pharmacol 22:3099-3108.)  Exemplified compounds are found to be potent CB-1 inverse agonists (Kb 500, typically &gt;1000).<br>
Tables 6 and 7 summarize antagonists/inverse agonist properties of certain compounds of the present invention. The data indicate that the test compounds are potent CB-1 inverse agonists at both rat and human receptors and are selective over human CB-2 receptors.  The agonist efficacy being less than zero indicates that the compounds decreased basal (constitutive) activity of the CB-1 receptor in vitro, which characterizes the compounds as inverse agonists at the CB-1 receptor.<br>

Force Swim Test (FST)<br>
The forced swim test is a well established animal model for depression, anxiety and avolition (lack of motivation)(Porsolt, et al. Nature (1977) 266, 730)( J.M. Witkin etal., Trends Pharmacol Sci. 2005 26:609-17).  It can also be used as a model for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia.  <br>
Male NIH Swiss mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley) are housed 12 mice/cage for 7-10 days prior to testing.  On the day of testing, mice weighing 25-30 g, are brought to the testing room at least 1 hr. prior to dosing.  Mice are dosed (p.o.) at 6-8 min. intervals with either vehicle (1%CMC/0.5%SLS/0.08% povidone/0.05 antifoam for CB1 inverse agonists) or test compound and put it into a clean cage (4 mice/cage). <br>
To test, mice are placed individually in clear plastic cylinders (about 10 cm diameter x 25 cm height) filled to 6 cm with water at 22-25 ?C for six min.  The duration of immobility during the last 4 min. is recorded.  A mouse is regarded as immobile when floating motionless or making only those movements necessary to keep its head above the water.<br>
The immobility time (in seconds) is analyzed by ANOVA using Dunnett’s test.  The minimum effective dose (MED) is considered to be the lowest dose of test compound at which a statistically significant decrease in the immobility time is observed versus the vehicle control.  <br>
Bioavailability<br>
	Methods for accessing bioavailability are well appreciated in the art.  One such reference is Medicinal Research Reviews Vol 21 No. 5 382-396 (2001).  Bioavailability of compounds may be estimated essentially as follows.  <br>
	Cohorts of three or four 250-450 gram male Sprague-Dawley rats or approximately 10 kg Beagle dogs (female or male) are used.  Animals do not need to be fasted for the i.v. portion of the study.  Dogs are administered i.v. by cannulated cephalic vein and blood collections are by jugular vein.  Animals are first dosed at 0.25 mg/kg i.v. and blood samples (0.2 mL) are then collected using EDTA as an anticoagulant at 0.0830, 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours.  Next after at least two days and after 18-24 hours fasting, the animals are dosed at 1.0 mg/kg by oral gavage.  During the course of a study the total of blood (ml) collected is not to exceed 1% of total body weight in grams.  Should larger blood volumes be required, the sampled blood volume is replace with heparinized whole blood from a donor animal.  When using a cross-over study design, rats receive a volume of heparinized whole blood following the final sample of each study day approximately equal to that removed during study. <br>
	Compound plasma concentrations are measured by LC/MS/MS assays.  Data are then analyzed using standard non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis.  Oral bioavailability is calculated as:<br>
	 (AUC0-infinity, oral / AUC0-infinity, i.v.) X (Dose, i.v. / Dose, oral) X 100%<br>
	The compound of Example 5 is tested and found to have rat oral bioavailability as follows:<br>
Fasted, male SD rats<br>
IV : 0.25 mg/kg, formulation:  20%v/v MEOP/ 80%v/v purified water<br>
PO : 1 mg/kg, formulation:  1% NaCMC/0.5% SLS/0.05% antifoam in purified water<br>
The oral bioavailability is 51 +/- 19% (mean  s.d, n = 3 rats) and is based on AUC0 24hr.  <br>
<br>
Human CYP Fingerprinting<br>
	CYP fingerprinting is well established technique and is used as an indication of potential risk of drug-drug interactions in the pharmaceutical sciences.  Compounds of the present invention may be assayed by well known methods, essentially as follows:  Compounds are incubated at 37°C at a final concentration of 4 µM with pooled, mixed gender, human liver microsomes and 1 mM NADPH (Nicotine Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate) (final conc.) for 0 and 30 min. without any CYP inhibitor and with each CYP inhibitor in separate incubations for 30 min.  Each inhibitor is specific for an individual cytochrome P450.  The specific inhibitors used for CYPs 2C9, 2D6 and 3A were sulfaphenazole, quinidine and ketoconazole, respectively.  Ketoconazole (CYP3A) is made up at 25 mM in DMSO and then diluted in buffer to a final concetration of 10 µM. Quinidine (CYP2D6) is made up at 5 mM in 50/50 acetontrile/water and then diluted in buffer to a final concetration of 10 µM.  Sulfaphenazole (CYP2C9) is made up at 100 mM in DMSO and then diluted in buffer to a final concetration of 5 µM.  Samples are analyzed by LC-MS in positive or negative electrospray mode using a Waters Acquity Ultra Performance LC coupled to a MicroMass Q-Tof-2 mass spectrometer.  <br>
Data are analyzed using MetaboLynx™ version 4.1.  With inhibitor present, a reduction in metabolite peak area of less than 30% (relative to the uninhibited control incubation) receives a designation of low risk of Drug Drug Interaction (DDI), a reduction in peak area between 30% and 70% receives a moderate risk of DDI and a reduction of more than 70% receives a high risk of DDI.<br>
Exemplified compounds are tested essentially as described and found to have CYP fingerprints as follows:<br>

In Vivo Efficacy in Feeding Models.<br>
The ability of compounds of the present invention to reduce body weight may be tested in a rat feeding model essentially as follow.  Establish diet-induced obese (DIO) male Long–Evans rats by ad lib feeding from weanling on a diet consisting of about 40% fat, about 39% carbohydrate and about 21% protein caloric content for at least 12 weeks.   Administer test compound or vehicle to cohorts of rats (p.o., once daily) for two weeks.  Determine compound potency as the dose required to produce a difference of 17 grams compared to the vehicle group after treatment for two weeks (T17 potency).  This represents a minimally biologically relevant reduction of 3-4% of body weight compared to vehicle treatment after 2 weeks.  <br>
 <br>
Antipsychotic Weight Gain Model:<br>
	The ability of compounds of the present invention to maintain/reduce body weight during treatment with antipsychotics may be tested in a rat feeding model essentially as follow.  Maintain adult lean, female Sprague-Dawley rats ad libitum on normal rodent chow Purina LabDiet 5001 (12.3% fat) and water.  Treat one group (n ~7) with vehicle (1% lactic acid) on days 1-14 while treating the rest with olanzapine (2 mg/kg, po).  Follow food intake, monitor body weight and change in fat mass over a two week treatment.  After 14 days of drug delivery, divide the olanzapine treated animals (n ~8 per group) and treat one group with 0.3mg/kg test compound plus olanzapine, treat a second group with 1 mg/kg test compound plus olanzapine and treat the final group with vehicle plus olanzapine for days 15-28. <br>
