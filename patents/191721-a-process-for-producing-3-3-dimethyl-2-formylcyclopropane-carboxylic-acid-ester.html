Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing 3,3-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopropane-carboxylic acid ester.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
3,3-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester has been known as an intermediate compound of insecticidally effective chrysantliemic acid ester derivatives.<br>
As a process for producing 3,3-dimethyl-2-formyl-cyclopropanecarboxylic ester, for example, there have been known a method of ozone-oxidizing of chrysanthemum acid (for example, GP-B 46-24695), a method of using periodic acid (US-H49) and the like. However, these methods have been not always satisfactory in that the former method has a problem of handling of ozone having a strong toxicity and explosive property, and the latter has a problem in that expensive periodic acid is required.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, 3,3-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopropanecarboxylic esters can be readily produced by using hydrogen peroxide and the catalyst below.<br>
The present invention provides:<br>
a process for producing 3,3-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester of formula (1):<br><br><br>

The catalysts described above may be an anhydrate or a hydrate.<br>
An amount of the catalyst to be used is usually 0.001-0.95 mole per mol of the chrysanthemic acid ester (2).<br>
Hydrogen peroxide is usually used as an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution or a solution of hydrogen peroxide in an organic solvent.     The concentration of hydrogen peroxide in an aqueous solution or in an organic solvent is not particularly limited but it is usually 1 to 60 % by weight in view of production efficiency of the process. A commercially available aqueous hydrogen peroxide solutes<br><br>
is usually used as it is or the concentration of the aqueous solution may be optionally adjusted, for example, by dilution, concentration or the like.<br>
The solution of hydrogen peroxide in an organic solvent can be prepared by extracting an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution with an organic solvent. Alternatively it may be prepared by removing water from a mixture of an aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution and an organic solvent. Said removal of water can be made by isentropic distillation of the aqueous hydrogen peroxide solution with an organic solvent that forms an zoetrope with water or dehydration with a dehydrating agent.<br>
An amount of hydrogen peroxide to be used is usually 1 mole or more per mol of the chrysanthemic acid ester (2) and the upper limit thereof is not particularly limited and it is usually 50 moles or less from an economical viewpoint.<br>
For example, the reaction of 3,3-dimethyl-2-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropanecarboxylic acid ester (2) with hydrogen peroxide may be conducted in a water-immiscible organic solvent by using dehydrated organic solution of hydrogen peroxide or conducted by using aqueous hydrogen peroxide in a water-miscible organic solvent. Alternatively it may be conducted in water or in a mixture of water and water-immiscible organic solvent in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst such as quaternary ammonium salt or the like. The water derived from aqueous hydrogen peroxide added to the * reaction may be removed during the reaction with dehydrating agent or azeotropically.<br>

an ester solvent such as ethyl acetate and the like.<br>
Examples of the water-miscible organic solvent include<br>
an alcohol solvent such as methanol, ethanol, tert-butanol and the like, and<br>
an alkylnitrile solvent such as acetonitrile, propionitrile and the like.<br>

Examples of the dehydrating agent include anhydrous magnesium sulfate, anhydrous sodium sulfate and the like. An amount thereof to be used is not particularly limited and such an amount of a dehydrating agent that can remove water in the reaction system is usually used.<br>
Tungstate (tungstic acid salts) or molybdate (molybdic acid salts) as described above are preferably used together with a mineral acid so as to enhance the catalytic activity of the same by acidifying the reaction mixture.<br><br>
Examples of the mineral acid include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, or boric acid.<br>
An amount of the mineral acid to be used is usually 1 mole or more per mol of the mineral acid.<br>
The alkylrhenium oxide or molybdic oxide is usually used in a dehydrated condition using an organic solvent and an organic solvent solution of hydrogen peroxide. Alternatively the catalyst may be used, preferably in the presence of a dehydrating agent together with aqueous hydrogen peroxide so as to remove water contained in the reaction mixture.<br>
In this reaction, chrysanthemic acid ester (2), hydrogen peroxide, a catalyst and, if necessary, said water-miscible or water immiscible organic solvent may be mixed and the order of mixing is not particularly limited.     The reaction is usually conducted at a temperature of from 0 to 200°C, preferably at 0 ta80°G.<br>
A boron compound may be further added to the present reaction process to help the reaction progress.<br>
Examples of the boron compound include a boric anhydride, a metaboric acid, an orthoboric acid, and an alkali metal salt and an alkaline earth metal salt thereof. An amount thereof to be used is no particularly limited and is usually 1 mole or less per mol of the chyrsanthemic acid ester (2).<br>
The progress of the reaction can be monitored by the conventional analyzing means such as gas chromatography, thin layer chromatography, NMR, IR and the like.<br>
After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture may be filtered to remove insoluble, if necessary,<br>
3,3-dimethyl-2-formylcyclopropanecarboxylic ester of formula (2) can be obtained by, for example, concentrating the reaction mixture.<br><br>
alternatively, it may be extracted with water-immiscible organic solvent after addition of water to a reaction mixture and concentrated to give the desired compound, which may be further purified by such a means as distillation, column chromatography and the like, if necessary.<br>
Examples of the water-immiscible organic solvent include an aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent such as hexane, heptane or the like, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene, xylems or the like, a halogenated hydrocarbon solvent such as dichloromethane, chloroform, chlorobenzene or the like.
