				<td>Description<br>
The invention relates to a pumping station comprising a<br>
building which has at least one inflow chamber and at<br>
least one outflow chamber which is arranged at a<br>
different height, a partition within the structure<br>
being arranged between these at least two chambers, at<br>
least one pump delivering a fluid through a partition<br>
of this type into an outflow chamber of the structure,<br>
the outflow chamber having an outflow opening which is<br>
arranged at an angle to an outlet opening, in which<br>
case the upper edge of the said outflow opening is<br>
situated below a liquid level which prevails in an<br>
outflow arranged downstream of the structure.<br>
Pumping stations, which are also known as water scoop<br>
mechanisms, dyke or discharging scoop mechanisms, water<br>
raising mechanisms, irrigation pumping mechanisms or<br>
under similar terms, have to deliver large amounts of<br>
water with small delivery heads. A general overview of<br>
systems of this type is disclosed by the essay entitled<br>
"Gestaltung von Schöpfwerken [Design of water scoop<br>
mechanisms]", by Helmut Göhrke and Paul Winkelmann,<br>
published in KSB Technical Reports No. 11, August 1966,<br>
pages 28-36. With changing levels on the inflow side<br>
and with fluctuations in the external water levels<br>
arranged downstream of the pumping station, pumping<br>
stations have to cope with different delivery heads.<br>
Since the pumps which are in use, which are essentially<br>
of axial or semiaxial design, discharge only relatively<br>
small delivery heads, the slight fluctuations in the<br>
delivery head, which fluctuations are required for<br>
efficient operation of the system, are a problem for<br>
the design of a [sic] pumping stations of this type.<br><br>
In order to keep the costs of a structure of this type<br>
low, vertical propeller pumps are predominantly used.<br>
For small delivery heads of up to approximately<br>
2 metres the abovementioned essay has disclosed the use<br>
of what is referred to as an open propeller pump. In<br>
this case, a fluid which is to be delivered flows,<br>
directly after having passed the impeller, out of the<br>
pump housing, which is designed to be open on the<br>
delivery side, into the outflow chamber of the pumping<br>
station. As in the case of all pumping stations having<br>
the abovementioned purpose of use, a back flow<br>
preventer has to be arranged on the delivery side of<br>
the pump and is used, when the pump is switched off, to<br>
prevent fluid which has already been delivered from<br>
flowing back. For this purpose, in the case of the<br>
pumping station which is already known, the discharge<br>
opening of the outflow chamber is fitted with a<br>
positively controlled non-return flap which serves<br>
simultaneously as back flow preventer and a shut-off<br>
element, cf. page 31, Figure 3A.<br>
The invention is based on the problem of developing a<br>
pumping station which ensures reliable and<br>
energy-efficient operation with a low outlay on<br>
equipment and structure.<br>
To achieve this object, provision is made for each pump<br>
to be provided with a liquid-conducting device which<br>
runs in a rising direction and has an outlet opening<br>
which is arranged in the outflow chamber above the<br>
upper edge of the outflow opening and is designed to be<br>
open.<br>
This solution means that an additional installation of<br>
a shut-off flap can be dispensed with. And, the device<br>
which conducts liquid in a rising direction can be a<br>
pipe, channel, a tube or a similar formation designed<br>
as part of the structure. The saving which is possible<br>
as a result on a hitherto necessary shut-off flap<br><br>
increases the operational reliability considerably with<br>
a simultaneous reduction in the investment costs. This<br>
is because shut-off flaps of this type constitute a<br>
maintenance-intensive and fault-prone component as a<br>
consequence of the control necessary for their<br>
operation and the moving components which are<br>
frequently underwater.<br>
One refinement of the invention makes provision for the<br>
upper edge of the outflow opening to be part of an<br>
adjustable opening. Therefore, in the development of a<br>
standardized structure for a pumping station,<br>
adaptation of the structure to the respective maximum<br>
and minimum levels on the outflow side of the pumping<br>
station can take place in a very simple manner by means<br>
of a simple matching of the upper edge of the outflow<br>
opening to the height of the outlet opening, which is<br>
designed to be open, of the liquid-conducting device.<br>
In the planning or production of the pumping station,<br>
adaptation to the predetermined levels of the inflow<br>
and outflow channels situated outside the structure can<br>
take place by simply varying a framework defining the<br>
upper edge of the outflow opening. The upper edge may<br>
also be part of a height-adjustable device or of a<br>
device which can be adjusted during operation.<br>
Another refinement of the invention makes provision for<br>
a delivery-flow measuring device to be arranged in the<br>
liquid-conducting device and/or in the region of the<br>
outflow opening. Also, according to a further<br>
refinement of the invention, an outflow channel, a pipe<br>
or the like, running predominantly horizontally and<br>
having a delivery-flow measuring device arranged in it<br>
can be arranged downstream of the outflow opening. A<br>
delivery-flow measuring device of this type enables<br>
monitoring to an extent even including remote diagnosis<br>
or remote maintenance of a pumping station in a very<br>
simple manner. With the aid of a delivery-flow signal<br>
which can be transmitted in various known ways, it can<br><br>
be ascertained whether the pumping station is operating<br>
correctly.<br>
In order to reduce the outlay on measurement technology<br>
during measurement of a delivery flow, provision is<br>
made for a cross section which is used for measurinq<br>
the delivery flow and through which the flow passes or<br>
a volume region through which the flow passes to be<br>
completely filled with the delivery fluid. For this<br>
purpose, a highest point of a measured-value detection<br>
region of this type, which is generally arranged in<br>
part of the flow path on the delivery side, lies below<br>
the lowest water level on the outflow side. The<br>
continuous and complete filling of a measuring section<br>
of this type can take place by means of its local lower<br>
positioning or by means of an overflow threshold<br>
arranged at the end thereof. The cross section which is<br>
used for the measuring and through which the flow<br>
passes should always be below the lowest level on the<br>
outflow side on which a design of a pumping station of<br>
this type is based. The arrangement of a type of<br>
overflow threshold at the end of a measured section of<br>
this type enables the structural outlay in the case of<br>
excavation works to be reduced. Fluctuations in the<br>
height on the outflow side are therefore unable to have<br>
an -effect on the level in the measured section. The<br>
same effect can be achieved with a measured section on<br>
the outflow side, which is designed in the manner of a<br>
drain. Section guidance of this type, which makes use<br>
of the principle of communicating tubes, ensures<br>
complete filling of liquid in the pipe, the tube, the<br>
channel or the like which is used for measuring the<br>
delivery flow.<br>
According to another refinement of the invention, a<br>
pump is fitted with fixed and/or adjustable running<br>
and/or conducting devices. The use of adjusting devices<br>
of this type is dependent on the operating conditions<br>
which are used for the pumping station: Although the<br><br>
use of pump designs of this type in a pumping station<br>
increases the investment costs, they bring about an<br>
improvement in the efficiency compared to what are<br>
referred to as rigid, i.e. nonadjustable pumps. This<br>
also brings about a considerable reduction in the power<br>
costs, as a result of which a system of this type can<br>
be operated more cost-effectively, as considered over a<br>
prolonged operating period. The saving on the costs of<br>
energy reduces the costs of the lifecycle of the system<br>
for the operator.<br>
According to another refinement of the invention, the<br>
device conducting the liquid in a rising direction runs<br>
vertically or inclined, in which case the outlet<br>
opening is arranged parallel or inclined with respect<br>
to the liquid level. If the spatial constructions of<br>
the outflow chamber require a different arrangement or<br>
position of the outlet opening for flow engineering<br>
and/or location-specific reasons, then the surface of<br>
the outlet opening can also run at an angle and/or<br>
inclined with respect to the horizontal. In this case,<br>
as in the case of an outlet opening running<br>
horizontally, it merely has to be ensured that a<br>
lowermost edge of the outlet opening is always situated<br>
above the highest liquid level taken as a basis on the<br>
outflow side in the planning of the pumping station.<br>
When a pump is switched off, this measure prevents<br>
fluid which has already been delivered from flowing<br>
back into the inflow chamber via the outlet opening and<br>
through the pump.<br>
The outlet opening, or the lowest edge thereof, is<br>
always situated, even if only slightly, above the<br>
maximum liquid level which occurs. This also gives rise<br>
to a further substantial advantage in that the siphon<br>
effect, which is known per se, can be used for a<br>
pumping station of this type. The construction of the<br>
pumping station in terms of structure can therefore be<br>
directly designed as a siphon without the hitherto<br><br>
known, special siphon pipes additionally having to be<br>
installed. In this case, the outlet opening of the<br>
liquid-conducting device which is arranged downstream<br>
of a pump forms the lower apex of the siphon. The<br>
design of the discharge chamber as a siphon is directly<br>
associated with the energy-saving potential of the<br>
pumping station through recovery of the geodetic<br>
difference in height between the lower apex of the<br>
siphon and the level on the outflow side. This is<br>
ensured by the position of the upper edge of the<br>
outflow opening at the height of the lowest level on<br>
the outflow side.<br>
When the pump is switched off the outflow chamber of<br>
the pumping station is ventilated with the aid of a<br>
valve causing the siphon effect to be cancelled.<br>
Leak-proof construction of the outflow chamber is<br>
possible without problem during erection of the<br>
structure, since the latter can be designed in a cost-<br>
effective manner as a concrete construction. In order<br>
to improve the sealing effect in the outflow chamber,<br>
coatings which provide a seal in an appropriate manner<br>
can be applied in a simple manner to the wall surfaces<br>
of the said outflow chamber. Such a construction of the<br>
pumping station enables the hitherto used, long siphon<br>
pipes to be dispensed with. On account of the low<br>
reflux quantities in this solution, the outlay on<br>
securing measures on the pump side against back flows<br>
can be entirely omitted or, under some circumstances,<br>
retained at just a low level.<br>
In order to enable starting up even in special cases<br>
with an increased power consumption in the partial-load<br>
region of the pump, a vacuum system for eliminating air<br>
from the outflow chamber may additionally be provided.<br>
The said vacuum system would then operate only during<br>
the starting-up process of the pump. Depending on the<br>
design of the pumping station and the operating<br>
conditions thereof it would have to be decided whether<br><br>
preference is given, for example, to a more powerful<br>
drive motor for the pump or to a vacuum system.<br>
In this respect, a further refinement of the invention<br>
makes provision for a drive unit of a pump of a design<br>
without a shaft seal to be arranged above the outflow<br>
chamber. The drive unit, for example an electric motor<br>
or internal combustion engine, with or without a gear<br>
mechanism connected in between, is arranged here at a<br>
height which lies above the highest level which occurs<br>
with respect to the pumping station. The outflow<br>
chamber would be connected here to the surroundings.<br>
The dynamic pressure components of the flow which exist<br>
in the liquid-conducting device and are produced by the<br>
pump are not sufficient to bridge the height and reach<br>
as far as the drive unit.<br>
In the case of an outflow chamber which is sealed and<br>
forms part of a siphon, sealing with respect to a drive<br>
unit which is mounted outside the outflow chamber is<br>
undertaken with known means. In pump designs where a<br>
drive is set up to be dry, a drive shaft has to be<br>
introduced into the outflow chamber. In this case, a<br>
dynamically acting shaft seal can be saved on by means<br>
of a shaft protective tube which is connected in a<br>
static and leakproof manner to the outflow chamber and<br>
surrounds a drive shaft. The said tube projects with<br>
one open end into the outflow chamber and its length is<br>
selected in such a manner that a backing-up pressure is<br>
formed therein on account of the flowing delivery<br>
fluid. This backing-up pressure prevents, in<br>
association with the rise in pressure caused by the<br>
flow losses in the outflow chamber, which is connected<br>
downstream of the outlet opening, and outflow devices<br>
connected in turn downstream of the said outflow<br>
chamber, air from entering from the surroundings into<br>
the outflow chamber and into the liquid-conducting<br>
device prevents [sic] . A shaft seal for the pump shaft<br>
can therefore be saved on, since a liquid level arises<br><br>
in the shaft protective tube and because of said liquid<br>
level air would not be abie to enter the outflow<br>
chamber from the outside and have an adverse effect on<br>
its siphon effect. In those cases in which distenable<br>
hydraulic equipment is used, the shaft protective tube<br>
can also be used for suspending the hydraulic unit from<br>
the pump.<br>
Also, in order to prevent the delivered fluid from<br>
flowing back when the pump is switched off, the outflow<br>
chamber can be provided with a ventilating means. A<br>
valve which is used for this purpose and is situated<br>
with associated connecting pipes in that region of the<br>
pumping station which is arranged such that it is dry<br>
is easily accessible, is of small overall height, can<br>
be actuated in a very simple manner and, when required,<br>
interrupts the siphon effect.<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the invention are illustrated<br>
in the drawings and are described in greater detail<br><br>
below. In theaccompanying drawings<br>
Fig. 1 shows a pumping station of a simple design,<br>
Figs 2 and 3 show pumping stations having an integrated<br>
measurement channel,<br>
Fig. 4 shows a pumping station having an obliquely<br>
arranged pump, and<br>
Fig. 5 shows a pumping station having a horizontally<br>
arranged pump.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a pumping station 1 which has an inflow<br>
chamber 2 and an outflow chamber 3. Within the inflow<br>
chamber 2, which can be designed to be open or covered<br>
and in which a fluid which is to be delivered flows in<br>
from an external source, two levels of the liquid to be<br>
delivered are shown. LLWLin stands here for the lowest<br><br>
low water level and HHWLin stands here for the highest<br>
high water level which can occur on the inflow side of<br>
this pumping station 1.<br>
A partition 4 through which a pump 5 extends in a<br>
vertical arrangement is arranged on the upper side of<br>
the inflow chamber 2. One or more impellers - not<br>
illustrated here - are arranged in the lower part of<br>
the pump 5. A drive unit 6 arranged above the pump 5<br>
brings about the drive of the pump 5. The transmission<br>
of power between the drive unit 6 and pump 5 takes<br>
place by means of a shaft 7. The drive unit 6 rests by<br>
customary fastening means on the cover 8 of the outflow<br>
chamber 3. In the example shown, the drive unit 6 is<br>
fastened on the cover 8 in an air-tight manner, so that<br>
the outflow chamber 3 itself exerts a siphon effect.<br>
The housing of the vertically arranged pump 5 is<br>
designed as a liquid-conducting device 9 which has an<br>
outlet opening 10 which is designed to be open and<br>
extends parallel to the liquid level. The outlet<br>
opening 10 lies at a height which is at least level<br>
with or lies above the highest high water level HHWLout<br>
on the side of the pumping station 1 having the outflow<br>
11. The liquid-conducting device 9, which is designed<br>
here as a rising tube, opens with the open tube end or<br>
the outlet opening 10 into the closed outflow chamber<br>
3, which is designed to be liquid-tight with respect to<br>
the inflow chamber 2. The outflow chamber 3 has an<br>
outflow opening 12 through which a connection is<br>
produced with the outflow 11 which is arranged<br>
downstream of the pumping station 1. Two levels are<br>
likewise shown in the outflow 11. The level LLWLout<br>
marks the lowest low water level here and the level<br>
HHWLout marks the highest attainable level on the<br>
outflow side.<br>
The upper edge 13 of the outflow opening 12 from the<br>
outflow chamber 3 lies here at maximum at the level of<br><br>
the lowest level LLWLout. The outlet opening 10 of the<br>
liquid-conducting device 9 is situated at least at the<br>
height of the highest high water level HHWLout on the<br>
outflow side 11. The pump 5 therefore only has to<br>
produce at most the same delivery power as is necessary<br>
at the simultaneously lowest LLWLin in the inflow<br>
chamber in order to achieve the highest water level<br>
HHWLout.<br>
The upper edge 13 of the outflow opening 12 is part of<br>
an adjustable opening. Adaptation of the structure to<br>
the respective maximum and minimum levels HHWLout and<br>
LLWLout on the outflow side 11 of the pumping station 1<br>
takes place in a very simple manner by simple matching<br>
of the upper edge 13 of the outflow opening 12 to the<br>
height of the outlet opening 10, which is designed to<br>
be open, of the liquid-conducting device 9. Adaptation<br>
to the predetermined levels of the inflow and outflow<br>
channels situated outside the structure takes place by<br>
simply varying the upper edge. The upper edge is<br>
illustrated here as part of a height-adjustable device.<br>
It can be fastened tightly in the outflow chamber by<br>
means of customary fastening means. In the event of<br>
sharply fluctuating levels on the side having the<br>
outflow 11, it is a matter of calculation as to<br>
whether, for reasons of energy saving, the upper edge<br>
13 is designed as a device which can be adjusted during<br>
operation.<br>
Sensors 14 of flow-measuring instruments can be<br>
arranged within the liquid-conducting device 9, in the<br>
region of the outflow opening 12 or in the outflow 11.<br>
In order, when the pump 5 is switched off, to prevent a<br>
backflow of the delivery fluid from the side having the<br>
outflow 11, the outflow chamber 3 has a ventilating<br>
means 15. This consists here of piping having a<br>
ventilation valve arranged on it. If a ventilation<br>
valve of this type is opened, then the frictional<br><br>
engagement of a returning column of liquid is<br>
interrupted in the outflow chamber 3, which, is designed<br>
as a siphon, by the introduction of air.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a pumping station 1 in which a measuring<br>
channel 16 is arranged downstream on [sic] the outflow<br>
opening 12 of the outflow chamber 3. In this measuring<br>
channel 16, the highest point is situated at maximum at<br>
the level of the lowest low water level LLWLout. The<br>
complete filling of the measuring channel 16 with<br>
liquid is therefore ensured, as a result of which<br>
simple delivery-flow measuring instruments, for example<br>
ultrasound sensors 14, can be used for measuring the<br>
delivery flow. Air locks which falsify a measurement<br>
are avoided as a result. In order to ensure the<br>
continuous filling of the measuring channel, an<br>
overflow threshold 17 can be arranged in the outflow 11<br>
of the pumping station 1. The height 17.1 of the said<br>
overflow threshold is dimensioned in such a manner that<br>
a minimum water level LLWLout in the measuring channel<br>
16 remains ensured in all operating states. In<br>
principle, a measuring channel 16 designed in such a<br>
manner is formed as a drain. The pumping station shown<br>
in Fig. 2 to such an extent illustrates a combination<br>
of pump with siphon arranged downstream and drain<br>
arranged downstream of the siphon.<br>
Since, in this exemplary embodiment of a pumping<br>
station of this type, the outflow chamber 3 is of<br>
smaller design, preference would be given, on account<br>
of the structural circumstances, to a rising tube 9<br>
having an obliquely running outlet opening 10. The<br>
lower edge 18 of the open outlet opening 10 always runs<br>
level with or slightly above the highest high water<br>
level HHWLout on the side having the outflow 11.<br>
In Fig. 3, the liquid-conducting device 9 is designed<br>
as a direct part of the structure of the pumping<br>
station 1 where it is part of the concrete<br><br>
construction. Lowered into it is a pump 5 which is<br>
designed as a submersible motor-driven pump and whose<br>
drive motor has the fluid being delivered washing<br>
around it. A design of this type can be fitted very<br>
easily and can easily be lifted out for possible<br>
maintenance purposes. The driving energy required is<br>
introduced by electric supply cables 20. The principle<br>
of operation is the same as for the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 1. In addition, a vacuum system 21 for eliminating<br>
air from the outflow chamber 3 is provided. It enables<br>
the pumping station 1 to be started up, in special<br>
cases, and can open into the installation opening 8.1,<br>
be combined with the ventilating means 15 or arranged<br>
in another manner.<br>
For maintenance work in the region of the inflow and<br>
outflow 2, 11 and in the region of the pump 5 having<br>
the associated drive unit 6, there are also used, in<br>
the illustrated exemplary embodiments of the pumping<br>
stations, hoists with which work of this type is<br>
facilitated. The inflow chamber 2 is designed here so<br>
that it is partially covered, since it has a covered<br>
inflow compartment 2.1 from which the pump 5 draws in<br>
its intake. At low levels, the formation of<br>
disadvantageous, air-trapping eddies are therefore<br>
avoided.<br>
Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of a pumping station 1<br>
having an obliquely arranged pump 5. In order to<br>
realize a saving on costs for the structure of the<br>
pumping station, a submersible motor-pump unit is<br>
fitted into the obliquely running, liquid-conducting<br>
device 9. Pumps 5 of this type, which are also known as<br>
submersible motor-driven pumps, have a continuously<br>
submerged and very low-maintenance motor. The outlet<br>
opening 10 of the liquid-conducting device 9 can - as<br>
shown - run obliquely with respect to the levels<br>
present in the pumping station. The oblique position<br>
selected is dependent on the local circumstances at the<br><br>
installation site. Situated in the cover 8 of the<br>
outflow chamber 3 is an installation opening 8.1, which<br>
can be closed in an air-tight manner, for the<br>
installation, inspection and the like of the pump<br>
arranged lowered into the - inflow chamber 2. Even in<br>
such a design of a pumping station 1, a delivery-flow<br>
measuring device having associated sensors 14 can be<br>
used in a measuring channel 16.<br>
The liquid-conducting device 9 has, in the region of<br>
the pump 5 which is lowered into it, a round cross<br>
section which merges into an angular cross section in<br>
the direction of outlet opening 10. In the case of<br>
those structural components which are formed as a<br>
concrete construction, the angular cross sections which<br>
are used reduce the production costs and lower the<br>
operating costs of the pumping station, since there is<br>
the simple option as a result of using relatively large<br>
cross-sectional surfaces through which the flow passes.<br>
The lower edge 18 of the outlet opening 10 is arranged<br>
at least at the level of the level HHLWout. Such a<br>
design of a pumping station can be produced very<br>
compactly and is accessible. A pump 5 can therefore be<br>
lowered onto the installation site directly from a<br>
motor vehicle delivering if. In this compact design of<br>
a pumping station, the function of the partition 4 is<br>
taken over by the liquid-conducting device 9.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a pumping station 1 having a horizontally<br>
arranged pump 5 and likewise in a compact design<br>
similarly to Fig. 4. The pump 5 can be a single- or<br>
multi-stage submerged motor-driven pump. The partition<br>
4 between the inflow chamber 2 and outflow chamber 3 is<br>
arranged vertically. The pump 5 delivers directly into<br><br>
the upper edge 13 of the outflow opening 12 is arranged<br>
at a relatively low height. The outlet opening 10 is<br>
arranged here at least at the same height as the<br>
highest attainable high water level HHWLout on the<br>
outflow side 11. Therefore, only the pump delivery head<br>
required for the particular level is necessary for<br>
changing operating water levels (for example LLWL) in<br>
the outflow channel.<br>
In the schematic illustrations of the exemplary<br>
embodiments of Figs 1 to 5, the transitions in the<br>
structures between the different flow paths are<br>
illustrated in a simplified manner having sharp-edge<br>
transitions. In the case of systems implemented in<br>
practice, the flow paths are, of course, optimized in<br>
order to reduce the resistances. The cross sections of<br>
the flow paths are of extremely large dimensions on<br>
account of the design of the pumping station. The<br>
transitions are designed in accordance with the flow<br>
quantities flowing through them. In contrast to the<br>
known designs, in which a siphon system is formed by<br>
flow-conducting piping, the overall efficiency of a<br>
pumping station 1 can be significantly increased by<br>
measures of this type. Integrating a siphon in this<br>
manner directly into the. structure of the pumping<br>
station simplifies the design thereof to a quite<br>
substantial extent.<br><br>
