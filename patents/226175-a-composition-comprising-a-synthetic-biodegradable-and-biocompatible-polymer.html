				<td>ALKYD-LACTONE COPOLYMERS FOR MEDICAL APPLICATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to biodegradable.<br>
biocompatible polymers for use in pharmaceutical and<br>
medical applications and to compositions and medical<br>
devices containing such polymers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Both natural and synthetic polymers, including<br>
homopolymers and copolymers, which are both<br>
biocompatible and biodegradable in vivo are known for<br>
use in the manufacture of medical devices that are<br>
implanted in body tissue and that are absorbed or passed<br>
by the body over time. Examples of such medical devices<br>
include suture anchor devices, sutures, staples,<br>
surgical tacks, clips, plates, screws, drug delivery<br>
devices, adhesion prevention films and foams, and tissue<br>
adhesives.<br>
Natural polymers may include catgut, cellulose<br>
derivatives and collagen. Natural polymers typically are<br>
absorbed by the body after an enzymatic degradation<br>
process of the polymers in the body.<br><br>
Synthetic polymers may include aliphatic<br>
polyesters, polyanhydrides and poly(orthoester)s. Such<br>
polymers typically degrade by a hydrolytic mechanism in<br>
the body and then are absorbed by the body. Such<br>
synthetic absorbable polymers include homopolymers, such<br>
as poly(glycolide), poly(lactide), poly(e-caprolactone),<br>
poly(trimethylene carbonate) and poly(p-dioxanone), and<br>
copolymers, such as poly(lactide-co-glycolide) , poly(e-<br>
caprolactone-co-glycolide), poly(glycolide-co-<br>
trimethylene carbonate), poly(alkylene diglycolate), and<br>
polyoxaesters. The polymers may be statistically random<br>
copolymers, segmented copolymers, block copolymers or<br>
graft copolymers.<br>
Alkyd-type polyesters prepared by the<br>
polycondensation of a polyol, polyacid and fatty acid<br>
are used in the coating industry in a variety of<br>
products, including chemical resins, enamels, varnishes<br>
and paints. These polyesters also are used in the food<br>
industry to make texturized oils and emulsions for use<br>
as fat substitutes.<br>
There is a great need for polymers for use in drug<br>
delivery and medical devices, where the polymers have<br>
both low melting temperatures and low viscosities upon<br>
melting, thus permitting for solvent-free processing<br>
techniques in preparation of medical devices and<br>
compositions, can crystallize rapidly, and biodegrade<br>
within 6 months. There is also a need for polymers that<br>
can form injectable microdispersions for delivery of<br><br>
unstable drugs such as proteins.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to synthetic,<br>
biodegradable, biocompatible polymers comprising the<br>
reaction product of a polybasic acid or derivative<br>
thereof, a monoglyceride and a lactone, and to<br>
compositions for use in medical applications and medical<br>
devices containing such polymers.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OP THE INVENTION<br>
Alkyd polymers have been prepared by several known<br>
methods. For example, alkyd-type polymers were prepared<br>
by Van Bemmelen (J. Prakt. Chem., 69 (1856) 84) by<br>
condensing succinic anhydride with glycerol. In the<br>
"Fatty Acid" method (see Parkyn, et al. Polyesters<br>
(1967), Iliffe Books, London, Vol. 2 and Patton, In:<br>
Alkyd Resins Technology, Wiley-Interscience New York<br>
(1962)), a fatty acid, a polyol and an anhydride are<br>
mixed together and allowed to react. The "Fatty Acid-<br>
Monoglyceride" method includes a first step of<br>
esterifying the fatty acid with glycerol and, when the<br>
first reaction is complete, adding an acid anhydride.<br>
The reaction mixture then is heated and the<br>
polymerization reaction takes place. In the "Oil-<br>
Monoglyceride" method, an oil is reacted with glycerol<br>
to form a mixture of mono-, di-, and triglycerides.<br>
This mixture then is polymerized by reacting with an<br><br>
acid anhydride.<br>
The synthetic, biodegradable , biocompatible<br>
polymers utilized in the present invention are the<br>
reaction product of a polybasic acid or derivative<br>
thereof, a monoglyceride, and a lactone, and may be<br>
classified as alkyd-lactone copolymers. Preferably, the<br>
polymers of the present invention are prepared by the<br>
polycondensation first of a polybasic acid, or<br>
derivative thereof, with a monoglyceride to form an<br>
alkyd polyester prepolymer. The monoglyceride comprises<br>
reactive hydroxy groups and fatty acid groups. The alkyd<br>
polyester prepolymer is reacted with one or more lactone<br>
monomers to form the alkyd-lactone copolymers of the<br>
present invention. The expected hydrolysis byproducts<br>
are glycerol, hydroxyacid(s), dicarboxylic acid(s), and<br>
fatty acid(s), all of which are biocompatible. The<br>
polymers comprise an aliphatic polyester backbone with<br>
pendant fatty acid ester groups on the alkyd polyester<br>
block. Long chain saturated fatty acids result in<br>
polymers that are solids and that exhibit relatively low<br>
melting points, e.g. between about 25°C and 70°C.<br>
Alternatively, use of unsaturated fatty acids or short<br>
chain fatty acids results in liquid polymers. As used<br>
herein, a liquid polymer is a polymer with a melt<br>
temperature of less than about 25°C, preferably less<br>
than about 20°C.<br>
The solid polymers and liquid polymers can be<br>
blended to form injectable microdispersions. The<br><br>
microdispersions can be formed by physically blending<br>
liquid polymers of the present invention with finely<br>
ground solid polymers of the present invention, or by<br>
grinding a suspension of large pieces of the solid<br>
polymers using the liquid polymer as a lubricant, until<br>
the desired particle size distribution is obtained.<br>
Generally, the solid polymers will have an average<br>
particle diameter of less than about 500 microns and<br>
preferably less than 50 microns. It is currently<br>
preferred to mix the finely ground solid polymer and<br>
liquid polymer and raise the temperature of the mixture<br>
to a temperature sufficient to melt the solid polymer<br>
(melt blending). Melt blending is preferred because it<br>
simplifies the mixing operation involved in producing<br>
the microdispersion. It is desirable to avoid excessive<br>
heating during melt blending to avoid<br>
transesterification of the polymers.<br>
Monoglycerides that may be used to prepare the<br>
polymers utilized in the present invention include,<br>
without limitation, monostearoyl glycerol, monopalmitoyl<br>
glycerol, tnonomyrisitoyl glycerol, monocaproyl glycerol,<br>
monodecanoyl glycerol, monolauroyl glycerol,<br>
monolinoleoyl glycerol, monooleoyl glycerol, and<br>
combinations thereof. Preferred monoglycerides include<br>
monostearoyl glycerol, monopalmitoyl glycerol and<br>
monomyrisitoyl glycerol.<br>
Polybasic acids that can be used include natural<br>
multifunctional carboxylic acids, such as succinic,<br><br>
glutaric, adipic, pimelic, suberic, and sebacic acids;<br>
hydroxy acids, such as diglycolic, malic, tartaric and<br>
citric acids; and unsaturated acids, such as fumaric and<br>
maleic acids. Polybasic acid derivatives include<br>
anhydrides, such as succinic anhydride, diglycolic<br>
anhydride, glutaric anhydride and maleic anhydride,<br>
mixed anhydrides, esters, activated esters and acid<br>
halides. The multifunctional carboxylic acids listed<br>
above are preferred.<br>
Suitable lactone-derived repeating units may be<br>
generated from the following monomers, including but not<br>
limited to lactone monomers selected from the group<br>
consisting of glycolide, d-lactide, 1-lactide, meso-<br>
lactide, epsilon-caprolactone, para-dioxanone,<br>
trimethylene carbonate, 1,4 dioxepan-2-one and 1,5<br>
dioxepan-2-one.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the alkyd<br>
polyester prepolymer may be prepared from the polybasic<br>
acid or derivative thereof, the monoglyceride and,<br>
additionally, at least one additional polyol selected<br>
from the group consisting of ethylene glycol, 1,2-<br>
propylene glycol, 1,3-propanediol, bis-2-hydroxyethyl<br>
ether, 1,4-butanediol, 1,5-pentanediol, 1,6- hexanediol,<br>
1,8-octanediol, 1,10-decanediol, 1, 12-dodecanediol,<br>
other diols, linear poly(ethylene glycol), branched<br>
poly(ethylene glycol), linear poly(propylene glycol),<br>
branched poly(propylene glycol), linear poly(ethylene -<br>
co-propylene glycol)s and branched poly(ethylene-co-<br><br>
propylene glycol)s.<br>
In preparing the polymers utilized in the present<br>
invention, the particular chemical and mechanical<br>
properties required of the polymer for a particular use<br>
must be considered. For example, changing the chemical<br>
composition can vary the physical and mechanical<br>
properties, including absorption times. Copolymers can<br>
be prepared by using mixtures of diacids, different<br>
monoalkanoyl glycerides and different lactones to<br>
provide a desired set of properties. Similarly, blends<br>
of two or more alkyd-lactone copolymers may be prepared<br>
to tailor properties for different applications.<br>
Copolymers containing other linkages in addition to<br>
an ester linkage also may be synthesized. For example,<br>
ester-amides, ester-carbonates, ester-anhydrides and<br>
ester urethanes may be used, to name a few.<br>
Multifunctional monomers may be used to produce<br>
crosslinked polymeric networks. Alternatively, double<br>
bonds may be introduced by using monoglycerides or<br>
diacids containing at least one double bond to allow<br>
photocrosslinking. Hydrogels may be prepared using this<br>
approach provided the polymer is sufficiently water<br>
soluble or swellable.<br>
Functional!zed polymers can be prepared by<br>
appropriate choice of monomers. Polymers having pendant<br>
hydroxyls can be synthesized using a hydroxy acid such<br>
as malic or tartaric acid in the synthesis. Polymers<br>
with pendent amines, carboxyls or other functional<br><br>
groups also may be synthesized.<br>
A variety of biologically active substances,<br>
hereinafter referred to as bioactive agents, can be<br>
covalently attached to these functional polymers by<br>
known coupling chemistry to provide sustained release of<br>
the bioactive agent. As used herein, bioactive agent is<br>
meant to include those substances or materials that have<br>
a therapeutic effect on mammals, e.g. pharmaceutical<br>
compounds. By effective amount of a bioactive agent, it<br>
is meant that the composition comprises the bioactive<br>
agent in minimum amounts that are effective in providing<br>
the therapeutic effect that the bioactive agent is<br>
intended to provide.<br>
In another embodiment, the polymers of the present<br>
invention may be endcapped in a variety of ways to<br>
obtain the desired properties. Endcapping reactions<br>
convert the terminal and pendant hydroxyl groups and<br>
terminal carboxyl groups into other types of chemical<br>
moieties. Typical endcapping reactions include, but are<br>
not limited, to alkylation and acylation reactions using<br>
common reagents such as alkyl, alkenyl, or alkynyl<br>
halides and sulfonates, acid chlorides, anhydrides,<br>
mixed anhydrides, alkyl and aryl isocyanates, and alkyl<br>
and aryl isothiocyanates. Endcapping reactions can<br>
impart new functionality to the polymers of this<br>
invention. For instance, when acryloyl or methacryloyl<br>
chloride is used to endcap these polymers, acrylate or<br>
methacrylate ester groups, respectively, are created<br><br>
that subsequently can be polymerized to form a<br>
crosslinked network. One skilled in the art, once having<br>
the benefit of the disclosure herein, will be able to<br>
ascertain particular properties of the liquid polymers<br>
required for particular purposes and readily prepare<br>
liquid polymers that provide such properties.<br>
The polymerization of the polyether alkyds<br>
preferably is performed under melt polycondensation<br>
conditions in the presence of an organometallic catalyst<br>
at elevated temperatures. The organometallic catalyst<br>
preferably is a tin-based catalyst, e.g. stannous<br>
octoate. The catalyst preferably will be present in the<br>
mixture at a mole ratio of polyol and polycarboxylic<br>
acid to catalyst in the range of from about 15,000/1 to<br>
80,000/1. The reaction preferably is performed at a<br>
temperature no less than about 12 0°C. Higher<br>
polymerization temperatures may lead to further<br>
increases in the molecular weight of the copolymer,<br>
which may be desirable for numerous applications. The<br>
exact reaction conditions chosen will depend on numerous<br>
factors, including the properties of the polymer<br>
desired, the viscosity of the reaction mixture, and<br>
melting temperature of the polymer. The preferred<br>
reaction conditions of temperature, time and pressure<br>
can be readily determined by assessing these and other<br>
factors.<br>
Generally, the reaction mixture will be maintained<br>
at about 180°C. The polymerization reaction can be<br><br>
allowed to proceed at this temperature until the desired<br>
molecular weight and percent conversion is achieved for<br>
the copolymer, which typically will take from about 15<br>
minutes to 24 hours. Increasing the reaction<br>
temperature generally decreases the reaction time needed<br>
to achieve a particular molecular weight.<br>
The alkyd polyester prepolymer prepared using<br>
conditions described above may then be reacted with at<br>
least one lactone monomer or lactone prepolymer. The<br>
mixture then would be subjected to the desired<br>
conditions of temperature and time to copolymerize the<br>
alkyd polyester prepolymer with the lactone monomer.<br>
Generally, this reaction mixture will be maintained at<br>
about 190°C. The polymerization reaction can be allowed<br>
to proceed at this temperature until the desired<br>
molecular weight and percent conversion is achieved for<br>
the copolymer, which typically will take from about 15<br>
minutes to 24 hours.<br>
The molecular weight of the prepolymer, as well as<br>
its composition, can be varied depending on the desired<br>
characteristic that the prepolymer is to impart to the<br>
copolymer. Those skilled in the art will recognize that<br>
the alkyd-lactone copolymers described herein can also<br>
be made from mixtures of more than one monoglyceride,<br>
dicarboxylic acid, and lactone monomer.<br>
The polymers, copolymers and blends of the present<br>
invention can be crosslinked to affect mechanical<br>
properties. Crosslinking can be accomplished by the<br><br>
addition of crosslinking enhancers, irradiation, e.g.<br>
gamma-irradiation, or a combination of both. In<br>
particular, crosslinking can be used to control the<br>
amount of swelling that the materials of this invention<br>
experience in water.<br>
One of the beneficial properties of the alkyd-<br>
lactone copolymers of this invention is that the ester<br>
linkages are hydrolytically unstable and, therefore, the<br>
polymer is biodegradable because it readily breaks down<br>
into small segments when exposed to moist body tissue.<br>
In this regard, while it is envisioned that co-reactants<br>
could be incorporated into the reaction mixture of the<br>
polybasic acid and the diol and subsequent reaction with<br>
lactone monomer for the formation of the alkyd-lactone<br>
copolymers, it is preferable that the reaction mixture<br>
does not contain a concentration of any co-reactant that<br>
would render the subsequently prepared polymer<br>
nonbiodegradable. Preferably, the reaction mixture is<br>
substantially free of any such co-reactants if the<br>
resulting polymer is rendered nonbiodegradable.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the alkyd-<br>
lactone copolymers of the present invention can be used<br>
as a pharmaceutical carrier in a drug delivery matrix.<br>
Solid alkyd-lactone copolymers could be used to coat or<br>
encapsulate a bioactive agent. Alternatively, an<br>
effective amount of a bioactive agent could be mixed<br>
with injectable microdispersions of solid polymer and<br>
liquid polymer. Such a microdispersion would be<br><br>
particularly suitable for unstable drugs such as<br>
proteins.<br>
The variety of bioactive agents that can be used in<br>
conjunction with the polymers of the invention is vast.<br>
The bioactive agents are present in compositions and/or<br>
medical devices of the present invention in effective<br>
amounts. By effective amount, it is meant that the<br>
agents are present in amounts effective to provide the<br>
desired or necessary therapeutic effect of the agent,<br>
depending on the particular composition or device and<br>
the particular application of same. One skilled in the<br>
art, once having the benefit of this disclosure, will be<br>
able to ascertain the effective amount for the<br>
particular application.<br>
In general, bioactive agents which may be<br>
administered via pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention include, without limitation, antiinfectives,<br>
such as antibiotics and antiviral agents; analgesics and<br>
analgesic combinations; anorexics; anthelmintics;<br>
antiarthritics; antiasthmatic agents; anticonvulsants;<br>
antidepressants; antidiuretic agents; antidiarrheals;<br>
antihistamines; antiinflammatory agents; antimigraine<br>
preparations; antinauseants; antineoplastics;<br>
antiparkinsonians drugs; antipruritics; antipsychotics;<br>
antipyretics; antispasmodics; anticholinergics;<br>
sympathomimetics; xanthine derivatives; cardiovascular<br>
preparations including calcium channel blockers and<br>
beta-blockers such as pindolol and antiarrhythmics;<br><br>
antihypertensives; diuretics; vasodilators, including<br>
general coronary, peripheral and cerebral; central<br>
nervous system stimulants; cough and cold preparations,<br>
including decongestants; hormones, such as estradiol and<br>
other steroids, including corticosteroids; hypnotics;<br>
immunosuppressives; muscle relaxants;<br>
parasympatholytics; psychostimulants; sedatives;<br>
tranquilizers; naturally derived or genetically<br>
engineered proteins, growth factors, polysaccharides,<br>
glycoproteins or lipoproteins; oligonucleotides;<br>
antibodies; antigens; cholinergics; chemotherapeutics;<br>
hemostatics; clot dissolving agents; radioactive agents;<br>
and cystostatics.<br>
Rapamycin, risperidone, and erythropoietin are<br>
preferred bioactive agents that may be used in drug<br>
delivery matrices of the present invention.<br>
The drug delivery matrix may be administered in any<br>
suitable dosage form such as oral, parenteral,<br>
pulmonary, buccal, nasal, ocular, topical, vaginal<br>
routes, or as a suppository. Bioerodible particles,<br>
ointments, gels, creams, and similar soft dosage forms<br>
adapted for the administration via the above routes may<br>
also be formulated. Other modes of administration, e.g.<br>
transdermal, and compositional forms, e.g. more rigid<br>
transdermal forms, are within the scope of the invention<br>
as well.<br>
Parenteral administration of a bioerodible<br>
composition of the invention can be effected by either<br><br>
subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. The bioactive<br>
agent could be encapsulated in particles made of the<br>
solid polymer. Alternatively, parenteral formulations of<br>
the copolymer may be formulated by mixing one or more<br>
pharmaceuticals with a liquid copolymer or<br>
microdispersion. Other suitable parenteral additives may<br>
be formulated with the copolymer and pharmaceutical<br>
active. However, if water is to be used it should be<br>
added immediately before administration. Bioerodible<br>
ointment, gel or cream may also be injected as is or in<br>
combination with one or more suitable auxiliary<br>
components as described below. Parenteral delivery is<br>
preferred for administration of proteinaceous drugs such<br>
as growth factors, growth hormone, or the like.<br>
The bioerodible ointments, gels and creams of the<br>
invention will include an ointment, gel or cream base<br>
comprising one or more of the copolymers described<br>
herein and a selected bioactive agent. The bioactive<br>
agent, whether present as a liquid, a finely divided<br>
solid, or any other physical form, is dispersed in the<br>
ointment, gel or cream base. Typically, but optionally,<br>
the compositions include one or more other components,<br>
e.g., nontoxic auxiliary substances such as colorants,<br>
diluents, odorants, carriers, excipients, stabilizers or<br>
the like.<br>
The quantity and type of copolymers incorporated<br>
into the parenteral, ointment, gel, cream, etc., is<br>
variable. For a more viscous composition, a higher<br><br>
molecular weight polymer is used. If a less viscous<br>
composition is desired, a lower molecular weight polymer<br>
can be employed. The product may contain blends of the<br>
liquid or low melting point copolymers to provide the<br>
desired release profile or consistency to a given<br>
formulation.<br>
While not essential for topical or transdermal<br>
administration of many drugs, in some cases, it may be<br>
preferred that a skin permeation enhancer be<br>
coadministered with the drug. Any number of the many<br>
skin permeation enhancers known in the art may be used.<br>
Examples of suitable enhancers include dimethylsulfoxide<br>
(DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), N, N-dimethylacetamide<br>
(DMA), deslymethylsulfoxide, ethanol, eucalyptol,<br>
lecithin, and the 1-N-dodecylcyclazacycloheptan-2-ones.<br>
Depending on dosage form, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention may be<br>
administered in different ways, i.e. parenterally,<br>
topically, or the like. Preferred dosage forms are<br>
liquid dosage forms that can be administered<br>
parenterally.<br>
The amount of bioactive agent will be dependent<br>
upon the particular drug employed and medical condition<br>
being treated. Typically, the amount of drug represents<br>
about 0.001% to about 70%, more typically about 0.001%<br>
to about 50%, most typically about 0.001% to about 20%<br>
by weight of the matrix.<br>
The quantity and type of alkyd-lactone copolymer<br><br>
incorporated into the parenteral will vary depending on<br>
the release profile desired and the amount of drug<br>
employed. The product may contain blends of polymers to<br>
provide the desired release profile or consistency to a<br>
given formulation.<br>
The alkyd-lactone copolymer, upon contact with body<br>
fluids, including blood or the like, undergoes gradual<br>
degradation, mainly through hydrolysis, with concomitant<br>
release of the dispersed drug for a sustained or<br>
extended period, as compared to the release from an<br>
isotonic saline solution. This can result in prolonged<br>
delivery of effective amounts of drug, e.g. over about 1<br>
to about 2,000 hours, preferably about 2 to about 800<br>
hours, or, e.g. 0.0001 mg/kg/hour to 10 mg/kg/hour.<br>
This dosage form can be administered as is necessary,<br>
depending on the subject being treated, the severity of<br>
the affliction, the judgment of the prescribing<br>
physician, and the like.<br>
Individual formulations of drugs and alkyd-lactone<br>
copolymer may be tested in appropriate in vitro and in<br>
vivo models to achieve the desired drug release<br>
profiles. For example, a drug could be formulated with<br>
an alkyd-lactone copolymer and orally administered to an<br>
animal. The drug release profile could then be monitored<br>
by appropriate means, such as by taking blood samples at<br>
specific times and assaying the samples for drug<br>
concentration. Following this or similar procedures,<br>
those skilled in the art will be able to formulate a<br><br>
variety of formulations.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the polymers and blends thereof can be used in tissue<br>
engineering applications, e.g. as supports for cells or<br>
delivery vehicle for cells. Appropriate tissue<br>
scaffolding structures are known in the art, such as the<br>
prosthetic articular cartilage described in U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,3 06,311, the porous biodegradable scaffolding<br>
described in WO 94/25079, and the prevascularized<br>
implants described in WO 93/08850 (all hereby<br>
incorporated by reference herein). Methods of seeding<br>
and/or culturing cells in tissue scaffoldings are also<br>
known in the art such as those methods disclosed in EPO<br>
422 209 Bl, WO 88/03785, WO 90/12604 and WO 95/33821,<br>
all of which are all hereby incorporated by reference<br>
herein as if set forth in their entirety.<br>
The polymers of this invention can be melt-<br>
processed by numerous methods to prepare a vast array of<br>
useful devices. These polymers can be injection or<br>
compression molded to make implantable medical and<br>
surgical devices, especially wound closure devices. The<br>
preferred wound closure devices are surgical clips,<br>
staples and sutures.<br>
Alternatively, the alkyd-lactone copolymers can be<br>
extruded to prepare filaments. The filaments thus<br>
produced may be fabricated into sutures or ligatures,<br>
attached to surgical needles, packaged, and sterilized<br>
by known techniques. The polymers of the present<br><br>
invention may be spun as monofilament or multifilament<br>
yarn and woven or knitted to form sponges or gauze, or<br>
used in conjunction with other molded compressive<br>
structures as prosthetic devices within the body of a<br>
human or animal where it is desirable that the structure<br>
have high tensile strength and desirable levels of<br>
compliance and/or ductility. Non-woven sheets also may<br>
be prepared and used as described above. Useful<br>
embodiments include tubes, including branched tubes, for<br>
artery, vein or intestinal repair, nerve splicing,<br>
tendon splicing, sheets for taping-up and supporting<br>
damaged surface abrasions, particularly major abrasions,<br>
or areas where the skin and underlying tissues are<br>
damaged or surgically removed.<br>
Additionally, the polymers can be molded to form<br>
films which, when sterilized, are useful as adhesion<br>
prevention barriers. Another alternative processing<br>
technique for the polymers of this invention includes<br>
solvent casting, particularly for those applications<br>
where a drug delivery matrix is desired. In more detail,<br>
the surgical and medical uses of the filaments, films,<br>
and molded articles of the present invention include,<br>
but are not limited to, knitted products, woven or non-<br>
woven, and molded products including, but not limited to<br>
burn dressings, hernia patches, meshes, medicated<br>
dressings, fascial substitutes, gauze, fabric, sheet,<br>
felt or sponge for liver hemostasis, gauze bandages,<br>
arterial graft or substitutes, bandages for skin<br><br>
surfaces, suture knot clip, orthopedic pins, clamps,<br>
screws, plates, clips, e.g. for vena cava, staples,<br>
hooks, buttons, snaps, bone substitutes, e.g. as<br>
mandible prosthesis, intrauterine devices, e.g. as<br>
spermicidal devices, draining or testing tubes or<br>
capillaries, surgical instruments, vascular implants or<br>
supports, e.g. stents or grafts, or combinations<br>
thereof, vertebral discs, extracorporeal tubing for<br>
kidney and heart-lung machines, artificial skin, and<br>
supports for cells in tissue engineering applications.<br>
In another embodiment, the alkyd-lactone copolymer<br>
is used to coat a surface of a medical device to enhance<br>
the lubricity of the coated surface. The polymer may be<br>
applied as a coating using conventional techniques. For<br>
example, the polymer may be solubilized in a dilute<br>
solution of a volatile organic solvent, such as acetone,<br>
methanol, ethyl acetate or toluene, and then the article<br>
can be immersed in the solution to coat its surface.<br>
Once the surface is coated, the surgical article can be<br>
removed from the solution where it can be dried at an<br>
elevated temperature until the solvent and any residual<br>
reactants are removed.<br>
It is contemplated that numerous surgical articles,<br>
including but not limited to endoscopic instruments,<br>
suture anchors, sutures, staples, surgical tacks, clips,<br>
plates, screws, drug-delivery devices, can be coated<br>
with the polymers of this invention to improve the<br>
surface properties of the article. The preferred<br><br>
surgical articles are surgical sutures and needles. The<br>
most preferred surgical article is a suture, most<br>
preferably attached to a needle. Preferably, the suture<br>
is a synthetic absorbable suture. These sutures are<br>
derived, for example, from homopolymers and copolymers<br>
of lactone monomers such as glycolide, lactide,<br>
including L-lactide D-lactide, meso-lactide and rac-<br>
lactide, e-caprolactone, p-dioxanone, 1,4-dioxanone,<br>
1,4-dioxepan-2-one, 1,5-dioxepan-2-one and trimethylene<br>
carbonate. The preferred suture is a braided<br>
multifilament suture composed of polyglycolide or<br>
poly(glycolide-co-lactide).<br>
The amount of coating polymer to be applied on the<br>
surface of a braided suture can be readily determined<br>
empirically and will depend on the particular copolymer<br>
and suture chosen. Ideally, the amount of coating<br>
copolymer applied to the surface of the suture may range<br>
from about 0.5 to about 30 percent of the weight of the<br>
coated suture, more preferably from about 1.0 to about<br>
2 0 weight percent, most preferably from 1 to about 5<br>
weight percent. If the amount of coating on the suture<br>
were greater than about 30 weight percent, then it may<br>
increase the risk that the coating may flake off when<br>
the suture is passed through tissue.<br>
Sutures coated with the polymers of this invention<br>
are desirable because they have a more slippery feel,<br>
thus making it easier for the surgeon to slide a knot<br>
down the suture to the site of surgical trauma. In<br><br>
addition, the suture is more pliable and, therefore, is<br>
easier for the surgeon to manipulate during use. These<br>
advantages are exhibited in comparison to sutures which<br>
do not have their surfaces coated with the polymer of<br>
this invention.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
when the article is a surgical needle, the amount of<br>
coating applied to the surface of the article is an<br>
amount which creates a layer with a thickness ranging<br>
preferably between about 2 to about 2 0 microns on the<br>
needle, more preferably about 4 to about 8 microns. If<br>
the amount of coating on the needle were such that the<br>
thickness of the coating layer was greater than about 20<br>
microns, or if the thickness was less than about 2<br>
microns, then the desired performance of the needle as<br>
it is passed through tissue may not be achieved.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
solid polymers derived from alkyd-lactone copolymers can<br>
be used to overcoat microparticles encapsulating a<br>
bioactive agent(s). This would help provide an<br>
additional barrier for sustained release of the drug.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the polymer comprises a<br>
bone replacement material comprising the solid polymer<br>
or a liquid polymer or a microdispersion and inorganic<br>
filler. The inorganic filler may be selected from<br>
alpha-tricalcium phosphate, beta-tricalcium phosphate,<br>
calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, calcium sulfate,<br>
barium sulfate, hydroxyapatite, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
In certain embodiments the inorganic filler comprises a<br>
polymorph of calcium phosphate. Preferably, the<br>
inorganic filler is hydroxyapatite. The bone<br>
replacement materials may further comprise a bioactive<br>
agent in a therapeutically effective amount, such a<br>
growth factor, to facilitate growth of bone tissue.<br>
Furthermore, the bone replacement material may comprise<br>
a biologically derived substance selected from the group<br>
consisting of demineralized bone, platelet rich plasma,<br>
bone marrow aspirate and bone fragments. The relative<br>
amounts of polymer and inorganic filler may be<br>
determined readily by one skilled in the art by routine<br>
experimentation after having the benefit of this<br>
disclosure.<br>
The injectable microdispersions can be used for a<br>
variety of soft tissue repair and augmentation<br>
procedures. For example, the microdispersions can be<br>
used in facial tissue repair or augmentation, including<br>
but not limited to camouflaging scars, filling<br>
depressions, smoothing out irregularity, correcting<br>
asymmetry in facial hemiatrophy, second branchial arch<br>
syndrome, facial lipodystrophy and camouflaging age-<br>
related wrinkles as well as augmenting facial eminences,<br>
e.g. lips, brow, etc. Additionally, these injectable<br>
microdispersions can be used to restore or improve<br>
sphincter function, such as for treating stress urinary<br>
incontinence. Other uses of these injectable<br>
microdispersions may also include the treatment of<br><br>
vesicoureteral reflux (incomplete function of the inlet<br>
of the ureter in children) by subureteric injection and<br>
the application of these microdispersions as general-<br>
purpose fillers in the human body.<br>
Surgical applications for an injectable,<br>
biodegradable microdispersion include, but are not<br>
limited to, facial contouring, e.g. frown or glabellar<br>
line, acne scars, cheek depressions, vertical or<br>
perioral lip lines, marionette lines or oral<br>
commissures, worry or forehead lines, crow's feet or<br>
periorbital lines, deep smile lines or nasolabial folds,<br>
smile lines, facial scars, lips and the like;<br>
periurethral injection, including injection-into the<br>
submucosa of the urethra along the urethra, at or around<br>
the urethral-bladder junction to the external sphincter;<br>
urethral injection for the prevention of urinary reflux;<br>
injection into the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract<br>
for the bulking of tissue to prevent reflux; to aid in<br>
sphincter muscle coaptation, internal or external, and<br>
for coaptation of an enlarged lumen; intraocular<br>
injection for the replacement of vitreous fluid or<br>
maintenance of intraocular pressure for retinal<br>
detachment; injection into anatomical ducts to<br>
temporarily plug the outlet to prevent reflux or<br>
infection propagation; larynx rehabilitation after<br>
surgery or atrophy; and any other soft tissue which can<br>
be augmented for cosmetic or therapeutic effect.<br>
Surgical specialists who would use such a product<br><br>
include, but are not limited to, plastic and<br>
reconstructive surgeons; dermatologists; facial plastic<br>
surgeons, cosmetic surgeons, otolaryngologists;<br>
urologists; gynecologists; gastroenterologists;<br>
ophthalmologists; and any other physician qualified to<br>
utilize such a product.<br>
Additionally, to facilitate the administration and<br>
treatment of patients with the inventive<br>
microdispersion, pharmaceutically active compounds or<br>
adjuvants can be administered therewith.<br>
Pharmaceutically active agents that may be<br>
coadministered with the inventive microdispersion<br>
include but are not limited to anesthetics, e.g.<br>
lidocaine; and anti-inflammatory, e.g. cortisone.<br>
The microdispersion can be administered with a<br>
syringe and needle or a variety of devices. It is also<br>
envisioned that the microdispersion could be sold in the<br>
form of a kit comprising a device containing the<br>
microdispersion. The device having an outlet for said<br>
microdispersion. an ejector for expelling the<br>
microdispersion and a hollow tubular member fitted to<br>
the outlet for administering the microdispersion into an<br>
animal.<br>

invention are sustained-release parenterals, bioerodible<br>
ointments, gels, creams, and similar soft dosage forms.<br>
The examples set forth below are for illustration<br>
purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of<br><br>

embodiments within the scope and spirit of the invention<br>
will become readily apparent to those skilled in the<br>
art.<br>
In the examples below, the synthesized polymers<br>
were characterized via differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and nuclear<br>
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. DSC measurements<br>
were performed on a 2920 Modulated Differential Scanning<br>
Calorimeter from TA Instruments using aluminum sample<br>
pans and sample weights of 5-10 mg. Samples were heated<br>
from room temperature to 100°C at 10°C/minute; quenched<br>
to -40°C at 30°C/minute followed by heating to 100°C at<br>
10°C/minute. For GPC, a Waters System with Millennium<br>
32 Software and a 410 Refractive Index Detector were<br>
used. Molecular weights were determined relative to<br>
polystyrene standards using THF as the solvent. Proton<br>
NMR was obtained in deuterated chloroform on a 4 00MHz<br>
NMR spectrometer using Varian software.<br>
Example 1: Synthesis of Poly(monostearoyl glycerol-co-<br>
succinate)<br>
197.2 gtns of monostearoyl glycerol were added to a<br>
dry 500 ml, single neck, round bottom flask. A stir bar<br>
was added and a nitrogen inlet adapter was attached. The<br>
reaction flask was placed in a room temperature oil bath<br>
and a nitrogen gas blanket was started. The flask was<br>
heated to 140°C, and 50.0 gms of succinic anhydride were<br><br><br>
added. The temperature was raised to 2 00°C and<br>
maintained for 4 hours. After 4 hours the flask was<br>
removed from the oil bath to cool to room temperature.<br>
Once the solution crystallized, it was deglassed and<br>
cleaned to remove any glass fragments. The polymer was<br>
an amber colored solid.<br>
DSC measurements found a melt temperature of<br>
46.8°C, and a specific heat of 63.6 J/gm. GPC<br>

added and a nitrogen inlet adapter was attached. The<br>
reaction flask was placed into a room temperature oil<br>
bath and a nitrogen blanket was applied. The oil bath<br>
temperature was raised to 140°C. Once at 140°C, 8.42<br>
gms of succinic anhydride were added. The temperature<br>
was raised to 200°C and maintained for 3 hours at 200°C.<br>
The flask was removed from the oil bath and allowed to<br>
cool to room temperature. The polymer was a pale<br>
yellow, viscous liquid.<br>
The polymer was purified by dissolving in Ethyl<br>
acetate (5 gms polymer in 2 0 mis EcOAc) and added to a<br>
separatory funnel. The solution was washed three times<br>
with 20 mis of a very dilute sodium bicarbonate<br>
solution. The funnel was agitated very slightly (in<br>
order to avoid forming an emulsion). The solution was<br>
then washed three times with a saturated sodium chloride<br>
solution. The polymer solution was decanted and dried<br>
over magnesium sulfate. The solution was gravity<br>
filtered and evaporated to give a viscous yellow liquid.<br>
The polymer was dried in the vacuum oven, where the oven<br>
was set around 40°C, for 48-72 hours.<br>
