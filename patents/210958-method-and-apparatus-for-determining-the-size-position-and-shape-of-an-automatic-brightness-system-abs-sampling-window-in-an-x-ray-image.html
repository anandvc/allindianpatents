"METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE SIZE, POSITION AND SHAPE OF AN AUTOMATIC BRIGHTNESS SYSTEM (ABS) SAMPLING WINDOW IN AN X-RAY IMAGE"<br>
OEC MEDICAL SYSTEMS, INC., a Corporation incorporated under the Laws of Utah and having its principal place of business at 384 Wright Brothers Drive, Salt Lake City, Utah 84116, United States of America,<br>
The following Complete Specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and tiie manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR AUTOMATIC SIZING AND POSITIONING OF ABS SAMPLING WINDOW IN AN X-RAY<br>
IMAGING SYSTEM<br>
BACKGR&gt;UND<br>
1.	The Field Of The Invention.<br>
This invention relates generally to x-ray imaging apparatus. More specifically, the invention relates tc -outmatic brightness control in a closed loop imaging system which uses an automatic brightness control sampling window.<br>
2.	The State Of The Art<br>
X-ray imaging systems are well known medical diagnostic and interventional tools. X-rays are generated when a high voltage generator supplies electric power to an x-ray tube. One circuit prepares the tube for x-ray exposure by heating the tube filament. A second circuit generates a high voltage potential that accelerates x-rays from the filament (or cathode) to the anode within the x-ray tube.<br>
The filament in the x-ray tube is a coiled tungsten wire that, when heated by current flow emits electror-s. This is a low voltage circuit. Relatively little power is needed to heat the filament, and small variations in filament current result in large variations in x-ray tube current.<br>
Electrons emitted from the filament are focused onto a spot in the tungsten target (anode). X-ray photons are produced when the electrons interact, by sudden deceleration, within the tungsten anode. The target surface is angled to reflect the x-rays in the direction of the x-ray tube output window.<br>
In order to understand the relationship between the high voltage generator control and its effects on x-ray beam penetration, and subsequently, diagnostic image quality, it is important to remember that the intensity of an x-ray beam varies with the electrical potential in kilovolts (kVp) and the Lube current (mA) applied to the tube. The quality and intensity of the x-ray photons generated depends almost entirely on the kVp.<br>
Because exposure to radiation is harmful, all practical methods are employed to reduce x-ray exposure to patients. One method is to cllimatethe x-<br><br>
ray beam with materials that will partially or completely absorb x-rays. Proper bcr .it collimation also assists the video imaging system by prohibiting non-attenuated (unimpeded) x-ray photons from reaching an image intensifier-<br>
Varying clinical procedures have unique beam collimatk 1 requirements. The most common systems employ a combination of fixed, adjustable leaf and adjustable iris collimation. Systems can also use a combination iris and leaf collimator with independent motorized controls and position feedback.<br>
During the examination of a patient, an image is produced when x-ray photons pass through the patient and are then converted to light photons through the use of an image intensifier tube or some other x-ray conversion device. The x-ray photons pass through tissue and materials of varying mass and composition before striking the input surface of the image intensifier. X-rays will either penetrate or be absorbed by whatever lies in the path of the X-ray beam. As x-rays strike the input screen in the image intensifier, x-ray photons are converted into light photons. "Within the photocathodc the light photons are converted to electrons and focused by an electrostatic lens onto an output phosphor. The output phosphor once again converts the electrons to light photons where the image is visible at the output window of the image intensifier tube.<br>
At this stage, calculating the actual sizes or dimensions of objects in the irnage requires knowing: 1) the image intensifier size, 2) the irnage intensifier electrostatic lens magnification, and 3) the magnification of the object due to its distance from the surface of the image intensifying tube.<br>
A video camera captures the image as it is displayed at the output of the image intensifier. The automatic brightness system (ABS) control application dynamically determines the camera gain, kVp and mA, based on the image brightness statistics. Peak brightness and average brightness of the area within the ABS sampling window are used as the conventional factors in setting the ABS control parameters (kVp, mA and camera gain). It should also be mentioned that the image intensifier might also be some other type of image receptor such as a flat panel x-ray image receptor or some other scanned image x-ray receptor.<br>
As a patient is re-positioned beneath the x-ray beam during an examination, the brightness of the video image changes because of variations in<br><br><br>
the attenuation of the x-ray beam as it passes through different thicknesses and densities of body tissue and bone. In order to compensate for these variations In image brightness, various automatic brightness compensation systems have been<br>
devised.<br>
For example, in U.S. Patent No. 4,573,183, the automatic brightness control derives the average brightness of the image from the video signal. That average brightness information is used to produce a video gain signal for controlling the camera and to generate a brightness feedback signal that controls an x-ray tube power supply. In response to the brightness feedback signal, the x-ray tube power supply generates a bias voltage and filament current for the x-ray tube to thereby regulate brightness of the x-ray image formed by the image intensifier tube. By varying the gain or the aperture of the video camera, the resulting image brightness on the monitor also is controlled. Accordingly, the feedback provided to the automatic brightness control modifies the x-ray emission and camera gain which affects the image brightness. The feedback control can be calibrated to generate consistent image display brightness regardless of changes in natient x-ray absorption. The standard automatic brightness control derives the video gain and brightness feedback signals from a common average brightness value, a peak brightness, or a combination of the values for the image. However, a common brightness feedback signal results in less than ideal control of these system parameters which affect the image generated on the monitor.<br>
Another example of the state of the art is taught in U.S. Patent No. 4,703,496. This patent apparently teaches that luminances of picture elements in each video image field were averaged to generate a signal having a voltage proportional to the average image brightness.<br>
The average brightness value is used as a feedback signal to control the excitation of the x-ray tube and the video gain to thereby maintain the video image brightness substantially constant at an optimum level. However, the system is relatively complex in that it utilizes three separate loops for regulating tube current, bias voltage and video gain.<br>
The systems described are complex and are difficult to maintain. Accordingly, it would be an advantage over the state of the art to provide an<br><br><br>
automatic brightness control system which is simpler to operate, and is able to compensate for the effects of improper patient positioning, variations in fatient size, and rapid changes from torso to extremity imaging.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF TEE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made to the drawings in which the various elements of the present invention will be given numerical designations and in which the invention will be discussed so as to enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention. It is to be understood that the following description is onry exemplary of the principles of the present invention, and should not be viewed as narrowing the claims which follow.<br>
It is useful to have an overview of the present invention before the detailed description of the preferred embodiment is presented. Accordingly, it is observed that the present invention advantageously provides an automatic brightness system (ABS) that utilizes an ABS sampling window. The two properties which define an ABS sampling window within an image are: 1) the window position, and 2) the window geometry.<br>
The position of the ABS sampling window is determined by comparing the average gray scale values of the image region of interest segments. The size of the ABS sampling window is adjusted based on the kVp and the image intensifier size and magnification values. Further, the shape of the ABS sampling window is also adjusted based on the collimation in the ABS sampling window.<br><br><br>
The presently preferred embodiment of the invention provides for an ABS in a closed loop imaging system. The method provides a dynamic ABS function which operates on an ABS sampling window to thereby improve the imaging system"s ability to provide optimum imaging. By automating the system, images are created which have better diagnostic information.<br>
Figure 1 is a front clevational view of a video image 10- A Region of Interest Size (ROISize) is established within a circular blanking area 12. In this figure, the ROI 14 is shown as a square region, but it could also be a circle or some other arbitrary geometric selection as will be explained later. The areas 16 outside of the circular blanking area 12 comprise information that is not relevant to the calculations to be performed. All useful information is shown within the circular blanking area 12. The ROISize defines a number of pixels which will be examined.<br>
Certain characteristics about the image must be recognized to understand the method used in this invention for positioning and sizing the ABS window. First, the darker zones in the image represent the thickest or most dense anatomy in the image. A zone is defined here as an image area large enough to represent a significant anatomical attribute or feature.<br>
It should be understood that the location of the darkest pixel in the image is not likely to be the optimum center popition for the ABS sampling window   " because the darkest pixel may be a metal prosthesis or similar material. Furthermore, the gray scale composition of all unobstructed (non-collimated) image areas provide useful information for deteimining the ABS sample window position.<br>
Figure 2 represents a clinical x-ray image where the area of greatest     " anatomical density in a leg 38 being x-rayed.(e.g. the hip joint 34) is not centered in the image 30. The ABS sampling window 32 also shown using the conventional method of centering the ABS sampling window 32 within the target image 30. The ABS sampling window in Figure 2 also contains an area 40 with non-attenuated x-ray photons. Including non-attenuated x-ray photons in average or peak gray scale value calculations produces misleading output. As a result, the<br><br><br>
gain or kVp will not be raised io a high enough level because the ABS system will believe that the image is already bright enough.<br>
Figure 3 shows where the ABS sampling window 36 will be positioned using the method of the current invention. The image"s   ray.scale range is optimized by centering the ABS sampling window 36 over the dense patient anatomy 34 in the image 30. It should be noted that the ABS sampling window 36 which is positioned according to the method of this invention avoids capturing non-attenuated x-ray photons. Repositioning and re-sizing the ABS window also captures an area of denser anatomy to assure that the correct kVp, mA, and gain are used to view the subject anatomy in the proper dynamic range In other words, the anatomical image will not be overly dark because the area of non-attenuated x-ray photons is munimized as a result of re-positioning and a denser area of patient anatomy will be accounted for in determining the strength of the x-rays.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4„ the method used in the current invention for moving the ABS sampling window compares the average gray scale value on the left half 60 of the ABS sampling window 14 with the average gray scale valu of the right half 62 to determine a horizontal (x-axis offset). It should also be apparent based on this disclosure that the left half or right half could be compared to the whole image 12, but it is more efficient io compare the halves of the ABS sampling window. The previously blanked out areas 16 of the fall image 10 arc not considered.<br>
Figure 5 shows that the same type of comparison is made between the top half 64 and bottom half 66 of the ABS sampling window 14 to determine the vertical (y-axis) offset.<br>
For ease of description and implementation the method of the current invention computes the average gray scale fox quadrants in the image, and then combines the appropriate quadrants to form a half which is then compared against the sum of the average gray scale of all the quadrants. In essence, this compares one half to the other half as described. Figure 6 is an elevational front view of the image 10 of Figure 1, wherein the image ROI 14 is segmented into quadrants. The segmented areas Ql, Q2, Q3 and Q4 define the regions from which statistical information is going to be taken for the ABS sampling window adjustments. It is<br><br><br>
important to note that the segment shape will be affected by clipping to correct for collinration. However, the number, location, and shape of the segments (or quadrants) may vary depending on the specific implementation.<br>
While the segments Ql. Q2, Q3 and Q4 are shown as being contiguous in Figure, 6, the segments, da oat have to be touching,. Thesegnente can be. spaaed apart from each other, or eVen overlap. Comparing the average gray scale values of the four quadrants of the image piovides enough information to make proportional position adjustments to the ABS sampling window. As previously mentioned, it is not necessary that each quadrant have the same shape or area. Comparing the gray scale average of each quadrant equalizes.their statistical weight, fegardless of the ratio of pixels sampled per quadrant.<br>
After segmenting, the next step is to determine an average gray scale value for each segment of the image. The method for calculating the average gray scale value for any selectable portion of the image is known to those skilled in the,art. For example, the gray scale values may vary between zero (0) which is equal to a completely black pixel, to 255 which is equal to a completely white pixeL A pixel that shows a non-attenuated x-ray beam because there is no patient tissue, bone or other material obstruction will generally be assigned the gray scale value of 255. In contrast, when an x-ray photon is unable to pass through an object, the pixel will general"y be assigned a value of zero. Accordingly, the pixels that show tissue, bone or other materials that have at least been penetrated by some of the x-ray photons will be assigned a vaVue on an absolute scaie extending from0to 155. It should be apparent that one skilled in the art could extend the gray scale values to be 12 bits, 16 bits or more as needed (e.g. 12 bits = 0-4095).<br>
After these average gray scale values are determined for all the segments, the next step is to calculate offset values on. the X and Y axes for the ABS sampling window. The offset values are determined as a function of spatial gray scale distribution within the segments.<br>
In Figure 6" the ROI 14 was divided into four equal segments. Accordingly, the equations used by the presently preferred method are shown in equations (1) and (2) below.<br><br><br>
Equation 1<br>
Xoff = (RQlSize/2)- (ROISize*(Q2%GS+ Q4%GS))<br>
Where: Xoff=	the Xoflset value of the ABS sampling window<br>
RQISize - the total number of pixels across the<br>
X axis of the ROI Q2%GS =       the percentage of gray scale<br>
distribution within the second<br>
segment Q4%GS =      the percentage of gray scale<br>
distribution within the fourth segment<br>
Equation 2<br>
Yoff = (ROJSize/2)- (ROISize*(Q3%GS+ Q4%GS)<br>
where: Yoff-	the Y oflset value to be applied to the ABS sampling<br>
window ROISize = the total number of pixels across Y<br>
axis of the ROI Q3%GS =       the percentage of gray scale distribution within the third segment Q4%GS =       the percentage of gray scale<br>
distribution within the fourth segment<br><br><br>
To calculate s result for equations I and 2, it is first necessary to calculate the percentage of gray scale distribution within a segment. This rcsuit is determined using equation 3.<br>
Equation 3 0(n)%GS = Q(n)AverageGS I SumOfQAverages<br>
where: Q(n)%GS	= the percentage of gray scale distribution within a<br>
segment n<br>
Q(n)AverageGS	= the average gray scale<br>
distribution in a segment n SumOfQAverages = the sum of the average gray<br>
scale distribution in all the segments 1 through n<br>
When the Xoflfset value and the Yoflset value have been determined, the ABS sampling window is then moved according to the offset values  Based on this disclosure it can be seen that equations could also be generated using Ql to create a functionally equivalent equation.<br>
In the embodiment described in the preceding pages, it is noted that the segments  Q1,Q2,Q3 and Q4 in Figure 6 all meet at a center of the image ROI 14 Accofdingly, the Xoffset and Yoffset can be considered to be an offset that is applied from the center of the image ROI 14, or from any point along an edge of the image ROI 14. The result will be the same. The ABS sampling window will be moved correctly.<br>
The size of the ABS sampling window is determined based on the generator kVp value, and the Image Imensiner size and magnification mode. The appropriate relationship lias been developed in the current invention between the kVp and the imaging of anatomical structures:<br><br><br>
Equation 4<br>
kVp = 40 + (2 y- anator.iy thickness in cm).<br>
This approximate relationship ha- bee; defined based on the insight implemented in this invention that most anatomical parts have roughly the same cross sectional dimension in the lateral and inline directions. The association is used to create a relationship between the ABS sampling window and the kVp, where the ABS sampiing window size is derived by solving the given equation:<br>
Equation 5	<br>
ABS window diameter(cm) - (kVp - 40) -2.<br>
The ABS sampling window diameter (as projected onto the surface of the image receptor or image intensifier) is also related to the image intensifier size and magnification modes, and so the image intensifier mode must be normalizedL This is done by dividing the calculated ABS sampling window diameter from the equation above by the image intensifier viewing diameter for each case.<br>
For example, suppose the kVp is 60 kVp which corresponds to 10 cm of anatomical thickness and therefore the approximate width or height of the anatomy. In addition, the calculated sampling window diameter projected onto the image intensifier is 10 cm or initially 43% of the 23 cm viewing image diameter. Then if a 23 cm image intensifier (or similar image receptor) is operated in 14 cm magnification mode, the sampling window percentage of the full screen is 10/14 or 71 percent. Thus, the ABS sampling diameter should be 71 percent of the current viewing image diameter. It should be realized based upon this disclosure that the constants used in Equations 4 and 5 could be modified depending on the application of the invention or the desired sizing relationship between the ABS window and the kVp.<br>
Since the kVp is being modified by the data found in the ABS sampling window, the range of the diameter must have an upper and lower limit so that the ABS sampling window does not become unstable. For example, if a small anatomical part such as a patient"s fingers (e.g. 1 cm thickness) are viewed in the<br><br><br>
x-ray system, it is possible for the ABS sampling window to become so small as a result of the sizing modification, that the positioning method could actually move the ABS window past the fingers because it does not know where the fingers are in the darkened segment. If the ABS sampling window rr sses the vie ./ed anatomy, it will only capture non-attenuated x-ray photons, so the image of the fingers will become darker and unusable. The upper limit exists because once a patient"s anatomy exceeds a certain percentage of the image size there is no reason to increase the ABS sampling window size because no advantage is gained by increasing the size. For example, if a patient"s torso fills the image, increasing the ABS sampling diameter past a certain point does not affect the kVp appreciably.<br>
The upper and lower limits for the diameter percentages can be determined through experimentation. The preferred diameter percentages are a lower limit of about 40 percent and an upper limit of about 70 percent of the image diameter. The diameter limits may vary depending on the image intensifier size, image intensifier magnification modes and the specific x-ray application.<br>
Since the preferred embodiment of the method of the current invention compares the average gray scale within each segment to the sum of gray scale averages for all quadrants, the segments are not required to have the same area or uniform dimensions. This is beneficial when it is necessary to modify the ROI (Region of Interest) due to collimator encroachment.<br>
Iris and leaf collimators provide an x-ray barrier to reduce exposure to the patient. As the collimators enter the image area they create dark borders. If the collimator position can be determined, these dark areas should be excluded when collecting average gray scale data. Figure 7 demonstrates how segment dimensions may be modified due to collimation.<br>
The steps of the presently preferred embodiment are shown in Figure 8. The first step 20 is to select an image ROI and a corresponding ABS sampling window. The next step 22 is to divide the image ROI into the necessary number, size and shape of segments. The next step 24 is to determine the average gray scale value for each segment of the image ROI as derived in equation 3. The next step 26 is to find the X and Y axis offsets for the ABS sampling window in<br><br><br>
accordance with the values determined in equations 1, 2 and 3. The next step 28 is to move,  the ABS sampling window ir accordance with the offsets determined in step 26.<br>
The next step 30 is to ; ze the ABS sampling window based on the value of the generator kVp and the image intensitier size and magnification mode. Then the sampling window is modified to account for the encroachment of the collimators into the sampling area during step 32. Finally, the imaging system makes the necessary measurements in the ABS sampling window to thereby determine an ABS value which is used to adjust the brightness of the image in step 34. The measurements include collecting statistical image pixel data within the ABS sampling window. The information includes the peak and average pixel values provided as inputs to determine the adjustments to be made within the ABS control logic module. Improving the-positiomng, size and shape of the ABS sampling window provides a better dynamic range of gray scale values in the anatomical images generated by the x-ray system. The adjustments made by the method of the current invention to the ABS sampling window allows better medical and diagnostic information to be gathered from x-ray images.<br>
Figure 9 is provided as an illustration of how the system operates in a modeled test on a clinical image. Specifically, the clinical image 40 is shown in a window of a computer display. It should be remembered that the statistics from the ABS sampling window 42 are fed to the ABS control system for closed loop control of the imaging system.<br>
In the demonstration window, there are selectable values in the lower left hand corner of the program window which are entered to model the values normally provided by the sizing and pixel sampling methods. These values include a size 44, an offset 46, a granularity 48, a dark clip 50, a diameter 52 and an offset factor 54.<br>
The size 44 refers to the size of the sample window in pixels. The offset 46 refers to the offsets in pixels that are to be applied to the ABS sampling window. The granularity 48 refers to the pixel sampling level. For example, the sampling can be speeded up if pixels are skipped and only every 2nd, 4*, 8th, etc, pixel in a quadrant or segment is sampled. The dark clip 50 refers to a gray scale<br><br><br>
threshold value which will he explained later. The diameter 52 refers to the diameter of the ABS sampling windo ^ in pixels which is controlled by the kVp and image intensiSer size and magnification as described above. The effect factor 54 refers to an amount to rf luce the movement of the ABS sampling wi ndow from its center origin.<br>
The dark clip 50 referred to above is a threshold value. It is possible for some gray scale values (like orthopedic appliances or non-attenuated x-ray beam) to drastically skew the readings for a segment. A dark clip 50 enables the system to ignore the gray scale values that Ml outside the set range of gray scale values. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the valid range of pixel gray scale values can be set with an upper and a lower bound. For example, a range could be established from 50 to 200. This range establishes a dark cBp and a white clip threshold which excludes very light and very dark values. The actval range of clipping values can be determined by various factors such as adaptive spatial sampling, dark mask sampling or direct experimentation.<br>
Figure 10 is provided as a result page of the calculations for determining the results of equations 1,2 and 3. The sample numbers given are the result of the analysis of the clinical image 40 in Figure 9. The results indicate that an Xoffset value of-42 and a Yoffset value of-39 were obtained. Note that the ROISize value is the length of a ROI square side or the ROI circle diameter in pixels.<br>
" The Q(n) percent gray scale values for the four segments Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 encompass a relatively large range of values. These values are the percentages of light pixels in each segment which make up the whole image in the image ROI. Note that the average gray scale value for QI is 56.93, which means the segment is rather dark (on a scale from 0 to 255).<br>
Figure 11 illustrates the current invention as it is used with an x-ray system. An x-ray tube is shown 100 which generates x-rays 104 that pass through an iris and leaf collimator 102. The x-rays 104 then pass through the patient 106 and into the intensificr tube 108 (image intensifier) which in turn generates an image that can be detected by the video camera 110. A video signal 111 becomes the input for the image processor which in turn generates digital image data 124 that is processed by the ABS sampling window processor 114 as described in<br><br><br>
detail above. The ABS sampling window processor 114 of the current invention determines the size of the ABS sampling window based on the value of the generator kVp 130, and the image intensifier size and magnification mode 122.<br>
The position of the AE   sampling window is calculated in 114 as described above with Equations I -3. Then finally, the ABS sampling window is clipped if necessary, based on the collmation information 128 from the collimator 102. It should be mentioned that the ABS sampling window processor could be a single application specific chip (ASIC), multiple ASICs or programmed general purpose processors.<br>
The modified ABS sampling window (ROI definition), information is then passed on to an Image Data Analyzer 116 which generates specific statistical informatioa about the image within the ABS sampling window and that statistical data 134 is passed to tie ASS control 118. A gain signa/126 is then sent form the ABS control 118 to the camera 110 based on. the image statistics received. Then the ABS control 118 sends a signal for the kVp (kflovolts) 138 and mA (millamps) 136 to the High Voltage (HV) generator based on the statistical information 134 received to control the system image brightness.<br>
There are also several afternative embodiments of the present invention which should be explored. An alternative embodiment of the invention may provide another criteria to detemune the ABS sampling window size. The ratio of the whole image average gray scale versus the quadrant average gray scale may be used to determine the ABS sampling window size. So if the whole image is unusually bright, that might indicate the anatomy within the image is small and the sampling window size should be reduced.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a factor for denning ABS window size is based on anatomical selection techniques. If the ABS application knows that the anatomy in the image field is, for example, a lateral wrist, a narrow rectangular sampling window provides more meaningful statistical information than a round sampling window.<br>
The offset 46 (shown in r igure 9) is also an alternative embodiment Specifically, the invention can be configured to move the ABS sampling window a smaller distance or a greater distance from the image center than the Xoffset and<br><br><br>
Yoffset values determines. This can be useful for fine adjustments when the mc"hod of ihe present invention does not automatically achieve an optimum ABS for the image on the monitor.<br>
Another alternative embodiment is to provide a method for t impening the movement of the ABS sampling window. This dampening effect can be obtained by adding temporal averaging to the method. In other words, averaging calculations can be performed for each frame or up to 30 times per second in order to provide dynamic (near real time) compensation.<br>
It is to be understood that the above-described arrangements are only illustrative of the application of the principles of the present mvention. Numerous modifications and alternative arrangements may be devised by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention- The appended claims are intended to cover such modifications and arrangements.<br><br><br>
