ALKENYL SUCCINIC ANHYDRIDES FOR USE IN PAPER MAKING<br>
This application claims priority from U.S. Provisional Application No.<br>
60/420,728, filed October 24, 2002, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to the papermaking arts, more particularly to<br>
a process for the manufacture of a paper having improved grease and water resistance<br>
and increased tensile strength, yet facilitating recycling of the paper. Such papers<br>
(throughout the specification and claims "papers" includes virgin or recycled paper,<br>
kraft stock and similar materials) find particular application in the container making<br>
art wherein such improved properties are desirable. The container making art,<br>
particularly, in the field of corrugated containers, folding cartons, and the tray and box<br>
industries, consumes much of the natural timber resources. Thus, it would be<br>
beneficial to formulate new processes of forming papers of improved wet strength<br>
having grease and water resistance properties as well as increase tensile strength<br>
which papers would be repulpable and therefore recyclable.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
The art of "papermaking" is an ancient one, being attributable to invention by<br>
the Chinese before the birth of Christ.<br>
As far back as containers have been needed, the use of wood has been the<br>
most popular, and has the longest history. Containers in the shape of barrels and<br>
crates have traditionally been used to carry and/or store many varied types of<br>
materials, including wet products such as produce, fish, meat, and poultry. This of<br>
course is not the limit to the requirements of packing wet or refrigerated products as<br>
there are many more wet packed products that contain water and ice or condensation<br>
from refrigeration to retard the ripening process or to maintain product freshness for<br>
distribution over wide geographical areas.<br>
In order to reduce costs, wooden crates were reused as many times as possible.<br>
For some products this caused health issues, because bacteria often grow on the<br>
surface of wood or in the cracks of the wood. As a result, crossover contamination of<br>
bacteria or viruses, such as salmonella, was common, from one crate to another, as<br>
proper sanitation was often not performed.<br>
The use of corrugated paper began to mature in the 1930"s and 1940"s as the<br>
container of choice for lightweight items. As the technology increased and the ability<br>
to make corrugated boxes out of heavier or thicker paper (or liner), the strength of the<br>
corrugated box increased. The corrugation strength of paper was demonstrating<br>
strengths that the wood crate manufacturers did not expect. The confidence of the<br>
corrugated suppliers along with the innovative minds in the corrugated industry-<br>
caused a new concept to be considered to perhaps penetrate the wet container market<br>
against the wooden crate. This was the introduction of the wax coated corrugated<br>
box. If the corrugated box coated with wax could be designed to hold products safely<br>
and in vertical stacking stresses that exceed 250 lbs., perhaps the wax would keep the<br>
paper/liner dry which would in turn keep the box rigidity and strength as high as in<br>
the dry environment, and thus replace the wooden crate. However, in order to<br>
increase the strength of a conventional corrugated box, it became necessary to use<br>
heavier and thicker paper.<br>
As a result of the superior properties of corrugated paper containers, wood<br>
crates were slowly phased out. The wooden crate was pushed out of every market in<br>
which the corrugated paper box was suitable for use. Since the 1940"s, the wax<br>
coated box has done an excellent job of supplying boxes for storing items such as<br>
produce, fish, meat and poultry.<br>
More modern developments resulted in the widely accepted Fourdrinier<br>
process (See generally Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd ed.,<br>
Vol. 9, pp. 846-7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1980, herein incorporated by<br>
reference in its entirety), in which a "furnish" (a "furnish" is predominantly water,<br>
e.g., 99.5% by weight and 0.5% "stock", i.e., virgin, recycled or mixed virgin and<br>
recycled pulp of wood fibers, fillers, sizing and/or dyes) is deposited from a headbox<br>
on a "wire" (a fast-moving foraminous conveyor belt or screen) which serves as a<br>
table to form the paper. As the furnish moves along, gravity and suction boxes under<br>
the wire draw the water out. The volume and density of the material and the speed at<br>
which it flows onto the wire determine the paper"s final weight.<br>
Typically, after the paper leaves this "wet end" of the papermaking machine, it<br>
still contains a predominant amount of water. Therefore, the paper enters a press<br>
section, generally comprising a series of heavy rotating cylinders, which press the<br>
water from the paper, further compacting it and reducing its water content, typically<br>
to 70% by weight.<br>
Thereafter, the paper enters a drying section. Typically, the drying section is<br>
the longest part of the paper machine. For example, hot air or steam heated cylinders<br>
may contact both sides of the paper, evaporating the water to a relatively low level,<br>
e.g., no greater than 10%, typically 2-8% and preferably 5% by weight of the paper.<br>
Following the drying section, the paper optionally passes through a sizing<br>
liquid to make it less porous and to help printing inks remain on the surface instead of<br>
penetrating the paper. The paper can go through additional dryers that evaporate any<br>
liquid in the sizing and coating. Calenders or polished steel rolls make the paper even<br>
smoother and more compact. While most calenders add gloss, some calenders are<br>
used to create a dull or matte finish.<br>
The paper is wound onto a "parent" reel and taken off the paper making<br>
machine.<br>
The paper on the parent reel can be further processed, such as on a<br>
slitter/winder, into rolls of smaller size or fed into sheeters, such as folio or cut-size<br>
sheeters, for printing end uses or even office application.<br>
In order to make conventional containers, rolls formed by slitter/winder (e.g.,<br>
of paper and kraft grades of liner) are unwound and coated with a wax. Waxes are<br>
used to impart water resistance and wet strength to the liner, but prohibits or<br>
otherwise inhibits recycling the used containers incorporating them. Additionally,<br>
conventional wax coated liners must be adhered to the other components of the<br>
container with hot melt adhesives. Most hot melt adhesives are a further impediment<br>
to recycling of formed containers because they employ wax containing components.<br>
Thus, there still exists a need for manufacturing paper possessing superior wet and<br>
tensile strength and water and grease resistance properties, but facilitating repulping<br>
and recycling thereof.<br>
Two methods for coating boxes or other paper products with liquid additives,<br>
such as wax, are conventionally used. The first is identified as a curtain coating<br>
process. This design incorporates a medium that is impregnated with hot wax and<br>
then becomes a corrugated box. A completed, i.e., combined, board is passed through<br>
a curtain of hot wax, in a procedure commonly known in the art of paper making as<br>
"curtain coaling." First one side and then the opposite side are coated with hot wax.<br>
However, due to the conditions necessary to perform the curtain coating process, fire<br>
becomes a significant risk.<br>
Another conventional paper coating process is "cascading" The cascading<br>
wax procedure is different from the curtain coating procedure in that a regularly<br>
corrugated box of any shape or size can be stood on end, such that the corrugated<br>
flutes are vertical, to allow the hot wax to permeate the entire structure, with a wax<br>
cascading around and through the container in a flat position that is easy to stack for<br>
shipping. In contrast to the curtain coating process, the cascading process requires the<br>
box to be fully formed prior to application of the wax or other liquid additive. This is<br>
considered the better performing wax box of the two described.<br>
Alternative coating procedures are also known in the art, such as those<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,858,173; No. 5,531,863; No. 5,429,294; and No.<br>
5,393,566, each of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, for<br>
example, surface coating to protect the outside of the liner on both sides to mimic a<br>
box subjected to the curtain coating procedure.<br>
Moreover, substitutes for wax coatings have been developed. For example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,393,566 discusses the use of acrylic on the paper machine to<br>
generate a moisture barrier. Even with the coated one side liner with the medium<br>
included in the design, the acrylic-coated boxes, described therein, equaled the<br>
performance of conventional wax coated boxes, coated via the cascade method.<br>
End users of conventional wax boxes are often faced with exorbitant charges<br>
for disposal fees, which can often exceed $80/ton of box waste. Because the coatings<br>
of the invention may be applied at any existing paper mill, such costs can be reduced<br>
to a one time sale of $70/ton, for a total cost savings is $150/ton at current pricing<br>
which is significant to national grocers. This industry is what is driving the demand<br>
for a solution to the waxed container that has given reliable service for about 60 years.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventor has discovered that amounts of AKD or ASA as an<br>
additive, either alone or in combination with other known additives, could create the<br>
wax free technologies of the future.<br>
In order to overcome the problems associated with conventional paper<br>
coatings, while still maintaining moisture resistance, the present invention includes<br>
the addition of at least one hydrocarbon dimer, such as alkyl ketene dimer (AKD),<br>
and/or alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA), for example, in the size press or calendar<br>
stack and most often in the wet end. Thus, a medium is created that outperforms<br>
waxed medium in laboratory testing for burst and tear strengths, and water resistance.<br>
As used herein, "AKD" may also be alkenyl ketene dimer, in addition to the alkyl<br>
ketene dimers discussed above.<br>
The specific coatings of the invention have equaled or exceeded conventional<br>
wax boxes used, for example, refrigerated or other wet strength environments, such as<br>
in poultry packaging. Generally, conventional waxed boxes last approximately 6-9<br>
days in wet environments such as heavy ice packs, because even with wax as a water<br>
barrier, the liner still becomes wet over time. However, applying a coating<br>
composition comprising AKD and/or ASA in the wet end of the paper making process<br>
provides a useable life that meets or exceeds that of waxed boxes. Additionally, the<br>
boxes of the present invention can last 1-2 months for long term storage, such as<br>
under refrigerated conditions, e.g., 34°F and high humidity and without ice.<br>
This success has prompted the inventors to consider the same formulation at<br>
the paper machine for liner. This would revolutionize the efficiencies and the<br>
economics of the entire cost structure and make wax alternative technology the<br>
unmistakable choice for performance, cost and the environment.<br>
No one has considered this approach before because a typical mill engineer<br>
would test the water drop of the liner or medium and assume that with such water<br>
resistance, that no one could corrugate the board, when the board is combined with<br>
any water based corn starch, which must first have been bound to the two liners and<br>
the medium. The coated boards of the invention also pass such tests as dry pins and<br>
wet pins. Wet pins are tested after the corrugated board has been submerged in water<br>
at room temperature for 24 hours and not only stay together but also offer a<br>
measurable resistance from being pulled apart. The inventor has studied the use of<br>
starches, such as ordinary corn starch, potato starch, wheat and tapioca, as binding<br>
and sizing agents. Thus in combination with one or more additives, AKD and/or ASA<br>
treated materials can replace conventional wax liners.<br>
In one embodiment the invention is directed to a process for making paper<br>
wherein a furnish is deposited on a wire and dewatered, wherein to the furnish is<br>
added a recyclable plastic coating composition comprising alkyl ketene dimer (AKD)<br>
and/or alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA), either alone or in combination with other<br>
additives or sizing agents, such as acrylics.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a process for making paper<br>
wherein a furnish is deposited on a wire and dewatered to form a paper, and the<br>
dewatered paper is subsequently pressed a number of times to further reduce the water<br>
content of the paper, characterized in adding a recyclable plastic coating composition,<br>
the coating comprising alkyl ketene dimer (ASA) and/or alkenyl succinic anhydride<br>
(ASA), to at least one side of the dewatered paper subsequent to a first pressing step.<br>
In a still further embodiment, the invention is directed to a process for making<br>
paper wherein a furnish is deposited on a wire and dewatered, the dewatered paper is<br>
subsequently pressed to further reduce the water content of the paper and<br>
subsequently calendered, characterized in introducing to at least one side of the paper<br>
a recyclable plastic coating composition, comprising alkyl ketene dimer (ASA) and/or<br>
alkyl succinic anhydride (ASA), between the pressing and calendering steps.<br>
A further embodiment discloses a process for making paper characterized in<br>
the following steps:<br>
(a) applying a furnish to a wire,<br>
(b) dewatering the furnish and obtaining a water containing paper,<br>
(c) pressing the water containing paper to reduce the water content,<br>
(d) calendering the pressed paper,<br>
(e) recovering a finished paper, and<br>
(f) adding a recyclable plastic coating, coating composition comprising alkyl<br>
ketene dimer (ASA) and/or alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) at any step during the<br>
paper making process.<br>

FIG. 2 is a schematic, side view of an alternative coating method.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A paper making machine in accordance with the invention is illustrated<br>
generally at 10 in FIG. 1. Typically, the paper making machine 1 comprises a "wet<br>
end" 11 including a headbox 12, a wire 13 and a press section 15, a drying section 16,<br>
a size press 18, calender section 20 and parent reel 22. Optionally, a dandy roll 14 is<br>
positioned about two thirds of the way down the wire to level the fibers and make the<br>
sheet more uniform. Gravity and suction boxes (not shown) are positioned<br>
underneath the wire to remove water from the furnish.<br>
The stock fed to the headbox 12 can be virgin, recycled or a mixture of virgin<br>
and recycled pulp. In the headbox 12, the stock is mixed with water to form a furnish<br>
for deposit onto the wire 13.<br>
I. The RPC<br>
In the invention, a recyclable plastic coating composition (RPC), comprising<br>
alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and/or alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA) is incorporated<br>
during the papermaking process. It should be understood that in this invention and<br>
throughout the specification and claims, "coating" means "coating" or "impregnation"<br>
unless otherwise indicated.<br>
A. Acrylic Acid Containing Material<br>
For example, a typical RPC composition is an aqueous acrylic acid containing<br>
material, such as homopolymers or copolymers of acrylic acid (for example,<br>
methacrylic acid, ethylacrylic acid, polyacrylic acid, crotonic acid, isocrotonic acid,<br>
pentenic acid, C (1-4) alkyl substituted acrylic acid, and other acrylic acids, such as<br>
butyl, amyl, octyl and hexadecyl, methylacrylate vinyl acetate, vinyl chloride,<br>
vinylidene chloride, isobutylene, vinyl ethers, acrylonitrile, maleic acid and esters,<br>
crolonic acid and esters, itaconic acid, and BASOPLAST 400 DS, BASOPLAST 250<br>
D, BASOPLAST 335 D, and BASOPLAST 265 D available from BASF Corporation<br>
of Mount Olive, New Jersey) resin based composition, comprising an acrylic<br>
homopolymer or copolymer, such as ethylene acrylic acid copolymer, in combination<br>
with alkyl ketene dimer (AKD) and/or alkenyl succinic anhydride (ASA).<br>
Additionally, aqueous dispersions of acrylic ester copolymers are considered as<br>
suitable acrylic containing components, such as ACRONAL NX 4787, ACRONAL S<br>
504 and ACRONAL S 728, available from BASF Corporation. As used throughout<br>
the specification and claims, references to "acrylic acid" and "acrylic acid containing"<br>
refer to materials and compositions, such as polymers, oligomers, or monomers,<br>
comprising at least one acrylic or acrylic acid moiety. Other typical acrylic acid<br>
containing solutions include JONCRYL 52, JONCRYL 56, JONCRYL 58,<br>
JONCRYL 61, JONCRYL 61LV, JONCRYL 62, JONCRYL 67, JONCRYL 74,<br>
JONCRYL 77, JONCRYL 80, JONCRYL 85, JONCRYL 87, JONCRYL 89,<br>
JONCRYL 91, JONCRYL 95, JONCRYL 503 and JONCRYL M-74, each of which<br>
is available from Johnson Wax Specialty Chemicals of Racine, Wisconsin.<br>
With respect to the acrylic acid containing material used in the invention, any<br>
conventionally known acrylic acid containing monomer, dimer or oligomer may be<br>
used, either alone or in combination with any number of other acrylic acid containing<br>
or non-acrylic acid containing monomer, dimer or oligomer.<br>
B. Ketene Dimers<br>
Ketene dimers used as cellulose reactive sizing agents are dimers having the<br>
formula: R(CH=C=O)2, where R is a hydrocarbon radical, such as alkyl having at<br>
least 8 carbon atoms, cycloalkyl having at least 6 carbon atoms, aryl, aralkyl and<br>
alkaryl, and decyl ketene dimer. Examples of suitable ketene dimers include octyl,<br>
decyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, hexadecyl, octadecyl, eicosyl, docosyl, tetracosyl, phenyl,<br>
benzyl, beta-naphthyl and cyclohexyl ketene dimers, as well as the ketene dimers<br>
prepared from montanic acid, naphthenic acid, ?9, 10-decylenic acid, ?9, 10 -<br>
dodecylenic acid, palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, ricinoleic acid, linolenic acid, and<br>
eleostearic acid, as well as ketene dimers prepared from naturally occurring mixtures<br>
of fatty acids, such as those mixtures found in coconut oil, babassu oil, palm kernel<br>
oil, palm oil, olive oil, peanut oil, rape oil, beef tallow, lard (leaf) and tall oil.<br>
Mixtures of any of the above-named fatty acids with each other may also be used.<br>
Such ketene dimers are described in U.S. Patent No. 4,407,994, herein incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety. An additional sufficient ketene dimer is sold under the<br>
tradename AQUAPEL, by Hercules, Inc., of Wilmington, Delaware. Further ketene<br>
dimers include alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, and alkaryl ketene dimers. Optionally, the ketene<br>
dimers are provided with a cationic starch to assist in binding to the cellulosic<br>
constituents..<br>
However, any ketene dimer is adequate. For example, the dimer may be a<br>
simple 13,-cyclobutadione or a unsaturated ß - lactone, examples of which are<br>
provided in Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology (3rd ed., Vol. 9, pp.<br>
882-7, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York 1980), herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
C. Alkenyl Succinic Anhydride<br>
Alkenyl succinic anhydride is typically produced from the reaction of<br>
an olefin with maleic anhydride. The maleic anhydride molecule supplies the reactive<br>
anhydride functionality to the ASA, while the long chain alkyl portion provides the<br>
hydrophobic properties associated with this size. The resulting succinic anhydride<br>
group is extremely reactive, and will complex with hydroxyl groups on cellulose,<br>
starch and water. It is the ASA molecule"s high reactivity that provides some of its<br>
major advantages.<br>
Due to the reactivity of ASA, the coating compositions incorporating ASA<br>
will readily cure on the paper machine without excessive drying or the use of<br>
promoters. As a result, most of the cure is achieved before the size press, allowing<br>
the machine to be run at similar moisture contents than those experienced under acid<br>
conditions, thus giving greater control of starch pick-up can be realized at the size<br>
press, resulting in full sizing at the reel and improved productivity.<br>
The tendency of the ASA molecule to react with water presents additional<br>
advantages. The ASA forms a di-acid, which is hydrophilic at one end of the<br>
molecule and hydrophobic at the other end. The di-acid has the ability to react with<br>
metal ions such as calcium or magnesium that are often found in water systems. The<br>
products of these reactions are sticky precipitates, and have the potential to deposit on<br>
the fabrics and frame of the paper machine, although it has been shown that a calcium<br>
salt can contribute to sizing. An aluminum salt is much less tacky however, and the<br>
presence of an aluminum source in the system is consequentially of great benefit.<br>
This ability to react with metal ions has been exploited in some mills, notably in<br>
Japan, where a potassium salt of a low molecular weight ASA is made and then<br>
precipitated onto the fiber using alum at acid pH in much the same way as rosin is<br>
used.<br>
Any ASA may be used in the invention. Commercial sizing agents based on<br>
ASA compounds are typically prepared from maleic anhydride and one or more<br>
appropriate olefins, generally C(14) to C (22) olefins. ASA compounds prepared from<br>
maleic anhydride and C(16)internal olefins, C(18 )internal olefins, and mixtures of C<br>
(16 )and C (18)internal olefins, are among the more widely used ASA compounds, as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 6,348, 132, herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety.<br>
D. Crosslinking Agent<br>
When an acrylic acid containing material is included in the RPC, an optional<br>
crosslinking agent is typically provided in an amount sufficient to crosslink the acrylic<br>
acid containing material. Although any substance capable of at least partially<br>
crosslinking the acrylic acid containing material is sufficient, often organic or<br>
inorganic substances including zinc, titanium or magnesium are used. Preferred<br>
however, are zinc oxide, aluminum oxide, ammonium oxide, calcium oxide,<br>
magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide, isostearate (e.g., 4-isostearate), stannous<br>
oxide, tungsten oxide, titanium oxide, and various mixtures, emulsions and<br>
compositions including one or more of the oxides. In one embodiment, the<br>
crosslinking agent includes a salt (as described herein) plus a butyric acid and 5-<br>
carbon acids, such as isovaleric, 2-methylbutyric and n-valeric acids. Other typical<br>
FDA approved cross linking agents include zinc octoate, zinc salts of fatty acids,<br>
zirconium oxide, calcium isosterate, calcium stearate, aluminum stearate, sodium<br>
tungstate, sodium tungstate dihydrate, calcium salts of fatty acids, magnesium salts of<br>
fatty acids, and aluminum salts of fatty acids. Generally, the fatty acids are fatty acids<br>
of animal and/or vegetable fats and oils, and would be exempt from being kosher<br>
compliant, since the potential use of animal oils and the original of the animal in<br>
question may be unspecified. In such cases, the inorganic substances would be<br>
preferred. It is considered within the scope of this invention to incorporate more than<br>
one substance to form the crosslinking agent. However, as used throughout the<br>
description and claims the term cross linking agent includes the above described<br>
compositions, as well as heat, radiation or any other method for initiating a<br>
crosslinking reaction in the acrylic containing resin. Other suitable crosslinking<br>
agents include Zinc Oxide Solution #1, available from Johnson Wax Specialty<br>
Chemicals of Racine, Wisconsin. For example, a typical (RPC) composition is an<br>
aqueous acrylic resin based composition. A preferred three-component composition<br>
contains the composition disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 5,393,566 (hereinafter "the<br>
"566 patent"), modified by the addition of ASA and/or AKD. For example,<br>
compatible compositions contain anywhere from 0-100% ASA or AKD, with the<br>
remainder consisting of the acrylic acid resin containing composition of the "566<br>
patent. Typical compositions can include the following, by weight percent, anywhere<br>
from 0-100%, typically 25-75% and more typically, 25-30% ASA; from 0-100%,<br>
typically 25-75 and more typically 25-30% AKD; with the remainder being the<br>
acrylic acid containing composition of the "566 patent, typically 1-99%, more<br>
typically, 1-10% or 10-40%.<br>
E. MEA<br>
NH4OH may also be added to the RPC as a pH regulator for<br>
blending/dissolving/dispersing of the resins and emulsions and dispersions of acrylics.<br>
However, often, in order to remove undesired characteristics of the RPC, produced by<br>
the ammonium hydroxide, monoethanolamine (MEA) can be substituted for both toll<br>
coaters and mill environments. The heat of the paper mill has exasperated the<br>
volatility of ammonium hydroxide causing more discomfort in producing wax<br>
alternative medium and liners. When substituting NH4OH with MEA in a one to one<br>
replacement (by weight) the odor is reduced if not removed and the performance is<br>
equal if not slightly better. However, it is also considered, within the scope of this<br>
invention to substitute MEA for NH4OH anywhere from 0.5-2.0 to 1 by weight,<br>
preferably, 1.5:1, i.e.,50% more MEA for every gram of NH4OH. Generally, NH4OH<br>
is delivered in a 28% aqueous solution, i.e., the highest concentration commercially<br>
available. Although any alkanolamine may be used, MEA is preferred.<br>
F. Alumina-Silica<br>
Moreover, clay poweders, comprising, for example, Al2 Si2 (Alumina-Silica)<br>
may be used as an additive to the wax free formulae of this invention. The addition of<br>
minerals to the formula has proven to be multifaceted in its benefits. First of all, it<br>
has lowered Moisture Vapor Transmission Rate (MVTR, a measure of the passage of<br>
water vapor through a barrier) numbers into the range that will permit the substitution<br>
of our product as a replacement of wax or polyethylene for long-term storage of copy<br>
paper which is sensitive to temperature and moisture changes. More often moisture,<br>
but with the moisture capacity of the atmosphere directly affected by temperature both<br>
must be identified for the total severe environment that ream wrap and bulk boxes<br>
must address to protect copy paper from becoming distorted from moisture thus<br>
rendering the paper unfit for use in a copy machine and resulting in a credit from the<br>
paper producer. Alumina Silica, Calcium Carbonate, Titanium Dioxide are all<br>
satisfactory for use in this type of performance. Without a mineral additive the<br>
MVTR rating is approximately 30 gm/m2, for 24 hours. With an addition of 8%<br>
mineral, most preferably Alumina/Silica, the MVTR drops to numbers under 15<br>
gm/m2 which is the accepted target for ream wrap and bulk boxes for copy paper and<br>
other papers in larger dimensions that are made under the same conditions and<br>
requiring the same sort of performance. Alumina/Silica is preferred because it works<br>
as well any mineral and suspends in the formulae of this invention satisfactorily and is<br>
the least costly of the several minerals available on the market. Additionally the heat<br>
resistance and the potential concerns of re-softening while bonding on the corrugator<br>
has reduced emensely. So with the hardening of the coated surface above the levels<br>
generated in the cross linking actions has also caused a greater receptiveness to the<br>
product by the corrugator operators. This benefit has occurred without detriment to<br>
the surface for receiving water based inks and bonding performance of cold set<br>
adhesives or hot melt adhesives.<br>
II. Method of Applying the RPC<br>
The inventor has discovered that a product having superior water-proof<br>
properties results when the RPC of the invention is added to Kraft, linerboard or<br>
medium, whether incorporated as a coating, at the wet-end, in the furnish, calender, or<br>
press. When Kraft, linerboard or medium is used, in one embodiment, a starch<br>
containing component is often incorporated to achieve the elevated water-proof<br>
properties. Such starch containing components may include ordinary corn starch,<br>
potato starch, wheat or tapioca starches. Using the RPC of the invention with a starch<br>
containing component does not affect the bonding performance of the starch when<br>
making products, such as corrugated board, could lead to concentrations high enough<br>
that the use of acrylic acid containing material at the size press or the wet end could<br>
be eliminated completely.<br>
Within the laboratory environment, liner board was repulped to conform with<br>
the consistency of pulped fiber processed in an average paper mill machine. At this<br>
point, the fiber was separated into four separate beakers each with 100 grams of fiber.<br>
To beaker number 1, 5.0 grams of RPC-1 (described below) was added. In beaker<br>
number 2, 10.0 grams of RPC-1 was added. In beaker number 3, 20.0 grams of RPC-<br>
1 was added. In beaker number 4, 30.0 grams of RPC-1 was added.<br>
After stirring the fiber mixed with RPC at various levels, the fiber from each<br>
beaker was applied to a wire mesh which would simulate the wire mesh of a paper<br>
machine which allows the fiber to drain by gravity or assisted through a particle<br>
vacuum action that starts the removal of fluids on the paper machine. Through<br>
gravity and compression in the laboratory environment, excess fluids were driven out<br>
of the fiber of each test sample, one through four. To simulate paper machine drying<br>
the fiber, still on the wire mesh, was dried by infra-red heat. After all four test<br>
samples were dried, the surfaces were tested for grease resistance and water<br>
resistance. A fifth sample was repulped, screened and dried without any RPC to be<br>
the control. Samples one through four showed improved grease and water resistance<br>
when compared to the control. The final phase was to repulp samples one through<br>
four, rescreen and dry. The final step in the process to determine success is<br>
examining the dry reformed paper under a microscope to determine the presence of<br>
undissolved foreign matter that would indicate a failure to repulp. The examination<br>
revealed that no undissolved material was present, indicating success in creating a<br>
barrier and having the barrier, RPC, dissolve and allow no foreign matter to be present<br>
in any beaker marked one through four. The foregoing experiment is indicative of<br>
addition of RPC to the stock or furnish prior to deposit on the wire of a paper making<br>
machine.<br>
The next step in taking the invention from the laboratory to a commercially<br>
viable process was to introduce the RPC at different locations in conventional paper<br>
making machines.<br>
II. Testing Runs<br>
A position on the paper machine downstream of the headbox 12 was selected<br>
for a manual "pour on" of liquid RPC on an edge of the paper approximately 24<br>
inches (58.8 cm) of the width of the paper machine, in the amount of 5 gallons (18.92<br>
L). This section of treated paper was tracked through the paper machine and retrieved<br>
at the dry end of the machine. This retrieval section was tested for grease and water<br>
resistance and wet-strength and additionally showed improvement in each area.<br>
RPC was next applied with a spraybar, the application rate applied from a<br>
minimum value, but sufficient to create perceptible enhancements to liner or medium,<br>
to approximately 40% by weight of paper, pH varied from 5.5 to 8.0.<br>
The RPC was applied at the wet end via spray application to the top side of the<br>
sheet during a run of 26# medium. The trial spray head was positioned at:<br>
(1) the wet/dry line on the wire, and<br>
(2) after the second press, before the dryer.<br>
Subsequently, the RPC-1 was applied via calendar stock treatment to a 69#<br>
special liner. The purpose of this trial was to ascertain the viability of this application<br>
technique utilizing two water boxes on one side. The results of this latter trial is<br>
shown in Table I:<br>
Alternatively, as shown in FIG. 2, coating on both sides of a moving paper<br>
web 24 can be effected by passing web 24 between the nip of rollers 26, 28 in which a<br>
bank 30 of RPC is found thereby applying the RPC to one side of web 24. After<br>
passing over idler roll 32, the other side of the web 24 can be coated by bank 40 and<br>
rollers 36, 38. Additional layers of coating may be applied one or more times to<br>
either or both sides of web 24 by additional rollers 46, 48, 56, 58 and banks 50 and<br>
60. Additional idler rolls 42,<br>
52 may be provided to convey and tension web 24. The device of FIG. 2 can be used<br>
prior to, subsequent to, or in place of size press 18 of FIG. 1. It should be understood<br>
that additional rollers (not shown), banks (not shown) and even idler rolls (not shown)<br>
may be employed to apply as many additional layers of RPC as desired. Additionally,<br>
sizing agents may be incorporated into one or more of the banks of RPC.<br>
All of the foregoing tests produced a paper that was repulpable. Thus,<br>
corrugated boxes and components thereof can be recycled even when such boxes have<br>
been made water and grease resistant, i.e., combined with the RPC of the invention.<br>
In addition, the addition of RPC appears to dramatically increase fiber strengths.<br>
Using 100% recycled fiber treated with RPC increased fiber strengths, giving<br>
strengths of 90% of virgin fiber, whereas normal recycled fiber are approximately<br>
60% of virgin fiber. However, in commercial embodiments, the RPC may be used in<br>
amounts such as approximately 0.5-10 dry lbs. per ton of paper, typically<br>
approximately 1-5 dry lbs. per ton, and preferably approximately 3 dry lbs. per ton.<br>
For example, approximately 3.5 dry lbs. may be incorporated into the wet end of the<br>
paper machine for medium, and approximately 7.0 dry lbs. per ton can be used for<br>
commercial production runs of liner. Thus, the inventor has discovered that higher<br>
amounts of AKD and/or ASA can be used, such that the use of an acrylic acid<br>
containing composition at the wet end can be eliminated completely.<br>
The process of paper making can be modified to include RPC addition at the<br>
headbox (or even upstream of the headbox when the stock is mixed with fillers, sizing<br>
or dyes), in the press section at any point subsequent to the first press, and subsequent<br>
to the drying section, either at or in place of the size press but before the calenders.<br>
The papers coated by the process find special use in the following industries,<br>
the label industry, especially the 60 lb./3000 ft2 label industry, folding carton, tray and<br>
box (all board weights) and liquid packs, such as water, soda, and milk, ice cream,<br>
yogurt and delicatessen carry-out containers.<br>
The fine paper industry for barrier containers and interleaves for between<br>
sensitive paper or metallized papers or photographic plates can also benefit from the<br>
invention.<br>
By using the invention to apply a coating formulation into a paper making<br>
machine, the following benefits are achieved:<br>
(1) the overall cost of the finished coated/impregnated liner or paper is<br>
reduced, and<br>
(2) incorporating the technology into the paper making machine (process)<br>
would allow the technology to reach its maximum potential.<br>
The coated materials of the invention also pass the Edge Wick Test. A strip of<br>
medium or liner to be tested is cut into a 1 inch by 6 inch square and stood in 1/8<br>
inches of water. Conventional medium will pull water into the structure, but the<br>
incorporation of ASA and/or AKD, and optionally an acrylic acid containing<br>
substance, eliminates or significantly reduces such "edge wicking". Since dry fibers<br>
are known to be stronger than wet fibers, by not absorbing water, the medium of the<br>
invention has shown it can maintain its strength even in wet environments.<br>
Additionally, the coated materials of the invention have stacking strengths at<br>
least as great as conventional wax coated materials. Stacking strength is measured via<br>
the Edge Crush Test, wherein the materials are placed in a high humidity and low<br>
temperature environment and crushed with test equipment as described by TAPPI<br>
Test Method T811 "Edgewise compressive strength of corrugated fiberboard (short<br>
column test)", herein incorporated by reference in its entirety and included as<br>
Appendix I. This test resulted in the data provided as Table III, showing Edge Crush<br>
of corrugated board and the resulting retention percentage of vertical strength after<br>
being subjected to the humidity.<br>
In this test, and in all tests described herein, "Wax Dip" refers to conventional fully<br>
wax impregnated cabbage boxes; "Curtain Coated" refers to bell pepper boxes,<br>
curtain coated on both sides with conventional wax containing coatings; while<br>
Samples 1-3 are three separate runs of paper products according to the invention.<br>
Paper products according to the invention also show similar pin adhesion<br>
properties, when measured according to Test Method T 821 om-96: "Pin Adhesion of<br>
Corrugated Board by Selective Separation", herein incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety, as shown by the data in Table IV.<br>
As used in Tables III and IV, Sample 1 is 26# medium with 69# liner on both sides.<br>
Sample 2 is 35# medium with 74# liner on both sides. Sample 3 is 25# medium with<br>
90# liner on both sides. Each of the liners are coated or treated as described above,<br>
having received 2.0-2.2 dry lbs./1000 ft2 of RPC-1. The mediums for Table VII<br>
received 0.5-1.0 dry lbs/1000 ft2 of RPC-1.<br>
A Ring Crush Test (RCT) of paperboard (as described by TAPPI Test Method<br>
822, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety), 26# 100% recycled medium,<br>
formed in accordance with the invention showed superior properties over untreated<br>
medium, as shown in Table V for fibers oriented in the machine direction (MD) and<br>
Table VI for fibers oriented in the cross direction (CD). For each test, a ½" by 6"<br>
sample was stipsplaced in special ring shaped holders and crushed by the testing<br>
equipment.<br>
Thus, significant improvements are made in both MD and CD Ring Crush Tests when<br>
RPC-1 is added to 26# 100% recycled medium. Specifically, when the RPC is<br>
utilized an increase of 30% can be observed over industry norms without any<br>
treatment. Table V additionally demonstrates a significant and unexpected increase<br>
in tensile strength of 19.1%.<br>
In order to achieve the treated medium according to the invention, a two-part<br>
process is preferred. Specifically, at the wet end, the AKD is added, preferably in an<br>
amount of between 1 and 10, typically 3.5, dry pounds per ton of stock. Typical AKD<br>
is commonly available in the market as KEYDIME C125, an allyl ketene dimmer<br>
stabilized with cationic starch, specially formulated for use with micro and<br>
nanoparticle systems and available from EKA Chemicals of Bohus, Sweden. This<br>
particular AKD also exhibits self retentive characteristics and high efficiency and<br>
withstands elevated wet end temperatures.<br>
Later during the process, for example, at the size press or calender stack, a<br>
second treatment may be performed. In a preferred embodiment, this second<br>
treatment includes the application of a blend of acrylate (0.5 -2 lbs./1000 ft2, typically<br>
1 lbs./1000 ft2 of paper produced) with a synthetic polyethylene (1-20%, typically<br>
10% wt.), a cross-linking agent, such as zinc oxide (0.1-10%, typically 3% wt.). The<br>
remainder of the additive used in the second treatment is typically a solvent,<br>
preferably water. Typical acrylates include methylmethacylate, sold as Gellner K-21,<br>
available from Gellner &amp; Co. of Gillette, New Jersey. Typical repulpable synthetic<br>
polyethylenes are sold under the tradenames JONWAX 22, JONWAX 26, JONWAX<br>
28 and JONWAX 120, each of which is available from Johnson Wax Specialty<br>
Chemicals of Racine, Wisconsin.<br>
However, it is additionally considered within the scope of the invention to<br>
eliminate the size press or calender stack application, in favor of a modified wet end<br>
application (WEGP). In one embodiment, the acrylic containing resin (e.g., 10-40 dry<br>
lbs./ton) and the AKD (1-20 dry Ibs./ton) are added at the wet end. A preferred<br>
WEGP comprises Gellner K-21 (20 or 35 dry lbs/ton) as the acrylic resin and<br>
Keydime 125C (7 dry lbs./ton) as the AKD component. Other typical WEGP<br>
compositions include from approximately 15-40 dry lbs./ton of the Gellner K-21<br>
containing resin and from approximately 2-10 dry lbs/ton of the AKD, e.g., Keydime<br>
125C, for example 35 or 20 dry lbs./ton acrylic containing resin with 7 dry lbs./ton<br>
AKD.<br>
Experiments have shown that medium treated with this process has shown<br>
moisture resistance at least as great as conventional cascade-coated wax medium.<br>
Additionally, the "wet-end only" treated medium (WEGP) performs equal with<br>
respect to moisture resistance when compared to the "wet-end plus calender stack"<br>
treated medium described above. For example, surface water absorption over 30<br>
seconds, expressed in g/m2, measured by Cobb Test (see TAPPI T 441, herein<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety), ring crush test and Concora tests (see TAPPI<br>
T 809, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety) show such properties.<br>
Moreover, by eliminating the calender stack treatment, the paper machine is permitted<br>
to run at a higher rate, because if the RPC is added into the wet end and not at the<br>
calender or size press, the machine speeds can double. Table VII, below, compares<br>
the WEGP chemical medium, wherein each test is run according to the standards as<br>
described by the respective TAPPI test method, each of which is herein incorporated<br>
by reference in its entirety.<br>
The following RPC (RPC-2) was used in the "WEGP AKD size press"<br>
example of Table VII: JONCRYL 82 (60% wt); JONCRYL 61LV (20%); zinc oxide<br>
(3%), ammonium hydroxide (3%); JONWAX 28 (5%), with the remainder being<br>
water to dilute the RPC to the desired viscosity. JONCRYL 82 is a heat-resistant<br>
polymer available from Johnson Wax Specialty Chemicals. JONCRYL 61LV is an<br>
acrylic acid containing resin composition available from Johnson Wax Specialty<br>
Chemicals, and includes JONCRYL 678, available from Johnson Wax Specialty<br>
Chemicals, (35.0 wt %), ammonia 28% (7.5 wt %), ethylene glycol (.15% wt %)<br>
isopropyl alcohol (5.0 wt %) water (51.0 wt %), and optionally blended with one or<br>
more acrylic acid containing resins.<br>
The following RPC (RPC-3) was used in the "WEGP AKD" example of Table<br>
VII: Gellner K-21 (35 dry lbs./ton) and Keydime C125 (7 dry lbs./ton).<br>
As used in Table VII, WEGP AKD is used in the wet-end of the paper making<br>
process because it is cationic. In contrast, the size press composition utilizes a non-<br>
ionic polymer, to be used in the size press. Thus, it can be seen the WEGP size press<br>
medium exhibits less water absorption in the Cobb test, less porosity in the Gurley<br>
test and is slightly higher in the Grammage and Basis Weight results when compared<br>
to the WEGP AKD medium.<br>
Typical liners produced in accordance with the invention are subjected to a rod<br>
coating first process and a top coating second process. In the first process, a blend of<br>
1 lbs./1000 ft2 and 50% styrene-butadiene rubber latex (50% wt.) is added along with<br>
the following composition:<br>
Thereafter, the top coating process is performed with an RPC similar to the<br>
RPC used in the first process. Specifically, the RPC of the second process is lacking<br>
the latex.<br>
A typical acrylic is JONCRYL 61LV from Johnson Wax Specialty Chemicals,<br>
a 33% ammonia solution of an acrylic resin. The crosslinking agent as discussed<br>
above, is typically zinc oxide, while the polyethylene is preferably JONWAX 28, a<br>
repulpable fine particle polyethylene emulsion, added merely for slip benefit for when<br>
the product is being processed in the machines. Although many synthetic<br>
polyethylenes are classified as "waxes", the low level of polyethylene added<br>
according to the present invention is not sufficient to perform as a conventional wax.<br>
In contrast, conventional wax coatings employ much higher levels of natural wax,<br>
such as paraffin wax, often in amounts greater than 6 dry lbs/ton.<br>
The following is a typical RPC, utilized in the first process (hereinafter RPC-<br>
1): methylmethacrylate (35 dry lbs/ton) zinc oxide (3% wt.), and Keydime 125C (3.5<br>
dry lbs./ton). Preferably, use of RPC-1 is followed by an application of 10% wt. of<br>
the Jonwax 22 synthetic repulpable wax. Optionally, a starch such as corn starch is<br>
included up to 4% wt.<br>
As detailed above, it is advantageous to include cationic particles in the<br>
coating composition according to the present invention. Such cationic particles may<br>
be inorganic (such as salts) or organic (such as monomers or polymers). Additionally,<br>
non-ionic and anionic polymers with artificial charges of a cationic nature may be<br>
employed. In other words, when a non-cationic material is introduced into the wet<br>
end, a retention aid is typically premixed with the non-cationic material to cause it to<br>
bond more successfully with the naturally anionic fiber may be used to suspend the<br>
cationic particle and activate bonding to the anionically charged fiber. Such charged<br>
particle systems may be used in combination as, with or in lieu of, the acrylic<br>
containing resin and/or ASA/AKD additives detailed above, and can be applied at any<br>
stage of the paper making process, e.g., in the wet end, at the calender stack or as a<br>
coating following production of the paper product. Thus, the use of a cationic<br>
polymer, i.e.. without a retention aid, results in a product that is more effective than<br>
such typical products requiring such a retention aid. Typical particles have a<br>
molecular weight number average between about 10,000 and 100,000, typically about<br>
30,000-50,000. However, the preferred cationic material is Gellner OTTOPOL K21<br>
from Gellner &amp; Co., an acrylic copolymer, and Poly Emulsion 392C30, a cationic<br>
emulsion of high density polyethylene from GenCor or Chester, New York.<br>
For example, the cationic material may include the acrylic containing resin.<br>
Suitable cationic acrylic resins include STH-55, manufactured by Mitsubishi Yuka<br>
Fine, Japan; and BASOPLAST 265 D, available from BASF Corporation of Mount<br>
Olive, New Jersey.<br>
Additionally, the cationic material may be a cationic wax to enhance the wet<br>
resistances generated in the wet end. Such formulations are substantially similar to<br>
RPC-1, wherein approximately 1- approximately 20% of the formulations is the<br>
cationic wax, such as a synthetic polyethylene wax. Preferably, the cationic wax<br>
makes up approximately 2- approximately 18, and more preferably, approximately<br>
4.0- approximately 16-.0% of the RPC.<br>
Although the present invention has been described in terms of specific<br>
embodiments, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various modifications<br>
may be made according to those embodiments without departing from the scope of<br>
the applied claims and their equivalents. Accordingly, the present invention should<br>
not be construed to be limited to the specific embodiments disclosed herein.<br>
