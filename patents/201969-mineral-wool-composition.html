				<td>MINERAL WOOL COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of artificial mineral wools. It is aimed more particularly 5  at mineral wools  intended for manufacturing thermal and/or  acoustic  insulation  materials  or  soilless-culture substrates.<br>
It concerns more particularly mineral wools of the  rock-wool  type,  that  is  to ^say  the  chemical<br>
10  compositions of which wools involve a   high liquidus temperature and a high fluidity at their fiberizing; temperature,  combined  with  a  high  glass  transition temperature.<br>
Conventionally,  this type of mineral wool is<br>
15 fiberized by so-called "external" centrifuging processes, for example of the type of those using a cascade of centrifuging wheels fed with molten material by a static delivery device, as described in particular in Patents EP-0,465,310 or EP-0,439,385.<br>
20	The    so-called    "internal"    centrifuging<br>
fiberizing process, that is to say that using centrifuges rotating at high speed and drilled with holes, is, on the other hand, conventionally reserved for fiberizing mineral wool of the glass-wool type,<br>
25 schematically having a composition richer in alkali metal oxides and having a low alumina content, a lower liquidus temperature and a higher viscosity at the fiberizing temperature than rock wool. This process is described, in particular, in Patents EP-0,189,354 and<br>
30  EP-0,519,797.<br>
However, technical solutions have recently been developed which make it possible to adapt the internal centrifuging process to the fiberizing of rock wool, especially  by  modifying  the  composition  of  the<br>
35 constituent material of the centrifuges and their operating parameters. For further details on this subject, reference may be made especially to Patent WO 93/02977. This adaptation has proved to be particularly beneficial in the sense that it allows<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
properties which hitherto were inherent in one or other of the two types of wool - rock wool or glass wool - to be combined. Thus, the rock wool obtained by internal centrifuging has a quality comparable to that of glass 5 wool, with a lower content of unfiberized material than rock wool obtained conventionally. However, it retains the two major advantages associated with its chemical nature, namely a low chemicals cost and a high temperature withstand capability.<br>
10	There are therefore now two possible ways of<br>
fiberizing rock wool, the choice of one or other depending on a number of criteria, including the quality level required for the intended application and the level of industrial and economic feasibility.<br>
15	To these criteria have in recent years been<br>
added that of biodegradability of mineral wool, namely its ability to be rapidly dissolved in a physiological medium, so as to prevent any potential pathogenic risk associated with the possible accumulation of the finest<br>
20  fibres in the body by inhalation.<br>
One solution to the problem of choosing the composition of a rock-type mineral wool having a biosoluble nature consists in the use of a high content of alumina and moderate alkali contents.<br>
25	This solution results in particular in high raw<br>
materials costs because of the preferred use of bauxite.<br>
The object of the present invention is to improve the chemical composition of rock-type mineral<br>
30 wools, the improvement being aimed especially at increasing their biodegradability with the ability for them to be fiberized especially and advantageously by internal centrifuging, while still maintaining the possibility  of  obtaining  these  compositions  from<br>
35  inexpensive raw materials.<br>

According to an advantageous embodiment of the 5  invention, the mineral wool comprises the constituents<br>

TiO2	0-3%,<br>
In the rest of the text, any percentage of a<br>
constituent of the composition should be understood to<br>
mean  a  percentage  by  weight  and  the  compositions 10  according to the invention may include up to 2, or 3% of<br>
compounds to be considered as unanalysed impurities, as<br>
is known in this kind of composition.<br>
The selection of such a composition has allowed<br>
a whole raft of advantages to be combined, especially 15  by varying the many and complex roles that a number of<br>
these specific constituents play.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
It has in fact been able to be shown that the combination of a high alumina content, of between 16 and 27%, preferably greater than 17% and/or preferably less than 25%, especially less than 22%, for a sum of 5 network formers - silica and alumina - of between 57 and 75%, preferably greater than 60% and/or preferably less than 72%, especially less than 70%, with a high amount of alkalis (R2O: soda and potash) of between 10 and 17%,  with an MgO content of between 0 and 5%,<br>
10 especially between 0 and 2%, when R2O 
15 the embodiments of the invention, the alkali content is preferably greater than 12%, especially greater than 13.0% and even 13.3%, and/or preferably less than 15%, especially less than 14.5%.<br>
This  range  of  compositions  proves  to  be<br>
20 particularly beneficial as it has been able to be observed that, contrary to the received opinions, the viscosity of the molten glass does not drop significantly with increasing alkali content. This remarkable effect makes it possible to increase the<br>
25 difference between the temperature corresponding to the viscosity for fiberizing and the liquidus temperature of the phase which crystallizes, and thus to considerably improve the fiberizing conditions, and especially makes it possible to fiberize a new family<br>
30  of biosoluble glasses by internal centrifuging.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the compositions have iron oxide contents of between 0 and 5%, especially greater than 0.5% and/or less than 3%, especially less than 2.5%. Another embodiment is<br>
35 obtained with compositions which have iron oxide contents of between 5 and 12%, especially between 5 and 8%, which may allow mineral-wool blankets to exhibit fire resistance.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
Advantageously,  the compositions according to the invention satisfy the relationship:<br>
(Na2O  +  K20)/A12O3 &gt; 0.5,  preferably  {Na2O  +<br>
K2O) /A12O3 &gt; 0.6,  especially  (Na2O + K2O)/A12O3 &gt; 0.7,<br>
5  which appears to favour the obtaining of a temperature<br>
corresponding to the viscosity for fiberizing which is<br>
greater than the liquidus temperature.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, the compositions according to the invention preferably have<br>
10 a lime content of between 10 and 25%, especially greater than 12%, preferably greater than 15% and/or preferably less than 23%, especially less than 20%, and even less than 17%, combined with a magnesia content of between  0  and  5%,  with  preferably  less  than  2%<br>
15 magnesia, especially less than 1% magnesia and/or a magnesia content of greater than 0.3%, especially greater than 0.5%.<br>
According to another variant, the magnesia content is between 5 and 10% for a lime content of<br>
20  between 5 and 15%, and preferably between 5 and 10%.<br>
Adding P2O5, which is optional, at contents of between 0 and 3%, especially greater than 0.5% and/or less than 2%, may allow the biosolubility at neutral pH to be increased. Optionally, the composition may also<br>
25 contain boron oxide which may allow the thermal properties of the mineral wool to be improved, especially by tending to lower its coefficient .of thermal conductivity in the radiative component and also  to  increase  the  biosolubility  at  neutral  pH.<br>
30 Optionally, TiO2 may also be included in the composition, for example up to 3%. Other oxides, such as BaO, SrO, MnO, Cr2O3 and ZrO2, may be present in the composition, each up to contents of approximately 2%.<br>
The   difference   between   the   temperature<br>
35 corresponding to a viscosity of 102*6 poise (decipascal.second) , denoted Tiog 2.5, and the liquidus of the crystallizing phase, denoted Tiiq, is preferably at least 10°C. This difference,- Tiog 2.5 - Tiiq, defines the  "working  range"  of  the  compositions  of  the<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
indention, that is to say the range of temperatures within which it is possible to fiberize, most particularly by internal centrifuging. This difference is preferably at least 20 or 30°C, and even more than 5  50°C, especially more than 100°C.<br>
The compositions according to the invention have high glass transition temperatures, especially greater than 600°C. Their annealing temperature (denoted Tanneaiing) is especially greater than 600°C.<br>
10	As mentioned above, the mineral wools have a<br>
satisfactory level of biosolubility, especially at acid pH. Thus, they generally have a rate of dissolution, especially measured with regard to silica, of at least 30 and preferably of at least 4 0 or 50 ng/cm2 per hour<br>
15  measured at pH 4.5.<br>
Another very important advantage of the invention concerns the possibility of using inexpensive raw materials for obtaining the composition of these glasses. These comoositions mav esoeciallv result from<br>
20  the melting of rocks^.  for 'example of" the phonolite type,  with  an  alkaline-earth  carrier,  for  example1 limestone or dolomite, if necessary supplemented with' iron ore. By this means, an alumina carrier of moderate cost is obtained.<br>
25	This type of composition, having a high alumina<br>
content and a high alkali content, may be advantageously melted in fired or electric glass furnaces.<br>
Further      details      and      advantageous<br>
30 characteristics will emerge from the description below of non-limiting preferred embodiments.<br>
Table 1 below gives the chemical compositions, in percentages by weight, of five examples.<br>
When the sum of all the contents of all the<br>
35 compounds is slightly less or slightly greater than 100%, it should be understood that the difference from 100% corresponds to the unanalysed minority impurities/components  and/or  is  due  merely  to  the<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
accepted approximation in this field in the analytical methods used.<br>

The compositions according to these examples were fiberized by internal centrifuging, especially according to the teaching of the aforementioned Patent<br>
10  WO 93/02977.<br>
The working ranges, defined by the difference Tiog 2.5 ~ Tuq, are largely positive. All have a (Na2O + K2O)/AI2O3 ratio of greater than 0.7 for a high alumina content of approximately 17 to 20%, with quite a high<br>
15   (SiO2 + AI2O3)  sum and an alkali content of at least 13.0%.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
Examples of additional compositions according to the invention (referred to as Ex. 6 to Ex. 40) have proved to be beneficial and are given in Table 2.<br>
All have a (Na2O + K2O) /A12O3 ratio of greater 5  than 0.5,  especially greater than 0.6,  even greater than 0.7.<br>
The alumina content is high, between 17 % and more than 25 %, with a quite high {SiO2 + AI2O3) sum, especially greater than 60 %.<br>
10	The   alcali   content   of   the   additional<br>
compositions is especially between less than 11.5 % and more than 14 %.<br>
It should be noted that their working ranges are largely positive,  especially greater than 50°C, 15  indeed greater than 100°C and even greater than 150°C.<br>
The liquidus temperatures are not very high, especially less than or equal to 1200°C and even 1150°C.<br>
The temperatures (Tlog 2.5) corresponding to viscosities 20 of 102'5 poise are compatible with the use of high-temperature fiberizing dishes, especially under the conditions of use that are described in Application WO 93/02977.<br>
The preferred compositions are especially those 25  in which Tiog 2.5 is less than 1350°C, preferably less than 1300°C.<br>
It  has  been  able  to  be  shown  that  for<br>
compositions comprising between 0 and 5% magnesia MgO,<br>
especially with at least 0.5% of MgO and/or less than<br>
30  2%, or even less than 1%, of MgO and between 10 and 13%<br>
of  alkalis,  very  satisfactory  values  of  physical<br>
properties,  especially  working  ranges  and  rate  of<br>
dissolution, are obtained (in the case of examples :<br>
Ex. 18, Ex. 31, Ex. 32, Ex. 33 and ex. 35 to Ex. 40).<br>
