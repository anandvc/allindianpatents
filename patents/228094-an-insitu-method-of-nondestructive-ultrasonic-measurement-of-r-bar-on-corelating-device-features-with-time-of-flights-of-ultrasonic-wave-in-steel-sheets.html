				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for non-destructive measurement of<br>
ultrasonic time of flight for a fixed distance in rolling direction for example 45<br>
and 90 degree to the rolling direction. The invention further relates to a method<br>
of predicting formability r bar in cold rolled and annealed steel sheets by<br>
correlating these ultrasonic parameters, sample thickness and composition of the<br>
grades of steel sheets. More particularly, the invention relates to an in-situ<br>
method of non-destructive ultrasonic measurement including co-relation of<br>
device features to accurately and quickly determine r-bar in cold rolled and<br>
annealed steel sheets.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The cold rolled and annealed steel sheets develop directionally (anisotropy)<br>
which shows change in mechanical properties like elastic modules, yield strength,<br>
ductility in different directions. Generally minimum and maximum values of these<br>
quantities occur at 0°, and around at vicinity of 45° and 90° with respect to the<br>
rolling direction. When forming a sheet metal, practical consequences of<br>
directionality, a measure of formability, include phenomena for example, excess<br>
wrinkling, puckering ear forming, local thinning or rupture, which might lead to<br>
scrapturing of the steel sheets. A more serious consequence may be the<br>
downtime required to correct the manufacturing process.<br>
The severity of directionality (a measure of formability) in conventional method is<br>
measured as plastic strain ratio defined as<br><br>
where ew is the strain ratio in the width direction and et is that in the thickness<br>
direction.<br><br>
The normal anisotropy is defined as<br><br>
The phenomenon 'anisotrophy' or r bar has been found to be a parameter to<br>
control the drawability and hence formality of the steel sheets. Usually it is<br>
measured by destructive methods of testing in which the samples need to be cut<br>
from the sheets. These methods include tensile testing and magnetostrictive<br>
oscillator technique to determine resonance frequency in a specified specimen<br>
length. r bar values can also be determined by other technique like XRD (X-ray<br>
diffraction) which is again destructive, include localized measurements, time<br>
taking and tedious.<br>
JP 57008444 (A) discloses a method to perform on-line decision of the material<br>
characteristics of a steel plate and its anisotropy during traveling by measuring<br>
the rate of propagation of elastic wave in the steel plate. Accordingly, a Y-cut<br>
crystal oscillator is used as a transverse wave transmitter. A radio receiving<br>
terminal 1 and a transmitting terminal 2 are made in one place and are so set<br>
that both are located always at a constant distance. The center C of a bar<br>
connecting both is aligned roughly to the center of the plate width on the<br>
traveling line of a steel plate P and the bar is made rotatable around the central<br>
axis C. Water nozzles 3, 4 are provided in order to acoustically couple a<br>
transmitter and a surface to be inspected as well as a receiver and the surface to<br>
be inspected. The terminals 1,2 are turned around the normal axis of the steel<br>
plate to measure the rates of propagation in the plural directions within the<br>
surface. Usually, the values in the three directions: a rolling direction, a 45 deg<br>
direction and a 90 deg. direction, are measured at constant periods of<br><br>
intermittently. The average rates of propagation of the steel plate or the average<br>
modulus of rigidity of the steel plate is calculated from the measured values of<br>
the rates of propagation in the respective directions; at the same time, the in-<br>
surface anisotropy of the material characteristics of the steel plate is evaluated<br>
from the modulus G of rigidity in the respective directions.<br>
Thus there exists a need for a method for non-destructive ultrasonic<br>
measurements to quickly determine r bar which provides larger volume for<br>
ultrasonic waves to interact with the different crystallographic planes which<br>
incorporate the directionality (a measure of formability) in the steel sheets.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to propose an in-situ method<br>
of non-destructive ultrasonic measurement including co-relation of device<br>
features to accurately and quickly determine r-bar in cold rolled and annealed<br>
steel sheets which is non-destructive and does not need to cut the sheets to<br>
prepare samples for testing.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose an in-situ method of non-<br>
destructive ultrasonic measurement including co-relation of device features to<br>
accurately and quickly determine r-bar in cold rolled and annealed steel sheets<br>
which allows larger volume of ultrasonic waves to interact with different<br>
crystallographic planes which incorporate the directionality in the steel sheets.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to propose an in-situ method of non-<br>
destructive ultrasonic measurement including co-relation of device features to<br>
accurately and quickly determine r-bar in cold rolled and annealed steel sheets<br>
which can be carried-out on the shop floor itself.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to propose an in-situ method of non-<br>
destructive ultrasonic measurement including co-relation of device features to<br>
accurately and quickly determine r-bar in cold rolled and annealed steel sheets<br>
which adapts digital ultrasonic flow director and direct contact process using two<br>
probes.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose an in-situ method of non-<br>
destructive ultrasonic measurement including co-relation of device features to<br>
accurately and quickly determine r-bar in cold rolled and annealed steel sheets<br>
which is capable to being performed online by mere use of additional instruction.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Experimental results have proved that using two surface waves probes of<br>
frequency 4MHz (one transmitter and another receiver fixed in a Perspex sheet<br>
at a fixed distance) and measuring the time of flight of ultrasonic waves from<br>
transmitter to receiver, it is possible to determine the formability r bar in cold<br>
rolled and annealed sheets within an accuracy of ± 1.69%. For this, a device<br>
feature relationship for correlating the time of flights in rolling direction (To) as<br>
well as those at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to rolling direction (T45) and<br>
(T90) respectively, including %C, %Mn, %P, % MA (microalloying elements), %<br>
AI hardness in HRB and the formability r bar, has been established. The device<br>
feature relationship leading to measurement of r bar according to the invention is<br>

0.946728*F+28.3329*G - 6.01249*H + 1.048401*1 - 0.04484*J+K)<br><br>

The time of flight are measured in micro u sec. The chemical composition is in<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
As shown in the accompanying Figures constituting graphical and schematic diagrams..<br>
The surface wave of ultrasound generally travel along the surface of a material at a<br>
depth of one wavelength from the surface. While traveling, it interacts with the detailed<br>
structure of the medium in which it travels. In cold rolled and annealed steel sheets the<br>
wave velocity changes in different directions from the rolling direction depending upon<br>
the intensity of different cryatallographic planes, which govern directionality (a measure<br>
of formability) in the steel sheets.<br>
As time of flight is directly related to the ultrasonic velocity its value in 0, 45 and 90<br>
degree from the rolling direction along with the chemistry like % C, % Mn, % P, % MA<br>
(micro-alloying elements), % Al and hardness in HRB can be correlated with the r bar.<br>
It has been observed from the correlation that decreasing % C, % Mn, % P and<br>
thickness of the test sample increases r bar value and hence the formability of the steel<br>
sheets. Increase in microalloying elements increase r bar value and decrease in Tbar<br>
which indicates an increase in r bar.<br>
Such device feature relationship can be used for non-destructive prediction of r bar in<br>
cold rolled and annealed steel on the shop floor.<br><br>
