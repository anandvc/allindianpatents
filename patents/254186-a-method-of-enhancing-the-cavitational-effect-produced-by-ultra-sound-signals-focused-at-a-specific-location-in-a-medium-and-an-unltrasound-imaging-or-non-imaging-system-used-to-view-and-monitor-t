Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the field of ultrasound technology. Specifically the invention relates to a system for creating ultrasound waves<br>
and focusing them at a location in a medium and to methods for enhancing<br>
the resultant cavitational effects that take place in the focal region.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of ultrasound for medical diagnostics and therapy is well known.<br>
Diagnostic techniques are based on the production and transmission of<br>
ultrasound waves into the body, and detection of the scattered echoes from<br>
the scanned region. Therapeutic methods are generally based on the use of<br>
focused beams of ultrasonic energy to produce high-powered mechanical<br>
energy for disintegration of medical targets by heat and ablation or<br>
cavitation caused by pressure waves. In body fluids such as blood or in the<br>
intercellular fluids in living tissue, the application of ultrasonic energy often<br>
leads to the creation of bubbles which grow in volume by a process known as<br>
rectified diffusion and eventually implode releasing large amounts of energy<br>
and generating sites of locally high temperature and pressure for very short<br>
periods of time.<br><br>
In industry cavitational effects are used for a wide variety of applications<br>
from cleaning of objects to initiating chemical reactions.<br>
Conventional ultrasound signals are generated by transducers powered by a<br>
sinusoidal waveform such as that shown in Fig. 1. The horizontal axis<br>
represents time measured in Âµsec and the vertical axis the voltage applied<br>
to the transducer. When the applied electrical signal is in the frequency<br>
range of the transducer's frequency bandwidth and the signal is at least a<br>
few cycles long, the pressure wave generated by the transducer is of similar<br>
shape. The waves that are emitted from the transducer travel through the<br>
media as longitudinal waves (the transverse waves usually attenuate very<br>
rapidly in tissue and thus are ignored herein) having alternating<br>
compression and de-compression regions corresponding to the positive and<br>
negative portions of the waveform shown in Fig. 1. When the wave passes<br>
through a fluid, gases trapped inside dust motes or other particles in the<br>
fluid, or on the walls of the region containing the fluid will be drawn out<br>
from the fluid forming a small bubble. If the acoustic power density is small,<br>
then the bubble will oscillate around a relatively constant radius. This<br>
process is known as stable cavitation. If the power density is high, then gas<br>
diffuses into the bubble during the de-compression half-cycle of the sound<br>
waves and diffuses out from the bubble during the compression half-cycle.<br>
The rate of diffusion is proportional to the radius of the bubble and therefore<br><br>
the rate of diffusion into the bubble (which occurs when the bubble has<br>
expanded during the de-compression phase) exceeds that of the rate of<br>
diffusion out of the bubble (which occurs when the bubble has been<br>
compressed). The net result is that the radius of the bubble increases as the<br>
bubble oscillates. This process is known as rectified diffusion. Once the<br>
bubble's radius reaches a critical value, which depends on the power and<br>
frequency of the ultrasonic energy, it can no longer remain stable and the<br>
pressure caused by the next compression half-cycle will cause the bubble to<br>
implode, i.e. the fluids in the vicinity of the bubble oscillate with such an amplitude that the bubble breaks into small fractions.<br>
In medical applications the energy released by the implosion of the bubbles<br>
in the rectified diffusion process is used to destroy near by cells. Various<br>
methods are known to produce cavitation at the desired location. For<br>
example, US 5,219,401 teaches the use of relatively low power ultrasound<br>
energy to produce stable cavitation resulting in a population of bubbles at a<br>
site and then applying a second signal at another frequency and higher<br>
power to cause the bubbles to implode. US 6,413,216 teaches the use of an<br>
unfocused transducer operating at a low frequency to create bubbles in a<br>
treatment area of a patient followed by the use of a focused ultrasound beam<br>
at a different frequency aimed at a specific region within the treatment area<br>
in order to cause cavitation and thereby create a lesion at a desired location.<br>
US 5,827,204 teaches a method reported to produce large vaporous<br><br>
cavitation bubbles in a small confined area. The method comprises<br>
generating a low frequency signal having amplitude less than the cavitation<br>
threshold to produce a population of bubbles and superimposing on this<br>
signal a high frequency signal. The amplitude of the resulting modulated<br>
signal exceeds the cavitation threshold at the focus of the modulated beam.<br>
The aim of the art is to increase the magnitude of the cavitational effect<br>
while at the same time carefully controlling the region in which cavitation<br>
takes place in order to allow more precise therapeutic treatment while .<br>
preventing unintended damage to surrounding cells<br>
In recent years it has been shown that sonochemically active cavitation can<br>
be enhanced an order of magnitude by superimposing the second harmonic<br>
onto the fundamental in insonation [S. Umemara, K. Kawabata, and K.<br>
Saski: "Enhancement of Sonodynamic Tissue Damage Production by<br>
Second-Harmonic Superimposition: Theoretical Analysis of its Mechanism",<br>
IEEE Transactions on Ultrasonics, Ferroelectricss and Frequency Control,<br>
43 (1996) 1054-1062]; and [S. Umemara, K Kawabata, and K. Saski: "In<br>
vitro and in vivo enhancement of sonodynamically active cavitation by<br>
second-harmonic superimposition" J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 101 (1997) 569-577.]<br>
In another study it has been shown that combined irradiation with two or<br>
more orthogonal beams, of different ultrasound frequencies focused at a<br>
common location produces a significant increase in cavitation effects over<br>
single frequency irradiation. [Ruo Feng, Yiyun Zhao, Changping Zhu, T.J.<br><br>
Mason: "Enhancement of ultrasonic cavitation yield by multi-frequency<br>
sonification", Ultrasonics Soinochemistry 9 (2002) 231-236.]<br>
It is a purpose of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method<br>
for providing focused ultrasonic waves having a waveform at the focal point<br>
that is modified to cause enhanced cavitation.<br>
Further purposes and advantages of this invention will appear as the<br>
description proceeds.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention is a method of enhancing the cavitational effect produced by-<br>
ultrasound signals focused at a specific location in a medium. The method of<br>
the invention comprises two steps:<br>
(a) using one or more transducers to apply the ultrasound signals to<br>
create a waveform that causes formation of bubbles at the location;<br>
and<br>
(b) modulating the amplitude of said ultrasound signals at a frequency between 5 KHz and<br>
25 KHz immediately following or coincident with the formation of said bubbles such<br>
that the waveform causing the production of bubbles is a waveform comprising<br>
negative peaks and positive peaks, wherein the negative peaks are greater in absolute<br>
value than the positive peaks.<br>
According to the method of the invention, the	â'		<br>
	~ modulation can be carried out <br><br>
either by combining of two or more interfering primary beams emitted from<br>
two or more transducers having a common focus or by exciting individual<br>
transducers by an excitation pulse composed of two excitation pulses with<br>
closely proximate frequencies.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, if the<br>
number of transducers is more than one, then the different frequencies<br>
emitted by the transducers are integral multiples of the lowest of the<br>
frequencies. In an embodiment three transducers are used to carry out the<br>
invention.<br>
The radius of the microbubbles is typically in the range from a fraction of a<br>
micron up to 100 or more microns, preferably from approximately 3 microns<br>
to 5 microns.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, an ultrasound imaging or non<br>
imaging system is used to view and monitor the region being targeted, to<br>
monitor the generation of the microbubbles at the desired location, and<br>
control the system for one or more of the following purposes:<br><br>
(a)	for aiming the focused beam to enable generating the microbubbles at<br>
the targeted location;<br>
(b)	to insure that the number of microbubbles is as planned;<br>
(c)	to re-align the beam to a different location; and<br>
(d)to monitor the formation, maintenance, or implosion of the<br>
microbubbles for the purpose of controlling either continuously or<br>
intermittently the application of the waveform and/or the modulation<br>
signals that causes these processes in order to achieve the planned<br>
result.<br>
The response at the half harmonic or at higher harmonics of the transmitted<br>
frequencies can be used by the ultrasound imaging or non-imaging system<br>
to measure the number of microbubbles generated within the targeted<br>
region and their spatial distribution.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention the multiple transducers are<br>
arranged as an array, designed so that their mechanical focus and their own<br>
focus combine at the same point in space. In one preferred embodiment, the<br>
array is an annular array. Preferably the ultrasonic waves transmitted by<br>
the different transducers are designed to produce in the microbubbles at the<br>
focal point interference that generates specific waveforms at specific<br>
frequencies and amplitudes, which are not produced at other locations and<br>
the focal point can be moved axially or laterally by either shifting the whole<br><br>
array, by repositioning of individual transducers, or by phase shift of the<br>
excitation pulse. In preferred embodiments of the invention, the region<br>
within the focal zone of all the transducers in which the specific waveform<br>
develops at significant intensities and the amplitudes of the waveforms are<br>
less than -3 DB of the maximum amplitude, are typically at distances less<br>
than 25mm and preferably less than 1 mm away from the point of the<br>
maximum amplitude in the lateral directions and less than 10mm and<br>
preferably less than 1.5 mm away in the axial directions.<br>
The method of the invention for the localized production of bubbles at a<br>
location and the enhancement of the cavitational and implosion effects that<br>
take place at that location can be used for therapeutic purposes. For this use<br>
the one or more transducers, are placed extra-corporally, in close proximity<br>
to the organ to be treated, with a spacer made of ultrasound-transparent<br>
material, ultrasound gel, or water surrounding the ultrasound transducer/s<br>
and filling the space between it and the surface of the body overlying the<br>
organ.<br>
All the above and other characteristics and advantages of the invention will<br>
be further understood through the following illustrative and non-limitative<br>
description of preferred embodiments thereof, with reference to the<br>
appended drawings.<br><br><br>

Detailed Description of Preferred Embodiments<br>
The enhanced cavitational effects, i.e. improving microbubble generation,<br>
oscillation, changes in bubble size, and implosion, achieved by use of the<br><br>
present invention are the result of applying a relatively low frequency<br>
waveform to the region of interest. The theoretical and practical difficulty<br>
that must be overcome is to focus the waveform to a sufficiently small<br>
region, for example in human veins or in tissue underlying the skin, in order<br>
to obtain useful therapeutic results. The invention solves this problem by<br>
using a two-step approach. In the first step, ultrasonic energy, from one or<br>
more transducers, is focused at the region of interest and bubbles are<br>
formed. In the second step, which follows immediately after or coincident<br>
with the formation of the bubbles, ultrasonic signals are applied, which are<br>
so designed so as to produce modulated amplitude at a relatively low<br>
frequency of several Hz to several tens of kilohertz, thereby providing the<br>
desired low frequency waveform, which is confined to the non-linear region<br>
created by the bubbles formed in the first step. In the presently preferred .<br>
embodiments of the invention, frequency of the modulation is between 5kHz<br>
and 25kHz.<br>
The low frequency waveform can be produced either by combination of two<br>
or more interfering primary beams emitted from two or more transducers<br>
having a common focus or alternatively from individual transducers excited<br>
by an excitation pulse composed of two excitation pulses with closely<br>
proximate frequencies.<br><br>
The first step of the method of the invention is carried out using one or more<br>
energy transducers, each operating at a different frequency, which is<br>
typically in the range of several hundreds of KHz. In order to take<br>
advantage of the enhanced effects noted in the prior art, at least two<br>
transducers should be used and their frequencies should be related such<br>
that they are harmonics of each other.<br>
In the first method of producing the waveform for the second step of the<br>
invention, at least two transducers are used where one frequency is supplied<br>
to one transducer, e.g. 1.00MHz, and a frequency different by several Hz to<br>
several tens of KHz is supplied to the second transducer, e.g. 1.01MHz.<br>
This produces at the target location, i.e., where bubbles have been formed<br>
during the first step of the method of the invention, pressure fields at<br>
relatively low frequencies that are typically on the order of several Hz to<br>
several tens of KHz, e.g. 10kHz.<br>
In the second method of producing the waveform, the relatively low<br>
frequencies are also produced only at the location of treatment, i.e. where<br>
microbubbles have been generated during the first step. As an example of<br>
the second method, one frequency supplied to the transducer could be 1MHz<br>
and the second frequency 1.01MHz. This produces an ultrasonic wave<br>
having a frequency of approximately 1MHz, with a varying phase and with<br>
an amplitude modulation of 10 khz. This waveform is shown in Fig. 2. Due to<br><br>
the highly nonlinear behavior of the bubbles generated in the first step of<br>
the method of the invention, a "detection" phenomenon takes place in the<br>
focal region and in the region occupied by the bubbles, which is exposed to<br>
ultrasonic waves of 1.0MHz and 1.01MHZ, there is generated ultrasonic<br>
waves of ~10 KHz and ~2.0lMHz. This results in non-linear enhancement of<br>
the cavitational effect; i.e. the cavitational effect of the resultant sonication<br>
at the relatively low frequencies is larger than the algebraic sum of the<br>
effects of each component at the relatively high frequencies (e.g. 1.0MHz,<br>
1.01MHz, 2.01MHz and their harmonics).<br>
Co-pending International Patent Application PCT/IL2005/000128 by the<br>
same inventor, the description of which, including reference cited therein, is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety, describes a system and<br>
method for using ultrasound waves that are focused at a specific location in<br>
a medium to cause localized production of bubbles at that location and to<br>
control the production, and the cavitational and heating effects that take<br>
place there. Much of the apparatus and methods described in this<br>
application can be usefully adapted to carry out the present invention.<br>
To produce the waveforms in PCT/IL2005/000128, at least three<br>
independent high-power focused ultrasound transducers are used, housed<br>
within a structure that produces' a common focus. Each transducer is<br>
powered by its own amplifier, which is driven by a signal generator, usually<br><br>
tuned to a different frequency. Optionally the system for producing the<br>
waveforms may also include a control system that measures the changes in<br>
tissue or the size of the bubbles and accordingly adjusts the waveform.<br>
One embodiment of the control and driving system that can also be used for<br>
carrying out the present invention is shown schematically in Fig. 3. In this<br>
embodiment, the control and driving system 200 includes three arbitrary<br>
waveform signal generators 202 connected to three wide-band power<br>
amplifiers 204 and, through impedance matching, to the three transducers<br>
206. At least one workstation 208, for example a personal computer (PC),<br>
controls the timing of activation and amplitude of each arbitrary waveform<br>
signal generator 202 by means of different protocols and separate cables for<br>
each signal generator. The workstation 208 may also control a temperature<br>
measurement system 210 that measures and records temperatures, for<br>
example with thermocouples. Additionally or alternatively, an ultrasound<br>
imaging or non-imaging system 212 may be used to view and monitor the<br>
region being treated (targeted) to monitor the generation of the<br>
microbubbles at the desired location and control the system so that the<br>
number of microbubbles will be as planned and/or may be used for aiming<br>
the focused beam to the targeted region and/or to re-align the beam to a<br>
different location. The cavitation effects can be detected by many different<br>
techniques that are known to skilled persons. For example: use of a single<br>
transducer operating at 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc. of the frequency of one of the<br><br>
transducers in the array as a detector; use of a single transducer operating<br>
at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, etc. harmonic; use of a "white noise" detector; use of a pair of<br>
transducers working continuously as a transmitter-receiver pair; or use of a<br>
single transducer, that both transmits and receives the reflected signal. The<br>
ultrasound system monitoring system 212 may be controlled by the<br>
workstation 208 to which it is connected through control box 214.<br>
Control and driving system 200 is comprised of standard components that<br>
are well known to persons familiar with the use of ultrasound for diagnostic<br>
or therapeutic purposes. Typical but non-limitative examples of<br>
commercially available components that are suitable for use in control and<br>
driving system 200 are: arbitrary waveform signal generator 202 - Tabor<br>
Electronics Ltd., model 8025; wide-band 10kHz-100MHz power amplifier<br>
204 - Acoustic Research, model 150A100B; transducer 206 - Imasonic,<br>
model no. T3035A101, T3034A101, T2336A101; workstation 208 - HP-<br>
Compaq PC; temperature measurement system 210 - Omega<br>
thermocouples, model no. TGC150-CPSS-150-SMP-MUK270502, National<br>
Instruments Temperature measurement board model no. NI-4351,<br>
Temperature I/O box model no. TC-2190, and National Labview software;<br>
ultrasound imaging system 212 - GE Healthcare model VIVID III; and<br>
control box 214 - HP-Compaq PC running National Instruments Labview<br>
software, National Instruments I/O box, model no.BNC-2090, and National<br>
Instruments DAQ board model no. PC-LPM-16.<br><br>
The power transducers 206 are arranged as an array, designed so that their<br>
mechanical focus and their own focus combine at the same point in space.<br>
This point in space can be moved by either shifting the whole array, by<br>
repositioning of individual transducers, or by phase shift of the excitation<br>
pulse. The ultrasonic waves transmitted by the different transducers are<br>
designed to produce by interference specific waveforms at the focal point,<br>
which are not produced at other locations. The region in which the specific<br>
waveforms develop at significant intensities, i.e. within the focal zone of all<br>
transducers, is usually very small, where the amplitudes of â3 DB and less<br>
of the maximum, are typically less than 1 mm away from the point of<br>
maximum in the lateral directions and, less than 1.5 mm away in the axial<br>
directions.<br>
An embodiment of an array of transducers 300 that uses cylindrical power<br>
transducers suitable for use in the invention is shown in Fig. 4A and Fig.<br>
4B. Another embodiment, using annular transducers is described with<br>
reference to Fig. 5A to 5D hereinbelow. Fig. 4A is a photograph showing the<br>
array 300 from the top. Array 300 is mounted in a cylindrically shaped<br>
holder 306 made of plexiglass or other suitable material. In the embodiment<br>
shown, holder 306 comprises a central bore 304 coaxial with the symmetry<br>
axis of holder 306 and six other bores 302 arranged symmetrically around<br>
bore 304 and inclined at an angle with the symmetry axis. Array of<br><br>
transducers 300 can thereby comprise up to six cylindrical power<br>
transducers 206 which are inserted into bores 302 such that all are<br>
physically aimed at the same focal point. The focal point of the array of<br>
ultrasound transducers 300 depends, upon other factors on the medium<br>
through which the ultrasound waves will be transmitted. A typical focal<br>
distance in water for array 300 is six cm from the bottom face of transducer<br>
holder 306. This focal distance is equivalent to five cm in gel and four cm in<br>
liver tissue. The center bore 304 can be used for an imaging probe connected<br>
to an imaging system 212 or for inserting thermocouples that are<br>
components of temperature measurement system 210. Fig. 3B schematically<br>
shows the arrangement of the bores 302 and 304 on the planar bottom face<br>
of holder 306.<br>
The holder 306 is designed such that array 300 can be placed extra-<br>
corporally, in close proximity to the organ to be treated, with ultrasound-<br>
transparent material, ultrasound gel, or water surrounding the ultrasound<br>
transducers and filling the space between it and the organ.<br>
As mentioned hereinabove, ultrasound system 200 may be either imaging or<br>
non-imaging and in the preferred embodiment of the invention is used to<br>
measure the number of microbubbles, their location in space, and their<br>
spatial population distribution. These measurements can be made during<br>
any phase of the process, for example when bubbles are generated during<br><br>
the cavitation phase, during a heating phase, a phase when it is desired to<br>
reduce or enlarge the size and/or number of microbubbles, or during<br>
microbubble destruction usually by implosion.<br>
The goals of the invention are achieved by selecting the range of<br>
parameters, including frequency, phase, and amplitude, of each one of the<br>
multiple transducers to produce the desired waveform in the region of<br>
interest. Bubbles having a size ranging from a fraction of a micron up to 100<br>
or more microns can be produced using the system described herein. The<br>
presently preferred range for the bubble size for therapeutic use is between<br>
approximately 3 to 5 microns. Similarly the size of the focal area can be<br>
varied between spots that are typically less than 25mm radius, and<br>
preferably less than 1 mm, radius in the lateral directions and less than<br>
10mm, and preferably less than 1.5 mm, long in the axial directions. The<br>
ability to achieve such a small focal zone length in the axial direction by<br>
using the method and apparatus of the invention provides a significant<br>
improvement in the ability to provide localized treatment for various<br>
conditions over the prior art methods in which the focal zone length<br>
typically ranges between 10mm and 20mm. The minimum size of the<br>
treatment area is on the order of the minimum size of the focal area and, by<br>
means of electrically or mechanically scanning the combined beams and/or<br>
the array of transducers, the maximum size of the treatment area is<br>
unlimited.<br><br>
Fig. 6 shows a waveform comprising high negative peaks and small positive<br>
peaks. This type of waveform, by increasing the ratio of the amplitudes of<br>
the de-compression part of the acoustic wave to the compression part,<br>
encourages the creation of a cloud of microbubbles. This type of waveform is<br>
most effective for carrying out the first step in the method of the current<br>
invention. In Fig. 6, the horizontal axis represents time measured in Âµsec<br>
and the vertical axis the amplitude of the signal at the focus measured in<br>
volts. The signal shown in Fig. 6 was generated, using the system shown in<br>
Fig. 3 and the array shown in Fig. 4A comprising three transducers, by a<br>
hydrophone that converts accurately the acoustic pressure at that point to<br>
volts. The control and driving system operated at the frequencies, phases,<br>
and amplitudes shown in Table 1 in order to produce the waveform shown in<br>
Fig. 5.<br><br><br>
Another embodiment of a transducer array that can be used to carry out the<br>
method of the invention is shown in Figs. 5A to 5D. Fig. 5A is a side view<br>
and Fig. 5B a perspective view showing the features of the outside of<br>
cylindrical holder 908 of array 900. Shown in these figures are three<br>
connectors 910 for the power cables to the three transducers and three<br>
connectors 912 for thermocouples. The thermocouples in array 900 are<br>
placed on the rear sides of each of the transducers to monitor their<br>
performance during the development stage of the array. They are not<br>
necessary features of a commercial array. Also shown on the top of holder<br>
908 is air inlet 914 and air outlets 916, which are provided to pass air over<br>
the backs of the transducers and remove heat from the inside of holder 908.<br>
As opposed to the array 300 shown in Figs. 4A and 4B, which comprises<br>
cylindrical transducers 206, the array 900 is comprised of three annular<br>
transducers 902, 904, and 906. The three transducers are arranged such<br>
that their front faces form a spherical shaped active area 918, which focuses<br>
the energy from all of the transducers at the same point below the bottom of<br>
the holder. The common focal point (f in Fig. 5C) is located on the vertical<br>
symmetry axis of holder 908 and is the center of curvature of spherical<br>
active area 918.<br>
Fig. 5C is a cross-sectional view showing the arrangement of the three<br>
transducers. Lines a, b, and c are respectively the bottom edges of<br><br>
transducers 902, 904, and 906. The bottom of transducer 902 and the inner<br>
side surfaces of transducers 904 and 906 define the spherical active surface<br>
918. Line c also represents the bottom edge of holder 908 and therefore the<br>
"skin plane", when the array is placed on a patient's body during a<br>
therapeutic procedure. The distance from the skin plane to the focus f is<br>
designated by the letter d. Fig. 5D is a view from the bottom of the array<br>
showing the location of transducers 902, 904, and 906 on the active surface<br>
918.<br>
An illustrative, but nor limitative, example of the dimensions of an array<br>
900 designed for therapeutic treatment is: height and diameter of holder<br>
908 are 65mm and 88mm respectively; radius of curvature of the spherical<br>
active surface 918 is 45mm; and distance d is 27mm. The frequencies of the<br>
transducers in the array are 350KHZ, 700KHZ, and 1050KHZ. It is to be<br>
noted that the ratio of these frequencies is 1:2:3. This is different from the<br>
ratio 1:2:4 of array 300, which was described hereinabove. This illustrates<br>
that the invention is not limited to any particular frequencies or for that<br>
matter to using three transducers; however, in order to enhance the<br>
cavitation results, it is important that if more than one transducer and/or<br>
frequency is used then the different frequencies emitted by the transducers<br>
should preferably be integral multiples of the lowest frequency. The main<br>
consideration in choosing the number, frequencies, and other parameters of<br>
the transducers and other components of the system is the waveform of the<br><br>
signal that is to be produced by the array in order to achieve the intended<br>
results.<br>
The method of the invention for enhancing cavitation effects at a specific<br>
location in a medium is carried out using an ultrasonic energy generator<br>
system such as 200 in Fig. 3 in the following manner:<br>
(a)	A generator of ultrasonic waves is placed on the outer surface of the<br>
medium and directed towards the specific location. The generator can<br>
comprise dual track transducers or an array of two or more<br>
transducers such as those described hereinabove.<br>
(b)	Ultrasonic energy is applied to the transducer/s to produce a<br>
waveform that generates gas bubbles at the focal point by rectified<br>
diffusion. The process of bubble formation can be further enhanced by<br>
using two or more frequencies that are harmonics of each other. The<br>
size of the focal area can be more accurately controlled by using three<br>
or more transducers to produce the waveform shown in Fig. 6 than if<br>
the sinusoidal waveform shown in Fig. 1 is used.<br>
(c)	Immediately following, or coincident with the formation of the<br>
bubbles, the amplitude of the elements is modulated at a relatively<br>
low frequency (e.g. 5kHz â 25 kHz).<br>
Step (c) can be carried out in one of the following two ways:<br><br>
(i) by applying a waveform having two close frequencies to each pair of<br>
transducers, e.g. for an array of four transducers, the transducers<br>
could be operated at 0.5MHz, 0.51Mhz, 1.0MHz, and 1.01MHz<br>
respectively;<br>
(ii) by driving each transducer with a signal comprised of proximate<br>
frequencies, e.g. for the annular array described hereinabove, the<br>
three transducers could be operated at 350KHZ and 360KHz,<br>
700KHZ and 710KHz, and 1050KHZ and 1060KHz respectively.<br>
The method can be carried out with several variations. For example:<br>
-	Steps (b) and (c) can be carried out sequentially.<br>
-	Step (c) can be initiated after bubble formation however step (b) does<br>
not cease when step (c) begins and then the two steps are carried out<br>
simultaneously. This mode of performing the invention can be carried<br>
out by using a different transducer or array to provide the signals<br>
needed for each of the two steps or by using a single array in which<br>
the signals from at least some of the transducers are alternated<br>
between the different waveforms.<br>
-	The signals can be applied sequentially but cyclically; i.e. step (b)<br>
(bubble formation) followed by step (c), which is carried out until a<br>
decline in activity is observed, followed by step (b), which produces a<br>
sufficient quantity of bubbles to make step (c) effective, followed by<br>
step (c), etc.<br><br>
An ultrasound imaging or non-imaging system can be used to view and<br>
monitor the region being targeted, to monitor the generation of the<br>
microbubbles at the desired location, and to control the system, either<br>
manually or automatically, for one or more of the following purposes:<br>
(a)	for aiming the focused beam to enable generating the microbubbles at<br>
the targeted location;<br>
(b)	to insure that the number of microbubbles is as planned;<br>
(e) to re-align the beam to a different location; and<br>
(d) to monitor the formation, maintenance, or implosion of the<br>
microbubbles for the purpose of controlling either continuously or<br>
intermittently the application of the waveform and/or the modulation<br>
signals that causes these processes in order to achieve the planned<br>
result.<br>
The method of the invention is especially well suited for therapeutic<br>
purposes. For such uses, the one or more transducers are placed extra-<br>
corporally, in close proximity to the organ to be treated, with a spacer made<br>
of ultrasound-transparent material, ultrasound gel, or water surrounding<br>
the ultrasound transducer/s and filling the space between it and the surface<br>
of the body overlying the organ.<br><br>
Experiments<br>
Experiments have been carried out in order to demonstrate the two-step<br>
method of the invention. The following examples are provided merely to<br>
illustrate the invention and are not intended to limit the scope of the<br>
invention in any manner.<br>
Experiment 1<br>
An experiment was done in water, using a special latex tube mimicking a<br>
vein. The energy produced by three transducers arranged in an annular<br>
array as shown in Figs 5A to 5D and operating at 350kHz, 700kHz, and<br>
1050kHz was focused in the water within the tube and bubbles were<br>
produced as shown in Fig. 7A. Following the step of bubble production, the<br>
transmission of the two higher frequency transducers was stopped and the<br>
350kHz transducer was driven at 350kHz and 360kHz. The enhanced<br>
cavitation effects produced in this step can be observed in Fig. 7B. The<br>
images in Figs, 7A and 7B were acquired by a Vivid HI imaging system with<br>
a 7L Linear array.<br>
Experiment 2<br>
Figs. 8A, 8B, 9A, and 9B are power spectrum of echoes obtained by<br>
hydrophone from a sample of fat insonated by the array of transducers used<br>
in Experiment 1. In each of these figures the vertical axis represents the<br><br>
power and the horizontal axis the frequency. The upper curve is the "raw"<br>
data and the lower curve shows the results after filtering and normalization.<br>
Figs. 8A and 8B show the results for the first step of the method. In this<br>
step, the three transducers were operated at frequencies of 350kHz,<br>
700kHz, and 1050kHz respectively (at different power levels). The signals<br>
were applied in a cyclic manner for 3.2msec ON, 36msec OFF, 3.2msec ON,<br>
etc. Fig. 8A shows the power spectrum recorded after 1sec and Fig. 8B after<br>
2sec. The presence of microbubbles in the sample is detected by the<br>
appearance of energy peaks corresponding to the half harmonics of the<br>
primary frequencies. The presence of the line at 175kHz in Fig. 8B clearly<br>
establishes that a significant population of microbubbles has been created in<br>
the sample after 2sec.<br>
Figs. 9A and 9B show the results for the second step of the method. In this<br>
step, one of the transducers was operated at frequencies of 350kHz and<br>
360kHz and the other two transducers were "shut down". The signals were<br>
applied in a cyclic manner for 6.4msec ON, 75msec OFF, 6.4msec ON, etc.<br>
Fig. 8A shows the power spectrum recorded after 2sec and Fig. 8B after<br>
5sec. Observing the changes in the strength of line at 175kHz, it can be seen<br>
that the waveform applied in this step caused enhancement of the cavitation<br>
and implosion of the microbubbles in the fat, until the population of<br><br>
microbubbles that were created in step 1, virtually disappeared after 5sec of<br>
step 2.<br>
Although embodiments of the invention have been described by way of<br>
illustration, it will be understood that the invention may be carried out with<br>
many variations, modifications, and adaptations, without departing from its<br>
