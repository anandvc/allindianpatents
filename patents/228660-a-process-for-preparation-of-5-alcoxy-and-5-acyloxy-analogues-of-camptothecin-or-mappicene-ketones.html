				<td>PROCESS FOR THE DIRECT PREPARATION OF 5-ALKOXY AND 5-ACYLOXY<br>
ANALOGUES OF CAMPTHOTHECINS OR MAPPICENE KETONES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for direct preparation of 5-alkoxy<br>
and 5-acyloxy analogues of camptothecins or mappicine ketones.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Camptothecin (I) is a naturally occurring pyrrolo (3,4-b)-quinoline alkaloid<br>
having remarkable antitumour and antileukemic activities (Wall et. al.,<br>
J.Am.Chem.Soc. 88, 3888, 1966). It acts as an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I<br>
(Hsiang et al., J.Biol.Chem., 260, 14873, 1985). Two natural analogues of the<br>
compound, 9-methoxy camptothecin (II) (Govindachari and Viswanathan,<br>
Phytochemistry, 11, 3529, 1972; Wu et al., Phytochemistry, 39, 383, 1995) and 20-Oacetyl<br>
camptothecin (III) (Wu et al., Phytochemistry, 39, 383, 1995; Das et al., Indian<br>
J.Chem, 36B, 207, 1997) also possess significant cytotoxic property. The<br>
decarboxylated E-ring analogues of camptothecin (I) and 9-methoxycamptothecir^<br>
(II), known as mappicine ketone (nothapodytine B) (IV) and 9-methoxymappicine<br>
ketone ( nothapodytine A) (V) respectively are also naturally occurring alkaloids (Wu<br>
et al., Phytochemistry, 42, 907, 1996; Pendrak et al., J.Org.Chem, 59, 2623, 1994).<br>
Mappicine ketone (IV) has recently been identified as an antiviral lead (Pendrak et al.,<br>
J.Org.Chem., 59, 2623, 1994; J.Org.Chem. 60, 2912, 1995).<br>
As a drug camptothecin (I) itself has several problems including its high<br>
toxicity and low water solubility. So several analogues of the compound have been<br>
prepared to evaluate their clinical efficacies. Recently different 5-substituted<br>
alkoxycamptothecins have been found to exhibit potent anticancer activity<br>
(Subrahmanyam et.al., Bioorg.Med,Chem.Lett., 10, 369, 2000). The methods of<br>
preparation of 5-alkoxy camptothecins are limited. They were prepared earlier from 5-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin which was obtained by treatment of camptothecin with \i and<br>
K2CO3 in DMF. 5-Hydroxycamptothecin was subsequently converted into 5-<br>
alkoxycamptothecins by reacting with alcohols in the presence of BF3.OEt2 ( Swada et<br>
al., Chem.Pharm Bull, 39,2574,1991). This is a two-step process and so the overall<br>
yields of 5-alkoxycamptothecins will be diminished. The experimental procedures are<br>
also tidious. In the other approach camptothecin was heated with FeCb-fySCU in<br>
EtOH for 20 hr to obtain a mixture of 5-er and 5-hydroxycamptothecins. The<br>
mixture was again heated with aqueous HC1 for 20 hr to obtain 5-<br>
hydroxycamptothecin exclusively. This 5-hydroxycamptothecin was then treated with<br>
different alcohols in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid to prepare 5-<br>
alkoxycamptothecins (Subrahmanyam et al., Biorg.Med.Chem.Lett., 10, 369, 2000).<br>
This method involves several steps and the time required is high.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a convenient and facile process for the direct<br>
preparation of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of campthothecins and mappicene ketones.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a process for direct preparation<br>
of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of campthothecins and mappicene ketones in<br>
high yield.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a process for direct<br>
preparation of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of campthothecins and mappicene<br>
ketones which is simple and non-hazardous.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the direct preparation<br>
of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of campthothecins or mappicene ketones<br>
comprising reacting campthothecin or mappicene ketone dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent or an acid with eerie ammonium nitrate in an organic solvent at a temperature<br>
in the range of 20 to 30Â°C for a period in the range of 2 to 10 hours, concentrating the<br>
reaction mixture and adding water to the concentrate followed by extraction with<br>
ethyl acetate to obtain the desired product.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the campthothecin is selected from the<br>
group consisting of campthothecin (I), 9-methyl campthothecin (II) and 20-O-acetyl<br>
campthothecin (III).<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the mappicene ketone used<br>
comprises 9-methoxymappicene ketone.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the organic solvent used for the<br>
campthothecin solution is selected from the group consisting of dichloromethane,<br>
chloroform, tetrahydrofuran and any mixture thereof.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, the organic acid used for the<br>
campthothecin solution is selected from acetic acid, propanoic acid and benzoic acid.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the organic solvent used for the eerie<br>
ammonium nitrate solution is selected from the group consisting of methanol,<br>
propanol, isopropanol and ethanol.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the analogues obtained comprise<br>
the group of 5-methoxy campthothecin, 5-isopropoxy campthothecin, 5-ethoxy-9-<br>
methoxy campthothecin, 5-methoxy mappicene ketone, 5-ethoxy-9-methoxy<br>
mappicene ketone, 5-acetoxy campthothecin, 5-acetoxy-9-methoxy campthothecin,<br>
5-propionoxy-20-O-acetylcampthothecin, 5-benzoyloxymappiccne ketone and 5-<br>
acetoxy-9- methoxymappicene ketone.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The present investigation has led to the development of a convenient and<br>
facile method for direct preparation of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of<br>
campthothecins and mappicine ketones. Camptothecin (I), 9-methoxycamptothecin<br>
(II) and 20-O-acetylcamptothecin (III) as well as mappicine ketone (IV) and 9-<br>
methoxymappicine ketone (V) were isolated from the stems of Indian Nothapodytes<br>
foetida. Camptothecins and mappicine ketones on treatment with alcohols in the<br>
presence of eerie ammonium nitrate (CAN) at room temperature for 2 hr afforded 5-<br>
alkoxy compounds in very high yields (72-86%). Both primary and secondary<br>
alcohols were used. 5-Alkoxycamptothecins were found (from their 'H NMR spectra)<br>
to be mixtures (1:1) of both the diastereoisomers with 20-(S), 5- (S) and 20-(S), 5-(R)<br>
configurations.<br>
The mixtures were not further separated since anticancer activity was reported<br>
earlier on the mixtures (Subrahmanyam et.al., Bioorg.Med.Chem.Lett, 10, 369, 2000).<br>
However, for mappicine ketones each 5-alkoxy analogue was obtained as a racemic<br>
compound. During the present study several 5-acyloxy analogues of camptothecins<br>
and mappicine ketones have also been prepared.<br>
Previously some 5-acyloxycamptothecins were prepared in two steps from<br>
camptothecins via their 5-hydroxy derivatives (Swada et al., Chem.Pharm Bull., 39,<br>
2574, 1991). It is observed that when camptothecins were treated with acids (both<br>
aliphatic and aromatic) in the presence of CAN at room temperature for 8 hr 5-<br>
acyloxycamptothecins were obtained (as 1:1 diastereoisomeric mixtures). Hydroxy<br>
group at C-20 remained unaffected. Mappicine ketones also underwent similar<br>
conversion within 6 hr into 5-acyloxy analogues when treated with acids in the<br>
presence of CAN. The yields of the 5-acyloxycamptothecins and mappicine ketones<br>
were very high (71-82%).<br>
The present procedure for the preparation of useful 5-substituted alkoxy and<br>
acyloxy derivatives of camptothecins and mappicine ketones is very simple and<br>
efficient. The conversion is completed within a short period of time. The reaction<br>
proceeds at room temperature and not involves any hazardous and costly reagent. The<br>
yields of the products are very high. Thus the process of the invention is useful and<br>
practical for the preparation of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of camptothecins<br>
and mappicine ketones. All the analogues of mappicine ketones are new compounds.<br>
The time taken for obtaining the products is about 2 hours for 5-alkoxy<br>
compounds and 6-8 hours for 5-acyloxy compounds. Another significant advantage of<br>
the invention is that the yields of the products are high (72-86% for. 5-alkoxy<br>
compounds and 71-82% for 5-acyloxy compounds). In addition, the solvents used for<br>
extraction can be recovered rendering the process more economic. A process as<br>
claimed in Claims 1-6 wherein a library of 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxycamptothecins and<br>
mappicine ketones can easily be generated to discover promising anticancer and antiviral<br>
agents.<br>
The prepared 5-alkoxy and 5-acyloxy analogues of camptothecins and<br>
mappicine ketones are useful for preparation of different other analogues which in<br>
turn are useful for discovery of novel and potent anticancer and antiviral drugs.<br>
The reaction mechanism is given below:<br>
The present invention is now described with reference to the following<br>
examples which are illustrative and should not be construed as limiting the scope of<br>
the invention in any manner.<br>
Example: 1<br>
To a well stirred solution of CAN (100 mg) in MeOH (10 ml) camptothecin<br>
(I) (100 mg) in THF-CH2C12 (1:1) (20 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred at<br>
room temperature for 2 hr. After concentration, water (20 ml) was added. The<br>
mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml) and concentrated. Impurities were<br>
removed by column chromatography over silica gel to obtain 5-<br>
methoxycamptothecin (88 mg).<br>
Example: 2<br>
Camptothecin (I) (100 mg) in a mixture of THF-CH2C12 (1:1) (20 ml) was<br>
added to a solution of CAN (100 mg) in isopropanol (10 ml) and the mixture was<br>
stirred at room temperature for 2 hr. The mixture was concentrated and water (20 ml)<br>
was added. This was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml) and concentrated. The residue<br>
was subjected to column chromatography over silica gel for removal of the impurities<br>
to afford 5- isopropoxycamptothecin (84 mg).<br>
Example: 3<br>
9-Methoxycamptothecin (II) (100 mg) in CH2C12 (20 ml) was added to a well<br>
stirred solution of CAN (100 mg) in EtOH (10 ml). The stirring was continued at<br>
room temperature for 2 hr. The mixture was concentrated and water (20 ml) was<br>
added. This was extracted with EtOAc (3X10 ml). The concentrated extract on<br>
column chromatography over silica gel produced 5-ethoxy-9-methoxycamptothecin<br>
(81 mg).<br>
Example: 4<br>
A solution of CAN (100 mg) in MeOH (10 ml) was stirred at room<br>
temperature. A solution of 20-O-acetylcamptothecin (HI) (100 mg) in CHC13 ( 20 ml)<br>
was added. The mixture was stirred for 2 hr. This was concentrated and water (20 ml)<br>
was added. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml), concentrated and<br>
subjected to column chromatography over silica gel to yield 5-methoxy-20-O-acetyl<br>
camptothecin (82 mg).<br>
Example: 5<br>
To a well-stirred solution of CAN (100 mg) in MeOH (10 ml) mappicine<br>
ketone (100 mg) in CHCls (20 ml) was added. The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 2 hr. The mixture was concentrated and water (20 ml) was added to<br>
this. This was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml). The concentrated extract was purified<br>
bulumn chromatography over silica gei to yield 5-methoxy mappicine ketone (95<br>
Example: 6<br>
9-Methoxymappicine ketone (V) (100 mg) in CHC13 (20 ml) was added to a<br>
solution of CAN (100 mg) in ethanol (10 ml). The mixture was stirred at room<br>
temperature for 2 hr. This was concentrated and to the concentrated mass water (20<br>
ml) was added. This was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml), concentrated and purified<br>
by column chromatography over silica gel to afford 5-ethoxy-9-methoxymappicine<br>
ketone (92 mg).<br>
Example: 7<br>
Camptothecin (I) (100 mg) was taken in AcOH (10 ml) and CAN (100 mg)<br>
was added. The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hr. Water (20 ml) was<br>
added. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml). The extract was<br>
concentrated and the impurities were removed by column chromatography over silica<br>
gel to yield 5-acetoxycamptothecin (93 mg).<br>
Example: 8<br>
CAN (100 mg) was added to a mixture of camptothecin (100 mg) and<br>
propionic acid (10 ml) and this was stirred at room temperature for 8 hr. Water (20<br>
ml) was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml). The solvent was<br>
removed from the extract and the residue was subjected to column chromatography<br>
over silica gel to obtain 5-propionoxycamptothecin (90 mg).<br>
Example: 9<br>
CAN (100 mg) was added to a well stirred solution of 9-<br>
methoxycamptothecin (100 mg) in acetic acid (10 ml) and the stirring was continued<br>
for 8 hr at room temperature. Water (20 ml) was added to the mixture and extracted<br>
with EtOAc (3x10 ml). The extract was concentrated and the impurities were<br>
removed by column chromatography over silica gel to yield 5-acetoxy-9-<br>
methoxycamptothecin (89 mg).<br>
Example: 10<br>
To a solution of 20-O-acetyl camptothecin (100 mg) in propionic acid (10 ml)<br>
CAN (100 mg) was added and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hr.<br>
Water (20 ml) was added and the mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml). The<br>
concentrated extract on chromatography over silica gel afforded 5-propionoxy-20-Oacetylcamptothecin<br>
(85 mg)<br>
Example: 11<br>
To a solution of mappicine ketone (100 mg) in CHCh (10 ml) benzoic acid<br>
(100 mg) and CAN (100 mg) were added. The mixture was stirrred for 6 hr at room<br>
temperature and water (20 ml) was added. This was extracted with EtOAc (3x10 ml)<br>
and the extract was concentrated. The residue was purified by column<br>
chromatography over silica gel to produce 5-benzoyloxymappicine ketone ( 99 mg).<br>
Example: 12<br>
CAN (100 mg) was added to 9-methoxymappicine ketone (100 mg) dissolved<br>
in AcOH (10 ml). The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 6 hr. Water (20<br>
