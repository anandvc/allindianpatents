				<td>Container  and  method for  opening a container<br>
The invention relates to a container for accommodating liquid and/or past y substanc es, having a tubular outlet connector that is sealed by means of a film or a similar membrane, relative to the substance accommodated in the container, for storage, and that is configured to accommodat e an inlet connector of a dispensing element, which can be inserted into the outlet connector, in certain regions, and having a piercing sleeve that is displaceably accommodated in the outlet connector, Furthermore, the invention relates to a combination of a container and a dispensing element, as well as to a method f or opening   a  container-<br>
Liquid and/or past y components are frequently offered in rigid, cartridge-like containers or in tubular bags that are connected with a rigid dispensing cap. To open such containers, it is necessary for a user to open up a film or the like before the first use, so that the substance accommodated in the container can exit. Since it is necessary to keep a suitable tool on hand for this purpose, this is felt to be complicated and disadvantageous-<br>
A devic e   f or   opening   a   tubular   bag   containing   a   past y   substance is  described   in   DE 299   23   938   Ul,   whereby an   axially displaceable<br><br>
small piercing tube is provided in an accommodation cap connected with the tubular bag, in an outlet connector. This small tube can be manually displaced from a retracted position in which the small piercing tube does not project beyond the contact plane of the tubular bag, but projects out of the outlet connector on the opposite side, into an advanced position in which the small piercing tube projects beyond the contact plane and thereby opens the tubular bag. In order to avoid unintentional opening of the tubular bag during transport and storage, a removable spacer is provided, by means of which the small pi ere in g tube can be held in its retracted position. Similar devices are also known from EP 1 138, 396 Bl, EP 1 138 397 Bl, EP 1 227 049 Bl, and EP 1 557 363 Al, In the case of these devices, it can be felt to be a disadvantage that the spac er must be removed before opening the container, in some application cases. Furthermore, there is the risk of unintentional opening of the container if the spac er is not   sufficiently secured.<br>
Mixers are proposed in CH 674 717 AS and DE 196 693 Al, which can be connected with containers as dispensing elements. In this connection, the inlet connectors of the mixers ar e configured as pi ercing taps that can piere e a tubular bag or the like to open it. Opening of the containers is therefore only possible using a mixer   specially configured  for   this   purpose.<br><br>
Furthermore, tubular bags are described in DE 91 0 3 0 38 Ul, in GB 2 2 55 5 96 A, and in EP0 653 36 2 M, in each instance, which can be pushed onto rigid piercing mandrels or the like by means of dispensing pistons, which mandrels are provided in a cap or cartridge. In this way, the tubular bags can be automatically opened by means of the advanc e movement or forward arching of the tubular bag during the errpt ying proc ess. In this c onnection, however, there is the risk that the tubular bags already unintentionally make contact with the piercing nandrels during storage or transport, and this could lead to opening of the tubular   bags.<br>
A film package is   known  from EP   1   169   242   Bl,   which consists   of   a tubular   bag  and   a   lid connected  with the latter,   which  lid  can   be connected    with    an    outlet    connector    with    a    cap.      A    projecting mandrel    for    opening    the   tubular    bag    is    provided    in    the   cap. Furthermore,      a     blocking     element     is     disposed     in     the     outlet connector,    which   projects    beyond   the   tip   of   the   mandrel    in   the direction   toward   the  tubular   bag,    so   that   unintentional   opening of   the   tubular    bag   is   prevent ed.     To   open   the   tubular    bag,    the blocking   element   is   first   removed  from the  outlet   connector,   and subsequently,    the   tubular    bag   is    pushed   further    into   the   cap, with   its    lid,    so   that    the   mandrel   penetrat es    into   the   tubular bag.     To    open    a    tubular    bag,     a    user    therefore   has    to    perform multiple work   steps.<br><br>
It   is   therefore  the  task   of   the  present   invention   to   indicate   a container     as     well     as      a     method     for      opening     it,      in     which unintentional    opening    is    avoided    during    transport    or    storage, and,      at     the    same    time,     particularly    siitple     opening     of     the container   at   its   first   use is   made possible.<br>
This task is accomplished, according to the invention, with a container of the type stated initially, ess entially in that the length of the outlet connector and of the piercing sleeve are coordinated with one another in such a manner that the piercing sleeve can be displaced from a storage position, in which the piercing sleeve does not project out of the outlet connector, into an activation position, in which the piercing sleeve p en et r at es and /or at1east approximately touches the film, by means of inserting the inlet connector of the dispensing element into the outlet connector. Since the piercing sleeve preferably does not come into contact with the film in its storage position, there is no risk that the container will be unintentionally opened during transport or storage, if the film is dairBged, In contrast, the container can be easily opened if a mixer or a similar dispensing element is set onto the container. This setting on of the mixer is generally carried out intuitively by most users, so that the container is opened without any additional     work     step,      by    setting     on     the     mixer     or     si milar<br><br>
dispensing    element.    This   furthermore   has   the   advantage   that   the container   remains   sealed   until   i mmediately   before  its   first   use. Unint entional    exit    of   the   substances   contained   in   the  container and/or   penetration   of   germs   or  contaminants   into the container   is effectively   prevent ed   in   this    manner.     An   airtight   package   until immediately   before   the   first    use   is    also   decisive   for    storage stability in  the case  of   many products   used   in  the dental   sector. For     secure    opening,     it     is     preferred     if     the    piercing    sleeve penetrates    the   .filrn.     However,     it    can    also    be    suf f ici ent    to displace the piercing  sleeve only so far  that   it  touches  the film or   at    least    is    positioned   very   close   to   the   film,    so   that    the film is   only  opened  during  forward   arching  when   emptying  pressure is   applied.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the contain er is formed by a tubular bag and a rigid cap connect ed with the latter, on which cap the outlet connector is provided. In this connection, the tubular bag forms the film or similar membrane that seals the outlet connector. Such tubular bags have the advantage that the container, which is frequently a disposable article, has a comparatively low weight and can be disposed   of   in  space-saving   manner.<br>
Alternatively,    the   container   can   also   be   configured   as   a   rigid cartridge,    on  the face of   which the  outlet  connector   is   provided.<br><br>
In this connection, the out 1 et connect or can be s ea 1 ed f or storage by means of a film or similar membrane, for example in the plane of the face of the cartridge, i. e. for example at the cartridge-side   end   of   the  outlet   connector.<br>
If the piereing sleeve is formed from an elastic mat erial, particularly spring st eel, as a sleeve slit in the longitudinal direction, the piereing sleeve can be held within the outlet connector, essentially so as not to come loose. For this purpose, the piercing sleeve is introduced into the outlet connector under bias, if necessary, so that the piercing sleeve rests closely against the inside wall of the outlet connector, Unintentional opening of the container by means of displacement of the piercing sleeve, for exarrple due to severe shocks during transport, can be avoided in this manner. However, it must be taken into consideration in the selection of a suitable material for the piercing sleeve that the latter must be sufficiently rigid to be able to open a tubular bag or similar film Alternatively or in addition to wedging the pi ercing sleeve in the outlet connector under bias, spreading spring arms and/or count er-hooks can also be provided, for example, which prevent the piercing sleeve from being pulled out, according to the principle of a dowel. This is particularly irrportant if rraterial is supposed to be dispensed without a mixer being set on, for exarrple in the case of a function  check.<br><br>
In a further development of this idea of the invention, it is provided that the piercing sleeve has means for fixing the piercing sleeve in place in the outlet connector, particularly in releasable manner. Thus, the piercing sleeve can be locked in place in the outlet connector in its storage position and/or in its activation position, for example. Furthermore, a locking device, f or exarrple a hook or a stop, can also be provided, in order to limit the displac ement path of the piercing sleeve in the outlet  connector.<br>
In order to allow fast and reliable opening of the container, it is preferred if the piercing sleeve has at least one tip formed by a slanted part, for exarrple, and/or one cutting edge, on its side facing the film In this connection, opening of the container can take place in that the piercing sleeve cuts into the film or cuts out a region of the film, or that the film is weakened or caused to burst. In the case that the piercing sleeve cuts out a region of the film, it is preferred if the cut-out region of the film still remains connect ed with the r erreining film, so that the mixer or similar dispensing element is not plugged  up  by a punched-out  piece of  film<br>
Specifically when   the  piercing   sleeve  is   rrede from spring   steel, the   piercing   sleeve   can    be   produced   from   a   corrparatively   thin<br><br>
sheet -metal strip. In order to ensure that the piercing sleeve can be displaced within the outlet connector by the mixer or similar dispensing element, it has proven to be advantageous if the piercing sleeve has a projection that projects radially inward, at least on its side facing away from the film. This proj ection s erves as an additional contact surf ac e for the inlet connector of the dispensing element that can be inserted into the outlet connector, by means of which displacement of the piercing sleeve is brought about. If the piercing sleeve is configured as a slit sleeve, at least one of the edges of the piercing sleeve that run in the axial direction, along the slit, can be bent inward to form such a projection. This embodiment has the advantage, as compared with a beaded edging or the like, that the lumen   is   only  marginally reduced   in   size.<br>
In some application cases, it is desirable if the tip of the piercing sleeve impacts the film at a defined location, in order to open it. For this purpose, the piercing sleeve and the out let connector can have means for aligning and/or preventing rotation of the piercing sleeve in the outlet connector, which means are assigned to one another. This can be achieved, according to one embodiment of the invention, in that the outlet connector has a cross -section that does not have rotation symmetry, at least in certain regions, and the piercing sleeve is adapted to this geometry.    Alternatively   or   in   addition   to  this,    a   crosspiece   or<br><br>
similar projection can be provided on the inside of the outlet connector, the width of which is coordinated with that of the slit of the piercing sleeve, so that the piercing sleeve is guided   in   the  outlet   connector.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a combination of at least one container for accommodating liquid and/or pasty substances and a dispensing element that can be connected with it, whereby the c ontain er has a tubular out1et connect or that can be sealed by a film or similar membrane, in which connector a piercing sleeve is displac eably accommodated, and whereby the dispensing element has at least one inlet connector that can be inserted into the outlet connector, in each instance. In this connection, the length of the outlet connector, of the inlet connector, and of the piercing sleeve are to be coordinated with one another, in such a manner that the piercing sleeve be displaced from a storage position, in which the piercing sleeve does not project out of the outlet connector, int o an activation position, in which the piercing sleeve penetrates and/or touches the film, by means of inserting the inlet connector of the dispensing element into the  outlet   connector,<br>
In this connection, the dispensing element can be a mixer whose inlet connectors can be inserted into the outlet connectors of two     containers-       Particularly     when      using     this      combination.<br><br>
according to the invention, in the dental sector, it is preferred if two containers are combined to form a double cartridge. This can be done, for example, in that cartridge-like containers are rigidly connect ed with one another, or that a connection element is provided in order to connect two tubular bag packages with one another. The mixer can be both a dynamic, i.e. driven mixer, and a static mixer. However, it is also possible to provide other dispensing elements, for example an applicator, which can be set onto a container with an inlet connector, in such a manner that the piercing  sleeve is  displaced  to  open  the container.<br>
In the case of a method according to the invention for opening a container, the tubular outlet connector of the latter is sealed by a film or similar membrane, at first, whereby a piereing sleeve is displac eably accommodat ed in the outlet connector. To open the container, an inlet connector of a dispensing element is ins ert ed into the outlet connector in such a manner that as a result, the pi ercing sleeve is displac ed from a storage position into an activation position. In the storage position, the piercing sleeve does not project out of the outlet connector, and preferably also does not stand in contact with the film. In contrast, in its activation position, the piercing sleeve is displac ed so far toward the film that the film is at least weakened by means of the contact with the piercing sleeve, and then   bursts   or  tears   open  when   an   errptying pressure is   applied  to<br><br>
the container. Preferably, however, the piereing sleeve pierees or cuts through the film. However, it can also be sufficient to displac e the piercing sleeve only so far that it is at least positioned very close to the film, so that the film is opened only when it arches forward, when an errptying pressure is applied.<br>
In the following, the invention will be explained in great er detail using an exerrplary embodiment and making reference to the drawing. In this connection, all of the characteristics described and/or shown in the illustrations form the obj ect of the invention, in thems elves or in any desired combination, independent of how they are summariz ed in the clai ms or their antecedents.<br>
The drawing  schematically shows:<br>

Figure 5     in   an   enlarged   representation,   a   broken-open  cap  with  a piereing  sleeve ins ert ed.<br>
In the case of the exerrplary embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 4, two containers 1 and 2 assigned to one another are provided, onto which a common mixer 3 can be set. In this connection, the containers are essentially formed by rigid caps la, 2a as well as tubular bags lb, 2b connected with them. The tubular bags lb, 2b that consist of a flexible film material can be glued into the caps la, 2a, for exarrple, or connected with them in some other way,   preferably forming  a  seal.<br>
Each of the two caps la, 2 a has a tubular outlet connector 4, which projects from the face of the caps. As can be seen in the sectional view of Figures 2 and 4, in which only one tubular bag 2b is shown, in each instance, for reasons of a clearer illustration, the tubular bags make contact, at least in certain regions, with a face-side stop wall or delimitation wall of the caps la and 2 a. A piereing sleeve 5 can be ins ert ed into the outlet connectors 4, in each instance. The piercing sleeves 5 can consist of spring st eel, for example, or another suffieiently rigid  and   elastic   material.   On  their  side facing the tubular   bags<br><br>
lb, 2b, a tip 6 or a cutting edge with which the film material of the tubular bags can be cut is formed on each piercing sleeve 5, by  means   of   a  slant ed  part.<br>
The mixer 3, only indicated schematically in the figures, has two inlet connectors 1, whos e outside diamet er is adapt ed to the inside diameter of the outlet connectors 4, in such a manner that the inlet connectors 7 can be inserted into the outlet connectors 4,    essentially forming  a   seal.<br>
As can be seen in the representation of Figures 2 and 5, the length of the outlet connectors 4 and the length of the piercing sleeves 5 are adapt ed to one another in such a mianner that the piercing sleeves 5 can be introduced into the outlet connectors 4 in such a manner that the piercing sleeves 5 neither project out of the end of the outlet connectors 4 that f ac es the mixer 3, nor project beyond the face-side stop surface of the caps la, 2a. In this St or age position, shown in Figures 2 and 5, the tips 6 of the pi ere in g sleeves 5 therefore do not come into contact with the tubular bags. Sine e the pi ereing sleeves 5 are corrplet ely accommodat ed in the outlet connectors 4, there is also no danger that the piercing sleeves 5 are unintentionally displaced further in   the direction  toward  the tubular   bags.<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, the mixer 3 can be set onto the containers 1 and 2, so that the inlet connectors 7 of the mixer 3 penetrate into the outlet connectors 4 of the caps la and 2a. In this way, the piercing sleeves 5 accommodated in the outlet connectors 4 are displaced into the activation position shown in Figure 4, i,e, in the direction toward the tubular bags lb, 2b. In this connection, the tips 6 of the piercing sleeves 5 cut the material of the tubular bags lb, 2b, so that substances accommodated in the containers 1 and 2, respectively, can flow through the piercing sleeves 5 and the outlet connectors 4, into the mixer 3, by way of the inlet connectors 7. The containers 1 and 2 can consequently be opened by setting on the mixer 3, and the axial displacement   of   the piercing  sleeves   5  that   results  from this.<br>
The piercing sleeves 5 can be bent from a sheet-metal part, in particularly si mple manner, and therefore have a longitudinal slit 8. As shown in Figures 1 and 5, an axial longitudinal edge of the piercing sleeve 5 that is adjacent to the slit 8 is bent inward. As a result, a larger c ontact surf ac e between the piereing sleeve 5 and the inlet connectors 7 of the mixer 3 occurs. The inlet connectors 7 of the mixer 3 can therefore not be inserted into the piercing sleeves 5 even if particularly thin sheet metals are used. Alternatively to this, a beaded edge can also be provided on the piercing sleeve 5, which enters into contact   with the inlet   connectors   of   the  mixer.<br><br>
At the same time, the region of the piercing sleeve 5 that is bent inward, together with the slit 8, s erves to guide the piercing sleeve 5 in the outlet connector 4, For this purpose, a crosspiece 9 that projects radially inward is provided in the outlet connector 4; it has a width that approximately corresponds to the width of the slit 8 of the piercing sleeve 5. In this manner, the piereing sleeves 5 are guided in the outlet connectors 4 so that they cannot rotate. This is inportant so t hat the tips 6 are p os i t i on ed at a 1 oc at i on at whic h opt i ma 1 opening is made possible. Thus it is preferred if the tips 6 do not come into contact with pleats of the tubular bags lb, 2b, if at   all  possible.<br>
On the side of the crosspiece 9 that faces the tubular bags, a stop surface 10 is formed, which limits the movement of the piercing spade 5 in the direction toward the tubular bags. In the opposite direction of movement, the pi ercing sleeves 5 are held in the outlet connectors 4 by means of their elastic bias, so that the piercing sleeves 5 cannot fall out of the outlet connectors   4  during transport.<br>
Alternatively to the embodiment of the containers shown in Figures 1 to 5, essentially rigid, cartridge-like containers can also   be   provided   according   to   the   invention.    For   this    purpose,<br><br>
the cylindrical wall 11 of the caps that projects downward in Figure 5 can be lengthened accordingly, for example. The substances to be stored can then be filled directly into the container for med in this manner. To close the outlet connectors 4, a film or similar membrane can be provided, for exarrple in the plane of the face-side stop surf ac e of the caps, to prevent the substances from running out. This film or membrane can be cut as described above, by means of setting on a mixer and thereby displacing  the piercing   sleeves   5.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, not shown in the figures, the mandrel sleeve can proj ect outward out of the connect or in its storage position. In this connection, the inlet connectors of the mixer do not penetrate into the outlet connectors, but rather engage around them when the mixer is connected with the containers. The inlet connectors of the mixer are provided with an inner projection, a step, or another suitable stop surface, which enters into contact with the mandrel sleeve, in each instance, when the mixer is set onto the containers. In this way, mandrel sleeve is activated, i.e. displaced in the direction toward the film, so that the latter is opened either directly or by means of applying an errpt ying pressur e.<br><br>
Furthermore, it is also possible, according to the invention, to provide a combination of the two embodiments described above, in the case of two containers that can be connected with a mixer, so t hat on e in 1 et c onn ect or of the mixer penetrates int o an out 1 et connector, while the other inlet connect or of the mixer engages ar ound   an   out 1 et  c onnector.<br><br>
