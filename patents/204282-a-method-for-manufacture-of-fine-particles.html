METHOD FOR MANUFACTURE OF FINE PARTICLES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of Invention The current invention relates to a method for the production of micro or nanometer size particles by precipitation, wherein  dispersion containing the substance of interest is contacted with a supercritical fluid antisolvent under near or supercritical conditions in order to maximize .micro or nanoparticle formation. The invention also provides techniques to control the particle size, particle size distribution and particle morphogy. The invention also includes supercritical fluid coating or composite material particle formation, wherein encapsulation of one substance by amother substance or coprecipitation of more than one substance in the for a of micro or nanoparticles are achieved in the supercritical fluid antisolvent<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Nanopartides are of considerable importance in numerous technological applications. Nanopartides of materials in fact exhibit properties significantly different from those of the same material with larger sizes. Some nanostructured material with novel properties indude: fullerenes,  zeolites, organic crystals, non-linear optical material, high temperature superconductors, moleular magnetic materials, starbuist deodrimers, piezoelectric materials, shape changing alloys and pharmaceuticals. The novel properties of these nanostruaured materials can be exploited and numerous potential applications can be devdoped by using them in different industries. One such industry where the need for nanopartides is particularly pronounced is the pharmaceutical industry where nanopartides of difffent pharmaceutical materials are used lor designing drug delivery systems' for controlled release and targeting.<br>
Several techniques have been used in the past for the manufcture of nanopartides but tiiese techniques suffer from some inherent limitations, Some of the conventional techniques include: Spray drying, which is one of the well-known techniques for particle formation and can be used to produce particles of 5 μm or less in size. The major disadvantage of this technique is that it requires high temperature in order to evaporate the solvent in use, and this makes it unsuitable for treating blological and pharmaceutical substances. Furthermore, the<br><br>
final product yield smy be low in case of small-scale applications. Milling can be used to produce particles in the 10 - 50 μm range, but the particles produced by this method have a broad size distribution. Fluid energy grinding can produce particles in the 1-10μm range but this process involve the use of high-velocity compressed air, which leads to electrostatically charged powders. In addition, particle size reduction by this process tends to be more efficient for hard and brittle materials such as salt and minerals, but much less so for soft powders, such as phsomaceuticals and other biological substances. L:yophilization produces partides in the desired range, but with a broad distribution. A main disadvantage of this process is that it employs the use of organic solvents that may be unsuitable for obarmaceutical substances. In addition, control of particle size can also be difficult, and a secondary drying step is required to remove residual solvents. In the case of precipitation of protein particles, not all proteins can be lyophilized to stable products, and the process must be tailored to each protein.<br>
Thus, none of these methods are entirely satisfactory, and it  is therefore important to explore alternative methods that will produce particles from 5μm  down to as low as 10nm.<br>
Particle Technology Based on Supercritical fluids<br>
One of the first uses of supercritical fluids in particle formation was proposed by Krukonis et al. in 1984 for processing a wide variety of dilficult-to-handle solids. Since then, several experimental studies have been conducted to develop methods for particle formation using this technology. The two primary methods utilizing suercritical fluid technology for particle processing include Supercritical Antisolvent (SAS) Predpitation technique and the Rapid Expansion of Suercritical Solutions (RESS) technique. For many years now, these techniques have been successfully used to produce micropartides of various compounds including difficult to hole explosives (Gallagher et al., 1989), lysozyme, trypsin (Winter et al, 1993), insulin (Yeo et al., 1993; Winfer et al, 1993), prednisolone acetate (US patent 5,803,966), polystyrene HYAFF-11 polymers (Benedetti et d., 1997), dififerent steoids(Larson and King, 1985), and numerous other orgaiuc substances. Other areas of application of supercriticd fluids mclude formation of solvent free, drug loaded polymer micro-spheres for controlled drug release of therapeutic agents (Tom et al, 1992; Mudler and Fischer 1989), production of ultra-fine arid chemicdiy pure ceramic precursors, (Mation et d., 198S a,b, 1987 a,b; Peterson et d. 1985), formation of intimate mixtures of<br><br><br><br>
The Working of the SAS Process<br>
In the SAS process, the supercritcal fluid is used as the antisolvent First the solid of interest is dissolved in a suitable organic solvent Then this solution is introduced into the supercritical fluid using a nozzle. The supercritical fluid dissolves the solvent, precipitating the solid out as fine particles.<br><br><br>
The SAS technique can be used to produce particles having a narrow size distribution in the 1-10 μm size range. Unfortunately these techniques cannot produce much smaller particles in the nanometor range. Nanometer size particles are extremely important for many pharmaceutical applications. New applications of nanoparticles of other substances can also<br><br>
They disclose the use of a commmerical ultrasonic nozzle (Soncnnist, Model 600-1) for the droplet atomization. The sonic waves in this case are created when an energizing gas passes through a resonator cavity at the velocity of sound. The frequency of the sonic waves created is not constant and it is difficult to specify the frequency of the sound waves generated. Trying to vary the sonic energy might interfere with other process conditions and as a result it may not be used as a size control variable.<br><br><br><br><br>
A major advantage of the present invention over other forms of supercritical fluid particle precipitation techniques is that the sizes of the particles fonned by this technique can be easily controlled by changing the vibraiion intensity of the deflecting surface, which in turn can be controlled by adjusting the input power to the vibrating source. For instance the size control parameters investigate so far in the SAS process are pressure and temperature of the antisolvent, concentration of the dispersion and the flow rate of the dispersion into the supercritical fluid antisolvent.   All these parameters axe not robust enough to generate a<br><br>
pronounces change in particle size. Besides, conflicting results have been obtained by different researchers about the actual effect of these parameters on particle size and distribution and no general trend has been established.<br><br>
