				<td>Silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler, process for<br>
its production and its use<br>
The invention concerns a silane-modified oxidic or<br>
siliceous filler, a process for its production and its<br>
use.<br>
The treatment of oxidic or siliceous compounds with<br>
organosilicon compounds in order by this treatment to<br>
strengthen the bond between the inorganic filler and the<br>
organic polymer used in filler-reinforced elastomers and<br>
thereby to improve the properties of the fillers in the<br>
polymers is known.<br>
It is known from DE 2141159, DE 2212239 and US 3,978,103<br>
that sulfur-containing organosilicon compounds, such as<br>
bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfane or 3-<br>
mercaptopropyl triethoxysilane, are used as the silane<br>
coupling agent or reinforcing filler in oxidic-filled<br>
rubber compounds, inter alia for tyre treads and other<br>
parts of car tyres.<br>
In order to circumvent the considerable problems that<br>
arise during the processing of mercaptosilanes, such as<br>
pre-scorch, scorch and plasticity properties for example,<br>
it is known that mostly polysulfidic organosilanes, such<br>
as for example bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfane<br>
or bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfane (DE 2542534,<br>
DE2405758, DE19541404, DE19734295), which for silica-<br>
filled vulcanisates represent a compromise in terms of<br>
vulcanising safety, simple production and reinforcing<br>
performance, can be used as a coupling agent for tyre<br>
components.<br>
The known incorporation of the corresponding additives,<br>
especially organosilanes and the unmodified fillers, into<br>
the unvulcanised polymer blends can be performed in<br>
various ways.<br>
The in-situ method involves a joint process for mixing<br>
fillers, such as carbon black and silica, with<br>
organosilanes and the polymers used.<br>
The ex-situ method involves modifying the filler with the<br>
corresponding organosilane or a mixture of various<br>
organosilanes, before the filler is processed with the<br>
polymer to form the unvulcanised rubber mix.<br>
Also known is the addition of organosilanes in liquid form<br>
(US 3,997,356) during production of the unvulcanised mix<br>
for rubber compounds or the addition of the active filler<br>
via a physical mixture of organosilane and filler prepared<br>
in advance (DE 3314742, US 4,076,550). The disadvantage of<br>
these mixtures, which have undergone no thermal<br>
pretreatment, is the poor storage stability and hence the<br>
often inadequate property stability of the products.<br>
US-PS 4,151,154 describes oxidic siliceous fillers whose<br>
surface is treated with two different types of<br>
organosilicon compounds. The oxidic particles are treated<br>
in such a way that they display a greater affinity to<br>
water and can also be dispersed more easily in aqueous<br>
systems.<br>
The modification of kaolin suspended in water with various<br>
organosilanes is known from US 3,567,680. However, the<br>
organosilicon compounds that are described are water-<br>
soluble in the quantities required for modification, such<br>
that in this case the filler can be treated from an<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
US 4,044,037 describes aryl polysulfides and mineral<br>
fillers treated with these compounds, which are used in<br>
rubber compounds. They are produced in an aqueous/alcohol<br>
formulation containing 80 to 99.9 wt.% alcohol.<br>
A process is also known from EP-PS 01 26 871 wherein the<br>
surface of siliceous fillers is modified with the aid of<br>
an aqueous emulsion of water-insoluble organosilicon<br>
compounds.<br>
It is known that the surface of fillers can be modified by-<br>
dissolving the organosilicon compound in an organic<br>
solvent with subsequent treatment of the fillers, e.g.<br>
clays (US 3,227,675).<br>
The known processes for modifying fillers for rubber and<br>
plastic applications with surface-active organosilanes or<br>
mixtures thereof have the disadvantage of being based on<br>
the use of water, organic solvents or direct spraying of<br>
the organosilicon compound onto the surface of the filler<br>
with a subsequent heat treatment, the conditioning<br>
reaction. The known water-insoluble rubber-typical<br>
organosilanes can often be effectively chemically bonded<br>
with fillers only in hydrocarbon-based solvents, most of<br>
which are toxic and readily flammable.<br>
The known fillers modified ex situ with organosilanes have<br>
the disadvantage that until now the rubber properties have<br>
tended to be not better but in fact poorer than is the<br>
case with fillers and silanes mixed together in situ.<br>
In addition, in the case of fillers having a large<br>
specific surface area or a pronounced surface texture,<br>
silanisation is often not homogeneous. Diffusion of the<br>
silane molecules into underlying layers of highly porous<br>
fillers, such as precipitated silicas for example, can be<br>
achieved only incompletely if at all with the modification<br>
methods known until now. Macroscopically preformed fillers<br>
are therefore modified only inadequately and incompletely<br>
by the known silanisation processes.<br>
In addition, preformed fillers cannot be silanised<br>
successfully and non-destructively or with low abrasion by<br>
means of the known silanisation processes and the<br>
subsequent drying process that is often necessary. The<br>
structure of preformed fillers is or would be destroyed or<br>
damaged with the known processes (US 4,151,154; DE 3314742<br>
C2; US 3,567,680). Thus for example silica granules formed<br>
on rolls (DE 3014007) are very rapidly broken down into a<br>
poorer quality silica powder (higher dust and fines<br>
content) by being introduced into a mixer or similar<br>
equipment and kept in motion for an extended period of<br>
time.<br>
A process for reacting at least one biopolymeric,<br>
biooligomeric, oxidic or siliceous filler in a compressed<br>
gas with at least one silane is known from DE 10122269.6.<br>
The use of powdered and granular fillers therein described<br>
is disadvantageous. Powdered silicas are disadvantageous<br>
in industrial conditions, for example because of their<br>
high dust content, low bulk density, poor flow properties<br>
and hence commonly poor meterability. Granules can<br>
subsequently be obtained from powdered silicas by<br>
mechanical compaction. Since this means an additional<br>
processing step, manufacturers try to avoid such processes<br>
due to economic considerations. These granules easily<br>
break down again into the powdered starting material under<br>
mechanical loading and in addition the applicational<br>
properties of the silicas frequently deteriorate due to<br>
the subsequent granulation and associated mechanical<br>
loading of the particles.<br>
The object of the present invention is to produce a low-<br>
dust silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler directly<br>
from a low-dust microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or<br>
siliceous filler. The silane-modified oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler should display a satisfactory, quantitatively<br>
easily variable coverage with the corresponding rubber-<br>
reactive silanes and moreover comparable or better<br>
properties than known silane-filler mixtures produced in<br>
situ and moreover better rubber properties in the rubber<br>
than known silane-filler mixtures produced ex situ.<br>
A further object of the invention is to be able to work or<br>
process the microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or<br>
siliceous filler to be modified in a low-dust supply form.<br>
The external, macroscopic shape of these preformed<br>
microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous fillers<br>
should be largely maintained during the modification<br>
process. A largely dust-free or low-dust silane-modified<br>
oxidic or siliceous filler should be obtained.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
process for modifying microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic<br>
or siliceous fillers with silanes, wherein the<br>
modification reaction is not performed in water or organic<br>
solvents.<br>

or mixtures of the aforementioned silanes.<br>
Oligomers, in other words oligosiloxanes and<br>
polysiloxanes, or cooligomers of silanes having the<br>
general formula (I)-(VI), or mixtures thereof, can be used<br>
as the silane. The siloxanes can be obtained by<br>
oligomerisation or cooligomerisation of the corresponding<br>
silane compounds having the general formulae (I)-(VI) by<br>
addition of water and of additives known to the person<br>
skilled in the art in this area.<br>
Oligomeric silanes are described for example in EP 652 245<br>
Bl, EP 0 700 951 Bl, EP 0 978 525 A2 and DE 199 29 021 Al.<br>
Mixtures of silanes can also be used as the silane within<br>
the meaning of the present invention for the modification<br>
of fillers, for example mixtures of silanes having the<br>
general formula (I)-(VI) or mixtures of the oligomeric or<br>
polymeric siloxanes of silanes having the general formula<br>
(I)-(VI) or mixtures of silanes having the general formula<br>
(I)-(VI) with mixtures of the oligomeric or polymeric<br>
siloxanes of silanes having the general formula (I)-(VI).<br>
A natural and/or synthetic filler can be used as the<br>
untreated microbeaded or microgranular oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler.<br>
The microbeaded or microgranular oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler can be compatible with the rubbers and display the<br>
fine-particle character and reinforcing effect in the<br>
polymer matrix that is necessary for this application.<br>
Silicate, for example kaolin, mica, kieselguhr,<br>
diatomaceous earth, talc, wollastonite or clay, as well as<br>
silicates inter alia in the form of glass beads, ground<br>
glass chips (glass powder), glass fibres or glass cloths,<br>
can be used as the natural, siliceous filler.<br>
All types of metal oxides, for example aluminium oxide,<br>
aluminium hydroxide or trihydrate, zinc oxide, boron<br>
oxides, magnesium oxides, as well as transition metal<br>
oxides, such as titanium dioxide, can be used as oxidic<br>
fillers.<br>
In addition, aluminium silicates, silicates, zeolites,<br>
precipitated silicas with BET surface areas (measured with<br>
gaseous nitrogen) of 1 to 1000 m2/g, preferably to<br>
300 m2/g, can be used as the oxidic or siliceous filler.<br>
By way of example, the precipitated silica Ultrasil 7005<br>
sold by Degussa AG as well as the silica Hi-Sil® 210 sold<br>
by PPG Industries Inc. and the products Zeosil 1115 MP,<br>
Zeosil 1135 MP, zeosil 1165 MP, Zeosil 1165 MPS or Zeosil<br>
1205 MP sold by Rhodia can be used.<br>
Silicas from other manufacturers that display similar<br>
properties or product characteristics to the silicas<br>
mentioned above or display similar, comparable analytical<br>
data (especially BET surface areas, CTAB surface areas,<br>
BET/CTAB ratio, Sears number, bead fraction or particle<br>
size distributions, shape factors, circle factors and DBP<br>
index), can also be used without any problem to produce<br>
the silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler according<br>
to the invention.<br>
Compounds that are gaseous under normal temperature and<br>
pressure conditions and that are suitable as a reaction<br>
matrix for the silane/filler mixtures can be used as the<br>
compressed gas. For example, carbon dioxide, helium,<br>
nitrogen, dinitrogen monoxide, sulfur hexafluoride,<br>
gaseous alkanes with 1 to 5 C atoms (methane, ethane,<br>
propane, n-butane, isobutane, neopentane), gaseous alkenes<br>
with 2 to 4 C atoms (ethylene, propylene, butene), gaseous<br>
alkynes (acetylene, propyne and butyne-1), gaseous dienes<br>
(propadiene) , gaseous fluorocarbons, chlorinated<br>
hydrocarbons and/or chlorofluorocarbons (freons, CHCs,<br>
HCFCs) or substitutes thereof that are used because of<br>
current legislation, or ammonia, as well as mixtures of<br>
these substances, can be used.<br>
Carbon dioxide can preferably be used as the compressed<br>
gas, since it is non-toxic, non-combustible, unreactive<br>
and inexpensive. In addition, the necessary supercritical<br>
conditions or near critical conditions can easily be<br>
achieved as the critical pressure and critical temperature<br>
are only 73 bar and 31°C respectively.<br>
Compressed gases can be defined according to E.Stahl,<br>
K.W.Quirin, D.Gerard, "Verdichtete Gase zur Extraktion und<br>
Raffination", Springer-Verlag, page 12-13. Compressed<br>
gases can be supercritical gases, critical gases or gases<br>
in the liquefied region.<br>
Surprisingly, the use according to the invention of a<br>
compressed gas is extremely advantageous. Commercial<br>
microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous fillers<br>
corresponding to the present invention, for example, and<br>
especially silicas, are silanised unexpectedly well, not<br>
only at or adjacent to the surface but also comparatively<br>
homogeneously within a microbead or microgranule.<br>
Due to the high dissolving power and diffusibility, the<br>
low viscosity and the ability of organic silanes or<br>
organic oligomeric or polymeric siloxanes in particular to<br>
permit high diffusion rates in the compressed gas,<br>
compressed gases are surprisingly suitable for<br>
impregnating microporous, mesoporous and macroporous<br>
solids with monomeric or oligomeric silane compounds. The<br>
silane compounds can be transported by the compressed gas<br>
into the pores and channels and onto the so-called "inner<br>
surfaces" of the microbeaded or microgranular porous<br>
fillers. They are then chemically or/and physically bonded<br>
there and immobilised.<br>
Since they are in gaseous form under normal conditions,<br>
compressed gases can advantageously be easily separated<br>
from the filler on completion of its silanisation and in<br>
the case of carbon dioxide in particular they also have<br>
virtually no environmentally hazardous potential, since<br>
they find their way into the natural carbon cycle or can<br>
easily be recycled. That is a significant technical<br>
advantage as compared with known processes, since on the<br>
one hand a homogeneous reaction matrix is assured by the<br>
compressed fluid in the same way as with known organic<br>
solvents yet at the same time a complex removal step; for<br>
example removal of a solvent in vacuo under thermal<br>
loading, can be avoided.<br>
The compressed gas can be pressurised in an air-tight<br>
sealed room or container in which the material to be<br>
treated is located. During this process the pressure can<br>
be increased, generally from atmospheric pressure, to the<br>
operating pressure for the process according to the<br>
invention.<br>
The silanes used can be present in the compressed gas in<br>
undissolved, partially dissolved or wholly dissolved form.<br>
The microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler and the silane can first be mixed together or<br>
brought into contact and then mixed or brought into<br>
contact with the gas in compressed form.<br>
The microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler can first be mixed together or brought into contact<br>
with the gas in compressed form and then mixed or brought<br>
into contact with the silane.<br>
The silane can first be mixed together or brought into<br>
contact with the gas in compressed form and then mixed or<br>
brought into contact with the corresponding microbeaded or<br>
microgranular, oxidic or siliceous filler.<br>
"Brought into contact" can mean that the cited material is<br>
immersed, wetted or covered and is dissolved or<br>
undissolved, suspended, adsorbed or absorbed.<br>
The "bringing into contact" can be achieved for example in<br>
a container or in a hermetically sealed room into which<br>
the unmodified filler, the silane component and the gas<br>
that can potentially be transformed into the compressed<br>
state are introduced by suitable means.<br>
Contact between the unmodified filler and the silane<br>
component can be achieved here by means of various<br>
technical solutions. This can preferably be achieved using<br>
a suitable mixing unit with an integral liquid metering<br>
device, such as are very familiar to the person skilled in<br>
the art in this area. These can be, by way of example but<br>
not exclusively, mixers such as are supplied by the<br>
companies Drais, Eirich, Forberg, Gericke, Lodige, Ruberg.<br>
The mixing unit can provide a homogeneous, low-abrasion<br>
distribution of the silane used onto the microbeaded or<br>
microgranular, oxidic or siliceous filler. The energy<br>
input can advantageously be low. Tumbling mixers (e.g.<br>
drum mixers) and mixers with rotating tools and low<br>
particle loading (Froude number 
purpose.<br>
Contact between the homogeneously mixed silane and filler<br>
component and the gas which can potentially be transformed<br>
into the compressed state can be established for example<br>
in a container or in a hermetically sealed room into which<br>
the mixture of filler and silane can be introduced by<br>
suitable means. "Establishing contact" can mean that the<br>
cited material is immersed in the impregnating fluid and<br>
is wetted and covered by it, preferably that the<br>
microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous filler<br>
is completely immersed, or that all outer and inner<br>
surfaces of the microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or<br>
siliceous filler are in contact with the compressed gas.<br>
The solubility of the silane component in the compressed<br>
gas can be dependent on the nature of said gas, on its<br>
pressure and temperature. It can also be modulated and<br>
optimised by varying the pressure and temperature in order<br>
to adjust the physical properties of the compressed gas.<br>
In some cases the concentration of the silane in the<br>
solution used as the reaction medium can influence the<br>
efficiency of the treatment.<br>
In the process according to the invention 10-250 parts by<br>
weight of microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or<br>
siliceous filler can be reacted with 0.1-50 parts by<br>
weight, preferably 0.5-15 parts by weight, of silane.<br>
In the process according to the invention the pressure,<br>
which is also known as the operating pressure, can<br>
generally be between 1 and 500 bar, preferably between 1<br>
and 200 bar, particularly preferably between 1 and 150<br>
bar.<br>
The temperature (operating temperature) at which the<br>
process can be performed is between 0 and 300°C,<br>
preferably between 0 and 200°C, particularly preferably<br>
between 0 and 13 0°C.<br>
The reaction can be performed in a typical reaction vessel<br>
for high temperature/high pressure reactions or high<br>
pressure extractions.<br>
During the modification the pressure can be kept constant<br>
at various pressure levels for periods of 5-720 min,<br>
preferably 5-240 min, particularly preferably 5-30 min,<br>
and during this time the filler can be immersed or stirred<br>
in the compressed gas or the compressed gas can be passed<br>
through it.<br>
Additives can be added to the microbeaded or<br>
microgranular, oxidic or siliceous filler and/or silane<br>
before the reaction in the compressed gas.<br>
The silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler can be<br>
brought into contact with additional additives during the<br>
reaction in the compressed gas.<br>
During the reaction of the microbeaded or microgranular,<br>
oxidic or siliceous filler in the compressed gas,<br>
additional additives can be introduced into the incoming<br>
or outgoing stream of compressed gas flowing through the<br>
silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler.<br>
Ammonia, sulfur dioxide, water, short-chain or long-chain<br>
alcohols, for example methanol, ethanol, propanol,<br>
butanol, dodecanol, tetradecanol, hexadecanol, octadecanol<br>
or other alcohols with molecular weights &gt; 50 g/mol,<br>
short-chain or long-chain polyethers or polyether<br>
alcohols, for example diethylene glycol, triethylene<br>
glycol or others with molecular weights &gt; 100 g/mol,<br>
short-chain or long-chain amines with molecular weights &gt;<br>
50 g/mol, emulsifiers or short-chain or long-chain<br>
silicone oils, for example silicone oils with molecular<br>
weights &gt; 100 g/mol, or mixtures of the aforementioned<br>
compounds, can be used as additives. The silane-modified<br>
oxidic or siliceous filler can come into contact with<br>
additional substances, in addition to the compressed gas<br>
or compressed gas mixtures, during the modification<br>
reaction.<br>
The microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler mixed with the silane can be continuously<br>
circulated with a suitable agitator in the high-pressure<br>
unit or high-pressure vessel. The stirring speed can be<br>
adjusted to the prevailing temperature and pressure.<br>
Lifting agitators, paddle agitators, straight-arm paddle<br>
agitators, perforated paddle agitators, cross-arm paddle<br>
agitators, anchor agitators, gate agitators, straight-<br>
blade turbines, propeller agitators, screw mixers, turbine<br>
mixers, disk agitators, planetary-type mixers, centrifugal<br>
mixers or impeller agitators can be used as the agitator.<br>
The agitator in the high-pressure vessel can operate at 1-<br>
100, preferably 1-50 revolutions, strokes or circulations<br>
per minute.<br>
The microbeaded or microgranular, oxidic or siliceous<br>
filler mixed with a silane can be continually wetted<br>
during the modification reaction by a compressed gas<br>
passing through it, without being circulated in the high-<br>
pressure vessel or being mixed together any more by<br>
agitators.<br>
Following surface modification the silane-modified oxidic<br>
or siliceous filler can undergo an evacuation or pressure<br>
release stage with separation of the compressed gas and<br>
the added additives or part of the added additives from<br>
the end product.<br>
The evacuation or pressure release stage can be performed<br>
in a time of between 1 min and 180 min, preferably between<br>
1 min and 120 min, particularly preferably between 1 min<br>
and 60 min.<br>
The evacuation or pressure release stage can be performed<br>
at temperatures between 1 and 3 00°C, preferably between 1<br>
and 200°C, particularly preferably between 1 and 150°C,<br>
and most particularly preferably at temperatures between 1<br>
and 130°C.<br>
The silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler according<br>
to the invention can undergo an additional compacting or<br>
processing stage.<br>
The silane-modified oxidic or siliceous filler can be used<br>
in paints, lacquers, printing inks, films, coatings,<br>
adhesives and lubricants, cosmetics, toothpastes, building<br>
auxiliary materials or as a filler in vulcanisable<br>
rubbers, silicones or plastics.<br>
The invention also provides rubber compounds that are<br>
characterised in that they contain rubber, the silane-<br>
modified oxidic or siliceous filler according to the<br>
invention, optionally precipitated silica and/or carbon<br>
black and/or other rubber auxiliary substances.<br>
Natural rubber or synthetic rubbers can be used to produce<br>
rubber compounds according to the invention. Preferred<br>
synthetic rubbers are described for example in W. Hofmann,<br>
Kautschuktechnologie, Genter Verlag, Stuttgart 1980. They<br>
include inter alia polybutadiene (BR), polyisoprene (IR),<br>
styrene/butadiene copolymers with styrene contents of 1 to<br>
60, preferably 5 to 50 wt.% (E- or S-SBR), isobutylene/<br>
isoprene copolymers (IIR), butadiene/acrylonitrile<br>
copolymers with acrylonitrile contents of 5 to 60,<br>
preferably 10 to 50 wt.% (NBR), chloroprene (CR),<br>
ethylene/propylene/diene copolymers (EPDM), and mixtures<br>
of these rubbers.<br>
The rubber compounds according to the invention can<br>
contain other rubber auxiliary products, such as for<br>
example reaction accelerators and retarders, antioxidants,<br>
stabilisers, processing aids, plasticisers, waxes, metal<br>
oxides and activators, such as triethanolamine,<br>
polyethylene glycol or hexane triol, organically modified<br>
silanes and other rubber auxiliary products known to the<br>
rubber industry.<br>
The rubber compound can additionally contain alkyl silanes<br>
or/and silicone oils.<br>
The rubber auxiliary substances can be used in<br>
conventional quantities, which are governed inter alia by<br>
the intended application. Conventional quantities are for<br>
example quantities of 0.1 to 50 wt.% relative to rubber.<br>
Sulfur, organic sulfur donors or radical formers can serve<br>
as crosslinking agents. The rubber compounds according to<br>
the invention can additionally contain vulcanisation<br>
accelerators.<br>
Examples of suitable vulcanisation accelerators are<br>
mercaptobenzothiazoles, sulfenamides, guanidines,<br>
thiurams, dithiocarbamates, thio ureas and thiocarbonates.<br>
The vulcanisation accelerators and crosslinking agents can<br>
be used in quantities of 0.1 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.1 to<br>
5 wt.%, relative to rubber.<br>
The rubbers can be mixed with the silane-modified oxidic<br>
or siliceous filler according to the invention, optionally<br>
with precipitated silica and/or carbon black and/or other<br>
rubber auxiliary substances in conventional mixing units,<br>
such as rolls, internal mixers and compounding extruders.<br>
Such rubber compounds can conventionally be produced in<br>
internal mixers, whereby the rubbers, the silane-modified<br>
oxidic or siliceous filler according to the invention,<br>
optionally the precipitated silica and/or carbon black<br>
and/or other rubber auxiliary substances are first<br>
incorporated at 100 to 170°C in one or more successive<br>
thermomechanical mixing stages. The sequence in which the<br>
individual components are added and the time at which they<br>
are added can have a decisive impact on the compound<br>
properties obtained. The rubber compound thus obtained can<br>
then be mixed with the crosslinking chemicals by known<br>
means in an internal mixer or on a roll at 40-110°C and<br>
processed to form what is known as an unvulcanised mix for<br>
the subsequent process steps, such as moulding and<br>
vulcanisation for example.<br>
Vulcanisation of the rubber compounds according to the<br>
invention can take place at temperatures of 80 to 200°C,<br>
preferably 130 to 180°C, optionally under a pressure of 10<br>
to 200 bar.<br>
The rubber compounds according to the invention are<br>
suitable for producing rubber mouldings, for example for<br>
the production of pneumatic tyres for cars and lorries,<br>
tyre treads for cars and lorries, tyre components for cars<br>
and lorries, such as e.g. sidewall, liner and carcass,<br>
cable sheathing, hoses, drive belts, conveyor belts, roll<br>
coverings, bicycle and motor cycle tyres and components<br>
thereof, shoe soles, sealing rings, profiles and damping<br>
elements.<br>
In comparison to purely physical mixtures, for example of<br>
bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfane with silica<br>
(US-PS 4,076,550), the silane-modified oxidic or siliceous<br>
fillers according to the invention display the advantage<br>
of good storage stability and hence performance stability.<br>
In addition, the fillers according to the invention<br>
display a considerably lower content of potentially<br>
releasable alcohols, for example methanol or ethanol, than<br>
physical mixtures of silanes with fillers, are more<br>
readily dispersible and overall display better processing<br>
characteristics for users in the rubber processing<br>
industry (lower dust content, homogeneous compounding,<br>
reduction in mixing stages and mixing times, compounds<br>
with stable properties after the first mixing stage).<br>
In comparison to known silane-modified fillers, for<br>
example bis-(3-triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfane on<br>
silica (VP Coupsil 8108 from Degussa), the silane-modified<br>
oxidic or siliceous fillers according to the invention<br>
display the advantage of better storage stability and<br>
hence better performance stability. In addition, the<br>
fillers according to the invention display in comparison a<br>
considerably lower content of potentially releasable<br>
alcohol, generally ethanol, are more readily dispersible<br>
and overall display better processing characteristics for<br>
users in the rubber processing industry (lower dust<br>
content, homogeneous compounding, reduction in mixing<br>
stages and mixing times). Fewer volatile organic compounds<br>
(VOCs) are released during storage.<br>
As compared with the in-situ method and the untreated<br>
filler that this method requires, the silane-modified<br>
oxidic or siliceous fillers according to the invention<br>
have the advantages of an improved water content in the<br>
treated filler, a lower moisture absorption and a higher<br>
compacted bulk weight, better flow properties and a higher<br>
bulk density compared with the untreated filler.<br>
During the mixing process for the in-situ method a<br>
chemical reaction must be performed in which optimum<br>
process control is required and as a result of which<br>
considerable amounts of alcohol are liberated during the<br>
silanisation reaction. They subsequently escape from the<br>
mixture, thereby leading to problems in the exhaust air.<br>
This is reduced or avoided by the use of the silane-<br>
modified oxidic or siliceous fillers according to the<br>
invention.<br>
Microbeaded or microgranular materials mostly have<br>
elevated bulk densities, which has a positive impact on<br>
the cost effectiveness of transporting the raw material<br>
and product. In comparison to powdered silicas, the<br>
silanised microbeaded or microgranular fillers according<br>
to the invention have similarly advantageous flow and<br>
conveying properties to the microbeaded or microgranular<br>
fillers used as the starting material.<br>

Examples for the production of silane-modified oxidic or<br>
siliceous fillers according to the invention<br>
The experiments cited below are performed in a high-<br>
pressure extraction unit for solids with an autoclave<br>
volume of 50 1.<br>
8 kg of Ultrasil 7005 precipitated silica (Degussa AG;<br>
analytical properties: BET = 185 m2/g according to ISO<br>
5794/Anntex D, CTAB surface area = 173 m2/g, loss on drying<br>
= 5.5 wt.% (din ISO787-2), are physically precoated and<br>
mixed together with 640 g Si69 {Degussa AG? bis-<br>
(triethoxysilylpropyl tetrasulfane)) in a Ruberg mixer, In<br>
seme experiments additional amounts of. water are then<br>
sprayed onto the mixture of silica and silane.<br>
The silica that is physically precoated with Si69 is<br>
introduced into a charging vessel (volume 35 1), which is<br>
sealed at the top and bottom with sintering plates. The<br>
completely full charging vessel is placed in the autoclave<br>
of a high-pressure extraction unit (fixed bed), The<br>
autoclave is pressurised using a high-pressure diaphragm<br>
pump and defined quantities of carbon dioxide, Which is<br>
supplied by a high-pressure pump, are passed through at<br>
the pressures and temperatures set out in Tables 1-5 for<br>
fixed times. Primary reaction refers to the chemical<br>
and/or physical immobilisation of the silane on tne<br>
filler. Extraction refers to the partial/complete<br>
hydrolysis of the silane and removal of the alcohol. In<br>
some examples (Tables 4 and 5) a specific amount of water<br>
is metered into the stream of CO2 before it enters the<br>
autoclave. In addition, in the examples in Table 5,<br>
pressure pulses of between 60 and 100 bar are generated to<br>
improve the distribution of the silane on the surface of<br>
the silica. After the fixed bed extractor the loaded<br>
carbon dioxide is transferred to a separator tank in which<br>
it is converted into gaseous form by pressure reduction<br>
and/or temperature increase, whereby the solubility for<br>
the constituents of the fluid (e.g. extracted ethanol) is<br>
reduced and they are largely separated out as a result.<br>
After the separator tank the gaseous carbon dioxide is<br>
condensed by a condenser and passed to a buffer vessel,<br>
from which it can be drawn in again by the high-pressure<br>
pump and used for extraction (cyclic process).<br>
In examples 6 to 9 (Table 2) and 10 to 15 (Table 3) the<br>
carbon dioxide under the cited pressure and temperature<br>
conditions is not transferred to the separator tank but<br>
instead is circulated for a certain time by a bypass high-<br>
pressure pump, whilst maintaining pressure and<br>
temperature, by conveying it in a loop directly back to<br>
the autoclave. The stream is only transferred to the<br>
separator tank under the cited conditions - as shown in<br>
Tables 2 + 3 - to carry out the extraction.<br>
To demonstrate that the throughput direction for<br>
production of the filler according to the invention can be<br>
varied at will, in Examples 10 to 15 (Table 3) the<br>
throughput direction for the carbon dioxide is split, in<br>
other words in the cited ratios the carbon dioxide is<br>
passed through the autoclave alternately from below and<br>
from above, whereby the direction of flow, the throughput<br>
of carbon dioxide and the pressure and temperature<br>
conditions, as shown in Table 3, are maintained.<br>
The Sears numbers are determined by reference to G.W.<br>
Sears, Analyt. Chemistry 12 (1956) 1982 according to the<br>
following instructions:<br>
Before titration the filler is ground in a mill, whereby<br>
it is homogenised and crushed.<br>
60 ml of methanol are added to 2.5 g of the sample thus<br>
obtained in a 250 ml titration vessel and as soon as the<br>
solid is completely wetted a further 40 ml of water are<br>
added to the suspension.<br>
The suspension is dispersed for 30 sec with an agitator<br>
(Ultra-Turrax) and then diluted with a further 100 ml of<br>
water. The suspension is heated to 25°C for at least 20<br>
minutes.<br>
Titration is performed as follows on a titroprocessor<br>
with a pH electrode (e.g. DL 67, Mettler Toledo with a<br>
DG 111 SC electrode):<br>
- first stir for 120 sec;<br>
- adjust the suspension to pH 6 with 0.1 N potassium<br>
hydroxide solution or hydrochloric acid;<br>
- add 20 ml NaCl solution (250 g/1);<br>
- titrate with 0.1 N KOH from pH 6 to pH 9;<br>
- the result is converted to 5 g silica, i.e. to a<br>
consumption of 0.1 N KOH in ml per 5 g silica, in order<br>
to reach pH 9 from pH 6.<br>
The present determination is a further development, more<br>
accurate account and improvement of the method described<br>
in G.W. Sears, Analyt. Chemistry 12 (1956) 1982.<br>
The samples are dried for 15-20 h at 105°C and the BET<br>
surface area determined according to DIN 66131 (volumetric<br>
method).<br>
The samples were dried for 15-20 h at 105°C and the<br>
micropore volume determined by the t-plot method according<br>
to DIN 66135-2.<br>
The samples are dried for 15-20 h at 105°C and the<br>
mesopore distribution determined by the BJH method<br>
according to DIN 66134.<br>
The macropore volume (pores of widths &gt; 30 or &gt; 50 nm) is<br>
determined with an Autopore II 9220 mercury porosimeter<br>
(Micromeritics) in accordance with the generally known<br>
principles and operating instructions in the range up to<br>
400 mm. The samples are first dried for 15-20 h at 105°C.<br>
The method serves to determine the pore volume and the<br>
pore distribution in porous solids by measuring the volume<br>
of mercury pressed in under rising pressure using the<br>
method devised by Ritter and Drake according to DIN 66133.<br>
The pore maxima for mesopores and macropores can be read<br>
off directly from the corresponding graphs (cumulated<br>
intrusion volume (ml/g) and log. differential pore volume<br>
dV/dlog D) for the pore volume distribution (ml/g) as a<br>
function of the pore diameter (mm) .<br>
Determination of the bead distribution and bead fractions<br>
by screen analysis is performed as follows:<br>
The bead size distribution of preformed, granular,<br>
microgranular or microbeaded silicas is determined. To<br>
this end a defined amount of silica is separated with a<br>
stack of screens having a varying, standardised mesh<br>
width.<br>
The content of the individual bead fractions is determined<br>
by weighing. The following equipment is used: mechanical<br>
screening machine (Ro-tap); precision balance: accuracy ±<br>
0.01 g (Mettler)<br>
Standard screens U.S. Standard No. 120, height 25 mm, 0:<br>
200 mm; mesh widths: 300 mm (50 mesh); 150 mm (100 mesh);<br>
75 mm (200 mesh)<br>
The screens and a receiver are assembled in the specified<br>
sequence, in other words with apertures decreasing in size<br>
from the top to the bottom. 100 g of the sample to be<br>
examined is weighed out using an appropriate scoop.<br>
Preselecting the material by pouring or transferring the<br>
shaped silica out of the storage vessel should be avoided.<br>
After transferring the weighed out silica onto the<br>
uppermost screen a cover is placed on top and the stack<br>
placed into the screening machine in such a way that a<br>
clearance of approx. 1.5 mm remains to enable the screens<br>
to rotate freely.<br>
The screens are secured in the machine and then shaken for<br>
5 min - with the vibrator or knocker operating. The<br>
screens are then taken apart in turn and the amount of<br>
silica contained within each is weighed to an accuracy of<br>
0.1 g. A repeat determination is performed for each<br>
sample. The mean of the amounts of silica found in the<br>
individual screens and in the receiver is given in % in<br>
each case.<br>
The particle size distribution in the samples is<br>
determined by laser diffraction analysis without<br>
ultrasonic treatment using a Coulter LS 100 with dry<br>
powder module (Beckman-Coulter) in accordance with the<br>
generally known principles and operating instructions. A<br>
continuous stream of original, untreated particles from<br>
the sample to be measured is passed in an air jet through<br>
a laser beam for 60 sec. The stream of particles is<br>
penetrated by the laser and the various grain sizes<br>
(particle sizes) are detected and evaluated statistically.<br>
The minimum and maximum particle sizes that can be<br>
measured are 0.4 |im and 900 |im respectively.<br>
Determination of the particle size distribution after<br>
ultrasonic treatment (degradation behaviour of the<br>
samples) is performed by laser diffraction analysis using<br>
a Coulter LS 100 with microvolume module (Beckman-Coulter)<br>
in accordance with the generally known principles and<br>
operating instructions after the sample has been<br>
predispersed in ethanol and treated for 60 sec. in a<br>
closed screw-cap jar in an ultrasonic bath (US bath RK100,<br>
Bandelin). The minimum and maximum particle sizes that can<br>
be measured are 0.4 mm and 900 Jim respectively.<br>
In order to determine the average sulfur content in the<br>
samples, samples are taken from the autoclave trays at<br>
both ends of the tray and in the middle, and their sulfur<br>
content determined by known methods by:<br>
Schoniger digestion in an oxygen atmosphere (cf. F.<br>
Ehrenberger, S. Gorbauch, "Methoden der organischen<br>
Elementar- und Spurenanalyse", Verlag Chemie GmbH,<br>
Weinheim/BergstraSe, 1973) and<br>
subsequent ion-chromatographic analysis (ion<br>
chromatograph 690 from Metrohm; PRP X-100 column from<br>
Hamilton; mobile solvent: 2 mmol salicylate buffer,<br>
pH 7) according to DIN ISO 10304-2.<br>
The average sulfur content in the overall sample is then<br>
obtained as the arithmetic mean of the 3 values for<br>
individual samples determined in this way.<br>
The water content in the samples is determined as follows:<br>
10 g of the silanised silica are crushed for 15 seconds in<br>
a coffee grinder and the water content is then determined<br>
in accordance with the known principles that are familiar<br>
to the person skilled in the art using a Karl Fischer<br>
titrator (Metrohm, 720 KFS Titrino) and the Karl Fischer<br>
titration chemicals no. 1.09241, no. 1.09243 and no.<br>
1.06664 (disodium tartrate dihydrate) available from<br>
Merck.<br>
The carbon content in the samples is determined by known<br>
standard methods using a CS-244 carbon/sulfur determinator<br>
from LECO.<br>
By reference to the procedure described in Kautschuk,<br>
Gummi, Kunststoffe 51, (1998) 525 by Hunsche et al. the<br>
residual alcohol (ethanol) on the filler is determined as<br>
follows:<br>
10 ml diethylene glycol monobutyl ether (DEGMBE) and<br>
0.3 ml 0.5 mol/1 H2SO4 are added to 1 g of the filler<br>
according to the invention in a glass ampoule that is<br>
closed with a tight-fitting cap after being filled. The<br>
mixture is thoroughly mixed in the glass ampoule for 20<br>
min at 60°C in a water bath. 10 ml decane are then added<br>
to the mixture, the temperature of which has been rapidly<br>
adjusted to 25°C. Appropriate amounts are then removed<br>
from the thoroughly mixed organic phase for HPLC analysis<br>
(HPLC device with Jasco 851-AS autosampler, Jasco PU 980<br>
pump, 7515A RI detector; TiO2 column, 250x4.5 mm, 5 |im,<br>
YMC; mobile phase: DEGMBE with cyclohexane; temperature<br>
25°C) on ethanol.<br>
The shape factor and circle factor of the samples is<br>
determined as follows:<br>
REM analyses of pulverised powders of the fillers<br>
according to the invention are performed on a Jeol JSM<br>
6400 scanning electron microscope and analysed on-line<br>
using the image analysis software Analysis 3.2 from SIS<br>
(soft imaging software) in accordance with the<br>
conventional principles and procedures known to the person<br>
skilled in the art:<br>
Circle factor (FCIRCLE)<br>
The circle factor (FCIRCLE) indicates by how much the<br>
particle shape differs from the ideal circular shape.<br>
4p(Area)<br>
FCIRCLE = P2<br>
(1.0 for circular, 
Area = area of a particle, calculated from the number of<br>
pixels that fall on a particle and the partial area of one<br>
pixel<br>
P = perimeter (i.e. the circumference of the more or less<br>
complex particle)<br>
Shape factor (FSHAPE)<br>
D MIN<br>
Shape factor FSHAPE = D MAX<br>
The shape factor (FSHAPE) indicates by how much the<br>
particle shape differs from the ideal circular shape by<br>
considering 2 possible diameters of a particle (D min, D<br>
max) .<br>

in rubber compounds<br>
Production of rubber compounds<br>
The formulation used for the rubber compounds is shown in<br>
Table 14 below. The unit phr denotes contents by weight,<br>
relative to 100 parts of the crude rubber used. The<br>
general method for producing rubber compounds and<br>
vulcanisates thereof is described in the following book:<br>
"Rubber Technology Handbook", W. Hofmann, Hanser Verlag<br>
1994.<br><br>
The polymer VSL 5025-1 is a solution-polymerised SBR<br>
copolymer from Bayer AG with a styrene content of 25 wt.%<br>
and a butadiene content of 75 wt.%. 73 % of the butadiene<br>
is 1,2-linked, 10 % cis-1,4-linked and 17 % trans-1,4-<br>

displays a Mooney viscosity (ML l+4/100°C) of 50 ±4.<br>
The polymer Buna CB 24 is a cis-1,4-polybutadiene<br>
(neodymium-type) from Bayer AG with a cis-1,4 content of<br>
97 %, a trans-1,4 content of 2 %, a 1,2 content of 1 % and<br>
a Mooney viscosity of 44 ±5.<br>
Naftolen ZD from Chemetall is used as the aromatic oil.<br>
Vulkanox 4020 is a 6PPD from Bayer AG and Protector G35P<br>
is an anti-ozonant wax from HB-Fuller GmbH. Vulkacit D<br>
(DPG) and Vulkacit CZ (CBS) are commercial products from<br>
Bayer AG.<br>
The coupling reagent Si 69 is a bis-(triethoxysilyl<br>
propyl) tetrasulfane from Degussa AG. Ultrasil 7005 is a<br>
beaded, readily dispersible precipitated silica from<br>
Degussa AG with a BET surface area of 185 m2/g. Ultrasil<br>
VN 3 is also a precipitated silica from Degussa AG with a<br>
BET surface area of 175 m2/g. VP Coupsil 8108 is a known<br>
silane-modified filler and is available from Degussa AG as<br>
an experimental product. It is the silica Ultrasil VN 3,<br>
presilanised with 8 parts by weight of Si 69 per 100 parts<br>
by weight of Ultrasil VN 3.<br>
The rubber compounds are produced in an internal mixer<br>
according to the mixing instructions in Table 15.<br>
The rubber test methods are summarised in Table 16.<br><br>
Compound examples 1 to 4<br>
In compound examples 1 to 4 the reference mixture mixed in<br>
situ (formulation A) with 6.4 phr of the coupling reagent<br>
Si 69 is compared with four compounds (formulation B) with<br>
the silane-modified silicas according to the invention as<br>
reproduced in Table 17.<br><br>
Examples for the production of the fillers according to<br>
the invention were described in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.<br>
The formulations used (A) and (B) are set out in Table 14<br>
and the mixing instructions used are shown in Table 15.<br>
The results of the rubber tests are summarised in Tables<br>
18 to 21.<br>
Table 18<br>
As can be seen from the data in Tables 18 to 21, the<br>
viscosities ML (1+4) and the vulcanisation characteristics<br>
5 of the example compounds are at a similar level to those<br>
of the in-situ reference compounds. The static and dynamic<br>
rubber data is comparable within the limits of<br>
conventional variations in rubber tests. The consistently<br>
higher value for the reinforcing factor RF 300%/100% for<br>
10 the example compounds in comparison to the in-situ<br>
reference compounds indicates a higher silica-silane<br>
bonding. This all clearly shows that the use of the silica<br>
according to the invention leads to rubber properties that<br>
are comparable with or tend to be better than those of the<br>
in-situ reference. This cannot be achieved with silanised<br>
fillers corresponding to the prior art.<br>
Compound example: prior art<br>
The compound example for the prior art shows that as<br>
compared with the in-situ reference compound (formulation<br>
C) the rubber properties deteriorate when the commercial<br>
presilanised silica VP Coupsil 8108 (formulation D) is<br>
used. Formulations (C) and (D) are based on the<br>
formulations shown in Table 14. In a variation of the<br>
mixing instructions used in formulations (A) and (B) and<br>
set out in Table 14, in this example the second mixing<br>
stage is mixed at an initial speed of 80 rpm and a<br>
throughput temperature of 80°C. This is only a minor<br>
deviation, however. The results are set out in Table 22.<br><br>
The values from Table 22 show that the high level of the<br>
in-situ reference compound is not achieved when the known,<br>
presilanised silica VP Coupsil 8108 is used. Both the<br>
higher Mooney viscosity and the higher Shore-A hardness<br>
indicate an unsatisfactorily homogeneous silanisation,<br>
leading to a higher filler network in compound (D). The<br>
reinforcing factor RF 300%/100% for compound (D) also<br>
drops significantly as compared with reference (C).<br>
The advantage of using the silicas according to the<br>
invention lies in the fact that in contrast to the known<br>
in-situ silanisation used according to the prior art with<br>
liquid silanes, such as e.g. Si 69, there is no need to<br>
perform a chemical reaction, requiring an optimum process<br>
control, during the mixing process. Furthermore, in the<br>
known in-situ silanisation considerable amounts of alcohol<br>
are disadvantageously liberated, which escape from the<br>
compound and thus lead to problems in the exhaust air.<br>
The compound examples clearly show that the use in rubber<br>
of the presilanised silicas according to the invention<br>
results in properties that are comparable to or better<br>
than in-situ silanisation according to the prior art,<br>
without causing the aforementioned disadvantages such as<br>
arise in the known in-situ silanisation. By contrast,<br>
although the cited problem of ethanol evolution during<br>
mixing is avoided with the use of commercial presilanised<br>
silicas, such as e.g. VP Coupsil 8108, the high technical<br>
standard of the in-situ reference is not achieved.<br>
