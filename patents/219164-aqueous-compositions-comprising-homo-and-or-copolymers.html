The fatty acids can also be synthetically prepared (e.g., by oxidation of petroleum stocks or by the Fischer-Tropsch process).<br>
Alkali metal soaps can be made by direct saponification of the fats and oils or by the neutralization of the free fatty acids which are prepared in a separate manufacturing process.

The tallow can also be hardened (i.e., hydrogenated) to convert part or all of the unsaturated fatty acid moieties to saturated fatty acid moieties.

following components:<br>

0.13g	of a sequesterant<br>
0.0044g     of potassium bromate<br>
0.06125g   of 2,2-azobis(2-amidinopropane)dihydrochloride<br>
and water.<br>
A continuous 'oil phase1 is prepared by admixing together the following components:<br><br>
300g   of Exxsol® D40 (dearomatised hydrocarbon solvent) 2g       a polymeric stabilizer<br>
The continuous phase was deoxygenated by nitrogen gas for 20 minutes. Afterwards, the phase was agitated with a Rushton turbine stirrer at 400 rpm.<br>
The monomer solution was then added to the agitated continuous phase and allowed to disperse for 3 minutes. The temperature of the suspension was adjusted to 25°C. The suspension was initiated by addition of Sulphur dioxide in Solvent D40 (0.656 ml of a 1%vol/vol solution).<br>
When the exothermic reaction was completed, water was azeotroped off the suspension under reduced pressure. The resulting suspension of polymer beads was cooled to 25°C, filtered and air-dried. The obtained particle size of the polymer beads is about 240fim. The size is measured with a Sympatec HELOS laser diffraction apparatus (from Sympatec GmbH, Germany).<br>

In analogy to the synthesis of Example 1 the following polymers are synthesized.<br>
