Title of the Invention<br>
PLATE-MAKING METHOD AND PLATE-MAKING APPARATUS FOR STENCIL<br>
PRINTING AND STENCIL PRINTING MACHINE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a thermal plate-<br>
making for stencil printing, especially, the plate-making<br>
method and the plate-making apparatus for ster.ril printing<br>
and the stencil printing machine which realize plate-making<br>
by using a stencil plate material consisting only of a<br>
thermoplastic resin film substantially without ink-<br>
pereable supporters, such as Japanese paper<br>
fabric etc. In addition, the above expression of<br>
"consisting only of a thermoplastic resin film<br>
substantially" intends to include such a construction of<br>
the film that antistatic coating and weld prevention<br>
coating may be given on a surface of the film, on condition<br>
that it have no ink-permeable supporter.<br>
Background Art<br>
Conventionally, a stencil sheet, which is utilized for<br>
a stencil plate in stencil printing, generally comprises an<br>
ink-permeable supporter and a thermoplastic resin film<br>
which is stuck on the supporter with adhesives. The ink-<br>
permeable supporter is made of Japanese paper or nonwoven<br>
fabric and the like. The thermoplastic resin film is made<br><br>
from polyester and the like. A thickness of the<br>
thermoplastic resin film is 1.5 µ m to generally a<br>
thickness of the supporter being about 30-40 µ m. Printing<br>
is performed by taking out ink from a stencil plate which<br>
is formed by thermally perforating the film. Said thermal<br>
perforation is mainly performed by heating of a thermal<br>
head, namely, said stencil sheet is inserted between the<br>
thermal head and a platen roller, and then is heated by the<br>
thermal head.<br>
Respect to stencil printing performed by using such a<br>
stencil plate made or engraved by the above mentioned<br>
method, from before, various inconveniences or<br>
disadvantages of using the stencil plate which is stuck the<br>
thermoplastic resin film with adhesives, are mentioned.<br>
Meanwhile, various improvement proposals, which constitute<br>
a stencil plate only of a thermoplastic resin film without<br>
supporters, are proposed. However, none of the proposals<br>
has resulted in utilization now, and any proposals must<br>
overcome certain technical problems. When the stencil plate<br>
particularly is constituted only of a thermoplastic resin<br>
film, it is hard to deal with the stencil plate if a<br>
thickness of the film is not made to some extent thick. In<br>
addition, it is necessary to enlarge an output force of the<br>
thermal head in order to carry out thermally perforating at<br>
the thick film. That caused various problems and has become<br><br>
the greatest difficulty of utilization.<br>
On the other hand, it is preferable that perforations<br>
of the stencil plate made in stencil printing are<br>
perforated independently for every dot, and for that, it is<br>
desirable to make heater size as small as possible to a dot<br>
pitch as shown in the Japanese examined patent publication<br>
No.2732532. However, corresponding to a size of the heater<br>
becoming snail, an influence of a heat diffusion which the<br>
heater receives from the circumference electrodes becomes<br>
large, thereby, a thermal efficiency of the thermal head<br>
falls down and a life of the thermal head becomes short.<br>
Furthermore, with respect to a thin film type thermal head,<br>
since an exctnermic portion is dented compared with a<br>
surrounding electrode, the stencil sheet will be supported<br>
by high electrode sections around of the dented portion<br>
according to the size of the heater becoming small.<br>
Therefore, a contact state or an adhesion state between the<br>
exothermic portion and the stencil sheet becomes bad, and<br>
thermal efficiency falls increasingly.<br>
Moreover, in order to solve the above-mentioned<br>
problem about aggravation of the contact state between the<br>
exothermic portion and the stencil sheet by the size of the<br>
heater becoming small, the thermal head so called a<br>
"partial glaze type" which raises only the exothermic<br>
portion by glaze is proposed.<br><br>
However, even if the thermal head is the partial glaze<br>
type, since an upheaval of the partial glaze is very smooth,<br>
the raising curve also turns into a straight line in<br>
approximation. After all, it becomes not impossible to<br>
fully solve the problem of the adhesion.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
As mentioned above, the problem of the stencil sheet<br>
for stencil printing and the problem of the thermal head<br>
for stencil printing are independent respectively. The<br>
present invention is originated that those problems should<br>
be solved in simultaneous. Therefore, the present inventicr.<br>
tends as provide with a method of an apparatus for plate-<br>
making and a stencil paper printing machine can<br>
realise a stencil plate printing by constituting the<br>
stencil sheet(plate) only of a thermoplastic resin film, in<br>
a stencil plate printing.<br>
Means for Solving the Problem<br>
First, the plate-making method for stencil printing<br>
according to the present invention solves the technical<br>
problems of the conventional arts, and in order to attain<br>
the purpose of it, it is constituted as follows. Namely,<br>
the plate-making method for stencil printing according to<br>
the present invention which forms ink-permeable openings by<br>
thermally fusing a heat-sensitive stencil plate material<br>
for stencil printing which consists of an extended<br><br>
Thermoplastic resin film with a predetermined thickness is<br>
characterized in that: a tensile stress at the time of<br>
extension is internally remained and many minute recesses<br>
are formed on one side surface of the above film, an<br>
opposite side surface to the minute recess side of the film<br>
is heated by the thermal head, an energy output of the<br>
thermal head for heating sufficiently satisfies to fuse-<br>
penetrate a thin closing portion of the minute recess, but<br>
it is restricted to the range which does not fuse-perforate<br>
a thick portion except the recess portion of the film, so<br>
that said openings are formed by the heated fused portion<br>
communicating with the minute recess.<br>
Two or more heaters are arranged in the main<br>
direction at one sequence or tier on the thermal. When<br>
a main scanning side array pitch cf the heater is set to PM<br>
a main scanning side heater length is set to HM, a sub<br>
scanning side delivery pitch is set to PS and a sub<br>
scanning side heater length is set to HS, it is desirable<br>
that a size of the heater satisfies HM&gt;0.6PM and HS&gt;0.7PS.<br>
It is desirable that an impression energy of the<br>
thermal head is below into the 35mile- joule/mm2 in this<br>
plate-making.<br>
Moreover, in this plate-making method, the stencil<br>
plate material consists of an extended film in which a<br>
tensile stress at the time of extension is remains.<br><br>
Therefore, when the heated portion begins to melt, a base<br>
of the melting portion is communicated with the minute<br>
recess, so that the ink-permeable perforation is formed by<br>
the remained stress.<br>
Furthermore, in this method for stencil printing, it<br>
is desirable that the stencil plate material is constituted<br>
of an extended polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) film or an<br>
extended low melting pcint film by copolymerizing<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene<br>
terephthalate (PBT) , and when a working temperature is set<br>
to mºC, a melting point of the film is to set mºC and a<br>
glass transition point is set to g°C,' it is preferable that<br>
the templating (or impressing) is performed by P Pa of<br>
working pressure force of 104X102 (m-t)/(m-g) or more.<br>
The minute recess may be a penetrated hole of which a<br>
diameter of an opening on the heated side of the film is<br>
smaller than a diameter of an opening on the opposite side<br>
to said heated side, and the diameter the opening on the<br>
heated side is small not to permit ink-permeating.<br>
Moreover, the minute recess may be a dent which<br>
reduces the thickness of the film partially and forms a<br>
thin closing portion.<br>
Next, the plate-making apparatus for stencil printing<br>
according to the present invention is constituted as<br>
follows. Namely, the apparatus comprises a plate feed<br><br>
section which feeds the heat-sensitive stencil plate<br>
material consisting of an extended thermoplastic resin film<br>
with a predetermined thickness, a means to form many minute<br>
recesses on one side surface of the film, and a heating<br>
means to form ink-permeable openings in the film by heating<br>
the film, in which an opposite side surface to the minute<br>
recess side of the film is heated by the heating means, a<br>
tensile stress at the time of extension is internally<br>
remained in said thermoplastic resin film, an energy output<br>
of the heating means for heating sufficiently satisfies tc<br>
fuse-penetrate a main closing portion of the minute recess,<br>
but it is restricted to the range which does not fuse-<br>
penetrate a thin portion except the recess portion of the<br>
film, so that said openings are formed by the heated fused<br>
portion communicating the minute recess.<br>
This heating means is a thermal head on which two or<br>
more heaters are arranged in the main scanning direction at<br>
one sequence or tier, and when a main scanning side array<br>
pitch of the heater is set to PM, a main scanning side<br>
heater length is set to HM, a sub scanning side delivery<br>
pitch is set to PS and a sub scanning side heater length is<br>
set to HS, it is desirable that a size of the heater<br>
satisfies HM&gt;0.6PM and HS&gt;0.7PS and an output energy of the<br>
thermal head is below into the 35mili-joule /mm2.<br>
Of course, it is also possible to constitute the<br><br>
stencil printing machine equipped with the above plate-making<br>
apparatus for stencil printing as a plate-making section.<br>
Also, in any case of the plate-making apparatus and the stencil<br>
printing machine, the minute recess can be made into a penetrated hole<br>
that a diameter of an opening on the heated side of the film is smaller<br>
than a diameter of an opening on the opposite side to said heated side,<br>
and the diameter the opening on the heated side is small not to permit<br>
ink-permeating.<br>
(more utilized effects than the prior art)<br>
The present invention makes it possible to thermally perforating<br>
individual ink-permeable openings in the film independently without<br>
increasing an output of a thermal head, and it realizes the stencil<br>
printing by using the stencil plate material consisting only of a<br>
thermoplastic resin film. Thereby, the problem about the stencil sheet<br>
(stencil plate material) and the problem about the thermal head are<br>
solved simultaneously.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Referring to Fig.l to Fig. 9, embodiments of the<br>
plate-making method and the apparatus for stencil printing<br>
and the stencil printing machine according to the present<br>
invention will be described hereunder. Fig.l is an outline<br><br>
drawing illustrating the plate-making method for stencil<br>
printing according to the present invention. In Fig.l, the<br>
numeral 10 designates a thermal head, and the numeral 11<br>
designates a platen roller. A stencil sheet 12 consisting<br>
of an extended polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) film is<br>
sent to the right-side from the left-side in the direction<br>
of an arrow of Fig.l. Although Fig.l is an enlarged<br>
sectional view, an actual size of each composition, for<br>
example a thickness of the stencil sheet 12 is about<br>
several µ m, and a length of a heater section 13 of the<br>
thermal head 10 is about 10 µ m to 20 and several µ m in a<br>
several sheet direction. Moreover, although the platen<br>
rather. It is partially shown in Fig.l, it is a rubber<br>
roller which has a diameter about 20mm.<br>
In addition, other thermoplastic resin usable as the<br>
film is mentioned, for example, polyethylene-terephthalate<br>
resin, polyethylene resin, polyvinyl chloride resin,<br>
polyvinylidene chloride resin, poly methyl pentene resin,<br>
polypropylene resin, polyethylene-naphthalate resin,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol resin, nylon 6. When using especially a<br>
polyester film, it is preferable to use the above<br>
polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) film, a polyethylene-<br>
terephthalate (PET) film with 20% or less of crystallinity,<br>
an extended low melting point film by copolymerizing<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polybutylene<br><br>
terephthalate (PBT), or a low melting point film by<br>
copolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with 20% or<br>
less of crystallinity and polybutylene(PBT).<br>
Many minute or micro recesses 14 are formed on one<br>
side surface of the stencil sheet 12 by random arrangement.<br>
Said side is in contact with the platen roller 11. Fig.l<br>
shows a state where the thermal head 10 is electrified so<br>
that a portion of the stencil sheet 12, which is in contact<br>
with the heater section 13, is perforated. The stencil<br>
sheet 12 is penetrated by fusing a bottom of the minute<br>
recess 14, and an ink permeable opening is formed. Thus,<br>
the ink permeable opening can be formed in a desired part<br>
to make plate of controlling an electrification to the<br>
heater section 18 of the thermal head 11, whether ON or OFF.<br>
Thus, since the minute recesses 14 are formed on the<br>
one side surface of the film stencil sheet 12, when the<br>
stencil sheet 12 is heated and perforated from an opposite<br>
side of it, it will become possible to form ink-permeable<br>
openings by fusing and penetrating only the bottom portion<br>
of the recess 14, without penetrating all the thickness of<br>
the film.<br>
A density in which the minute recess 14 is formed can<br>
be changed according to desired resolution. As for the<br>
density of the recesses 14, it is suitable that a rate of<br>
opening becomes about 5-30% per 1 dot, to bring beautiful<br><br>
printing, and prevent . a back projection and a strike-<br>
through. That is, the area of the film which is in contact<br>
with one heater section 13 of the thermal head 10 is<br>
equivalent to 1 dot of a matrix and it must to arrange at<br>
least one minute recess 14 in the area.<br>
Moreover, although an array of the minute recess 14<br>
may be regular, it is preferable that the array is<br>
irregular within fixed limits responding to a desired rate<br>
of opening so as to prevent a phenomenon of "moire". The<br>
phenomenon of "moire" means that a shade of ink appears in<br>
the shape of stripes on a print sheet. In the case of any,<br>
the average pitch of the minute recess 14 is set finer than<br>
the array pitch of the heater section 18 of the thermal<br>
head 10.<br>
Fig. 2 is a plan view showing an array state of the<br>
heater section of the thermal head. Two or more heaters are<br>
arranged to main scanning direction at the single tier, and<br>
the main scanning side array pitch of the heater is PM, the<br>
main scanning side heater length of it is HM, the sub<br>
scanning side delivery pitch of it is PS, and the sub<br>
scanning side heater length is HS. In this case, the main<br>
scanning side heater length is longer than 0.6 times of the<br>
main scanning side array pitch, and the sub scanning side<br>
heater length is longer than 0.7 times of the sub scanning<br>
side array pitch.' Even if the heater size becomes such<br><br>
large size, a perforation does not become large in<br>
connection with it. It is the reason that the plate-making<br>
is performed in use a stencil sheet material consisting<br>
only of a thermoplastic resin film which have the many<br>
minute recesses on one side surface of it, and the output<br>
energy of the thermal head for heating sufficiently<br>
satisfies to fuse a thin closing portion of the minute<br>
recess, but it is restricted to the range which does not<br>
fuse-perforate a thick portion except the recess portion of<br>
the film. If a perforation equal to the heater size is<br>
formed carried out like the conventional plate-making<br>
recess of the conventional stencil, a diameter of the<br>
perforation becomes large in connection with the hearer-<br>
size becoming large, finally, the perforation is<br>
communicated with the next perforation. In such case, even<br>
if the "O" character is printed, the character may be<br>
smeared away like "●.".<br>
The output energy of the thermal head is below 35mili<br>
joule/mm2 at the time of plate-making. The above<br>
perforations are independent altogether since they are<br>
formed using the recesses. Fig.3 shows a state of the<br>
stencil plate which is perforated by making the heater of a<br>
position which expresses "1" of a number according to this<br>
plate-making method generate heat. Some perforations which<br>
are perforated by heating of the thermal head are smeared<br><br>
away black. Thus, since each perforation can be formed<br>
independently without making the heater size small, a large<br>
size' heater with sufficient thermal efficiency also with<br>
little influence of thermal diffusion can be adopted. If<br>
the heater size can furthermore be enlarged, a contact<br>
nature between the film and the heater can be improved by<br>
fully taking advantage of the effect of raising by the<br>
heater (heating element) of the partial glaze type, and a<br>
thermal efficiency will become still better. Especially,<br>
since the heater size in the sub scanning direction is<br>
enlarged, the merit, (improvement of the contact nature by<br>
raising; of using the partial glate type becomes large.<br>
Fig 4 is a sectional perspective view showing the<br>
stencil sheet 12 in which the minute recess is a penetrated<br>
hole, but said hole is small not to permit ink permeability.<br>
Although an opening 21 on a surface 20 which is heated at<br>
the time of plate-making is so small not to permit ink<br>
permeability, an opening 23 on a surface 22 of an opposite<br>
side may be larger than it, and may be large so that the<br>
ink enter into the minute recess 14. In addition, Fig. 3<br>
shows a situation that the minute recess 14 is formed in<br>
the shape of a dent with a thin bottom 24.<br>
Moreover, when the minute recess 14 is formed in the<br>
shape of the dent, it is preferable that the thickness of<br>
the thin bottom 24 is about 80% or less of the thickness of<br><br>
the film, but said the thickness rate depends on material<br>
of the film. In addition, a residual stress may be occurred<br>
at the time of the extension of the film, and said stress<br>
may concentrates on the minute recess of the surface to<br>
urge opening, in that case, it is effective also in the<br>
recess of about 20% of the depth of the film thickness. On<br>
the other hand, when little residual stress is occurred at<br>
the time of the extension of the film, it is necessary to<br>
make the depth of the recess deep (for the thickness of the<br>
thin bottom to be thin), in that case, it is preferable<br>
that the thickness of the thin bottom is about 2 µ m or less.<br>
Following experiments were carried out in order to<br>
search for the proper heater size of the thermal head and<br>
plate-making energy of the thermal head. The used film is<br>
an extended low melting point film by copolymerization with<br>
a. thickness of 6 µ m of PET and PBT. Photo etching with a<br>
depth of 18 µ m is performed to a surface of a stainless<br>
steel board with the thickness of 0.2mm, thereby, such<br>
templating material can be obtained that has many circular<br>
minute projections having a diameter of 40 µ m and a height<br>
of 18 µ m, and arranged in 30 µ m pitch each other's. Each<br>
above-mentioned film was put on said templating material,<br>
respectively, and was passed through between a pair of iron<br>
rollers with the diameter of 100mm and the length of 200mm<br>
length. The working temperature is set to 25 °C , and the<br><br>
working pressure between rollers is set to 200 million Pa<br>
(2t/mm2) . The thermal head used in experiments is as<br>
follows.<br>
Thermal head A: 400DPI of partial glaze, the heater<br>
size in the main scanning direction is 30 µ m and the<br>
heater size in the sub scanning direction is 40 µ m.<br>
Thermal head B: 400DPI of partial glaze, the heater size in<br>
the main scanning direction is 30 µ m and the heater size<br>
in the sub scanning direction is 80 µ m. Thermal head C:<br>
400DPI of partial glaze, the heater size in the main<br>
scanning direction is 47 µ m and the heater size in the<br>
sub scanning direction is 80µ m. Thermal head D: 400DPI of<br>
partial glaze, the heater size in the main scanning<br>
direction is 47 µ m and the heater size in the sub<br>
scanning direction is 100 µ m. The plate-making tests were<br>
carried out according to such conditions that the repeat<br>
period per line was set to 2mSec(s), the printing pulse<br>
width was set to 500 µ Sec, and the output energy was set to<br>
10-35mili-joule/mm2. Table 1 shows the experimental result.<br>
In this case, said output energy means an energy consumed<br>
by 1 time of the pulse, per 1mm2 of the heater of the<br>
thermal head. When an applied voltage of the heater is set<br>
to V(bolt), an electric resistance of the heater is set to<br>
R (ohm), the main scanning direction length of the heater<br>
is set to HM (mm), the sub scanning direction length of the<br><br>
heater is set to HS (mm) , a pulse width is set to T (Sec)<br>
and an energy per 1mm2 is set to E(joule), said joule E is<br>
expressed with E=T (V2/R)/(HM • HS) .<br><br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br><br>
In the above evaluation, X mark, ▼ mark, Omark and<br>
© mark are given based on each state after plate-making.<br>
The X mark means an unclear perforation. Namely, after<br>
plate-making, any of perforations by heating of the thermal<br>
head could not make ink permeate.<br>
'The ▼ mark means that the perforations by heating of<br>
the thermal head could make ink permeate but the number of<br>
perforations is not enough.<br>
The C mark means that the perforations by heating of<br>
the termal head were clear, but. the number of the<br>
perforations is eno.ugh after plate-making.<br>
The © mark means clear perforation. Namely, after<br>
plate-making, the perforations by heating of the thermal<br>
head were clear and make ink permeate.<br>
The above O also means that some perforations were<br>
occurred in part besides the recesses by an excessive<br>
energy. Namely, that considers as an excessive perforating.<br>
Tne above T mark also means that some perforations<br>
were occurred in wide part besides the recesses by an<br>
excessive energy, and some of them were connected each<br>
other. Namely, that considers as an excessive perforating.<br>
The above X mark also means that some perforations<br><br>
were occurred in wide part besides the recesses by an<br>
excessive energy, and all of them were connected each other<br>
Namely, that considers as an excessive perforating.<br>
When the main, scanning side array pitch of the heater<br>
is set to PM, the main scanning side heater length is set<br>
to HM, the sub scanning side delivery pitch is set to PS<br>
and the sub scanning side heater length is set to HS, it<br>
can be understood that the plate-making in which the<br>
thermal head C and D filling the condition formula of the<br>
heater "HM&gt;0.6PM and HS&gt;0.7PS" is used is excellent<br>
compared with the plate-making in which the thermal head A<br>
and 'B not filling the above condition formula is used.<br>
Moreover, when the plate-making, energy is carried out more<br>
than the 30mili- joule/mm2, the whole film is fuse-<br>
penetrated to become indistinct plate-making.<br>
Next, a method for forming the minute 14 on the<br>
stencil sheet 12 which consists of a thermoplastic resin<br>
film, is described hereunder. A templating or embossing of<br>
the film is performed by forcing projections on one side<br>
surface of the film. For example, a file-like thing to<br>
which many particles of diamond are adhered, can be also<br>
used to be forced against the thermoplastic resin film with<br>
a predetermined thickness. It is generally difficult to<br>
force the projection on a thin film-like sheet so as to<br>
form a penetrated hole. In that case, usually, a layer of<br><br>
pellicle state remains on the opposite side of a projection<br>
forcing side (namely, it becoming a dent which forms a thin<br>
bottom), or it is forced only against the grade in which an<br>
opening about a crack (a small opening of the grade which<br>
does not permit ink permeability) is formed slightly. If it<br>
is processed using this property, the suitable minute<br>
recess will be formed on a processing side. Consequently,<br>
even if the minute recess reaches the surface of the<br>
opposite side, the opening will not become the extent that<br>
ink permeability is permitted.<br>
Fig.6 and 7 shows an embodiment for forming the minute<br>
recesses 14. Templating Rollers 32, 32 and supporting<br>
rollers 35, 36 are arranged so that they counter mutually,<br>
the. surface of the templating rollers 32, 33 have uneven<br>
surfaces to wnich many particles are adhered, the surface<br>
of the supporting rollers 35, 36 have smooth surfaces. The<br>
thermoplastic resin film 12 with a fixed thickness is<br>
inserted between the rollers 32 and 35 or between rollers<br>
33 and 36 that are both rotating. The minute recesses 14<br>
are formed on the side surface of the thermoplastic resin<br>
film which is contact with the templating rollers 32 or 33<br>
by templating, and the shape of each recess becomes the<br>
same as the shape of each particle.<br>
As sown in Fig. 7, when the recesses are formed the<br>
templating roller 33 to which the particles 31 having<br><br>
comparatively round noses are adhered, the minute recess 14<br>
does not reach even the opposite side surface of the film.<br>
On the other hand, as sown in Fig. 6, when the recesses 14<br>
are formed the templating roller 32 to which the particles<br>
31 having a comparatively sharpened nose, the minute recess<br>
14 may reach the opposite side surface of the film. However,<br>
in such case, the recess 14 does not become as large as an<br>
ink-permeable opening.<br>
Furthermore, Fig.8 and 9 shows an embodiment for<br>
forming the minute recesses 14 on a polyester film sheet.<br>
In Fig.8, a pair of rollers 30 and' 31 are arranged so that<br>
they counter mutually. One roller 31 is used as a<br>
templating roller, and minute projections are formed on a<br>
peripheral face perimeter of the roller 31. Another roller<br>
30 is a supporting roller with a smooth peripheral face.<br>
The templating is performed by inserting the thermoplastic<br>
resin film 12 with a fixed thickness between the templating<br>
roller 31 and the supporting roller 30 which rotate in the<br>
direction of an arrow. Working conditions shall fulfill<br>
above-mentioned conditions.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a concept of an alternative method and<br>
apparatus for producing the stencil plate material. A metal<br>
belt 134 is built over between rollers 135 and 136 which<br>
rotate and drive. The metal belt 134 has minute projections<br>
133 on the peripheral face perimeter of it. Moreover, a<br><br>
supporting roller 37, which has a smooth peripheral facing<br>
the roller 135, is arranged. The templating processing is<br>
performed by inserting the thermoplastic resin film 12 with<br>
a fixed thickness between the metal belt 134 and the<br>
supporting roller 137. Working conditions shall fulfill<br>
above-mentioned conditions.<br>
One example for forming the minute projections 132 on<br>
the roller 131 of Fig.8 is shown below. After carrying out<br>
plasma jet flame coating of the ceramic to the material<br>
face (peripheral face) of the metal roller, the face of the<br>
metal roller can be ground, and many minute projections 132<br>
can be further formed by laser engraving. A pitch of the<br>
minute projection 132 is preferable to 100 µ m or less,<br>
more preferable to 30 µ m or less. A depth of laser<br>
engraving is set to 3-40 µ m, the minute projections 132 of<br>
70 - 200 of height of film thickness are formed on the<br>
roller 131, thus the roller 131 is made as a templating<br>
roller.<br>
The 1st advantage using a roller as a templating body<br>
is that surface hardening is easy compared with the case<br>
where it considers as a belt. In other words, the belt<br>
coated by ceramic is difficult to use due to a lack of<br>
flexibility, however, in the case of the roller,<br>
flexibility is not required. The 2nd advantage using a<br>
roller as an embossing body is that highly precise endless<br><br>
processing is easy. It is difficult to carry out endless<br>
processing welding of the belt so that the surface micro-<br>
processing pattern continues.<br>
One example for forming the minute projections 133 on<br>
the metal belt 134 of Fig. 9 will be described as follows.<br>
Many minute projections 133 can be formed in the metal<br>
plate with a thickness of 0.lmm - 0.5mm by photo etching.<br>
Also in this case, a pitch of the minute projection 133 is<br>
preferable to 100 µ m or less, more preferable 30 µ m or<br>
less. A depth of said photo etching is set to 3-40 µ m, the<br>
minute projections 33 of 70% - 200% of height of film<br>
thickness are formed on the belt 134/ thus the belt 134 is<br>
made as a templatingng belt.<br>
An advantage using the belt as a templating body is<br>
chat it can be easily made a long size body compared with<br>
the case where it considers as a roller. If it becomes a<br>
long size body, the following two points are advantages.<br>
For the 1st point, since the stencil sheet processing area<br>
increases per 1 round of the belt, the film processing of<br>
the amount of the purposes can be performed by a few of<br>
repeats, wear of the minute projections of the part<br>
decreases and the life of the belt becomes long. For the<br>
2nd' point, since the film after processing can be in<br>
contact with the belt in a long time, heat setting can<br>
fully be performed in the meantime. On the other hand, a<br><br>
tarrying out endless processing welding of the belt needs<br>
advanced welding technology. However, since it is not<br>
necessary to form minute projections in the joint portion<br>
of the stencil plate and the stencil plate when producing<br>
the stencil sheet with which the length per edition was<br>
decided, if it is made for the welding part to serve as the<br>
joint portion, it will become unnecessary to consider as<br>
endless processing welding, and the problem will be solved.<br>
In addition, when the working temperature is set to<br>
t °C , the melting point of the film is set to m°C and the<br>
glass transition point of the film is set to g °C , the<br>
templating can be performed by P Pa of working pressure<br>
force of 104x10 or more so that a aseable stencil<br>
sheet is obtained. That is cleared through the experiment.<br>
In accordance with the conveyance path of the stencil<br>
sheet 12, anyone of the compositions of Fig. 9 or Fig. 10<br>
is arranged and then the composition of Fig.l is arranged,<br>
thereby, a series of plate-making apparatus are composed.<br>
Moreover, this stencil printing machine according to the<br>
present invention can also consist of building this plate-<br>
making apparatus into the stencil printing machine as a<br>
plate-making section.<br>
With the plate-making method for stencil printing<br>
performed as mentioned above, since the stencil sheet<br>
consists of only thermoplastic resin film, a lamination<br><br>
with a supporter becomes unnecessary. Therefore, an<br>
inconvenience due to have the supporter is removed. For<br>
example, the lamination process becomes unnecessary.<br>
Adhesives become unnecessary. A bad influence to print<br>
qualities, such as "deformation of ink-permeating opening"<br>
etc. which adhesives bring to plate-making, is lost. A bad<br>
influence in which a fiber of a supporter enters in an<br>
opening of a perforated film, and produces, like "graze of<br>
printing" is lost. Although it will become the cause which<br>
produces curls if different-kind of materials are stuck,<br>
such a property that is easy to curl is removed. In the<br>
case of the lamination structure, ink which had been<br>
absorbed by the supporter was useless, but in the case of a<br>
structure only with a film, such futility of the ink is<br>
lost because the film is not equipped with any supporter<br>
having a thickness about 20 to 30 times the thickness of<br>
the film.<br>
Moreover, in the case of the conventional supporter<br>
lamination composition, although the thickness of the film<br>
itself was about 1.5 µ m, but in the case of the structure<br>
only with the film according to the present invention, it<br>
is possible to actually handle the film since the film has<br>
a certain amount of thickness, for example 4 to 5 µ m<br>
(thickness grade of the cassette tape for sound) or more<br>
responding to a hardness of a material quality more. If<br><br>
another word is carried out, when the thickness of the<br>
stencil sheet is the thickness of only the film (about 1.5 µ<br>
m) in the case of lamination structure, the stencil plate<br>
itself will be too thin and it will be hard to deal with it.<br>
In the present invention, since the thickness of the film<br>
itself is not as thin as the thickness in the conventional<br>
supporter lamination composition,, it can effectively<br>
prevent back projection and carrying out a strike-through<br>
caused by transferring of superfluous ink to a print sheet.<br>
In the case of the conventional lamination stencil<br>
sheet, since the thermoplastic resin film with a thickness<br>
of about 1.5 µ m is perforated by heating of the thermal<br>
head, thermoplastic resin film with a thickness of 4-5 µ m<br>
or more can not be perforated by heating of the same<br>
thermal head due to insufficiency of the out put of the<br>
thermal head. Moreover, if the output of the thermal head<br>
is enlarged, high heat energy gets across to a platen<br>
roller; thereby a bad influence attains the platen roller,<br>
and is not preferable for a life of the thermal head itself.<br>
However, by the method for plate-making according to the<br>
present invention, although it is based also on a kind of<br>
fiJ.m material, a certain amount of thickness is given at<br>
least so as to easily handle it and the heat energy which<br>
is required in perforating does not become large compared<br>
with the conventional case. The. reason is that many minute<br><br>
recesses are occurred on one side of the film. Thereby, an<br>
ink-permeating opening can be obtained from the opposite<br>
side only by fusing the film to the grade which<br>
communicates with the. minute recess in the part to<br>
perforate.<br>
Conventionally, in the case of a stencil sheet only<br>
with a thermoplastic resin film, it is difficult to deal<br>
with the stencil sheet if the thickness of the film is not<br>
made to some extent thick, it is necessary to enlarge the<br>
output of the thermal head for thermally perforating. This<br>
is the greatest problem of utilization. According to the<br>
present invention, it becomes possible to thermally<br>
perforate the ink-permeating opening to the film without<br>
increasing of the output of the thermal head, and it can<br>
solve this problem.<br>
It is preferable that the heat energy transmitted to<br>
the platen roller, which counters the thermal head on both<br>
sides of the thin thermoplastic resin film, is small as<br>
much as possible. As for this, It becomes possible to make<br>
the energy transmitted from the thermal head to the platen<br>
small enough since the output of the thermal head becomes<br>
small and the minute recess forms a heat insulation air<br>
space.<br>
In particular, since the thermoplastic resin film is<br>
extended and an internal tensile stress at the time of the<br><br>
extension remains in the film, a crack occurs only by a<br>
thermal fusion of a' few portions, and an opening which<br>
arrives at the minute recess of the neighborhood of it is<br>
formed. Therefore, it is not necessary to heat until a<br>
melting part arrives at the minute recess, and the output<br>
of the thermal head can be still miniaturized. Thus, in<br>
order to carry out the internal remains of the tensile<br>
stress at the time of the extension, it is necessary that a<br>
mechanical processing, such as a mold pressing processing<br>
which forms the minute recess, must be performed below at<br>
the melting point temperature of thermoplastic resin. In<br>
addition, it is preferable that the working temperature is<br>
higher than the giass-transition-point temperature of<br>
thermoplastic resin, in order to form the recess by the<br>
fewer working pressure force, preventing the crack of the<br>
film.<br>
Moreover, the plate-making method of the present<br>
invention can be performed using by the plate-making<br>
apparatus for stencil printing. The thermoplastic resin<br>
film with uniform predetermined thickness is supplied in<br>
the apparatus, and the recesses are formed on one side<br>
surface of the fed film. Then, an opposite side surface of<br>
the film is heated by the thermal head generating a low<br>
energy heat so that an ink permeable opening is formed to<br>
make plate. A series of these operations may be performed<br><br>
by independent plate-making apparatus, and may be performed<br>
within the stencil printing machine equipped with such<br>
plate-making apparatus as the plate-making section.<br>
(Industrially applicability)<br>
