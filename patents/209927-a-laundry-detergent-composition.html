				<td>FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition containing a cellulose polymer. More specifically, the present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition containing a cationic metal ion and a cellulose polymer.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Laundry detergent compositions usually contain anionic surfactants and builders. After washing fabric, however, consumers are not always satisfied with the result of the washing.   For example, especially on cotton fabric, pill/fuzz on the fabric surface is formed after multiple washings.    Pill/fuzz on the fabric surface is not preferable because consumers believe that the fabric has become weak or worn and/or the fabric does not feel soft. In addition, if consumers wash colored   fabric,   sometimes  the  fabric   color becomes  faded.     Thus,  color maintenance is another important factor for detergent compositions. A detergent composition containing cellulase is known for removing pill/fuzz on the fabric surface.    Also detergent compositions containing chlorine scavengers were developed for improving color maintenance.  However chlorine scavengers may react with a bleach in a detergent composition easily.  Therefore, it is difficult to add chlorine scavengers in detergent compositions containing a bleach because the performance of the bleach may be reduced.<br>
There is a continuing need to formulate detergent compositions to reduce the amount of pill/fuzz formed on a washed fabric's surface.   In addition, there is<br>
a continuing need to have detergent compositions that have color maintenance properties.<br>
None of the existing art provides all or the advantages and benefits of the present invention.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition containing a mixture of a cationic metal ion and an anionically modified cellulose (AMC). In a preferred laundry detergent composition the molar ratio of the anionically modified group to cationic metal ion is from about 50:1 to about 1:50.<br>
These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become evident to those skilled in the art from a reading of the present disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
While the specification concludes with claims particularly pointing out and distinctly claiming the invention, it is believed the present invention will be better understood from the following description.<br>
All percentages are by weight of total composition unless specifically stated otherwise.<br>
All ratios are weight ratios unless specifically stated otherwise. As used herein, "comprising" means that other steps and other ingredients which do not affect the end result can be added.   This term encompassed tne terms "consisting of and "consisting essentially of.<br>
All cited references are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. Citation of any reference is not an admission regarding any determination as to its availability as prior art to the claimed invention.<br>
The present invention relates to a laundry detergent composition containing an anionically modified cellulose (AMC) and a cationic metal ion, wherein the molar ratio of the anionically modified group of the AMC to the cationic metal ion is from about 50:1 to about 1:50, preferably, from about 20:1 to about 1:20, and more preferably, from about 10:1 to about 1:10.<br>
The present invention substantially prevents pill/fuzz from forming on the fabric surface after multiple washings. The present invention also provides better<br>
color maintenance over multiple washings. Pill/fuzz is formed on a fabric's surface by many reasons, including for example, by the fabric friction during washing process as well as wearing. Because fabrics contains fibers, after multiple washings, fibers sometimes become unraveled or disentangled. As a result, fibers appear on the fabric surface and form pills. This phenomenon is called pill/fuzz formation.<br>
Although not wanting to be limited by theory, it is believed that when the fabric surface is substantially coated with AMC, pill/fuzz formation is substantially prevented. Both the AMC and the fabric surface, especially cotton fabrics, hold a negative charge.   Although the AMC holds a negative charge, the AMC easily attaches to the fabric surface because the structure of the AMC and fabric surface are similar (both have a type of cellulose molecule in their structure).  But the physical structure itself is not sufficient to deposit the AMC substantially on the entire fabric surface, so that the  pill/fuzz .formation  is  not substantially avoided.  Since a cationic metal ion holds a positive charge, a cationic metal ion can neutralize the charge of the AMC.   As a result, the addition of a cationic metal ion can help the AMC be deposited more easily on the fabric surface.<br>
Color maintenance is meant to prevent the fabric fading. Although not<br>
wanting to be limited by theory, it is believed that if the fabric surface is coated<br>
with the AMC, the dye on the fabric surface is prevented from detaching and<br>
dissolving into the wash water. Many dye like direct dye hold a negative charge.<br>
Although the AMC also has a negative charge, the addition of a cationic metal<br>
ion can help the AMC deposit to the fabric surface to substantially prevent the<br>
fading of the fabric.	«<br>
In detergent compositions containing anionic surfactants, if some cationic metal ions are added, it may neutralize the charge of the anionic surfactant in the washing solution because anionic surfactants also hold a negative charge. If the level of cationic metal ion becomes high, the anionic surfactant may not perform well because the anionic surfactant is precipitated by the cationic metal ion. Thus, the addition of AMC with a cationic metal ion in a detergent composition may also prevent a negative affect on anionic surfactant performance.<br>
In the present invention, the AMC and the cationic metal ion can be added into the composition separately or, preferably added as a pre-mixture to have more strong interaction between AMC and cationic ions. If a pre-mixture of AMC and cationic metal ion is first made, the AMC and cationic metal ion may have<br>
more strong interaction. It leads to more effective AMC deposition on fabrics and less interaction with other detergent ingredients, such as anionic surfactant.<br>
A fabric substantially coated with AMC may also prevent the redeposition of removed stains onto the fabric from the wash water. JL        Anionically Modified Cellulose<br>

Origin  can  further be mesophilic    or    extremophilic    (psychrophilic,    psychrotrophic,    thermophilic, barophilic, alkalophilic, acidophilic, halophilic, etc.). Purified or non-purified forms of these enzymes may be used. Nowadays, it is common practice to modify wild-type enzymes via protein / genetic engineering techniques in order to optimise their performance efficiency in the detergent compositions of the invention. For example, the variants may be designed such that the compatibility of the enzyme to   commonly   encountered   ingredients   of  such   compositions   is   increased. Alternatively, the variant may be designed such that the optimal pH, bleach or chelant stability, catalytic activity and the like, of the enzyme variant is tailored to suit the particular cleaning application.<br>
In particular, attention should be focused on amino acids sensitive to oxidation in the case of bleach stability and on surface charges for the surfactant compatibility. The isoelectric point of such enzymes may be modified by the substitution of some charged amino acids, e.g. an increase in isoelectric point may help to improve compatibility with anionic surfactants. The stability of the enzymes may be further enhanced by the creation of e.g. additional salt bridges and enforcing calcium binding sites to increase chelant stability. Special attention must be paid to the cellulases as most of the cellulases have separate binding<br><br>
domains (CBD). Properties of such enzymes can be altered by modifications in these domains.<br>
Said enzymes are normally incorporated in the detergent composition at levels from 0.0001% to 2% of pure enzyme by weight of the detergent composition. The enzymes can be added as separate single ingredients (prills, granulates, stabilized liquids, etc... containing one enzyme ) or as mixtures of two or more enzymes ( e.g. cogranulates ).<br>
Other suitable detergent ingredients that can be added are enzyme oxidation scavengers which are described in Copending European Patent application 92870018.6 filed on January 31, 1992. Examples of such enzyme oxidation scavengers are ethoxylated tetraethylene polyamines.<br>

One type of non-oxygen bleaching agent of particular interest includes photoactivated bleaching agents such as the suffonated zinc and/or aluminum phthalocyanines. These materials can be deposited upon the substrate during the washing process. Upon irradiation with light, in the presence of oxygen, such as by hanging clothes out to dry in the daylight, the sulfonated zinc phthalocyanine is activated and, consequently, the<br>

Soil release agents useful in compositions of the present invention are conventionally copolymers or terpolymers of terephthalic acid with ethylene glycol and/or propylene glycol units in various arrangements. Examples of such<br><br>
polymers are disclosed in the commonly assigned US Patent Nos. 4116885 and 4711730 and European Published Patent Application No. 0 272 033. A particular preferred polymer in accordance with EP-A-0 272 033 has the formula<br>
(CH3(PEG)43)o.75(POH)o.25rr-PO)2.8(T-PEG)0.4]T(PO-H)Q.25((PEG)43CH3)o.75<br>

The target is to obtain a polymer capped at both end by sulphobenzoate groups, "primarily", in the present context most of said copolymers herein will be end-capped by sulphobenzoate groups.     However, some copolymers will be less than fully capped, and therefore their end groups may consist of monoester of ethylene glycol and/or propane 1-2 diol, thereof consist "secondarily" of such species.<br>
The selected polyesters herein contain about 46% by weight of dimethyl terephthalic acid, about 16% by weight of propane -1.2 diol, about 10% by weight ethylene glycol about 13% by weight of dimethyl sulfobenzoic acid and about 15% by weight of sulfoisophthalic acid, and have a molecular weight of about 3.000. The polyesters and their method of preparation are described in detail in EPA 311342.<br>
It is well known in the art that free chlorine in tap water rapidly deactivates the enzymes comprised in detergent compositions. Therefore, using chlorine scavenger such as perborate, ammonium sulfate, sodium sulphite or polyethyleneimine at a level above 0.1% by weight of total composition, in the formulas will provide improved through the wash stability of the detergent enzymes. Compositions comprising chlorine scavenger are described in the European patent application 92870018.6 filed January 31, 1992.<br>
Alkoxylated polycarboxylates such as those prepared from polyacrylates are useful herein to provide additional grease removal performance. Such materials are described in WO 91/08281 and PCT 90/01815 at p. 4 et seq., incorporated herein by reference. Chemically, these materials comprise<br><br>
polyacrylates having one ethoxy side-chain per every 7-8 acrylate units.    The side-chains are of the formula -(CH2CH2O)m(CH2)nCH3 wherein m is 2-3 and n is 6-12.    The side-chains are ester-linked to the polyacrylate "backbone" to provide a "comb" polymer type structure.   The molecular weight can vary, but is typically  in  the  range  of about 2000 to about  50,000.     Such  alkoxylated polycarboxylates can comprise from about 0.05% to about 10%, by weight, of the compositions herein. Detergent Composition Preparation<br>
The detergent compositions according to the present invention can be in any physical form, such as a liquid, paste or granular form. Such compositions can be prepared by combining the essential and optional components in the requisite concentrations in any suitable order and by any conventional means.<br>
Granular compositions, for example, are generally made by combining base granule ingredients, e.g., surfactants, builders, water, etc., as a slurry, and spray drying the resulting slurry to a low level of residual moisture (5-12%).    The remaining dry ingredients, e.g., granules of the essential cellulosic based fabric treatment materials, can be admixed in granular powder form with the spray dried granules in a rotary mixing drum.   The liquid ingredients, e.g., solutions of the essential cellulosic based fabric treatment materials,  enzymes,  binders and perfumes,  can be sprayed onto the resulting granules to form the finished detergent composition.  Granular compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", i.e. they may have a relatively higher density than conventional granular detergents, i.e. from 550 to 950 g/l.    In such case, the granular detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain* a lower  amount  of "inorganic  filler  salt",   compared  to   conventional  granular detergents; typical filler salts are alkaline earth metal salts of sulphates and chlorides, typically sodium sulphate; "compact" detergents typically comprise not more than 10% filler salt.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions can be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients thereof in any desired order to provide compositions containing components in the requisite concentrations. Liquid compositions according to the present invention can also be in "compact form", in such case, the liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention will contain a lower amount of water, compared to conventional liquid detergents. Addition of the cellulosic based polymer or oligomer materials to liquid detergent or other<br><br>
