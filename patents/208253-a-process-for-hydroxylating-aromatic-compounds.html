				<td>The present invention relates to a process for hydroxylating aromatic compounds.<br>
The production of phenol or phenol derivatives by catalytic partial oxidation of benzene or benzene derivatives is known. For example, the use of a variety of catalysts such as vanadium pentoxide on silica or zeolites (e.g. ZSM-5 and ZSM-11) at elevated temperatures has been disclosed in, for example, Iwamoto et al., J. Physical Chemistry (ACS), Vol. 87, No. 6, (1983) p. 903-905; Suzuki et al., 1988 Chemistry Letters of the Chemistry Society of Japan at pages 953-956; United States Patents 5,001,280, 5,110,995, and 5,055,623, the disclosures of these publications being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Although useful for production of both phenol and phenol derivatives, the most significant potential utility of such processes is for the production of phenol in view of the commercial importance of that compound.<br>
To date, practical commercial use of such processes has been hindered by low productivity, problems in controlling temperature rise of the highly exothermic reaction and resulting formation of undesired by-products, and the flammability of mixtures of nitrous oxide and benzene.<br>
Recently processes of this type have been remarkably improved by the discovery that use of a molar deficiency of nitrous oxide (as opposed to the excess or at least stoichiometric quantities previously utilized) will increase selectivity to desired products, provide for higher conversion of nitrous oxide and higher catalyst production efficiency and can also allow for lower temperature rises resulting from the exothermic reaction and for operation with non-explosive mixtures. This discovery is described   in   detail   in  U. S.   patent   application  No. 08/419371    filed  April<br><br>
10, 1995 and copending herewith, the disclosure of said application being incorporated herein by reference.<br>
However the use of large excesses of benzene beyond the amount required to optimize reaction .selec¬tivity requires the separation and recycle of large amounts of benzene.  Even if benzene ratios are high enough to provide non-flammable mixtures in the react tor, the separation , of benzene for recycle in down¬stream operations may leave flammable or explosive mixtures of benzene and nitrous oxide in downstream apparatus if nitrous oxide consumption in the reaction is less than 100%.  Moreover, benzene is a flammable, toxic chemical and storage and handling of large ex¬cesses of that required for reaction increases the magnitude of potential leaks.<br>
It is therefore recognized by those skilled in the art that techniques for limiting the excess of benzene to amounts dictated by productivity consider¬ations and, simultaneously, achieving control of flam-mability and/or adiabatic temperature rise problems would represent a needed advance in the art.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides mixtures for use in processes for production of phenol and phenol derivatives and processes utilizing mixtures of the type described.  The mixtures are characterized by a nitrous oxide to benzene ratio less than 0.5 and suffi¬cient inert gas to render the mixture non-flammable. The use of preferred proportions of nitrous oxide, benzene, and inert gas permits the reaction to be con¬ducted adiabatically without excessive temperature rise .<br>
The invention will be further understood from the description of the preferred embodiments.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention constitutes mixtures for use in processes and processes for catalytic par¬tial oxidation of benzene or substituted benzene by reaction with nitrous oxide in the presence of a cata¬lyst to form phenol or substituted phenol.  The mixture and process will be described by reference to the reac¬tion of benzene to form phenol.  It will be understood that the use of substituted benzenes instead of benzene will result in production of the corresponding substi¬tuted phenols.<br>
In accordance with the process of the present invention, a mixture of benzene and nitrous oxide is contacted with a catalyst in a reactor under conditions selected to oxidize the benzene to phenol.  The molar ratio of nitrous oxide to benzene in the mixture will be less than 0.5.  Preferably, the ratio of nitrous oxide to benzene will be sufficiently low to provide at least 50 mole percent, most preferably 75 to 85 per¬cent, of the obtainable selectivity of the reaction of benzene to phenol.  By "obtainable selectivity" is meant the maximum selectivity of benzene to phenol which can be obtained for given reaction conditions and catalyst by reducing the mole ratio of nitrous oxide to benzene.  It is noted that selectivity approaching 100 percent can be obtained but usually at the cost of lower productivity.  When preferred catalysts are utilized at normal reaction temperatures, obtainable selectivity is typically approached or attained at a nitrous oxide to benzene ratio of about 0.1.  Down¬stream from the reactor, the unreacted benzene is separated from the product by conventional separation techniques and recycled to the reactor.<br>
A critical requirement of the invention is that an inert gas (that is, a gas which will not adversely affect or undesirably participate in the reaction, or adversely affect the catalyst) be present<br><br>
throughout the process in an amount sufficient to ren¬der the various benzene/nitrous oxide mixes encountered throughout the process non-flammable.  (Flammability/ non-flammability is determined pursuant to ASTM Stan¬dard E918) .  For most catalysts and reaction condi¬tions, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, helium, argon, or mixtures thereof will constitute a satisfactory inert gas.  It will be understood that different proportions of inert gas may be required in different portions of the process to satisfy the minimum requirement.  For example, the ratio of nitrous oxide to benzene in the reactor may be sufficiently low in the reactor to be non-flammable even in the absence of any inert gas. However downstream removal of benzene for recycle may leave residual flammable vapor mixes of nitrous oxide and benzene in separation apparatus or other portions of the system.  Such a situation would require injec¬tion of inert gas prior to or iri the separator.  Pref¬erably, from the standpoint of simplicity of process control, sufficient inert gas will be included in the reactor vessel mixture to assure that downstream mixes within expected nitrous oxide to benzene ranges will be non-flammable.  The inert gas will remain admixed with nitrous oxide during separation of benzene and/or phenol and thus be available to make its anti-flame function available in any downstream nitrous oxide containing mixture.<br>
Maximum protection against flammability can be provided by means of a mixture which has a suffi¬ciently high ratio of inert gas to nitrous oxide that the mixture will be non-flammable regardless of the amount of benzene therein.  This will be the case if the molar ratio of nitrous oxide to inert gas is 0.25 or less.  Such a mixture may be safely stored as a premixed feed and its use will insure against problems resulting from unexpectedly low conversion of nitrous oxide or other reaction variation.  Of course.<br><br>
preferred mixtures will also contain proportions of benzene and nitrous oxide optimized for selectivity of phenol product.  Use of excess inert gas is, within practical limits, unobjectionable and provides added protection against leakage of oxidizer (air) into the system.<br>
It is preferred that the mixture of nitrous oxide, benzene and inert gas used in the reactor con¬tains at least 0.3 mole percent nitrous oxide but less than 5 mole percent, most preferably less than 3 mole percent. Lower amounts tend to restrict productivity and higher amounts make it more difficult to control flammability and adiabatic temperature rise.<br>
By selecting the proportions of the mixture in the reactor adiabatic temperature rise from the exothermic reaction can be limited to 150 degrees C or less.  When this is done the reaction can be carried out adi^batically eliminating the use of costly heat exchange means without unduly increasing formation of undesired by-products.  Increasing the inert gas or benzene content of the mixture for temperature control also renders the mixture less flammable.<br>
It will be apparent from the foregoing dis¬cussion that the maximum advantages of the invention will be obtained in process where, absent the inert gas, flammable vapor mixtures would be encountered and/or adiabatic temperature rises greater than 150 degrees C experienced.  However, even in other systems the inert gas will provide insurance against reaction disturbances which might otherwise result in flammable mixtures or unacceptable temperature rises.  For exam¬ple, in a system in which nitrous oxide is initially 100% reacted the inert gas will protect against flamma¬ble mixture formation in the event nitrous oxide con¬version drops due to catalyst deterioration or other cause.<br><br>
The proportions of nitrous oxide, benzene and inert gas set forth above are based on the propor¬tions of only these materials in the process system. It will be understood that the system will also contain phenol and usually small amounts of various by-products and/or co-products.  Also minor amounts of various contaminants such as water vapor, oxygen, carbon monox¬ide, nitric oxide, nitrogen dioxide and various organics can be tolerated.<br>
The process will generally be conducted in a temperature range of from 250-600 degrees C.  Higher temperatures may result in formation of undesirably high levels of by-products whereas lower temperatures may unduly slow the rate of reaction with most catalysts.  However, any temperature providing an acceptable reaction rate without excessive by-product formation may be utilized.  Any catalyst effective for the partial oxidation of benzene or substituted benzene to phenol or substituted phenol may be utilized.  For example, vanadium pentoxide on silica or various zeolites may be employed.  Preferred catalysts include acidified ZSM-5 and ZSM-11 containing catalytically effective amounts of iron.  Further, productivity of the process can be enhanced by using a zeolite that has been hydrothermally treated by exposure to water vapor in air at about 500-900 degrees C for about 2 hours. Such treatment is described in U.S. Patent Application No. 08/419361 filed April 10, 1995 and copending here¬with, the disclosure of said application being incorpo¬rated herein by reference.<br>
In general, the process will be operated to maximize benzene selectivity for phenol (moles of phe¬nol produced per mole of benzene reacted); to maximize nitrous oxide selectivity for phenol (moles of phenol produced per mole of nitrous oxide reacted); to maxi¬mize productivity (mass of phenol produced per unit<br><br>
time divided by catalyst mass); and to minimize catalyst activity loss rate.<br>
The primary reaction to convert benzene to phenol is accompanied by various side reactions includ¬ing: a reaction converting benzene to coke; a reaction converting benzene to carbon dioxide and carbon monox¬ide; and a reaction converting benzene to various partially oxygenated aromatics, e.g. d ihydroxybenzenes. All of the reaction rates are increased by increasing temperature but the rate of the side reactions is in¬creased more than the rate of the desired reaction producing the primary product.  Also, the greater the rate of side reactions, the faster the rate of catalyst activity loss.  Selectivity and yields are optimized by lowering temperature and/or nitrous oxide concentra¬tion.<br>
In an adiabatic reactor, temperature can be lowered by lowering the temperature of feed streams to the reactor (reactants and diluents).  However, lower¬ing the feed stream temperature too much will adversely affect productivity.  The optimum temperature for a given system can be determined by routine tests to give the desired balance between selectivity and productiv¬ity.  Adiabatic temperature rise can be minimized by lowering nitrous oxide conversion (moles nitrous oxide reacted per mole nitrous oxide fed to the reactor); by increasing the heat capacity of the feed stream; or by the nitrous oxide concentration in the feed.  Nitrous oxide concentration can be lowered two ways to favor the desired reaction.  First, of course the mole per¬cent nitrous oxide in the feed can simply be reduced taking care that the concentration is not reduced so much as to unduly affect productivity.  The second method is to decrease the feed stream flow rate (re¬sulting in increased contact time with the catalyst) so<br><br>
as to decrease the average concentration of nitrous oxide. Again, this cannot be overdone or productivity will suffer.<br>
It will be recognized that the variables discussed above other than the proportions of feed components are not independent. For example, increasing the feed temperature increases the reactor exit temperature because it increases the reaction rate and nitrous oxide conversion. Also, the average nitrous oxide concentration in the reactor decreases due to higher conversion. The yield of nitrous oxide to phenol will depend on whether the benefit from the lower nitrous oxide concentration is greater or less than the penalty for the higher temperature. Similarly, the productivity will depend on whether any decrease in selectivity is offset by an increase in nitrous oxide conversion.<br>
As has been indicated, benzene may be replaced in whole or part by substituted benzenes such as phenol, fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene, toluene, ethyl benzene and similar compounds having an aromatic ring with a substitutable hydrogen atom on the ring. The process is also useful to produce polyols such as hydroquinone, resorcinol, and catechol by oxidation of phenol. When only phenol is desired, further oxidation to polyols (aromatics having more than one -OH substituants) can be minimized by using a low feed ratio of nitrous oxide to benzene, a low temperature, and maximizing nitrous oxide conversion.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a process for hydroxylating aromatic compounds having at least one substitutable hydrogen atom, said process comprising contacting a gaseous mixture of nitrous oxide and said aromatic compound, the molar ratio of nitrous oxide to aromatic compound being less than 0.5, with a catalyst and subsequently separating unreacted aromatic compound while maintaining sufficient inert gas in admixture with the nitrous oxide and aromatic compound such that the mixtures of nitrous oxide, aromatic and inert gas are non¬flammable throughout the process. The invention is further illustrated by the following examples:<br>
