				<td>This application is related to U.S. Application No. 10/910,682 filed on August 3, 2004 and assigned to Cisco Technology, Inc., a common assignee for this invention.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to detection of a signal having random characteristics, and more specifically to detection of a signal having a random number of pulses, and other potentially random characteristics such as pulse width, spacing between pulses and a random number of pulses within a random number of bursts, within a predetermined time period.<br>
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has published requirements for unlicensed wireless devices that operate in the frequency bands 5.250-5.350 GHz or 5.470 - 5.725 GHz to employ a mechanism to share these bands with radar operations. These requirements are published in FCC 5GHz Report and Order, RM-10371.<br>
However, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) has distributed an additional requirement to detect a new test signal, referred to as the "Bin-5 Test Signal" which is being recommended to the FCC for inclusion in the test procedure described in RM-10371. Devices unable to detect the Bin-5 Test Signal may not be certified for operation in the 5.250-5.350 GHz or 5.470 - 5.725 GHz bands in the United States.<br>
Currently, the transmission period for the Bin-5 Test signal is twelve seconds. The Bin-5 test signal will have a total of 8 to 20 pulse bursts within the twelve second period, with the number of bursts being randomly chosen. Each burst will consist of one to three pulses, with the number of pulses being randomly chosen. Each pulse within a burst will have a linear FM of 5-20 MHz (each pulse within the burst will have the same amount of chirp). Each pulse burst within the twelve second time period may have different chip widths. Each pulse in a burst will have the same randomly chosen length between 50 to 100 microseconds with a minimum resolution of 5 microseconds. If more than one pulse in present in a burst, each space between the pulses will be a randomly chosen time<br><br>
between 1000 and 2000 microseconds (or 1 to 2 milliseconds) with a 1 microsecond minimum resolution. Each burst will be placed at a random starting location.<br>
An example Bin-5 Test Signal is illustrated in Figure 1. Each burst, 1, 2, 3 ...N occurs within a corresponding Burst Interval. As illustrated Burst 1 has two pulses, Burst 2 has one pulse, Burst 3 has three pulses, Burst 4 has two pulses ... and Burst N has one pulse. The pulse widths and spacing between pulses is random.<br>
The Bin-5 Test Signal will not be detected by prior art systems. Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus that can accurately detect the Bin-5 Test Signal, or test signals having random characteristics similar to the Bin-5 Test Signal. Detecting the Bin-5 Test Signal requires distinguishing it from wireless network traffic. Without being able to distinguish the test signal from network traffic, false detection from network traffic may occur frequently, rendering a detection solution impractical.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An aspect of the present invention uses a concept of examining ratios of single pulse bursts to bursts having two or more pulses to distinguish wireless network transmissions from a Bin-5 Test Signal or any other signal with similar characteristics, thereby suppressing false detection caused by network traffic to a practical level. An aspect of the present invention enables a device to operate in the 5.250 - 5.350 GHz band or the 5.470 - 5.725 GHz band in the United States.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is a method for detecting a signal having random characteristics. The method comprises detecting a plurality of bursts within a predetermined time period, evaluating the plurality of bursts to determine how many pulses each of the plurality of bursts contains and determining the signal having random characteristics is present responsive to the ratio the plurality of bursts containing a first predetermined number of pulses being approximately equal to the plurality of bursts containing a second predetermined number of pulses.<br><br>
Still other objects of the present invention will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following description wherein there is shown and described a preferred embodiment of this invention, simply by way of illustration of one of the best modes best suited for to carry out the invention. As it will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments and its several details are capable of modifications in various obvious aspects all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawing and descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Throughout this description, the preferred embodiment and examples shown should be considered as exemplars, rather than limitations, of the present invention.<br><br>
Wireless network traffic may result in energy pulses (for example, from collisions of transmitted packets) that are indistinguishable from single pulse Bin-5 Test Signal bursts (with currently available receiver hardware). However, an aspect of the present invention distinguishes wireless network traffic from Bin-5 Test Signal transmissions by analyzing the ratio of bursts that contain one pulse ("singletons") to bursts that contain two pulses ("pairs") to bursts that contain three pulses ("triplets"). For the Bin-5 Test Signal, because the number of pulses in each burst is randomly chosen, the ratio of singletons to pairs to triplets is approximately 1 :1 :1. By approximately or approximately equal to 1 :1 :1 is meant the ratio of singletons to pairs to triplets is less than at least 8:4:1 , preferably 4:2:1. Although the present invention is described in the context of Bin-5 Test Signal, that is bursts containing singletons, pairs and triplets, the present invention is adaptable for detection of any signal having Bin-5 Test Signal characteristics, e.g., a signal that has bursts containing a random number of pulses distributed over a predetermined time period and can detect signals with random bursts of one, two, or more pulses.<br>
For wireless network traffic, Bin-5 like pulses may occur, and their distribution may statistically result in a pair or triplet of such pulses (e.g., the more Bin-5 like wireless transmissions that occur, the greater the probability that two of them will occur within 1 to 2 milliseconds of each other and also have identical pulse duration, forming a Bin-5 like pair. Less probably still, a Bin-5 like triplet may also occur as a result of many such transmissions). However, because pairs of pulses are created by timing that is less likely than that for a single pulse, and triplets (bursts consisting of three pulses) are created by even less probably timing, the ratio of singletons to pairs to triplets, the ratio of singletons to pairs to triplets is not 1 :1 :1 . As an example, in an IEEE 802.1 la network with multiple transmitters, collisions from transmissions typically generate a 100:10:1 ratio of Bin-5 like singletons to Bin-5 like pairs to Bin-5 like triplets. Thus, a ratio less than 100:10:1 (e.g., 8:4:1 or 4:2:1) of singletons to pairs to triplets should be used to detect a Bin-5 Test Signal or signal with similar characteristics. Therefore, by examining the ratio of singletons to pairs to triplets, a determination can be made whether it is more likely that received signals are from wireless network transmissions, or if they<br><br>
are a Bin-5 Test Signal, or from an actual radar, for which the Bin-5 test signal is a characteristic.<br>
In view of the foregoing features described above, a methodology in accordance with various aspects of the present invention will be better appreciated with reference to FIGS. 2 and 3. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodology of FIGS. 2 and 3 are shown and described as executing serially, it is to be understood and appreciated that the present invention is not limited by the illustrated order, as some aspects could, in accordance with the present invention, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other aspects from that shown and described herein. Moreover, not all illustrated features may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with an aspect the present invention. Embodiments of the present invention are suitably adapted to implement the methodology in hardware, software, or a combination thereof.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, there is illustrated a block diagram of a methodology 200 for detecting a signal having random characteristics. At 202, bursts within a predetermined time period are detected. The detected bursts can be limited to bursts having a predetermined signal strength, such as greater than 64 dBm and to bursts that are unidentifiable. By unidentifiable it is meant that the burst is not recognizable as wireless local area network traffic. For example, if the burst can be decoded and is determined to have a header, such as an 802.11 header, the burst is not used. The predetermined period can be a sliding time period, e.g., the last 12 seconds. The sliding time period can be updated as often as desired, for example every one tenth of a second.<br>
At 204, the bursts are evaluated to determine how many pulses each burst contains. A predetermined criterion can be applied to the pulses for evaluation. For example, a Bin-5 Test Signal has pulses with pulse widths of 50 to 100 microseconds, and for bursts containing multiple pulses, the spacing between pulses can vary from 1 to 2 milliseconds (or 1000 - 2000 microseconds). Bursts that do not have pulses meeting the predetermined criteria can be discarded.<br><br>
At 206, the ratio of bursts containing a first predetermined number of pulses and bursts having a second predetermined number of pulses is determined. The first and second predetermined number of pulses can be any desired number, for example the first predetermined number can be one and the second predetermined number can be two, for obtaining the ratio of bursts containing a single pulse to bursts containing a pair of pulses.<br>
At 208, the ratio is evaluated to determine whether the number of bursts having the first predetermined number of pulses is approximately equal to the number of bursts having the second predetermined number of pulses. If the ratio indicates that the number of bursts having the first predetermined number of pulses is approximately equal to the number bursts having the second predetermined number of pulses (YES), then as shown at 210 a determination is made that the signal is present. Otherwise, the method 200 continues and evaluates the next time period at 202. The time period can be a sliding time period, wherein the older bursts are dropped out of the calculations as newer bursts are received.<br>
Although as illustrated in Figure 2 methodology 200 is used to determine the ratio of bursts having first and second predetermined number of pulses, this is merely for ease of illustration as the aspects of the present invention are suitably adaptable to be extrapolated for use with any number of pulses. For example, for detecting a Bin-5 Test Signal, the ratio of bursts containing singletons to pairs to triplets can be obtained at step 206 and the determination of whether the ratios are approximately equal can be used at step 208 to determine whether the Bin-5 Test Signal is present.<br>
FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a methodology 300 for detecting a Bin-5 Test Signal. At 302, bursts within a predetermined time period are detected. The detected bursts can be limited to bursts having a predetermined signal strength, such as greater than 64 dBm and to bursts that are unidentifiable. By unidentifiable it is meant that the burst is not recognizable as wireless local area network traffic. For example, if the burst can be decoded and is determined to have a header, such as an 802.11 header, the burst is not used. The predetermined period can be a sliding time period, e.g., the last 12 seconds.<br><br>
The sliding time period can be updated as often as desired, for example every one tenth of a second. For a Bin-5 Test Signal, the predetermined time period is 12 seconds.<br>
At 304, the bursts are evaluated to determine how many pulses each burst contains. For a Bin-5 Test Signal, the number of bursts containing one pulse (singletons), two pulses (pairs) and three pulses (triplets) are calculated. Furthermore, a predetermined criterion can be applied to the pulses for evaluation. For example, a Bin-5 Test Signal has pulses with pulse widths of 50 to 100 microseconds, and for bursts containing multiple pulses, the spacing between pulses can vary from 1 to 2 milliseconds (or 1000 - 2000 microseconds). Bursts that do not have pulses meeting the predetermined criteria can be discarded.<br>
At 306, an algorithm is applied to the number of pairs and triplets detected. The number of triplets is multiplied by a first factor, the number of pairs is multiplied by a second factor. A determination is made whether the sum of the product of triplets multiplied by the first factor and the product of pairs multiplied by the second factor is greater than a predetermined threshold. If the sum of the product of triplets multiplied by the first factor and the product of pairs multiplied by the second factor is greater than a predetermined threshold (YES), the test at 308 is also implemented; otherwise (NO), a determination is made the signal is not present and the next time period is evaluated, starting again at 302.<br>
At 308, an algorithm is applied to determine whether there are a sufficient number of triplets and pairs to indicate the signals are from a Bin-5 Test Signal (or from a radar producing signals similar to a Bin-5 Test Signal), not from wireless network traffic. A determination is made whether the sum of the product of triplets multiplied by the first factor and the product of pairs multiplied by the second factor is greater than the number of singletons. If at 308 it is determined that the sum of the product of triplets multiplied by the first factor and the product of pairs multiplied by the second factor is greater than the number of singletons (YES), then it is determined that a Bin-5 Test Signal (or a signal from a radar producing signals similar to a Bin-5 Test Signal) has been detected as<br><br>
illustrated at 310; otherwise (NO), a determination is made the signal is not present and the next time period is evaluated, starting again at 302.<br>
As an example of first and second factors for use in steps 306 and 308, a value of 8 for the first factor, four for the second factor and 10 for the threshold, yielding 8t+4p&gt;10 (where t = number of triplets and p = number of pairs) at 306 has been determined useful in detecting a Bin-5 Test Signal. For 308, 8t+4t &gt; s (where s represents the number of singletons) has been found useful in detecting a Bin-5 Test Signal. Furthermore, the combination of tests applied in 306 and 308 have been found useful in detecting a Bin-5 Test Signal, while suppressing false detection from network traffic to a practical level.<br>
FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a wireless device (apparatus) 400 capable of detecting a signal having random characteristics, such as a Bin-5 Test Signal. Wireless device 400 comprises a wireless transceiver 402 with an antenna 404 that is capable of receiving wireless signals. Bin-5 Test Signal module 408 is communicatively coupled to wireless transceiver 402. Bin-5 test module can receive signals from wireless transceiver 402 to evaluate. Bin-5 test module 408 comprises logic for implementing a methodology for detecting a signal having random characteristics, such as a Bin-5 Test Signal or a radar having similar characteristics. "Logic", as used herein, includes but is not limited to hardware, firmware, software and/or combinations of each to perform a function (s) or an action (s), and/or to cause a function or action from another component. For example, based on a desired application or need, logic may include a software controlled microprocessor, discrete logic such as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), a programmable/programmed logic device, memory device containing instructions, or the like, or combinational logic embodied in hardware. Logic may also be fully embodied as software.<br>
Signals that are known to be wireless network signals, or other known signals that are not Bin-5 Test Signals, Radar, etc. can be discarded. Other criteria, for example RSSI can also be applied to signals received by wireless transceiver 402. For example, signals with an RSSI of less than -64dBm can be ignored if it is desired that Bin-5 Test Signals<br><br>
or radar signals that are farther away can be ignored. Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 can have an associated Memory 410 for storing data and calculation results. For storing data, memory 410 can be configured to only store the most recent data. Memory 410 can be for example a shift register or ring memory. For a shift register as new values are written in, old values are shifted out and discarded. For a ring memory, newer values overwrite older values.<br>
Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 is configured to detect a plurality of bursts received by wireless transceiver 402 with a predetermined time period (such as twelve seconds). Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 evaluates the plurality of bursts to determine the number of pulses each of the plurality of bursts contain. Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 determines whether a signal having random characteristics is present responsive to the ratio of the number of the plurality of bursts having a first predetermined number of pulses being approximately equal to the number of the plurality of bursts having a second predetermined number of pulses.<br>
In an alternate embodiment, Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 determines whether a signal having random characteristics is present (such as a Bin-5 Test Signal or a radar with similar signal characteristics) is responsive to the ratio of the plurality of bursts having a first predetermined number of pulses, the plurality of bursts having a second predetermined number of pulses and the plurality of bursts having a third predetermined number of pulses being approximately equal. As an example, the first predetermined number of pulses is one and the second predetermined number of pulses is two and the third predetermined number of pulses is three.<br>
Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 can be configured for detecting bursts having pulses with a pulse width between 50 to 100 microseconds and spacing between pulses for bursts having more than one pulse is between 1 millisecond and two milliseconds. Furthermore, the number of the plurality of bursts can be between eight and twelve, and the predetermined time period can be twelve seconds.<br><br>
Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 can be configured to determine the Bin-5 Test Signal (or radar with Bin-5 Test Signal characteristics) is present responsive to a sum of a product of a first number times the number of bursts containing three pulses and a product of a second number times the number of bursts containing two pulses is greater than a predetermined threshold, and the sum of a product of the first number times the number of bursts containing three pulses and the product of the second number times the number of bursts containing two pulses is greater than a number of the plurality of bursts having single pulses. For example, the first number can be eight, the second number can be four and the predetermined threshold can be ten. Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 can be configured so that the predetermined time period is the most recent twelve seconds, and is updated every one tenth of a second.<br>
Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 can be a standalone module (e.g., an ASIC or combinational logic) or can be implemented as part of a processor based controller 412 (for example as software running on a processor). As illustrated in Figure 4, controller 412 also has a frequency selection module 406 coupled to wireless transceiver 402. Frequency selection module 406 can be used to select operating frequencies for wireless transceiver 402. Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 is coupled to frequency selection module 406. When Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 detects a Bin- 5 Test Signal, a radar with Bin-5 Test Signal characteristics, or any other random type signal that Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 is configured to detect, Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 can communicate with frequency selection module 406 to inform frequency selection module 406 when a signal has been detected. Frequency selection module 406 can be configured to be responsive to receiving the signal from Bin-5 Test Signal Module 408 to change the operating frequency of wireless transceiver 402. This can enable wireless transceiver 402 to avoid using frequencies currently in use by radars. This capability allows wireless transceiver 402 to operate in the 5.250 - 5.350 GHz or 5.470 - 5.725 GHz bands in the United States.<br>
