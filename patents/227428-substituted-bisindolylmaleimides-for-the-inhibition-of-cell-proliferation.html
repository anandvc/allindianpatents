SUBSTITUTED BISINBOLYLMALEIMIDES FOR THE INHIBITION OF CELL<br>
PROLIFERATION<br>
The present invention is directed to certain substituted pyrroles that are antiÂ¬proliferative agents. These compounds and their pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts are useful in the treatment or control of cell proliferative disorders, in particular cancer. The invention is also directed to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds, and to methods for the treatment and/or prevention of cancer, particularly the treatment or control of solid tumors.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Uncontrolled cell proliferation is the hallmark of cancer. Cancerous tumor cells typically have some form of damage to the genes that directly or indirectly regulate the cell-division cycle. Much research has been expended in the study of antiproliferative agents. While many agents have been identified having desired antiproliferative activities, many of these agents have various drawbacks, including poor solubility, molecular complexity, etc., which may render them either unsuitable or inconvenient for therapeutic use in human patients. There continues to be a need for small molecule compounds that may be readily synthesized, are effective as cancer therapeutic agents and are suitable for continuous infusion delivery to patients. It is thus an object of this invention to provide such compounds as welt as pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br><br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein, the following terms shall have the following definitions.<br>
"Alkenyl" means a straight-chain or branched aliphatic unsaturated hydrocarbon having 1 to 15 carbon atoms, preferably 1 to 10 carbon atoms, most preferably 1 to 6 carbon atoms.<br>

MDAMB-435 Cell-Based Assay<br>
The epithelial breast carcinoma cell line (MDAMB-435) was purchased from ATCC American Type Cell Culture Collection) and was grown in culture in medium as â ecommended by ATCC. For analysis of the effect of various compounds of formula on the growth of these cells, the cells were plated at a concentration of 1500 Dells/well in a 96 well tissue culture plate ("test plate). The day after the cells were plated, the compounds to be analyzed were dissolved in 100% DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) to yield at 10mM stock solution. Each compound was diluted in H20 to 1 mM and was added to triplicate wells in the first row of a 96 well master plate containing medium to yield a final concentration of 40u.M. The compounds were then serially diluted in medium in the "master plate". The diluted compound(s) were then transferred to test plates containing cells. A row of vehicle "control cells"<br><br>
received DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in each well was 0.1%. 5 days post drug addition, the plate was analyzed as described below.<br>
MTT (3-(4-5 methyl thiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazoliurn bromide; thiazolyl blue) was added to each well to yield a final concentration of 1 mg/ml.
