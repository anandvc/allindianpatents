				<td>OLIGOMERIC CHAIN EXTENDERS FOR PROCESSING,<br>
POST-PROCESSING AND RECYCLING OF CONDENSATION POLYMERS,<br>
SYNTHESIS, COMPOSITIONS AND APPLICATIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is directed to chain extenders made from epoxy-<br>
functional monomers, polymeric compositions and articles made therefrom.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Many condensation or step-growth polymers, including polyesters,<br>
polyamides, polycarbonates, and polyurethanes are widely used to make plastic<br>
products such as films, bottles, and other molded products. The mechanical and<br>
physical properties of these polymers are highly dependent on their molecular<br>
weights.<br>
In a life cycle, these materials may experience a synthesis process,<br>
followed by an extrusion step, and a final processing step which may be another<br>
compounding/extrusion operation followed by profile or sheet forming,<br>
thermoforming, blow molding, or fiber spinning, or they can be injection or otherwise<br>
molded in the molten state. Typically, all of these steps occur under high temperature<br>
conditions. In addition, in recent years, increased attention has been focused on<br>
improved methods of reclaiming and recycling the plastics made from these polymers,<br>
with an eye toward resource conservation and environmental protection. The<br>
processing steps involved in recycling these polymers also involve high temperatures.<br>
In each one of these high temperature steps, particularly during the<br>
compounding/processing and reclaiming/recycling processes, some degree of polymer<br>
molecular weight degradation occurs. This molecular weight degradation may occur<br><br>
via high temperature hydrolysis, alcoholysis or other depolymerization mechanisms<br>
well know for these polycondensates. It is known that molecular weight degradation<br>
negatively affects the mechanical, thermal, and Theological properties of materials,<br>
thus preventing them from being used in demanding applications or from being<br>
recycled in large proportions for their original applications. Today, recycled or<br>
reprocessed polycondensates with deteriorated molecular weights can only be used in<br>
very low proportions in demanding applications or in larger proportions in less<br>
demanding applications. For instance, due to molecular weight degradation, recycled<br>
bottle grade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is mostly employed exclusively in fiber<br>
and other low end applications. Similarly, recycled polycarbonate from compact disk<br>
(CD) scrap, mostly goes to low end applications. For these reasons, the current<br>
recycling technologies are limited to a narrow range of applications.<br>
Today, there exist a considerable number of processes in the art	,<br>
employed to minimize loss in molecular weight and to maintain or even increase the<br>
molecular weight of the polycondensates for processing or recycling. Most of these<br>
routes employ as main processing equipment either an extruder, a solid state<br>
polycondensation reactor, or both in sequence, or similar equipment designed for melt<br>
or high viscosity material processing. As an instrumental part of any of these<br>
processes, chemical reactants known in the art as "chain extenders" are employed.<br>
Chain extenders are, for the most part, multi-functional molecules that are included as<br>
additives in the reactor or extruder during any or all of the described processing steps<br>
with the purpose of "re-coupling" polycondensate chains that have depolymerized to<br>
some degree. Normally the chain extender has two or more chemical groups that are<br>
reactive with the chemical groups formed during the molecular weight degradation<br>
process. By reacting the chain extender molecule with two or more polycondensate<br>
fragments it is possible to re-couple them (by bridging them), thus decreasing or even<br>
reverting the molecular weight degradation process. In the art there are numerous<br>
chain extender types and compositions, polycondensate formulations, and processing<br>
conditions described to this end.<br>
Di- or poly-functional epoxides, epoxy resins or other chemicals<br>
having two or more epoxy radicals, are an example of chain extending modifiers that<br><br>
have been used to increase the molecular weight of recycled polymers. These di- or<br>
poly-functional epoxides are generally made using conventional methods by reacting<br>
a epichlorohydrin with a molecule having two or more terminal active hydrogen<br>
groups. Examples of such chain extenders include bis-phenol type epoxy compounds<br>
prepared by the reaction of bisphenol A with epichlorohydrin, novolak type epoxy<br>
compounds prepared by reacting novolak resins with epichlorohydrin, polyglycidyl<br>
esters formed by reacting carboxylic acids with epichlorohydrin, and glycidyl ethers<br>
prepared from aliphatic alcohols and epichlorohydrin. Additionally, various acrylic<br>
copolymers have been used as polymer additives to improve the melt strength and<br>
melt viscosity of polyesters and polycarbonates. These additives generally include<br>
copolymers derived from various epoxy containing compounds and olefins, such as<br>
ethylene. However, these chain extenders have met with limited success in solving<br>
the problem of molecular weight degradation in reprocessed polymers. The	,<br>
shortcomings of these copolymer chain extenders can be attributed, at least in part, to<br>
the fact that they are produced by conventional polymerization techniques which<br>
produce copolymers of very high molecular weight, which when coupled with a<br>
polycondensate can dramatically increase the molecular weight leading to localized<br>
gelation and other defects with physical characteristics which limit their capacity to<br>
act as chain extenders.<br>
Two main problems persist today in the art. First, in order to have<br>
efficient chain extension at reasonable residence times (i.e., good productivity in a<br>
given size equipment) either in the extrusion or solid state reactor systems, most of<br>
the known chain extenders require the use of pre-dried polycondensate material,<br>
operation at high vacuum, and varying amounts of catalyst and stabilizers, to be<br>
employed during processing. Without these features the extent of molecular weight<br>
increase is limited and the resulting product shows lower molecular weight and less<br>
than desired properties.<br>
Second, as the functionality of the chain extender increases, so does<br>
the number of polycondensate chains that can be coupled onto each chain extender<br>
molecule, and thus its effectiveness in re-building molecular weight. However, it is<br>
easy to see that as the functionality of these chain extenders increase so does the<br><br>
potential for onset of gelation. People skilled in the art are familiar with the strong<br>
negative effects associated with extensive crosslinking on the degree of crystallinity<br>
and thus on the mechanical properties of a semi-crystalline polycondensate, as well as<br>
the negative implications of the presence of varying amounts of gel in any product.<br>
As a result of these negative effects there is a limit for the maximum functionality that<br>
can be employed with these chain extenders. Given, then, that the maximum<br>
functionality is limited, effective chain extension currently requires relatively large<br>
concentrations of lower functionality (
The relatively high costs associated with these two limitations of the<br>
current art render the re-processing or recycling of these polycondensates<br>
uneconomical.<br>
Still other disadvantages are associated with the presently available<br>
chain extenders. For example, phosphite-based chain extenders suffer from the<br>
disadvantage of being highly volatile, high viscosity liquids which are cumbersome to<br>
handle, susceptible to hydrolysis and suspected endocrine disrupters. Some ethylene<br>
based epoxy-functional chain extenders have the disadvantage of having high<br>
molecular weights compared to polycondensates, which alters the nature of resulting<br>
chain extended polymer, minimizing motility, increasing the chance for gel formation,<br>
and altering chemical resistance and clarity. Titanate- and zirconate-based chain<br>
extenders have the disadvantages of high cost, induced color in the product, difficult<br>
handling due to solvent dilutes, and viscosity reduction. Finally, isocyanate-based<br>
chain extenders suffer from toxicity concerns, reactivity to moisture and general<br>
handling problems.<br>
Thus a need exists for chain extenders that may be used in any suitable<br>
process while avoiding the processing limitations described above. Such chain<br>
extenders would provide substantial economic advantage in processing, reprocessing<br>
and recycling of polycondensates over existing chain extenders and the methods for<br>
their use.<br><br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to novehaligomeric and low molecular weight polymeric chain extenders, to<br>
methods for making the chain extenders, to methods for using the chain extenders to improve the<br>
physical characteristics of polycondensates and blends of polycondensates and to products made<br>
from the improved polycondensates and polycondensate blends. As used, herein, the terms<br>
"polycondensates" and the term "condensation polymers" are used broadly and synonymously to<br>
mean step-growth polymers. Thus, the for the purpose of this specification, the two terms may be<br>
used interchangeably. The chain extenders of this invention are particularly well suited for use<br>
with reprocessed or recycled plastics.<br>
The chain extenders of this invention, which are made from epoxy-functional (meth)^ acrylic<br>
monomers and non-functional (meth) acrylic and/or styrenic monomers, are characterized by<br>
certain physical and chemical properties that make them particularly suited as chain extenders.<br>
These properties can be tailored through the specific composition of the chain extenders and they<br>
include molecular weight, epoxy equivalent weight (EEW), number average epoxy functionality<br>
(Efn), and weight average epoxy functionality (Efw).<br>
One aspect of the invention provides a chain-extended polymeric composition comprising a chain<br>
t<br>
extender comprising a polymerization product of at least one epoxy-functional (meth) acrylic<br>
I monomer and at least one styrenic and/or (meth) acrylic monomer and at least one condensation<br>
■ polymer; wherein the chain extender has an epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) of from 180 to 2800,<br>
, a number-average epoxy functionality (Efn) value~6f"lesTThan IRTT^^weTght-average epoxy<br>
functionality (Efw) value of up to 140, and a number-average molecular weight (Mn) value of less<br>
i than 6000 and wherein at least a portion of the chain extender has reacted with at least a portion<br>
! of the at least one condensation polymer to produce a chain-extended condensation polymer<br>
j wherein the polymeric composition is substantially free of gel particles. ^-<br>
Another aspect of the invention provides chain-extended polymeric compositions made from a<br>
condensation polymer that has been chain extended with the chain extenders of the present<br>
invention. The invention also provides plastic articles made from the chain-extended polymeric<br>
compositions.<br><br><br>
Yet another aspect of the invention provides a method for increasing the molecular<br>
weight of a condensation polymer by reacting the condensation polymer with the chain<br>
extenders of the present invention.<br>
The chain extenders of the present invention provide several advantages over other<br>
presently available chain extenders. For example, by combining low molecular weights<br>
with low EEW values, the chain extenders are able to achieve a high degree of chain<br>
binding without inducing gelation using only small quantities. In addition, the chain<br>
extenders provide numerous processing advantages over other known chain extenders.<br>
These advantages include, the minimization or even elimination of the need to pre-dry the<br>
condensation polymer and the elimination of the need for a catalyst or high vacuum<br>
processing conditions to achieve effective chain extension. In addition, because the chain<br>
extenders of the invention are resistant to gelation, the chain extension may take place<br>
over much shorter residence times and under higher processing conditions than other<br>
chain extenders, making the processing more time and cost effective. Finally, unlike<br>
many conventional chain extenders, the chain extenders provided herein do not require<br>
solid state polymerization steps to increase the molecular weight of the polycondensates<br>
to desired levels.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of this invention provides epoxy-functional oligomeric and<br>
low molecular weight chain extenders for use with plastics, including reprocessed or<br>
recycled plastics. The chain extenders are capable of reverting the post-processing<br>
molecular weight decrease in different polycondensates from the minimum value<br>
reached without chain extension, back to the initial molecular weight values or even<br>
larger than the original molecular weight values, without the incidence of gel and<br>
without adverse effects on mechanical, thermal, or Theological properties at a target<br>
polycondensate molecular weight. This is accomplished through the proper design of<br>
the chain extenders which make it possible to increase the molecular weight of<br>
polycondensates such as polyesters, polyamides, polycarbonates and others, in a<br>
controlled manner. In particular, this aspect of the invention provides chain extenders<br>
made from the polymerization of at least one epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic<br>
monomer and at least one non-functional styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic monomer.<br>
The chain extenders are characterized by relatively low EEW values and relatively<br>
low molecular weights.<br>
The chain extenders of the present invention are epoxy-functional<br>
styrene (meth)acrylic copolymers produced from monomers of at least one epoxy-<br>
functional (meth)acrylic monomer and at least one non-functional styrenic and/or<br>
(meth)acrylic monomer. As used herein, the term (meth)acrylic includes both acrylic<br>
and methacrylic monomers. Examples of epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomers<br>
for use in the present invention include both acrylates and methacrylates. Examples i<br>
of these monomers include, but are not limited to, those containing 1,2-epoxy groups<br>
such as glycidyl acrylate and glycidyl methacrylate. Other suitable epoxy-functional<br>
monomers include allyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl ethacrylate, and glycidyl itoconate.<br><br>
Suitable acrylate and methacrylate monomers for use in the chain<br>
extenders include, but are not limited to, methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, n-propyl<br>
acrylate, i-propyl acrylate, n-butyl acrylate, s-butyl acrylate, i-butyl acrylate, t-butyl<br>
acrylate, n-amyl acrylate, i-amyl acrylate, isobornyl acrylate, n-hexyl acrylate, 2-<br>
ethylbutyl acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, n-octyl acrylate, n-decyl acrylate,<br>

methacrylate, ethyl methacrylate, n-propyl methacrylate, n-butyl methacrylate, i-<br>
propyl methacrylate, i-butyl methacrylate, n-amyl methacrylate, n-hexyl methacrylate,<br>

methacrylate, methylcyclohexyl methacrylate, cinnamyl methacrylate, crotyl<br>
methacrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate, cyclopentyl methacrylate, 2-ethoxyethyl<br>
methacrylate, and isobornyl methacrylate. Non-functional acrylate and non-<br>
functional methacrylate monomers include butyl acrylate, butyl methacrylate, methyl<br>
methacrylate, iso-butyl methacrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, cyclohexyl methacrylate,<br>
isobornyl acrylate and isobornyl methacrylate and combinations thereof are<br>
particularly suitable. Styrenic monomers for use in the present invention include, but<br>
are not limited to, styrene, alpha-methyl styrene, vinyl toluene, p-methyl styrene, t-<br>
butyl styrene, o-chlorostyrene, vinyl pyridine, and mixtures of these species. In<br>
certain embodiments the styrenic monomers for use in the present invention are<br>
styrene and alpha-methyl styrene.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the chain extenders contain about<br>
50 % to about 80 % by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers, of at least<br>
one epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer and between about 20 % and about 50<br>
% by weight of at least one styrenic monomer. In other embodiments, the chain<br>
extenders contain between about 25 % and about 50 % by weight of at least one<br>
epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer, between about 15 % to about 30 % by<br>
weight of at least one styrenic monomer, and between about 20 % and about §0 % by<br>
weight of at least one non-functional acrylate and/or methacrylate monomer. In yet<br>
another embodiment of the invention, the chain extenders contain about 50 % to about<br>
80 % by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers, of at least one epoxy-<br>
functional (meth)acrylic monomer and between about 15 % and about 45 % by weight<br><br>
of at least one styrenic monomer and between about 0 % to about 5 % by weight of at<br>
least one non-functional acrylate and/or methacrylate monomer. In still another<br>
embodiment, the chain extenders contain between about 5 % and about 25 % by<br>
weight of at least one epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer, between about 50 %<br>
to about 95 % by weight of at least one styrenic monomer, and between about 0 %<br>
and about 25 % by weight of at least one non-functional acrylate and/or methacrylate<br>
monomer.<br>
The present invention is based, at least in part, on the inventors'<br>
surprising discovery that styrene (meth)acrylic chain extenders having certain<br>
physical properties produce superior results at lower loadings than conventional chain<br>
extenders. Specifically, the inventors' have found that by combining low molecular<br>
weights with low EEW values, the chain extenders are able to achieve a high degree<br>
of chain binding without inducing gelation. This allows the present chain extenders to<br>
be more effective at lower loadings than other chain extenders and produce chain<br>
extended condensation polymers that are substantially free from gel particles. In<br>
addition, these properties lead to a variety of processing advantages which will be<br>
discussed in more detail below. As used herein, the phrase "substantially free from<br>
gel particles" means the chain extension reaction takes place in such a manner that gel<br>
particle formation is avoided to any extent.<br>
Without wishing or intending to be bound to any particular theory of<br>
the invention, the inventors believe the surprising advantages of the epoxy-functional<br>
chain extenders of this invention result from favorable combinations of certain Efh,<br>
PDI, and EEW values possessed by these oligomers and low molecular weight<br>
polymers. These characteristics are believed to allow for the maximization of<br>
polycondensate molecular weight increase at a given chain extender load, without the<br>
incidence of gel and without adverse effects on the mechanical, thermal, or<br>
rheological properties at a target polycondensate molecular weight. Specifically, the<br>
present invention provides novel chain extenders having the following characteristics:<br>
1) very high number average epoxy functionality(Efn): Efh values of up to about 30,<br>
and, in some cases, even higher than 30, including Efh values ranging from 2 to 20,<br>
and further including Efh values ranging from 3 to 10; 2) controlled PDI values<br><br>
ranging from about 1.5 to about 5, including ranges from about 1.75 to about 4, and<br>
further including ranges from about 2 to about 3.5; 3) low epoxy equivalent weight<br>
(EEW): from about 2800 to about 180, including from about 1,400 to about 190, and<br>
further including from about 700 to about 200; 4) very low molecular weights<br>
(number average molecular weight (Mn) 
(Mw) 
chain extender into the polycondensate melt. The molecular weight ranges above<br>
include various embodiments wherein Mn ranges from 1000 to about 5000, including<br>
from 1500 to 4000, and further including from 2000 to 3000. The molecular weight<br>
ranges above also include various embodiments wherein Mw ranges from 1500 to<br>
about 18000, including from 3000 to 13000, and further including from 4000 to 8500.<br>
In addition, the chain extenders possess a wide range of solubility parameters tailored<br>
for high solubility in polycondensates. In various exemplary embodiments, the chain<br>
extenders have an EEW of from about 180 to about 300, an Efh value from about 4 to<br>
about 12 and a PDI of from about 1.5 to about 2.8. In other exemplary embodiments,<br>
the chain extenders have an EEW of from about 300 to about 500, an Efh value of<br>
from about 4 to about 12 and a PDI of from about 2.8 to about 3.2. In still other<br>
exemplary embodiments, the chain extenders have an EEW of from about 500 to<br>
about 700, an Efn value of from about 4 to about 12 and a PDI of from about 3.2 to<br>
about 4.5.<br>
The desired epoxy equivalent weight (EEW) is fixed by the desired<br>
content of the epoxy-functional monomer employed {GMA or other). Additionally, at<br>
a given EEW, the Efh per chain can be tailored from very low to very high (e.g. &gt; 30)<br>
by controlling the Mn of the oligomer. Moreover, for a given EEW the Efw can be<br>
designed by altering the polydispersity index of the oligomer (PDI = Mw/Mn =<br>
Efw/Efn) through changes in composition, processing conditions, and molecular<br>
weight. Suitable values of Efw include values of up to about 140, or even higher than<br>
140, including Efw values ranging from 3 to 65, and further including values ranging<br>
from 6 to 45.<br>
The chain extenders may by produced according to standard techniques well<br>
known in the art. Such techniques include, but are not limited to, continuous bulk<br><br>
polymerization processes, batch, and semi-batch polymerization processes.<br>
Production techniques that are well suited for the chain extenders are described in<br>
United States Patent Application No. 09/354,350 and United States Patent Application<br>
No. 09/614,402, the entire disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
1 Briefly, these processes involve continuously charging into a reactor at least one<br>
epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer, at least one styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic<br>
monomer, and optionally one or more other monomers thaJ^e^qlj^m^rizable with<br>
the epoxy-functional monomer, the styrenic monomer, and/or the (meth)acrylic<br>
monomer. This process surprisingly produces oligomeric or low molecular weight<br>
copolymer compositions having epoxy equivalent weights, number average epoxy<br>
functionalities (Efh), weight average epoxy functionalities (Efw), and polydispersiry<br>
indexes (PDI) (PDI=Efw -s- Efh) which dramatically increase the molecular weight of<br>
reprocessed plastics without gelation when used in small quantities in the absence of<br>
any pretreatment or additionaljca,taIysts.<br>
The proportion of monomers charged into the reactor may be the same as<br>
those proportions that go into the chain extenders discussed above. Thus, in some<br>
embodiments, the reactor may be charged with about 50 % to about 80 %, by weight,<br>
of at least one epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer and with about 20 % to about<br>
50 %, by weight, of at least one styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic monomer.<br>
Alternatively, the reactor may be charged with from about 25 % to about 50 %, by<br>
weight, of at least one epoxy-fimctional{meth)acrylic monomer and with about 50 %<br>
to about 75 %, by weight, of at least one styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic monomer. In<br>
other embodiments the reactor may be charged with from about 5 % to about 25 %, be<br>
weight, of at least one epoxy-functional {meth)acrylic monomer and with about 75 %<br>
to about 95 %, by weight, of at least one styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic monomer.<br>
The reactor may also optionally be charged with at least one free radical<br>
polymerization initiator and/or one or more solvents. Examples of suitable initiators<br>
and solvents are provided in United States Patent Application No. 09/354,350.<br>
Briefly, the initiators suitable for carrying out the process according to the present<br>
invention are compounds which decompose thermally into radicals in a first order<br>
reaction, although this is not a critical factor. Suitable initiators include those with<br><br>
half-life periods in the radical decomposition process of about 1 hour at temperatures<br>
greater or equal to 90°C and further include those with half-life periods in the radical<br>
decomposition process of about 10 hours at temperatures greater or equal to 100°C.<br>
Others with about 10 hour half-lives at temperatures significantly lower than 100°C<br>
may also be used. Suitable initiators are, for example, aliphatic azo compounds such<br>
as 1-t-amylazo-l-cyanocyclohexane, azo-bis-isobutyronitrile and 1-t-butylazo-<br>
cyanocyclohexane, 2,2'-azo-bis-(2-methyl)butyronitrile and peroxides and<br>
hydroperoxides, such as t-butylperoctoate, t-butyl perbenzoate, dicumyl peroxide, di-<br>
t-butyl peroxide, t-butyl hydroperoxide, cumene hydroperoxide, di-t-amyl peroxide<br>
and the like. Additionally, di-peroxide initiators may be used alone or in combination<br>
with other initiators. Such di-peroxide initiators include, but are not limited to, 1,4-<br>
bis-(t-butyl peroxycarbo)cyclohexane, 1,2-di(t-butyl peroxy)cyclohexane, and 2,5-<br>
di(t-butyl peroxy)hexyne-3, and other similar initiators well known in the art. The »<br>
initiators di-t-butyl peroxide and di-t-amyl peroxide are particularly suited for use in<br>
the invention.<br>
The initiator may be added with the monomers. The initiators may be added<br>
in any appropriate amount, but preferably the total initiators are added in an amount<br>
of about 0.0005 to about 0.06 moles initiator's) per mole of monomers in the feed.<br>
For this purpose initiator is either admixed with the monomer feed or added to the<br>
process as a separate feed.<br>
The solvent may be fed into the reactor together with the monomers, or in a<br>
separate feed. The solvent may be any solvent well known in the art, including those<br>
that do not react with the epoxy functionality on the epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic<br>
monomer(s) at the high temperatures of the continuous process described herein. The<br>
proper selection of solvent may help decrease or eliminate the gel particle formation<br>
during the continuous, high temperature reaction of the present invention. Such<br>
solvents include, but are not limited to, xylene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, Aromatic-<br>
100®, Aromatic 150®, Aromatic 200® (all Aromatics available from Exxon), acetone,<br>
methylethyl ketone, methyl amyl ketone, methyl-isobutyl ketone, n-methyl<br>
pyrrolidinone, and combinations thereof. When used, the solvents are present in any<br>
amount desired, taking into account reactor conditions and monomer feed. In one<br><br>
embodiment, one or more solvents are present in an amount of up to 40 % by weight,<br>
up to 15 % by weight in a certain embodiment, based on the total weight of the<br>
monomers.<br>
The reactor is maintained at an effective temperature for an effective period of<br>
time to cause polymerization of the monomers to produce a oligomeric or low<br>
molecular weight chain extender from the monomers.<br>
A continuous polymerization process allows for a short residence time within<br>
the reactor. The residence time is generally less than one hour, and may be less than<br>
15 minutes. In some embodiments, the residence time is generally less than 30<br>
minutes, and may be less than 20 minutes.<br>
The process for producing the chain extenders may be conducted using any<br>
type of reactor well-known in the art, and may be set up in a continuous<br>
configuration. Such reactors include, but are not limited to, continuous stirred tank »<br>
reactors ("CSTRs"), tube reactors, loop reactors, extruder reactors, or any reactor<br>
suitable for continuous operation.<br>
A form of CSTR which has been found suitable for producing the chain<br>
extenders is a tank reactor provided with cooling coils and/or cooling jackets<br>
sufficient to remove any heat of polymerization not taken up by raising the<br>
temperature of the continuously charged monomer composition so as to maintain a<br>
preselected temperature for polymerization therein. Such a CSTR may be provided<br>
with at least one, and usually more, agitators to provide a well-mixed reaction zone.<br>
Such CSTR may be operated at varying filling levels from 20 to 100 % foil (liquid<br>
full reactor LFR). In one embodiment the reactor is more than 50 % full but less than<br>
100 % foil. In another embodiment the reactor is 100 % liquid full.<br>
The continuous polymerization is carried out at high temperatures. In<br>
one embodiment, the polymerization temperatures range from about 180°C to about<br>
350°C, this includes embodiments where the temperatures range from about 190°C to<br>
about 325°C, and more further includes embodiment where the temperatures range<br>
from about 200°C to about 300°C. In another embodiment, the temperature may<br>
range from about 200°C to about 275°C. Due to their high temperature synthesis the<br>
chain extenders of this invention show high thermal stability when used later in chain<br><br>
extending applications in condensation polymer compositions processed at similar<br>
temperature ranges. In contrast other chain extenders presently available undergo<br>
degradation and gas evolution under these conditions.<br>
A second aspect of the invention provides chain extended polymeric<br>
compositions made by reacting the chain extendersof the present invention with<br>
condensation polymers to form a substantially gel free jshain extended condensation<br>
polymer composition. Suitable condensation polymers include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyesters (PEs), polyamides (PAs), polycarbonates (PCs), polyurethanes (PUs),<br>
polyacetals, polysulfones, polyphenylene ethers (PPEs), polyether sulfones,<br>
polyimides, polyether imides, polyether ketones, polyether-ether ketones,<br>
polyarylether ketones, polyarylates, polyphenylene sulfides and polyalkyls. In one<br>
embodiment of the invention the condensation polymer is a polyester selected from<br>
the family of polyethylene terephthalates (PETs), polypropylene terephthalates	,<br>
(PPTs), and polybutylene terephthalates (PBTs). In another embodiment the<br>
condensation polymer is a reprocessed or recycled condensation polymer. As used<br>
herein, the term reprocessed means a polymer reclaimed from a production facility<br>
originally scrapped for not meeting quality control or specification targets. Amongst<br>
these can be included products out of specification from compounding, extrusion, or<br>
molding start-up and shut down production and/or products from general production<br>
out of specification or otherwise not meeting product quality specifications. Also<br>
included in the definition of reprocessed products are products processed to final use<br>
form but not meeting product specifications, such as product out of caliber or<br>
dimensions, color, shape, etc., or waste process material such as injection runners,<br>
edges, trim and flashes, etc. As used herein the term recycled condensation polymer<br>
means a condensation plastic reclaimed a posteriori from its final use from diverse<br>
sources, this include but is not limited to scrap from soda bottles, detergent bottles,<br>
plastic toys, engine components, assembled plastic components, films, fibers, CDs,<br>
DVDs, and the like.<br>
The polyesters may be homo- or copolyesters that are derived from<br>
aliphatic, cycloaliphatic or aromatic dicarboxylic acids and diols or<br>
hydroxycarboxylic acids. In addition, mixtures of these polyesters or of polyesters<br><br>
with further plastics are also suitable, for example blends of PBT/PC,<br>
PBT/acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS), PET/PA, and the like. Their composition<br>
will depend essentially on the desired properties for a specific end use. Such<br>
polyesters are well known in the art. Particularly suitable polyesters are PET, PBT<br>
and corresponding copolymers and blends, as exemplified by PBT/PC, PBT/ASA,<br>
PBT/ABS, PET/ABS, PET/PC or also PBT/PET/PC, which predominantly contain the<br>
indicated polyesters; PET and its copolymers as well as PBT blends being the<br>
preferred choice in certain embodiments.<br>
As used herein, the term polyamide includes various well known<br>
polyamide resins. These include polyamides produced by polycondensing a<br>
dicarboxylic acid with a diamine, polyamides produced by polymerizing a cyclic<br>
lactam, and polyamides produced by co-polymerizing a cyclic lactam with a<br>
dicarboxylic acid/diamine salt. The polyamides useful for this invention also include<br>
polyamide elastomer resins. Polyamide resins that are particularly suitable for use in<br>
the present invention include nylon 6, nylon 6-6, nylon 6-10, nylon 11, nylon 12, and<br>
co-polymers and blends thereof.<br>
As used herein, the term polycarbonate includes various well known<br>
polycarbonate resins. These include aromatic polycarbonates produced by reactions<br>
of bisphenols with carbonic acid derivatives such as those made from bis-phenol A<br>
(2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane) and phosgene or diphenyl carbonate. Various<br>
modified polycarbonates and copolycarbonates made from other types of bisphenols<br>
such as those where phenolic radicals in the para position are bridged via C, O, S or<br>
alkylene are also included. Polyester carbonates made from one or more aromatic<br>
dicarboxylic acids or hydroxycarboxylic acids, bisphenols and carbonic acid<br>
derivatives are also included. Polycarbonate resins made from bis-phenol A and<br>
carbonic acid derivatives are particularly suitable for this invention.<br>
The thermoplastic polyurethanes of the present invention may be made<br>
by any conventional process, as known in the art. Typical polyurethanes are made<br>
from a polyol intermediate and generally an equivalent amount of a polyisocyanate.<br>
The polyol intermediate is generally a liquid polyether polyol or a polyester polyol or<br>
combinations thereof.<br><br>
Polyether polyols that are use to produce the polyurethanes are<br>
generally made by reacting an alkylene oxide, such as propylene oxide, with a strong<br>
base such as potassium hydroxide, optionally in the presence of water, glycols and the<br>
like. Other polyethers which can be utilized include, but are not limited to, those<br>
which are produced by polymerization of tetrahydrofuran or epoxides such as<br>
epichlorohydrin, ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide, styrene oxide, for<br>
example in the presence of Lewis catalysts such as boron trifluoride, or by the<br>
addition of epoxides, optionally mixed or in succession, onto starter components with<br>
reactive hydrogen atoms such as water, alcohols, ammonia, or amines.<br>
The polyester polyols that may be used to form the thermoplastic<br>
polyurethanes may be formed from the condensation of one or more polyhydric<br>
alcohols with one or more polycarbpxylic acids. Examples of suitable polyhydric<br>
alcohols include the following: ethylene glycol, propylene glycol such as 1,2-	•<br>
propylene glycol and 1,3-propylene glycol, glycerol; pentaerythritol;<br>
trifnethylolpropane; 1,4,6-octanetriol; butanediol; pentanediol; hexanediol;<br>
dodecanediol; octanediol; chloropentanediol, glycerol monallyl ether; glycerol<br>
monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol; 2-ethylhexanediol-l,4; cyclohexanediol-1,4;<br>

butylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, l,4-brs-(hydroxymethyl)cyclohexane, trimethy-<br>
lolethane, together with di-, tri-, tetra-, and higher polyethylene glycols, di- and higher<br>
polypropylene glycols, together with di- and higher polybutylene glycols, and the like.<br>
Examples of polycarboxylic acids include the following: phthalic acid; isophthalic<br>
acid; terephthalic acid; tetrachlorophthalic acid; maleic acid; dodecylmaleic acid;<br>
octadecenylmaleic acid; fumaric acid; aconitic acid; trimellitic acid; tricarballylic<br>
acid; 3,3'-thiodipropionic acid; succinic acid; adipic acid; malonic acid, glutaric acid,<br>
pimelic acid, sebacic acid, cyclohexane-l,2-dicarboxyIic acid; 1,4-cyclohexadiene-<br>
1,2-dicarboxylic acid; 3-methyl-3,5-cyclohexadiene-l,2-dicarboxylic acid and the<br>
corresponding acid anhydrides such as tetrahydrophthalic anhydride,<br>
hexahydrophthalic anhydride, tetrachlorophthalic anhydride,<br>
endomethylenetetrahydrophthalic anhydride, acid chlorides and acid esters such as<br>
phthalic anhydride, phthaloyl chloride and the dimethyl ester of phthalic acid,<br><br>
dimerized and trimerized unsaturated fatty acids, optionally mixed with monomeric<br>
unsaturated fatty acids, terephthalic acid monomethyl ester and terephthalic acid<br>
monoglycol ester.<br>
The polyacetals usable in the present thermoplastic resin compositions<br>
are crystalline thermoplastic resins, sometimes called polyoxymethylene (POM).<br>
Suitable polyacetals are, for example, the compounds obtainable from the reaction of<br>
glycols, such as diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 4,4'-dioxethoxy diphenyl<br>
dimethyl methane and hexane diol, with formaldehyde. Polyacetals suitable for use in<br>
accordance with the present invention may also be obtained by the polymerization of<br>
cyclic acetals. Other specific examples of polyacetals include formaldehyde<br>
homopolymers and copolymers of trioxane (i.e., trimer of formaldehyde) and a small<br>
amount of cyclic ethers such as ethylene oxide and 1,3-dioxane.<br>
Chain extension of the polycondensates may be accomplished through<br>
any conventional mean, many of which are known in the art. For example, chain<br>
extension of the polycondensates may be accomplished through dry tumbling together<br>
or cofeeding a chain extender with a desired polycondensate. The chain extender may<br>
then be melt or solution blended with the polycondensate by methods well known in<br>
the art, such as by reactive extrusion. In addition, other suitable formulation<br>
ingredients such as pigments, fillers, reinforzants, or additives such as stabilizers,<br>
antioxidants, lubricants, and/or any other additives known in the art needed for<br>
specific applications may be added to the formula in typical amounts. Examples of<br>
suitable reactors for reactive extrusion include single and twin screw extruders<br>
systems, of different screw designs, configurations, L/D and compression ratios,<br>
operating at suitable RPM's to provide the prescribed average residence times at<br>
known feed rates. Other suitable reactors include Banbury mixers, Farrell continuous<br>
mixers, Buss co-kneaders, and roll mills. These systems may operate at temperatures<br>
above the Tg of the chain extender and above the Tg and/or Tm of the polycondensate<br>
in what is known in the art as reactive extrusion. The average residence time in the<br>
reactor may vary, but the chain extenders of the present invention need only short<br>
residence times compared to other presently available chain extenders. Typically, the<br>
residence times will range from about 0.5 to about 15 minutes. This includes<br><br>
embodiments where the residence time is from about 1 minute to about 10 minutes<br>
and further includes embodiments where the residence time is from about 2 minutes<br>
to about 7 minutes.<br>
The chain extending operations can be followed by plastic forming<br>
operations such as extrusion, molding and fiber spinning. The reactive extrusion can<br>
also take place within primary processing equipment without pre-compounding.<br>
Alternatively, the compounding may be followed by a finishing step such as solid<br>
state polymerization and may be processed in any reactor system and configuration<br>
operating at temperatures above the Tg of the chain extender and between the Tg and<br>
Tm of the polycondensate for an average residence time between 1 and 24 hours,<br>
including from 2 to 18 hours, and further including 3 to 12 hours. Examples of<br>
suitable reactors for solid state polymerization are well know in the art, and<br>
operational modes of the same include batch, semi-batch and continuous solid state ,<br>
polymerization. In one embodiment, the blend, co-feed, or separate-feed is processed<br>
in a combination process comprising suitable arrays of reactive extrusion and solid<br>
state polymerization processes known in the art, operating within the ranges given<br>
above, and in which chain extender may be added to either or both stages.<br>
Processing may be followed by a polymer recovery and a pelletization<br>
stage to obtain pellets or granules of the chain extended polycondensates suitable for<br>
further processing.<br>
Because the chain extenders provide low EEWs they are effective<br>
even in very small quantities. In some embodiments of the invention, the chain<br>
extender is present in an amount of about 5 % (w/w) or less, about 3 % (w/w) or less,<br>
about 2 % (w/w) or less, about 1 % (w/w) or less, and even about 0.5 % (w/w) or less,<br>
based on the total weight of the mixture. This includes embodiments where the chain<br>
extender is present in an amount of from about 0.01 to about 5 % (w/w), based on<br>
total weight of the mixture, and further includes embodiments where the chain<br>
extender is present in an amount of from about 0.03 to 4 %, or from about 0.05 to 2.5<br>
% (w/w) based on the total weight of the mixture. It follows that the condensation<br>
polymer may be present in an amount of up to 99.99 % (w/w), 99.95 % (w/w), 99.5 %<br><br>
(w/w), 99 % (w/w), 98 % (w/w), 97 % (w/w), or 95 % (w/w) based on the total weight<br>
of the mixture.<br>
The chain extenders of the present invention provide a number of<br>
processing advantages compared to other chain extenders. For example, pre-drying of<br>
the polycondensate is not required prior to chain extension. This is of particular<br>
commercial advantage as pre-drying adds cost and complexity to the process of<br>
recycling by requiring another process step as well as more time. In addition, unlike<br>
many of the chain extenders currently available, the chain extenders of the present<br>
invention do not require the addition of a catalyst or high vacuum operation in order<br>
to drive the reaction to the desired extent. This significantly reduces processing costs.<br>
Thus, in various embodiments of the invention, the chain-extended condensation<br>
polymers are substantially free of gel particles, are produced without pre-drying the<br>
condensation polymer, and are produced by reacting the chain extenders and_the<br>
condensation polymers in a single stage of conventional equipment in the absence of<br>
additional catalyst and/or without vacuum operation. Furthermore, in some of these<br>
embodiments, the chain extended polycondensates obtained have molecular weights<br>
that are similar to or higher than those obtained through solid state polymerizaion, and<br>
have properties that are similar or even better than those obtained through solid state<br>
polymerization, thus allowing for the replacement of expensive and cumbersome solid<br>
state polymerization processes by simpler reactive extrusion processes.<br>
The chain extenders of the present invention have demonstrated<br>
enhanced ability to restore or even improve the properties of reprocessed or recycled<br>
condensation polymers or of lower grade virgin condensation polymers. The<br>
improvements provided by the chain extenders can be seen directly in the physical<br>
properties of the chain extended condensation polymers compared to the same<br>
properties in the unmodified low grade virgin condensation polymers or reprocessed<br>
or recycled condensation polymers. The efficacy of chain extension and molecular<br>
weight increase can be assessed in a number of different ways. Some common<br>
methods for the assessment of chain extension are change in melt viscosity, which<br>
may be measured by capillary rheometry, melt flow index (MFI), cone-and-plate or<br>
parallel plate rheometry. Other common methods are based on changes in solution<br><br>
viscosity, which may be measured for example by Ostwall-Fenske or Ubbelohde<br>
capillary viscometers as changes in relative, inherent, or intrinsic viscosity (I.V.).<br>
The chain extenders of the present invention are very effective at<br>
increasing the molecular weight of reprocessed or recycled condensation polymers.<br>
This is evidenced by the increase in the intrinsic viscosity of the condensation<br>
polymers following chain extension. For example, in some instances the chain<br>
extenders may increase the intrinsic viscosity of the chain extended condensation<br>
polymer back to within 15 % of the intrinsic viscosity of the condensation polymer<br>
prior to recycling or reprocessing, where intrinsic viscosity is measured according to<br>
ASTM D-2857. This includes embodiments where the intrinsic viscosity of the chain<br>
extended condensation polymer may increase back to within 10 % of the intrinsic<br>
viscosity of the condensation polymer prior to recycling or reprocessing, and further<br>
»<br>
includes embodiments where the intrinsic viscosity of the chain extended<br>
condensation polymer may increase back to within 5 % of the intrinsic viscosity of the<br>
condensation polymer prior to recycling or reprocessing.<br>
In some cases, the intrinsic viscosity of the chain extended<br>
condensation polymers is actually higher than the initial intrinsic viscosity of the<br>
condensation polymers before they underwent recycling or reprocessing. This<br>
includes embodiments where the intrinsic viscosity of the chain extended<br>
condensation polymer is increased by at least 2 %, at least 5 %, at least 10 %, at least<br>
20 %, at least 30 %, at least 40 %, and even at least 50 % with respect to the<br>
condensation polymer from which the recycled or reprocessed condensation polymer<br>
was produced. In some instances the chain extenders may increase the intrinsic<br>
viscosity of the chain extended condensation polymers, as described above, without<br>
any need from pre-drying the condensation polymer, catalyst, vacuum operation, or<br>
solid state polymerization steps.<br>
The increase in the viscosity of the condensation polymers following<br>
chain extension may also be measured by melt viscosity as measured by capillary<br>
rheometry. For example, in some instances the chain extenders may increase the melt<br>
viscosity of the chain extended condensation polymer as measured by capillary<br>
rheometry at 100 s"1, by up to 300 % relative to the initial post-processing melt<br><br>
viscosity of the condensation polymer. This includes embodiments where this<br>
increase in melt viscosity is realized without the need for any pre-drying of the<br>
condensation polymer, catalyst, vacuum operation, or solid state polymerization steps.<br>
The increase in the molecular weight of the condensation polymers<br>
following chain extension is also demonstrated by the decrease in the melt flow index<br>
(MFI) of the condensation polymer after chain extension has occurred. For example,<br>
in some instances the melt flow index (MFI) of the chain extended condensation<br>
polymer, as measured by ASTM-D-1238, may be only about 60 % or less of the MFI<br>
of the reprocessed or recycled condensation polymer or of the initial MFI of a low<br>
grade condensation polymer. This includes embodiments where this decrease in MFI<br>
is realized in a melt blending process without the need for any pre-drying of the<br>
condensation polymer, catalyst, vacuum operation, or solid state polymerization steps.<br>
Due to their ability to provide recycled or processed materials with '<br>
properties equivalent to those of the un-recycled or un-processed materials, the chain<br>
extenders of the present invention have the advantage that more of the recycled or<br>
reprocessed material can be incorporated into the final product. The chain extenders<br>
have the further advantage that the mechanical, thermal and impact properties of<br>
chain extended polycondensates are not negatively impacted and in many instances<br>
are enhanced with respect to those of the un-recycled or un-processed<br>
polycondensates.<br>
The chain extenders may be used with lower grade virgin<br>
polycondensates in order to make such polycondensates suitable for uses which they<br>
otherwise would not be. For example, a chain extended lower grade condensation<br>
polymer, such as a polyester, according to the invention, may have an intrinsic<br>
viscosity that permits the polymer to be used in more demanding application. This<br>
includes embodiments where the intrinsic viscosity of the chain extended lower grade<br>
condensation polymer is increased by at least 2 %, at least 5 %, at least 10 %, at least<br>
20 %, at least 30 %, at least 40 %, and even at least 50 % by reaction with a chain<br>
extender. "Lower grade" polycondensate, as used herein, means a resin grade with<br>
comparatively lower molecular weight with respect to other grades in the same<br>
chemical family, exhibited as lower I.V., or lower melt viscosity at given conditions,<br><br>
which also results in lower physical properties than the other grades in the same<br>
family.<br>
Applications of this invention include, but are not limited to, recycling<br>
of scrap plastics, such as polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, and blends and<br>
alloys of scrap plastics by either a reactive extrusion or a solid state polymerization<br>
process of this invention, and post-processing of the recycled material through<br>
extrusion/blow molding into various articles including, but not limited to, food or<br>
non-food contact containers and transparent colored applications, films, coatings,<br>
tapes, moldings, fibers, strapping and other consumer products.<br>
In general the epoxy-functional oligomeric or polymeric chain<br>
extenders of this invention show storage stability, safety of handling, no need for<br>
catalysts for effective chain extension, resistance to hydrolysis, and low volatility.<br>
The chain extenders may take the form of solids, or low viscosity liquids, or easy to<br>
handle wax forms.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The chain extenders of this invention provide several benefits in a<br>
variety of applications. These chain extenders when used by PET resin manufacturers<br>
provide intrinsic viscosity enhancement in single reactive steps with no need for or<br>
shorter solid state time, improvement in melt strength, improvement in compatibility<br>
with other types of plastics, aid in processing due to reduced need for drying, and can<br>
act as acetaldehyde scavengers. These chain extenders can be used in single reactive<br>
extrusion equipment as substitutes for solid state polymerization in recycling of PET.<br>
Compounders can benefit from the improved compatibility with other types of<br>
plastics, such as other polyesters, polycarbonates, polyamides, etc. Converters can<br>
benefit from improved extrusion blow molding and melt strength, injection blow-<br>
molding, crystallinity and toughness in blow molding operations. In foamed sheets<br>
benefits can be expected due to the countered effects of endothermic foaming agents.<br>
In industrial fabrics the use of these chain extenders can improve coating adhesion,<br>
tenacity and melt strength. Use of these chain extenders in tire cord can provide<br><br>
improved coating adhesion, acid neutralization and metal complexation. In films,<br>
these chain extenders can provide improved toughness, improved melt strength and<br>
higher draw-down ratios. For fiber producers, the chain extenders of the disclosed<br>
invention can provide improved tensile strength and improved dyeability when using<br>
disperse, acid or basic dyes. In certain exemplary embodiments where the<br>
condensation polymer is a polyester, the chain extender may contain about 50 % to<br>
about 80 % by weight of at least one epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer based<br>
on the total weight of the monomers and between about 20 % and about 50 % by<br>
weight of at least one styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic monomer.<br>
These chain extenders also have several benefits when used with<br>
polycarbonates. PC resin manufacturers can benefit from molecular weight<br>
enhancement, branching agent-notch sensitivity and improved compatibility for alloys<br>
with PET, PBT, polyamides, etc. The recyclers of PC can reclaim CD and digital '<br>
video disks (DVD) for engineering applications and may also benefit due to the<br>
stabilization of mixed source regrind due to the acid scavenging and metal chelating<br>
properties of the chain extenders. Compounders of PC can benefit due to improved<br>
compatibility with other types of plastics as well as due to an upgrade of high flow<br>
resins. Plastic converters can benefit from aid in processing for long dwell time<br>
moldings, reduced sensitivity to residual moisture, structural foamed parts with<br>
endothermic foaming agents, improved melt strength for extrusions and reduced<br>
sensitivity to metals (pigments, waxes). In certain embodiments where the<br>
condensation polymer is a polycarbonate, the chain extender may contain about 45 %<br>
to about 80 % by weight of at least one epoxy-functional (meth)acrylic monomer<br>
based on the total weight of the monomers and between about 20 % and about 55 %<br>
by weight of at least one styrenic and/or (meth)acrylic monomer.<br>
In the area of polyamide resin manufacture the chain extenders of this<br>
invention provide enhancement of inherent viscosity, improved compatibility for<br>
alloys with PET, PC, PBT, POM, etc., and dimensional stability. For compounders of<br>
polyamide resins, these chain extenders improve compatibility for alloys, upgrade<br>
hydrolyzed material and aid in processing by reducing the need to pre-dry the<br>
polymer. These chain extenders allow recycling of mixed carpet waste of PET and<br><br>
PA. For converters of PA, these chain extenders improve fiber tenacity, improve<br>
coating adhesion for tire cord, improve wear resistance and act as dye coupling<br>
agents. In certain embodiments where the condensation polymer is a polyamide, the<br>
chain extender may contain 25 % to about 55 % by weight of at least one epoxy-<br>
functional (meth)acrylic monomer based on the total weight of the monomers and<br>
between about 45 % and about 75 % by weight of at least one styrenic and/or<br>
(meth)acrylic monomer.<br>
In post-reaction finishing of POM resins, these chain extenders can act<br>
as formaldehyde scavengers, acid scavenger-process aids, secondary scavenger and<br>
branching agents to control crystallization, provide benefits in reduced warpage and<br>
shrinkage and improve toughness and wear resistance. Compounders of POM resins<br>
can benefit from these chain extenders due to their ability to acts as process aids (acid<br>
scavengers), formaldehyde scavengers, fiberglass coupling agents, coupling agents for<br>
impact modifiers and chelators for metals (pigments, waxes). The converters of POM<br>
resins also benefit from the chain extenders of this invention due to their ability to act<br>
as process aids and formaldehyde scavengers and their ability to improve wear<br>
resistance, melt strength for extruded profiles, and paint and metallization adhesion.<br>
For the manufacturers of PBT resins, the chain extenders of this<br>
invention provide enhancement of inherent viscosity without solid state<br>
polymerization and compatibilization for alloys. These chain extenders benefit the<br>
compounders of PBT resins due to the use of lower cost impact modifiers and reduced<br>
moisture sensitivity during processing. For converters of PBT resins, these chain<br>
extenders act as process aids by improving melt viscosity. In some embodiments,<br>
these resins may also chelate metals.<br>
In the manufacture of TPU resins, the chain extenders of this invention<br>
act as crosslinkers for magnetic tape coatings and as process aid to minimize moisture<br>
damage. For the compounders of TPU resins, these chain extenders provide benefits<br>
in ether-ester alloys, PVC, NBR, etc., and act as process stabilizers and as fiberglass<br>
coupling agents. The converters of TPU resins can benefit from the upgrade of edge-<br>
trim/regrind, improved melt strength of fibers and blown film, improved adhesion to<br><br>
metals and fabrics, and foamed parts/sheet with endothermic chemical foaming<br>
agents.<br>
The invention is described in greater detail in the following, non-<br>
limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Preparation of Chain Extenders I:<br>
Five different epoxy-functional chain extenders, labeled Chain<br>
Extender A-E below, were designed and prepared in a 2 gal free radical continuous<br>
polymerization reactor system according to the teachings of U.S. Patent Application<br>
No. 09/354,350 and United States Patent Application No. 09/614,402. The specific<br>
synthesis conditions and chain extender characterization parameters are given in<br>
Table 1 below. The abbreviations used below are defined as follows, STY = styrene,<br>
BMA = butyl methacrylate, MMA = methyl methacrylate, GMA = glycidyl<br>
methacrylate.	,<br><br><br>
Example 1.<br>
Virgin PET of Intrinsic Viscosity (I. V.) = 0.75 dL/g (Eastapak 7352<br>
from Eastman Chemicals) was processed through a single extrusion step with and<br>
without the use of a chain extender. The extruder employed is a 30 mm, twin-screw,<br>
with 5 temperature zones plus die, operating at Ti to Tn = 280°C, and 200 RPM. The<br>
PET was used without pre-drying, no vacuum was employed during processing, and<br>
no catalyst was employed.<br>
Three chain extenders of this invention designed and prepared<br>
according to the process described above were evaluated at different loads against a<br>
large number of leading chain extenders known in the art. In each case the given<br>
amount of chain extender was pre-mixed by dry blending to homogeneity with the<br>
PET pellets before the mix was fed at constant rate into the extruder.<br>
The I.V. results of the final compounds are given in Table 2 below.<br>
The PET undergoes a marked molecular weight degradation during the prescribed<br><br>
processing step starting from an I.V. of 0.750 dL/g before processing and decreasing<br>
to 0.543 dL/g after extrusion.<br>
In all cases the PET employed was Virgin Eastapak 7352 of I.V. = 0.75<br>
dL/g from Eastman.<br><br>
The abbreviations in Table 2 and other tables below are defined as<br>
follows: EPON™ 100IF = Solid bis-phenol A glycidyl ether epoxy resin.<br>
CYRACURE™ UVR6128 = a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin. STABAXOL™ KE7426 =<br><br>
polymeric carbodiimide. STABAXOL™ P200 =a liquid carbodiimide. ERL-4221 =<br>
a cycloaliphatic epoxy resin. IRGAFOS™ 168 = (2,4-di-tert-butyl phenyl) phosphite.<br>
From these results it is absolutely clear that no noticeable chain<br>
extension was achieved with any of the current art products tested under the<br>
prescribed conditions. In contrast, all three tested chain extenders of this invention<br>
caused a substantial increase in the final I.V. of the material, increasing it to values<br>
from lower to higher than the value of the starting virgin material even at chain<br>
extender loads'as low as 2 % w/w. In each case the product was substantially gel-<br>
free.<br>
Example 2.<br>
Virgin PET of Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.) = 0.75 dL/g (EASTAPAK™<br>
7352 from Eastman Chemicals) was processed through a single extrusion step with<br>
and without the use of chain extender. The different zone and die temperatures and<br>
extruder RPM's were adjusted to maximize the I.V. of the product and are shown in<br>
Table 3 below.<br>
In this case the PET was pre-dried from an initial moisture value of<br>
0.0947 % to a final value lower than the detection limit of the equipment. No vacuum<br>
was employed during processing, and no catalyst was employed.<br>
Three chain extenders of this invention were evaluated at 2 % w/w<br>
against the current art chain extender showing best performance in example 1. In<br>
each case the given amount of chain extender was pre-mixed by dry-blending to<br>
homogeneity with the PET pellets before the mix was fed at constant rate into the<br>
extruder.<br>
The Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.) results of the final compounds are given<br>
in Table 3 below. Notice the marked molecular weight degradation in the pre-dried<br>
PET control during the prescribed processing step, starting from an I.V. of 0.750 dL/g<br>
before processing and decreasing to 0.592 dL/g after extrusion.<br><br><br>
From these results it is clear that very limited chain extension was<br>
achieved with the current art chain extender tested under the prescribed conditions. In<br>
contrast, all three tested chain extenders of this invention caused a substantial increase<br>
in the final I.V. of the material, increasing it to values from lower to similar to higher<br>
than the value of the starting virgin material even at chain extender loads as low as 2<br>
% w/w. No gel was observed in any of the products.<br>
Example 3.<br>
Virgin PET of Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.) = 0.83 dL/g (MELINAR™<br>
Laser C B95A, DuPont Chemical Company) was processed using a Brabender Plasti-<br>
Corder. The PET was processed for 10 minutes at temperatures of 260°C and 280°C<br>
and at a constant speed of 50 rpm. The PET was used without pre-drying, catalyst, or<br>
vacuum during processing.<br>
Three chain extenders of this invention (B, D, and E) designed and<br>
prepared according to the process described above were evaluated at two temperatures<br>
(260°C and 280°C) and two levels (0.5 and 2.0 % as w/w in mix). In each case the<br><br>
given amount of chain extender was pre-mixed to homogeneity with the PET using a<br>
Strand Mixer before the blend was fed into the mixing chamber. Examples of torque<br>
vs. time traces are shown in Figure 1. Values of interest are maximum torque<br>
following melting (Max. Torque, Inch Pounds - IP), time to maximum torque, and<br>
torque at three (Torque - 1), five (Torque - 2), and seven minutes (Final Torque). In<br>
this set of experiments torque is directly related to the melt viscosity, which is related<br>
to its molecular weight. That is, greater torque is required to stir high molecular<br>
weight PET materials.<br>
The maximum torque following melting (Max. Torque, Inch Pounds -<br>
IP), time to maximum torque, and torque at three (Torque - 1), five (Torque - 2), and<br>
seven minutes (Final Torque) are recorded in Table 4 below for the modified and<br>
unmodified PET samples at the temperatures and levels discussed above. From these<br>
results it is clear that all three of the tested chain extenders of this invention caused<br>
significant increases in the torque required to mix the PET samples reflecting an<br>
increase in the polymer molecular weight. The maximum torque increased with the<br>
level of modification and reaction temperature. The torque at three, five, and seven<br>
minutes increased with the level of modification and decreased with temperature. No<br>
gel was observed in any of the products.<br>
In all cases the PET employed was Virgin MELINAR™ Laser C B95<br>
2 of I.V. = 0.83 dL/g from DuPont.<br><br><br><br>
Example 4.<br>
Virgin PET of Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.) = 0.83 dL/g (MELINAR™<br>
Laser C B95A, DuPont Chemical Company) was processed using a Brabender Plasti-<br>
Corder which consisted of a 100-mI mixing chamber. The PET was processed for 10<br>
minutes at 280°C and at a constant speed of 50 rpm. The PET was used without pre-<br>
drying, catalyst, or vacuum during processing.<br>
One chain extender of this invention (B), designed and prepared<br>
according to the process described above, that showed the best performance in<br>
example 3 was evaluated against two current art chain extenders at 280°C and at 2%<br>
w/w load. In each case the given amount of chain extender was pre-mixed to<br>
homogeneity with the PET using a Strand Mixer before the blend was fed into the<br>
mixing chamber. Examples of torque vs. time traces are shown in Figure 2. Values<br>
of interest are maximum torque following melting (Max. Torque, Inch Pounds - IP),<br>
time to maximum torque, and torque at three (Torque - 1), five (Torque - 2), and<br>
seven minutes {Final Torque). In this set of experiments torque is directly related to<br>
the blend viscosity, which is related to polymer molecular weight. That is, greater<br>
torque is required to mix high molecular weight PET materials.<br>
The maximum torque following melting (Max. Torque, Inch Pounds -<br>
IP), time to maximum torque, and torque at three (Torque - 1), five (Torque - 2), and<br>
seven minutes (Final Torque) are recorded in Table 5 below for the modified and<br>
unmodified PET samples at the conditions described above. From these results it is<br>
clear that no noticeable chain extension occurred with the current art chain extenders<br>
during typical processing times of less than five minutes. On the other hand, chain<br>
extender B of this invention caused a significant increase in the torque required to mix<br>
the chain extended PET.<br><br><br>
In all cases the PET employed was Virgin MELINAR™ Laser C B95<br>
2 of I.V. = 0.83 dL/g supplied by DuPont.<br>
Example 5.<br>
The twin-screw extruder described in Examples 1 and 2 was used to<br>
process polycarbonate (MAKROLON™ 2508 from Bayer) at 300°C, with and<br>
without chain extender B of this invention. The polycarbonate and chain extender B<br>
were dry blended to homogeneity and then fed to the extruder. Three different<br>
concentrations of chain-extender were employed. No pre-drying, vacuum or catalyst<br>
was employed in any example. The melt-flow index (MFI) of the processed<br>
polycarbonate was measured in a plastiometer at 300°C per 1.2 Kg. Comparative<br>
results are given in Table 6. The increase in MFI of the processed polycarbonate in<br>
comparison with that of the un-processed control was caused by molecular weight<br>
degradation. This MFI increase is overcome by use of 0.5 % w/w of chain extender<br>
B. Higher levels of chain extender are more effective in increasing molecular weight<br>
as judged from decrease in MFI.<br><br><br>
Example 6.<br>
The twin-screw extruder described in Examples 1 and 2 was used to<br>
process four different grades of PET by dry-blending with chain extender B of this<br>
invention at loadings of 1 and 2 % by weight. No pre-drying, vacuum or catalyst was<br>
employed. The melt viscosity of resulting blends was compared with those of the<br>
controls containing no chain extender with a capillary viscometer at 280°C and two<br>
different shear rates. Results given in Table 7 show significant increase in melt<br>
viscosity at both levels of chain extender of this invention. The melt viscosity values<br>
at 1000 s"1 show an enhanced shear thinning for the chain extended materials of this<br>
invention.<br><br>
Preparation of Chain Extenders II:<br>
Two different epoxy-functional chain extenders, labeled Chain<br>
Extender F and G below, were designed and prepared in a 2 gal free radical<br>
continuous polymerization reactor system operated in continuous recycle mode<br>
according to the teachings of U.S. Patent Application No. 09/354,350. The specific<br>
synthesis conditions and chain extender characterization parameters are given in<br>
Table 8 below. The abbreviations used below are defined as follows: STY = styrene,<br><br>
BMA = butyl methacrylate, MMA = methyl methacrylate, GMA = glycidyl<br>
methacrylate.<br><br>
Example 7. Controlled Chain Extension of Bottle Grade Processed PET<br>
for Specific Enhanced Applications<br>
Compositions comprising 98 to 99.7 parts of virgin PET of low Intrinsic Viscosity<br>
(I.V.) = 0.8 dL/g (Eastapak 9921 W from Eastman Chemicals) was dry-blended and<br>
then processed through a single extrusion step with 0.3 to 2.0 parts of chain extender<br>
G of this invention. The extruder employed was a Maris-30, co-rotating 30 mm twin-<br>
screw operating at T = 290°C and 200 RPM. No vacuum was employed during<br>
processing, and no catalyst was employed.<br>
Specific formulations were designed to enhance the I.V. of the final<br>
product to the typical levels necessary for use in more demanding applications, thus<br><br>
allowing this initially lower degraded I.V. feedstock to be used in such applications<br>
otherwise not accessible due to their low properties.<br>
The Intrinsic Viscosity (I.V.) results of the final compounds were<br>
measured using a method adapted from ASTM D 4603-86, employing a Ubbelholde<br>
viscometer series 1, and 60/40 Phenol/1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane % (w/w) as solvent.<br>
Results are given in Table 9 below. Large increases in I.V. are observed allowing the<br>
application of the corresponding chain extended grades in applications previously<br>
only reached with much higher initial I.V. PET resins.<br><br><br>
From these results it can be seen that typical low I.V. grades of PET<br>
normally used in less demanding fiber applications when formulated with about 0.3 %<br>
of chain extender G can be used in sheet and tape, when formulated with about 0.5 %<br>
of chain extender G can be used in non-food bottles, when formulated with about 1.0<br>
% of chain extender G can be used in general purpose packaging strapping, and in<br>
food grade bottles including CSD bottles, and when formulated with about 1.5 % of<br>
chain extender G can be used in high-tensile strapping applications.<br>
Preparation of Chain Extender Pre-Dilutions I:<br>
To facilitate mixing of the chain extenders of this invention in<br>
processing steps where traditionally insufficient mixing is achieved, such as injection<br>
molding and some single screw extrusion operations, several pre-dilutions (PD) were<br>
made by mixing 20 to 60 parts of chain extender G with 80 to 40 parts of different<br>
suitable diluents. The description of these pre-dilutions is given below in Table 10.<br><br>
Example 8. Applications in Injection-Molding<br>
Compositions comprising 98 to 99.5 parts of high I.V. virgin PET (Eastapak EN-<br>
001 I.V. = 0.75 from Eastman Chemicals) which were either pre-dried or undried<br>
were mixed with 0.5 to 2 parts of several pre-dilutions containing varying amounts of<br>
chain extender G of this invention, and then processed through a single injection<br>
molding step. Injection molding was carried out in a Boy 50 injection molding<br>
machine with a clamping force of 50 metric tons, fitted with a 28-mm injection screw<br>
operating at T = 280°C. No vacuum was employed during processing, and no catalyst<br>
was employed.<br><br>
Comparative results of the mechanical properties of the moldings thus<br>
obtained are given below in Table 11.<br><br>
Compositions comprising 97 to 99 parts of low I.V. virgin PET (Eastapak EN-058<br>
I.V. = 0.58 from Eastman Chemicals) which were either pre-dried, or partially pre-<br>
dried were mixed with 1 to 3 parts of several pre-dilutions containing varying<br>
amounts of chain extender G of this invention, and then processed through a single<br>
injection molding step. Injection molding was carried out at same conditions as in<br>
Example 8.<br>
Comparative results of the mechanical properties of the moldings thus<br>
obtained are given below in Table 12.<br><br><br>
Example 10. Applications in Injection-Molding of PC<br>
Compositions comprising 98.8 to 99.4 parts of virgin Polycarbonate<br>
(Lexan 141 from GE Plastics) were pre-dried to less than 0.02 % moisture, then<br>
mixed with 0.6 to 1.2 parts of Pre-dilutions R and S containing 50 % of chain<br>
extender G of this invention, and then processed through a single injection molding<br>
step. Injection molding was carried out in a Boy 50 injection molding machine with a<br>
clamping force of 50 metric tons, fitted with a 28-mm injection screw operating at T =<br>
300°C. No vacuum was employed during processing, and no catalyst was employed.<br>
Comparative results of the mechanical properties of the moldings thus<br>
obtained are given below in Table 13.<br><br><br>
Example 11. Applications in Injection-Blow Molding of PET Bottles<br>
from Low I.V. Feedstock<br>
This example shows that with the aid of the chain extenders of this<br>
invention, PET resins of I.V. lower than 0.75 can be successfully injection molded<br>
into acceptable pre-forms and then blow molded into large bottles bearing similar<br>
properties to those made from the higher I.V. resins (I.V. &gt; 0.8) usually needed for<br>
such applications. To show this application, injection-blow molding compositions<br>
comprising 99.5 parts of virgin PET of I.V. = 0.73 (K3301 from Kosa) were pre-dried<br>
to less man 0.02 % moisture, mixed with 0.5 parts of chain extender G of this<br>
invention, and with 0.5 parts of Master Batch S (containing 50 % of chain extender<br>
G), and then processed through a single injection molding step into standard 2 liter<br>
bottle pre-forms (PRE-0246C). Formulations and injection molding conditions are<br>
given below in Table 14. High I.V. = 0.84 PET resin (61802 from Wellman) was<br>
used as a control for comparison.<br><br><br>
The above performs were free-blown (FB) at 100°C and 60 psi of<br>
pressure. The comparative results of the free-blown bottles thus obtained are shown<br>
below in Table 15.<br><br><br>
Example 12. Applications in Sheet Extrusion from Virgin, Recycled, or<br>
Reprocessed Low I.V. Feedstock<br>
In order to show the ability of the chain extenders of this invention to<br>
enhance the performance of severely degraded polycondensate resins, virgin	*<br>
copolyester resin with I.V. = 0.8 (Eastar EN001 from Eastman Chemicals) was first<br>
extruded without drying in a 27 mm co-rotating twin-screw extruder with L/D = 40<br>
(Leistritz Micro 27). The resulting material (CoPE-lst Pass) with I.V. = 0.715 was<br>
pelletized and used to make sheet compositions comprising 97 to 99.5 parts of CoPE-<br>
1st Pass which was then pre-dried to less than 0.01 % moisture and then mixed with<br>
0.5 to 3 parts of pre-dilutions X, Y and Z each containing 20 % of chain extender G of<br>
this invention. Compositions were then processed in the same 27 mm extruder fitted<br>
with a 7 inch flat sheet die operated with a temperature profile at the barrel zones<br>
between 225°C at the feed and 300°C at the last zone, and 235°C at the die, under 25<br>
mmHg vacuum. The 1st Pass CoPE resin was also processed into sheet under the<br>
same conditions and used as a control. Intrinsic viscosity and mechanical properties<br>
were measured as described above, melt viscosity was measured in a Rheometrics<br>
Scientific SC-5000 operated in shear rate sweep mode widi 40 mm parallel plate<br>
configuration at 0.5 mm gap.<br>
The resulting sheet products show enhanced I.V. along with higher<br>
rheological and mechanical properties. The sheet products also show enhanced<br>
surface appearance, much less tendency to block and lower coefficients of friction<br><br>
with itself. The latter is extremely important in sheet applications where sheets are<br>
rolled or stacked and low blocking is needed.<br>
Comparative results of the initial and final I.V. are given in Table 16.<br>
Mechanical, rheological, and surface properties of the extruded sheets thus obtained<br>
are given below in Table 17.<br><br><br><br>

Low I.V. Feedstock<br>
In order to show the ability of the chain extenders of this invention to<br>
»<br>
enhance performance of severely degraded reclaimed or reprocessed polycondensate<br>
resins, 98 parts of lowest grade reclaimed PET (R-PET) resin with I.V. = 0.40 were<br>
dried to less than 0.02 % moisture and then mixed with 2 parts of chain extender G of<br>
this invention. This composition was then processed in a WP 30 mm co-rotating twin<br>
screw extruder (L/D = 36) operating at 280°C and 150 RPM. No vacuum or catalyst<br>
were used. The melt viscosity of the product at different shear rates was measured<br>
against that of the unmodified control in a Kayeness Galaxy LCR6000 capillary<br>
rheometer. Comparative results are given in Table 18. Virgin PET resin of I.V. =<br>
0.73 (3302 from Kosa) from Example 2 has been added as a reference.<br><br><br>

as per manufacturers recommendations and then mixed with 0.5 to 1.5 parts of chain<br>
extender G of this invention. These compositions were then processed in the same<br>

(Valox 325 from GE Plastics) were pre-dried to less than 0.05 % moisture, and then<br><br>
parts of chain extender F of this invention, and compounded in a Leistritz 40-mm co-<br>
rotating twin screw extruder operating at T = 250°C and 250 RPM. Injection molding<br>
was carried out in a Boy 50 injection molding machine with a clamping force of 50<br>
metric tons, fitted with a 28-mm injection screw operating at T = 275°C. No vacuum<br>
was employed during processing, and no catalyst was employed.<br>
Comparative results against the unmodified polyester of the<br>
rheological, mechanical and thermal properties of the moldings thus obtained are<br>
given below in Table 26.<br><br>
Example 22. Applications in Injection-Molding of Polyamides<br>
Compositions comprising 98.8 to 99.3 parts of pre-dried polyamide 6<br>
were mixed with 0.5 and 1 parts of Pre-dilution S containing 50 % of chain extender<br>
G of this invention, and with 0 to 0.2 parts of antioxidant (HD98 from Eastman<br>
Chemical). These compositions were then compounded in a Brabender Plasticorder<br>
operating at T = 230°C and 50 RPM for a residence time RT = 5 minutes.<br><br>
Compounds thus obtained were granulated and then injection molded in a Daca<br>
Microinjector operating at T = 230°C. No vacuum was employed during processing,<br>
and no catalyst was employed.<br>
Comparative results against the unmodified polyamide of the<br>
Theological, and mechanical properties of the moldings thus obtained are given below<br>
in Table 27, all methods employed have been described above.<br><br>
Example 23. Applications in Fiber Enhancement<br>
Compositions comprising 99.84 to 99.92 parts of pre-dried PET were<br>
mixed with 0.08 to 0.16 parts of pre-dilution Q containing 60 % of chain extender G<br>
of this invention. These compositions were then processed in a suitable reactor under<br>
conditions of temperature and mixing as described above and spun into fibers of<br>
different caliper through a die and spinneret. Fibers thus obtained were characterized<br>
by Dynamic Mechanical Analyzer (Perkin Elmer Model 2980 DMA).<br><br>
Comparative results against the unmodified polyester of the<br>
dynamical-mechanical properties of the fibers thus obtained are given below in Table<br>
28 all methods employed have been described above.<br><br>
Example 24. Applications in Increasing Regrind or Recycle Content in<br>
Formulations<br>
Compositions comprising 0,10 or 50 parts of regrind of extruded PET<br>
sheet were mixed with 100 to 50 parts virgin PET and various amounts of suitable<br>
pre-dilution containing various amount of a chain extender of this invention. These<br>
compositions were then processed into transparent sheet using the same equipment<br>
and conditions as in Example 12.<br>
Comparative results show that without the chain extender of this<br>
invention the maximum regrind possible is about 10 % before loosing required<br>
properties whereas the use of 2 % of the chain extender G allowed for 50 % regrind to<br>
be processed into high quality sheet.<br>
