POLYMERIZABLE      COPOLYMERS      FOR ALIGNMENT LAYERS;<br>
ROLIC AG, A CORPORATION ORGANIZED AND EXISTING UNDER THE LAWS OF SWITZERLAND, WHOSE ADDRESS IS CHAMERSTRASSE 50, 6301 ZUG, SWITZERLAND.<br>
THE        FOLLOWING        SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY        DESCRIBES	THE<br>
INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br>
1<br><br>
The present invention relates to a composition comprising (a) at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer to which a photochemically isomerizable or dimerizable molecule is covalently bonded, (b) one polymer having covalently bonded sensitizers in side chains, and c) optionally other ethylenically unsaturated monomers; to an electrooptical device comprising, on a (flat) substrate material, an optionally photocrosslinked layer of said composition; to an electrooptical device comprising, on a (flat) substrate material, a photocrosslinked layer of said composition and, on said photocrosslinked layer, a liquid-crystalline layer; and to the use of the copolymers as an alignment layer for liquid crystals.<br>
In recent times, alignment layers for liquid crystals have played a considerable role in the production of electrooptical elements, for example liquid-crystal displays. These alignment layers can also, in combination with liquid-crystal polymers, be used for the production of optical compensation films, for example, for optical delay filters, cholesteric filters, antireflection filters and for safety elements, among other uses. Such alignment layers are polymers which are applied to a substrate and, on irradiation with (polarized) light of suitable wavelength and energy density, are crosslinked over the whole surface or selectively.<br>
This technology is known and is described, for example, for different photoactive polymers in EP-A-0 763 552, US-A-5 539 074, WO 96/10049, WO 01/53384 and EP-A-0 860 455. For the photoinduced crosslinking of the photoactive polymers, a relatively high energy density is required. To increase the photosensitivity, it is possible to add to the polymers molecular sensitizers which absorb in the wavelength range of the irradiation light and transfer energy to the photoactive, isomerizable or dimerizable groups, the latter groups only being excited to a slight extent, if at all, in the selected wavelength range. In this way, the required energy density can be reduced, which is not yet, however, regarded as being sufficiently practicable.<br>
It has now been found that, surprisingly, the photosensitivity is considerably increased, the energy density required is considerably reduced and the information of the direction of the polarized irradiation light is retained in the course of energy transfer when copolymers composed of monomers having covalently bonded isomerizable or dimerizable groups and<br>
2<br><br>
composed of monomers having covalently bonded sensitizers are used to produce<br>
alignment layers.<br>
First, the invention provides a composition comprising<br>
a)	at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer to which a photochemically isomerizable or dimerizable molecule is covalently bonded,<br>
b)	at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer to which a sensitizer is covalently bonded, and<br>
c)	optionally other ethylenically unsaturated comonomers.<br>
The monomers a) are preferably selected from the group of acrylates, methacrylates, acryi-amides and methacrylamides, to which a photochemically isomerizable or dimerizable molecule is covalently bonded directly or via a bridging group in the ester or amide group.<br>
The inventive copolymers are random copolymers.<br>
Photochemically isomerizable and dimerizable molecules are, for example, those molecules which undergo a cis/trans isomerization or a [2+2]-cycloaddition under the influence of radiation and lead to crosslinking of the polymer.<br>
The photoisomerizable group may be, for example, an azobenzene group.<br>
The photodimerizable group may be, for example, an ethylenically unsaturated group which is preferably bonded to a carbocyclic or heterocyclic aromatic ring. Particular preference is given to an alkoxycarbonyl group being bonded to the ethylenically unsaturated group, for example C1-C12-alkoxy-, preferably C1 C8-alkoxy-, and more preferably C1-C4-alkoxycarbonyl. Examples of alkoxy are methoxy, ethoxy, and the isomers of propoxy, butoxy, pentyloxy, hexyloxy, heptyloxy, octyloxy, nonyloxy, decyloxy, undecyloxy and dodecyloxy. Especially preferably, alkoxy is ethoxy and particularly methoxy. In a further preferred embodiment, the ethylenically unsaturated group is bonded to the polymer backbone via a C(O) group and bridging group bonded thereto, and an optionally substituted aryl or heteroaryl group is bonded to the second carbon atom of the ethylenically unsaturated group. The photodimerizable groups may be, for example, derivatives of cinnamate, chatcone or coumarin.<br>
The photopolymerizable group may correspond, for example, to the formulae A and B<br>

Some of the monomers b) are known or they can be prepared by processes known per se for introducing functionalized side chains. 7-Acryloxycoumarin is described, for example, by G. A. Delzenne et al. in Ind. Chim. Beige (1967), 32, pages 373-376. Other polymerizable sensitizers such as pyrenes, anthracenes and benzophenones are described by J. K. Oh et al. in J. of Pol. Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 10, pages 3001 to 3011 (2002). Functionalized carbonylbiscoumarins are described by D. P. Specht et a!, in Tetrahedron, Vol. 38, No. 9,1203-1211 (1982) or by D. Creed et al. in Journal of Polymer Science: Part A Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 39,134-144 (2001).<br>
The inventive composition may additionally comprise copolymerizable, ethylenically unsaturated monomers (c). They may be unsubstituted or substituted olefins, for example ethene, propene, butene, pentene, styrene, vinyl chloride, vinylidene chloride, acrylonitrtle, (meth)acrylonitrile, (meth)acrylamide, N-alkylated or N-hydroxyalkylated (methjacrylamides, alkyl (meth)acrylates and hydroxyalkyl (meth)acrylates having 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the ester group, vinyl and ailyl esters and vinyl and allyl ethers having 1 to 20 carbon atoms in the ester or ether groups. Also suitable are alkyl (meth)acrylates, vinyl and allyl ethers of polyoxaalkytene diols, for example polyoxaethylene diols or polyoxa-1,2-propyiene diols having from 2 to 200 oxaethylene units and/or 1,2-oxapropylene units. Such comonomers may be used to obtain desired physical and mechanical properties.<br>
The inventive copolymers may also comprise residues of monomers having at least two ethylenically unsaturated groups. Such crosslinking agents may be used to attain desired physical and mechanical properties. Crosslinking agents are known in a wide range. Some examples are butadiene, isoprene, divinylbenzene and acrylic or methacrylic esters of polyols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, butylene glycol, hexanediol,<br>
13<br><br>
Methylene glycol, 1,2,3-propanetriol, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol and dihydroxy- or dihydroxymethylcyclohexane.<br>
• "Die amount of the comonomers may, based on the weight of the composition, be, for example, from 20 to 99% by weight, preferably from 50 to 95% by weight and more preferably from 70 to 95% by weight, of comonomer (a), and from 80 to 1% by weight, preferably from 50 to 1% by weight and more preferably from 30 to 1% by weight, of comonomer (b). When a comonomer (c) is present, it may replace from 50 to 1% by weight, preferably from 40 to 5% by weight and more preferably from 30 to 5% by weight, of comonomer (a). The percentages by weight add up to 100% by weight. Up to 5% by weight of crosslinkers may be present, based on the composition.<br>
The inventive composition may additionally comprise inert solvents.<br>
Suitable solvents are, for example, aliphatic, cycloaliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons (pentane, hexane, petroleum ether, cyclohexane, methyjcydohexane, benzene, toluene, xylene), aliphatic halohydrocarbons (methylene chloride, chloroform, di- and tetrachloroethane), nitriles (acetonitrile, propionitrile, benzonitrile), ethers (diethyl ether, dibutyl ether, t-butyl methyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, ethylene glycol diethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether or diethylene glycol monoethyl ether), ketones (acetone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone), carboxylic esters and lactones (ethyl acetate or methyl acetate, valerolactone), N-substituted lactams (N-methylpyrrofidone), carboxamides (dimethylacetamide, dimethylformamide), acyclic ureas (dimethylimidazoline), and sulphoxides and sulphones (dimethyl sulphoxide, dimethyl sulphone, tetramethylene sulphoxide, tetramethylene sulphone) and alcohols (methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether). Solvents may be used alone or in a mixture of at least two solvents.<br>
The concentration of the copotymers or comonomers in the solutions depends substantially upon the desired layer thickness which is to be achieved on a substrate, and also upon the viscosity of the solutions. The amount of the comonomers may be, for example, from 0.1 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 15% by weight and more preferably from 0.5 to 10% by weight.<br>
The inventive compositions may additionally comprise polymerization initiators. Among the polymerization initiators, preference is given to free-radical initiators which generate free<br>
14<br><br>
radicals thermally and/or by irradiation. Especially suitable for ethylenically unsaturated monomers are azo compounds, for example 2,2,-azobisisobutyronitrile, 2,2'-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile), 2]2'-azobis(214-dimethylvaleronitrile) or macroinitiators such as macroazo initiators which contain, for example, polyethylene glycol units. Polymerization initiators are generally used in amounts of from 0.1 to 10% by weight, based on the entirety of the monomers.<br>
The polymerizable compositions are coating compositions and are outstandingly suitable for producing alignment layers by polymerization of a thin layer of said composition on a substrate.<br>
The invention further provides the use of the inventive composition for producing alignment layers on a substrate material.<br>
The invention further provides a composite material composed of a substrate and a thin layer of a polymerizable composition or of a copolymer of this composition, comprising<br>
a)	at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer to which a photochemically iso-merizable or dimerizable molecule is covalently bonded,<br>
b)	at least one ethylenically unsaturated monomer to which a sensitizer is covalently bonded, and<br>
c)	optionally other ethylenically unsaturated comonomers.<br>
For components a), b) and c), the embodiments and preferences specified above apply.<br>
The layer thickness of the composition or of the copolymer on the support may be, for example, from 0.01 to 500 urn, preferably from 0.05 to 200 um, more preferably from 0.05 to 100 jim and especially preferably from 0.05 to 50 um. In the case of optical applications, the thicknesses of orientation layers are frequently in the range from 10 to 100 nm.<br>
Substrate materials are known and their form may differ depending on the application. Flat and even substrates are preferred. Examples of substrate materials are alumina, titania, silicon dioxide (glass or quartz) or mixed oxides, for example indium tin oxide (ITO), and also polymers and organic glasses, for example polyethylene, polypropylene, polyesters such as polyethylene terephthalate, polycarbonates, polyurethanes, polyamides, poly(meth)acrylates and triacetylcellulose. In the case of inventive applications for optical devices, it is in<br>
15<br><br>
particular polymers, glass or optionally a substrate (for example glass plates coated with ITO) coated with an electrically conductive material (which serves as an electrode) that are at the forefront as substrate materials.<br>
The coated substrates may be produced by coating processes known per se, for example painting, dipping, rolling, knife-coating and casting. To produce thin layers, it has been found that spin-coating is particularly useful for producing thin layers, since uniform layer thicknesses can be obtained. After the coating, the coated material is dried, for example by evaporating the solvent by means of heating, applying a vacuum or both measures. Compositions are polymerized after the coating by the action of actinic radiation. The thus obtained material having a layer of the inventive copolymer is stable and can be brought onto the market as such for further processing.<br>
The inventive coated material is particularly suitable for aligning liquid crystals in a layer which is applied to the copolymer. To this end, the copolymer layer is initially irradiated with linear-polarized light and the photoactive group is isomerized or dimerized. Suitable radiation sources are particularly U V sources, for example high-pressure mercury lamps, xenon lamps or UV laser using a polarizer. When structures are to be formed, irradiation is appropriately effected through a mask. The illumination times are considerably reduced compared to mixtures of comonomers a) and sensitizers, for example down to half or less, depending on the content of comonomer b). Liquid-crystalline compounds are then applied to the thus prepared layers, said compounds being molecular compounds, polymers or polymerizable monomers or oligomers.<br>
Such liquid-crystalline compounds are known and are described in US 55993617, US 5567349, US 5650534 and WO 99/64924 (see structures C and D.). Commercial liquid-crystal formulations such as OPALVA™ 2130 are obtainable from Vantico AG (Basle). Structures C and D:<br>
16<br><br><br>
where X is hydrogen; fluorine, chlorine, bromine; or lower alkyl such as methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl, and n is an integer from 3 to 12.<br>
Preference is given to using polymerizable liquid-crystalline monomers whose alignment on the alignment layers is fixed (frozen-in) by the polymerization. To produce the liquid-crystal layers, the same techniques may be applied as for the coating with an alignment layer. The thicknesses of the liquid-crystal layer are, for example, in the range from 10 nm to 10 jim, preferably from 100 nm to 5 fim, especially preferably from 500 nm to 3 jim.<br>
The invention further provides a composition comprising, on a (flat) substrate material, a photocrosslinked layer of the inventive composition and, on said photocrosslinked layer, a liquid-crystalline layer, preferably a polymeric liquid-crystalline layer.<br>
The composite material produced in accordance with the invention features, owing to a high photosensitivity of the copolymers, excellent and uniform contrast performance even with short illumination times.<br>
The examples which follow illustrate the invention in detail. The 4'-dimethylamino-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzophenone used in Example A1 is prepared in a similar manner to the publication of J. K. Oh et al. in J. of Pol. Science, Part A: Polymer Chemistry, Vol. 10, pages 3001 to 3011(2002).<br>

The solution is spin-coated in a spin-coating apparatus onto an ITO-coated glass plate at 60 seconds and 3000 rpm (acceleration = 500 rps), so that a homogeneous layer of 50 nm forms. Afterwards, the layer is dried at 180° C for 10 min and irradiated stripwise with different energy doses of 5/10/20/40/80/160/200/400/800/1600/3200 mJ/cm2 with linear-polarized light at a wavelength of 365 nm (Band Pass Filter BPF 365 nm). In this way, the amount of energy is determined at which alignment of the applied liquid-crystalline layer is observed for the first time. The results are reported in Table 1 of Example D1.<br>
Examples C2-C14:<br>
The procedure of Example C1 is repeated, but copolymers of Examples B2 to B14 are used.<br>
Comparative examples:<br>
The procedure of Example C1 is repeated, but a homopolymer of monomer A is used which contains 33% by weight of Michler's ketone, 7% by weight or 22% by weight of 3-benzoyl-7-(5-methacroyloxy-n-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyloxy)coumarin as a sensitizer (Comparisons 1,2 and 3).<br>
D) Production of substrates with liquid crystal and copolymer layer<br>
Example D1:<br>
A15% by weight solution of a commercial photocrosslinkable liquid crystal formulation in cyclopentanone is used (OPALVATM 2130, Vantico AG) and spin-coated using a spin-coating apparatus onto the copolymer layer of the coated glass plate of Example C1 (120 seconds at 1000 rpm, acceleration 500 rps), so that a homogeneous layer having a thickness of 700-800 nm is formed. The applied layer is aligned by heating to 50*C (1 minute) and 40°C (1 minute). Afterwards, the aligned layer is crosslinked by irradiating with<br>
36<br><br>
800 mJ/cm2 of UV light in the 280-400 nm region under nitrogen.<br>
Examples D2-DU;<br>
The procedure of Example D1 is repeated and coated glass plates of Examples C2 to C14 are used,<br>
Comparative examples:<br>
The procedure of Example 01 is repeated and coated glass plates of Comparative Examples 1 to 3 are used.<br>

E) Production of substrates having a copolymer layer<br>
Example E1:<br>
A solution is prepared of 2% by weight of the copolymer of Example B1 in 7 ml of cyclo-pentanone. The solution is spin-coated in a spin-coating apparatus onto an ITO-coated glass plate at 60 seconds and 3000 rpm (acceleration = 500 rps), so that a homogeneous layer of 50 nm forms. Afterwards, the layer is dried at 180°C for 10 min and irradiated stripwise with different energy doses of 5/10/20/30/80/40/50 mJ/cm2 with linear-polarized light at a wavelength of from 280 to 400 nm (Short Cut Filter SCF 280 nm - mercury lamp).<br>
Tilt angles are determined using a microscope which is additionally equipped with a Berek compensator which enables measurements of birefringences. A number of tilt domains Bmtdomam in the illuminated strips is determined visually using the microscope. Tilt domains refer to regions of the coating having different tilt angles. In cross-polarized light, the boundaries between these zones can be recognized by sharply delimited differences in contrast. The presence of tilt domains shows that the alignment is not yet complete and is thus a measure of the photospeed of the alignment layer. The results are reported in Table 2 of Example F1.<br>
Examples E2-E14:<br>
The procedure of Example E1 is repeated, but copolymers of Examples B2 to B14 are used.<br>
Comparative example:<br>
The procedure of Example E1 is repeated, but a homopolymer of monomer A is used which contains 33% by weight of Michler*s ketone, 7% by weight or 22% by weight of 3-benzoyl-7-(5-methacroyloxy-n-(2-hydroxyethoxy)ethyloxy)coumarin as a sensitizer (Comparisons 1.2 and 3).<br>
