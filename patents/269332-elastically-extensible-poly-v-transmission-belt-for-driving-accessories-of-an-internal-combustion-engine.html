				<td>"ELASTICALLY EXTENSIBLE POLY-V TRANSMISSION BELT FOR DRIVING ACCESSORIES OF AN ZNTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE"<br>
TECHNICAL  FIELD<br>
The      present      invention       concerns      a       transmission      belt, particularly  for  driving   accessories  of   an  internal  combustion engine,   of the type  with multiple races  or poly-V type.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In order to facilitate fitting or. the engine, so-called "elastic" poly-V fc&gt;elts have recently been introduced on the automobile market.<br>
"Elastic" or "elastically extensible" belts, that is having resistant inserts or cords with a relatively low tensile modulus of elasticity and able to allow an elastic elongation of the belt during assembly, have been known for decades in the field of industrial applications, for example in electric household appliances, in which the loads transmitted and the requirements of duration are not as severe as in the automobile field; these belts are usually fitted manually since their tensile modulus of elasticity is very low and they can be stretched elastically with acceptable stresses.<br>
For automobile applications, in which there is the similar problem of fitting the belt onto the transmission pulleys without varying the centre distance between the pulleys but rather by extending the belt, elastic belts have only recently been introduced on the market. In fact, only materials of the latest generation allow acceptable compromises to be found between the need to "elongate" the belt elastically and the strict functional requirements of automobile applications.<br>
A problem connected with the known elastic belts is how to maintain over time a functionally acceptable level of tension for the transmission. The tension decay over time is normally<br><br>
related  to   the   tensile   modulus   of  elasticity  of   the   belt/     in<br>
the sense that, when the modulus is reduced there is a corresponding increase in the tension decay.<br>
In practice, this means that when the modulus of an elastic belt is reduced beyond certain limits/ the belt tends to l.ose tension rapidly while working and therefore works slack over time until its ability to transmit the load is compromised.<br>
It is known how a reduction of the modulus of a belt may be obtained by increasing the number of twists of the corrds, while the materials and all other constructive characteristics remain the same.<br>
In particular, cords are known that are made of yarn that has undergone a first twisting process to obtain plied yairns, which are then subjected to a second twisting process in the opposite direction. It is known that increasing the number; of twists per unit length of the yarns and of the plied yarns determines a reduction in the tensile modulus of elasticity of the cord.<br>
However, cords with a high tensile stress present a greater tendency to elastic decay.<br>
On the basis of the above, the need to reduce the tensile modulus of elasticity of a belt clashes with the antithetic need of ensuring that tension losses are acceptable for the application.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The aim of the present invention is to provide a transmission belt  of the  type  with multiple  races  or poly-V type, particularly for driving accessories of an internal combustion engine, which allows the above problem to be solved, and tlhat is which presents a low modulus, so that it can be easily<br><br>
fitted, and at the same time an acceptable tension decay over time.<br>
The  above   aim is   achieved by a belt  according to  claim 1.<br>

invention;<br>

belt in figure 1;<br>

construction; and<br>
figure 5 is a diagram illustrating a test appliance.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to figure 1, the number 1 indicates as a whole a belt transmission for driving a plurality of accessories of an internal combustion engine 2.<br>
The transmission comprises a first drive pulley.3 keyed onto a crankshaft 4 of the engine 2, a second pulley 5 keyed onto a shaft 6 that drives a first accessory 7, for example an alternator, and a third pulley 8 keyed onto a shaft 9 that drives a second accessory 10, for example a compressor of an air conditioning system.<br>
The transmission 1 also comprises a belt 13 of the type with multiple races or poly-V type, which is wound onto the pulleys<br><br>
3, 5 and 8, also of the type with multiple races.<br>
With reference to figure 2, the belt 13 comprises a body 18 of elastomer material, a plurality of resistant filiform elements 19 parallel and adjacent to one another and longitudinally embedded into the body 18, and a coupling portion 20 defined by a plurality of V shaped ribs 21 parallel and adjacent to one another, extending integrally from the body 18 and in a longitudinal direction with respect to the body' itself, so as to form V shaped races 22, each enclosed between two adjacent ribs 21.<br>
The body 18 and the coupling portion 20 may be made of any elastomer material suitable for the application.<br>
The reinforcing elements 19 are composed, in a known way, of the coils of a single filiform resistant element or continuous cord 23, wound in a spiral.<br>
The cord 23 is made, in a known way, by means, of a plurality of yarns 24 twisted together (figure 4), which in turn are composed of filaments 25. The axis of the cord 23 is indicated with A.<br>
Conveniently, the filaments are polyamide, preferably 6.6. An example of material that may be used is the polyamide marketed by Poliamide High Performance GmbH (Wuppertal, Germany) under the trade name ENKA©Nylon 140HRT.<br>
According to the present invention, the cord 23 presents a construction of "double balanced twisting" type, that is in which the twists in the two twisting stages are calculated so that, in the finished cord, the filaments 25 are substantially rectilinear and parallel to one another and to the axis A of the cord. In particular, according to the present invention, the filaments form with the axis A of the cord an angle (3<br><br>
smaller than 3° and, preferably, equal to 0°.<br>
A way of obtaining this result (figure 3) is to use a construction with primary twisting/ in which a first number of yarns 24, for example two, are twisted together (for example in direction S) to form plied yarns 26, and a secondary twisting in which a second number of plied yarns 26 thus obtained, for example three, are twisted together in the opposite direction (for example Z) to form the cord 23; the number of twists per unit length in either case is calculated so that the angles al and a.2 of the spirals that are obtained with twisting are substantially equal in the two cases, and the angle 3 formed between the filaments 25 and the axis A of the cord is therefore substantially equal to 0.<br>
This calculation may be done, in an approximate way, by making the "twist multiplier" parameter remain constant in the two twisting stages:in which N is the number of twists per metre of the twisting, and LD is the count cr linear density of the plied yarn (for primary twisting) or of the cord (for secondary twisting) expressed in dtex (g/10000 m) .<br>
In particular, in the specific case the following relation must apply:where:<br>
= number of twists per metre of primary twisting (for<br>
i<br>
example in direction S);<br>
LDpy is the plied yarn linear density expressed in dtex;<br>
7/2 = number of twists per metre of secondary twisting (for<br>
example in direction Z) ;<br>
LDC is the cord linear density expressed in dtex.<br>
Using a yarn of the type mentioned above with 940 dtex, the above equation is approximately respected, for example, by a cord with construction 940 2x3 S300 Z175 (three plied yarns twisted together with 175 twists/m in direction Z, each formed of two yarns twisted together with 300 twists/m in direction S) .This in fact gives: TM^ <br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Belts made with cord of the above type (indicated below as "belt A") were subjected to comparative tests with batches of belts identical in every other aspect, but using cord of a different type, in order to check and compare their modulus of elasticity and the tension decay in use.<br>
The construction characteristics of the cords of the belts A,<br>
B, C are the following:<br>
A: 940 2X3 S300 Z175 (example according to the invention)<br>
B: 940 2x3 S150 Z125 (comparative example)<br>
C: 940 2x3 S250 Z200 (comparative example).<br>
The belts A, B and C have the following characteristics in<br>
common:<br>
yarn: ENKA®Nylon 140HRT, linear density 940 dtex;<br>
nominal length: Ln = 1000 mm at the tension of 140 N/rib (rib=<br>
number of ribs of the belt) .<br>
The characteristics of the cords of the belts in examples A, B and C are summed up in table 1 below. For each type of cord, considering the production tolerances as concerns the number of twists assumed to be equal to 7% (value considered ample and precautionary) , the values of the angle (3 were calculated both for the nominal values of the numbers of twists (columns Alt Bl, CD, and with reference to the maximum .deviations of these values in the opposite direction for Nj and A^ so as to allow for the most unfavourable combinations of tolerances: in particular, in columns A2, B2, C2 are listed the data for the case in which the number of primary twists is at the upper limit of the range of tolerance and the number of secondary twists is at the lower limit of the range of tolerance; in columns A3, B3, C3 are given the data for the case in which the number of primary twists is at the lower limit of the range of tolerance and the number of secondary twists is at the upper limit of the range of tolerance.<br>
As may be observed, the cords of the type A belt have an angle <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
3 (in absolute value) smaller than 3.3° for twisting values within the' range of tolerance of ±7° of the number of twists;<br>
the examples B and C have angles p greater in absolute value,<br>
t<br>
even allowing for the possible variations due to manufacturing tolerances.<br>
The modulus of the belts was calculated, subjecting each belt to a test using a dynamometer equipped with two fixed poly-V pulleys. The test, which had the aim of simulating the elastic behaviour of the belt during assembly, was carried out according to the following stages:<br>
a)	positioning the belt on the pulleys;<br>
b)	progressively increasing belt tension up to a value Tj<br>
corresponding to a length Le equal to 1050 mm (that is equal to<br>
5% more than the nominal installation length Ln of 1000 mm:<br>
this increase in length simulates the elongation of the belt<br>
necessary during assembly to get over the crests of the ribs<br>
and any side flanges of the pulleys) ;<br>
c)	releasing belt tension to a value r? corresponding to the<br>
nominal length of 1000 mm<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
d)	<br>
d)	Calculating modulus M with the formula:The tension decay was measured in a test appliance 30 schematically illustrated in figure 5, essentially comprising a drive pulley 31 and a driven pulley 32 having axes a, b, parallel to each other. The centre distance between the pulleys was predetermined so as to obtain, with the project data of the belts, a theoretical static tension of 120 N/rib, a tension value equal to the test installation tension/obviously, with the same centre distance between the pulleys, the actual tension of each belt after assembly was different from the nominal value, on account of the manufacturing tolerances.<br>
For each belt the test was carried out with the following<br>
sequence of stages:<br>
a)   fitting the belt on the pulleys<br>
b)	measuring the initial tension (Ti) ,<br>
c)	starting' the test in the . following conditions: rotation<br>
speed: 3000 rpm torque 3.1 Nm/rib; duration: 24 hours<br>
d)	measuring the tension (Tf) at the end of the test<br>
e)	calculating the percentage decay TD~(Ti-Tf)/Ti<br>
For each batch of belts A, B, C the mean results of the modulus and of the tension decay were calculated, which are shown in the table below.<br>
From an examination of the above table it is clear how the use of a cord with a balanced construction according to the present invention (belt A) allows to reduce the modulus of the belt considerably, all other conditions being equal, and at the same time to keep the tension decay in use substantially unchanged with respect to the belts (B) of a conventional type, having cords with a non balanced structure.<br>
The comparative example concerning belt C shows how the increase in the number of twists per unit length allows a substantial reduction of the modulus to be obtained, but it also involves a considerably worse decay.<br>
Lastly it is clear that modifications and variations may be made to the belt realised according to the present invention without departing from the scope of protection of the claims. In particular, the material of the cord yarn may vary, for which another polyamide may be used, for example 4.6.<br><br>
Moreover,   the  construction  of  the   cord may vary,   as   long  as   it<br>
has a balanced structure. For example, a cord of the type 1X3 may be used (figure 4), that is in which three plied yarns are used made from a single yarn by means of primary twisting, which in turn are twisted together by secondary twisting, or 3x3 (three plied yarns of three yarns each). In this case too, the primary and secondary twisting must be carried out while keeping constant the "twist multiplier" parameter defined above.<br><br><br><br>
