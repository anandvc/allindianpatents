				<td>ORIG;.\!AL<br>
The present invention relates to a discharge device with a metered dose valve.<br>
In particular, the present invention deals with a discharge device with a metered dose valve for<br>
use with pressurized aerosol packs, containers or the like where a liquid product is pressurized<br>
by a liquefied or compressed gas or a solid product suspended in a liquefied gas but is not<br>
limited to such packs.<br>
Many pressurized aerosol packs contain a metered dose valve that accurately measures a single<br>
dose of the product within the pressurized reservoir. GB 2 198 707 A discloses a metering<br>
dispenser with a similar metered dose valve.<br>
Such valves are used in many applications including for example for delivering accurate<br>
amounts of a drug to a patient or animal. Generally the metered dose valve dispenses the total<br>
dose when it is opened with the user having no control over how much of the metered dose is<br>
delivered. In most cases this is an important aspect of the valve as for instance in the case of<br>
medical inhalers it is important that the patient receives no less or no more of the metered dose.<br>
Generally such metered dose valves are operated by depressing an actuator with finger pressure<br>
with the movement stopping only when the open position is reached. The metered dose valve is<br>
generally spring loaded so that it returns to the closed position when finger pressure is released.<br>
The majority of such metered dose valves have within an inlet valve and an outlet valve,<br>
usually containing cut gaskets. The inlet valve connects the canister liquid reservoir with the<br>
liquid to a metering chamber while the outlet valve connects the metering chamber to the<br>
atmosphere.<br>
When such valves are actuated by the user the user is only aware of two positions; closed and<br>
open or first and second. In the first position, the inlet valve is open and the outlet valve is<br>
closed. In the second position, the inlet valve is closed and the out-let valve is open. When in<br>
the first position the metering chamber is maintained full of liquid and sealed fi-om the<br>
atmosphere, and when in the second position the content of the metering chamber is allowed to<br>
flow into the atmosphere while the metering chamber is sealed fi-om the liquid pressurized<br>
canister or reservoir.<br>
On the way fi-om the first position to the second position and vice versa an intermediate<br>
position is passed but the user has no knowledge of this. What the user is un-aware of is that<br>
there is the intermediate position where both the inlet valve and the outlet valve are closed.<br>
This is because to accurately meter the product, i.e. the liquid, the inlet valve must be closed<br>
before the outlet valve is opened.<br>
Object of the present invention is to provide a discharge device that allows to discharge one<br>
metered dose of liquid in more than one step or action, in particular wherein the discharge can<br>
be interrupted and continued.<br>
The above object is achieved by a discharge device according to claim 1. Preferred<br>
embodiments are subject of the subclaims.<br>
-2-<br>
W A basic idea of the present invention is that an intermediate position of the valve<br>
element can be selected so that both the inlet valve and the outlet valve are closed.<br>
By moving or actuating the valve element between the second position and interme-<br>
* diate position, in particular by depressing and releasing an associated actuation<br>
B member or the like, one metered dose of liquid contained in the metering chamber<br>
\ can be discharged in more than one step. Thus, the user can discharge the total content<br>
or metered dose of the metering chamber in more than one action. This is possible,<br>
because the intermediate position can be selected by the user allowing the user<br>
to switch to the second position more than once before the total content or dose of<br>
10 the metering chamber is discharged. This is advantageous for some applications.<br>
! In the present invention, the term "liquid" has to be understood in broad sense. In<br>
i particular, it shall cover all kinds of liquids, fluids, mixtures, suspensions, liquefied<br>
I gases, or the like that may be discharged by a metered dose valve.<br>
15<br>

In the figures, the same reference signs are used for the same or similar components,<br>
1D wherein same or similar characteristics or advantages are achieved even if a repeated<br>
discussion is omitted.<br>
Fig. 1 to 3 show in schematic partial sections a discharge device 1 with a metered<br>
dose valve 2 according to the prior art.<br>
15<br>
The discharge device 1 comprises a canister, reservoir or container 3 for pressurized<br>
liquid 4. If necessary or desired the pressurized liquid 4 may be stored in a bag (not<br>
shown) in the container 3.<br>
2 3 The liquid 4 may be pressurized by a liquefied gas or compressed gas or by any suitable<br>
biasing means or any other means. If the liquid 4 is stored in a bag within the<br>
container 4, gas may be used in the container 4 and/or in the bag for pressurizing the<br>
liquid 4.<br>
25 The metered dose valve 2 comprises a movable valve element 5 and a metering<br>
chamber 6 with an associated inlet valve 7 and an associated outlet valve 8.<br>
The valve element 5 allows actuation ofthe inlet valve 7 and the outlet valve 8 and<br>
preferably forms a part of these valves 7, 8.<br>
30<br>
The valve element 5 comprises a first axial channel 9 connected with a first radial<br>
aperture 10 and passes through a first gasket 11. The inlet valve 7 is formed by the<br>
first gasket 11, the first channel 9 and the first aperture 10. In the first position<br>
shown in fig. 1, the aperture 10 opens within the metering chamber 6, i.e. is not cov-<br>
: 5 ered by the gasket 11 or does not open outside the metered dose valve 2. Thus, the<br>
inlet valve 7 is open in this first position so that the liquid 4 can fill the metering<br>
chamber 6 due to the pressure in the container 3.<br>
The valve element 5 further comprises at its other end a second axial channel 12<br>
^ 0 connected with a second radial aperture 13 and passes through a second gasket 14.<br>
This second gasket 14, second channel 12 and second aperture 13 from the outlet<br>
valve 8. In the first position ofthe valve element 5 shown in fig. 1, the aperture 13 is<br>
either covered by the gasket 14 and/or opens outside the metering chamber 6, so that<br>
the outlet valve 8 is closed. Thus, liquid 4 cannot be discharged from the metering '<br>
^ 5 chamber 6 through outlet valve 8 in the first position.<br>
^ In the present embodiment, the inlet valve 7 and the outlet valve 8 are of the cut gasket<br>
type with cross orifices or apertures 10, 13. However, the valves 7, 8 may be<br>
constructed in any other suitable manner.<br>
5 The valve element 5 is biased into the first position. In the shown embodiment, the<br>
metered dose valve 2 comprises a spring 15 for biasing the valve element 5 in the<br>
first or upper position as shown in fig. 1. Preferably, the spring 15 is located within<br>
the metering chamber 6.<br>
•<br>
; 0 In the present embodiment, the valve element 5 or the metered dose valve 2 is<br>
mounted by a metal cup 16 to the container 3. In particular, the cup 16 is crimped on<br>
the container 16.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the valve element 8 in a partially depressed position, namely in the in-<br>
15 termediate position. In this intermediate position, the inlet valve 7 and the outlet<br>
valve 8 are closed simultaneously. In particular, the first and second apertures 10, 13<br>
are respecUvely covered by first gasket 11 and second gasket 14, respectively. In the<br>
intermediate position, the content or metered dose in the metering chamber 6 is isolated<br>
from both the container 3 and the atmosphere.<br>
20<br>
However, the user of this state of the art metered dose valve 2 is not aware of this intermediate<br>
position during the actuation of the discharge device 1 or metered discharge<br>
valve 2, i. e. during the movement of the valve element 5 towards the second<br>
position.<br>
25<br>
Fig. 3 shows the valve element 5 in the second position that is finally reached due to<br>
the pressure applied by a user (net shown). In this second position, the inlet valve 7<br>
is closed and the outlet valve 8 is open, so that the content or metered dose of liquid<br>
4 in the metering chamber 6 is discharged to the atmosphere via the second aperture<br>
33 13, the second channel 12, and preferably a discharge head, tube or the like (not<br>
shown). The discharge from the discharge device 1 or its metered dose valve 2 may<br>
be in the form of a liquid stream, jet, spray, foam or solid particles or any other form.<br>
When the user releases the pressure on the valve element 5, in particular by releasing<br>
3 5 an associated actuation member (not shown), the biasing force returns the valve element<br>
5 directly via the intermediate position to the first position resulting in refilling<br>
of the metering chamber 6 with liquid 4. Consequently, the prior art metered dose<br>
valve 2 is not suitable to discharge one metered dose of liquid 4 discontinuately or in<br>
more than one step or actuation.<br>
4) I<br>
In the following, two embodiments according to the present invention will be described<br>
with reference to fig. 4 to 10, wherein basically only important differences<br>
between the proposed embodiment 5 according to the present invention and the dis- ^<br>
charge device 1 with its metered dose valve 2 of the prior art according to fig. 1 to 3 f<br>
4 i will be emphasized. •<br>
-<br>
w According to the present invention, one metered dose of liquid 4 can be discharged<br>
discontinuately or in muUiple steps from the metering chamber 6. In particular, it is<br>
possible to depress and release the valve element 5 alternately in a "discharge state"<br>
I to discharge the metered dose of liquid 4 as desired, but without refilling the meter-<br>
5 ing chamber 6 with liquid 4 from the container 3 during this alternate actuation. In<br>
particular, this kind of actuation is possible because the discharge device 1 or metered<br>
dose valve 2 can be switched or set into the so-called discharged state permitting<br>
this kind of actuation. In this discharge state, the valve element is moveable only<br>
between the second position and the intermediate position alternately, wherein this<br>
10 second position and this intermediate position correspond to the second position and<br>
intermediate position, respectively, as described in the introductory part of the description<br>
and with regard to the prior art metered dose valve 2.<br>
The discharge device 1 / metered dose valve 2 can be switched or set also in a "non-<br>
15 discharge state". In this non-discharge state, refilling of the metering chamber 6 with<br>
liquid 4 is permitted. In particular, the valve element 5 can return from the intermediate<br>
position to the first position allowing refill of the metering chamber 6 with liquid<br>
4. This first position corresponds to the first position mentioned in the introductory<br>
part of the description and the one explained with regard to the prior art metered<br>
20 dose valve 2 according to figures 1 to 3. In particular, the valve element 5 returns to<br>
I the first posifion upon release due to the biasing force of spring 15.<br>
Preferably, the switching between the discharge state and the non-discharge state<br>
and/or vice versa is only possible in the intermediate position.<br>
Preferably, the switching between the discharge state and the non-discharge state<br>
and/or vice versa is performed by rotating the valve element 5, an associated actuation<br>
member 17, a discharge head, a locking or housing element 18 or the like.<br>
3) However, the switching or locking mechanism could include additionally or alternatively<br>
a catch or ratchet mechanism or the like. For example, a release button or the<br>
like could be depressed or actuated in order to switch from the discharge state into<br>
the non-discharge state without the necessity to rotate or twist any element.<br>
3 ) Fig. 4 to 6 show schematic partial sections of the discharge device 1 with the metered<br>
dose valve 2 according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
The actuation member 17, in particular a discharge head or the like, is associated to<br>
and preferably mounted on the valve element 5. The discharge device 1 or the me-<br>
4) tered dose valve 2 further comprises the housing or locking element 18 cooperating<br>
with the actuation member 17 such that the following desired function can be<br>
achieved.<br>
Starting with the first position shown in fig. 4, the actuation member 17 / valve ele-<br>
4 i ment 5 can be manually depressed by a user (not shown) from the first position only<br>
until the intermediate position is reached due to a first stop 19. In particular, a pref- ^<br>
#<br>
w erably protruding portion 20 of the actuation member 17 abuts at first stop 19. This<br>
forms a first locking means.<br>
j By relative rotation between the actuation member 17 and the locking element 18 in<br>
5 the intermediate position, i. e. in the partly depressed position, the first stop 19 can<br>
be overcome and the first locking means unlocked, respectively, as shown in fig. 5<br>
and thus the discharge device is switched from the non-discharge state to the discharge<br>
state. It has to be noted that fig. 5 is a perpendicular section of fig. 4. The rotating<br>
axis is preferably parallel to the axis or direction of actuation of the valve ele-<br>
10 ment5.<br>
Then, the user can depress the actuation member 17/ valve element 5 further from<br>
the intermediate position shown in fig. 5 to the second position shown in fig. 6.<br>
Then, discharge of liquid 4 starts. The liquid 4 is discharged form the metering<br>
15 chamber 6 through the open outlet valve 8 and an outlet channel 21 in the actuation<br>
member 17 / discharge head to the atmosphere.<br>
When the user releases the pressure on actuation member 17, the valve element 5 returns<br>
to the intermediate position due to the biasing force of spring 15, but is limited<br>
20 in its movement fi-om the intermediate posifion to the first position by a second stop<br>
21 or second locking means. Thus, reaching of the first position and refilling of metering<br>
chamber 6 are prevented in the discharge state, i.e. in the present embodiment<br>
in this rotational state of the actuation member 17 relative to the locking element 18.<br>
In this state, the actuation member 17 and valve element 5 can be depressed and re-<br>
2 5 leased alternately multiple times in order to alternate between the intermediate position<br>
and the second position to discharge only one metered dose o f liquid 4 in muUiple<br>
steps or discontinuately, as desired.<br>
After complete or partial release of the liquid 4 from the metering chamber 6, the<br>
: 0 discharge device 1 / metered dose valve 2 can be switched or twisted back into its<br>
non-discharge state by relative rotation - preferably in the backwords direction - between<br>
the actuation member 17 and the housing / locking element 18 to overcome<br>
the second stop 22, i.e. to unlock the second locking means.<br>
2 5 Then, the valve element 5 will return to its first position after release of the actuafion<br>
member 17, and the metering chamber 4 will refill with liquid 4 due to the pressure I<br>
in the container 3 acting on the liquid 4.<br>
According to the present invention, the intermediate position of the valve element 5<br>
^ 0 can be selected. While in the first position, the second position cannot be selected directly<br>
and vice versa.<br>
In the first embodiment according to the present invention, the actuation member 17<br>
is rotated relative to the housing or locking element 18 b y an angle of about 90° for<br>
^ 5 switching between the discharge state and the non-discharge state and vice versa.<br>
However, any other suitable angle is possible. Depending on the structure, it might<br>
be necessary to twist in opposite directions for switching to the discharge state and<br>
w non-discharge state, respectively. However, it might also be possible to twist in the<br>
same direction in both cases.<br>
Fig. 7 shows a schematic curved section of a part of the circumferential wall pro-<br>
) vided by the housing or locking element 18 and illustrates the function of the first /<br>
second locking means. The housing or locking element 18 comprises a recess 23.<br>
The recess 23 is radially open and preferably stepped in circumferential direction<br>
forming the first stop 19 and second stop 22. The protruding portion 20 can engage<br>
into the recess 23. Fig. 7 represents the intermediate position in the discharge state as<br>
]lb shown in fig. 5. Arrow 24 represents the movement between the intermediate posi-<br>
I tion and the second position in the discharge state. Arrow 25 represents the movement<br>
for switching between the discharge state and non-discharge state, i.e. the relative<br>
rotation between actuation member 17 and the housing / locking element 18. Arrow<br>
26 represents the movement between the intermediate position and the first posi-<br>
: 5 tion in the non-discharge state.<br>
It is apparent from fig. 7, that the first stop 19 and the second stop 22 can be overcome<br>
alternately by the rotation, i.e. if the first locking means is locked the second<br>
locking means is unlocked and vice versa.<br>
20<br>
In the present invention, the metered dose valve 2 allows the user to select three positions:<br>
(a) the first position where the inlet valve 7 is open and the outlet valve 8 is<br>
25 closed;<br>
(b) the intermediate position (ready to use position) where both inlet and outlet<br>
valves 7, 8 are closed;<br>
30 (c) the second position where the inlet valve 7 is closed and the outlet valve 8<br>
is open.<br>
The rotating locking mechanism according to the present invention for allowing the<br>
proposed function - in particular the first and/or second stop 19, 22; the first and/or<br>
35 second locking means - may be located within the valve body of the metered dose<br>
valve 2 or outside of the valve body.<br>
As already mentioned, the intermediate position and the discharge state may be<br>
reached from the first position by depressing and, then, by rotating or twisfing the<br>
4 D actuation member 17. The second position may be reached from the intermediate position<br>
by fiirther depressing the actuation member 17. To refill the metering chamber<br>
6, the user preferably counter rotates the actuation member 17 in the intermediate<br>
position into the non-discharge state allowing the spring 15 to return the valve element<br>
5 to the first position shown in fig. 4. In the first position, the inlet valve 7 is '<br>
45 open allowing liquid 4 from the container 3 to enter the metering chamber 6.<br>
In the discharge state, the user has full control over discharging the content of the<br>
metering chamber 6 by depressing the actuation member 17 fi^om the intermediate<br>
- ^<br>
I<br>
9 position to the second position as many times as it takes to empty the metering<br>
chamber 6.<br>
In order to allow easy handling without any stress, the volume of the metering<br>
5 chamber 6 is adapted to the discharge rate preferably such that the time for completely<br>
discharging one metered dose of liquid 4 from the chamber 6 exceeds at least<br>
2 s, in particular 5 s. Preferably, the volume of the metering chamber is about 5 )il to<br>
15 ml, in particular about 10 to 20 ml.<br>
0 In order to allow easy handling, the stroke of the actuation member 17 / valve element<br>
5 from the first position to the second position in actuation direction should exceed<br>
2 mm, in particular 5 mm.<br>
It has to be noted that also other suitable valve designs can be used in particular with<br>
5 regard to the inlet valve 7 and the outlet valve 8.<br>
The discharge device 1 according to the first embodiment is adapted, in particular,<br>
for use upside down, i.e. with the discharge outlet or head / actuation member 17 at<br>
the lower end. Fig. 1 to 6 show the discharge device 1 in the upright orientation, but<br>
; 0 with the liquid 4 already filling the upper part of the container 3 completely as it is<br>
the case in the upside down orientation.<br>
In the following, the discharge device 1 according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention will be described with reference to figures 8 to 10, wherein merely<br>
25 main differences between the second embodiment and the first embodiment will be<br>
emphasized.<br>
The discharge device 1 / metered dose valve 2 according to the present invention<br>
comprises a dip hose 27 connected to the inlet valve 7 of the metered dose valve 2<br>
30 and a dip tube 28 within the metering chamber 6 and connected to the outlet valve 8.<br>
This allows in particular vertical use, i.e. without inversion of the discharge device 1.<br>
Fig. 8 shows the discharge device 1 in the first position. Fig. 9 shows the discharge<br>
device 1 in the discharge state in the intermediate position. Fig. 10 shows the dis-<br>
3 5 charge device 1 in the second position, i.e. during discharge of fluid 4.<br>
The operation and function of the discharge device 1 and its metered dose valve 2<br>
according to the second embodiment are basically the same as the ones of the first<br>
embodiment. However, the rotating locking mechanism is constructed in a slightly<br>
' 4) different manner.<br>
The housing / locking element 18 has a ring-like form and is held by the cup 16. In<br>
particular, the element 18 comprises an upper ring section 29 and a spaced lower<br>
ring section 30 as shown in fig. 8 to 10. The first ring section 29 comprises vertical<br>
4 i recesses 23 aligned with protruding portions or lugs 20 of the actuation member 17<br>
so that these lugs 20 can pass trough the ring section 29 when depressing the actuation<br>
member 17 from the first posifion into the intermediate position.<br>
- ? -<br>
•<br>
In this rotational state (non-discharge state), the lower ring section 30 forms the first<br>
stop 19 at which the lugs 20 abutt. Fig. 9 shows the discharge device 1 in the intermediate<br>
position after twisting the actuation member 17 into the discharge state.<br>
' &gt;<br>
In the discharge state, the upper ring section 29 forms the second stop 22 for the lugs<br>
20 to prevent refilling of the metering chamber 6 that would happen otherwise if the<br>
spring 15 could return the valve element 5 into the first position.<br>
10 In the discharge state, the lugs 20 are aligned with vertical slits or recesses 23 in the<br>
lower ring section 30, so that the lugs 20 can pass through the lower ring section 30<br>
when depressing the actuation member 17 from the intermediate position into the<br>
second position shown in fig. 10 for discharging liquid 4 from the metering chamber<br>
6 through the outlet valve 8 and the outlet channel 21 to the atmosphere. In the sec-<br>
)5 ond embodiment, the outlet channel 21 is preferably formed by a hose-like protrusion<br>
of the actuation member 17 or the like.<br>
After release of the actuation member 17, the biasing force of spring 15 returns the<br>
valve element 5 and actuation member 17 to the intermediate position shown in fig.<br>
10 9 and, thus, stops discharge of fluid 4 from the metering chamber 6. In this discharge<br>
state, the user can depress and release the actuation member 17 as many times as desired<br>
to discharge the liquid 4 from the metering chamber 6 discontinuately or in respective<br>
steps.<br>
'!5 Finally, the actuation member 17 can be twisted back into the non-discharge state.<br>
This is possible due to a respective circumferential space for the lugs 20 between the<br>
upper ring section 29 and the lower ring section 30. Then, the spring 15 returns the<br>
valve element 5 and the actuation member 17 to the first position, and the metering<br>
chamber 6 is refilled with liquid 4 from the container 3.<br>
0<br>
A discharge device with a metered dose valve is proposed. The metered dose valve<br>
comprises an inlet valve, a metering chamber and an outlet valve. In order to allow<br>
discharge of fluid from the metering chamber in multiple steps, a user can depress<br>
and release an actuation member multiple times in a selected discharge state wherein<br>
;5 refill ofthe metering chamber with new liquid is prevented.<br>
