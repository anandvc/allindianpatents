1	The Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to network communication technology More specifically, the present invention relates to mechanisms in which the secunty configuration for initiators responsible for communicating with networked target devices is closely coordinated so as to avoid secunty conflicts<br>
2	Background and Related Art<br>
Computing technology has transformed the way we work and play In a typical configuration, a computing system is coupled through a local bus to a vanety of hardware devices for optimal operation Such devices may include, for example, magnetic and/or optical disk dnves, pnnters, fax machines, scanners, cameras, or the like. The computing system communicates with each of the connected hardware devices using a standard communication protocol that is recognized by the hardware device<br>
One commonly used commumcation protocol for communication between a computing system and its vanous connected hardware devices is a parallel interface standard called "Small Computer System Interface" ("SCSF' for short). SCSI allows for effective block transfer of data between a computing system and its vanous penpheral devices However, SCSI does have certain limitations In particular, data transfer using SCSI is relatively slow compared to other data transfer mechanisms Furthermore, the cable length of the SCSI is relatively short compared to expansive networks. Accordingly, the hardware devices typically have to be close to the computing system if SCSI is employed in its purest form.<br>
One improvement to SCSI is called "Internet SCSI" ("iSCSI" for short) iSCSI IS a standard which allows standard SCSI commands and responses to be communicated over any IP-based network such as Ethernets and the Internet The computing system includes an "initiator" (which may be hardware or software) which initiates communication with the target device using the iSCSI standard. Specifically, the SCSI message is fi-agmented if needed and then encapsulated with Internet Protocol (IP) headers, whereupon the properly fi-agmented and encapsulated SCSI<br>
message is sent over the IP network The target device then extracts and executes the SCSI command, and then returns the response, if any, using the iSCSI standard over the IP-based network<br>
The iSCSI standard allows SCSI commands to be delivered over great lengths. Accordingly, target devices may be remotely located from its associated computing system or systems. Accordingly, target devices may be more easily shared, and need not clutter the local space occupied by the associated computing system. In addition, many typical IP-networks operate at high frequencies iSCSI may even support Ethernets that operate m the Gigabit per second range. Accordingly, iSCSI allows more rapid data transfer even over greater distances than the simple use of SCSI typically allows<br>
However, fransfemng iSCSI commands over an IP-based network introduces greater secunty threats than does the simple use of SCSI over a local bus For instance The iSCSI communications may be intercepted, eavesdropped, or highjacked Accordingly, for sensitive iSCSI communications, a secunty standard compatible with IP called IP Sec is often used for authentication and/or encryption of the message<br>
However, IPSec has a number of secunty configuration options For example, IPSec supports a vanety of encryption algonthms, includes options regarding what part of the message is to be encrypted, and what type of authentication is to be employed The initiator responsible for communicating with a target device must be properly configured with the appropnate IPSec secunty information in order for the communication to be secured as desired and interpretable by the target device In computing systems that have multiple initiators, the initiators are typically configured without regarding for the secunty configuration of the other initiators in the computing system Accordingly, sometimes conflicts anse between the secunty configurations of the initiators These conflicts may prevent the imtiators from functioning as intended, or even fianctioning at all. The nsk of such conflicts may be especially great when the initiators are supplied by different venders<br>
Accordingly, what would be advantageous are mechanisms in which multiple imtiators  on  a  computing  system  may be  properly  configured  with  secunty<br>
information in a manner that the secunty information of one initiator does not conflict with the secunty information of any other initiator<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The foregoing problems with the pnor state of the art are overcome by the pnnciples of the present invention, which is directed towards an abstraction module that facilitates secunty configuration amongst a number of imtiators in a manner that there are no conflicts m the secunty information across all initiators Each initiator may establish communications with one or more target hardware devices using a specific standard such as iSCSI that is recognized by the hardware device<br>
The abstraction module exposes a common interface that may be used to configure any of the initiators The abstraction module receives through this common interface an indication that a selected one of the initiators is to be configured to communicate with a selected target device The indication may be provided, for example, in response to an express request from an application or user to communicate with the selected target device Alternatively, the indication may be provided m advance of any express application or user request to commumcate with the selected target device For example, the indication may be received upon imtialization of the computer system The target device may be, for example, magnetic and/or optical disk dnves, printers, fax machines, scanners, cameras, or the like<br>
The abstraction module then retneves secunty information fi-om a common database that includes information that is relevant to configunng secunty for any of the plurality of initiators. The database may be, for example, a MICROSOFT ® ACTIVE DIRECTORY ® or an ISNS database. The secunty information may be, for example, IPSec secunty configuration settings<br>
The abstraction module then identifies a secunty configuration for the selected initiator using the retneved secunty information. The identified secunty information may even be the same as the retneved secunty information, without any manipulation whatsoever. If the abstraction module determines that the identified configuration settings would not cause a conflict with any of the other of the initiators, then the abstraction module configures the selected initiator using the identified secunty<br>
configuration Accordingly, the selected initiator may be configured to communicate with the target hardware device without degrading the ability of other initiators to commimicate<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The pnnciples of the present invention relate to an abstraction module that facilitates secunty configuration amongst a number of initiators m a manner that there<br>
are no conflicts m the secunty information across all initiators. Each initiator establishes communications with one or more target hardware devices using a specific standard The abstraction module exposes a common interface that may be used to configure any of the initiators.<br>
The abstraction module receives through this common interface an indication that a selected one of the initiators is to be configured to communicate with a selected target device, and retneves secunty information from a common database, the database including information that is relevant to configunng secunty for any of the plurality of initiators The abstraction module identifies a secunty configuration for the selected initiator using the retneved secunty information and, if the associated secunty settings would not cause a conflict with any of the other of the initiators, uses the identified secunty configuration to configure the selected initiator. Accordingly, the selected initiator may be configured to communicate with the target hardware device without degrading the ability of other initiators to communicate<br>
Embodiments within the scope of the present invention include computer-readable media for carrying or having computer-executable instructions or data structures stored thereon. Such computer-readable media can be any available media which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer. By way of example, and not limitation, such computer-readable media can compnse physical computer-readable media such as RAM, ROM, EEPROM, CD-ROM or other optical disk storage, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or any other medium which can be used to carry or store desired program code means in the form of computer-executable instructions or data structures and which can be accessed by a general purpose or special purpose computer<br>
When information is transfened or provided over a network or another communications connection (either hardwired, wireless, or a combination of hardwired or wireless) to a computer, the computer properly views the connection as a computer-readable medium. Thus, any such a connection is properly termed a computer-readable medium Combinations of the above should also be included within the scope of computer-readable media Computer-executable instructions compnse, for example, any instructions and data which cause a general purpose<br>
computer, special purpose computer, or special purpose processing device to perform a certain function or group of functions The computer-executable instruction may be, for example, binaries, intermediate format instructions such as assembly language, or even source code Although not required, the invention will be descnbed in the general context of computer-executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by computers m network environments. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types.<br>
Those skilled m the art will appreciate that the invention may be practiced in network computing environments with many types of computer system configurations, including personal computers, hand-held devices, multi-processor systems, microprocessor-based or programmable consumer electronics, network PCs, minicomputers, mainfi^ame computers, and the like. The invention may also be practiced m distnbuted computing environments where tasks are performed by local and remote processing devices that are linked (either by hardwired links, wireless links, or by a combination of hardwired or wireless links) through a communications network In a distributed computing environment, program modules may be located in both local and remote memory storage devices<br>
Figure 1 illustrates suitable computing environment in which the pnnciples of the present invention may be employed in the form of a computer 120 The computer 120 includes a processing unit 121, a system memory 122, and a system bus 123 that couples vanous system components including the system memory 122 to the processing umt 121<br>
The system bus 123 may be any of several types of bus structures including a memory bus or memory controller, a penpheral bus, and a local bus using any of a vanety of bus architectures. The system memory includes read only memory (ROM) 124 and random access memory (RAM) 125 A basic input/output system (BIOS) 126, containing the basic routines that help transfer information between elements withm the computer 120, such as dunng start-up, may be stored in ROM 124.<br>
The computer 120 may also include a magnetic hard disk drive 127 for reading firom and wnting to a magnetic hard disk 139, a magnetic disk drive 128 for<br>
reading from or wnting to a removable magnetic disk 129, and an optical disk dnve 130 for reading from or wnting to removable optical disk 131 such as a CD-ROM or other optical media The magnetic hard disk dnve 127, magnetic disk dnve 128, and optical disk dnve 130 are connected to the system bus 123 by a hard disk dnve interface 132, a magnetic disk dnve-mterface 133, and an optical dnve interface 134, respectively The dnves and their associated computer-readable media provide nonvolatile storage of computer-executable instructions, data structures, program modules and other data for the computer 120. Although the exemplary environment descnbed herein employs a magnetic hard disk 139, a removable magnetic disk 129 and a removable optical disk 131, other types of computer readable media for stonng data can be used, including magnetic cassettes, flash memory cards, digital video disks, Bernoulli cartndges, RAMs, ROMs, and the like<br>
Program code means compnsmg one or more program modules may be stored on the hard disk 139, magnetic disk 129, optical disk 131, ROM 124 or RAM 125, including an operating system 135, one or more apphcation programs 136, other program modules 137, and program data 138. A user may enter commands and information into the computer 120 through keyboard 140, pointing device 142, or other input devices (not shown), such as a microphone, joy stick, game pad, satellite dish, scanner, or the like. These and other input devices are often connected to the processing unit 121 through a senal port interface 146 coupled to system bus 123. Alternatively, the input devices may be connected by other interfaces, such as a parallel port, a game port or a universal senal bus (USB) A monitor 147 or another display device is also connected to system bus 123 via an interface, such as video adapter 148 In addition to the monitor, personal computers typically include other penpheral output devices (not shown), such as speakers and pnnters<br>
The computer 120 may operate m a networked environment using logical connections to one or more remote computers, such as remote computers 149a and 149b. Remote computers 149a and 149b may each be another personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, and typically include many or all of the elements descnbed above relative to the computer 120, although only memory storage devices 150a and 150b and their associated<br>
application programs 136a and 136b have been illustrated in Figure 1 The logical connections depicted m Figure 1 include a local area network (LAN) 151 and a wide area network (WAN) 152 that are presented here by way of example and not limitation Such networking environments are commonplace m office-wide or enterpnse-wide computer networks, intranets and the Internet<br>
When used in a LAN networking environment, the computer 120 is connected to the local network 151 through a network interface or adapter 153 When used m a WAN networking environment, the computer 120 may include a modem 154, a wireless link, or other means for establishing communications over the wide area network 152, such as the Internet The modem 154, which may be internal or external, is connected to the system bus 123 via the serial port interface 146 In a networked environment, program modules depicted relative to the computer 120, or portions thereof, may be stored m the remote memory storage device It will be appreciated that the network connections shown are exemplary and other means of establishing communications over wide area network 152 may be used<br>
While Figure 1 represents a suitable operating environment for the present invention, the pnnciples of the present invention may be employed in any computing system that is capable of browsing to network sites The computing system illustrated in Figure 1 is illustrative only, and by no means represents even a small portion of the wide vanety of environments in which the pnnciples of the present invention may be implemented In the description and in the claims, a "computing system" is defined broadly as any hardware component or components that are capable of using software to perform one or more functions Examples of computing systems include desktop computers, laptop computers. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), telephones, or any other system or device that has processing capability<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a network environment 200 in which the pnnciples of the present may be employed The network environment 200 includes a computing system 201 that may communicate over a network 240 with a number of different target hardware devices 250 The computing system 201 may be, for example, the computer 120 descnbed above or any other computing system<br>
The target hardware devices 250 may include any hardware devices such as, for example, magnetic and/or optical disk drives, pnnters, fax machines, scanners, cameras, or the like. In the illustrated embodiment, the computing system may communicate with target hardware devices 251 through 254 among potentially others as represented by the honzontal ellipses 255 However, the computing system may be capable of communicating with other number of target hardware devices whether over a network or whether locally connected to the computing system<br>
One standard that may be used to commumcate with target hardware devices is called Internet SCSI ("iSCSI" for short) As previously mentioned, iSCSI is a standard which allows standard SCSI commands and responses to be communicated over any IP-based network such as Ethernets and the Internet SCSI is a parallel interface standard called "Small Computer System Interface" (SCSI for short) SCSI allows for effective block transfer between a computing system and its vanous penpheral devices Whereas SCSI is used for effective block transfer of data to a computing system's penpheral devices, data transfer using SCSI is relatively slow Furthermore, SCSI cables are limited m length Accordingly, SCSI alone is typically used for very local penpheral devices. iSCSI, on the other hand, is much faster and allows the target hardware devices to be located anywhere on a network. However, iSCSI communications are much more susceptible to interception and other secunty nsk inherent with communicating over a network<br>
The computing system 201 includes a number of initiators 231 through 233 among potentially other as represented by the honzontal ellipses 234, although the computing system 201 may also have fewer than three initiators Each initiator may be a hardware component such as a plug-in board, or may be a software initiator that IS instantiated in memory during runtime. Regardless, the initiator is configured to communicate with the target devices 250 over the network 240 in response to a request that requires the same from the upper-layer module 210 The initiators may be, for example, iSCSI initiators although that is not required.<br>
The upper layer module 210 may be an application program such as, for example, one of application programs 136, or may be one of the other program modules 137    The upper layer module 210 may also present a single unified user<br>
interface for use regardless of the initiator to be used There may also be multiple upper layer modules that may also cause any given initiator to commumcate with a target device. The imtiators 230 may each be, for example, one of the program modules 137 The network 240 may be any network whether spanning multiple computing systems, or whether internal to a single computing system If the initiators are iSCSI initiators, the network may be, for example, an Internet Protocol (IP) based network including an Ethernet, a token nng network, the Internet, or the like<br>
As previously mentioned, each initiator 230 may have its own secunty configuration settings. For example, if the initiators 230 were iSCSI initiators, the secunty configuration settings could be, for example, IPSec configuration settings The initiator abstraction module 220 intercedes between any upper layer module (such as upper-layer module 210) and the initiators 230, and forces consistency between any configuration settings of the various initiators 230 Accordingly, the initiators 230 retain their desired fiinction since the initiator abstraction module 220 ensures no secunty setting conflicts<br>
The initiator abstraction module 220 includes an abstraction component 222 which contains the logic that enforces secunty configuration setting consistency amongst all of the initiators 230 The abstraction component 222 may communicate with the initiators 230 (and vice versa) via the API 223. The abstraction component 220 may communicate with upper-layer module 210 (and vice versa) via the API 221 Optionally, the abstraction component 220 may also cache the secunty information This caching allows a hardware card that does not have non volatile memory to maintain the conect secunty configuration at each system power up The caching also allows the card to be replaced with an identical card and not require the new card to be reprogrammed with the secunty information<br>
Each initiator 230 may register with the abstraction component 222 dunng installation and/or power-up or upon the occurrence of some other event The registration may involve an identification of the initiator, as well as potentially notifications on the current secunty settings In any case, the abstraction component 222 has a record of the initiator and may determine whether the imtiator needs updated configuration information. The operation of the architecture of Figure 2 and<br>
the remaining features of Figure 2 will be descnbed in further detail with respect to Figure 3<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a flowchart of a method 300 for configunng the computer system to securely communicate with a target device over the network The method 300 is performed by the abstraction component 222, which contains the logic that sets the secunty configuration settings (e g , EPSec settings) for each of the initiators in a manner that secunty conflicts between the initiators is avoided<br>
The abstraction component 222 exposes a common interface that may be used to configure any of the plurahty of initiators (act 301) This common interface is represented m Figure 2 as Application Program Interface (API) 221<br>
At some point, the abstraction component 222 receives an indication through the common interface that a selected initiator from among the plurality of initiators is to be configured to communicate with a selected target device (act 302) The indication may also represent that multiple (or even all) of the initiators is to communicate with the selected target device The indication itself may include secunty configuration (IPSec setting) information The indication may identify the target hardware device in any manner that is recognized by the abstraction component 222 For example, if the initiators 230 were iSCSI initiators, the indication may identify the target hardware device using a portal or EP address of the target hardware device The indication may be provided, for example, in response to an express request from an application or user to commumcate with the selected target device Alternatively, the indication may be provided in advance of any express application or user request to communicate with the selected target device For example, the indication may be received upon imtiahzation of the computer system.<br>
In any case, the method 300 includes a functional, result-onented step for causing the selected initiator to commimicate with the selected target device such that the secunty configuration of the selected initiator does not conflict with others of the plurahty of imtiators (step 310). This functional, result-onented step may include any corresponding acts for accomplishing the specified result. However, m the illustrated embodiment, the step 310 includes corresponding acts 311 through 314 Concurrently with setting configuration settings for one target device as specified in step 310, the<br>
abstraction component 222 may also set configuration settings for other target devices as well, especially if this is needed to ensure no conflicts between the initiators 230<br>
Specifically, the abstraction component 222 retneves security information from a common directory that includes mformation that is relevant to secunty configuration settings for any of the initiators 230 (act 311) The database may be, for example, a distnbuted database such as MICROSOFT ® ACTIVE DIRECTORY ®, an Internet Storage Name Service (ISNS) database, or perhaps a local store such as a registry for example. The mformation contained m the database may include IPSec information, CHallenge Authentication Protocol (CHAP) or Certificate based authentication information The distnbuted database may be shared by computing systems other than computing system 210 that have instances of the initiator abstraction module 220 The database may also be a locally persistent store m which information from the common database was previously cached for future configuration of the initiators 230 The database may also be a combination of the distnbuted database and the persistent store<br>
The initiator abstraction module 220 then identifies a secunty configuration for the selected initiator that is to be configured to commumcate with the selected target hardware device This secunty configuration may include the secunty information retneved from the database with potentially some further processing performed by the abstraction component In some cases, the initiators may have been preconfigured with information from the common database.<br>
The initiator abstraction module 220 then determines that the identified secunty configuration would not cause the selected initiator to conflict with any of the other of the imtiators (act 313). If a conflict does exist (Yes in act 313), then the abstraction component 222 does one or both of reconfigunng other initiators so that the conflict is eliminated or identifying another secunty configuration for the selected initiator If a conflict does not exist (No in act 313), then the absfraction component 222 configures the selected initiator using the identified secunty configuration (act 314).<br>
The configuration settings for IPSec secunty include whether or not to use a key, whether or not tunneling mode is desired, which encryption algonthm is to be<br><br>
used, and other known IPSec settmg options. The abstraction component 222 may then give the proper security settmgs to the configuration module 262 For example, if the security mformation is IPSec settings for commumcation usmg iSCSI, the configuration module 262 may be the TCP/IP configuration module for a software uutiator When commumcatmg, the software imtiator may use the TCP/IP protocol stack offered by the operatmg system If the imtiator is a hardware imtiator, the hardware imtiator may include its own protocol stack (e g., its own TCP/IP stack), and thus may configure its own memory m response to instructions from the imtiator abstraction module 220 When commumcatmg, the hardware imtiator may use its own mtemal TCP/IP stack.<br>
Accordmgly, a mechamsm has been descnbed m which an imtiator abstraction module 220 forces consistently m secunty settings between all initiators on a single computing system Accordmgly, no conflicts anse between initiators, while enabling secure and fast data transfer between target hardware devices configured on a network, and the computmg system<br>
The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spint or essential charactenstics. The descnbed embodiments are to be considered m all respects only as illustrative and not restnctive The scope of the mvention is, therefore, indicated by the appended claims rather than by the foregoing descnption. All changes, which come within the meamng and range of equivalency of the claims, are to be embraced within therr scope.<br><br><br><br><br>
