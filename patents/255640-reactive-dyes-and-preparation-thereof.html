Reactive dyes, preparation thereof -<br>
This invention relates to the technical field of fiber-reactive azo dyes.<br>
The commercial practice of dyeing with fiber-reactive dyes has led to heightened<br>
expectations with regard to the quality of the dyeings and the economics of the dyeing<br>
operations. There consequently continues to be a demand for novel fiber-reactive dyes<br>
having improved properties. Especially in the case of dyes having a yellow hue the<br>
demand is for reactive dyes that provide high color strengths.<br>
Numerous fiber-reactive dyes are described in the literature as useful for dyeing or printing<br>
hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing fibers, such as cellulosic fibers in particular, to<br>
produce yellow dyeings.<br>
Of these dyes, it is especially those which are known from DE 29 27 102 A, DE 31 02 287,<br>
and EP 0 021 105 A1 which are of industrial interest. However, these conventional yellow-<br>
dyeing dyes do not adequately meet the latest requirements with regard to their use in<br>
specific dyeing processes, the dyeability of the fibers and the fastness properties of<br>
dyeings obtainable therewith, for example.<br>
EP 0 567 036 A1 further describes yellow-dyeing fiber-reactive dyes that do not<br>
adequately satisfy the stated criteria. Especially the color strength of these products on<br>
cellulose fibers is unsatisfactory.<br>
The present invention, then, provides dyes and dye mixtures whose dyeings surprisingly<br>
have a distinctly higher color strength compared with the dyes described in EP 0 567 036<br>
A1.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to dyes of the general formula (1)<br><br><br>
where<br>
M is hydrogen or an alkali metal, and<br>
X is chlorine or fluorine.<br>
The present invention also relates to dye mixtures comprising one or more of the dyes of<br>
the general formula (1) and also one or more further fiber-reactive dyes.<br>
Preferred dye mixtures according to the present invention comprise one or more of the<br>
dyes of the general formula (1) and also at least one dye selected from the general<br>
formulae (2), (3) and (4)<br><br><br><br>
where<br>
D	is the radical of benzene or of naphthalene;<br>

ethyl, n-propyl, i-propyl, n-butyl, i-butyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl. Methyl and ethyl are<br>
particularly preferred. The same, mutates mutandis, holds for (C1-C4)-alkoxy groups, for<br>
which methoxy or ethoxy are accordingly particularly preferred.<br>
The substituent R1 is preferably hydrogen, methyl or methoxy. The substituent R2 is<br>
preferably methyl or amino. The substituent R3 is preferably hydrogen, methyl, methoxy or<br>

Alkali-eliminable substituents in the β position of ethyl Y1 are in particular chlorine, sulfato,<br>
thiosulfato, phosphato, (C2-C5)-alkanoyloxy, for example acetyloxy, and sulfobenzoyloxy. It<br>
is particularly preferred for Y1 to be vinyl or β-sulfatoethyl.<br>
The groups "sulfato", "thiosulfato" and "phosphato" include not only their acid form but also<br>
their salt form. Accordingly, thiosulfato groups conform to the general formula -S-SO3M,<br><br>
phosphate groups to the general formula - OPO3M2 and sulfato groups to the general<br>
formula -OSO3M, in each of which M is as defined above.<br>
The group (MO3S)m-D- in the general formula (2) is preferably a group of the general<br>

where M and m are each as defined above.<br>
It is particularly preferred for the group (MO3S)m-D- in the general formula (2) to represent<br>
the groups of the general formulae (5a) to (5c) and also of the general formulae (7a) to<br>
(7e)<br><br>
Fiber-reactive radicals Z from the series of the halopyrimidines have in particular the<br>
general formula (8)<br><br><br>

Particularly preferred fiber-reactive radicals from the series of the halotriazines have the<br>
following formulae (9a) to (9g):<br><br>
where M is as defined above.<br><br>
In general, in the dye mixtures of the present invention, the dye of the general formula (1)<br>
is present in an amount from 90% to 10% by weight, preferably 70% to 30% by weight and<br>
more preferably 60% to 40% by weight, and at least one dye selected from the general<br>
formulae (2), (3) and (4) is present in an amount from 10% to 90% by weight, preferably<br>
30% to 70% by weight and more preferably 40% to 60% by weight, all based on the total<br>
amount of dye.<br>
Dyes of the general formulae (2) to (4) that contain an -SO2-Y1 group can be present in<br>
mixtures in which the individual dyes differ only in the reactive group -SO2-Y1. Preferred<br>
mixtures of this kind contain for example a dye of the general formulae (2), (3) or (4) where<br>
Y = vinyl and a dye of the general formulae (2), (3) or (4) where Y = p-sulfatoethyl. The<br>
fraction of dye in the vinylsulfonyl form may be up to about 30 mol%, based on the<br>
particular dye chromophore. Preferably, the fraction of vinylsulfonyl dye to p-ethyl-<br>
substituted dye is in a molar ratio between 5:95 and 30:70.<br>
The present invention's dyes of the general formula (I) and also the present invention's<br>
dye mixtures are generally present as a formulation in solid or liquid (dissolved) form. In<br>
solid form, they generally contain the electrolyte salts customary in the case of water-<br>
soluble and in particular fiber-reactive dyes, such as sodium chloride, potassium chloride<br>
and sodium sulfate, and may further contain the auxiliaries customary in commercial dyes,<br>
such as buffer substances capable of setting a pH in aqueous solution between 3 and 7,<br>
such as sodium acetate, sodium borate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium dihydrogen-<br>
phosphate, sodium tricitrate and disodium hydrogenphosphate, small amounts of<br>
siccatives or when they are present in liquid, aqueous solution (including a content of<br>
thickeners of the type customary in print pastes), they may also contain substances which<br>
ensure a long life for this formulations, examples being mold-preventing agents.<br>
The present invention's dyes of the general formula (I) and also the present invention's<br>
dye mixtures are preferably present as a dye powder or as a dye granulate containing 10%<br>
to 80% by weight, based on the powder or granulate, of an electrolyte salt which is also<br>
known as a standardizing agent. Granulates have particle sizes in particular of 50 to 500<br>
urn. These solid formulations may additionally contain the aforementioned buffer<br>
substances in a total amount up to 10% by weight, based on the formulation. When the<br>
dyes or dye mixtures are present in aqueous solution, the total dye content in these<br>
aqueous solutions is up to about 50% by weight, for example between 5% and 50% by<br>
weight, the electrolyte salt content in these aqueous solutions preferably being below 10%<br><br>
by weight, based on the aqueous solution. The aqueous solutions (liquid formulations)<br>
may generally contain the aforementioned buffer substances in an amount up to 10% by<br>
weight, preferably up to 2% by weight.<br>
The present invention's dyes of the general formula (1) can be prepared by acylating a<br>
monoazo compound of the general formula (11)<br><br>
where M is as defined above, with a triazine compound of the general formula (12)<br><br>
where X is as defined above, and then condensing the resulting compound of the general<br>
formula (13)<br><br>
with N-methyltaurine.<br>
The monoazo compound of the general formula (11) is known from DE-A 4425222 and<br>
can be prepared similarly to the directions given therein.<br>
To prepare the present invention's dye of the general formula (1) where X is chlorine, the<br>
acylation of the monoazo compound of the formula (11) with cyanuric chloride and also the<br>
subsequent condensation with N-methyltaurine is carried out in the weakly acidic to neutral<br>
range. The reaction temperature is normally 20-40°C for the acylation and 50-60°C for the<br>
condensation.<br><br>
The present invention's dye of the general formula (1) where X is fluorine is preferably<br>
prepared by acylating the monoazo compound of the formula (11) with cyanuric fluoride at<br>
0 to -2°C in the weakly acidic range and then condensing with N-methyltaurine in the<br>
neutral to weakly acidic range and at 20-25°C.<br>
The dye mixtures of the present invention are obtainable by mechanically mixing the<br>
individual dyes in the desired weight ratio. The individual dyes may be utilized in the form<br>
of dye powders or dye solutions or else in the form of formulated commercial forms, i.e.,<br>
for example as a powder, as a granulate or as a liquid brand, which include customary<br>
auxiliaries.<br>
The dyes of the general formulae (2) and (3) are known and described for example in<br>
DE-A 3102287, US 5298607, EP 0 021 105 A1 and DE-A 1911427. They can be prepared<br>
similarly to the directions given therein. Similarly, dyes of the general formula (4) have<br>
been extensively described and are obtainable via standard methods of synthesis.<br>
The present invention's dyes and dye mixtures include further fiber-reactive dyes, in an<br>
amount up to 5% by weight, based on the total amount of dye, for shading purposes.<br>
These "shading dyes" can be added by customary mixing or else be prepared chemically<br>
in the same reaction batch together with the synthesis of a dye according to the present<br>
invention or of a dye mixture and be incorporated into the dye or dye mixture.<br>
The present invention's dyes and dye mixtures are useful for dyeing or printing hydroxyl-<br>
and/or carboxamido-containing materials and possess valuable performance<br>
characteristics for these purposes.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to the use of the present invention's dyes of the<br>
general formula (1) and also of the present invention's dye mixtures for dyeing or printing<br>
hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials or to be more precise to processes for<br>
dyeing or printing such materials in a conventional manner.<br>
Hydroxyl- and/or carboxamido-containing materials may be present for example in the<br>
form of sheetlike constructions or self-supporting films, but in particular in the form of<br><br>
fibers. Fibers in turn are preferably textile fibers, such as wovens or yarns which can<br>
be used in the form of hanks or wound packages.<br>
Carboxamido-containing materials are for example natural and synthetic polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes, for example wool and other animal hairs, soap, leather, nylon-6,6, nylon-6,<br>
nylon-11 and nylon-4.<br>
Preference is given to hydroxyl-containing materials of natural or synthetic origin, for<br>
example cellulose fiber materials or their regenerated products and polyvinyl alcohols.<br>
Cellulose fiber materials are preferably cotton, but also other vegetable fibers, such as<br>
linen, hemp, jute and ramie fibers. Regenerated fibers of cellulose are for example staple<br>
viscose and filament viscose and also chemically modified fibers of cellulose, such as<br>
aminated fibers of cellulose or fibers as described for example in WO 96/37641 and WO<br>
96/37642 and also in EP-A-0 538 785 and EP-A-0 692 559.<br>
The present invention's dyes and dye mixtures can be applied to and fixed on the<br>
substrates mentioned, especially the fiber materials mentioned, by the application<br>
techniques known for water-soluble dyes and especially for fiber-reactive dyes. For<br>
instance, on cellulose fibers they produce by the exhaust method from a long liquor and<br>
also from a short liquor, for example in a liquor to goods ratio of 5:1 to 100:1,<br>
preferably 6:1 to 30:1, using various acid-binding agents and optionally neutral salts as far<br>
as necessary, such as sodium chloride or sodium sulfate, dyeings having very good color<br>
yields. Application is preferably from an aqueous bath at temperatures between 40 and<br>
105°C, optionally at a temperature of up to 130°C under superatmospheric pressure, but<br>
preferably at 30 to 95°C, especially 45 to 65°C, in the presence or absence of customary<br>
dyeing auxiliaries.<br>
One possible procedure here is to introduce the material into the warm bath and to<br>
gradually heat the bath to the desired dyeing temperature and complete the dyeing<br>
process at that temperature. The neutral salts which accelerate the exhaustion of the dyes<br>
may also if desired only be added to the bath after the actual dyeing temperature has been<br>
reached.<br>
Padding processes likewise provide excellent color yields and a very good color buildup on<br>
cellulose fibers, the dyes being fixable in a conventional manner by batching at room<br>
temperature or elevated temperature, for example at up to 60°C, or in a continuous<br><br>
manner, for example by means of a pad- dry-pad steam process, by steaming or<br>
using dry heat.<br>
Similarly, the customary printing processes for cellulose fibers, which can be carried out in<br>
one step, for example by printing with a print paste containing sodium bicarbonate or some<br>
other acid-binding agent and by subsequent steaming at 100 to 103°C, or in two steps, for<br>
example by printing with a neutral or weakly acidic print color and then fixing either by<br>
passing the printed material through a hot electrolyte-containing alkaline bath or by<br>
overpadding with an alkaline electrolyte-containing padding liquor and subsequent<br>
batching or steaming or dry heat treatment of the alkali-overpadded material, produce<br>
strong color prints with well-defined contours and a clear white ground. The outcome of the<br>
prints is affected little, if at all, by variations in the fixing conditions.<br>
When fixing by means of dry heat in accordance with the customary thermofix processes,<br>
hot air at 120 to 200°C is used. In addition to the customary steam at 101 to 103°C, it is<br>
also possible to use superheated steam and high-pressure steam at temperatures of up to<br>
160°C.<br>
The acid-binding agents which effect the fixation of the dyes and of the dye mixtures<br>
according to the invention on the cellulose fibers are for example water-soluble basic salts<br>
of alkali metals and likewise alkaline earth metals of inorganic or organic acids or<br>
compounds which liberate alkali in the heat, and also alkali metal silicates. Especially<br>
suitable are the alkali metal hydroxides and alkali metal salts of weak to medium inorganic<br>
or organic acids, the preferred alkali metal compounds being the sodium and potassium<br>
compounds. Such acid-binding agents are for example sodium hydroxide, potassium<br>
hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium formate,<br>
sodium dihydrogenphosphate, disodium hydrogenphosphate, sodium trichloroacetate,<br>
trisodium phosphate or waterglass or mixtures thereof, for example mixtures of aqueous<br>
sodium hydroxide solution and waterglass.<br>
The present invention's dyes and dye mixtures possess excellent color strength on<br>
cellulose fiber materials when applied by dyeing and printing.<br><br>
The dyeings and prints obtainable with the dyes and dye mixtures according to the<br>
invention possess bright shades; more particularly, the dyeings and prints on cellulose<br>
fiber materials possess good lightfastness and especially good wetfastnesses, such as<br>
fastness to washing, milling, water, seawater, crossdyeing and acidic and alkaline<br>
perspiration, also good fastness to heat-setting and pleating and crocking. Furthermore,<br>
the cellulose dyeings obtained following the customary aftertreatment of rinsing to remove<br>
unfixed dye portions exhibit excellent wetfastnesses, in particular since unfixed dye<br>
portions are easily washed off because of their good solubility in cold water.<br>
Furthermore, the dye mixtures according to the invention can also be used for the fiber-<br>
reactive dyeing of wool. Moreover, wool which has been given a nonfelting or low-felting<br>
finish (cf. for example H. Rath, Lehrbuch der Textilchemie, Springer-Verlag, 3rd edition<br>
(1972), pages 295-299, especially finished by the Hercosett process (page 298); J. Soc.<br>
Dyers and Colourists 1972, 93-99, and 1975, 33-44) can be dyed to very good fastness<br>
properties. The process of dyeing on wool is here carried out in a conventional manner<br>
from an acidic medium. For instance, acetic acid and/or ammonium sulfate or acetic acid<br>
and ammonium acetate or sodium acetate can be added to the dyebath to obtain the<br>
desired pH. To obtain a dyeing of acceptable levelness, it is advisable to add a customary<br>
leveling agent, for example a leveling agent based on a reaction product of cyanuric<br>
chloride with three times the molar amount of an aminobenzenesulfonic acid and/or of an<br>
aminonaphthalenesulfonic acid or on the basis of a reaction product of for example<br>
stearylamine with ethylene oxide. For instance, the dye or the dye mixture according to the<br>
invention is preferably subjected to the exhaust process initially from an acidic dyebath<br>
having a pH of about 3.5 to 5.5 under pH control and the pH is then, toward the end of the<br>
dyeing time, shifted into the neutral and optionally weakly alkaline range up to a pH of 8.5<br>
to bring about, especially for very deep dyeings, the full reactive bond between the dyes<br>
and the fiber. At the same time, the dye portion not reactively bound is removed.<br>
The procedure described herein also applies to the production of dyeings on fiber<br>
materials composed of other natural polyamides or of synthetic polyamides and<br>
polyurethanes. In general, the material to be dyed is introduced into the bath at a<br>
temperature of about 40°C, agitated therein for some time, the dyebath is then adjusted to<br>
the desired weakly acidic, preferably weakly acetic acid, pH and the actual dyeing is<br>
carried out at a temperature between 60 and 98°C. However, the dyeings can also be<br><br>
carried out at the boil or in sealed dyeing apparatus at temperatures of up to 106°C.<br>
Since the water solubility of the dyes and dye mixtures according to the invention is very<br>
good, they can also be used with advantage in customary continuous dyeing processes.<br>
The color strength of the dyes and dye mixtures according to the invention is very high.<br>
The abovementioned dyes and dye mixtures can also be formulated into printing inks for<br>
digital textile printing.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to printing inks comprising a dye of the general<br>
formula (1) according to the present invention or a dye mixture according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
The amounts in which the present invention's dyes of the general formula (1) or the<br>
present invention's dye mixtures are present in such printing inks range for example from<br>
0.1% by weight to 50% by weight, preferably from 1% by weight to 30% by weight and<br>
more preferably from 1% by weight to 15% by weight, based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
For the inks to be used in the continuous flow process, a conductivity of 0.5 to 25 mS/m<br>
can be set by adding an electrolyte. Useful electrolytes include for example lithium nitrate<br>
and potassium nitrate.<br>
The printing inks mentioned may include organic solvents with a total content of 1-50%,<br>
preferably of 5-30% by weight based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
Examples of suitable organic solvents are alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, 1-<br>
propanol, isopropanol, 1-butanol, tert-butanol and pentyl alcohol, for example; polyhydric<br>
alcohols, such as 1,2-ethanediol, 1,2,3-propanetriol, butanediol, 1,3-butanediol,<br>
1,4-butanediol, 1,2-propanediol, 2,3-propanediol, pentanediol, 1,4-pentanediol, 1,5-<br>
pentanediol, hexanediol, D,L-1,2-hexanediol, 1,6-hexanediol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol and 1,2-<br>
octanediol, for example; polyalkylene glycols, such as polyethylene glycol and<br>
polypropylene glycol, for example; alkylene glycols having 2 to 8 alkylene groups, such as<br>
monoethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, thioglycol,<br>
thiodiglycol, butyltriglycol, hexylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol and<br>
tripropylene glycol, for example; lower alkyl ethers of polyhydric alcohols, such as ethylene<br>
glycol, monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl<br>
ether, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene<br>
glycol monobutyl ether, diethylene glycol monohexyl ether, triethylene glycol monomethyl<br><br>
ether, triethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tripropylene glycol monomethyl ether,<br>
tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether, tetraethylene glycol monobutyl ether, tetraethylene<br>
glycol dimethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl<br>

The inks may further include the customary additives, such as, for example, viscosity<br>
moderators to set viscosities in the range from 1.5 to 40.0 mPa.s in a temperature range<br>
from 20 to 50°C. Preferred inks have a viscosity of 1.5 to 20 mPas and particularly<br>
preferred inks a viscosity of 1.5 to 15 mPas.<br>
Useful viscosity moderators include Theological additives, examples being the following:<br>
polyvinylcaprolactam, polyvinylpyrrolidone and their copolymers, polyether polyol,<br>
associative thickener, polyurea, polyurethane, sodium alginates, modified<br>
galactomannans, polyetherurea, polyurethane, and nonionic cellulose ethers.<br><br>
As further additions the inks mentioned may include surface-active substances to set<br>
surface tensions of 20 to 65 mN/m, which are adapted where appropriate as a function of<br>
the process used (thermal or piezo technology).<br>
Useful surface-active substances include, for example, surfactants of all kinds, preferably<br>
nonionic surfactants, butyldiglycol and 1,2-hexanediol.<br>
The inks mentioned may further include customary additions, such as substances for<br>
preventing fungal and bacterial growth, for example, in amounts of 0.01% to 1% by weight,<br>
based on the total weight of the ink.<br>
The inks mentioned may be prepared in a conventional manner by mixing the components<br>
in water.<br>
The inks mentioned are useful for use in inkjet printing processes for printing a wide<br>
variety of pretreated materials, such as silk, leather, wool, polyamide fibers and<br>
polyurethanes, and especially cellulosic fiber materials of any kind. Examples of fiber<br>
materials of this kind include the natural cellulose fibers, such as cotton, linen and hemp,<br>
and pulp and regenerated cellulose. The present invention's inks are also useful for<br>
printing pretreated hydroxyl- or amino-containing fibers present in the blend fabrics,<br>
examples being blends of cotton, silk or wool with polyester fibers or polyamide fibers.<br>
In contrast to conventional textile printing, where the printing ink already contains all the<br>
fixing chemicals and thickeners for a reactive dye, in inkjet printing the assistants have to<br>
be applied to the textile substrate in a separate pretreatment step.<br>
The pretreatment of the textile substrate, such as cellulose fibers and regenerated<br>
cellulose fibers, and also silk and wool, for example, takes place prior to printing, using an<br>
aqueous alkaline liquor. The fixing of reactive dyes requires alkali, such as sodium<br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium acetate, trisodium phosphate, sodium silicate or<br>
sodium hydroxide, alkali donors such as, for example, sodium chloroacetate or sodium<br>
formate, hydrotropic substances such as, for example, urea, reduction inhibitors, such as,<br>
for example, sodium nitrobenzenesulfonates, and also thickeners to prevent the motifs<br>
flowing when the printing ink is applied. The latter are, for example, sodium alginates,<br>
modified polyacrylates or highly etherified galactomannans.<br>
These pretreatment reagents are applied uniformly to the textile substrate in a defined<br><br>
amount using suitable applicators, examples being a 2- or 3-roll padder, using<br>
contactless spraying technologies, by means of foam application, or using appropriately<br>
adapted inkjet technologies, and are subsequently dried. Printing is followed by drying of<br>
the textile fiber material at 120 to 150°C and then by fixing.<br>
The fixing of the inkjet prints can be carried out at room temperature or with saturated<br>
steam, with superheated steam, with hot air, with microwaves, with infrared radiation, with<br>
laser or electron beams or with other suitable energy transfer techniques.<br>
A distinction is made between one- and two-phase fixing operations. In one-phase fixing<br>
the necessary fixing chemicals are already on the textile substrate. In the case of two-<br>
phase fixing this pretreatment is unnecessary. Fixing requires only alkali, which is applied<br>
following inkjet printing and before the fixing operation, without drying in between. There is<br>
no need for further additions such as urea or thickener.<br>
Fixing is followed by print aftertreatment, which is the prerequisite for good fastnesses,<br>
high brilliance and an immaculate white ground.<br>
The prints prepared with the inks mentioned, especially on cellulose fiber materials,<br>
possess a high color strength and a high fiber-dye bond stability not only in the acidic, but<br>
also in the alkaline range, and also possess good light fastness and very good wet<br>
fastness properties, such as fastness to washing, water, seawater, crossdyeing and<br>
perspiration, and also good fastness to heat setting and pleating, and crocking.<br>
The examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention. Parts and percentages are by<br>
weight unless noted otherwise. The relationship of parts by weight to parts by volume is<br>
that of the kilogram to the liter. The compounds described by formula in the examples are<br>
written in the form of the sodium salts, since they are generally prepared and isolated in<br>
the form of their salts, preferably sodium or potassium salts, and are used in the form of<br>
their salts for coloring. The starting compounds specified in the examples especially table<br>
examples below can be used for synthesis in the form of the free acid or likewise in the<br>
form of their salts, preferably alkali metal salts, such as sodium or potassium salts.<br>
Example 1<br>
A suspension of 800 parts of water and 114 parts of the monoazo compound of the<br>
formula (11) where M is sodium, is adjusted to a pH of 5 with sodium carbonate. 36.9 parts<br><br>
of cyanuric chloride are then introduced and the batch is stirred at room temperature for<br>
2 hours while maintaining the pH at 5.5 to 6.0 with sodium carbonate. To complete the<br>
reaction, the batch is heated to 35-40°C and subsequently stirred at pH 5.5-6.0 for 90<br>
minutes.<br>
The suspension obtained is admixed with 81.22 parts of a neutral 35% solution of<br>
N-methyltaurine. The batch is subsequently stirred at 50-60°C for 8 hours while the pH is<br>
maintained at 5-6 by addition of sodium carbonate.<br>
The as-synthesized solution is worked up to obtain the electrolyte-containing compound of<br>
the formula (1a)<br><br>
which has very good dye properties and when applied and fixed by the methods<br>
customary for fiber-reactive dyes provides strong reddish yellow dyeings and prints of<br>
good light- and wetfastness properties on cotton for example. The high color strengths of<br>
these dyeings is particularly notable.<br>
Example 2<br>
A solution, adjusted to pH 7 with sodium carbonate, of 2000 parts of water and 114 parts<br>
of the monoazo compound of the formula (11) where M is sodium is admixed with<br>
40.5 parts of cyanuric fluoride at 0°C in the course of 20 minutes. The pH is allowed to<br>
drop to 6 and is maintained at 6 by addition of sodium carbonate. The batch is<br>
subsequently stirred for 20 minutes.<br>
Then, 81.2 parts of a neutral 35% aqueous solution of N-methyltaurine are added<br>
dropwise. The batch is subsequently stirred at pH 6.5 for 4 hours during which it is slowly<br>
allowed to warm to room temperature.<br>
The as-synthesized solution is worked up to obtain the electrolyte-containing compound of<br>
the formula (1b)<br><br><br>
which has very good dye properties and when applied and fixed by the methods<br>
customary for fiber-reactive dyes provides strong reddish yellow dyeings and prints of<br>
good light- and wetfastness properties on cotton for example. The high color strengths of<br>
these dyeings is particularly notable.<br>
Example 3<br>
1000 parts of an aqueous as-synthesized solution comprising 84 parts of the dye of the<br>
formula (1a) and 1000 parts of an aqueous as-synthesized solution comprising 91 parts of<br>
the dye of the formula (2a)<br><br>
are mixed together. The dye mixture of the present invention is isolated in a molar mixing<br>
ratio of dye (1 a) to dye (2a) of 50:50 from the combined solution by spray-drying the dye<br>
solution. The dye mixture obtained, which contains electrolyte salts, such as sodium<br>
chloride and sodium sulfate from the synthesis, has very good dyeing properties and<br>
provides for example on cellulosic fiber materials, such as cotton, or regenerated cellulose<br>
fibers in an exhaust dyeing process customary for fiber-reactive dyes level yellow dyeings<br>
possessing a very high color strength.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
1000 parts of an aqueous as-synthesized solution comprising 168 parts of the dye of the<br>
formula (1a) and 1000 parts of an aqueous as-synthesized solution comprising 105 parts<br>
of the dye of the formula (3a)<br><br>
are mixed together and the dye mixture obtained is isolated by spray-drying the dye<br>
solution. The dye mixture obtained, which contains electrolyte salts, such as sodium<br>
chloride and sodium sulfate from the synthesis has a molar mixing ratio of dye (1a) to dye<br>
(3a) of 50:50 and has very good dyeing properties and provides for example on cellulosic<br>
fiber materials, such as cotton, or regenerated cellulose fibers in an exhaust dyeing<br>
process customary for fiber-reactive dyes level yellow dyeings possessing a very high<br>
color strength.<br>
Example 5<br>
800 parts of an aqueous solution comprising 40 parts of the dye of the formula (2b)<br><br>
and 700 parts of an aqueous solution comprising 49 parts of the dye of the formula (1b)<br>
are mixed together. A dye mixture is isolated in a molar mixing ratio of dye (2b) to dye (1b)<br>
of 40:60 from the combined solution by spray-drying the dye solution. The dye mixture<br>
obtained, which contains electrolyte salts, such as sodium chloride and sodium sulfate<br>
from the synthesis, has very good dyeing properties and provides for example on cellulosic<br>
fiber materials, such as cotton, or regenerated cellulose fibers in an exhaust dyeing<br>
process customary for fiber-reactive dyes level yellow dyeings possessing a very high<br>
color strength.<br>
