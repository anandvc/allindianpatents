				<td>SPEED CONTROL FOR COMPRESSORS<br>
The present invention concerns some improvements to<br>
compressors.<br>
In particular, the present invention concerns a compressor<br>
for compressing gases of the type comprising at least one<br>
compressor element with a gas outlet and a gas inlet, as<br>
well as a sensor to determine the outlet temperature in the<br>
gas outlet, a sensor to determine the rotational speed of<br>
the compressor element, a motor with an electronically<br>
adjustable speed driving this compressor element, and<br>
finally a control device for said motor.<br>
It is known that such compressors can operate within a<br>
specific maximum speed range of the number of revolutions,<br>
between a maximum and a minimum number of revolutions which<br>
depends among others on the mechanical limitations of the<br>
rotating parts, whereby irrevocable damage can be caused to<br>
the compressor in case the number of revolutions exceeds<br>
said speed range.<br>
The speed range is usually characterised by the ratio<br>
between the maximum number of revolutions and the minimum<br>
number of revolutions, whereby the value of this ratio is<br>
typically situated around 3.2.<br>
It is also known that a further restriction of the speed<br>
range is imposed by a phenomenon caused by a drastic output<br>
reduction of a compressor in the high and low speed range,<br>
as a result of which, as the rotational speed of the<br>
compressor comes closer to the aforesaid maximum or<br>
minimum number of revolutions, the temperature of the<br>
compressed gas can raise to such an extent that the<br>
coatings of the compressor element and of the downstream<br>
parts of the compressor may be damaged by the heat- In<br>
practice, this occurs when the temperature on the outlet of<br>
the compressor element exceeds an admitted maximum critical<br>
threshold value of 260 to 265°C.<br>
In order to restrict the influence of the output reduction<br>
and to prevent the temperature on the outlet of the<br>
compressor element from rising above the aforesaid<br>
threshold value, it is important to further restrict the<br>
above-mentioned admitted speed range, all the more when the<br>
circumstances having an influence on the temperature rise<br>
are more adverse, namely in case of high ambient<br>
temperatures, when the finishing quality of a new<br>
compressor is not so good, in case of increasing wear of a<br>
used compressor and the like.<br>
Compressors of the above-mentioned type are already known<br>
which are equipped with a fixed speed limiter, in<br>
particular a speed limiter with a fixed minimum and maximum<br>
threshold value for the rotational speed, whereby the most<br>
adverse circumstances are taken as a basis to determine<br>
said fixed threshold values, namely for a compressor with a<br>
minimum production quality, a certain degree of wear and<br>
operating at a maximum admitted ambient temperature.<br>
A disadvantage of such known compressors with a fixed speed<br>
limiter is that the set speed range which is determined on<br>
the basis of a worst case scenario, assuming the most<br>
adverse circumstances, is in fact too restricting for<br>
circumstances which are less adverse, such as for example<br>
in case of lower temperatures, allowing in principle for a<br>
higher speed range without exceeding the aforesaid critical<br>
threshold value of the temperature on the outlet of the<br>
compressor element. This implies that the capacity of such<br>
a compressor cannot be used to the full as far as the<br>
delivered gas flow is concerned in circumstances which<br>
deviate from the aforesaid worst case scenario.<br>
In practice, such known compressors have a speed range with<br>
a maximum/minimum rotational speed ratio in the order of<br>
magnitude of 2.4, whereas, under favourable conditions, a<br>
speed range of 3.2 would be possible.<br>
The present invention aims to remedy the above-mentioned<br>
and other disadvantages by providing a compressor with a<br>
dynamic speed limiter which automatically maximizes the<br>
speed range of the compressor as a function of the<br>
operational circumstances, irrespective of the state and<br>
condition the compressor is in.<br>
To this aim, the invention concerns an improvement to a<br>
compressor of the above-mentioned type which consists in<br>
that the compressor is provided with a dynamic speed<br>
limiter with what is called a hysteresis module, coupled to<br>
the above-mentioned control device of the motor and to the<br>
above-mentioned sensors for the outlet temperature and the<br>
rotational speed, whereby a hysteresis upper temperature<br>
limit has been defined in this hysteresis module, as well<br>
as an admitted maximum speed range which is determined by a<br>
minimum rotational speed and a maximum rotational speed and<br>
whereby, as soon as the measured outlet temperature reaches<br>
the ' specified hysteresis upper temperature limit, the<br>
actual rotational speed of the compressor element is either<br>
lowered with a speed jump DS when the measured rotational<br>
speed is situated in the high speed range close to the<br>
maximum rotational speed, or is increased with a speed jump<br>
DS when the measured rotational speed is situated in the<br>
low speed range close to the minimum rotational speed.<br>
Thanks to the dynamic speed limiter according to the<br>
invention, when the aforesaid hysteresis upper temperature<br>
limit is reached, which preferably is somewhat lower, for<br>
example 2°C lower than the admitted maximum critical<br>
threshold value of the outlet temperature, the rotational<br>
speed will automatically be adjusted in the right sense in<br>
order to make the outlet temperature decrease.<br>
In this manner, the speed restriction is not determined by<br>
a worst case scenario, but under certain favourable<br>
circumstances, for example in case of low ambient<br>
temperatures, the rotational speed of the compressor will<br>
cover the entire speed range which is determined by the<br>
limitations of the rotating parts, such that the entire<br>
available capacity of the compressor as far as the gas<br>
output is concerned can be used completely. Should the<br>
circumstances become worse, for example when the ambient<br>
temperature rises, the speed range is automatically<br>
adjusted as soon as the outlet temperature reaches the<br>
aforesaid critical threshold value, such that this<br>
threshold value can never be exceeded, not even in case of<br>
increasing wear of the compressor.<br>
In the hysteresis module is preferably also defined a<br>
hysteresis lower temperature limit whereby, as soon as the<br>
measured outlet temperature reaches the specified<br>
hysteresis lower temperature limit, the entire aforesaid<br>
admitted maximum speed range becomes available again.<br>
This offers the advantage that when the operational<br>
conditions of the compressor become more favourable, as a<br>
result of which the temperature on the outlet of the<br>
compressor element decreases, the capacity of the<br>
compressor can be used to the full again.<br>
The invention also concerns a method for compressing a gas<br>
whereby a compressor according to the invention is applied.<br>
As the operation of the compressor is optimized, there will<br>
be less unwanted failures of the compressor.<br>
In order to better explain the characteristics of the<br>
invention, the following preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention is described as an example only without being<br>
limitative in any way, with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings, in which:<br>
figure 1 represents the outlet temperature of a<br>
conventional compressor as a function of the<br>
rotational speed of the compressor;<br>
figure 2 represents the outlet temperature of a<br>
conventional compressor in the highest speed range of<br>
the compressor;<br>
figure 3 represents a module of a speed regulation<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Figure 1 shows the temperature curve TO of the compressed<br>
gas on the outlet of the compressor element of a<br>
conventional compressor as a function of the number of<br>
revolutions S of the compressor, such for an admitted<br>
maximum speed range which is limited by an admitted minimum<br>
rotational speed SMIN and an admitted maximum rotational<br>
speed SMAX, whereby SMIN and SMAX (are determined among<br>
others by the limits of the rotating parts.<br>
Figure 1 shows three outlet temperature curves, F1, F2 and<br>
F3 respectively, represented for three different ambient<br>
temperatures, namely a low temperature T1, a higher<br>
temperature T2 and a still higher temperature T3.<br>
As can be clearly derived from this figure 1, each curve<br>
F1-F2-F3 has an almost flat middle part 1 with an "almost<br>
constant outlet temperature for an ambient temperature that<br>
remains the same and two steeper parts, a part 2 in the<br>
high speed range of the compressor close to SMAX and a part<br>
3 in the lower speed range close to SMIN respectively.<br>
The parts 2 and 3 clearly illustrate the phenomenon whereby<br>
the compressor output strongly decreases and, consequently,<br>
the outlet temperature TO strongly increases, when the<br>
number of revolutions in the high speed range increases,<br>
decreases in the low speed range respectively.<br>
The above-mentioned curves F1-F2-F3 are also a function of<br>
other parameters, such as among others the operational<br>
pressure, the finishing degree of a new compressor, the<br>
wear of a used compressor, whereby the curves shift upward<br>
for a compressor with a finishing that is less good or for<br>
a compressor which is more worn.<br>
In order to keep the argumentation simple, we will assume<br>
hereafter that the latter parameters remain constant.<br>
In figure 1 is also indicated the critical threshold value<br>
TMAX of the outlet temperature TO above which the<br>
compressor must be stopped in order to prevent the coatings<br>
on the compressor element and on the downstream parts of<br>
the compressor to become damaged due to the excessive heat<br>
of the compressed gases.<br>
It is clear that, because of this temperature threshold<br>
TMAX, the admitted speed range of the compressor at an<br>
ambient temperature Tl is limited by a lower threshold<br>
value OG1 and an upper threshold value BGl. For the higher<br>
temperatures T2 and T3, the admitted speed range of the<br>
compressor is smaller and will be situated between OG2 and<br>
0G3 respectively, and between BG2 and BG3 respectively.<br>
With the known compressors, the most adverse situation at<br>
the highest admitted ambient temperature T3 is taken as a<br>
basis to determine the fixed speed range, and the fixed<br>
speed range is set between the corresponding lower and<br>
higher threshold values 0G3 and BG3.<br>
As opposed to such a conventional compressor with a fixed<br>
speed range OG3-BG3, a compressor according to the<br>
invention is provided with a dynamic speed limiter<br>
comprising a hysteresis module in which a hysteresis upper<br>
temperature limit HMAX is defined which is preferably 2°C<br>
lower than TMAX and whereby, as soon as the measured outlet<br>
temperature TO reaches the specified hysteresis upper<br>
temperature limit, the actual rotational speed of the<br>
compressor element is either lowered with an adjustable<br>
speed jump DS when the measured rotational speed is<br>
situated in the higher speed range, or is increased with a<br>
speed jump DS when the measured rotational speed is<br>
situated in the lower speed range.<br>
The working principle of a compressor with a dynamic speed<br>
limiter according to the invention is simple and will be<br>
illustrated hereafter by means of figure 2 representing a<br>
number of outlet temperature curves in the higher speed<br>
range of the compressor, such at different temperatures<br>
between 32°C and 40°C.<br>
If, for example, starting from a situation A at an ambient<br>
temperature of 34 °C and a number of revolutions SA, the<br>
ambient temperature gradually rises to 39°C, the number of<br>
revolutions of the compressor will first remain unchanged,<br>
and the outlet temperature TO will gradually rise up to the<br>
point where the operational point B reaches the hysteresis<br>
upper temperature limit HMAX and the hysteresis module<br>
instantly reduces the number of revolutions of the<br>
compressor according to the invention with a speed jump DS,<br>
as a result of which the operational point is immediately-<br>
shifted to a point C, after which, when the ambient<br>
temperature rises still further, the outlet temperature<br>
will rise again at a constant number of revolutions SC<br>
until the upper temperature limit HMAX is reached again in<br>
point D and the hysteresis module applies an additional<br>
speed adjustment with a jump DS, such that the operational<br>
point immediately shifts to point E and afterwards, when<br>
the temperature rises still further to 39°C, will move<br>
further to point F on the curve F39 at a constant<br>
rotational speed SE.<br><br>
It is clear that the threshold value TMAX of the outlet<br>
temperature will never be reached in this case, and that<br>
the speed limits are automatically adjusted to less<br>
favourable circumstances, such as for example a higher<br>
ambient temperature, such that the speed limits must not be<br>
unnecessarily restricted, as is the case with conventional<br>
compressors, to a much smaller speed range, dictated by a<br>
hypothetical worst case situation.<br>
According to the invention, also a hysteresis lower<br>
temperature limit HMIN is defined in the hysteresis module<br>
whereby, as soon as the measured outlet temperature TO<br>
reaches this lower temperature limit HMIN, the actual<br>
rotational speed of the compressor element is either<br>
increased when the measured rotational speed is situated in<br>
the highest speed range, or it is lowered when the measured<br>
rotational speed is situated in the lowest speed range.<br>
The hysteresis module will preferably be configured such<br>
that, as soon as the measured outlet temperature TO reaches<br>
the hysteresis lower temperature limit HMIN, the entire<br>
above-mentioned admitted maximum speed range between SMIN<br>
and SMAX becomes available again.<br>
If, starting from the preceding operational point F, the<br>
ambient temperature decreases to for example 32°C, the<br>
number of revolutions SE will at first remain constant and<br>
the outlet temperature TO will drop until HMIN is reached,<br>
and the hysteresis module will make an upward adjustment of<br>
the rotational speed of the compressor according to the<br>
invention until the admitted maximum number of revolutions<br>
SMAX and thus a maximum delivery is reached in the<br>
operational point H on the curve F32, or until the upper<br>
temperature limit HMAX is reached should this occur any<br>
sooner.<br>
A similar regulation principle occurs in the lowest speed<br>
range of the compressor close to the minimum rotational<br>
speed SMIN, whereby the speed is now each time increased<br>
with a speed jump DS when the hysteresis upper temperature<br>
limit HMAX is reached. This means that the delivery<br>
pressure of the compressor will rise up to an automatic<br>
idle condition and possibly to an automatic stop/restart<br>
mode of the compressor, without switching to an unwanted<br>
stop mode with alarm and manual re-start. In other words,<br>
the speed at which the compressor runs idle is adjusted as<br>
a function of the ambient temperature and the condition of<br>
the compressor.<br>
The above-mentioned speed jump DS is preferably set such<br>
that a resulting decrease of the outlet temperature TO is<br>
always smaller than the difference between the hysteresis<br>
upper temperature limit HMAX and the hysteresis lower<br>
temperature limit HMIN in order to avoid cyclic instable<br>
behaviour of the rotational speed of the compressor.<br>
The outlet temperature TO is measured at a certain<br>
frequency, for example once in a minute.<br>
In case of a sudden rise of the ambient temperature, this<br>
measuring frequency may be too low in order to be able to<br>
adjust the speed range sufficiently fast. That is why, when<br>
the measured outlet temperature TO is still higher than the<br>
hysteresis upper temperature limit HMAX after a speed<br>
adjustment with a jump DS, the measuring frequency will be<br>
raised, such that the hysteresis module can react faster<br>
and possibly with several successive jumps DS until the<br>
outlet temperature drops below HMAX.<br>
The dynamic speed limiter is preferably provided with<br>
safety devices, for example in order to prevent that the<br>
speed exceeds an admitted maximum speed SMAX and/or in<br>
order to prevent that the speed drops below an admitted<br>
minimum speed SMIN and/or in order to prevent that the<br>
admitted maximum temperature is exceeded during a certain<br>
time, etc.<br>
The dynamic speed limiter is preferably programmed in order<br>
to obtain an almost optimal operation of the compressor<br>
with a speed range larger than 2.5, preferably between 2.7<br>
and 3.5, and it can be adjusted such that at least the<br>
admitted maximum temperature can be set, preferably between<br>
150°C and 350°C, better still between 200°C and 300°C.<br>
Figure 3 schematically shows a dynamic speed limiter<br>
according to the invention.<br>
This speed limiter comprises:<br>
- a means 10 for receiving a signal from the temperature<br>
sensor;<br>
- a means 11 for receiving a signal from the rotational<br>
speed sensor of the compressor;<br>
- a control device 12 for regulating the speed of the<br>
motor which drives the rotating element of the<br>
compressor, for example as a function of the load of<br>
the compressor element, within a specified maximum<br>
speed range (SMIN-SMAX), determined by limitations on<br>
the rotating parts;<br>
- a hysteresis module 13 for adjusting the speed as a<br>
function of the signals (outlet temperature TO and<br>
number of revolutions S) of the means 10 and the means<br>
11, whereby this hysteresis module 13 may have a<br>
memory with possibly a number of outlet temperature<br>
curves and/or whereby this hysteresis module 1.3 may be<br>
programmed in the control device 12;<br>
- a safety means 14 to stop the compressor, for example<br>
as soon as the outlet temperature TO exceeds a maximum<br>
temperature;<br>
- a memory 15 for a minimum speed, whereby this minimum<br>
speed is used as the initial speed to set the<br>
compressor back to work after it has run idle, and<br>
whereby this minimum speed corresponds to the minimum<br>
speed after the last speed adjustment by the<br>
hysteresis module 13 in the lower rotational speed<br>
range of the compressor or with a minimum speed of<br>
1500 to 2000 revolutions per minute (the minimum speed<br>
may also be a speed which is higher than the latter<br>
minimum speed, for example which is 10 to 30% higher<br>
than the latter minimum speed, with a minimum of 1750<br>
revolutions per minute) . The memory also contains the<br>
speed values which define the lower, higher speed zone<br>
respectively (SMIN - K and L - SMAX) where the dynamic<br>
speed adjustment applies. In the intermediate speed<br>
zone, the control does not apply. As soon as the<br>
outlet temperature TO reaches the HMAX value is<br>
determined in what speed zone the actual speed is<br>
situated, in order to thus implement the required<br>
speed adjustment, i.e. a speed increase, a speed<br>
decrease respectively, depending on whether the speed<br>
is situated in the lower speed zone (SMIN - K) , the<br>
higher speed zone (L — SMAX) respectively.<br>

10. An improved compressor with a dynamic speed limiter<br>
according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the above-<br>
mentioned control device for the motor is provided with at least<br>
one safety device in order 10 prevent extreme conditions (SMAX).<br>
11. An improved compressor with a dynamic speed limiter<br>
according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the dynamic<br>
speed limiter is programmed in order to obtain an almost<br>
optimal operation of the compressor with a speed range larger<br>
than 2.5, preferably between 2.7 and 3.5.<br>
12. An improved compresser with a dynamic speed limiter<br>
according to any of the preceding claims, wherein the dynamic<br>
speed limiter can be adjusted such that at least the admitted<br>
maximum temperature cur be set, preferably between 150°C<br>
and 350°C, better still between 200°C and 300°C.<br>
13. Method for compressing gas by means of a compressor showing<br>
improvements according to any of the preceding claims.<br>
14. Dynamic speed limiter or hysteresis module (13) belonging to it<br>
as described in any of claims 1 to 12 included.<br>
15. Dynamic speed limiter which is suitable for a dynamic<br>
regulation of a compressor according to any of claims 1 to 12<br>
included, whereby the speed limiter comprises a hysteresis<br>
module 13 with a memory for possible outlet<br>
temperature curves representing the outlet temperature TO<br>
as a function of the rotational speed (S) and whereby a<br>
hysteresis upper and lower temperature limit (HMIN and<br>
HMAX) have been set in the hysteresis module (13) , as well<br>
as a speed jump (DS) for the rotational speed (S) , either<br>
or not adjustable, when the above-mentioned upper and/or<br>
lower temperature limit (HMIN, HMAX) is reached.<br>
16. Dynamic speed limiter according to claim 15,<br>
characterised in that it comprises a memory to determine<br>
whether the rotational speed (5) of the compressor is<br>
situated in the lower speed range (SMIN - K), or in the<br>
higher speed range (L - SMAX) in order to thus realise the<br>
correct speed adjustment, a speed increase or a speed drop<br>
respectively, when the upper temperature limit (HMAX) is<br>
reached.<br>
17. Dynamic speed limiter according to claim 15 or 16,<br>
characterised in that it comprises a memory (15) to carry<br>
out an automatic re-start at the same speed as when the<br>
compressor was running idle before.<br><br>
This invention relates to an improved compressor with a dynamic speed<br>
limiter, which consists in that, as soon as the measured outlet<br>
temperature (TO) reaches a certain hysteresis upper temperature limit<br>
(HMAX), the actual rotational speed of the compressor element is either<br>
lowered with a speed jump (DS) when the measured rotational speed is<br>
situated in the higher speed range close to the maximum rotational<br>
speed (SMAX), or is increased with a speed jump (DS) when the<br>
measured rotational speed is situated in the lower speed range close to<br>
the minimum rotational speed (SMIN)<br></td>
