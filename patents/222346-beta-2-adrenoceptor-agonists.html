(ii) reducing a compound of formula<br><br><br><br><br>
where Ar', R R\ R1, R\ R and R' are as hereinbefore defined, to convert the indicated keto oup into -CH(OH)-; or<br>
(b) for the preparation of a compound where R' is hydrogen, reducing a corresponding compound of formula I where R is hydroxy; or<br>
{c) for the preparation of a compound of formula I where R is alkoxy, either (i) O-alkylating a corresponding compound of formula I where R' is hydroxy or (li) reacting a corresponding compound having a leaving moiety instead of R' with an alcohol of formula R'H where R' is alkoxy;<br>
and, optionally, converting a resultant compound of formula I in protected form into a corresponding compoimd in unprotected form;<br>
and recovering the resultant compoimd of formula I in free or salt or solvate form.<br>
Process variant (a)(i) may be carried out using known procedures for epoxide-amine reactions. It is conveniently carried out without a solvent or in an inert solvent, for example<br><br>
a hydrocarbon such as toluene or an alcohol such as n-butanol. The reaction temperature is conveniendy from 25°C to 200"C, preferably from 80°C to 150°C. The temperature may be achieved by conventional heating or by microwave irradiation.<br>
Process variant (a)(ii) may be carried out using conventional methods, for example by reaction with sodium borohydride under conventional conditions.<br>
Process variant {b} may be carried out using known procedures for reduction of secondary alcohols to hydrocarbons. Process variant (c)(i) may be carried out using known procedures for O-alkylation, for example by reaction with an alkylating agent such as an alkyl halide under known conditions. Process variant (c)(ii) may be effected using known procedures for benzylic displacement reactions, the leaving moiety being e.g. tosylate, mesylate, halogen or hydroxy.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free form may be converted into salt or solvate forms, and vice versa, in a conventional manner.<br>
Compounds of the invention can be recovered from the reaction mixture and purified in a conventional manner. Isomers, such as enantiomers, may be obtained in a conventional manner, e.g. by fractional crystallization or asymmetric synthesis from corresponding asymmetrically substituted, e.g. optically active, starting materials.<br>
Compounds of formula XVI are known compounds or can be prepared by processes<br>
analogous to those used for the preparation of the known compounds, for example the<br>
procedures described in Journal of Medicinal Chemistry 1987, 30, 1S63-1566. Compounds<br>
of foimula XVI in which the carbon atom indicated by the asterisk 1 is chiral may be<br>
prepared from a compound of formula<br>
1<br>
Ar1	CH	CH	L	XIX<br>

where Ar' and R are as hereinbefore defined, using conventional procedures, such as those used in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
Compounds of formula XX are known or may be prepared by methods analogous to those used for the preparation of known compounds, for example those used in the Examples hereinafter.<br>
Compoimds of formula XVII are known or may be prepared by methods analogous to those used for the preparation of the known compounds. R as an aminc-protective group in formula XVH may be a known such group, for example as described in Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, T.W.Greene, P.G.M. Wuts, John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc, Second Edition, 1991, preferably benzy! or trifluoroacetyl.<br>
For example, compounds of fotmula XVH, where R is hydrogen, may be prepared by reducing an oxime of formula<br><br><br>
.4<br><br>
where R1, R, R1, R' and n are as hereinbefore defined. The reduction may be carried out by conventional methods for reducing oximes to amines. For example, the reduction may be carried out by catalytic hydrogenation, preferably using palladium on charcoal as the catalyst. The hydrogenation may be effected using known procedures, for example as described byRX). Sindclar etal, J. Med. Chem. (1982), 25(7), 858-864. Oximes of formula XXI may be prepared as described by Sindclar et al, op.cit., or by analogous procedures.<br>
Compoimds of formula XVII where R1 and R are hydrogen can be prepared by reacting a compound of formula<br><br><br>
where R1, R3, R2, R11 and n are as hereinbefore defined. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a catalyst such as tris(triphenyIphosphine)rhodium chloride. The reaction temperature may be, for example, from 60 to HO'C. The reaction is conveniently carried out in an inert solvent, for example ethanol, when the reaction temperature is conveniently about the reflux temperature of the solvent. The reaction may be carried out using known procedures, for example as described in WO96/23760. Where R1 and R1 are trialkylsilyl, the reaction between riie compounds of formulae XXE and XXDI may be carried out in the presence of a metal carbonyl complex catalyst, for example using the procedure described by K.P.C. Vollhardt and R. Hillard, J.Am.Chem. Soc. 1977, 99(12), 4058, or an analogous procedure. Compounds of formula XXII may be prepared as described in WO96/23760 or by analogous procedures. Compounds of formula XXHI are known or may be prepared by known procedures.<br>
Compounds of formula XVH where R' is alkyl, particularly methyl, and n is 1 may be prepared by amination of the corresponding 2-alkyl-indan-l-one using ammonia and KsFeCNfi, e.g. by the procedure of Fornum and Carlson, Synthesis 1972, 191.<br>

In particular, preferred intermediates of formula XVH are novel where (i) R1 and R1 are each hydrogen and R' and R1 are either each C2-C4-alkyl, Q-Q-alkoxy, Ci-Q-alkoxy-C-Q-alkyl or R1 and R"1 together denote -(CH:),- or -0(CH2)tO- where s is 1 to 4 and t is 1 or 2; or (ii) R1 and R1 are each Ci-Ct-alkyl or C2-C4-alkoxy and R1 and R1 are either each hydrogen, C]-C4-alkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy and R1 and R1are either each hydrogen, Ci-C4-alkyl, Ci-C4-alkoxy, or Cj-Q-alkoxy-C,-C4-alkyl or R1 and R1 together denote -(CHa).- or -0(CH2),O- where s is 1 to 4 and t is 1 or 2.<br><br>
Compounds of formula XVni are novel compounds which may be prepared by reaction of a compound of formula<br>
Ar'	CO	Hal	XXIV<br>
where Ar' is as hereinbefore defined and Hal is a halogen atom, preferably chlorine or bromine, with a compound of formula XVn as hereinbefore defined. The reaction may be carried out using conventional procedures, for example those described by Yoshizaki et al, J. Med. Chem (1976), 19(9), 1138-42.<br>
Where desired, the protection of any reactive group may be carried out at any appropriate stage in the above processes. The protecting group is suitably one used conventionally in the art and may be introduced and removed using conventional procedure. For example, when a hydroxy group in Ar' is protected by a benzyl group, the latter may be removed by catalytic hydrogenation in the presence of palladium on charcoal using conventional procedures, such as those used hereinafter in the Examples.<br>
Compounds of formula I in free, salt or solvate form are useful as pharmaceuticals. Accordingly the invention also provides a compound of formula I in free, salt or solvate form for use as a pharmaceutical. The compounds of formula I in free, salt or solvate form, hereinafter referred to alternatively as "agents of the invention", have good P2-adrenoreceptor agonist activity. The p2 agonist activity, onset of action and duration of action of the agents of the invention may be tested using the guinea pig tracheal stip in vitro assay according to the procedure of R.A. Coleman and A.T. Nials, J.Pharmacol. Methods (1989), 21(1), 71-86. The binding potency and selectivity for the p2-adrenoreceptor relative to the pl-adrenoreceptor can be measured by a classical filtration binding assay according to the procedure of Current Protocols in Pharmacology (S.J.Enna(editor-in-chief) et al, John Wiley &amp; Son, Inc, 1998), or by cAMP determination in cells expressing p2- or pi-adrenoceptor, according to the procedure of B. January et al, British J. Pharmacol. 123: 701-711 (1998).<br>
The agents of the invention commonly have a rapid onset of action and have a prolonged stimulating action on the P2-adrcnoreceptor, compounds of the Examples hercinbclow having Ki (P2) values of the order of 0.1 to 1000 nM, having durations of action of the<br><br>
order of 1 to greater than 12 hours, and having binding sclectivites for the P2-adrenoreceptor relative to the pl-adrenoreceptor from 1.5 to 500. For example, the compounds of Examples 1,2,4,5, 6, 8  and   27   have p2 and pi binding potencies, measured by cAMP determination in cells expressing p2- and pi- adrenoreceptors, represented by EC50 values 02/pl) (in nM) of 0.92/9.52, 0.23/1.25, 6.07/14.5, 0.79/6.10, 0.3/3.60,0.57/8.46 and 0.012/0.5 respectively. The compounds of Examples 2,4,5,27 and 29 have T(50%) times (in minutes) of &gt;400 at 71nM concentration, 82 at 100 nM, 444 at lOOnM, 222 at l.OnM and 279 at lOnM respectively in the guinea pig tracheal strip assay, where T(50%) is the time for inhibition of contraction to decay to 50% of its maximum value.<br>
Having regard to their ^2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of any condition which is prevented or alleviated by activation of the ^2-adrenoreceptor. In view of their loi^ acting selective p2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are useful in the relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and the relief of bronchoconstricdon. Relief of bronchoconstriction can be measured in models such as the in vivo plethysmt^aphy models of Chong et al, J. Pharmacol.Toxicol. Methods 1998, 39, 163-168, Hammelmann et al, Am. J. Rcspir. Crit. Care Med., 1997,156, 766-775 and analogous models. The agents of the invention are therefore useful in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases. In view of their long duration of action, it is possible to administer the agents of the invention once-a-<iay in the treatment of such diseases. another aspect invention commonly exhibit characteristics indicating a low incidence side effects encountered with p2 as tachycardia tremor and resdessness agents accordingly being suitable for use on demand well prophylactic obstructive or inflammatory airways></iay>
Treatment of a disease in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic treatment. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed ot di^oosable as "wheezy in^ts", an established patient category of nmjor medical concern and now often identified as incipient<br><br>
or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti¬inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping".  "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary or airways disease (COPD or COAD), including chronic bronchitis, or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis (an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their p2 agonist activity, the agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of a condition requiring relaxation of smooth muscle of the uterus or vascular system. They arc thus useful for the prevention or alleviation of premature labour pains in pre^ancy. They are also useful in the treatment of chronic and acute urticaria, psoriasis, allergic conjunctivitis, actinitis, hay fever, and mastocytosis.<br><br>
The agents of the invention are also useful as co-therapeutic agents for use in conjunction with anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory drug substances, particularly in the treatment of obstructive or inflammatory airways diseases such as those mentioned hereinbefore, for example as potentiators of therapeutic activity of such drugs or as a means of reducing required dosaging or potential side effects of such dru^. An agent of the invention may be mixed with the anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory dri^ in a fixed pharmaceutical composition or it may be administered separately, before, simultaneously with or after the anti-inflammatory or bronchodilatory drug. Such anti-inflammatory drugs include steroids, in particular glucocorticosteroids such as budesonide, beclamethasone, fluticasone or mometasone, and dopamine receptor agonists such as cabergoline, bromocriptine or ropinirole. Such bronchodilatory drugs include anticholiner^c or anlimuscarinic agents, in particular ipratropium bromide, oxitropium bromide and tiotropium bromide. Combinations of agents of the invention and steroids may be used, for example, in the treatment of COPD or, particularly, asthma. Combinations of agents of the invention and anticholinergic or anlimuscarinic agents or dopamine receptor agonists may be used, for example, in the treatment of asthma or, particularly, COPD.<br>
In accordance with the foregoing, the present invention also provides a method for the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease which comprises administering to a subject, particularly a human subject, in need thereof a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore described. In another aspect, the invention provides a compound of formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, as hereinbefore described for use in the preparation of a medicament for the treatment of an obstructive or inflammatory airways disease.<br>
The agents of the invention may be administered by any appropriate route, e.g. orally, for example in the form of a tablet or capsule; pacenterally, for example intravenously; topically to the skin, for example in the treatment of psoriasis; intranasally, for example in the treatment of hay fever; or, preferably, by inhalation, particularly in the treatment of obstructive ot inflammatory airways diseases.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention also provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising a compound of formula I in free form or in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt ot solvate thereof, optionally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor. Such compositions may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets and<br><br>
capsules. Formulations for topical administration may take the form of creams, ointments, gels or transdermal delivery systems, e.g. patches. Compositions for inhalation may comprise aerosol or other atomizablc formulations or dry powder formulations.<br>
The invention also includes (A) a compound of formula I as hereinbefore described in free form, or a phacmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, in inhalable form; (B) an inhalable medicament comprising such a compound in inhalable form together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in inhalable form; (C) a pharmaceutical product comprising such a compound in inhalable form in association with an inhalation device; and {D) an inhalation device containing such a compound in inhalable form.<br>
Dosages employed in practising the invention will of course vary depending, for example, on the particular condition to be treated, the effect desired and the mode of administration. In general, siutabie daily dosages for administration by inhalation are of the order of from 1 to 5000jlg.<br>
