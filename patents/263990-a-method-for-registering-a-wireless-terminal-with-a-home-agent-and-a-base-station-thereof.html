AUTOMATIC SELECTION OF A HOME AGENT<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
[0001J	This application claims the benefit of United States Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/792,017, entitled METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SUPPORTING MOBILE VIRTUAL NETWORK, and filed on April 14, 2006. The entirety of this application is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
L	Field<br>
[0002]	The following description relates generally to communications systems,<br>
and more particularly to selecting a home agent to utilize in connection with wireless terminal registration.<br><br>
[0003]       systems have become a prevalent means to<br>
  Wireless communication devices, such as cellular telephones, personal digital assistants, and the like have become smaller and more powerful in order to meet consumer needs and to improve portability and convenience. Consumers have become dependent upon these devices, demanding reliable service, expanded areas of coverage, additional services {e.g., web browsing capabilities), and continued reduction in size and cost of such devices.<br>
[0004]	A typical wireless communication network {e.g., employing frequency,<br>
time, and code division techniques) includes one or more base stations that provides coverage areas to subscribers as well as mobile {e.g., wireless) devices that can transmit and receive data within the coverage areas. A typical base station can simultaneously transmit multiple data streams to multiple devices for broadcast, multicast, and/or unicast services, wherein a data stream is a stream of data that can be of independent reception device. A user device within the coverage area of that base<br>
station can be interested in receiving one, more than one or all the data streams carried by the composite stream. Likewise, a user device can transmit data to the base station<br><br><br>
[0005]	To enable a wireless device to communicate within a wireless network,<br>
such device or a host associated therewith must be configured, which includes registering the wireless device with an entity that facilitates mobility management. In conventional cellular systems, a public-switched data network (PSDN) is utilized to determine which entity is to be associated with the wheless device. This can be important if one or more mobile virtual network operators (MVNO) has leased network infrastructure, as each MVNO can be desirably associated with a mobility management server. Thus, the wireless terminal is to be associated with a mobility management server that is leased or related to an MVNO that "owns" the subscriber utilizing the wireless device. Again, conventionally this is accomplished at the PSDN, which is a first connection point for IP in conventional networks. As networks adapt over time to enable IP cormections to occur at a periphery of networks, however, new manners of determining which mobility management server to associate with a wireless terminal will become necessary.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0029]	The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the<br>
drawings, wherem like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. rn ^s: ibilowdng description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that such subject matter may be practiced without these<br><br>
specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in<br>
block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.<br>
[0030]	Furthermore, various aspects are described herein in connection with a<br>
terminal. A terminal can also be called a system, a user device, a secure digital card (SD card), a subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile device, remote station, remote terminal, access terminal, user terminal, user agent, or user equipment. A user device can be a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a PDA, a handheld device having wireless connection capability, a module within a terminal, or other processing device connected to a wireless modem.<br>
[0031]	Moreover, aspects of the claimed subject matter may be implemented as<br>
a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer or computing components to implement various aspects of 3= riaimed subject matter. The term "article of manufacture" as used herein is intended E: =i33mpass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, sTTg-. or media. For example, computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips...), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD)...), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick, key drive...). Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving voice mail or in accessing a network such as a cellular network. Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of what is described herein.<br>
10032]	Referring now to Fig. 1, a system 100 is shown to illustrate selection of<br>
one of several home agents to associate with a wireless terminal in cormection with registering the wireless terminal with the home agent. In an example, system 100 can be a cellular-type IP system, such as one that can be utilized in connection with FLASH OFDM. System 100 includes a wireless terminal 102, which can be a mobile phone, a PCMCIA card, a memory card, a personal digital assistant, and/or the like. Wireless smninal 102 can be associated with a base station 104, such that data can be transmitted<br><br>
over the air between wireless terminal 102 and base station IU4.  lo enaoie sucn communications, one or more links between wireless terminal 102 and base station 104 need to be created and configured, wherein configuration includes providing a host device (not shown) with an IP address, which can be obtained through registering wireless terminal 102 with respect to a home agent.<br>
(0033]	In some instances, a subscriber (e.g., an owner/user of wireless terminal<br>
102) can be provided services by a particular network, such as a Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO), a Virtual Private Network (VPN), or other suitable networks, and thus should be registered with a home agent that is assigned to the particular network. For example, MVNOs typically lease network infrastructure and utilize such infrastructure to provide services to subscribers associated with the MVNO. When wireless terminal 102 powers on or initially enters a network (e.g., within range of base station 104), an authentication/authorization/accounting procedure is undertaken prior to enabling wireless terminal 102 to access services associated with a network. To ziat end, wireless terminal 102 can provide identiiying indicia to base station 104, aiiich can in turn relay such indicia to a AAA server 106. In another example, base sanon 104 can resolve a particular identity of a subscriber based upon identifying indicia provided by wireless terminal 102 and transmit such identity to AAA server 106. It is understood that any suitable manner for resolving an identity of a subscriber is contemplated by the inventors and intended to fall under the scope of the hereto-appended claims. Identifying indicia provided by wireless terminal can be, for example, a network access identifier (NAI), an Intemational Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), or any other suitable identifying indicia.<br>
[0034]	Based upon such identifying indicia, AAA server 106 can determine a<br>
home agent from amongst a plurality of home agents to associate with wireless terminal 102 during registration. In an example, AAA server 106 can return a home agent address (e.g. IP address) that is specific to a "realm" of the user's NAI (e.g., <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="4a3f392f273f27282f380a382f2b262764292527">[email&#160;protected]</a>). In another example, AAA server 106 can be communicatively coupled to an indexed database and can determine a home agent address based upon review of such index given the identifying indicia. In still another example, base station 104 can include sufficient intelligence lo determine a home agent<br><br>
that is to be assigned to wireless tenninal (and an address associated with the home agent).<br>
[0035]	Still further, a profile associated with wireless terminal 102 can reside<br>
within AAA server 106, and such profile can include an address of an appropriate home agent or a host name. For instance, AAA server 106 can return a AAA- home agent host name, and base station 104 can resolve such host name in a domain name server (DNS) 108. Additionally, the profile can include a network (e.g.. MVNO) ~ home agent hostname identifier which can be provided to base station 104, and base station 104 can resolve such host name to one or more IP addresses by way of local configuration, through DNS 108, or other suitable database.<br>
[00361	System 100 can include N home agents 110-114, where one or more of<br>
such home agents 110-114 can be associated with a network from amongst a plurality of networks 116-120, wherein the networks 116-120 can be or include MVNOs, VPNs, and other suitable networks, such that each network can be operated independent from the others (e.g.. different administrative domain, reuse of address space...). Thus, muUiple home agents can be associated with and/or assigned to a single network. For instance, home agent 110 can be associated with network 116, home agent 112 can be associated with network 118, home agent 114 can be associated with network 120, etc. For example, an association between a home agent and a network can mean that a home agent is directly connected to the network by way of a communication link, such as Tl, ATM, Ethernet, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the home agent can be directly connected to the network through utilization of a tunnel established between the home agent and the network (e.g., MPLS, IPinIP, ORE,...).<br>
[0037]	A home agent can be utilized to perform mobility management with<br>
respect to one or more wireless terminals. More particularly, a home agent can be a router that tunnels packets to and ft^om wireless terminal 102 by way of a current point of attachment (e.g., base station 104). Based upon identifying indicia provided by wireless terminal 102 during authentication, authorization, and/or accounting, a home agent address or hostname for one of the home agents 110-114 can be identified by AAA server 106, for example, and provided to base station 104. During registration of wireless terminal 102, base station 104 can indicate that wireless terminal 102 (or a host associated therewith) should request IP configuration information from the identified<br><br>
home agent. Thus, base station 104 can build a tunnel (e.g., a Mobile IP tunnel) to the correct home agent.<br>
[0038]	AAA server 106 and/or base station 104 can determine an appropriate<br>
home agent to associate with wireless terminal 102 through a variety of methods/mechanisms. For instance, a subscriber utilizing wireless terminal 102 may be associated with an MVNO that can be accessed by way of several home agents, and AAA server 106 can select one of such home agents. For example, the selection can be made based upon geographic location (e.g., a home agent that is geographically most proximate to wireless terminal 102). In another example, the selection can be made based upon an ordered list, such that if AAA server 106 associates a first wireless terminal with a first home agent associated with an MVNO then AAA server will associate a second wireless terminal with a second home agent associated with the MVNO. Additionally or alternatively, AAA server 106 can utilize a weighted list to select a home address with respect to wireless terminal 106. For instance, if a first home agent is associated with greater resources than a second home agent, it would be more likely that a wireless terminal is assigned to the home agent associated with a greater amount of resources.<br>
[0039]	A particular example follows to better describe selection of a particular<br>
home agent. Wireless terminal 102 can be associated with a user that subscribes to services provided by network 116. When wireless terminal 102 connects to a network, it goes through authentication with AAA server 106. AAA server 106 can receive identifying indicia associated with wireless terminal 102 and can return an address or hosmame of home agent 110 (which is assigned to network 116) to base station 104. Base station 104 thus has knowledge of to which home agent it should set up a turmel {e.g., using Mobile IP) to connect wireless terminal 102 to network 116. For instance, base station 104 can resolve a hostname to an IP address of home agent 110 through utilization of DNS 108.<br>
[0040]	Now referring to Fig. 2, a system 200 that is employed to illustrate use of<br>
a proxy in connection with determining a home agent to utilize in connection with registering a wireless terminal is shown. System 200 includes a wireless terminal 202 that is entering a network by way of a base station 204. During authentication, wireless terminal 202 can provide base station 204 with identifying indicia, such as an NAL The<br><br>
NAI can be relayed to a AAA server 206, which determines a network (e.g., MVNO) 208 associated with a subscriber utilizing wireless terminal 202. Such determination can be made through analysis of a realm within the NAI, for instance. The access request can then be provided to a network AAA server 210 (e.g., a AAA server 210 that is specific to network 208). Network AAA server 210 can then authenticate wireless terminal 202 and can provide base station 204 with a specific address or host name for at least one home agent 212 that is associated with network 208. The home agent address and/or hostname can be provided to base station 204 directly or by way of AAA server 206. If base station 204 receives a hostname, it can resolve such hostname to an IP address through utilization of a DNS (not shown), for example. Other mechanisms and manners for resolving a hostname to an IP address are contemplated by the inventors and are intended to fall under the scope of the hereto-appended claims. Base station 204 can build a Mobile IP tunnel to home agent 212, wherein home agent 212 can have a preconfigured tunnel to a gateway of network 208. In another embodiment, base station 204 can allocate a network home agent by resolving a realm of network 208 to a set of home agents (e.g., by way of DNS, local configuration, and/or other suitable database).<br>
[0041]	AAA server 206 can return an address ofhome agent 212 to base station<br>
204 in several different ways. For instance, base station 204 can be provided with an IP<br>
address that can be employed as is. In another example, such address can be in the form<br>
of a hostname that can be resolved to one or more IP addresses (for load balancing) by<br>
base station 204. Additionally, realm of network 208 can be provided to base station<br>
204, and base station 204 can automatically construct a host name (e.g.,<br>
homeagent.mvno) that can be resolved through utilization of a DNS.<br>
(0O42]	Referring to Figs. 3 and 4, methodologies relating to conitguring a<br>
wireless terminal and/or a host are illustrated. While, for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of acts, it is to be understood and appreciated that the methodologies are not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may, in accordance with one or more embodiments, occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled m the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a<br><br>
state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be utilized to implement a methodology in accordance with the claimed subject matter.<br>
[0043]	Referring specifically to Fig. 3, a methodology 300 for providing a home<br>
agent identity/address to a base station associated with a wireless terminal is illustrated. Methodology 300 starts at 302, and at 304 identifying indicia associated with a wireless terminal is received. More particularly, such identifying indicia can be received in connection with an authentication/authorization/accounting procedure that is undertaken when the wireless terminal attempts to access a wireless network. Furthermore, the identifying indicia can be an NAI, and can be received at a AAA server, for example. At 306, a home agent that is desirably assigned to the wireless terminal is determined, wherein such determination can be based at least in part upon the identifying indicia. For instance, a database can be accessed to determine the home agent. In another example, a realm within the NAI can be analyzed to determine a particular network, such as an MVNO, and based upon such determination a home agent associated with the network can be determined. At 308, a home agent address/identity is provided to the base station that is communicatively coupled to the wireless terminal. Thereafter, the base station can resolve the home agent address (if necessary) and can create a Mobile IP tunnel to the correct home agent. Methodology 300 can be effectuated within a AAA server, for example, and can be undertaken within an IP-based cellular type system. The methodology 300 then completes at 310.<br>
[00441	With reference now to Fig. 4, a methodology 400 for registering a<br>
wireless terminal with a home agent is illustrated. Methodology 400 can be undertaken within a base station, for example. Methodology 400 starts at 402, and at 404 a network access request is received from a wireless terminal. For instance, the wireless terminal can enter a geographic region associated with a network, can be powered on, etc. The access request can include providing a base station with identifying indicia associated with a wireless terminal (such that the wireless terminal can be subject to authentication/authorization). At 406, identifying indicia within the access request is provided to a AAA server, wherein such server can be an MVNO-specific AAA server, a wholesale AAA server, etc. As described above, the identifying indicia can be an NAI, an IMSI value, a phone number, or any other suitable data that can be utilized to identify the wireless terminal or a subscriber associated therewith.<br><br>
,0045]	At 408, identification of one or more home agents that may be assigned<br>
to the wireless terminal is received. For instance, such identification can be determined at a AAA server and provided to base station, wherein the identification may be IP address(es), hostname(s), etc. If one or more hostnames are received, then such hostnames can be resolved to IP addresses through utilization of a DNS, for example. At 410, registration is performed with respect to one of the identified home agents. For instance, the AAA server can provide base station with a realm or a list of home agents, and the base station can resolve the appropriate home agent based upon such list. In another example, the AAA server can provide the base station with a weighted list of home agents, wherein home agents can be weighted based upon location, capacity, and/or the like. The base station can then resolve which home agent should be associated with wireless terminal during registration with such terminal. In more detail, base station can create a Mobile IP (MIP) tunnel with the selected home agent. Methodology 400 then completes at 412.<br>
[0046]	With reference to Fig. 5, a configuration diagram 500 is illustrated.<br>
Diagram 500 relates to a host 502, a wireless terminal 504, a base station 506, a AAA server 508, a home agent 510, and optionally a DNS 512. Host 502 can be a computer or a portable device, and can include an IP stack. Wireless terminal 504 can be utilized to handle physical layer connections and communications with a network (e.g., establish wireless communications with base station 506). Base station 506 acts as an access point to network services, and home agent 508 can be utilized in connection with mobility management. AAA server 508 can be utilized in cormection with authentication, authorization, and/or accountmg with respect to wireless terminal 504, and DNS 512 can be employed in cormection with resolving an IP address when given a hostname of a home agent, for instance.<br>
(0047]	Wireless terminal 504 and base station 506 can undertake an air interface<br>
access at 514, wherein such act 514 relates to establishing a physical layer connection between wireless terminal 504 and base station 506. At 516 wireless terminal 504 provides base station 506 with a network access request, wherein such request can include identifying indicia relating to wireless terminal 504. Such indicia can include, for example, an NAI (or other suitable identifier). At 518, a AAA access request can be formed at base station 506 and provided to AAA server 508, wherein such request can<br><br>
include the NAI or other suitable identifier. At 519, network access can be performed<br>
between wireless terminal 504, base station 506, and AAA server 508. For instance,<br>
network access can relate to mutual authentication between wireless terminal 504 and<br>
AAA server. At 520, AAA server 508 can accept the access request and provide a<br>
message to base station 506 indicating as much. Additionally, the access accept<br>
message can include a home agent IP address, a hostname {e.g., MVNO-home agent<br>
hostname), or other suitable identifier of a particular home agent (e.g., home agent 510).<br>
[0048]	If AAA server 508 provides base station 506 with a hostname, base<br>
station 506 can provide a DNS resolution request with respect to such hostname to DNS 512 at 522. At 524 DNS 512 provides a resolution response to base station 506, wherein the resolution response can include an IP address of home agent 510 (that is associated with the hostname).<br>
[0049]	At 526, a connect response message is provided fcom base station 506 to<br>
wireless terminal 504, wherein such message can be employed in connection with<br>
configuring wireless terminal 504. For instance, the connect response message can<br>
include information that identifies base station 506 at a network layer {e.g., a unique<br>
identifier at the network layer). In an example, the information can be or include an IP<br>
address associated with base station 506, an indication that an IP address is ready with<br>
respect to host 502, the IP address of home agent 510, elc.<br>
[0050]	Wireless terminal 504 can thereafter provide a registration request<br>
message to base station 506 at 528, wherein the registration request message can conform to MMP (a protocol that is based upon Mobile IP but uses smaller messages). The act at 528 establishes a link as a primary link between wireless terminal 504 and base station 506 (if multiple links are enabled). In this example configuration diagram 500, MMP can run in wireless terminal 504 and base station 506. It is understood, however, that host 502 and/or home agent 510 can be configured to run MMP. Moreover, MIP can be run between wireless terminal 502 and base station 506 as is conventional, wherein such configuration request message includes a home agent identity or access. Base station 506 is configured to receive the registration request message and analyze a profile associated with the wireless terminal 504 (or subscriber associated therewith). The profile can be received, for instance, within the access message at 520 and can include the home agent address. Contents of the profile can be<br><br>
indicative of whether wireless terminal 504 is statically or dynamically addressed. At<br>
530, base station 506 can form and relay a MIP registration request message to home<br>
agent 510, which was identified during act 520. Addjiionaljy, if an initial registration,<br>
an indication can be provided at 530 that there is no IP address assigned to wireless<br>
terminal 504 (e.g., by setting a flag or including a particular value within the request).<br>
[0051]	At 532 home agent 5iO can respond to base station 506 with an<br>
appropriate reply in MIP (a MIP registration response message), for example. Such<br>
reply can include an IP address that is desirably assigned to host 502, an address of<br>
home agent 510, and/or an amount of time that the registration will be effective prior to<br>
expiring. Upon receiving the MIP registration response message, base station 506 can<br>
form an MMP registration response message and provide such message to wireless<br>
terminal 504 at 534. Such a message can include a lifetime field that corresponds to the<br>
amount of time within the MIP registration response message. For instance, the lifetime<br>
field can include a time that is equal to or less than the time indicated within the MIP<br>
registration response message. Alternatively, MIP can be run between home agent 510<br>
and host 502 in coimection with configuring the host 502 and/or wireless terminal 504.<br>
[0052]	Upon receipt of the MMP registration response message, wireless<br>
terminal 504 can have established its link with base station 506 as a primary link. As this may be a first time that wireless terminal 504 has established a primary link, wireless terminal 504 can indicate to host 502 over a wireless terminal interface that the network is available at 536. Such trigger can initiate an autoconfiguration process in host 502, wherein the configuration is valid until wireless terminal 504 indicates that the network is down over the wireless terminal interface. Typically, host 502 need only be notified once that a primary link has been established. In parallel, base station 506 can be aware that the link with wireless terminal 504 is the primary link with respect to wireless terminal 504.<br>
[0053J	At 538, host 502 can generate a DHCP discover message, which can be<br>
delivered to wireless terminal 504 and/or base station 506. If the DHCP discover message is received by base station 506, base station 506 can respond with an appropriate DHCP offer message to host 502 at 540. Such message can include various parameters (depending upon parameters within the DHCP Discover message). For instance, the DHCP offer message can include an IP address, a tease time, a gateway<br><br>
address for the assigned IP address, a network mast for the IP address assigned, and the like. At 542, host 502 can respond with a DHCP request message, and at 544 base station 506 can in turn respond with an acknowledgement message. In other words, base station 506 can be configured as a DHCP server. Host 502 is thus network layer coimected and configured.<br>
f0054]	In another example, wireless terminal 504 can be configured as a DHCP<br>
server. For instance, the DHCP discover message can be received by wireless terminal 504, which can have knowledge of configuration information associated with host 502. Wireless terminal 504 can thereafter form and provide host 1002 with the DHCP offer message, and can receive a response of host 502 (e.g., in the form of a DHCP request message). Wireless terminal 504 can thereafter provide host 502 with a DHCP acknowledgement. Additionally, host 502 can be configured to run MMP, such that (rather than wireless terminal 504) host 502 can generate and receive MMP messages. If host 502 is configured in such a manner, it may not be necessary to configure wireless terminal 504 or base station 506 as a DHCP server, as host 502 can be configured directly over MMP.<br>
[0055]	With reference now to Fig. 6, a configuration diagram 600 is illustrated.<br>
The configuration diagram 600 relates to a terminal device 602, a base station 604, a AAA server 606, a home agent 608, and (optionally) a DNS 610. For instance, temiinal device 602 can be a wireless terminal. In another instance, terminal device 602 can be a wireless terminal integrated with a host (e.g.. a computer, a Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a game machine, a camera...). Terminal device 602 and base station 604 can undertake an air interface access at 612, wherein such act 612 relates to establishing a physical layer connection between terminal device 602 and base station 604. At 614 terminal device 602 can form and relay a network access request to base station 604, wherein the request can include an NAI associated with terminal device 602 or other suitable identifying indicia.<br>
(0056]	At 616, base station 604 can provide AAA server 606 with a AAA access<br>
request. The request provided at 616 can include, for example, the identifying indicia. At 617, a network access procedure can be performed between terminal device 602 and AAA server 606. For example, AAA server can determine a profile associated with terminal device 602 during the network access procedure. At 618, AAA server 606 can<br><br>
generate an access accept message and provide such message to base station 604, wherein the access request message can include an address of home agent 608 (chosen from several available home agents) and/or a hostname, such as an MVNO home agent hostname. For instance, it may be desirable to assign terminal device 602 with a particular home agent that is associated with an MVNO that provides services to terminal device 602.<br>
[0057J	At 620, if the access accept message include a hostname, base station<br>
604 can provide a DNS resolution request with respect to such host name to DNS 610. At 622, DNS 610 generates and transmits a resolution response message to base station 604, wherein the response message can include an IP address of home agent 608. Base station 604 can then provide a configuration message to terminal device 602 at 624, wherein such message can include an address of home agent 608. At 626, terminal device can form a registration request in Mobile IP (MIP). For instance, the registration request can relate to requesting an IP address for a host (not shown) associated with terminal device 602. At 628, base station 604 can transmit the MIP registration request to home agent 608, and at 630 home agent 608 can respond with a MIP registration response message. At 632, the MIP registration response message is relayed from base station 604 to terminal device 602. In this case the MIP registration response message can include additional configuration e.g., home address, network mask, default router, DNS server and other information normally included in DHCP messages (e.g, as in Fig<br>
5)<br>
[00581	Turning now to Figs. 7 and 8 collectively, systems are provided that<br>
relate to configuring a host. The systems are represented as a series of interrelated tunctional blocks, which can represent fijnctions implemented by a processor, software, hardware, firmware, or any suitable combination thereof. Referring specifically to Fig. 7, a system that facilitates association of mobile terminal with a home agent is illustrated.

tunneJ to an identified home agent 704. For example, the home agent can be identified<br>
within the received profile. The logical module(s) 704 can include an antenna, a<br>
transmitter chain, a processor, memory, hardware, software, firmware, etc.<br>

For instance, the identifying indicia can be a NAl or other suitable identifying data. The module(s) 802 can include an anterma, a receiver chain, a processor, memory, and/or any suitable hardware, software, and/or firmware that can be utilized m cormection with receiving the identifying indicia. System 800 also includes logical module(s} for discerning a network associated with the subscriber 804. For example, the discernment can be made based at least in part upon the identifying mdicia. Such module(s) 804 can include a processor, a database, etc.  System 800 can further include logical module{s) for determining at least one home agent assigned to the network 806, wherein the module(s) 806 can include a processor, memory, a database, a DNS, etc.  System 800 can fiirther include logical moduie(s) for assigning at least one home agent to the describer 808, wherein module(s) 808 can include an antenna, a transmitter, a transmitter chain, a network port, a processor, memory, and the like.<br>

illustrated. Wireless communications apparatus can be, for example, a wireless terminal, a base station, and/or a AAA server. Apparatus 900 can include a memory 902, which can include instructions that relate to, for example, creating, packaging, and/or receiving identifying indicia associated with a subscriber. Moreover, memory 902 can include instructions for selecting a home agent based at least in part upon a received subscriber identity. Additionally, memory 902 can include instructions for creating an MIP tunnel between a base station and a selected home agent, eic. Apparatus 900 can also include a processor 904 that can execute instructions retained within memory 902.<br>
{0061]	To provide additional context for one or more embodiments described<br>
herein. Fig. 10 is provided to illustrate an example conununication system iOOO that comprises a plurality of nodes interconnected by communications links. The system<br><br>
] 000 may use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals to<br>
communicate information over wireless links. However, other types of signals, e.g.,<br>
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) signals or Time Division Multiple Access<br>
(TDMA) signals, are also contemplated (together with signals utilized in land-based<br>
networks). Nodes in the communication system 1000 exchange information using<br>
signals, e.g., messages, based on communication protocols, e.g., the Internet Protocol<br>
(IP). The communications links of the system 1000 may be implemented, for example,<br>
using wires, fiber optic cables, and/or wireless communications techniques. The system<br>
1000 includes a plurality of end nodes 1002-1012, which access the communication<br>
system 1000 by way of a plurality of access nodes 1014-1018. End nodes 1002-1012<br>
may be, e.g., wireless communication devices or terminals, and the access nodes 1014-<br>

In some embodiments, the access control node, e.g., a Remote Authentication Dial In User Service (RADIUS) or Diameter server, supports authentication, authorization, and/or accounting of end nodes and/or services associated with end nodes. In some embodiments, mobility support nodes 1022 and 1024, e.g., a Mobile IP home agents and/or context transfer servers, support mobility, e.g., handoff, of end nodes between access nodes, e.g., by way of redirection of traffic to/from end nodes and/or transfer of state associated with end nodes between access nodes. In some embodiments, application server node 1026, e.g., a Session Initiation Protocol server, streaming media server, or other application layer server, supports session signaling for services available to end nodes and/or provides services or content available to end nodes. In an example, different end nodes can be associated with different mobility support nodes according to a network to which they belong. For instance, first mobility support node 1022 can be associated with a first network while second mobility support node 1024 can be<br><br>
connected to a second network. Such networks can be, for instance, MVNOs, VPNs, and/or a combination thereof. As an example, mobility support nodes 1022 and 1024 can be coupled to network gateway modules (not shown) that enable such nodes to couple to first and second networks, respectively.<br>

additional module included in traffic control module 1228 follows.<br>
[0080]	Air interface module 1232 facilitates establishing a physical layer<br>
connection between an end node and access node 1200. Air interface module 1232 can be initiated, for instance, upon access node 1200 receiving an indication that a wireless terminal is within range of access node 1200 and desires access to a network. A network access module 1234 can be employed in connection with authenticating and authorizing an end node (e.g., authenticating identity of an end node and determining type and quality of service that should be provided to the end node). For instance, access node 1200 can act as a conduit between an end node and a AAA server, and network access module 1234 can facilitate packaging and relay of messages that relate to network access.<br>
{0081]	A DNS resolufion module 1236 can be ufiHzed in connection with<br>
receiving a hostname and resolving an IP address based at least in part upon the host name. In a particular example, access node 1200 can receive a MVNO-home agent hostname firom a AAA server. DNS resolution module 1236 can provide a DNS<br><br>
resolution request to a DNS server and can receive an IP address from such server. DNS resolution module 1236 can thereafter store the IP address within module data 1244, for example.<br>
[0082]	An MMP module 1238 enables access node 1200 to receive and interpret<br>
messages that correspond to an MMP protocol (for example, from a wireless terminal). MMP module additionally allows access node 1200 to form and transmit MMP messages, such as configuration request messages, to an end node. An MIP module 1240 provides a manner for access node 1200 to receive, interpret, form, and transmit configuration messages in Mobile IP (e.g., Mobile IPv4 and/or Mobile IPv6). A DHCP module 1242 provides access node 1200 with an ability to act as a DHCP server. For instance, DHCP module 1242 can be configured to respond to a DHCP discover message, provide a host device with configuration information, etc. Module data 1244 can include data that can be extracted by one or modules 1232-1242 or data that is input by one or more modules 1232-1242. For instance, module data 1242 can include network access data, can retain particular addresses (e.g., base station addresses, home agent addresses,...), MMP or Mobile IP data, etc. Additionally, module data 1242 can retain identifying indicia associated with an end node, a profile, a MVNO-home agent identifier, a home agent address, DHCP data, and the like.<br>
[0083]	Fig. 13 illustrates an example AAA server 1300 associated with various<br>
aspects. AAA server 1300 can be, for example, an access control node 1026 depicted in Fig. 10. As depicted, AAA server 1300 includes a processor 1302, a communication interface 1304, and memory 1308 coupled together by a bus 1310. Accordingly, various components of AAA server 1300 can exchange information, signals and data by way of bus 1310. Components 1302-1310 of end node 1300 may be located inside a housing 1312.<br>
[0084]	Communication interface 1304 provides a mechanism by which the<br>
internal components of AAA server 1300 can send and receive signals to/from external devices and network nodes (e.g., access nodes). Communication interface 1304 includes, for example, a receiver module 1314 with a corresponding receiving antenna 1316 and a transmitter module 1318 vwth a corresponding transmitting antenna 1320 used for coupling AAA server 1300 to other network nodes (e.g., by way of any suitable communications channels).<br><br>
[0085]	Processor 1302 may be under control of various modules (e.g., routines)<br>
included in memory 1308 and may control operation of AAA server 1300 to perform<br>
various signaling and processing as described herein. The modules included in memory<br>
1308 can be executed on startup or as called by other modules. Modules may exchange<br>
data, information, and signals when executed. Modules may also share data and<br>
information when executed. Memory 1308 of AAA Server 1300 may include a<br>
signaling/control module !326 and signaling/control data 1328.<br>
[0086]	Signaling/control module 1326 controls processing relating to receiving<br>
and sending signals (e.g., messages) for management of state information storage, retrieval, and processing. Signafing/control data 1328 includes state information such as, for instance, parameters, status, and/or other information relating to operation of the AAA server. In particular, signaling/control data 1328 may include configuration information 1330 (e.g., AAA server identification information) and operational information 1332 (e.g., information about current processing state, status of pending responses, etc.). Signaling/control module 1326 may access and/or modify signaling/control data 1328 (e.g., update configuration information 1330 and/or operational information 1332).<br>
[0087]	Memory 1308 can also include a correlator module 1334 which is<br>
utilized to correlate a home agent with a wireless terminal based upon identifying<br>
indicia associated with a wireless terminal, such as an NAT. For instance, correlator<br>
module 1334 can access a database that indexes home agents with particular MVNOs,<br>
and correlator module 1334 can determine a particular MVNO based upon the<br>
identifying indicia. Thereafter, correlator module 13 34 can determine at least one home<br>
agent that is assigned to the particular MVNO. Memory 1308 can also include a<br>
network access module 1336 that can be utilized to perform authentication with respect<br>
to a particular wireless terminal (as well as authorization and accounting).<br>
