				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Narrow Cranked Heald<br>
The invention relates to a flat ribbon heald with an end<br>
eyelet, shaft and thread eye, said heald being manufactured<br>
of a metal ribbon section.<br>
Healds are manufactured, for example, of flat steel<br>
ribbon during a punching operation. In so doing, parts are<br>
removed from a specifically cut metal ribbon in order to<br>
obtain the desired exterior form of the heald. The removed<br>
parts are waste, which considerably contributes to the<br>
consumption of material.<br>
At times, it is necessary to provide healds with a<br>
crank, in which case, in particular adjacent healds on a<br>
heald shaft are cranked, frequently away from each other in<br>
opposite direction. As a result of this, an offset is created<br>
between the thread eyes of adjacent healds relative to the<br>
longitudinal direction of the warp thread in order to<br>
facilitate the passage of warp threads between the healds.<br>
Paired healds having shafts with different offsets have been<br>
known from documents US 7 204 274 B2,and CH 468 489 and DE 10<br><br>
2005 033 175 B3. Each of these healds has a straight edge,<br>
respectively, extending along the shaft and the end eyelet.<br>
The achievable intermediate space between the shafts of<br>
adjacent healds is limited.<br>
Furthermore, document US 1 545 904 discloses the<br>
manufacture of healds of flat material that forms a<br>
relatively narrow sheet metal strip. The end eyelets adjoin<br>
the shaft in a symmetrical manner, whereby the shaft may be<br>
provided with a crank in order to define an enlarged thread<br>
passage space between adjacent healds.<br>
Furthermore, document US 2 973 789 discloses a heald set<br>
consisting of differently cranked healds, whereby the healds<br>
consist of a metallic flat material. Adjoining the end<br>
eyelets, the shafts of the healds are cranked and configured<br>
in such a manner that an enlarged thread passage space exists<br>
between adjacent healds.<br>
Finally, document US 644 371 discloses a heald that has<br>
been manufactured of a narrow steel strip, in which the<br>
thread eye and the end eyelet have been produced by spreading<br>
apart slotted sections. In addition, the shaft of such a<br>
heald may be cranked. During a stamping process, the shaft<br>
has been flattened on both sides of the thread eyelet in<br>
order to effect increased elasticity in longitudinal<br>
direction of the warp thread.<br>
Indeed, the production of elongated openings by slitting<br>
and widening is a material-saving process; however, this<br>
requires a relatively strong material deformation, thus<br>
restricting the choice of material and the possibilities of<br><br>
material optimization.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a heald and<br>
an economical manufacturing process for the production of<br>
said heald, this being intended to make possible a material-<br>
saving manufacture of high-performance healds.<br>
This object is achieved with the flat ribbon heald in<br>
accordance with Claim 1, as well as with the process in<br>
accordance with Claim 8:<br>
The flat ribbon heald consists of a metal ribbon section<br>
having an original width corresponding to the width at the<br>
end eyelet.. Material has been removed along the shaft, for<br>
example, during a stamping operation or the like. Between the<br>
end eyelet and the shaft is a transition section, in which<br>
the width is reduced from the end eyelet width to the shaft<br>
width. On its end eyelet, the heald has a straight edge that<br>
has - at some distance from the end eyelet, either at the<br>
transition section or at the shaft - a section extending away<br>
from the center line of the heald either in the form of a<br>
sharp bend or of an arc. As a result of this, the outer edge<br>
of the shaft is offset by an amount X. The center of the<br>
thread eye,, preferably is approximately on a line that<br>
connects the outside edges of the end eyelets with each<br>
other.<br>
Such a heald can be manufactured of a metal strip having<br>
a width that is no greater than the width of the end eyelets.<br>
Nerveless, a large offset between the thread eye and the end<br>
eyelet may be achieved in longitudinal direction of the warp<br>
thread.<br><br>
Starting with an initially flat ribbon heald - which is<br>
preferably planar, i.e., not twisted, and thus its end<br>
eyelet, transition section and shaft are located in a common<br>
plane, preferably not twisted relative to each other - the<br>
shaft is later arranged offset relative to the end eyelets.<br>
This offset of the shaft relative to the end eyelets, said<br>
offset not yet existing after the cutting out or punching out<br>
of the heald but being created later, is achieved by a<br>
plastic deformation of the transition region or of a part of<br>
the shaft within said plane. This is achieved by an<br>
appropriate stamping process. However, it is also possible to<br>
combine the punching and stamping steps in one step and to<br>
perform these with one tool. Also in this case, a plastic<br>
deformation on the shaft or on the transition region achieves<br>
the formation of a crank or offset.<br>
Additional details of advantageous embodiments of the<br>
invention are obvious from the drawings, the description and<br>
the subclaims. The description is restricted to essential<br>
aspects of the invention and to miscellaneous situations. The<br>
drawings disclose additional details and are to be considered<br>
supplementary. They show in<br>
Figures 1 and 2 flat ribbon healds after having been<br>
punched out, however, before the cranking<br>
or stamping step;<br>

in accordance with Figures 1 and 2;<br>
Figures 4 and 5 the flat ribbon healds manufactured from<br><br>
blanks as in Figures 1 and 2, following a<br>
stamping step;<br>
Figure 6	the superimposed flat ribbon healds as in<br>
Figures 4 and 5;<br>
Figures 7 and 8 alternative embodiments of flat ribbon<br>
healds, each depicted by two associate<br>
differently cranked superimposed healds;<br>
and,<br>
Figure 9	a modified embodiment of a flat ribbon<br>
heald in accordance with the invention,<br>
showing its end region.<br><br>
Figure 1 shows a flat ribbon heald blank 1 that has been<br>
punched out of a metal ribbon having the width B. This width<br>
B is less than is usual for punched flat ribbon healds. The<br>
flat ribbon heald blank 1 has two end eyelets 2, 3, with a<br>
shaft 4 provided between them. This shaft adjoins the end<br>
eyelets over transition regions 5, 6. During the manufacture<br>
of the flat ribbon heald blank 1, openings 7, 8 are applied<br>
to the end regions of the sheet metal strip section in order<br>
to form end eyelets 2, 3. These openings may have a<br>
continuous edge or may also have, as shown, a discontinuous<br>
edge. Depending on this, O-shaped end eyelets (as in Figure<br>
8, for example) or C-shaped end eyelets (as in Figures 1<br>
through 6) or J-shaped end eyelets (as in Figure 7) are<br>
created.<br>
The flat ribbon heald blank 1 has a straight edge 9,<br>
which extends from the upper end of the upper end eyelet 7 to<br>
the lower end of the lower end eyelet 8. This straight edge 9<br>
corresponds to a lateral edge of the original metal ribbon<br>
section. However, at the end eyelets 2, 3, only two sections<br>
10, 11, respectively, are still left opposite the straight<br>
edge. In a section located in-between, said section<br>
comprising the transitions regions 5, 6 and the shaft 4, the<br>
material is removed from the metal ribbon section (e.g., by<br>
a punching or cutting process), thus creating inward-<br>
extending edge sections 12, 13 and an inward-offset edge<br>
section 14. In addition, the shaft 4 has been provided with a<br>
thread eye 15, in which an appropriate opening has been<br>
provided at the desired location. Additional openings 16, 17<br>
may be provided on the end eyelets 2, 3 or in the transition<br>
regions 5, 6.<br><br>
Figure 2 shows another flat ribbon heald blank 18.<br>
While, in the case of the flat ribbon heald blank 1 the<br>
straight continuous edge 9 is located on the side of the edge<br>
interruption of the openings 7, 8, this continuous edge 9 is<br>
provided on the other side of the blank in the case of the<br>
flat ribbon heald blank 18 in accordance with Figure 2 and<br>
thus extends continuously over the closed edges of the end<br>
eyelets 2, 3. The sections 10, 11 are located on those sides<br>
of the end eyelets 2, 3 that have a discontinuous edge. The<br>
same applies to the edge sections 12, 13, 14. Other than<br>
that, the description of the flat ribbon heald blank 1<br>
applies analogously to that of the heald blank 18, using the<br>
same reference numbers.<br>
When the two heald blanks 1, 18 are superimposed, the<br>
appearance is as in Figure 3. Remaining between the edge<br>
sections 14 is a distance D that is relatively small. Of<br>
course, the heald blanks 1, 18 may be installed as healds<br>
already in this state, however, due to the minimal distance<br>
D, there is the risk of damaging the warp threads that would<br>
have to pass between the heald blanks 1, 18.<br>
Therefore, the heald blanks 1, 18 move through another<br>
processing step, e.g., a stamping step, in the course of<br>
which they are being cranked outward away from each other,<br>
e.g., in the transition regions 5, 6. In so doing, they are<br>
deformed within the plane defined by the end eyelets 2, 3 and<br>
the shaft 4 in such a manner that the thread eye 15 is<br>
located on an imaginary line 19, as is marked by the former<br>
position of the edge 9. This imaginary line 19 connects the<br>
remaining sections 9a, 9b of the edge 9 that are still<br>
present on the end eyelets 2, 3. The center of the thread eye<br><br>
15 is located on the line 19 or is bent outward beyond said<br>
line, i.e., to the left in Figure 4. This thread eye is<br>
arranged in the center section 9c of the former edge 9. This<br>
section 9c is located at a distance X from the line 19. In so<br>
doing, the distance X is preferably as great as half the<br>
width Bl of the shaft 4 in the region of the thread eye 15.<br>
During the reforming process, the edge 9 is divided into<br>
sections, namely the sections 9a, 9b, that are located on the<br>
line 19 and terminate in the sections 9d, 9e, via an outward<br>
directed sharp bend or an arc, said latter sections extending<br>
from the line 19 and terminating in the central section 9c,<br>
which, in turn, is straight again.<br>
The manufacture of the thusly produced flat ribbon heald<br>
20 requires less use of material, when compared with<br>
conventional healds provided with wider metal ribbon<br>
sections. Compared with healds having widened end eyelets,<br>
more minimal local material deformations occur. The material<br>
selection may be optimized.<br>
A complementary flat ribbon heald 21 can be produced<br>
from the flat ribbon heald blank 18. Again, a reformation<br>
process is used, in the course of which the center of the<br>
shaft 4 is brought onto the line 19 that marks the former<br>
course of the edge 9. As a result of this, the edge 9 is<br>
divided into the sections 9a, 9b, 9c, 9d, 9e. The above<br>
description of the flat ribbon heald blank 18 and the flat<br>
ribbon heald 20 applies analogously, using the same reference<br>
numbers.<br>
When the flat ribbon healds 20, 21 are fittingly<br>
superimposed in the manner as they are lined up on the<br><br>
carrier rails as shown by Figure 6, it is obvious that the<br>
shafts 4 are bent away from each other. Therefore, a distance<br>
R is created between the edge sections 14 of the shafts 4 in<br>
the region of the thread eyes 15, said distance being<br>
substantially greater than the distance D in accordance with<br>
Figure 3. Preferably, the distance R has a size that is half<br>
the width Bl of the shaft 4, ideally the same size as the<br>
width Bl of the shaft 4.<br>
Figure 7 shows a modified heald pair 22 with J-shaped<br>
end eyelets 2, 3. Other than that, the above descriptions<br>
apply analogously, using the same reference numbers.<br>
Figure 8 shows a heald pair 23 with ring-shaped end<br>
eyelets 2, 3. Again, the above description applies<br>
analogously.<br>
While, in all of the above exemplary embodiments, the<br>
offset of the section 9c of the edge 9 is provided on the<br>
transition sections 5, 6, it is also possible to move this<br>
offset into the region of the shaft 4. Figure 9 shows such an<br>
example. While the transition region 5 reduces the width of<br>
the heald from the larger width B in the region of the end<br>
eyelet 2 to the amount of the smaller width A of the shaft 4,<br>
the straight section 9a of the edge 9 extends over the end<br>
eyelet 2, as well as over the transition region 5. The<br>
adjoining shaft 4 is cranked, so that the section 9d of the<br>
edge 9 is located in the region of the shaft 4. Also in this<br>
case the outward-facing section 9d directly adjoins the<br>
straight section 9a via an arc or a sharp bend.<br>
The healds in accordance with the invention consist of a<br><br>
metal ribbon section having the width B that is narrower than<br>
the total width B+X required for the flat ribbon heald 20.<br>
The flat ribbon heald 20 has an essentially non-machined - in<br>
any event, not trimmed - edge 9 derived from the metal ribbon<br>
section and an edge 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 that has been<br>
produced, in the region of the shaft 4 and the transition<br>
regions 5, 6, by trimming the metal ribbon section. An<br>
outward-directed crank of the shaft 4 creates an enlarged<br>
distance R between two associate oppositely cranked flat<br>
ribbon healds of a heald pair 23 which comprises two<br>
oppositely cranked flat ribbon healds 20, 21.<br><br>
