				<td>HIGH LYSINE MAIZE COMPOSITIONS AND METHODS FOR DETECTION THEREOF<br>
[oooi] This application claims benefit under 35 USC ยง 119(e) of United States provisional application Serial No. 60/529,182 filed 11 December 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to the field of plant molecular biology. More specifically, the present invention relates to transgenic maize with increased lysine, and to assays and methods for identifying the specific exogenous DNA providing increased lysine.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Zea mays, commonly known as maize and com, is a grain widely used in animal feed. The grain, i.e., kernel, is a source of protein, starch, and oil for swine, cattle, and poultry. Of the ten amino acids deemed essential in a mixed grain feed source, corn is particularly limiting in lysine, threonine, and methionine. The lack of these amino acids, especially lysine, requires that feed corn or corn meal be supplemented with these nutrients, often provided by the addition of soybean meal. It would be of benefit to the art to increase the level of lysine in corn kernel as a means of making the seed and meal more nutritious as an animal feed.<br>
[0004] In order to increase levels of lysine using a molecular biological approach, a feedback-insensitive version of at least one of the lysine pathway enzymes, namely dihydrodipicoMnic acid synthase (referred to herein as DHDPS), has been identified and employed. A bacterial DHDPS gene isolated from E. coli has been shown in vitro to be about 200-fold less sensitive to inhibition by increases in lysine levels and, when introduced into transgenic tobacco, over-expression of the E. coli DHDPS gene resulted in increased levels of lysine in leaf tissue (Glassman et al, U.S. Patent 5,288,300). Falco et al. disclose transgenic plants with increased levels of lysine in the seed and genes useful for the production of such transgenic plants (U.S. Patents 5,773,691 and 6,459,019; U.S. Patent Application Publication 2003/0056242,, each of which is incoiporated herein by reference in its entirety). In these reports, Falco et al. describe the isolation and use of feedback-insensitive DHDPS from E. coli and DHDPS from Corynebacterium (also known as cordapA) to generate transgenic rapeseed, tobacco, maize, and soybean plants with increased levels of Jysine in the seed. For maize, Falco et al. report an<br><br>
approximately 130% increase in free lysine in kernels transformed with the cordapA gene relative to non-transformed kernels.<br>
[ooos] It would be advantageous to be able to detect the presence or absence of a particular transgcne in a plant or seed, or progeny of such plants or seeds, not only with respect to the iran.sgene itself, but also with respect to its location in the genome of a host plant or seed. Identification with respect to location further provides identification of the transgenic event by which a genetic engineer inserted the transgene into the progenitor plant of the plant or seed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006]     The present invention provides constructs useful for generating transgenic events and materials  and methods  useful  for identifying particular transgenic  events that resulted in transgenic plants that accumulate higher levels of lysine than do closely related plants that do not include the construct.   In particular, this invention comprises a line of marker-free transgenic maize   comprising   a   specific   exogenous  DNA   that   was   introduced   via  standard   maize transformation, referred to herein as "the LY038 Event" or "Event LY038."    The present invention further provides a method for detecting the presence or absence of the LY038 Event in DNA obtained from maize plants, seeds, or tissue samples.    The maize plant of the present invention comprising Event LY03S exhibits increased lysine in the kernel relative to a progenitor or other substantially related plant.   In addition, the present invention provides an exogenous DNA   construct comprising a maize globulin  1 promoter,  a rice actin  1 intron, a maize dihydrodipicolinate    synthase    chloroplast    transit    peptide-encoding    DNA    molecule,    a Coiynebacterium dihydrodipicolinate synthase-encoding DNA molecule, and a maize globulin 1 3' untranslated region that, when operably linked and expressed in transgenic plant cells and plants, results in increased lysine content in the kernel or parts thereof or a processed product derived from the kernel or plant.   In another embodiment, the construct further comprises a lox site, present as a component of a mechanism for removing the marker gene used to identify successful transformants.<br>
[GOO?] With respect to identifying a plant or seed derived from a particular transgenic event, compositions and methods are provided for detecting the presence of the genomic insertion region from a novel maize plant comprising Event LY038, i.e., the site in the genome where the construct resides. DNA molecules are provided that comprise at least a portion of the exogenous<br><br>
DNA inserted into the genome and a portion of the DNA from the maize genome flanking the insertion site (referred to herein as a "junction sequence").<br>
[ooos]     In yet another embodiment of the present invention, novel DNA molecules are provided that comprise at least about 20 base pairs of SEQ ED NO: 1 or 2, where base pairs 1781-1782 or 200-201, respectively, are included.    Further provided by the present invention are DNA molecules comprising the sequence of an amplicon having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6 obtained by a DNA amplification method using primers of SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4; and a hybridization probe complementary to said amplicon, having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 and complements thereof.   DNA molecules having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5 or 6 span the junction between the exogenous DNA and flanking maize genomic DNA and are diagnostic for Event LY038 DNA when used in suitable analytical tests.  Other preferred DNA molecules of the present invention that span the junction of the exogenous DNA/genomic insertion region of Event LY038 are molecules having the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2, and 11, and complements thereof. A stably transformed maize plant or seed comprising these molecules is another aspect of this invention.<br>
[0009] Primers are said to be of "sufficient length" when they are of a length that allows the primer to function in a PCR reaction and specifically amplify a target sequence; a length of about 11 nucleotides or more is sufficient, more preferably about 18 nucleotides or more, yet more preferably about 24 nucleotides or more, even more preferably about 30 nucleotides is sufficient to perform and specifically amplify a target sequence. One skilled in the art would know that a primer of even greater length than about 30 nucleotides can be usefully employed in a PCR reaction and, accordingly, is of a sufficient length.<br>
[ooio] PCR primers useful for identifying Event LY038 comprise a sufficient length of a transgene portion of the DNA sequence of SEQ ED NO: 1 and a sufficient length of a 5' flanking maize DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1, or a sufficient length of a transgene portion of the DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2 and a sufficient length of a 3' flanking maize DNA sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2. These primers are useful in PCR methods to provide a DNA amplicon product that is diagnostic for Event LY03S and its progeny. PCR primers homologous or complementary to any suitable length of SEQ ID NOs: 1 and 2 that can produce an amplicon or probe that is diagnostic for Event LY038 are another aspect of the present invention. For example, without<br><br>
limitation, preferred primers that are diagnostic for Event LY038 include those having at least about 18 contiguous nucleotides of either of the sequences of SEQ ED NO: 3 or 4. The amplicons produced using DNA primers that are diagnostic for Event LY038 and its progeny are an aspect of this invention. A preferred amplicon diagnostic for Event LY038 has the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6.<br>
[ooii] Another aspect of the present invention provides methods of detecting the presence or absence of DNA corresponding to Event LY038 in a sample. Such methods comprise obtaining DNA from a maize plant, seed, or tissue, contacting the sample DNA with a PCR primer set, performing PCR and detecting the presence or absence of an amplicon. Preferred PCR primers diagnostic for Event LY038 include oligonucleotide primers having the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4, which produce an LY038 event-specific amplicon having the sequence of, for example, SEQ ID NO: 6, which is detectable by an LY038 event-specific probe having the sequence of, for example, SEQ ID NO: 5.<br>
feยซ3j    Hybridization of a probe indicating the presence of Event LY03S. to an amplicon comprising DNA specific to Event LY038 may be detected by any suitable means available to nucleic acid manipulation arts, including TaqManยฎ assays, Southern blot methods among other methods known to those of ordinary skill in the art of molecular biology. One skilled in the art would know that the detecting of the amplicon may be carried out by means of detection that do not involve hybridization of a probe to an amplicon, such as acrylamide gel or agarose gel analyses.  One skilled in the art would also know that both the length and sequence of both the primer and probe may be varied from the exemplified sequences presented in SEQ ID NOs: 3, 4, and 5, and still produce a PCR amplicon, or amplicon and probe set, that is diagnostic for Event LY038.<br>
foeยซ9 In another aspect, the present invention provides a method for producing progeny plants comprising Event LY038 DNA. The progeny plants may be inbred or hybrid plants. In a further application, the present invention provides a method for performing marker-assisted breeding for Event LY038 DNA. According to another aspect of the present invention, a stably transformed maize plant comprising Event LY038 DNA and further comprising increased lysine in the kernel or parts thereof is provided.<br><br>
loon] The present invention further relates to a DNA detection kit comprising at least one DNA molecule of sufficient length of contiguous nucleotides homologous or complementary to SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, that functions as a DNA primer or probe specific for Event LY038 or its progeny, [ooisj This present invention further relates to the plants and seeds and processed products thereof of high lysine maize (Zea mays) comprising Event LY038 and the progeny derived thereof having representative seed deposited as ATCC Accession No. PTA-5623. Additionally provided by th.e present invention is a maize plant or a part thereof, including, for example, pollen or seed, produced by growing a plant that comprises Event LY038-DNA. The maize plant and seed comprising Event LY038 DNA for which the DNA primer molecules of the present invention are usefully employed for detection of the event-specific sequences are further aspects of the invention.<br>
[0016] A processed product of LY038 Event comprises a part of a maize kernel, for example, the endosperm. A maize meal of the present invention can be made from the kernel comprising the transgenic DNA molecule of LY038, wherein the meal is high in lysine relative to other maize meals not containing the DNA molecule.<br>

The  following examples are included to demonstrate examples of certain preferred embodiments of the present invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent approaches the inventors have found function well in the practice of the present invention, and thus can be considered to constitute examples of preferred modes for its practice.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0033]     As used herein, "exogenous DNA" refers to DNA that does not naturally originate from the particular construct, cell, or organism in which that DNA is found.   Exogenous DNA may include a DNA or RNA sequence native to a genome but in a new location in the genome or linked to other sequence elements not naturally associated with the exogenous DNA in its native state. Recornbinant DNA. constructs used for transforming plant cells comprise exogenous DNA and usually other elements as discussed below. As used herein "transgene" means an exogenous DNA that has been incorporated into a host genome or is capable of autonomous replication in a host cell and is capable of causing the expression of one or more cellular products. Exemplary transgenes provide the host cell or plants regenerated therefrom, with a novel phenotype relative to the corresponding non-transformed progenitor cell or plant, or a corresponding transformed progenitor cell or plant comprising other transgenes but not the particular transgene in question. Transgenes may be directly introduced into a plant by genetic transformation, or may be inherited from a plant of any previous generation that was transformed with the exogenous DNA. foo34j     As used herein, "gene" or "coding sequence" means a DNA sequence from which an RNA molecule is transcribed.   The RNA may be an mRNA that encodes a protein product, an RNA that functions as an anti-sense molecule, or a structural RNA molecule such as a tRNA, rRNA, snRNA, or other  RNA.    As used herein "expression" refers to the combination of intracellular processes, including transcription and translation, by which a DNA molecule, such as a gene, is employed to produce a polypeptidc or an RNA molecule.   An exemplary coding sequence is a Corynebacterium dihydrodipicolinate synthase gene (DHDPS; Bonnassie et al, Nucleic Acids Research,    18:6421,   1990; Richaud et al., J. Bacterial,   166:297-300,   1986; bp 2101 to 3003 of SEQ  ID NOs: 7 and 8), useful for the production of maize kernels with<br><br>
increased lysine. A maize plant, transformed to contain and express a Corynebacterium DHDPS gene resulting in increased lysine in kernel tissue, is also referred to as a high lysine maize plant. [0035]     As used herein, "promoter" means a region of DNA sequence that is essential for the initiation of transcription of DNA, resulting in generation of an RNA that is complementary to the transcribed DNA; this region may also be referred to as a "5" regulatory regioa" Promoters are located upstream of the coding sequence to be transcribed and have regions that act as binding sites for RNA polymerase and have regions that work with other factors to promote RNA transcription.   Useful plant promoters include those that are constitutive, inducible, tissue-specific, temporally  regulated,  circadian  in  regulation, drought inducible,  stress inducible, developmentally regulated, cold inducible, light inducible, and the like. Of particular importance to the present invention is an embryo-specific promoter, such as, without limitation, the maize globulin 1 promoter (Kriz, Biochem. Genet., 27:239-251, 1989; Belanger and Kriz, Genetics, 129:863-872, 1991; bp 48 to 1440 of SEQ ID NO: 7).<br>
[0036]    As is well known in the art, recombinant DNA constructs typically also comprise other regulatory elements in addition to a promoter, such as but not limited to 3' untranslated regions (such as polyadenylation sites or transcriptional termination signals), transit or signal peptides, introns, and marker genes elements.   A 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) useful in the practice of the present invention is the globulin 1 3' UTR (Kriz, Biochem. Genet., 27:239-251, 1989; Belanger and Kriz,   Genetics,  129:863-872,  1991; bp 3080 to 4079 of SEQ ID NO: 7).    A particularly useful transit peptide is the maize DHDPS transit peptide (Frisch et aL, Mol. Gen. Genet., 228:287-293, 1991; bp 1930 to 2100 of SEQ ID NO: 7). An intron useful in the context of the present invention is the rice actin 1 intron 1 (McElroy et aL, Plant Cell, 2:163-171, 1990; bp 1448 to 192S of SEQ ID NO: 7).<br>
[0037) As used herein, the term "maize" means Zea mays, also known as com, and includes all plant varieties that can be bred with maize, including wild maize species. Methods and compositions for transforming plants by introducing an exogenous DNA into a plant genome in the practice of this invention can include any of the well-known and demonstrated methods. To date, microparticle- and Agrobacterium-mediatcd gene delivery are the two most commonly used plant transformation methods. Microparticle-mediated transformation refers to the delivery of DNA coated onto microparticles that are propelled into target tissues by several methods.<br><br>
Agrobacrerium-m&amp;diated transformation is achieved through the use of a genetically engineered soil bacterium belonging to the genus Agrobacterium. Several Agrobacteriwn species mediate the transfer of a specific DNA known as "T-DNA," which can be genetically engineered to carry any desired piece of DNA into many plant species. Preferred methods of plant transformation are microprojectile bombardment as illustrated in U.S. Patents 5,015,580; 5,550,318; 5,538,880; 6,160,208; 6,399,861; and 6,403,865; and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation as illustrated in U.S. Patents 5,635,055; 5,824,877; 5,591,616; 5,981,840; and 6,384,301, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0038] As used herein a "transgenic" organism is one whose genome has been altered by the incorporation of foreign genetic material or additional copies of native genetic material, e.g. by transformation or recombination. The transgenic organism may be a plant, mammal, fungus, bacterium, or virus. As used herein "transgenic plant" means a stably transformed plant or progeny plant of any subsequent generation derived therefrom, wherein the DNA of the plant or progeny thereof contains an introduced exogenous DNA not originally present in a non-transgenic plant of the same strain. The transgenic plant may additionally contain sequences that are native to the plant being transformed, but wherein the exogenous DNA has been altered in order to alter the level or pattern of expression of the gene.<br>
[0039] As used herein, a "stably" transformed plant is a plant in which the exogenous DNA is heritable. The exogenous DNA may be heritable as a fragment of DNA maintained in the plant cell and not inserted into the host genome. Preferably, the stably transformed plant comprises the exogenous DNA inserted into the chromosomal DNA in the nucleus, mitochondria, or chloroplast, most preferably in the nuclear chromosomal DNA.<br>
[0040] As used herein a "R0 transgenic plant" is a plant that has been directly transformed with an exogenous DNA or has been regenerated from a cell or cell cluster that has been transformed with an exogenous DNA. As used herein "progeny" means any subsequent generation, including the seeds and plants therefrom, which is derived from a particular parental plant or set of parental plants; the resultant progeny line may be inbred or hybrid. Progeny of a transgenic plant of this present invention can be, for example, self-crossed, crossed to a transgenic plant, crossed to a non-transgenic plant, and/or back crossed.<br><br>
10041} The seeds of the plants of this present invention can be harvested from fertile transgenic plants and be used to grow progeny generations of plants of this present invention, including a hybrid plant line comprising the exogenous DNTA of Event LY038, which provides the benefit of increased lysine in the maize kernel. The maize kernel may be processed into meal and oil products or the kernel can fed to animals without processing. The meal product in particular contains an enhanced agronomic trait, increased Jysine. The present invention contemplates a maize meal with increased lysine relative to other maize meals, wherein the maize meal comprises the exogenous DNA of EventLY038.<br>
[0042]     The term "Event LY038 DNA" refers to a DNA segment comprising an exogenous DNA inserted into a particular location in a genome and adjacent flanking genomic DNA that would be expected to be transferred to a progeny plant from a parent plant containing the exogenous DNA. More specifically, Event LY038 DNA also refers to each of the DNA regions that include an interface of the genomic DNA and the inserted exogenous DNA in the genome of the R0 transformant, e.g., a region around one interface where the 5' end is in genomic DNA and the 3' end is in exogenous DNA. In addition, the sequence of the exogenous DNA comprising an event DNA may be altered while resident in its particular location in a host genome, e.g., a portion of the sequence may be changed, deleted, or  amplified, and still constitute said event DNA providing said exogenous DNA continues to reside in the same location in the genome. [0043]    A transgenic "event" is produced by transformation of a plant cell with an exogenous DNA construct, the regeneration of a plant resulting from the insertion of the exogenous DNA into the genome of the plant, and selection of a particular plant characterized by event DNA. Typically, a number of plant cells are transformed, producing a population of plants from which a particular plant is selected. The term "event" refers to the original R0 transformant and progeny of the transformant that include the exogenous DNA inserted into a particular and unique location in the genome, i.e., event DNA. The term "event" also refers to progeny produced by a sexual outcrOss, a self-cross, or repeated backcrossing, wherein at least one of the plants used in the breeding are of any generation of the original R0 transformant containing event DNA. [0044]    Thus, a transgenic "event" is a plant comprising and defined by an "event DNA."  In this way. "Event LY038" comprises "LY03S Event DNA."    A plant may comprise two or more different event DNAs and thus comprise two or more different events.    In addition, a plant<br><br>
lacking a given transgene event X does not comprise that event DNA X in question. Event DNA may be transferred from plant to plant, generation to generation, by any breeding scheme, method, or tool known to those of skill in the art of maize breeding.<br>
[00^5]    Transformation of plants typically utilizes a selectable marker and selection method to distinguish the transformed cells of the culture from the non-transformed cells.    In some instances the selectable marker gene remains in the transgenic plant; in other instances it is desirable to remove the selectable marker gene or other sequences introduced in the exogenous DNA.    Homologous recombination is one method useful for the deletion of marker genes residing within a transgenic plant (U.S Patent 6,580,019, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).   Another useful tool for removing sequences from a plant involves the use of site-specific recombinase enzymes and their respective site-specific target sites. [0046]    A  number  of different  site-specific  recombinase  systems  could  be  employed  in accordance with the instant invention, including, but not limited to, the Cre/lox system of bacteriophage PI, and the FLP/FRT system of yeast.   The bacteriophage PI Cre/lox and the yeast FLP/FRT systems constitute two particularly useful systems for site-specific integration or jxcision of transgenes. In these systems, a recombinase (Cre or FLP) will interact specifically vith its respective site-specific recombination sequence (lox or FRT, respectively) to invert or xcise the intervening sequences. The sequence for each of these two systems is relatively short (34 bp for lox and 47 bp for FRT) and therefore, convenient for use with transformation vectors. The FLP/FRT and Cre/lox recombinase systems have been demonstrated to function efficiently in plant cells. In a preferred embodiment, a Cre/lox recombinase system is employed to removed selectable marker sequences, particularly an NPT U marker gene (see Figure 1) flanked by lox P recombination sites  (bp 4091   to 4124 SEQ ID NO: 7; Russell  et al, Mol.   Gen.  Genet., 234:45-59, 1992).<br>
low?] A transgenic plant, seed or parts thereof, that shows an enhanced desired trait, e.g., "increased lysine," is a plant comprising an exogenous DNA that imparts a desired, measurable change in a trait in comparison to a plant of substantially the same genotype that lacks the desired exogenous DNA. Preferably, the enhanced desired trait is measured by comparing the trait in a transgenic plant with the exogenous DNA associated with the enhanced desired trait to the trait in a plant of substantially the same genotype but lacking that exogenous DNA. Such a<br><br>
plant that lacks that exogenous  DNA can be a natural wild-type plant or a transgenic plant, preferably of the same species   as the transgenic plant.     Preferably,  the plant lacking the exogenous DNA is a sibling lacking the desired exogenous DNA of the plant comprising the desired exogenous DNA.  Such a sibling plant may comprise other exogenous DNAs.  Increased lysine may be exhibited by the plant by accumulation of increased amounts of the amino acid in the kernel and may be measured by any suitable method, such as that of mass spectrophotometry or high performance liquid chromatography of appropriately extracted tissue. [0048]     As used herein, a "probe" is an isolated oligonucleotide to which may be attached a detectable label or reporter molecule, e.g., a radioactive isotope, ligand, chemiluminescent agent, dye, or enzyme. Such a probe is complementary to a strand of a target nucleic acid. In the case of the present invention, such a probe is complementary to a strand of genomic DNA from Event LY038, e.g., genomic DNA from a maize plant or seed or other plant part of Event LY038. Probes according to the present invention are materials, including DNA, RNA, and polyamides, that bind specifically to a target DNA sequence and can be used to detect the presence of that target DNA sequence.<br>
[0049] "Primers" are isolated oligonucleotides that can anneal to a complementary target DNA strand by nucleic acid hybridization and then be extended along the target DNA strand by a polymerase, e.g., a DNA polymerase. As used herein, primers of the present invention are used for DNA amplification of a target nucleic acid sequence, for example, by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and may also be referred to as "PCR primers."<br>
[ooso]     Probes and primers are of sufficient nucleotide length to bind to the target DNA sequence specifically under the hybridization conditions or reaction conditions determined by a skilled artisan.   This length may be any length that is of sufficient length to be useful in the detection method of choice.   Generally, about 11 nucleotides or more in length, preferably about IS nucleotides or more, more preferably about 24 nucleotides or more, and, most preferably, about 30 nucleotides or more are used.     Such probes and primers hybridize specifically to a target. Preferably, probes and primers according to the present invention have complete DNA sequence similarity of contiguous nucleotides with the target sequence, although probes differing from the target DNA sequence and that retains the ability to hybridize to target DNA sequences may be designed by conventional methods.    Methods for preparing and using probes and primers are<br><br>
known to those of skill in the art, using protocols published in, for example, Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratoiy Manual, Second Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989, and the like.<br>
[0051] Identification of the flanking genomic DNA sequences surrounding the insertion site of transgenic events allow for the design of detection methods that are specific for a given transgenic event inserted into a particular location in a genome. Such a detection method, which can differentiate between the same or similar transgenes located in different insertion sites in a genome, is termed an event-specific DNA detection method, e.g., an event-specific assay. Event-specific assays, for example, for glyphosate tolerant maize event nk603 have been described (LJ.S. Patent Application Publication 2002/0013960, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[0052J    In a preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid probe of the present invention specifically hybridizes to the LY038 Event-specific amplicon having the nucleic acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 3-6, or complements thereof, most preferably SEQ ID NO: 5 or complements thereof.  Jn another aspect of the present invention, a preferred nucleic acid probe molecule of the present invention shares between about 80%, preferably about 90%, more preferably about 95%, even more preferably about 98%, and most preferably about 99% sequence identity with the nucleic acid sequence set forth in one or more of SEQ ID NOs: 3-6, or complements or fragments thereof.  Exemplary probes diagnostic for Event LY03S have the sequence of SEQ ED NO: 6. Such probe molecules may be used by those of skill in the art as markers in plant breeding methods to identify the progeny of genetic crosses.  The hybridization of the probe to the target DNA molecule can be detected by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art. These detection methods can include, but are not limited to, fluorescent tags, radioactive tags, antibody based tags, and chemiluminescent tags.<br>
[0053) As used herein, "homologous" refers to a nucleic acid sequence that will specifically hybridize to the complement of the nucleic acid sequence to which it is being compared under high stringency conditions. Appropriate stringency conditions, including those conditions of time, temperature, and salt condition, that promote DNA hybridization are known to those skilled in the art. Both temperature and salt may be varied, or either the temperature or the salt concentration may be held constant while the other variable is changed. In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment, a polynucleic acid of the present invention will specifically hybridize to one or more of the nucleic acid molecules set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, or complements thereof or fragments of either under strong to moderately stringent conditions.   In a particularly preferred embodiment, a nucleic acid of the present invention will specifically hybridize to one or more of the nucleic acid molecules set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2 or complements or fragments of either under high stringency conditions.   The hybridization of the probe to the target DNA molecule can be detected by any number of methods known to those skilled in the art, these can include, but   are   not   limited   to,   fluorescent   tags,   radioactive   tags,   antibody   based   tags,   and chemiluminescent tags.<br>
[0054]     As used herein, "amplicon" refers to the product of nucleic-acid amplification of a target nucleic acid sequence that is part of a nucleic acid template.  For example, to determine whether the maize plant resulting from a sexual cross contains transgenic event genomic DNA from the maize plant comprising exogenous LY038 DNA, DNA extracted from a maize plant tissue sample may be subjected to a nucleic acid amplification method using a DNA primer pair that includes a first primer derived from flanking sequence in the genome of the plant adjacent to the insertion site of inserted heterologous DNA, and a second primer derived from the inserted heterologous DNA to produce an amplicon that is diagnostic for the presence of the event DNA. The amplicon is of a length and has a sequence that is also diagnostic for the event.    The amplicon may range in length from the combined length of the primer pairs plus one nucleotide base pair, preferably plus about 20 nucleotide base pairs, more preferably plus about 50 nucleotide base pairs, and even more preferably plus about 150 nucleotide base pairs and more depending on the method used to detect the amplicon.    Alternatively, a primer pair can be derived from flanking sequence on both sides of the inserted DNA so as to produce an amplicon that includes the entire insert nucleotide sequence.  A member of a primer pair derived from the plant genomic sequence may be located a distance from the inserted DNA sequence.    This distance can range from one nucleotide base pair up to the limits of the amplification reaction, or about 20,000 nucleotide base pairs.  The use of the term "amplicon" specifically excludes primer dimers that may be formed in the DNA thermal amplification reaction.<br>
[ooss]     Nucleic-acid amplification can be accomplished by any of the various nucleic-acid amplification methods known in the art, including the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).   The<br><br>
sequence of the heterologous DNA insert or flanking DNA sequence from Event LY03S can be verified (and corrected if necessary) by amplifying such sequences from DNA extracted from the ATCC deposit Accession No. PTA-5623 seed or plants using DNA primers derived from the sequences provided herein followed by standard DNA sequencing of the PCR amplicon or of the cloned DNA.<br>
[0056]     Primers and probes based on the flanking genomic DNA and insert sequences disclosed herein can be used to confirm (and, if necessary, to correct) the disclosed DNA sequences by conventional methods, e.g., by re-cloning and sequencing such DNA molecules. nwsn    Amplicons produced by amplification methods may be detected by a plurality of techniques, including but not limited to gel based analyses, genetic bit analysis (Nikiforov et al., โข Nucleic Acid Res., 22:4167-4175, 1994), pyrosequencing (Winge, M., Pyrosequencing - a new approach to DNA analysis, (2000), Innovations in Pharmaceutical Technology, vol 00, 4, p!8-24), fluorescence polarization (Chen et al., Genome Res.,  9:492-498)  1999), and molecular beacons (Tyangi etal, Nature Biotech., 14:303-308, 1996).<br>
[0058]    Of particular interest to the present invention is detection by Taqmanยฎ assay (available from Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). Taqmanยฎ assay is a method of detecting and quantifying the presence of a DNA sequence that is well known in the art, and is fully described in the instructions provided by the manufacturer.    This method involves the use of PCR amplification and detection of the amplification product by hybridization using a special FRET oligonucleotide probe.   The FRET oligonucleotide probe is designed to have a 5' fluorescent reporter dye and a 3' quencher dye covalently linked to the 5' and 3' ends of the probe. The probe is designed to overlap the junction of the genomic DNA and inserted DNA.   The FRET probe and PCR primers (one primer in the exogenous transgene DNA sequence and one in the flanking genomic sequence) are cycled in the presence of a thermostable polymerase and dNTPs. Hybridization of the FRET probe results in cleavage and release of the fluorescent moiety away from the quenching moiety on the FRET probe.   A fluorescent signal indicates the presence of   โขโข the flanking/transgene insert sequence due to successful amplification and hybridization. [0059]    PCR primers preferable for use with Taqmanยฎ assay are designed (a) to have a length in the size range of 18 to 25 bases and matching sequences in the flanking genomic DNA and the transgene insertion, (b) to have a calculated melting temperature in the range of about 57 to<br><br>
about 60ยฐC, e.g., corresponding to an optimal PCR annealing temperature of about 52 to about 55ยฐC, and (c) to produce a product that includes the junction between the flanking genomic DNA and the transgene insertion and has a length in the size range of about 15 to about 250 base pairs. The PCR primers are preferably located on the locus so that the junction sequence is at least one base away from the 3' end of each PCR primer. The PCR primers must not contain regions that are extensively self- or inter-complementary.<br>
fooso] FRET probes are designed to span the sequence of the junction sequence. In a preferred embodiment, the FRET probes will have incorporated at their 3' end a chemical moiety that, when the probe is annealed to the template DNA, binds to the minor groove of the DNA, thus enhancing the stability of the probe-template complex. The probes preferably have a length in the range of about 12 to about 17 bases, and with the 3' minor groove binding moiety, have a calculated melting temperature of about 5 to about 7ยฐC above that of the PCR primers. Probe design is disclosed in U.S. Patents 5,538,848; 6,084,102; and 6,127,121.<br>
[0061]    Another assay that employs the sequences of the present invention is that of a zygosity assay. A zygosity assay is useful for determining if a plant comprising an event is homozygous for the event DNA, that is comprising the exogenous DNA in the same location on each chromosome of a chromosomal pair, or heterozygous for an event DNA, that is comprising the exogenous DNA on only one chromosome of a chromosomal pair.  In one embodiment, a three primer assay is employed wherein primer 1 hybridizes and extends specifically from the inserted exogenous DNA, primer 2 hybridizes and extends specifically from the DNA flanking the 5' side of the inserted exogenous DNA, and primer 3 hybridizes and extends specifically from the DNA flanking the 3' side of the inserted exogenous DNA.   The three primers are diagnostic for the event.   Typically, the exogenous DNA is of such a size, e.g., about 3 to about 7 kilobases or more, such that primer 1 and primer 3 no longer produce an amplicon in the PCR reaction. When the three primers are mixed together in a PCR reaction with DNA extracted from a plant homozygous for a given event, a single amplicon is produced by primer 1 and primer 2, the size and sequence of which will be indicative of and diagnostic for the event DNA.  When the three primers are mixed together in a PCR reaction with DNA extracted from a plant that does not comprise the given event, a single amplicon is produced by primer 1 and primer 3, the size and sequence of which will be indicative of and diagnostic for maize genomic DNA lacking an<br><br>
exogenous DNA. When the three primers are mixed together in a PCR reaction with DNA extracted from a plant that is heterozygous for a given event, 2 amplicons are produced: 1) an amplicon is produced by primer 1 and primer 3, the size and sequence of which wiJ] be indicative of and diagnostic for maize genornic DNA lacking an exogenous DNA, and 2) an amplicon is produced by primer 1 and primer 2, the size and sequence of which will be indicative of and diagnostic for the event DNA. Methods of detecting the various amplicons produced by the zygosity assay are known to those of skill in the art and include, but are not limited to, gel electrophoresis, TaqManยฎ assays, Southern blot, Invader Technology, sequencing, molecular beacons, pyrosequencing, and the like.<br>
[0062]     DNA detection kits can be developed using the compositions disclosed herein and the methods well known in the art of DNA detection. The kits are useful for identification of maize Event JLY038 DNA in a sample and can be applied to methods for breeding maize plants containing Event LY033 DNA.  The kits contain DNA sequences that are useful as primers or probes and that are homologous or complementary to any portion of SEQ ID NO: 1 or 2, or to DNA sequences homologous or complementary to DNA contained in any of the transgene genetic elements of pMON55221 (Figure 1) that have been inserted into a maize plant genome to form Event LY038 (Figure 2).    These DNA sequences can be used in DNA amplification methods (PCR) or as probes in polynucleic acid hybridization methods, i.e., Southern analysis, or Northern analysis.  The DNA molecule (SEQ ID NO:7) contained in the LY038 Event genome comprises the heterologous transgene genetic elements that includes a maize globulin 1 promoter (P-ZM globl), a rice actin 1 intron (I-Os actin), a maize dihydrodipicolinate synthase chloroplast transit     peptide    encoding-DNA    molecule    (Zm    DHDPS    CTP),    a    Corynebacteriwn dihydrodipicolinate  synthase-encoding  DNA   molecule   (DHDPS),   a  maize  globulin   1   3' untranslated region (T-Zm globl), and a lox P site and can be used as a template for DNA amplification, or to select homologous or complementary DNA molecules that can be used as a DNA primer or probe in a DNA detection method.  The present invention contemplates that one skiiled in the art of DNA detection can select one or more DNA molecules homologous or complementary to the transgenic DNA of SEQ ID NO: 7 that is useful in a method to detect the transgenic DNA in the genome of LY03S and progeny thereof.<br><br>
[0063] The following examples are included to demonstrate examples of certain preferred embodiments of the present invention. It should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the techniques disclosed in the examples that follow represent approaches the inventors have found function well in the practice of the present invention, and thus can be considered to constitute examples of preferred modes for its practice. However, those of skill in the art should, in light of the present disclosure, appreciate that many changes can be made in the specific embodiments that are disclosed and still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Preparation Of Transgenic Plants<br>
[oos^]    Immature embryos of maize line H99 were isolated for transformation.   Cassette DNA isolated from vector pMON55221 (see Figure 1) comprising a maize globulin 1 promoter (Kriz (1989), supra; Belanger and Kriz (1991), supra; U.S. Patent No. 6,329,574, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; bp 48 to 1440 of SEQ ID NO: 7), a rice actin 1 intron (McElroy et al. (1990), supra; bp 1448 to 1928 of SEQ ID NO: 7), a maize DHDPS chloroplast transit peptide encoding DNA molecule (Frisch et al. (1991), supra; bp 1930 to 2100 of SEQ ID NO: 7), a Coiynebacterium dihydrodipicolinate synthase encoding DNA  molecule  (Bonnassie et al. (1990), supra; Richaud et al.  (1986), supra; bp2101 to 3003 of SEQ ID NO: 7), a maize globulin 1 3' untranslated region (Belanger and Kriz (1991), supra; bp 3080 to 4079 of SEQ ID NO: 7), a lox P site (U.S. Patent 5,658,772, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety; bp4091 to 4124 of SEQ ID NO: 7), as well as a 35S promoter (Kay et al., Science, 236:1299-1302,  1987;  U.S. Patent 5,164,316), an NPTH selectable marker encoding DNA molecule (Potrykus et al. (1985), supra), a nos 3' UTR (Fraley et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U.S.A.), 80:4803-4807 (1983), supra), and a lox P site (U.S. Patent 5,658,772, specifically incorporated herein by reference in its entirety) was adhered to gold particles.   Microprojectile bombardment was used to introduce the exogenous DNA to the immature maize embryos using methods known to those of skill in the art.  Transformed cells were selected using a kanamycin selection scheme.   Kanamycin resistant calli were obtained and regenerated into several fertile, p.njc nlants using standard methods.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Breeding Scheme and Lysine Analysis<br>
foofis] Table 1 summarizes the breeding scheme and free lysine data used for the development of maize Event LY038, which exhibits high lysine in maize kernel tissue. Plants produced by the transformation method described in Example 1 were initially screened for the presence or absence of the Coiynebacterium DHDPS sequence using PCR. Taqmanยฎ assay technology was used to determine the number of copies of transgenic insertions. Plants that comprised a DNA molecule having the Coiynebacterium DHDPS sequence, operably linked as described in Example 1 and Figure 1, were allowed to reach maturity and to produce FJA seed. For FjA seed production, the primary transgenic R0 plants were crossed with a non-transgenic elite maize inbred line.<br>
[0066J    The FIA plants were screened for the presence or absence of the NPTEt sequence as evidenced by using a field scorable kanamycin resistance test.   Insensitivity to kanamycin indicated that a plant comprised and was expressing the NPTII marker gene as shown in Figure 1 and described in Example 1; these plants are referred to hereafter as NPTII-K loos?]    NPTH-t- plants were crossed with a transgenic maize line expressing a bacterial Cre recombinase to produce FIB seed. The levels of free lysine in a sample of the resulting FIB seed collected from each ear was determined.  Sibling FIB kernels exhibiting greater than about 1000 ppm free lysine were advanced to a field nursery.   FIB progeny plants were assayed by PCR and/or Southern blot to determine the presence or absence of the DHDPS gene sequence, the Cre recombinase coding sequence and the NPTII selectable marker gene sequence.    The NPTII selectable marker gene was flanked by lox P sites (recombination sites) and as such, the activjty of the Cre recombinase resulted in the excision of the NPTII coding sequence. Plants comprising the DHDPS  and Cre recombinase sequences and lacking the NPTII sequences, referred to hereafter as marker-excised plants, were allowed to self-pollinate to produce F?A seed.   Free lysine in the positive and negative FaAseed was determined.<br>
[0068) Having obtained FaA seed comprising the exogenous DHDPS gene of interest and lacking the NPTT1 selectable marker gene, it was now necessary to breed away the Cre recombinase sequences. F2Aseed from marker-excised plants were planted in the field and once again assayed by PCR and/or Southern blot to determine the presence or absence of the DHDPS gene sequence,<br><br>
the Cre recombinase coding sequence and the NPTII selectable marker gene sequence.   Plants<br>
comprising the DHDPS sequence and lacking sequences for both Cre recombinase and NPTII<br>
were selected as "positive" plants.   Sibling plants lacking the DHDPS, Cre recombinase, and<br>
NPTII sequences were selected  as "negative" plants to serve as negative controls.    Plants<br>
comprising the DHDPS sequence were self-pollinated to create Fj seed and advanced to the next<br>
generation in the field.   Likewise, negative plants lacking the DHDPS, Cre recombinase, and<br>
NPTII sequences were self-pollinated to create Fj seed.  Free lysine in the positive and negative<br>
F3 seed was determined.<br>
foes?]     Positive plants were grown in the field from F$ seed.   A single plant, determined by<br>
Taqmanยฎ assay to be homozygous, was selected and designated as LY038. F$ plants were either'<br>
A) self-pollinated to produce F^ss ears, or were B) crossed with an inbred line to produce FI^BA<br>
ears of both positive and negative selections.  Free lysine in the positive and negative F^g seed<br>
was determined.<br>
[0070]    FI-SSA seed of Event LY038 was field grown and allowed to self pollinate to produce F2B<br>
seed for which free lysine was determined.<br>
(O07i]     F4-38 seed of Event LY038 was field grown to produce F4.3g plants and either A) self<br>
pollinated to produce F5..3S seed, or B) crossed to an inbred line to produce hybrid FUSB seed<br>
used for agronomic evaluation.   FS-SB seed of Event LY038 was field grown and either A) self<br>
pollinated to produce Fg.3s seed, or B) crossed to an inbred line maize variety to produce<br>
additional hybrid Foe seed used for additional agronomic evaluation.<br>
[0072]     Deposits of the Monsanto Company maize seed of Event LY038 disclosed above was<br>
generated through the self-pollinating of FS-W plants to produce F^g seed and the self-pollinating<br>
of I76-3S plants to produce Fj^ seed.   The American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA)<br>
accession number for Event LY038 is PTA-5623.<br>
[0093]     Free lysine accumulation was monitored during the development of Event LY038 maize<br>
lines.   The lysine accumulation values are summarized in Table 1 and represent the quantity of<br>
free lysine present in the mature grain on a dry weight basis, in paits-per-million.<br>
(00741     Different methods are useful to evaluate the lysine content of mature kernels comprising<br>
Event LY038.   Other methods known the art that are useful to detect and quantitate Jysine are<br><br>
contemplated by the. inventors of the present invention to provide similar findings of an increase in lysine content of seed of LY038.<br>
[0075] Liquid chromatography-mass spectrophotometry/mass spectrophoiometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to analyze free lysine in the maize kernels of Event LY038. Individual mature maize kernel samples of Event LY038 were first weighed, ground to a fine, homogeneous powder and extracted with an extraction solvent comprising methanol, water, and formic acid. In situations where kernels were hulked, approximately 30 rag of ground powder was used. Both liquid chromatography and multiple-reaction-monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometric techniques were used to separate lysine in the sample extract. After the separation, lysine was quantified using its mass spectrometry peak area against its corresponding standard calibration curve which was prepared using a deuterated d4~lysine internal standard (IS).<br>
[0076]     In another method, lysine content of maize kernels was based upon evaluation of the free amino acids by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).  Individual maize kernels or pools of kernels of Event LY038 were ground to a fine, homogenous powder as described., and in this instance, approximately 30 mg of powder was used for analysis.    Amino acids were extracted with 5% irichloroacetic acid and amino acid detection was achieved through a pre-column primary amine derivatization with o-phthalaldehyde (OPA).  The resulting amino acid adduct, an isoindole, is hydrophobic and possesses excellent fluorescence characteristics, which can then be detected  on  a fluorescence detector.     Using reverse-phase chromatography, separation is achieved through the hydrophobicity of the R-groups located on each amino acid. To help stabilize the fluorophor, a thiol is added such as 2-mercaptoethanol (SHCHnCHaOH) or 3-mercaptopropionic acid (SHCH2CH2COOH).<br><br>

[ยซ077] Based on the experiments described here, free lysine in maize kernels that contain the LY038 construct increased between about 200% (e.g., FJB, among others) and nearly 300% (e.g., FIA). Intermediate increases in free lysine were also observed (e.g., FI-SBA).<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Determination of Flanking Sequence<br>
[0078] Genomic DNA was isolated from maize plants designated as LY038 and used in experiments to determine the maize genomic sequence flanking the transgenic DNA insert. Three different methods for determining flanking sequences and the sequence of the junction between the genomic flanking sequence and transgenic insert were used: tail PCR and the Genome Walkerโข kit from ClonTech (catalog number K1807-1, ClonTech Laboratories, Palo Alto, California), and inverse PCR.<br>
[0079J    Tail PCR is a method for isolating genomic DNA sequence flanking a known inserted sequence  which  employs   degenerative  primers  and  a  biotin  capture   step.      A   primer complementary to the exogenous DNA is used in primary PCR reactions together with a variety of degenerative primers. Typically, primers specific for the exogenous DNA and the degenerate primers were used in pairs and not in pools. The degenerate primers hybridize to some degree to the maize genomic sequence flanking the inserted DNA to allow for the generation of PCR amplicons. The primary PCR amplicons are mixed with a biotin labeled primer complementary to the transgene portion of the amplicon and allowed to anneal. The amplicons annealed to the biotin primers were captured using streptavidin and unbound amplicons were washed away. The annealed amplicons were subjected to secondary PCR reactions utilizing a nested primer which was complementary to the exogenous DNA portion of the amplicon and a variety of degenerate primers.   The PCR amplicons of the secondary PCR reaction were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and bands were cut from the gel and isolated. The isolated PCR amplicons were sequenced. The sequence of the 3' flanking genomic DNA of Event LY038 was identified using tail PCR and sequencing.<br>
10080} The Genome Walker method for isolation of flanking DNA was carried out according to manufacturer's suggested conditions. Both tail PCR and the Genome Walker Kit were used to identify the sequence of the 5' flanking DNA of Event LY038. For Genome Walker, products of<br>
the restriction enzyme Seal were amplified to produce amplicons useful for identifying the 5' flanking genotnic DNA sequence of Event LY038.<br>
toosi]     Use of the tail PCR and Genome Walker methods generated several hundred base pairs or<br>
more of DNA sequence flanking the insertion site of the DNA construct in Event LY038.<br>
Inverse PCR and bioinformatic analysis and comparison to maize genomic DNA sequence<br>
databases were used to obtain additional genomic DNA flanking these events.    Using the<br>
combined methods, the flanking sequences are identified in the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 1, 2,<br>
9, and 10.   A maize plant is an aspect of the present invention when that maize plant contains<br>
within its genome a DNA molecule that can be used as a template in a DNA amplification<br>
reaction to provide an amplicon comprising a junction DNA molecule described in the present<br>
invention, wherein the junction DNA molecule is diagnostic for corn Event LY038 DNA in a<br>
DNA sample extracted from a maize tissue sample.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Event Specific Primer and Probe Assay Information<br>
(oo82j    For each event, PCR primers and probes useful in a Taqmanยฎ assay were designed,<br>
namely SEQ ID NOs: 3 and 4.  Using the PCR primers having the sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 3<br>
and 4, in a Taqmanยฎ assay resulted in an amplicon diagnostic for Event LY038; the amplicon<br>
has the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 6, and the probe useful for the detection of this amplicon has<br>
the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 5.    When the primers and probes were subjected to the PCR<br>
conditions outlined in Table 2, a fluorescent signal indicated that amplicons were produced that<br>
were detected by the probe.    By inclusion of the appropriate control samples, for example,<br>
various negative and positive DNA controls, it was shown that the PCR primers and probes were<br>
specific for the intended event.<br>
[oosa]    In addition to the primer and probe set, any primer and probe sets derived from SEQ ID<br>
NO: 1 or 2, specific for Event LY038 DNA that when used in a PCR amplification reaction<br>
produce a DNA amplicon diagnostic for Event LY038 DNA are an aspect of the present<br>
invention and are readily prepared by those of skill in the art.   PCR conditions to produce a<br>
Taqmanยฎ assay diagnostic for Event LY038 DNA are included in Table 2.<br>
[0084]     One skilled in the art would include the appropriate control samples when performing the<br>
PCR or Taqmanยฎ assays described in the present invention.   The inclusion of positive control<br><br>
DNA samples, negative control DNA samples, and other controls are appropriate and aid in the interpretation of results. In addition, the person of ordinary skill in the art would know how to prepare internal control primers and probes for the Taqrnanยฎ PCR reaction using published, standard methods (as published by, for example, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California). One skilled would also realize that the particular primer sequences, probes, and reaction conditions specified herein may be modified and produce an assay which is diagnostic for Event LY038 DNA. Additionally, one skilled in the art would know that the products of the PCR reaction may be analyzed by gel electrophoresis for analysis.<br>

A Internal control primer and probe combinations may be made to a wide variety of genes or genomic regions, the design of which is known to those of skill in the art.<br>
[0085] Deposits of the Monsanto Company maize seed representive of Event LY038 disclosed above have been made under the Budapest Treaty with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 10801 University Boulevard, Manassas, Va. 20110. The ATCC accession number for Event LY038 is PTA-5623. The deposit will be maintained in the depository for a period of 30 years, or 5 years after the last request, or for the effective life of the patent, whichever is longer, and will be replaced as necessary during that period.<br>
[oosfl Having illustrated and described the principles of the present invention, it should be apparent to persons skilled in the art that the present invention can be modified in arrangement and detail without departing from such principles. We claim all modifications that are within the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
I/Wc Claim:<br>
1. A DNA construct comprising SEQ ID NO: 7, wherein said DNA construct comprises a maize globulin I promoter, a rice actin 1 intron, a maize DHDPS chloroplast transit peptide encoding DNA molecule, a Corynehacterium DHDPS encoding DNA molecule, a maize globulin 1 3' untranslated region and a lox P site.<br>
2. An isolated DNA molecule comprising the polynucleotide as set forth in SEQ ID NO; 1, 2. 5, or 11, wherein said polynucleotide is flanking sequence of the DNA construct as claimed in claim 1, wherein the flanking sequence is present in the transgenic maize event LY038.<br></td>
