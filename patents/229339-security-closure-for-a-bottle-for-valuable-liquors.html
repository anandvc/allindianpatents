				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a security closure for a bottle for valuable liquors.<br>
As is known, in the case of bottles for valuable liquors there is a serious need for the security closure to prevent unauthorized refilling of the bottle with poor-quality liquors when the original valuable liquor it held has been finished.<br>
When seeking to fill the bottle in this way, the unauthorized person, being unable to refill the bottle through the pouring body because of the presence of the antifilling valve, is obliged to force the pouring body out, complete with the antifilling valve, by separating it from the sleeve to which it is joined around the join line.<br>
With known closures this forcing out of the pouring body from the sleeve is sometimes possible and it is also possible to then reassemble the pouring body and sleeve, one juxtaposed on the other, so that they again appear to form the original one-piece component. As a result, when he pours the drink out, the user may not notice the unauthorized refilling of the bottle.<br>
The problem dealt with by the present invention is how to devise a security closure of the specified type whose structural and functional characteristics are such as to overcome the abovementioned drawback.<br>
This problem is solved by a security closure of the specified type that is characterized in that the join line comprises an annular seat and a lip engaged in the annular seat.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides security closure for a bottle for valuable liquors, comprising a pouring body containing an antifilling valve, a sleeve having means for snap fastening it to the bottle, a join line formed by ultrasonic welding between the sleeve and the pouring body, a stopper cap screwed onto the pouring body and a security seal between the stopper cap and the sleeve, characterized in that the join line comprises an annular seat and a lip engaged in the annular seat.<br>
Other features and advantages of the security closure according to the present invention will become clear in the following description of a preferred embodiment thereof, given by way of a non restrictive<br><br>
example with reference to     accompanying figures, in which:<br>
-	Figure 1 is an elevation, in partial section, of a security closure according to the present invention,<br>
-	Figure 2 is an elevation in section and on an enlarged scale of a detail of the closure of Figure 1, and<br>
-	Figure 3 is a view in perspective and in section of a detail of the closure shown in Figure 1.<br>
With reference to the accompanying figures, the numeral 1 denotes in a general way a security closure for a bottle 2.<br>
The bottle 2, which is intended to contain -valuable liquors, comprises a neck 3, a rim 4, a collar 5, which defines a downward facing shoulder 6, and a grooved profile 7.<br>
The security closure 1 comprises a pouring body 8 that contains an antifilling valve 9, the latter being known per se. The pouring body 8 abuts against the rim 4 of the bottle 2.<br>
The pouring body 8 is provided with a nondrip edge 10, an external screw thread- -11 and a flange 12, which projects outwards from the neck 3 of the bottle 2,<br>
The security closure 1 additionally comprises a sleeve 13 that fits around the neck 3 of the bottle 2 and possesses an upper end 14, snap-fastening means 15 for fastening the sleeve to the shoulder 6 and a grooved internal profile 16 complementary to the grooved profile 7 of the neck of the bottle.<br>
The security closure 1 additionally comprises a stopper cap 17 that is formed by a top 18 and by a tubular skirt 19.<br>
The stopper cap 17 has an internal thread 2 0 formed in an inner cap 21 which is force-fitted inside the stopper cap 17. The internal thread 2 0 is complementary with the external thread 11 of the pouring body 8, and is screwed onto the latter.<br>
The security closure 1 additionally comprises a security seal bearing the general reference 22, which<br><br>
acts between the tubular skirt 19 of the stopper cap iv and the sleeve 13.<br>
The security seal 22, which is known per se, comprises an annular band 23, made of plastic and approximately C-sectioned, which embraces a collar 24 projecting from the tubular skirt 19 of the stopper cap 17 and a collar 25 projecting from the sleeve 13. The annular band 23 has a tab 2 6 to enable it to be torn off.<br>
The annular band 23 is embraced by a tearable aluminium strip 27 which is torn and removed when pulling off the annular band.<br>
In the security closure 1 according to the present invention, the pouring body 8 and the sleeve 13 are connected by a join line 28 that is formed between the flange 12 of the pouring body and the upper end 14 of the sleeve. The join is welded together ultrasonically. The join line 28 includes an annular seat 29 formed in the flange 12 and a lip 3 0 projecting from the upper end 14 of the sleeve 13.<br>
The annular seat .29 has a bottom 31 and two opposing walls, an outward wall 32 and an inward wall 33.<br>
The lip 3 0 has a summit 3-4 and two opposing faces, an outward face 35 and an inward face 36.<br>
The summit 34 of the lip 30 is placed against the bottom 31 of the annular seat 29.<br>
A space 37 of predetermined limited thickness, for example two tenths of mm, is formed between the outward wall 32 of the annular seat 29 and the outward face 35 of the lip 30. Similarly, a space 38, also of predetermined limited thickness, for example two tenths of mm, is formed between the inward wall 3 3 of the annular seat 29 and the inward face 36 of the lip 30.<br>
It should be observed that the lip 3 0 is discontinuous, owing to the presence of a succession of gaps 3 9 and blocks 40, that alternate at regular angular intervals and, in the example, number eight gaps and eight blocks.<br>
The lip 3 0 consequently gives a crenellated appearance, and the summit 34 is subdivided into separate<br><br>
ridges 4l..<br>
When the pouring body, is being joined by ultrasonic welding to the sleeve, the join is formed between the bottom 31 of the annular seat and the summit 34 of the lip, or more precisely of its ridges 41.<br>
It should be observed that during the ultrasonic welding, the localised fusing of the opposing materials produces a weld bead between the summit 34 and the bottom 31. This weld bead invades the spaces 37 and 38, producing a welded zone, between the pouring body and the sleeve, that extends not only along the zone of contact between the ridges 41 and the bottom 31 but also into the spaces 37 and 38.<br>
It should also be observed that the welded zone too is discontinuous, because of the discontinuity of the lip.<br>
Should an unauthorized attempt be made to force the pouring body off the sleeve, the unauthorized person will have difficulty overcoming the join line so that the separation between the pouring body and the sleeve will occur along a continuous break line. The break line will likewise appear discontinuous, with alternating breaks between the pouring body and the sleeve, and consequently with portions of the one remaining attached to the other and vice versa, in alternation, giving the break line a thoroughly j agged appearance.<br>
Any juxtaposition of the two fractured parts will therefore clearly reveal the attempt to conceal the break.<br>
The chief advantage of the security closure of the present invention is that it makes any unauthorized attempt to refill the bottle very obvious.<br>
A further advantage of the security closure of the present invention is the fact that it is structurally simple, no small advantage for an item that must be mass produced.<br>
Obviously, in order to satisfy specific needs that may arise, a person skilled in the art will be able to make many modifications to and variants of  the<br><br>
]<br>
