				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a device for the detection of particles suspended in a fluid. The invention is suitable for mounting on ducting for the early detection of smoke created by unwanted pyrolysis or combustion of materials in a protected area or fire zone to which the duct is connected.<br>
The ducting may be ventilation or air-conditioning ducting used in controlling the temperature and/or quality of air in the protected area.<br>
The invention, equally may be free standing or provided in an open environment, that is, the invention does not require duct mounting. The examples disclosed are provided by way of explanation of the invention, only, and duct mounting is merely one preferred embodiment. The scope of the invention should not be so limited.<br>
Duct mounted smoke detectors take a small sample of air passing through an air duct such as a ventilator shaft and are intended to detect the presence of smoke in the sample and thereby raise an alarm if the concentration of smoke exceeds a predetermined value indicative of the presence of a fire in the protected area.<br>
Presently, conventional point type smoke detectors, primarily designed for ceiling installation in a protected area, are used for ducted mounting. The detector is mounted inside a sealed housing to be mounted external to a duct, the housing is fitted with a pair of straight tubular probes which are fitted inside the duct and adapted to draw a continuous small sample of air from the duct interior and to pass the sample or part thereof through the adjacent detector.<br>
Difficulties arise if the smoke is significantly diluted as a result of large volumes of air passing through the duct. Faced with this dilution, it has been found that such detectors have insufficient sensitivity to provide a warning that is appropriately early for life safety. Moreover, although a bug screen and dust filter is often included to protect the detector from soiling, this is generally inadequate<br><br>
inherently unreliable due to moisture condensation, soiling and false alarms caused by dust, and are generally acknowledged to have an unsatisfactory service life measured only in months.<br>
To overcome these disadvantages, high-sensitivity aspirated smoke detectors have been employed for duct monitoring. These detectors provide a sensitivity some hundreds of times greater than conventional, point detectors, thereby overcoming the smoke dilution.<br>
The suction pressure available from the aspirator (air pump) can overcome the restriction of the dust filter, enabling a more efficient filter to be employed thereby avoiding unwanted dust pollution and possible false alarms.<br>
Aspirated smoke detection has already been improved over many years by the inventor as described in his Australian patent numbers 575845, 3184384, 4229885, 3023684, 3184184, 3453784, 3400593, 8070891, 2774692, 4050493 and 4050393, with corresponding patents overseas including Western Europe, North America, Japan and New Zealand.<br>
An aspirated smoke detector employs an aspirator to draw a continuous sample of air through a dust filter and the smoke detection chamber. This aspirator may also draw samples of smoke from a ventilation duct, or alternatively through pipework for long distances.<br>
In the case of pipework, this is of small bore and is often mounted on a ceiling with sampling holes drilled at regular intervals, enabling samples of air to be actively drawn from throughout the protected area. By contrast, conventional types of smoke detector rely upon convection currents or air draughts to passively draw the smoke through the detector chamber.<br>
Whether intended for a duct or pipework application, ideally the smoke detector employed within an aspirated smoke detection system is a nephelometer. This is a detector that is sensitive to all sizes of smoke particles produced in fires, or during the early stages of overheating, pyrolysis or smouldering (which usually occurs for at least an hour prior to the appearance of flame).<br>
Optical type smoke (or airborne particle) detectors of the prior art typically use a single light source (or projector) to illuminate a detection zone that may<br><br>
contain such particles. A proportion of this light may be scattered off the particles towards a single receiver cell (or sensor) that is positioned to provide acceptable detection performance. Improved versions of the prior art include one or more additional sensors positioned to receive light scattered in different direction(s). The output signals from these two or more sensors are utilised for the purpose of providing further information about the particle size, or the average size of a group of particles. A disadvantage of this prior art is that it uses a source of light having a single wavelength, and is insensitive to the small particles produced in flaming fires.<br>
Other detection techniques use a laser beam, providing a polarised monochromatic light source, typically in the near infrared wavelength. Such detectors are prone to having a high sensitivity to large particles, at the expense of having low sensitivity to small particles (that is, smaller than the wavelength of light). Thus a laser-based detector does not operate as a true nephelometer. This disadvantage can be reduced by the use of a plurality of receiving sensors positioned to detect light scattered at various angles and polarisations, but only one light wavelength is used.<br>
Some aspirated smoke detectors have used a single laser diode beam but this suffers the same disadvantage of using a single wavelength and has low sensitivity to smoke from flaming fires. Other disadvantages of using aspirated detectors lie in terms of high cost, energy consumption, complexity and size.<br>
The disadvantage exhibited by all of the above prior art whether aspirated or not, namely their insensitivity to small particles characteristic of flaming fires, has in many instances demanded the installation of additional ionisation type smoke detectors. These detectors utilise a radioactive element such as Americium, to ionise the air within a chamber. The conductivity of this chamber is reduced when smoke particles displace ionised air, causing an alarm to be operated. Such detectors are sensitive to the small particles produced in flaming fires but are insensitive to the large particles produced in pyrolysis or smouldering. These detectors are also prone to false alarms caused by draughts which similarly displace ionised air. Accordingly the insensitivity to incipient fires<br><br>
and the propensity toward false alarms renders ionisation type detectors an unacceptable alternative.<br>
Other, aspirated smoke detectors have used a Xenon lamp as the single light source that produces a continuous light spectrum similar to sunlight, embracing ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. Use of this continuous spectrum can detect particles of all sizes and produce a signal that is proportional to the mass density of smoke, which is hitherto the most reliable measure of fire development. Although this can function as a true nephelometer, it does not characterise the type of fire. A disadvantage is the inability to select particular wavelengths unless a complex, costly and comparatively unreliable system of mechanically moving colour filters is used. Further disadvantages of this technique are the service life of the Xenon lamp which is typically limited to 4 years, the variation in light intensity and the costly high voltage power supply required.<br>
Other prior art has used two light sources. GB 2193570 by Kane &amp; Ludlow (5-10-1980), for example, describes the use of one laser beam to detect the size and sphericity of airborne particles, requiring no less than five accurately positioned sensors. A second laser beam of the same wavelength is used to gate on and off the first laser, according to the presence of a single particle in the field of view. This second laser is used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the system, but not to determine the particle size or sphericity. Such a system is too costly for the high-volume fire alarms industry.<br>
As another example, US 4426640 by Beconsall et al. (5-8-1986) describes a pollutant gas detector using two light sources but this is not an airborne particle counter. This uses a first laser operating at the absorption wavelength of the gas to be detected, and a second laser operating at a reference wavelength which is necessarily similar, but not identical to the absorption wavelength. The two laser beams are projected to "infinity" through the atmosphere (surrounding a chemical plant) and the relative intensity of the signals received at each wavelength provides a measure of the concentration of the pollutant gas.<br>
It would be understood that the type of smoke produced in various pyrolysis and combustion circumstances is different.   Fast flaming fires tend to<br><br>
produce a very large number of very small solid particles which may agglomerate into random shapes to form soot. In contrast, the early stages of pyrolysis tend to produce a much smaller number of quite large liquid particles (of high boiling point), typically existing as aerosols that may agglomerate to form larger, translucent spheres.<br>
It has been found that the detection of large particles which slowly increase in quantity over an extended period of time would indicate a pyrolysis or smouldering condition, requiring some attention.<br>
Alternatively, the detection of numerous small particles arising quickly and without an earlier pyrolysis or smouldering period, would tend to indicate arson where accelerants have been used and the need for immediate action. An ability to distinguish between these extremes would assist the building operator, fire brigade or automatic fire alarm system in determining the appropriate response to the threat.<br>
Another aspect of the prior art is its susceptibility to dust. Dust is important in two ways, firstly, airborne dust is generally interpreted by the detector as smoke, so elevated dust levels can cause false fire alarms. Secondly, even if discrimination means was used to reduce the rate of false alarms, there remains the problem of soiling. Soiling is the slow build-up of dust within the detector. This can affect the reliability of the detector by reducing its sensitivity to smoke and/or by reducing its safety margin against false alarms. The service life of a detector is principally governed by soiling which consequently requires regular maintenance. A detector that can minimise soiling and can discriminate against smoke particles would be of advantage. Moreover, in certain applications the ability to identify the presence of dust could be used to monitor the cleanliness of an area. This particular role has hitherto required the use of very expensive dust particle counters as used in the microchip fabrication industry which are highly prone to soiling when applied to office type environments.<br>
A smoke and/or dust detector that is rugged, of small size and of lightweight would be anjadyantagejpr applications in the aerospace industry.<br><br>
OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide a smoke detector device having the ability to detect a wide range of particle sizes and to discriminate between different kinds of smoke or dust according to particle size. The smoke detector device is suitable for mounting onto an air conduit or ventilation duct. It is an objective to provide a smoke detector and a detection system having a relatively long service life with relatively long intervals between servicing.<br>
It is an objective to provide a smoke detection system of relatively high sensitivity capable of use without an aspirator. STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>

In a sixth aspect of the invention the sample air may be drawn directly from the duct or tube into the smoke detector device wherein the duct or tube is formed with a venturi construction to generate sufficient relative pressure between the detector chamber and the duct.<br>
In essence, one aspect of the present invention comes about having realised that more than one wavelength of light is required to detect a more complete range of particle sizes and types of fire, and to discriminate among them. Another aspect of the present invention has importantly found that determining particle concentration, size and / or range(s) over a period of time can give a very good indication of whether an alarm condition has been met or is warranted. Yet another aspect of the present invention stems from having at least two sources of light illuminating a particle detection zone and a detection means providing an output signal indicative of a predetermined condition of the particle detection zone. Having two sources of light enables particle size discrimination to be achieved while using no more than one receiving sensor. Yet a further aspect of the present invention is the recognition of dust particles for the monitoring of dust levels or for the avoidance of false fire alarms. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
In general terms, the present invention seeks to detect airborne particles<br>
and/or to provide discrimination according to particle size using apparatus that<br>
has low cost, small size, low weight, high ruggedness, high reliability, low<br>
maintenance and long service life, and is suitable for high production volumes.<br>
This is achieved with the use of only a single sensor, together with at least two<br><br>
inexpensive light sources. Use of a single sensor and its associated electronic amplifier necessarily designed for high sensitivity with low noise, simplifies the design and reduces the cost of the system. It also avoids any lack of consistency that could occur in the sensitivity and linearity of additional sensors and it avoids the possibility of the incremental addition of noise contributions from plural sensors.<br>
Discrimination of airborne particle size could be achieved in a number of ways. The two or more light sources may differ in wavelength, polarisation, position (specifically the solid angle of incidence to the detection zone axis), or a combination of these.<br>
In the preferred embodiment of the invention, two light emitting diodes (LED's) operating at different wavelengths are employed. This permits the use of wavelengths as distant as 430nm (blue) and 880nm (infrared) such that the wavelengths are separated by a full octave. Such a large difference in wavelength can produce a significantly different strength of signal when light of alternate wavelength is scattered off particles toward the sensor. Alternative combinations such as 430nm (blue) with 660nm (red) are possible. Closer-spaced wavelengths such as 525nm (green) with 660nm (red) could be used, accompanied by a reduction in size discrimination and sensitivity to small particles.<br>
It is known from Ravleiah theory that the intensity of the scattered light reduces according to the fourth power of wavelength, for particles smaller than the wavelength of light. This has proven relevant to smoke detection in experiments using Xenon lamps which produce a complete spectrum embracing infrared, visible and ultraviolet wavelengths, where it was found that wavelengths in the blue region are necessary for the detection of certain kinds of fires liberating small particles.<br>
Therefore, a particular advantage of being able to employ a blue light source is that its short wavelength provides high resolution of small particles that become invisible at longer wavelengths. Whereas a blue or violet laser diode may be preferable to a blue LED, the former are expensive, have increased alignment complexity, require automatic power control and have a lower tolerance<br><br>
of elevated temperatures. The combination of readily available red and infrared laser diodes could be used, but in addition to the difficulties presented by using lasers, these longer wavelengths fail to adequately resolve small particles.<br>
Accordingly the preferred embodiment of the invention is configured to utilise the broad beam spread of a high-intensity LED (approx 12 deg). Although the broad spread of the LED beam could be confined by focusing with a lens, this adds cost, complexity in alignment and size to the product. Whereas the LED does not have the localised high light intensity of a collimated laser beam, the aggregate intensity of the LED light scattered from the large volume of the detection zone when integrated on the sensor is of comparable magnitude. Therefore the sensitivity of the LED based system is comparable with laser, but the cost is reduced without compromising reliability.<br>
Nevertheless, the same invention could be configured to use laser diodes as alternative light sources of differing wavelength, polarisation or position (angle). Such arrangements can provide particle size discrimination also, but at a higher cost and greater temperature intolerance than LED designs.<br>
The ability to use LED's is achieved by the novel configuration of the optical chamber which accommodates the broad projector beam angle of each LED, opposite a specially designed light trap located beyond the detection zone, to completely absorb the remnant projected light, thereby preventing its detection at the sensor. The chamber also contains a further light trap opposite the sensor and beyond the detection zone, to eliminate stray projected light from being detected. Thus the signal-to-noise ratio caused by remnant projected light compared with the detected scattered light, is maximised to ensure very high sensitivity of the system. This is further ensured by the close mutual proximity of the LED's and the sensor to the detection zone, so that inverse-square light intensity losses are minimised. Moreover, a lens is preferably used in conjunction with the sensor to gather scattered light from throughout the detection zone while minimising visibility of chamber wall surfaces as a result of focusing. Control irises are used to further minimise stray light reaching the sensor. Through the combination of all these methods the system sensitivity is on the order of 0.01 to 0.1 %/m equivalent smoke obscuration.<br><br>
It should be noted that the ability to utilise a broad projector beam enables the use of laser diodes without costly collimation optics.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the invention, each light source is pulsed in sequence for a short period such as 10mS. At the sensor, a signal is generated in response to each pulse of scattered light at each wavelength. The system is pre-calibrated to account for the sensitivity of the sensor at each wavelength, preferably by adjusting the intensity of the LED projections during manufacture. The signals are amplified using digital filtering to improve the signal-to noise ratio, and both the absolute and relative amplitudes of the pulse signals are stored. The absolute value indicates the particle concentration whereas the relative value indicates the particle size or the average size of a group of particles. From Rayleigh theory, at a given mass concentration of airborne particles, the long wavelength light will produce a low amplitude signal in the case of small particles, or a large amplitude signal in the case of large particles. The short wavelength light will produce a relatively equal amplitude signal in the case of both small and large particles. By comparing the ratio of the signals it is therefore possible to determine whether the particles are large or small.<br>
Signals produced over a period of time are analysed according to trend. A slow increase in the concentration of large particles is indicative of pyrolysis and eventually a smouldering condition. Alternatively, a rapid increase in small particles is indicative of a fast flaming fire and, in the absence of a prior period of pyrolysis and smouldering, could indicate the involvement of accelerants (such as with arson). This information is used to produce separate alarm outputs in the case of smouldering and flaming fires, or alternatively, to reduce the alarm activation threshold (i.e. provide earlier warning) in the case of flaming fires (which are more dangerous).<br>
It should be noted that the concentration of smoke alone, does not necessarily indicate the level of danger of an incipient fire. The concentration detected will depend upon the degree of smoke dilution by fresh air, and the proximity of the incipient fire to the detector. By characterising the smoke in accordance with our invention it becomes possible to determine the level of<br><br>
smoke concentration necessary for an alarm, that is appropriate to the protected environment, thereby providing early warning with minimum false alarms. Moreover, the low cost of the system encourages its comprehensive use throughout a facility.<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention, particle size discrimination is used to determine the airborne dust content for the purpose of avoiding false alarms or for dust level monitoring within the protected environment. Two LED's may be used, but by the use of additional LED's it is possible to discriminate within differing particle size ranges.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, and referring to Figure 1, the smoke detector housing 10 is produced by the molding of two substantially identical halves 10a, 10b (see Figure 4). Two LED lamps 11 are positioned to project light across the detection chamber 12 into a region that is viewed by the sensor 13. Smoke 14 is drawn across the chamber 12 in the direction of arrows 15 so that it can be irradiated by the projectors 11 in sequence. Some light 16 scattered off the airborne smoke particles is captured by a focussing lens 17 onto the receiving sensor 13.<br>
A series of optical irises 18 confine the spread of the projector beams and another series of irises 19 confine the field of view of the sensor 13. An absorber gallery 39/40 (light trap) is provided opposite each projector 11 to absorb essentially all of the remaining essentially unscattered light and thereby prevent any swamping of the scattered light 16 at the sensor 13 by the projected light. A further light trap 20 is provided opposite the sensor to further ensure that essentially no projector light is able to impinge on the sensor.<br>
The smoke detector housing 10 preferably incorporates pipework 21 to provide airflow through the detector chamber 12. This pipework 21 may incorporate a nozzle 22 opposite a collector 23, to direct the airflow across the chamber 12, such that the chamber is quickly purged of smoke in the event that the smoke level is reducing. Included in the pipework pathway is a dust filter 33. Coupling to the dust filter cavity is by inlet and outlet diffusers 24, 25 designed to<br><br>
minimise head loss (pressure drop) in the airflow through the detector, and to facilitate the use of a large filter 33 for long service life. Over a period of years, a small quantity of fine dust may pass through the filter. To prevent or minimise soiling, the arrangement of the nozzle and collector is such as to minimise deposition of dust on the chamber walls and optical surfaces.<br>
Figures 1b and 1c illustrate alternative positioning of the light source(s) 11 of Figure 1a. This has necessitated the re-positioning of the light trap 39,40. In many other respects, the features of figures 1b and 1c are identical to the illustration of Figure 1 and the accompanying description. Figures 1b and 1c do not show all the detail of Figure 1a, only as a matter of clarity. It is to be noted that Figures 1b and 1c allow for backscatter detection or a combination of back and forward scatter i.e. different angles.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a sectional elevation view taken along line 2-2 of the smoke detector body of Figure 1. Again, many features shown in figure 1a are numbered identically. Figure 2 indicates the preferred position of the main electronics printed circuit board PCB1 for efficient and low-interference electrical connection to the projecting light sources and the receiving sensor including its pre-amplifier printed circuit board PCB2. Conveniently the upper half of the smoke detector body 10b may be removed without disturbing the connections to PCB1 for the purposes of setup and maintenance.<br>
Referring to figure 3, there is shown a cross-sectional view taken along line 3-3 of Figure 1 and showing the gas sample inlet pipework including socket and bends.<br>
A cross-sectional view taken on line 4-4 of Figure 1 shows its filter chamber and is represented in Figure 4. The filter element is preferably of open-cell foam construction with a relatively large filter pore size such as 0.1mm. This causes dust particles to be arrested progressively throughout the large depth of the element. Use of such a large pore size means that smoke particles are not arrested in the filter, even when the filter becomes loaded with dust, which if it occurred would reduce the sensitivity of the detector to smoke. This element is easily removed for cleaning or renewal.<br><br>
In Figure 5, there is a sectional view taken long line 5-5 of the smoke detector body of Figure 6. This indicates how the detector body and the detector housing are secured with screws, and in exploded view shows where the housing may be attached to the duct such as a circular ventilation duct (which is more challenging than a flat-sided duct). For example, attachment may be achieved by screws, magnets or adhesive tape.<br>
Figure 6 illustrates a sectional view taken on line 6-6 of figure 5 of the smoke detector body. Figure 1a also shows line 6-6. In Figure 6 a view of the outer casing, mounted on a pcb PCB1, together with a gasket 31 is shown. This particular arrangement is suitable for mounting to a duct, although the present invention should not be limited to only such an application.<br>
Figure 7 is an end view of the inlet/outlet gas port to the smoke detector body showing gasket 31 in plan view. This gasket provides a releasable seal to a duct such as a round ventilation duct of unspecified radius<br>
The following description relates to one preferred arrangement of the invention, and with reference to Figures 8, 8a, 8b, 8c and 9. It is to be noted that the following description equally applies to the alternative high volume and low volume embodiments shown in Figures 11a, 11b, 12a to 12k, and 13a and 13b. The same numeral references have been used in the various figures to avoid duplication. The high volume embodiment is used when fluid flow in the duct is relatively high. Thus the inlet and outlet openings 28 and 29, respectively are designed to be smaller, so with a high volume of fluid flow, a smaller sample area is captured and substantially the same volume of fluid to the detector of the present invention. Equally, the low volume embodiment is designed with relatively larger openings 28 and 29, as the fluid flow is lower, a larger opening is provided to present substantially the same amount of fluid flow to the detector of the present invention.<br>
The pipework is configured with appropriate bends and sockets suitable for attachment to a probe 26, which draws smoke from the ventilation duct 27. The probe 26 is preferably of unit construction containing an inlet port 28 and an outlet port 29, so that only one penetration hole 30 need be cut into the duct wall to provide access for the probe 26.  This hole is releasably sealed using a closed-<br><br>
cell foam gasket 31 to prevent leakage. Figure 8 shows a view along line C-C from Figure 8b. Figure 12a also shows a view along line C-C of Figures 12c and 12h. Figure 8a shows a view along line D-D of Figure 8. Figure 12 b shows a view along line D-D of Figure 12a for the high volume embodiment. Figure 12g shows a view along line D-D of Figure 12a for the low volume embodiment. Figure 8b shows a sectional view along line E-E of Figure 8 indicating that it comprises a stem with a detachable head. Figures 12c and 12h show, respectively, high volume and low volume embodiments of the probe viewed along line E-E of figure 12a. Figure 8c shows a view along line F-F. Figures 12e and 12j show plan views of the, respective, high volume and low volume probes. Figures 12d and 121 show sectional views of the heads of the, respective high and low volume probes.<br>
The probe 26 is suitable for being inserted into a duct by requiring only a single round penetration of the duct. The probe is inserted so that its inlet faces upstream and its outlet faces downstream. The probe is designed to provide an adequate airflow rate through the detection chamber 12, driven by the dynamic head associated with the airflow in the ventilation duct 27. This dynamic head produces a pressure drop across the inlet port 28 and outlet port 29 of the probe 26, sufficient to overcome the combined restriction of the detection chamber 12, pipework 21 and dust filter 33. The efficiency of the probe is maximised by the use of rounding of the inlet orifice followed by a bend to change the direction of the sampled flow with minimum loss. This is repeated at the outlet. The inlet and outlet bends are incorporated without any requirement to enlarge the duct penetration. This high efficiency enables the use of an effective dust filter to ensure a long service interval for the product, such as 10 years in a typical office environment. Given such a long interval, it is considered appropriate (but not essential) that the detector body 10 can be easily dismantled for cleaning and re-calibration, avoiding the need for a removable filter cartridge that is costly and difficult to make airtight. The high efficiency of the probe also facilitates its use in ventilation ducts operating at relatively low air velocity such as 4m/sec. For use at low ventilation duct velocities, an alternative probe head is provided. This uses an  enlarged  air  scoop  design  which   incorporates  a   diffuser to  efficiently<br><br>
accelerate the inlet air and ensure that the detector's rapid response to smoke is maintained.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, with reference to Figures 8b<br>
and 9, the probe 26 is constructed with an elliptical or similar cross-section that<br>
will minimise drag (to minimise restriction to flow in the ventilation duct), as well<br>
as minimising forced vibration at the Strouhal frequency caused by the duct flow.<br>
In the particular embodiment illustrated by Figures 8b and 9, the aerodynamic<br>
coefficient of drag is reduced by a factor of ten compared with a pair of round<br>
pipes of similar dimensions.   Figures 12b to 12 k show similar features, but in<br>
respect of the high and low volume probes. The advantages of using an elliptical<br>
shape instead of an aerofoil are that the probe may be installed in either direction,<br>
and that the overall width of the probe is reduced, without unduly compromising<br>
the reduction in drag. By the addition of further stem sections, the probe 26 may<br>
be extended in length to meet the needs of different sized ductwork, ensuring<br>
adequate flow without the need of an aspirator. The pressure inside the duct 27<br>
can be significantly different from the ambient atmosphere outside the duct<br>
(where the detector is usually mounted). In a preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention best shown in figures 1 and 6, the halves of the chamber are releasably<br>
joined in an airtight manner by means of only one continuous O-ring seal 34. This<br>
sets the detector chamber internal pressure to approximate that of the ventilation<br>
duct and avoids any leakage to or from ambient atmosphere.<br>
Leakage into the detector could cause an unwanted alarm from smoke in the ambient environment. Leakage of smoke from the detector to the ambient environment could cause an unwanted alarm in other smoke detection equipment protecting that environment.<br>
Alternatively, with reference to figure 10 if a relatively small duct or pipe is used such that the probe in inappropriate, then this duct may be configured to produce a venturi which develops the necessary pressure drop to ensure an adequate flow rate through the detector chamber, filter and pipework. Again only a small proportion of the smoke need be passed through the detector and this proportion is minimised in order to minimise the rate of detector soiling and filter loading, thereby to maximise the service interval.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
