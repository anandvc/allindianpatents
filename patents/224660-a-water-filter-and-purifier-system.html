This invention relates to a water filter and purifier system, which is operable electrically and non-electrically.<br>
Water filter and purifiers using carbon filtration cartridge and ultra violet ray irradiation chamber are known in the art. 'Aquaguard' ,a popular brand uses both activated carbon filtration and UV irradiation for filtering and disinfecting water for drinking. Many household and commercial establishments have water purifier cum disinfecting units to ensure safe drinking water supply. Such units are electrically and electronically operated and are found to be effective. However, non-availability of power and frequent power failures interrupts constant supply of safe drinking water and the user has to wait till power supply is resumed. This draw back necessitates the development of a water filter and purifier system capable of delivering continuous drinking water supply even in the event of power failure.<br>
The system developed by us consists of three main parts. They are the housing for the filtration and purification modules with their interconnecting tubes and electrical and<br>
electronic circuits for activation and operation of the system. Housing of the components<br>
      may be suitably designed to provide better aesthetics to prevent mishandling of components within and to avoid dust accumulation particularly on the electronic components. The housing also avoids any electrical hazard to the user.<br>
The filtration and purification modules housed within the housing has the following major components.<br>
a)	sediment filtration module<br>
b)	carbon filration module containing activated carbon<br>
c)	a UV module for ultraviolet radiation disinfection<br>
d)	a connector<br><br><br>
e)	solenoid Valve<br>
f)	water flow controller<br>
g)	resin cartridge<br>
h)	PCB<br>
a)	Sediment filtration module consists of a porous filter element housed in a suitable casing provided with a water inlet port and a water outlet port.   The inlet port is connected to a source of water supply and the outlet port is connected to a connector. This sediment filter module removes suspended physical impurities such as dust and the like before water enters carbon filtration module.<br>
b)	Carbon filtration module contains activated carbon for absorption of organic impurities and chemicals such as chlorine and iodine from water which flows through it fi'om the sedimentation filter module. From this module, water passes to the UV irradiation module.<br>
c)	UV chamber is provided with means to supply ultra violet radiation to deactivate disease causing microorganisms like bacteria and virus (UV radiation of 25.7 nm wavelength is generated by the UV lamp). Outlet for the filtered and purified water is connected to this UV chamber.<br>
d)	The connector is provided with two outlet and two inlets. One inlet is connected to the outlet of the sediment filter and the other one is connected to the back flush inlet. One outlet is connected to the carbon filtration module through the solenoid valve while the other outlet is directed to a resin filtration module through a water regulating means.<br>
e)	Solenoid valve: In power available conditions, water from the connector enters the solenoid valve, which actuates and controls water flow rate to the carbon filtration module. This valve opens and shuts to optimize water flow through the carbon filtration module and UV irradiation module.<br><br>
(f)	Water flow controller is connected to the one outlet of the connector that is opposite to the other outlet to the solenoid valve.   Water flow controller is provided with means to regulate and control water flow through manually. j\^   |' manually  operable  knob  is  provided  thereon  for  controlling  water  flow       ^ therethrough.    ,<br>
(g)	Resin cartridge contains iodinated resin, which are capable of disinfecting and deactivating disease causing microorganisms like bacteria and virus. Water, which flows out of the resin cartridge, enters the retention chamber around the carbon filter module, which adsorbs residual iodine that may be present.<br>
(h) PCB: The system is electrically operable and is provided with a printed circuit board for control.<br>
This invention relates to a water filter and purification system comprising a housing provided with an inlet port, an outlet port and power supply source, said housing accommodating a connector having two inlets and two outlets, wherein the first inlet of the said connector is in communication with the inlet port through a sediment filtration module, the second inlet is connected to back flushing means, the first outlet is connected to a solonoid valve in communication with a carbon filtration module, a UV irradiation chamber and from there to said outlet port; the second outlet is in communication with a resin filtration module through a water controlling means, said resin filtration module being connected to said carbon filtration module which is in communication with the outlet port through the UV irradiation chamber, the arrangement being such that the water flow is directed to the desired outlet by the said connector.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the attached flow chart and with the figure in the accompanying drawing.<br><br>
Fig.1 show a flow chart of the components of the system and the water flow direction therethrough.<br>
Fig.2 show a sectional view of the system of the present invention.<br>
Reference numeral 1 stands for the sediment filtration module which has<br>
porous filter means housed in a container of a desired shape.    This container is<br>
provided with a detachable cap or lid, means for changing the filter medium, if<br>
desired.    This is connected to a solenoid valve 5 which opens to carbon filtration<br>
module 2 and then to the UV irradiation chamber 3.   The UV chamber is provided<br>
with an outlet port OL for collecting purified water.   The inlet port is indicated by<br>
reference letter IL which enters the sedimentation module.    Back flush means is<br>
indicated by reference letter BF through which water may be forced for back flushing<br>
and cleaning the system.  Reference number 4 stands for the connector.  Two outlets<br>
and two inlets are provided in this connector. The outlets are connected to the solenoid<br>
valve, carbon filtration module and then to the UV chamber which has the outlet OL.<br>
The  other  outlet  of the  connector  leads  to  a  water  control  means  6  which<br>
communicates to a resin filter module 7.  This resin filter module communicates with<br>
the outlet through the carbon filtration module and the UV chamber in the event of no<br>
power supply situation.  The water flow from the connector is directed to the solenoid /    . valve, carbon filter module and to UV chamber route in the event of power supply.<br>
 The connector may change the direction of water flow (by turning the water flow)<br>
controller knob to resin mode) to the resin filter module through the water regulation<br>
/in case of power failure This enables continuous supply of filtered and disinfected<br>
j drinking water at all times even when there is no power supply.<br><br>
In the absence of power supply water is made to flow through resin cartridge which  contains iodinated resin. Iodine deactivates disease causing microorganisms such as bacteria and virus. This water enters the carbon filtration unit which absorbs chemical impurities including excess iodine, if present. This water flows out through the UV chamber. This arrangement enables filtration of the water by the sedimentation module disinfection by the resin module and further flows through the carbon filtration module.<br>
During power availability, the connector is used to direct the water flow through the solenoid valve to the carbon filtration module and then to the UV irradiation module to purify and disinfect the same. Thus continuous water supply is ensured during power availability and power non-availability period.<br>
Obvious modifications and alterations known to persons skilled in the art are within the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
