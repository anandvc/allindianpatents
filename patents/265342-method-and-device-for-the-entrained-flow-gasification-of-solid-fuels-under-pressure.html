				<td>Method and device for the entrained-flow gasification of solid fuels under pressure<br>
The invention relates to a method and a device for the entrained-flow gasification of solid<br>
fuels under pressure.<br>
The known methods for the entrained-flow gasification convert pulverized carbonaceous (C-<br>
containing) fuels to the gasification products crude gas and slag at temperatures above the<br>
flow point of the ash, using gasification agents that predominantly consist of oxygen. In order<br>
to melt the ash, very high temperatures are essential in the gasification chamber. The tempera-<br>
tures range from approximately 1400 to 1600 °C, depending on the flow point of the ash. At<br>
such high temperatures the crude gases and the slag must be drawn off at the outlet from the<br>
entrained-flow gasifier. The specific oxygen demand related to the pulverized fuels is higher<br>
by approximately 20 to 30 % compared with gasification methods that like the fluid-bed me-<br>
thods function at temperatures obtaining outlet temperatures of the crude gases that are lower<br>
by approximately 400 to 600 K. High-ash fuels with ash contents of more than approximately<br>
20 mass-%, related to the dry fuel, and having high ash flow points of over approximately<br>
1400 °C cannot be utilized with energetic efficiency nor at economically acceptable condi-<br>
tions in known entrained-flow gasification methods. Furthermore, the entrained-flow gasifica-<br>
tion has the decisive disadvantage that very high operational and plant efforts are required in<br>
order to separate the slag from the crude gases before the further use thereof if, in particular, it<br>
is intended to utilize the sensible heat of the hot crude gases that exit the entrained-flow ga-<br>
sifier for waste-heat steam generation. For that the crude gases must be extremely cooled /<br>
quenched directly after having left the gasification chamber of the entrained-flow gasifier<br>
over a short distance, before they can be allowed to enter the crude gas heat exchangers.<br>
Many versions of external quenching of the crude gases have been developed, with the gas<br>
quench and the chemical quench having been successful. The use of the gas quench causes<br><br>
losses in usable heat (exergy). The chemical quench where carbon-containing substances are<br>
mixed into the hot crude gas flow largely avoids this disadvantage. In continuous operation,<br>
however, the chemical quench involves considerable technological effort and serious draw-<br>
backs such as tar and soot formation, and the formation of crusts. In order to avoid the high<br>
efforts of utilizing the waste heat, alternatively the hot, slag-laden crude gases exiting the en-<br>
trained-flow gasifier are water-quenched. This is easy and robust but is disadvantageous in<br>
that the low-temperature heat developed by the water evaporation can only rarely be utilized<br>
in practice.<br>
DE 26 40 180 B discloses the gasification of solid fuels with different grain sizes (from dust<br>
to coarse-grained) using a lower fixed bed and an upper dust gasification zone, whereby a<br>
fluidized bed is created above the fixed bed and further above a dust gasification is intended<br>
to be performed. The solid fuel is to enter the fluidized bed. In the process itself, it is intended<br>
to separate the fuel into proportions of different sizes.<br>
Teachings of DE 26 40 180 B are not suitable to achieve a complete gasification, because<br>
substantial amounts of ash-containing coke dust enter the product gas and have to be sepa-<br>
rated therefrom. Re-feeding the coke dust into the process cannot be considered, as ash-<br>
containing dust proportions would very soon enrich in the process to such an extent that the<br>
process would come to a standstill. Furthermore, other fundamental problems remain un-<br>
solved, particularly the adaptation of the process control to the grain size distributions that<br>
frequently change by accident and variations of the ash content of both the total ash and the<br>
different grain size fractions. The fixed bed, for example, would "grow into" the fluidized bed<br>
when the coarse grain proportion of the solid fuels becomes too high and no sufficient amount<br>
of the gasification agent can be fed into the fixed bed for balance and fluid dynamic limita-<br>
tions. At least for the reasons mentioned the process proposal according to DE 26 40 180 B<br>
has not been successful in technology.<br><br>
From the disadvantages listed above the problem of the invention derives as to further devel-<br>
op the fundamentals of the process of entrained-flow gasification in order to solve the serious<br>
disadvantages of the entrained-flow gasification, particularly allowing high-ash fuels having<br>
high ash-flow temperatures to be processed without problems, the crude gases exiting the ga-<br>
sifier to be fed to a waste heat utilization without demanding any external quenching and the<br>
produced ashes or slags to be separated to a low plant technological expense from the crude<br>
gases and discharged from the entrained-flow gasifier, while it has to be ensured that the used<br>
pulverized fuels are practically completely gasified in the entrained-flow gasifier.<br>
The problem of the invention is solved by a method for the entrained-flow gasification of sol-<br>
id fuels under pressure where solid fuels are transformed by use of gasification agents that<br>
largely consist of oxygen in an entrained flow to crude gas and slag as the gasification prod-<br>
ucts, whereby in an upward internally circulating entrained flow, using first oxygen-rich gasi-<br>
fication agents<br>
a)	the practically complete gasification of the carbonaceous components of the solid fuels<br>
and<br>
b)	a thermal treatment of aftergasification crude gases and also<br>
c)	the granulation of the ash at temperatures above the ash-softening temperature take place,<br>
whereby carbon-containing gasification residues, ash granulates and dust-laden crude gases<br>
are formed and dust-laden crude gases are drawn off at temperatures below the critical ash-<br>
sintering temperature from the entrained flow upward into a buffer zone and from there<br>
passed to further processing, whereby the first gasification agents are injected into the en-<br><br>
trained flow in such a way that a hot central upward flow and a "cold" downward wall flow<br>
are formed, whereby in a moving bed loeated below the entrained flow by use of second low-<br>
oxygen gasification agents an almost complete to totally complete oxidation of the carbon-<br>
containing gasification residues and ash granulates that leave the entrained flow downward<br>
takes place at temperatures below the ash-softening temperature, whereby aftergasification<br>
crude gases and oxidized bottom products are formed, whereby the second gasification agents<br>
are supplied in such an amount and composition that on the one hand, the ash-softening tem-<br>
perature will not be exceeded in the moving bed and on the other hand, the moving bed will<br>
be regularly passed, and whereby the oxidized bottom products are drawn off from the mov-<br>
ing bed downward in countercurrent to the second gasification agents and the aftergasification<br>
crude gases are passed upward from the moving bed into the entrained flow.<br>
As solid fuels, preferably solid fuels are used that essentially contain pulverized fuels and<br>
carbonaceous dusts. Further, also special forms of solid fuels such as fuel/water- or fuel/oil<br>
slurries with variable solids concentration can be used. The solid fuels can be used for en-<br>
trained-flow gasification in dry form and/or in one or several of said special forms. The solid<br>
fuels comprise a wide range of coals, biomasses or carbonaceous waste substances, to a low<br>
extent even liquid or gaseous fuels or residual substances.<br>
The crude gases drawn off from the entrained flow are for further processing preferably<br>
passed to indirect heat exchangers and subsequently to dust separators. In the dust separators<br>
the C-containing dusts are almost completely separated from the dust-laden crude gases and<br>
almost completely to completely re-fed into the entrained flow.<br>
The invention takes advantage of the findings that an entrained-flow gasification with an in-<br>
ternally circulating entrained flow associated with a moving-bed gasification arranged below<br><br>
the entrained-flow gasification makes possible to perform the practically complete conversion<br>
of pulverized fuels to oxidized ashes and slags and to ofude gases in such a way that the dust-<br>
laden crude gases can be drawn off from the entrained flow at temperatures corresponding to<br>
the crude gas exiting temperatures of the fluidized-bed gasification and the oxidized ashes and<br>
slags from the moving bed at temperatures 
bly 
the upper end of the entrained-flow gasifier to the surface of the moving bed. The moving bed<br>
ranges downward to the bottom product outlet that is positioned at the lower end of the gasifi-<br>
cation reactor for the entrained-flow gasification.<br>
Essential to the invention is the self-regulating cooperation of the processes of gasifying the<br>
solid fuels and agglomerating the ash to coarse-grained agglomerates in the circulating en-<br>
trained flow, with establishing below the circulating entrained flow the moving bed that in-<br>
cludes predominantly coarse-grained agglomerates, whereby the material properties of the<br>
solid fuels can vary over a wide range without exerting disturbing influences on the process.<br>
Therefore the teaching differs fundamentally from the proposals for solution described in DE<br>
26 40 180 B. This is true of both the whole process (basically different establishment of hot<br>
and "cold" reaction zones or of the different gasification zones, namely moving bed, fluid<br>
bed, entrained flow) and the partial processes like the feeding of the solid fuels (pulverized<br>
versus dust up to necessarily coarse-grained), the output of the gasification residues from the<br>
moving bed- or fixed bed zones (output regulated with regard to fuel ash versus regulated<br>
with regard to coarse-grained coal proportion), vertical gas circulation in the dust gasification<br>
zone (hot upward central flow versus centrally downward introduction of gases).<br>
The gasification in a circulating entrained flow is established as follows. As solid fuels the<br>
pulverized fuels to be gasified and the re-fed C-containing dusts and also aftergasification<br>
crude gases and first gasification agents are introduced into the entrained flow. Said gasifica-<br><br>
tion agents are introduced in such a ratio to the amount and composition of the supplied solid<br>
fuels that temperatures are adjusted at the erude gas outlet that are below the critical ash-<br>
sintering temperature but at least so high that almost complete gasification of the C-containing<br>
constituents takes place. The dusts carried along with the dust-laden crude gases will have C-<br>
contents of 
containing dusts are practically completely re-fed into the entrained flow and aftergasified. It<br>
is essential to an almost complete gasification that high-oxygen gasification agents are used.<br>
The oxygen concentrations of said gasification agents are adjusted within a range of values of<br>
21 to 100 vol.-%, preferably of 40 to 70 vol.-%, if hydrogen is used with vapour/oxygen ratios<br>
of 0 to 1.5 kg/m3 (at normal conditions) accordingly. The high values of the oxygen concen-<br>
trations apply to pulverized fuels with high ash contents and high ash-flowing temperatures.<br>
That temperature value is defined as the critical ash-sintering temperature tsp below that the<br>
temperature must fall so that the ash in the free board and on cooling of the dust-laden crude<br>
gases does not cause baking on or plugging. Non-representative typical numerical examples<br>
of the critical ash-sintering temperature tsp are 700 °C, for example, for biomasses, 1000 °C,<br>
for example, for lignitic coal and 1100 °C, for example, for hard coal. With lignitic coals hav-<br>
ing a critical ash-sintering temperature of, for example, 1000 °C an almost complete gasifica-<br>
tion is given, if the temperatures at the crude gas outlet are 900 to 950 °C (temperature range<br>
50 to 100 K). Thus the invention utilizes the temperature difference between both this charac-<br>
teristic temperatures, relevant for most pulverized fuels. As far as the critical ash-sintering<br>
temperature tsp is below the temperature required for gasification, such as with some bio-<br>
masses, aggregates that raise the melting and sintering temperatures must additionally be add-<br>
ed in order to raise the critical ash-sintering temperature tSp above the gasification tempera-<br>
ture. The aggregates raising the sintering temperature can be fed either together with the solid<br>
fuels or separate from the solid fuels.<br><br>
The internally circulating entrained flow is established as follows. The solid fuels are, like the<br>
first gasification agents, introduced locally separate therefrom into the gasification chamber in<br>
the bottom zone of the entrained flow; also introduction in form of slurries is suitable. De-<br>
pending on the thermal potential of the entrained-flow gasifier and the fuels to be fed one or<br>
several supply nozzles are provided, preferably distributed over the periphery of the en-<br>
trained-flow gasifier and preferably distributed in a nozzle plane. The first gasification agents<br>
are injected through gasification agent nozzles with the injection being aligned vastly horizon-<br>
tal and vastly radial to the axis of flow of the gasification chamber, taking place at input ve-<br>
locities of &gt;10 to approximately 80 m/s. The gasification agent nozzles are also preferably<br>
positioned at one nozzle plane. It is also possible to perform the locally separated input of the<br>
fuels and the gasification agents over one or several dust burners.<br>
The gasification in the internally circulating entrained flow enables to use baking and swelling<br>
coals and high-ash coals with highest ash-flowing temperatures due to the very fast heating<br>
velocities and the fast distribution in the reaction chamber. To ensure that it is decisive that<br>
temperatures develop in the flame zone that exceed the ash-flowing temperatures by approx-<br>
imately 1000 K and even more.<br>
Because the gasification agents enter the gasification chamber at fast flowing velocities flame<br>
zones develop in front of the gasification agent nozzles having temperatures up to &gt;2000 °C<br>
that create a hot upward flow, preferably in form of a central flow. In the flame zones and in<br>
the hot zone of a developing central flow the ash softens, melts and agglomerates. This coar-<br>
sens the grain size of the ash (approximately 1 to 5 mm), until the agglomerates from the en-<br>
trained flow move downward into the moving bed. With increasing height the flame zones, or<br>
the central flow, respectively, widen until they fill the entire cross-section of the gasification<br>
chamber approximately in form of a pipe flow at the crude gas outlet at the latest. At the same<br><br>
time due to the endothermie reactions the flow eools on the flow path to the crude gas outlet<br>
reaching temperatures that correspond to the temperatures when the endethermle gasiflcation<br>
reactions stop, The hot central flow is surrounded by a downward "cold" wall flow where also<br>
the endothermie reactions dominate. The wall flow comprises the particles that due to gravity<br>
fall out of the flame zones and the central flow, sinking downward, and is heavily loaded with<br>
solids. At the lower end of the entrained flow the wall flow re-mixes with the upward flow<br>
while coarser particles settle down. Thus the reaction zone of the internally circulating en-<br>
trained flow comprises one or several central hot reaction zones where predominantly the exo-<br>
thermic oxidation reactions proceed and the granulation of the ash takes place, and near to the<br>
gasifier head of the gasifier wall and the surface of the moving bed a "cold" reaction zone<br>
where the endothermic gasification reactions dominate and the greater part of the C-conver-<br>
sion takes place. The zone of the pipe flow at the upper end of the gasification chamber to a<br>
certain extent forms a buffer zone for the required fading away of the temperatures before the<br>
crude gas flows out.<br>
Already when the introduced pulverized fuels pass through the hot reaction zones for the first<br>
time most part of the ash is granulated and discarded downward into the moving bed. Due to<br>
the advantageous conditions for ash granulation in the hot central reaction zones the amount<br>
of the dusts entrained by the dust-laden crude gases decreases to a very low level, correspond-<br>
ing to the one to two times the amount of the ash introduced with the pulverized fuels. Due to<br>
the specific establishment of the gasification reactions and the flow directing reaction condi-<br>
tions are created in a confined space that allow to draw off crude gases with low dust loads<br>
from the entrained-flow gasifier at temperatures below the critical ash-sintering temperature<br>
tSp that without any additional effort can be passed to further processing in waste heat vapour<br>
generators for waste heat use. If it becomes necessary for difficult pulverized fuels because of<br>
a not completely avoidable danger of contamination and pluggage by the dust-laden crude<br><br>
gases drawn off from the entrained-flow gasifier, to perform a further cooling, then at the<br>
head of the entrained-flow gasifier preferably water or water vapour is injected, depending on<br>
whether an intense cooling (&gt; approximately 200 K, preferably &gt;100 K) or a less intense cool-<br>
ing (
advantageously, an endothermic reaction conversion takes place due to gasification reactions<br>
(quench conversion).<br>
The moving bed is adapted to the requirements of the entrained flow as follows. The second<br>
gasification agents are supplied considering amount and composition in such a way that on<br>
the one hand, the ash-softening temperature will not be exceeded and on the other hand, the<br>
moving bed is regularly passed, i. e. neither channel-like nor fluid bed-like. The low oxygen<br>
content ensures that the ash and ash granulates are almost completely after-oxidized, while<br>
avoiding softening or melting. In this way the requirement of a non-plugging and non-<br>
slagging operation of the moving bed is fulfilled. Depending on the level of the ash-softening<br>
temperature of the used fuels oxygen concentrations in the range of approximately 5 to ap-<br>
proximately 20 vol.-% have found suitable. The oxygen supplied with the second low-oxygen<br>
gasification agents is about 10 to 30 % of the total oxygen supplied. The higher values are to<br>
be assigned to high-ash coals as due to the increased ash outputs higher carbon loads are en-<br>
trained.<br>
An advantage of the invention is that the chemical oxygen consumption for the oxidation of<br>
the ash constituents of the bottom products, or the fuel ashes, respectively, is comparably<br>
lower than with the traditional fixed-bed gasification, for example, to the Lurgi principle. It is<br>
known of said principle that a certain percentage of the gasification oxygen is getting lost to<br>
the actual gasification process because it is needed for the further oxidation of the predomi-<br>
nantly non-vitrified fuel ashes to the highest oxidation stages. That is not the case in this in-<br><br>
vention as the highly predominant quantitative ash proportions of the pulverized fuels are<br>
melted in reducing gas atmospheres at a minimal chemical oxygen demand and the ash granu-<br>
lates produced thereby behave inert against oxygen in the moving bed.<br>
The amount of the supplied second gasification agents is limited to such values that the flow<br>
velocities of the forming aftergasification crude gases at the upper end of the moving bed (re-<br>
lated to the solids-free flow cross-sectioon) do not exceed 0.1 to 0.5 m/s, preferably 0.1 to<br>
0.3 m/s. The low upper limit of the flow velocities applies to conditions in the entrained flow<br>
under which by using gasification agents with relatively low oxygen concentrations predomi-<br>
nantly very fine-grained ash granulates with grain sizes mainly 
fuels, for example, with high-melting ashes but low critical ash-sintering temperatures), while<br>
accordingly the upper limit applies to conditions where by using gasification agents with rela-<br>
tively high oxygen concentrations predominantly coarse-grained ash granulates with grain<br>
sizes mainly &gt;0.5 mm form. Also in case of high-ash pulverized fuels it may be useful to set<br>
high flow velocities around 0.5 m/s. Accordingly high proportions of carbon are converted<br>
and the ash is correspondingly cooled down. In the whole, high flow velocities have a positive<br>
effect in that the grain sizes of the agglomerates forming the moving bed enlarge, with the<br>
positive result of homogenizing the passability of the moving bed.<br>
The flow velocities of the aftergasification crude gases when exiting the moving bed with 0.1<br>
to 0.5 m/s are sufficiently fast so that only little shares of the pulverized fuels introduced into<br>
the gasification chamber separate on the moving bed. Therefore the C-concentration in the<br>
moving bed is normally so low that oxygen is hyperstoichiometric related to carbon so that<br>
the carbon conversion is practically complete with further oxidation of all oxidizable ash con-<br>
stituents being ensured. The aftergasification crude gases upward entering the circulating en-<br>
trained flow are mixed therein, thermically treated, participating in the gasification reactions<br>
according to the present conditions of gasification.<br><br>
For the countercurrent cooling of the oxidized bottom products preferably second gasification<br>
agents are used that consist of oxygen and carbon dioxide (instead of water vapour) with their<br>
temperature as near as possible to the ambient temperature. Therefore it is possible to utilize<br>
the sensible heat of the oxidized bottom products for the gasification process in the entrained-<br>
flow gasifier and, on the other hand, to do without aftercooling normally necessary for han-<br>
dling the ash. The advantages of the use of carbon become clear by that the outlet tempera-<br>
tures of the bottom products of below approximately 650 °C, preferably below approximately<br>
600 °C in case of oxygen and vapour as second gasification agents, can be reduced to below<br>
approximately 400 °C, preferably to below approximately 300 °C in case of carbon dioxide<br>
instead of water vapour. The almost C-free oxidized bottom products can be disposed of<br>
without problems or further used. Another advantageous embodiment of the invention con-<br>
sists in that vapour, which is produced in the water jacket surrounding the gasification cham-<br>
ber, is partly or completely supplied to the second gasification agents.<br>
Additionally, it has to be pointed out that during operation the depth of the moving bed can be<br>
determined by, for example, a radiometric level measurement and set to have the desired<br>
depth and/or maintained constant by controlling the withdrawal of the bottom products. The<br>
bottom product withdrawal outlet is, for example, by means of a rotary grate in known proven<br>
manner. The rotary grate also functions to feed and distribute the second gasification agents<br>
over the cross-section of the moving bed.<br>
According to the invention the problem is solved by a gasification reactor for the entrained-<br>
flow gasification of solid fuels under pressure that essentially comprises a pressure vessel (3)<br>
that can be cooled and an inner jacket (7) that is equipped with a heat shield, with at least one<br>
crude gas outflow (8) located at the upper end of the pressure vessel (3) and at least one bot-<br><br>
torn product withdrawal outlet (9) at the lower end of the pressure vessel (3), the pressure ves-<br>
sel (3) having at least enough spaee for a moving bed and an entrained flow that circulates<br>
internally above the surface (12) of the moving bed and a buffer zone situated above said en-<br>
trained bed, whereby at a height of between approximately 1 and 3 m above the surfaee (12)<br>
of the moving bed (13) feed connections (15) for the solid fuels and gasification agent nozzles<br>
(16) for the supply of first gasification agents (17) are situated, the gasification agent nozzles<br>
(16) being designed to inject the first gasification agents into the entrained flow in such a way<br>
that a hot central upward flow and a "cold" downward wall flow are formed, and whereby at<br>
least one feed device for second gasification agents is located at the bottom product with-<br>
drawal outlet (9).<br>
The enclosing walls of the gasification chamber, which reach from the crude gas outflow (8)<br>
at the upper end to the bottom product withdrawal outlet (9) at the lower end of the gasifica-<br>
tion reactor for entrained-flow gasification, are over their height designed preferably without<br>
considerable changes of the cross-section, easiest with a cylindrical shape. The whole gasifier<br>
is similar to fixed-bed gasifiers preferably equipped with a water jacket for cooling; but also<br>
water-cooled pipe diaphragm walls can be used. The protection of the gasifier inner jacket (7)<br>
at the hot side consists preferably in a usual studding or a ceramic thin coating such as SiC or<br>
other refractory materials as a ceramic protection.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention the gasification agent nozzles<br>
(16) are arranged evenly distributed over the periphery of the outer pressure jacket (5),<br>
oriented radial, inclined 10° to 30° upward.<br>
The feed connections (15) for the solid fuels are advantageously situated at approximately the<br>
same level or below the gasification agent nozzles (16).<br><br>
The height position of the gasification agent nozzles and the feed connections can be varied<br>
within certain limits. The feed connections are positioned at the same level or up to approx-<br>
imately 1 m below the gasification agent nozzles and at least approximately 1 m above the<br>
surface of the moving bed. Preferably, the gasification agent nozzles and the feed connections<br>
are positioned at a common plane, approximately 1 to 3 m above the surface of the moving<br>
bed. Observing the vertical minimum distance of the feed connections to the moving bed en-<br>
sures that the solid fuels can be undisturbedly suppied, the equal or deeper position of the feed<br>
connections compared with the gasification agent nozzles ensures that free oxygen does not<br>
react with the solid fuels close to the walls.<br>
The bottom product withdrawal outlet (9) is advantageously designed as rotary grate.<br>
The internally circulating entrained flow (11) is established above the surface (12) of the<br>
moving bed (13). The buffer zone is located above the internally circulating entrained flow<br>
(11).<br>
The combination of an internally circulating entrained flow and a moving bed below the cir-<br>
culating entrained flow in the manner according to the invention results in a fundamental sim-<br>
plification of the whole plant system and operation of the gasification process. The most im-<br>
portant simplifications relate to the gasification reactor for entrained-flow gasification. The<br>
enclosing walls of the gasification chamber that reach from the crude gas outlet at the upper<br>
end until the bottom product withdrawal outlet at the lower end of the entrained-flow gasifier<br>
are designed over their height without considerable cross-section changes, easiest in form of a<br>
cylinder. The heat shield of the gasifier inner jacket on the hot side consists preferably in a<br>
usual studding and a ceramic coating. No brick lining is required. In case of ceramic coatings<br><br>
short start up and closing down times can be realized. On the crude gas side no hot cyclones,<br>
cold gas quenches nor cooling and aftertreatment devices for the separated dusts, on the bot-<br>
tom product side no cooling and aftertreatment devices are required. Finally, the supply of the<br>
gasification agents and solid fuels ean be drastically simplified in that instead of expensive<br>
integrated burner structures separate systems with eooled pipe feeders can be provided.<br>
Also a system for entrained-flow gasification under pressure is part of the invention. Said sys-<br>
tem comprises a gasification reactor according to the invention with associated devices for the<br>
supply of gasification agents and solid fuels, for further processing of the crude gases and<br>
disposal of the ash.<br>
The crude gas outflow (8) of the gasification reactor is connected to a waste heat exchanger<br>
(25), after which a dust separator for separation of the entrained dusts and a tight flow con-<br>
veyor for re-feeding the separated dusts into the internally circulating entrained flow (11) are<br>
provided.<br>
The crude gases leaving the dust separator can be used or before use supplied to a gas prepa-<br>
rating device.<br>
Fig. 1 explains an embodiment of the invention in detail.<br>
Fig. 1 shows in an extremely simplified schematic representation a gasification reactor (1)<br>
with internally circulating entrained flow. The gasification chamber (3) of the gasification<br>
reactor (1) for entrained-flow gasification is enclosed in a cylindrical pressure vessel (4) that<br>
comprises an outer pressure jacket (5), a water chamber (6) and an inner jacket (7). The inner<br>
jacket (7) is studded and coated with a refractory material as ceramic protection. At the upper<br><br>
end of the entrained-flow gasifier (1) the crude gas outflow (8), at the lower end the bottom<br>
product withdrawal outlet (9) is situated, with only the top contour of the rotary grate (10) of<br>
said bottom product withdrawal outlet (9) being indicated in the figure. The internally circu-<br>
lating entrained flow (11) is established over the surface (12) of the moving bed (13). On a<br>
plane (14) at a height of approximately 1 m above the surface (12) of the moving bed (13)<br>
there are two feed connections (15), offset by 180°, for the tight flow supply of the pulverized<br>
dry lignitic coal (2) and six gasification agent nozzles (16) for the supply of the first gasi-<br>
fication agents (17). The gasification agent nozzles (16) are arranged evenly distributed over<br>
the periphery of the outer pressure jacket (S). Said nozzles (16) are oriented radial, inclined<br>
upward by 30°,<br>
The crude gas outflow (8) is connected to the waste heat exchanger (25), whereby after said<br>
heat exchanger (25) a hot gas filter (26) for separating the entrained dusts and a tight flow<br>
conveyor for re-feeding the separated dusts (20) into the internally circulating entrained flow<br>
(1 l)are positioned.<br>
In the gasification reactor (1) for entrained-flow gasification pulverized dry lignitic coal (2)<br>
with a water content of 12 mass-%, an ash content of 6 mass-% and a critical ash-sintering<br>
temperature of 1000 °C is gasified. To make things easier to understand the quantitative<br>
supply of the first gasification agents (17) is explained in the following related to the refer-<br>
ence basis of 1 kg of dry lignitic coal (2). Related to 1 kg of dry lignitic coal (2), altogether<br>
0.366 m3 (normal conditions) oxygen (18), 0.058 m3 (normal conditions) carbon dioxide (29)<br>
and 0.171 kg water vapour (19) are fed.<br>
The first gasification agents (17) are injected at a flow velocity of 30 m/s and a temperature of<br>
280 °C through the gasification agent nozzles (16) into the gasification chamber (3) of the<br><br>
gasification reactor (1). In addition to the first gasification agents (17) and the pulverized dry<br>
lignitie coal (2), re-fed dusts (20) and the aftergasification crude gas (21) that leaves the sur-<br>
face (12) upward are supplied into the internally circulating entrained flow (11).<br>
While intensely mixing the introduced materials in the internally circulating entrained flow<br>
(11) the hot central upward flow (22) forms enclosed by the "cold" downward wall flow (23).<br>
In the hot central upward flow (22) the ash granulates to form ash granulates that settle down<br>
with a grain size of mainly 2 mm on the surface (12) of the moving bed. The dust-laden crude<br>
gases (24) that have a dust load of approximately 30 g/m3 (normal conditions), with the dusts<br>
consisting quantitatively half of carbon and half of ash, leave the entrained-flow reactor (1) at<br>
a temperature of approximately 950 °C over the crude gas outflow (8) and pass into the hot<br>
gas filter (26) over the waste heat exchanger (25), where said gases (24) are cooled to approx-<br>
imately 250 °C. In the hot gas filter (26) the entrained dusts (20) are practically completely<br>
separated and re-fed into the circulating entrained flow (11) by means of a device for tight<br>
flow conveying (27).<br>
Over the rotary grate (10) the second gasification agents (28) that are mixed from oxygen (18)<br>
and carbon dioxide (29) in the volume ratio of 10 vol.-% oxygen to 90 vol.-% carbon dioxide<br>
are supplied into the moving bed (13) at a temperature of 80 °C. The oxidized bottom prod-<br>
ucts (30) that are drawn off over the bottom product withdrawal outlet (9) leave the entrained-<br>
flow gasifier (1) at a temperature of 140 °C. The C-content of said bottom products (30) is<br>
second gasification agents (28) are supplied in such an amount that flow velocities about<br>
0.3 m/s related to the free flow cross-section establish at the surface (12) of the moving bed<br>
(13). This ensures a homogeneous, regular passage of the moving bed (13).<br><br>
