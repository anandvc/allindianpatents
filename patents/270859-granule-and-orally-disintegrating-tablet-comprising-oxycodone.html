France.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
WO 20(18/1)15220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
GRANULE AND ORALLY DISINTEGRATING TABLET COMPRISING<br>
OXYCODONE<br>
5	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  present  invention  relates  to  taste-masked granules  containing  oxycodone,  as  well as      orally disintegrating  tablets  comprising  said  granules  and 10    optionally acetaminophen.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Various orally disintegrating tablets are currently 15 available on the market. These tablets include a disintegrant and usually a pharmaceuticaily active ingredient ("active ingredient"} -and disintegrate or dissolve without a chewing action in less than three minutes, usually in less than 60 seconds, upon contact 20 with saliva, forming a suspension of small particles which is easy to swallow.<br>
Once easily swallowed, the particles containing the active ingredient release the same most preferably into 25    the   stomach  or  into  the  upper  part   of   the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
This	type of tablet is described, for example,, in<br>
documents	EF 548 356, EP 636 364, EP 1 003 48-3, EP 1 058<br>
30     538,  WO	98/46215,  WO  00/06126,  WO  00/27357  and  WO<br>
00/51568.<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/0579I2<br><br>
Orally disintegrating tablets are a convenient route for swallowing active agents since they do not require, but not exclude, absorbing water at the same time.<br>
5	Owing to its ease of use, the orally disintegrating<br>
tablet is entirely suitable for ambulatory treatment, more particularly for certain patients and especially the elderly or young children, who have difficulties in swallowing such that they find it unpleasant, or even<br>
10    impossible, to ingest tablets or gel capsules, even with a simultaneous intake of liquid-It  is  estimated  that  50%  cf  the  population experiences  such  difficulties,   with  the  possible<br>
15 consequence of the prescribed medicinal product not being taken and thus a major impact on the efficacy of the treatment (H. Seager, 1998, J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 50, 37 5-382) .<br>
20	In the case where the active ingredient has for<br>
instance a bitter or an unpleasant taste, the small particles may consist of coated granules containing the said active ingredient, thus preventing a bad taste from developing  in  the mouth.  Such coating  can  also  be<br>
25 provided ■ to prevent the active ingredient from being prematurely released in the mouth or to ensure delayed release in the stomach. A typical coating for taste-masking is an aminoalkyl methacrylate copolymer sold" by Rohm Pharma Polymers (Degussa) as EUDRAGIT'3 E 100 or EPO,<br>
30 namely dimethyl aminoethyl methacylate copolymer, comprising a functional group with tertiary amine.<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
This coating is insoluble at a pH above 5.5, thus<br>
remains intact in contact with saliva but is readily<br>
soluble in gastric juice, due- to the protonation of the<br>
amine functions, thus releasing the active ingredient in<br>
5    an immediate manner in the stomach.<br>
However, the Applicant has discovered that this copolymer is not suitable for making conventional coated granules for direct tableting from oxycodone in the form 10 of a base or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt such as oxycodone hydrochloride which is prescribed to relieve pain.<br>
It has been observed by "he Applicant that the<br>
15    oxycodone content of such granules tends to decrease with<br>
time due to the degradation of oxycodone into oxidation<br>
by-products such as oxycodone N-oxide and oxymorphone.<br>
Without intending to be bound by any theory,  it is<br>
believed that the nitrogen atom of the tertiary amines of<br>
20    the dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate units of Eudragit©<br>
E100 may form hydrogen bonding with the hydrogen atom of<br>
the ammonium function of oxycodone hydrochloride, which<br>
in turn could facilitate oxidation reactions. Peroxides<br>
or other contaminants, originating from other excipients<br>
25    or active ingredients, are also susceptible to induce<br>
oxidative degradation of oxycodone.<br>
Now, it is preferable that the final tablets retain' as much oxycodone for as long as possible under storage 30 conditions. This is both so that the efficacy of the tablet remains high, and so that the degradents and impurities produced by the breakdown of the active ingredients remain low.  Specifically, it is preferable that at least about 90t<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
of the oxycodone, and more preferably at least about 95% of the oxycodone remain after storage for 14 days, and more preferably after 21 days at 80°C dry heat.<br>
5	Oxycodone is for instance   marketed as   conventional<br>
tablets alone as an hydrochloride salt under the trademark Roxicodone®, or in combination with acetaminophen, by ENDO PHARMACEUTICALS under the trademark Percocet®.<br>
10<br>
However, formulating orally disintegrating tablets including both oxycodone and acetaminophen proved to be difficult, since it has been discovered that acetaminophen can promote the degradation cf an opiate<br>
15 such as oxycodone by direct interaction especially in moist conditions or in the presence of residual humidity.<br>
It has also been observed that acetaminophen release was also slowed down when acetaminophen crystals were<br>
20 combined with oxycodone hydrochloride in taste masked granules prepared according to US 2006/0134422, further dispersed within an orally disintegrating tablet. Thus standard methods of isolating oxycodone from acetaminophen can delay the release of the two active<br>
25 agents and undesirably delay the onset cf pain relief to the patient.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention the expression "orally disintegrating tablets" refers to a 30 tablet which disintegrates or dissolves in the mouth in less than 60 seconds, preferably in less than 40 seconds upon contact with saliva, forming therefore small, particles which are easy to swallow.<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/0579J2<br><br>
The disintegration time here corresponds to the time<br>
between the moment when the tablet is placed on the<br>
tongue and the moment when the suspension resulting from<br>
5    the  disintegration  or  dissolution of  the  tablet  is<br>
swallowed.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for orally disintegrating<br>
tablets in which a peroxide-sensitive active agent such<br>
10    as oxycodone can be included without experiencing any<br>
substantial degradation, either alone or in combination<br>
with acetaminophen.<br>
Moreover,  there  remains  a  need	for  a means  for<br>
15    orally delivering a stable form of	oxycodone to the<br>
gastrointestinal tract while avoiding	premature release<br>
thereof in the mouth.<br>
In addition, it would be desirable to provide for an<br>
20    orally disintegrating tablet comprising both oxycodone<br>
and  acetaminophen  while  offering  not  only  stable<br>
oxycodone,  but  also  a  good  dissolution  rate  of<br>
acetaminophen, i.e. a release of 8 5% wt of acetaminophen<br>
from a tablet including 325 mg thereof, in less than 10<br>
25    minutes at any pH ranging from pH 1.2 to pH 6.8 and at<br>
least 90% release of acetaminophen at 15 min. It would<br>
also be desirable to provide for an orally disintegrating<br>
tablet comprising both oxycodone and acetaminophen while<br>
having a Cnax   of acetaminophen between 4.5 and 6.8 ng/mL<br>
30     for  a  tablet  including  10  mg  oxycodone  and  325  mg<br>
acetaminophen and providing for a fast dissolution rate<br>
of acetaminophen at an acidic pK, such as in the stomach.<br><br>
WO 20U8/U15220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/U57912<br><br>
The object of this invention is thus to propose new dosage forms of oxycodone enabling to solve the above needs.<br>
5	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

It also pertains to a method 5 for reducing pain comprising oral administration of granules or tablets as described above.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
10	Oxycodone  can  be  used  as  such  or  as  a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" is intended to mean the derivatives of oxycodone in which the base compound is converted to its salt with an organic or inorganic<br>
15 acid, examples of which comprise acetic, ascorbic, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, boric, camphorsulfonic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glutamic, glutaric, glycerophosphoric, hydrobromic, hydrochloric, hydroiodic, isethionic,  lactic,  maleic,  malic,  malonic,  mandelic,<br>
20 methanesulfonic, mucic, nitric, oxalic, pamoic, pantothenic, phosphoric, salicylic, succinic, sulphuric, tartaric, terephthalic, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like.<br>
25	Preferred    oxycodone    salts    are    oxycodone<br>
hydrochloride and oxycodone terephthalate.<br>
In  the  following,   "oxycodone"  will  be  used indifferently   for   oxycodone   or   pharmaceutically 30    acceptable salts thereof.<br>
The amount of oxycodone or its salt may range from about  1%  t:o 50%,  preferably from abour  5f.  to 2b%    by<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
weight relative to the weight of the neutral core. According to a preferred embodiment/ it is possible to prepare oxycodone loaded granules of different strengths in order to accommodate the different dosage strengths of 5 the final tablets. Actually, in a preferred embodiment low strength granules containing about 5% to about 6% by weight of oxycodone (relative to the total weight of the drug loaded granules) may be used to prepare 2.5 mg and 5 mg dosage units and high strength granules containing<br>
10 about 10% to about 12% of oxycodone (relative to the total weight of the drug loaded granules) may be used to prepare 7.5 mg and 10 mg dosage units. In this way, the tablet strength may be varied without making the tablet unpalatably large.<br>
15<br>
The granules according to this invention comprise a first layer comprising oxycodone which is applied onto neutral cores.<br>
20	The neutral core may comprise any chemically and<br>
pharmaceutically inert excipient, existing in particle form, either crystalline or amorphous, for example sugars or sugar derivatives such as lactose, sucrose, hydrolyzed starch    (maltodextrins),    celluloses    such    as<br>
25 microcrystalline cellulose, or mixtures thereof such as sucrose and starch; or mixtures thereof with a cellulose base.<br>
The oxycodone coating may be applied by spraying a<br>
30    suspension or solution of oxycodone onto neutral cores,<br>
preferably in a fluidized-air coating device. Preferably,<br>
oxycodone  will  be  used  as  a  suspension  in  a<br>
hydroalcoholic medium. It has indeed been observed that<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP20U7/057912<br><br>
using a hydroalcoholic medium instead of an aqueous medium provided for greater stability of the oxycodone. The hydroalcoholic medium advantageously comprises water and ethanol, for instance in a ratio of ethanol to water 5 ranging from t about 60:40 to about 92:8 and more preferably of about 75:25 to about 85:15.<br>
The present  inventors have discovered that this solvent reduced oxycodone degradation, as evidenced by 10    the following Examples.<br>
The oxycodone layer also comprises a binding agent or binder. Said binder is conventionally used in proportions that can range up to 95% by weight relative 15 to the dry weight of the coating, preferably up to 50% by weight relative to the dry weight of the oxycodone coating.<br>
Its function is to bind the active ingredient and<br>
20    other optional pharmaceutical excipients to the  neutral<br>
core without loss, of material, thus forming a homogeneous<br>
layer  of  pharmaceutically  active  ingredient,  evenly<br>
distributed around the neutral core.<br>
25	The binder can be chosen from the group consisting<br>
of cellulose-based polymers, such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, hydroxypropylcellulose and hydroxyethylcellulose; acrylic polymers; polyvinyl alcohols; alginic acid or sodium alginate ; starch or<br>
30 pregelatinized starch; sucrose and derivatives thereof; guar gum; polyethylene glycols, and mixtures and copolymers thereof,  for instance a graft copolymer of<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol, such as sold by BASF under trade name ROLL I COAT IR.<br>
Hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (also referred to as 5 "HPMC" hereunder) is the preferred binder according to this invention. It can preferably be chosen from those for which the apparent viscosity (aqueous solution at 2% m/m, at 20 °C, USP method) is between 2.4 and 18 mPa-s, and even more preferably between 2.4 and 5 mPa-s. 10<br>
The  binder,  when dissolved  in  a  hydroalccholic<br>
solvent, is advantageously present in a proportion that<br>
can range up to 90%, preferably of between 5% and 60% and<br>
more preferably of about 50% by weight relative to the<br>
15    weight of oxycodone.<br>
Moreover,  the  first  (oxycodone)  layer  may  also comprise  one  or  more  pharmaceutically  acceptable excipients, apart from the binding agent. 20<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable excipients optionally present may be chosen from surfactants, antistatic agents, lubricants, and mixtures thereof.<br>
25	The surfactant, which is optionally present in the<br>
oxycodone coating, can be chosen from cationic, anionic, nonionic or amphoteric agents, alone or as a mixture.<br>
The surfactant can    be chosen,  for example,  from<br>
30    compounds such as sodium iauryl sulphate, the monooleate,<br>
the monoiaurate, the monopaimitate, the monostearate, the<br>
trioleate,  the  tristearate  or any      other  ester  of<br>
pclyoxysthyler.ated sorbitan, preferably Tween® 20,  40,<br><br>
WO 2U08/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
60 or 80, glycerides of polyoxyethylenated fatty acids, these fatty acids being saturated or unsaturated and composed of at least 8 carbon atoms, poloxamers, such as poloxamer 188, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block 5 copolymers, such as Pluronic® F68 or F87, lecithin, stearyl alcohol, cetearyl alcohol, cholesterol, polyoxyethylenated    castor    oil,    fatty    alcohol<br>
polyoxyethylenated ethers, such as the Brij® products, and polyoxyethylenated stearates. 10<br>
The surfactant is advantageously present in a proportion that can range up to 20%, preferably of between 0.1 and 20% by weight relative to the total dry-weight of the coating.<br>
15<br>
The antistatic agent can be used in a proportion that can range up to 10% by weight, relative to the dry weight of the coating applied around the neutral core. The  antistatic  agent  may be  chosen  from the  group<br>
20 consisting of: colloidal silica and preferably precipitated silica, micronized or non-micronized talc, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The lubricant may be selected from the group 25 comprising magnesium, zinc, and calcium stearate, stearic acid, talc, pyrogenic silica, hydrogenated vegetable oils, sodium stearylfumarate, micronized polyoxyethylene glycol (micronized Macrogol 6000), leucine, sodium benzoate, and mixtures thereof. 30<br>
As mentioned above, in the granules according to this invention, the first layer comprising oxycodone is further coated by a separating layer (also referred to as<br><br>
WO 2008/U15220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/OS7912<br><br>
"subcoat") between the coating layer comprising oxycodone and the taste-masking polymeric layer, wherein said subcoat comprises at least a compound soluble in gastric fluid,  i.e.  in highly acidic conditions  {pH comprised<br>
5 between 1 and 2), preferably a polymer which can be chosen among the binding polymers or copolymers mentioned above. An example of a copolymer that can be used in the subcoat ' is a graft copolymer of polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol, such as sold by BASF under the trade<br>
10 name KOLLICOAT0 IR. A preferred polymer is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose. The polymer or copolymer, included within the subcoat, acts as a separating layer in order to avoid direct contact between the oxycodone layer  and  the  taste-masking  polymer,  and  dissolves<br>
15 rapidly without altering oxycodone release. The subcoat layer may also comprise an antistatic agent such as those listed previously.<br>
The  subcoat  is  advantageously  present  in	a<br>
20    proportion that can range up to 50%,  preferably	of<br>
between 5% and 30% by weight relative to the weight	of<br>
oxycodone coated cores.<br>
The subcoat can be applied by conventional means, 25 such as in a fluidized-air coating device, by spraying a solution or a dispersion of binder in an aqueous or preferably in a hydroalcoholic medium onto the cores coated with oxycodone. The hydroalcoholic medium advantageously comprises water and ethanol, for instance 30 in a ratio of ethanol to water ranging from about 60:40 to about 92:8 and more preferably of about 85:15.<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
This subcoat is itself coated by a taste-masking coating layer comprising a polymer or copolymer comprising dialkylaminoalkyl(meth)acrylate units, such as dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate units. This polymer can 5 be, for instance, a copolymer of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, methylmethacrylate and n-butyl methacrylate, such as the copolymer sold by ROHM PHARMA under the trade names EUDRAGIT0 E100 and EPO.<br>
10	The   taste-masking  coating  preferably  further<br>
includes a pore-forming agent which can be a hydrophilic polymer soluble in gastric fluids, such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose or other polymers used as binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinylalcohoi,<br>
15 poiyethyleneglyccls, or a soluble agent, preferably chosen from the group of sugars such as sucrose, lactose or dextrose, of polyols such as mannitol, sorbitol or lactitol, or of organic acids and their salts such as citric acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid, or else of<br>
20 inorganic salts such as sodium chloride. A preferred pcre-forming agent is hydroxypropylmethylcellulose.<br>
The pore-forming agent, which is optionally present<br>
in the taste-masking coating, can be used in a proportion<br>
25    that can range up to 50%, preferably of between 5% and<br>
30% by weight relative to the total dry weight of the<br>
taste-masking coating ingredients.<br>
It has indeed been shown that the provision of this<br>
30    pore-forming  agent  within  the  taste-masking  coating<br>
improved the release rate of oxycodone from the granule<br>
at a pH equal or greater than pH 5.5 such as in the<br>
intestine, by increasing the permeability of the taste-<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
masking film coating and thus preventing the slowing down of oxycodone release when the granules directly pass into the intestine, which may undesirably occur when the patient ingesting the granule has a fast digestion and/or 5    is stressed.<br>
The amount of pore-forming agent in the taste-masking coating and the total amount of taste-masking coating relative to the total weight of the oxycodone<br>
10 granule with its subcoat have to be chosen so as to provide taste-masking effectiveness during the short period of time in the saliva and to ensure, following the swallowing of the granules, fas~ dissolving in pH ranging from pH 1.2 to pH 6. S. The ratio of the taste-masking<br>
15 coating to the total dry weight of ingredients comprising the oxycodone granule with its subcoat ranges from about 10:90 to about 50:50 and more preferably of about 20:80 (or 25%).<br>
20	The  taste-masking  layer  may  also  comprise  an<br>
antistatic agent, such as those listed above.<br>
The  granules  according  to  this  invention  can-advantageously be used in the manufacture of orally 25    disintegrating tablets.<br>
To this end, the granules described above can be<br>
mixed with at least one disintegrant and at least one<br>
soluble   diluent   agent   preferably   having   binding<br>
30    properties and then directly compressed so as to form<br>
tablets.<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
The compression force is adjusted so as to obtain a friability, measured according to the method of the European Pharmacopoeia, of less than 2%w/w and preferably less than 1.5%w/w, and so as to allow a disintegration 5 time of the tablet in the mouth under the action of saliva of less than or equal to 60 seconds and preferably less than or equal to 40 seconds.<br>
Hardness  is preferably comprised between  10 and 10    180 N,  preferably  between  15  and  100 N  and  more preferably between 50 and 80 N, measured according to the method of the European Pharmacopoeia (2.9.8).<br>
The present invention thus also pertains to orally<br>
15    disintegrating   tablets   comprising:    (a)   granules<br>
comprising a neutral core coated  with  oxycodone  or one  of<br>
its pharmaceutically acceptable salts and at least a<br>
binding  agent,  said  oxycodone  coating  being  further<br>
coated with a subcoat comprising a compound soluble in<br>
20    gastric fluid ; wherein said subcoat is further coated<br>
with a taste-masking coating comprising a polymer Gr<br>
copolymer with dialkylaminoalkyl(meth)acrylate units, and<br>
(b) at least one disintegrant and at least one soluble<br>
diluent preferably having binding properties,  wherein<br>
25    said disintegrant comprises crospovidone.<br>
The above tablets can include, for instance, from 1 to 20 mg oxycodone hydrochloride, preferably from 2.5 to 10 mg oxycodone hydrochloride, per tablet. 30<br>
The  disintegrating  agent  may  further  comprise crosslinked  sodium  carboxymethylceilulose,  which  is<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
referred to as croscarmellose. The preferred disintegrant is crospovidone alone.<br>
Usually, the disintegrant represents from 1	to 15%,<br>
5    and preferably from 2 to 10% and the soluble	diluent<br>
agent represents from 20 to 8 0%, and preferably	from 25<br>
to 40% of the total weight of the tablet.<br>
The soluble diluent agent may be a polyol having 10 less than 13 carbon atoms and being present either in the form of a directly compressible product with an average particle size from 100 to 500 um, or in the form of a pcwder with an average particle size of less than 100 urn, or mixtures thereof.<br>
15<br>
In a preferred embodiment, said polyol is selected from the group consisting of mannitol, xylitol, sorbitol, and maltitol. In the case where there is only one soluble diluent agent,  it is used in the form of a directly<br>
20 compressible product, whereas, in the case where there are at least two soluble diluent agents, one is present in a directly compressible form and the other in a powder fcrm, it then being possible for the polyol to be the same, the ratio of directly compressible polyol and of<br>
25 powdered polyol being 99:1 to 20:80, preferably 80:20 to 20:80.<br>
Preferably, the soluble diluent agent with binding properties is a mixture of mannitol in the form of a 30 powder with an average particle size of less than 100 urn, preferably Mannitol 60 and directly compressible mannitol with an average particle size from 100 to 500 [im, such as Mannitol 300.<br><br>

PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
It has been observed that crospovidone had a stabilizing effect on the degradation of oxycodone when the orally disintegrating tablets are stored under dry 5 atmosphere. The tablets according to this embodiment of the invention are thus preferably packaged in sealed containers such as blisters. In addition, they can advantageously include an anti-oxidant agent so as to better protect oxycodone from degradation which could 10 occur under moist conditions as a result of crospovidone degradation.<br>
Examples of saleable anti-cxidancs include ascorbic acid and its salts and esters, such as sodium ascorbate 15    and ascorbyl paimitate ; tocopherol and its esters such as tocopherol acetate ; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Usually, the anti-oxidant is present from 0.2 to 1 wt% relative to the total weight: of the tablet. It can 20 also be expressed as a ratio to the crospovidone used. In this regard, it is preferred that the anti-oxidant represents from 1 to 5 % of the weight of the crospovidone used.<br>
25	In- particular,  it has been found that ascorbyl<br>
paimitate efficiently prevented degradation of crospovidone under moist conditions and thus protected oxycodone from oxidation. The amount of ascorbyl paimitate that can be included in the tablets according<br>
30 to this invention can range from C.2 to 1 % w/w relative to the total weight of the tablet. It can also be expressed as a ratio to the crospovidone used. In this regard,   it   is  preferred  that  ascorbyl  paimitate<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
represents  from  1  to  5  %  of  the  weight  of  the crospovidone used.<br>
The orally disintegrating tablet	can also include<br>
5    various additives such as a lubricant,	a swelling agent,<br>
a permeabilizing agent, a sweetener, a	flavouring agent,    a colorant and their mixtures.<br>
The lubricant may be selected from those listed 10    previously.<br>
The amount of lubricant may range from 0.2 to 2 %<br>
(weight of lubricant/total weight of the tablet), preferably frem 0.5 to 1.5%. The lubricant can be 15 dispersed within the powder bed compressed into a tablet or, according to an advantageous embodiment, the totality of the lubricant can be dispersed on the surface of the tablet.<br>
20	The swelling agent may be selected from the group<br>
comprising native and modified starches.<br>
The permeabilizing agent may be selected from the group  comprising  precipitated  silica,  maltodextrins,<br>
25 beta-cyclodextrin, and mixtures thereof. The permeabilizing agent allows the creation of a hydrophilic network which facilitates the penetration of saliva and hence contributes to better disintegration of the tablet. The proportion of permeabilizing agent relative to the<br>
30	weight of the tablet is preferably from 0.53 to 5% by<br>
weight.<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
The  sweetener  may  be  selected  from  the  group<br>
comprising in particular aspartame, acesulfam potassium,<br>
sodium  saccharinate,   neohesperidine  dihydrochalcone,<br>
sucralose,  monoammonium glycyrrhizinate,  and mixtures<br>
5    thereof.<br>
The flavouring agents and colorants are those conventionally used in pharmacy for the preparation of tablets.<br>
10<br>
These excipients will usually amount to less than 10 weight percent relative to the total weight of the tablet, preferably from 0.1 to 5 %, even more.preferably from C.2 to 4.5%.<br>
15<br>
Moreover, it has been found that acetaminophen could be included within said tablets, provided that it is separated from the above-described granules coated with oxycodone. In this way, both active ingredients can be<br>
20 included in the same tablet while avoiding incompatibility problems between them.<br>
This invention thus also relates to orally disintegrating   tablets   comprising:    (a)   granules<br>
25 comprising a neutral core coated with oxycodone or one of its pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts and at least a binder, said oxycodone coating being further, coated with a subcoat comprising a compound soluble in gastric fluid ; wherein said subcoat is further coated with a<br>
30 taste-masking coating comprising a polymer or copolymer with dialkylaminoalkyi(meth)acrylate units, (b) acetaminophen which is not included within said granules, and     (c)  at  least  one disintegrant  and at  least  one<br><br>
WO 2008/015220<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
diluent,    wherein    said   disintegrant    comprises ccospovidone.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the oxycodone and 5 acetaminophen tablet further comprises an anti-oxidant. Suitable anti-oxidants are those described above, whereby ascorbyl palmitate is preferred. The amounts of anti¬oxidant and in particular ascorbyl palmitate are those described above. 10<br>
Acetaminophen can be provided as crystals or as granules wherein acetaminophen can be coated with a taste-masking coating. The excipients included within this taste-masking coating can be the same as listed 15 above. In this case, the taste-masking coating of the oxycodone granules and the taste-masking coating of the acetaminophen granules can  be the same or different.<br>
In  a  preferred  embodiment,   the  crystals  of 20    acetaminophen  are  granulated with  a binder  and  the obtained granules are coated with taste-masking coating.<br>
In a most preferred embodiment,  the crystals cf acetaminophen are directly coated with a taste-masking 25    coating.<br>
The tablet can include, for instance, from 1 to 20 mg oxycodone, preferably from 2.5 to 10 mg oxycodone, per tablet. 30<br>
The above-mentioned tablets car. contain from 30 to 750 mg acetaminophen, per tablet.<br><br>
WO 2008/U1522(&gt;<br><br>
PCT/EP2007/057912<br><br>
The1 tablet may further include the same additives as those d£scribed in relation with the acetaminophen-free tablet ^escribed above<br>
S The table according to the invention disintegrate in the mouth upon contact with saliva in less than 60 seconds, preferably in less than 40 seconds, forming a suspensi°n which is easy to swallow.<br>
JO	Thse tablets, as well as the granules described<br>
previously/ can be used in the relief of moderate to severe pain, such as in the management of breakthrough pain, in particular breakthrough cancer pain, by oral administration. Ereakthrough pain means a transitory 15 flare of pain of moderate to severe intensity occurring en a ba£kground of otherwise controlled pain.<br>
Granules may for instance be administered as such, packaaed i-n pouches, or in the form of capsules.<br>

Moreover, the Cruax of acetaminophen in the comparative tablets of Example 2 was 4. 4 ng/mL for the tablets containing 2.5 mg oxycodone and 4.0 ng/mL for the tablets comprising 10 mg oxycodone. At pH 1-2 {close to that of gastric juices!, it took 27 min to release 85% of APAP in the tablets containing 2.5 mg oxycodone and 12.9 min in the tablets containing 10 mg oxycodone. This slow dissolution rate of APAP is expected to result in too slow an  absorption rate of this drug.<br>

This table shows that the addition of a pore-forming agent in the taste-masking coating of oxycodone granules results in a significant increase in the dissolution rate of oxycodone, 5 especially at a pH greater than 5.5 such as pH 6.8. The addition of the pore-forming agent provides oxycodone taste-masked granules with pH-independent drug release profiles.<br>
Example  6:  Assessment of the stability of oxycodone -10    Comparison with oxycodone coated acetaminophen crystals<br>
Acetaminophen crystals were introduced into a fluid bed processor and a suspension of oxycodone, h ydrcxypropy line thy 1 cellulose (HPMC) as a binder and a    solvent cf water and<br>
15 ethanol was sprayed on the crystals. The granules were prepared by using a Mini-Glatt equipment with 100 g of support and a layering duration of 30 min at 25°C. The solvent contained 4 g water and 40.5 g ethanol. The composition and process parameters mentioned in Table 11<br>

The granules thus obtained were stored in forced degradation conditions  (80 °C, dry heat) and the amount of oxycodone remaining as a function of time, relative to the initial 5    content of oxycodone, was then assessed by HPLC.<br>
The results showed no significant change in the oxycodone content of Composition B after 7 days, whereas it dropped to below 95% for Composition A. Moreover, the oxycodone content 10 was also stable when granules of Composition B were prepared at 50°C using an aqueous solvent, whereas it was only around 86% for granules of Composition A prepared under the same conditions.<br>
15 This experiment demonstrates that oxycodone is more stable when coated on neutral cores than on acetaminophen crystals. This degradation of oxycodone is thought to be due to acetaminophen, which has been shown to degrade itself when in solution.<br>

After 21 days at 80°C dry heat in blister pockets, the tablets  including  a  subcoat  still  contained about  952 oxycodone, whereas the comparative tablets without subcoat 5    only contained about 70% oxycodone.<br>
This experiment makes clear that acrylic polymers bearing amino side groups, such as Eudragit0 E1Q0 or EPO, tend to degrade oxycodone and that this degradation can be inhibited 10 by providing a subcoat between the oxycodone coating and the taste-masking Eudraqit'5 coating.<br>
These results were confirmed by analyzing the total impurity contends  of  both  cypes  of  cablets,  after  21  days.  The<br>
15 impurities referred to included mainly oxidation products of oxycodone, such as oxycodone N-oxide + oxymorphone, but not those coming from the synthesis of oxycodone. The tablets including a subcoat only contained 0.30% impurities at that time,  whereas  the  comparative  tablets  without  subcoat<br>
20 contained 0.49% impurities, when stored in blisters for 3 months at 40°C / 75% RK.<br>
A similar trend was observed when the tablets were stored for 28 days in an open dish instead of being kept at 80°C dry 25    heat in blister pockets.<br>

After 21 days at    8Q°C   dry heat in blister pockets,  the tablets, including crospcvidcne still contained around 95c oxycodone, whereas the comparative tablets only contained 10    around 50% oxycodone.<br>
This experiment makes clear that acrylic polymers bearing amino side chains, such as Eudragit E100 or EPO, tend to degrade oxycodone (which has been confirmed by binary 15 mixtures of Eudragit15 E100 with oxycodone! and that this degradation can be inhibited under dry conditions by adding crospovidone as a disintegrant in the tablets.<br>
