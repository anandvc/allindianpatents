				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR MEASURING HEMOSTASIS<br>
Field of the Invention The field of the invention relates to testing of blood samples and more particularly to devices for testijig hemoscasis.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Methods of measuring the coagulation characteristics of blood are known. Some such devices attempt to simulate the natural flow of blood in the veins and arteries of a living subject.<br>
An accurate measurement of the ability of a patient"s blood_t_coagulate in a timely and effective fashion is crucial to certain surgical and medical procedures.  Accelerated (rapid) and accurate detection of abnormal coagulacions is also of particular importance with respect to appropriate treatment to be given to patients suffering from clotting disorders. Often the condition of such patients makes it necessary to administer anti-coagulants, certain fibrinolytic agents, anti-platelet agents, or blood components in a quantity which may only be determined after taking into account the abnormal components or "factors" of the patient"s blood which may be contributing to the clotting disorder.<br>
One measure of blood clotting is provided by the â– Thromelastograph j^EG"^) Coagulation Analyzer manufactured by Haemoscope of Skokie, Illinois,  The Haemoscope device measures the mechanical properties of the clot throughout its__structuEal_.develQisment..<br><br>
A number of references describe instruments for measuring blood clotting characteristics based upon simple mechanical movements.  These instruments monitor the elastic properties of blood as it is induced to clot under a low shear environment resembling sluggish venous blood flow.  The patterns of change in shear elasticity enable the determination of the kinetics of clot formation, as well as the strength and stability of the formed clot.  The strength and stability of the clot provide information about the ability of the clot to perform the -work of hemostasis" (i.e., stop or prevent abnormal bleeding) and about the adequacy of blood platelet-fibrin interaction.  The kinetics of clot formation provide information about coagulation factors available for clot formation.  Analysis of the information provides results which are useful to predict bleeding, to monitor and manage thrombosis, and to monitor fibrin^qlysis.<br>
While the instrument of the reference is effective in measuring hemostasis based upon resistance to mechanical movement, the apparatus necessary to cause movement and torque measurement is unnecessarily gomplex.  The apparatus is even more difficult to load and unload.  Because of the importance of measuring blood clotting, a better apparatus" for measuring hemostasis is needed.<br>
Svimmary A method and apparatus are provided for measuring hemostasis.  In one embodiment, the apparatus includes a torque sensing column having a torque sensing element and a drive ring disposed around a body of the column<br><br>
and in registration with the column so as to allow rotation of the drive ring around a longitudinal axis of the column.  The eitibodiment further includes a first; guide shaft rigidly secured to the drive ring, the guide shaft extending parallel to the longitudinal axis of the column and a cup holder movably attached to the guide shaft, allowing the cup holder to move parallel to Che longitudinal axis of the column.  The embodiment also includes a sample cup assembly adapted to engage the cup holder on an outer surface and the torque sensing element of the torque sensing column on an inner surface.<br>
The apparatus includes novel features which allow for the quick and easy replacement of blood samples.  A unobstructed front surface of the apparatus allows the operator better access for easier cup and blood sample placement,  A control lever on a torque measuring column of the apparatus allows a pin of the sample cup assembly to be quickly and easily ejected.  The sample cup holder may be lifted to a convenient position and a button on the bottom of the holder activated to release the sample cup assembly for easy removal.<br>

Detailed Description FIG.   1  is  a block diagram of  a system 10  for measuring hemostasis,   generally,   in accordance with  an illustrated embodiment of  the  invention.     Included within  the  system 10  is  a measuring unit  12  and  data collection  unit  14   (e.g.,   a personal  computer   (PC), datalogger,   etc.).   The system 10  is  constructed  in  a modular  form.     Features  discussed below provide   for  the quick and  easy  replacement of  individual modules  of   the system 10 without the need for re-calibration or complex re-alignment  steps.<br>
under  the  illustrated embodiment,   hemostasis  may be measured by the system 10 in terms of a series of shear elasticity measurements   (e.g.,   in terms  of<br>
dyn/cm^).     The resulting	hemostasis profile may be used<br>
as   a measure  of  the  time	it  takes   for  the  first   fibrin<br>
strand  to be  formed,   the	kinetics  of  clot  formation,<br>
the  strength of  the clot	tin shear elasticity units  of<br>
dyn/cm^)   and dissolution  of  the  clot.<br>
In general,   the system 10 measures a clot"s physical properties by cha use of  a combination<br><br>
cylindrical  cup and matching shear-inducing pin.      The combination cup and matching pin may be  constructed generally as  taught by U.S.   Patent No.   5,223,227   to Zuckerman,   assigned to  the assignee  of  the  present invention  and  incorporated herein  by reference.<br>
FIG,   2  is  a  perspective view of  one  exaimple  of   Che measuring unit 12.     Included within the measuring unit 12  may be  a  first  and  a  second measuring  station  14, 16.     While  the  system  10  shows   two stations,   14,    16,   it should be understood  that  there  is no practical   limit of   the number of   test  stations  that may be  incorporated into  the  system lO.     The measuring stations  14,    15  may be   functionally identical  and facilitate  the processing of   two  separate blood  samples  at  the  same  time. An  explanation will now be  provided of   the operation  of  the  first measuring station 14.     For purposes  of  explanation,   it may be assumed  that   the structure  of  the  second station  16  is  substantially identical   to  first  station 14.<br>
Each measuring  station 14,   16  may include  at  least three main structures.    The stations 14,   16 may include a cup carrier 18,   a cup carrier drive system 20  and a torque measuring  column 22,<br>
The cup carrier  18 may be provided with  a receptacle  sized  to  accept a  sample  cup  24   (containing a blood sample) .     Once a sample cup 24  is inserted into the  cup  carrier  18,   a pin 26 may be  inserted  into   the cup  24  of   the  cup carrier  18,     The  sample  cup  24   and pin  26  may be  fabricated of an   inexpensive material (e.g.,   plastic)   intended  for a  one-time  use.<br>
One difference between the cup and matching pin of the  Zuckerman   "227  patent  over   that used herein  relates<br><br>
to a configuration of the pin.  Under the embodiment, the torque sensing pin 26 (FIG. 9) is provided with a fully enclosing upper flange 114 which functions to completely close an upper opening of the sample cup 24. Such closure has been found importanc in preserving the integrity of Che blood sample against the effects of drying and oxidation.<br>
The pin 26 is also provided wich a circular aperture 116.  The circular aperture reduces the difficulty in engaging the pin 26 with the torque measuring column 22 as explained in more detail below.<br>
Once the sample cup 24 and pin 25 is inserted into the cup carrier IS, the carrier 18 may be manually lifted into contact wiCh a bottom of the torque measuring column 22.  Once the carrier 18 makes contact with the bottom of the measuring column 22, a skewer 2S (see cross-sectional view of the column 22 in FIG. 3) engages Che circular center hole of the pin 26.<br>
FIG. 4 is a cuC-away view of an erobodimenC of the cup carrier 18.  Shown included within the cup carrier 18 is a sample cup 24 and pin 26.  Shown between the cup 24 and pin 26 is a blood sample 30.<br>
The cup 24 may be fabricated for any convenient size blood sample (e.g., 350 pL) consistent with sampling accuracy.  An outer diameter of Che pin 26 and inner diameter of Che cup 24 may be selected to provide a 1mm gap on each side (2 mm total) within which the blood sample resides.<br>
During testing, the cup holder 15 is oscillated (i.e., rocated) around Che longitudinal axis of the skewer 28.  For example, the cup holder 18 may be rotated to a distance of 2 .4 degrees on either side of<br><br>
a center point during each cycle (4,83 degrees of total travel) . Each cycle may last 10 seconds with a IW second rest period at each end of the excursion.<br>
During rotation of the cup holder 18 and cup 24, the relative movement of the cnp  24 and stationary position of the 4in 26 creates a shear action between the inner surface of Che cup 24 and outer surface of the pin 26,  The shearing action causes a shear movement among adjacent blood molecules lying between, resulting in coagulation.<br>
As the blood coagulates, the shear resistance between adjacent molecules in the blood sample increases and the shear force that may be transmitted from the cup 24 to the pin 26 increases.  By measuring the torque imparted to the skewer 28 through the blood 30, a thrombo-elastic graph may be created over a time period.<br>
In order to preserve the integrity of the blood testing process, a port 93 (FIG. 3} is provided through the torque measuring column 22 for introducing a protective oil over the blood sample 30.  The port 93 is angled for the insertion of a pipette into the junction area between the pin 26 and cup 24,<br>
By introducing the oil into the area of the junction, capillary action causes the oil to be drawn into the cup 2 4 and overlay and protect the blood 30. Protection of the blood 30 has been found to be an important feature (against drying of the blood) where extended periods are required for coagulation testing. As a further feature for protection of the blood sample 30, a relatively closed cavity 38 is provided at the lower end of each torque measuring column 22.  The<br><br>
closed cavity functions to provide a protected environment  for  the blood  sample  during testing.      Such closed cavity.36 not only reduces  the possibility  that airborne  contaminants  may  enter  the  sample  30,   but   also tends  to control  humidity of  the  environment surrounding the cup 24.<br>
Returning now to the illustrative example of FIG. 3,   it may be seen that  the skewer 25 is coupled to a torque  transmission shaft  32 which  freely  floats  within the column 22  during test conditions,   suspended from a tungsten wire 34.     The tungsten wire 34 provides a progressive resistance to torgue from the skewer 28.<br>
The  tungsten wire,   in turn,   is supported by a stationary  cross-bar  31  disposed in  a V-groove.      The V-groove provides  a vertical  reference point  for alignment  of   the  pin 26   and cup 24,<br>
An  appropriate non-contacting  rotation detector (e.g.,   rotary variable  differential  transformer   {RVTD), rotary variable  inductive  transformer   (RVIT), laser/mirror/CCD arrangement,   etc.)   36 may be provided to detect rotation of the transmission shaft 32   {and skewer 28)   caused by  torque  transmitted by  the  shear force   through  the  blood  to  the pin  26.     By multiplying a detected rotation of   the  shaft by a spring  constant of  the tungsten wire 34,   a torque value may be periodically determined and  transmitted to  the  data collection unit 14   through  the interconnecting cable 16.<br>
The   tungsten wire  34  may be  fabricated  to  any appropriate  diameter   (e.g.,   0.007   inch)   and length (e.g.,   2   inches)   consistent with an expected torque measuring  range.      Further,   the  column 22  is   fabricated<br><br>
for  easy replacement  of   the wire  34   (or  the  column  22 itself)   where  it becomes necessary   (for  research  or other purposes)   to  adjust a torque measuring  range. This  also  greatly simplifies  replacement of  torsion wires  damaged by misuse  or otherwise.<br>
The  simplified procedure  for replacing  the   torsion wire greatly increases the flexibility and utility of the   system 10.     For example,   the  easily replaceable torsion wire allows a weaker torsion wire   (for increased sensitivity]   to be used for measuring weaker clots,   or a stronger torsion wire for stronger clots. To replace a wire 34,   the user moves  the control lever 42   to  a  locked position.     Next,   the  set  screw  35 (FIG.   3}   is  loosened  to release  the wire  34,<br>
To  remove  the wire 34,   a screw-on  cap  33   is removed and a pair  of  needle-nose pliers   (not  shownj may be used to grasp an end 31 of the wire 34 and lift it  out of   the column 22.     A replacement  wire  34   may  be inserted in place of the removed wire 34,<br>
Once   the  replacement wire  34  is  inserted,   the  set screw 3 5 may again be tightened.    Once the set screw is tightened,   the  skewer  28 may be centered using centering  screws   102,   104   (FIG,   1).     Adjustment  of   the centering  screws  102,   104  allows  a support cap  106 (FIG.   3)    to  be  laterally adjusted to  center  the  skewer 2 8   over  the  cup 24,<br>
TO  center  the  skewer  28  a  fixture  110   (FIG.   8)   may be   inserted  in place  of   the  cup 24  into   the  cup  holder 18.     A spacer block   (not  shown)   may be  used  to  bring the   skewer  28   into vertical  proximity with a  reference point  112   of   the   fixture  110.     The  centering  screws 102,   104 may be adjusted as necessary to center  the<br><br>
skewer 28 over Che reference point 112 of the fixture 110.<br>
To complete installation of the new wire 34, a torque constant (i.e., measured in torque units per degree of deflection) may be entered through Che keyboard. 15 into the CPU 14. Alternatively, a lookup table of torgue constants may be provided within the CPU 14 and accessed via a part number of a wire 3 4 entered through the keyboard. The torque value may toe used Co determine a measured torque by multiplying a torque deflection (in degrees) by the torque constant.<br>
Turning now to loading of the cup carrier 18, a side cut-away view is shown in FIC3. 5 of the cup carrier 18. A cavity 50 is provided in an upper surface of the cup carrier IS to receive Che sample cup 24.  Once Che cup 24 and tip 26 are placed in the cavity 50, the cup carrier is lifced into contact wich Che boctom of Che column 22 of FIG. 3.  Once in contact a spring-loaded button 52 provided on the bottom of Che cup carrier 18 is activated to seat the tip 26 onto the skewer 28. As Che bucton 52 is acCivated, an inner hole of the tip 26 is urged onto the skewer 28 up over a shoulder 40 on the skewer 28 within a cavicy 38 located in the boCCom of the column 22.<br>
Once the tip 26 is seated on the skewer 28, the cup carrier 18 may be lowered and the cup 24 seated back into its own respective cavicy SO.  After Che cup 24 is seated, the cup 24 may be filled with a blood sample 30 and again raised inCo an operating position against the bottom of Che column 22.  The cup 24 may be raised and lowered slightly several times, thereby using the pin 26 to mix the sample prior Co cesCing.<br><br>
Once the carrier 16 has been seated against the column 22, a registration lever 42 (FIG. 2) may be rotated to the right along a slot 86 to a test position.  Moving the lever 42 to a test position brings the tip 26 into a proper position with respect to the cup 24.  Rotating the lever 42 to the right rotates a cam 44 wiiich lowers the torque transmission shaft 32 from a locked position by a sufficient distance (e.g., 0,035 inch) to bring the tip 26 and cup into a proper spatial alignment with the cup 24,<br>
Once the cup 24 and tip 26 are brought into a proper relationship, an operator (not shown] may enter a patient name through a keyboard 15 on the data recorder 14.  At the saime time the drive mechanism 20 may be activated and testing may tsegin.<br>
A detached partial perspective view of an illustrative embodiment of the drive system 20 is shown in FIG. 6.  While the partial view of FIG. 6 shows the drive system 20 for the right testing station 16, it may be assumed that the drive system for the left testing station 14 would be substantially identical (with the exception of the cam follower 68 facing the other direction).<br>
Included within the drive system is a drive ring 60, A pair of parallel guide shafts 62, 64 extend downwardly from the drive ring 60. A positioning rod 66 extends radially outwardly from the drive ring 60 and engages a geared drive motor 72 through a cam follower 68 and cam 70.<br>
The drive ring 60 circumferentially engages the column 22 around a firs: abutting surface 46 (FIG. 3). The column 22 maintains the drive ring 60 in a radial<br><br>
alignmenc with the column 22 by moveable registration of an inner surface of the drive ring SO against the first abutting surface 46.<br>
Longitudinal alignment of the drive ring 60 with Che column 22 is maintained by trapping the drive riftg 60 between a second abutting surface 48 (FIG. 3) and a mating surface 74 on a top plate 75 of the measuring unit 12. The column 22 is retained in a fixed relationship with the top plate 75 through the use of a stepped hole 81 {FIG. 7).  An outer diameter 49 (FIG. 3) of the column 22 is sized to engage the hole 81 of a slightly larger diameter 79 {e.g., 0.005-0.010 inch). A step 77 at the bottom of the hole 81 allows for a fixed spacing between the second abutting surface 48 and top plate 76 and free rotation of the drive ring 60.<br>
A set of three screws 78 may be used to secure the column 22 to the top plate 76.  Removal of the screws 78 also allows for Che simple replacement of Che corcjue measuring column 22 should the need arise.<br>
The set of guide shafts 62, 64 extend downwardly from the guide ring 60 through a set of slots 80 in the top plate 76 to engage Che cup carrier 18.  A sec of linear bearings 82 on each carrier 18 allow the carrier IS to be easily moved up or down the guide shafts 62, 64.  A set of spring loaded clips 19 (FIG. 4) are provided below each linear bearing 82 to maintain the carrier 19 in a selected position during testing and otherwise.<br>
Movement of the guide ring 60 is accomplished by operation of the positioning rod 66.  The cam follower 68 of the positioning rod 66 is maintained in contact<br><br>
with the cam 70 by,operation of a spring 84.  More specifically, a cloc)cwise motion of the ring 60 (when viewed from above) is caused by the cam.  A counterclockwise motion of the ring 60 is caused by the spring 84.<br>
To obtain an appropriate cycling rate, the motor 72 may be geared to obtain a speed of one revolution every 10 seconds.  A flat spot may be provided on the cam 70 at a high point and low point to allow for a one and one-half second pause at the end of each direction of travel.  The profile of the cam 70 may be changed as needed to provide a wide range of periodic motions.<br>
The CPU 14 may provide for any number of tesC intervals.  For example, a standard test interval of 10-15 minutes may be used.  Alternatively, the test may be extended to 2-3 hours for research purposes.<br>
To maintain the blood sample 30 at an optimal<br>
temperature (e.g., 98.6Â°F +/-0.1
A dual channel temperature controller (e.g., a Love Controls Model 32A022-9502) may be used to provide separate temperature control and set points for each carrier 18.  The use of separate temperature sensors 55 and close proximity to the blood sample 30 ensures that each blood sample 30 is maintained at a precisely controlled temperature.  The availability of separate<br><br>
set points on the controller 86 for each carrier provides the versacility of performing standard testing or testing under abnormal conditions.<br>
Once a cup 24 and pin 26 have been installed into Che system 10 (as described above), a blood sample 30 may be directed into the cup 24 using a pipetce (noc shown) .  The cup 24 may be raised and lowered against the pin 26 to,mix the blood.  The hemostasis profile may be obtained as described above.<br>
Once testing is complete, Che sample cup assembly 24, 2fi may be easily removed by a series of quickly execuced steps. The Cip 26 may be ejecCed from the skewer 28 by moving Che lever 42 Co a load posicion (as shown in FIG, 21.  The lever 42 may then be simply moved downward inco a second slot 88 to eject Che tip 26.  Moving Che lever 42 downward causes a cenCer ring 94 Co move downward based upon ics distance from a pivot point 91,  As the center ring 94 moves down it presses against a collar 92, whicli acts against a spring 96 to eject the tip 26.<br>
Once the tip 2S has been ejected, the carrier 18 may be moved to a lower position and Che cup 24 and tip 26 removed.  The cup 24 and tip 26 may be ejected from the carrier 18 by lowering the carrier 18 until the button 52 on the boCtom of the carrier 18 makes contact with a lower cover 97,<br>
With a first hand, an operator may eject Che pin 26.  AC the same Cime, che operaCor may begin moving Che cup carrier IS downward wich her oCher hand.  As the carrier 18 is moved downward, the cover 97 activates the button 52, lifting Che cup assembly.  As the button 52 is activated, che operator may remove the<br><br>
cup assembly and replace it with another cup assembly. The sequence of steps may be performed as pare of a single rapid setjuence of steps without fear of spilling or compromising the integrity of the testing procedure. Once the cup 24 and tip 2G have been removed, the carrier 18 may also be removed for cleaning and sterilization.  To accomplish removal, the cover 97 is first removed,  under the cover 97, a cavity 98 is provided below the ends of the guide shafts 62, 64. The cavities 98 allow the carrier 18 to be easily slid off the ends of the guide shafts 62, 64. Once detached from the guide shafts 62, 64, the carrier 18 may be slid forward ami out of the measuring unit 12.<br>
The simple and rugged construction of the test unit 12 allows for reliable and accurate testing of blood samples.  The easy removal and disposal of sample cups and tips reduces the possibility of contamination or infection by users.  The easy removal and cleaning of related parts further improves upon the overall ease of use of the measuring unit.<br>
