Coiler plate for sliver-coiling devices, especially of<br>
draw frames and carding machines<br>
The invention relates to a coiler plate for sliver-<br>
coiling devices, especially of draw frames and carding<br>
machines, having a sliver channel with an inlet and an<br>
outlet for sliver and having a rotary plate, there being<br>
present on the underside of the rotary plate a cover which<br>
has a through opening.<br>
In a known coiler plate (EP-A-0 670 281, a round<br>
tube, as starting material, is shaped to form a three-<br>
dimensionally curved sliver channel. In the semi-finished<br>
product, the outlet bend is followed by a straight portion<br>
which is separated during completion of the sliver<br>
channel. The outlet of the sliver channel is so construct-<br>
ed that it terminates level with the base of the rotary<br>
plate. The base of the rotary plate has a through opening,<br>
the internal diameter of which is greater than the<br>
external diameter of the outlet of the sliver channel, so<br>
that a gap space is created. The gap space and the opening<br>
are introduced when the rotary plate is being cast. The<br>
panel-shaped cover of the rotary plate on its underside<br>
likewise has a through opening, the internal diameter of<br>
 <br>
- 2 -<br>
the cover terminating flush with the outer wall of the<br>
" sliver tube outlet. During assembly, the outlet of the<br>
sliver tube outlet is inserted through the opening in the<br>
rotary plate into the opening of the cover. A casting<br>
material is then poured in so that the sliver channel is<br>
fixed at an outlet by the casting material, the pour-in<br>
site being so covered by the panel-shaped cover that only<br>
the free cross-section of the sliver channel is free. A<br>
disadvantageous aspect is the considerable effort required<br>
in terms of manufacturing and assembly. In particular, the<br>
gap space, which is approximately elliptical in cross-<br>
section, has to be introduced into the rotary plate. In<br>
addition, care must be taken when sealing the sliver<br>
channel into the rotary plate with the casting material.<br>
The casting material is expensive. A further problem is<br>
the considerable amount of time required to close the gap<br>
space between the rotary plate and the sliver tube outlet.<br>
Sharp edges and transitions require laborious polishing.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is accordingly<br>
to provide a coiler plate of the kind described at the<br>
beginning which avoids that mentioned disadvantages, which<br>
has a particularly simple construction and which allows<br>
simple manufacture and assembly.<br>
That problem is solved by the characterising features<br>
of claim 1.<br>
Because a connection piece having a through opening<br>
 <br>
- 3 -<br>
is formed integrally with the cover by shaping, the<br>
openings and the connecting element for the sliver channel<br>
outlet are integrated into the cover. The opening, which<br>
is approximately kidney-shaped, is advantageously produced<br>
from the sheet-form cover by non-cutting shaping, a clean<br>
transition being created between the flat cover surface<br>
and the contours of the kidney-shaped opening, so that<br>
subsequent machining work is completely or largely<br>
unnecessary. In particular, there are no problems with<br>
adhering fibres or the like.<br>
Claims 2 to 56 contain advantageous developments of<br>
the invention.<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail<br>
below with reference to embodiments shown in the drawing.<br>
Fig. 1   is a diagrammatic side view of a carding machine<br>
with a can coiler that comprises a coiler plate<br>
for sliver in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 2   is a diagrammatic side view of the drafting<br>
system of a draw frame having a coiler plate for<br>
sliver in accordance with the invention;<br>
Fig. 3 is a coiler plate with a sliver can in longit-<br>
udinal section, in which a connection piece is<br>
formed integrally with the cover of the rotary<br>
plate;<br>
Fig. 4    is a perspective view of the connection piece<br>
 <br>
- 4 -<br>
formed integrally with the cover;<br>
Fig. 5   shows an embodiment in which a guide element is<br>
present between the connection piece and the<br>
sliver channel; and<br>
Fig. 6   shows a further embodiment in which the sliver<br>
channel is in engagement with the connection<br>
piece.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a carding machine, for example a<br>
Triitzschler TC 03 carding machine, having a feed roller 1,<br>
feed table 2, lickers-in 3a, 3b, 3c, cylinder 4, doffer 5,<br>
stripper roller 6, nip rollers 7, 8, web guide element 9,<br>
sliver funnel 10, delivery rollers 11, 12, revolving card<br>
top 13 with card top guide rollers and card top bars, can<br>
15 and can coiler 16. The directions of rotation of the<br>
rollers are indicated by curved arrows. Reference letter M<br>
denotes the centre point (axis) of the cylinder 4. Refer-<br>
ence numeral 4a indicates the clothing and reference<br>
numeral 4b indicates the direction of rotation of the<br>
cylinder 4. Arrow A denotes the operating direction. A<br>
flock feed device 17 is arranged upstream of the carding<br>
machine. The coiler plate 19 is rotatably mounted in the<br>
coiler plate panel 18. The coiler plate 19 comprises a<br>
sliver channel 20 with an inlet and an outlet (see Fig. 3)<br>
for sliver and a rotary plate 21 having a cover 22 on its<br>
underside (see Fig. 3). A connection piece 23 is formed<br>
 <br>
- 5 -<br>
integrally with the cover 22 (see Fig. 3). On simultaneous<br>
rotation of the can 15, the sliver 14 is coiled cycloid-<br>
ally in the can 15, so that the can 15 can be filled<br>
uniformly with sliver.<br>
According to Fig. 2, a draw frame, for example a<br>
Trtitzschler-Strecke TD 03, has a drafting system 26 having<br>
a drafting system inlet and a drafting system outlet. The<br>
slivers 27, coming from cans (not shown), enter a sliver<br>
guide means and, drawn by the delivery rollers, are trans-<br>
ported past a measuring element. The drafting system 26 is<br>
configured as a 4 over 3 drafting system, that is to say<br>
it consists of three lower rollers I, II, III (I output<br>
lower roller, II middle lower roller, III input lower<br>
roller) and four upper rollers 28, 29, 30, 31. In the<br>
drafting system 26, the drafting of the fibre bundle 27,<br>
which consists of several slivers, is carried out. The<br>
drafting operation is composed of the preliminary drafting<br>
operation and the main drafting operation. The roller<br>
pairs 6/III and 5/II form the preliminary drafting zone<br>
and the roller pairs 5/II and 3, 4/1 form the main draft-<br>
ing zone. In the drafting system outlet, the drafted<br>
slivers (fibre web 32) arrive at a web guide means 33 and<br>
are drawn by means of delivery rollers 34, 35 through a<br>
sliver funnel 3 6 in which they are combined to form a<br>
sliver 37, which is then coiled, by way of a can coiler 16<br>
and coiler plate 19, in sliver rings 38, in a can 39. The<br>
 <br>
- 6 -<br>
can 39 is in the form of a rectangular can and in the<br>
course of sliver coiling moves in the direction of arrows<br>
C and D underneath the coiler plate. The coiler plate 19<br>
comprises a three-dimensionally curved sliver channel 20<br>
for sliver 37 and a rotary plate 21 having a cover 22 on<br>
its underside. A connection piece 23 is formed integrally<br>
with the cover 22. Reference letter A denotes the running<br>
direction of the sliver bundle 27 through the drafting<br>
system 26. The coiler plate 19 is arranged in a coiler<br>
plate panel 18 (not shown in Fig. 2) which corresponds<br>
substantially to the coiler plate panel 18 in Fig. 1.<br>
According to Fig. 3, the sliver 37 (see Fig. 2)<br>
enters the inlet 20a of the three-dimensionally curved<br>
sliver channel 20, passes through the sliver channel 20<br>
and then emerges from the sliver channel 20 again at<br>
outlet 20b. The sliver channel 20 is arranged centrically<br>
in the rotary plate 21. During the coiling of the sliver,<br>
the rotary plate 21 rotates in the direction of arrow D<br>
about a rotational axis 211. The rotation of the rotary<br>
plate 21 about the rotary can 39 brings about circular<br>
(ring-shaped) coiling of the sliver in the can 39.<br>
A casting material 40 joins the sliver channel 20 in<br>
the region of its inlet 20a to a plate holder 21a. The<br>
sliver channel 20 is provided at its outlet 20b with a<br>
connection piece 23. It may be advantageous to fix and/or<br>
seal the outlet 20b in the inlet opening 23a of the<br>
 <br>
- 7 -<br>
connection piece 23, for example by means of silicone,<br>
adhesive or the like. The underside of the rotary plate 21<br>
is provided with a cover 22, for example a cover sheet of<br>
special steel. Special steel is wear-resistant and low in<br>
friction with respect to the sliver 38 coiled in the can<br>
39. In addition, mechanical machining (sanding, polishing)<br>
of the base of the rotary plate 21, which, preferably in<br>
the form of a cast article, consists of aluminium or an<br>
aluminium alloy, is avoided. The cover 22 is arranged to<br>
lie closely against the underside of the rotary turret 21<br>
and is affixed, for example, by adhesive bonding. The edge<br>
22', 22' of the cover 22 is bent up and rests against the<br>
rotary plate 21. A connection piece 23 having a through<br>
opening is formed integrally with the cover 21, the<br>
opening being configured for the passage of the sliver.<br>
The transitions 23', 23' at the outlet of the drafting<br>
system 23 are rounded.<br>
According to Fig. 4, the connection piece 23 has an<br>
inlet opening 23a, an outlet opening 23b and a wall 23c.<br>
The exemplary embodiment has a circular inlet opening 23a<br>
and an approximately kidney-shaped outlet opening 23b in<br>
the region of the cover 22. The connection piece 23 is<br>
formed integrally with the sheet-form cover 22 by non-<br>
cutting shaping, for example by pressing or deep-drawing.<br>
The transition from the flat sheet-form cover 22 to the<br>
wall 23c is advantageously rounded, so that fibre material<br>
 <br>
7**<br>
- 8 -<br>
cannot adhere. The sliver passes through the interior of<br>
the connection piece 23, that is to say the connection<br>
piece 23 is continuously open on the inside.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 5, between the outlet 20b of<br>
the sliver channel 20 and the inlet 23a of the connection<br>
piece 23 there is a guide element 24 or the like, which is<br>
approximately in the shape of a tube elbow or the like.<br>
The guide element 24 can consist, for example, of a pref-<br>
erably wear-resistant casting and can be affixed to the<br>
rotary plate 21 by means of a fastening 25. The upper edge<br>
at the inlet 23a of the connection piece 23 and the flat<br>
cover panel at the outlet 23b of the connection piece 23<br>
are arranged parallel to one another. The height h of the<br>
wall 23c can be small, which is advantageous from the<br>
manufacturing standpoint. Between the outlet 20b and the<br>
inlet 23a there is a small gap a, which can be associated<br>
with a separating wall (not shown) for the sliver. The<br>
construction shown in Fig. 5 can be modified so that there<br>
is no gap a, but instead the outlet 24a is connected to<br>
the inlet opening 23a. In that case, a sliver separation<br>
means, for example mechanical, pneumatic or the like, can<br>
be associated with the guide element 24.<br>
The embodiment according to Fig. 6 corresponds<br>
substantially to the construction shown in Fig. 3. The<br>
region of the outlet 20b of the sliver channel 20 can be<br>
associated with a sliver separation means (not shown) for<br>
 <br>
- 9 -<br>
the sliver. Sliver separation can be implemented, for<br>
example, pneumatically by means of compressed air which is<br>
passed through the wall surfaces of the outlet 20b (or the<br>
guide element 24 according to Fig. 5).<br>
The drafting system 26 shown in Fig. 2 can be used<br>
both for a draw frame, for example TC 03, and at the<br>
outlet of a carding machine according to Fig. 1 between<br>
delivery rollers 11, 12 and can coiler 19. In a draw<br>
frame, the drafting system 26 effects drafting of a sliver<br>
27 consisting of a plurality of slivers to form a single<br>
drafting system sliver 37 and in a carding machine the<br>
single card sliver 14 that emerges from the delivery<br>
rollers 11, 12 and can be coiled in the can 15.<br>

Abstract<br>
In a coiler plate for sliver-coiling devices,<br>
especially of draw frames and carding machines,<br>
having a sliver channel with an inlet and an outlet<br>
for sliver and having a rotary plate, there is<br>
present on the underside of the rotary plate a cover<br>
which has a through opening.<br>
In order to create a coiler plate in a simple<br>
manner, a connection piece having a through opening<br>
is formed integrally with the cover by deformation.<br>
