The work-holding vise 12 has a lover support 72 having outwardly extending flanges 74 adapted to be slidably received in the grooves 64 in the base vise 14 so that the work-holding vise 12 extends along the second axis 18. The jaws 22, 24 of the base vise 14 are adapted to engage the flanges 74 to securely clamp<br>
the work-holding vise 12 in place so that it does not move. Alterratively, the jaws 22, 24 of the base vise 14 may slidably receive the flanges 74 of tie work-holding vise 12 to allow it to be adjusted along the second axis 18 and to maintain a uniform elevation.<br>
Preferably, each jaw 68, 70 is mounted on the work-holding vise 12 by a lower guide portion 76 that is guided withln a central groove 78 in the work-holding vise 12 in a manner similar to jaw 22 in Figs. 3a and 3b. Guide flanges 30 ride in grooves 82 in the work-holding vise 12 in a manner similar to jaw 22 in Figs. 3a and 3b.<br>
Each jaw 68, 70 is manipulated by a threaded adjustment screw 84, 86, respectively, located at opposite ends of the work-holding vise 12. Each adjustment screw 84, 86 extends through a threaded hole 88 in an upstanding portion 90 of the work-holding vise 12. Preferably, the end of each adjustment screw 84, 86 is secured to its associated jaw 68, 70 through a hole 91 by set screws (not shown) in the same manner as wa.'$ discussed with respect to jaw 22 of the base vise 14. Each jaw 68, 70 has a face plate 92 secured thereto by fasteners 94 that forms a groove 96 with a surface 98 of the work-holding vise 12.<br>
Scribe marks 100 may be provided along an edge of the work holding vise 12 and on the outer sides of jaws 68, 70 in increments of measurement to enable the jaws 68, 70 to be precisely adjusted.<br>
As shown in the figures the work-holding vise 12 may have the adjustment screws 84, 86 located at the same end thereof. Alternatively, ii: should be understood that the adjusiment screws 84, 86 could be located at opposite ends of the work-holding vise 12.<br>
To provide even more adjustment options, the upper suiface of either the base vise 14 or the work-holding vise 12, or both, may be a removable plate (not shown) secured to the base vise 14 with fasteners, such as screws, and which may, upon removal of the fasteners, be rotated through any desired angle and re-secured to the base vise 14.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 8-10, the vise unit 10 is shown, with a second work-holding vise 104 mounted on the work-holding vise 12. The second work-holding vise 104 can he adjusted along an axis parallel to the first axis 16 and is mounted to the<br>
work-holding vise 12 in a manner similar to how the work-holding vise 12 is mounted to the base vise 14.<br>
As seen most clearly in Fig. 10, the base vise 14, the work-holding vise 12 and the second work-holding vise 104 all have one movable jaw and cne stationary jaw. For example, the second work-holding vise 104 has one movable jaw 106 and one stationary jaw 108. The movable jaw 106 is adjusted by an adjustment screw 110 in a manner similar to the movable jaws 68, 70 of the work-holding vise 12 shown in Fig. 6. The second work-holding vise 104 is mounted in the work-holding vise 12 by a lower guide portion 112 and is guided and held therein in the same manner as previously described with respect to the work-holding vise 12.<br>
An attachment 114 seen in Fig. 11 is provided for performing an operation such as milling on a work piece. The attachment 114 is a U-shaped device having parallel arms 116 connected at one end by a base 118, Each arm 116 includes inwardly extending protrusions 120. These protrusions 120 are adapted to engage notches 122 in either the base vise jaws 22, 24 or the work-holding vise Jaws 615, 70, respectively. As seen most clearly in Fig. 1, each jaw may have notches at e;ich end. Thus, one protrusion 120 would be inserted in a notch 122 in one jaw while the opposite protrusion 120 would be inserted in similar notch 122 in the opposing jaw. The base 118 hafi an opening 119 through which a threaded adjustment screw (not shown) extends to engage and move a vise along an axis. For example, if il is desired to move the work-holding device in a controlled manner along the sficond axis 18, the protrusions 120 of the arms 116 may be inserted into notches 122 in the base vise jaws 22, 24 such that the arms 116 are parallel to the second axis 18. The end of the adjustment screw (not shown) located within the opening 119 abuts the outer end of the work-holding vise 12 so that, as the attachment adjustment screw is rotated the work-holding vise 12 moves in a precise and controlled manner along trie second axis 12. The attachment 114 may be connected to either end of the jaw,<br>
In a lite manner, the Jaws 68, 70 of the work-holding vise 12 may include similar notches :so that the attachment can be attached thereto to mo .'e the second work-holding vise 104 in a controlled manner along the first axis 16.<br>
