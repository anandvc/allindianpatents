				<td>Locking Device and Method for Securing Telescoped Pipe<br>
Specification<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to connections between lengths of pipe, or between<br>
pipes and fittings. More particularly, the invention is directed toward a device and method of<br>
connecting two lengths of pipe in a restrained joint configuration, while employing a locking<br>
segment that is self-braking to prevent over-rotation and penetration of a spigot.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Due to thrust forces, earth movement, and external mechanical forces exerted on<br>
pipes, the industry has focused substantial attention on the problem of maintaining connections<br>
between adjacent lengths of pipe after installation. The result of this attention is a library of<br>
differing solutions and approaches known in the art. The majority of these solutions can be<br>
categorized into either "push-on" joints or "mechanical joints."<br>
Push-on solutions are exemplified by U.S. Patent No 2,953.398, and account for the<br>
majority of straight-run pipe connections. In a typical configuration, a spigot end of a pipe slides<br>
into a bell end of another pipe past a tightly fitted gasket. A variation of the push-on joint is<br>
evidenced by U.S. Patent No. 2,201,372, to Miller, which employs a compression snap-ring fitted<br>
within a special lip of the bell, in order to exert pressure onto locking segments and thus drive them<br>
into the spigot, restraining the joint against thrust forces. U.S. Patent No. 3,445,120, to Barr,<br>
likewise employs a gasket with stiffening segments completely encased therein that are generally<br>
disposed such that they and the gasket may roll between a locking and a free position. As the Barr<br>
gasket rolls under extraction forces, it is intended eventually to encounter a position in which the<br>
stiffened plane needs to compress for further rolling, in theory terminating the rolling and<br>
restraining the joint.<br><br>
Other examples of restrained push-on joints include U.S. Patent Nos. 5,295,697;<br>
5,464,228; and 5,067,751. The securemenfof the connection in such references is effected by<br>
locking segments or wedges within the gasket that engage the spigot. The locking segments<br>
possess a groove that mates with an annular rib on the bell, such that the rib acts as a rocker, or<br>
cam, or during some movements, as a wedge. During insertion of the spigot into the bell, the<br>
segments rotate on the rib, but are prevented from appreciable straight-line movement by the mating<br>
of the rib and groove. Upon experiencing counter-forces tending to effect removal of the spigot, the<br>
rib acts as a cam, both causing the segments to pivot on the rib as an axis, and exerting a radially<br>
inward pressure as the segment attempts to slide past the rib.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A locking segment for use in a restrained joint avoids over-rotation and penetration<br>
of the inserted spigot by muring between two surfaces in the bell, thus arresting rotation before<br>
positions are reached in which pressures on the spigot would result in likely penetration. The<br>
segment therefore can rotate to an effective locking degree, upon which rotation the radial forces by<br>
which the segment bites into the pipe increase. By virtue of the muring that prevents rotation<br>
beyond a desired maximum, a graph of the relationship between a radial force exerted by the<br>
segment on the spigot, in relation to the thrust force experienced could show a radial force that<br>
generally increases as thrust forces increase, but only up to a given point. At that point, the line<br>
representing radial force could be made to substantially plateau. By selection of materials and<br>
configurations, the plateau may be fixed below a spigot penetration value.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following stated objects of the invention are alternative and exemplary objects<br>
only, and no one or any should be read as required for the practice of the invention, or as an<br>
exhaustive listing of objects accomplished.<br>
As suggested by the foregoing discussion, an exemplary and non-exclusive<br>
alternative object of this invention is to provide a locking segment that is capable under certain<br>
conditions of self-braking, to prevent over-rotation or other un-capped increases in radially inward<br><br><br>
pressure as thrust forces increase.<br>
A further exemplary and non-exclusive alternative object is to provide a joint in<br>
which a locking segment is capable of selectively converting a portion of thrust<br>
forces into radiatly inward pressures, up to a maximum radial pressure that is<br>
thereafter unaffected by increasing thrust forces.<br>
A further exemplary and non-exclusive alternative object is to provide a joint that<br>
counters extraction of a spigot by distributing thrust forces into opposing axial<br>
forces in the bell, and a radial force between bed and spigot that has a<br>
maximum, which is below the magnitude of force that would fail the spigot.<br>
A further exemplary and non-exclusive alternative object is to provide an<br>
effective restrained joint that resists over-penetration of the spigot.<br>
The above objects and advantages are neither exhaustive nor individually or<br>
collectively critical to the spirit and practice of the invention. Other or alternative<br>
objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those<br>
skilled in the art from the following description of the invention.<br>

DETAlLED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following is a detailed exemplary description of an embodiment of the<br>
invention, in a number of its various aspects. Those skilled in the art will<br>
understand that the specificity provided herein is intended for illustrative<br>
purposes with respect to an exemplary embodiment, and is not to be interpreted<br>
as limiting the scope of the invention. References to "pipe" in this document,<br>
when used with respect to the present invention, shad be understood equally to<br>
refer to any pipe length, appurtenance, fitting, connection, or any other<br>
connected or connectabie device or element.<br><br>
As is depicted in Figures 1 and 2, the locking segment 1 of the present invention<br>
is optimally constructed to fit within a gasket 30 that is configured to fit within<br>
any standard push-on bed having a gasket seat configured with an annular<br>
trough 47, also known as a keeper groove, without necessitating changes to the<br>
configuration of the bell or spigot. Alternatively, the locking segment 1 of the<br>
present invention can be used with a mechanical joint having a thrust ring or<br>
gland follower, rather than a cast bell lip 44, so long as an annular trough 47 is<br>
present in the assembled joint.<br>
Looking to Figure 1, as will be understood in the art, a typical bell<br>
configuration (standard or non-standard) will exhibit, at a minimum, a socket<br>
area of the bell 40, having an increased internal diameter as compared to the<br>
flow-area internal diameter of the bed pipe. A beH lip 44 extends in a<br>
generally radial direction, which serves as an externally visible face of the bed.<br>
Moving axially inwardly of the bell lip 44, in the direction of insertion (shown<br>
by arrow 64), the bell 40 has a cavity for receiving and mating with the spigot<br>
70. In assembled operation, following insertion of a spigot 70, the cavity will<br>
take the form of an annular gap 60 between the spigot and<br><br>
the bell cavity boundary 45, which cavity boundary 45 in the shown embodiment is represented by a<br>
generally cylindrical internal wall of the bell, but which also may have ridges, ribs, gasket retainers,<br>
steps, varying radial depths, and other non-cylindrical characteristics such as gasket compression rib<br>
48, as depicted in Fig. 4.<br>
In addition to the cavity boundary 45, the shown internal configuration of bell 40<br>
includes an annular trough 47, arranged and suited in the shown configuration for the purpose of<br>
positioning a sealing gasket or other materials. This annular trough 47 may be located immediately<br>
adjacent the internal side of bell lip 40, as it appears in the shown embodiment (Fig. 1), or it may<br>
divide cavity boundary 45 into two axially separated sections. This annular trough 47 is bounded at<br>
its radial extreme by a trough terminus 42, which may be cylindrical as shown in the figures, or may<br>
be of other geometry, and is bounded on axially inward and outward sides a first interior surface<br>
and a second interior surface opposing the first interior surface, shown in the figures as a first wall<br>
43 and second wall 41, respectively. Trough first and second walls 43 and 41 are generally radially<br>
extending, though they may have a curved or slanted geometry, so long as they do not detract from<br>
the ability to brace the mured braking effect described in summary above or in greater detail below.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the second wall 41 is joined to cavity boundary 45 at a shoulder that serves<br>
as an insertion fulcrum 46 during assembly, but which during extraction movements of spigot 70<br>
bears no force and presents no radially inward cam-type influence on segment 1. Notably in the<br>
shown embodiment, the segment 1 possesses no radially outwardly protruding surfaces outside of<br>
annular trough 47 that would impede substantially straight-line movement of segment 1 as a whole<br>
in the direction of the bell lip 44.<br>
Moving still further inward of the annular trough 47 and the cavity boundary 45, the<br>
bell 40 possesses a shoulder 52 stepping the interior profile of the bell 40 to a lower radius of<br>
clearance. As will be understood in the art, this shoulder acts as a stop to further insertion of the<br>
spigot 70.<br>
Looking now at Figure 5, an embodiment of a gasket 30 for use with the present<br>
invention is shown. As will be appreciated in the art, shown gasket 30 is configured with a bulb 32<br>
for sealing a joint against fluid leakage. To this end, the gasket may be a complete ring with its<br>
outer diameter approximating or slightly greater than the inner diameter of bell 40 at the location<br>
into which gasket 30 is to fit. This bulb may be of an elastomeric or other resilient material sized<br><br><br>
with consideration taken to its elasticity and compressibility. In operation of the joint, if the gasket<br>
30 is intended to seal the joint, it should be sized to fit within the annular gap 60 only upon some<br>
compression between the spigot 70 and the bell 40. In particular, for any given spigot 70, gasket 30<br>
tends to have a slightly smaller inner diameter than the outer diameter of the spigot 70.<br>
Accordingly, insertion of spigot 70 into bell 40 will require exertion of force sufficient to compress<br>
gasket 30 against cavity boundary 45. In addition to the bulb 32, gasket 30 possesses a retainer heel<br>
31, configured to mate with annular trough 47 in such a manner that when gasket 30 is installed in<br>
bell 40, retainer heel 31 fits within annular trough 47 and positions bulb 32 such that gasket 30 is<br>
appropriately oriented. Typically, though not necessarily, retainer heel may be constructed of an<br>
elastomer of a higher durometer rating than that of bulb 32. As will be understood in the art, this is<br>
because bulb 32 should desirably be capable of flexibility and compression for sealing efficiency,<br>
while an increased firmness of retainer heel 31 may allow the retainer heel 31 to remain mated<br>
within annular trough 47 despite axial movement of spigot 70.<br>
In addition to sealing, gasket 30 retains locking segment 1 within a range of desired<br>
orientations during assembly. It thus should be understood that the gasket 30 need not necessarily<br>
effectively perform a sealing function to fall within the scope of the invention. Although in the<br>
shown embodiment and the remainder of this description the gasket 30 is sufficient to provide a<br>
sealing function, the inventors recognize within the spirit and scope of one alternative embodiment<br>
that the shown gasket 30 may be substituted with a simple positioning body, or retainer, operating<br>
to hold the locking segments 1 in a desired range of orientations during assembly. In such<br>
alternative, the gasket 30 need not have sealing properties, nor be continuous about the perimeter.<br>
It is possible in such alternative that the retainer be a wire or snap ring urging the locking segment 1<br>
radially outward.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2, an embodiment of a locking segment 1 is depicted.<br>
Reference to directions and orientation in this description of the shown locking segment 1 is made<br>
with respect to the orientation of the locking segment 1 as installed in a bell 40, seen in Figure 1.<br>
Locking segment 1 generally may be divided for discussion purposes into a first portion, or brake<br>
12, and a second portion, or toe 13. Brake 12 extends radially outwardly of toe 13. Toe 13 is<br>
constructed to engage spigot 70, at least upon movement of spigot 70 in an extraction direction. To<br>
facilitate this engagement, the shown toe 13 is configured as a wedge or triangular shape, and<br>
possesses on its radially inward bottom 9 as a toothed surface with at least one tooth 7, which is<br><br><br>
constructed of a material having a hardness sufficient to penetrate the surface of spigot 70. In the<br>
shown embodiment, the radially outward side of toe 13 opposite bottom 9 is top 8, is shown<br>
without teeth or any protrusion or extension that could impinge, rotate, or resistively meet cavity<br>
boundary 45. As shown top 8 joins to axially inward heel side 14 at a transition point 6. Similarly,<br>
bottom 9 joins an axially outward side of brake 12 at a braking elbow 2. Outward side 11 and<br>
inward side 14 are connected at their radial extremes by a mating surface 10. In the shown<br>
embodiment, the transition from inward side 14 to mating surface 10 serves also as forward brake 3,<br>
though it will be understood from the discussion below that the forward brake 3 need not<br>
necessarily be at the intersection of inward side 14 and mating surface 10 (e.g., it could be a<br>
protrusion or nub in the middle of inward side 14, or adapt a functionally similar alternative<br>
location). Similarly, the shown embodiment features an insertion brake 5 located as a portion of<br>
outward side 11 near outer corner 4, though the insertion brake 5 and outer corner 4 can in some<br>
embodiments be coincident, and, indeed, even in the shown embodiment the outer corner 4 may<br>
perform the insertion braking function of insertion brake 5 to some degree. In the shown<br>
embodiment, segment 1 appears with the angle between the toe and the heel between approximately<br>
120 degrees and 170 degrees.<br>
As can be seen readily from Figure 1, brake 12 is held by gasket 30 (or other retainer<br>
used in place of gasket 30) at least partially within annular trough 47, and having at least a portion<br>
of toe 13 extending exteriorly of the annular trough 47, and radially inward of the same, to allow<br>
contact between a tooth 7 and the spigot 70 in some orientations of locking segment 1. While the<br>
figures show an embodiment having the toe 13 extending from the annular trough, it is conceivable<br>
within the scope of the invention that the locking segment 1, including all portions of toe 13, may in<br>
some alternative embodiments reside entirely within the annular trough 47, so long as the toe 13 is<br>
capable of making resistive contact with spigot 70, whether by alternative configurations of the bell<br>
40 or the spigot 70. For ease of application to a wide range of spigots 70 and bells 40 as are already<br>
present in the market, the inventors have shown the particular embodiment having a toe 13<br>
extending from annular trough 47 to meet spigot 70, rather than an embodiment that may rely on<br>
special configurations of spigot 70.<br>
In assembly, locking segment 1 is molded into or inserted into gasket 30, with the<br>
brake 12 of locking segment 1 extending into the retainer heel 31 of gasket 30, as may be seen from<br>
the cut-away of Figure 5. Although not shown, the brake 12 can, in addition to extending into<br><br><br>
retainer heel 31, extend beyond the retainer heel 31, such that the brake 12 is visible from outside<br>
the retainer heel 31. As shown, the tooth 7 should be sufficiently near the surface of bulb 32 to<br>
allow penetration of the bulb and direct contact with spigot 70. It will be understood in the art that<br>
some alternative embodiments may not require or encourage direct spigot 70-to-tooth 7 contact. In<br>
such cases, the operation of the invention may continue in effect, though appropriate modifications<br>
may be necessary to provide a sufficient resistance between the locking segment 1 and spigot 70,<br>
such as special ribs or notches formed onto the spigot 70. Regardless of the mode of contact<br>
between locking segment 1 and spigot 70, typically, though not absolutely necessarily, a number of<br>
locking segments 1 will be dispersed about gasket 30. In the shown embodiment, fifty-six locking<br>
segments 1 are dispersed about a thirty-six inch diameter spigot 70. The inventors' experiments<br>
suggest the invention will bring ready improvements over the art to at least thirty through sixty-four<br>
inch pipe; the invention is applicable to smaller diameters and possibly to larger diameters as well,<br>
and, though not empirically tested, is expected to provide excellent results.<br>
Furthering the assembly, the gasket 30 is placed within bell 40, such that retainer<br>
heel 31 mates with annular trough 47. This assembly arrangement will cause brake 12 also to be at<br>
least partially within annular trough 47, and toe 13 to extend out of the annular trough 47 and into<br>
the cavity 49 (i.e., in presence of a spigot 70, the annular gap 60). In this orientation, prior to<br>
extraction movements of a spigot, segment 1 is in a resting position. The presence of the retainer<br>
heel 31 in annular trough 47 tends to secure the gasket 30 in place against axial displacement. In<br>
some embodiments, the locking segments 1 may further this securement, as well. Following<br>
insertion and seating of the gasket 30, spigot 70 is inserted into the bell 40 by movement in the<br>
direction of arrow 64. As spigot 70 passes lip 44, it will come into contact with gasket 30. Upon<br>
insertion pressures, spigot 70 will tend to push gasket 30 axially inwardly, but as a body, gasket 30<br>
resists such movement due to the securement of retainer heel 31 in annular trough 47.<br>
Consequently, bulb 32 is compressed within the annular gap 60, as may be seen in Figure 3. It will<br>
be understood that this compression has a number of effects. Among the effects are the sealing of<br>
the joint against fluid flow through the annular gap 60, and the relative centering of the spigot 70<br>
within the cavity 49 due to circumferentially distributed pressures of the gasket 30.<br>
As the gasket is compressed, it will be evident to those in the art that the locking<br>
segment 1 will rotate such that the toe 13 moves radially outwardly, but heel 12, being engaged<br>
with the annular trough 47, has a limited range of radial movement. In operation, during insertion<br><br><br>
the shown locking segment 1 rotates against insertion fulcrum 46, pivoting about<br>
this point as an axis of rotation. It will be understood by those in the art that<br>
although the insertion fulcrum 46 is shown as a right-angle shoulder, alternative<br>
embodiments of the joint described herein may form insertion fulcrum 46 as a rib<br>
raised in a radially inward direction from the cavity boundary 45, or as a<br>
depression at the intended location for locking segment 1, recessed radiatty<br>
outwardly from cavity boundary 45 to create a more gentle or a cammed fulcrum<br>
or other effect. The locking segment 1 is constructed and oriented in such a<br>
manner as to allow the locking segment 1 enough rotational freedom within the<br>
annular trough 47 and the annular gap 60 to accommodate entry of the spigot<br>
70 into the cavity 49. With the particular embodiment shown, due to closely<br>
mated profiles of the heel 12 and the annular trough 47, the radially outward<br>
rotation of toe 13 as it pivots on insertion fulcrum 46 may be limited by the<br>
contact between insertion brake 5 (which may be coincident with outer corner 4)<br>
and a wall of trough 47. In addition to other reasons, the inventors have drawn<br>
the locking segment 1 in this manner to take advantage of the enhanced<br>
retention of the gasket 30 in annular trough 47 made possible by braking<br>
rotation of the locking segment 1 on insertion. The shown configuration allows<br>
sufficient rotation to allow insertion of spigot 70 without extrusion or gouging of<br>
the surface of the spigot 70. In some applications, the user may desire to<br>
provide a tighter fit, even one that causes such gouging or scraping, in order to<br>
ensure an early bite of the tooth 7 into spigot 70.<br>
Following insertion, thrust forces and other forces tending to urge separation of<br>
the bell 40 and the spigot 70 will typically cause the spigot 70 to move in an<br>
extraction direction (example along the direction of arrow 63) relative to bed 40.<br><br>
40. By virtue of the pressure exerted by bulb 32 of gasket 30, tooth 7 will be in<br>
proximity to spigot 70, if not in direct contact. In one embodiment, tooth 7 is, in<br>
the uncompressed state of gasket 30, already exposed. This exposure may be by<br>
protrusion from the surface of gasket 30, or by slightly recessing beneath the<br>
surface in combination with the absence of gasket material covering the teeth.<br>
An alternative embodiment presents tooth 7 slightly recessed within gasket 30,<br>
and covered by a membrane or thin layer of compressible or puncturable<br>
material, so long as the depth and placement of tooth 7 are adapted to ensure<br>
engagement between tooth 7 and spigot 70 upon compression of gasket 30. In<br>
the shown configuration, locking segment 1 possesses a plurality of teeth 7, the<br>
tips of which are arranged in an arranged in an arcuate relationship. The arcuate<br>
relationship enhances the ability of at least one tooth 7 to bite into spigot 70<br>
despite any variations in circumference of spigot 70 or the inner dimensions of<br>
bell 40. This is because a larger annular gap (frequently due to manufacturing<br>
tolerances) will cause<br><br>
locking segment 1 in assembly to be rotated toward a less acute engagement angle 62 than exists in<br>
an installation having a larger spigot 70. Given the arcuate relationship of teeth 7, upon such<br>
rotation of locking segment 1 the teeth nearest the end of toe 13 rotate into contact with spigot 70.<br>
The arcuate configuration further urges at least two teeth 7 to be in contact with spigot 70,<br>
regardless of the rotation of segment 1, because a straight line can be drawn between any two<br>
adjacent teeth 7.<br>
In response to extraction movements of the spigot 70, locking segment 1 will<br>
attempt to move in an extraction direction along with spigot 70, but axial movement of the entire<br>
body of locking segment 1 is prevented by the pressing of brake 12 against first wall 43. Locking<br>
segment 1 then rotates such that toe 13 moves radially inwardly toward spigot 70. As the locking<br>
segment 1 of the shown embodiment rotates, the slope of brake 12 allows that portion of locking<br>
segment 1 to slide upwards against the wall of annular trough 47, preventing premature binding.<br>
The rotation of locking segment 1 is caused even in the absence of a pre-existing engagement of<br>
tooth 7 with spigot 70 due to friction between the spigot 70 and the bulb 30 in which locking<br>
segment 1 is disposed. If not already in biting engagement, as such rotation continues, tooth 7<br>
engages with spigot 70 by digging into the surface of spigot 70. Thus the further movement of<br>
spigot 70 causes a concomitant radially inward rotation of toe 13. Those in the art will understand<br>
that the relationship between the force of the axial thrust pressures on spigot 70 is by this process<br>
transferred in part into a radially inward force between the spigot 70 and the locking segment. The<br>
dynamic nature of the relationship results in increased biting, or digging of tooth 7, into spigot 70 as<br>
the pressures increase. To a point, this increasing radial pressure is advantageous, as greater radial<br>
pressure and the bite of tooth 7 exerted thereby may be necessary in response to greater axial<br>
extraction forces. It will be understood, however, that each spigot 70 will have a maximum<br>
sustainable radial pressure threshold, above which radial pressures exerted by the locking segment 1<br>
cause or make likely a complete penetration of the spigot 70 by locking segment 1, and thus failure<br>
of the joint. As described below, the arrangement of locking segment 1 in concert with bell 40<br>
prevents exceeding such pressures in the current invention.<br>
The brake 12 of the locking segment 1 fits within annular trough 47 in such a<br>
manner that it has limited rotational freedom. Upon rotation of toe 13 radially inwardly, it will be<br>
understood that brake 12 also rotates. Due to the confines of annular trough 47, rotation of brake 12<br>
is arrested by the muring of brake 12 between the first wall 11 and the second wall 41. As shown,<br><br><br>
the braking elbow 2 is forced during this muring against the first wall 43, and<br>
the forward brake 3 is forced against the second wall 41, resulting in a braked<br>
position for segment 1. It should be understood that, white forward brake 3 and<br>
braking elbow 2 are shown in the figures as terminating points on the inward<br>
side 14 and of the outward side 11 of brake 12, the invention is not so limited.<br>
Either or both forward brake 3 and brake elbow 2 can be protrusions from the<br>
respective sides, not necessarily located at the corners, so long as they are<br>
capable of muring between the first wall and the second wail in response to<br>
rotation. Additionally, given the variations in spigot and belt diameters<br>
experienced in real world applications, some configurations of brake 12 having a<br>
more rounded profile may not have a discreet pinpointabie forward brake 3 or<br>
braking elbow 2, so long as rotation of brake 12 causes points to mure between<br>
the first wall and the second wall. By operation of this muring, the rotation of<br>
brake 12 is arrested; in turn, as will now be evident, the rotation of the entire<br>
locking segment 1 is arrested (except, perhaps, for deformation that may occur<br>
to the locking segment 1 or to first wall 43 or second waN 41). As the rotation of<br>
locking segment 1 cannot continue, the radial pressures exerted by toe 13 on<br>
spigot 70 will not increase, despite an increase in axial thrust pressures. Contrast<br>
is drawn to the continuing increase in radial pressure that would be expected in<br>
the absence of a rotational braking mechanism. The invention may be used to<br>
cause the plateau for this pressure line, if graphed, to occur below a pressure at<br>
which spigot 70 is deemed likely to fail.<br><br>
As described, by means of the rotational braking, the radially inward pressures<br>
exerted on spigot 70 may be capped. In fact, the muring mechanism taught<br>
herein will cause a segment 1 to cease rotation at its maximum desired rotational<br>
point even in the absence of a spigot. Mathematically, despite the capping of<br>
radial pressures by muring, the forces in the system must remain net zero. In<br>
effect, the inventors believe (without wishing to be limited to theory) that the<br>
cantilever effect of the muring multiplies the axial forces applied by the locking<br>
segment 1 to the first wall 43 to offset the forces not transferred into radial<br>
pressures on the spigot 70, though it is recognized that the system is sufficiently<br>
dynamic with multiple variables that this mechanism may not always or purely be<br>
in play.<br>
In the shown embodiment, the profile of the brake 12 is complementary to the<br>
internal profile of the annular trough 47. Those sidled in the art will understand<br>
by reference the preceding discussion that the profiles need not match precisely,<br>
nor even nearly, so long as the brake 12 is fitted within annular trough 47 in<br>
such a manner as to mure between first wall 43 and second waH 41 upon<br>
reaching a maximum rotation. Furthermore, those in the art will understand that<br>
while the first wall 43 and the second waH 41 are discussed herein as if they<br>
were discrete walls, of the annular trough 47, the wads may be staggered or<br>
may have varying radial separations. By way of example, Figure 1 shows a first<br>
wall 43 as coincident with the inner face of bell lip 44. As further shown in this<br>
figure, braking elbow 2 actually would cantilever into a portion of the first wall 43<br>
that is more radiatty inwardly extended than any existing point on second wall<br>
41. It is possible that a bell configuration may have a radially extending wall<br>
offset from the annular trough 47. In such cases, the offset radial wall will be<br>
considered an<br><br>
extension of the first wall 43, even though it is offset from first wall 43 axially.<br>
It should be noted that in the shown embodiment, the axis of rotation of the<br>
locking segment during insertion is located in or about insertion fulcrum 46,<br>
while the rotational axis occurs at a different point during extraction. More<br>
particularly, the inventors believe that the axis of rotation during extraction is a<br>
"floating" axis that is located in the brake 12 itsetf. This floating characteristic of<br>
the axis allows the locking segment to seek its own orientation for locking<br>
spigots and bells of varying tolerances (example situations in which the annular<br>
gap 60 varies between one joint and the next). It is possible that in some<br>
installations, outer corner 4 may never contact any portion of annular trough 47.<br>
Alternatively, in tighter installations (example, those having a narrower annular<br>
gap 60), the outer corner 4 may contact trough terminus 42 and may even act<br>
as a cam in some respects. In normal operation, the shown embodiment does<br>
not take advantage of or exhibit any cam-type action outside of the annular<br>
trough. Further, the locking segment 1 of the current invention does not require<br>
any bell surfaces that are in front of the brake 12 to exert any radially inward<br>
pressure or that resist outward movement of the locking segment 1.<br>
