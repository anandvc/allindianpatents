This invention relates to a method of stabilizing a surfactant.<br>
Solid and liquid soaps have been used for cleaning human skin for a long time. The stability of the soap composition is an important criterion for problem-free use or a long shelf life.<br>
It is known that free radical reactions adversely affect the stability of a soap composition. Free radicals initiate chain reactions which effect the decomposition of the long-chain hydrocarbon chains of the soaps, free acids or synthetic surfactants and the like in cleaning compositions. Such reactions can also bring about other negative effects, such as, for example, discoloration and rancidification.<br>
Degradation of the long hydrocarbon chains can be prevented in cleaning compositions by adding antioxidants, such as, for example, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which either prevent the catalysis of certain free radical mechanisms or, as free radicals, terminate the free radical chain reaction.<br>
However, the use of BHT causes stability problems in the soap compositions, such as, for example, decoloration, or yellow-brown by-products form.<br>
WO 97/27839 discloses soap compositions in which the stabilizers used are specific phenolic antioxidants. However, these compounds have poor solubility and can only be incorporated with difficulty.<br>
The object of the invention was thus to find phenolic antioxidants, which have better solubility in soap formulations and can be incorporated without problem into the corresponding soap compositions.<br>
The present invention thus provides a cleaning composition comprising<br>
(aO   a phenolic antioxidant of the formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
radical of the formula (1k), 0I; and;<br>
R4 and R5 independently of open another are hydrogen; or C1-C22 alkyl; and<br>
(b)    a surfactant comprising a long alkyl or alkenyl chain.<br>
Ci-C22-Alkyl are straight-chain or branched alkyl radicals, such as, for example, methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, isopropyl. n-butyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, amyl, isoamyl or tert-amyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl, nonyl. decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl. octadecyl or eicosyl.<br>

C2-Ci8-Alkenyl is, for example, allyl, meth allyl, isopropenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-butenyl, isobutenyl, n-penta-2,4-dienyl, 3-methyl-but-2-enyl, n-oct-2-enyl, n-dodec-2-enyl, isododecenyl, n-dodec-2-enyl or n-octadec-4-enyl.<br>

Cy-Cg-PhenylalkyI is phenylpropyl, phenylethyl and, in particular, benzyl.<br><br>
In the novel composition, preference Is given to using antioxidants of the formula (1) in which Q      is -CmH2m-, and in particular a methylene or ethylene radical and m      is as defined in formula(1).<br>
In particular, V in formula (1) is -0-.<br>
Of particular interest in the novel composition are compounds of the formula (1) in which Ri and Ra independently of one another are C1-C22 alkyl and in particular   alkyl.<br>
Furthermore, there is also particular interest in compounds of the formula (1) in which a       is 1.<br>
Of very particular interest are compounds of the formula<br><br>
in which<br>
Ri and R2 independently of one another are C1-C5 alkyl,<br>
a      is 1 or 2; and<br>
R3, Q, V, T, b, c, d and e are as defined in formula (1).<br>

T	is as defined in formula (1),<br>
Of the compounds of the formula (3). preference is given to those in which<br>
Q      is ethylene;<br>
R3     is a direct bond; and<br>
Ri, R2, T and a are as defined in formula (3).<br>
Very particularly preferred compounds of the formula (4) are those in which T      is -O-CH2.<br>

Component (a) is generally present in the novel cleaning composition in a concentration of from 50 to 1000 ppm.<br>
The antioxidants used according to the invention have excellent reactivity and can thus be used advantageously at low temperatures. Furthermore, they display better stability to hydrolysis, particularly in an alkaline medium. Because of their good solubility, they can be easily incorporated into soap formulations.<br>
The novel compositions thus show high stability towards colour changes and chemical decomposition. This is to be attributed to the effectiveness, colour stability, ease of incorporation and stability to hydrolysis of the antioxidants used.<br>

The novel composition can be in the fonn of a solid, gel, syndet or liquid soap. It can be prepared by the usual methods.<br>
The soaps (solid soaps, syndets, liquid soaps) are prepared by processes which are generally customary in the soaps industry for these products and described in the literature (see, for example, L. Spitz (Ed.), Soaps and Detergents, A Theoretical and Practical Review, AOCS Press, Champaign, III., USA (1996)). An important factor in the preparation of solid soaps is the intensive mixing of the soap composition prior to extrusion to achieve a homogeneous distribution of the ingredients, in particular of the antioxidant. The antioxidant is usually added to the soap composition directly or, if appropriate, predissolved in perfume, homogeneously distributed therein by mixing (for example in a guide-beam mixer) and kneading (for example in an intensive kneader), before the composition is extruded or moulded. Liquid soaps are likewise produced by homogenization of the constituents in suitable mixing devices (for example Seltzer mixers, Ere stat mixers or DAT mixers from Pander), uniform distribution of the antioxidant generally being achieved more quickly than in the case of solid soaps as a result of the lower viscosity of the formulation. An alternative procedure involves incorporating the antioxidant into the basic soap composition (flakes, ribbons), if necessary with the application of heat (melting).<br><br>
The following examples illustrate the invention.<br>

Application examples<br>
Example 4 : Test as regards discoloration in soaps in an oxidative environment<br>
Antioxidants tested: compounds of the formulae (11). (15), (16), (25), (32) and (33).<br>
500 ppm of the respective antioxidant to be tested are, together with 500 ppm of benzoyl peroxide and 0.2% of titanium dioxide, homogeneously distributed in a customary soap base (mixture of tallow fat, coconut and palm kernel soaps) by vigorous mixing and kneading in a bench mixer. The mixing process is repeated several times to ensure homogeneous distribution of the antioxidant in the soap.<br><br>
The mixture is extruded using a bench extruder, producing test soap bars weighing approximately 1 g. These soaps are stored in a drying cabinet at 40°C for two months, individual test soap bars being checked for their discoloration after each week. This is carried out by quantitative colorimetry, the reflectance spectroscopic method advantageously being used. This method is described in detail in the literature (see, for example, Colorimetry, Second Edition, International Commission on Illumination (CIE), CIE publication 15.2 (1986)). Comparison of the coiorimetric results of the test preparations with those of the standard (freshly prepared sample having the same composition) is a measure of the colour stability of the antioxidant used.<br>
It is found that a good colour stability is achieved with the antioxidants tested.<br>
Example 5: Test as regards solubility in soaps<br>
Antioxidants tested: compounds of the formulae (11), (15), (16), (21), (23), (24), (32) and (33).<br>
To detemriine the solubility, 0,1% of each of the antioxidants is thoroughly mixed into a customary soap base (mixture of tallow fat, coconut and palm kernel soaps) at 40°C. The mixture is then cooled to room temperature and a light microscope Is used to check whether the antioxidant is homogeneously distributed in the soap composition (absence of crystals, no mixed phases).<br>
The results of these experiments show that the compounds tested have very good solubility and can be incorporated quickly and completely.<br>
Example 6: Test as regards stability to hydrolysis<br>
Antioxidants tested: compounds of the formulae (11), (14), (15). (16), (17), (21), (22). (24). (28), (32) and (33).<br>
The stability of antioxidants in alkali can be tested quickly using a simple test. For this purpose, 0.05% of each of the antioxidants is mixed, in a bench mixer, into conventional soap flakes which customarily contain 10-15% of moisture and 0.02-0.1% of free alkali (as NaaO)<br><br>
(overall values, % by weight). The mixing process should be repeated several times to ensure homogeneous distribution of the antioxidant in the soap. The samples are stored for 2 months in a drying cabinet at 40°C, and then the relative content of unchanged antioxidant is determined using HPLC analysis. The reference used (100% values) is the HPLC signals (heights or areas) of the respective antioxidants in freshly prepared soap formulations.<br>
Results:<br>
The antioxidants tested have good stability in soap formulations. Their content in alkaline soaps, as determined by HPLC, is virtually unchanged after storage for 2 months in accordance with the above test.<br>
The novel compositions (soaps) thus have good stability to colour changes and chemical decomposition.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
