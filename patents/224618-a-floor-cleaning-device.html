This invention relates to Floor Cleaning Devices and more particularly to suction-type Floor Cleaning Devices.<br>
A floor cleaning device comprises one or more rotatable brush members that, during operation, rotate while in contact with the floor and provide a washing/scrubbing action, water for said washing/scrubbing being supplied by a water tank usually located on the device. The feeding of the water from said water tank to the floor may be under gravity' or by means of a suitable pump. The wash water (waste water) left on the floor after said washing / scrubbing operation is collected in a tank referred to hereinafter as the collection tank that is also preferably located on the device.<br>
In one arrangement, the collection of said wash water is done by means of a rotating drum located between two generally cylindrical counter-rotating brushes (brush members). Under the momentum imparted by said rotating brushes, wash water is carried to the said drum from where it is deflected into said collection tank by means of a suitable scraper (deflector) blade that is also referred to in this field as wiper blade and by other terms.<br>
However in suction type floor cleaning devices said collection is done by means of a suction system comprising a suction blower acting through one or more suction members (suction ports) located such as to be in contact with the wash water on the floor. Said collection tank is also connected to said suction system such that said wash water collected by the suction system falls thereinto. This is the basic arrangement of said suction system in the prior art device and the device of the invention.<br>
Said rotating brush members may be generally circular in shape and rotate about vertical axes or may be generally cylindrical and rotate about horizontal axes.<br><br>
The prior art floor cleaning device of relevance to this specification is a said suction-type floor cleaning device and comprises a water system that supplies water to the floor for said washins/scrubbing by means of a suitable pump, a said suction system that comprises two said suction ports, one located fore and the other aft of a pair of generally cylindrical brush members that rotate about horizontal axes that lie generally transverse of the longitudinal axis of the device. Said water system further comprises a said water tank located on the device and water nozzle for discharge of water to the floor. By the term 'counter-rotating' is meant that each brush rotates in an opposite sense to the other the rotation orientations being such that each said brush pushes said wash water towards the other. This is also the description of the suction-type floor-cleaning device of the invention.<br>
Said longitudinal axis is generally parallel to the direction of motion of the device. The transverse axis thereof is taken to be the transverse line lying equidistant between centerlines of said two brush members. All directional and locational references in this specification both with respect to the prior art device and the device of the invention are in reference to said two axes and to the forward direction of the motion of the device unless required otherwise by the context.<br>
The application of the device of the invention is not limited to floor cleaning and extends to cleaning of other surfaces such as platforms, terraces, roadways, pavements and others. Thus, the device of the invention is really a 'surface cleaning device' but the expression 'floor cleaning device' is used in this specification as said expression is a very commonly used expression in the field of cleaning technology to refer to said surface cleaning devices. Therefore, in so far as this specification is concerned, unless the context requires otherwise, the term 'floor' is intended to cover within the scope thereof all said other surfaces.<br><br>
Floor cleaning machines of prior art are also described as 'washing/scrubbing' machines in the field and so the expression 'floor cleaning device' used for the device of the invention is intended to cover the term 'washing scrubbing machines' also and further any other term used in the art to describe devices such as the device of the invention. Said suction members are also referred to as 'Squeegees' in the field.<br>
A said brush member in this device of the invention may comprise a single brush or a plurality thereof If the latter, the brush segments constituting a said brush member can have different types of configurations within the scope of the invention. Further, said segments within a brush member may be different firom each other in respect of size, shape or other characteristics. However, references in this specification further hereinbelow are only to 'brushes'. This is in the interests of conciseness and clarity and it is to be understood that the scope of the term 'brush' in so far as this specification is concerned covers said singular brush and other configurations which may comprise a plurality' of brushes wherein said segments/sections are of different sizes and/or of other characteristics.<br>
It may be mentioned here that floor-cleaning devices that operate 'dry' that is without said washing/scrubbing action are known. Such devices merely provide sweeping action and are not of interest/relevance to this specification.<br>
The prior art suction type floor-cleaning device is operable in both directions forward and reverse. Said suction members thereof are raisable and lowerable by means of a lever handle and lever(link) system which operates such that in one position thereof one said suction member is in the raised position thereof while the other is lowered. Said collection can only occur when a said suction member is in the lowered position thereof and in contact with the wash water or when it is in contact with the floor, and therefore the appropriate suction member requires to be placed in (shifted to) the operational position thereof during said forward and reverse (backward) strokes.  It is also necessary<br><br>
to switch off the suction to the said suction member that is raised and therefore not in the operating position thereof This is to avoid waste of energy in the suction blower and decreased suction in the said suction member that is in the operating position. Means for said suction switching are provided on the device. This description also applies to the device of the invention*. Said lever systems that operate said suction member raising/lowering and said switching of suction are also referred to as 'link systems' in the field.<br>
Said prior art device comprises an operating handle by means of which it is pushed forward, for example, for the forward cleaning stroke and pulled backwards for the backward cleaning stroke. The lower end of said operating handle is joined to the chassis of the device and the upper end thereof has the general configuration of the handle bar of a bi-cycle or other two-wheeler with said switching means and operating knobs and switches for the various motors located at or near said top end. The upper part of said operating handle is pivotally attached to the lower part thereof such that said upper part is movable generally in the vertical plane of said longitudinal axis. Such a movement also referred to as the ergonomic movement is provided for adjustment of said upper part to the height convenient to the operator and means are provided to lock it at the desired height. This is also the construction in the device of the invention. Said lower part, which is rigid with said chassis, is also referred to as the 'pillar' in this field.<br>
Said upper part is capable of further movement in the prior art device. This movement, referred to as the port switching movement, also lies in the generally vertical plane passing through the longitudinal axis of the device. In the port switching movement the operating handle of the device is movable from a said 'convenient height' position by a small angle either forwards or backwards. Movement of said operating handle by said small angle in the forward direction causes the lowering of the said fore suction port into operating position and raising of the aft suction port into the non-operating position thereof and vice versa.   Said port switching movement also operates a valve means interposed<br><br>
between said suction ports and the suction blower of the device. In one position of said valve means said fore port is connected to the suction blower of the device while said aft port is isolated therefrom and vice versa in the other position. Movement of the operating handle through said small angle, thus causes the change of position of said suction ports and a corresponding change in the valve means position.<br>
Consider that the prior art device is required to be operated in the said backward stroke mode thereof The operator would then move the said operating handle forward through said small angle. This would cause the lowering of said fore port into the operating position and the raising of said aft port away from contact with the floor and wash water if any on the floor. Such forward movement also causes corresponding changeover in the said valve means position such as to bring said fore port under suction from the suction blower and cut out said aft port from the suction.<br>
The prior art device is also provided with locking means for locking said port switching movement. Said locking means of the prior art device comprises two lever handles mounted on said operating handle thereof Pulling of said two lever handles releases the lock on the movement of said ports, valve means and the operating handle. Thus to get the device for example, in the said backward mode of operation, the operator pulls said two lever handles and holding them in the pulled condition, moves the operating handle forward through said small angle. At the end of said movement, said lever handles are released by operator which locks said operating handle, ports and valve means in their new position, that is, said backward operation mode thereof.<br>
A drawback of the prior art device is the complexity of the port switching system and said locking means thereof. It will be seen that three link systems are required in the prior art device for hnkages between said two lever handles and operating handle and the said ports and valve means. Such multiple lever handles and link systems are cumbersome, difficult to operate and add to cost.<br><br>
In the device of this invention, in contrast, said port switching system comprises just one lever handle that is linked to said ports and valve means through a single link system. Said single link system of the invention comprises a bowden cable running down from the lever handle to an assembly of levers and linking members that during operation, activates said ports and valve means. As mentioned, the prior art device, in contrast, requires two bowden cables and three link systems for said port and valve means switching arrangement thereof<br>
As would have been gathered from the description hereinabove that the said port switching arrangement of the invention comprises one linkage system only and is operated by the pulling of just one lever handle located on said operating handle of the device. It would also be seen that the said port switching arrangement and the link system thereof are isolated from said operating handle, which simplifies the entire configuration of the link system. It may be noted that in the device of the invention, the operating handle thereof is not involved in said port and valve means switching. These novel features, and the others described below, make the floor cleaning device of the invention simpler in construction, lighter, less expensive and easier to maintain, manufacture and operate.<br>
Another novel feature in the device of the invention is that the operation (pulling) of said single lever handle thereof is required only when it is desired to change the device from the said forward to the backward stroke mode of operation and not for the reverse change. Said forward stroke mode is the 'default' mode and the said lever handle being spring-loaded returns the device to said forward mode automatically upon release of said lever handle.<br>
It will be seen that the device of the invention does away with movement of the operating handle for said operational mode switching, that is necessary in the prior art device. This novel feature offers reduced changeover time and less cumbersome operation. It will be observed that upon reaching the<br><br>
end of said forward stroke the operator has to merely pull said single lever handle to get the device of the invention in said backward stroke mode. When the backward stroke is complete the operator lets go said lever handle and the device instantly returns to said forward mode. .<br>
In the prior art device, the two bowden cables thereof, extend in front of the operating handle thereof. There is the risk of said cables fouling with the operator or with things around in this arrangement. Said cables also make the access to said water and collection tanks of the device difficult. In contrast, the single bowden cable of the device of the invention is housed inside said operating handle, that is, within the hollow operating handle. To obtain smooth and easy operation of said cable even while accommodating it within said hollow of the operating handle, this invention provides for a novel cam guidance for said cable. Said cam located between said lever handle and the fixed cable guide provided on the operating handle ensures proper alignment of said cable with respect.to said fixed guide and makes the cable operation smooth.<br>
Another important novel feature of the invention is the integration of said valve means with said suction ports. This is unlike as in the prior art device wherein said valve means is a separate component and therefore requires additional linking means. The suction port of the device of the invention comprises a generally fish-tail shaped part through which suction is applied to the floor. The fish tail part is provided with a skirting (lip) of resilient material that comes into contact with the floor and through which the suction reaches the floor. At the top of said fish tailed part is a generally spherical ball shaped member that forms one half of said valve means of the suction port the other half being a generally hollow cylindrical shaped, or ring shaped component that provides seating for said ball member and, further, is a conduit for the suction. Engagement of said ball member and seating part of a suction port shuts off the suction to said port, said engagement occurring automatically upon raising of said suction port.<br><br>
A still another novel feature of the device of the invention is the mounting of the suction ports thereof The suction ports of the prior art device and the device of the invention are generally longitudinal members that extend transversely across the device with their axes being generally horizontal. The mounting of said ports on the link system in the prior art device is rigid with the result that the suction ports of the prior art device caimot maintain uniform floor contact and pressure when coming across floor level variations and unevenness except to the extent possible because of the resilience of the skirting material thereof<br>
Pivoted moimting of said suction ports is provided in the device of the invention. The device of the invention further incorporates additional resiliency in the form of two compression springs from which each suction port in the device of the invention is suspended. The linking of a said suction port to the two said compression springs thereof is pivotal. Pivoting at two points together with said additional resiUency allows additional degrees of freedom to the suction ports of the invention in coping with floor unevenness. Said springs further ensure uniform contact pressure of the suction ports on the floor. The additional resiliency also reduces wear and tear on the skirtings.<br>
Said two compression springs of a suction port in the device of the invention are located one each on each side of said longitudinal axis. Said ports are pivotably mounted at the lower ends of said springs and said pivoting is on horizontal axes disposed parallel to said longitudinal axis.<br>
The brush mounting system in the prior art device comprises inverted generally horse shoe shaped brackets made of resilient material and located on the two sides of the device, right and left. Two said brackets are provided for each brush and they hold the two anti-friction bearings of said brush. The drive comes to the brush from one end thereof<br><br>
It is necessary to detach said brushes from their mountings on the device for cleaning or replacement. Detachment of a brush in the prior art device involves tilting the device so as to obtain access to said brush from the bottom, pulling out the non-drive end thereof together with the bearing at that end from the said bracket thereof, and then pulling said brush sideways and downwards to extricate the bearing thereof at the opposite end from the said bracket located at that end. It also involves the freeing of the brush from the drive system thereof at said opposite end.<br>
It will be evident that the procedure for removal and replacement of brushes in the prior art device is quite cumbersome and tricky. It involves considerable time and furthermore involves holding/gripping the wet and the dirty bristle portion of the brush. More important, the large and heavy device requires to be tilted so as to gain access to the brushes for said removal/cleaning/replacement as said brushes cannot be accessed otherwise.<br>
These drawbacks have been overcome in the device of the invention wherein said brushes are accessed from the side. By merely turning a screw and flipping up a flap type side cover, access is gained to said brushes easily and almost instantaneously. Said brushes can then be removed by simply getting hold of the near end of the brush body (brush core) and pulling the same to take out the brush sideways. This totally avoids contact with the wet and dirty bristle portion of the brush. Once said flap side cover is raised the near end of said brush core is quite easily caught hold of and pulled out of the mounting thereof at the opposite end (far end) without much effort. It will be seen that the opposite process of mounting the brush is also equally easy, fast and effortless in the device of the invention. It will also be seen that said tilting of the device is avoided in the device of the invention unlike as in the prior art device.<br>
Coming to the arrangement of said suction system in the prior art device, as mentioned hereinabove, the suction hose from said suction ports comes to said collection tank from which a hose goes to said<br><br>
suction blower. Said collection tank further comprises a float system to isolate it when it gets full. Said collection tank also comprises a lid. It will be seen that removal of said collection tank for emptying and cleaning would require detachment of the two hose connections whereby it is joined to the rest of said suction system. This is a drawback in so far as it would require tools to disconnect said two hose connections and in that it would mean a certain loss of time besides it being cumbersome. A further drawback is that the provision of said float arrangement within the tank interferes with the cleaning of the tank.<br>
There is an alternative arrangement in prior art wherein connection to said blower is provided in the lid of the collection tank while the connection to said suction ports is provided from the bottom of the sheet on which said collection and water tanks are placed in the device. The wash water comes in through said bottom connection in the sheet and up a riser pipe located in said collection tank and drops therein. A float arrangement is mounted near the top end of the riser pipe, which closes the riser pipe when said collection tank gets full. In this arrangement, while the detaching of said collection tank for cleaning/emptying is not so cumbersome the cleaning thereof is somewhat of a problem in view of the presence of the said riser pipe and float therein.<br>
In the device of the invention, both said connections and further said float arrangement are located on the common lid provided in the device for both said collection and water tanks. Furthermore, there are no internal fittings or encumbrances in said collection tank of the invention. This is novel and makes the detachment and emptying/cleaning of said collection tank an easy task. This also simplifies the manufacturing of said collection tanks particularly if it is of plastic moulding construction.<br>
In fact, the collection tank of the invention is simply placed in position over a generally flat sheet that also functions as a cover over the said suction and switching systems and the brushes of the device<br><br>
and the various motors. . Said lid also functions to locate the said collection tank and also said water tank and is a common lid over both. Correct location of said tanks is ensured by the rims of said tanks engaging in suitable slots in the under-surface of said lid and by the locational slots provided in the top of said cover. Said water tank has also been made free of any connections in the device of the invention. The connection for the hose going to said water feed pump is provided in said lid. It comprises a flexible tube that extends down from said lid into the water tank. A perforated disc filter/strainer is located at the lower end of said flexible tube to stop particulate impurities in the water and also acts as a ballast so that the said lower end of the tube remains generally at the floor level of said water tank. Said slots (ruts) for said collection and water tanks comprise suitable gaskets housed therein to provide a watertight and airtight seal, the weight of said lid being adequate to ensure said sealing and said location during operation of the device and during the transportation thereof Said lid is hollow such as to accommodate said two hoses of the suction system and one of the water system. This is novel. Said lid is hinged about an axis extending transversely of the machine.<br>
It will be observed that not only the construction and handling of said water and collection tanks are simplified in the device of the invention but the entire revamped system comprising said lid, said two tanks, said flat sheet (cover) and said hoses and flexible tubes is of simpler construction, lighter, easy to assemble/disassemble and maintain.<br>
Transporting said prior art device up and down staircases is problematic. Said prior art device comprises two fairly large diameter wheels for operation and transportation purposes. Said wheels are located at the rearmost end of the device. When a said device is required to be moved either up or down a staircase it is tilted backwards that is, the front end thereof is lifted off the ground till said brushes are also clear of the ground. With the entire weight of the device transferred onto said wheels, the device is then pushed/rolled to the desired new position. However, difficulties arise when the device is required to be taken up and down stairs as one or the other part thereof tends to foul with the<br><br>
stairs. Then it becomes necessary to physically lift and then transport the device over the stairs. In the device of the invention, the location of said wheels and the diameter thereof are carefully calibrated to prevent any such fouling problems. Furthermore, the combination of said location and the diameter of said wheel permits the device to be easily rolled slowly up and down the sides and the flat parts of the steps of a staircase unlike in the prior art device.<br>
This inventor observes that the causes of the prior art device fouling with the steps when being transported up a staircase are:<br>
i.	the circumferences(peripheries) of said wheels thereof do not extend beyond the<br>
rearside of the device, and<br>
ii-	lesser wheel diameter.<br>
This invention therefore provides for an offset for the said wheel peripheries from said rearside, said peripheries extending rearwards of said rearside of the device. Furthermore this invention provides for a larger wheel diameter than provided in prior art. Considering the common step sizes used for stairs, namely a height of 150-200 mm, this invention considers the wheel diameter to be preferably a minimum of 175 mm and said offset to be a minimum of 25 mm.<br>
In the prior art device, said water nozzle for providing said water for washing/scrubbing is located fore of said fore brush and another aft of said aft brush. It is the observation of this inventor that the collection efficiency is highest when water is sprayed in the zone between said pair of brush members than when it is sprayed outside the same. Another disadvantage in the prior art device is that provision of two nozzles requires a switching system therefor. Said middle location for said water nozzle has been adopted in the device of the invention and this is novel. This also does away with the need for a said switching system for spray water.<br><br>
The novel brush mounting arrangement of the invention has been mentioned hereinabove. Each brush comprises a generally cylindrical hollow core upon which the bristles thereof are mounted. The two ends(mouths) of said core have inten;al tapered generally conical surfaces at their mouths for mounting and engagement with similar surfaces of the two connecting members that are mounted in the brush ball bearings located in said side covers of the device. As mentioned hereinbefore, one said side cover is hinged at the upper edge thereof so that it can be lifted open to access the brushes from the side of the device unlike from below the device as is necessary in the prior art design.<br>
Said connecting member on the drive side of the device (left side in the embodiment described) extends through the ball bearing(s) on the drive side cover and is attached to the cogged wheel through which the drive comes from the brush motor. The drive transmission from said connecting member on the drive side to said brush core is by means of a gear type engagement. Said drive side connecting member has suitable grooves and ridges for the purpose, that engage with matching grooves and ridges on the said tapered mouth of the brush core. Both mouths of said brush cores are provided with said grooves/ridges so that any of the two brush core ends (mouths) can form the drive side. Said tapered ends on the brush cores and the connecting members are provided for easy brush removal. An 0-ring is provided on the tapered surface of each said connecting member. Said O-rings prevent rattling of the brushes during operation of the device. Said brush core mouths have internal shoulders that act as stops for the brushes when they slip over to one side or the other during operation.   This brush mounting of the device of the invention is novel.<br>
It will be seen that removal of brushes for cleaning/replacement is an extremely quick and easy operation unlike in the prior art device. Raising the side cover up on the non-drive side together with the attached bearing and the associated connecting member gives easy and almost instantaneous access to the brush which can now be slipped off the said connecting piece at the opposite end (drive<br><br>
end).   This arrangement does not require the brush to be held by the wet and dirty bristles portion as in the case of the prior art device.<br>
The prior art floor cleaning device is provided with a parking leg that is used when the device is not in use and is required to be parked. Said parking leg is pivotably mounted at the front of the device and is swimg into position when the device is required to be parked. The parking leg takes the load of the device at the front.<br>
This invention provides for a wheel at the end of the said parking leg and this is novel. Said wheeled parking leg stays withdrawn during the actual operation of floor cleaning and is brought down only when the device is required to be parked or when it is necessary to roll it to another location. Thus, the device of the invention can be conveniently rolled along by pushing on the operating handle thereof unlike as in the prior art device. It will be noted that the prior art device needs to be tilted backwards before pushing along with said operating handle.<br>
The device of the invention also comprises a set of wheels mounted on said side covers. At least cme wheel is provided on each side cover. Said wheels are fixed such as to be at a certain height above the floor such that they come into action when the bending of the brush bristles imder the device load crosses a certain point and/or when the brush bristle wear has reached a certain point. The purpose of said side cover wheels is to limit the load acting on the brush bristles during operation, that is to prevent bending of said bristles beyond a certain limit. It also prevents the situation where the brush bristles have worn out and the said side covers begin to rub against the floor during operation. This is novel.<br><br>
The device of the invention also comprises at least one wheel on each of the said ports thereof. The height of the said port wheels above the floor is such as to prevent the excessive deflection (folding) and consequent wear of said suction lips (skirtings).     TWs is novel.<br>
The novel features of the device of the invention described hereinabove make the floor cleaning device of the invention lighter, compact, less cumbersome, more efficient and easier to operate than the prior art device. The device of the invention is easier and simpler to manufacture and maintain, has less number of moving parts and a lesser overall inventory of parts.<br>
According to the invention, therefore, there is provided a suction-type floor cleaning device for cleaning<br>
of floors and other surfaces comprising:<br>
i.	a pair of rotating brushes,<br>

(d) said suction connections to and from said collection tank and the water connection between<br>
said water tank and feed pump being provided in the common lid thereof, said common lid being hollow<br>
and housing the lines from the said connections.<br>
It would be observed that the several novel characterising features (a) to (d) of the invention listed<br>
hereinabove are independent of each other.  Therefore, within the scope of the invention, the device of<br>
the invention as claimed can comprise any one, more or all said novel characterising features.<br>
The device of the invention comprises a chassis upon which are mounted said brush members, the drive<br>
motor for said brushes and the drive system.   The water feed pump and said water nozzle are also<br>
mounted on the chassis. Said lever (link) system for said raising/lowering of suction parts and switching<br>
of suction is also mounted on the chassis. Said suction blower is encased in a box and the latter is<br>
mounted on the chassis. Rigid with the chassis is said pillar, one on each side, on which said upper part<br>
of the operating handle is pivotally mounted. Said pair of wheels of the device is mounted on the chassis<br>
at the rear end thereof<br>
Said chassis is of generally rectangular centriguration and is of steel construction but other configurations<br>
and materials are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
A cover is provided over the components mounted on the chassis.   Said cover is of plastics but may be of<br>
other materials.   Said cover forms the platform on which are located said water and collection tanks.   A<br>
common lid is provided over said two tanks.  Said lid and cover are in fact, attched to each other and are<br>
in the configuration of a 'U', one arm of said 'U' being said cover and the other the lid.   Said two tanks<br>
are accommodated between the arms of said 'U'  Said two arms are hinged such as to allow lifting of<br>
said lid to gain access to said water and collection tanks.    Said lid is hollow and within it are housed<br>
various connections such as between the water tank think and  the water feed pump, between said suction ports<br>
and the collection tank and from the collection tank to the suction blower of the device.<br><br>
It will be observed that all connections to said water and collection tanks in the device of the invention are provided in said lid. Said two tanks are therefore totally free of any connections. This has been done so that the two said tanks can be quickly and easily lifted off said cover tor cleaning, filling or emptying as necessary. The water suction comprises a flexible tube that extends from the lid into the water tank. A metallic strainer/filter is located at the end of said flexible tube which removes solid matter from the water going to the water feed pump and keeps the suction point at or close to the bottom of said water tank. A number of different arrangements for said lid and cover, two tanks, connections and all other components are possible and are within the scope of the invention.<br>
The operating handle of the device comprises a generally U-shaped upper part and a set of two pillars located one on each side of the device. Said upper part is pivotably attached to said pillars. Said pivotal mounting allows movement of said upper part in the plane of the longitudinal axis of the device. A ratchet type locking means is provided to lock said operating handle in the desired position. At the top of said operating handle the switches for the brush motor, water feed pump motor and the suction blower motor are located. Other arrangements and configurations of the operating handle, the posts and the locking means are in the scope of the invention.<br>
Said suction ports in the device of the invention are longitudinal members that are located transversely on the device. They are of a generally hollow fish-tail configuration and are provided with skirtings (lips) of resilient material at their lower ends. One said port is located towards the front of the device ahead of the fore brush and the other towards the rear of said aft(rear) brush. They are referred to as the fore and aft ports.<br>
The device of the invention can carry out floor cleaning/washing both during forward and reverse movements.    For the forward cleaning stroke, the said rear/aft port is lowered into contact with the<br><br>
floor and remains in operation till the completion of the forward stroke. During the forward stroke, the fore port remains in the raised (non-operational) position. Before commencing the backward stroke the said fore port is lowered and the a&amp; port raised.<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, said ports have integrated valve means. Said valve means comprises a generally spherical member (ball) that, when a said port is raised engages with a valve seat to cut off the suction to said port. Said valve seat is a generally hollow cylindrical member at the lower end whereof is provided said seat. Suction is applied through said valve seat member and through said fish-tail portion and lip to the floor. Each said port is provided with one or more wheels. When a said suction port is lowered into operational position said lip thereof presses against the floor causing a certain amount of bending/folding thereof The object of said port wheels is to provide a limit to said bending/folding. Said wheels are located at a point such that they come into engagement with the floor when said folding/bending reaches a predetermined limit. The provision of said wheels extends the working hfe of said skirtings.<br>
The raising and lowering of suction ports is done by a link system that connects said ports with the lever handle provided on said operating handle of the device. Said link system comprises a bowden cable running from said lever handle to a system of levers and linking members that transmits the motion to said ports.<br>
A suspension system is interposed between said link system and said ports and comprises two compression springs for each port, located one on each side of said longitudinal axis. Each port is pivotably suspended from the said compression springs thereof. The provision of said springs and tlie pivoted mounting ensures that said ports remain in substantially full contact with the floor even when encountering floor imevenness and exert generally uniform pressure thereupon.<br><br>
Said lever handle is mounted on the operating handle of the device rather in the manner of a pair of bicycle brakes. In the rest position of said lever handle, the said rear port is down in its operation position while the fore port is raised (non-operational position). Pulling of said lever handle causes the lowering of the fore suction port and raising of the aft one. Thus the default position of said switching system is the forward stroke mode. Pulling said lever handle changes the said switching system to the backward stroke/mode. Said lever handle being spring loaded, it is necessary to hold it pulled during the course of the backward stroke. Thus the operator holds the said lever handle pulled while moving the device backwards during the said back (backward) cleaning operation. When said lever handle is released at the conclusion of said back stroke the switching system returns to the forward stroke configuration thereof.<br>
Said bowden cable of the link system is accommodated in the hollow of said operating handle. A cable guide is provided at the entrance to said hollow. Between said guide and lever handle is provided a cam type guiding member over which said cable passes. Said cam guide member turns upon the pulling of said lever handle and maintains the cable in general alignment with respect to said fixed guide. Other configurations of the said cable and linkage system and of the said lever handle are possible and are within the scope of this invention.<br>
An adjustable member is provided within said link system to enable adjustments to be carried out in the range of movement of said ports and to take into account dimensional differences arising in the manufacture and assembly of the device.<br>
Wash water comes to said collection tank through a flexible hose coming from said ports and suction is applied thereto through a flexible hose going from the tank to the suction blower. • Both connections are provided on said lid thus making the collection tank free of encumbrances. Removal of said tank for cleaning/emptying does not therefore require undoing of connections.    After lifting<br><br>
said lid the collecting tank is easily lifted off its location slot(cavity) in the said cover. A ball type float system extends from said lid into the collection tank. It shuts off the wash water entry when the collection tank becomes full.<br>
The water system in the device of the invention comprises said water tank, an uptake pipe extending to the bottom within said tank, a hose from said tank to the water feed pump, the water spray nozzle and the hose between said pump and nozzle. Said uptake pipe is a flexible tube with a small strainer at the lower end. It extends from said lid into the said water tank. The strainer removes solid matter and also helps maintain the said flexible tube substantially straight and extending to the tank bottom. The spray nozzle is located between the fore and aft brushes and gives a generally flat spray cone that extends over the full working width of the device of the invention. The flexible hoses to and from said collection and water tanks are housed in said hollow lid. Other configurations of said suction and water system and its components are within the scope of this invention.<br>
The brush system in the device of the invention comprises two rotating brushes, fore and aft, a brush motor and drive system connecting the motor and brushes. A brush of the invention comprises a generally hollow cylindrical core upon which the brush bristles are mounted. The mouths (ends) of said core have internal tapers that engage with similar tapered generally conical surfaces of connecting members located one on each side of a brush. Said connecting members are mounted in ball bearings located in the sides of the chassis, said chassis sides being referred to also as side covers. Said connecting members comprise 0-rings that engage the inside surfaces of said mouths. The 0-rings prevent the rattling of the brushes during operation. The brushes are counter-rotating.<br>
The brush drive system in the device of the invention is located on the left  side but can be otherwise. The drive from the brush motor is through a motor pinion and two gears one for the fore brush drive and one for the aft brush.    Said gears are attached to drive cogged wheels from where the drive<br><br>
passes to two driven cogged wheels which impart the drive to the respective brushes. Said connecting members on the drive side extend through the two ball bearings provided in the right side cover and are attached to the respective fore and aft driven cogged wheels.<br>
Gear type coupling is provided for transmission of drive from said drive side connecting members to their respective brushes. For this purpose, suitable ridges/corrugations are provided on said drive side connecting members and in the said mouths of the brush cores. Both the mouths of brushes are provided with said ridges/corrugations so that both ends of a brush are mountable on said drive side of the device.<br>
Said side cover on the non-drive side is hinged so that it can be lifted off. This provides easy and quick access to the brushes of the device of the invention for cleaning/replacement. By undoing the retaining screw and lifting off said non-drive side cover together with the bearing and the connecting member mounted thereupon access is gained to the right side mouths of the brushes. The brush is then pulled out sideways from its moimting on the said connecting member on the opposite side, that is the drive side. The brush mouths are provided with internal shoulders that provide stops against slipping of the brushes to one side or the other during operation.<br>
Said side covers have wheels mounted on them, with at least one wheel on each side cover. Said wheels are provided to prevent said side covers coming into contact with and scratching the floor when the brushes are worn out.<br>
The floor cleaning device of the invention comprises two wheels (transport wheels) at the back on which it is rolled along during operation and when moving from one location to another. Said transport wheels are mounted at the rear of the device such that the profile(circumferences) thereof extend behind the rear side of the device. The general offset between said rear side of the device and said wheel circumference(profile) is a minimum of 25 mm.   This invention further provides for the<br><br>
diameter of said wheels to be a minimum of 175 mm. This combination of a wheel diameter of minimum 175 mm and said minimum offset of 25 mm ensures that the device of the invention can be easily rolled along and up or down the sides of steps without it fouling therewith. This is novel.<br>
A swivelling parking leg with a wheel at the end thereof is provided at the front of the device of the invention. When the device is not in use and requires to be parked, said parking leg is turned down so that the wheel thereof engages the floor. This takes the weight off the brushes of the device and extends brush life and allows one to roll the device without the necessity of tilting when transporting from one location to another.   This is novel.<br>
In order to provide a clearer understanding of the invention and without limitation to the scope thereof, an embodiment thereof will now be described in detail by reference to the accompanying drawings wherein like numerals represent like parts.<br>

Ref No. (1) of Figure 1 denotes the chassis of the device whereupon are mounted a pair of brush members(2,3) comprising fore brush (2) and aft brush (3). Fore of said fore brush (2) is the fore suction member (suction port) (4) and aft of said brush (3) is the aft suction port (5). The water nozzle (6) is located between said fore and aft brushes (2,3). Said nozzle discharges water on the floor in the form of a generally flat cone extending over the working width of the device.<br>
Said suction ports (4,5) extend transversely on the device and comprise a longitudinal slot extending along the length thereof. Suction is applied to the floor through said slot and through the lip (7,8) that extends below from said slot and is in contact with the floor during operation of the device. Skirting (7,8) has slots (50) through which wash water from the floor flows into the suction port and from there to the collection tank (21).<br>
Suction ports (4,5) are linked to lever handle (30) through link system (9, 10) and a bowden cable (32). Said link system is an assembly of levers and link members. Lever handle (30) is spring-loaded and in the unpulled position thereof, the device remains in the forward mode of operation, that is cleaning of floor during the forward motion of the device.   Upon pulling of lever handle (30) the<br><br>
fore suction port (4) is lowered into the operational position while the aft port (5) is retracted up into the non-operating position. This is the backward mode configuration of the device. The operator, therefore, needs to pull lever handle (30) at the end of the forward cleaning stroke and before commencing the backward (return) stroke. The operator holds the lever handle (30) pulled throughout the said back stroke. Upon release of lever handle (30) at the end of said back stroke the device returns back to the forward mode configuration and is ready for undertaking once again the forward cleaning movement. Lever handle (30) is mounted on the operating handle (31) of the device at or near the top thereof and is in the general configuration of a pair of bicycle brakes.<br>
The suction system of the device comprises ports (4, 5) connected through flexible hoses (53, 54) to collection tank (17) and through it to the suction blower (28). The hose connections to the collection tank (21) from ports (4,5) and blower (28) are provided on the tank lid (20) thereof A float system (27) is also provided in lid (20). Tlie float system shuts off the hose connection to collection tank (21) from ports (4, 5) when tank (21) gets ftiU. The wash water arising from floor cleaning is collected from the floor by ports (4, 5) and flows into collection tank (21) under suction from suction blower (28). It will be observed that tank (21) is free of any encumbrances as all the hose connections (53, 54) and float system (27) are mounted on lid (20). It is therefore an easy operation to take out tank (21) for emptying and cleaning.   The same applies to water tank (17).<br>
Each suction port (4, 5) of the device is linked to link system (9, 10) through a suspension system (11-16) which comprises two compression springs (15) housed in brass housings (16). The suction ports are pivotably suspended from their respective springs (15). The pivoting allows the ports (4, 5) to tih when encountering floor level variations and maintain uniform contact, while the springs (15) ensure uniform floor contact pressure across the width of the ports (4, 5).<br><br>
Each suction port (4, 5) is provided with valve means (22, 23) which comprises spherical ball shaped member (55) and seating member (56). It will be seen that when a port (4, 5) is raised, the ball member (55) thereof engages with seating (56) thereof to shut off suction to said port automatically and vice versa.   Valve means (55, 56) is enclosed in bellows cover (57) as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Each suction port (4, 5) is provided with a supporting wheel#(58). The object of wheel (58) is to prevent excessive deformation and bending of skirting (7,8). It is therefore located a level above the floor level such that it comes into engagement with the floor at a certain level of folding/bending of skirting (7,8) and prevents further deformation. Wheel (58) ensures a longer working life of skirting (7,8). Suction ports (4, 5) are provided with an idler wheel (45) on vertical axis at each extremity thereof These are deflector wheels that deflect the device and prevent fouling of the device with walls or other objects.<br>
The water system comprises water tank (17), water pump (18), water spray nozzle (6), the uptake flexible tube (19) and interconnecting hoses/pipes. Spray nozzle (6) is located in the zone between brush members (2, 3) and sprays water in a generally flat cone configuration extending substantially over the whole working width of the device.<br>
Flexible intake tube (19) extends from said lid (20) down into water tank (17). A strainer is provided at the bottom end thereof It prevents solid matter going to said pump and nozzle. The strainer also helps keep said tube (19) straight, thus maintaining the suction point close to the bottom of tank (17).<br>
Tank (17) is also free of connections and encumbrances like collection tank (21) and can therefore be easily removed for cleaning. It is located on the sheet member (51) which is a cover over the device chassis and the components mounted thereupon.   Said cover (51) forms the platform whereupon are<br><br>
located the water tank (17) and collection tank (21).     Suitable slots/indentations are provided on cover (51) for placement/location of tanks (17, 21).<br>
As mentioned hereinbefore, lid (20) is a common lid for said tanks. Lid (20) is hollow and within are housed the various hoses going to and from said two tanks (17, 21). Lid (20) has suitable slots with gaskets that engage all around the rims of tanks (17, 21). Said gaskets provide seating for the water and suction systems and are appropriately airtight and watertight. Lid (20) is hingeably attached to cover (51), the two forming a generally U-shaped configuration, with the said tanks (17, 21) being located in between the two arms of the 'U'. Said hinge allows lifting of lid (20) to access tanks (17, 21).<br>
A brush (2, 3) comprises a generally hollow cylindrical core (37) over which the brush bristles are mounted. The two mouths (38) of a said brush core (37) engage with connecting members (39, 40) located one each on each side wall (41, 42). The engagement between a connecting member (39, 40) and the said core mouth (38) is by means of tapered generally conical surfaces provided internally in the mouth (38) and on the associated connecting member (39, 40). Said tapered mouths fiirther make the mounting and removal of brushes for cleaning/replacement easy. Each connecting member (39, 40) is provided with an 0-ring (43). This engages with the inside of the core mouth (38). 0-rings (43) prevents rattling of the brushes (2, 3) during operation.<br>
Brushes (2, 3) are provided with ball bearings. A single bearing is provided in the right side wall and two in the left side wall which is the drive side wall. Connecting members (39, 40) are mounted in said bearings located in the side walls. Unlike the right side connecting members (40) the left side connecting members (39) extend on the other side of the left side wall and are attached to the driven cogged wheels (24, 29) located there. The drive comes from the brush motor (33), through pinion (47) and drive gears (48) to the drive cogged wheels (25, 26) and from there to the left side connecting<br><br>
members(39) through cogged belts(49).    Connecting members(39) impart drive to the brushes(2,3). Cogged belts(49) are provided with tensioners(52).<br>
The drive coupling between left side connecting members (39) and brush cores (37) is a gear type coupling, both being provided with matching teeth configurations for the purpose. A brush core (37) is provided with said teeth configuration at both ends (38). Both ends of a brush are therefore connectable to the drive system.<br>
The core mouths (38) comprises shoulders (44). These act as stops for connecting members (39, 40) and prevent the brushes (2, 3) from sliding to one side or the other during operation. Side covers (side walls) (41, 42) are provided with wheels (46). These prevent contact between side covers (41, 42) and the floor when the brushes wear out.<br>
The operating handle (31) consists of a generally U-shaped upper part (59) and pillars (posts) (36). U-shaped part (59) is pivotably mounted on pillars (36) such as to allow movement therefor in the general plane of the longitudinal axis of the device. This movement is provided so as to allow^ the operator to adjust and set said U-shaped part (59) at a convenient height. The U-shaped part (59) can then be locked in the desired position by ratchet(serrated wheel)(60).<br>
The right side side-cover (42) is hinged at the top edge thereof It can therefore be lifted in the manner of a flap. It is provided with a retaining screw means (61). This arrangement makes the removal of the brushes (2,3) for cleaning/replacement quick and simple. To gain access to the brushes, screw(61) is undone and side cover(41) lifted up along with the right side bearing and the right side connecting member(40) mounted thereupon. The brush to be removed may now. be held by the nearside end and pulled sideways to disengage it from its mounting in the drive side connecting member(39) at the opposite end of the brush.<br><br>
The device comprises two nos. of wheels(62) located at the rear side thereof Wheels(62) are mounted such that their peripheries project behind the rear side of the device. Said projection, that is, the offset of their peripheries(circumferences) from the rear side of the device is 25 mm. while the wheel diameter is 175 mm. This offset and wheel diameter are provided to ensure that when the device is rolled up or down the sides of steps during transportation, there is no fouling between any part of the device and the steps.<br>
A parking leg(34) with a wheel(63) mounted at the end thereof, is provided at the front of the device, tlie purpose whereof is to take the device weight off the brushes(2,3) when the device is not in use and is to be parked. The parking leg(34) is swivellably mounted and can be swivelled into operating configuration by means of the handle(35) thereof Parking leg(34) makes it easy also to roll the device forwards or backwards when not in use as it makes it unnecessary to tilt the device before<br>
moving It.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
