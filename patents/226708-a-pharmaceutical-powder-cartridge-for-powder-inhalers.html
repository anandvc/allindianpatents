Description<br>
The invention relates to a pharmaceutical powder<br>
cartridge for powder inhalers for holding a<br>
pharmaceutical depot for a large number of<br>
pharmaceutical powder doses, having at least one<br>
reservoir and an integrated metering device, said<br>
integrated metering device comprising at least one<br>
metering slide which can be moved approximately<br>
transversely in a metering slide channel at least from<br>
a filling position to an emptying position,<br>
approximately transversely with respect to the<br>
direction of flow of the pharmaceutical powder out from,<br>
the at least one reservoir, and an inhaler equipped<br>
accordingly.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the field of treatment of bronchial diseases, and<br>
also of other diseases in which medication can be given<br>
via the airways, it is known not only to atomize<br>
solutions or suspensions into inhalable aerosols but<br>
also to administer powdered medicaments. Many examples<br>
of such medicaments are described in the literature,<br>
and of these we refer purely by way of illustration to<br>
WO 93/11773, EP 0 416 950 Al and EP 0 416 951 Al.<br>
A customary form of administration in this connection<br>
is delivery via an inhalation device (inhaler).<br>
Known inhalers for powdered pharmaceuticals include<br>
those for administration of a single dose and also<br>
inhalation devices which have a reservoir for a<br>
plurality of pharmaceutical doses. In connection with<br>
the latter, it is known either to provide separate<br>
reservoirs for each individual dose or to provide one<br>
single receiving space for receiving a multiplicity of<br>
doses of a medicament.<br>
Known inhalers in which a large number of individual<br>
doses are provided in separate reservoirs include those<br>
in which individual areas of the inhaler are each<br>
filled with a pharmaceutical dose. An example of such<br>
an inhaler is described in US 5,301,666 A. However, it<br>
is also known to accommodate a large number of<br>
pharmaceutical powder doses in separate areas of what<br>
are called blister packs. DE 44 00 083 C2 describes an<br>
example of such a blister pack for use with an inhaler.<br>
Such a blister pack, designed at the same time as a<br>
disposable inhaler, is described in DE 44 00 084 Al,<br>
for example.<br>
An inhalation device into which blister packs can be<br>
inserted, which each have separate reservoirs for<br>
individual doses of a powdered pharmaceutical and which<br>
can be emptied one after another with the aid of the<br>
inhalation device, is described, for example, in<br>
DE 195 23 516 C1.<br>
Many examples of inhalers with a reservoir for a large<br>
number of pharmaceutical doses are described in the<br>
prior art. One example with an exchangeable storage<br>
container is described in German Patent Specification<br>
846 770, and another in WO 95/31237.<br>
An important problem with inhalation systems in which a<br>
large number of doses of a medically active substance<br>
are accommodated in a common reservoir concerns the<br>
apportioning of an individual dose for one individual<br>
inhalation. In this connection, a great many solutions<br>
have been proposed, for example those which are<br>
described in US 2,587,215 A and US 4,274,403 A. Other<br>
types of arrangements for metering an individual dose<br>
of pharmaceutical powder from a reservoir for a large<br>
number of pharmaceutical doses are described, moreover,<br>
in WO 92/09322, WO 93/16748 and DE 35 35 561 C2 and in<br>
GB 2 165 159 A. An exchangeable cartridge for receiving<br>
a large number of doses of a pharmaceutical powder with<br>
an integrated metering slide is known from DE 195 22<br>
415 A1.<br>
Another important problem with inhalation of<br>
pharmaceutical powders concerns the breakdown of the<br>
galenic powder formulations into particles which can<br>
access the lungs. The active substances administered in<br>
this way are generally combined with vehicles in order<br>
to achieve a reasonable dosing capacity of the<br>
medically active substance and to set further<br>
properties of the pharmaceutical powder, which for<br>
example can influence the storage life.<br>
Proposed solutions for designs of powder inhalers with<br>
which particles which can access the lungs are intended<br>
to be made available in an air stream for inhalation<br>
are described in EP 0 640 354 A2, US 5,505,196 A, US<br>
5,320,714 A, US 5,435,301 A, US 5,301,666 A, DE 195 22<br>
416 Al and WO 97/00703, for example. Proposals are also<br>
known to use auxiliary energy to generate the air<br>
stream, for example in ZA-A 916741.<br>
In the use of medicaments for inhalation in powder<br>
form, it is also quite generally known to combine<br>
active substances by administering prepared active<br>
substance mixtures. Corresponding proposals are found<br>
in EP 0 416 951 Al and WO 93/11773, for example for<br>
combination of salmeterol and fluticasone or formoterol<br>
and budesonide.<br>
WO 00/74754 and many other publications over a period<br>
of more than twenty years have described how,<br>
particularly in powder inhalers, there is a<br>
considerable problem with moisture. Not only can<br>
moisture have a disadvantageous effect on the<br>
pharmaceutically active composition of the medicament,<br>
it can also impair in particular the interplay of<br>
physical and chemical parameters of the combination of<br>
active substance and auxiliaries. As a result, lumps<br>
may fora, for example, or the breakdown of the inhaled<br>
powder into particles which can access the lungs may be<br>
impaired. All these circumstances can lead to problems<br>
affecting the metering and the efficacy of the<br>
administration of a powdered medicament.<br>
To minimize these disadvantages, various attempts have<br>
already been made in the past to reduce the penetration<br>
of moisture into a powder inhaler by using seals.<br>
Attempts have also been made to reduce the<br>
disadvantageous effects of penetrated moisture by<br>
providing desiccants to absorb the moisture, in<br>
particular to keep the air moisture in storage chambers<br>
to a minimum.<br>
Prior art<br>
In the prior art, WO 00/74754 expressly describes how<br>
attempts to solve this problem have generally been made<br>
only by the use of desiccants in various forms. The<br>
Applicant there claims to have solved this problem by,<br>
for the first time, providing a seal intended to<br>
prevent penetration of moisture into the inhaler,<br>
particularly into the storage container of a powder<br>
inhaler with in particular elastic sealing elements.<br>
To this end, reference is made to sealing elements made<br>
from "all conventionally known materials, for example<br>
natural or synthetic rubber, a silicone or PTFE" and<br>
like materials.<br>
Subsequently, with reference to the "Clickhaler" powder<br>
inhaler from Innovata Biomed, an arrangement is<br>
described in detail which concerns a particular<br>
arrangement of the metering mechcinism of this inhaler,<br>
which comprises a metering device in the manner of a<br>
star feeder in the form of an inclined truncated cone.<br>
In the embodiment described, the sealing element<br>
provided is a likewise frustoconical sealing sleeve<br>
which is fitted over the truncated metering cone and is<br>
intended to be pivotable, so that it can assume a<br>
sealing position and a non-sealing position. Here, page<br>
5 interestingly describes how this sealing sleeve is<br>
preferably to be made of a synthetic material like that<br>
of the metering cone. It is further proposed that the<br>
sealing sleeve be provided with the same number of<br>
holes as the metering cone element has metering<br>
cavities. The sealing sleeve and the metering element<br>
are to be designed in such a way that, when both are<br>
turned, a metering chamber formed by an opening in the<br>
sealing sleeve first takes up the medicament from the<br>
reservoir and then, upon further turning, deposits this<br>
in the metering cavity in the actual metering cone and<br>
is finally conveyed from there into an air channel.<br>
A particularly advantageous embodiment is described in<br>
which the outer contour of the sealing sleeve forms a<br>
spherical section and provides a good fit with a<br>
corresponding curvature of the medicament reservoir.<br>
The inner contour of the sealing sleeve is intended to<br>
be adapted to the frustum of the metering cone.<br>
From US 6,132,394 A, it is known to provide, in a<br>
medicament chamber of an inhaler, a separate container<br>
containing a desiccant. This is described as differing<br>
from US 4,274,403 A in that a completely closed<br>
separate container is used which is made of a material<br>
which is as far as possible permeable to moisture and<br>
in which the desiccant, for example silica gel, is to<br>
be placed. An important advantage of this is said to be<br>
the fact that, compared to conventional dry capsules,<br>
there are no assembly or connection points through<br>
which small amounts of the desiccant can pass into the<br>
medicament chamber and thus contaminate the powdered<br>
medicament. In conventional dry capsules, such<br>
connection points are to be present in particular<br>
between capsule body and porous membrane through which<br>
the water vapor is to pass into the desiccant.<br>
The separate container is accordingly intended to be<br>
made as far as possible from a single material,<br>
preferably one with a high degree of water vapor<br>
permeability. Suitable materials proposed are<br>
polycarbonate (PC) and ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-<br>
styrene). The drying behavior over a relatively long<br>
period of time is intended here to be adapted via the<br>
material of the container.<br>
WO 01/46038 discloses the use of a stopper, a foil, a<br>
tablet or a lining of an EVA copolymer with 35-80% by<br>
weight of a desiccant such as silica gel, clay or zinc<br>
chloride as desiccant capsule or embedded in a storage<br>
container in particular for packaged foods, mention<br>
being made of deficient mechanical stability of the<br>
stopper etc., and the risk of mechanical decomposition<br>
at relatively high concentrations of desiccant. Here,<br>
the EVA types described as being suitable have quite<br>
high proportions of vinyl acetate copolymers, so that<br>
these materials have very high water vapor<br>
permeability.<br>
WO 01/21238 discloses a powder inhaler with hermetic<br>
sealing when not in use. To this end, in the case of a<br>
powder inhaler with a medicament reservoir and with an<br>
air channel running through under the reservoir, a<br>
sealing skirt is provided on each side of the storage<br>
container and covers an air inlet opening and an<br>
inhalation opening of the air channel in a position of<br>
rest. When an actuating cap is actuated to move a<br>
metering plunger through the storage space in order to<br>
convey a dose of medicament from the reservoir into the<br>
air channel, the two sealing skirts secured on the<br>
actuating cap are moved downward too until the metering<br>
plunger has reached its emptying position. Through-<br>
holes are provided in the sealing skirts and are<br>
arranged in such a way that, with the actuating cap in<br>
the end position, they free the openings of the air<br>
channel. As long as the actuating cap is kept<br>
depressed, the air can be sucked thrdugh the air<br>
channel. When the actuating cap is released and returns<br>
to its starting position, the openings of the air<br>
channel are closed again.<br>
By means of an additional guide arrangement and an<br>
elastic design of the sealing skirts, these are pressed<br>
against the outer wall in order to increase the sealing<br>
effect. In this arrangement, as the distance traveled<br>
from the opening position to the closing position<br>
increases, the sealing skirts are pressed increasingly<br>
more strongly against the outer wall of the inhaler<br>
transverse to the direction of movement. An elastic<br>
seal in the form of a bellows is also provided between<br>
actuating cap and inhaler housing in order to close the<br>
gap between said structural parts.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to improve<br>
known systems for administering powdered<br>
pharmaceuticals.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by<br>
means of a pharmaceutical powder cartridge for powder<br>
inhalers for holding a pharmaceutical depot for a large<br>
number of pharmaceutical powder doses, having at least<br>
one reservoir and an integrated metering aevice, said<br>
integrated metering device comprising at least one<br>
metering slide which can be moved approximately<br>
transversely in a metering slide channel at least from<br>
a filling position to an emptying position,<br>
approximately transversely with respect to the<br>
direction of flow of the pharmaceutical powder out from<br>
the at least one reservoir, the metering slide channel<br>
with the at least one metering slide being sealed off<br>
from the environment at least in the filling position<br>
of the metering slide.<br>
By means of the design according to the invention, and<br>
for only the slightest additional expenditure, an<br>
effective protection of the pharmaceutical reservoir<br>
against moisture from the environment is obtained, in<br>
particular during intermediate storage during the<br>
period of use after the patient has begun using the<br>
reservoir. This advantage applies both while the<br>
pharmaceutical cartridge is fitted in an inhaler and<br>
also when it is being stored outside the inhaler.<br>
Compatibility with known powder inhalers for<br>
exchangeable pharmaceutical powder cartridges of the<br>
type mentioned at the outset can be maintained.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, a<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge according to the<br>
invention is characterized in that the metering slide<br>
channel has, at one end, an opening to the environment<br>
through which a part of the metering slide can pass,<br>
and, around the opening, a contact surface is provided<br>
for a seal.<br>
A particularly reliable function can be achieved if the<br>
metering slide has a sealing surface provided in a<br>
plane approximately transverse to its direction of<br>
movement from the filling position to the emptying<br>
position. In this way, it is at the same time possible<br>
to avoid a change of frictional forces during the<br>
movement of the metering slide which, in known<br>
inhalers, can be caused by a movement of the seal along<br>
the sealing surface, by powder residues or wear of the<br>
seal.<br>
Particularly reliable sealing is achieved if said<br>
sealing is provided by an elastic seal.<br>
In the case of prolonged storage prior to the<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge being inserted into an<br>
inhaler, an especially permanent and effective sealing<br>
is guaranteed if the metering slide can further be<br>
moved into an additional storing position and the seal<br>
is elastically prestressed sealingly at least in the<br>
storing position of the metering slide, especially if<br>
the metering slide is fixed in the storing position by<br>
resiliently elastic means.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a pharmaceutical powder<br>
cartridge according to the invention is characterized<br>
in that the metering device comprises at least one<br>
metering cavity for holding a predetermined quantity of<br>
a pharmaceutical powder.<br>
For administering active substance combinations, it can<br>
also be advantageous if the pharmaceutical powder<br>
cartridge has at least two reservoirs, in particular if<br>
the pharmaceutical powder cartridge has a metering<br>
device, said metering device having, for each of the<br>
reservoirs, a metering cavity for apportioning a<br>
predetermined quantity of each medically active<br>
substance provided in the reservoirs. Depending on the<br>
active substance combination provided, it is also<br>
advantageous if the metering devices of the individual<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridges have metering cavities<br>
of identical or different volume.<br>
A particularly economical application, especially<br>
suitable for expensive pharmaceutical powders with only<br>
occasional administration, is possible if the<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge further has a device<br>
for indicating the quantity of pharmaceutical doses<br>
which remain in the reservoir chambers or which have<br>
been removed from the reservoir chambers.<br>
The advantages of the invention can be used especially<br>
in long-term use of a pharmaceutical powder cartridge<br>
for powder inhalers for holding a pharmaceutical depot<br>
for a large number of pharmaceutical powder doses,<br>
having at least one reservoir and an integrated<br>
metering device, said integrated metering device being<br>
able to assume at least a filling position and an<br>
emptying position and being able to move from the<br>
filling position to the emptying position, and with a<br>
seal being provided which substantially seals off the<br>
reservoir from the environment and against entry of<br>
moisture, at least in the filling position of the<br>
metering device, said seal being elastically<br>
deformable, during a movement of the metering device<br>
from its emptying position to its filling position,<br>
without any sliding movement of the seal relative to<br>
the sealing surfaces.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the seal is<br>
made of a silicone rubber or an elastomer, more<br>
preferably a thermoplastic elastomer, preferably of<br>
TPEE (thermoplastic polyester elastomer).<br>
The improvement in the application properties afforded<br>
by the invention, particularly through actively<br>
reducing the effect of moisture on a pharmaceutical<br>
powder during the period of use by a patient or a<br>
hospital establishment, is further achieved by means of<br>
a pharmaceutical powder cartridge for powder inhalers<br>
or a powder inhaler having at least one reservoir for<br>
holding a pharmaceutical depot for a large number of<br>
pharmaceutical powder doses, including a housing body<br>
and a lid which substantially enclose the at least one<br>
reservoir, and where the housing body and/or the lid<br>
are made predominantly of a PVDC (polyvinylidene<br>
chloride), a pharmaceutically compatible plastic coated<br>
completely or partially with PVDC, an olefin copolymer<br>
with heterocyclic side groups (COC or mPP) , or a PCTFE<br>
(polychlorotrifluoroethylene).<br>
In a particularly advantageous embodiment, a<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge according to the<br>
invention is characterized in that at least one<br>
metering slide as a component of the metering device is<br>
made predominantly of a PVDC (polyvinylidene chloride),<br>
a pharmaceutically compatible plastic coated completely<br>
or partially with PVDC, an olefin copolymer with<br>
heterocyclic side groups, an at least partially<br>
oriented PP (polypropylene) or a PCTFE (polychloro-<br>
trifluoroethylene).<br>
To limit the effects of moisture, which has penetrated<br>
into the cartridge or is present therein, on a<br>
pharmaceutical powder, it is further expedient if a<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge for powder inhalers or<br>
a powder inhaler according to the invention is<br>
characterized in that the housing body and/or lid<br>
comprises, on at least part of the side facing the<br>
reservoir, a blend of desiccant embedded in a<br>
thermoplastic matrix.<br>
To avoid impairment of the pharmaceutical by desiccant<br>
residues, it is advantageous, according to the<br>
invention, to provide a pharmaceutical powder cartridge<br>
for powder inhalers or a powder inhaler having at least<br>
one reservoir for holding a pharmaceutical powder depot<br>
for a large number of pharmaceutical doses, containing<br>
at least one shaped body made of a blend of a<br>
thermoplastic matrix with a desiccant embedded therein,<br>
preferably silica gel, bentonite or molecular sieve,<br>
particularly if channels are formed in a matrix of a<br>
thermoplastic of low water absorption, as are<br>
obtainable by dissolving soluble co-extrudate<br>
components. For rapid uptake cf residual moisture in<br>
the reservoir, it can also be expedient in this case if<br>
fibers which absorb water vapor are embedded as filler<br>
in a matrix of a thermoplastic of low water absorption.<br>
It is particularly advantageous, for economic mass<br>
production, if the blend in a matrix of a thermoplastic<br>
of low water absorption and a desiccant embedded<br>
therein is designed at least as part of an inner wall<br>
of a reservoir by multi-component injection-molding in<br>
a housing body made of a plastic substantially<br>
impermeable to water vapor.<br>
Within the meaning of the invention, it is further<br>
advantageous if housing body and lid are sealed<br>
watertight, preferably by ultrasonic welding.<br>
For particularly economic production, the seal is co-<br>
injected onto the housing body or the metering slide.<br>
The invention can be advantageously exploited in<br>
economic terms using an inhaler for powdered<br>
pharmaceuticals with a pharmaceutical powder cartridge<br>
according to the invention, and with an inhaler for<br>
powdered pharmaceuticals, in which the pharmaceutical<br>
can be taken by a patient by way of an air stream,<br>
characterized by a holder for a pharmaceutical powder<br>
cartridge according to the invention.<br>
The advantages of the invention are particularly<br>
beneficial for patients requiring treatment with a<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge according to the<br>
invention containing a powder. with one or more of the<br>
following active substances: analgesics, anti-<br>
allergies, antibiotics, anticholinergics, anti-<br>
histamines, anti-inflammatory substances, antipyretics,<br>
corticoids, steroids, antitussives, bronchodilators,<br>
diuretics, enzymes, substances acting on the<br>
cardiovascular system, hormones, proteins and peptides.<br>
Application of the invention<br>
By means of the invention, it is possible to make<br>
available pharmacodynamically active substances in the<br>
form of powdered pharmaceuticals over a long period of<br>
use, even when they are sensitive to moisture or are<br>
under unfavorable climatic conditions, and in so doing<br>
also to obtain the advantages of re-usable inhalers<br>
with exchangeable pharmaceutical powder cartridges.<br>
It is also possible to make available powdered<br>
pharmaceuticals for inhalation in different active<br>
substance combinations under improved storage<br>
conditions, in which individual active substances have<br>
increased sensitivity to moisture affecting their<br>
storage life, their stability or their dosability.<br>
Active substances for which the invention can be used<br>
can also be, for example, from the group of beta-<br>
sympathomimetics: salbutamol, reproterol, fenoterol,<br>
formoterol, salmeterol. Possible examples from the<br>
group of corticosteroids are: budesonide,<br>
beclomethasone, fluticasone, triamcinolone,<br>
loteprednol, mometasone, f lunisolide-, ciclosonide.<br>

Description of preferred illustrative embodiments<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a housing body 11 of<br>
a pharmaceutical powder cartridge 1 according to the<br>
invention for exchangeable insertion into a powder<br>
inhaler 2. The pharmaceutical powder cartridge 1 shown<br>
here has, at the upper area of its housing body 11, an<br>
edge 3 which includes two grip areas 4 in order to<br>
permit easy insertion of the pharmaceutical powder<br>
cartridge 1 into a powder inhaler 2. In the<br>
illustrative embodiment shown, a device for indicating<br>
the amount of pharmaceutical doses which remain in the<br>
reservoir 6 or have been removed from the reservoir 6<br>
is provided at the same time in the edge 3, in an<br>
annular channel 5 formed therein (the device is not<br>
shown in detail however), for example in the form of<br>
foil strips with corresponding markings as is described<br>
in detail in WO 97/00703. The user can then read off<br>
the markings through the viewing window 7 in the edge<br>
3.<br>
The edge 3 also serves to receive a lid 8 with which<br>
the reservoir 6 forming the main part of the<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge 1 can be sealed off.<br>
Such a lid 8 is expediently sealed in a watertight<br>
manner to a collar 10 formed within the edge 3, for<br>
example by ultrasonic welding.<br>
Arranged below the reservoir 6 there is a metering<br>
slide channel 12 in which a metering slide acting as<br>
metering device is movably arranged, which metering<br>
slide, in the illustrative embodiment described here,<br>
is made up of three parts, namely a carrier 13, the<br>
actual metering slide body 14, and a seal 15 (Figures<br>
2, 3, 4A and 4B) . The metering slide is configured in<br>
such a way that the seal 15 shown in Figure 2 is<br>
inserted into the carrier 13 shown in Figure 3 and the<br>
carrier 13 is clipped with seal 15 onto the metering<br>
slide body 14.<br>
As can be clearly seen from Figure 1, the metering<br>
slide channel 12 at one end has an opening 16 and,<br>
formed around the opening 16, there is a contact<br>
surface 17 for the seal 15 of the metering slide. The<br>
contact surface 17 is at the same time provided as a<br>
sealing surface and extends in a plane approximately<br>
perpendicular to the direction of movement of the<br>
metering slide from a filling position, as is shown in<br>
Figure 5, to an emptying position, as is shown in<br>
Figure 6.<br>
The metering slide body 14 shown in Figures 4A and 4B<br>
comprises a metering cavity 18 whose holding volume<br>
represents the dose quantity to be made available for<br>
an inhalation. The seal 15 can for example be co-<br>
injected in multi-component injection-molding and for<br>
this purpose can be made, for example, of a<br>
thermoplastic elastomer. Correspondingly, a sealing<br>
surface can be provided on the metering slide, and the<br>
elastic seal 15 can be mounted or better still<br>
injection-molded in the area of the opening 16 of the<br>
metering slide channel 12.<br>
The housing body 11 and/or the lid 8 and/or the<br>
metering slide body 14 can advantageously be made of a<br>
COC by injection-molding. A suitable material with the<br>
name TOPAS® 8007 is commercially available as a trial<br>
product from the company Ticona in Germany.<br>
For pharmaceutical combinations in which the powders<br>
cannot be stored, or cannot adequately be stored, as a<br>
mixture, it can also be expedient to provide two<br>
reservoir chambers instead of the one reservoir 6.<br>
Figures 5 and 6 show a longitudinal section through the<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge 1 inserted into an<br>
inhaler 2. As can be seen from the figures, the<br>
metering slide, designated overall by 9, can move in<br>
the metering slide channel 12 at least from the filling<br>
position shown in Figure 6 to the emptying position<br>
shown in Figure 5.<br>
In the filling position shown in Figure 6,<br>
pharmaceutical powder can fall from the reservoir 6<br>
into the metering cavity 18. When the metering cavity<br>
18 has been filled, as desired, with a pharmaceutical<br>
powder, the metering slide 9 can be moved to the<br>
emptying position shown in Figure 5 with the aid of<br>
engagement means in a powder inhaler which are only<br>
indicated schematically here, for example such as those<br>
described in US 5,840,279 A, and which cooperate with<br>
the carrier 13.<br>
The emptying position is reached when the metering<br>
cavity 18 is situated over an emptying opening 19. When<br>
the metering slide 9 has reached this position, the<br>
pharmaceutical powder can fall from the metering cavity<br>
18 through the emptying opening 19, for example into a<br>
powder channel 20 of an inhaler 2.<br>
The filling position of the metering slide 9 can be<br>
seen clearly in Figure 6, with the metering cavity 18<br>
under a hole 21 on the underside of the reservoir 6. To<br>
reach the empting position, the metering slide 9 is<br>
pushed to the left in Figure 6 until this metering<br>
cavity 18 covers the emptying opening 19 and the<br>
pharmaceutical powder can fall down from it.<br>
It can also be clearly seen in Figure 6 that the seal<br>
15 of the metering slide 9 lies on the contact surface<br>
17 of the metering slide channel 12 and ensures a good<br>
sealing, preferably with slight elastic deformation.<br>
This can be done by prestressing with resiliently<br>
elastic means, in particular via an actuating device in<br>
the inhaler for the metering slide 9, which expediently<br>
also effects an immediate reverse movement of the<br>
metering slide 9 from the emptying position, as shown<br>
in Figure 5, to its sealed filling position, as shown<br>
in Figure 6, as soon as a pharmaceutical dose has been<br>
removed.<br>
For a higher contact pressure of the seal 15 of the<br>
metering slide 9 on the contact surface 17 of the<br>
metering slide channel 12, and thus for a particularly<br>
reliable sealing during storage of a pharmaceutical<br>
powder cartridge according to the invention, especially<br>
prior to its first use in a powder inhaler, it is<br>
advantageous to provide, slightly further to the right<br>
in the view in Figure 6, an additional storing position<br>
for the metering slide 9 of a filled pharmaceutical<br>
powder cartridge 1 in which the metering slide 9 can be<br>
fixed by the releasable snap connection 22 shown. In<br>
this storing position, the seal 15 of the metering<br>
slide 9 on the contact surface 17 of the metering slide<br>
channel 12 is subject to an increased prestressing<br>
force.<br>
In the upper area of the reservoir there is also<br>
advantageously a shaped body 23 which is preferably<br>
secured in its position via corresponding shaped edges<br>
24, in order to avoid mechanical loading of the<br>
pharmaceutical powder. The shaped body 23 is<br>
expediently produced by injection-molding from a blend<br>
of a thermoplastic matrix and a desiccant. The<br>
desiccant is intended in particular to absorb moisture<br>
which is situated in the reservoir 6 or which has<br>
penetrated through the metering cavity 18. The use of<br>
such a shaped body 23 ensures that no crumbs of the<br>
desiccant, typically silica gel, can pass into the<br>
pharmaceutical powder and thus into the airways of a<br>
patient. Such a shaped body can be made of a PP matrix<br>
which itself does not take up water and which is<br>
injected mixed with a water-soluble compound and the<br>
desiccant, for example polyethylene glycol, and the<br>
water-soluble compound is then washed out. This results<br>
in a sponge-like structure with channels which, after<br>
the shaped body has dried, permit rapid water<br>
absorption of the (not water-soluble) silica gel<br>
through large surfaces using capillary condensation.<br>
In order to obtain a rapid water absorption in the<br>
whole shaped body 23, it may also be expedient to embed<br>
suitable fibers as filler in the blend of desiccant and<br>
thermoplastic matrix, said fibers, by virtue of their<br>
capillary action, ensuring rapid transport of the air<br>
moisture and of the water to the desiccant.<br>
The shaped body 23 can also be designed in the form of<br>
a wall lining in the manner of an insert, as is shown<br>
purely by way of example in Figure 5, or, by multi-<br>
component injection-molding in the production of the<br>
pharmaceutical powder cartridge, can form all or part<br>
of an inner wall of the reservoir 6.<br>
