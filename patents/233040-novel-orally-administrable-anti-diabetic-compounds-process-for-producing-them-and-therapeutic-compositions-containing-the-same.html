				<td>The present invention relates to a class of novel orally administrale anti-diabetic compounds, process for producing them and therapeutic compositions containing the same. More particularly, this invention pertains to a new class of compounds effective against type I or IDDM (Juvenile onset) form of diabetes and administrable via oral route in the form of therapeutic composition. The subject invention also discloses a process for preparing the aformentioned novel class of compounds.<br>
The incidence of diabetes has recently been on the rise all the world over, particularly in developing countries including India, thanks to a new trend of food habits and lack of physical exercise among people, particularly youngsters' preference for 'fastfood'. The most common cause of diabetes is chronic pancreatitis, often associated with nutritional and toxic factors. Also, in specific instances, diabetes results from point mutations in the insulin gene.<br>
'Diabetes mellitus' is a group of syndromes characterized by hyperglycemia, glycosuria, negative nitrogen imbalance and at times, Ketonemia. Treating patients afflicted with diabetes (i.e. Diabetes mellitus) is becoming an increasingly importtant medical challenge, not only in terms of growing patient population, but also in terms of effectiveness of the emerging areas of therapy.<br>
Present-day therapeutic classification refers to two major types of diabetes, namely, type I or IDDM (juvenile onset) and type II or NIDDM (maturity onset), the former probably being an autoimmune disorder, whereas in the latter event, there is no loss or moderate reduction in ß-cell mass. But the ß-cells secrete substantial quantities of insulin which, however, is not adequately utilized to control the glucose levels in the body.<br>
Previously administration of extracts of naturally occurring plants, shrubs or fruits (like black berry seeds) was resorted to in controlling blood sugar level in diabetic people. This line of treatment is still being practised extensively in India by Ayurvedic doctors and there is very little or no side effects among patients even after prolonged intake of the medicaments. However, their action is also slow and a judicious selection of dosage plays an important role.<br>

SRD/DS/FILE-1/PATENT<br><br>
With the advent of chemo-therapeutic drugs, use was made of benzene-sulfonyl urea and derivatives thereof in treating diabetes. Drugs like "Rastinon" (Hoechst), "Diabenese" (Pfizer), "Glyphos" (Schering) are being prescribed even today, but patients seem to grow resistant to these drugs leaving no other option but to administer insulin in injectable form through i.v. or i.m. routes. Administration of insulin often becomes a painful procedure, particularly for children of tender age.<br>
Presently treatment of diabetes is aimed at preventing development of metabolic abnormalities experienced by diabetics. Now-a-days attention is being paid on the role of peptides in the treatment of diabetes. Production of pure insulin by using r-DNA technogy is very expensive and the synthetic routes for arriving at insulin are also equally expensive to permit complete synthesis of insulin on a commercial scale.<br>
It is known that amino acid and peptides form an integral part of human body's inventory of drugs which maintain and control various functions vital to human life and health. If their biological activity is properly studied and understood, their functions and properties may be improved upon by synthesizing the analogues of peptides in the laboratory. These synthetic peptides have been found to be an extremely promising and viable proposition for being used-as a new generation of medicine for tackling diabetes.<br>
Synthesis of peptides, both linear chain and cyclic, has been made by adopting and selecting procedures to minimize or even to eliminate substantially the side products or contaminants which might cause undesirable side effects. Cyclic peptides have surprisingly been found to be more potent in combatting diabetes. Cyclic peptides have a number of advantages over linear peptides such as, for instance, they are (i) more conformationally constrained, (ii) resistant to protease digestions, (iii) enhanced metabolic stability and (iv) increased biological activity. These properties render the cyclic peptides more acceptable as a preferred antidiabetic drug compared to insulin, and administrable through both oral and parenteral routes, preferably by the former. Moreover, cyclic peptide molecules<br>
SRD/DS/FILE-1/PATENT	-3-<br><br>
enjoy greater stability due mainly to resonance which impart higher storage stability to the therapeutic formulations prepared thereform.<br>
The principal object of this invention is to provide a novel class of orally and parenterally administrable, mono- and bi-cyclic peptides having pronounced anti-diabetic activity, acid salts and metal ion derivatives thereof.<br>
A further object of this invention is to provide novel cyclic peptides and metal ion derivatives thereof effective against IDDM (juvenile onset) variety of<br>
diabetes.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to provide a process for producing a novel class of orally and parenterally administrable, mono- and bi-cyclic peptides having pronounced anti-diabetic activity.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a therapeutic composition effective against Diabetes mellitus administrable through both oral and parenteral routes, preferably the former.<br>
A few typical members of the mono- and bi-cyclic peptide of this invention administrable by oral and parenteral routes showing pronounced anti-diabetic activity have been shown hereafter in a tabular form. Metal ion and acid salt derivatives of this new class of compounds are also included within the purview of the present invention, some of which are effective as antidiabetic substance.<br>
According to another aspect of this invention there is provided a process for producing a novel orally and parenterally administrable mono- and bi-cyclic peptides having pronounced anti-diabetic activity, which comprises the following steps :<br>
(a) protecting the amino group of an a-amino acid by using phthalic anhydride<br>
or phthaloyl halide as the protecting agent ;<br>
(b) protecting the carboxyl group of the amino acid derivative obtained from<br>
step (a) by passing HC1 gas through a suspension of the compound in<br>
anhydrous ethanol under stirring followed by neutralization with aqueous<br>
alkali solution, if need be, and cooling in an ice bath until crystals appear ;<br>
(c) reacting the compounds from step (b) with chlorophosphate ester reagent<br>
-4-<br>
SRD/DS/FILE-1/PATENT<br><br>
prepared by adding anhydrous ethanol to PC15 to produce an anhydride type reactive moiety ;<br>
(d) treating the said anhydride type moiety with a second carboxyl protected<br>
amino acid in presence of a tertiary amine under dry conditions to produce<br>
a condensation product ;<br>
(e) cleaving the protecting phthaloyl group by reacting the condensation<br>
product from step (d) dissolved in ethanol with hydrazine hydrate under<br>
reflux on steam bath, followed by cooling and addition of cone. HC1;<br>
(f) converting the hydrazide compound from step (e) into the corresponding<br>
azide by reacting with NaNO2 and cone. HC1 at low temperature ; (g) cyclizing the azide derivative by pouring the azide solution into a cold,<br>
dilute solution of NaHCO3 followed by neutralization under dilute<br>
conditions, if needed or called for, (h) isolating the desired cyclized product from the reaction medium by adding<br>
water, boiling and filtering while hot, followed by cooling to produce fine<br>
crystals of the desired product and, if desired, (i) converting the products into their salts or metal ion derivatives by methods<br>
known per se.<br>
The end product thus obtained was characterized by determining the melting point, Rf value from HPLC and spectral data like IR, NMR, etc.<br>
Usually a dipeptide is formed first, followed by formation of a tripeptide using a similar sequence of reaction. The linear tripeptide in its ester form is converted sequentially into a hydrazide and an azide, which in turn is subjected to cyclization by reaction with dilute NaHCO3 solution. It is to be noted that the nature and constitution of the end product will depend on the nature of the a-amino acid selected as the starting material. The principal criterion of the cyclic tripeptide will be not to cleave or disrupt the dithio bond of insulin produced within human system, or in special cases, supplied externally.<br>
The actual course of synthesis of cyclic peptides may be outlined as under giving the sequential performance of the constituent steps :<br>
SRD/DS/FILE-1/PATENT	-5-<br><br>
(a) protection of NH2- group of selected a-amino by phthalic anhydride ;<br>
(b) protection of the - COOH group of the amino acid ;<br>
(c) converting the phthaloyl amino acid into an anhydride type of reactive<br>
moiety ;<br>
(d) treating the moiety with a second carboxyl protected amino acid in presence<br>
of a trialkyl amine [e.g. N(Et)3] under absolute dry conditions ;<br>
(e) treating the condensation product from step (d) with hydrazine hydrate/<br>
HC1 to cleave the phthaloyl group ;<br>
(f) cyclization of tripeptide azide (prepared by diazotization of tripeptide<br>
hydrazide) by adding the azide solution in a solution of NaHCO3 followed<br>
by neutralization under dilute conditions and<br>
(g) isolating and crystallizing the corresponding cyclic peptides from the<br>
filtrate.<br>

From the foregoing disclosure it may be seen that by following the synthetic route enunciated before, one may arrive at small chain mono- and bi-cyclic peptides, their mineral acid salts and metal ion derivatives such as hydrochlorides, or sulphates and sodio, potassium or zinc salts, etc. Peptide synthesis may be achieved by adopting liquid phase method with chlorophosphate ester, triethylamine being used as the condensing agent. Phthaloyl halide may be used for protecting amino group, the carboxyl may be protected by forming methyl or ethyl ester and cyclizatioe may be brought about by forming hydroxides and azides as the successive intermediate stages.<br>
The novel cyclic mono- and di-peptides may be formulated into orally or parentally administrable forms by using fillers selected from lactose, starch, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, steatite, microfined silica and polymeric cellulose "AVICEL", binders are selected from starch paste and carboxy methyl cellulose (CMC) and non-aqueous adjuvant is ethyl cellulose.<br>
The main emphasis of the present invention is to identify a specific zone or portion of the insulin molecule, which are important areas for binding to the receptor. As pointed out earlier in this specification, the cyclic peptides are more conformationally constrained, more stable and readily pass through the cell membrane, thereby showing better biological activity.<br>
The invention will be further amplified by the Examples given hereafter narrating the synthesis of a typical cyclic peptide of this invention and pharmacological studies conducted on rabbits with induced diabetes, which has shown quite encouraging results. The examples are given by way of illustration and the invention is not confined to the specific embodiments given therein.<br>

Example 2 B. PHARMACOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION<br>
Earlier studies of the pharmacological activities of various amino acid and peptides synthesized along with their metal ion-derivatives, have been reported to be quite promising results. They have shown significant anti-inflammatory, heptoprotective, anti-fungal and anti-diabetic activity. Here we have mainly concentrated on Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM) and its treatment with small chain cyclic peptides,<br>
Here, in this project we have investigated the antidiabetic activity of the synthesized peptides on alloxanised rabbits. PRINCIPLE<br>
The protein free blood filtrate is heated with alkaline copper sulphate solution. The cuprous oxide thus formed is treated with phosphomolybdic acid solution a blue colour being obtained is compared with that of a standard. Alloxan Induced Diabetes in Rabbits<br>
In 1943, Dunn, Sheehan and McLetchie at the University of Glasgow reported that alloxan can produce specific pancreatic islet necrosis in rabbits. Alloxan proved to be a suitable compound for inducing experimental diabetes in animals.This alloxan diabetes in animals presented like diabetes mellitus in man, with the typical symptoms such as body weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, glycosuria, ketouria, hyperglycaemia and ketonemia.<br>
-19-<br><br>
The difficulties encountered with in vivo experiments with alloxan are the instability of alloxan under physiological conditions100 and its thiol reactivity; in addition, other factors such as diet, age and animal species affect the dose of alloxan necessary to induce a diabetic state in animals. This has made it virtually impossible to establish a clear relationship between the dose of alloxan and its effective concentration in the pancreas, which induces the effects on the function and the morphology of the pancreatic B-cells.<br>
Mechanism of induction of Diabetes by Alloxan<br>
1. The favored site for the action of alloxan was not a sulfhydryl enzyme in the pancreatic B cell, but rather a presumptive gluco-receptor in the pancreatic B cell membrane.105 But experimental support for the existence of such a plasma membrane receptor remained circumstantial within the last few years, the concept that glucokinase, a glucose phosphorylating enzyme with low affinity is of central importance for the normal function of the pancreatic B cell. Glucokinase is the enzyme in the pancreatic B cell and also in the liver, which is apparently most sensitive to inhibition by alloxan and may be the primary target for alloxan in the pancreatic B cell toxic action of the agent.106 Inhibition of the pancreatic B cell glucokinase due to an oxidation of SH groups in the sugar binding site of the enzyme. <br>
-20-<br><br>
2. The selective toxicity of alloxan to the pancreatic B-cell results from the coincidence of two distinct and independent features :<br>
a.	rapid accumulation of the drug into islet cells,<br>
b.	and, their exquisite sensitivity towards peroxides..<br>
Antidiabetic Studies<br>
The antidiabetic activity of the prepared test drugs was studied on alloxanised rabbits by measuring the decrease in blood glucose level.107<br>
3.	MATERIALS AND METHODS<br>

vehicle control.<br>
II. Reagents used and its preparation<br>
a.	Isotonic sodium sulphate - copper sulphate solution - 30 g of<br>
sodium sulphate, Na2SO4.10 H2O and 6g of copper sulphate CuSO4.<br>
5H2O was dissolved in one litre of distilled water.<br>
b.	Sodium Tungstate solution - 100 g of sodium tungstate was<br>
dissolved in one litre of distilled water.<br>

dissolved in 600 ml of distilled water in a one litre volumetric flask<br>
at room temperature and 20 g of anhydrous sodium carbonate was<br>
added to this solution and shaken vigorously. 18g of potassium<br>
oxalate was dissolved separately in 150 ml of distilled water and<br>
was added gradually to the above solution. Then 12 g of sodium<br>
potassium, tartarate was dissolved separately, in 100 ml of distilled<br>
water and added to the above solution. The final volume was made<br>
up to one litre with distilled water.<br>
d.	Phosphomolybdic acid reagent - 35 g of molybdic acid and 5 g of<br>
sodium tungstate was dissolved in 200 ml of 10% sodium hydroxide<br>
solution, now 200 ml of distilled water was added to this solution.<br>
It was then diluted to about 350 ml with distilled water and<br>
transferred with washing to a 500 ml volumetric flask, diluting 125<br>
-22-<br><br>
ml of phosphoric acid (specific gravity 1.95 g/ml) was added and<br>
mixed. The final volume was made to 500 ml with distilled water. e. Stock standard glucose solution - 100 mg of glucose AR was<br>
dissolved in 100 ml of Isotonic sodium sulphate - Copper, sulphate<br>

The blood sample was withdrawn with the help of tuberculin syringe from the marginal car vein of the rabbit. 1 ml of blood was withdrawn each time and was transferred immediately to the vial containing few drops of EDTA aqueous solution. It was plugged immediately using rubber closures to be used for the estimation of blood glucose level.<br>
-24-<br><br>
b. Analysis of Blood, samples<br>
0,1 ml of blood was pipetted in 3,8 ml of Isotonic sodium sulphate -Copper sulphate solution and the solution was mixed thoroughly. Now 0.1 ml of sodium tungstate solution was added and, mixed, the solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min. 1 ml of supernatant fluid was taken in a hard glass test tube and to this 1ml of alkaline tartrate was added.<br>

The objective of the present work was to test the antidiabetic activity of the synthesized small chain cyclic peptides using alloxanised rabbits.<br>
-25-<br><br>
The antidiabetic activity of the hydrochloride salt and metal ion complex of a cyclic peptide was also tested.<br>
The test drug has been given by subcutaneous as well as by oral route.The results were very encouraging in both the cases.In the subcutaneous route, the T.D.- I, II, IV and VI showed significant antidiabetic activity compared to standard drug insulin at a dose of 0.2 unit / kg body weight. In Fig. 1.. the curve for the standard drug has shown a sudden fall in the mean blood glucose level, which may lead to hypoglycemic state, whereas the test drugs has shown a gradual decrease in the mean blood glucose level, when compare to standard.<br>
Percentage reduction in blood glucose level in case of standard drug Insulin was found to be 65.86%, whereas T.D-IV showed a percentage reduction in blood glucose level of 60.82% and T.D - I, II, VI showed a percentage reduction in blood glucose level of 60.34%, 60.16% and 58.33% respectively.<br>
In the oral route; the T.D.- I, II and VII showed significant antidiabetic activity compared to standard drug insulin at a dose of 0.2 unit / kg body weight. In Fig. 3 the curve for the standard drug has shown a sudden fall in the mean blood glucose level, which may lead to hypoglycemic state, whereas the test drugs has shown a gradual decrease in the mean blood glucose level, when compare to standard.<br>
Percentage reduction in blood glucose level in case of standard drug Insulin was found to be 60.58%, whereas T.D-VII showed a percentage<br>
-26-<br><br>
reduction in blood glucose level of 52.45% and T.D - I and II showed a percentage reduction in blood glucose level of 55.52%,50.40% respectively. . Data Treatment<br>
The anti-diabetic activity of the test drugs was studied 'using alloxanised rabbits with percentage reduction in blood glucose level as the index.<br>
The results have been shown in table no§ 1 and 2.<br>
The graphical representation which shows<br>
the mean blood glucose level after administration of standard and test drugs in mg/100 ml have been shown in Fig. 1 (s.c) and in Fig.6.2.2(oral) and the mean% reduction in blood glucose level after administration of standard and drugs in Fig: 3 (s.c) and in Fig. 4 Statistical Treatment<br>

The present invention offers a number of advantages i) Stability of the synthetic cyclic peptide is considerably more than insulin since insulin is a long-chain complex polypeptide having a plurality of<br>
dithio bridges.<br>
ii) Insulin is a costly drug, storing of which poses problems. On the other hand synthetic cyclic peptide is far less costly.<br>
-30-<br><br>
iii) The novel class of cyclic peptides can be made from wholly indigenous<br>
starting materials and equipments. Synthesis does not require any sophisticated<br>
equipment(s) or imported chemicals and consequently the products will be<br>
considerably cost-effective.<br>
iv) The drugs are administrate orally, thereby avoiding hazards of injection<br>
and attended possibilities of secondary infection.<br>
v) The cyclic peptides also show promise as a potential agent to combat<br>
intestinal inflammation.<br>
vi) The novel class of compounds of this invention shows synergistic action<br>
with human insulin, triggering the enzymes responsible for bringing about<br>
burning/consumption of glucose in the blood stream.<br>

We claim :<br>
1. A novel class of orally and parenterally administrate, mono- and bi-cyclic<br>
peptides having pronounced anti-diabetic activity, acid salts and metal ion<br>
derivatives thereof.<br>
2. A process for producing a novel orally administrable, mono- and bi-cyclic<br>
peptides having pronounced anti-diabetic activity, acid salts like hydrochlorides<br>
and sulphates, and metal ion derivatives like sodio, potassium and zinc salts<br>
thereof, which comprises the following steps :<br><br>
a) protecting the amino group of an a-amino acid by using phthalic anhydride<br>
or phthaloyl halide as the protecting agent ;<br>
b) protecting the carboxyl group of the amino acid derivative obtained from<br>
step (a) by passing HC1 gas through a suspension of the compound in anhydrous<br>
ethanol under stirring followed by neutralization with aqueous alkali solution, if<br>
need be, and cooling in an ice bath until crystals appear ;<br>
c) reacting the compounds from step (b) with chlorophosphate ester reagent<br>
prepared by adding anhydrous ethanol to PC15 to produce an anhydride type<br>
reactive moiety ;<br>
d) treating the said anhydride type moiety with a second carboxyl protected<br>
amino acid in presence of a tertiary amine under dry conditions to produce a<br>
condensation product ;<br>
e) cleaving the protecting phthaloyl group by reacting the condensation<br>
product from step (d) dissolved in ethanol with hydrazine hydrate under reflux<br>
on steam bath, followed by cooling and addition of cone. HC1 ;<br>
f) converting the hydrazide compound from step (e) into the corresponding<br>
azide by reacting with NaNO2 and cone. HC1 at low temperature ;<br>
-34-<br><br>
g) cyclizing the azide derivative by pouring the azide solution into a cold,<br>
dilute solution of NaHCO3 followed by neutralization under dilute conditions, if<br>
needed or called for,<br>
h) isolating the desired cyclized product from the reaction medium by adding<br>
water, boiling and filtering while hot, followed by cooling to produce fine crystals<br>
of the desired product and, if desired,<br>
i) converting the products into their salts or metal ion derivatives by methods<br>
known per se.<br>
3. A process as claimed in Claim 2, wherein the tertiary amine used in<br>
step (d) is triethylamine.<br>
4. A process as claimed in Claim 2, wherein deprotection of amino group<br>
with removal of phthaloyl group is carried out in step (e) by reacting the<br>
condensation product dissolved in ethanol with hydrazine hydrate under reflux<br>
on steam bath, cooling the mixture, acidifying the same with cone. HC1, reheating<br>
on water both at arround 50°C for 1 hour, allowing it to stand overnight, filtered<br>
to remove phthaloyl hydrazide, filtrate neutralized with pyridine, solvent and<br>
pyridine removed by vaccum distillation, followed by crystallization from<br>
dichloroethane giving rise to tripeptide ester.<br>
5. A process as claimed in Claims 2 and 4, wherein the hydrazide derivative<br>
is converted into azide by treating a dilute HC1 solution of hydrazide with aqueous<br>
solution of NaNO2 at 0°C, followed by cyclization by pouring the azide solution<br>
into aqueous NaHCO3 solution and allowing to stand for 48 hrs, concentrating<br>
and adding acetone to the solution to obtain a crude crop of the desired product.<br>
6. A process as claimed in Claims 2 and 5, wherein the crude crop is dissolved<br>
in water, filtered hot to remove polymeric impurities and then cooled to get the<br>
cyclic tripeptides.<br>
-35-<br><br>
7. A process for producing a novel class of orally and parenterally<br>
administrable mono- and bi-cyclic peptides having pronounced anti-diabetic<br>
activity, acid salts like hydrochlorides and sulphates, and metal ion derivatives<br>
like sodio, potassium and zinc salts thereof, substantially as hereinbefore<br>
described with particular reference to the appended Examples.<br>
8. A therapeutic composition in orally administrable form comprising<br>
50 mg/Kg body weight in combination with fillers, diluents/adjuvants and<br>
binders such as herein described.<br>
9. A composition as claimed in Claim 8, wherein fillers are selected from<br>
lactose, starch, calcium phosphate, magnesium stearate, talc, steatite, microfined<br>
silica and polymeric cellulose "AVICEL", binders are selected from strach paste<br>
and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and non-aqueous adjuvant is ethyl cellulose.<br>
10. A composition as claimed in Claim 8, wherein 0.5% by wt. of CMC is<br>
added to the composition for stabilizing the same.<br>
