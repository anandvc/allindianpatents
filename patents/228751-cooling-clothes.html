				<td>COOLING SUIT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a cooling<br>
suit configured to cool a wearer's body by causing outside<br>
air to flow along the wearer's body parallelly thereto.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] It is possible to regard a human as an<br>
r<br>
extremely inefficient working device which ingests food to<br>
conduct life support activities, pieces of work, and the<br>
like, and to generate heat commensurately therewith. Due<br>
to the inefficiency, most of caloric intake is turned into<br>
heat, thereby requiring radiation of a large amount of heat<br>
commensurating with a then quantity of work in order to<br>
keep a normal body temperature. To this end, humans each<br>
possesses a physiological ability for cooling his/her body<br>
by virtue of perspiration. Namely, there is determined a<br>
physiologically required quantity of heat radiation<br>
commensurately with a quantity of work, and perspiration is<br>
exuded commensurately therewith, in a manner to attain heat<br>
radiation which is most suitable for the then situation of<br>
him/her when the perspiration is fully evaporated.<br>
Naturally, the amount of perspiration commensurating with<br>
the quantity of heat radiation will not be unequivocally<br>
calculated by his/her brain. Nonetheless, drastically<br><br>
raised body temperatures lead to large amounts of<br>
perspiration to be continuously exuded, and resultingly<br>
lowered body temperatures lead to reduced amounts of<br>
perspiration, so that the body is not excessively cooled.<br>
As such, there is resultingly exuded an amount of<br>
perspiration commensurately with a required quantity of<br>
heat radiation.<br>
[0003] However, it becomes impossible to obtain a<br>
required quantity of heat radiation when vaporization of<br>
perspiration is disabled depending on conditions of<br>
temperature, humidity, presence/absence of airstreams,<br>
quantity of work, and the like, such that perspiration is<br>
continuously and uselessly exuded in a liquid state without<br>
vaporization, thereby causing not only uncomfortableness<br>
but also physiological damages. As such, there is required<br>
aid of a cooling suit. Among cooling suits, the cooling<br>
suit (hereinafter also called "air-flow type cooling suit")<br>
of a type configured to cool a wearer's body by causing<br>
outside air to flow along the wearer's body parallelly<br>
thereto, cools the wearer's body by utilizing outside air<br>
without using a cooling device such as a compressor,<br>
thereby enabling achievement of mild cooling of the<br>
wearer's body at a reduced power consumption.<br>
[0004] Patent-related reference 1: International<br>
Publication WO 02/067708 pamphlet<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] Incidentally, conventional air-flow type<br>
cooling suits are each capable of evaporating sweat exuded<br>
during conduction of a normal work of a wearer, thereby<br>
enabling the wearer of the cooling suit to be appropriately<br>
cooled. However, it has been impossible to sufficiently<br>
evaporate the exuded sweat, when the wearer exuded a large<br>
amount of sweat due to a work in a high temperature<br>
environment, a hard work, or the like. As a result, it has<br>
been impossible to use the conventional air-flow type<br>
cooling suits under such severe usage environments.<br>
Further, the conventional air-flow type cooling suits are<br>
each provided with spacers between the cooling suit and an<br>
undergarment so as to ensure an airflow passage. This has<br>
caused the conventional air-flow type cooling suits to be<br>
complicated in configuration.<br>
[0006] Further, cooling suits to be used in a<br>
situation where a large amount of sweat is exuded, are to<br>
be desirably easily washable, since such cooling suits are<br>
stained with sweat.<br>
[0007] The present invention has been made under the<br>
above-described circumstances, and it is therefore an<br>
object of the present invention to provide a cooling suit<br>
having a simple structure and capable of assuredly<br>
evaporating a large amount of sweat.<br>
[0008] In addition to the above object, it is another<br>
object of the present invention to provide a cooling suit<br><br>
which is easily washable.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
[0009] To achieve the object, the invention recited<br>
in Claim 1 resides in a cooling suit to be worn on a wearer,<br>
comprising: at least one air inlet configured to introduce<br>
outside air; at least one parallel airstream generation<br>
means having: vanes; a motor for rotating said vanes; a<br>
front face formed with an air suction port; and a side<br>
surface formed with a parallel airstream deliver portion;<br>
the or each parallel airstream generation means being<br>
provided for introducing outside air from said air suction<br>
port and for blowing the air substantially in a sideward<br>
direction from said parallel airstream deliver portion to<br>
generate parallel airstreams which are substantially<br>
parallel to the wearer's body; a guide sheet simultaneously<br>
serving as a garment and for guiding the parallel<br>
airstreams generated by the or each parallel airstream<br>
generation means, parallelly to the wearer's body; at least<br>
one air exit portion configured to discharge the parallel<br>
airstreams to the exterior; and electric-power source means<br>
detachably provided on said guide sheet and for supplying<br>
electric power to the or each parallel airstream generation<br>
means; wherein the or each air inlet is formed in said<br>
guide sheet; wherein the or each parallel airstream<br>
generation means is detachably provided inside said guide<br>
sheet so that said air suction port of the or each parallel<br><br>
intensifying conditions where perspiration can be<br>
evaporated.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0010] The cooling suit according to the present<br>
invention is capable of causing a large amount of air to<br>
flow between an undergarment or wearer's body and a guide<br>
sheet so as to largely extend an effective area under the<br>
influence of a physiological cooling ability of the wearer<br>
to thereby cool the wearer's body.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] There will be firstly explained a cooling<br>
principle of the present invention. In a state where a<br>
large amount of perspiration is exuded by a human,<br>
concretely, where an undergarment is stained with<br>
perspiration, the humidity near the undergarment or a skin<br>
becomes approximately 100% so that perspiration to be<br>
subsequently exuded is disabled from vaporizing.<br>
Nonetheless, it is possible to cause perspiration to<br>
vaporize even when outside air is 90% in humidity, by<br>
flowing a large amount of air. Generally, temperatures are<br>
not so high when humidities are extremely high, and.<br>
conversely, humidities are low when temperatures are<br>
extremely high. The temperature to be obtained by<br>
evaporation of perspiration is determined by a wet-bulb<br><br>
temperature of a wet and dry bulb thermometer. For example,<br>
it is possible to lower a body temperature down to 28°C<br>
even at an atmospheric temperature of 50°C by evaporating<br>
perspiration insofar as the humidity is 20%, such that<br>
perspiration can be perfectly vaporized in most<br>
environments insofar as a sufficient amount of airstream is<br>
flowed.<br>
[0014] From a standpoint of cooling a body by<br>
evaporation, it is possible to classify perspiration into<br>
the following three types.<br>
(1)	Immediate effect perspiration: which vaporizes<br>
simultaneously with exudation from a body to thereby<br>
immediately cool the body.<br>
(2)	Delayed effect perspiration: which is exuded from<br>
a body in a liquid state to thereby wet an undergarment,<br>
such that the perspiration fails to immediately exhibit a<br>
cooling effect even when the body requires such an effect,<br>
but the perspiration belatedly vaporizes to resultingly<br>
cool the body when airstreams are caused, for example.<br>
(3) Ineffective perspiration: which drops from a body,<br>
and thus has no effects for cooling the body by evaporation.<br>
When ineffective perspiration is exuded, this is a<br>
state where a physiological cooling ability is not duly<br>
exhibited such that the body temperature is continuously<br>
raised, and this state can be never continued.<br>
[0015] When delayed effect perspiration is exuded<br>
though ineffective perspiration is not exuded, the body<br><br>
temperature is repeatedly raised and returned to a normal<br>
temperature. Although there is felt mugginess and thus<br>
uncomfortableness in this state, it is not impossible to<br>
continue this state. It is due to such delayed effect<br>
perspiration, that cooling effects are felt when exposed to<br>
airstreams in a state where an undergarment is wet.<br>
Meanwhile, when only immediate effect perspiration is<br>
exuded, the perspiration is immediately vaporized without<br>
delayed cooling in a manner that the body temperature is<br>
unchanged, which is an extremely comfortable state without<br>
feeling hotness.<br>
[0016] Hotness, coolness and the like are not<br>
absolute feelings, and are determined depending on a then<br>
movement state of a human, an atmospheric temperature, a<br>
humidity, presence/absence of airstreams, and the like, so<br>
that the human never feels hotness even when the<br>
atmospheric temperature is high insofar as all perspiration<br>
is immediate effect perspiration. As such, it is possible<br>
to convert all perspiration controlled by a brain into<br>
immediate effect perspiration by causing a lot of<br>
airstreams to flow parallelly to a wearer's body by means<br>
of a cooling suit so as to cause exuded perspiration to<br>
immediately vaporize, thereby cooling the wearer's body to<br>
an appropriate level. Namely, wearing the cooling suit and<br>
causing a large amount of air to flow parallelly to a<br>
wearer's body, enables drastic extension of a range of<br>
conditions where perspiration exuded from a wearer's body<br><br>
can be evaporated.<br>
[0017] There was conducted a practical test for an<br>
office work such that a cooling suit capable of flowing a<br>
lot of airstreams (30m3/H) was worn by each wearer sitting<br>
on a cooling seat cushion of the same principle and also<br>
putting a cooling cap on his/her head. As a result,<br>
although the room temperature was raised to about 40°C as<br>
the highest, the wearer who was not so fatty did not feel<br>
at all a difference between room temperatures of 25°C and <br>
40°C. Only, limitation temperatures where hotness was felt,<br>
varied wearer by wearer. While it is practically<br>
experienced that perspiration in a liquid state is exuded<br>
when hotness is felt, it has been rather confirmed by the<br>
test that sultriness is not felt when only immediate effect<br>
perspiration is exuded without exudation of perspiration in<br>
a liquid state. Note that airstreams parallel to a<br>
wearer's body never impinge on a wearer's body no matter<br>
how strongly the airstreams are flowed, thereby preventing<br>
a user from uncomfortable feeling which is otherwise caused<br>
when exposed to lukewarm airstreams from an electric fan.<br>
[0018] The state, where a human feels most<br>
comfortable, is a situation where perspiration is being<br>
exuded for heat radiation and the perspiration immediately<br>
vaporizes, i.e., a situation where a physiological cooling<br>
ability (cooler) is enabled. As conditions for realizing<br>
this situation, it is required to constantly cause outside<br>
air to flow parallelly to a wearer's body to thereby<br><br>
exhaust moisture to the outside, in a state where the<br>
outside air temperature is so high that perspiration is<br>
exuded.<br>
[0019] As described above, the present invention is<br>
configured to cause a lot of airstreams to flow parallelly<br>
to a wearer's body to thereby largely extend an effective<br>
area under the influence of a physiological cooling ability<br>
even in a severe environment where ineffective perspiration<br>
is exuded.<br>
[0020]<br>
[First Embodiment]<br>
There will be explained a best mode for carrying out<br>
the present invention according to the present application.<br>
There is provided a cooling suit according to a first<br>
embodiment of the present invention applied to a short-<br>
sleeved jacket of a worksuit. FIG. 1A is a schematic front<br>
view of the cooling suit according to the first embodiment<br>
of the present invention when it is worn, and FIG. 1B is a<br>
schematic rear view of the cooling suit. As shown in FIG.<br>
1, the cooling suit 1 of the first embodiment comprises: a<br>
garment or jacket 2 formed into a shape of a short-sleeved<br>
jacket and simultaneously serving as a guide sheet (the<br>
meaning of "guide" will be described later) which is less<br>
in air leakage; parallel airstream generation devices 3<br>
provided at the lower right and left of a back side of the<br>
garment, respectively, to introduce outside air to thereby<br>
generate airflows between the garment 2 and an undergarment<br><br>
or wearer's body and parallelly to the wearer's body; air<br>
exit portions 4 serving as exits of air, respectively; air<br>
inlets 2a formed in the garment 2 and serving as inlets of<br>
air, respectively; air leakage prevention means 5 for<br>
preventing air leakage from a hemline of the garment 2; and<br>
fastener 6 for opening and closing a front portion of the<br>
garment 2.<br>
[0021] In this embodiment, the parallel airstream<br>
generation devices 3 are provided by two in number, and<br>
arranged to suck outside air into the interior of the<br>
garment when the parallel airstream generation devices are<br>
supplied with electric power through cords (not shown),<br>
respectively, from an electric-power source or battery (not<br>
shown) detachably provided on the garment 2. Further, the<br>
total of air blowing amount of the two parallel airstream<br>
generation devices 3 is set at about 10m3/H. Hereinafter,<br>
the parallel airstream generation devices 3 are each simply<br>
and occasionally referred to as a fan 3. In turn, the air<br>
exit portions 4 of the cooling suit of this embodiment<br>
include a gap between a collar portion of the garment and<br>
the wearer's body, and gaps between sleeve edges and the<br>
arms of the wearer, respectively. The air leakage<br>
prevention means 5 is configured to prevent air leakage<br>
from a hemline portion of the garment, by passing a string<br>
through the hemline portion and by strongly knotting<br>
opposite ends of the string together, for example.<br>
[0022] The first embodiment is constituted in the<br><br>
above manner. Thus, driving the parallel airstream<br>
generation devices 3 introduces air of about 10m3/H into<br>
the interior of the cooling suit 1 through the air inlets<br>
2a to cause positive pressures near the parallel airstream<br>
generation devices 3 inside the cooling suit 1 to thereby<br>
bulge the garment 2 in a manner to produce a space between<br>
the garment simultaneously serving as the guide sheet and<br>
the undergarment, so that airstreams tending to embrace the<br>
wearer's body are established and the airstreams are caused<br>
to exit to the exterior through the air exit portions 4<br>
which are end portions of the cooling suit, respectively.<br>
Here, the reason why the garment 2 has been called the<br>
guide sheet, is that the garment 2 simultaneously plays a<br>
role of a guide for forming airflows which tend to embrace<br>
the wearer's body. It is thus desirable that the garment<br>
is made from a material less in air leakage such as a tight<br>
cloth, and is devised in shape such that a lot of airflows<br>
are established.<br>
[0023] As described above, establishing a lot of<br>
airflows parallelly to the wearer's body, enables a larger<br>
extension of an effective area under the influence of a<br>
physiological cooling ability of the wearer's body to<br>
thereby essentially solve the problem due to hotness, by<br>
virtue of the cooling suit of this embodiment.<br>
[0024] There will be detailedly explained points in<br>
case of applying the cooling suit of the present invention<br>
to a worksuit.<br><br>
Items generally required in case of application to a<br>
worksuit are:<br>
(1)	that the cooling suit is inexpensive;<br>
(2)	that the cooling suit has a larger cooling<br>
capacity;<br>
(3)	that the cooling suit does not deteriorate the<br>
orkability of the worksuit; and<br>
(4)	that electrical components of the cooling suit<br>
Ire to be readily detached from the worksuit since the<br>
worksuit is to be washed so frequently.<br>
Contrary, there is not so emphasized an aspect of<br>
fashion of the cooling suit, in case of application to a<br>
worksuit.<br>
[0025] Firstly, concerning the item (1) of<br>
inexpensiveness, conventional cooling suits have each<br>
required spacers for previously producing airflow passages<br>
for establishing airflows parallel to a wearer's body, such<br>
that the spacers have a higher proportion of a total cost<br>
of the associated cooling suit. Contrary, in the cooling<br>
suit of this embodiment of the present invention, a large<br>
amount of air is caused to flow into the interior of the<br>
cooling suit to thereby form a space between a wearer's<br>
body and the cooling suit by virtue of a pressure of air,<br>
so as to flow air through the space, thereby realizing the<br>
airflow passages without using spacers.<br>
[0026] The item (2) of the larger cooling capacity<br>
can be realized by using a large-sized fan and by further<br><br>
adopting a high efficient motor for the fan. As such a<br>
motor, there is optimally adopted a brush motor, also<br>
taking account of cost. The items (3) and (4) will be<br>
described later.<br>
[002 7] The parallel airstream generation device of<br>
this embodiment will be described next. FIG. 2 is a<br>
schematic side view of the vicinity of the parallel<br>
airstream generation device attached to the garment 2. FIG.<br>
3A is a schematic front view of the fan casing of the<br>
parallel airstream generation device, and FIG. 3B is a<br>
partially sectioned schematic side view thereof. FIG. 4A<br>
is a schematic front view of a sideward-flow fan of the<br>
parallel airstream generation device, and FIG. 4B is a<br>
schematic cross-sectional view thereof viewed in a<br>
direction of arrow A-A'<br>
The parallel airstream generation devices 3 of this<br>
embodiment each comprises a sideward-flow fan 3a, an over-<br>
cooling prevention cloth 12, and a fan casing 31-<br>
[0028] As shown in FIG. 3, each fan casing 31<br>
comprises: a front face fan guard 7a formed at an air inlet<br>
of the fan,' an internal side face fan guard 7b formed at an<br>
associated parallel airstream deliver portion; a flange<br>
portion 8; a bottom 9; and a magic tape 8a attached to the<br>
flange portion 8. Although the front face fan guard 7a and<br>
the internal side face fan guard 7b are each formed of a<br>
circular column-like member in this embodiment, they may be<br>
each formed in a square column-like shape. Particularly,<br><br>
since the fan having a larger air blowing capacity such as<br>
in this embodiment has a vane wheel 10 having a larger<br>
rotation energy such that fingers or the like are prevented<br>
from contact with the vane wheel 10, it is necessary to<br>
cover the fan by the fan guards. Further, there is<br>
frequently required a washing operation depending on a type<br>
of work, so that the flange portion is provided with a hook<br>
and loop fastener (Magic Tape ™) for allowing the fan to be<br>
readily attached and detached upon washing. So, there is<br>
provided a magic tape 8b in a donut shape at a reverse<br>
side around the associated air inlet 2a of the garment 2.<br>
Each fan 3 can be detachably attached to the garment 2 by<br>
the associated magic tape 8a provided at the air inlet of<br>
the fan 3 and the associated magic tape 8b provided at the<br>
air inlet of the garment 2. Note that the attachment<br>
detachment means for the fans 3 are not limited to the<br>
magic tapes, and various ways are conceivable.<br>
[0029] As shown in FIG.4, each sideward-flow fan 3a<br>
of this embodiment comprises the vane wheel 10 and a motor<br>
11. The vane wheel 10 comprises: a rotor 10b ; and a number<br>
of vanes 10a each formed at a periphery portion of the<br>
rotor 10b in a manner to be substantially perpendicular to<br>
a rotation plane of the rotor 10b. Thus, rotating the vane<br>
wheel 10 by the motor 11 introduces air from the front face<br>
of the vane wheel as shown by an arrow, and discharges the<br>
air in a sideward direction. In this embodiment, such a<br>
fan for delivering airstreams in this manner is called as<br><br>
a sideward-flow fan.<br>
[0030] Each over-cooling prevention cloth 12 is made<br>
of a cloth which is high in thermal insulation, and<br>
attached to the bottom 9 of the associated fan casing 31.<br>
The over-cooling prevention cloth 12 has a contour larger<br>
than that of the fan casing 31 by about 5cm to 15cm, for<br>
example. As shown by inclined arrows in FIG. 2, directions<br>
of airstreams blown by the fan 3 are not made completely<br>
parallel to the wearer's body due to reasons of inertia of<br>
sucked air and the like, and are blown onto the wearer's<br>
body around the fan. Particularly, although the cooling<br>
suit of this embodiment is required to be worn in a<br>
situation where the outside air temperature is not so high<br>
but mugginess is to be solved, it is likely that the<br>
wearer's body is partially and excessively cooled around<br>
the fan 3 where the outside air is directly blown onto the<br>
wearer's body if a temperature difference between the air<br>
and the body temperature is large. To prevent it, provided<br>
in this embodiment is the over-cooling prevention cloth 12<br>
made of a cloth which is high in thermal insulation, for<br>
example.<br>
[0031] Further, the cooling suit 1 of this embodiment<br>
is provided with suspending means 14. FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B<br>
are schematic cross-sectional views showing relationships<br>
among the garment 2, the fan 3, and the undergarment 13,<br>
respectively. The suspending means 14 of this embodiment<br>
has one end attached to a shoulder portion of the garment 2,<br><br>
and the other end attached to the associated fan. Since<br>
the fan 3 having a larger air blowing capacity is heavy,<br>
the fan 3 is inclined as shown in FIG. 5A when it is<br>
attached to the garment by the magic tapes only, thereby<br>
not only deteriorating the external appearance but also<br>
deteriorating the function itself of the cooling suit.<br>
Thus, each fan 3 in this embodiment is suspended from the<br>
above such as an upper portion of the garment 2 by the<br>
suspending means 14 such as a string, as shown in FIG. 5B.<br>
Note that this string may be in a round rod shape or a<br>
strip shape.<br>
[0032] According to this embodiment, a lot of<br>
airstreams of about 10m3/H blown into between and<br>
parallelly to the undergarment 13 and the garment 2 by the<br>
parallel airstream generation devices 3, cause positive<br>
pressures in the space between the garment 2 and the<br>
undergarment to thereby bulge the garment to automatically<br>
produce airflow passages between the garment and the<br>
undergarment, and the airstreams are exhausted to the<br>
exterior through the air exit portions 4 formed at the ends<br>
of the garment. In this way, since the cooling suit of<br>
this embodiment is capable of producing airflow passages<br>
without using spacers for ensuring the airflow passages,<br>
the structure of the cooling suit is simplified and can be<br>
fabricated inexpensively<br>
[0033] Further, it is certainly possible to cause air<br>
to flow even by an airstream amount of about 5m3/H without<br><br>
using spacers by devising a configuration of the garment,<br>
an air resistance at each air exit portion, a weight of the<br>
garment, and the like. However, in such a case, it is<br>
rather desirable to more assuredly ensure airflow passages<br>
by using small spacers at important locations, respectively,<br>
from a standpoint of cost and cooling capability. Usable<br>
as spacers in this case are sponge-made ones or the like,<br>
for example. Further, the upper limit of a total air<br>
blowing amount by the parallel airstream generation devices<br>
is about 500m3/H. Upper limits exceeding it lead to more<br>
large-sized parallel airstream generation devices to<br>
thereby deteriorate the workability, which is impractical.<br>
Note that the reason why the garment has been called the<br>
"guide sheet", is that the garment itself simultaneously<br>
plays a role for guiding parallel airstreams generated by<br>
the parallel airstream generation devices up to the air<br>
exit portions 4 acting as air exits, while keeping the<br>
airstreams parallel to the wearer's body. As the<br>
conditions therefor, it is enough to only adopt a material<br>
less in air leakage for a garment in a manner to readily<br>
produce a space between an undergarment and the garment by<br>
a small pressure. Further, it is not absolutely necessary<br>
to cause air to flow along the entirety of the wearer's<br>
body covered by the garment, and it is enough to devise the<br>
shape of the garment or the like such that air is<br>
concentratedly flowed along portions where perspiration<br>
apts to be exuded. Particularly, it is generally said that<br><br>
a belly is not to be cooled so much. The air leakage<br>
prevention means 5 constituted at the hemline is required<br>
to prevent air leakage from the hemline and to exhaust all<br>
the airstreams blown from the lower portion of the back<br>
side, through the air exit portions 4 acting as air exits<br>
formed at end portions, after passing through the back side,<br>
chest, armpits, and the like. However, the air leakage<br>
prevention means may be omitted depending on an attached<br>
position of the parallel airstream generation device, a<br>
purpose of use of the cooling suit itself, and the like.<br>
[0034]<br>
[Second Embodiment]<br>
There will be explained a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention with reference to the drawings. The<br>
second embodiment is applied to a worksuit having a cooling<br>
capacity higher than that of the cooling suit of the first<br>
embodiment. The second embodiment has an air blowing<br>
capacity of about 20m3/H which is two times that of the<br>
first embodiment. The second embodiment is differentiated<br>
from the first embodiment, because, in the second<br>
embodiment: there is adopted a propeller as vanes of each<br>
parallel airstream generation device, instead of a vane<br>
wheel; there is provided a new air exit portion provided<br>
with an air permeation sheet, as an exit of air; and there<br>
is provided a fixation belt as fixation means for<br>
preventing a large fan from being swung due to a movement<br>
of a wearer's body. Other configuration is the same as<br><br>
that in of the first embodiment. Thus, like reference<br>
numerals as used in the first embodiment are used to denote<br>
elements of the second embodiment having the same functions<br>
as the first embodiment, and the detailed description<br>
thereof will be omitted.<br>
[0035] FIG. 6A is a schematic front view of the<br>
cooling suit according to the second embodiment when viewed<br>
from the front side, and FIG. 6B is a schematic rear view<br>
of the cooling suit when viewed from the back side.<br>
Attached to an upper portion of a back side of the cooling<br>
suit of this embodiment, is an air permeation sheet 15<br>
which is a cloth having a larger air permeability instead<br>
of a cloth of a garment, such that also the attached<br>
portion becomes an air exit portion 4. In the following,<br>
such an air exit portion 4 in the second embodiment is<br>
called a "second air exit portion", and each air exit<br>
portion 4 as in the first embodiment is called a "first air<br>
exit portion", so as to distinguish them from each other.<br>
[0036] FIG. 7A is a schematic front view of each fan<br>
used in the second embodiment, and FIG. 7B is a schematic<br>
side view thereof. Each fan of the second embodiment is<br>
different from that of the first embodiment, in that the<br>
former adopts a propeller 17 instead of the vane wheel for<br>
vanes used in the latter. The propeller 17 is rotated by a<br>
motor 11 in a direction to introduce outside air, in a<br>
manner to introduce the outside air and to feed airstreams<br>
perpendicularly to a rotation plane of the propeller.<br><br>
However, the airstreams impinge on a parallel airstream<br>
conversion plate (parallel airstream conversion means) 19,<br>
and are converted into a direction parallel to the rotation<br>
plane of the propeller as shown by lateral arrows so that<br>
the airstreams are made parallel to a wearer's body. Note<br>
that the bottom 9 of a fan casing simultaneously serve as<br>
the parallel airstream conversion plate 19 in this<br>
embodiment. Further, there is provided an over-cooling<br>
prevention cloth 12 (not shown) also in this embodiment.<br>
[0037] Here, required between a lower end of the<br>
propeller and the parallel airstream conversion plate 19 is<br>
a spacing "H" which is about 1/5 times a diameter of the<br>
propeller, and spacings less than it lead to considerably<br>
reduced air blowing amounts. At the minimum, there will be<br>
required 1/10 times. Although this leads to an increased<br>
thickness of the fan as compared with the sideward-flow fan<br>
used in the first embodiment, there is provided an<br>
advantage that the same airstream amount as the sideward-<br>
flow fan is generated by a power consumption smaller than<br>
that of the sideward-flow fan. Note that the spacing "H"<br>
may be set at zero depending on the usage, such as when a<br>
small amount of airstream will do.<br>
[0038] FIG. 8 is a schematic view of a situation<br>
where the fastener 6 of the cooling suit of this embodiment<br>
is opened to spread the fixation belt 16 having fans 3<br>
attached thereto. The fixation belt 16 of this embodiment<br>
is provided for attaching the two fans 3 to the wearer's<br><br>
body in a closely contacted manner. Note that an electric-<br>
power source or battery (not shown), cords, and the like<br>
are detachably attached to the garment similarly to the<br>
first embodiment. The fixation belt 16 has opposite ends<br>
each having a string 21 attached thereto acting as fixation<br>
belt connection means. The cooling suit of this embodiment<br>
requiring a larger cooling capacity requires larger fans so<br>
that the weight of fans is also increased. Attaching large<br>
and heavy fans to the garment 2 not only causes the fans to<br>
be inclined to thereby deteriorate the capabilities thereof,<br>
but also swings the fans to deteriorate the workability<br>
when the user moves around. The fixation belt 16 is<br>
provided as a countermeasure thereto, in a manner to cause<br>
the fans 3 to be closely contacted with the wearer's body<br>
to solve the above-described problem. Note that the<br>
fixation belt 16 may be fixed to the garment 2 at several<br>
locations, or may be made free from the garment 2 without<br>
being fixed thereto. Even when the fixation belt 16 is<br>
made free, the fans are fixed to the garment by magic tapes<br>
of the fans.<br>
[0039] FIG. 9A is a schematic front view of a mixed-<br>
flow fan of a modification of the second embodiment, and<br>
FIG. 9B is a schematic cross-sectional view thereof viewed<br>
in a direction of arrow B-B'. Note that the fan casing 31<br>
is omitted in FIG. 9B for simplification. This<br>
modification is configured to use vanes 20 of a mixed-flow<br>
fan, instead of a propeller. The structure of the vanes of<br><br>
the mixed-flow fan is intermediate between those of a<br>
sideward-flow fan and a propeller fan, and is intermediate<br>
also in property, in a manner to introduce air from its<br>
front face as indicated by vertical arrows shown in FIG. 9<br>
and to deliver the air in an obliquely rearward direction.<br>
There is thus required a spacing "H" between the lower<br>
portions of the vanes and the parallel airstream conversion<br>
plate even when adopting this type of vanes. However, the<br>
length of the required spacing "H" is made large when the<br>
vane shape is analogous to that of a propeller, and is made<br>
small when the vane shape is analogous to a vane wheel.<br>
Note that the spacing "H" may be set at zero also in this<br>
case depending on the usage, such as when a small amount of<br>
airstream will do.<br>
[0040] Upon using the cooling suit of this embodiment,<br>
arms are passed through the sleeves, respectively, then the<br>
strings 21 attached at the front ends of the fixation belt<br>
16 are knotted together before the fastener 6 is closed to<br>
thereby fix the fans to the wearer's body, and thereafter<br>
the fastener is closed. Of course, the connection means of<br>
the fixation belt 16 is not limited to the strings, and<br>
magic tape or the like may be used.<br>
[0041] According to this embodiment, airstreams blown<br>
into the interior of the garment (guide sheet) by the<br>
parallel airstream generation devices are guided by the<br>
guide sheet parallelly to the wearer's body and exhausted<br>
to the exterior through the air exit portions acting as air<br><br>
exits, respectively, in the same manner as the first<br>
embodiment. In this embodiment, a part of the upper<br>
portion of the back side of the garment is substituted by<br>
the air permeation sheet, thereby becoming the second air<br>
exit portion in addition to the first air exit portions.<br>
It is typical and frequent that a collar portion of a<br>
worksuit or the like has a front portion which is to be<br>
largely opened and a rear portion which is to be closely<br>
contacted with a neck of a wearer. In such a configuration,<br>
the collar portion of the worksuit is insufficient at the<br>
rear portion thereof in function as an air exit portion, so<br>
that airflows are not so established at an upper portion of<br>
the back side of the wearer. To aid it, the part of the<br>
cloth of the garment at the upper portion of its back side<br>
is substituted by the sheet which has an excellent air<br>
permeability to thereby cause the part to function as an<br>
air exit portion, thereby enabling improvement of an<br>
airstream amount at the upper portion of the back side.<br>
Other functions and effects of this embodiment are the same<br>
as those of the first embodiment.<br>
[0042]<br>
[Third Embodiment]<br>
There will be explained a third embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The third embodiment is different from the first<br>
embodiment and second embodiment, in that the former includes a<br>
fixation belt having not only fans but also an electric-power<br>
source, being a fuel cell such as battery, cords and the like,<br><br>
attached thereto. Other points are the same as those in<br>
the second embodiment. Thus, like reference numerals as<br>
used in the second embodiment are used to denote elements<br>
of the third embodiment having the same functions as the<br>
second embodiment, and the detailed description thereof<br>
will be omitted. FIG. 10A is a schematic view of this<br>
embodiment in a state where the fixation belt 160 of this<br>
embodiment is developed. The fixation belt 160 of this<br>
embodiment has a width larger than a diameter of each fan 3,<br>
and has two fans 3, electric power supply cords 32, and an<br>
electric-power source 33 detachably attached to the belt.<br>
Thus, the fixation belt 160 can be regarded as an item<br>
realized by eliminating a guide sheet (garment) from a<br>
cooling suit. FIG. 10B is an enlarged schematic view of<br>
the vicinity of air inlets 2a of a garment having the<br>
fixation belt 160 attached thereto. Provided around the<br>
air inlets 2a are magic tapes 8b in donut shapes,<br>
respectively. Also provided at flange portions 8 of the<br>
fans 3 are magic tapes 8a, respectively, in the above-<br>
described manner. The fixation belt 160 of this embodiment<br>
is attached to the garment by joining the magic tapes 8a of<br>
the fixation belt 160 to the magic tapes 8b of the garment,<br>
respectively, in a closely contacted manner.<br>
[0043] According to this embodiment, detaching the<br>
fixation belt 160 from the garment allows the fans,<br>
electric-power source, and cords to be simultaneously<br>
detached without a burden, such as when the cooling suit is<br><br>
to be washed. Further, this embodiment is substantially<br>
the same in configuration as the second embodiment insofar<br>
as the fixation belt 160 is attached to the garment 2. and<br>
the manner for wearing the garment 2 is the same as the<br>
second embodiment. The third embodiment has its most<br>
remarkable advantage in that the electrical components can<br>
be collectively and readily attached and detached upon<br>
washing as described above. Further, since all the<br>
electrical components are fixed onto the belt, handling is<br>
facilitated with less trouble. Note that the fixation belt<br>
160 is to be desirably fabricated from a material which<br>
rarely gets dirty and is readily wiped down even when it<br>
gets dirty, since the fixation belt itself should not be<br>
washed. Particularly preferable is a material which does<br>
not absorb perspiration, and it is desirable to perform an<br>
antifungal process thereto. Preferably, such material is<br>
synthetic resin like polyester or polypropylene. Also<br>
preferably, antimicrobial powder developed by incorporating<br>
silver ions with antimicrobial power into the structure of<br>
zeolite is kneaded into the material to perform an<br>
antifungal process thereto. Further, attachment and<br>
detachment of the fixation belt to and from the garment 2<br>
are not limited to the method by magic tapes, and any<br>
method will do insofar as a large air leakage is absent<br>
between the fans attached to the fixation belt and the<br>
garment. Moreover, the functions and effects of this<br>
embodiment are the same as those of the second embodiment.<br>
[0044] Examples of fans to be attached onto the<br>
fixation belt include one having a front face fan guard,<br>
and one without a front face fan guard while forming the<br>
front face fan guard at the side of a garment. In this<br>
case, it is possible to apply a mesh or the like across an<br><br>
air inlet 2a of a garment, for example, instead of a front<br>
face fan guard. Further, as shown in FIG. 11, it is also<br>
possible to attach a fixation belt 160 onto a garment, in a<br>
manner to: fabricate a lid part 200 comprising a lid-<br>
oriented fan guard 201, a flange portion 202, and a<br>
cylinder portion 203 in a tapered shape as shown in FIG.<br>
11; and to fit the cylinder portion 203 of the lid part 200<br>
into an inside of the flange portion of the fan 3 as shown<br>
in FIG. 12 to thereby clamp the garment around the air<br>
inlet 2a between the flange portion 202 of the lid part 200<br>
and the flange portion 8 of the fan 3 in a manner to couple<br>
the lid part 200 to the fan 3. Note that the coupling<br>
method of the lid part and the fan is not limited to the<br>
above method, and any coupling method will do insofar as<br>
the fixation belt 160 can be attached to the garment by<br>
clamping the garment between the lid part and the fan.<br>
Further, vanes within the fan casing are omitted in FIG. 12<br>
for simplification.<br>
[0045]<br>
[Other Embodiments]<br>
The present invention is not limited to the above<br>
embodiments, and many variants are possible within the<br>
scope of the gist of the present invention. For example,<br>
although the above embodiments have been each described for<br>
a situation where the cooling suit is a jacket for working,<br>
the present invention may be embodied as a cooling suit<br>
which is a pair of overalls including a jacket integrally<br><br>
formed with trousers shown in FIG. 13, for example. In<br>
this case, also gaps between hemlines of the overalls and<br>
the feet become air exit portions 4, respectively. Further,<br>
since this embodiment comprises the overalls, there is<br>
unrequired air leakage prevention means 5.<br>
[0046] Although the above embodiments are each<br>
provided with the fastener 6 for opening and closing the<br>
associated garment, the present invention is not limited<br>
thereto and any method will do insofar as the same provides<br>
less air leakage. Contrary, it is possible to allow air<br>
leakage to a certain extent, so as to utilize an opening<br>
and closing portion of a garment as one of air exits (for<br>
example, buttons are used instead of a fastener).<br>
[0047] Furthermore, in case of adoption of the<br>
propeller fan as the parallel airstream generation device<br>
as described in the second embodiment, the thickness of the<br>
propeller can be reduced by increasing the number of vanes,<br>
such that the fan is not necessarily attached to an inside<br>
of a garment and may be attached to an outside of the<br>
garment when the entirety of fan is made small in thickness.<br>
[0048] In case of adopting vanes of the propeller or<br>
mixed-flow fan, the parallel airstream conversion plate as<br>
the parallel airstream conversion means has been provided<br>
at a position separated from the lower end of the vanes by<br>
the spacing "H". However, the parallel airstream<br>
conversion means is not limited to the plate-like shape,<br>
and is rather desirably formed into a 3-dimensional shape<br><br>
capable of smoothly converting an airstream direction, such<br>
as a parallel airstream conversion plate 190 in a<br>
substantially conical shape as shown in FIG. 14, for<br>
example. Further, it is unnecessary to provide a parallel<br>
airstream conversion plate or the like insofar as a spacing<br>
"H" is formed between a propeller or the like and an<br>
undergarment, and then the wearer's body or undergarment<br>
plays the same role as a parallel airstream conversion<br>
plate. In other words, the formation itself of the spacing<br>
"H" can be regarded as the parallel airstream conversion<br>
means. It is further possible to automatically form a<br>
spacing "H" by a pressure of airstream to be blown onto a<br>
wearer's body, even without previously providing the<br>
spacing "H". In this case, the parallel airstream<br>
conversion means is to be formed by the garment and the<br>
fan(s).<br>
[0049] Further, the shape of the cloth is not limited<br>
to those which fasten in front such as described in the<br>
above embodiments, and may be a T-shirt or the like. In<br>
case of a T-shirt, air exit portions are to be provided by<br>
a collar portion, sleeves, and hemline of the T-shirt.<br>
[0050] The guide sheet (garment) may have a certain<br>
air permeability depending on a purpose, insofar as<br>
sufficient parallel airstreams can be flowed by a fan(s)<br>
providing a larger air blowing amount. In this case, since<br>
pressures are particularly increased in an area around the<br>
fan(s), the effect thereof is improved by providing a guide<br><br>
sheet (garment) having a smaller air permeability in such<br>
an area only. Meanwhile, in case of a long-sleeved cooling<br>
suit, it is likely that parallel airstreams are not flowed<br>
deeply into sleeves depending on a shape the cooling<br>
suit. In this case, it may be sometimes desirable to adopt<br>
a cloth having a due air permeability, since airstreams<br>
will then impinge on arms when the arms are moved.<br>
[0051] Moreover, the electric-power source means is<br>
not limited to a battery. and may be a commercial-power<br>
supply. For example, it is possible to supply electric<br>
power to the cooling suit of the present invention having<br>
its cord kept connected to a commercial-power supply, such<br>
as when a wearer works in a state sitting on substantially<br>
the same position.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
[0052] According to the present invention as<br>
described above, it becomes possible to cause a large<br>
amount of air to flow parallelly to a wearer's body so as<br>
to largely extend an effective area under the influence of<br>
a physiological cooling ability of the wearer to thereby<br>
assuredly cool the wearer's body even in a situation where<br>
a large amount of perspiration is exuded. It is thus<br>
possible to apply the present invention to a cooling suit<br>
to be used for cooling a wearer's body in a situation where<br>
a large amount of perspiration is exuded.<br><br>

parallel air generating means (3) for taking air from the air in-<br>
take port therein and generating parallel air generally parallel<br>
with a body, a guide sheet used commonly as the clothes (2) for<br>
guiding, parallel with the body, the parallel air generated by the<br>
parallel air generating means, an air outlet part discharging the<br>
parallel air to the outside, and a power supply means for supplying <br>
power to the parallel air generating means. The cooling<br>
clothes are characterized in that a pressure between the guide<br>
sheet and an underwear is made positive to form an air flow<br>
space by sending air between the guide sheet and the underwear<br>
at a total rate of approximately 5 to 300 m3/h by the parallel air<br>
generating means, vapor caused by sweat is discharged to the<br>
outside and fresh outside air is constantly sent therein by flowing <br>
air in the air flowing space to remarkably relieve the conditions <br>
under which sweat is allowed to be evaporated.</td>
