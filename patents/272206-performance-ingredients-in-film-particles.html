COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
PERFORMANCE INGREDIENTS IN FILM PARTICLES<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
PERFORMANCE INGREDIENTS IN FILM PARTICLES<br>
This invention relates to granular detergent compositions comprising a plurality of film particles.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
It is known to include visually contrasting particles in granular laundry detergent compositions.  The contrasting particles may deliver a functional ingredient or may simply provide a visual cue to the user.<br>
In US 4082682, a minor proportion of contrastingly colored elongated soap particles is added to a detergent powder. The contrasting particles comprise a non fabric-substantive dye and a fluorescer.  The powder comprises a detergency builder compound.  The soap particles contribute detergency to the composition and reduce foaming.  Because the soap particles could sink onto the fabric it is a stated advantage of the particles that they do not cause staining of the fabric with which they come into contact.<br>
In GB2358403A a powder detergent composition having a major proportion of white or light-coloured particles has dry mixed into it a.minor proportion of lamellar visually contrasting bodies of significantly larger average particle size in at least one dimension than the average particle size of the white or light-coloured particles.  The examples used contrasting circular or star shaped bodies made of<br>
 <br>
coloured water-soluble polymer film.  The visually contrasting bodies may optionally contain detergent functional ingredients.<br>
WO2006/079416 proposes to use a highly soluble film particle as a visual cue.  It is suggested to be possible to include functional ingredients within the film e.g. surface active agents, perfume, antioxidant, antifoam.  Examples in this application compare detergent powders containing 0.1 wt% visual cues made from polyvinyl alcohol with visual cues made from gum Arabic.  Suitably, the film particles could be chosen to pass a 1400 µm sieve, but not a 500 µm sieve.<br>
It is known to add sensitive ingredients to laundry powders as separately manufactured granules.  This process may be referred to as dry mixing or post dosing.<br>
US4176079 describes an alternative to post dosing granules. An enzyme is incorporated into a water soluble film and the functional film so produced is cut into squares, rectangles or strips and added to a detergent powder. Typical film additive compositions are polyvinyl alcohol 48.7 % and nonionic surfactant 43.8 % (balance water and enzyme). The cut functional film additive has a surface area of 300 mm .<br>
US 2005/0075261 Al relates to a water-soluble and/or water dispersible particle comprising an active ingredient, preferably an enzyme, in a matrix comprising from 20-95% of the particle of a specified polyvinylalcohol polymer.  The examples make the particle by applying a chopping action to an extruded noodle.  This would tend to make a granular<br>
 <br>
(spherical) particle.  Other active ingredients suggested for inclusion at levels of 0.1 to 55% include: bleaches, bleach activators, bleach catalysts, brighteners and photobleaches.  The particle size ranges from 200um to 2000pm, preferably 250um to 800µm.  In an embodiment where the extruded (cylindrical) particle is not chopped up it can be up to 20mm long, but it is preferably less than 1mm long and has a preferred particle size distribution of l00µm to 800µm.<br>
There remain a number of problems relating to the use of film particles in granular detergent compositions, especially granular laundry detergents.<br>
A major problem is to make a visual cue film particle that aids cleaning.  Surprisingly, we have now found new benefits from delivery of specific benefit ingredients from a film particle.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a granular detergent composition comprising a plurality of film particles, each film particle comprising at least 30% polymer and 0.01 to lwt% of a benefit ingredient selected from the group comprising: shading dye, shading pigment, photobleach, fluorescer, antioxidant, transition metal catalyst and mixtures thereof characterised in that the thickness of each film particle is less than 0.5 mm and the<br>
 <br>
cross sectional area of each film particle is between 4 mm2 and 100mm2.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Granular laundry detergent compositions are mainly composed of surfactants and electrolytes.  Typical surfactants include linear alkyl benzene sulphonates, primary alcohol sulphates, linear alcohol ethoxysulphates and alcohol ethoxylates.  Typical electrolytes are inorganic materials such as sodium sulphate, sodium chloride, sodium tripolyphosphates, sodium carbonate, silicas, and zeolites and organic materials such as polycarboxylates and citric acid.<br>
To give additional wash benefits, benefit ingredients; namely fluorescers, shading dyes, photobleaches antioxidant and catalysts, may be included at low levels.  Such benefit ingredients are most cost-effective when added at very low levels, typically less than 0.1wt% of the composition.  The benefit ingredients are usually granulated and then post-dosed into the granular composition.  This inevitably results in localised high concentrations of the benefit ingredient, which can cause problems if they come into contact with certain fabrics before they have had an opportunity to dissolve or disperse into the wash liquor. This problem is caused by the localised high concentration of the benefit ingredient and not by the timing of its release.  The problem occurs particularly for low molecular weight benefit ingredients that cause damage to fabrics when<br>
 <br>
present at very high concentrations, particularly if delivered from a carrier substrate that has a higher solubility and/or dispersibilty than the benefit ingredient.<br>
Encapsulation of the benefit ingredient or ingredients within soluble polymeric film particles provides a solution to this problem.  The amount of benefit ingredient in the film particle is preferably 0.05 to 1.0 wt% of the film particle.<br>
The film particles are desirably rendered visible by non fabric-substantive dye that gives them a contrasting colour from the granules making up the remainder of the granular composition.<br>
Granular detergent compositions of lighter colour than the film particles advantageously include some fluorescer and/or shading dye in the granules to give a higher contrast between the granules and the film particles.<br>
The granular detergent composition is preferably highly alkaline when dissolved in deionised water.  A 0.1% solution at 25 °C is &gt; pH 10.5.  To achieve this pH the granular detergent composition may advantageously comprise silicate and/or carbonate.<br>
The film particle is preferably more near to a neutral pH to protect the benefit ingredient or ingredients contained therein.  It has a pH of 3 to 9, preferably 6 to 8 when dissolved to form a 0.1% solution in deionised water.<br>
 <br>
Although many soluble polymers could be suitable for inclusion in the film particle, a preferred polymeric material is polyvinyl alcohol.  To improve its solubility and to facilitate easy inclusion of the benefit ingredients the film particles desirably further comprise 5 to 50 wt% surfactant.  Preferred surfactant contQnt of the film particles is at least 5 wt% anionic surfactant, most preferably an alkyl sulphate.<br>
Preferred film compositions are those	that comprise a<br>
polymer and a surfactant.  Optionally	a. colorant is also<br>
included as a pxeferred ingredient of	the filmr   in addition<br>
to the performance ingredient.<br>
Optional further ingredients are: adjuncts to assist in the manufacture of the film, for instance release agents and water.  Besides its effect of control of relative humidity of the film, water also assists in plasticising the film and regulates its solubility.<br>
The polymer may be selected from water soluble film forming polymers, especially those used in formulation of detergent powders.  Preferred polymers include polymers which dissolve and/disperse completely in water within 30 minutes with agitation at a temperature anywhere in the range of from 293 to 333K.<br>
Preferred water soluble polymers are those capable of being cast into a film or solid mass, for example as described in Davidson and Sittig, Water-Soluble Resins, Van Nostrand Reinhold Company, New York (1968) .  Preferred water-soluble<br>
 <br>
resins include polyvinyl alcohol, cellulose ethers, polyethylene oxide, starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, polyvinyl methyl ether-maleic anhydride, polymaleic anhydride, styrene maleic anhydride, hydroxyethy1cellulose, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, polyethylene glycols, carboxymethylcellulose, polyacrylic acid salts, alginates, acrylamide copolymers, guar gum, casein, ethylene-maleic anhydride resin series, polyethyleneimine, ethyl hydroxyethylcellulose, ethyl methylcellulose, hydroxyethyl methylcellulose, sugars. Lower molecular weight water-soluble, polyvinyl alcohol film-forming resins are preferred.<br>
Polyvinyl alcohols preferred for use therein have an average molecular weight anywhere between 1,000 and 1,000,000, preferably between 5,000 and 250,000, for example between 15,000 and 150,000.  Hydrolysis, or alcoholysis, is defined as the percent completion of the reaction where acetate groups on the resin are substituted with hydroxyl, -OH, groups, A hydrolysis range of from 60-99% of polyvinyl alcohol film-forming resin is preferred, while a more preferred range of hydrolysis is from about 70-90% for water-soluble, polyvinyl alcohol film-forming resins.  The most preferred range of hydrolysis is 80-89%.  As used in this application, the term "polyvinyl alcohol" includes polyvinyl acetate compounds with levels of hydroloysis disclosed herein.<br>
Another suitable polymer is a polyvinyl alcohol film, made of a polyvinyl alcohol copolymer having a comonomer having a carboxylate function.<br>
 <br>
The preferred grade of PVA picks up water only at an RH well above that of granular detergent compositions.  Thereby, it protects the other film ingredients from decomposition by water and soluble dyes from bleeding.<br>
The visual cue film particle may comprise 10 to 80% polymer or polymer mixture.<br>
Although any suitable surfactant or surfactant system may be used, the surfactant is preferably an anionic surfactant, especially if the granular composition comprises a builder.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants include are well-known to those skilled in the art.  Examples of high-foaming sulphonate or sulphate type surfactants include alkylbenzene sulphonates, particularly linear alkylbenzene sulphonates having an alkyl chain length of C8-C15; primary and secondary alkylsulphates, particularly C8-C15 primary alkyl sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates.  Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>
Further information is given in the open literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents"', Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred anionic surfactants are alkylbenzene sulphonates, more especially linear alkylbenzene sulphonate (LAS), which is preferably present in an amount of from 12 to 24 wt%, more preferably from 12 to 22 wt% and especially from 15 to 22 wt%.<br>
 <br>
Even more preferred are primary alcohol sulphates (PAS), particularly C8-C18, preferably C12-C15, primary alcohol sulphates.  A particularly preferred surfactant is primary alcohol sulphate (PAS) with a carbon chain length of 12. Visual cue Film particles containing up to 50 % PAS, may be used.<br>
The film may additionally include a second surfactant.  The second surfactant is preferably chosen from amphoteric surfactants, zwitterionic surfactants, nonionic surfactants and ethoxylated anionic surfactants.<br>
Preferred amphoteric second surfactants are amine oxides. The most preferred amine oxide is coco dimethylamine oxide.<br>
Preferred zwitterionic second surfactants are betaines, and especially amidobetaines, for example, coco amidopropyl betaine.<br>
Preferred nonionic second surfactants include the primary and secondary alcohol ethoxylates, especially the C8-C20 aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 20 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, and more especially the C10-C15 primary and secondary aliphatic alcohols ethoxylated with an average of from 1 to 10 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol.<br>
Preferred ethoxylated anionic second surfactants, include alkyl ether sulphates (ethoxylated alcohol sulphates).<br>
 <br>
Also suitable for use as second surfactants in the visual cues of the present invention are C8-C18 alkyl monoethanolamides, for example, coco monoethanolamide.<br>
The second surfactant system used in the film particle may additionally comprise minor amounts, e.g. less than 5% of the film, of cationic surfactant.<br>
Surfactant may be included at a level of up to 90 wt%, preferably up to 75 wt%, most preferably up to 60 wt% in the film.<br>
The visual cue needs to be easily visible in wash liquor as well as against the background of the detergent formulation, therefore it is preferably coloured.  Non fabric-substantive colorants may be included in the film composition at a level of 0.001 to 0.5 wt%, preferably 0.1 to 0.3 wt% of the film.<br>
Suitable colorants include any that are used to colour detergent liquids or powders.  Yellow, blue, violet, purple, red, orange, green, pink are preferred colours.<br>
To get most effective use of their washing products many consumers soak their clothes in a solution of a laundry detergent composition.  Often the clothes are placed into water, the laundry detergent composition sprinkled on top and clothes then left for 2 to 200 minutes.  In this procedure, a granular laundry detergent composition may not fully dissolve and spotting of the clothes fabric with the benefit ingredients may occur.  Spotting involves the incomplete dissolution of the granules and the subsequent<br>
 <br>
forming of a localised high concentration of the benefit ingredient in contact with the fabric of the clothes, this highly concentrated and localised overdose of benefit ingredient may then gel and it is then inhibited from further dispersion or dissolution.  This problem is most pronounced and obvious with dyes and photobleaches where clear coloured spots occur on the fabric of the clothes. The phenomenon also reduces the effectiveness of the benefit ingredients, because not all of the ingredient is made available to the full wash.<br>
This problem may be overcome by incorporating the benefit ingredients in a soluble polymer film that is then cut into discrete pieces having a low cross sectional area of less than 100mm2.  Such film particles may also serve the purpose of visual cues if they also include dye.  Their function as a visual cue may be further enhanced by cutting the film particles into the shape of a flower with petals, or some other such natural object.  The cross-sectional area should be at least 4mm2.  By cross-sectional area we mean the actual surface area of one side of the planar film particle.<br>
The film particles have the additional advantage of keeping the often sensitive benefit ingredients away from the aggressive high pH of a base laundry detergent composition. It provides a clear visual cue to the user that the benefit ingredient is present.  It is particularly desirable that the film particle floats when first added to water.  This enhances the visibility of the film particle in use and can also assist with the reduction of spotting or other fabric damage due to the initial dissolution taking place on the<br>
 <br>
surface, which is likely to be remote from most of the fabrics being washed.  To ensure that the film particle floats it is preferred that its relative density is less than 0.8, more preferably less than 0.5 and most preferably less than 0.4.<br>
The thickness of the planar film of the film particle is at most 0.5mm.  Preferably it is less than 0.3mm, most preferably 0.2mm.  The film is of relatively uniform thickness to allow predictable dissolution characteristics. The thickness tolerance is at most plus or minus 20%, preferably plus or minus 10%.<br>

The invention will now be further described with reference to the following non limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A film containing the [nitrolotris(2,1-ethanediyloxy)] tris[propanol] salt of direct violet 9 was prepared as follows:<br>
A 30% solution of polymer (Polyvinyl alcohol) and surfactant (Lauryl Ether Sulphate) are dissolved in water at 60°C. After complete dissolution, 0.8% of the [nitrolotris(2,1-ethanediyloxy)] tris [propanol] salt of direct violet 9 is added and dissolved.  This final solution is then spread as a thin layer over a glass plate of 24 x 34 cm and dried at 70-90°C in a drying oven.<br>
After complete drying, the resulting film is taken from the glass plate and cut into the desired film particle shapes.<br>
 <br>
When film particles were dissolved in water to make a 0.284 wt% solution, the solution had an optical absorption at 550 nm (1cm path length) of 0.875.<br>
Example 2<br>
Sodium carbonate granules containing nominally 0.1 wt% of the [nitrolotris(2,1-ethanediyloxy)]tris[propanol] salt of direct violet 9, were created by mixing an aqueous solution of the dye with sodium carbonate and drying.  The dye is an effective shading agent benefit ingredient for fabric whiteness.<br>
When granules were dissolved in water to make a 1.83 wt% solution, the solution had an optical absorption at 550 nm (lcm path length) of 0.442.  Therefore, the film particle is calculated to contain 13 times more dye per weight than the granules.<br>
Example 3<br>
Three 3 gram samples of a washing powder were prepared.  The powder contained 18 wt% sodium LAS, 73 wt% salts (silicate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium sulphate, sodium carbonate), remainder impurities water and minors (enzymes and fluorescer).  The three samples were labelled A, B and C. To A was added O.lOOg of the carbonate granule of Example 2. To B was added O.Ollg of the dye benefit ingredient containing film particles of Example 1.  To C was added 0.084g of the film particles of Example 1.  Thus, the<br>
 <br>
amounts of shading dye benefit ingredient in the samples were in the ratio A:B:C of 1:1.4:11.<br>
In Examples B and C the dye film was cut into film particles with a cross sectional area of 5 to 6 mm2.<br>
Samples were thoroughly mixed before use.<br>
A. 1.7g piece of bleached non-mercerised, white woven cotton sheeting was placed in a beaker, so that the fabric filled the bottom of the beaker in a single flat layer.  To this was added 10 0ml of demineralised water, then sample A  was sprinkled over the cloth.  The solution was gently agitated for a minute then left for 5 minutes.  The cloth was removed and thoroughly rinsed twice, and left to dry.<br>
The experiment was repeated with samples B and C.<br>
Once the cloths had dried the number of dye spots on the cloths were counted.  The results are shown in table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
<br>
Example	No. of large spots	No. of small spots<br>
A	18	106<br>
B	0	2<br>
C	7	3<br>
Large spots have a diameter of greater than 1 mm.  Small spots have a diameter of less than 1 mm.<br>
 <br>
Although samples B and C contain more dye than A, there is a huge reduction in spotting.<br>
