FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to alkoxylated alkanolisosteararmides useful as adjuvants to modify the rheological properties of surfactant systems. More specifically, the invention relates to polypropylene glycol hydroxyethyl isostearamide compositions and methods of use to provide unanticipated and exceptional increases in viscosity, especially when used as the sole thickener for a surfactant system.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE RELATED TECHNOLOGY<br>
Surfactants may be combined in a cleansing system to alter the properties and/or esthetic qualities of the system including rheology. Rheology is the study of how materials deform and flow under the influence of external forces. Viscosity, which is the measure of resistance to flow, is one aspect of the scientific discipline of rheology. One area in which Theological properties are important is related to liquid cleansers and personal care products. The rheological properties of liquid cleansers, such as shampoos, liquid hand cleansers, and industrial cleansers, are a key element of their acceptability in the marketplace. A consumer will purchase these products based on their esthetics or perceived qualities. Even though a product may be otherwise functional, a consumer will often not repurchase a product, if there is the slightest degradation of esthetics compared to the expected profile which includes the thickness and feel of the product.<br>
Desirable properties of surfactants include the ability to increase viscosity (or thicken), maintain color stability, and provide foam boosting and stabilization. Monoethanolamides and diethanolamides are commonly known to provide these characteristics. These are typically added to a cleansing system that includes a primary surfactant which may be cationic, anionic, nonionic, or amphoteric. Surfactants that are frequently used as the primary surfactant in personal care and industrial cleanser products include sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), sodium laureth sulfate (SLES), ammonium lauryl sulfate (ALS), ammonium lauryl ether sulfate (ALES), alpha olefin sulfonates (AOS) such as 2-alkene sulfonate, 3-hydroxyalkene sulfonate, 4-hydroxyalkene sulfonate, secondary C14-17 alkane sulfonates (SAS), amine oxides, cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAB), and combinations<br>

 <br>
<br>
<br>
thereof. Both diethanolamides and monoethanolamides, as will be discussed later herein, have disadvantages associated with their use.<br>
Surfactant compositions, particularly anionic and cationic ones, will frequently include an addition of sodium chloride or other salts to modulate the viscosity of a liquid cleansing system. Typical cleansing systems use between 0.05% and 3% by weight or more salt to control the viscosity to a desired level. SLS and SLES are two commonly employed surfactants that can be thickened with only nonionic surfactants and salt. Economically, it is highly desirable to achieve a rich, thickened formulation with only a minimum amount of surfactants, since water and salt are very inexpensive.<br>
Branched surfactant materials are usually much more difficult to thicken than straight chain counterparts. An example of this is C14-16 alpha olefin sulfonates, a mixed anionic surfactant which contains a portion of hydroxy branching and another example is secondary (C14-C17) alkane sulfonates (SAS). The materials are significantly harder to thicken in a traditional manner (using non-ionic surfactants and salt) as compared to the predominantly linear SLS or SLES type surfactants.<br>
Typically, liquid alkyl diethanolamide (DEA) surfactants have been used as foam boosters and thickeners in liquid cleansing systems. One of the most favorable attributes of diethanolamides is their liquidity at room temperature. This allows cleansing products to be manufactured without the additional step of heating the production batch thereby saving the cost of providing the heat energy needed. However, diethanolamides have unfavorable characteristics and are frequently associated with diethanolamines, which can react with nitrogen oxides and sodium nitrite to form nitrosamuies, which are known to be carcinogenic. Consequently, diethanolamides are poor choice for inclusion in future surfactant formulations due to possible regulatory considerations.<br>
Cocamide MEA (monoethanolamide) is also known to provide the desired thickening properties. However, monoethanolamides, including cocamide MEA, are not generally a liquid at room temperature and therefore require an additional heating step. Furthermore, it is difficult to incorporate fragrances in monoethanolamides due to their solid state at room temperature. -The more desirable method of incorporating a fragrance into a surfactant<br>
system, which will include water, is to mix the fragrance with a liquid surfactant first, because the fragrances are frequently oil-soluble and not water soluble.<br>
Individual alkoxylated alkanolamide surfactants for cleansing systems and methods of preparation have been disclosed in a U.S. Application No. 09/793,042, filed February 26, 2001, a continuation of U.S. Application No. 09/334,812 filed June 17,1999, now abandoned, which is a continuation in part of U.S. Application No. 09/038,736 filed March 11, 1998, all of which are hereby incorporated by reference. These alkoxylated alkanolamides may include capryl, stearic, soy oil, and coconut oil fatty monoethanolamides.<br>
While each of these materials have many useful properties, they have potential drawbacks if used individually as the sole thickener. These potential drawbacks include one or more of the following: poor color stability, poor viscosity increasing performance, or poor foam boosting performance as well as incompatibility with some surfactant systems. One example is polypropylene glycol (PPG) hydroxyethyl caprylamide, which provides excellent color stability and is a good foam booster, but has little viscosity building character. Another example is PPG hydroxyethyl cocamide, which is compatible with nearly all surfactant systems and has good color stability, but does not build viscosity very well in comparison to cocamide MEA, from which it is derived. A third example, PPG hydroxyethyl soyamide (a straight chained unsaturated C18 derived from soy bean oil) provides viscosity building character, but has poor color stability.<br>
Japanese Laid Open Patent Application No. 8-337560 to Kawaken Fine Chemicals Co., Ltd, also describes propoxylated amides, but does not disclose surfactant compositions that exclude diethanolamides. Furthermore, Kawaken recognizes no difference<br>
Consequently, there is a need to provide a surfactant composition that is substantially a liquid at room temperature, and increases viscosity and foam boosting, while providing color stability and desired rheological properties and does not have the potential to create nitrosamines. Desirably, the surfactant composition may also act as a solubilizer to make added substances soluble in the preparation of either solid or liquid compositions.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a surfactant system that includes a primary surfactant composition and an adjuvant composition that includes poly (C2-C4) alkylene glycol hydroxy (C2-C3) alkyl isostearamide, wherein the adjuvant composition is substantially a liquid at room temperature and modifies the rheological properties of the surfactant system. The adjuvant enables the surfactant system to be formulated without the need for mono- and di- ethanolamines or diethanolamides.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides an adjuvant composition for modifying the rheological properties of a surfactant system, wherein the adjuvant composition is substantially liquid at room temperature and includes a first surfactant comprising poly(C2-C4)alkylene glycol hydroxy (C2-C4) alkyl isostearamide and a second surfactant different than the first surfactant.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a method of thickening a surfactant system that includes at least one primary surfactant. The method includes the step of adding to the surfactant system an adjuvant composition that includes poly (C2-C4) alkylene glycol hydroxy (C2-C3)alkyl isostearamide, wherein the adjuvant composition is substantially a liquid at room temperature. The composition may also include a second surfactant.<br>
The present invention also provides a surfactant system that is the reaction product of a primary surfactant composition and an adjuvant surfactant composition that includes poly (C2-C4) alkylene glycol hydroxy ((C2-C4) alkyl isostearamide which is substantially a liquid at room temperature and modifies the rheological properties of the surfactant system. Again, in this surfactant system there is no need to have mono ethanolamines, diethanolamines, or diethanolamides present.<br>
In addition, the present invention provides a cleansing composition that includes a primary surfactant composition selected from amine oxides, sodium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl ether sulfate, 2-alkene sulfonate, 3-hydroxyalkene sulfonate, 4-hydroxyalkene sulfonate, secondary alkane sulfonates, cocoamidopropyl betaine, and combinations thereof; and an adjuvant surfactant coznposition to modify rheological properties that is substantially free of monoethanolamines, diethanolamines, and diethanolamides that includes an adjuvant composition that is<br>
substantially a liquid at room temperature comprising poly(C2-C4) alkylene glycol hydroxy (C2-C4) alkyl isostearainide and a second surfactant different than the isostearamide selected from the group consisting of polypropylene glycol hydroxyethyl caprylamide, polypropylene glycol hydroxyethyl cocamide, and combinations thereof.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
For purposes of the present invention, the term adjuvant is defined as an additive that modifies the properties of compositions. This includes additives that may modify the rheological properties of a composition, such as a surfactant system.<br>
The present invention provides surfactant adjuvant compositions to modify the rheological properties of a surfactant system without requiring added monoethanolanunes, diethanolamines, and diethanolamides. Desirably, the surfactant composition is an alkoxylated alkanolamide or combination of the different alkoxylated alkanolamides that may be added to a surfactant system at room temperature without heating and is compatible with a majority of surfactant systems.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to mixed (C2-C4) alkoxylated hydroxy (C2-C3) isostearamides as beneficial adjuvants in surfactant systems. Desirable (C2-C4) alkoxylated portion includes ethoxy, branched propoxy, branched butoxy and combinations thereof. Hydroxy (C2-C3)alkyl means hydroxyethyl, hydroxyisopropyl and combinations thereof; hydroxyethyl is preferred. Thus, the invention includes surfactant systems containing the isostearamide wherein the addition of the isostearamide adjuvant beneficially affects the surfactant systems properties particularly rheology, primarily viscosity but, if desired, also foam stability, foam boosting and solubilization. The surfactant system contains one or more surfactants, referred to as primary surfactants. Additionally, the adjuvant composition may include another surfactant(s) (other than the isostearamide) referred to as the secondary surfactant.<br>
The mixed alkoxylated monoalkanol isostearamide is substantially liquid at about room temperature. This is achieved by alkoxylating monoethanol isostearamide, monoisopropyl isostearamide or combinations thereof with a (C2-C4) alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butylene oxide and combinations thereof. However, when ethylene oxide is used, care is needed to avoid over alkoxylating to the point of causing<br>
crystallization. Preferably a mixture of ethylene and propylene oxides and more preferably propylene oxide. The amount of alkoxylation needs to be sufficient to result in the monoethanol- monoisopropyl- or mixed ethanol and isopropyl- isostearamide becoming substantially liquid at room temperatures. The alkoxylated hydroxyalkyl/isostearamide is the reaction product of isostearic acid and monoethanolamine or monoisopropanol followed by reaction in the presence of a suitable catalyst (for example, potassium hydroxide, sodium alcoholate) with at least about one mole of the alkylene oxide. At less than about a mole of alkylene oxide, the resultant product may not be liquid at room temperature.   Generally, from 1 to about 8 moles of alkylene oxide will be used. As a number of moles increases to about 4 and above the resultant hydroxyalkyl isostearamide will begin to act primarily as a solubilizer. For optimal theology benefits, the amount of alkoxylation will be from about 1 to 5, desirably 1 to 3.<br>
Typically the polyalkylene glycol hydroxyalkyl isostearamide reaction products are written with a subscript number following the alkylene glycol to denote the number of moles of polyalkylene glycol, such as polypropylene glycol1.5 hydroxyethyl isostearamide or PPG1.5 hydroxyethyl isostearamide, or for mixed systems, (PEG)m(PPG)n wherein PPG is polypropylene glycol and PEG is polyethylene glycol. The number of moles will be an average for the isostearamide compositions. The resultant adjuvant will be a mixture of compositions due to the source of the isostearic acid (being a mixture of isomers) and the nature of the alkoxylation process.<br>
The surfactant adjuvant compositions enable one to particularly modify the rheological properties of a surfactant system without the need to use monoethanolamines, diethanolamines, or diethanolarnides with the adjuvant.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to polypropylene glycol hydroxyethyl isostearamide, including polypropylene glycol (PPG) hydroxyethyl isostearamide compositions, methods of preparation, and methods of use. PPG hydroxyethyl isostearamide has been found to produce unexpected and exceptional qualities as a surfactant to modify the rheological properties of a surfactant system, especially with respect to the ability to increase the viscosity of a surfactant system. This result is accomplished without the addition of monoethanolamines, diethaholamines, and diethanolamides. PPG hydroxyethyl isoslearamide<br>
is the reaction product of isostearic acid and nionoethanolamine followed by at least about one mole of propoxylation.<br>
Another advantage of hydroxyethyl isostearamide adjuvants used in this invention is they are substantially liquid at room temperature. This allows for mixture into a surfactant system without an additional heating step and permits fragrances to be mixed with the isostearamide adjuvant prior to incorporation into a surfactant system. This is an example of the isostearamide adjuvant acting as a solubilizer. The fragrance may be any of a variety of fragrances known to be added. Desirably the isostearamide includes at least about one mole of PPG. The PPG hydroxyethyl isostearamide may be present in a larger percentage, up to or higher than about 20%, particularly when used as part of a detergent concentrate. For economic considerations, the alkoxy hydroxyalkyl isostearamide is desirably present in a small percentage of the surfactant system, desirably up to about 5% by weight of the surfactant system. The upper and lower amounts of the PPG hydroxyethyl isostearamide are governed by the ability of the surfactant system to achieve the desired effects. Generally, the PPG hydroxyethyl isostearamide is present in amounts as low as 0.1% by weight of the surfactant system. The PPG hydroxyethyl isostearamide is most desirably in the range of about 1% to about 3% by weight.<br>
Other beneficial effects of the isostearamide adjuvant include its affect on rheology which includes the ability to thicken a surfactant system. This adjuvant may also beneficially affect foam stabilization or boost the foaming properties of a surfactant system or lower the Krafft temperature.<br>
A large number of applications and final end products are contemplated by the present invention. Therefore, a variety of different surfactants may be used depending on the desired properties of the end product. Among the many products in which the surfactant systems of the present invention may be incorporated include, without limitation, skin care products such as soap, liquid hand cleansers, body washes, facial washes, lotions, moisturizers, sun screens, and make-up; hair care products such as shampoos, conditioners, hair dyes and colorants and hair gels; industrial cleaners, household cleaners as well as pre-moistened towels such as baby wipes and geriatric wipes.<br>
Therefore, the adjuvant composition may be incorporated in a wide variety of surfactant systems mat include one or more primary surfactants. Examples of surfactants that may be added to the primary surfactant system or to the adjuvant composition may include anionic, cationic, noriionic, amphoteric or zwitterionic surfactants as described in further detail below.<br>
Primary anionic surfactants include alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. These materials have the respective formulae ROSO3M and RO(C2H4O)x SO3M, wherein R is alkyl or alkenyl of from about 8 to about 30 carbon atoms, x is 1 to about 10, and M is hydrogen or a cation such as ammonium, alkanolammonium (e.g., triethanolammonium), a monovalent metal cation (e.g., sodium and potassium), or a polyvalent metal cation (e.g., magnesium and calcium). Desirably, M should be chosen such that the anionic surfactant component is water soluble. The anionic surfactant or surfactants should be chosen such that the Krafft temperature is about 15°C or less, preferably about 10°C or less, and more preferably about 0°or less.<br>
Krafft temperature refers to the point at which solubility of an ionic surfactant becomes determined by crystal lattice energy and heat of hydration, and corresponds to a point at which solubility undergoes a sharp, discontinuous increase with increasing temperature. Each type of surfactant will have its own characteristic Krafft temperature. Krafft temperature for ionic surfactants is, in general, well known and understood in the art. A visual indicator of when the Krafft point has been reached is when the solution becomes cloudy as temperature is lowered.<br>
In the alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates described above, desirably R has from about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms in both the alkyl and alkyl ether sulfates. The alkyl ether sulfates are typically made as condensation products of ethylene oxide and monohydric alcohols having from about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms. The alcohols can be derived from fats, e.g., coconut oil, palm oil, tallow, or the like, or the alcohols can be synthetic. Such alcohols are reacted with 1 to about 10, and especially about 3, molar proportions of ethylene oxide and the resulting mixture of molecular species having, for example, an average of 3 moles of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, is sulfated and neutralized.<br>
Specific examples of alkyl ether sulfates which can be used in the present invention are sodium and ammonium salts of coconut alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate; tallow alkyl triethylene glycol ether sulfate, and tallow alkyl hexaoxyethylene sulfate. Preferred alkyl ether sulfates are those comprising a mixture of individual compounds, said mixture having an average alkyl chain length of from about 12 to about 16 carbon atoms and an average degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to about 4 moles of ethylene oxide. Such a mixture also comprises from 0% to about 20% by weight of C12-13 compounds; from about 60% to about 100% by weight of C14-16 compounds, from 0% to about 20% by weight of C17-19 compounds; from about 3% to about 30% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of 0; from about 45% to about 90% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of from 1 to about 4; from about 10% to about 25% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation of from about 4 to about 8; and from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of compounds having a degree of ethoxylation greater than about 8.<br>
Other suitable anionic surfactants are the water-soluble salts of organic, sulfuric acid reaction products of the general formula [R1-SO3-M] where R1 is selected from the group consisting of a straight or branched chain, saturated aliphatic hydrocarbon radical having from about 8 to about 24, preferably about 10 to about 18, carbon atoms; and M is as previously described above in this section. Examples of such surfactants are the salts of an organic sulfuric acid reaction product of a hydrocarbon of the methane series, including iso-, neo-, and n-paraffins, having about 8 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably about 12 to about 18 carbon atoms and a sulfonating agent, e.g., SO2, H2SO4), obtained according to known sulfonation methods, including bleaching and hydrolysis.<br>
Still other suitable anionic surfactants are the reaction products of fatty acids esterified with isethionic acid and neutralized with sodium hydroxide where, for example, the fatty acids are derived from coconut or palm oil; or sodium or potassium salts of fatty acid amides of methyl tauride in which the fatty acids, for example, are derived from coconut oil.<br>

Other suitable anionic surfactants are those that<br>
are derived from amino acids. Nonlimiting examples of such surfactants include N-acyl-L-glutamate, N-acyl-N-methyl-p-alanate, N-acylsarcosinate, and their salts. As well as surfactants derived from taurine, which is also known as 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. An example of such an acid is N-acyl-N-methyl taurate.<br>
The adjuvants are particularly useful in thickening difficult-to-thicken branched anionic primary surfactants such as (C14-C16) alpha olefin sulfonates and secondary (C14-C16) alkane sulfonates. The adjuvant when used alone often is sufficient to thicken these surfactant systems.<br>
Olefin sulfonates having about 10 to about 24 carbon atoms may also be used and are a preferred primary surfactant of the present invention. The adjuvant compositions of the present invention worked particularly well with alpha olefin sulfonates despite the fact that they are usually difficult to thicken. The term "olefin sulfonates" is used herein to mean compounds which can be produced by the sulfonation of alpha-olefins by means of unconiplexed sulfur trioxide, followed by neutralization of the acid reaction mixture in conditions such mat any sulfones which have been formed in the reaction are hydrolyzed to give the corresponding hydroxy-alkanesulfonates. The sulfur trioxide can be liquid or gaseous, and is usually, but not necessarily, diluted by inert diluents, for example by liquid SO2, chlorinated hydrocarbons, etc., when used in the liquid form, or by air, nitrogen, gaseous SO2, etc., when used in the gaseous form. The alpha-olefins from which the olefin sulfonates are derived are mono-olefins having about 12 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably about 14 to about 16 carbon atoms.<br>
In addition to the true alkene sulfonates and a proportion of hydroxy-alkanesulfonates, the olefin sulfonates can contain minor amounts of other materials, such as alkene disulfonates depending upon the reaction conditions, proportion of reactants, the nature of the starting olefins and impurities in the olefin stock and side reactions during the sulfonation process.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
Examples 1-4 demonstrate a comparison of the viscosity building performance of compositions of the present invention with monoethanolamide compositions and other alkoxylated alkanolamides, by weight % on an active basis.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Surfactant systems were prepared including 17% by weight sodium laureth-2 sulfate (SLES-2) and 3% by weight of a variety of surfactant compositions A-D, as set forth below, at pH 6.5. The viscosities of the surfactant systems were tested at different salt (sodium chloride) concentrations as shown in TABLE I.<br>
TABLE I<br>
<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Compositions A-D are as follows:<br>
A)	PPG| hydroxyethyl isostearamide<br>
B)	cocomonoethanol amide (CMA)<br>
C)	PPG3 hydroxyethyl soyamide<br>
D)	PPG2 hydroxyethyl cocamide<br>
Inventive Composition A, PPG1 hydroxyethyl isostearamide clearly and surprisingly outperformed Comparative Composition B, cocomonoethanol amide (CMA), which is a monoethanolamide known to enhance viscosity building, but because it is not a liquid at room temperature, requires an additional heating step to incorporate it into a surfactant system. The isostearamide performance also far exceeded that of Comparative Compositions C and D the soyamide and the cocamide compositions, respectively.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
Surfactant systems were prepared including 7%, alpha olefin sulfonate (AOS) (which generally include 70% 2-(C14-C16) alkene sulfonate and 30% 3-(or 4) hydroxy (C14-C16) alkane sulfonate), 3% cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAB) and 2.5% by weight of a variety of<br>
surfactant compositions A-E, as set forth below. The viscosities of the surfactant systems were tested at different salt (sodium chloride) concentrations as shown in TABLE II.<br>

Alpha olefin sulfate (AOS) surfactant systems are relatively difficult to thicken. Inventive Composition A, the isostearamide composition, was alone found to work very well with AOS, and far exceeded the viscosity building performance of the other compositions. Inventive Composition C, the blended composition of the isostearamide and cocamide also outperformed Comparative Composition B, the cocamide alone. Similar results were found for these surfactant compositions when included in surfactant systems that included secondary C14-17 alkane sulfonates (SAS), which are also difficult to thicken.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Surfactant systems were prepared that included 7% by weight sodium lauryl ether sulfate, 3% cocoamidopropyl betaine, and 2.5% by weight of surfactant compositions A-E as set forth below. The viscosities of these surfactant systems were tested at different salt (sodium chloride) concentrations as shown in TABLE III.<br>

cocamide<br>
C)	Cocamide DEA<br>
D)	PPG3 hydroxyethyl soyamide<br>
Inventive Composition B, the blend of the isostearamide composition with the cocamide composition clearly outperformed in viscosity building properties Comparative Compositions A, C and D.<br>
In addition to the viscosity building performance of the isostearamide compositions and blends thereof, the isostearamide compositions were found to have excellent color stability. After one month at 60°C, the isostearamide systems maintained Gardner 1 color.<br>
EXAMPLE IV<br>
Surfactant systems were prepared using 7% by weight ammonium lauryl ether sulfate (ALES), 3% ammonium lauryl sulfate, And 2.5% of surfactant compositions A-E as set forth below. The viscosities of these surfactant systems were tested at different salt (sodium chloride) concentrations as shown in Table IV.<br>
