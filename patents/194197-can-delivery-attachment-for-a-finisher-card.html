				<td>The present invention relates to can delivery attachment for a finisher card<br>
Jute industry is more than 100 years old and has been playing a vital role in the economy of West Bengal and Bangladesh But the industry is facing high manufacturing costs mainly due to low productivity One major reason for this is the use of antiquated machinery with low productivity and as a result high cost of labour engaged In contrast, synthetic substitutes for packaging, bulk handling means etc have proved to be much cheaper and attractive<br>
Jute mills in Europe closed down on account of high labour costs As a result, the prospects of jute industry in India and Bangladesh brightened up But Indian jute mills found it difficult to meet the stringent quality requirements of European weavers with the existing machines To compensate for increase in labour costs, the mills resorted to cost-cutting measures which deteriorated machinery as well as quality Jute industry cannot afford to invest in new machinery<br>
Today the jute industry needs to increase productivity and quality with less expenditure on labour per ton of product and less expenditure on energy It also requires to acquire capability to cater to wider range of product and versatility of the emerging market The machinery and processes to be developed should be cost-effective and should not call for heavy investments<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
The existing system, which was designed many years ago to suit mainly the processing requirement of yarn for weaving of fabric for packaging purposes, is finisher card fitted with Roll former This system has a single roll former which delivers jute sliver rolls, fitted to each finisher card This system is not adequate in today's context due to<br>
a) critical quality requirement of sale yarn in export market<br>
b) advent of very high speed automatic looms which need very<br>
high quality yarn ,<br>
c) effort to take jute yarn in household textiles , and<br>
d)	cost reduction<br>
In the existing system sliver is delivered at higher weight per unit length, the fibres are laid at random/very irregular fashion and the package which is in Rolls contains small length and is extremely compact If the delivery sliver weight is made light the output of the card is reduced For L Y processing, the material from this system has to be processed through 3-drawmg passages Also, the quality of sliver is not adequate for export yarn It is not advisable to increase the speed of the existing system, i e Finisher Cards, since it will cause damage to the fibre In fact, for export yarn processing it is recommended that the speed is brought down to reduce breakage of fibres So the industry needs<br>
a) Some device to increase card output without increasing<br>
card speed and risking maintenance, fibre breakage etc<br>
b) Large package i e , long length delivery<br>
- 3 -<br><br>
c) Sliver from finisher card in loosely/layed/packed form<br>
d) Half or less sliver weight from card then existing R F<br>
system<br>
e) Improved regularity and fibre parallehsation<br>
f) Process elimination<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide a Can<br>
Delivery Attachment for a Finisher Card to enable higher<br>
productivity without the need for heavy investments and at the<br>
same time assuring better quality of the product With the<br>
attachment of the present invention, the machine can<br>
deliver, at much higher rate, an improved quality output with<br>
reduction in costs of labour, power and maintenance<br>
The present invention envisages -<br>
(a) increase in productivity/throughput ,<br>
(b) increase in package ,<br>
(c) improvement in quality ,<br>
(d) reduction in power used ,<br>
(e) minimizing wastage ,<br>
(f) providing for a wider counter range ,<br>
(g) reduction in labour cost,<br>
(h) reduction in fatigue of labour , (i) reduction in costs , and (j ) elimination of a process<br>
The present invention provides a Can Delivery Attachment in modular form so that it can be attached to an existing finisher card for delivery of fleece or sliver<br>
- 4 -<br><br>
The present invention provides a Can Delivery Attachment for a finisher card comprising a twin-or four-mouthed conductor for receiving sliver/fleece from a doffer or a drawing roller of a finisher card and dividing the fleece into two or four streams, one set of pressing rollers, sliver diversion guide and side delivery roller of respective side or front delivery roller and diversion guide for each stream for passing the fleece therethrough ,<br>
an intersecting pin drum roller arrangement in a primary drafting zone for primary drafting of sliver or fleece received from a respective said set and a lattice pin intersector for final or secondary drafting in a secondary drafting zone ,<br>
said intersecting pin drum roller arrangement of said primary drafting zone comprising, a retaining roller, a drawing roller, a drafting roller with pins, two or more gilling rollers with pins in intersecting position with the pins of the drafting roller and a delivery roller so that sliver from the retaining roller passes through the drafting roller and the intersecting gilling rollers and is drawn out by the drawing roller to enter the secondary zone through delivery roller of the primary zone, the tips of the pins of the drafting roller and the tips of opposing pins of the gilling roller going past each other and maintaining a set gap from the metal surface/outside diameter of the drafting and gilling rollers, for imparting better control of fibers by intersecting means ,<br>
- 5 -<br><br>
said lattice pin intersector of said secondary drafting zone comprising pinned laths fixed on two moving chain belts facing each other and rotating in opposite directions, each said pinned lath having pins fixed thereon at a desired angle in a suitable pattern to intersect between the two chain belts ,<br>
a crimping box at the downstream end of the secondary drafting zone for receiving sliver therefrom and packing in sliver cans<br>
The fleece after passing through said respective set of pressing roller, diversion guide and side delivery system, can be passed through a feed auto-levehng unit to a delivery roller from which the sliver is passed on to said drafting roller of the primary drafting zone In this case, it is preferable to provide a collection box downstream of the delivery pressing roller of the finisher card for receiving the sliver from the finisher card and supplying it to the auto-leveling unit<br>
The rollers in the primary drafting zone are preferably light-metal drums with steel pins fitted thereon The drums may be of the breast-plate type provided with intersecting pin control<br>
The invention will be more fully described with reference to preferred embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein<br>

Figs 7 and 8 show side view and plan view of the secondary drafting zone of Fig 5 , and<br>
Fig 9 shows a block diagram of auto-leveler arrangement<br>
In Fig 1 is shown a finisher card at the centre with two can delivery attachment modules on its left side and right side The combination will hereinafter be described with reference to Figs 2-4<br>
Finisher card A has a main roller 101 (Fig 4) provided with projecting pins Around it are arranged a plurality of rollers 102 having pins projecting therefrom These pins are set at a distance so that there is always a gap between the tips of the pins of the main roller 101 also called cylinder, and the tips of the pins of other rollers arranged around it (see Fig 4) The jute S from a roller P passes between the main roller 101 and the rollers 102 and goes as a sliver/fleece U onto a finisher card doffer roll C, via another doffer roller V and drawing roller B From there,<br>
- 7 -<br><br>
the fleece is fed to a twin-mouth conductor W (Fig 2) From the conductor W, tile fleece exits in two or four streams-one or two to the left and the other(s) to the right (Fig 2) Each stream is passed through a set comprising a pressure roller D having two or four bosses, sliver diverter E1 and a side delivery system X The fleece from each set passes over a missing sliver/stop motion feeler F and a diversion guide E2 and then through a monitoring/measuring roller length vanator and a control roller (not shown) The control roller is coupled to a quick response circuit of an auto-leveler G<br>
Sliver S from the finisher card delivery pressing roller D is led to a collection box 15 and then enters the auto-leveler G through lift-up roller 6, fulcrumed floating roller 16 and fixed roller 7 as can be seen from Fig 9 The fulcrum roller 16 moves up or down in keeping with the variation of the mass/volume of the sliver and the deviation is magnified by an enlarger 19 the input arm 17 of which is in constant touch with fulcrum roller 16 The sliver then passes between the sliver input roller 9 and sliver input pressing roller 8, breast plate 10,12, variable drafting plate 11, output roller 14 and output pressing roller 13 Sliver input roller 9 is driven by a variable speed motor 18 which receives signal of variation required through the variable speed control 23 and accordingly the speed of input roller increases or decreases with the heavy or light sliver sensed by the fulcrum roller 16 A fulcrum lever 19A is<br>
- 8 -<br><br>
fulcrumed on fulcrum roller 16 at one end and at its other end, a weight (21) is suspended by a wire rope (20) The output roller 14 is set to run at a certain fixed speed The variable draft control plate 11 moves up and down as per the magnified movement of the enlarger box output arm (22) If the input sliver from card is heavy (thick mass), the input roller 9 will slow down allowing more draft i e , increasing the ratio of speed between input roller 9 and output roller 14 When the input sliver is light (thin mass) the input roller 9 will speed up reducing the ratio i e , draft Thus, the weight per unit length of sliver at let off box 24 will always be same i e , leveled automatically<br>
This is a means to ensure level feeding of input sliver to the gilling area i e , feeding of pre-levelled sliver to the gill for attenuation and further drafting in order to get uniform resultant sliver The sliver then enters the primary drafting zone H of the respective can delivery module<br>
At the entry to primary drafting zone H, the sliver passes between two retaining rollers 103, 104 (Fig 5) and then onto a pinned drum 105 The pins are angled at a suitable angle to the surface of the drum, depending on the type of finishing required The drum is preferably of light metal and the pins are made of steel Pinned rollers 106-109 are provided on the outer periphery of the drum and each is provided with pins projecting therefrom and these are arranged in such away that the tips of the pins of main (drafting) roller and the tips of the opposing pins of the<br>
- 9 -<br><br>
other (grlling) rollers go past each other and remain at a set distance from the root of the opposing pins Drum 105 and gillmg rollers 106-109 rotate in opposite directions so that when the sliver passes between the drum 105 and the rollers 106-109 the sliver is imparted with drafting and attenuation Besides intersecting control, the drum also gives breast plate type drafting The sliver then passes between a drawing-pressing roller 110 and a drawing roller 113 and then between a primary zone delivery pressing roller 112 and a primary zone delivery roller 113 to exit from the primary drafting zone<br>
From the nip of the rollers 112 and 113, the sliver enters the secondary or final drafting zone I (Figs 4 and 7) In zone I, the sliver passes between a pair of chain beits 115, 116 The top chain belt 115 runs around driving sprockets 117, 118, 119 so that the belt is endless Similarly, the bottom chain belt runs around driving sprockets 120, 121 and<br>
122 Each belt has pinned laths 123 with projecting gill pins<br>
124 The gill pins 124 of the two chain belts 115 and 116 face<br>
each other The belts rotate in opposite directions and their<br>
speeds of rotation are adjusted to be in relation to the rotation<br>
speed of the primary zone drawing rollers 110, 111 and the<br>
secondary zone delivery rollers 125, 126 The pinned laths<br>
123 constitute pinned laths or strips of composite material or<br>
nylon bars The gill pins 124 are fixed on the pinned laths 123<br>
at a desired angle in a suitable pattern with desired projections,<br>
so that pins 124 intersect between the two chain belts<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
115, 116 When the sliver from the primary drafting zone H enters the secondary drafting zone I, the laths 123 parallelise and even out the fibres by the action of the pins on the sliver This action helps reducing the drawing process so that the system is shortened<br>
An electronic control and counter R (Fig 4) is connected at the exit of delivery rollers 125, 126 of each can delivery unit The sliver exiting from rollers 125, 126 enters a crimping box Z and then passes through a sliver switching chute J The counter R displays the number of cans doffed From the chute, the sliver passes onto sliver can L A sliver cutter K is provided adjacent the chute J for cutting the sliver<br>
Each module has two cans L so that one is readily available as a spare can The sliver exiting from crimping box Z is collected in 24" x 40" sliver cans with high density packing When the can is full, the sliver is automatically switched in accordance with predetermined set in counter R to a reserve can of the respective module and the sliver is automatically cut off by cutter K<br>
A counter shaft T connects the can delivery units to the finisher card for driving the units However, a separate drive may be provided for the units<br>
It must be understood that, instead of two can delivery units, only one can delivery unit can be used In this case, the unit is provided on either side or<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
in front of the finisher card In that case the slivers coming out of the twin-mouth conductor W are directed to the same can delivery unit in the same manner as earlier described<br>
Following are some of the advantages, of the present invention<br>
a) Increased doubling in the drawing system<br>
(Twice that of the existing)<br>
b) Increased card out-put (20 % to 30 %)<br>
c) Slower card delivery speed without sacrificing production<br>
(If required for better fibre length) (8 % to 12 1 %)<br>
d)	Reduction in line waste of 8 %<br>
e)	Cutting-down splicing splicing (By 4 times i e splicing after<br>
approximately 72 minutes against approximately 12 minutes at<br>
present)<br>
f)	Cutting-down line waste (To 1/8th by the elimination of roll<br>
former which produces waste in every roll)<br>
g)	Better penetration and no floating of sliver in first passage<br>
(Opengill) drawing<br>
h) Improved performance and life of carriage components of<br>
first passage drawing<br>
i) Better retention of moisture<br>
j) Elimination of extra short fibre (0 5" to 1 5" group 1 5% to<br>
3% of total)<br>
k) Sandwitchtng for top blending (When blending synthetic<br>
top)<br>
I) No peeling/false drafting which is associated with Roll feed<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
m) Longer drafting in first passage drawing (Depending on<br>
sliver weight)<br>
n) Low maintenance (Absence of faller members)<br>
o) Two dissimilar batches of fibres can be processed<br>
simultaneously in the same finisher card<br>
p) Regularity improvement (Around 50% over the existing<br>
system)<br>
q) Elimination of first drawing in general and particularly<br>
where Push-Bar Drafting Frames are still in use<br>

The nearest prior art is the Drawhead employing Push Bar or Screwgill or even intersecting screwgillor intersecting chain gill mechanism While the Push Bar Drawheads had serious limitations and drawbacks and were never reckoned as a means of upgrading/improving the production and quality, the Screwgill version also failed to inspire the industry because of limited applications and advantages it offered compared to a freestanding (not attachment) Monohead Screwgill Drawing and the machinery manufacturer pushed forward the Monohead instead of the Drawhead The Intersecting Drawheads which are more recent did not find favour with the jute industry because of limited application areas, sophistication, prohibitive cost, upkeep and maintenance hassle, and above all low utilization/viability limited by the output of the Finisher it is attached to Moreover, these were made for the wool and synthetic fibre industry to be adopted for bast fibre like jute<br>
The preset invention, on the other hand is different and of new concept than the prior art because<br>
1 It employs different mechanism than the prior art Two<br>
independent modules can be attached to a Finisher Card (or any<br>
first passage card like Breaker Card) , alternatively one single<br>
unit can be attached to a Finisher Card for improving both quality<br>
and quantity of the card<br>
2 It can be used in both heavy yarn and light yarn processing<br>
including fine (export) yarn<br>
- 14 -<br><br>
3 It has two intersecting drafting zones in each unit/<br>
attachment A primary drafting zone of intersecting pin Gill roller<br>
drafting and a secondary zone of intersecting Lattice Gill drafting<br>
mechanism Two separate and different types of drafting systems,<br>
one located just in front of the other, in one head of a machine<br>
used for processing/drawing jute sliver is a unique concept not<br>
known hitherto<br>
4 The primary intersecting pin Gill roller drafting is a<br>
completely new idea and concept<br>
5 The secondary intersecting Lattice gill drafting is also a<br>
new idea and concept Unlike any prior art it has pinned short<br>
synthetic bodies (strips) on triples driving chains, no precision<br>
made specialty steel moving fa Her bars, no steel tracks, no<br>
special material runners which are subject to high abrasion<br>
calling for high degree of maintenance and replacement are<br>
needed In fact, the end users (mills) can make the parts of Two<br>
Zone Attachments themselves without needing specialized supply<br>
source and costly inventory<br>
6. The introduction of this equipment will enable the user (jute textile manufacturing units usually called Mills) to shorten the existing process line In other words, by attaching this new equipment the mills can eliminate the First drawing of their existing 3-drawing system comprised of First drawing, Second Drawing and Third or Finisher Drawing Obviously, this shortening will result in a number of savings and advantages which are the crying need of the industry and thus form the focal point of the development<br>
