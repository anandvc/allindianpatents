				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system, and in<br>
particular, to a device and method for performing handoff in a mobile<br>
communication system.<br>
2. Description of the Related Art<br>
In a mobile communication system, there are several handoff methods for<br>
maintaining a call when a terminal (or mobile station) moves from a present cell (or<br>
base station) area to an adjacent cell area. One is a soft handoff method and another<br>
is a hard handoff method. In the soft handoff, the terminal communicates by using<br>
a channel allocated from a handoff target base station to which the terminal is to be<br>
handed off as well as a channel allocated from the present base station which<br>
presently services the terminal, and then disconnects one of the channels, whose<br>
channel quality is lower than a threshold value. In the hard handoff, when a call<br>
quality is lower than a threshold level, the terminal first disconnects the channel<br>
allocated from the present base station and then attempts to connect with the<br>
adjacent base station. Furthermore, there is another handoff method in which upon<br>
receipt of a handoff request message, the base station transmits data for an interval<br>
shorter than a predetermined interval by increasing a data rate based on an<br>
engagement made between the base station and the terminal, and the terminal then<br>
receives the data for the above short interval and searches for an adjacent base<br>
station for the remaining interval. This handoff method is illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
FIG. 1 shows a state where a terminal moves from a present base station<br>
BS#0 to an adjacent base station BS#1 (i.e., handoff target base station BS#1 to<br>
which the terminal is to be handed off). In this situation, the terminal perceives that<br>
the strength of a signal received from the present base statio BS#0 is getting lower,<br>
while the strength of a signal received from the adjacent base station BS# 1 is getting<br>
higher. In the meantime, when the strength of the signal received from the base<br>
station BS#0 is lower than a threshold level, the terminal transmits a handoff request<br>
message or a detected signal strength value to the current base station BS#0, and the<br>
base station BS#0 then divides a transmission frame cycle into a transmission<br>
interval Ton and a non-transmission interval Toff to transmits the entire frame data<br>
for a transmission interval Ton. Then, the terminal receives the signal from the base<br>
station BS#0 for the transmission interval Ton and receives the signal received from<br>
the adjacent base station BS#1 for the non-transmission interval Toff, thereby to<br>
perform handoff.<br>
The technical terminologies used in the specification will be defined<br>
hereinbelow. A term "mode 0" (e.g., a base station transmission mode 0 or a<br>
terminal reception mode 0) refers to a mode in which the base station normally<br>
transmits the data for the entire frame cycle and the terminal receives the<br>
transmitted data correspondingly. A term "mode 1" (e.g., a base station<br>
transmission mode 1 or a terminal reception mode 1) refers to a mode in which the<br>
base station transmits the entire data for a predetermined interval of the frame cycle<br>
and the terminal receives the transmitted data for the corresponding interval (i.e.,<br>
the above predetermined interval). A term "mode 2" (e.g., a base station<br>
transmission mode 2 or a terminal reception mode 2) refers to a mode in which the<br>
base station does not transmit the data for a predetermined interval of the frame<br>
cycle and the terminal searches for an adjacent base station for the predetermined<br>
interval. Here, a guard time required in switching from the mode 1 to the mode 2<br>
is represented by "a", and a guard time required in switching from the mode 2 to<br>
the mode 1 or mode 0 is represented by "b". Moreover, in dividing the frame cycle,<br>
reference character Dl denotes a leading interval of the frame and reference<br>
character D2 denotes a following interval of the frame. Besides, reference character<br>
Ton denotes a data transmission interval for which the base station transmits the<br>
data to the terminal, and reference character Toff denotes a data non-transmission<br>
interval for which the base station stops transmission of the data to the terminal.<br>
Further, a term "first frame" refers to a frame transmitted primarily from the base<br>
station to the terminal at the handoff request, and a term "second frame" refers to<br>
a frame transmitted from the base station to the terminal in succession to the first<br>
frame.<br>
Now, reference will be made to a conventional handoff method with<br>
reference to FIGs. 2 and 3.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating the relationship between the frame cycles and<br>
the base station transmission powers (or the terminal reception powers) during<br>
handoff in a conventional mobile communication system. In FIG. 2, reference<br>
character T denotes one frame cycle, reference character "a" denotes a guard time<br>
required in switching from the base station transmission mode 1 (or terminal<br>
reception mode 1) to the base station transmission mode 2 (or terminal reception<br>
mode 2, reference character "b" denotes a guard time required in switching from<br>
the base station transmission mode 2 (or terminal reception mode 2) to the base<br>
station transmission mode 1 (or terminal reception mode 1), and reference character<br>
"S" (i.e., S/2+S/2) denotes an actual search time for which the terminal searches for<br>
the adjacent base station over two frame cycles 2T. In FIG. 2, the time S can be<br>
expressed by S=2x(Toff-a-b)=2Toff-2a-2b. As illustrated, in the conventional<br>
handoff method, the base station transmits the data for the transmission interval<br>
Ton=T/2 out of one frame cycle and stops transmission of the data for the non-<br>
transmission interval Toff=T/2.<br>
When the base station transmits the data as shown in FIG. 2 in a handoff<br>
mode, the terminal performs handoff according to the procedure shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, the terminal receives and processes the frame data<br>
transmitted normally from the base station in step 310. In this state, the terminal<br>
transmits a handoff request message to the base station, if it is judged that the<br>
handoff is required, for example, due to the reduced strength of the signal received<br>
from the base station. The base station then informs the terminal of the handoff,<br>
successively transmits the data at a double data rate for the leading half cycle 172<br>
of the frame cycle T, and stops transmitting the data for the following half cycle<br>
T/2. Then, the terminal senses in step 312 that the handoff is initiated, and receives<br>
the data of double data rate for the leading half cycle T/2 of the frame cycle T in<br>
step 314. The relation between the leading half cycle T/2, for which the terminal<br>
receives the data, and the base station transmission power is represented by<br>
reference numeral 200 in FIG. 2. Thereafter, the terminal searches in step 316 for<br>
the adjacent base station, to which the terminal is to be handed off, for the following<br>
half cycle T/2. Actually, however, the terminal does not search for the adjacent base<br>
station for the whole remaining half cycle T/2, but for the time obtained by<br>
subtracting a guard time "a" and a guard time "b" from the following half cycle<br>
T/2, wherein the guard time "a" is a time required in switching from the base state<br>
transmission mode 1 (or terminal reception mode 1) to the base station transmission<br>
mode 2 (or the terminal reception mode 2) and the guard time "b" is a time required<br>
in switching from the base station transmission mode 2 (or terminal reception mode<br>
2) to the base station transmission mode 1 (or terminal reception mode 1).<br>
Accordingly, the actual time for which the base station searches for the adjacent<br>
base station is S/2=T/2-a-b. The relation between the actual search cycle and the<br>
base station transmission power is represented by reference numeral 210 m FIG. 2.<br>
In the meantime, the cellular terminal judges in step 318 whether the adjacent<br>
base station is detected (i.e., whether a signal is detected from the adjacent base<br>
station). When the signal is detected from the adjacent base station, the cellular<br>
terminal is handed off to the adjacent base station in step 320. After completion of<br>
the handoff, the terminal returns to step 310 and continues to normally receive the<br>
data. However, upon failure to detect the signal transmitted from the adjacent base<br>
station in step 318, the terminal returns to step 314 to receive the data for the<br>
following half cycle T/2 of the next frame cycle. Here, the relations between the<br>
respective half cycles for the next frame and the transmission powers are<br>
represented by reference numerals 220 and 230 in FIG. 2.<br>
As stated above, although a theoretical time available for the adjacent base<br>
station search is 2Toff, the actual time S available for the adjacent base station<br>
search is S=2Toff-2a-2b. That is to say, as can be appreciated from FIG. 2, the<br>
reception mode 2 follows the reception mode 1 with a time delay "a", and the<br>
reception mode 1 or 0 also follows the reception mode 2 with a time delay "b",<br>
thereby reducing the actual search time by the guard time required in switching the<br>
modes.<br>
That is, in the conventional handoff method, operations of transmitting the<br>
data and searching for the adjacent base station are repeated until the adjacent base<br>
station to which the terminal is to be handed off is detected, which wastes the guard<br>
time required in switching the transmission/reception modes. The waste of the guard<br>
time will reduce the actual search time for which the terminal searches for the<br>
adjacent base station. Furthermore, the frequency mode switching overloads both<br>
the base station and the terminal.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a handoff device<br>
and method capable of effectively allocating a transmission interval and a non-<br>
transmission interval of a transmission frame at the handoff request, to increase an<br>
actual search time for which a terminal searches for an adjacent base station.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a handoff device and<br>
method capable of effectively allocating a transmission interval and a non-<br>
transmission interval of a transmission frame at the handoff request, to prevent the<br>
waste of a guard time due to the frequency mode switching.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a handoff device<br>
and method capable of effectively allocating a transmission interval and a non-<br>
transmission interval of a transmission frame at the handoff request, to reduce an<br>
overload due to the frequent mode switching.<br>
It is further another object of the present invention to provide a handoff<br>
device and method got variably allocating a transmission interval and a non-<br>
transmission interval of a transmission frame at the handoff request.<br>
To achieve the above object, there is provided a mobile communication<br>
system transmitting data in frame unit, including a base station apparatus and a<br>
terminal apparatus. The transmitter comprises a controller having consecutive first<br>
and second frames each divided into a first interval and a second interval following<br>
the first interval. In a handoff mode, the controller transmits respective frame data<br>
in the first interval of the first frame and the second interval of the second frame and<br>
stops transmission of the data in the second interval of the first frame and the first<br>
interval of the second frame. Further, the terminal apparatus comprises a receiver<br>
for processing received data, a handoff determiner for determining a handoff target<br>
base station by analyzing a strength of the received signal, and a controller applying<br>
to the receiver a signal transmitted from a present base station in the first interval<br>
of the first frame and the second interval of the second frame and applying to the<br>
handoff determiner signals transmitted from other base stations in the second<br>
interval of the first frame and the first interval of the second frame.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will be described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following<br>
description, well known functions or constructions are not described in detail since<br>
they would obscure the invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
In a mobile communication system according to the present invention, a base<br>
station apparatus has consecutive first and second frames each divided into a first<br>
interval and a second interval following the first interval, transmits frame data in the<br>
first interval of the first frame and the second interval of the second frame, and<br>
stops transmission of the frame data in the second interval of the first frame and the<br>
first interval of the second frame. Further, a terminal apparatus receives and<br>
processes the transmitted frame data in the first interval of the first frame and the<br>
second interval of the second frame, and receives signals from other base stations<br>
in the second interval of the first frame and the first interval of the second frame,<br>
to search for a handoff target base state to which the terminal is to be handed off.<br>
That is, the first interval of the first frame and the second interval of the<br>
second frame are data transmission intervals, and the second interval of the first<br>
frame and the first interval of the second frame are data non-transmission intervals.<br>
Furthermore, the first and second intervals for which communication parameters are<br>
interchanged between the base station and the terminal, can be controlled variably.<br>
In the following description, it is assumed that the first and second intervals each<br>
are a half cycle of one frame cycle. Besides, the first interval refers to a leading<br>
interval and the second interval refers to a following interval.<br>
In addition, a term "handoff mode" refers to a mode where the terminal<br>
searches for the handoff target base station and is then handed off to the searched<br>
target base station, at a handoff request from the base station or the terminal itself.<br>
A term "normal mode" refers to a mode where the base station normally transmits<br>
the data for the entire frame cycle.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates the relationships between frame cycles and base station<br>
transmission powers (or terminal reception powers) in a mobile communication<br>
system according to an embodiment of the present invention. In FIG. 4, reference<br>
characters T", "S", "a" and "b" are identical to those used in FIG. 2. In the<br>
handoff method according to the present invention, when the mobile communication<br>
system fails to end the handoff procedure in the following non-transmission interval<br>
of the first frame, it continues to perform the handoff procedure in the leading<br>
interval of the succeeding second frame, instead of transmitting the data. Therefore,<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 4, the actual search time available for the adjacent base station<br>
search is S=2Toff-a-b.<br>
Therefore, in the novel handoff method, at the handoff request, the cellular<br>
terminal receives the data for the leading half cycle of one frame and then primarily<br>
searches for the adjacent base station for the following half cycle from which the<br>
necessary guard time "a" is subtracted. When the cellular terminal fails to search<br>
for the adjacent base station in the primary search, it continues to secondarily search<br>
for the adjacent base station for the leading half cycle of the next frame, from which<br>
the necessary guard time "b" is subtracted.<br>
The handoff method of the cellular terminal includes the steps of:<br>
determining whether the handoff request is made or not; receiving the data for the<br>
leading half cycle of one frame in response to the handoff request; switching a mode<br>
for a first guard time, after completion of the data reception; searching for an<br>
adjacent base station for the following half cycle of a first frame from which the<br>
first guard time is subtracted and the leading half cycle of a second frame from<br>
which a second guard time is subtracted; and switching the mode for the second<br>
guard time and receiving the data, after searching for the adjacent base station.<br>
In the embodiment, the data transmission interval Ton and the data non-<br>
transmission interval Toff of the base station shall not be limited to the half cycle<br>
of the frame, rather, they may be variable.<br>
FIGs. 5 and 6 illustrate a handoff scheme for the base station and a handoff<br>
scheme for the terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention,<br>
respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a channel encoder 511 encodes input data into symbol<br>
data at a coding rate R=Rc. An interleaver 512 interleaves the symbol data output<br>
from the channel encoder 511. A rate converter 513 converts (or increases) a data<br>
rate of the symbol data output from the interleaver 512 by T/Ton times. A first<br>
amplifier 514 amplifies the symbol data output from the interleaver 512 with a<br>
specific gam, and a second amplifier 515 amplifies the symbol data output from the<br>
rate converter 513 with a specific gain. Here, the symbol data input to the first<br>
amplifier 514 is the normal frame data for the mode 0, and the symbol data input<br>
to the second amplifier 515 is the rate converted frame data for handoff.<br>
Accordingly, in order to compensate for a bit error rate (BER) which increases with<br>
the data rate, the gain of the second amplifier 515 is set higher than that of the first<br>
amplifier 514, in proportion to the converted data rate.<br>
A first switch 516 is switched to the first amplifier 514 in a normal mode and<br>
to the second amplifier 515 in a handoff mode, under the control of a undepicted<br>
controller. That is, the first switch 516 transfers an output of the first amplifier 514<br>
to a second switch 517 in the normal mode and an output of the second amplifier<br>
515 to the second switch 517 in the handoff mode. The second switch 517 is turned<br>
on (or closed) in the normal operation mode. However, in the handoff mode, the<br>
second switch 517 is turned on in the transmission interval and turned off (or<br>
opened) in the non-transmission interval. That is, under the control of the<br>
undepicted controller, the second switch 517 switches between the transmission<br>
interval and the non-transmission interval of the frame, during data transmission in<br>
the handoff mode, and is turned on only in the transmission interval to transfer the<br>
data from the first switch 516 to a modulator 518. The modulator 518 modulates the<br>
data from the second switch 517 by using a earner wave fO of the base station itself,<br>
generated from an oscillator 519, and radiates the modulated signal through a<br>
undepicted antenna.<br>
Here, the undepicted controller and the first switch 516 and the second<br>
switch 517 correspond to a controller for controlling a transmission operation of the<br>
base station.<br>
In the case that the mobile communication system is a CDMA (Code<br>
Division Multiple Access) communication system, a transmitter in the base station<br>
apparatus is composed of the channel encoder 511, the interleaver 512, the rate<br>
converter 513, the amplifier 515, and the modulator 518. Here, the rate converter<br>
513 may include orthogonal modulation and PN (Pseudo Noise) sequence<br>
spreading, and the amplifier 515 may be a gain controller. Further, the undepicted<br>
controller controls the rate converter 513 and the amplifier 515, in the handoff<br>
mode. That is, in the handoff mode, the controller uses a fast data transmission<br>
clock by controlling the rate converter 513, and controls the orthogonal modulation<br>
by using orthogonal codes of short length. In addition, the controller increases the<br>
gain of the amplifier 515 in the data transmission interval (i.e., the first interval of<br>
the first frame and the second interval of the second frame) to provide a<br>
transmission power higher than that in the normal mode, and disables the amplifier<br>
515 in the data non-transmission interval (i.e., the second interval of the first frame<br>
and the first interval of the second frame).<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 6, a mixer (or demodulator) 612 demodulates a signal<br>
received via a undepicted antenna by using a carrier wave f0 or fi (where i?0) of a<br>
corresponding base station, generated from an oscillator 611. Specifically, when the<br>
signal is received from the present base station, the mixer 612 demodulates the<br>
received signal using the carrier wave fO, and when the signal is received from the<br>
adjacent base station, the mixer 612 demodulates the received signal using the<br>
carner wave fi for the adjacent base station. A third switch 613 switches an output<br>
signal of the mixer 612 to a fourth switch 614 in a data reception interval Ton (or<br>
data transmission interval in the base station) and to a signal strength measuring part<br>
615 in a data non-reception interval Toff (or non-transmission interval in the base<br>
station). The signal strength measuring part 615 detects the strength of the signal<br>
received from the adjacent base station in the non-transmission interval Toff. A<br>
handoff determiner 616 determines whether to perform the handoff operation<br>
depending upon the detected signal strength value of the adjacent base station,<br>
output from the signal strength measuring part 615. The fourth switch 614 switches<br>
to the mode 0 or the mode 1. Specifically, the fourth switch 614 switches the data<br>
received from the third switch 613 to a deinterleaver 618 in a normal data reception<br>
mode (i.e., mode 0) and to a rate deconverter 617 in a data reception mode (i.e.,<br>
mode 1) for handoff. Here, the data switched to the deinterleaver 618 has a normal<br>
data rate and the data switched to the rate deconverter 617 has a data rate higher<br>
than that of the original data. The rate deconverter 617 deconverts the data rate of<br>
the received data from the fourth switch 614 to the original data rate. The<br>
deinterleaver 618 deinterleaves the data received from the fourth switch 614 and the<br>
rate deconverted data received from the rate deconverter 617. A channel decoder<br>
619 decodes an output of the deinterleaver 618 at a decoding rate R=Rc.<br>
In the case that the terminal apparatus of FIG. 6 is a CDMA terminal<br>
apparatus, a receiver in the terminal apparatus is composed of the demodulator 612,<br>
the switch 613, the rate deconverter 617, the deinterleaver 618, the channel decoder<br>
619, the signal strength measuring part 615 and the handoff determiner 616. The<br>
undepicted controller in the terminal controls the rate deconverter 617 and the<br>
switch 613. Here, the rate deconverter 617 may include orthogonal modulation and<br>
PN sequence spreading. Further, the undepicted controller controls the switch 613<br>
in the handoff mode to connect the output of the demodulator 612 to the rate<br>
deconverter 617 in the data transmission interval (i.e., the first interval of the first<br>
frame and the second interval of the second frame) and to the signal strength<br>
measuring part 615 in the data non-transmission interval (i.e., the second interval<br>
of the first frame and the first interval of the second frame). The rate deconverter<br>
617 orthogonally despreads the data from the demodulator 612 by using the fast<br>
clock and the short orthogonal codes which are used in the base station apparatus,<br>
and stores the despread data in the deinterleaver 618. By reading the data stored in<br>
the deinterleaver 618 in frame unit, it is possible, to obtain the data deconverted to<br>
the original data rate.<br>
FIG. 7 is a flowchart illustrating a handoff procedure between the base<br>
station and the terminal according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, the base station transmits the data for the whole frame cycle T<br>
in step 711, and the terminal receives the transmitted data for the whole frame cycle<br>
T in step 713. This operation corresponds to the mode 0 in which Ton=T and<br>
Toff=0. In step 715, the terminal measures the signal strength of the present base<br>
station and informs the base station of the detected signal strength value when it is<br>
lower than a threshold level. Based on the detected signal strength value, the base<br>
station judges in step 717 whether to perform the handoff. When it is not necessary<br>
to perform the handoff, the base station returns to step 711 and continues to transmit<br>
the data in the mode 0.<br>
However, if it is necessary to perform the handoff, the base station proceeds<br>
to step 719 to transmit the handoff parameters of Ton=Tl, Toff=T2 and T1+T2=T.<br>
The terminal then receives the handoff parameters in step 721 and transmits an<br>
acknowledge signal ACK. The base station checks in step 723 whether the<br>
acknowledge signal ACK is received from the terminal. When the acknowledge<br>
signal ACK is not received for a predetermined time, the base station returns to step<br>
719 to transmit again the handoff parameters.<br>
However, when the acknowledge signal ACK is received in step 723, the<br>
base station goes to step 725 to transmit the frame data, whose data rate is increased<br>
by T/Ton times, for the Ton time in the leading interval D1 [0, Ton) of the frame<br>
and, the terminal receives the frame data in the leading interval Dl of the first frame<br>
in step 727. The relation between the data transmission interval Ton and the base<br>
station transmission power (or terminal reception power) is represented by reference<br>
numeral 400 in FIG. 4, in which the transmission power is, as illustrated, increased<br>
by T/Ton times as compared with the case where the data is normally transmitted.<br>
Subsequently, the terminal measures the signal strength of the adjacent base station<br>
for the Toff time in the following interval D2 [Ton, T) of the first frame in step 729,<br>
to determine whether the handoff target base station is detected. Here, the terminal<br>
searches for the adjacent base station not for the whole Toff interval, but for an<br>
interval S=Toff-a, where "a" is the guard time required in switching from the mode<br>
1 to the mode 2.<br>
Here, if the handoff target base station is detected, the terminal sends a base<br>
station detection message to the base station and is handed off to the detected base<br>
station in step 737. However, when the target base station is not detected, the<br>
4<br>
terminal proceeds to step 733. In the meantime, when the base station does not<br>
receive the base sation detection message for a predetermined time after<br>
transmission of the first frame data, it stops transmitting the data for the time Toff<br>
in the leading interval Dl [T, T+Toff) of the second frame succeeding the first<br>
frame and instead, transmits the data of the increased data rate for the time Ton in<br>
the following interval D2 [T+Toff, 2T) of the second frame, in step 731. The<br>
terminal then receives the frame data in step 733, and checks in step 735 whether<br>
the handoff target base station is detected by measuring the signal strength of the<br>
adjacent base station for the Toff time in the leading interval Dl of the second<br>
frame.<br>
Upon detection of the handoff target base station, the terminal sends the base<br>
station detection message to the base station and is handed off to the detected base<br>
station in step 737. However, when the terminal fails to search for the handoff target<br>
base station, it returns to step 727 to receive the next (i.e., second) frame data. After<br>
sending the base station detection message, the terminal resets in step 739 the<br>
parameters for the normal mode, in such a manner that Ton=T, Toff=0 and R=Rc,<br>
and communicates with the new base station in step 741.<br>
The relation between the transmission intervals and the associated<br>
transmission powers are represented by reference numerals 400 and 420, in which<br>
the transmission powers are, as illustrated, increased by T/Ton times as compared<br>
with the case where the data is normally transmitted. In result, as illustrated in FIG.<br>
4, the actual search time available for the adjacent base station search is 2Toff-a-b<br>
which is shorter by a+b than the conventional search time S=2Toff-2a-2b. That is<br>
to say, the terminal searches for the adjacent base station for the consecutive<br>
intervals between Ton and T of the present (i.e., first) frame and between T and<br>
T+Toff of the next (i.e., second) frame. Accordingly, it is possible for the terminal<br>
to reduce, by half, the frequency of switching between the mode 2 (in which the<br>
terminal searches for the adjacent base station) and the mode 1 (in which the<br>
terminal receives the data), which increases the search time available for the base<br>
station search and decreases the load of the frequent mode switching.<br>
In FIG. 7, a description is made of a case where the terminal measures the<br>
strength of the received signal and sends the signal strength value to the bases<br>
station when the measured signal strength value is lower than the threshold level,<br>
and then the base station analyzes the signal strength value and sends the handoff<br>
request message to the terminal according to the analysis. However, it is also<br>
possible that the terminal analyzes the received signal strength and sends the<br>
handoff request message to the base station according to the analysis. That is, when<br>
the received signal strength becomes lower than the threshold level during the<br>
normal communication, the terminal sends the handoff request message to the base<br>
station and then performs the handoff operation, as illustrated in FIG. 4, according<br>
to the handoff parameters that the base station sends in answer to the handoff<br>
request message.<br>
FIG. 8 is a flowchart illustrating the handoff procedure performed in the<br>
terminal, in the case where the data transmission and reception intervals for handoff<br>
are a half cycle T/2 of one frame.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, in steps 810 to 814, the terminal sends the handoff<br>
request message to the base station when the handoff operation is necessary during<br>
the normal data reception. In answer to the handoff request message, the base<br>
station then transmits the data for the leading half interval of the first frame at the<br>
double data rate. The base station transmission power during the leading half<br>
interval of the first frame is represented by reference numeral 400 in FIG. 4. The<br>
terminal receives the data in the leading interval of the first frame in step 814, and<br>
searches for the adjacent base station for the following half cycle of the first frame<br>
in step 816. Here, the terminal searches for the adjacent base station not for the<br>
whole following half cycle, but for the following half cycle from which the guard<br>
time "a" required in switching from the transmission mode to the reception mode<br>
is subtracted. Therefore, an actual time available for the adjacent base station search<br>
is S/2=Toff-a.<br>
In the meantime, the terminal judges in step 818 whether a signal is detected<br>
from the adjacent base station (i.e., whether the adjacent base station is detected).<br>
If it is judged that the adjacent base station is detected, the terminal is handed off<br>
in step 826 to the new base station after delay of the guard time b required in<br>
switching from the reception mode to the transmission mode. After being handed<br>
off, the terminal returns to step 810 and continues to perform the normal data<br>
reception.<br>
However, when the signal is not detected from the adjacent base station in<br>
step 818, the terminal goes to step 820 and searches for the adjacent base station for<br>
the leading half cycle of the next frame from which the guard time "b" required in<br>
switching from the base station transmission mode 2 (or terminal reception mode<br>
2) to the base station reception mode 1 (or terminal reception mode 1) is subtracted.<br>
That is, in step 820, the actual time available for the adjacent base station search is<br>
S/2=T/2-b. After passage of the cycle S/2 for the adjacent base station search, the<br>
terminal receives the data for the following T/2 cycle after delay of the guard time<br>
"b" required in switching from the base station transmission mode 2 (or terminal<br>
reception mode 2) to the base station reception mode 1 (or terminal reception mode<br>
1), in step 822. Here, the above-mentioned T/2 cycle corresponds to one frame<br>
cycle from which the cycle wasted in searching for the adjacent base station and the<br>
guard time "b" are subtracted. After completion of the data reception, the cellular<br>
terminal judges in step 824 whether the adjacent base station is detected during step<br>
820. If it is judge in step 824 that the adjacent base station is detected, the terminal<br>
is handed off to the searched adjacent base station in step 826 and then returns to<br>
step 810 to perform the normal data reception.<br>
Now, reference will be made to a handoff procedure according to an another<br>
embodiment of the present invention with reference to FIGs. 9 to 11.<br>
FIGs. 9 and 10 illustrate a handoff scheme for the base station and a handoff<br>
scheme for the terminal according to another embodiment of the present invention,<br>
respectively.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, channel encoders 911 and 912 encode input data into<br>
symbol data at corresponding coding rates R=Rc and R=Rc*T/Ton, respectively.<br>
Interleaves 913 and 914 interleave the symbol data output from the channel<br>
encoders 911 and 912, respectively. A rate converter 915 converts (or increases) a<br>
data rate of the symbol data output from the inter leaver 914 by T/Ton times. A first<br>
amplifier 916 amplifies the symbol data output from the interleaver 913 with a<br>
specific gain, and a second amplifier 917 amplifies the symbol data output from the<br>
rate converter 915 with a specific gain. Here, the gain of the second amplifier 917<br>
is set higher than the gain of the first amplifier 916, in proportional to the converted<br>
data rate. This is to compensate for the bit error rate (BER) which may be caused<br>
by the increased data rate.<br>
A first switch 918 is switched to the first amplifier 916 in the normal mode<br>
and to the second amplifier 917 in the handoff mode, under the control of a<br>
undepicted controller. That is, the first switch 918 transfers an output of the first<br>
amplifier 916 to a second switch 919 in the normal mode and an output of the<br>
second amplifier 917 to the second switch 919 in the handoff mode. In the normal<br>
operation mode, the second switch 919 is turned on (or closed) in the leading<br>
interval of the first frame and the following interval of the second frame. However,<br>
in the handoff mode, the second switch 919 is turned off (or opened) in the<br>
following interval of the first frame and the leading interval of the second frame.<br>
That is, under the control of the undepicted controller, the second switch 919<br>
switches between the transmission interval and the non-transmission interval of the<br>
frame, during data transmission in the handoff mode, and is turned on only in the<br>
transmission interval to transfer the data from the first switch 918 to a modulator<br>
920. The modulator 920 modulates the data from the second switch 919 by using<br>
a carrier wave fO of the base station itself, generated from an oscillator 921, and<br>
radiates the modulated signal through a undepicted antenna. Here, the undepicted<br>
controller, the first switch 918 and the second switch 919 correspond to a controller<br>
for controlling a transmission operation of the base station.<br>
In the case that the mobile communication system is a CDMA<br>
communication system, a transmitter in the base station apparatus is composed of<br>
the channel encoder 912, the interleaver 914, the rate converter 915, the amplifier<br>
917, and the modulator 920. Here, the rate converter 915 may include orthogonal<br>
modulation and PN sequence spreading, and the amplifier 917 may be a gain<br>
controller. Further, the undepicted controller controls the channel encoder 912, the<br>
interleaver 914, the rate converter 915 and the amplifier 917, in the handoff mode.<br>
When the mobile communication system switches from the normal mode to the<br>
handoff mode, the controller decreases the coding rate of the channel encoder 912<br>
to be lower than that in the normal mode to decrease the number of the coded data<br>
symbols, and controls the interleaver 914 to interleave the decreased data symbols.<br>
Here, if the coding rate is decreased by 1/2, the symbol number of the frame data<br>
is also decreased by half, so that separate rate conversion is not required. When the<br>
rate conversion is required, the controller uses a fast data transmission clock by<br>
controlling the rate converter 915, and controls the orthogonal modulation by using<br>
orthogonal codes of short length. In addition, the controller increases the gain of the<br>
amplifier 917 in the data transmission interval (i.e., the first interval of the first<br>
frame and the second interval of the second frame) to provide a transmission power<br>
higher than that in the normal mode, and disables the amplifier 917 in the data non-<br>
transmission interval (i.e., the second interval of the first frame and the first interval<br>
of the second frame).<br>
As can be appreciated from the foregoing descriptions, a method for<br>
converting a rate of the data transmitted in the first interval of the first frame and the<br>
second interval of the second frame can be divided into two methods. One is to<br>
perform the rate conversion as shown in FIG. 5 to transmit the frame data in the<br>
data transmission data, and another is to decrease the number of data symbols by<br>
decreasing the coding rate of the channel encoder as shown in FIG. 9. Further, it is<br>
also possible to use both of the two methods in order to set the data transmission<br>
interval to be longer than the data non-transmission interval.<br>
Next, referring to FIG. 10, a mixer (or demodulator) 1012 demodulates a<br>
signal received via a undepicted antenna by using a carrier wave f0 or fi (where i?0)<br>
of a corresponding base station, generated from an oscillator 1011. Specifically,<br>
when the signal is received from the present base station, the mixer 1012<br>
demodulates the received signal using the carrier wave fO, and when the signal is<br>
received from the adjacent base station, the mixer 1012 demodulates the received<br>
signal using the carrier wave fi for the adjacent base station. A third switch 1013<br>
switches, in sync with the second switch 919, an output signal of the mixer 1012 to<br>
a fourth switch 1014 in a frame data reception interval Ton (or transmission interval<br>
of the base station) and to a signal strength measuring part. 1015 in a frame data<br>
non-reception interval Toff (or non-transmission interval of the base station). The<br>
signal strength measuring part 1015 measures the strength of the signal received<br>
from the adjacent base station in the non-transmission interval. A handoff<br>
determiner 1016 determines whether to perform the handoff operation depending<br>
upon the detected signal strength value of the adjacent base station, output from the<br>
signal strength measuring part 1015.<br>
The fourth switch 1014 switches to the mode 0 or the mode 1 in sync with<br>
the first switch 918. Specifically, the fourth switch 1014 switches the data received<br>
from the third switch 1013 to a deinterleaver 1018 in a normal data reception mode<br>
(i.e., mode 0) and to a rate deconverter 1017 in a data reception mode (i.e., mode<br>
1) for handoff. Here, the data switched to the deinterleaver 1018 has a normal data<br>
rate and the data switched to the rate deconverter 1017 has a data rate higher than<br>
that of the original data. The rate deconverter 1017 deconverts the data rate of the<br>
received data from the fourth switch 1014 to the original data rate. The deinterleaver<br>
1018 deinterleaves the data received from the fourth switch 1014 and a<br>
deinterleaver 1019 deinterleaves the rate deconverted data output from the rate<br>
deconverter 1017. A channel decoder 1030 decodes an output of the deinterleaver<br>
1018 at a decoding rate R=Rc and a channel decoder 1031 decodes an output of the<br>
deinterleaver 1019 at a decoding rate R=Rc*T/Ton.<br>
In the case that the terminal apparatus of FIG. 10 is a CDMA terminal<br>
apparatus, a receiver in the terminal apparatus is composed of the demodulator<br>
1012, the switch 1013, the rate deconverter 1017, the deinterleaver 1019, the<br>
channel decoder 1031, the signal strength measuring part 1015 and the handoff<br>
determiner 1016. The undepicted controller in the terminal controls the rate<br>
deconverter 1017, the switch 1013, the deinterleaver 1019 and the channel decoder<br>
1031.<br>
FIG. 11 is a flowchart illustrating a handoff procedure between the base<br>
station and the terminal according to another embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, the base station transmits the data for the whole frame cycle<br>
T in step 1011, and then the terminal receives the transmitted data for the whole<br>
frame cycle in step 1113. This operation corresponds to the mode 0 in which<br>
Ton=T, Toff=0 and R=Rc. In step 1115, the terminal measures the signal strength<br>
of the present base station and informs the base station of the measured signal<br>
strength value when it is lower than a threshold level. Depending on the detected<br>
signal strength value, the base station judges in step 1117 whether to perform the<br>
handoff. When it is not necessary to perform the handoff, the base station returns<br>
to step 1111 and continues to transmit the data in the mode 0. Here, it is also<br>
possible that the terminal sends a handoff request message to the base station by<br>
measuring the strength of the received signal.<br>
However, if it is necessary to perform the handoff, the base station proceeds<br>
to step 1119 to send the handoff parameters of Ton=T1, Toff=T2 and T1+T2=T to<br>
the terminal. The terminal then receives the handoff parameters in step 1121 and<br>
sends an acknowledge signal ACK. The base station checks in step 1123 whether<br>
the acknowledge signal ACK is received from the terminal. When the acknowledge<br>
signal ACK is not received for a predetermined time, the base station returns to step<br>
1119 to send again the handoff parameters. However, when the acknowledge signal<br>
ACK is received in step 1123, the base station goes to step 1125 to reset the channel<br>
coding rate R to Rc*T/Ton for handoff, where Rc is the coding rate for the mode<br>
0, T is the frame cycle and Ton is the transmission time.<br>
Thereafter, the base station transmits in step 1127 the rate converted first<br>
frame data for the leading interval Dl [0, Ton) of the first frame and, the terminal<br>
receives the frame data in the leading interval Dl of the first frame in step 1129.<br>
The relation between the data transmission interval Ton and the base station<br>
transmission power (or terminal reception power) is represented by reference<br>
numeral 400 in FIG. 4, in which the transmission power is, as illustrated, increased<br>
by T/Ton times as compared with the case where the data is normally transmitted.<br>
In this case, although thenumber data symbols in the leading interval Dl [0,Ton)<br>
of the first frame is constant without regard to a change of the channel coding rate,<br>
the number of the data symbols available for the channel decoding and the<br>
interleaving effect are reduced. After receiving the data at the changed channel<br>
coding rate, the terminal measures the signal strength of the adjacent base station<br>
for the Toff period in the following interval D2 [Ton, T) of the first frame in step<br>
1131, to determine whether the handoff target base station is detected. Here, the<br>
terminal searches for the adjacent base station not for the whole Toff interval, but<br>
for an interval S=Toff-a, where "a" is the guard time required in switching from the<br>
mode 1 to the mode 2.<br>
Here, if the handoff target base station is detected, the terminal sends a base<br>
station detection message to the base station and is handed off to the detected base<br>
station in step 1139. However, when the handoff target base station is not detected,<br>
the terminal proceeds to step 1135. In the meantime, when the base station does not<br>
receive the base sation detection message for a predetermined time after<br>
transmission of the first frame data, it stops transmitting the data for the time Toff<br>
in the leading interval Dl [T, T+Toff) of the second frame succeeding to the first<br>
frame and instead, transmits the second frame data for the time Ton in the following<br>
interval D2 [T+Toff, 2T), in step 1133. The terminal then receives the second frame<br>
data in step 1 135, and checks in step 1137 whether the handoff target base station<br>
is detected by measuring the signal strength of the adjacent base station for the Toff<br>
time in the leading interval D1, being the non-transmission interval [T, T+Toff), of<br>
the second frame. Here, the terminal searches for the adjacent base station not for<br>
the whole Toff time, but for the time Toff-b, where "b" denotes the guard time<br>
required in switching from the mode 2 to the mode 1. That is, in step 1137, the<br>
actual time available for the adjacent base station search is Toff-b. In the meantime,<br>
when the terminal detects the handoff target base station, it sends the base station<br>
detection message to the base station and is handed off to the adjacent base station<br>
in step 1139. However, when the terminal fails to detect the handoff target base<br>
station, it returns to step 1 129 to receive the next (i.e., second) frame data. After<br>
sending the base station detection message, the terminal resets in step 1141 the<br>
parameters to Ton=T and Toff=0 for the normal mode and communicates with the<br>
new base station in step 1 143.<br>
As described above, the actual search time available for the adjacent base<br>
station search and the relation between the base station transmission power (or<br>
terminal reception power) and the channel coding rates in respective modes are well<br>
illustrated in FIG. 4. In result, as illustrated in FIG. 4, the actual search time<br>
available for the adjacent base station search is 2Toff-a-b which is shorter by a+b<br>
than the conventional search time 2Toff-2a-2b. That is to say, the terminal searches<br>
for the adjacent base station for the consecutive intervals between Ton and T of the<br>
present (i.e., first) frame and between T and T+Toff of the next (i.e., second) frame.<br>
Accordingly, it is possible for the terminal to reduce, by half, the frequency of<br>
switching between the mode 2 (in which the terminal searches for the adjacent base<br>
station) and the mode 1 (in which the terminal receives the data), which increases<br>
the search time available for the base station search and decreases the load of the<br>
frequent mode switching.<br>
Furthermore, in this embodiment, a symbol rate of the frame data is primarily<br>
reduced and the data rate is adjusted by using the reduced symbol rate, which<br>
decreases a load of adjusting the data rate. For example, if the data rate of the<br>
original data is 25bps and the original channel coding rate is 1/4, the symbol rate<br>
is 100bps. Here, to increase the data rate by 2(T/Ton) times, the 100bps data should<br>
be transmitted at a data rate of 200bps, which causes a heavy load. However, if the<br>
channel coding rate is first adjusted to 1/2(1/4*T/Ton) so as to provide the symbol<br>
rate 50bps, the data rate of the transmission data is adjusted from 50bps to 100bps,<br>
so that the load may be reduced as compared with the above method.<br>
As described above, in the novel handoff method, the data reception interval<br>
(or data transmission interval of the base station) changes with the search interval<br>
(or data non-transmission interval of the base station) during the handoff mode.<br>
Therefore, it is possible to increase the actual search time available for the adjacent<br>
base station search by the guard time required in switching the modes, thereby<br>
decreasing the mode switching load.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to a certain<br>
preferred embodiment thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that<br>
various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the<br>
spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.<br>
