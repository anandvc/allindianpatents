Description<br>
APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CHANNEL ESTIMATION IN<br>
AN ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING<br>
CELLULAR COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING MULTIPLE<br>
TRANSMIT ANTENNAS<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates generally to a channel estimation apparatus and<br>
method in an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) communication<br>
system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for performing accurate channel<br>
estimation by canceling inter-cellular interference in a MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple<br>
Output)-OFDM communication system.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	Typically, a wireless communication system refers to a system supporting wireless<br>
communication service, which includes Node Bs and UEs(User Equipment). The Node<br>
B and the UE support the wireless communication service in transmission frames. For<br>
frame transmission and reception, therefore, synchronization must be acquired between<br>
a Node B and a UE. Accordingly, the Node B transmits a synchronization signal to the<br>
UE, such that the UE can identify the start of a frame. The UE then detects the frame<br>
timing of the Node B from the synchronization signal and demodulates a received<br>
frame based on the frame timing. In general, the synchronization signal is a preamble<br>
sequence preset between the Node B and the UE.<br>
[3]	Preferably, a multi-carrier OFDM communication system uses a preamble<br>
sequence having a low PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio). The Node B transmits<br>
to the UE the first part of a long preamble for coarse synchronization, followed by a<br>
short preamble for fine synchronization. The UE transmits only a short preamble to the<br>
Node B, for fine synchronization.<br>
[4]	The OFDM communication system transmits user data to a plurality of users, i.e.,<br>
UEs, by multiplexing a frame in time. Simultaneously, a frame preamble is transmitted<br>
for a predetermined time period starting from the start of a frame, to indicate the start<br>
of the frame. Because of burst data transmission to users in one frame, a burst<br>
preamble exists in front of each user data in order to indicate the start of the data.<br>
Therefore, the UE receives the data preamble to determine the start of its user data.<br>
More specifically, to synchronize it's timing to the start of data for data reception, the<br>
UE receives a common preamble sequence in the system and acquires synchronization,<br>
prior to signal reception.<br>
[5]	The OFDM communication system uses the same source coding, channel coding,<br><br>
and modulation as non-OFDM communication systems. Compared to a CDMA (Code<br>
Division Multiple Access) communication system in which data is spread prior to<br>
transmission, the OFDM communication system inserts a guard interval into an IFFT<br>
(Inverse Fast Fourier Transform) signal. Therefore, the OFDM communication system<br>
can transmit a broadband signal with simple hardware relative to the CDMA com-<br>
munication system. The OFDM communication system IFFT-processes a modulated<br>
bit-symbol sequence, thereby producing a time-domain signal. The time-domain signal<br>
(i.e. OFDM symbol) is a broadband signal in which a plurality of narrow-band<br>
subcarrier signals are multiplexed. A plurality of modulated symbols are delivered for<br>
one OFDM symbol period.<br>
[6]	However, simple transmission of an IFFT OFDM symbol without any further<br>
processing leads to inevitable interference between the previous OFDM symbol and<br>
the present OFDM symbol To cancel the ISI (Inter-Symbol Interference), a guard<br>
interval is inserted. It was proposed that null data is to be inserted for a predetermined<br>
interval as the guard interval. The distinctive shortcoming of this guard interval is that<br>
for an incorrect estimation of the start of the OFDM symbol at the receiver, in-<br>
terference occurs between subcarriers, increasing the wrong decision probability of the<br>
received OFDM symbol. Therefore, the guard interval is used in form of a 'cyclic<br>
prefix' or 'cyclic postfix'. The cyclic prefix is a copy of the last 1/n bits of a time-<br>
domain OFDM symbol, inserted into an effective OFDM symbol, and the cyclic<br>
postfix is a copy of the first 1/n bits of the time-domain OFDM symbol, inserted into<br>
the effective OFDM symbol. Utilizing the guard interval as the redundant information<br>
of the copied first or last part of one OFDM symbol, the receiver can acquire the time/<br>
frequency synchronization of a received OFDM symbol.<br>
[7]	A signal transmitted from the transmitter is distorted as it experiences a radio<br>
channel and thus the distorted signal arrives at the receiver. The receiver performs<br>
channel estimation by acquiring time/frequency synchronization using a known<br>
preamble sequence, and channel-compensates frequency-domain FFT (Fast Fourier<br>
Transform) symbols using the channel estimate. The receiver then recovers in-<br>
formation data by channel decoding and source decoding the channel-compensated<br>
symbols in correspondence with the channel coding and source coding used in the<br>
transmitter.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[8]	The OFDM communication system uses a preamble sequence to achieve frame<br>
timing synchronization, frequency synchronization, and channel estimation. Although<br>
a guard interval and pilot subcarriers can be used instead of the preamble in frame<br><br>
timing synchronization, frequency synchronization, and channel estimation, the<br>
transmitter usually transmits known symbols at the start of every frame or data burst as<br>
a preamble sequence and the receiver updates time/frequency/channel information with<br>
the preamble sequence.<br>
[9]	The importance of channel estimation lies in coherent modulation and de-<br>
modulation in the OFDM system. A channel estimator is a required for systems using<br>
coherent modulation and demodulation. Especially under a MIMO environment,<br>
channel information is needed for every antenna, further increasing the importance of<br>
the channel estimation.<br>
[10]	When the MIMO-OFDM system supports a cellular environment, severe in-<br>
terference occurs at cell boundaries, thereby degrading channel estimation<br>
performance. Accordingly, a need exists for channel estimation techniques that<br>
minimize inter-cellular interference in the MIMO-OFDM cellular system.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[11]	Accordingly, the present invention has been designed to substantially solve at least<br>
the above problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages below.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
performing accurate channel estimation by canceling inter-cellular interference in an<br>
OFDM communication system.<br>
[12]	Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
performing accurate channel estimation by canceling inter-cellular interference in a<br>
wireless cellular communication system.<br>
[13]	A further object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus and method for<br>
determining a number of channel-estimatable Node Bs (or cells) in a wireless cellular<br>
communication system.<br>
[14]	The above and other objects are achieved by providing an apparatus and method<br>
for channel estimation in an OFDM cellular communication system using multiple<br>
antennas.<br>
[15]	According to one aspect of the present invention, in an apparatus for channel<br>
estimation using preamble signals received from a serving Node B and neighboring<br>
Node Bs in a UE in a broadband wireless communication system in which each of the<br>
Node Bs transmits a signal through N (&gt;1) antennas and the UE receives a signal<br>
through M (&gt;1) antennas, a Node B number decider calculates the maximum number<br>
N of channel-estimatable Node Bs using a preamble length, the number of antennas in<br>
each of the Node Bs, and the number of multiple paths. A multi-cell preamble matrix<br>
generator generates a multi-cell preamble matrix x by generating a Node B preamble<br>
matrix for each of the serving Node B and the neighboring Node Bs and selecting N<br>
Node B preamble matrices according to reception power among the generated Node B<br><br>
preamble matrices. A channel estimator performs a channel estimation using the multi-<br>
cell preamble matrix x and M signals received through the M antennas during a<br>
preamble receiving period.<br>
[16]	According to another aspect of the present invention, in an apparatus for channel<br>
estimation using preamble signals received from a serving Node B and neighboring<br>
Node Bs in a UE in a broadband wireless communication system where each of the<br>
Node Bs transmits a signal through N (≥1) antennas and the UE receives a signal<br>
through M (≥1) antennas, a Node B number decider calculates the maximum number<br>
N of channel-estimatable Node Bs using a preamble length A, the number of antennas<br>
N in each of the Node Bs, and the number L of multiple paths by<br><br>
. A channel estimator selects N Node Bs according to the reception power of the<br>
serving Node B and the neighboring Node Bs and performs a channel estimation using<br>
known preamble information associated with the N Node Bs and signals received<br>
through the M antennas.<br>
[17]	According to a further aspect of the present invention, in a method of channel<br>
estimation using preamble signals received from a serving Node B and neighboring<br>
Node Bs in a UE in a broadband wireless communication system where each of the<br>
Node Bs transmits a signal through N (≥1) antennas and the UE receives a signal<br>
through M (≥1) antennas, the maximum number N of channel-estimatable Node Bs is<br>
calculated using a preamble length, the number of antennas in each of the Node Bs,<br>
and the number of multiple paths. N Node Bs are selected according to the reception<br>
power of the serving Node B and the neighboring Node Bs, Node B preamble matrices<br>
are generated for the respective selected N Node Bs, and a multi-cell preamble matrix<br>
xs is generated by combining the Ns Node B preamble matrices. A channel estimation<br><br>
is then performed using the multi-cell preamble matrix xs and M signals received<br>
through the M antennas during a preamble receiving period.<br>
[18]	According to still another aspect of the present invention, in a method of channel<br>
estimation using preamble signals received from a serving Node B and neighboring<br>
Node Bs in a UE in a broadband wireless communication system where each of the<br>
Node Bs transmits a signal through N (≥1) antennas and the UE receives a signal<br>
through M (≥1) antennas, the maximum number Ns of channel-estimatable Node Bs is<br>
calculated using a preamble length A, the number of antennas N in each of the Node<br>
Bs, and the number L of multiple paths by<br><br><br>
. Ns Node Bs are selected according to the reception power of the serving Node B and<br>
the neighboring Node Bs and a channel estimation is performed using known preamble<br>
information associated with the Ns Node Bs and signals received through the M<br>
antennas.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
[19]	In accordance with the present invention as described above, the use of a multi-cell<br>
estimation method, which removes inter-cellular interference, enables more accurate<br>
channel estimation and increases data demodulation performance as well in an OFDM<br>
communication system.<br>

Best Mode<br>
[41]	Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein below with<br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description, well-known<br>
functions or constructions are not described in detail because they would obscure the<br>
invention in unnecessary detail.<br>
[42]	The present invention is directed to an apparatus and method for performing<br>
accurate channel estimation by canceling inter-cellular interference at a receiver in a<br>
MIMO-OFDM cellular communication system. While the following description is<br>
made in the context of a MIMO-OFDM system by way of example, it is to be ap-<br>
preciated that the present invention is applicable to any system suffering inter-cellular<br>
interference.<br>
[43]	FIG. 1 is a block diagram illustrating a transmitter using N transmit antennas in an<br><br>
OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, the transmitter includes a symbol mapper 111, a serial-to-parallel<br>
converter (SPC) 113, a multi-antenna transmission coder 115, N preamble sequence<br>
generators 117 to 129, N selectors 119 to 131, NIFFT processors 121 to 133, N<br>
parallel-to-serial converters (PSCs) 123 to 135, N digital-to-analog converters (DACs)<br>
125 to 137, and N RF (Radio Frequency) processors 127 to 139.<br>
[44]	In operation, the symbol mapper 111 encodes input information bits at a pre-<br>
determined code rate and modulates the coded bits according to a predetermined<br>
modulation order. The symbol mapper 111 is configured to have a channel coder and a<br>
modulator. For example, the channel coder is a Turbo coder or a convolutional coder,<br>
and the modulator uses QPSK (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying), 8PSK (8-ary PSK),<br>
16QAM (16-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation), or 64QAM (64-ary QAM).<br>
[45]	The SPC 113 performs BxN-point serial-to-parallel conversion on the modulated<br>
symbols. B is the number of subcarriers for delivering data from each transmit antenna<br>
and N is the number of transmit antennas. Upon generation of BxN symbols for all the<br>
transmit antennas in the symbol mapper 111, the SPC 113 parallel converts the<br>
symbols.<br>
[46]	The multi-antenna transmission coder 115 can be a space-time coder, a data<br>
multiplexer, or any other device according to its purposes. In general, the space-time<br>
coder is used for transmit antenna diversity, and the data multiplexer for increasing<br>
data capacity. The multi-antenna transmission coder 115 generates N antenna signals<br>
by encoding the modulated symbols in a predetermined coding method, and the N<br>
antenna signals are men provided them to the selectors 119 to 131, which are matched<br>
to the respective N antennas.<br>
[47]	The preamble sequence generator 117 for antenna #0 generates a predetermined<br>
preamble sequence under the control of a controller (not shown), which will be<br>
described in great detail with reference to FIG. 3.<br>
[48]	The selector 119 selects one of the preamble sequence received from the preamble<br>
sequence generator 117 and the antenna signal received from me multi-antenna<br>
transmission coder 115 according to scheduling at the moment That is, the selector<br>
119 determines whether to transmit the preamble sequence or the code symbols.<br>
According to the decision result, the selector 119 provides the preamble sequence or<br>
the symbols to the IFFT processor 121 for antenna #0.<br>
[49]	The IFFT processor 121 A-point 1FFT -processes the preamble sequence or the<br>
symbols. A is the total number of subcarriers for IFFT and B is the number of available<br>
subcarriers, not including DC(down converted) subcarriers and the subcarriers of an<br>
unused high frequency band.<br>
[50]	The PSC 123 receives a cyclic prefix (CP) and the IFFT signals, and then serial<br><br>
converts the received signals. The DAC 125 converts the digital signal received from<br>
the PSC 123 to an analog signal. The RF processor 127, including a filter and a front-<br>
end unit, processes the analog signal to an RF signal and then transmits the RF signal<br>
through antenna #0.<br>
[51]	The preamble sequence generator 129 for antenna #(N-1) generates a pre-<br>
determined preamble sequence under the control of the controller (not shown). The<br>
selector 131 selects the preamble sequence received from the preamble sequence<br>
generator 129 or the antenna signal received from the multi-antenna transmission coder<br>
115 according to the scheduling at the moment. That is, the selector 131 determines<br>
whether to transmit the preamble sequence or the code symbols. According to the<br>
decision result, the selector 131 provides the preamble sequence or the symbols to the<br>
IFFT processor 133 for antenna #(N-1).<br>
[52]	The IFFT processor 133 A-point IFFT-processes the preamble sequence or the<br>
symbols. As described above, A is the total number of subcarriers for IFFT and B is<br>
the number of available subcarriers, not including DC(down converted) subcarriers and<br>
the subcarriers of an unused high frequency band.<br>
[53]	The PSC 135 receives a CP and the IFFT signals, and the serial converts the<br>
received signals. The DAC 137 converts the digital signal received from the PSC 123<br>
to an analog signal. The RF processor 139, including a filter and a front-end unit,<br>
processes the analog signal to an RF signal, and then transmits the RF signal through<br>
antenna #(N-1).<br>
[54]	FIG. 2 is a block diagram illustrating a receiver using M receive antennas in an<br>
OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, the receiver includes M receive antennas, M RF (Radio<br>
Frequency) processors 201 to 207, M analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) 203 to 209,<br>
M SPCs (Serial to Parallel Converters) 205 to 211, M FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)<br>
processors 215 to 217, a multi-cell channel estimator 213, M equalizers 219 to 221, a<br>
multi-antenna reception decoder 223, a PSC (Parallel to Serial Converter) 225, and a<br>
demodulator 227.<br>
[55]	In operation, the RF processor 201 processes a signal received through antenna #0<br>
through an RF filter and a front-end unit. The ADC 203 converts the analog signal<br>
received from the RF processor 210 to a digital signal. The SPC 205 removes CP<br>
samples from the digital signal, and parallel converts the remaining signal to signals y<br>
(Ax1) as an input to a digital end. Similarly, the SPC 211 outputs digital input signals y<br>
(Ax1) from antenna #(M-1).<br>
M-1<br>
[56]	At a preamble reception time, the received signals y (Ax1) to y (Ax1) are<br>
provided to the multi-cell estimator 213. The multi-cell estimator 213 estimates all<br>
possible MxNxL channels and provides the channel estimates to the equalizers 219 to<br><br>
221. M is the number of the receive antennas, N is the number of the transmit<br>
antennas, and L is the number of multiple paths. The multi-cell channel estimator 213<br>
will be described later in more detail with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
[57]	At a non-preamble reception time, the received signals y0 (Ax1) to y (Ax1) are<br>
	M-1<br>
provided to the FFT processors 215 to 217. The FFT processors 215 to 217 A-point<br>
FFT-process the received signals. The equalizers 219 to 221 compensate the FFT<br>
signals for channel distortion associated with the respective receive antennas using the<br>
channel estimates.<br>
[58]	The multi-antenna reception decoder 223 decodes the channel-compensated signals<br>
to one signal stream according to a predetermined rule. The PSC 225 serializes the<br>
parallel data received from the multi-antenna reception decoder 223. Thereafter, the<br>
demodulator 225 recovers the original information bit stream by demodulating and<br>
decoding the serial data in a predetermined method.<br>
[59]	FIG. 3 illustrates a preamble transmission rule according to the present invention.<br>
The preamble sequence transmission rule is applied to N Node Bs, including a<br>
serving Node B and its neighboring Node Bs, each Node B using N transmit antennas.<br>
Here, the serving Node B refers to a reference Node B for generating preamble<br>
sequences.<br>
[60]	Referring to FIG. 3, a reference Node N 301 (Node B #0) is provided with N<br>
preamble sequence generators 303 to 305. The N preamble sequence generators 303 to<br>
305 generate different preamble sequences in a predetermined method. The pre-<br>
determined method can be to allocate different subcarriers to different transmit<br>
antennas. For example, if N is 2, for one antenna, a particular sequence is allocated to<br>
odd-numbered subcarriers with null data on even-numbered subcarriers among total<br>
subcarriers, while for the other antenna, the sequence is allocated to the even-<br>
numbered subcarriers with null data on the odd-numbered subcarriers.<br>
[61]	A Node B 307 (Node B #1) has N preamble sequences 308 to 310 and N L-phase<br>
shifters 309 to 311. The N preamble sequence generators 308 to 310 generate the same<br>
N preamble sequences as in Node B #0 301. The L-phase shifters 309 to 311 then shift<br>
the phases of the preamble sequences received from their matched preamble sequence<br>
generators 308 to 310 by L, thereby producing final preamble sequences. L can be set<br>
to the length of the CP. The use of the L-phase shifters is a known technology for<br>
rendering the preambles of Node B #1 307 to be orthogonal to those of Node B #0 301.<br>
[62]	Although the description of the present invention is based on the presumption of<br>
using the L-phase shifters, the preamble sequences can be generated in another suitable<br>
manner.<br>
[63]	Similarly, a Node B 313 (Node B#(N -1)) has N preamble sequences 314 to 316<br>
and N Lx(NB -1)-phase shifters 325 to 317. The N preamble sequence generators 314<br><br><br>
to 316 generate the same N preamble sequences as in Node B #0 301. The<br>
Lx(NB -1)-phase shifters 309 to 311 then shift the phases of the preamble<br>
. sequences received from their matched preamble sequence generators 314 to<br>
316 by Lx(NB -1), thereby producing final preamble sequences.<br>
FIG. -4 illustrates an operational principle of L-phase shifters as illustrated in<br>
FIG.3. Referring to FIG. 4, after L-phase shifting, the phase of a frequency-<br>
domain signal [X0, X1,..., XA-1] is shifted in the frequency domain. If the phase-<br>
shifted signal is IFFT-processed to a time-domain signal, it is then a cyclically-<br>
shifted signal. Because orthogonality is ensured between IFFT cyclically-shifted<br>
signals, usually, a phase- shifter is used in the frequency domain in generating<br>
preamble sequences.<br>
FIG. 5 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a multi-cell channel estimator in a<br>
receiver in a MIMO-OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 5, in a multi-cell channel estimator 213<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 2, a Node B number decider 503 calculates a maximum<br>
number of accommodatable (or channel-estimatable) Node Bs, Ns . The<br>
preamble length is the size of IFFT/FFT (or OFDM symbol length), A in the<br>
present invention. Accordingly, Ns is closely related to A, which will be described<br>
later in more detail with reference to FIG. 6.<br>
A multi-cell preamble matrix generator 505 generates a multi-cell preamble<br>
. matrix xs according to Ns for direct use in multi-cell channel estimation, which will<br>
be described later in more detail with reference to FIG. 7.<br><br>
A matrix y generator 509 generates a signal matrix y, as shown in Equation (1)<br>
below, by combining the time-domain signals received through the receive<br>
antennas, y0, y1,	yM-1. The received signals y0, y1,	yM-1 are the outputs of<br>
the SPCs 205 to 211 as illustrated in FIG. 2, received during a preamble time<br>
period.<br><br>
A pseudo-inverse matrix generator 507 calculates the pseudo-inverse of xs ,<br><br>
A matrix multiplier 511 multiplies y by<br><br>
, thereby producing a channel estimate<br>
h<br>
, as shown in Equation (2) below, including NxMxL channel estimate values. In<br><br>
Equation (2), N is the number of transmit antennas, M is the number of receive<br>
antennas, and L is the number of multiple paths.<br><br>
An FFT processor 513 obtains a frequency-domain channel estimate<br>
H<br>
through A-point FFT-processing of<br>
h.<br>
More specifically, the A-point FFT 513 FFT-processes L channel estimate values<br>
and outputs A channel estimate values (or subcarrier channel values), and<br>
repeats this operation NxM times. Accordingly, the FFT 513 eventually outputs<br>
NxMxA multi- path channel estimate values. Thereafter,<br>
H<br>
is provided to the equalizers 219 to 221, for channel compensation.<br>
Depending on which channel estimation method is used, the channel estimate<br>
can be calculated by multiplying a pseudo-inverse matrix, or can be calculated in<br>
the frequency domain. In the present invention, the ML (Maximum Likelihood)<br>
method using pseudo-inverse matrix multiplication is used. The present invention<br>
calculates the multi-cell preamble matrix xs using Ns.<br><br>
FIG. 6 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a Node B number decider 503 as il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 5. As described above, because the preamble length is limited<br>
to the length of an OFDM symbol, i.e., A, the number of channel-estimatable<br>
Node Bs is also limited. Also, the present invention assumes a channel<br>
environment with multiple paths such as a MIMO channel (or multi-cell)<br>
environment. Therefore, considering all these conditions, Ns is computed by<br>
Equation (3),<br><br>
where A is the IFFT size, i. e. the preamble length, L is the number of multiple<br>
paths, i. e. the Cyclic Prefix length, N is the number of transmit antennas, and NB<br>
is the number of a serving Node B plus its neighboring Node Bs.<br>
[A-LN]<br>
represents the number of channel-estimatable Node Bs. L, representing a<br>
maximum<br><br>
delay spread or a maximum channel length, is computed as the difference<br>
between the time of arrival from the earliest path and the time of arrival from<br>
the last path, expressed in the number of samples.<br>
In the OFDM system, the CP length expressed as the number of samples is<br>
typically determined using the maximum delay spread. The present invention<br>
also assumes that L is the CP length expressed in the number of samples.<br>
As noted from Equation (3), when NB is less than<br>
[ A ÷ LN ]<br>
, NB is Ns. However, when NB is larger than<br>
[A ÷ LN] ,<br>
[A ÷ LN]<br>
is Ns This computation can be implemented in hardware as illustrated in FIG. 6.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, a multiplier 601 multiplies L by N. A divider 603 divides A by<br>
the product of LxN. A floor operator 605 outputs only the integer part of<br>
A ÷ LN ,<br>
deleting the fraction part. A smaller-value selector 607 selects the smaller of the output of<br>
the floor operator 60S and NB as Ns.<br><br><br>
Similarly, a preamble matrix generator 705 for Node B #(NS -1) generates a<br>
preamble matrix for Node B #(NS -1),<br><br>
, and preamble matrix generator 709 for Node B# (NB-1) generates a preamble<br>
matrix for Node B# (NB-1),<br><br>
To increases channel estimation performance, a Node B for which channel<br>
estimation is performed must have greater power than other Node Bs. Therefore,<br>
the Node Bs are indexed in the order expressed as shown in Equation (4). In the<br>
above example, Node B #0 is highest and Node B #(N B -1) is lowest in<br>
reception power.<br>
*<br><br>
An accommodatable Node B matrix generator 711 then receives Ns from the<br>
Node B number decider 503 and selects Ns Node B preamble matrices, thereby<br>
generating the multi-cell preamble matrix<br><br><br>
FIG. 8 is a detailed block diagram illustrating a preamble matrix generator 701<br>
for Node B #0 as illustrated in FIG. 7. Referring to FIG. 8, for Node B #0 (the<br>
serving Node B), an A-point IFFT 801 generates a time-domain signal<br><br>
by IFFT-processing a preamble signal<br><br>
for transmit antenna #0.<br><br>
is input to a preamble matrix generator 825 for antenna #0 and cyclic shifters<br>
807 to 811.<br>
The cyclic shifter 807 cyclically shifts<br><br>
, for example, once, and outputs the resulting signal<br><br><br>
to the preamble matrix generator 825 for antenna #0. The cyclic shifter 809<br>
cyclically shifts<br><br>
, for example, twice, and outputs the resulting signal<br><br>
to the preamble matrix generator 825 for antenna #0. Finally, the cyclic shifter<br>
811 cyclically shifts<br><br>
(L-1) times and outputs the resulting signal<br><br>
to the preamble matrix generator 825 for antenna #0. Accordingly, preamble<br>
signals are generated for all paths for antenna #0.<br>
The preamble matrix generator 825 for antenna #0 generates a preamble matrix<br>
for antenna #0,<br><br>
by combining the outputs of the IFFT processor 801 and the cyclic shifters 807 to<br>
811.<br><br>
The preamble matrix for antenna #0 is shown in Equation (5),<br><br>
where<br><br>
is a kth sample value of a preamble transmitted from an ith antenna of a jth Node<br>
B.<br>
Similarly, a preamble matrix generator 827 for antenna #1 generates a preamble<br>
matrix for antenna #1,<br><br>
and outputs it to an antenna preamble matrix combiner 831. A preamble matrix<br><br>
generator 829 for antenna #(N-1) generates a preamble matrix for antenna #(N-<br>
1),<br><br>
and outputs it to the antenna preamble matrix combiner 831.<br>
The antenna preamble matrix combiner 831 generates the preamble matrix for<br>
Node B #0,<br><br>
by combining N antenna preamble matrices received from the N antenna<br>
preamble matrix generators 825 to 829. The preamble matrix generators 703 to<br>
709 for the other Node Bs, as illustrated in FIG. 7, generate preamble matrices<br>
for the respective Node Bs in the same manner. The preamble matrix generator<br>
for a Node B, as illustrated in FIG. 8, involves multi-path propagation in<br>
generating a preamble matrix for the Node B. In real implementation of a<br>
preamble matrix generator for a Node B, the UE preliminarily stores the<br>
preamble sample data of the Node B in a memory and cyclically shifts the<br>
preamble sample data when necessary, thereby generating a preamble matrix<br>
for the Node B.<br><br>
For better understanding of the present invention, an exemplary application will<br>
be presented below.<br>
FIG. 9 illustrates a preamble sequence transmission rule for each Node B when<br>
NB =2 and N=4. Referring to FIG. 9, a serving Node B 901 (Node B #0) is<br>
provided with four preamble sequence generators 903 to 905. The preamble<br>
sequence generators 903 to 905 generate preamble sequences in a<br>
predetermined method. The predetermined method may allocate different<br>
subcarriers to different transmit antennas.<br>
A Node B 907 (Node B #1) is provided with four preamble sequence generators<br>
908 to 910 and four 16-phase shifters 909 to 911. The preamble sequence<br>
. generators 908 to 910 generate the same four preamble sequences as in Node B<br>
#0. The 16-phase shifters 909 to 911 shift the preamble sequences by 16°,<br>
thereby generating final preamble sequences. The use of the phase shifters is a<br>
known technology for rendering the preambles of Node B #1 to be orthogonal to<br>
those of Node B #0.<br>
As described above, the description of the present invention is based on the<br>
presumption of using the phase shifters, even though the preamble sequences<br>
can be generated in a different manner.<br>
FIG. 10 illustrates an operational principle of 16-phase shifters 907 to 911 as il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 9. Referring to FIG. 10, after 16-phase shifting, the phase of a<br>
frequency-domain signal [X0, X1,..., X127] is shifted in the frequency domain. If<br>
the phase-shifted signal is IFFT-processed to a time-domain signal, it is then a<br>
cyclically-shifted signal. Because orthogonality is ensured between IFFT<br>
cyclically-shifted signals, a phase-shifter is used in the frequency domain or a<br>
cyclic shifter is used in the<br><br>
time domain in generating preamble sequences.<br>
FIG. 11 illustrates an operation of the Node B number decider 503, when A=128,<br>
N=4, L= 16, and NB =2. As described above, because L cannot be measured<br>
accurately, L is determined to be a CP length.<br>
Under the above conditions, Ns is computed using Equation (6).<br><br>
As noted from Equation (6), when 2 (=NB) is less than<br><br>
, Ns = 2. However, when 2 (= NB) is larger than<br>
128÷(16x4)<br>
, Ns is<br><br>
Preferably, this computation is implemented by hardware as illustrated in FIG.<br>
11.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 11, a multiplier 1101 multiplies 16 (=1) by 4 (=N). A divider<br>
1103 divides 128(=A) by the product of 16x4 (=LxN) by 128 (=A). A floor<br>
operator 1105 performs a floor operation on the output of the divider 1103. A<br>
smaller-value selector 1107 compares 2 being the output of the floor operator<br>
1105 with 2 (=NB), and outputs 2 as Ns.<br>
FIG. 12 illustrates an operation of the multi-cell preamble matrix generator 505<br>
when N=4, NB=2, and Ns =2. Referring to FIG. 12, a preamble matrix generator<br>
1201 for Node B #0 (the serving Node B) generates a preamble matrix for Node<br>
B#0,<br><br>
using known frequency-domain preamble information associated with four<br>
antennas of Node B #0,<br><br>
, which will be described later in more detail with reference to FIG. 13.<br>
A preamble matrix generator 1203 for Node B #1 generates a preamble matrix<br>
for Node B #1,<br><br><br>
using known frequency-domain preamble information associated with all transmit<br>
antennas of Node B #1,<br><br>
To increases channel estimation performance, a Node B for which channel<br>
estimation is performed must have greater power than the other Node B.<br>
Therefore, the Node Bs are indexed in the order expressed in Equation (7).<br><br>
A Node B matrix generator 1205 generates a multi-cell preamble matrix<br><br>
by combining the two Node B preamble matrices from the preamble matrix<br>
generators 1201 and 1203 according to Ns (=2) from the Node B number decider<br>
503.<br>
FIG. 13 illustrates an operation of the preamble matrix generator 701 for Node B<br>
#0 when A=128, N=4, and L=16. Referring to FIG. 13, a 128-point IFFT 1301<br>
generates a time-domain signal<br><br>
by IFFT-processing a preamble signal<br><br>
for transmit antenna #0.<br><br><br>
is input to a preamble matrix generator 1325 for antenna #0 and cyclic shifters<br>
1307 to 1311. The cyclic shifters 1307 to 1311 are used to acquire multi-path<br>
signals, not including a signal from the earliest path. Accordingly, the number of<br>
the cyclic shifters is less than L by 1. The multi-path signals can be acquired<br>
Simultaneously using a plurality of cyclic shifters as in this case, or can be<br>
sequentially acquired using a single cyclic shifter, changing the number of shifts.<br>
The cyclic shifter 1307 cyclically shifts<br><br>
once and outputs the resulting signal<br><br>
to the preamble matrix generator 1325 for antenna #0. The cyclic shifter 1309<br>
cyclically shifts<br><br><br>
twice and outputs the resulting signal<br><br>
to the preamble matrix generator 1325 for antenna #0. Finally, the cyclic shifter<br>
1311 cyclically shifts<br><br>
15 times and outputs the resulting signal<br><br>
to the preamble matrix generator 1325 for antenna #0.<br>
The preamble matrix generator 1325 for antenna #0 generates a preamble<br>
matrix for antenna #0,<br><br>
by combining the outputs of the IFFT processor 1301 and the cyclic shifters 1307<br>
to 1311. The preamble matrix for antenna #0 is shown in Equation (8).<br><br><br>
	(8)<br>
Similarly, a preamble matrix generator 1327 for antenna #1 generates a<br>
preamble matrix for antenna #1,<br><br>
, a preamble matrix generator for antenna #2 (not shown) generates a preamble<br>
matrix for antenna #2,<br><br>
 and a preamble matrix generator 1305 for antenna #3 generates a preamble<br>
matrix for antenna #3,<br><br>
An antenna preamble matrix combiner 1331 generates a preamble matrix for<br>
Node<br><br><br>
by combining the four antenna preamble matrices received from the four<br>
antenna preamble matrix generators 1325 to 1329. The preamble matrix<br>
generators 703 to 709 for the other Node Bs, as illustrated in FIG. 7, generate<br>
preamble matrices for the respective Node Bs in the same manner. Accordingly,<br>
multi-path propagation is considered in generating a preamble matrix for a Node<br>
B.<br>
FIG. 14 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a transmitter using N transmit<br>
antennas in the OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. Referring to FIG. 14, the transmitter generates BxN<br>
symbols to be transmitted through N transmit antennas, and generates N data<br>
signals by encoding the BxN symbols in a predetermined coding method in step<br>
1403. The BxN symbols are signals produced by coding and modulating an<br>
information bit stream in a pre-determined coding and modulation scheme.<br>
In step 1405, the transmitter determines if it is time to transmit preamble<br>
sequences. If it is time to transmit preamble sequences, the transmitter selects N<br>
pre- determined preamble sequences between the N data signals and the N<br><br>
preamble sequences. However, if it is not time to transmit preamble sequences,<br>
the transmitter selects the N data signals in step 1409.<br>
In steps 1411 and 1413, the transmitter transmits the N data signals or the N<br>
preamble signals through the N antennas. More specifically, the transmitter IFFT-<br>
processes a signal to be transmitted through antenna #0, serial converts the<br>
IFFT signals, converts the serial signal to an analog signal, RF-processes the<br>
analog signal, and transmits the RF signal through antenna #0. Additionally, the<br>
transmitter IFFT- processes a signal to be transmitted through antenna #1, serial<br>
converts the IFFT signals, converts the serial signal to an analog signal, RF-<br>
processes the analog signal, and transmits the RF signal through antenna #1.<br>
Accordingly, the transmitter IFFT- processes each of signals to be transmitted<br>
through the N respective antennas, serial converts the IFFT signals, converts the<br>
serial signal to an analog signal, RF-processes the analog signal, and transmits<br>
the RF signal through a corresponding antenna.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating an operation of a receiver using M receive<br>
antennas in an OFDM communication system according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 15, the receiver acquires M time-domain<br>
input signals by RF-processing a signal received through the M antennas,<br>
converting it to a digital signal, and parallel converting the digital signal in step<br>
1503.<br>
In step 1505, the receiver determines if it is time to receive preamble signals. If<br>
it is time to receive the preamble sequences, the receiver performs a multi-cell<br>
channel<br><br>
estimation on the M input signals. The resulting channel estimates are provided<br>
to the equalizers for the respective antennas, for use in demodulating the input<br>
signals.<br>
However, if it is not time to receive the preamble sequences, the receiver FFT-<br>
processes the M input signals, channel-compensates the FFT signals with the<br>
channel estimates, and decodes the M channel-compensated signals in a<br>
predetermined method, thereby producing one signal stream in step 1509. The<br>
receiver then recovers the original information bit stream by serializing the<br>
antenna signal and demodulating the serial signal.<br>
FIG. 16 is a detailed flowchart illustrating a multi-cell estimation step 1507 as il-<br>
lustrated in FIG. 15. Referring to FIG. 16, the receiver calculates a maximum<br>
number of accommodatable Node Bs, Ns , selects Ns preamble matrices<br>
according to reception power among known preamble matrices of a serving Node<br>
B and its neighboring Node Bs, and generates a multi-cell preamble matrix xs<br>
using the Ns preamble matrices in step 1603.<br>
In step 1605, the receiver calculates the pseudo-inverse of xs,<br><br>
The receiver generates a received signal matrix y by combining M signals<br>
received through the M antennas, y0, y1,.... YM-1 in step 1607.<br>
In step 1609, the receiver multiplies y by<br><br>
, thereby producing a channel estimate<br><br><br>
The receiver obtains a frequency-domain channel estimate<br><br>
by A-point FFT-processing<br><br>
in step 1611.<br>
FIG. 17 is a detailed flowchart illustrating a multi-cell preamble matrix generation<br>
step 1603 as illustrated in FIG. 16. Referring to FIG. 17, in step 1703, the<br>
receiver generates a preamble matrix for Node B #0,<br><br>
using known frequency-domain preamble information associated with Node B<br>
#0. Accordingly, the receiver generates time-domain preamble matrices for Node<br>
Bs #1 to #(NB-1).<br>
In step 1705, the receiver selects Ns Node B preamble matrices according to<br><br>
reception power among the NB Node B preamble matrices, and generates the<br>
multi-cell preamble matrix<br>
xs<br>
FIG. 18 is a detailed flowchart illustrating a Node B preamble matrix generation<br>
step 1703 as illustrated in FIG. 17. Referring to FIG. 18, in step 1803, the<br>
receiver generates a time-domain signal<br><br>
by IFFT-processing a known preamble signal<br><br>
for transmit antenna #0 and then generates (L-1) time-domain signals by<br>
cyclically shifting<br><br>
once to (L-1) times. In step 1805, the receiver generates a preamble matrix for<br>
Node B #0 by combining<br><br>
with the (L-1) cyclically-shifted signals. Similarly, preamble matrices are<br>
generated for the other Node Bs.<br><br>
Now the performance of the multi-cell channel estimator according to the<br>
present invention will be evaluated in the following graphical representations.<br>
• FIG. 19 is a graph illustrating a comparison in performance between an<br>
SCMLE (Single Cell Maximum Likelihood Estimator) and an MCMLE (Multi-Cell<br>
Maximum Likelihood Estimator) according to the total number of a serving<br>
Node B and its neighboring Node Bs. The SCMLE represents a single cell<br>
maximum likelihood estimator, as conventionally used, and the MCMLE<br>
represents a multi-cell maximum likelihood estimator. The performance of the<br>
MCMLE according to the present invention is evaluated in a system using 128<br>
subcarriers, when the number of Node Bs varies from 1 to 2 and 4.<br>
As noted from FIG. 19, when preambles are generated in the procedures<br>
described with reference to FIGs. 3 and 4, i. e., when orthogonal preambles<br>
are used, the SCMLE and the MCMLE both perform equally. Given non-<br>
orthogonal preambles, performance degradation is observed as the number<br>
of Node Bs increases. For the conventional SCMLE, severe inter-cellular<br>
interference significantly increases MSE (Mean Squared Error), whereas the<br>
MCMLE has the same performance despite the increase of inter- cellular<br>
interference. However, a different tendency will be shown if NB is less than Ns<br><br>
[137]	FIG. 20 is a graph illustrating another comparison in performance between the<br>
SCMLE and the MCMLE according to the total number of a serving Node B and its<br>
neighboring Node Bs. In FIG. 20, the number of accommodatable Node Bs is 4, which<br>
is less than that of a serving Node B and its neighboring Node Bs, which is 6. Four of<br>
six preambles are orthogonal and the other two preambles are non-orthogonal, thereby<br>
causing interference. As illustrated in FIG. 20, the SCMLE significantly suffers from<br>
the interference, while the MCMLE outperforms the SCMLE.<br>
[138]	In accordance with the present invention as described above, the use of a multi-cell<br>
estimation method, which removes inter-cellular interference, enables more accurate<br>
channel estimation and increases data demodulation performance as well in an OFDM<br>
communication system.<br>
[139]	While the present invention has been shown and described with reference to certain<br>
