The present invention relates to a coated optical fiber. The coated optical fiber comprises a cured coating prepared from a radiation curable composition having improved cure speed without deteriorating the yellowing performance of the cured coating. In particular, the radiation-curable composition of the present invention is a liquid curable composition that can be formulated for use in a wide variety of applications including, for example, coatings and/or binders. In particular, these curable compositions offer relatively fast cure speeds which offer advantages in many applications such as in the production of fiber optics. In the latter, production speeds make it desirable to utilize primary coatings (also called inner primary coatings), secondary coatings (also called outer primary coatings), matrix materials, bundling materials (all of which can be transparant or colored) and/or inks that can be cured rapidly. Moreover, the present invention relates to a radiation curable composition, to a cured coating and to a method of increasing the cure speed of a radiation curable composition.<br>
In the production of optical fibers, a resin coating is applied immediately after drawing of the glass fibers for protection and reinforcement of the glass fiber. Generally, two coatings are applied, a soft primary coating layer of a flexible resin (low modulus and low Tg) which is coated directly on the glass surface and a secondary coating layer of a rigid resin (higher modulus and higher Tg) which is provided over the primary coating layer. Often, the fibers for identification purposes will be ftirther coated with an ink, which is a curable resin comprising a colorant (such as a pigment and/or a dye), or the secondary coating may be a colored secondary coating (i.e, comprise a colorant).<br>
Several coated (and optionally inked) optical fibers can be bundled together to<br>
form a so-called optical fiber ribbon, e.g., four or eight coated 	<br><br>
(and optionally inked) optical fibers are arranged on a plane and secured with a binder to produce a ribbon structure having a rectangular cross section. Said binder material for binding several optical fibers to produce the optical fiber ribbon structure is called a ribbon matrix material. In addition, a material for the further binding of several optical fiber ribbons to produce multi-core optical fiber ribbons is called a bundling material.<br>
One of the most important characteristics required nowadays for curable resins used as coating materials (for protective or identification purposes) for optical fibers is to have a cure speed that is sufficiently high to be applicable at the currentiy used increasing optical fiber drawing speeds while still being cured thoroughly. Moreover, this improved cure speed should be obtained witiiout sacrificing the chemical and mechanical properties of the cured coating. At present, in the production of optical fibers and optical fiber assemblies, one of the limitations on how fast the production line can be operated is the cure speed of the coatings and/or binders. Accordingly, it is desirable to develop coatings and/or binders with faster cure speed.<br>
Besides having a high cure speed, the coating should preferably also fulfill many other requirements, in particular: exhibiting very little physical change over a long period of time and also over wide temperature ranges; having acceptable resistance to heat and light (and thus, showing acceptable aging properties such as a low degree of yellowing), to hydrolysis, to oil, and to chemicals such as acids and alkalis; absorbing only a relatively small amount of moisture and water; producing little hydrogen gas which adversely affects optical fibers; and the like.<br>
Resins that cure on exposure to radiation such as ultraviolet radiation are favored in the industry, due to their fast cure, enabling the coated fiber to be produced at high speed. In many of these radiation curable resin compositions, use is made of urethane oligomers having reactive terminal groups (such as an acrylate or methacrylate functionality, herein referred to as (meth)acrylate functionality) and a polymer backbone. Generally, these compositions may further comprise reactive diluents, photoinitiators, and optionally suitable additives.<br>
From WO 98/00351 it is known to use a mixture of two hydrogen abstraction free-radical photoinitiators and one Î±-cleavage, hemolytic free-radical photoinitiator, in particular a mixture of 1.5 wt.% benzophenone, 0.5 wL% benzil<br><br>
with sensitizer diethyl amine and 07 wt% Irgacure 651.<br>
Photoinitiator packages are commercially available e.g. Esacure KTO 46 (consisting of a benzophenone derivative, a phosphine oxide type photoinitiator and an oligomeric a-hydroxy acetophenone) and Esacure KIP 100 F that is a mixture of 70% of an oligomeric a-hydroxy acetophenone and 30% of dimethyl hydroxy acetophenone.<br>
So far, however, the known radiation-curable compositions, also those comprising a combination of photoinitiators in varying amounts, do not provide satisfying properties with respect to cure speed in combination with mechanical and aging properties of the resulting cured coating. Moreover, using a high amount of photoinitiator often results in drawbacks such as a relatively high amount of extractables, yellowing of the cured coating overtime, and other undesired properties.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a coated optical fiber comprising a cured coating prepared from a liquid curable resin composition which exhibits a fast cure speed without impairing mechanical properties and aging characteristics of the coating, in particular, a coated optical fiber comprising a cured coating having a relatively low yellowing is desired. A further object of the present invention is to provide a radiation curable composition having improved cure speed and a method of increasing the cure speed of a radiation curable composition.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a coated optical fiber comprising a glass optical fiber with a single protective coating or a combination of an inner and an outer primary coating applied thereon and optionally with a colored coating subsequentiy applied thereon wherein the inner primary coating or at least a portion of the single coating is prepared from a radiation curable composition which when applied and cured as a capillary film with a 100W medium pressure mercury lamp has a percentage reacted double bond unsaturation (%RDU), preferably a percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation (%RAU) of at least about 54% after exposure to a dose of about 4.4 mJ/cm2 or wherein the outer primary coating is prepared from a radiation curable composition which when cured as a capillary film with a 100W medium pressure mercury lamp has a percentage reacted double bond unsaturation (%RDU), preferably a percentage reacted<br><br>
acrylate unsaturation (%RAU) of at least about 56% after exposure to a dose of about 4.4 mJ/cm2.<br>
According to the present invention, at least one of said coatings is prepared from a radiation curable composition which \A/hen cured as a capillary film with a 100W medium pressure mercury lamp has a percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation of at least about 56% after exposure to a dose of about 4.4 mJ/cm2.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a radiation curable . composition comprising<br>
(A)	an oligomer,<br>
(B)	a reactive diluent, and<br>
(C)	a photoinitiator package of at least two free radical photoinitiators having an overall absorption spectrum in methanol which is the sum of the absorption spectra of each individual photoinitiator wherein said overall absorption spectrum has a minimum value of a molar extinction coefficient a in a range between<br>
280 nm (Î»1) and 320 nm (,Î»2) of at least about 600 lmor-1cm-1<br>
The invention also provides a radiation curable composition comprising<br>
(A)	an oligomer,<br>

(C)	at least three free radical photoinitiators wherein<br><br><br>
Suprisingly, the coated optical fiber of the present invention has good properties even if produced at extremely high line speeds whereas other coated optical fibers have inferior quality. In particular, the radiation curable composition according to the present invention overcomes all the drawbacks of the prior art composition by choosing combinations and amounts of photoinitiators in such a way that an improved cure speed can be obtained without substantially deteriorating mechanical properties and yellowing characteristics (including initial yellowing and yellowing upon aging).<br>
The composition is applied to a substrate and cured. The compositions of the invention are preferably designed for use as a colored or uncolored optical fiber single protective coating, primary (or inner primary) coating, secondary (or outer primary) coating or related optical fiber protective materials such as matrix or bundling materials. Such optical fiber coatings have their own set of unique performance requirements, which distinguish them from conventional applications.<br>
Finally, the present invention provides a cured coating and a method for increasing the cure speed of a radiation curable composition.<br>

Detailed description of the present invention<br>
The key element in obtaining the improved coated optical fiber of the present invention is the use of the radiation curable coating composition of the present invention having improved cure speed. Therefore, the description will further be directed to the radiation curable coating composition. Blends of oligomers, reactive diluents, and other ingredients such as release additives, colorants, and other conventional additives can be used to tailor the properties to achieve the design criteria for the given application.<br>
A key characteristic of the present invention is the ability to formulate compositions that exhibit improved cure speed without introducing a substantially higher sensitivity to yellowing over time and/or under different aging<br><br>
conditions. It is preferred to obtain an improved cure speed while at the meantime meeting or improving on the yellowing attributely demanded of fiber optic coatings. Although not wanting to be limited by any particular theory, it is believed that in one embodiment this results from the unique combination and optimization of oligomers, monomers (reactive diluents), photoinitiators, and stabilizers. The present inventors were the first ones to find out. after extensive formulating experiments, the improved oligomer/monomer/photoinitiator combinations resulting in the radiation curable coating composition of the present invention having improved cure speed.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention it is believed that the present improvements result from the presence of relatively low amounts of different photoinitiators having different absorption spectra. The different absorption characteristics of the initiators might improve the overall absorption of the incident light. However, the exact proportions of the photoinitiators giving maximum performance have to be determined by experimental measurements for each application. The present inventors were the first ones to find out, after extensive experimentation, the improved photoinitiator package of the present invention resulting in a radiation curable coating composition having improved cure speed.<br>
For the inner primary coating compositions of the present invention it is prefen'ed to choose the oligomer and monomer package and to improve the photoinitiator package in such a way as to achieve the required relatively high cure speed.<br>
The coated optical fiber and radiation curable compositions of the present invention are now described in more detail.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the coated optical fiber comprises a glass optical fiber with a single protective coating or a combination of an inner and an outer primary coating applied thereon and optionally with a colored coating subsequently applied thereon wherein at least one of said coatings is prepared from a radiation curable composition which when cured as a capillary film with a 100W medium pressure mercury lamp has a percentage reacted double bond unsaturation (%RDU), preferably a percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation (%RAU), of at least about 56% after exposure to a dose of about 4.4 mJ/cm2. For the acrylate based coatings of the present invention, we will further use the terminology %RAU, for covering the total percentage of reacted unsaturation bonds. If no other unsaturation is present than<br><br>
acrylate unsaturation, the %RAU is reflected. If other unsaturation is present in the composition, such as vinyl ether unsaturation, the %RAU given covers the total percentage reacted unsaturation, both from acrylate as vinylether origin. Surprisingly, the radiation curable composition of the present invention achieves a high %RAU after application of only a very small UV-dose.<br>
In order to detennine the %RAU, the radiation curable composition is applied as a liquid between two crystal plates in a FTIR (Fourier Transform Infra Red) instrument (herein referred to as a capillary film). This â implies that there is no substantial surface inhibition from oxygen in the air, but small amounts of dissolved oxygen might still be present in the sample. The capillary film of the radiation curable composition has a thickness "1" which is chosen as such as to fulfillthe Lambert-Beer law, see formula (1), meaning that the net absorbance A of (acrylate) unsaturation of the composition should be below 1.2, preferably in the 1.0 to 1.2 A range:<br>
log10lo/l = e .c,i=A	(1)<br>
lo and I are the intensities of the incident and transmitted light respectively, I is the path length of the absorbing solution in centimeters, and c is the concentration in moles/litre, log10 I0/I is called the absorbance or optical density. Therefore, depending on the concentration of acrylate bonds "c" and the "e" of the composition, the capillary film can have different thicknesses. The thickness'of the capillary film preferably lies between about 0.01 and 150 micron, more preferred between about 10 and about 100 micron, even more preferred between about 20 and about 75 micron, particulariy preferred between about 30 and about 60 micron, and most preferred, between about 40 and about 50 micron. The capillary film of the radiation curable composition is then UV-cured with a 100W medium pressure mercury lamp while measuring in real time-FTIR the surface or area under the "acrylate peak", further called the percentage unreacted acrylate unsaturation. As the "acrylate peak", the peak in real time-FTlR at a certain wavelength is chosen which shows no disturbing additional absorptions besides the acrylate unsaturation absorption, preferably the peak at 810 cm-1 when no other compounds are present that show strong absorbance at 810 cm-1 When using a 100W medium pressure mercury lamp, the energy on the coating area is adjusted to be about 22 mW. The decrease of the peak surface over time<br><br>
or as a function of the cure dose applied gives an indication of the cure speed. This method is described in more detail under the "Test methods" section.<br>
Suitable compositions include those having a percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation after exposure to a dose of 4.4 mJ/cm2 of at least about 56%, preferably, at least about 57%, more preferred, at least about 58%, particularly prefen-ed, at least about 60%, and most preferred, at least about 66%. Generally, the percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation after exposure to a dose of 4.4 mJ/cm2 is about 95% or less. However, a %RAU of about 90% or less is also acceptable.<br>
Preferred outer primary coating compositions include those having a percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation after exposure to a dose of 2.9 mJ/cm2 of at least about 49%, preferably, at least about 52%, more preferred, at least about 54%, particularly preferred, at least about 56%, and most preferred, at least about 62%. Generally, the percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation after exposure to a dose of 2.9 mJ/cm2 is about 95% or less. However, a %RAU of about 85% or less is also acceptable.<br>
Preferred inner primary coating compositions include those having a percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation after exposure to a dose of 2.9 mJ/cm2 of at least about 26%, preferably, at least about 30%, more prefen'ed, at least about 40%, particularly preferred, at least about 42%, and most preferred, at least about 55%. Generally, the percentage reacted acrylate unsaturation after exposure to a dose of 2.9 mJ/cm2 is about 95% or less. However, a %RAU of about 85% or less is also acceptable.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment the coated optical fiber of the present invention comprises at least a cured inner primary coating or at least a cured outer primary coating showing in addition to the relatively high cure speed a good yellowing performance over time.<br>
Preferred inner primary coatings having a relatively low amount of yellowing are those prepared from a radiation curable composition, which when applied as a 500 microns thick layer on a glass plate and cured at 1.0 J/cm2 under 0.2 m3/min of N2 and when having an outer primary coating subsequently applied and cured thereon, shows a color change AE of less than about 30 after aging for 8 weeks under low intensity fluorescent light. More prefenred is a color change AE after aging for 8 weeks under low intensity fluorescent light of about 20 or less, particulariy prefen-ed, about 15 or less, and most preferred, about 10 or less.<br><br>
The sample preparation for performing the above yellowing test (by applying a 500 microns thick layer on a glass plate as described in the "test methods" section) differs from the sample preparation (e.g. a capillary film) for measuring the %RAU.<br>
Prefenred outer primary coatings having a relatively low amount of yellowing are those prepared from a radiation curable composition, which when is applied as a 500 microns thick layer on a glass plate and cured at 1.0 J/cm2 under 0.2 m3/min of N2 shows a color change AE of less than about 20 after aging for 8 weeks under low intensity fluorescent light. More preferred is a color change AE after aging for 8 weeks under low intensity fluorescent light of about 17 or less, particularly preferred, about 15 or less, and most preferred, about 10 or less.<br>
According to another yellowing test, preferred outer primary coatings of the present invention having a relatively low amount of yellowing are those prepared from a radiation curable composition, which when is applied as a 500 microns thick layer on a glass plate and cured at 1.0 J/cm2 under 0.2 m3/min of N2 shows a color change AE of less than about 75 after aging for 8 weeks at a temperature of about 125Â°C. More preferred, less than about 73, particulariy preferred, less than about 70.<br>

This can be seen in Figure 1 which shows the absorption spectra in methanol of the photoinitiator packages used in the radiation-curable compositions of Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Experiment A,<br>

(C) Photoinitiator<br>
When the liquid curable resin composition of the present invention is cured by radiation, a photo-polymerization initiator is used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br><br>
photoinitiators (Ci) are free radical photoinitiators.<br>
Free-radical photoinitiators are generally divided into two classes according to the process by which the initiating radicals are formed. Compounds that undergo unimolecular bond cleavage upon irradiation are termed Type I or hemolytic photoinitiators. as shown by formula (5):<br><br>
Depending on the nature of the functional group and its location in the molecule relative to the carbonyl group, the fragmentation can take place at a bond adjacent to the carbonyl group (Î±-deavage), at a bond in the Î²-position (Î²-cieavage) or, in the case of particularly weak bonds (like C-S bonds or 0-0 bonds), elsewhere at a remote position. By far the most important fragmentation in photoinitiator molecules is the a-cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond between the carbonyl group and the alky! residue in alkyl aryl ketones which is known as the Norrish Type I reaction.<br>
If the excited state photoinitiator interacts with a second molecule (a coinitiator CO!) to generate radicals in a bimolecular reaction as shown by formula (6), the initiating system is termed a Type II photoinitiator. In general, the two main reaction pathways for Type II photoinitiators are hydrogen abstraction by the excited initiator or photoinduced electron transfer, followed by fragmentation. Bimolecular hydrogen abstraction is a typical reaction of diaryl ketones. Photoinduced electron transfer is a more general process which is not limited to a certain class of compounds.<br><br>

In contrast, suitable compositions for outer primary coatings, inks and matrix materials generally have a modulus of above 50 MPa, with outer primary coatings tending to have a modulus more particularly above 100 up to 1,000 MPa and matrix materials tending to be more particulariy between about 50 MPa to about 200 MPa for soft matrix materials, and between 200 to about 1500 MPa for hard matrix materials. The radiation-curable composition of the present invention may be formulated such that the composition after cure has a Tg between -70Â°C and 30Â°C. The Tg is measured as the peak tan-delta in a DMA curve at 2.5% elongation.<br>
Elongation and tensile strength of these materials can also be optimized depending on the design criteria for a particular use. For cured coatings fomried from radiation-curable compositions formulated for use as inner primary coatings on optical fibers, the elongation-at-break is typically greater than 65 %, preferably greater than 80 %. more preferably the elongation-at-break is at least 110%, more preferably at least 150% but not typically higher than 400%. For coatings formulated for outer primary coatings, inks and matrix materials the elongation-at-break is typically between 6% and 100%, and preferably higher than 10%.<br>
The glass transition temperature (Tg), measured as the peak tan-delta determined by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), can be optimized depending on the particulars of the application. The glass transition temperature may be from 10Â°C down to -70Â°C or lower, more preferably lower than 0Â°C for compositions formulated for use as inner primary coatings and 10Â°C to 120Â°C or higher, more preferably above 30Â°C, for compositions designed for use as outer primary coatings, inks and matrix materials.<br><br>

Test procedures<br>
Cure speed FTIR test (%RAU)<br>
The relative cure rates for ultraviolet cured coatings can be determined using FTIR transmission techniques. The method is applicable to coating systems that cure by loss of double bonds when exposed to ultraviolet light.<br><br>
Equipment:<br>
A Fourier transfomi infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer, Nicolet 60SX or equivalent instalment is used. Instrument parameters are: TGS detector, 4 cm-1 resolution and ten scans are co-added for each spectrum.<br>
Infrared spectrometry is now well known and any infrared spectrometer can be utilized to obtain the Infrared spectrum.<br>
A Mercury UV lamp, 100 W, Oriel Corp. #6281 or equivalent is used. Alternative UV lamp systems capable of producing controlled short pulses of radiation may be substituted.<br>
Sample preparation:<br>
A Teflon spacer is placed onto the surface of a clean NaCI transmission window. By using a tip of a disposable glass pipette, a small drop of thoroughly mixed coating is placed in the center of the NaCI disc. A second NaCI disc is placed carefully on top of the drop of coating such that the coating spreads evenly to the edge of the spacer and such that no air bubbles are present in the coating.<br>
Instrument set-up/standardization:<br>
The UV lamp is turned on, then the FTIR is turned on. A background spectrum is collected with no sample in the IR beam path.<br>
Procedure for analyzing samples:<br>
For a first analysis of a coating system a standard procedure is followed to ensure that the coating thickness is constant for any one coating system. The radiation curable composition is applied as a liquid between two crystal plates in a FTIR instrument (herein referred to as capillary film).<br>
The thickness of the capillary film is chosen as to fulfill the Lambert-Beer law, see formula (1), meaning that its net absorbance A should be below 1.2, preferably in the 1.0 to 1.2 A range. For the coatings according to the present invention a 50 micron spacer is used for achieving a constant thickness. Therefore, the net absorbance of the unsaturation band from the peak minimum to the peak maximum is measured. The peak maximum should be in the 1.0 to 1.2 A range. The net absorbance will depend on the peak minimum. For coatings based on acrylate chemistry, a peak in real time-FTIR at a certain wavelength is chosen which shows no disturbing additional absorption. For most acrylate-<br><br>
based coatings, the acrylate unsaturation band at 810 cm-1 and a baseline at the minimum near 795 cm-1 is used. This step is repeated three times and the average of the three absorbance values is taken as the net absorbance. This averaged value is used as a target absorbance for all future analyses of that particular coating system. This value is likely to differ for each coating system due to the differences in unsaturation content. The coating thickness is then adjusted by tightening the demountable cell holder screws until the net absorbance of the unsaturation band is within Â± 0.05 A of the above described averaged value for the net absorbance. Spectra are collected, one right after another, until the net absorbance value stabilizes (the coating may take a few minutes to reach equilibrium).<br>
Then, an infrared spectnjm of the uncured, liquid sample and an infrared spectrum of the cured sample are obtained by varying the exposure times between 0.05 and 5 seconds. Exposure times may vary depending on the coating system, for example, fast curing coating systems require shorter exposure times. The net peak area of the acrylate unsaturation absorbance for the uncured liquid sample is measured. For most acrylate-based coatings, the absorbance at about 810 cm-1 should be used. However, if the coating contains a siloxane or other component which absorbs strongly at or near 810 cm-1 an alternative acrylate absorbance peak can be used. The absorbances at about 1410 cm'-1 and about 1635 cm-1 have been found to be satisfactory. The net peak area can be measured using the well known baseline technique in which a baseline is drawn tangent to absorbance minima on either side of the peak. The area above the baseline and under the peak is the net peak area. Figure 3 gives a representation of the baseline technique and shows how the net area under the unsaturation band is detenmined.<br>
A reference area is then determined. The reference absorbance should not change in intensity as the liquid sample is cured. Many formulations have an absorbance in the range of about 780 to about 750 cm"' that can be used as a reference absorbance. The net peak area of the reference absorbance is measured. Both sample and reference are measured in triplicate for each exposure time.<br>
Calculations:<br>
The ratio of the acrylate absorbance to the reference<br><br>
absorbance for the uncured, liquid sample is determined using the following formula (7):<br>
RL = AAL/ARL	(7)<br>
where<br>
AAL is the net peak area of the acrylate absorbance (under the acrylate band),<br>
ARL is the net peak area of the reference absorbance, and<br>
RL is the area ratio for the liquid sample.<br>
The ratio of the acrylate absorbance to the reference absorbance for the cured sample is determined using the following fonnula (8):<br>
Re = AAC / ARC	(8)<br>
where<br>
AAC is the net peak area of the acrylate absorbance,<br>
ARC is the net peak area of the reference absorbance, and<br>
Re is the area ratio for the cured sample.<br>
The degree of cure as a percent reacted acrylate unsaturation (%RAU) is determined using the following formula (9):<br>
%RAU = [(RL - Re) x 100%] / RL	(9)<br>
If other reactive unsaturations are present in the coating composition, such as a vinyl ether unsaturation in the oligomer or reactive diluent, for example when vinyl caprolactam or vinyl pyrrolidone is present, it is the total percentage reacted double bond unsaturation (%RDU) which is measured.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, the term %RAU is used to relate also to the %RDU.<br>
The average %RAU is determined for the triplicate analyses for each time exposure for both sample and reference. The time of exposure are then plotted versus %RAU for both sample and reference.<br>
The precision of the data used to obtain the exposure time<br><br>
versus %RAU plot varies over the course of the plot. At exposure times where the curve is not steep, values Â± 2% (absolute) of the average value are acceptable. At exposure times where the curve is very steep, values Â± 7% (absolute) of the average value are acceptable.<br>
Yellowing tests:<br>
The color aging behavior (delta E) of the cured films was measured by conventional methods as disclosed in the publication entitled "A Measurement of the Contribution of UV Cured Coatings and Ink Binders Towards Color Change of UV Cured Inks" by D.M. Szum in Radtech Europe '93 Conference Proceedings (papers presented at the Radtech Europe Conference held May 2-6,1993), the complete disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. This publication discloses measurements which were performed on three layer samples, whereas the samples of the present invention were single layers. The measurement involves a mathematical manipulation. FMC-2.<br>
Yellowing measurements were carried out with film samples about 2X2 inches square. Color measurement data was obtained from a Macbeth Color Eye 7000-A. The colorimeter was calibrated and set to the following parameters:<br>
llluminant:  D65<br>
Color Difference: CIElab<br>
Mode: Reflectance<br>
Area of Measurement: Large Area View<br>
Specular Component: Included (SCI)<br>
UV filter: Included<br>
Observer: 10 degrees<br>
Background: White calibration standard<br>
Delta E (AE) Over Time<br>
i) under low intensity fluorescent light:<br>
Evaluation of AE for inner primary coatings: The AE value provides an indication of how stable the color of the subject composition is. The AE low intensity fluorescent test uses a three sample average, all measured on glass, prepared by curing a 500 microns thick radiation-curable composition of the present invention, formulated as an inner<br><br>
primary coating, on glass at 10 J/cm2 under 0.2 m3/min of N2 (not "a capillary film" as in the %RAU test). Then, a 75 microns thick standard outer primary coating of Comp. Exp. A was cured over the inner primary coating under the same conditions. Low intensity fluorescent light aging is done in a non-temperature-controlled room, under six eight foot long, 60 watt Phillips Econ-0-Watt fluorescent bulbs located approximately 3 meters from the samples.<br>
Weekly delta E (AE) values (degree of color change) were measured on a Mac Beth Color Eye 7000-A with parameters set as described above.<br>
The AE values given in Tables 1 and 3 are the values taken after 8 weeks storing under low intensity fluorescent light.<br>
Evaluation of AE for outer primary coatings: Same test conditions as described above for inner primary coatings, but sample was prepared by curing a 500 microns thick radiation-curable composition of the present invention, formulated as an outer primary coating, on glass at 1.0 J/cm2 under 0.2 m3/min of N2.<br>
ii)        under 125Â°C:<br>
The AE values were taken after 8 weeks storing of the samples at a temperature of 125Â°C. Sample preparations and test conditions are the same as described under i).<br>
iii)        under 85Â°C:<br>
The AE values were measured after 8 weeks storing of the samples at a temperature of 85Â°C. Sample preparations and test conditions are the same as described under i),<br>
iv)        under 85% RH and 85Â°C:<br>
The AE values were measured after 8 weeks storing of the samples under 85% relative humidity and at a temperature of 85Â°C. Sample preparations and test conditions are the same as described under i).<br>
Absorption spectra<br>
The UV spectrophotometer is a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 9. The<br><br>
samples of photoinitiators were njn as solutions in methanol at different concentrations. Example 1 at a concentration of 1.51 x 10-4, Example 2 at a concentration of 3.33 x 10-1, Example 3 at a concentration of 1.41 x 10-4. and Comparative Experiment A at a concentration of 3.24 x 10-4. All samples were run in 1.0 cm quartz cells with methanol in the reference beam. The scan speed was 120 nm/min and the slit width was 5 Î¼m. The absorption spectra are given as an absorbance versus wavelengthÎ» and derived from the absorbance A are the spectra of the molar extinction coefficient e versus wavelength X.<br>
The molar extinction coefficient 8 is a characteristic of each compound and is a constant value for a compound at a certain wavelength. The extinction coefficients were calculated from the absorbance at a certain wavelength of the absorption spectra of the photoinitiator packages in methanol. This was calculated from the Lambert-Beer law. Lambert's law states that the fraction of the incident light absorbed is independent of the intensity of the source. Beer's law states that the absorption is proportional to the number of absorbing molecules. From these laws the remaining variables give the Lambert-Beer law, as given by formula (10):<br>
log10 lo/l = e . c. 1 = A	(10)<br>
l o and I are the intensities of the incident and transmitted light respectively, I is the path length of the absorbing solution in centimeters, and c is the concentration in moles/litre, log10 lo/I is called the absorbance or optical density.<br>
Throughout the description, the absorption spectra and characteristics are defined by e, Xmax and absorbance. The wavelength Î» max defines a wavelength at which a maximum in the absorbance is reached.<br>
Figure 1 gives the absorption-spectra in methanol of the photoinitiator packages of Ex. 1 and 2 and Comparative Experiment A respectively. In particular, the extinction coefficient (which is calculated from the absorbance as described above) is plotted versus the wavelength. The extinction coefficient is independent from the concentration of the sample.<br><br><br><br>
