				<td>METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR DETECTING GLYPHOSATE AND<br>
METABOLITES THEREOF<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the detection of the presence or the amount of<br>
glyphosate and/or its metabolites in a variety of test matrices.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Glyphosate (DPX-B2856) is an active ingredient in non-selective herbicides<br>
which are widely used on crops that have been genetically modified for resistance to<br>
the herbicidal activity. Glyphosate inhibits the EPSPS (enolpyruvylshikimate-3-<br>
phosphate synthase) enzyme required for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in<br>
plants. Crop tolerance to glyphosate herbicides has been achieved by genetic<br>
modification of the plant with microbially derived EPSPS (enolpyruvylshikimate-3-<br>
phosphate synthase), GOX (glyphosate oxidoreductase), and glyat (glyphosate N-<br>
acetyltransferase) enzyme variants in plants. EPSPS variants disrupt the activity of<br>
glyphosate on the EPSPS enzyme, leaving intact glyphosate in the plant. GOX<br>
variants detoxify glyphosate by decarboxylation to AMPA. Glyat variants provide a<br>
new mode of glyphosate detoxification through enzymatic acetylation of the<br>
glyphosate molecule to form the non-phytotoxic metabolite N-acetylglyphosate. See,<br>
for example, Castle et al. (2004) Science 304:1151-1154. Regulatory monitoring for<br>
the presence and amount of glyphosate and glyphosate metabolites in a variety of test<br>
matrices including various animal and plant matrices are needed.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions which allow for the<br>
determination of the presence or the amount of glyphosate and its metabolites,<br>
derivatives or degradate residues in a variety of test matrices. The relevant glyphosate<br>
metabolites degradates included in the analytical method are N-acetylglyphosate, N-<br>
acetylaminomethylphosphonic acid (N-acetyl AMP A) and aminomethyl phosphonic<br>
acid (AMPA). N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA are novel glyphosate<br>
metabolites found in genetically modified plants containing a glyat (glyphosate N-<br>
acetyltransferase) gene. In one method, determining the presence or amounts of N-<br>
acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA in a test sample comprises providing the test<br>
sample suspected of containing N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA; extracting<br>
a composition comprising the N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA from the<br>
test sample; and, detecting the N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA in the<br>
composition.<br>
In other methods, the presence or amount of at least one of glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or AMPA or a metabolite thereof in a test<br>
sample is determined. This method comprises providing the test sample suspected of<br>
containing at least one of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA or AMPA<br>
or a metabolite thereof; extracting from the test sample a composition comprising at<br>
least one of the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA or AMPA, or a<br>
metabolite thereof; and, detecting at least one of the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate,<br>
N-acetyl AMPA or AMPA or a metabolite thereof. In specific embodiments, the<br>
detection of the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA or AMPA occurs<br>
without derivatization of the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA or<br>
AMPA.<br>

glyphosate 1,2-13C 15N stable isotope are equivalent at 5 ng/ml and showed<br>
consistent peak area responses (2074, 1885). Since AMPA is 5 ng/ml in<br>
glyphosate equivalents and AMPA 13C 15N is 5 ng/ml, the isotope peak<br>
response was consistent with the molar ratio of AMPA/glyphosate (111/169 =<br>
0.66 Ëœ 628/902).<br>

I. Overview<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions which allow for the<br>
determination of the presence or the amount of glyphosate and its metabolites and/or<br>
degradate residues in a variety of test matrices. Analytical methods exist for the<br>
analysis of glyphosate and AMPA in plants. See, for example, Cowell et al. (1986) J.<br>
Agric. Food Chem. 34:955-960; Alferness et al. (April 3, 1993) "Touchdown:<br>
Determination of Glyphosate and Aminomefhylphosphonic Acid in Corn Grain, Corn<br>
Forage, and Corn Fodder by Gas Chromatography and Mass-Selective Detection."<br>
Zeneca Ag Products Analytical Method RR 92-042B, available at U.S. EPA<br>
Pesticides: Analytical Methods &amp; Procedures website<br>
(www.epa.gov/oppbeadl/methods/raml2b.htm); and, Method No. 405 in Manual of<br>
Pesticide Residue Analysis Volume I and II available from BfR Federal Institure for<br>
Risk Assessment, official analytical methods for residues of plant protection products<br>
and pesticides (L 00.00 16) (www.bfr.bund.de/cd/1652). Such methods analyze<br>
glyphosate and AMPA only and further require analyte derivatization for detection.<br>
The methods and compositions of the present invention allow for the detection and/or<br>
quantitation of the new glyat metabolites, N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA,<br>
and further provide a combined, highly specific residue method for the quantitative<br>
and confirmatory analysis of glyphosate and relevant metabolites using LC/MS/MS<br>
technology without analyte derivatization. Further provided are novel methods for<br>
purifying glyphosate from various metabolites, such as from AMPA. Moreover, the<br>
methods and compositions of the instant invention further improve the overall<br>
response and linearity of glyphosate detection and/or its metabolites by employing a<br>
weak ion-pairing reagent, such as phosphoric acid, to prepare the final samples and<br>
standard solutions employed in the LC/MS/MS technology. In addition, the methods<br>
can employ extraction methods using an aqueous methanol/dilute acid solution that<br>
allow for an acceptable analyte extraction efficiency and can further employ the use<br>
of mass spectroscopy in positive ion mode. And finally, commercially available<br>
stable isotopes for glyphosate and AMPA can be used in the methods and<br>
compositions of the present invention as internal standards to normalize LC/MS/MS<br>
response for matrix effects. Thus, the novel methods and compositions of the present<br>
invention offer robust quantitative analysis of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-<br>
acetyl AMPA and AMPA without matrix effects.<br>
As used herein, an analyte of interest comprises at least one of glyphosate,<br>
N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and/or N-acetyl AMPA. As used herein the terms<br>
"glyphosate" or "N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine" refers to a compound having formula<br>
(I) as set forth below. <br>
The term "N-acetylglyphosate" or "N-Acetyl-N-(phosphonomethyl) glycine" refers to<br>
a compound having formula (II) as set forth below.<br>
<br>
The term "AMPA" or "aminomethyl phosphonic acid" or "1-aminomethylphosphonic<br>
acid" refers to a compound having formula (III) as set forth below.<br>
<br>
The term "N-acetyl AMPA" or "(Acetamidomethyl)phosphonic acid" or<br>
"N-Acetylaminomethylphosphonic acid" refers to a compound having formula (IV) as<br>
set forth below.<br>
<br>
Thus, the various methods and compositions for detecting the presence or quantity of<br>
glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and/or N-acetyl AMPA in a test sample are<br>
provided. The methods and compositions of the invention find use in monitoring the<br>
level of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, and/or AMPA in a variety<br>
of test samples including crops, crop raw agricultural commodities, and crop process<br>
fractions.<br>
II. Determining the Presence or Amount of at least one of Glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, or AMPA in a Test Sample<br>
Methods and compositions are provided for determining the presence or<br>
amount of N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA in a test sample. The method<br>
comprises providing a test sample suspected of containing N-acetylglyphosate and/or<br>
N-acetyl AMPA, extracting a composition comprising the N-acetylglyphosate and/or<br>
N-acetyl AMPA from the test sample; and, detecting the N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-<br>
acetyl AMPA in the extract.<br>
Methods and compositions are further provided for determining the presence<br>
or amount of at least one of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or<br>
AMPA or a metabolite thereof in a test sample. The methods comprise providing the<br>
test sample suspected of containing at least one of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-<br>
acetyl AMPA and/or AMPA or a metabolite thereof; extracting from the test sample a<br>
composition comprising at least one of the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl<br>
AMPA or AMPA or a metabolite thereof; and, detecting at least one of the<br>
glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA or AMPA or a metabolite thereof in<br>
the extract, where in specific embodiments, the detection of the glyphosate, the N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, the N-acetyl AMPA or the AMPA occurs without derivatization of<br>
the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or AMPA. In each matrix<br>
tested, such methods have a target limit of quantitation (LOQ) of the analytes of<br>
interest of 0.050 mg/kg (ppm) or 0.025 mg/kg (depending on the sample matrix) and<br>
are validated at 0.050 mg/kg and 0.50 mg/kg.<br>
As used herein, a "test sample" can include any sample that can contain one or<br>
more of the target analytes of interest. In some embodiments, the test sample<br>
comprises a biological sample or an environmental sample. Thus, test samples can be<br>
from an animal (such as a mammal, including, but not limited to an agricultural<br>
animal, a domestic animal, a dog, a cat, a horse, a human, and the like). In other<br>
embodiments, the test sample is not a bacterium, such as E. coli. In other<br>
embodiments, the test sample is from a plant.<br>
As used herein, the term "plant" includes plant cells, plant protoplasts, plant<br>
cell tissue cultures from which plants can be regenerated, plant calli, plant clumps,<br>
explants, plant tissues, forage, stover, hay, hulls, grits, and plant cells that are intact in<br>
plants or parts of plants such as embryos, pollen, ovules, seeds, leaves, flowers,<br>
branches, fruit, kernels, ears, cobs, husks, stalks, roots, root tips, anthers, and the like.<br>
Grain is intended to mean the mature seed produced by commercial growers for<br>
purposes other than growing or reproducing the species. Accordingly, a sample from<br>
a plant can be derived from any one part or multiple parts of the plant.<br>
Test samples derived from the plant can further comprise raw agricultural<br>
commodities (RAC) or can comprise a sample obtained during the manufacture of a<br>
plant or part thereof. Exemplary corn RACs include, for example, forage, grain and<br>
stover, while exemplary soybean RACs include, for example, forage, seed and hulls.<br>
In other embodiments, a test sample comprises a crop process fraction including solid<br>
process fractions or meal process fractions. Additional test samples can include flour,<br>

III. Extracting Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMP A, AMP A, and Other<br>
Metabolites From the Test Sample<br>
By "extracting" is intended any method that allows for the removal of the<br>
analyte of interest from the sample matrix or a sample derived therefrom. As used<br>
herein, the term "extraction" or derivations thereof does not necessarily refer to the<br>
removal of all materials or constituents other than the analyte(s) of interest from a<br>
sample matrix or a sample derived therefrom. Instead, in some embodiments, the<br>
term "extraction" refers to a procedure that enriches the amount of one or more<br>
analytes of interest relative to one or more other components present in the sample<br>
matrix or in a sample derived therefrom. In some embodiments, an "extraction"<br>
procedure can be used to remove one or more components of a sample that could<br>
interfere with the detection of the analyte, for example, one or more components that<br>
could interfere with detection of an analyte ion by mass spectrometry. In other<br>
embodiments, the extraction procedure is used to remove the analyte of interest from<br>
the test sample matrix, and in still other embodiments, the extraction procedure is<br>
used to purify a first analyte of interest away from a second analyte of interest in a<br>
sample or to purify an analyte of interest away from an interfering substance.<br>
Various extractions can be employed to extract or purify at least one of the<br>
analytes of interest (i.e., glyphosate, AMP A, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-<br>
acetylglyphosate) from the sample. Various dilute acids can be used including, for<br>
example, solutions comprising dilute formic acid solutions, dilute hydrochloric acid<br>
solutions, or dilute phosphoric acid solutions. In particular embodiments, the<br>
extraction employs, for example, solutions comprising about 96% aqueous 0.1%<br>
formic acid/4% methanol or about 96% aqueous 0.025N hydrochloric acid/ 4%<br>
methanol or about 0.1N HCL in 96% water/4% methanol or about 0.02M phosphoric<br>
acid. In still other embodiments, the extraction solution can comprise a dilute formic<br>
acid solution comprising about 0.01% to about 10% formic acid, about 0.01% to<br>
about 1% formic acid, about 0.1% to about 1% formic acid, or about 0.1% to about<br>
5% formic acid. In still other embodiments, the extraction solution can comprise a<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid solution comprising about 0.0025N to about 0.25N<br>
hydrochloric acid, about 0.025N to about 0.25N hydrochloric acid, about 0.0025N to<br>
about 0.025N hydrochloric acid. In further embodiments, the dilute phosphoric acid<br>
solution can comprise about 0.002M to about 0.2M phosphoric acid, about 0.002M to<br>
about 0.02M phosphoric acid, or about 2M to about 0.02M phosphoric acid. The<br>
extraction solution employed can vary depending on the test sample. For example,<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid can be used instead of formic acid to increase the acidity for<br>
more efficient extraction of -N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, AMPA and/or N-acetyl<br>
AMPA from various matrixes, such as corn flour and meal process fractions.<br>
Alternatively, dilute phosphoric acid can be used for an efficient extraction of<br>
N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate N-acetyl AMPA and/or AMPA from an oil test<br>
sample.<br>
In specific embodiments, the extraction is performed with an aqueous dilute<br>
acid/methanol solution. In further embodiments, the extraction method employed will<br>
be sufficient to allow for an analyte extraction efficiency from the matrix of at least<br>
50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 86%, 87%, 88%, 89%, 90%, 91%,<br>
92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%. In specific embodiments, the<br>
extraction efficiencies of the various analytes of interest are established through<br>
metabolism studies and not through surface application studies.<br>
Multiple liquid-liquid extractions can be performed to extract the analyte(s) of<br>
interest from the test sample, including 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or more. As outlined in further<br>
detail in the experimental section, it is further recognized that the extraction volume<br>
employed can vary depending on the moisture content of the matrix. For example,<br>
test samples with lower moisture content (i.e., stover, hay, hull, etc) may need larger<br>
extraction solution volumes and an increased number of extractions.<br>
Following the dilute acidic extraction, an additional extraction step can be<br>
employed to further purify the analytes of interest from various contaminates<br>
remaining in the sample. For example, an aqueous-organic extraction step can be<br>
performed, such as a dilute acid/methylene chloride partition. In such an extraction,<br>
the analytes of interest remain in the aqueous phase which can be subsequently<br>
applied to an extraction column. In specific embodiments, the dilute acid employed<br>
with the methylene chloride extraction comprises a dilute formic acid solution, a<br>
dilute hydrochloric acid solution, or a dilute phosphoric acid solution, as described<br>
above.<br>
One or more of the analytes of interest can further be extracted or purified<br>
from other components of the test sample or from one another by employing a solid<br>
phase extraction (SPE) column. As used herein, an "extraction column" is used to<br>
extract retained materials from non-retained materials and thus allows one to obtain a<br>
"purified" sample for further purification or analysis. Multiple extraction columns<br>
can also be used, including, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or more. In specific embodiments, the<br>
extracting or purifying step includes: (a) disposing the sample onto an extraction<br>
column; (b) washing the extraction column under conditions whereby the analyte(s)<br>
of interest is retained on the extraction column; and, (c) eluting the retained analyte(s)<br>
from the extraction column. In some embodiments, one or more of the extraction<br>
columns employed is a hydrophobic silica-based bonded phase extraction column<br>
(i.e., a C-18 column), a cation exchange extraction column (i.e., an m-divinylbenzene<br>
&amp; N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer, with sulfonic acid substituents) or an anion<br>
exchange extraction column (i.e., m-divinylbenzene &amp; N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer,<br>
with quaternary amine substituents) or a combination thereof. In one embodiment,<br>
one or more of the analytes of interest are extracted from the sample matrix<br>
employing a liquid-liquid extraction, an extraction column, or any combination<br>
thereof.<br>
Depending on the test sample employed and the analyte of interest, different<br>
extraction columns can be used to extract the analyte of interest (i.e., glyphosate,<br>
AMPA, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate) from the test sample matrix. For<br>
example, for the analysis of solid matrix sample extracts, following an aqueous-<br>
organic liquid-liquid extraction, as described above, a hydrophobic silica-based<br>
bonded phase extraction column can be used for the purification of glyphosate,<br>
AMPA, N-acetyl AMPA and N-acetylglyphosate. In specific embodiments, the<br>
hydrophobic silica-based bonded phase extraction column comprises a C18 extraction<br>
column. Additional extraction columns can be employed following the hydrophobic<br>
silica-based extraction column to further purify the analyte of interest.<br>
For some sample matrices, the use of a solid phase extraction step can occur<br>
with the dilute acid/methanol extraction step. For example, with a meat commodity<br>
matrix, a solid phase extraction sorbent (such as C18) can be added to the<br>
homogenized tissue sample. The homogenized tissue is mixed with the solid phase<br>
extraction sorbent and a dilute acid/methanol solution is added. Steps can be taken to<br>
elute and collect the analytes bound by the solid phase extraction sorbent.<br>
In still other embodiments, for milk and egg commodities, the test samples are<br>
mixed with aqueous 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v). Hexane is then added<br>
followed by centrifugation. A methylene chloride extraction is then performed on the<br>
aqueous layer. Two additional 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) extractions are<br>
then performed.<br>
In specific embodiments, prior to chromatographically separating the analyte<br>
of interest from the extracted test sample, a sufficient concentration of a weak-ion<br>
pairing reagent is added to the extract. A sufficient concentration of a weak-ion<br>
pairing reagent is a concentration that allows for an improved response and linearity<br>
of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMP A and/or AMP A. In specific<br>
embodiments, the weak-ion pairing reagent is phosphoric acid. In specific<br>
embodiments, final extracts are prepared in aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid and<br>
filtered prior to LC/MS/MS analysis. Glyphosate and AMPA stable isotopes can be<br>
added to final extract solutions as internal standards to normalize for matrix effects.<br>
1. Extracting AMPA from a Solid Matrix or an Animal Commodity<br>
In specific embodiments, an aliquot of the eluate from the hydrophobic silica-<br>
based extraction column is processed for the analysis of AMPA by disposing the<br>
hydrophobic silica-based extraction column eluate onto a cation exchange extraction<br>
column. In specific embodiments, the cation exchange extraction column has a<br>
surface functionality comprising a m-divinylbenzene &amp; Af-vinylpyrrolidone<br>
copolymer with sulfonic acid substituents. Non-limiting examples of cation exchange<br>
extraction columns that can be used include an MCX SPE column (Waters Oasis). As<br>
outlined in further detail elsewhere herein, various methods can be used to dispose the<br>
eluate of the hydrophobic silica-based extraction column onto the cation exchange<br>
extraction column.<br>
Accordingly, methods to extract or purify AMPA from a solid sample matrix<br>
can comprise: (a) extracting a composition comprising the AMPA from the test<br>
sample by liquid-liquid extraction; (b) disposing the composition comprising the<br>
AMPA of step (a) onto a hydrophobic silica-based bonded phase extraction column;<br>
(c) obtaining the elute comprising the AMPA from the extraction column of step (b);<br>
(d) disposing the eluate of step (c) onto a cation exchange column; (e) washing the<br>
extraction column under conditions whereby the AMPA is retained on the extraction<br>
column; and, (f) eluting the retained AMPA from the cation exchange extraction<br>
column. In specific embodiments, the extraction of the AMPA from the solid matrix<br>
sample comprises a dilute acid extraction followed by a methylene chloride partition.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, the test sample extraction is performed as<br>
follows. AMPA is extracted from a plant solid matrix into dilute aqueous acid (0.1%<br>
formic acid or 0.025N hydrochloric acid)/methanol (96/4) using a probe homogenizer.<br>
Multiple extractions (1, 2, 3, 4 or more ) are made for quantitative recovery of the<br>
analyte of interest. An aliquot of the filtered aqueous fraction is partitioned with<br>
methylene chloride and the aqueous fraction is recovered and filtered to remove<br>
particulates. An aliquot of the extract is then filtered through a C18 solid phase<br>
extraction (SPE) cartridge. An aliquot of the eluate collected from the C18 SPE<br>
cartridge is diluted and applied to a cation exchange Oasisâ„¢ MCX SPE cartridge,<br>
diluted, and filtered.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, the test sample comprises a meat tissue<br>
commodity, and the extraction is performed as follows. AMPA is extracted from a<br>
meat tissue commodity by (a) homogenizing the tissue; (b) adding a solid phase<br>
extraction sorbent, such as Cis, to the homogenized tissue; (c) adding 0.1N HCL in<br>
96% water/4% methanol; (d) centrifuging the sample and collecting the C]8 pellet; (e)<br>
eluting the analyte from the solid phase extraction sorbent with water. An aliquiot of<br>
the eluate is then applied to a cation Oasisâ„¢ MCX SPE cartridge.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, the test sample comprises a milk or egg<br>
commodity and the extraction is performed as follows. An aqueous 0.1% formic<br>
acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) solution is added to the sample. A hexane extraction is<br>
performed. A methylene chloride extraction is performed on the aqueous layer.<br>
Additional formic acid/methanol extractions (at least 1, 2, 3 or more) are performed<br>
on the aqueous layer. An aliquoit of the eluate is then applied to a cation Oasisâ„¢<br>
MCS SPE cartridge.<br>
ii. Extracting Glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate from a<br>
Solid Matrix or an Animal Commodity<br>
In other embodiments, an aliquot of the eluate from the hydrophobic silica-<br>
based extraction column is processed for the analysis of glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA<br>
and/or N-acetylglyphosate from a solid matrix. In specific embodiments, an aliquot of<br>
the hydrophobic silica-based extraction eluate is disposed onto an anion exchange<br>
extraction column. The anion exchange extraction column can comprise a surface<br>
functionality comprising a m-divinylbenzene &amp; N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer with<br>
quaternary amine substituents. Non-limiting examples of such anion exchange<br>
extraction columns include, a MAX SPE column. As outlined in further detail<br>
elsewhere herein, various methods can be used to dispose the eluate of the<br>
hydrophobic sililca-based extraction column onto the anion exchange extraction<br>
column. Briefly, an m-divinylbenzene &amp; N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer with<br>
quaternary amine substituents extraction column can be employed following an<br>
extract (adjusted to basic pH) in methanol for corn matrices, soybean forage, and hay<br>
matrices. In other methods, an m-divinylbenzene &amp; N-vinylpyrrolidone copolymer<br>
with quaternary amine substituents extraction column following an extract dilution in<br>
water procedure can be used for the analysis of soybean seed, meal, and hull matrices.<br>
Accordingly, methods to extract or purify glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or<br>
N-acetylglyphosate from a plant solid sample matrix can comprise: (a) extracting a<br>
composition comprising the glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate<br>
from the test sample by liquid-liquid extraction; (b) disposing the composition of step<br>
(a) onto a hydrophobic silica-based bonded phase extraction column; (c) obtaining the<br>
elute comprising the glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate from the<br>
extraction column of step (b); (d) disposing the eluate of step (c) onto an anion<br>
exchange column; (e) washing the extraction column under conditions whereby the<br>
glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate are retained on the extraction<br>
column; and, (f) eluting the retained glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-<br>
acetylglyphosate from the extraction column. In specific embodiments, the aqueous<br>
extraction of the glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate from the<br>
solid matrix sample is followed by a methylene chloride partition.<br>
In one non-limiting embodiment, the test sample extraction is performed as<br>
follows. Glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate are extracted from a<br>
plant solid matrix or a milk or egg commodity into dilute aqueous acid (0.1% formic<br>
acid or 0.025N hydrochloric acid)/methanol (96/4) using a probe homogenizer.<br>
Multiple extractions (1, 2, 3, 4 or more) are made for quantitative recovery of<br>
analytes. When employing a plant solid matrix sample extract, an aliquot of extract<br>
can be partitioned with methylene chloride and the aqueous fraction is recovered and<br>
filtered to remove particulates. When employing an egg or milk commodity, a hexane<br>
extraction step can be performed before the methylene chloride extraction. An aliquot<br>
of the extract is then filtered through a C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge. An<br>
aliquot of the eluate collected from the C18 SPE is diluted and applied to an anion<br>
exchange Oasisâ„¢ MAX SPE cartridge. The analytes are eluted from the MAX<br>
cartridge with 1% trifluoroacetic acid in methanol/water (9/1) solution following<br>
several solution rinses. The MAX eluate is evaporated to dryness and redissolved in<br>
aqueous 0.02M aqueous phosphoric acid, filtered, and analyzed for glyphosate, N-<br>
acetyl AMPA and/or N-acetylglyphosate. For the analysis of soybean samples (i.e.,<br>
seed and meal) following partitioning, extract samples can be heated in a steam bath<br>
for approximately 15 minutes to precipitate additional material in the extract prior to<br>
particulate filtration.<br>
In another non-limiting embodiment, the test sample is a meat commodity, and<br>
the sample extraction is performed as follows. Glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, and/or<br>
N-acetylglyphosate are extracted from the meat commodity by the homogenization of<br>
the tissue and the subsequent addition of the solid phase extraction sorbent, such as<br>
C18. 0. 1N HCL in 96% water/4% methanol is added to the sample. The sample is<br>
centrifudged, and the supernant is removed. The analyte is eluted from the solid<br>
phase extraction sorbent by the addition of water to the pellet. TEA is added to the<br>
sample, followed by an acetonitrile extraction. The sample is then loaded onto an<br>
Oasisâ„¢ MAX SPE cartridge. The column is washed and the analytes are eluted from<br>
the column using 1% TFA in methanol/water, 90/10. The MAX eluate is evaporated<br>
to dryness and redissolved in aqueous 0.02M aqueous phosphoric acid.<br>
iii. Extracting Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or AMP A<br>
from an Oil Sample<br>
In still other embodiments, when the test sample comprises an oil sample, a<br>
single procedure can be employed for the extraction and purification of all analytes of<br>
interest (glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, and AMPA). In such<br>
embodiments, an extraction column need not be employed. For example, the test<br>
sample can undergo a series of aqueous-organic extractions, such as, with a dilute<br>
acid or a weak ion-pairing reagent (such as 0.02M phosphoric acid) and methylene<br>
chloride. Following a sufficient number of extractions, the aqueous fraction is ready<br>
for the detection of the analyte of interest. The extraction can be repeated 2, 3, 4, 5 or<br>
more times for quantitative transfer of the analytes. Centrifugation can be used to<br>
define phase separation after each partition.<br>
Accordingly, methods are provided to extract glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate,<br>
N-acetyl AMPA and/or AMPA from an oil sample matrix comprising: (a) performing<br>
an aqueous-organic extraction of the test sample comprising (i) adding a sufficient<br>
concentration of a weak-ion pairing reagent or a dilute acid, such as phosphoric acid,<br>
to the test sample, wherein the sufficient concentration of the weak-ion pairing<br>
reagent or dilute acid allows for the improved response and linearity of glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA or AMPA; and, (ii) adding an organic solvent; (b)<br>
extracting the analyte of interest from the aqueous phase of the aqueous-organic<br>
partition; and, (c) repeating either of step (a) and/or step (b) a sufficient number of<br>
times to allow for the quantitative transfer of the analytes. In specific embodiments,<br>
the aqueous-organic extraction comprises a phosphoric acid/methylene chloride<br>
partition.<br>
IV. Determining the Presence or Amount of Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl<br>
AMPA, AMPA, and other Metabolites in a Test Sample.<br>
Following the extraction of one or more of the analyte(s) of interest from the<br>
test sample, any method can be employed that allows for the detection of one or more<br>
of the analytes of interest. In one embodiment, detecting one or more of the analytes<br>
of interest comprises separating (and in specific embodiments, chromatographically<br>
separating) at least one of the analytes of interest from the extracted test sample and<br>
analyzing at least one of the chromatographically separated analytes to determine the<br>
presence or amount of at least one of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA<br>
and/or AMPA in the test sample.<br>
i. Separating at Least One of Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl<br>
AMPA and/or AMPA from the Extracted Test Sample<br>
As used herein, "chromatographically separating" employs an "analytical<br>
column" or a "chromatography column" having sufficient chromatographic plates to<br>
effect a separation of the components of a test sample matrix. Preferably, the<br>
components eluted from the analytical column are separated in such a way to allow<br>
the presence or amount of an analyte(s) of interest to be determined. "Analytical<br>
columns" can be distinguished from "extraction columns," which typically are used to<br>
purify or extract retained materials from non-retained materials to obtain a "purified"<br>
sample for further purification or analysis.<br>
In specific embodiments, each of the analytes of interest (i.e., glyphosate,<br>
AMPA, N-acetyl AMPA or N-acetylglyphosate) is chromatographically separated<br>
from one another prior to detection. It is, however, recognized that depending on the<br>
method of detection employed, it may not be necessary to separate each of the<br>
analytes of interest from one another by chromatography. Such methods of detection<br>
allow each of the analytes of interest to be detected when present as a mixture.<br>
In specific embodiments, following the extraction step described in further<br>
detail above, chromatographically separating the analytes of interest includes: (a)<br>
disposing the composition comprising the extracted analyte(s) onto an analytical<br>
column; and (b) eluting the analyte(s) from the analytical column. In one<br>
embodiment, chromatographically separating the analytes of interest from one another<br>
or other constituents of the test sample comprises the use of a high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) column. Any HPLC column that can sufficiently resolve the<br>
analytes of interest and allow for their detection and/or quantitation can be employed.<br>
In specific embodiments, the HPLC column comprises a phenyl phase which employs<br>
a hexyl alkyl linker.<br>
ii. Detecting Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMP A, N-acetyl AMPA and<br>
other Metabolites<br>
By "detecting" is intended determining the presence or amount of an analyte<br>
of interest (i.e., glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA and/or AMP A) in a<br>
test sample. The method of detection is not restricted and may be either qualitative or<br>
quantitative. In one embodiment, detecting the glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-<br>
acetyl AMPA and/or AMPA comprises analyzing the chromatographically separated<br>
analytes by a mass spectrometer. In some non-limiting embodiments, separation<br>
and/or detection does not require the derivatization of the analyte of interest. In<br>
specific embodiments, positive ion mass spectroscopy is performed to detect the<br>
analyte of interest.<br>
The term "mass spectrometry" or "MS" as used herein generally refer to<br>
methods of filtering, detecting, and measuring ions based on their mass-to-charge<br>
ratio, or "m/z." In MS techniques, one or more molecules of interest are ionized, and<br>
the ions are subsequently introduced into a mass spectrographic instrument where,<br>
due to a combination of magnetic and electric fields, the ions follow a path in space<br>
that is dependent upon mass ("m") and charge ("z"). See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No.<br>
6,107,623, entitled "Methods and Apparatus for Tandem Mass Spectrometry," which<br>
is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In a "quadrupole" or "quadrupole ion trap" mass spectrographic instrument,<br>
ions in an oscillating radio frequency (RF) field experience a force proportional to the<br>
direct current (DC) potential applied between electrodes, the amplitude of the RF<br>
signal, and m/z. The voltage and amplitude can be selected so that only ions having a<br>
particular m/z travel the length of the quadrupole, while all other ions are deflected.<br>
Thus, quadrupole instruments can act as both a "mass filter" and as a "mass detector"<br>
for the ions injected into the instrument.<br>
Further, the resolution of the MS technique can be enhanced by using "tandem<br>
mass spectrometry," or "MS/MS." Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the name<br>
given to a group of mass spectrometric methods wherein "parent" ions generated from<br>
a sample are fragmented to yield one or more "daughter" ions, which are subsequently<br>
mass analyzed by a second MS procedure. MS/MS methods are useful for the<br>
analysis of complex mixtures, especially biological samples, in part because the<br>
specificity of MS/MS can minimize the need for extensive sample clean-up prior to<br>
mass spectral analysis. In an example of an MS/MS method, parent ions are<br>
generated from a sample and passed through a first mass filter to select those ions<br>
having a particular mass-to-charge ratio. These ions are then fragmented, typically by<br>
collisions with neutral gas molecules in a suitable ion collision cell, to yield daughter<br>
ions, the mass spectrum of which is recorded by a second mass analyzer. The<br>
daughter ion spectra so produced are indicative of the structure of the parent ion, and<br>
the two stages of mass filtering can eliminate ions from interfering species present in<br>
the conventional mass spectrum of a complex mixture.<br>
The most common type of MS/MS instrument is the triple quadrupole (see, for<br>
example, Yost, Enke in Ch. 8 of Tandem Mass Spectrometry, Ed. McLafferty, pub.<br>
John Wiley and Sons, 1983). Triple quadrupole MS/MS instruments typically consist<br>
of two quadrupole mass filters separated by a fragmentation means (i.e., a colison<br>
cell), (usually a quadrupole mass filter operated in the RF only mode as an ion<br>
containment device and containing a collision gas at a pressure of between 1 and 10<br>
millitorr). Many other types of "hybrid" tandem mass spectrometers are also known,<br>
however, including various combinations of magnetic sector analyzers and<br>
quadrupole filters. These hybrid instruments often comprise high resolution magnetic<br>
sector analyzers (i.e., analyzers comprising both magnetic and electrostatic sectors<br>
arranged in a double-focusing combination) as either or both of the mass filters. Use<br>
of high resolution mass filters is highly effective in reducing chemical noise to very<br>
low levels.<br>
The term "electron ionization" as used herein refers to methods in which one<br>
or more analytes of interest in a gaseous or vapor phase is interacted with a flow of<br>
electrons. Impact of the electrons with the analyte(s) produces analyte ions, which are<br>
then be subjected to a mass spectroscopy technique.<br>
The term "chemical ionization" as used herein refers to methods in which a<br>
reagent gas (e.g., ammonia) is subjected to electron impact, and analyte ions are<br>
formed by the interaction of reagent gas ions and analyte molecules.<br>
The term "fast atom bombardment" as used herein refers to methods in which<br>
a beam of high energy atoms (often Xe or Ar) impacts a non-volatile test sample,<br>
desorbing and ionizing molecules contained in the sample. Samples are dissolved in a<br>
viscous liquid matrix, such as glycerol, thioglycerol, m-nitrobenzyl alcohol, 18-<br>
crown-6 crown ether, 2-nitrophenyloctyl ether, sulfolane, diethanolamine, and<br>
triethanolamine. The choice of an appropriate matrix for a compound or sample is an<br>
empirical process.<br>
The term "field desorption" as used herein refers to methods in which a non-<br>
volatile test sample is placed on an ionization surface, and an intense electric field is<br>
used to generate analyte ions.<br>
The term "matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization," or "MALDI" as used<br>
herein refers to methods in which a non-volatile sample is exposed to laser irradiation,<br>
which desorbs and ionizes analytes in the sample by various ionization pathways,<br>
including photo-ionization, protonation, deprotonation, and cluster decay. For<br>
MALDI, the sample is mixed with an energy-absorbing matrix, which facilitates<br>
desorption of analyte molecules.<br>
The term "surface enhanced laser desorption ionization," or "SELDI" as used<br>
herein refers to another method in which a non-volatile sample is exposed to laser<br>
irradiation, which desorbs and ionizes analytes in the sample by various ionization<br>
pathways, including photo-ionization, protonation, deprotonation, and cluster decay.<br>
For SELDI, the sample is typically bound to a surface that preferentially retains one<br>
or more analytes of interest. As in MALDI, this process may also employ an energy-<br>
absorbing material to facilitate ionization.<br>
The term "electrospray ionization," or "ESI," as used herein refers to methods<br>
in which a solution is passed along a short length of capillary tube, to the end of<br>
which is applied a high positive or negative electrip potential. Solution reaching the<br>
end of the tube, is vaporized (nebulized) into a jet or spray of very small droplets of<br>
solution in solvent vapor. This mist of droplets flows through an evaporation<br>
chamber which is heated slightly to prevent condensation and to evaporate solvent.<br>
As the droplets get smaller the electrical surface charge density increases until such<br>
time that the natural repulsion between like charges causes ions as well as neutral<br>
molecules to be released.<br>
The term "Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization," or "APCI," as used<br>
herein refers to mass spectroscopy methods that are similar to ESI; however, APCI<br>
produces ions by ion-molecule reactions that occur within a plasma at atmospheric<br>
pressure. The plasma is maintained by an electric discharge between the spray<br>
capillary and a counter electrode. Then ions are typically extracted into the mass<br>
analyzer by use of a set of differentially pumped skimmer stages. A counterflow of<br>
dry and preheated N.sub.2 gas may be used to improve removal of solvent. The gas-<br>
phase ionization in APCI can be more effective than ESI for analyzing less-polar<br>
species.<br>
The term "Atmospheric Pressure Photoionization" ("APPI") as used herein<br>
refers to the form of mass spectroscopy where the mechanism for the photoionization<br>
of molecule M is photon absorption and electron ejection to form the molecular M+.<br>
Because the photon energy typically is just above the ionization potential, the<br>
molecular ion is less susceptible to dissociation. In many cases it may be possible to<br>
analyze samples without the need for chromatography, thus saving significant time<br>
and expense. In the presence of water vapor or protic solvents, the molecular ion can<br>
extract H to form MH+. This tends to occur if M has a high proton affinity. This does<br>
not affect quantitation accuracy because the sum of M+ and MH+ is constant. Drug<br>
compounds in protic solvents are usually observed as MH+, whereas nonpolar<br>
compounds such as naphthalene or testosterone usually form M+. Robb, D. B.,<br>
Covey, T. R. and Bruins, A.P. (2000): See, e.g., Robb et al., Atmospheric pressure<br>
photoionization: An ionization method for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.<br>
Anal. Chem. 72(15): 3653-3659.<br>
The term "inductively coupled plasma" as used herein refers to methods in<br>
which a sample is interacted with a partially ionized gas at a sufficiently high<br>
temperature to atomize and ionize most elements.<br>
The term "ionization" and "ionizing" as used herein refers to the process of<br>
generating an analyte ion having a net electrical charge equal to one or more electron<br>
units. Negative ions are those ions having a net negative charge of one or more<br>
electron units, while positive ions are those ions having a net positive charge of one or<br>
more electron units.<br>
The term "desorption" as used herein refers to the removal of an analyte from<br>
a surface and/or the entry of an analyte into a gaseous phase.<br>
In those embodiments, such as MS/MS, where precursor ions are isolated for<br>
further fragmentation, collision-induced dissociation ("CID") is often used to generate<br>
the fragment ions for further detection. In CID, precursor ions gain energy through<br>
collisions with an inert gas, and subsequently fragment by a process referred to as<br>
"unimolecular decomposition." Sufficient energy must be deposited in the precursor<br>
ion so that certain bonds within the ion can be broken due to increased vibrational<br>
energy.<br>
In some embodiments, one or more of the purification or separation steps can<br>
be preformed "online." As used herein, the term "online" refers to purification or<br>
separation steps that are performed in such a way that the test sample is disposed, e.g.,<br>
injected, into a system in which the various components of the system are<br>
operationally connected and, in some embodiments, in fluid communication with one<br>
another. Representative components of such online systems include, but are not<br>
limited to: an autosampler; one or more injection ports; one or more columns,<br>
including but not limited to, an extraction column, including an extraction column,<br>
and in some embodiments, an analytical column; a detection system, e.g., a mass<br>
spectrometer system; one or more pumps; one or more valves; and necessary<br>
plumbing. In such "online" systems, the test sample and/or analytes of interest can be<br>
passed from one component of the system to another without exiting the system, e.g.,<br>
without having to be collected and then disposed into another component of the<br>
system.<br>
In some embodiments, the online purification or separation method can be<br>
automated. In such embodiments, the steps can be performed without the need for<br>
operator intervention once the process is set-up and initiated. One of ordinary skill in<br>
the art also would appreciate that an online, automated procedure can include the use<br>
of software for controlling the various components of the system, including pumps,<br>
valves, autosamplers, and the like. Such software can be used to optimize the<br>
extraction process through the precise timing of sample and solute additions and flow<br>
rate.<br>
In contrast, the term "offline" refers to a purification, separation, or extraction<br>
procedure that is performed separately from subsequent purification or separation<br>
steps and/or analysis steps. In such offline procedures, the analytes of interests<br>
typically are separated, for example, on an extraction column or by liquid-liquid<br>
extraction, from the other components in the sample matrix and then collected for<br>
subsequent introduction into another chromatographic or detector system. Offline<br>
procedures typically require manual intervention on the part of the operator.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL<br>
Example 1<br>
In one embodiment, an analytical method was developed for the determination<br>
of glyphosate and relevant metabolites or degradate residues in transgenic crop and<br>
crop fraction matrices. The glyphosate metabolites or analytes are N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, aminomethyl phosphonic acid (AMPA) and N-acetyl AMPA. N-<br>
acetylglyphosate is a metabolite associated with transgenic crops containing the<br>
glyphosate N-acetyltransferase (glyat) enzyme. The method target limit of<br>
quantitation (LOQ) in each matrix examined was 0.050 mg/kg (ppm). The method<br>
was validated at 0.050 mg/kg and 0.50 mg/kg using a LC/MS/MS system operating<br>
with an electrospray interface (ESI) in positive ion mode detection. This analytical<br>
method was developed to support residue data collection required for registration of<br>
genetically modified crops.<br>
Raw agricultural and solid process fraction commodities derived from plants<br>
expressing GLYAT were extracted 3 times in acidic (0.1% formic acid or 0.025N<br>
hydrochloric acid) water/methanol (96/4) solution. An aliquot of extract was<br>
partitioned with methylene chloride and the aqueous fraction was recovered and<br>
filtered. An aliquot of the aqueous fraction was filtered through a C18 SPE cartridge.<br>
An aliquot of the eluate from the C18 SPE was diluted and applied to a MAX SPE<br>
cartridge. The analytes were eluted from the MAX sorbent in 1% TFA in<br>
methanol/water (9/1) solution following several solution rinses. The MAX eluate was<br>
evaporated to dryness and redissolved in aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid, filtered, and<br>
analyzed for glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA. A separate aliquot of<br>
the eluate from the C18 SPE was processed on a MCX SPE cartridge, diluted, filtered,<br>
and analyzed for AMPA.<br>
Processed oil commodities were partitioned with methylene chloride and<br>
aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid. The solution was centrifuged to resolve organic and<br>
aqueous fractions, and the aqueous fraction was collected. The remaining matrix and<br>
methylene chloride fraction were partitioned again with aqueous 0.02M phosphoric<br>
acid, and the aqueous fraction was collected and combined with the first aqueous<br>
fraction for quantitative recovery of the analytes. The combined aqueous extract was<br>
diluted, filtered, and analyzed for glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA<br>
and AMPA.<br>
Final extracts were analyzed using HPLC with reverse phase chromatography<br>
and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray source, operating in<br>
positive ion LC/MS/MS (liquid chromatograph/mass spectrometry/mass<br>
spectrometry) mode. Stable isotope standards of glyphosate (1,2-13C2 15N) and<br>
AMPA (13C 15N) were added just prior to LC/MS/MS analysis as needed for internal<br>
standards to normalize response for matrix effects.<br>
The recoveries from samples of various corn and soybean matrices fortified at<br>
0.050 mg/kg (LOQ) and 0.50 mg/kg (10xLOQ) support the satisfactory performance<br>
of this method. Tables 17 A, B and C, 18A and B, 19, 20, and 21 summarize the<br>
average recovery results for each analyte in sample matrices.<br>
Reference Analytical Standards<br>
Reference analytical standards of glyphosate (DPX-B2856-011, 96% pure)<br>
and N-acetylglyphosate, sodium salt (IN-MCX20-000, 67.4% pure as free acid) were<br>
obtained from Sigma Aldrich. Reference analytical standard of AMP A (IN-<br>

Example 2 - Principle of Analytical Method<br>
Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA were extracted<br>
from plant tissue and solid process fraction matrices of various crops into dilute<br>
aqueous acid (0.1% formic acid or 0.025N hydrochloric acid)/methanol (96/4) using a<br>
probe homogenizer. Dilute hydrochloric acid was substituted for formic acid to<br>
increase acidity for more efficient extraction of N-acetylglyphosate from corn flour<br>
and meal process fractions. Multiple extractions (3) were made for quantitative<br>
recovery of analytes and to eliminate moisture content in the matrix as a recovery<br>
factor. Additional extraction solution volumes were necessary for stover, hay, and<br>
hulls because of the lower moisture content in those matrices.<br>
Purification of glyphosate. N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA in solid<br>
matrix sample extracts:<br>
An aliquot of extract was partitioned with methylene chloride and the aqueous<br>
fraction was recovered and filtered (0.2-1.0 Âµm) to remove particulates.<br>
Approximately 10 ml of the aqueous fraction was collected following filtration<br>
through a C18 SPE cartridge. An aliquot of the eluate collected from the C18 SPE was<br>
diluted and applied to a MAX SPE cartridge. The analytes were eluted from the<br>
MAX sorbent in 1% TFA in methanol/water (9/1) solution following several solution<br>
rinses. The MAX eluate was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in aqueous 0.02M<br>
aqueous phosphoric acid, filtered, and analyzed for glyphosate and<br>
N-acetylglyphosate. A minor modification was made to this procedure for the<br>
analysis of soybean samples. For soybean seed and meal following partitioning,<br>
extract samples were heated in a steam bath for approximately 15 minutes to<br>
precipitate additional material in the extract prior to particulate filtration.<br>
Purification of AMP A in solid matrix sample extracts:<br>
A second aliquot of the eluate collected from the C18 SPE described above was<br>
processed through a MCX SPE cartridge, diluted, filtered and analyzed for AMPA. A<br>
separate analyte purification procedure was required for AMPA due to low recoveries<br>
using MAX SPE purification.<br>
Analysis of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate. AMPA and N-acetyl AMPA in oil<br>
samples:<br>
An aliquot of the sample was diluted with methylene chloride and the analytes<br>
were liquid-liquid partitioned into 0.02M aqueous phosphoric acid. The sample was<br>
partitioned twice for quantitative transfer of the analytes. Centrifugation was used to<br>
define phase separation in each partition.<br>
All final extracts were filtered (0.2 Âµm) prior to LC/MS/MS analysis to<br>
remove particulates as preventive maintenance measure for the HPLC system. The<br>
use of phosphoric acid in the final sample solution was shown to improve the overall<br>
response and linearity of glyphosate. The use of glyphosate and AMPA stable<br>
isotopes as internal standards in final extract solutions was required to normalize for<br>
matrix effects in the analysis of soybean matrices and is recommended for general use<br>
to improve method ruggedness. The stable isotope internal standards were initially<br>
added to final extracts just prior to LC/MS/MS analysis, but the procedure was<br>
modified for addition just prior to SPE purification to normalize for SPE performance<br>
and matrix effects. The stable isotope forms of glyphosate and AMPA used as<br>
internal standards behave identically to glyphosate and AMPA. The analytes were<br>
resolved by HPLC reverse-phase chromatography using a phenyl-hexyl analytical<br>
column coupled to electrospray ionization in positive ion mode with MS/MS<br>
detection. The same chromatography conditions were used for glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA analysis. Two molecular ion<br>
transitions were acquired for each analyte, except for AMPA (only 1 molecular ion<br>
transition was available in positive ion mode). Quantitative analysis was<br>
accomplished using a single molecular ion transition for each analyte. With the<br>
exception of AMPA, the relative abundance of the 2 detected MS/MS fragment ions<br>
provides confirmatory evidence for each analyte.<br>
Analytical Procedure<br>
Reasent Solutions<br>
Extraction Solution A: 96% aqueous 0.1% formic acid/4% methanol.<br>
Extraction Solution B: 96% aqueous 0.025N hydrochloric acid/4% methanol.<br>
80% or 95% Methanol in Water Solution<br>
0.1M Acetic Acid in 80% Methanol/Water Solution<br>
0.25% Ammonium Hydroxide in 95% Methanol/5% Water<br>
0.25% Ammonium Hydroxide in Water: Per liter volume, 10 ml of ammonium<br>
hydroxide solution (minimum 25%) was added to small volume of HPLC grade<br>
purified water, then diluted to final volume with HPLC grade purified water. This is a<br>
conditioning solution for MAX SPE (12 ml/sample, dilution in water procedure).<br>
Note: 1 ml of 25% ammonium hydroxide diluted to 100 ml Ëœ 0.25% NH4OH.<br>
Elution Solution, 1% TFA in 90% methanol/10% water.<br>
1.0M Phosphoric Acid Solution: Per 10 ml volume, 0.67 ml of concentrated<br>
phosphoric acid (min. 85%) was added to HPLC grade purified water in a 15-ml<br>
polypropylene centrifuge tube and dilute to final volume using gradations on tube<br>
with HPLC grade purified water.<br>
Sample and Standard Final Solution, aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid<br>
Aqueous 0.2M Formic Acid, aqueous mobile phase<br>
Stock Standard Preparation and Stability<br>
Standards with purity of greater than 95% were used. A minimum of<br>
approximately 10 mg of standard was weighed on an analytical balance that provides<br>
a weight precision to three significant figures, or the amount of standard was<br>
increased to satisfy this condition.<br>
Since residue tolerances are established in glyphosate free-acid equivalents,<br>
stock standard solutions for each analyte are prepared in glyphosate free-acid<br>
equivalents so that fortifications and recoveries can be determined in parent free acid<br>
equivalents. As needed, individual free-acid equivalent stock standards solutions<br>
were prepared were prepared for glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA or N-acetyl<br>
AMPA by adding appropriate amounts of standard to a 100-ml volumetric flask and<br>
diluting to final volume with water (water refers to HPLC grade or equivalent water).<br>
The following calculation and Table 25 provide guidance for the preparation of 100<br>
ml of a 100 Âµg/ml (ppm) in glyphosate free-acid equivalents for each analyte.<br>
<br>
Amounts weighed for each analyte were at least 10 mg and, therefore,<br>
individual analyte stock solution concentrations can exceed 100 Âµg/ml in parent free-<br>
acid equivalents. Stock standard solutions may be prepared at higher concentrations<br>
(not to exceed 1 mg/ml). A minimum standard weight of approximately 10 mg and<br>
final standard volume of at least 10 ml were observed. These solutions were stored at<br>
or below 4Â°C and are stable for at least 9 months.<br>
Internal Standard Preparation and Stability<br>
Glyphosate 1,2-13C2 15N and aminomethyl phosphonic acid 13C I5N (AMPA)<br>
stable isotope standards were supplied in amber ampules containing 1.1 ml of aqueous<br>
solution at a nominal concentration of 100 mg/L (Âµg/ml). Each standard solution was<br>
transferred to an individual amber vial and stored at or below 20Â°C in the dark. The<br>
isotopic purity was verified for each standard by analysis of an approximately<br>
500 ng/ml solution following protocol outlined below.<br>
An intermediate 100 ng/ml internal standard solution containing glyphosate<br>
and AMPA isotopes was prepared by diluting 100 ng/ml stock solution at a rate of<br>
0.1 ml in 100 ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid or HPLC grade purified water.<br>
Internal standards were included in final extract and calibration standard solutions at a<br>
rate of 50 ÂµL/ml or 5 ng/ml in the final solution volume. Each 100 ml of a 100 ng/ml<br>
standard solution can be used in up to 400 samples when 250 ÂµL of internal standard<br>
is applied in 5 ml of final extract.<br>
The 100 ng/ml standards (Glyphosate 1,2-13C2 15N, 100 ng/ml x 1.1 ml and<br>
Aminomethyl phosphonic acid 13C 15N (AMPA), 100 ng/ml x1.1 ml) were<br>
individually transferred to screwcap amber autosampler vials using glass transfer<br>
pipet. A 0.025ml aliquot of the 100 Âµg/ml standard was transferred to a 15 ml<br>
polypropylene centrifuge tube and diluted with 5 ml of 0.02M H3PO4 to prepare<br>
separate solutions at 500 ng/ml. A 0.10 ml aliquot of each 100 ng/ml standard was<br>
combined in a single 100 ml volumetric flask and diluted to volume with 0.02M<br>
H3PO4 to prepare a mixed solution at 100 ng/ml. This solution was divided into 2x50<br>
ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes. All standards were stored in refrigerator. The<br>
LC/MS/MS analysis of the 500 ng/ml solutions is shown in Figure 25.<br>
Intermediate and Fortification Standards Preparation and Stability<br>
Fortification solutions were prepared in glyphosate free-acid equivalent<br>
concentrations from dilutions of the individual stock solutions. If glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, AMPA or N-acetyl AMPA fortifications are required at levels<br>
greater than 0.5 mg/kg (10xLOQ), the individual stock standard solutions should be<br>
used to fortify samples. 10.0 ng/ml and 1.0 ng/ml fortification solutions were<br>
prepared for sample fortification at the 10xLOQ and LOQ, respectively. Alternative<br>
concentrations may be prepared as needed for other fortification levels.<br>
10.0 Âµg/ml Fortification Solution: The stock solution for each analyte was<br>
dilated appropriately into a common volumetric flask, diluted to volume with HPLC<br>
grade purified water, cap, and mix well. For example, 1.00 ml of a 100 ng/ml stock<br>
solution was combined for each required analyte in a 10-ml volumetric flask and<br>
diluted to final volume with water, cap, and mix well.<br>
Stock solutions concentrations will vary and the required volume of each<br>
analyte stock solution used to prepare fortification solution is adjusted for correct final<br>
concentration as determined using the following calculation.<br>
<br>
For example, to prepare 50 ml of a 10 Âµg/ml fortification solution from<br>
glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, and AMPA stock solutions prepared respectively at<br>
115 Âµg/ml, 186 Âµg/ml, and 206 Âµg/ml in glyphosate free-acid equivalent<br>
concentrations the following stock solution volumes was added to a 50-ml volumetric<br>
flask.<br>
Glyphosate = 10 Âµg/ml x 50 ml / 115 Âµg/ml = 4.35 ml stock solution<br>
N-acetylglyphosate = 10 Âµg/ml x 50 ml / 186 Âµg/ml = 2.69 ml stock solution<br>
AMPA = 10 Âµg/ml x 50 ml / 206 Âµg/ml = 2.42 ml stock solution<br>
10 ml Fortification Solution: The 10.0 Âµg/ml fortification solution (preferred) or the<br>
stock solution for each analyte was diluted appropriately with HPLC grade purified<br>
water into a common volumetric flask. For example, 1.0 ml of the 10.0 (Âµg/ml<br>
fortification solution was transferred to a 10 ml volumetric flask, dilute to volume<br>
with water, cap, and mix well. Store at or below 4Â°C and replace monthly.<br>
Chromatographic Standard Preparation and Stability<br>
Calibration standards were prepared in glyphosate free-acid equivalent<br>
concentrations from dilutions of fortification standards or individual stock standards.<br>
Glyphosate and AMPA stable isotopes can be used as internal standards in calibration<br>
standards and final extract solutions to normalize recoveries for matrix effects for<br>
sample analysis. A minimum of 5 or more calibration standards over a range from<br>
approximately 50% of LOQ equivalent final concentration to &gt;120% of the highest<br>
expected final sample concentration are recommended for quantification. AMPA<br>
analysis was conducted separately and had an LOQ equivalent final concentration of<br>
2.0 ng/ml. The LOQ equivalent final concentration for glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA was 1.0 ng/ml.<br>
For example, intermediate standard solutions of 10.0 ng/ml and 100 ng/ml<br>
were prepared from the 1.0 and 10.0 Âµg/ml fortification solutions, respectively, by<br>
diluting a 250 ÂµL aliquot to final volume of 25.0 ml in standard prep solution<br>
(aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid). Calibration standards were prepared from serial<br>
dilutions of these intermediate standards with the addition of internal standards as<br>
indicated in the following Table 26.<br>
<br>
Calibration standards were kept at or below 4Â°C and replaced at least biweekly.<br>
Calibration standards use may be extended if supported by stability test data.<br>
Source (&amp; Characterization) of Samples<br>
Corn forage, grain, and stover matrix test samples were collected from<br>
transgenic hybrid maize that contained the glyphosate acetyl transferase gene (glyat).<br>
Corn flour, starch, grits, refined oil (wet milled), meal (dry milled), and refined oil<br>
(dry milled) samples were processed and also collected. Soybean forage, seed, and<br>
hay were from soybean line containing glyat and collected from greenhouse plants.<br>
Soybean hulls were processed and soybean meal from a soybean line containing glyat<br>
was also prepared. Plums and limes were purchased at local supermarkets.<br>
Storaee &amp; Preparation of Samples<br>
All samples were stored at -20 Â± 5Â°C prior to sample preprocessing,<br>
extraction, and analysis. In preparation for analysis, the RAC samples were removed<br>
from frozen storage and ground frozen with dry ice using a HobartÂ® Food Processor<br>
(Model #84145) for forage and stover and a Quaker Grinding Mill (Model 4E) for<br>
grain. Samples were mixed extensively during the grinding process to ensure<br>
homogeneity. Most of the dry ice was allowed to sublime, and then the samples were<br>
returned to the freezer for storage until extraction and analysis. Process Fraction<br>
samples were homogenous when received and require no further preprocessing.<br>
Sample Fortification Procedure<br>
Untreated matrix control samples are fortified in extraction containers<br>
(250-ml bottles or 50-ml centrifuge tubes) as required in glyphosate free-acid<br>
equivalent concentrations. The 10.0 and 1.0 Âµg/ml Fortification Standards containing<br>
a mixture of test analytes were used to fortify test samples. Table 27 provides<br>
exemplary fortifications suitable for use with the presently disclosed methods.<br>
<br>
For each solid matrix sample, the appropriate amount was weighed into a<br>
clean 250-ml PPCO centrifuge bottle. For each oil sample, 2.0 Â± 0.02 g of sample<br>
was weighed into a clean 50-ml glass or polypropylene centrifuge tube. For dry<br>
commodities (e.g., stover, hay, hulls), the fortification aliquot should be diluted in<br>
5 ml of HPLC grade purified water in a vial or tube prior to fortification for better<br>
dispersion of the analytes in the matrix. After fortification, the solid matrix samples<br>
are allowed to stand in a fume hood for approximately 15 minute to allow the<br>
fortification solution to dissipate.<br>
Example 3 - Analvte Extraction Procedures<br>
Analyte extractions procedures are provided for solid matrices including corn<br>
PvACs (forage, grain, stover), corn process fractions (flour, grits, meal, starch),<br>
soybean RACs (forage, seed, hulls), and soybean process fractions (meal, hulls).<br>
Sample amount, extraction solution, and extraction solution volumes vary by<br>
commodity. Stover, hay, and hulls require 2x sample amount (10.0 g) and extract<br>
volume (200 ml) to compensate for dry commodity. Corn and soybean oil process<br>
fraction procedures are provided elsewhere herein.<br>
Solid Matrix Samples<br>
First Extraction<br>
1.0 Correct amount of sample was weighed into the appropriate container as<br>
indicated above.<br>
2.0 Samples were fortified as indicated above and solid matrices allowed to air dry<br>
in hood for 15 minutes.<br>
3.1 For forage, grain, seed, grits, starch, or soy meal samples, 50 ml of Extraction<br>
Solution A (96% aq. 0.1% formic acid/ 4% methanol) was added to sample.<br>
This step was applied to watery (e.g. plums) and acid (e.g. lime) crop types.<br>
For stover, hay, or hulls, 100 ml of Extraction Solution A (96% aq. 0.1%<br>
formic acid/4% methanol) was added to the sample. The tube or vial used to<br>
dilute the fortification solution to 5 ml was rinsed with the extraction solution<br>
for quantitative transfer of the analytes to the sample during this step for dry<br>
matrix samples.<br>
3.2 For corn meal or flour, 50 ml of Extraction Solution B (96% aq. 0.025N<br>
hydrochloric acid/4% methanol) was added to sample.<br>
4.0 The sample was capped and allowed to stand for 15 minutes so extraction<br>
solution can soak into matrix.<br>
5.0 The sample was uncapped and homogenized using a TissumizerÂ® for 2<br>
minutes at 40-50% of total motor speed or at a speed that efficiently<br>
homogenizes the samples without overheating or foaming.<br>
6.0 The samples were capped and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13,000 rpm to<br>
achieve sufficient clarification of supernatant.<br>
7.0 The supernatants were decanted into clean graduated cylinders (100 ml or 250<br>
ml as needed for final volume capacity). The supernatant may be decanted<br>
through paper filters to clarify extract solutions. Hulls were pressed with spoon<br>
or spatula when decanting to recover additional extraction solution (30-40 ml<br>
may be retained in the pellet).<br>
Second Extraction<br>
8.1 For forage, grain, seed, grits, starch, meal, or flour samples, 25 ml of<br>
Extraction Solution A (96% aq. 0.1% formic acid/ 4% methanol) was added to sample.<br>
Apply this step to watery (e.g. plum) and acid (e.g. lime) crop types. Note: the<br>
second and third extractions of meal and flour matrices use Extraction<br>
Solution A.<br>
8.2 For stover, hay, or hulls samples 50 ml of Extraction Solution A (96% aq.<br>
0.1% formic acid/4% methanol) was added to sample.<br>
9.0 Samples were homogenized using a TissumizerÂ® for 2 minutes at 40-50% of<br>
total motor speed or at a speed that efficiently homogenizes the samples<br>
without overheating or foaming.<br>
10.0 Samples were capped and centrifuged for 15 minutes at 13,000 rpm to achieve<br>
sufficient clarification of supernatant. The supernatant was decanted through<br>
paper filters to clarify extract solutions.<br>
11.0 Supernatants were decanted and combined to respective graduated cylinders.<br>
Third Extraction<br>
12.0 Repeat steps 8.1 thru 11.0<br>
13.1 For forage, grain, seed, grits, starch, meal, or flour samples the final extract<br>
volumes were adjusted to 100 ml with HPLC grade water or determine exact<br>
volume in excess of 100 ml. Apply this step to watery (e.g. plum) and acid<br>
(e.g. lime) crop types.<br>
13.2 For stover, hay, or hulls samples final extract volumes were adjusted to 200 ml<br>
with HPLC grade water or determine exact volume in excess of 200 ml.<br>
14.0 The supernatants were transferred to clean polypropylene bottles. The sample<br>
was poured back and forth from graduated cylinder to bottle to mix solution.<br>
Cap filled bottles. Raw extracts may be stored at or below 4 Â°C.<br>
Example 4 - Analyte Purification Procedures<br>
For the analysis of solid matrix sample extracts, methylene chloride partition<br>
and C18 SPE filtration procedures (as outlined below) were initially used for the<br>
purification of all analytes. An aliquot of the C18 SPE eluate was processed for the<br>
analysis of AMP A by strong cation exchange MCX SPE (as outlined below). A<br>
separate aliquot of the C18 SPE eluate was processed for the analysis of glyphosate<br>
and N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA by strong anion exchange MAX SPE (as<br>
outlined below). Separate procedures were required due to the characteristics and<br>
behavior of analytes on SPE stationery phases selected. For the analysis of oil<br>
process fractions, a single procedure was used for the extraction and purification of all<br>
analytes (see below).<br>
A. Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, and AMPA and N-acetyl AMPA Initial<br>
Purification Procedure in Solid Matrix Samples<br>
Methylene Chloride Partition<br>
1.0 30 ml sample extract was transferred to a 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge tube<br>
and 10 ml of methylene chloride was added to sample aliquot which was<br>
capped and shook or vortexed for at least 30 seconds (use gradations on tube<br>
for volume measurements). For soybean seed or meal, 20 ml of methylene<br>
chloride was used. Samples were centrifuged 10 minutes at sufficient rpm<br>
(e.g., 3000 rpm) to form distinct layers (aqueous above protein and methylene<br>
chloride). Smaller extract aliquots may be used to accommodate the<br>
individual analyte purification procedures (e.g., 15 ml of extract and 5 ml of<br>
methylene chloride when AMP A analysis not needed or to separate the 2<br>
purification procedures).<br>
2.1 For all solid matrices except soybean seed and meal, as much of the aqueous<br>
fraction was recovered as possible without disturbing the precipitate or<br>
methylene chloride layers and filtered through a 1.0 Âµm or smaller hydrophilic<br>
filter (nylon or glass microfiber) into a clean 50-ml polypropylene centrifuge<br>
tube. (The original centrifuge tubes were emptied and saved to collect waste<br>
extract in C18 SPE Filtration step 4.0). At least 15 ml of the aqueous fraction<br>
was recovered and filtered to use 14 ml for the following C18 SPE purification.<br>
Processing a smaller volume of extract may be helpful if filtration is difficult.<br>
Filtration is an important precondition for the ion exchange SPE<br>
performance.<br>
2.2 For soybean seed and meal samples, as much of the aqueous fraction was<br>
recovered as possible without disturbing the precipitate or methylene chloride<br>
layers and added to a clean glass tube. (The original centrifuge tubes were<br>
emptied and saved to collect waste extract in C18 SPE Filtration step 4.0). The<br>
aqueous extract samples were placed in a steam bath for at least 15 minutes to<br>
further precipitate matrix, then filtered through a 1.0-Âµm or smaller<br>
hydrophilic filter (nylon or glass microfiber) into a clean 50-ml polypropylene<br>
centrifuge tube.<br>
C18 SPE Filtration<br>
1.0 Waste collection tubes were installed in vacuum manifold to collect initial<br>
sample load volume. Note: waste collection tubes were used to prevent cross-<br>
contamination in the vacuum manifold during step 3.0.<br>
2.0 C18 SPE (6cc/500mg, Varian #12102052) cartridges were conditioned with 1<br>
ml of methanol, followed by 2 CV's (CV=6 ml) of Extraction Solution A<br>
(96% aq. 0.1% HCOOH/4% MeOH). Vacuum or positive pressure was<br>
applied as needed for slow drip rate (1-2 ml/min). Note: aqueous 0.2M formic<br>
acid may be substituted for Extraction Solution A for C18 SPE conditioning.<br>
3.0 As last of conditioning solution enters the sorbent, 4.0 ml of aqueous sample<br>
extract from Methylene Chloride Partition Purification step 2.0 was added<br>
onto SPE column.<br>
4.0 After dripping stops, the waste collection tubes were moved and clean 15-ml<br>
centrifuge tubes were installed. 10.0 ml of aqueous sample extract from step<br>
2.0 was added, eluted, and eluate collected. Extract solution may be stored at<br>
or below 4 Â°C.<br>
B. AMP A Purification Procedures for Solid Matrix Samples<br>
Two procedures were used for MCX SPE purification of AMPA. A MCX<br>
SPE Filtration Purification procedure was originally developed for corn matrices to<br>
filter matrix from extract with no retention of AMPA. Subsequently, a MCX SPE<br>
Purification procedure was developed to reduce matrix suppression with soybean<br>
matrices. The MCX SPE Purification Procedure is suitable for use with for all solid<br>
matrix samples. Purification procedure is also used for watery (e.g. plum) and acid<br>
(e.g. lime) crop types.<br>
AMPA MCX SPE Filtration Purification<br>
1.0 Oasis MCX SPE cartridge sequentially was conditioned with 1 CV (CV=6 ml)<br>
of methanol and 1 CV Extraction Solution A (96% Aq. 0.1% HCOOH/<br>
4% MeOH). Slight vacuum can be applied to control elution at slow drip<br>
(1-2 ml/min). Slight vacuum was applied or continued just until dripping<br>
stopped.<br>
2.0 15 ml centrifuge tubes were installed under SPE cartridges in vacuum<br>
manifold and 0.25 ml of 100 ng/ml internal standard was applied to top of<br>
sorbent bed in each SPF cartridge.<br>
3.0 4.0 ml of the C18 filtered extract was applied to MCX SPE cartridge. After<br>
dripping stopped, 4.0 ml of methanol was applied to MCX SPE cartridge.<br>
Slight vacuum may be applied, if necessary. Positive pressure or vacuum can<br>
be applied to recover methanol remaining on SPE cartridge.<br>
4.0 Samples were recovered from vacuum manifold and were evaporated to less<br>
than 4 ml on N-Evap at 45-50Â°C.<br>

C. Glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMP A Analyte Purification<br>
Procedures in Solid Matrix Samples<br>
Two procedures were applied to MAX SPE extracts purification for<br>
glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA analysis. A MAX SPE<br>
purification following extract (adjusted to basic pH) dilution in methanol procedure<br>
was generally used for corn matrices and soybean forage and hay matrices. MAX<br>
SPE purification with diulution in methanol can be used for acid (e.g. lime) crop<br>
types. A MAX SPE purification following extract dilution in water procedure was<br>
used for the analysis of soybean seed, meal, and hull matrices. A MAX SPE<br>
purification with dilution in water procedure was used for water (e.g. plum) crop<br>
types.<br>
MAX SPE Purification (Extract Dilution in Methanol Procedure<br>
1.0a Except for acid crops, 2.0 ml of C18 purified extract was transferred (from C18<br>
SPE Filtration, Step 4.0) to a 50-ml graduated centrifuge tube containing 80<br>
ÂµL ammonium hydroxide solution (minimum 25%) and 0.25 ml of 100 ng/ml<br>
internal standard, then dilute to approximately 20 ml with methanol.<br>
1.0b For acid crops, 2.0 ml of C18 purified extract (from C18 SPE Filtration, Step<br>
4.0) was transferred to a 50-ml graduated centrifuge tube containing 0.1 ml<br>
Triethylamine (TEA) and 0.25 ml of 100 ng/ml internal standard, then diluted<br>
to approximately 20 ml with methanol. Note: The volume of extract applied<br>
to the MAX SPE cartridge may be varied over range of 1. 0 to 4.0 ml. The<br>
amount of base added (ammonium hydroxide or TEA) should be adjusted<br>
appropriately and the amount of 100 ng/ml internal standard should be<br>
adjusted for any change to final extract volume in Step 8.0 (0.05 ml internal<br>
standard/ml of final extract volume), but the dilution to 20 ml with methanol,<br>
rinse volumes, and 8 ml elution should not be changed.<br>
2.0a Except for acid crops, MAX SPE (6 cc/500 mg) cartridges were conditioned<br>
with 1 CV (CV = 6 ml) of methanol, followed by 2 CV's of 0.25% ammonium<br>
hydroxide in 95% methanol/water solution. Vacuum was applied as needed to<br>
control flow to 2-5 ml/min.<br>
2.0b For acid crops, MAX SPE (6 cc/500 mg) cartridges were conditioned with 1<br>
CV (CV = 6 ml) of methanol, followed by 2 CV's of 0.1% TEA in<br>
80% methanol/water solution. Vacuum was applied as needed to control flow<br>
to 2-5 ml/min.<br>
3.0 As the last of the conditioning solution enters the sorbent, the base-adjusted<br>
sample extract solution was loaded (Step 1.0). May need to apply slight<br>
vacuum for grain samples, but keep drip rate slow.<br>
4.0 After the last of the sample solution enters the sorbent, sequentially 15 ml of<br>
80% methanol/water, 10 ml of 0.1M acetic acid in 80% methanol/water, and<br>
10 ml of 95% methanol/water was added to rinse the SPE cartridge. Note:<br>
The 15 ml of 80% methanol/water and the 10 ml of 0. 1M acetic acid were<br>
sequentially added to and dispensed from respective emptied sample extract<br>
tubes for quantitative transfer of sample extract to the SPE cartridges. The<br>
final 10 ml of 95% methanol/water rinse were applied directly to the SPE<br>
cartridge in 2 x 5 ml aliquots.<br>
5.0 After dripping stops, vacuum was increased briefly to remove excess solution<br>
from SPE sorbent, and collection vial or tubes in vacuum manifold were<br>
installed. Note: 50-ml glass centrifuge tubes (reused) or 20-ml glass<br>
scintillation vials (discarded after use) were used for sample collection.<br>
Collection container with flat, rounded, or gently sloped bottom for fastest<br>
evaporation were used.<br>
6.0 Analytes were eluted in 2 x 4 ml aliquots of Elution Solution (1% TFA in<br>
methanol/water, 90/10). Elute was performed by gravity feed. At least 5<br>
minutes after first aliquot passes through SPE cartridge was waited before<br>
adding the second aliquot. Positive pressure or vacuum was applied to recover<br>
methanol remaining on SPE cartridge.<br>
7.0 Samples were removed from SPE tank and evaporated to complete dryness on<br>
N-Evap at 45-50Â°C. Note: An additional 15 minutes of drying to insure TFA<br>
was completely evaporated was allowed.<br>
8.0 5.0 ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid was added to sample. Sample were<br>
capped, vortex mixed, sonicated at least 5 min, and vortex mixed. Note: If<br>
other volume of C18 extract was used (Step 1.0), the final extract volume and<br>
composition should be adjusted so concentration of analytes are consistent<br>
(e.g., if 1.0 ml of extract from C18 SPE were processed through this<br>
purification procedure, the final extract samples should be reconstituted in<br>
2.5 ml with the addition of O. 125 ml of 100 ng/ml internal standard in<br>
Step 1.0).<br>
9.0 An aliquot of the final extract solutions were filtered (0.2 -Âµm nylon) into an<br>
autosampler vial for LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
MAX SPE Purification (Extract Dilution in Water Procedure<br>
1.0 2.0 ml of C18 purified extract was transferred to a 50-ml graduated centrifuge<br>
tube containing 0.25 ml of 100ng/ml internal standard and diluted to<br>
approximately 20 ml with HPLC grade water. Note: The volume of extract<br>
applied to the MAX SPE cartridge may be varied over range of 1.0 to 4.0 ml.<br>
The amount of 100 ng/ml internal standard should be adjusted for any change<br>
to final extract volume in Step 8.0 (0.05-ml internal standard/ml of final<br>
extract volume), but the dilution to 20 ml with water, rinse volumes, and 8-ml<br>
elution should not be changed).<br>
2.0 MAX SPE (6cc/500mg) cartridges were conditioned with 1 CV (CV=6 ml) of<br>
methanol, followed by 2 CV's of 0.25% ammonium hydroxide in HPLC grade<br>
water. Vacuum was applied as needed to control flow to 2-5 ml/min.<br>
3.0 As the last of the conditioning solution entered the sorbent, the sample extract<br>
solution was loaded. May need to apply slight vacuum for grain samples, but<br>
keep drip rate slow.<br>
4.0 After the last of the sample solution entered the sorbent, sequentially 15 ml of<br>
80% methanol/water, 10 ml of 0.1M acetic acid in 80% methanol/water, and<br>
10 ml of 95% methanol/water was added to rinse the SPE cartridge. Note: The<br>
15 ml of 80% methanol/water and the 10 ml of 0. 1M acetic acid should be<br>
sequentially added to and dispensed from respective emptied sample extract<br>
tubes for quantitative transfer of sample extract to the SPE cartridges. The<br>
final 10 ml of 95% methanol/water rinse should be applied directly to the SPE<br>
cartridge in 2 x 5 ml aliquots.<br>
5.0 After dripping stops, vacuum was increased briefly to remove excess solution<br>
from SPE sorbent, then collection vials or tubes were installed in vacuum<br>
manifold. Note: 50-ml glass centrifuge tubes (reused) or 20 ml glass<br>
scintillation vials (discarded after use) were used for sample collection. Use<br>
collection container with flat, rounded, or gently sloped bottom for fastest<br>
evaporation.<br>
6.0 Analytes were eluted in 2 x 4 ml aliquots of Elution Solution (1% TFA in<br>
methanol/water, 90/10). Elution was by gravity feed. At least 5 minutes<br>
passed after first aliquot passed through SPE cartridge before the second<br>
aliquot was added. Positive pressure or vacuum was applied to recover<br>
methanol remaining on SPE cartridge.<br>
7.0 Samples were removed from SPE tank and evaporated to complete dryness on<br>
N-Evap at 45-50Â°C. Note: Allow additional 15 minutes of drying to insure<br>
TFA is completely evaporated.<br>
8.0 5ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid was added to sample. Sample was<br>
capped, vortex mixed, sonicated at least 5 min, and vortex mixed. Note: If<br>
other volume of C18 extract was used (step 1.0), the final extract volume and<br>
composition should be adjusted so concentration of analytes are consistent<br>
(e.g, if 1.0 ml of extract from C18 SPE were processed through this purification<br>
procedure, the final extract samples should be reconstituted in 2.5 ml with the<br>
addition of 1.25 ml of 100 ng/ml internal standard).<br>
9.0 An aliquot of the final extract solutions was filtered (0.2 nm nylon) into an<br>
autosampler vial for LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
D. Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, and AMP A and N-acetyl AMP A Extraction<br>
and Purification Procedure in Oil Matrix Samples<br>
1.0 For each sample 2.0 Â± 0.02 g of sample was weighed into a clean<br>
50-ml glass or polypropylene centrifuge tube.<br>
2.0 For Fortified Samples, samples were fortified appropriately as<br>
indicated above.<br>
3.0 15.0 ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid was added to sample.<br>
4.0 15.0 ml of methylene chloride was added to sample, which was then<br>
capped, vortex mixed for at least 30 seconds.<br>
5.0 Sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for approximately 10 minutes.<br>
6.0 Aqueous fraction was transferred to clean 50-ml graduated cylinder.<br>
(As much of the fraction as possible was recovered without disturbing<br>
the organic layer.)<br>
7.0 Another 15.0 ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid was added to<br>
sample, which was then capped, vortex mixed for at least 30 seconds.<br>
8.0 Sample was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for approximately 10 minutes.<br>
9.0 Aqueous fraction were combined with 1st partition in respective 50-ml<br>
graduated cylinder. (As much of the fraction as possible was<br>
recovered without disturbing the organic layer.<br>
10.0 Aqueous sample was diluted to 40 ml final volume with aqueous<br>
0.02M phosphoric acid.<br>
11.0 Final sample extract was transferred to clean bottle. (Sample was<br>
poured back and forth between graduated cylinder and bottle to insure<br>
homogeneity.)<br>
12.0 If stable isotope glyphosate and AMPA internal standards were used,<br>
the final sample was prepared by combining 4 ml of extract + 0.25 ml<br>
of 100 ng/ml IS + 0.75 ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid and<br>
sample was filtered (0.2 Âµm) prior to LC/MS/MS analysis. If stable<br>
isotope internal standards are not used, dilute 4 ml of the extract with<br>
1 ml of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid and filter (0.2 Âµm) prior to<br>
LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>

The Approximate Analyte Retention Times (ordered by retention time) shown in table<br>
28 are as follows:<br>
AMPA = 4.6 min<br>
glyphosate = 5.3 min<br>
N-acetyl AMPA = 7.1 min<br>
N-acetylglyphosate = 7.4 min<br>
Note: Analyte retention times can shift based on condition of the HPLC column and<br>
formic acid mobile phase. Expect retention times to shorten with column<br>
deterioration. Lower concentration of formic acid in the mobile phase extends the<br>
retention times and broadens the peak shape of the analytes.<br>
Calibration Procedures<br>
Standard mass spectrometer tuning and calibration techniques were used. If<br>
confidence in the mass calibration needed to be established (modern mass<br>
spectrometers under digital control generally do not need frequent mass calibration,<br>
especially for quantitative modes), vendor recommended calibrating solution was<br>
used. Optimization tuning of MS system may be accomplished by infusion of one or<br>
more of the test analytes. This method uses internal and external calibration<br>
standards, prepared as described above.<br>
Instrument calibration was based on the average response factor (analyte peak<br>
area response/analyte concentration) of external calibration standards using ExcelÂ®<br>
functions AVERAGE, STDEV (standard deviation), and RSD (relative standard<br>
deviation StDev/mean). For average response factor calibration, a %RSD of less than<br>
or equal to 20% should be observed. The linear regression response of external<br>
calibration standards using ExcelÂ® functions SLOPE, INTERCEPT, and RSQ (r-<br>
squared; the square of the Pearson product moment correlation coefficient determined<br>
using ExcelÂ® function RSQ) were monitored to establish calibration curve linearity.<br>
Acceptance criteria for valid quantitation are: (1) RSQ value &gt;0.99 for calibration<br>
curve and (2) the %RSD 
factors. Alternative approaches including linear regression with or without weighting<br>
(e.g., 1/X) may be used if they provide an equivalent or more consistent fit of sample<br>
response to the response of calibration standards.<br>
The nominal LC/MS/MS calibrated range for glyphosate and N-<br>
acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl AMPA was 0.5 - 20.0 ng/ml and for AMPA was 1.0 -<br>
50.0 ng/ml. The LOQ equivalent final extract concentration for glyphosate and N-<br>
acetylglyphosate analysis is 1.0 ng/ml. The LOQ equivalent final extract<br>
concentration for AMPA analysis is 2.0 ng/ml. Generally, 5 calibration solutions<br>
were analyzed for quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis (a minimum of 4 calibration<br>
solutions are required).<br>
Net recoveries may be calculated for fortified samples only (not acceptable for<br>
field samples). Net recoveries may be calculated and reported only when residues in<br>
the control sample are integrable and 
are &gt;50% of the LOQ, the recovery samples prepared at the LOQ using that control<br>
are invalidated. When the control residues are 
(mg/kg) found in fortified samples are calculated by subtracting area counts found in<br>
the control from area counts found in fortified samples. If net recoveries are<br>
calculated, those results must be uniquely identified or presented in a separate<br>
spreadsheet column heading for corrected ppm (mg/kg).<br>
Sample Analysis<br>
Preliminary runs of at least 2 calibration standards were routinely made to<br>
demonstrate adequate instrument response and insure the LC/MS/MS system was<br>
equilibrated. If multiple sets were analyzed, a solvent blank injection was made<br>
between the last and first injections of the sets to minimize risk of carryover between<br>
sets. Calibration standard analyses preceded the first sample analysis and follow the<br>
last sample analysis so sample analyses were contained within the external standard<br>
calibration. Generally, the injection sequence was organized from lowest to highest<br>
expected analyte concentrations. Calibration standard runs were intermixed with the<br>
test samples and can be analyzed before and after every 1-3 samples in each<br>
analytical set. Extracts and calibration standards were be refrigerated if stored.<br>
Generally, fortification sample recoveries (70-120%) are required for acceptable<br>
quantitation results in an analysis set.<br>
Calculations<br>
Methods<br>
Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, and AMPA and N-acetyl AMPA residues<br>
were measured as mg/kg (ppm) glyphosate free-acid equivalents in crop matrices.<br>
Quantitation was based on an average response factor determined from the multiple<br>
calibration standards concurrently analyzed with sample extracts. All calculations<br>
were made using unrounded values that were reported to two significant figures.<br>
Fortified sample recoveries were reported to the nearest whole number percentage<br>

<br>
Results<br>
Detector Response<br>
A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using positive ion ESI and tandem<br>
mass spectrometry detection was used for sample extract analysis. Full-Scan total ion<br>
and MRM spectra for glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, and AMPA and N-acetyl<br>
AMPA from analysis of standard solutions are provided in Fig. 1- Fig. 3, respectively.<br>
Calibration standards typically yielded a linear response (r2 &gt;0.99) with %RSD<br>

range of 0.5-20 ng/ml for glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate or 1.0-50 ng/ml for<br>
AMPA. Representative calibration curves for each analyte were constructed using<br>
calibration standards from validation sets including expanded range of 0.5-100 ng/ml<br>
and are presented in Fig. 4 Representative ion chromatograms of Calibration<br>
Standards are provided in Fig. 6. Representative ion chromatograms of stable isotope<br>
glyphosate and AMPA standards are provided in Fig. 25.<br>
Representative chromatograms of extracts from an untreated control sample, a<br>
0.050 ppm (LOQ) fortification sample, and a 0.50 ppm fortification sample are<br>
provided in Fig. 8-Fig. 21 for corn and soybean matrices.<br>
Controls<br>
No significant matrix interference was observed at the chromatographic<br>
retention times of glyphosate, AMPA, or N-acetylglyphosate elution in<br>
chromatograms of control extracts for corn and soybean matrices. Because<br>
genetically modified plants and glyphosate containing herbicides are widely used in<br>
soybean crop grown in the U.S., commercially available samples (including organic)<br>
generally contain glyphosate and AMPA residues. Soybean control samples used in<br>
this study were untreated controls from field plots in regulatory studies.<br>
Recoveries (Accuracy &amp; Precision)<br>
Recovery results for com matrices are provided in Tables 1 - Table 8 (forage,<br>
grain, stover, oil, flour, grits, starch, and meal, respectively). Recovery results for<br>
soybean matrices are provided in Table 9 - Table 14 (forage, seed, hay, oil, meal, and<br>
hulls, respectively). The average results at the 0.050 mg/kg (LOQ) and 0.50 mg/kg<br>
fortification levels with overall results in corn and soybean matrices are provided in<br>
tables in the Summary section. Representative recovery results from individual<br>
sample set analyses for corn grain, corn oil, soybean seed, and soybean meal are<br>
provided in Tables 30-40.<br>
Extraction Efficiency<br>
In the metabolism study, corn forage, grain, or stover samples were extracted<br>
3 times in 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v:v) using tissumizer homogenization<br>
and wrist-action shaker. The greatest extract to sample ratio applied in the procedure<br>
was 6 to 1 (150 ml to 25 g), although the ratio varied by commodity and extraction<br>
repetition.<br>
In this residue analytical method, the sample size was reduced to 5.0 g and the<br>
solvent to sample ratio for each commodity and repetition was at least 5 to 1. Table<br>
41 contrasts the sample amounts and ratios used in metabolism and residue methods<br>
for each matrix.<br>
<br>
The extraction procedure in this residue analytical method is consistent with or<br>
exceeds the extraction procedure applied to quantitatively extract glyphosate related<br>
residues from crops.<br>
Incurred residue samples from regulatory field studies were analyzed for<br>
glyphosate and AMPA residues by a post-column derivatization fluorescence (PCD-<br>
fluor) method (Cowell et al. (1986) J. Agric. Food Chern. 34:955-960) in the original<br>
studies and by this LC/MS/MS method. The corn in these studies contained the<br>
EPSPS enzyme variant genetic modification and therefore the N-acetylglyphosate<br>
metabolite was not formed. Table 42 summarizes results in mg/kg (ppm) glyphosate<br>
free-acid equivalents for untreated (control) and treated corn grain samples collected<br>
from 2 test sites.<br>
<br>
Table 43 summarizes results in mg/kg (ppm) glyphosate free-acid equivalents for<br>
untreated (control) and treated corn grain, forage, and stover samples collected from 2<br>
test sites of the field study.<br>
<br>
Analytical results from both methods indicate consistent results for glyphosate<br>
and AMPA in corn and support the extraction efficiency for the analytical method.<br>
Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)<br>
The LOQ validated in this method was 0.050 ppm (mg/kg) for glyphosate, N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, and AMPA in corn and soybean matrices. The LOQ is defined as<br>
the lowest fortification level at which average recoveries of 70-120% and a RSD<br>

consistently represents a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5-20 to 1 for the least<br>
responsive analyte, AMPA.<br>
Background Evaluation<br>
Background levels experienced in tandem mass spectrometry analyses are<br>
minimal. Generally, the chromatographic profiles of a sample extract solution and a<br>
calibration standard solution appear the same. The control sample chromatograms for<br>
each matrix tested are provided in Figure 9-Figure 21.<br>
Limit of Detection (LOD)<br>
The LOD is defined as the analyte concentration in matrix with a response<br>
equivalent to a signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) of approximately 3 to 1. The LOD was<br>
estimated from the s/n response determined in a LOQ fortification sample using the<br>
following equation for each analyte.<br>
<br>
The LOD estimates for were 0.004 mg/kg for glyphosate, 0.006 mg/kg for N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, and 0.007 mg/kg for AMPA and 0.006 mg/kg for N-acetyl AMPA.<br>
The individual chromatograms showing s/n determination and calculated estimates for<br>
each analyte are provided in Figure 26. Variation in the LOD was observed and each<br>
lab using this method should estimate an LOD value.<br>
Two independent MS/MS transitions of the molecular ion for glyphosate and<br>
N-acetylglyphosate were monitored. The relative response ratios of the two fragment<br>
ions (base peak/secondary peak) were determined from calibration standard responses<br>
for confirmation of analyte in matrix samples. Acceptable confirmation criteria are a<br>
co-eluting peak (+ 5%) and equivalent ion ratio (Â± 30%) compared to the average<br>
response observed in calibration standards at or above the LOQ equivalent<br>
concentration concurrently analyzed with the samples. The calculated response ratios<br>
and retention times for each analyte determined in an analysis set are shown in Tables<br>
43-48. Confirmation for glyphosate and AMPA can be determined using existing<br>
regulatory methods. See, for example, Cowell et al. (1986) J. Agric. Food Chem. 34:<br>

Additional validation trials for this method were conducted. Glyphosate,<br>
Af-acetylglyphosate, and AMPA were fortified at 0.050 and 0.50 ppm levels in corn<br>
(forage, grain, and stover) and soybean (forage, seed, and hay) matrices. A<br>
VirTishearâ„¢ (Virtis Company Inc., Gardiner, NY) homogenizer was used instead of a<br>
Tissumizerâ„¢ homogenizer to macerate tissues during extraction. An Applied<br>
Biosystems/MDS SCIEX API 4000 mass spectrometer was used instead of the<br>
Quattro Premier. Injection volumes were increased to compensate for decreased mass<br>
spectrometer sensitivity. Acceptable results were found. Data not shown. The API<br>
4000 LC-MS/MS System instrumental conditions are provided in Table 49 and Figure<br>
27-30.<br>
In summary, the analytical methods presently disclosed are suitable for the<br>
quantitation of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, and AMPA and /V-acetyl AMPA<br>
residues in corn and soybean matrices. The results support an LOQ of 0.050 mg/kg<br>
(ppm) with estimated LOD values of 0.004 mg/kg for glyphosate, 0.006 mg/kg for iV-<br>
acetylglyphosate, and 0.007 mg/kg for AMPA.<br>
This analytical method procedure was successfully applied to plum and lime<br>
matrices to demonstrate suitability in watery and acidic crop matrices, respectively,<br>
even though these crop types do not contain the gat trait and N-acetylglyphosate.<br>
Overall average recoveries for each analyte and matrix in the validation trials<br>
ranged from 75% (glyphosate in soybean hulls) to 109% (AMPA in soybean oil) with<br>
maximum RSD of 19% (AMPA in corn oil).<br>
Residue confirmation for glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate was<br>
demonstrated at 0.050 mg/kg (LOQ) and 0.50 mg/kg fortification levels based on<br>
retention time and the relative ratios of two MS/MS parent-to-fragment ion transitions<br>
detected during sample analysis.<br>
Example 6.<br>
Summary<br>
/V-acetylglyphosate, aminomethyl-phosphonic acid (AMPA), and N-acetyl<br>
aminomethylphosphonic acid (/V-acetyl AMPA) were examined. This study was<br>
designed to demonstrate the utility, ruggedness, and efficiency of the method. The<br>
method is designed to measure glyphosate and metabolites in plant matrices with a<br>
limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 0.05 ppm. The method's reported LOQ of 0.05 ppm in<br>
glyphosate equivalents for both glyphosate and metabolites was confirmed by<br>
obtaining individual recoveries within the acceptable range of 70 to 120% for controls<br>
fortified five times at 0.05 ppm in grapes and soybean seed.<br>
Performance of the subject method was successfully validated for the<br>
quantitation of glyphosate and metabolites in grapes and soybean seed at the method<br>
LOQ and respective tolerance levels for each matrix. The method was successfully<br>
validated in grapes with one trial. Two trials were required for successful validation<br>
of soybean seed. A summary of the results is presented in the following table.<br>
<br>
A minor method modification made during the course of this method was to<br>
dilute the final soybean seed extracts of the 20 ppm fortification samples 100-fold<br>
prior to LC/MS/MS analysis to adjust residue concentrations within the calibration<br>
curve. Instrument parameters were also adjusted to increase sensitivity.<br>
This LC/MS/MS method with multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection<br>
was free of interferences at the retention times corresponding to glyphosate and<br>
metabolites in unfortified samples. Acceptable recoveries (70 to 120%) were<br>
achieved for five replicate analyses of control samples fortified at two levels in grapes<br>
and soybean seed. One recovery of 126% of N-acetyl AMPA in soybean seed was<br>
accepted on the basis that recoveries for soybean seed were consistent and average<br>
recoveries of this metabolite at each fortification level were within the acceptable<br>
range of 70 to 120%.<br>
For all matrices, unfortified control samples showed no detectable residues of<br>
glyphosate or metabolites.<br>
Fortification levels in this study were chosen to provide method performance<br>
data at the method LOQ and at the proposed tolerance levels. The LOQ was 0.050<br>
ppm in glyphosate equivalents for all analytes in all matrices. Grapes were fortified<br>
with all analytes at the proposed tolerance level of 0.20 ppm in glyphosate equivalents<br>
while soybean seed was fortified at the proposed tolerance level of 20.0 ppm in<br>
glyphosate equivalents. Results presented in the summary tables reflect the actual<br>
concentration of each compound; not glyphosate equivalents.<br>
The analytical method was performed without any significant modifications.<br>
Successful validation sets were achieved on the second attempt for soybean seed and<br>
the first attempt for grapes. This independent laboratory validation study<br>
demonstrated that the analytical method is acceptable for the quantitation of<br>
glyphosate and metabolites in soybean seed and grapes.<br>
Test System<br>
The subject method is applicable for the quantitation of glyphosate and<br>
glyphosate metabolites in various crop matrices. Grapes and soybean seed were<br>
chosen to validate the analytical method. The grape control matrix was purchased<br>
from an outside source (organic food store). The sample was stored frozen and<br>
processed prior to being analyzed to verify that the control was free of interferences at<br>
the appropriate retention times. The soybean seed control matrix was provided by<br>

Water System<br>
Principles of the Analytical Method<br>
Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA were extracted<br>
from grape and soybean seed samples into dilute aqueous acid/methanol (96/4, v/v)<br>
using a probe homogenizer. Three extractions were made for quantitative recovery of<br>
analytes and then continued with purification and analysis.<br>
Purification of glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate: An aliquot of extract was<br>
partitioned with methylene chloride and the aqueous fraction was recovered and<br>
filtered to remove particulates. Approximately 10 ml of the aqueous fraction was<br>
collected following filtration through a C18 SPE cartridge. An aliquot of the eluate<br>
collected from the C18 SPE was diluted and applied to a MAX SPE cartridge. The<br>
analytes were eluted from the MAX sorbent in 1% TFA in methanol/water (90/10)<br>
solution following several solution rinses. The MAX eluate was evaporated to<br>
dryness and redissolved in aqueous 0.02 M aqueous phosphoric acid, filtered, and<br>
analyzed for glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate. Following partitioning, soybean<br>
seed samples were subjected to a steam bath for approximately 15 minutes to<br>
precipitate additional material in the extract prior to particulate filtration.<br>
Purification of AMP A and N-acetyl AMPA: A second aliquot of the eluate,<br>
collected from the C18 SPE described above, was processed through a MCX SPE<br>
cartridge. Samples were applied to the cartridge, and then eluted with water and<br>
methanol. An N-Evap is used to blow down solvents; a concentrated aqueous<br>
solution of phosphoric acid was added so that the final solution equals 0.02 M<br>
aqueous phosphoric acid. The samples were then analyzed for AMPA and N-acetyl<br>
AMPA. Soybean seed samples were diluted in methanol before application to the<br>
cartridge.<br>
Modifications, Interpretations, and Critical Steps<br>
A minor method modification was made for the validation of glyphosate in<br>
soybean seed. The final extracts were diluted 100-fold prior to LC/MS/MS analysis<br>
to incorporate residues within the calibration curve.<br>
Some API 4000 LC/MS/MS instrumental parameters were modified to<br>
optimize sensitivity. The modifications included: increasing source temperature,<br>
adjusting collision energy potential and adjusting gas flow settings.<br>
In Step 2.2 of example 4A of the method, the temperature for the steam bath<br>
was not specified. During correspondence with the Sponsor, a temperature of 85 Â°C<br>
was recommended to more effectively precipitate protein from the matrix.<br>
In Step 5.0 of example 4C, use of a 50 ml or 20 ml collection container with a<br>
flat or gently sloped bottom was recommended. From this, it was assumed that a<br>
15-ml centrifuge tube would be adequate. However, based upon the low recoveries<br>
obtained in soybean seed Trial 1, Set 3, it was determined that a 20-ml scintillation<br>
vial, which has a flatter bottom and more surface area, is necessary for effective<br>
evaporation.<br>
Instrumentation<br>
Chromatography: Reversed-phase liquid chromatography was used to<br>
separate glyphosate and its metabolites from co-extractants. A Phenomenex Luna<br>
Phenyl Hexyl column was selected.<br>
<br>
LC/MS/MS Analysis<br>
Analysis of glyphosate and its metabolites was performed using a MDS Sciex<br>
API 4000 LC/MS/MS, equipped with a TurboIonSpray source, and operated in MRM,<br>
positive ion mode. Quantitation was based on the integrated area of a single ion<br>
transition for each analyte using a linear regression with a 1/x weighting on Analyst<br>
software version 1.4. A summary of representative experimental conditions is<br>
provided in Table 56.<br>
<br>
Calibration Procedure<br>
Calibration standards were embedded with samples in each set and typically<br>
progressed from low to high concentrations. The response factor of each calibration<br>
standard was calculated by dividing the analyte peak area of each standard by the<br>
analyte concentration for that standard. The average response was calculated for<br>
calibration standards injected with each set.<br>
Results and Discussion<br>
Detector Response<br>
Calibration standards were analyzed over the range of 0.5 to 100 ng/ml. The<br>
response of the MS/MS detector was linear with 1/x weighting over the range of<br>
standards analyzed. Detector response was stable throughout the course of each<br>
analytical run as was demonstrated by standard accuracy values.<br>
Control Samples<br>
There were no interference peaks detected at the retention time for either<br>
glyphosate or its metabolites in duplicate unfortified control samples analyzed<br>
concurrently with each validation trial.<br>
Trial 1, Soybean Seed<br>
The first trial for soybean seed (Set 3) failed due to low recoveries observed<br>
for glyphosate and each metabolite. Results of Trial 1 are summarized in table 57.<br>
The first trial for soybean seed was analyzed according to the procedure given<br>
in the analytical method, except that glyphosate and AMPA stable isotopes were not<br>
used as internal standards and the collection vessel for MAX SPE was not consistent<br>
with the larger volume and dimensions recommended in the method.<br>
Following the analysis of the first trial for soybean seed it was determined that<br>
the low recoveries of glyphosate were likely due to samples not being completely dry<br>
from blow down, and the lack of internal standard. The no detection of N-acetyl<br>
AMPA was likely related to retention time shift from residual TFA in final solution<br>
due to samples not being completely dry from blow down. Further all method<br>
development and validation work had been performed at temperatures of at least 80Â°C<br>
during the steam bath steps. The temperature of the steam bath in the first trial for<br>
soybean seed was 45Â°C. This may have not promoted proteins within the matrix to<br>
precipitate out, which could have suppressed the analytes during LCMS/MS analysis.<br>
The addition of glyphosate and AMPA internal standards would also adjust for<br>
suppression and drift during LCMS/MS analysis.<br>
Trial 2, Soybean Seed<br>
The second soybean seed trial (Set 4) was analyzed according to the procedure<br>
given in the analytical method with clarifications in correspondence following the<br>
failure of the first trial. A set of new calibration standards, with the internal standards<br>
incorporated, were prepared for analysis of the second tryout. The glyphosate extracts<br>
were blown down in 20-ml glass scintillation vials to ensure complete dryness.<br>
Internal standard was added to all samples before analysis.<br>
Recoveries for glyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetylglyphosate were within the<br>
acceptable range of 70 to 120%. N-acetyl AMPA had one recovery of 126%, which<br>
is above the acceptable range of 70 to 120%. However, these results were accepted<br>
on the basis that they were consistent, and the average recovery values for each<br>
fortification level were within the acceptable range of 70 to 120%, thus establishing<br>
successful method validation for the analysis of glyphosate and metabolites in<br>
soybean seed. Calibration data and exemplary chromatograms are not shown. The<br>
recovery data for glyphosate and metabolites are presented in table 58.<br>
<br>
Trial 1, Grapes<br>
Successful recovery data were obtained for grapes in the first trial (Set 2).<br>
Refer to Figure 31 though Figure 34 for plots of calibration data and Figure 35<br>
through Figure 58 for example chromatograms from Trial 1 for grapes. The recovery<br>
data for these validation trials are presented in table 59.<br>
<br>
Conclusion<br>
This study demonstrated that the analytical method is acceptable for the<br>
quantitation of glyphosate and metabolites in soybean seed and grapes. The method's<br>
stated LOQ of 0.05 ppm was demonstrated by acceptable recovery values from<br>
controls fortified at this level in both matrices. Acceptable method performance at the<br>
proposed tolerance limits for glyphosate in grapes (0.2 ppm) and soybean seed<br>
(20 ppm) was demonstrated by acceptable recoveries obtained from control samples<br>
fortified at these levels in each matrix. A summary of the data appears in Tables 50-<br>
67.<br>
Example 5. Analytical Method for the Determination of N-acetylglyphosate<br>
and Other Analytes in Various Matrices using LC/MS/MS<br>
Summary<br>
An analytical method was developed for the determination of N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA in animal matrices<br>
including milk, eggs, muscle, kidney, liver, and fat. The method target limit of<br>
quantitation (LOQ) in glyphosate equivalents for each analyte was 0.025 mg/kg in<br>
egg, milk, and muscle matrices and 0.050 mg/kg in kidney, liver, and fat matrices.<br>
The method was validated at the respective LOQ and 10xLOQ level. Milk and egg<br>
matrices were validated at 0.025 mg/kg (LOQ), 0.050 mg/kg (2xLOQ), and 0.5 mg/kg<br>
(20xLOQ). For each matrix using a LC/MS/MS system operating with an<br>
electrospray interface (ESI) in positive or negative ion mode detection. This<br>
analytical method was developed to support residue data collection in livestock<br>
feeding studies required for registration of genetically modified crops.<br>
For milk and egg matrices, matrix samples were diluted in aqueous 0.1%<br>
formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) and shaken to dilute sample in aqueous medium.<br>
Samples may be stored frozen or extracted promptly without freezing. The dilute<br>
sample was partitioned with hexane (after thawing if frozen) and the hexane layer<br>
discarded. The remaining aqueous fraction was partitioned with methylene chloride<br>
and the aqueous layer was collected. The methylene chloride fraction was back<br>
extracted with additional 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) for quantitative<br>
recovery of analytes. The aqueous fractions were combined and diluted to final<br>
volume 50 mL. An aliquot of the aqueous fraction was filtered through a C18 SPE<br>
cartridge. The C18 filtered extract was further purified by solid phase extraction<br>
using polymeric anion exchange (MAX) SPE cartridge and/or polymeric cation<br>
exchange (MCX) SPE cartridge, depending on matrix and analytes to be examined.<br>
Glyphosate and/or AMPA stable isotope standards used as internal standards were<br>
added to extracts prior to ion exchange SPE purification. Final extracts were filtered<br>
prior to LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
For animal tissue matrices, matrix samples were initially blended with C18<br>
sorbent material (matrix solid phase dispersion) prior to extraction in 0. 1N HCl<br>
solution (96% water/4% methanol) followed by water for final extract volume of 50<br>
mL. An aliquot of the extract was diluted in acetonitrile and methanol to precipitate<br>
proteins, then purified by solid phase extraction using polymeric anion exchange<br>
(MAX) SPE cartridge and/or polymeric cation exchange (MCX) SPE cartridge,<br>
depending on matrix and analytes to be examined. Glyphosate and/or AMPA stable<br>
isotope standards used as internal standards were added to extracts prior to ion<br>
exchange SPE purification. Final extracts were filtered prior to LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
Final extract and calibration standard solutions were adjusted to 0.02M<br>
phosphoric acid. Samples and standards were analyzed using HPLC with reverse<br>
phase chromatography and a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray<br>
source, operating in positive ion LC/MS/MS mode.<br>
The recoveries from matrix samples fortified at the respective LOQ and higher<br>
levels support the satisfactory performance of this method. Tables 68-71 summarize<br>
the average recovery results for N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, and<br>
AMPA in sample matrices. Liver, fat, and muscle include samples from cow and<br>
chicken. Cow was source of kidney samples.<br>
Reference Analytical Standards<br>
Reference standards were supplied by DuPont Crop Protection, E. I. du Pont<br>
de Nemours and Company, Wilmington, DE. Information pertaining to the<br>
characterization and stability of the reference standards along with chemical retain<br>
samples are archived by E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, DuPont Crop<br>
Protection, Newark, Delaware. The reference standards in solid form were stored at<br>
room temperature in a dessicator typically in the presence of desiccant. Stable isotope<br>
standards of glyphosate and AMPA used for internal standards were acquired from<br>
Dr. Ehrenstorfer GmbH (Atlanta, Georgia).<br>
Principle of the Analytical Method<br>
For milk and egg commodities, matrix samples (2 g) were diluted in aqueous<br>
0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) and shaken to dilute sample in aqueous<br>
medium. The dilute sample was partitioned with hexane and the hexane layer<br>
discarded. The remaining aqueous fraction was partitioned with methylene chloride<br>
and the aqueous layer was collected. The methylene chloride fraction was back<br>
extracted with additional 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) for quantitative<br>
recovery of analytes. The aqueous fractions were combined and diluted to final<br>
volume of 50 mL. An aliquot of the aqueous fraction was filtered through a C18 SPE<br>
cartridge. The C18 purified extract was further purified by solid phase extraction<br>
using polymeric anion exchange (MAX) SPE cartridge and/or polymeric cation<br>
exchange (MCX) SPE cartridge, depending on matrix and analytes to be examined.<br>
For MAX SPE, an aliquot of the C18 eluate and internal standard were diluted to 20<br>
mL with water and applied to a conditioned SPE cartridge. The MAX sorbent is<br>
sequentially rinsed with methanol/water (80/20), 0.1M acetic acid in methanol/water<br>
(80/20) and methanol/water (95/5). The analytes were eluted in 1% TFA in 90%<br>
methanol/10% water solution and the eluate was evaporated to dryness then restored<br>
in final solution for LC/MS/MS following mixing and filtration for the analysis of<br>
glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA. For MCX SPE, an<br>
aliquot of the C18 eluate and internal standard were eluted through a conditioned SPE<br>
cartridge followed by methanol rinse. The load and methanol rinse from the MCX<br>
SPE cartridge were collected and the methanol was evaporated, then extract was<br>
diluted to final volume containing 0.02M phosphoric acid, mixed, and filtered for<br>
LC/MS/MS for the analysis N-acetylglyphosate, AMP A, and/or N-acetyl AMPA<br>
depending on the sample matrix.<br>
For animal tissue commodities, samples (2 g) were blended with C18 sorbent<br>
material (4 g) until tissue was macerated and homogenized (matrix solid phase<br>
dispersion). Prepped samples were extracted in 25 mL of 0. 1N HClsolution (96%<br>
water/4% methanol) using vortexing and mechanical shaking. The extraction solution<br>
was decanted, from sample after centrifugation, then sample was re-extracted with<br>
water for quantitative transfer of analytes to final extract volume of 50 mL. Aliquots<br>
of the extract were purified by solid phase extraction using polymeric anion exchange<br>
(MAX) SPE cartridge and/or polymeric cation exchange (MCX) SPE cartridge,<br>
depending on matrix and analytes to be examined. For MAX SPE purification, an<br>
aliquot of the extract was diluted in acetonitrile and methanol in the presence of<br>
triethylamine (adjusts pH basic to promote protein precipitation and prepare analytes<br>
for loading on anion exchange medium). Following centrifugation to isolate<br>
precipitants in a pellet, the extract solution was diluted with methanol to<br>
approximately 20 mL and loaded onto a conditioned MAX SPE cartridge. The MAX<br>
sorbent was sequentially rinsed with methanol/water (80/20), 0.1M acetic acid in<br>
methanol/water (80/20) and methanol/water (95/5). The analytes were eluted in 1%<br>
TFA in 90% methanol/10% water solution and the eluate was evaporated to dryness<br>
then restored in final solution for LC/MS/MS following mixing and filtration for the<br>
analysis of glyphosate and N-acetylglyphosate and/or N-acetyl AMPA. For MCX<br>
SPE, an aliquot of the extract was diluted in acetonitrile and methanol to promote<br>
protein precipitation. Following centrifugation to isolate precipitants in a pellet, the<br>
extract solution was diluted with methanol to approximately 20 mL and loaded onto a<br>
conditioned MCX SPE cartridge. The MCX sorbent was rinsed with methanol, then<br>
the analytes were eluted in water (4 mL) followed by methanol (4 mL) for<br>
quantitative recovery. The methanol in the collected eluate was evaporated and<br>
solution was: adjusted to final volume containing 0.02M phosphoric acid, mixed, and<br>
filtered for LC/MS/MS for the analysis AMPA.<br>
Glyphosate and/or AMPA stable isotope standards used as internal standards<br>
were added to extracts prior to ion exchange SPE purification. Final extracts were<br>
prepared in aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid and filtered (0.2 Âµm) prior to LC/MS/MS<br>
analysis to remove particulates as preventive maintenance measure for the HPLC<br>
system. Phosphoric acid acts a weak ion-pairing agent on HPLC polymeric stationery<br>
phase and was used as the final solution to improve glyphosate LC/MS/MS<br>
performance (response and linearity). The analytes were resolved by HPLC reverse-<br>
phase chromatography using a phenyl-hexyl column coupled to electrospray<br>
ionization in with MS/MS detection to acquire 2 molecular ion transitions (only 1 ion<br>
transition is monitored for AMPA in positive ion mode). Quantitative analysis was<br>
accomplished using a single molecular ion transition. The relative abundance of the 2<br>
MS/MS fragment ions provided confirmatory evidence for glyphosate,<br>
iV-acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, and AMPA (negative mode).<br>

Stock Standard Preparation and Stability<br>
If possible standards with purity greater than 95% were used. A minimum of<br>
approximately 10 mg of standard was weighed on an analytical balance that provides<br>
a weight precision to three significant figures, or the amount of standard should be<br>
increased to satisfy this condition.<br>
Since residue tolerances were established in glyphosate free-acid equivalents,<br>
stock standard solutions for each analyte were prepared in glyphosate free-acid<br>
equivalents so that fortifications and recoveries can be determined in parent free acid<br>
equivalents. As needed, individual parent free-acid equivalent stock standards<br>
solutions for N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, N-acetyl AMPA, or AMPA were<br>
prepared by adding appropriate amounts of standard to a 100-mL volumetric flask and<br>
diluting to final volume with water. Water refers to HPLC grade or equivalent water.<br>
The following calculation and example provide guidance for the preparation of 100<br>
mL of a 100 (Âµg/mL stock solution in glyphosate equivalents for each analyte.<br>
<br>
Amounts weighed for each analyte should be at least 10 mg. Individual analyte stock<br>
solution concentrations can exceed 100 ng/mL in glyphosate equivalents. Stock<br>
standard solutions may be prepared at higher concentrations (not to exceed 1 mg/mL).<br>
A minimum standard weight of approximately 10 mg and final standard volume of at<br>
least 10 mL should be observed.<br>
Internal Standard Preparation and Stability<br>
Glyphosate 1,2-13C2 15N and aminomethyl phosphonic acid 13C 15N (AMPA)<br>
stable isotope standards were supplied in amber ampules containing 1.1 mL of<br>
aqueous solution at a nominal concentration of 100 mg/L (Âµg/mL). Each standard<br>
solution was transferred to a 15 mL polypropylene centrifuge tube and diluted to 5<br>
mL volume with HPLC grade water rinses of the original container for quantitative<br>
transfer of the standard material. Final concentration for stock standard solution was<br>
approximately 20 Âµg/mL. The isotopic purity was verified for each standard by<br>
analysis of an approximately 500 ng/mL solution. See, figure 74.<br>
An intermediate 100 ng/mL internal standard solution containing glyphosate<br>
and AMPA isotopes was prepared by diluting 100 ng/mL stock solution at a rate of<br>
0.1 mL in 100 mL of aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid or HPLC grade purified water.<br>
Internal standards were included in final extract and calibration standard solutions at a<br>
rate of 50 ÂµL/mL. Each 100 mL of a 100 ng/mL standard solution can be used in up<br>
to 400 samples when 250 ÂµL of internal standard is applied in 5 mL of final extract.<br>
Specifically, individually transfer the 100 ng/mL standards to a 15 mL<br>
polypropylene centrifuge tube and dilute to 5 mL volume with HPLC grade water<br>
rinses of the original container for quantitative transfer of the standard material. Final<br>
concentration for stock standard solution were approximately 20 Âµg/mL. For each<br>
stock solution, 0.025 mL of the 20 Âµg/mL standard solution was transferred to a<br>
autosampler vial and dilute to 1 mL volume with 0.975 mL of 0.02M H3P04 to<br>
prepare separate solutions at approximately 500 ng/mL for purity evaluation.<br>
Next, 1.00 mL aliquot of each 20 Âµg/mL standard stock solution was<br>
combined in a single 250 mL graduated cylinder and diluted to final volume with<br>
0.02M H3PO4 to prepare a mixed solution at 100 ng/mL. 100 ng/mL IS solution was<br>
transferred to a 250 mL bottle. Solution was store refrigerated (~4Â°C).<br>
Intermediate and Fortification Standards Preparation and Stability<br>
Stock solution for each analyte was diluted appropriately into a common<br>
volumetric flask, dilute to volume with HPLC grade purified water, cap, and mix<br>
well. For example, 1.00 mL of a 100 Âµg/mL stock solution for each required analyte<br>
was combined in a 10-mL volumetric flask and diluted to final volume with water,<br>
cap, and mix well. It was store at or below 4Â°C and replaced monthly.<br>
Stock solutions concentrations will vary and the required volume of each<br>
analyte stock solution used to prepare fortification solution was adjusted for correct<br>
final concentration as determined using the following calculation.<br>
<br>
For example, to prepare 50 mL of a 10 Âµg/mL fortification solution from<br>
glyphosate, N--acetylglyphosate, N-acetyl AMP A, and AMPA stock solutions<br>
prepared respectively at 115 Âµg/mL, 186 Âµg/mL, 143 Âµg/mL, and 206 Âµg/mL in<br>
glyphosate free-acid equivalent concentrations the following stock solution volumes<br>
were added to a 50-mL volumetric flask.<br>
Glyphosate = 10 Âµg/mL x 50 mL /115 Âµg/mL = 4.35 mL stock<br>
solution<br>
N-acetylglyphosate =10 Âµg/mL x 50 mL /186 Âµg/mL = 2.69 mL stock<br>
solution<br>
N-acetyl AMPA = 10 Âµg/mL x 50 mL /143 Âµg/mL = 3.50 mL stock<br>
solution<br>
AMPA = 10 Âµg/mL x 50 mL / 206 Âµg/mL = 2.42 mL stock solution<br>
10.0 ng/mL Fortification Solution<br>
Each stock solution was diluted appropriately with water into a volumetric<br>
flask, cap and mix well. For example, 1.00 mL of a 100 Âµg/mL stock solution was<br>
combined in a 10-mL volumetric flask and diluted to final volume with water, cap and<br>
mix well. It was stored at or below 4Â°C and replaced monthly.<br>
1.0 Âµg/mL Fortification Solution<br>
10.0 Âµg/mL fortification solution (preferred) or the stock solution for each<br>
analyte was diluted appropriately with water into a volumetric flask. For example,<br>
1.0 mL of the 10.0 Âµg/mL fortification solution was transferred to a 10-mL volumetric<br>
flask, diluted to volume with water, caped and mixed well. It was stored at or below<br>
4Â°C and replaced monthly.<br>
Chromatographic Standard Preparation and Stability<br>
Calibration standards were prepared from dilutions of fortification standards<br>
or individual stock standards. A minimum of 5 calibration standards over a range<br>
from approximately 50% of LOQ equivalent final concentration to &gt;120% of the<br>
highest expected final sample concentration is recommended for quantification. The<br>
LOQ equivalent final concentration for N-acetylglyphosate was 1.0 ng/mL.<br>
For example, calibration standards of 10.0 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL were<br>
prepared from the 1.0 and 10.0 Âµg/mL fortification solutions, respectively, by diluting<br>
a 100 ÂµL aliquot to final volume of 10.0 mL in aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid (this<br>
simulates sample fortification). Calibration standards were prepared concurrently<br>
with sample fortifications using this procedure.<br>
Source (&amp; Characterization) of Samples<br>
Raw milk was obtained from the University of Delaware Agricultural Farm.<br>
Milk commodities (whole, skim, and heavy cream), and eggs were obtained from<br>
local supermarket. Beef liver, kidney, fat, and muscle were obtained from a cattle<br>
feeding study. Poultry liver, fat, and muscle were obtained from a laying hen feeding<br>
study.<br>
Storage &amp; Preparation of Samples<br>
Whole eggs were beaten prior to subsampling. Egg whites and yolks were<br>
separated and beaten prior to subsampling. Egg commodity subsamples (2 g) were<br>
weighed into tared 50-mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes. If subsamples were not<br>
analyzed promptly, 25 mL of aqueous 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) was<br>
added, capped, mixed, and the sample was frozen.<br>
Raw, whole, skim, or heavy cream milk subsamples (2 g) were weighed into<br>
tared 50-mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes. If subsamples were not analyzed<br>
promptly, 25 mL of aqueous 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v) was added,<br>
capped, mixed, and the sample was frozen.<br>
Animal tissue samples were ground with dry ice using a Waring commercial<br>
food processor (Lab Micronizer Model 31FP93) prior to freezer storage. Samples<br>
were mixed extensively during the grinding process to ensure fine maceration and<br>
homogeneity. The dry ice was allowed to sublime in a fume hood or overnight in<br>
freezer prior to subsampling and freezer storage.<br>
All frozen samples were stored at -20 Â± 5Â°C prior to sample extraction, and<br>
analysis.<br>
Sample Fortification Procedure<br>
Untreated matrix control samples in extraction containers (50-mL centrifuge<br>
tubes) were fortified as required. The 10.0 and 1.0 Âµg/mL Fortification Standards<br>
(see above) were used to fortify test samples. Table 75 is provided as an example for<br>
the fortifications made in this study.<br>
For each matrix sample, 2.0 Â± 0.1 g was weighed into a clean 50-mL<br>
centrifuge tube. For milk and egg commodities, the sample was gently swirled or<br>
vortexed after fortification to disperse the analyte in the sample. For animal tissue<br>
commodities, samples were allowed to stand in fume hood for approximately 15<br>
minutes to allow fortification solution to dissipate. Following fortification, milk and<br>
egg samples were diluted in 25 mL of aqueous 0.1% formic acid/methanol (96/4, v/v),<br>
frozen, and stored prior to extraction and analysis.<br>

vacuum was applied to collect final rinse. Sample collection tube was<br>
removed and final volume was adjusted to 50 mL with water. Sample<br>
extract can be centrifuged and decanted into reservoir after vortexing<br>
to prevent frit plugging. This option is recommended for muscle<br>
extracts.<br>

Calibration Procedures<br>
Standard mass spectrometer tuning and calibration techniques were used. If<br>
confidence in the mass calibration needs to be established (modern mass<br>
spectrometers under digital control generally do not need frequent mass calibration,<br>
especially for quantitative modes), use vendor recommended calibrating solution.<br>
Optimization tuning of MS system may be accomplished by infusion of the test<br>
analyte. This method uses external standards, prepared as described above.<br>
Instrument calibration was based on the average response factor (analyte peak<br>
area response/analyte concentration) of external calibration standards using ExcelÂ®<br>
functions AVERAGE, STDEV, and RSD. For average response factor calibration,<br>
a %RSD of less than or equal to 20% should be observed. The linear regression<br>
response of external calibration standards using ExcelÂ® functions SLOPE,<br>
INTERCEPT, and RSQ were monitored to establish calibration curve linearity.<br>
Acceptance criteria for valid quantitation are: (1) RSQ value &gt;0.99 for calibration<br>
curve and (2) the %RSD 
factors. Alternative approaches including linear regression with or without weighting<br>
(e.g., 1/x) may be used if they provide an equivalent or more consistent fit of sample<br>
response to the response of calibration standards.<br>
The LC/MS/MS calibrated range was 0.25 ng/mL to 50.0 ng/mL for<br>
N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, and N-acetyl AMPA. The LC/MS/MS calibrated<br>
range was 0.5 ng/mL to 50.0 ng/mL for AMPA. Generally, a minimum of<br>
5 calibration solutions were analyzed for quantitative LC/MS/MS analysis.<br>
Net recoveries may be calculated for fortified samples only (not acceptable for<br>
field samples). If residues in the control sample can be integrated with signal-to-noise<br>
response of at least 3-to-l, then net recoveries may be calculated by subtracting mg/kg<br>
found in the control sample from mg/kg found in the fortified samples. When the<br>
control residues are &gt;50% of the LOQ, the recovery samples prepared at the LOQ<br>
using that control are invalidated. If net recoveries are calculated, those results must<br>
be uniquely identified or presented in a separate spreadsheet column heading for<br>
corrected mg/kg.<br>
Sample Analysis<br>
Preliminary runs of at least 2 calibration standards were routinely made to<br>
demonstrate adequate instrument response and insure the LC/MS/MS system was<br>
equilibrated. If multiple sets were analyzed, a solvent blank injection was made<br>
between the last and first injections of the sets to minimize risk of carryover between<br>
sets. Calibration standard analyses preceded the first sample analysis and follow the<br>
last sample analysis so sample analyses were contained within the external standard<br>
calibration. Generally, the injection sequence was organized from lowest to highest<br>
expected analyte concentrations. Calibration standard runs were intermixed with the<br>
test samples and were analyzed before and after every 1-3 samples in each analytical<br>
set. Extracts and calibration standards were refrigerated if stored. Generally,<br>
fortification sample recoveries (70-120%) were required for acceptable quantitation<br>
results in an analysis set.<br>

calibration standards concurrently analyzed with sample extracts. All calculations<br>
were made using unrounded values that were reported to two significant figures.<br>

Results and Discussion<br>
Method Validation Results<br>
Detector Response<br>
A triple quadrupole mass spectrometer using positive or negative ion ESI and<br>
tandem mass spectrometry detection was used for sample extract analysis. Full-Scan<br>
total ion chromatograms and spectra for N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, AMPA, and<br>
N-acetyl AMPA from analysis of standard solutions are provided in Figure 59 through<br>
Figure 62, respectively.<br>
Calibration standards typically yielded a linear response (r-squared &gt;0.99)<br>
with %RSD 
over the range of 0.25-20 ng/mL for Glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate and N-acetyl<br>
AMPA or 0.5-50 ng/mL for AMPA. Representative calibration curves for each<br>
analyte were constructed using calibration standards from a validation set and are<br>
presented in Figure 63. Representative ion chromatograms of Calibration Standards<br>
are provided in Figure 64. Representative ion chromatograms of extracts from a<br>
Control a LOQ fortification, and 10xLOQ fortification sample extracts for milk, egg,<br>
and tissue matrices are provided in Figure 65 through Figure 73, respectively.<br>
Controls<br>
No significant matrix interference was observed in the regions of N-<br>
acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, or N-acetyl AMPA elution in chromatograms of control<br>
extracts from matrix samples. AMPA was found in control chicken liver (0.011<br>
mg/kg) and muscle (0.003 mg/kg) samples.<br>
Recoveries (Accuracy &amp; Precision)<br>
Representative recovery results are provided in Table 80 through Table 82 for<br>
milk matrices, Table 83 through Table 85 for egg matrices, and Table 86 through<br>
Table 89 for animal tissue matrices. Average recovery results at each fortification<br>
level with overall recovery results for each matrix are provided in the summary.<br>
Representative results from individual sample set analyses for each commodity<br>
including calibration standards statistics are provided in Tables 90-101.<br>
Extraction Efficiency<br>
Chicken liver, fat, and muscle samples treated with 14C N-acetylglyphosate in<br>
a poultry metabolism study were extracted using procedures in described herein for<br>
radiochemical validation of the extraction efficiency. Duplicate 2 g subsamples from<br>
each matrix were extracted and aliquots from each extract were analyzed by liquid<br>
scintillation counting (LSC) for radioactive recovery. Radioactive recovery results<br>
(dpm/g) were converted using specific activity of original I4C N-acetylglyphosate test<br>
substance (13.83 ÂµCi/mg = 30703 dpm/(Âµg) to ng/g concentrations for comparison<br>
with reported recoveries in the poultry metabolism study. The respective recovery<br>
results for liver, fat, and muscle were 98%, 88%, and 104% of the Âµg/g concentrations<br>
found in the metabolism study extractions. LSC data and results are provided in<br>
Table 102.<br>
Milk and egg samples are generally liquid matrices that were diluted in<br>
aqueous solution prior to purification procedures of partitioning and solid phase<br>
extraction SPE. No extraction efficiency testing was conducted for these matrices.<br>
Limit of Quantitation (LOQ)<br>
The LOQ determined in this method was 0.025 mg/kg (ppm) in milk, egg, and<br>
muscle matrices and 0.050 mg/kg in kidney, liver, and fat matrices for the analysis<br>
of glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA. The LOQ is defined<br>
as the lowest fortification level at which average recoveries of 70-110% and a RSD<br>

consistently represents a signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5-20 to 1 for<br>
N-acetylglyphosate.<br>
Background Evaluation<br>
Background levels experienced in tandem mass spectrometry analyses are<br>
minimal. Generally, the chromatographic profiles of a sample extract solution and a<br>
calibration standard solution appear the same. Representative matrix chromatograms<br>
are provided in Figure 65 through Figure 73.<br>
Limit of Detection (LOD)<br>
The LOD is defined as the analyte concentration in matrix with a response<br>
equivalent to a signal-to-noise ratio (s/n) of approximately 3 to 1. The LOD was<br>
estimated from the s/n response determined in a LOQ fortification sample using the<br>
following equation for each analyte.<br>
<br>
The individual chromatograms showing s/n determination and calculated estimates for<br>
each analyte are provided in Figures 75-80. The LOD estimates for each analyte and<br>
matrix examined with are summarized in the table 79.<br>
Variation in the LOD was observed and each lab using this method should<br>
estimate LOD values. Sample extracts stored frozen should be thawed and sonicated<br>
approximately 15 minutes prior to re-purification or analysis. Routinely, a<br>
LC/MS/MS end run was setup so that high percentage organic solvent (99%<br>
methanol) would continue overnight at a low flowrate (0.025 mL/min) after the final<br>
analysis to keep the HPLC pump and column in good condition.<br>
The stability of the analyte stock standards prepared in distilled water and<br>
stored at approximately 4Â°C were shown to be stable for more than a year. Data not<br>
shown. Fortification Standards, also prepared in distilled water, should be stable for<br>
same time period as the stock solutions. Calibration standards were prepared in<br>
aqueous 0.02M phosphoric acid or 80% control matrix/20% aqueous 0.02M<br>
phosphoric acid were shown to be stable for at least 2.7 months when stored at<br>
approximately 4Â°C.<br>
No interferences attributable to glassware, reagents, or matrices were observed<br>
to co-elute with test analytes. A peak was observed in the m/z 212?88 MRM<br>
transition channel eluting just after N-acetylglyphosate that was attributable to MAX<br>
SPE sorbent.<br>
Confirmatory Procedure<br>
Two independent MS/MS transitions of the molecular ion for<br>
N-acetylglyphosate, glyphosate, and N-acetyl AMPA were monitored in ESI positive<br>
or negative ion mode. Two independent MS/MS transitions of the molecular ion for<br>
AMPA were monitored in ESI negative mode only. The relative response ratios of<br>
the two fragment ions (base peak/secondary peak) were determined from calibration<br>
standard responses for confirmation of analyte in matrix samples. Acceptable<br>
confirmation criteria are a co-eluting peak (Â± 5%) and equivalent ion ratio (Â± 30%)<br>
compared to the average response observed in calibration standards at or above the<br>
LOQ equivalent concentration concurrently analyzed with the samples.<br>
Representative confirmatory analyses showing calculated response ratios and<br>
retention times for each analyte are provided in tables 103-106.<br>
Conclusions<br>
This analytical method is suitable for the quantitation of glyphosate,<br>
N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and N-acetyl AMPA residues in milk, egg, and animal<br>
tissue matrices. The results support an LOQ of 0.025 mg/kg glyphosate equivalents<br>
in milk, egg, and muscle matrices, and an LOQ of 0.050 mg/kg in liver, kidney, and<br>
fat matrices. The estimated LOD values for all analytes were less than or equal to<br>
0.008 mg/kg glyphosate equivalents in milk, egg, and muscle matrices, and less than<br>
or equal to 0.019 mg/kg glyphosate equivalents in liver, kidney, and fat matrices. The<br>
estimated LOD for glyphosate in all matrices examined was less than or equal to<br>
0.009 mg/kg glyphosate equivalents.<br>
The mean recoveries for individual fortification levels of each analyte and<br>
matrix in the validation trials ranged from 76% (AMPA in skim milk at 0.50 mg/kg)<br>
to 110% (AMPA in Egg Yolks at 0.025 mg/kg). The maximum standard deviation for<br>
individual fortification levels was 16% (iV-acetyl AMPA in liver at 0.050 mg/kg).<br>
Residue confirmation for glyphosate, N-acetylglyphosate, AMPA, and N-<br>
acetyl AMPA was demonstrated at the LOQ and lOxLOQ fortification levels based<br>
on retention time and the relative ratios of two MS/MS parent-to-fragment ion<br>
transitions detected during sample analysis.<br>
