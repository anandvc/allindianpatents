The present relates to a split mechanical seal that constitutes a split sealing ring wherein at least one<br>
or other of a first sealing ring on the seal case side and a second sealing ring on the rotating shaft side is<br>
split in the circumferential direction.<br>
[Background Technology]<br>
[0002]<br>
There are, broadly speaking, two types of split mechanical seals that constitute split sealing rings<br>
wherein at least one or other of a first sealing ring on the seal case side and a second sealing ring on the<br>
rotating shaft side is split in the circumferential direction. Such two types of split mechanical seals<br>
include inside mechanical seals and outside mechanical seals. In inside mechanical seals, a first and a<br>
second sealing ring are deployed inside the seal case, configured so as to shield, by the relative rotating<br>
and sliding action of sealing end surfaces constituting the opposing end surfaces of the two sealing<br>
rings, a sealed fluid region constituting the region on the outer circumferential side of the parts<br>
performing the relative rotating and sliding and a non-sealed fluid region constituting the region on the<br>
inner circumferential side thereof (see Fig. 2 in Patent Literature 1, for example). In outside<br>
mechanical seals, a second sealing ring is deployed in a non-sealed fluid region outside the seal case,<br>
configured so as to shield, by the relative rotating and sliding action of sealing end surfaces constituting<br>
the opposing end surfaces of the two sealing rings, a sealed fluid region constituting the region on the<br>
inner circumferential side of the parts performing the relative rotating and sliding and a non-sealed<br>
fluid region constituting the region on the outer circumferential side thereof (see Fig. 2 in Patent<br>
Literature 2, for example). Such split mechanical seals are ideal as shaft sealing means for large<br>
longitudinal shaft pumps and the like, so that disassembling and reassembling tasks, inclusive of<br>
maintenance tasks, can be performed easily, even when the seal is large.<br>
[0003]<br>
With inside mechanical seals, however, it is necessary to make the seal case a split type, and, due to<br>
the fact that internal pressure acts on the seal case due to non-sealed fluid, the seal case becomes<br>
complex and large, compared to outside mechanical seals, and a large amount of labor is required for<br>
maintenance tasks including disassembling and reassembling the seal case.<br>
[0004]<br>
With outside mechanical seals, on the other hand, the seal case can be made a non-split type;<br>
accordingly, maintenance tasks can be completed merely by disassembling and reassembling the split<br>
sealing ring, and little labor is required in maintenance tasks. Hence the outside mechanical seal has<br>
outstanding practicality as a split mechanical seal.<br>
[0005]<br>
More specifically, with a conventional outside mechanical seal, as shown in Figs. 2 to 4 in Patent<br>
Literature 2, for example, a first sealing ring on the seal case side is split in the circumferential<br>
direction, configuring a plurality of separated circular arc-shaped segments. A binding ring, in such a<br>
manner that it is fitted into a first sealing ring, is attached to a retainer ring held in the seal case so that<br>
it can be freely tightened in the axial direction. By tightening the binding ring to the retainer ring, the<br>
2<br><br>
first sealing ring is bound and held in a ring-shaped configuration in which the end surfaces of the<br>
circular arc-shaped segments are butted together. As a result, the first sealing ring can be disassembled<br>
and reassembled by the removal and attachment of the binding ring from and to the retainer ring.<br>
[0006]<br>
[Patent Literature 1] Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No. H07-198043<br>
[Patent Literature 2] Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No 2004-251376<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problems the Invention Attempts to Solve]<br>
[0007]<br>
With the conventional outside mechanical seal (hereinafter simply called "conventional seal")<br>
described above, however, the first sealing ring is directly bound by a binding ring made of metal.<br>
Therefore, when the binding ring is tightened to the retainer ring excessively, that is, when the binding<br>
force on the split sealing ring by the binding ring is excessive, distortion occurs in the circular arc-<br>
shaped segments, and there is a danger of the sealed fluid leaking from the split parts of this sealing<br>
ring (from the end surface-butted parts of the circular arc-shaped segments). Conversely, when the<br>
binding ring is inadequately tightened to the retainer ring, and the binding force on the first sealing ring<br>
by the binding ring is insufficient, then there is a danger of the end surface-butted parts of the circular<br>
arc-shaped segments opening due to the interior pressure acting on the first sealing ring (the pressure of<br>
the non-sealed fluid acting on the inner circumferential surfaces of the first sealing ring), allowing the<br>
sealed fluid to leak. Such problems also occur similarly in cases where the second sealing ring is made<br>
a split sealing ring, and occur most conspicuously in cases where the split sealing ring is made of a<br>
ceramic such as silicon carbide or of soft carbon or the like which is weak in the face of pulling loads<br>
and in cases where the sealed fluid pressure is high.<br>
[0008]<br>
Conventionally, furthermore, in cases where distortion occurs, due to an excessive binding force or<br>
the like, in a sealing end surface that is a contacting surface with an opposing sealing ring, when the<br>
mechanical seal is being assembled or during maintenance involving the disassembly or exchange of<br>
the split sealing ring, measures have been tried such as repairing this sealing end surface by a so-called<br>
"rubbing together operation," or setting the radial-dimension width of this sealing end surface<br>
extremely small, and performing so-called "breaking-in operation" prior to normal operation.<br>
However, such rubbing together operation and breaking-in operation require a high level of skill,<br>
making them difficult to perform by a user, and also place an enormous burden on the worker. The<br>
economic burden is also extremely large. Furthermore, it is difficult to perform breaking-in under dry<br>
conditions with split mechanical seals wherein the radial width of the sealing end surfaces have been<br>
set extremely small; accordingly, they cannot be adopted as shaft sealing means for advance standby<br>
operating type pumps or the like which sometimes operate for considerably long periods in air, and<br>
there are broad limitations to their application.<br>
[0009]<br>
An object of the present invention, which was devised for the purpose of solving the problems with<br>
outside mechanical seals described above, is to provide a split mechanical seal so that it is possible to<br>
2A<br><br>
bind and hold a split sealing ring or rings in a proper ring-shaped configuration without causing<br>
distortion in the sealing end surface or surfaces.<br>
[Means for the Solving Problems]<br>
[0010]<br>
The present invention proposes a split mechanical seal (outside mechanical seal) configured such<br>
that at least one or other of a first sealing ring provided on the seal case side and a second sealing ring<br>
provided on a rotating shaft that passes through a cavity in the seal case constitutes a split sealing ring<br>
which is split in the circumferential direction; this split sealing ring is secured and held, in such a<br>
manner that it is bound in a circular ring shape, to a holding ring which is held in the seal case or on the<br>
rotating shaft so that it is movable or so that it is immovable in the axial direction, by a binding ring<br>
attached thereto (i.e. to the holding ring) so as to be freely tightenable in the axial direction; and, by the<br>
relative rotating and sliding action of sealing end surfaces that are opposing end surfaces of the first<br>
sealing ring and the second sealing ring, a sealed fluid region that is a region on the inner<br>
circumferential side of those relatively rotating and sliding parts and a non-sealed fluid region that is a<br>
region on the outer circumferential side thereof are shielded and sealed; and in order to accomplish the<br>
object described above, in the above-described split mechanical seal (outside mechanical seal), the<br>
opposing circumferential surfaces between the split sealing ring and the binding ring fitted thereon are<br>
configured as a tapered surfaces of a truncated conical shape that gradually become larger in the<br>
direction of tightening to the retainer ring of the binding ring, and, at the same time, the configuration is<br>
made such that an end-surface side elastic member and a circumferential-surface side elastic member<br>
are interposed, respectively, between the opposing end surfaces, in the axial direction, of the split<br>
sealing ring and the retainer ring, and between the opposing circumferential surfaces of the split sealing<br>
ring and the binding ring, and, by tightening the binding ring to the retainer ring, the split sealing ring is<br>
pressed against and held on, with the end-surface side elastic member in between, on the axial direction<br>
end surface of the retainer ring and is also fitted on and held on, with the circumferential-surface side<br>
elastic member in between, the inner circumferential surface of the binding ring.<br>
[0011]<br>
In such a split outside mechanical seal, either one or other of the first and second sealing rings, or<br>
both, can be configured as the split sealing ring described above, depending on the sealing conditions or<br>
the like. In cases where the first sealing ring is configured as a split sealing ring, the first sealing ring is<br>
held in a circular ring configuration by a binding ring (hereinafter called the "first binding ring"), a<br>
retainer ring (hereinafter called the "first retainer ring") for securing and holding the first binding ring is<br>
held in the seal case so as to be movable in the axial direction, and, between this first retainer ring and<br>
the seal case, a spring member for pressing and urging the first sealing ring toward the second sealing<br>
ring is interposed. In cases where the second sealing ring is configured as a split sealing ring,<br>
moreover, the second sealing ring is held in a circular ring configuration by a binding ring (hereinafter<br>
called the "second binding ring"), and a retainer ring (hereinafter called the "second retainer ring") for<br>
securing and holding the second sealing ring is secured and held on the rotating shaft.<br>
[0012]<br>
In a preferred embodiment, for the end-surface side elastic member (which, hereinafter, when used<br>
for the first sealing ring will be called the "first end-surface side elastic member," and when used for<br>
the second sealing ring will be called the "second end-surface side elastic member"), it is preferable<br>
that sheet made of an elastic material (rubber sheet, for example) or an O-ring made of rubber, or the<br>
3<br><br>
like, capable of functioning as a seal for effecting a secondary seal between the opposing end surfaces,<br>
in the axial direction, of the split sealing ring (first sealing ring or second sealing ring) and the retainer<br>
ring (first retainer ring or second retainer ring), be used. And for the circumferential-surface side<br>
elastic member (which, hereinafter, when used for the first sealing ring will be called the "first<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic member," and when used for the second sealing ring will be called<br>
the "second circumferential-surface side elastic member"), it is preferable that sheet made of an elastic<br>
material (rubber sheet, for example) having a cushioning property and capable of filling in between the<br>
opposing circumferential surfaces of the split sealing ring (the first sealing ring or the second sealing<br>
ring) and the binding ring (the first binding ring or the second binding ring), about the entire<br>
circumference thereof, be used.<br>
[Benefits of Invention]<br>
[0013]<br>
In the split mechanical seal of the present invention, because the split sealing ring is bound and held<br>
by a binding ring with a circumferential-surface side elastic member interposed therebetween, and is<br>
also secured and held to a retainer ring with a end-surface side elastic member interposed therebetween,<br>
even when the binding force produced by the binding ring is excessive or insufficient, or when the<br>
internal pressure acting on this split sealing ring is high, the split surfaces do not open, nor does<br>
distortion develop in the sealing end surfaces, and the split sealing ring can be held in a proper circular<br>
ring configuration. Accordingly, in the split mechanical seal of the present invention, no rubbing<br>
together operation or breaking-in operation described above is required, and maintenance tasks,<br>
including assembling the mechanical seal and disassembling or replacing the split sealing ring, can be<br>
performed easily, efficiently, and economically.<br>

[0015]<br>
The split mechanical seal in this embodiment, as shown in Fig. 1, is an end surface-contacting type<br>
outside mechanical seal that comprises a seal case 2 attached to the housing of a rotary machine (such<br>
as a pump housing, for example) 1, a first sealing ring 5 held in the seal case 2 by a first retainer ring 3<br>
and a first binding ring 4 so as to move freely in the axial direction (to the left and to the right) and so<br>
as not to be able to rotate relatively, a second sealing ring 9 secured to the rotating shaft (such as an<br>
impeller shaft, for example) 6 of the rotary machine by a second retainer ring 7 and a second binding<br>
ring 8, and a spring member 10, interposed between the seal case 2 and the first retainer ring 3, for<br>
urging the first sealing ring 5 in the axial direction so as to contact and press this first sealing ring 5<br>
toward the second sealing ring 9, configured so that, by the relative rotating and sliding actions of<br>
sealing end surfaces 5a and 9a that are the opposing end surfaces of the two sealing rings 5 and 9, a<br>
4<br><br>
sealed fluid region (region communicating with the interior of the rotary machine 1) H that is the region<br>
on the inner circumferential side of the relatively rotating and sliding parts 5a and 9a thereof, and a<br>
non-sealed fluid region (atmospheric region outside the rotary machine 1) L that is the region on the<br>
outer circumferential side thereof, are shielded and sealed.<br>
[0016]<br>
The seal case 2, as shown in Fig. 1, is made of metal, configured in a non-split ("non-split" means,<br>
here and below, that it is not split in the circumferential direction) circular ring-shaped member, with<br>
an L-shaped cross-section, and having an inner circumferential portion 2a of larger diameter than the<br>
rotating shaft 6. This seal case is attached to the rotary machine 1 with the rotating shaft 6 passing<br>
concentrically therethrough i.e. through the inner circumferential portion.<br>
[0017]<br>
The first sealing ring 5, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, is a circular ring-shaped member, the tip<br>
surface (left end surface) thereof being the sealing end surface 5a that is a smooth ring-shaped surface<br>
that is perpendicular to the shaft axis, and the outer circumference surface thereof being configured as a<br>
tapered surface 5b of a truncated conical shape the diameter thereof gradually increasing toward the<br>
base end (to the right), configured as a split sealing ring that is split in the circumferential direction into<br>
a plurality of (two, in the shown embodiment) circular arc-shaped segments 11 and 12. The first<br>
sealing ring 5 is bound and held in a circular ring configuration by the first binding ring 4 with the split<br>
surfaces11a and 12a (the end surfaces, in the circumferential direction, of the circular arc-shaped<br>
segments 11 and 12) butted together, and is also secured and held by the first retainer ring 3, being held<br>
by the first retainer ring 3 so that it is movable in the axial direction.<br>
[0018]<br>
The first retainer ring 3, as shown in Fig. 1, is a non-split cylindrical member, made of metal,<br>
comprising a tubular holding part 3a, and a ring-shaped flange part 3b formed integrally at the tip (left<br>
end) thereof. The first retainer ring 3 is held by the inner circumferential portion 2a of the seal case 2<br>
with an O-ring 13 in between and so as to be movable in the axial direction. The first retainer ring 3 is<br>
prevented from rotating relative to the seal case 2, in a manner being allowed to move in the axial<br>
direction through a prescribed range, by engaging a drive pin 14, provided on the seal case 2 so as to<br>
protrude therefrom, into an engagement hole 3c formed on the outer circumferential side of the flange<br>
part 3b. The portion on the inner circumferential side in the tip surface of the first retainer ring 3<br>
(portion on the inner circumferential side in the tip surface of the flange part 3b) is configured as a<br>
holding surface 3d for arresting and holding the base end surface (right end surface) 5c of the first<br>
sealing ring 5 in the axial direction. In the holding surface 3d, moreover, a drive pin 15 capable of<br>
engaging an engagement concavity 5d formed in the base end surface 5 c of the first sealing ring 5 is<br>
mounted so as to protrude therefrom. By engaging this drive pin 15 in the engagement concavity 5d,<br>
the first sealing ring 5 is prevented from rotating relative to the first retainer ring 3.<br>
[0019]<br>
5<br><br>
The first binding ring 4, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, is a non-split circular ring-shaped member,<br>
made of metal, attached by a suitable number of tightening bolts 16 to the flange part 3b of the first<br>
retainer ring 3 so that it can be freely tightened in the axial direction. On the inner circumferential<br>
surface of the first binding ring 4, a tapered surface corresponding to the outer circumferential surface<br>
(tapered surface) 5b of the first sealing ring 5, that is, a truncated conical tapered surface 4a the<br>
diameter thereof gradually increasing in the base end direction (to the right), is formed.<br>
[0020]<br>
The first sealing ring 5 that is a split sealing ring, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 3, is secured and held<br>
to the first retainer ring 3, by tightening the first binding ring 4 down to the first retainer ring 3, in such<br>
a manner that a first end-surface side elastic member 17 and a first circumferential-surface side elastic<br>
member 18 are interposed.<br>
[0021]<br>
More specifically, as shown in Fig. 3, the first binding ring 4 fitted onto the first sealing ring 5 is<br>
attached, by the tightening bolts 16, to the first retainer ring 3, in such a manner that the first end-<br>
surface side elastic member 17 is interposed between the opposing end surfaces of the first sealing ring<br>
5 and the first retainer ring 3 (between the base end surface 5c of the first sealing ring 5 and the holding<br>
surface 3d of the first retainer ring 3), in the axial direction, and in such a manner that the first<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic member 18 is interposed between the opposing circumferential<br>
surfaces of the first sealing ring 5 and the first binding ring 4 (between the tapered surface 5b that is the<br>
outer circumferential surface of the first sealing ring 5 and the tapered surface 4a that is the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the first binding ring 4). Then, from this condition, when the tightening bolts<br>
16 are sequentially tightened, that is, when the first binding ring 4 is moved in the axial direction<br>
toward the first retainer ring 3, the first sealing ring 5, by the tapered surface 4a of the first binding ring<br>
4, will be acted on by a binding force pressing via the first circumferential-surface side elastic member<br>
18 in a direction that will reduce the diameter thereof, and by a pressing force pressing the first sealing<br>
ring 5 in the axial direction via the first end-surface side elastic member 17 toward the first retainer ring<br>
3. As a result, as shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, due to the binding force described above, the first sealing<br>
ring 5 is bound and held in a circular ring configuration in which the split surfaces lla and 12a thereof<br>
are butted together, in such a manner that the first end-surface side elastic member 18 is clamped<br>
between the opposing end surfaces 4a and 5b of the first sealing ring 5 and the binding ring 4, and the<br>
first sealing ring 5 is secured and held on the holding surface 3d of the first retainer ring 3 in such a<br>
manner that the first end-surface side elastic member 17 is pressed between the opposing end surfaces<br>
3d and 5c of the first sealing ring 5 and the first retainer ring 3, in the axial direction.<br>
For the first end-surface side elastic member 17, a sheet made of an elastic material or an O-ring<br>
made of rubber or the like is used which, besides having a cushioning function capable of preventing<br>
deformation (the occurrence of distortion) in the first sealing ring 5 due to the pressing force on the<br>
holding surface 3d of the first retainer ring 3, also can have a sealing function for effecting a secondary<br>
seal between the two, that is, between the first retainer ring 3 and the first sealing ring 5. In the shown<br>
embodiment, a circular ring-shaped rubber sheet is used. In the first end-surface side elastic member<br>
(rubber sheet) 17, moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, a passage hole 17a for the drive pin 15 is formed. For<br>
the first circumferential-surface side elastic member 18, moreover, a sheet made of an elastic material,<br>
or the like, is used which has a cushioning function capable of preventing deformation (the occurrence<br>
of distortion) in the first sealing ring 5 due to the binding force of the first binding ring 4 or the pressure<br>
6<br><br>
(internal pressure) of the sealed fluid. In the shown embodiment, a rubber sheet is used that is wrapped<br>
around the entire circumference of the outer circumferential surface 5b of the first sealing ring 5.<br>
[0022]<br>
The spring member 10 is a coil spring interposed between the seal case 2 and a spring receptacle 19<br>
held so that it is movable in the axial direction in the flange part 3b of the first retainer ring 3. The<br>
spring member 10 is set up so that the contact force thereof on the second sealing ring 9 of the first<br>
sealing ring 5 due to the spring load can be adjusted preferably, by varying the position of the spring<br>
receptacle 19, in the axial direction, by an adjustment bolt 20 screwed all the way through the first<br>
binding ring 4.<br>

The second sealing ring 9 is configured as a split sealing ring similarly as the first sealing ring 5.<br>
More specifically, the second sealing ring 9, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, is a circular ring-shaped<br>
member the tip surface (right end surface) thereof being a sealing end surface 9a that is a smooth ring-<br>
shaped surface perpendicular to the axis, the outer circumferential surface thereof being configured as a<br>
truncated conical tapered surface 9b the diameter thereof gradually increasing in the base end direction<br>
(to the left), and which is split in the circumferential direction into a plurality (two, in the shown<br>
embodiment) of circular arc-shaped segments 21 and 22. The second sealing ring 9 is bound and held<br>
by the second binding ring 8 in a circular ring configuration in which the split surfaces (the end<br>
surfaces in the circumferential direction of the circular arc-shaped segments 21 and 22) 21a and 22a are<br>
butted together. The second sealing ring 9 is secured and held by the second retainer ring 7, and is<br>
secured to the rotating shaft 6 by the second retainer ring 7. The first and second sealing rings 5 and 9,<br>
depending on the sealing conditions or the like, are either both made of a hard material such as silicon<br>
carbide or the like, or one is made of a hard material such as a ceramic or superhard alloy or the like<br>
while the other is made of soft carbon or the like.<br>
[0024]<br>
The second retainer ring 7, as shown in Fig. 3, is a non-split tubular member, made of metal,<br>
secured and held on the rotating shaft 6 by a securing ring 23. The securing ring 23 is split in two in<br>
the circumferential direction, and is mated with and secured to the rotating shaft 6 by tightening it in a<br>
ring shape by a tightening bolt 24. The second retainer ring 7 is fitted onto the rotating shaft 6 in such a<br>
manner that the gap between it and the rotating shaft 6 is secondarily sealed by an O-ring 25, and is<br>
secured to the rotating shaft 6 by coupling it to the securing ring 23 by a coupling bolt 26. The portion<br>
on the inner circumferential side in the tip surface (right end surface) of the second retainer ring 7 is<br>
configured as a holding surface 7a for arresting and holding the base end surface (left end surface) 9c of<br>
the second sealing ring 9 in the axial direction. In the holding surface 7a, a drive pin 27 is provided so<br>
as to protrude therefrom, the drive pin 27being capable of engaging an engagement concavity 9d<br>
formed in the base end surface 9c of the second sealing ring 9. By engaging this drive pin 27 in the<br>
engagement concavity 9d, the second sealing ring 9 is prevented from rotating relative to the second<br>
retainer ring 7.<br>
[0025]<br>
The second binding ring 8, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5, is a non-split circular ring-shaped<br>
member, made of metal, that is attached so that it can be freely tightened, in the axial direction, to the<br>
second retainer ring 7, by a suitable number of tightening bolts 28. On the inner circumferential surface<br>
7<br><br>
of the second binding ring 8, a tapered surface corresponding to the outer circumferential surface<br>
(tapered surface) 9b of the second sealing ring 9, that is, a truncated conical tapered surface 8a the<br>
diameter thereof gradually increasing in the base end direction (to the left), is formed.<br>
[0026]<br>
The second sealing ring 9 that is a split sealing ring, as shown in Fig. 1, is secured and held to the<br>
second retainer ring 7, in such a manner that a second end-surface side elastic member 29 and a second<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic member 30 are interposed, by tightening the second binding ring 8<br>
to the second retainer ring 7.<br>
[0027]<br>
More specifically, the second end-surface side elastic member 29 is interposed between the<br>
opposing end surfaces (between the base end surface 9c of the second sealing ring 9 and the holding<br>
surface 7a of the second retainer ring 7) of the second sealing ring 9 and the second retainer ring 7, in<br>
the axial direction. Moreover, the second binding ring 8 fitted onto the second sealing ring 9 is<br>
attached to the second retainer ring 7, by the tightening bolts 28, in such a manner that the second<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic member 30 is interposed between the opposing end surfaces of the<br>
second sealing ring 9 and the second binding ring 8 (between the tapered surface 9b that is the outer<br>
circumferential surface of the second sealing ring 9 and the tapered surface 8a that is the inner<br>
circumferential surface of the second binding ring 8). Then, from this condition, the tightening bolts 28<br>
are sequentially tightened, and the second binding ring 8 is moved in the axial direction toward the<br>
second retainer ring 7. With such an operation, the second sealing ring 9, due to the tapered surface 8a<br>
of the second binding ring 8, will be acted on by a binding force pressing via the second<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic member 30 in a direction that decreases the diameter thereof, and by<br>
a pressing force that presses this second sealing ring 9 in the axial direction via the second end-surface<br>
side elastic member 29 toward the second retainer ring 7. As a result, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 5,<br>
due to the binding force, the second sealing ring 9 is bound and held in a circular ring configuration in<br>
which the split surfaces 21a and 22a thereof are butted together, in such a manner that the second<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic member 30 is clamped between the opposing end surfaces 8a and<br>
9b of the second sealing ring 9 and the second binding ring 8, and the second sealing ring 9 is secured<br>
and held on the holding surface 7a of the second retainer ring 7, in such a manner that the second end-<br>
surface side elastic member 29 is clamped between the opposing end surfaces 7a and 9c of the second<br>
sealing ring 9 and the second retainer ring 7, in the axial direction.<br>
For the second end-surface side elastic member 29, a sheet made of an elastic material or an O-ring<br>
made of rubber, or the like, which has a cushioning function capable of preventing deformation (the<br>
occurrence of distortion) in the second sealing ring 9 due to the pressing force toward the holding<br>
surface 7a of the second retainer ring 7, and also can has a sealing function for effecting a secondary<br>
seal between the two members 7 and 9, is used. In the shown embodiment, an O-ring made of rubber is<br>
used. The second end-surface side elastic member (O-ring) 29, moreover, is engaged and held in an O-<br>
ring channel formed in the holding surface 7a at a position which does not interfere with the drive pin<br>
27, and a secondary seal is effected in a non-contacting manner between the opposing end surfaces 7a<br>
and 9c of the two members 7 and 9. For the second circumferential-surface side elastic member 30, a<br>
sheet made of an elastic material having a cushioning function capable of preventing distortion (the<br>
occurrence of distortion) in the second sealing ring 9 due to the binding force of the second binding<br>
ring 8 and the pressure (internal pressure) of the sealed fluid is used. In the shown embodiment, as for<br>
the first circumferential-surface side elastic member 18, a rubber sheet is used therefor which is<br>
8<br><br>
wrapped around the entire circumference of the outer circumferential surface 9b of the second sealing<br>
ring 9.<br>
[0028]<br>
In the split mechanical seal configured as described above, when the tightening bolt 16 that attaches<br>
the binding ring 4 to the retainer ring 3 is tightened, due to the cam action (wedge action) of the<br>
opposing tapered surfaces 4a and 5b, the split sealing ring 5 is bound and also pressed toward the<br>
retainer ring 4. As a result, this split sealing ring 5 is bound and held in a circular ring configuration in<br>
which the circular arc-shaped segments 11 and 12 are butted together, and is secured and held by the<br>
retainer ring 4. Likewise when the tightening bolt 28 that attaches the binding ring 8 to the retainer ring<br>
7	is tightened, due to the cam action (wedge action) of the opposing tapered surfaces 8a and 9b, the<br>
split sealing ring 9 is bound and also pressed toward the retainer ring 7. As a result, this split sealing<br>
ring 9 is bound and held in a circular ring configuration in which the circular arc-shaped segments 21<br>
and 22 are butted together, and is secured and held by the retainer ring 7.<br>
[0029]<br>
In the above operation, the split sealing rings 5 and 9 are respectively bound in such a manner that<br>
the circumferential-surface side elastic members (rubber sheets 18 and 30) are interposed between them<br>
and the binding rings 4 and 7. Therefore, even if, due to excessive tightening of the binding rings 4 and<br>
8	to the retainer rings 3 and 7, the binding force effected by the binding rings 4 and 8 is excessive, the<br>
excessive portion of this binding force will be absorbed by the cushioning function (elastic<br>
deformation) of the circumferential-surface side elastic members 18 and 30. Hence the split sealing<br>
rings 5 and 9 will never suffer deformation or the like. Furthermore, because the split sealing rings 5<br>
and 9 are respectively bound directly by the elastic force of the circumferential-surface side elastic<br>
members 18 and 30, even in cases where the pressure (internal pressure) of the sealed fluid is high or<br>
where, due to insufficient tightening of the binding rings 4 and 8 to the retainer rings 3 and 7, the<br>
binding force effected by the binding rings 4 and 8 is insufficient, the effects of this internal pressure on<br>
the split sealing rings 5 and 9 will be absorbed and moderated by the elastic force of the<br>
circumferential-surface side elastic members 18 and 30, and the occurrence of distortion in the split<br>
sealing rings 5 and 9 can be effectively prevented.<br>
[0030]<br>
The split sealing rings 5 and 9, moreover, are respectively pressed toward the retainer rings 3 and 7<br>
in such a manner that an end-surface side elastic member (rubber sheet 17 or O-ring 29) is interposed<br>
therebetween. Accordingly, even should the pressing force of the split sealing rings 5 and 9 toward the<br>
retainer rings 3 and 7 become excessive, due to excessive tightening of the binding rings 4 and 8 to the<br>
retainer rings 3 and 7, the excessive portion of this pressing force will be absorbed by the cushioning<br>
function (elastic deformation) of the end-surface side elastic members 17 and 29. Hence the split<br>
sealing rings 5 and 9 will never suffer deformation or the like. Furthermore, the split sealing rings 5<br>
and 9 are respectively pressed by the recoil force (elastic force) of the end-surface side elastic members<br>
17 and 29 in a direction wherein they wedge toward the tapered surfaces 4a and 8a of the binding rings<br>
4 and 8 (with the first sealing ring 5 being pressed in toward the left and the second sealing ring 9<br>
pressed toward the right). Accordingly, even should the binding force by the binding rings 4 and 8 be<br>
insufficient, due to insufficient tightening of the binding rings 4 and 8 to the retainer rings 3 and 7, the<br>
split sealing rings 5 and 9 will respectively be properly bound and held. Furthermore, even in cases<br>
where the machining precision for the holding surfaces 3d and 7a of the retainer rings 3 and 7<br>
9<br><br>
respectively is low compared to that for the base end surfaces 5c and 9c of the split sealing rings 5 and<br>
9, or where distortion develops therein, the effects thereof will be absorbed by the end-surface side<br>
elastic members 17 and 29 and not imparted to the split sealing rings 5 and 9.<br>
[0031]<br>
Thus, even in cases where the binding forces effected by the binding rings 4 and 8 respectively are<br>
excessive or insufficient, or in cases where the internal pressure acting on the split sealing rings 5 and 9<br>
is high, the split sealing rings 5 and 9 will respectively be held in a proper circular ring configuration;<br>
and problems that occur with conventional seals, as described in the first part of this specification, such<br>
as deformation in the circular arc-shaped segments 11, 12, 21, and 22 that causes distortion in the<br>
sealing end surfaces 5a and 9a are prevented. Accordingly, in the present invention, irrespective of the<br>
sealing conditions or the materials of the split sealing rings 5 and 9, good sealing functions is<br>
manifested, without causing distortion to develop in the sealing end surfaces 5a and 9a or the like, and<br>
there is no need to perform rubbing together operation or breaking-in operation as described in the first<br>
part of the present specification.<br>
[0032]<br>
Moreover, the present invention is not limited to or by the embodiment described above, and it can<br>
be suitably improved or modified, within such scope as not departing from the principle of the<br>
invention. For example, the present invention is applicable also to outside mechanical seals wherein<br>
only one or other of the first and second split sealing rings 5 and 9 is a split sealing ring.<br>
