APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR CODING/DECODING BLOCK LOW<br>
DENSITY PARITY CHECK CODE WITH VARIABLE BLOCK LENGTH<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to a mobile communication<br>
system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for coding/decoding block<br>
low density parity check (LDPC) codes.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
With the rapid development of mobile communication systems, it is<br>
necessary to develop technology capable of transmitting bulk data approximating<br>
the capacity of a wire network even in a wireless environment. To meet the<br>
increasing demand for a high-speed, high-capacity communication system<br>
capable of processing and transmitting various data such as image and radio data<br>
beyond the voice-oriented service, it is essential to increase the transmission<br>
efficiency of a system by using an appropriate channel coding scheme to thereby<br>
improve the overall system performance. However, the mobile communication<br>
system, because of its characteristics, inevitably generates errors during data<br>
transmission due to noise, interference and fading according to channel conditions.<br>
The generation of errors causes a loss of a great amount of information data.<br>
In order to prevent the loss of the information data due to the generation<br>
of errors, various error control schemes are currently in use and are based in part<br>
on channel characteristics to thereby improve the reliability of the mobile<br>
communication system. The most typical error control scheme uses error<br>
correction codes.<br>
With reference to FIG. 1, a description will now be made of a structure of <br>
a transmitter/receiver in a general mobile communication system.<br>
FIG. 1 is a diagram illustrating a structure of a transmitter/receiver in a<br>
general mobile communication system. Referring to FIG. 1, a transmitter 100<br>
includes an encoder 111, a modulator 113 and a radio frequency (RF) processor<br><br>
115, and a receiver 150 includes an RF processor 151, a demodulator 153 and a<br>
decoder 155.<br>
In the transmitter 100, transmission information data 'u', if generated, is<br>
delivered to the encoder 111. The encoder 111 generates a coded symbol 'c' by<br>
coding the information data 'u' with a predetermined coding scheme, and outputs<br>
the coded symbol 'c' to the modulator 113. The modulator 113 generates a<br>
modulation symbol V by modulating the coded symbol 'c' with a predetermined<br>
modulation scheme, and outputs the modulation symbol V to the RF processor<br>
115. The RF processor 115 RF-processes the modulation symbol V output from<br>
the modulator 113, and transmits the RF-processed signal over the air via an<br>
antenna ANT.<br>
The signal transmitted over the air by the transmitter 100 in this way is<br>
received at the receiver 150 via its antenna ANT, and the signal received via the<br>
antenna is delivered to the RF processor 151. The RF processor 151 RF-processes<br>
the received signal, and outputs the RF-processed signal 'r' to the demodulator<br>
153. The demodulator 153 demodulates the RF-processed signal 'r' output from<br>
the RF processor 151 using a demodulation scheme corresponding to the<br>
modulation scheme applied in the modulator 113, and outputs the demodulated<br>
signal 'x' to the decoder 155. The decoder 155 decodes the demodulated signal<br>
'x' output from the demodulator 153 using a decoding scheme corresponding to<br>
the coding scheme applied in the encoder 111, and outputs the decoded signal ' u'<br>
as finally decoded information data.<br>
In order for the receiver 150 to decode without errors the information<br>
data 'u' transmitted by the transmitter 100, there is a need for a high-performance<br>
encoder and decoder. Particularly, because a radio channel environment should be<br>
taken into consideration because of the characteristics of a mobile communication<br>
system, errors that can be generated due to the radio channel environment should<br>
be considered more seriously.<br>
The most typical error correction codes include turbo codes and low<br>
density parity check (LDPC) codes.<br><br>
It is well known that the turbo code is superior in performance gain to a<br>
convolutional code that is conventionally used for error correction, during high-<br>
speed data transmission. The turbo code is advantageous in that it can efficiently<br>
correct an error caused by noise generated in a transmission channel, thereby<br>
increasing the reliability of the data transmission. The LDPC code can be decoded<br>
using an iterative decoding algorithm base on a sum-product algorithm in a factor<br>
graph. Because a decoder for the LDPC code uses the sum-product algorithm-<br>
based iterative decoding algorithm, it is less complex than a decoder for the turbo<br>
code. In addition, the decoder for the LDPC code is easy to implement with a<br>
parallel processing decoder, compared with the decoder for the turbo code.<br>
Shannon's channel coding theorem illustrates that reliable communication<br>
is possible only at a data rate not exceeding a channel capacity. However,<br>
Shannon's channel coding theorem has proposed no detailed channel<br>
coding/decoding method for supporting a data rate up to the maximum channel<br>
capacity limit. Generally, although a random code having a very large block size<br>
exhibits a performance approximating a channel capacity limit of Shannon's<br>
channel coding theorem, when a MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) or ML<br>
(Maximum Likelihood) decoding method is used, it is actually impossible to<br>
implement the decoding method because of its heavy calculation load.<br>
The turbo code was proposed by Berrou, Glavieux and Thitimajshima in<br>
1993, and exhibits a superior performance that approximates a channel capacity<br>
limit of Shannon's channel coding theorem. The proposal of the turbo code<br>
triggered active research on iterative decoding and graphical expression of codes,<br>
and LDPC codes proposed by Gallager in 1962 have been newly spotlighted in<br>
the research. Cycles exist in a factor graph of the turbo code and the LDPC code,<br>
and it is well known that iterative decoding in the factor graph of the LDPC code,<br>
where cycles exist, is suboptimal. Also, it has been experimentally proven that the<br>
LDPC code has excellent performance through iterative decoding. The LDPC<br>
code known to have the highest performance ever exhibits performances having a<br>
difference of only about 0.04 [dB] at a channel capacity limit of Shannon's<br>
 channel coding theorem at a bit error rate (BER) 10-5, using a block size 107. In<br>
addition, although an LDPC code defined in Galois Field (GF) with q&gt;2, i.e.<br>
GF(q), increases in complexity in its decoding process, it is much superior in<br><br>
performance to a binary code. However, there is no satisfactory theoretical<br>
description of successful decoding by an iterative decoding algorithm for the<br>
LDPC code defined in GF(q).<br>
The LDPC code, proposed by Gallager, is defined by a parity check<br>
matrix in which most of elements have a value of 0 and minor elements except<br>
the elements having the value of 0 have a non-zero value, e.g., a value of 1. In the<br>
following description, it will be assumed that a non-zero value is a value of 1.<br>
For example, an (N, j, k) LDPC code is a linear block code having a<br>
block length N, and is defined by a sparse parity check matrix in which each<br>
column has j elements having a value of 1, each row has k elements having a<br>
value of 1, and all of the elements except for the elements having the value of 1<br>
have a value of 0.<br>
An LDPC code in which a weight of each column in the parity check<br>
matrix is fixed to 'j' and a weight of each row in the parity check matrix is fixed<br>
to 'k' as described above, is called a "regular LDPC code." Herein, the "weight"<br>
refers to the number of elements having a non-zero value among the elements<br>
constituting the parity check matrix. Unlike the regular LDPC code, an LDPC<br>
code in which the weight of each column in the parity check matrix and the<br>
weight of each row in the parity check matrix are not fixed is called an "irregular<br>
LDPC code." It is generally known that the irregular LDPC code is superior in<br>
performance to the regular LDPC code. However, in the case of the irregular<br>
LDPC code, because the weight of each column and the weight of each row in the<br>
parity check matrix are not fixed, i.e. are irregular, the weight of each column in<br>
the parity check matrix and the weight of each row in the parity check matrix<br>
must be properly adjusted in order to guarantee the superior performance.<br>
 With reference to FIG. 2, a description will now be made of a parity<br>
check matrix of an (8, 2,4) LDPC code as an example of an (N, j, k) LDPC code.<br>
FIG. 2 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix of a general (8, 2, 4)<br>
LDPC code. Referring to FIG. 2, a parity check matrix H of the (8, 2, 4) LDPC<br>
code is comprised of 8 columns and 4 rows, wherein a weight of each column is<br><br>
fixed to 2 and a weight of each row is fixed to 4. Because the weight of each<br>
column and the weight of each row in the parity check matrix are regular as stated<br>
above, the (8, 2, 4) LDPC code illustrated in FIG. 2 becomes a regular LDPC<br>
code.<br>
The parity check matrix of the (8, 2, 4) LDPC code has been described so<br>
far with reference to FIG. 2. Next, a factor graph of the (8, 2, 4) LDPC code<br>
described in connection with FIG. 2 will be described herein below with reference<br>
to FIG. 3.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a factor graph of the (8, 2, 4) LDPC code<br>
of FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 3, a factor graph of the (8, 2, 4) LDPC code is<br>
comprised of 8 variable nodes of x1 300, x2 302, x3 304, X4 306, x5 308, X6 310, x7<br>
312 and x8 314, and 4 check nodes 316, 318, 320 and 322. When an element<br>
having a value of 1, i.e. a non-zero value, exists at a point where an ith row and a<br>
j column of the parity check matrix of the (8, 2, 4) LDPC code cross each other,<br>
a branch is created between a variable node x; and a j check node.<br>
Because the parity check matrix of the LDPC code has a very small<br>
weight as described above, it is possible to perform decoding through iterative<br>
decoding even in a block code having a relatively long length, that exhibits<br>
performance approximating a channel capacity limit of Shannon's channel coding<br>
theorem, such as a turbo code, while continuously increasing a block length of the<br>
block code. MacKay and Neal have proven that an iterative decoding process of<br>
an LDPC code using a flow transfer scheme approximates an iterative decoding<br>
process of a turbo code in performance.<br>
In order to generate a high-performance LDPC code, the following<br>
conditions should be satisfied.<br>
(1) Cycles on a factor graph of an LDPC code should be considered.<br>
The term "cycle" refers to a loop formed by the edges connecting the<br>
variable nodes-to the cheek nodes in a factor graph of an LDPC icode, and a fength<br>
of the cycle is defined as the number of edges constituting the loop. A long cycle<br>
means that the number of edges connecting the variable nodes to the check nodes<br><br>
constituting the loop in the factor graph of the LDPC code is large. In contrast, a<br>
short cycle means that the number of edges connecting the variable nodes to the<br>
check nodes constituting the loop in the factor graph of the LDPC code is small.<br>
As cycles in the factor graph of the LDPC code become longer, the<br>
performance efficiency of the LDPC code increases, for the following reasons.<br>
That is, when long cycles are generated in the factor graph of the LDPC code, it is<br>
possible to prevent performance degradation such as an error floor occurring<br>
when too many cycles with a short length exist on the factor graph of the LDPC<br>
code.<br>
(2)	Efficient coding of an LDPC code should be considered.<br>
It is difficult for the LDPC code to undergo real-time coding compared<br>
with a convolutional code or a turbo code because of its high coding complexity.<br>
In order to reduce the coding complexity of the LDPC code, a Repeat Accumulate<br>
(RA) code has been proposed. However, the RA code also has a limitation in<br>
reducing the coding complexity of the LDPC code. Therefore, efficient coding of<br>
the LDPC code should be taken into consideration.<br>
(3)	Degree distribution on a factor graph of an LDPC code should be<br>
considered.<br>
Generally, an irregular LDPC code is superior in performance to a regular<br>
LDPC code, because a factor graph of the irregular LDPC code has various<br>
degrees. The term "degree" refers to the number of edges connected to the<br>
variable nodes and the check nodes in the factor graph of the LDPC code. Further,<br>
the phrase "degree distribution" on a factor graph of an LDPC code refers to a<br>
ratio of the number of nodes having a particular degree to the total number of<br>
nodes. It has been proven by Richardson that an LDPC code having a particular<br>
degree distribution is superior in performance.<br>
With reference to FIG. 4, a description will now be made of a parity<br>
check matrix of a block LDPC code.	<br>
FIG. 4 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix of a general block<br>
LDPC code. Before a description of FIG. 4 is given, it should be noted that the<br><br>
block LDPC code is a new LDPC code for which not only efficient coding but<br>
also efficient storage and performance improvement of a parity check matrix were<br>
considered, and the block LDPC code is an LDPC code extended by generalizing<br>
a structure of a regular LDPC code. Referring to FIG. 4, a parity check matrix of<br>
the block LDPC code is divided into a plurality of partial blocks, and a<br>
permutation matrix is mapped to each of the partial blocks. In FIG. 4, 'P'<br>
represents a permutation matrix having an NsxNs size, and a superscript (or<br>
exponent) apq of the permutation matrix P is either 0<apq or apq="oo.&lt;br/">
In addition, 'p' indicates that a corresponding permutation matrix is<br>
located in the p row of the partial blocks of the parity check matrix, and 'q'<br>
indicates that a corresponding permutation matrix is located in the q* column of<br>
the partial blocks of the parity check matrix. That is, Papq represents a<br>
permutation matrix located in a partial block where the p row and the q column<br>
of the parity check matrix comprised of a plurality of partial blocks cross each<br>
other. That is, the 'p' and the 'q' represent the number of rows and the number of<br>
columns of partial blocks corresponding to an information part in the parity check<br>
matrix, respectively.<br>
The permutation matrix will now be described with reference to FIG. 5.<br>
FIG. 5 is a diagram illustrating the permutation matrix P of FIG. 4. As<br>
illustrated in FIG. 5, the permutation matrix P is a square matrix having an NsxNs<br>
size, and each of Ns columns constituting the permutation matrix P has a weight<br>
of 1 and each of Ns rows constituting the permutation matrix P also has a weight<br>
of 1. Herein, although a size of the permutation matrix P is expressed as NsxNs, it<br>
will also be expressed as Ns because the permutation matrix P is a square matrix.<br>
In FIG. 4, a permutation matrix P with a superscript apq=0, i.e. a<br>
, permutation matrix P°? represents an identity matrix INtXNs, and a permutation<br>
matrix P with a superscript apq=oo, i.e. a permutation matrix P00, represents a zero<br>
matrix. Herein, IN xNs represents an identity matrix with a size NsxNs.<br>
In the entire parity check matrix of the block LDPC code illustrated in<br>
FIG. 4, because the total number of rows is Nsxp and the total number of columns<br><br>
is Nsxq (for p<q when the entire parity check matrix of ldpc code has a full></q>
rank, a coding rate can be expressed as Equation (1) regardless of a size of the<br>
partial blocks.<br><br>
If apq^oo for all p and q, the permutation matrixes corresponding to the<br>
partial blocks are not zero matrixes, and the partial blocks constitute a regular<br>
LDPC code in which the weight value of each column and the weight value of<br>
each row in each of the permutation matrixes corresponding to the partial blocks<br>
are p and q, respectively. Herein, each of permutation matrixes corresponding to<br>
the partial blocks will be referred to as a "partial matrix."<br>
Because (p-1) dependent rows exist in the entire parity check matrix, a<br>
coding rate is greater than the coding rate calculated by Equation (1). In the case<br>
of the block LDPC code, if a weight position of a first row of each of the partial<br>
matrixes constituting the entire parity check matrix is determined, the weight<br>
positions of the remaining (Ns-1) rows can be determined. Therefore, the required<br>
size of a memory is reduced to 1/NS as compared with the case where the weights<br>
are irregularly selected to store information on the entire parity check matrix.<br>
As described above, the term "cycle" refers to a loop formed by the edges<br>
connecting the variable nodes to the check nodes in a factor graph of an LDPC<br>
code, and a length of the cycle is defined as the number of edges constituting the<br>
loop. A long cycle means that the number of edges connecting the variable nodes<br>
to the check nodes constituting the loop in the factor graph of the LDPC code is<br>
large. As cycles in the factor graph of the LDPC code become longer, the<br>
performance efficiency of the LDPC code increases.<br>
In contrast, as cycles in the factor graph of the LDPC code become<br>
shorter, an error correction capability of the LDPC code decreases because<br>
performance degradation such as an error floor occurs. That is, when there are<br>
many cycles with a short length in a factor graph of the LDPC code, information<br>
on a particular node belonging to the cycle with a short length, starting therefrom,<br><br>
returns after a small number of iterations. As the number of iterations increases,<br>
the information returns to the corresponding node more frequently, so that the<br>
information cannot be correctly updated, thereby causing a deterioration in an<br>
error correction capability of the LDPC code.<br>
With reference to FIG. 6, a description will now be made of a cycle<br>
structure of a block LDPC code.<br>
FIG. 6 is a diagram illustrating a cycle structure of a block LDPC code of<br>
which a parity check matrix is comprised of 4 partial matrixes. Before a<br>
description of FIG. 6 is given, it should be noted that the block LDPC code is a<br>
new LDPC code for which not only efficient coding but also efficient storage and<br>
performance improvement of a parity check matrix were considered. The block<br>
LDPC code is also an LDPC code extended by generalizing a structure of a<br>
regular LDPC code. A parity check matrix of the block LDPC code illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6 is comprised of 4 partial blocks, a diagonal line represents a position where<br>
the elements having a value of 1 are located, and the portions other than the<br>
diagonal-lined portions represent positions where the elements having a value of<br>
0 are located. In addition, 'P' represents the same permutation matrix as the<br>
permutation matrix described in conjunction with FIG. 5.<br>
In order to analyze a cycle structure of the block LDPC code illustrated in<br>
FIG. 6, an element having a value of 1 located in an i row of a partial matrix P is<br>
defined as a reference element, and an element having a value of 1 located in the<br>
ith row will be referred to as a "0-point." Herein, "partial matrix" will refer to a<br>
matrix corresponding to the partial block. The 0-point is located in an (i+af1<br>
column of the partial matrix Pa.<br>
An element having a value of 1 in a partial matrix P , located in the same<br>
row as the G-point, will be referred to as a "1-point." For the same reason as the 0-<br>
point, the 1-point is located in an (i+b)&amp; column of the partial matrix Pb.<br>
 Next, an element having a value ofl in a partial matrix Pc, located in the<br>
same column as the 1-point, will be referred to as a "2-point." Because the partial<br>
matrix Pc is a matrix acquired by shifting respective columns of an identity matrix<br><br>
I to the right with respect to a modulo Ns by c, the 2-point is located in an (i+b-<br>
c)* row of the partial matrix Pc.<br>
In addition, an element having a value of 1 in a partial matrix Pd, located<br>
in the same row as the 2-point, will be referred to as a "3-point." The 3-point is<br>
located in an (i+b-c+d)th column of the partial matrix Pd.<br>
Finally, an element having a value of 1 in the partial matrix Pa, located in<br>
the same column as the 3-point, will be referred to as a "4-point." The 4-point is<br>
located in an (i+b-c+d-a)* row of the partial matrix Pa.<br>
In the cycle structure of the LDPC code illustrated in FIG. 6, if a cycle<br>
with a length of 4 exists, the 0-point and the 4-point are located in the same<br>
position. That is, a relation between the 0-point and the 4-point is defined by<br>
Equation (2)<br><br>
As a result, when the relationship of Equation (3) is satisfied, a cycle with<br>
a length 4 is generated. Generally, when a 0-point and a 4p-point are first identical<br>
to each other, a relation of i = i + p(b-c + d-e)(modNs) is given, and the<br>
following relation shown in Equation (4) is satisfied.<br><br>
In other words, if a positive integer having a minimum value among the<br>
positive integers satisfying Equation (4) for a given a, b, c and d is defined as 'p',<br>
a cycle with a length of 4p becomes a cycle having a minimum length in the cycle<br>
structure of the block LDPC code illustrated in FIG. 6.<br><br>
In conclusion, as described above, for (a-b+c-d)*0, if gcd(Ns, a-b+c-d)=l<br>
is satisfied, then p = Ns. Herein, the gcd(Ns, a-b+c-d) is the function for<br>
calculating the "greatest common divisor" of the integers Ns and a-b+c-d.<br>
Therefore, a cycle with a length of 4NS becomes a cycle with a minimum length.<br>
A Richardson-Urbanke technique will be used as a coding technique for<br>
the block LDPC code. Because the Richardson-Urbanke technique is used as a<br>
coding technique, coding complexity can be minimized as the form of a parity<br>
check matrix becomes similar to the form of a full lower triangular matrix.<br>
With reference to FIG. 7, a description will now be made of a parity<br>
check matrix having a form similar to the form of the full lower triangular matrix.<br>
FIG. 7 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix having a form<br>
similar to the form of the full lower triangular matrix. The parity check matrix<br>
illustrated in FIG. 7 is different from the parity check matrix having a form of the<br>
full lower triangular matrix in the form of the parity part. In FIG. 7, a superscript<br>
(or exponent) apq of the permutation matrix P of an information part is either<br>
0<apq or apq="oo," as described above. a permutation matrix p with></apq>
superscript apq=0, i.e. a permutation matrix P°, of the information part represents<br>
an identity matrix INxN , and a permutation matrix P with a superscript apq=oo, i.e.<br>
a permutation matrix P00, represents a zero matrix. In. FIG.7, 'p' represents the<br>
number of rows of partial blocks mapped to the information part, and 'q'<br>
represents the number of columns of partial blocks mapped to the parity part.<br>
Also, superscripts ap, x and y of the permutation matrixes P mapped to the parity<br>
part represent exponents of the permutation matrix P. However, for the<br>
convenience of explanation, the different superscripts ap, x and y are used to<br>
distinguish the parity part from the information part. That is, in FIG. 7, Pa' and<br>
Pa" are also permutation matrixes, and the superscripts ai to ap are sequentially<br>
indexed to partial matrixes* located in a diagonal part of the parity part. In addftibn,<br>
Px and Py are also permutation matrixes, and for the convenience of explanation,<br>
they are indexed in a different way to distinguish the parity part from the<br>
inforaiatio'n part. If a block length of a block LDPC cod&amp;na^m'g the parity check<br>
matrix illustrated in FIG. 7 is assumed to be N, the coding complexity of the block<br>
LDPC code linearly increases with respect to the block length N (0(N)).<br><br>
The biggest problem of the LDPC code having the parity check matrix of<br>
FIG. 7 is that if a length of a partial block is defined as Ns, Ns check nodes whose<br>
degrees are always 1 in a factor graph of the block LDPC code are generated. The<br>
check nodes with a degree of 1 cannot affect the performance improvement based<br>
on the iterative decoding. Therefore, a standard irregular LDPC code based on the<br>
Richardson-Urbanke technique does not include a check node with a degree of 1.<br>
Therefore, a parity check matrix of FIG. 7 will be assumed as a basic parity check<br>
matrix in order to design a parity check matrix such that it enables efficient<br>
coding while not including a check node with a degree of 1. In the parity check<br>
matrix of FIG. 7 comprised of the partial matrixes, the selection of a partial matrix<br>
is a very important factor for a performance improvement of the block LDPC<br>
code, so that finding an appropriate selection criterion for the partial matrix also<br>
becomes a very important factor.<br>
A description will now be made of a method for designing the parity<br>
check matrix of the block LDPC code based on the foregoing block LDPC code.<br>
In order to facilitate a method of designing a parity check matrix of the<br>
block LDPC code and a method for coding the block LDPC code, the parity<br>
check matrix illustrated in FIG. 7 is assumed to be formed with 6 partial matrixes<br>
as illustrated in FIG. 8.<br>
FIG. 8 is a diagram illustrating the parity check matrix of FIG. 7 which is<br>
divided into 6 partial blocks. Referring to FIG. 8, a parity check matrix of the<br>
block LDPC code illustrated in FIG. 7 is divided into an information part V, a<br>
first parity part pi, and a second parity part p2. The information part V represents<br>
a part of the parity check matrix, mapped to an actual information word during<br>
the process of coding a block LDPC code, like the information part described in<br>
conjunction with FIG 7, but for the convenience of explanation, the information<br>
part '&amp;' is represented by different reference letters. The first parity part pi and the<br>
second parity part p2 represent a part of the parity check matrix, mapped to an<br>
actual parity during the process of coding the block LDPC code, like the parity<br>
pail described in conjunction with FIG.-7, and the'parity part is divided into two<br>
parts.<br><br>
Partial matrixes A and C correspond to partial blocks A(802) and C<br>
(804)of the information part V, partial matrixes B and D correspond to partial<br>
blocks B(806) and D(808) of the first parity part pi, and partial matrixes T and E<br>
correspond to partial blocks T(810) and E (812)of the second parity part p2.<br>
Although the parity check matrix is divided into 7 partial blocks in FIG. 8, it<br>
should be noted that '0' is not a separate partial block and because the partial<br>
matrix T corresponding to the partial block T (810) have a full lower triangular<br>
form, a region where zero matrixes are arranged on the basis of a diagonal is<br>
represented by '0'. A process of simplifying a coding method using the partial<br>
matrixes of the information part 's', the first parity part pi and the second parity<br>
part p2 will be described later with reference to FIG. 10.<br>
The partial matrixes of FIG. 8 will now be described herein below with<br>
reference to FIG. 9.<br>
FIG. 9 is a diagram illustrating a transpose matrix of the partial matrix B<br>
shown in FIG. 8, the partial matrix E, the partial matrix T, and an inverse matrix<br>
of the partial matrix T, in the parity check matrix of FIG. 7.<br>
Referring to FIG. 9, a partial matrix B represents a transpose matrix of<br>
the partial matrix B, and a partial matrix T1 represents an inverse matrix of the<br>
partial matrix T. The p(K~ki) represents . The permutation matrixes<br>
illustrated in FIG. 9, for example, P°l, may be an identity matrix. As described<br>
above, if a superscript of the permutation matrix, i.e. ai is 0, the P"1 will be an<br>
identity matrix. Also, if a superscript of the permutation matrix, i.e. ai increases<br>
by a predetermined value, the permutation matrix is cyclic shifted by the<br>
predetermined value, so the permutation matrix P"1 will be an identity matrix.<br>
With reference to FIG. 10, a description will now be made of a'process of<br>
designing a parity check matrix of the block LDPC code.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for generating a parity<br>
check matrix of a general block LDPC code. Before a description of FIG. 10 is<br>
given, it should be noted that in order to generate a block LDPC code, a codeword<br><br>
size and a coding rate of a block LDPC code to be generated must be determined,<br>
and a size of a parity check matrix must be determined according to the<br>
determined codeword size and coding rate. If a codeword size of the block LDPC<br>
code is represented by N and a coding rate is represented by R, a size of a parity<br>
check matrix becomes N(l-R)xN. Actually, the procedure for generating a parity<br>
check matrix of a block LDPC code illustrated in FIG. 10 is performed only once,<br>
because the parity check matrix is initially generated to be suitable for a situation<br>
of a communication system and thereafter, the generated parity check matrix is<br>
used.<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, in step 1011, a controller divides a parity check<br>
matrix with the size N(l-R)xN into a total of pxq blocks, including p blocks in a<br>
horizontal axis and q blocks in a vertical axis, and then proceeds to step 1013.<br>
Because each of the blocks has a size of NsxNs, the parity check matrix is<br>
comprised of Nsxp columns and Nsxq rows. In step 1013, the controller classifies<br>
the pxq blocks divided from the parity check matrix into an information part's', a<br>
first parity part p1? and a second parity part p2, and then proceeds to steps 1015<br>
and 1021.<br>
In step 1015, the controller separates the information part 's' into non-<br>
zero blocks, or non-zero matrixes, and zero blocks, or zero matrixes according to<br>
the degree of distribution for guaranteeing a good performance of the block<br>
LDPC code, and then proceeds to step 1017. Because the degree of distribution<br>
for guaranteeing a good performance of the block LDPC code has been described<br>
above, a detailed description thereof will omitted herein. In step 1017, the<br>
controller determines the permutation matrixes Papq such that a minimum cycle<br>
length of a block cycle should be maximized as described above in the non-zero<br>
matrix portions in blocks having a low degree from among the blocks determined<br>
according to the degree distribution for guaranteeing a good performance of the<br>
;,block LDPC code, and then proceeds to step K)19<. the permutation matrixes></.>
P0pq should be determined taking into consideration the block cycles of not only<br>
the information part V but also the first parity partpi and the second parity part<br>
In step 1019, the controller randomly determines the permutation<br><br>
matrixes P"M in the non-zero matrix portions in the blocks having a high degree<br>
among the blocks determined according to the degree distribution for<br>
guaranteeing a good performance of the block LDPC code, and then ends the<br>
procedure. Even when the permutation matrixes Papq to be applied to the non-<br>
zero matrix portions in the blocks having a high degree are determined, the<br>
permutation matrixes Papq must be determined by such that a minimum cycle<br>
length of a block cycle is maximized, and the permutation matrixes P"n are<br>
determined considering the block cycles of not only the information part V but<br>
also the first parity part px and the second parity part p2. An example of the<br>
permutation matrixes Papq arranged in the information part 's' of the parity<br>
check matrix is illustrated in FIG. 7.<br>
In step 1021, the controller divides the first part pi and the second parity<br>
part p2 into 4 partial matrixes B, T, D and E, and then proceeds to step 1023. In<br>
step 1023, the controller inputs the non-zero permutation matrixes Py and Pa&gt; to<br>
2 partial blocks among the partial blocks constituting the partial matrix B, and<br>
then proceeds to step 1025. The structure for inputting the non-zero permutation<br>
matrixes Py and P"1 to 2 partial blocks among the partial blocks constituting the<br>
partial matrix B has been described with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
In step 1025, the controller inputs the identity matrixes I to the diagonal<br>
partial blocks of the partial matrix T, inputs the particular permutation matrixes<br>
P"2,Pa\---,Pa"-1 to (i, i+1)* partial blocks under the diagonal components of the<br>
partial matrix T, and then proceeds to step 1027. The structure for inputting the<br>
identity matrixes I to the diagonal partial blocks of the partial matrix T and<br>
inputting the particular permutation matrixes P"2, Pa&gt;, • ■ •, P""-1 to (i, i+1 )* partial<br>
blocks under the diagonal components of the partial matrix T has been described<br>
with reference to FIG. 9.<br>
..
D,. and then proceeds to step 1029. In step 1029, the controller inputs a<br>
permutation matrix P"m to only the last partial block in the partial matrix E, and<br>
•then ends the procedure. The structure for inputting the 2 permutation matrixes<br>
P"m to only the last partial block among the partial blocks constituting the partial<br>
matrix E has been described with reference to FIG. 9.<br><br>

example of a structured low-density parity-check code whose algebraic structure<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
As described above, it is known that the LDPC code, together with the<br>
turbo code, has a high performance gain during high-speed data transmission and<br>
effectively corrects an error caused by noise generated in a transmission channel,<br>
contributing to an increase in the reliability of the data transmission. However, the<br>
LDPC code is disadvantageous in the coding rate, because the LDPC code has a<br>
relatively high coding rate, and it has a limitation in terms of the coding rate.<br>
Among the currently available LDPC codes, the major LDPC codes have a<br>
coding rate of 1/2 and only minor LDPC codes have a coding rate of 1/3. The<br>
limitation in the coding rate exerts a fatal influence on the high-speed, high-<br>
capacity data transmission. Of course, although a degree of distribution<br>
representing the best performance can be calculated using a density evolution<br>
scheme in order to implement a relatively low coding rate for the LDPC code, it<br>
is difficult to implement an LDPC code having a degree distribution representing<br>
the best performance due to various restrictions, such as a cycle structure in a<br>
factor graph and hardware implementation.<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus<br>
and method for coding/decoding an LDPC code having a variable block length in<br>
a mobile communication system.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Several preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following<br>
description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations<br>
incorporated herein has been omitted for conciseness.<br>
The present invention proposes an apparatus and method for coding and<br>
decoding a block low density parity check (LDPC) code having a variable length<br>
(hereinafter referred to as a "variable-length block LDPC code"). That is, the<br>
present invention proposes an apparatus and method for coding and decoding a »<br>
variable-length block LDPC code in which a length of minimum cycle in a factor<br>
graph of a block LDPC code is maximized, the coding complexity of the block<br>
LDPC code is-ihimmized,* 2c degree distribution in the factor graph of the'block<br>
LDPC code has an optimal value of 1, and the variable block lengths are<br>
supported. Although not separately illustrated in the specification, the coding and<br><br>
decoding apparatus for a variable-length block LDPC code according to the<br>
present invention can be applied to the transmitter/receiver described with<br>
reference to FIG. 1.<br>
The next generation mobile communication system has evolved into a<br>
packet service communication system, and the packet service communication<br>
system, which is a system for transmitting burst packet data to a plurality of<br>
mobile stations, has been designed to be suitable for high-capacity data<br>
transmission. In order to increase the data throughput, a Hybrid Automatic<br>
Retransmission Request (HARQ) scheme and an Adaptive Modulation and<br>
Coding (AMC) scheme have been proposed. As the HARQ scheme and the AMC<br>
scheme support a variable coding rate, there is a need for block LDPC codes<br>
having various block lengths.<br>
The design of the variable-length block LDPC code, like the design of a<br>
general LDPC code, is implemented through the design of a parity check matrix.<br>
However, in a mobile communication system, in order to provide a variable-<br>
length block LDPC code with one CODEC, i.e. in order to provide block LDPC<br>
codes having various block lengths, the parity check matrix should include parity<br>
check matrixes capable of representing block LDPC codes having different block<br>
lengths. A description will now be made of a parity check matrix of a block<br>
LDPC code providing a variable block length.<br>
First, a block LDPC code having a minimum length required in the<br>
system is designed for a desired coding rate. In the parity check matrix, if Ns<br>
indicating a size of its partial matrix is increased, a block LDPC code having a<br>
long block length is generated. The "partial matrix," as described above, refers to<br>
a permutation matrix corresponding to each of partial blocks obtained by dividing<br>
the parity check matrix into a plurality of partial blocks. Assuming that the block<br>
LDPC code is extended in such a manner that a block LDPC code with a short<br>
length is first designed and then a block LDPC code with a long length is<br>
• designed..because an increase in the size N's-of the'partial* matrix leads to a<br>
■*• modification in the cycle structure, the exponents of the^drmutation matrixes of<br>
the parity check matrix are selected such that a cycle length should be maximized.<br>
Herein, a size of the partial matrix being Ns means that the partial matrix is a<br><br>
square matrix having a size of NsxNs, and for the convenience of description, the<br>
size of the partial matrix is represented by Ns.<br>
For example, assuming that a partial block size of a basic block LDPC<br>
code is Ns=2, when it is desired to extend the basic block LDPC code with Ns=2<br>
to a block LDPC code with Ns=4 which is 2 times longer in length than the basic<br>
block LDPC code, a partial matrix, an exponent of which is 0, in a permutation<br>
matrix, can select a value of 0 or 2 if its length increases from Ns=2 to Ns=4.<br>
Among the two values, a value capable of maximizing the cycle should be<br>
selected. Likewise, in a block LDPC code with Ns=2, a partial matrix with an<br>
exponent of 1 can select a value of 1 or 3 if its length increases from Ns=2 to<br>
Ns=4.<br>
As described above, it is possible to design a block LDPC code having<br>
maximum performance for each block length by designing a block LDPC code<br>
using the basic block LDPC code while increasing a value Ns. In addition, one<br>
random block LDPC code among block LDPC codes having various lengths can<br>
be defined as a basic block LDPC code, contributing to an increase in memory<br>
efficiency. A description will now be made of a method for generating a parity<br>
check matrix of the variable-length block LDPC code. The present invention<br>
proposes 4 types of parity check matrixes for the variable-length block LDPC<br>
code according to coding rates, and the coding rates taken into consideration in<br>
the present invention include 1/2, 2/3, 3/4 and 5/6.<br>
Before a description of the parity check matrixes of the variable-length<br>
block LDPC code for the coding rates 1/2, 2/3, 3/4 and 5/6 is given, a process of<br>
coding a variable-length block LDPC code using a parity check matrix designed<br>
in the present invention will now be described with reference to FIG. 15.<br>
FIG. 15 is a flowchart illustrating a process of coding a variable-length<br>
block LDPC code according to first to fourth embodiments of the present<br>
invention. Before a description of FIG 15 is given, it is assumed that a parity ■■'.<br>
check matrix for the variable-length' block LDPC code is comprised of 6 partial ^ •<br>
matrixes as described with reference to FIG. 8.<br><br>
Referring to FIG. 15, in step 1511, a controller (not shown) receives an<br>
information word vector ' s' to be coded into the variable-length block LDPC<br>
code, and then proceeds to steps 1513 and 1515. It is assumed herein that a length<br>
of the information word vector ' s' received to be coded into the block LDPC<br>
code is k. In step 1513, the controller matrix-multiplies the received information<br>
word vector 's' by a partial matrix A of the parity check matrix (As), and then<br>
proceeds to step 1517. Herein, because the number of elements having a value of<br>
1 located in the partial matrix A is much less than the number of elements having<br>
a value of 0, the matrix multiplication (As) of the information word vector s<br>
and the partial matrix A of the parity check matrix can be achieved with a<br>
relatively small number of sum-product operations. In addition, in the partial<br>
matrix A, because the position where elements having a value of 1 are located can<br>
be expressed as exponential multiplication of a position of a non-zero block and a<br>
permutation matrix of the block, the matrix multiplication can be performed with<br>
a very simple operation as compared with a random parity check matrix. In step<br>
1515, the controller performs matrix multiplication (Cs) on a partial matrix C of<br>
the parity check matrix and the information word vector ' s', and then proceeds to<br>
step 1519.<br>
In step 1517, the controller performs matrix multiplication (ET_1As) on<br>
the matrix multiplication result (As) of the information word vector 's' and the<br>
partial matrix A of the parity check matrix, and a matrix ET"1, and then proceeds<br>
to step 1519. Herein, because the number of elements having a value of 1 in the<br>
matrix ET"1 is very small as described above, if an exponent of a permutation<br>
matrix of the block is given, the matrix multiplication can be simply performed.<br>
In step 1519, the controller calculates a first parity vector P] by adding the ET"<br>
!As and the Cs (P^ET^As+Cs), and then proceeds to step 1521. Herein, the<br>
addition operation is an exclusive OR (XOR) operation, and its result becomes 0<br>
for an operation between bits having the same value and 1 for an operation<br>
between bits having.different vaiues. That is, the process up to step 1519 is a ?<br>
process for calculating the fir,st parity vector Pj.<br>
Instep" 1521,"the controller multiplies a partial matrix*® ofihe1 parity<br>
check matrix by the first parity vector P^ (B Pt), adds the multiplication result<br>
(BP,) to the As (As + BP^), and then proceeds to step 1523. If the information<br><br>
word vector ' s ' and the first parity vector P, are given, they should be<br>
multiplied by an inverse matrix T'1 of a partial matrix T of the parity check matrix<br>
to calculate a second parity vector P2. Therefore, in step 1523, the controller<br>
multiplies the calculation result (As+ BPj) of step 1521 by the inverse matrix T"1<br>
of the partial matrix T to calculate the second parity vector P2 (P2=T_1(As +<br>
BP^)), and then proceeds to step 1525. As described above, if the information<br>
word vector ' s' of a block LDPC code to be coded is given, the first parity vector<br>
P, and the second parity vector P2 can be calculated, and as a result, all<br>
codeword vectors can be obtained. In step 1525, the controller generates a<br>
codeword vector ' c' using the information word vector ' s', the first parity vector<br>
P_! and the second parity vector P2, and transmits the generated codeword vector<br>
'cNext, with reference to FIG. 16, a description will be made of an internal<br>
structure of an apparatus for coding a variable-length block LDPC code according<br>
to the embodiments of the present invention.<br>
FIG. 16 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of an<br>
apparatus for coding a variable-length block LDPC code according to<br>
embodiments of the present invention. Referring to FIG. 16, the apparatus for<br>
coding a variable-length block LDPC code includes a matrix-A multiplier 1611,<br>
matrix-C multiplier 1613, a matrix-ET1 multiplier 1615, an adder 1617, a matrix-<br>
B multiplier 1619, an adder 1621, a matrix T1 multiplier 1623, and switches 1625,<br>
1627 and 1629.<br>
If an input signal, i.e. a length-k information word vector ' s' to be coded<br>
into a variable-length block LDPC code, is received, the received length-k<br>
information word vector 's' is input to the switch 1625, the matrix-A multiplier<br>
1611 and the matrix-C multiplier 1613. The matrix-A multiplier 1611 multiplies<br>
, the information word vector 's' by a partial matrix A of the full parity check<br>
matrix, and outputs the multiplication result to the matrix-ET"1 multiplier 1615<br>
and the adder 1621. The matrix-C multiplier 1613 multiplies the information<br>
*» wordtveetor-' s' by a partial matrix C of th©*full"parity-dieck matrix, and outputs<br>
the multiplication result to the adder 1617. The matrix-ET"1 multiplier 1615<br>
multiplies the signal output from the matrix-A multiplier 1611 by a partial matrix<br><br>
ET"1 of the full parity check matrix, and outputs the multiplication result to the<br>
adder 1617.<br>
The adder 1617 adds the signal output from the matrix-ET'1 calculator<br>
1615 to the signal output from the matrix-C multiplier 1613, and outputs the<br>
addition result to the matrix-B multiplier 1619 and the switch 1627. Herein, the<br>
adder 1617 performs the XOR operation on a bit-by-bit basis. For example, if a<br>
length-3 vector of x = (xl5 x2, x3) and a length-3 vector of y = (yi, y2, y3) are input<br>
to the adder 1617, the adder 1617 outputs a length-3 vector of z = (xi©y1? x2©y2,<br>
x3©y3) by XORing the length-3 vector of x = (xi, x2, x3) and the length-3 vector<br>
of y = (yi, y2, y3). Herein, the © operation represents the XOR operation, a result<br>
of which becomes 0 for an operation between bits having the same value, and 1<br>
for an operation between bits having different values. The signal output from the<br>
adder 1617 becomes a first parity vector P,.<br>
The matrix-B multiplier 1619 multiplies the signal output from the adder<br>
1617, i.e. the first parity vector Pj, by a partial matrix B of the full parity check<br>
matrix, and outputs the multiplication result to the adder 1621. The adder 1621<br>
adds the signal output from the matrix-B multiplier 1619 to the signal output from<br>
the matrix-A multiplier 1611, and outputs the addition result to the matrix-T'1<br>
multiplier 1623. The adder 1621, like the adder 1617, performs the XOR<br>
operation on the signal output from the matrix-B multiplier 1619 and the signal<br>
output from the matrix-A multiplier 1611, and outputs the XOR operation result<br>
to the matrix-T"1 multiplier 1623.<br>
The matrix-T"1 multiplier 1623 multiplies the signal output from the adder<br>
1621 by an inverse matrix T"1 of a partial matrix T of the full parity check matrix,<br>
and outputs the multiplication result to the switch 1629. The output of the matrix-<br>
T"1 multiplier 1623 becomes a second parity vector P2. Each of the switches<br>
1625, 1627 and 1629? is switched on only at its-transmission time to transmit its<br>
associated signal. The switch 1625 is switched on at a transmission time of the<br>
information word vector, '§',,, the switch 1627 is switched on at a transmission ;<br>
time of the first parity vecter P,,i aad the switch 1629 is switched on-at a* ■ *<br>
transmission time of the second parity vector P2.<br><br>
Because the embodiments of the present invention should be able to<br>
generate a variable-length block LDPC code, each of the matrixes used in the<br>
coding apparatus of FIG. 16 for a variable-length block LDPC code is changed<br>
each time a parity check matrix of the variable-length block LDPC code is<br>
changed, as will be described with reference to FIG. 17. Therefore, although not<br>
separately illustrated in FIG. 16, the controller modifies the matrixes used in the<br>
coding apparatus for the variable-length block LDPC code according as the parity<br>
check matrix of the variable-length block LDPC code changes.<br>
A description has been made of a method for generating a variable-length<br>
block LDPC code taking efficient coding into consideration. As described above,<br>
the variable-length block LDPC code, because of its structural characteristic, is<br>
superior in terms of the efficiency of a memory for storing the parity check<br>
matrix-related information, and enables the efficient coding by properly selecting<br>
partial matrixes from the parity check matrix. However, as the parity check matrix<br>
is generated on a per-block basis, randomness decreases, and the decrease in<br>
randomness may cause performance degradation of the block LDPC code. That is,<br>
because an irregular block LDPC code is superior in performance to a regular<br>
block LDPC code as described above, it is very important to properly select<br>
partial matrixes from the full parity check matrix in a process of designing a<br>
block LDPC code.<br>
With reference to FIG. 11, a description will now be made of a detailed<br>
method for generating a variable-length block LDPC code for a coding rate of 1/2.<br>
FIG. 11 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix of a variable-length<br>
block LDPC code according to a first embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Before a description of FIG. 11 is given, it should be noted that the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention proposes a parity check matrix of a variable-<br>
length block LDPC code for a coding rate of 1/2. Referring to FIG. 11, if it is<br>
assumed that a possible size Ns of partial matrixes is 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,<br>
36 and 40; it ispossible to generate a block LDPC code having'»a length of 96,<br>
192, 288^*3'Mr480,^576; 672, 768, 864 and 960 using the1 parity ehetk matrix<br>
illustrated in FIG. 11. A value written in each of partial blocks, i.e. partial matrixes,<br>
illustrated in FIG. 11 represents an exponent value of a corresponding permutation<br><br>
matrix. Herein, the parity check matrix of the variable-length block LDPC code is<br>
comprised of a plurality of partial blocks, arid partial matrixes individually<br>
corresponding to the partial blocks constitute the permutation matrix. For<br>
example, if the parity check matrix of the variable-length block LDPC code is<br>
comprised of pxq partial blocks, i.e. if the number of rows of partial blocks in the<br>
parity check matrix for the variable-length block LDPC code is 'p' and the<br>
number of columns of partial blocks in the parity check matrix for the variable-<br>
length block LDPC code is 'q', permutation matrixes constituting the parity check<br>
matrix of the variable-length block LDPC code can be expressed as Papq, and a<br>
superscript apq of a permutation matrix P is either 0<apq or apq="oo." that is></apq>
the permutation matrix Papq represents a permutation matrix located in a partial<br>
block where a p* row and a q* column of the parity check matrix of the variable-<br>
length block LDPC code comprised of a plurality of partial blocks cross each<br>
other. Therefore, an exponent value of a permutation matrix illustrated in FIG. 11<br>
is given as apq, and by performing a modulo-Ns operation (where Ns corresponds<br>
to a size of the partial matrix) on the exponent value of the permutation matrix, it<br>
is possible to calculate a permutation matrix's exponent value of the parity check<br>
matrix for the variable-length block LDPC code having the Ns value. If a result<br>
value obtained by performing a modulo-Ns operation on an exponent of a<br>
permutation matrix is 0, the corresponding permutation matrix becomes an<br>
identity matrix.<br>
For a detailed description of the present invention, a definition of the<br>
following parameters will be given.<br>
A parity check matrix of a variable-length block LDPC code illustrated in<br>
FIG. 11 is referred to as a "mother matrix," the number of non-zero permutation<br>
matrixes among the partial matrixes, i.e. the permutation matrixes, constituting<br>
the mother matrix is defined as L, the exponents of the L non-zero permutation<br>
matrixes among the permutation matrixes constituting the mother matrix are<br>
represented by ai, a2, •••, &amp;i, and a size of the' permutation matrixes constituting<br>
the' mother matrix is assumed to be Ns. Because' the number of non-zero<br>
• ^elrhutation matrixes among the permUtatiOWmStrMs '"constituting the mother<br>
matrix is L, an exponent of a first permutation matrix becomes a1? an exponent of<br>
a second permutation matrix becomes a2, and in this manner, an exponent of the<br><br>
last permutation matrix becomes aL.<br>
Unlike the mother matrix, a parity check matrix to be newly generated is<br>
referred to as a "child matrix," the number of non-zero permutation matrixes<br>
among the partial matrixes, i.e. the permutation matrixes, constituting the child<br>
matrix is defined as L, a size of the permutation matrixes constituting the child<br>
matrix is defined as Ns', and the exponents of the permutation matrixes<br>
constituting the child matrix are represented by af, a.2\ •", ai/- Because the<br>
number of non-zero permutation matrixes among the permutation matrixes<br>
constituting the child matrix is L, an exponent of a first permutation matrix<br>
becomes ai', an exponent of a second permutation matrix becomes a2', and in this<br>
manner, an exponent of the last permutation matrix becomes aL'.<br>
Using Equation (5) below, it is possible to generate a child matrix having<br>
a variable block length by selecting a size Ns' of the permutation matrixes<br>
constituting a child matrix to be generated from one mother matrix.<br><br>

assumed that a possible size Ns of partial matrixes is 8 and 16, it is possible to<br>
generate a block LDPC code having a length of 288 and 576 using the parity<br>
check matrix illustrated in FIG. 12. A value written in each of the partial blocks,<br>
i.e. the partial matrixes, illustrated in FIG 12 represents an exponent value of a<br>
corresponding permutation -'matrix. -Therefore, by performing a modulo-Ns<br>
operation (where Ns corresponds* tdia size of the partial matrix) on the exponent w ^<br>
value of the permutation matrix, it is possible to calculate a permutation matrix's<br>
exponent value of the parity check matrix for the block LDPC code having the Ns<br><br>

assumed that a possible size Ns of partial matrixes is 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18, it is<br>
possible to generate a block LDPC code having a variable length of 96, 192, 288,<br>
384, 480 and 576 using the parity check matrix illustrated in FIG. 13. A value<br>
written in each of the partial blocks, i.e. the partial matrixes, illustrated in FIG. 13<br>
represents an exponent value of a corresponding permutation matrix. Therefore,<br>
by performing a modulo-Ns operation (where Ns corresponds to a size of the<br>
partial matrix) on the exponent value of the permutation matrix, it is possible to<br>
calculate a permutation matrix's exponent value of the parity check matrix for the<br>
block LDPC code having the Ns value. If a result value obtained by performing a<br>
modulo-Ns operation on an exponent of a permutation matrix is 0, the<br>
corresponding permutation matrix becomes an identity matrix.<br>

check matrix illustrated in FIG. 14. A value written in each of the partial blocks,<br><br>
i.e. the partial matrixes, illustrated in FIG. 14 represents an exponent value of a<br>
corresponding permutation matrix. Therefore, by performing a modulo-Ns<br>
operation (where Ns corresponds to a size of the partial matrix) on the exponent<br>
value of the permutation matrix, it is possible to calculate a permutation matrix's<br>
exponent value of the parity check matrix for the block LDPC code having the Ns<br>

corresponding permutation matrix becomes an identity matrix.<br>

method for generating a variable-length block LDPC code for a coding rate of 1/2.<br>
FIG. 26 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix of a variable-length<br>
block LDPC code according to a thirteenth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Before a description of FIG. 26 is given, it should be noted that the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention proposes a parity check matrix of a variable-<br>
length block LDPC code for a coding rate of 1/2. Referring to FIG. 26, it is<br>
possible to generate a block LDPC code of length of 24NS according to a size of<br>
Ns of a partial matrix, using the parity check matrix illustrated in FIG. 26. A value<br>
written in each^of the partial blocks, i.e. the partial matrixes, illustrated in FIG. 26<br>
represents an exponent vaiutr of a corresponding permutation matrix. Therefore,<br>
by performing a modulo-Ns operation (where Ns corresponds to a size of the<br>
partial matrix) on the exponent value of the permutation matrix, it is possible to<br><br>
calculate a permutation matrix exponent value of the parity check matrix for the<br>
block LDPC code having the Ns value. If a result value obtained by performing a<br>
modulo-Ns operation on an exponent of a permutation matrix is 0, the<br>
corresponding permutation matrix becomes an identity matrix.<br>
Next, with reference to FIG. 27, a description will be made of a detailed<br>

FIG. 27 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix of a variable-length<br>

Before a description of FIG. 27 is given, it should be noted that the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention proposes a parity check matrix of a variable-<br>
length block LDPC code for a coding rate of 1/2. Referring to FIG. 27, it is<br>
possible to generate a block LDPC code of length of 24NS according to a size of<br>

Next, with reference to FIG. 28, a description will be made of a detailed<br>
method for generating a variable-length block LDPC code for a coding rate of 2/3.<br>
FIG. 28 is a diagram illustrating a parity check matrix of a variable-length<br>
block LDPC code according to a fifteenth embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Before a description of FIG. 28 is given, it should be noted that the fifth<br>
embodiment of the present invention proposes a parity check matrix of a variable-<br>
ntengthiitolock LDPC code for a coding rate of"2/9.* Referring to FIG. 28, it is<br>
^possible to -geherate a block LDPC code of length'of 24Nj according to a size of<br>
Ns of a partial matrix, using the parity check matrix illustrated in FIG. 28. A value<br>
written in each of the partial blocks, i.e. the partial matrixes, illustrated in FIG. 28<br><br>
represents an exponent value of a corresponding permutation matrix. Therefore,<br>
by performing a modulo-Ns operation (where Ns corresponds to a size of the<br>
partial matrix) on the exponent value of the permutation matrix, it is possible to<br>
calculate a permutation matrix exponent value of the parity check matrix for the<br>
block LDPC code having the Ns value. If a result value obtained by performing a<br>
modulo-Ns operation on an exponent of a permutation matrix is 0, the<br>
corresponding permutation matrix becomes an identity matrix.<br>
All of the LDPC-family codes can be decoded in a factor graph using a<br>
sub-product algorithm. A decoding scheme of the LDPC code can be roughly<br>
divided into a bidirectional transfer scheme and a flow transfer scheme. When a<br>
decoding operation is performed using the bidirectional transfer scheme, each<br>
check node has a node processor, increasing decoding complexity in proportion to<br>
the number of the check nodes. However, because all of the check nodes are<br>
simultaneously updated, the decoding speed increases remarkably.<br>
Unlike this, the flow transfer scheme has a single node processor, and the<br>
node processor updates information, passing through all of the nodes in a factor<br>
graph. Therefore, the flow transfer scheme is lower in decoding complexity, but<br>
an increase in size of the parity check matrix, i.e. an increase in number of nodes,<br>
causes a decrease in the decoding speed. However, if a parity check matrix is<br>
generated per block like the variable-length block LDPC code having various<br>
block lengths according to coding rates, proposed in the present invention, then a<br>
number of node processors equal to the number of blocks constituting the parity<br>
check matrix are used. In this case, it is possible to implement a decoder which is<br>
lower than the bidirectional transfer scheme in the decoding complexity and<br>
higher than the flow transfer scheme in the decoding speed.<br>
Next, with reference to FIG. 17, a description will be made of an internal<br>
structure of a decoding apparatus for decoding a.variable-length block LDPC<br>
code using a parity check matrix according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention.	- . * * ■»■'-• ■ ?<br>
FIG. 17 is a block diagram illustrating an internal structure of an<br>
apparatus for decoding a block LDPC code according to embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 17, the decoding apparatus for decoding a<br>
variable-length block LDPC code includes a block controller 1710, a variable<br>
node part 1700, an adder 1715, a deinterleaver 1717, an interleaver 1719, a<br>
controller 1721, a memory 1723, an adder 1725, a check node part 1750, and a<br>
hard decider 1729. The variable node part 1700 includes a variable node decoder<br>
1711 and switches 1713 and 1714, and the check node part 1750 includes a check<br>
node decoder 1727.<br>
A signal received over a radio channel is input to the block controller<br>
1710.	The block controller 1710 determines a block size of the received signal. If<br>
there is an information word part punctured in a coding apparatus corresponding<br>
to the decoding apparatus, the block controller 1710 inserts '0' into the punctured<br>
information word part to adjust the full block size, and outputs the resultant signal<br>
to the variable node decoder 1711.<br>
The variable node decoder 1711 calculates probability values of the<br>
signal output from the block controller 1710, updates the calculated probability<br>
values, and outputs the updated probability values to the switches 1713 and 1714.<br>
The variable node decoder 1711 connects the variable nodes according to a parity<br>
check matrix previously set in the decoding apparatus for an irregular block<br>
LDPC code, and performs an update operation on as many input values and<br>
output values as the number of Is connected to the variable nodes. The number of<br>
Is connected to the variable nodes is equal to a weight of each of the columns<br>
constituting the parity check matrix. An internal operation of the variable node<br>
decoder 1711 differs according to a weight of each of the columns constituting the<br>
parity check matrix. Except when the switch 1713 is switched on, the switch 1714<br>
is switched on to output the output signal of the variable node decoder 1711 to the<br>
adder 1715.<br>
The adder 1715 receives a signal output from the variable node decoder<br>
1711 and an output signal of the interleaver 1719 in a previous iterative decoding<br>
process, subtracts the output signal of the interleaver 1719 in the previous<br>
iterative decoding process from the output signal of the variable node decoder<br>
1711,	and outputs the subtraction result to the deinterleaver 1717. If the decoding<br>
process is an initial decoding process, it should be regarded that the output signal<br><br>
of the interleaver 1719 is 0.<br>
The deinterleaver 1717 deinterleaves the signal output from the adder<br>
1715 according to a predetermined interleaving scheme, and outputs the<br>
deinterleaved signal to the adder 1725 and the check node decoder 1727. The<br>
deinterleaver 1717 has an internal structure corresponding to the parity check<br>
matrix because an output value for an input value of the interleaver 1719<br>
corresponding to the deinterleaver 1717 is different according to a position of<br>
elements having a value of 1 in the parity check matrix.<br>
The adder 1725 receives an output signal of the check node decoder 1727<br>
in a previous iterative decoding process and an output signal of the deinterleaver<br>
1717, subtracts the output signal of the deinterleaver 1717 from the output signal<br>
of the check node decoder 1727 in the previous iterative decoding process, and<br>
outputs the subtraction result to the interleaver 1719. The check node decoder<br>
1727 connects the check nodes according to a parity check matrix previously set<br>
in the decoding apparatus for the block LDPC code, and performs an update<br>
operation on a number of input values and output values equal to the number of<br>
Is connected to the check nodes. The number of Is connected to the check nodes<br>
is equal to a weight of each of rows constituting the parity check matrix.<br>
Therefore, an internal operation of the check node decoder 1727 is different<br>
according to a weight of each of the rows constituting the parity check matrix.<br>
The interleaver 1719, under the control of the controller 1721, interleaves<br>
the signal output from the adder 1725 according to a predetermined interleaving<br>
scheme, and outputs the interleaved signal to the adder 1715 and the variable<br>
node decoder 1711. The controller 1721 reads the interleaving scheme-related<br>
information previously stored in the memory 1723, and controls an interleaving<br>
scheme of the interleaver 1719 and a deinterleaving scheme of the deinterleaver<br>
1717 according to the read interleaving scheme information. Because the memory<br>
1723 stores only a mother matrix with which the variable-length block LDPC<br>
code can be generated, the controller 1721 reads thea mother matrix stored in the<br>
 memory 1723 and generates the exponentsof the petmutation matrixes<br>
constituting a corresponding child matrix using a size Ns' of a permutation matrix<br>
corresponding to a predetermined block size. In addition, the controller 1721<br><br>
controls an interleaving scheme of the interleaver 1719 and a deinterleaving<br>
scheme of the deinterleaver 1717 using the generated child matrix. Likewise, if<br>
the decoding process is an initial decoding process, it should be regarded that the<br>
output signal of the deinterleaver 1717 is 0.<br>
By iteratively performing the foregoing processes, the decoding apparatus<br>
performs error-free reliable decoding. After the iterative decoding is performed a<br>
predetermined number of times, the switch 1714 switches off a connection<br>
between the variable node decoder 1711 and the adder 1715, and the switches<br>
1713 switches on a connection between the variable node decoder 1711 and the<br>
hard decider 1729 to provide the signal output from the variable node decoder<br>
1711 to the hard decider 1729. The hard decider 1729 performs a hard decision on<br>
the signal output from the variable node decoder 1711, and outputs the hard<br>
decision result, and the output value of the hard decider 1729 becomes a finally<br>
decoded value.<br>
As can be appreciated from the foregoing description, the present<br>
invention proposes a variable-length block LDPC code of which a minimum<br>
cycle length is maximized in a mobile communication system, thereby<br>
maximizing an error correction capability and thus improving the system<br>
performance. In addition, the present invention generates an efficient parity check<br>
matrix, thereby minimizing decoding complexity of a variable-length block<br>
LDPC code. Moreover, the present invention designs a variable-length block<br>
LDPC code such that decoding complexity thereof should be in proportion to a<br>
block length thereof, thereby enabling efficient coding. In particular, the present<br>
invention generates a block LDPC code which is applicable to various coding<br>
rates and has various block lengths, thereby contributing to the minimization of<br>
hardware complexity.<br>
