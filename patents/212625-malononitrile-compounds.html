Test Example 6   Pesticidal Test against Musca domestica<br>
Each formulation of the compound 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 39, 42, 44, 45, 46, 49, 50, 53, 54, 57, 59, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 88 and 89 obtained according to<br><br>
Formulation Example 5 was diluted with water so that the active ingredient concentration came to 500 ppm to prepare a test liquid for each compound.<br>
On the bottom of a polyethylene cup of 5.5 cm in diameter was placed a filter paper on the same size, to which the test liquid had been prepared as described above, was added dropwise in an amount of 0.7 ml, and 30 mg of sucrose as a bait was placed on it.    Ten female adults of Musca domestica<br>
(house fly) were set free in the polyethylene cup, which was then kept<br>
»<br>
covered.    After 24 hours, their survival was examined to determine the mortality.<br>
As a result, in the treatment with each of the compounds described above, it was exhibited the mortality of 100%.<br>
Test Example 7   Pesticidal Test against Blattalla germanica<br>
Each formulation of the compound 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 26, 31, 34, 36, 39, 42, 44, 49, 50, 54, 57, 62, 64, 70, 72, 73, 74, 77 and 80 obtained according to Formulation Example 5 was diluted with water so that the active ingredient concentration came to 500 ppm to prepare a test liquid for each compound.<br>
On the bottom of a polyethylene cup of 5.5 cm in diameter was placed a filter paper on the same size, to which the test liquid had been prepared as described above, was added dropwise in an amount of 0.7 ml, and 30 mg of sucrose as a bait was placed on it. Two male adults of Blattalla germanica (German cockroach) were set free in the polyethylene cup, which was then kept covered. After 6 days, their survival was examined to determine the mortality.<br>
As a result, in the treatment with each of the compounds described above, it was exhibited the mortality of 100%.<br>
Test Example 8   Pesticidal Test against Cullex pipiens pallens<br>
Each formulation of the compound 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13,<br><br>
14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 42, 43, 44, 46, 49, 50, 54, 55, 56, 57, 59, 62, 64, 66, 68, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88 and 89 obtained according to Formulation Example 5 was diluted with water so that the active ingredient concentration came to 500 ppm to prepare a test liquid for each compound.<br>
In 100 ml of ion-exchanged water, the test liquid had been prepared as described above, was added dropwise in an amount of 0.7 ml. The concentration of active ingredient was 3.5 ppm. Twenty final-instar larvae of Cullex pipiens pallens (common mosquito) were set free in the solution. After 1 days, their survival was examined to determine the mortality.<br>
As a result, in the treatment with each of the compounds described above, it was exhibited the mortality of more than 90%<br>
Test example 9    Pesticidal Test against Ctenocephalides felis<br>
Each of the compound 8, 15, 19, 21 and 34 was dissolved in acetone to give a 0.2ml solution of 0.114% w/w, which was uniformly treated on a filter paper having 3.8cm in diameter, and air-dried. The amount of active ingredient was 200 mg/m2. The filter paper was filled in a lid of a 200ml glass bottle. Twenty adult Ctenocephalides felis (cat flea) were released in the glass bottle, which was followed by covering with the hd. The glass bottle was upset for making the fleas contact with the filter paper. After 24 hours, the mortality was examined.<br>
