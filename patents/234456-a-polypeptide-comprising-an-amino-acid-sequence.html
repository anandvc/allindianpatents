				<td>POLYMER CONJUGATES OF NEUBLASTIN AND<br>
METHODS OF USING SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to polypeptides and more particularly to modified<br>
neurotrophic polypeptides and methods of using these modified polypeptides.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Neurotrophic factors are naturally-occurring proteins that promote survival, maintain<br>
phenotypic differentiation, prevent degeneration, and enhance the activity of neuronal cells<br>
and tissues. Neurotrophic factors are isolated from neural tissue and from non-neural tissue<br>
that is innervated by the nervous system, and have been classified into functionally and<br>
structurally related groups, also referred to as families, superfamilies, or subfamilies. Among<br>
the neurotrophic factor superfamilies are the fibroblast growth factor, neurotrophin, and<br>
transforming growth factor-^ (TGF-(3) superfamilies. Individual species of neurotrophic<br>
factors are distinguished by their physical structure, their interaction with their cognate<br>
receptors, and their affects on various types of nerve cells. Classified within the TGF-(3<br>
superfamily are the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligands, which include<br>
GDNF, persephin (PSP) and neurturin (NTN).<br>
The ligands of the GDNF subfamily have in common their ability to induce signaling<br>
through the RET receptor tyrosine kinase. These three ligands of the GDNF subfamily differ<br>
in their relative affinities for a family of neurotrophic receptors, the GFRa receptors.<br>
A recently described neurotrophic factor is "neublastin," or "NBN." Neublastin is<br>
classified within the GDNF subfamily because it shares regions of homology with other<br>
GDNF ligands and because of its ability to bind to, and activate, RET. Unlike other GDNF<br>
ligands, neublastin is highly selective for the GFRoc3-RET receptor complex. In addition,<br>
NBN contains unique subregions in "its arnino acid sequence.<br>
Unfortunately, neublastin is cleared rapidly by the body. This rapid clearance can<br>
frustrate the use of neublastin in therapeutic applications. Thus, a need exists to identify<br>
neublastin variants that have increased bioavailability.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is based in part on the discover)' of novel forms of neublastin<br>
that show enhanced pharmokinetic and bioavailability properties in vivo. These novel forms<br>
include variant neublastin polypeptides conjugated to polymeric molecules.<br>
In one aspect, the invention features a variant neublastin polypeptide, or mutein<br>
neublastin polypeptide, that includes an amino acid sequence having one or more amino acid<br>
substitutions at solvent-exposed positions of the mature neublastin dimer. The present<br>
substitutions introduce into the native neublastin polypeptide one or more sites at which<br>
substances, such as naturally occurring or synthetic polymers, can be attached to the<br>
polypeptide so as to enhance its solubility, and hence its" bioavailability, in vivo. Preferably,<br>
the present variant polypeptides include an amino acids sequence at least 70% identical to<br>
amino acids 8-113 of SEQ ED NO:1. The variant neublastin polypeptide includes one or<br>
more amino acid substitutions in which an amino acid other than arginine occurs at position<br>
14 in the amino acid sequence of the variant polypeptide, an amino acid other than arginine at<br>
position 39 occurs in the amino acid sequence of the variant polypeptide, an amino acid other<br>
than arginine at position 68 occurs in the variant polypeptide; or an amino acid other than<br>
asparagine at position 95 occurs in the variant polypeptide, when the positions of the amino<br>
acids are numbered in accordance with the polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1.<br>
As used herein, "wild-type neublastin" or "wt-NBN" refers to a naturally-occurring or<br>
native neublastin polypeptide sequence, such as that of rat, mouse, or human neublastin (see,<br>
e.g., SEQ ID NO: 2, 3, or 4). Specific variant neublastin polypeptides are referred to herein<br>
as "NBN-XiNiXa" or "XiNiXo-NBN" wherein X] refers to an amino acid of a wild-type<br>
neublastin polypeptide, NI refers to the numerical position of the Xj amino acids in the<br>
sequence, as numbered according to SEQ ID NO: 1. X.2 refers to an amino acid substituted<br>
for the wild-type amino acid at the indicated numerical position in the sequence. Thus, for<br>
example, NBN-N95K identifies the variant neublastin polypeptides in which the asparagine<br>
at position 95 is replaced by a lysine.<br>
The variant neublastin polypeptide can be provided as a multimeric polypeptide. For<br>
example, the variant neublastin polypeptide can be provided as a dimer that includes at least<br>
one variant neublastin polypeptide. In some embodiments, the dimer is a homodimer of<br>
variant neublastin polypeptides. In other embodiments, the dimer is a heterodimer that<br>
includes one variant neublastin polypeptide and one wild-type neublastin polypeptide. Other<br>
dimers may include two different variant neublastin polypeptide forms.<br>
In some embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide includes amino acids 1-7 of<br>
SEQ ID NO: 1 in addition to amino acids 8-113.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide, when dimerized, binds<br>
GFRttS. In additional preferred embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide, when<br>
dimerized, stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of a RET polypeptide, either on its own or<br>
when bound to GFRa3.<br>
In still other preferred embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide, when<br>
dimerized, enhances neuron survival, e.g., enhances survival of a sensory neuron.<br>
In still other preferred embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide, when<br>
dimerized, normalizes pathological changes of a neuron, such as a sensory neuron.<br>
In yet further preferred embodiments, the variant'neublastin polypeptide, when<br>
dimerized, enhances survival of a neuron, e.g., an autonomic neuron, or a dopaminergic<br>
neuron.<br>
In some embodiments, the variant polypeptide includes two, three, or more of the<br>
amino acid substitutions selected from the group consisting of an amino acid other than<br>
arginine at position 14 in the amino acid sequence of the variant polypeptide, an amino acid<br>
other than arginine at position 39 in the amino acid sequence of the variant polypeptide, an<br>
amino acid other than arginine at position 68 of the variant polypeptide, and an amino acid<br>
other than asparagine at position 95 of the variant polypeptide.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the amino acid at one or more of the positions, 14, 39, 68,<br>
and 95 is lysine.<br>
Preferably, amino acids 8-94 and 96-113 of the variant neublastin polypeptide are at<br>
least 90% identical to amino acids 8-94 and 96-113 of SEQ ID NO: 1. More preferably, the<br>
amino acids sequences are at least 95% identical thereto. Most preferably, the amino acid<br>
sequence of the variant neublastin polypeptide includes the amino acid sequence of a<br>
naturally occurring rat, human or mouse neublastin polypeptide at amino acids 8-94 and 96-<br>
113 of the variant neublastin polypeptide. For example, amino acids 8-94 and 96-113 of the<br>
variant neublastin polypeptide can include the amino acid sequence of amino acids 8-94 and<br>
96-113 of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO: 4.<br>
Also provided by the invention is a fusion protein or polypeptide that includes a<br>
variant neublastin polypeptide or a wild-type neublastin polypeptide, or a protein that is a<br>
dimer of two neublastin fusion proteins. Neublastin fusion proteins also have enhanced<br>
phannacokinetic and bioavailability properties in vivo.<br>
In another aspect, the invention provides a nucleic acid molecule encoding a variant<br>
neublastin polypeptide. The nucleic acid encoding the variant neublastin polypeptide is<br>
preferably provided in a vector, e.g., an expression vector. A variant neublastin nucleic acid,<br>
or a vector including the same, can be provided in a cell. The cell can be, e.g., a mammalian<br>
cell, fungal cell, yeast cell, insect cell, or bacterial cell. A preferred mammalian cell is a<br>
Chinese hamster ovary cell ("CHO cell").<br>
Also provided by the invention is a method of making a variant neublastin<br>
polypeptide, by culturing a cell containing a nucleic acid encoding a variant neublastin<br>
nucleic acid under conditions allowing for expression of a variant neublastin polypeptide. If<br>
desired, the variant neublastin polypeptide can then be recovered. The invention further<br>
includes the variant 'neublastin polypeptide produced by the cell. Similar nucleic acids,<br>
vectors, host cells, and polypeptide production methods are disclosed herein for the fusion<br>
proteins (such as the neublastin-seram albumin fusion proteins) of this invention.<br>
Also provided by the invention is a composition that includes a neublastin polypeptide<br>
or variant neublastin polypeptide coupled to a non-naturally occurring polymer. The variant<br>
neublastin polypeptide in the composition preferably includes an amino acid sequence at least<br>
70% identical to amino acids 8-113 of SEQ ID NO:1, provided that the variant neublastin<br>
polypeptide includes one or more of the amino acid substitutions selected from die group<br>
consisting of an amino acid other than arginine at position 14 in the amino acid sequence of<br>
the variant polypeptide, an amino acid other than arginine at position 39 in the amino acid<br>
sequence of the variant polypeptide, an amino acid other than arginine at position 68 of the<br>
variant polypeptide, and an amino acid other than asparagine at position 95 of the variant<br>
polypeptide, wherein the positions of the amino acids are numbered in accordance with the<br>
polypeptide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the polymer comprises a polyalkylene glycol moiety, e.g.,<br>
polyethylene glycol moiety (PEG).<br>
In preferred embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol moiety is coupled to an amine<br>
group of the neublastin polypeptide, or a lysine in a variant neublastin polypeptide.<br>
Coupling can occur via a N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) active ester. The active ester<br>
can be, e.g., PEG succinimidyl succinate (SS-PEG), succinimidyl butyrate (SPB-PEG), or<br>
succinimidyl propionate (SPA-PEG).<br>
The polyalkylene glycol moiety can be, e.g., carboxymethyl-NHS, norleucine-NHS,<br>
SC-PEG, tresylate, aldehyde, epoxide, carbonylimidazole, or PNP carbonate.<br>
In some embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol moiety is coupled to a cysteine group<br>
of the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide. For example, coupling can<br>
occur via a maleimide group, a vinylsulfone group, a haloacetate group, and a thiol group.<br>
In some embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide in<br>
the composition is glycosylated. When the neublastin polypeptide or variant polypeptide is<br>
glycosylated, the polymer can be coupled to a carbohydrate moiety of the glycosylated<br>
neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide. For example, the polymer can be<br>
coupled to the glycosylated neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide<br>
following oxidation of a hydrazole group or an amino group of the glycosylated neublastin<br>
polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide, or oxidation of a reactive group of the<br>
polymer.<br>
In various embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide<br>
comprises one, two, three, or four PEG moieties.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide, variant neublastin polypeptide<br>
or polymer conjugate has a longer serum half-life relative to the half-life of the polypeptide<br>
or variant polypeptide in the absence of the polymer.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide, variant neublastin polypeptide<br>
or polymer conjugate in the complex has a physiological activity selected from the group<br>
consisting of: GFRa3 binding, RET activation, normalization of pathological changes of a<br>
neuron, or enhancing neuron survival.<br>
By "normalization of pathological changes of a neuron" is meant that the present<br>
conjugate induces a change in one or more of the following cellular parameters: expression<br>
levei of a structural protein, a neurotrophic factor receptor, an ion channel, or a<br>
neurotransmitter, or, induces a change in cellular morphology, in each case so as to<br>
substantially restore such parameter to the level thereof in a neuron of the same or similar<br>
phenotype that is unaffected by disease, degeneration, insult, or injury. The normalization of<br>
pathological changes of a neuron can be monitored immunohistochemically, or by assessing<br>
changes in the levels of secreted or shed cellular products, or by assessing in vivo changes in<br>
behavior physiologically attributable to function of the affected neuron(s). For example, in<br>
the case of pathologic changes associated with a neuropathic pain syndrome, pain behaviors<br>
such as hyperalgesia, hypoalgesia, or allodynia, can be monitored.<br>
By "enhancing neuron survival" is meant extending the survival of an affected neuron<br>
beyond the survival period observed in a corresponding neuron affected by the same type of<br>
disease, disorder, insult, or injury but not treated with the neublastin conjugate or fusion<br>
protein of this invention.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymer is coupled to the polypeptide at a site on the<br>
neublastin that is an N terminus. In some embodiments, the polymer is coupled to the<br>
polypeptide at a site in a non-terminal amino acid of the neublastin polypeptide or variant<br>
neublastin polypeptide.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the polymer is coupled to a solvent exposed amino acid of<br>
the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide.<br>
hi preferred embodiments, the polymer is coupled to the neublastin polypeptide or<br>
variant neublastin polypeptide at a residue selected from the group consisting of the amino<br>
terminal amino acid of the varianf polypeptide, position 14 in the amino acid sequence of the<br>
neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide, position 39 in the amino acid<br>
sequence of the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide, position 68 in the<br>
amino acid sequence of the neublastin potypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide, and<br>
position 95 in the amino acid sequence of the neublastin polypeptide or variant polypeptide.<br>
Also provided by the invention is a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
physiologically acceptable vehicle containing or having dispersed therein a neublastin<br>
polypeptide, a variant neublastin polypeptide, or a conjugate of the present invention.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention includes a stable, aqueously soluble conjugated<br>
neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide complex comprising a neublastin<br>
polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide coupled to a polyethylene glycol moiety,<br>
wherein the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide is coupled to the<br>
polyethylene glycol moiety by a labile bond. In some embodiments, the labile bond is<br>
cleavable by biochemical hydrolysis, proteolysis, or sulfhydryl cleavage. In preferred<br>
embodiments, the labile bond is cleavable under in vivo conditions.<br>
Also provided by the invention is a method for making a modified neublastin<br>
polypeptide that has prolonged activity, in vitro or in vivo, relative to a wild-type neublastin<br>
by providing a neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide, and coupling the<br>
polypeptide or modified variant neublastin polypeptide to a non-naturally occurring polymer<br>

or a complex that includes a stable, aqueously soluble conjugated neublastin polypeptide or<br>
variant neublastin polypeptide complex comprising a neublastin polypeptide or variant<br>
neublastin polypeptide coupled to a polyethylene glycol moiety.<br>

peripheral neuropathy or a neuropathic pain syndrome. Humans are preferred subjects for<br>
treatment.<br>
Administration can be, e.g., systemic or local.<br>

detailed description and claims.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides novel variant neublastin polypeptides that can be modified to<br>
enhance their pharmokinetic and bioavailability properties. Preferred variant neublastin<br>
polypeptides have altered amino acid sequences which facilitate coupling to a polymer agent<br>
such as a polyalkylene glycol polymer.<br>
Variant Neublastin Polvpeptides<br>
The invention provides neublastin polypeptides that have variant amino acid<br>
sequences with respect to a wild-type neublastin polypeptide sequence. Amino acid<br>
sequences of human and mouse neublastin polypeptides are disclosed in WOOO/01815.<br>
Examples of variant neublastin polypeptides according to the invention are presented in Table<br>
1.<br>
Preferably, the altered residues in the variant neublastin polypeptide are chosen to<br>
facilitate coupling of a polymer such as a polyalkylene glycol polymer at the location of the<br>
modified amino acid. Preferred sites of modification of a neublastin polypeptide are those at<br>
solvent accessible regions in the neublastin polypepdde. Such sites can be chosen based on<br>
inspection of the crystal structure of the related neurotrophic factor, GDNF, whose crystal<br>
structure is described in Nat. Struct. Biol. 4:435-38, 1997. Sites can also be chosen based on<br>
the structural-functional information provided for persephin/neublastin chimeric proteins.<br>
These chimeras are described in J. Biol. Chem. 275:3412-20,2000. An exemplary listing of<br>
solvent accessible or surface exposed neublastin amino acids identified through this<br>
methodology is as set forth in Table 2.<br>
The invention includes a variant neublastin polypeptide that includes an amino acid<br>
sequence that is at least 70% identical to amino acids 8-113 of SEQ ID NO: 1, which is shown<br>
in Table 1. In some embodiments, one or more of the arginines at position 14, position 39,<br>
position 68, or the asparagine at position 95, in the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide, is<br>
replaced by an amino acid other than arginine or asparagine. Preferably, the wild-type type<br>
amino acid is replaced with lysine or cysteine.<br>
(Table Removed) Table 2 provides a list of residues and numbers in human neublastin that are expected<br>
to be surface exposed. Surface exposed residues were determined by examining the structure<br>
of the rat GDNF dimer formed by chains A and B (PDB code 1AGQ) and determining<br>
whether a residue was on the surface of the structure. This structure was then compared to a<br>
sequence alignment of GDNF and neublastin in Baloh et al., Neuron, vol 21, pg 1291, 1998<br>
to determine the proper residues in neublastin. The numbering scheme is that shown in Table<br>
1.<br>
(Table Removed)n/a indicates that the residues are not present in the structure of GDNF. This is either because<br>
of construct design, flexible regions, or inserts in neublastin relative to GDNF (residues 68-<br>
71).<br>
indicates the residues are buried and not on the surface or are cysteine residues involved<br>
in disulfide bonds. As this protein is a cysteine knot, a great majority of the residues are<br>
on the surface.<br>
+ indicates that this residue is surface exposed in the GDNF structure, and therefore is<br>
presumed to be surface exposed in neublastin, although the loop containing residues 66-75 is<br>
visible in only one of the GDNF monomers (presumably flexible). This loop also contains a<br>
4 residue insert in neublastin relative to GDNF.<br>
As used herein, "identity" and "homologous" or "homology" are used<br>
interchangeably and refer to the sequence similarity between two polypeptides, molecules or<br>
between two nucleic acids. When a position hi both of the two compared sequences is<br>
occupied by the same base or amino acid monomer subunit (for instance, if a position in each<br>
of the two DNA molecules is occupied by adenine, or a position in each of two polypeptides<br>
is occupied by a lysine), then the respective molecules are homologous at that position. The<br>
percentage homology between two sequences is a function of the number of matching or<br>
homologous positions shared by the two sequences divided by the number of positions<br>
compared x 100. For instance, if 6 of 10 of the positions in two sequences are matched or are<br>
homologous, then the two sequences are 60% homologous. By way of example, the DNA<br>
sequences CTGACT and CAGGTT share 50% homology (3 of the 6 total positions are<br>
matched). Generally, a comparison is made when two sequences are aligned to give<br>
maximum homology. Such alignment can be provided using, for instance, the method of<br>
Needleman et al., J. Mol Biol. 48: 443-453 (1970), implemented conveniently by computer<br>
programs such as the Align program (DNAstar, Inc.). "Similar" sequences are those which,<br>
when aligned, share identical and similar amino acid residues, where similar residues are<br>
conservative substitutions for, or "allowed point mutations" of, corresponding amino acid<br>
residues in an aligned reference sequence. In this regard, a "conservative substitution" of a<br>
residue in a reference sequence is a substitution by a residue that is physically or functionally<br>
similar to the corresponding reference residue, e.g., that has a similar size, shape, electric<br>
charge, chemical properties, including the ability to form covalent or hydrogen bonds, or the<br>
like. Thus, a "conservative substitution variant" sequence is one which differs from a<br>
reference sequence or a wild-type sequence in that one or more conservative substitutions or<br>
allowed point mutations are present.<br>
In preferred embodiments, a polypeptide according to the invention is 80 %, 85%,<br>
90%, 95%, 98% or 99% identical to amino acids 8-113 of SEQ ID NO:1. In some<br>
embodiments, the amino acid sequence of the variant neublastin polypeptide includes the<br>
amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring rat, human or mouse neublastin polypeptide at<br>
amino acids 1-94 and 96-113 of the variant neublastin pdlypeptide, e.g., the polypeptide has<br>
the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOs: 2, 3, or 4 at these positions.<br>
A variant neublastin polypeptide differing in sequence from those disclosed in SEQ<br>
ID NOs: 1-4 may include one or more conservative amino acid substitutions. Alternatively,<br>
or in addition, the variant neublastin polypeptide may differ by one or more non conservative<br>
amino acid substitutions, or by deletions or insertions. Preferably, the substitutions,<br>
insertions or deletions do not abolish the isolated protein's biological activity.<br>
Conservative substitutions typically include the substitution of one amino acid for<br>
another with similar characteristics such as substitutions within the following groups: valine,<br>
alanine and glycine; leucine, valine, and isoleucine; aspartic acid and glutamie acid;<br>
asparagine and glutamine; serine, cysteine, and threonine; lysine and arginine; and<br>
phenylalanine and tyrosine. The non polar hydrophobic amino acids include alanine, leucine,<br>
isoleucine, valine, proline, phenylalanine, tryptophan and metnionine. The polar neutral<br>
amino acids include glycine, serine, threonine, cysteine, tyrosine, asparagine and glutamine.<br>
The positively charged (basic) amino acids include arginine, lysine and histidine. The<br>
negatively charged (acidic) amino acids include aspartic acid and glutamie acid. Any<br>
substitution of one member of the above-mentioned polar, basic or acidic groups by another<br>
member of the same group can be deemed a conservative substitution.<br>
Other substitutions can be readily identified by workers of ordinary skill. For<br>
example, for the amino acid alanine, a substitution can be taken from any one of D-alanine,<br>
glycine, beta-alanine, L-cysteine and D-cysteine. For lysine, a replacement can be any one of<br>
D-lysine, arginine, D-arginine, homo-arginine, methionine, D-methionine, ornithine, or Dornithine.<br>
Generally, substitutions in functionally important regions that may be expected to<br>
induce changes in the properties of isolated polypeptides are those in which: (i) a polar<br>
residue, e.g., serine or threonine, is substituted for (or by) a hydrophobic residue, e.g.,<br>
leucine, isoleucine, phenylalanine, or alanine; (ii) a cysteine residue is substituted for (or by)<br>
any other residue; (iii) a residue having an electropositive side chain, e.g., lysine, arginine or<br>
histidine, is substituted for (or by) a residue having an electronegative side chain, e.g.,<br>
glutamic acid or aspartic acid; or (iv) a residue having a bulky side chain, e.g., phenylalanine,<br>
is substituted for (or by) one not having such a side chain, e.g., glycine. The likelihood that<br>
one of the foregoing non-conservative substitutions may alter functional properties of the<br>
protein is also correlated to the position of the substitution with respect to functionally<br>
important regions of the protein: some non-conservative substitutions may accordingly have<br>
little or no effect on biological properties.<br>
Also provided by the invention are multimeric polypeptides that include a variant<br>
neublastin polypeptide. The multimeric polypeptides are preferably provided as purified<br>
multimeric polypeptides. Examples of multimeric complexes include, e.g., dimeric<br>
complexes. The multimeric complex can be provided as a heteromeric or homomeric<br>
complex. Thus, the multimeric complex can be a heterodimeric complex including one<br>
variant neublastin polypeptide and one non-variant neublastin or a heterodimeric complex<br>
including two or more variant neublastin polypeptides.<br>
In some embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide binds GFRoc3. Preferably,<br>
binding of the variant neublastin polypeptide stimulates phosphorylation of a RET<br>
polypeptide. To determine whether a polypeptide binds GFRaS, assays can be performed as<br>
- described in WOOO/01815. For example, the presence of neublastin in the media of CHO cell<br>
line supernatants can be described using a modified form of a ternary complex assay<br>
described by Sanicola et al. (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1997, 94: 6238). In this assay, the<br>
ability of GDNF-like molecules can be evaluated for their ability to mediate binding between<br>
the extracellular domain of RET and the various co-receptors, GFRal, GFRa2, and GFRa3.<br>
Soluble forms of RET and the co-receptors are generated as fusion proteins. A fusion protein<br>
between the extracellular domain of rat RET and placenta! alkaline phosphatase (RET-AP)<br>
and a fusion protein between the extracellular domain of rat GFRoc-1 (disclosed in published<br>
application WO9744356; November 27, 1997, herein incorporated by reference) and the Fc<br>
domain of human IgGl (rGFR(al-Ig) have been described (Sanicola et al., Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA 1997, 94: 6238).<br>
In some embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide enhances survival of a<br>
neuron, or normalizes pathological changes of a neuron or both. Assays for determining<br>
whether a polypeptide enhances survival of a neuron, or normalizes pathological changes of a<br>
neuron, are described in, e.g., WOOO/01815. Preferably, the neuron is a sensory neuron, an<br>
autonomic neuron, or a dopaminergic neuron.<br>
Synthesis and Isolation of Variant Neublastin Polypeptides<br>
Variant neublastin polypeptides can be isolated using methods known in the art.<br>
Naturally occurring neublastin polypeptides can be isolated from cells or tissue sources by an<br>
appropriate purification scheme using standard protein purification techniques. Alternatively,<br>
variant neublastin polypeptides can be synthesized chemically using standard peptide<br>
synthesis techniques. The synthesis of short amino acid sequences is well established in the<br>
peptide art. See, e.g., Stewart, et al.. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis (2d ed., 1984).<br>
In another embodiment, variant neublastin polypeptides are produced by recombinant<br>
DNA techniques. For example, a nucleic acid molecule encoding a variant neublastin<br>
polypeptide can be inserted into a vector, e.g., an expression vector, and the nucleic acid can<br>
be introduced into a cell. Suitable cells include, e.g., mammalian cells (such as human cells<br>
or Chinese hamster ovary cells), fungal cells, yeast cells, insect cells, and bacterial cells.<br>
When expressed in a recombinant cell, the cell is preferably cultured under conditions<br>
allowing for expression of a variant neublastin polypeptide. The variant neublastin<br>
polypeptide can be recovered from a cell suspension if desired. By "recovered" is meant that<br>
the variant polypeptide is removed from those components of a cell or culture medium in<br>
which it is present prior to the recovery process. The recovery process may include one or<br>
more refolding or purification steps.<br>
Variant neublastin polypeptides can be constructed using any of several methods<br>
known in the art. One such method is site-directed mutagenesis, in which a specific<br>
nucleotide (or, if desired a small number of specific nucleotides) is changed in order to<br>
change a single amino acid (or, if desired, a small number of predetermined amino acid<br>
residues) in the encoded neublastin polypeptide. Those skilled in the art recognize that sitedirected<br>
mutagenesis is a routine and widely-used technique. In fact, many site-directed<br>
mutagenesis kits are commercially available. One such kit is the "Transformer Site Directed<br>
Mutagenesis Bat" sold by Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, Calif.).<br>
Practice of the present invention will employ, unless indicated otherwise,<br>
conventional techniques of cell biology, cell culture, molecular biology, microbiology,<br>
recombinant DNA, protein chemistry, and immunology, which are within the skill of the art.<br>
Such techniques are described in the literature. See, for example, Molecular Cloning: A<br>

Variant neublastin fusion proteins<br>
If desired, the variant neublastin polypeptide can be provided as a fusion protein.<br>
Fusion polypeptide derivatives of proteins of the invention also include various structural<br>
forms of the primary protein which retain biological activity. As used herein "fusion" refers<br>
to a co-linear, covalent linkage of two or more proteins or fragments thereof via their<br>
individual peptide backbones, most preferably through genetic expression of a<br>
polynucleotide molecule encoding those proteins in the same reading frame (i.e., "in frame").<br>
It is preferred that the proteins or fragments thereof are from different sources. Thus,<br>
preferred fusion proteins include a variant neublastin protein or fragment covalently linked to<br>
a second moiety that is not a variant neublastin. Preferably, the second moiety is derived<br>
from a polypeptide that exists as a monomer, and is sufficient to confer enhanced solubility<br>
and/or bioavailability properties on the neublastin polypeptide.<br>
For example, a "variant neublastin/human serum albumin fusion" is a protein<br>
comprising a variant neublastin polypeptide of the invention, or fragment thereof, whose Nterminus<br>
or C-terminus is linked in frame to a human serum albumin polypeptide (See Syed<br>
et al, Blood, 1997, 89: 3243 and Yeh et al., P.N.A.S. USA 1992, 89:1904) and US Patent<br>
Nos. 5,876,969 and 5,302,697. The term "fusion protein" additionally includes &amp; variant<br>
neublastin chemically linked via a mono- or hetero- functional molecule to a second moiety<br>
that is not a variant neublastin protein and is made de novo from purified protein as described<br>
below.<br>
Neublas tin-serum albumin fusions can be constructed using methods known in the art.<br>
Any of a number of cross-linkers that contain a corresponding amino reactive group and thiol<br>
reactive group can be used to link neublastin to serum albumin. Examples of suitable linkers<br>
include amine reactive cross-linkers that insert a thiol reactive-maleimide. These include,<br>
e.g., SMCC, AMAS, BMPS, MBS, EMCS, SMPB, SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS. Other<br>
suitable linkers insert a thiol reactive-haloacetate group. These include, e.g., SBAP, SIA,<br>
SLAB and that provide a protected or non protected thiol" for reaction with sulfhydryl groups<br>
to product a reducible linkage are SPDP, SMPT, SATA-, or SATP all of which are<br>
commercially available (e.g., Pierce Chemicals). One skilled in the art can similarly<br>
envision with alternative strategies that will link the N-terminus of neublastin with serum<br>
albumin.<br>
It is also envisioned that one skilled in the art can generate conjugates to serum<br>
albumin that are not targeted at the N-terminus of NBN or at the thiol moiety on serum<br>
albumin. If desired, NBN-serum albumin fusions can be generated using genetic engineering<br>
techniques, wherein NBN is fused to the serum albumin gene at its N-terminus, C-terrninus,<br>
or at both ends.<br>
It is further contemplated that any NBN conjugate that results in a product with a '<br>
prolonged half life in animals (including humans) can be generated using a similar strategy.<br>
Other derivatives of variant neublastins include covalent or aggregate conjugates of<br>
variant neublastin or its fragments with other proteins or polypeptides, such as by synthesis in<br>
recombinant culture as additional N-termini, or C-tennini. For example, the conjugated<br>
peptide may be a signal (or leader) polypeptide sequence at the N-terminal region of the<br>
protein which co-translationally or post-translationally directs transfer of the protein from its<br>
site of synthesis to its site of function inside or outside of the cell membrane or wall (e.g., the<br>
yeast alpha -factor leader). Neublastin receptor proteins can comprise peptides added to<br>
facilitate purification or identification of neublastin (e.g., histidine/neublastin fusions). The<br>
amino acid sequence of neublastin can also be linked to the peptide Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-<br>
Asp-Asp-Lys (DYKDDDDK) (Hopp et al.. Biotechnology 6:1204,1988.) The latter sequence<br>
is highly antigenic and provides an epitope reversibly bound by a specific monoclonal<br>
antibody, enabling rapid assay and facile purification of expressed recombinant protein.<br>
This sequence is also specifically cleaved by bovine mucosal enterokinase at the<br>
residue immediately following the Asp-Lys pairing.<br>
Variant neublastin polypeptides conjugated to a polymer<br>
If desired, a single polymer molecule may be employed for conjugation with a<br>
neublastin polypeptide, although it is also contemplated that more than one polymer molecule<br>
can be attached as well. Conjugated neublastin compositions of the invention may find utility<br>
in both in vivo as well as non-in vivo applications. Additionally, it will be recognized that the<br>
conjugating polymer may utilize any other groups, moieties, or other conjugated species, as<br>
appropriate to the end use application. By way of example, it may be useful in some<br>
applications to covalently bond to the polymer a functional moiety imparting UV-degradation<br>
resistance, or antioxidation, or other properties or characteristics to the polymer. As a further<br>
example, it may be advantageous in some applications to functionalize the polymer to render<br>
it reactive or cross-linkable in character, to enhance various properties or characteristics of<br>
the overall conjugated material. Accordingly, the polymer may contain any functionality,<br>
repeating groups, linkages, or other constituent structures which do not preclude the efficacy<br>
of the conjugated neublastin mutein composition for its intended purpose.<br>
Illustrative polymers that may usefully be employed to achieve these desirable<br>
characteristics are described herein below in exemplary reaction schemes. In covalently<br>
bonded peptide applications, the polymer may be functionalized and then coupled to free<br>
amino acid(s) of the peptide(s) to form labile bonds.<br>
In some embodiments, the neublastin polypeptide is linked to the polymer via a<br>
terminal reactive group on the polypeptide. Alternatively, or in addition, the neublastin<br>
polypeptide may be linked via the side chain amino group of an internal lysine residue, e.g., a<br>
lysine residue introduced into the amino acid sequence of a naturally occurring neublastin<br>
polypeptide. Thus, conjugations can also be branched from the non terminal reactive groups.<br>
The polymer with the reactive group(s) is designated herein as "activated polymer". The<br>
reactive group selectively reacts with free amino or other reactive groups on the protein.<br>
Attachment may occur in the activated polymer at any available neublastin amino<br>
group such as the alpha amino groups or the epsilon amino groups of a lysine residue or<br>
residues introduced into the amino acid sequence of a neublastin polypeptide or variant<br>
thereof. Free carboxylic groups, suitably activated carbonyl groups, hydroxyl, guanidyl,<br>
imidazole, oxidized carbohydrate moieties and mercapto groups of the neublastin (if<br>
available) can also be used as attachment sites.<br>
Generally from about 1.0 to about 10 moles of activated polymer per mole of protein,<br>
depending on protein concentration, is employed. The final amount is a balance between<br>
maximizing the extent of the reaction while minimizing non-specific modifications of the<br>
product and, at the same time, defining chemistries that will maintain optimum activity, while<br>
at the same time optimizing, if possible, the half-life of the protein. Preferably, at least about<br>
50% of the biological activity of the protein is retained, and most preferably near 100% is<br>
retained.<br>
The reactions may take place by any suitable method used for reacting biologically<br>
active materials with inert polymers, preferably at about pH 5-8, e.g., pH 5, 6, 7, or 8, if the<br>
reactive groups are on the alpha amino group at the N-terminus. Generally the process<br>
involves preparing an activated polymer and thereafter reacting the protein with the activated<br>
polymer to produce the soluble protein suitable for formulation. The above modification<br>
reaction can be performed by several methods, which may involve one or more steps.<br>
The polymer can be coupled to the variant neublastin polypeptide using methods<br>
known in the art. For example, in one embodiment, the polyalkylene glycol moiety is<br>
coupled to a lysine group of the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide.<br>
Linkage to the lysine group can be performed with a N-hydroxylsuccinimide (NHS) active<br>
ester such as PEG succinimidyl succinate (SS-PEG) and succinimidyl propionate (SPAPEG).<br>
Suitable polyalkylene glycol moieties include, e.g^carboxymethyl-NHS, norleucine-<br>
NHS, SC-PEG, tresylate, aldehyde, epoxide, carbonylimidazole, and PNP carbonate.<br>
Additional amine reactive PEG linkers can be substituted for the succinimidyl moiety.<br>
These include, e.g. isothiocyanates, nitrophenylcarbonates, epoxides, and benzotriazole<br>
carbonates. Conditions are preferably chosen to maximize the selectivity and extent or<br>
reaction. Linear and branched forms of PEG can be used as well as other alkyl forms. The<br>
length of the PEG can be varied. Most common forms vary in size from 2K-100 K. While<br>
the present examples report that targeted pegylation at the N-terminus does not affect<br>
pharmokinetic properties, the fact that the material retained physiological function indicates<br>
that modification at the site or sites disclosed herein is not deleterious. Consequently, in<br>
generating mutant forms of NBN that could provide additional sites of attachment through<br>
insertion of lysine residues, the likely outcome that these forms would be pegylated both at<br>
the lysine and at the N-terminus is considered acceptable.<br>
If desired, neublastin variant polypeptides may contain a tag, e.g., a tag that can<br>
subsequently be released by proteolysis. Thus, the lysine moiety can be selectively modified<br>
by first reacting a Ms-tag variant with a low molecular weight linker such as Traut's reagent<br>
(Pierce) which will react with both the lysine and N-terminus, and then releasing the his tag.<br>
The polypeptide will then contain a free SH group that can be selectively modified with a<br>
PEG containing a thiol reactive head group such as a maleimide group, a vinylsulfone group,<br>
a haloacetate group, or a free or protected SH.<br>
Traut's reagent can be replaced with any linker that will set up a specific site for PEG<br>
attachment. By way of example, Traut's reagent could be-replaced with SPDP, SMPT,<br>
SATA, or SATP (all available from Pierce). Similarly one could react the protein with a<br>
amine reactive linker that inserts a maleimide (for example SMCC, AMAS, BMPS, MBS,<br>
EMCS, SMPB, SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS), a haloacetate group (SBAP, SIA, SIAB), or a<br>
vinylsulfone group and react the resulting product with a PEG that contains a free SH. The<br>
only limitation to the size of the linker that is employed is that it cannot block the subsequent<br>
removal of the N-terminal tag.<br>
Thus, in other embodiments, the polyalkylene glycol moiety is coupled to a cysteine<br>
group of the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide. Coupling can be<br>
effected using, e.g., a maleimide group, a vinylsulfone group, a haloacetate group, and a thiol<br>
group.<br>
One or more sites on a variant neublastin polypeptide can be coupled to a polymer.<br>
For example, one two, three, four, or five PEG moieties can be attached to the polymer. In<br>
some embodiments, a PEG moiety is attached at the amino terminus and/or amino acids 14,<br>
39, 68, and 95 of a neublastin polypeptide numbered as shown in Table 1.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the variant neublastin polypeptide in the composition has a<br>
longer serum half-life relative to the half-life of the variant polypeptide in the absence of the<br>
polymer. Alternatively, or in addition, the variant neublastin polypeptide in the composition<br>
binds GFRa3, activates RET, normalizes pathological changes of a neuron, or enhances<br>
survival of a neuron, or performs a combination of these physiological functions.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the composition is provided as a stable, aqueously soluble<br>
conjugated neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide complex comprising a<br>
neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide coupled to a polyethylene glycol<br>
moiety. If desired, the neublastin polypeptide or variant neublastin polypeptide may be<br>
coupled to the polyethylene glycol moiety by a labile bond. The labile bond can be cleaved<br>
in, e.g., biochemical hydrolysis, proteolysis, or sulfhydryl cleavage. For example, the bond<br>
can be cleaved under in vivo (physiological) conditions.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing variant neublastin-polymer conjugates<br>
Also provided is a pharmaceutical composition including a variant neublastinpolymer<br>
conjugate of the present invention. A "pharmaceutical composition" as used<br>
herein is defined as comprising a neublastin protein or conjugate of the invention, dispersed<br>
in a physiologically acceptable vehicle, optionally containing one or more other<br>
physiologically compatible ingredients. The pharmaceutical composition thus may contain<br>
an excipient such as water, one or more minerals, sugars, detergents, and one or more carriers<br>
such as an inert protein (e.g., heparin or albumin). .<br>
The polymer-neublastin conjugates of the invention may be administered per se as<br>
well as in the form of pharrnaceutically acceptable esters, salts, and other physiologically<br>
functional derivatives thereof. In such pharmaceutical and medicament formulations, the<br>
vaiiant neublastin conjugate preferably is utilized together with one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier(s) and optionally any other therapeutic ingredients.<br>
The carrier(s) must be pharmaceutically acceptable in the sense of being<br>
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not unduly deleterious to the<br>
recipient thereof. The variant neublastin is provided in an amount effective to achieve a<br>
desired pharmacological effect or medically beneficial effect, as described herein, and in a<br>
quantity appropriate to achieve the desired bioavailable in vivo dose or concentration.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for parenteral as well as non parenteral<br>
administration, and specific administration modalities include oral, rectal, buccal, topical,<br>
nasal, ophthalmic, subcutaneous, intramuscular, intravenous, transdermal, intrathecal, intraarticular,<br>
intra-arterial, sub-arachnoid, bronchial, lymphatic, vaginal, and intra-uterine<br>
administration. Formulations suitable for aerosol and parenteral administration, both locally<br>
and systemically, are preferred.<br>
When the variant neublastin is utilized in a formulation comprising a liquid solution,<br>
the formulation advantageously may be administered orally, bronchially, or parenterally.<br>
When the neublastin is employed in a liquid suspension formulation or as a powder in a<br>
biocompatible carrier formulation, the formulation may be advantageously administered<br>
orally, rectally, or bronchially. Alternatively, it may be administered nasally or bronchially,<br>
via nebulization of the powder in a carrier gas, to form a gaseous dispersion of the powder<br>
which is inspired by the patient from a breathing circuit comprising a suitable nebulizer<br>
device.<br>
The formulations comprising the proteins of the present invention may conveniently<br>
be presented in unit dosage forms and may be prepared by any of the methods well known in<br>
the art of pharmacy. Such methods generally include the step of bringing the active<br>
ingredient(s) into association with a carrier which constitutes one or jnore accessory<br>
ingredients.<br>
Typically, the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately bringing the<br>
active ingredient(s) into association with a liquid carrier/a finely divided solid carrier, or<br>
both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into dosage forms of the desired<br>
formulation.<br>
Formulations of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be<br>
presented as discrete units such as capsules, cachets, tablets, or lozenges, each containing a<br>
predetermined amount of the active ingredient as a powder or granules; or a suspension in an<br>
aqueous liquor or a non-aqueous liquid, such as a syrup, an elixir, an emulsion, or a draught.<br>
Formulations suitable for parenteral administration conveniently comprise a sterile<br>
aqueous preparation of the active conjugate, which preferably is isotonic with the blood of<br>
the recipient (e.g., physiological saline solution). Such formulations may include suspending<br>
agents and thickening agents or other micropaiticulate systems which are designed to target<br>
the compound to blood components or one or more organs. The formulations may be<br>
presented in unit-dose or multi-dose form.<br>
Nasal spray formulations comprise purified aqueous solutions of the active conjugate<br>
with preservative agents and isotonic agents. Such formulations are preferably adjusted to a<br>
pH and isotonic state compatible with the nasal mucus membranes.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with a<br>
suitable carrier such as cocoa butter, hydrogenated fats, or hydrogenated fatty carboxylic<br>
acid. Ophthalmic formulations such as eye drops are prepared by a similar method to the<br>
nasal spray, except that the pH and isotonic factors are preferably adjusted to match that of<br>
the eye.<br>
Topical formulations comprise the conjugates of the invention dissolved or suspended<br>
in one or more media, such as mineral oil, petroleum, polyhydroxy alcohols, or other bases<br>
used for topical pharmaceutical formulations.<br>
In addition to the aforementioned ingredients, the formulations of this invention may<br>
further include one or more accessory ingredient(s) selected from diluents, buffers, flavoring<br>
agents, disintegrants, surface active agents, thickeners, lubricants, preservatives (including<br>
antioxidants), and the like. The foregoing considerations apply also to the neublastin fusion<br>
proteins of the invention (e.g., neublastin-HSA fusions).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention contemplates the provision of suitable fusion<br>
proteins for in vitro stabilization of a variant neublastin conjugate in solution, as a preferred<br>
illustrative application of the invention. The fusion proteins may be employed for example to<br>
increase the resistance to enzymatic degradation of the variant neublastin polypeptide and<br>
provides a means of improving shelf life, room temperature stability, and the like. It is<br>
understood that the foregoing considerations apply also to the neublastin-serum albumin<br>
fusion proteins (including the human neublastin-human serum albumin fusion proteins) of the<br>
invention.<br>
Methods of treatment<br>
The variant neublastin polypeptides, as well as fusion proteins, or conjugates thereof,<br>
may be used for treating or alleviating a disorder or disease of a living animal body,<br>
preferably of a mammal, more preferably a primate including a human, which disorder or<br>
disease is responsive to the activity of neurotrophic agents.<br>
The compositions of the invention may be used directly via, e.g., injected, implanted<br>
or ingested pharmaceutical compositions to treat a pathological process responsive to the<br>
neublastin polypeptides. The compositions may be used for alleviating a disorder or disease<br>
of a living animal body, including a human, which disorder or disease is responsive to the<br>
activity of neurotrophic agents. The disorder or disease may in particular be damage of the<br>
nervous system caused by trauma, surgery, ischemia, infection, metabolic diseases,<br>
nutritional deficiency, malignancy or toxic agents, and genetic or idiopathic processes.<br>
The damage may in particular have occurred to sensory neurons or retinal ganglion<br>
cells, including neurons in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord or in any of the following<br>
tissues: the geniculate, petrosal and nodose ganglia; the vestibuloacoustic complex of the<br>
eighth cranial nerve; the ventrolateral pole of the maxillomandribular lobe of the trigeminal<br>
ganglion; and the mesencephalic trigeminal nucleus.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, the disease or disorder is a<br>
neurodegenerative disease involving lesioned and traumatic neurons, such as traumatic<br>
lesions of peripheral nerves, the medulla, and/or the spinal cord, cerebral ischemic neuronal<br>
damage, neuropathy and especially peripheral neuropathy, peripheral nerve trauma or injury,<br>
ischemic stroke, acute brain injury, acute spinal cord injury, nervous system tumors, multiple<br>
sclerosis, exposure to neurotoxins, metabolic diseases such as diabetes or renal dysfunctions<br>
and damage caused by infectious agents, neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's<br>
disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Parkinson-Plus syndromes, progressive<br>
Supranuclear Palsy (Steele-Puchardson-Olszewski Syndrome), Olivopontocerebellar Atrophy<br>
(OPCA), Shy-Drager Syndrome (multiple systems atrophy), Guamanian parkinsonism<br>
dementia complex, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or any other congenital or<br>
neurodegenerative disease, and memory impairment connected to dementia.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, sensory and/or autonomic system neurons can be treated.<br>
In particular, nociceptive and mechanoreceptive neurons can be treated, more particularly<br>
delta fiber and C-fiber neurons. In addition, sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons of the<br>
autonomic system can be treated.<br>
In another'preferred embodiment, motor neuron diseases such as amyotrophic lateral<br>
sclerosis ("ALS") and spinal muscular atrophy can be treated. In yet another preferred<br>
embodiment, the neublastin molecules of this invention to can be used to enhance nerve<br>
recovery following traumatic injury. Alternatively, or in addition, a nerve guidance channel<br>

The invention will be further illustrated in the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1—Unavailability of N-terminal pegylated neublastin<br>
CHO cell derived recombinant human neublastin was observed to be rapidly cleared<br>
from circulation if administered intl'avenously in rats. None of the protein was detected in the<br>
serum following subcutaneous administration. To increase bioavailability of neublastin,<br>
pegylated forms were constructed.<br>
Because no lysines occur in the NBN sequence, amine-specific pegylation chemistries<br>
will result in pegylation of an NBN polypeptide at its amino terminus. Thus, for each<br>
neublastin dimer, two PEG moieties should be attached. Accordingly, PEG forms were first<br>
directly targeted to the N-terminus through amine specific chemistries. Surprisingly,<br>
pegylation even with two, 20 K PEGs attached had little benefit on half life, indicating that a<br>
mechanism based clearance pathway was overriding the enhancement in half life that was<br>
expected to be achieved by pegylation.<br>
Example 2-Construction of a pegylated neublastin N95K mutein<br>
The bioavailability of NBN mutant forms pegylated at internal amino acid residues<br>
was next examined. A series of four mutants replacing naturally occurring residues at<br>
positions 14, 39, 68, and 95 were designed to insert lysines at selected sites in the sequence.<br>
These lysines would provide alternative sites for PEG attachment. These sites were selected<br>
using the crystal structure of GDNF (Nat.Struct.Biol. 4: 435-8, 1997) as a framework to<br>
identify surface residues and the persephin/ neublastin chimera mutagenesis study<br>
 (J.Biol.Chem. 275: 3412-20, 2000) to identify functionally important regions of the structure<br>
that should be avoided.<br>
Two of the mutations (R39 and R68) were targeted at a region that based on the<br>
distribution of positive charges on the surface might represent a heparin binding site, a<br>
property of the protein which likely contributes to its rapid clearance. A third site was<br>
targeted at N95, the natural glycosylation site in wild-type NBN. This site is naturally<br>
modified with a complex carbohydrate structure. Therefore, modification with PEG at this<br>
site was not expected to impact function. The fourth site (R14) was selected in a region that<br>
was not covered by any other of the modifications. A mutant in which the asparagine residue<br>
at position 95 was replaced with a lysine (the "N95K mutant") was chosen for the studies<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
Four different rat neublastin muteins containing one or more alterations in the wildtype<br>
sequence of rat neublastin polypeptide were constructed. The muteins include the single<br>
N95K mutein, and the muteins containing single substitutions at other sites in the amino acid<br>
sequence of rat neublastin: R14K; R68K; and R39K. In the "XiNiX2" nomenclature, X:<br>
refers to an amino acid of a wild-type neublastin polypeptide, NI refers to the numerical<br>
position of the Xi amino acids in the sequence, as numbered according to SEQ ID NO: 1. Xa<br>
refers to an amino acid substituted for the wild-type amino acid at the indicated numerical<br>
position in the sequence.<br>
To construct the rat N95K neublastin mutation, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on<br>
pCMB020, a plasmid encoding wild-type rat neublastin. The wild-type rat neublastin nucleic<br>
and the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded thereby are presented below:<br>
(Table Removed)Mutagenesis of pCM020 using oligonucleotides KD2-310 and KD3-211 resulted in<br>
formation of the plasmid pCMB027:<br>
In pCMB027, the codtm encoding asparagine at position 95 has been replaced with a<br>
codon encoding lysine.<br>
A R14K neublastin mutein formed by replacement of a codon encoding arginine at<br>
position 14 with a codon encoding lysine in the neublastin coding sequence of pCMB020.<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCMB020 using oligonucleotides KD3-254 and<br>
The resulting construct was named pCMB029.<br>
A R68K neublastin mutein formed by replacement of a codon encoding arginine at<br>
position 68 with a codon encoding lysine in the neublastin coding sequence of pCMB020.<br>
Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on pCMB020 using oligonucleotides KD3-25S and<br>
The resulting construct was named pCMBOSO.<br>
A R39K neublastin mutein formed by replacement of arginine at amino acid 39 with<br>
lysine in the neublastin coding sequence of pCMB020. Site-directed mutagenesis of<br>
pCMB027 was performed using oligonucleotides KD3-256 and KD3-257:<br>
For expression and purification, a plasmid encoding the rat NBN N95K mutein was<br>
expressed ini as a His-tagged fusion protein with an enterokinase cleavage site<br>
immediately adjacent to the start of the mature 113 amino acid NBN sequence. The E.coli<br>
was grown in a 500 L fermentor and frozen cell paste was provided. The E.coli cells were<br>
lysed in a Manton Gaulin Press and the rat NBN NK recovered from the insoluble washed<br>
pellet fraction.<br>
The NBN was extracted from the pellet with guanidine hydrochloride, refolded, and<br>
the his-tag removed with enterokinase. The product was then subjected to chromatography on<br>
Ni NTA agarose (Qiagen) and on Bakerbond WP CBX cation exchange resin.<br>
Enterokinase treatment of the his tagged product resulted in an aberrant cleavage of<br>
the protein at arginine 7 in the mature sequence. The resulting des 1-7 NBN product was fully<br>
active in the KIRA ELISA and structurally indistinguishable from the mature form in its<br>
susceptibility to guanidine-induced denaturation and therefore was used for subsequent work.<br>
Rat NBN N95K was pegylated at an average of 3.3 PEG moieties/molecule using<br>
methoxylpoly(ethylene glycol)-succinimidyl propionate (SPA-PEG) with a molecular mass<br>
of 10,000 Da as the reactant. The resulting pegylated product was subjected to extensive<br>
characterization including analysis by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography (SEC),<br>
reverse phase HPLC, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectromeiry<br>
(MALD/IMS), pep tide mapping, assessment of activity in the BORA ELISA, and<br>
determination of endotoxin content. The purity of the NBN N95K product prior to pegylation<br>
as measured by SDS-PAGE and SEC was greater than 95%. The NBN N95K product<br>
migrated under nonreducing conditions as a dirner, consistent with its predicted structure.<br>
After pegylation, the resulting product consisted of a series of modified adducts containing 2<br>
PEGs/ molecule 5% of the product, 3 PEGs/molecule 60% of the product, 4 PEGs/molecule<br>
30% of the product, and several minor forms of higher mass. In the pegylated sample there<br>
was no.evidence of aggregates. Residual levels of unmodified NBN in the product were<br>
below the limits of quantitation. The endotoxin content of the material is routinely less than 1<br>
EU/mg. The specific activity of the pegylated NBN in the KIRA ELISA is 10 nM. The<br>
pegylated product was formulated at 1.1 mg/mL in PBS pH 6.5. The material, which is<br>
similar in potency to wt-NBN, can be supplied as a frozen liquid, which is stored at -70°C.<br>
The R14K, R39K, and R68K muteins were expressed in E. coli and can be subjected<br>
to the same methods for purification, pegylation and assessment of function as described<br>
above for the N95K-NBN.<br>
Preparation of pegylated NBN<br>
230 mL of the refolded rat NBN N95K (2.6 mg/mL) that had been produced in E.coli<br>
and stored at 4°C in 5 niM sodium phosphate pH 6.5, 100 mM NaCl was diluted with 77 mL<br>
of water, 14.4 mL of 1M HEPES pH7.5, and 2.8 g (10 mg/mL final) of PEG SPA 10,000 Da<br>
(Shearwater Polymers, Inc.). The sample was incubated at room temperature for 4 hours in<br>
the dark, then treated with 5 mM imidazole (final), filtered, and stored overnight at 4°C. The<br>
product was generated in two batches one containing 130 mL of the NBN N95K bulk and the<br>
other containing 100 mL of the bulk. The pegylated NBN was purified from the reaction<br>
mixture on Fractogel EMD S03' (M) (EM Industries). The column was run at room<br>
temperature. All buffers were prepared pyrogen free. Sodium chloride was added to the<br>
reaction mixture to a final concentration of 87 mM and the sample was loaded onto a 45 mL<br>
Fractogel column (5 cm internal diameter).<br>
The column was washed with one column volume of 5 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.5,<br>
80 mM NaCl, then with three one column volume aliquots of 5 mM sodium phosphate<br>
containing 50 mM NaCl. The resin was transferred into a 2.5 cm diameter column and the<br>
pegylated NBN was eluted from the column with six ten mL steps containing 5 mM sodium<br>
phosphate pH 6.5, 400 mM NaCl, three steps containing 500 mL NaCl, and six steps<br>
containing 600 mM NaCl. Elution fractions were analyzed for protein content by absorbance<br>
at 280 nm and then for extent of modification by SDS-PAGE. Selected fractions were pooled,<br>
filtered through a 0. 2 pun filter, and diluted with water to 1.1 mg pegylated ratNBN/mL.<br>
After assessing endotoxin levels in the individual batches, they were pooled and refiltered<br>
through a 0.2 |xm membrane. The final material was aliquoted and stored at - 70°C.<br>
UV spectrum of purified pegylated NBN NK<br>
The UV spectrum (240-340 nm) of pegylated NBN NK was taken on the neat<br>
sample. The sample was analyzed in triplicate. The pegylated sample exhibited an absorbance<br>
maximum at 275-277 nm and an absorbance minimum at 247-249. This result is consistent<br>
with what is observed on the unmodified NBN bulk intermediate. The protein concentration<br>
of the pegylated product was estimated from the spectrum using an extinction coefficient of<br>
28o°'I%=0-50. The protein concentration of the pegylated NBN bulk is 1.1 mg/rnL, No<br>
turbidity was present in the sample as evident by the lack of absorbance at 320 nm.<br>
Characterization of pegvlated NBN NK by SDS-PAGE<br>
Aliquots of pegylated NBN containing 3, 1.5, 0.75, and 0.3 (o.g of the product were<br>
subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 4-20% gradient gel (Owl). The gel was stained with Coomassie<br>
brilliant blue R-250. Molecular weight markers (GIBCO-BRL) were ran in parallel.<br>
SDS-PAGE analysis of pegylated NBN NK under non reducing conditions revealed a<br>
series of bands corresponding to modifications with 2, 3, 4, and more than 4 PEGs/ molecule.<br>
The major band with apparent mass of 98 kDa contains 3 PEGS/ molecules. In the purified,<br>
pegylated product unmodified NBN was not detected. The presence of a mixture of products<br>
with 2, 3 and 4 PEGS attached was verified by MALDI mass spectrometric analysis. The<br>
ratio of product containing 2, 3, and 4 PEGs was determined by densitometry and determined<br>
to be 7, 62, and 30 percent of the total, respectively.<br>
Characterization of pegvlated NBN by size exclusion chromatography<br>
Pegylated NBN was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on an analytical<br>
Superose 6 HR1O/30 FPLC column using 5 mM MES pH 6.5, 300 mM NaCl as the mobile<br>
phase. The column was run at 20 mL/h. Elution fractions were monitored for absorbance at<br>
280 nm. The pegylated NBN eluted as a single peak with an apparent molecular weight of<br>
about 200 kDa consistent with the large hydrodynamic volume of the PEG. No evidence of<br>
aggregates were observed. Free NBN, which elutes with an apparent molecular mass of about<br>
30kDa, was not detected in the preparation.<br>
Analysis of pegylated NBN by reverse phase HPLC<br>
Pegylated NBN NK was subjected to reverse phase HPLC on a Vydac C4 (5 jxm, 1 x<br>
250 mm) column. The column was developed using a 60 mm gradient from 40 to 60% B<br>
(Buffer A: 0. 1% TFA, Buffer B: 75% acetonitrile/0.085% TFA). The column effluent was<br>
monitored for absorbance at 214 nm and fractions collected for subsequent analysis. - .<br>
Pegylated NBN NK was fractionated into its various di (60.5 mm), tri (63.3 mm), and tetra<br>
(67.8 mm) pegylated components by reverse phase HPLC on a C4 column. The relative<br>
intensities of the peaks suggest that the ratios of the components are 5.4, 60.5, and 30.1 %,<br>
respectively. Peak identities were verified by MALDI-MS. There was no evidence of non<br>
pegylated NBN NK (elutes at 5- 15 mm) in the product.<br>
Analysis of pegylated NBN by mass spectrometry<br>
Pegylated NBN NK was desalted on a C4 Zip Tip and analyzed by mass spectrometry<br>
on a Voyager-DE™ STR (PerSeptive Biosystems) matrix-assisted laser desorption/<br>
ionization time-of- flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer using sinapinic acid as a matrix.<br>
0.5 uL of the purified protein was mixed with 0.5 uL of matrix on the target plate. Mass<br>
spectrometry of pegylated NBN revealed singly and doubly charged forms of three adducts.<br>
The observed masses of 43803 Da, 54046 Da, and 64438 Da are consistent with<br>
modifications of 2, 3, and 4 PEGs/ molecule.<br>
Analysis of pegylated NBN by peptide mapping.<br>
The specificity of the pegylation reaction was evaluated by peptide mapping.<br>
Pegylated NBN was separated into di, tri, and tetra pegylated components, which were then<br>
reduced, alkylated, and further separated into their single chain components by HPLC on a C4<br>
column. These components and reduced and alkylated unmodified NBN NK as a control<br>
were digested with Asp-N proteinase and the resulting cleavage products were fractionated<br>
by reversed phase HPLC on a Vydac Cis (5 )j,m, 1 x 250 mm) column using a 60 mm<br>
gradient from 0 to 60% B (Buffer A: 0.1 % TFA, Buffer B: 75% acetonitrile/0.085% TFA).<br>
The column effluent was monitored for absorbance at 214 mm.<br>
The rat NBN sequence contains four internal aspartic acids and therefore was<br>
expected to yield a simple cleavage profile when digested with endoproteinase Asp-N. All of<br>
the peaks from the Asp-N digest of rat NBN NK have been identified by mass spectrometry<br>
and/or Edman N-terminal sequencing and thus the peptide map can be used as a simple tool<br>
to probe for the sites of modification by the presence or absence of a peak. The identity of the<br>
various peaks are summarized below in Table 3<br>
(Table Removed)Since NBN exists as a homodimer, the rat NBN NK product contains four potential<br>
sites for pegylation, the two N-terminal amines from each of the chains and the two N95K<br>
sites that were engineered into the construct. In the peptide map of the dipegylated chain,<br>
only the peak that contains the peptide with the NK mutation was altered by the PEG<br>
modification. None of the other peaks were affected by the PEG modification. The mapping<br>
data therefore indicate that the PEG moiety is specifically attached to this peptide and not to<br>
any of the other peptides that were screened. The second potential site of attachment, the Nterminus<br>
is on a peptide that is only three amino acids long and is not detected in the peptide<br>
map. It is inferred that additional PEG attachments are at this site. Consistent with this notion,<br>
a small percentage of the rat NBN NK is not truncated and contains the mature Ala-I<br>
sequence. This peptide elutes at 30 ^m and is visible in the peptide map from the nonpegylated<br>
digest, but is absent from the pegylated NBN NK digests.<br>
Example 3. Assessing the potency of internally pegylated neublastin in. a kinase<br>
receptor activation (K3RA) ELISA<br>
The potency of pegylated rat NBN was measured using NBN dependent activation/<br>
phosphorylation of c-Ret as a reporter for NBN activity in an ELISA that was specific for the<br>
presence of phosphorylated RET. NB41A3-mRL3 cells, an adherent murine neuroblastoma<br>
cell line which expresses Ret and GFRaS, were plated at 2 x 105 cells per well in 24-well<br>
plates in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10 % fetal bovine<br>
serum, and cultured for 18 h at 37 °C and 5 % CO2.<br>
The cells were washed with PBS, and treated with serial dilutions of NBN in 0.25 roL<br>
of DMEM for 10 min at 37 °C and 5 % CO2. Each sample was analyzed in duplicate. The<br>
cells were washed with 1 mL of PBS, and lysed for Ih at 4 °C with 0.30 mL of 10 mM Tris<br>
HC1, pH 8.0, 0.5 % Nonidet P40, 0.2 % sodium deoxycholate, 50 mM NaF, 0.1 mM Na3<br>
VO4,1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride with gently rocking the plates. The lysates were<br>
further agitated by repeated pipetting and 0.25 ml. of sample was transferred to a 96- well<br>
ELISA plate that had been coated with 5 |0.g/mL of anti-Ret mAb (AA.GE7.3) in 50 mM<br>
carbonate buffer, pH 9.6 at 4°C for 18 h, and blocked at room temperature for one hour with<br>
block buffer (20 mM Tris HC1 pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (TEST) containing 1<br>
% normal mouse serum and 3 % bovine serum albumin).<br>
After a 2 h incubation at room temperature, the wells were washed 6-times with<br>
TEST. Phosphorylated Ret was detected by incubating the wells at room temperature for 2 h ,<br>
with 2 :g/mL of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10<br>
antibody in block buffer, washing 6-times with TEST, and measuring HRP activity at 450 nm<br>
with a colorometric detection reagent. The absorbance values from wells treated with lysate<br>
or with lysis buffer were measured and the background corrected signal was plotted as a<br>
function of the concentration of NBN present in the activation mixture. The potency of<br>
pegylated NBN in the KIRA ELISA was 10 nM, which is indistinguishable from that of the<br>
NBN NK starting material. There was no effect of two freeze-thaw cycles on potency and<br>
following this treatment there was no significant increase in the turbidity of the sample,<br>
indicating that the samples can be safely thawed for the study. In independent studies<br>
accessing the activity of product with three and four 10 kDa PEGs/molecule separately, it<br>
was determined that the adduct with three PEGs was fully active, while the four PEG product<br>
had reduced activity.<br>
Example 4. Pharmokinetic studies of internally pegylated rat neublastin in rats and<br>
mice<br>
The pharmokinetic properties of various pegylated and non pegylated NBN products<br>
in rat and mouse models were examined.<br>
The data revealed that pegylation of rat NBN NK with 3.3,10000 Da PEGs resulted<br>
in a significant effect on the half life and bioavailability of the neublastin. Following a 1<br>
mg/kg IV administration in Sprague Dawley rats, peak levels of pegylated NBN of 3000<br>
ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, and levels of 700 ng/mL were detected after 24 h, 200<br>
ng/mL after 48 h, and 100 ng/mL after 72 h. In contrast for non pegylated NBN following a 1<br>
mg/kg IV administration, levels of 1500 ng/mL were detected after 7 minutes, but then the<br>
levels quickly dropped to 70 ng/mL after 3 h and were not detectable after 7 h. The effects of<br>
pegylation were even more pronounced in animals treated with pegylated NBN by<br>
subcutaneous administration.<br>
Following a 1 mg/kg s.c. administration, circulating levels of pegylated NBN reached a<br>
maximum of 200 ng/mL after 24 h and remained at this level for the duration of the three day<br>
study. In contrast, no detectable NBN was observed at any time point following<br>
administration of unmodified NBN.<br>
The analysis of the pegylated NBN samples are complicated by the presence of<br>
adducts containing 2, 3 and 4 PEGs per molecule, which each will display a different PK<br>
profile. In early PK studies, mice were used to facilitate screening through a variety of<br>
candidates and routes of administration. The mouse studies revealed dramatic differences in<br>
the bioavailability of the candidates. However, when the 3.3 10 K PEG adduct was evaluated<br>
in rats, it was found to be less bioavailable in rats than it was in mice. This difference in<br>
bioavailability was particularly pronounced following i.p. administration. Levels in mice<br>
reached 1600 ng/mL after 7 hr and remained at 400 ng/mL after 24 hr. In contrast, rat levels<br>
were constant at 100 ng/mL for 4-48 hr.<br>
Both wild-type rat neublastin (wt-NBN) and neublastin with an Asn-to-Lys<br>
substitution at position 95 (NK-NBN) were refolded and purified to &gt;95% for efficacy tests<br>
in the STZ diabetic rat neuropathy model. Wt-NBN was formulated to go directly into animal<br>
testing while NK-NBN was prepared for pegylation with 10 kDa PEG-SPA. To accomplish<br>
the refolding and purification goal, a refolding method utilizing size exclusion<br>
chromatography (SEC) was developed that permitted the renaturation of NBN from E.coli<br>
inclusion bodies in large quantities and at high concentrations. In addition to SEC, both Ni-<br>
NTA and CM silica column chromatography steps were employed to increase the final<br>
protein purity. The proteins were subjected to extensive characterization including analysis<br>
by SDS-PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, ESMS, assessment of activity by KIRA<br>
ELIS A, and determination of endotoxin content. SDS-PAGE and SEC of the final protein<br>
products indicated a purity of greater than 95%. The endotoxin level of each product was 
0.2 EU/mg. The specific activity of both proteins in the KIRA ELISA is approximately 10<br>
nM. Wt-NBN was formulated at 1.0 rag/ml and NK-NBN was formulated at 2.6 mg/ml in<br>
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) pH6.5. wt-NBN was aliquoted into 15 ml tubes and stored<br>
frozen at -70°C while NK-NBN was subjected to pegylation prior to aliquoting and freezing.<br>
Example 5. Refolding of a wild-type neubiastin and the N95K neublastin mutein<br>
Both NBN forms were expressed in E. coli as a His-tagged fusion proteins with an<br>
enterokinase cleavage site immediately adjacent to the start of the mature 113 amino acid<br>
sequence. Bacteria expressing either Wt- (1.8 kg pellet) or NK-NBN (2.5 kg pellet) were<br>
subjected to lysis in 2 liters of PBS using a Gaulin press. Following centrifugation (10,000<br>
rpm) to pellet the inclusion bodies, the supernatants from each preparation were discarded.<br>
The inclusion body pellets were washed two times with buffer (0.02M Tris-HCIpH 8.5, 0.5<br>
mM EDTA) then washed two times with the same buffer containing Triton X-l 00 (2%, v/v)<br>
followed by two additional buffer washes without detergent. Both pellets were solubilized<br>
using 6M guanidine hydrochloride, 0.1M Tris pH 8.5, 0.1M DTT, and 1 mM EDTA. To aid<br>
in the solubilization process, each pellet was subjected to homogenization using a polytron<br>
homogenizer followed by overnight stirring at room temperature. The solubilized:proteins<br>
were clarified by centrifugation prior to denaturing chromatography through Superdex 200<br>
(5.5 liter column equilibrated with 0.05M glycine/H3P04 pH 3.0 with 2M Guanidine-HCI) at<br>
20 ml per minute.<br>
Denatured NBN was identified by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing either Wt-NBN<br>
or NK-NBN were pooled and concentrated to approximately 250 mL using an Amicon 2.5-<br>
liter stirred cell concentrator. After filtration to remove any precipitate, the concentrated<br>
protein was subjected to renaturing sizing chromatography through Superdex 200<br>
equilibrated with 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 7.8, 0.5M guanidine-HCl, 8.8 mM reduced glutathione<br>
and 0.22 mM oxidized glutathione. The column was developed using 0.5M guanidine-HCl at<br>
20 mL per minute. Fractions containing renatured wt-NBN or NK-NBN were identified by<br>
SDS-PAGE, pooled, and stored at 4°C until needed for His tag removal.<br>
Concentration of NBN by Ni-NTA chromatographv (TR5919-138).<br>
Renatured NBN was stored at 4°C for at least 24 hours before proceeding with the<br>
purification to promote disulfide formation between the NBN monomers. During this time, a<br>
precipitate formed and was removed by filtration through a 0.2 jo, PES filter unit. To decrease<br>
non-specific binding, the protein solution was brought to 20 mM imidazole prior to loading<br>
on a 100 ml Ni-NTA (Qiagen) column equilibrated with column buffer (0.5M guanidine and<br>
20 mM irnidazole) at 50 ml per minute. Following the protein application, the column was<br>
washed to baseline using the same buffer. NBN was eluted from the resin using<br>
approximately 300 mL of elution buffer containing 0.5M guanidine-HCl and 0.4M imidazole.<br>
After elution, NBN was dialyzed overnight (using 10 kDa dialysis tubing) at room<br>
temperature against ten volumes of 5 mM HCI. Dialysis promotes the hydrolysis of<br>
contaminating substances and decreases the guanidine-HCl and imidazole concentrations to<br>
0.05M and 0.04M, respectively.<br>
Cleavage of the His tag by Lysyl Endopeptidase or Enterokinase.<br>
The next day, any precipitate that formed during dialysis was removed by filtration.<br>
The protein sample was made 0.1 M NaCl by the addition of 5M stock for a final salt<br>
concentration including the remaining guanidine-HCl of approximately 150mM. This<br>
concentration was confirmed using a conductivity meter. Additionally, 1 M HEPES pH 8 was<br>
added for a final concentration of 25mM. To cleave the tag, lysyl endopeptidase was added to<br>
wt-NBN and Enterokinase was added to NK-NBN, both at an approximately 1:300 ratio of<br>
protease to NBN. Enterokinase was used in place of lysyl endopeptidase for NK-NBN due to<br>
an additional protease cleavage site in the mutated protein at Lys95. The samples were stirred<br>
at room temperature for 2 hours and the digestions monitored by SDS-PAGE.<br>
His tag removal by Ni-NTA chromatographv.<br>
Protease-treated NBN was applied to a 100 mL Ni-NTA column equiliberated with<br>
0.5M guanidine-HCl and 20 mM imidazole at 50 mL per minute. The column was washed to<br>
baseline with the same buffer. Any protein washing off the column was pooled with the flowthrough<br>
protein containing NBN without the His tag.<br>
CM silica chromatographv.<br>
Following Ni-NTA chromatography, the protein was immediately subjected to further<br>
purification through CM silica resin. A 20 mL CM silica column equiliberated with loading<br>
buffer (5 mM phosphate pH 6.5, 150 mM NaCl) was loaded with NBN at 20 mL per minute.<br>
The column was washed with twenty column volumes of wash buffer (5 mM phosphate pH<br>
6.5, 400 mM NaCl) and the protein step eluted with elution buffer containing 5 mM<br>
phosphate pH 6.5 but with 1 M NaCl. The eluted protein was dialyzed overnight against the<br>
phosphate alone to bring the salt concentration down to 100 mM for NK-NBN and 150 mM<br>
for wt-NBN. Both samples were filtered through a 0.2 u. PES filter unit, analyzed by SDSPAGE,<br>
and stored at 4°C until needed for further characterizations and/or pegylation.<br>
Wt-NBN and NK-NBN were subjected to UV spectrum analysis to assess their<br>
absorbance at 280. Using a micro quartz cuvette and blanking against buffer alone, 100 jjl of<br>
either wt-NBN or NK-NBN was continuously scanned from 230 to 330 nm using a Beckman<br>
spectrophotometer. Based on this analysis, Wt-NBN was determined to be at a concentration<br>
of 1.1 rag/ml and NK-NBN at 2.6 rag/ml (A280 nm-E0'1%=0.5 used for each protein). Less<br>
than 1 % precipitated material was identified based on absorbance at 330 nm.<br>
To assess the purity of both protein preparations, each sample (0.5 mg) was subjected<br>
to size exclusion chromatography through a 16/30 Superdex 75 column. The column was<br>
equiliberated with 5mM phosphate pH 6.5 containing 400 mM NaCl and developed with a<br>
1.5 mL per minuteTlow rate. Based on the absorbance at 280 nm, both wt- and NK-NBN<br>
migrated as a single peak with an expected molecular weight (23-24 kDa), and they did not<br>
contain any significant protein contamination.<br>
Both wt- and NK-NBN were reduced in 2.5 M guanidine-HCl, 60 mM Tris pH 8.0<br>
and 16 mM DTT. The reduced samples were desalted over a short C* column and analyzed<br>
on-line by ESMS using a triple quadrupole instrument. The ESMS raw data were<br>
deconvoluted by the MaxEnt program to generate mass spectra. This procedure allows<br>
multiple charged signals to collapse into one peak that directly corresponds to the molecular<br>
mass in kilodaltons (kDa). The deconvoluted mass spectrum for wt-NBN showed the<br>
predominant species is 12046 kDa, which is in agreement with the predicted molecular<br>
weight of 12046.7 kDa for the 113 amino acid form of the protein. A minor component was<br>
also observed (12063 kDa) suggesting the presence of an oxidation product. Three peaks<br>
were identified in the NK-NBN sample. The major component demonstrated an apparent<br>
molecular mass of 11345 kDa in agreement with the predicted mass for the 106 amino acid<br>
form of the protein. The other two peaks had masses of 11362 and 12061 kDa, suggesting<br>
NK-NBN oxidation and the presence of the 113 amino acid form, respectively.<br>
The presence of the 106 and 113 amino acid forms in the NK-NBN preparation is<br>
attributable to digestion with Enterokinase. This protease from Biozyme is a natural enzyme<br>
preparation purified from calf intestinal mucosa and is reported to contain a slight trypsin<br>
contamination (0.25 ng Trypsin per |jig Enterokinase). Therefore, trypsin may be acting on<br>
NK-NBN on the carboxy terminal side of Arg7 to produce the predominant 106 amino acid<br>
form. On the other hand, Lysyl Endopeptidase used to cleave Wt-NBN is a single protease<br>
activity acting on the carboxy terminal side of the lysine residue contained wjthin the His tag<br>
to produce the mature 113 amino acid NBN form. Both "the 106 and 113 amino acid forms of<br>
NBN are equally active in all assays tested and behave similarly in guanidine-HCl stability<br>
tests.<br>
NBN activity was determined by its ability to stimulate c-Ret phosphorylation in<br>
NB41A3-mRL3 cells using the KIRA ELISA described in Example 3. Phosphorylated Ret<br>
was detected by incubating (2 hours) the captured receptor with HRP-conjugated<br>
phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10; 0.2 ^g per well). Following the incubation, the wells were<br>
washed six times with TEST, and the HRP activity detected at 450 nm with a colorimetric<br>
assay. The absorbance values from wells treated with lysate or with lysis buffer alone were<br>
measured, background corrected, and the data plotted as a function of the concentration of<br>
neublastin present in the activation mixture. The data demonstrate that the purified NBN<br>
resulted in the appearance of phosphorylated RET, indicating that the purified NBN was<br>
active in this assay.<br>
Example 6. Preparation of a serum albumin-neublastin conjugate.<br>
Wildtype rat neublastin at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in PBS was treated with 1 mM<br>
sulfo-SMCC (Pierce) and desalted to remove excess cross-linker. Since the wildtype NBN<br>
protein contains only a single amine at its N-terminus and no free sulfhydryl groups, reaction<br>
with SMCC was expected to result in site specific modification of the NBN with SMCC<br>
attached at its N-terminus.<br>
60 jig of the NBN-SMCC conjugate was incubated with 120 ftg of bovine serum<br>
albumin and analyzed for extent of cross-linking by SDS-PAGE. BSA contains a single free<br>
SH group and consequently reaction with the NBN-SMCC conjugate is expected to result in<br>
modification at this site through the maleimide on the SMCC. Under these conditions, two<br>
additional bands of higher molecular weight were observed, which are consistent in mass<br>
with modification of the NBN with a single BSA moiety and with two BSA molecules since<br>
each NBN molecule contains two N-termini that can undergo reaction, and consequently are<br>
in agreement with this notion. Concurrent with the formation of these bands, was a decrease<br>
in the intensity of die NBN-SMCC and BSA bands. Based on the intensity of the remaining<br>
NBN band the reaction appeared to have gone to 70-80% completion.<br>
The monosubstituted product was purified from the reaction mixture by subjecting the<br>
material to cation exchange chromatography and size exclusion chromatography on a<br>
Superdex 200 column (Pharmacia) essentially as described for pegylation studies discussed<br>
above. Column fractions from the gel filtration run were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and those<br>
containing the monosubstituted product were analyzed for protein content by absorbance at<br>
280 nm. Since the mass of BSA is approximately twice that of neublastin, the apparent<br>
concentration was divided by a factor of 3 to give the NBN equivalent. This fraction was<br>
subjected this to analysis for function in the KLRA ELISA. IC50 values for both the wt- and<br>
BSA-conjugated NBN were 3-6 nM, indicating that conjugation to the BSA had not<br>
compromised function.<br>
While these preliminary studies were generated with BSA, the corresponding serum<br>
albumin proteins from rats and humans also contain a free SH. Consequently a similar<br>
approach can be applied to generate a rat serum albumin-rat NBN conjugate for performing<br>
PK and efficacy studies in rats and human serum albumin-human NBN for performing<br>
clinical trials. Similarly SMCC can be substituted with any of a number of cross-linkers that<br>
contain an amino reactive group on one side and a thiol reactive group on the other side.<br>
Examples of amine reactive cross-linkers that insert a thiol reactive-maleimide are AMAS,<br>
BMPS, MBS, EMCS, SMPB, SMPH, KMUS, or GMBS, that insert a thiol reactivehaloacetate<br>
group are SBAP, SLA, SLAB and that provide a protected or non protected thiol<br>
for reaction with sulfhydryl groups to product a reducible linkage are SPDP, SMPT, SATA,<br>
or SATP all of which are available from Pierce. Such cross linkers are merely exemplary and<br>
many alternative strategies are anticipated for linking the N-terminus of NBN with serum<br>
albumin. A skilled artisan also could generate conjugates to serum albumin that are not<br>
targeted at the N-terminus of NBN or at the thiol moiety on serum albumin. NBN-serum<br>
albumin fusions created using genetic engineering where NBN is fused to the serum albumin<br>
gene at its N-terminus, C-terminus, or at both ends, are also expected to be functional.<br>
This method can be extended through routine adaptations to any NBN-seram albumin<br>
conjugate that would result in a product with a prolonged half-life in animals and<br>
consequently in humans.<br><br><br><br>
