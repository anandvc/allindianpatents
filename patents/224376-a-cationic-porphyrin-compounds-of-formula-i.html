				<td>The present invention relates to a cationic porphyrin compounds of formula I.<br>
Field<br>
The present invention relates to compounds and uses thereof in the treatment of a medical condition for which a photodynamic compound is indicated and, in particular, in the curative or prophylactic treatment of microbial colonisation and infection.<br>
Background<br>
The resistance to antibiotics developed by an increasing number of microorganisms is recognised to be a worldwide health problem (Tunger et at., 2000, Int. J. Microb. Agents 15:131-135; Jorgensen et ah, 2000, Clin. Infect. Dis. 30:799-808). Thus, the development of non-antibiotic approaches for killing microorganisms is urgently required for controlling antibiotic-untreatable infections and limiting the development of additional antibiotic-resistant strains.<br>
The treatment of microbial infections by photodynamic therapy (PDT) represents a valuable alternative method for eradicating bacteria since it involves a mechanism which is markedly different from that typical of most antibiotics. Thus, PDT is based on the use of a photo sensitising molecule that, once activated by light, generates oxygen reactive species that are toxic for a large variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells including bacteria, mycoplasmas  and yeasts  (Malik et al.,   1990, J.<br><br>
Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol 5:281-293; Bertoloni et al, 1992, Microbios 71:33-46). Importantly, the photosensitising activity of many photodynarnic agents against bacteria is not impaired by the resistance to antibiotics but, instead, depends mainly on their chemical structure (Malik et al, 1992, J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 14:262-266).<br>
Various types of neutral and anionic photosensitising agents exhibit a pronounced phototoxic activity against Gram positive bacteria. However, such photosensitising agents exert no appreciable cytotoxic activity against Gram negative bacteria unless the permeability of the outer membrane is altered by treatment with ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) or polycations (Bertoloni etal, l99Q,FEMSMicrobiol. Lett. 71: 149-156; Nitzan et al, 1992, Photochem. Photobiol. 55:89-97). It is believed that the cellular envelope of Gram negative bacteria, which is more complex and thicker than that of Gram positive bacteria, prevents an efficient binding of the photosensitising agent or intercepts and deactivates the cytotoxic reactive species photogenerated by the photosensitising agent (Ehrenberg et al, 1985, Photochem. Photobiol. 41:429-435; Valduga et al, 1993, J. Photochem. Photobiol B. Biol 21:81-86).<br>
In contrast, positively charged (cationic) photosensitising agents, including porphyrins and phmalocyanines, promote efficient inactivation of Gram negative bacteria without the need for modifying the natural structure of the cellular envelope (Merchat et al, 1996, J. Photochem. Photobiol B. Biol 32:153-157; Minnock et al, 1996, J. Photochem. Photobiol B. Biol 32:159-164). It appears that the positive charge favours the binding of the photosensitising agent at critical cellular sites that, once damaged by exposure to light, cause the loss of cell viability (Merchat et al, 1996, J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 35:149-157).<br>
Thus, it has been reported that Escherichia coif is efficiently inactivated by visible light after incubation with the cationic 5,10,15,20-tetrakis-(4-^-methylpyridyl)-porphine (T4MPyP) (Valduga et al.3 1999, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 256:84-88). The phototoxic activity of this porphyrin is mainly mediated by the impairment of the enzymic and transport functions of both the outer and cytoplasmic membranes, rather than by binding to DNA.<br>
However, the utility of known poiphyrin-based photodynaniic therapy agents is limited due to their toxicity against mammalian host tissue cells, i.e. the compounds are unable to differentiate between target microbial cells and host cells. In addition, the utility of known porphyrin-based photodynaniic therapy agents is further limited by their relatively low potency for target microbial cells.<br>
Hence, there is a need for porphyrin-based compounds with improved toxicity profiles and high potency, which can be used in PDT to preferentially kill microbial cells.<br>

The compounds of the invention are particularly suited for use in the curative or prophylactic treatment of one or more of the following indications:<br>
Impetigo<br>
Impetigo is a highly communicable infection. It is the most common infection in children.<br>
Impetigo have two classic forms nonbullous and bullous. The nonbullous impetigo, also named impetigo contagiosa accounts for approximately 70% of cases. Lesions normally resolve in 2 to 3 weeks without treatment. Impetigo also may complicate other skin diseases such as scabies, varicella, atopic dermatitis, and Darier's disease.<br>
(a) Nonbullous Impetigo Type of bacteria<br>
Nonbullous is an infection caused principally by Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes), Staphylococcus aurens, or a combination of these two organisms (see Andrews' diseases of the skin: clinical dermatology 9th ed. (2000) edited by Odom RB editor Saunders p.312-4). Non-Group A (Group B, C, and G) streptococci may be responsible for rare cases of impetigo, and Group B streptococci are associated with impetigo in the newborn.<br>
'NoiibuUous is a superficial, intraepidennal, unilocular vesiculopustular infection.<br>
Lesions of non bullous impetigo commonly begin on the skin of the face or extremities following trauma. As a rule, intact skin is resistant to impetiginazation.<br>
The clinical presentation of impetigo evolves in an orderly fashion from a small vesicle or pustule, which progresses into honey-coloured crusted plaque. Lesions usually are less than 2 cm in diameter. Lesions tend to dry, leaving fine crusts without cicatrisation. Lesions are usually minimally symptomatic. Rarely, erythema associated with mild pain or slight pruritus may be present. The infection spreads to contiguous and distal areas through the inoculation of other wound from scratching.<br>
Site of bacteria<br>
Nonbullous impetigo is a superficial streptococcal or staphylococcal infection which is localised to the subcorneal (just beneath the stratum corneum) layer of the skin (see Figure 1). More particular!}'., infection in impetigo is confined histopathogically to highly differentiated, upper epidermal keratinocytes. Once the bacteria invade a break in the sldn, they begin to multiply.<br>
The histopathology is that of an extremely superficial inflammation about the funnel-shaped upper portion of the pilosebaceous follicles. A subcorneal vesicopustule is formed, containing a few scattered cocci, together with debris of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and epidermal<br>
cells. In the dermis. there is a mild inflammatory reaction - vascular dilatation, oedema, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (Andrews' diseases of the skin, supra.,p.312-4).<br>
(b) Bullous impetigo Type of bacteria<br>
Bullous impetigo is caused primarily by strains of Staphylococcus aureus which produce exfoliative toxins (Sadick et al., 1997, Dermatologic Clinics 15(2): 341-9).<br>
Type of'wounds<br>
Bullous impetigo is Mstologically characterised by subcorneal cleavage and infiltrate with polymorphonuclear leucocytes migrating through the epidermis and accumulating between granular and stratum corneum skin layers. Small or large superficial fragile bullae are present on the trunk and extremities.<br>
Flaccid bullae and moist erosions with surrounding erythema are characteristic of this subcorneal infections. Often, only the remnants of ruptured bullae are seen at the time of presentation. The separation of the epidermis is due to an exotoxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Sites of bacteria<br>
Bullous impetigo is a superficial staphylococcal infection that occurs in and just beneath the stratum corneum (see figure 1). Bullous impetigo is<br>
considered due 10 exfoliaiive toxin produced by some Staphylococcus aureus attached to stratum comeum cell-.<br>
Atopic dermatitis (AD)<br>
Atopic dermatitis, also named atopic eczema, is a chronic inflammation of the skin resulting in an itchy rash, especially in the flexures i.e. behind the knees, in front of the elbows, wrists, neck, and eyelids. Infection of the rash is common, and causes further inflammation and itch.<br>
Eczema typically manifests in those aged 1-6 months. Approximately 60% of patients have their first outbreak by 1 year and 90% by 5 years. Onset of atopic dermatitis in adolescence or later is uncommon and should prompt consideration of another diagnosis. Disease manifestations vary with age.<br>
Type of bacteria<br>
Bacteria and their superantigens contribute to the pathogenesis of AD.<br>
Staphylococcus aureus colonises the skin of 90% of AD patients (chronic eczematous lesions) and only 5% of non-atopic patients. The colonisation density of Staphylococcus aureus can reach up to 107 colony<br>
rforming units cm" without clinical signs of infection in patients with AD. In addition, the apparently normal non-lesional skin of atopic patients contains increased numbers of Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
The reason for the overgrowth of Staphylococcus aureus in atopic dermatitis, though much less severely or not at all in diseases such as psoriasis, is not known. Protein A elicits a much less vigorous response<br>
in atopies than in normals or psoriatics, but this may be the result rather than a cause of colonisation. Attention has recently turned to the skin lipids and there is some evidence that fatty acids which may control staphylococcal colonisation are deficient in atopies.<br>
Superantigens are a unique group of proteins produced by bacteria and viruses  that  bypass   certain  elements   of the conventional,  antigen-mediated immune sequence.  Whereas conventional antigens activate approximately 0.01% to 0.1% of the body's T cells, a superantigen has the ability to stimulate 5% to 30% of the T-cell population.  S. aureus may exacerbate or maintain skin inflammation in AD by secreting a group of exotoxins that act as superantigens. AD patients possess an altered skin barrier secondary to an insufficiency of ceramides within the stratum corneum. It has been proposed that penetration of the skin by these exotoxins may cause activation of T cells, macrophages, LCs, and mast cells, thereby leading to the release of cytokines and mast cell mediators. It is conceivable that these events may provide the basis for inflammation in chronic AD. Speculation remains whether S. aureus colonisation and local superantigen secretion is a primary or secondary phenomenon in AD (Andrews' diseases of skin, Chap, 5, Atopic Dermatitis, Eczema, and non-infectious immunodeficiency disorders, p.69-76).<br>
Cutaneous viral, fungal, and bacterial infections occur more commonly in AD patients. Viral infections are consistent with a T cell defect and include herpes simplex (local or generalised, i.e. eczema herpeticum), molluscum contagiosum, and human papilloma virus. Superficial fungal infections with Trichophyton rubrum and Pityrosporon ovale also occur frequently. Bacterial infections, specifically those with S, aureus, are extremely common. Superinfection results in honey-coloured crusting, extensive serous weeping or folliculitis.<br>
Type of wounds<br>
Acute lesions appear as erymematous papules, vesicles, and erosions; chronic disease consists of fibrotic papules and thickened, lichenified skin.<br>
A finding of increasing numbers of pathogenic staphylococci is frequently associated with weeping, crusting, folliculitis and adenopathy. Secondary staphylococcal infection is frequent and local oedema and regional adenopatliy commonly occur during atopic dermatitis. Impetigo can be a sort of secondary infection of atopic dermatitis.<br>
The histology of atopic dermatitis ranges from acute spongiotic dermatitis to lichen simplex chronicus, depending on the morphology of the skin lesion biopsied.<br>
Sites of bacteria<br>
Staphylococcus   aureus   cell  walls   exhibit   receptors,   the   so-called adhesins, for epidermal and dermal fibronectin and fibrinogen.   It has been  demonstrated that the binding  of Staphylococcus  aureus was mediated by fibrinogen and fibronectin in AD patients.   As the skin of AD patients lacks an intact stratum corneum, dermal fibronectin might be uncovered and increase the adherence of Staphylococcus aureus. Fibrillar and amorphous structures have been traced between Staphylococcus aureus cells and corneocytes and may results in a bacterial biofilm. It has been observed that Staphylococcus aureus penetrates into intracellular spaces suggesting that the skin surface lipids are deteriorated in AD<br>
patients (see Breuer K et aL, 2002, British Journal of Dermatology 147: 55-61) .<br>
Ulcers<br>
Skin ulcers, such as diabetic foot ulcers, pressure ulcers, and chronic venous ulcers, are open sores or lesions of the skin characterised by the wasting away of tissue and sometimes accompanied by formation of pus. Skin ulcers may have different causes, and affect different populations, but they all tend to heal very slowly, if at all, and can be quite difficult and expensive to treat.<br>
Type of bacteria<br>
Superficial pressure ulcers are not associated with major infection problems. Aerobic microorganisms at low levels will contaminate pressure ulcers, but will not impede timely healing. However, deep full-thickness pressure ulcers can become secondarily infected, and osteomyelitis can occur. Those pressure ulcers with necrotic tissue contain high levels of aerobic and anaerobic microorganisms as compared to non-necrotic ulcers; foul smell is usually present when anaerobes invade the tissues. Thus, a treatment strategy is to clear necrotic tissue from the wound, producing a decrease in anaerobe presence.<br>
The infections of pressure ulcers are typically polymicrobial and can contain Streptococcus pyogenes, enterococci, anaerobic streptococci, Enterobacteriaece, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis and Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Type of wounds<br>
Stage I pressure ulcer: Nonblanchable erythema of intact skin, considered to "be heralding lesion of skin ulceration.<br>
Stage IT pressure ulcer: Partial thickness skin loss involving the epidermis and/or dermis. The ulcer is superficial and presents clinically as an abrasion, blister, or shallow crater. Because the epidermis may be interrupted by an abrasion, blister, or shallow crater, the ulcer should be evaluated for signs of secondary infections.<br>
Stage III: Full thickness skin loss involving damage or necrosis of subcutaneous tissue which may extend down to, but not through, underlying fascia. The ulcer presents clinically as a deep crater with or without undermining of adjacent tissue.<br>
Stage IV: Full thickness skin loss with extensive destruction, tissue necrosis, or damage to muscle, bone, or supporting structures, such as tendons or joint capsules.<br>
Sites of bacteria<br>
There are three microbiological states that are possible in a wound: contamination, colonisation and infection. Contamination is characterised as the simple presence of microorganisms in the wound but without proliferation. It is generally accepted that all wounds, regardless of aetiology, are contaminated. Colonisation is characterised as the presence and proliferation of microorganisms in the wound but without host reaction. Colonisation is a common condition in chronic wounds such as venous ulcers and pressure ulcers and does not necessarily delay the<br>
healing process. -When bacteria invade healthy tissues and continue to proliferate to the extent that their presence and by-products elicit or overwhelm the host immune response, this microbial state is known as infection. The classic signs and symptoms of infection include local redness, pain and swelling, fever and changes in the amount and character of wound exudates.<br>
Lung infections<br>
The compounds of the invention are also suitable for treating a patient having an infectious disease of the lung, by administering to the subject a compound of the invention and irradiating (i.e. illuminating) the lung with light having a wavelength that causes the compound to produce an anti-microbial effect. Lung infection can occur with a variety of bacterial genera    and   species,    which   include   Mycobacterium    tuberculosis (tuberculosis), Pseudomonas (primary cause of death of cystic fibrosis patients),    Streptococcus,    Staphylococcus   pneumoniae,    Klebsiella, Toxoplasma, etc.   Lung infection can also occur with a variety of virus strains and opportunistic pathogens (fungi, parasites).   As pathogens of the  lung are  increasingly resistant to  classical antibiotic therapies, photodynamic therapy offers an alternative method for eliminating these hamiful organisms.<br>
The compound of the invention can be administered to the lung in a variety of ways. For example the compound can be administered b}' the respiratory tract (i.e. intra-tracheally, intra-broncliially, or intra-alveolarly) or through the body wall of the chest. The light source can be applied through these routes as well with the help of flexible fibre optics for example. The illumination/irradiation can be directed to the base of the lung, to the apex of the lung, or both.<br>
Further indications<br>
The compounds of the invention are also suitable for the curative and/or prophylactic treatment of the following:<br>
Infections of burn sites and slcin grafts; otitis (ear infection), bacterial conjunctivitis and other eye infections, periodontitis and other dental infections, and infected bones exposed during surgical procedures.<br>
Thus, further aspects of the invention provide the following:<br>
(i)    Use of a compound of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for use in photodynamic therapy;<br>
(ii) Use of a compound of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for lolling and/or preventing growth of microorganisms, such as bacteria, yeasts, fungi and viruses (for example, the medicament may be used to prevent or reduce the spread or transfer of that pathogen to other subjects, e.g. patients, healthcare workers, etc.};<br>
(ill) Use of a compound of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the curative and/or prophylactic treatment of a dermatological infection;<br>
(iv) Use of a compound of the invention hi the preparation of a medicament for the curative and/or prophylactic treatment of an infection of the lungs;<br>
(v) Use of a compound of the invention in the preparation of a medicament for the curative and/or prophylactic treatment of a wound infection and/or an ulcer;<br>
(vi) A method for treating a patient in need of treatment with a photodynamic therapy agent comprising administering to the patient a compound of the invention and illuminating/irradiating the compound; and<br>
(vii) A method for preventing wound infection comprising contacting the wound with a compound of the invention and illuminating/irradiating the compound (such that a reactive oxygen species is generated).<br>
In use, the photosensitive compounds of the invention are illuimnated/irradiated, i.e. activated, using conventional techniques known in the field of photodynamic therapy. Preferably, the compounds are illuminated/irradiated at a wavelength of between 400 nm and 800 nm. More preferably, the compounds are illuminated/irradiated at a wavelength corresponding to one or more of the absorption windows for porpliyrin, which lie at around 417 run (Soret band), 485 nm, 515nm,<br>
550 nm,  590 nm and 650 nm.    Most preferably, the compounds are illuminated/irradiated at a wavelength of about 417 inn.<br>
The optimal wavelength will depend on the particular compound and the indication for which is being used. For example, for impetigo, a wavelength of 510 to 560 nm is preferred due to the lesion colour. For open wounds, a wavelength of 560 to 700 is preferred, with preference towards the higher wavelength, in order to minimise activation of haemoglobin (mininium at 690 nm).<br>
It will be appreciated by persons skilled in the art that illumination/ irradiation may take place at various time points after application of the compound of the invention. Typically, the compound is illuminated/ irradiated between 5 minutes and 24 hours after application, for example, between 5 minutes and 2 hours or between 10 minutes and 1 hour. Optimal illumination times may be determined by experimentation.<br>
Where the compound of the invention is applied to the skin, the wavelength of light can be selected so as to control the depth of penetration. For example, for deep penetration longer wavelengths are preferred. Light intensity and overall light dose may also be varied to control the depth of penetration.<br>
Preferably, the photo dynamic therapy agent only penetrates the stratum cornewn.<br>
Likewise, the optimal duration of the exposure of the compound to illumination/radiation will depend on the particular compound and the indication for which is being used. Typically, however, the illumination<br>
time is between 1 and 30 minutes, more preferably between 5'and 20 minutes, for example 10 minutes.<br>
The total amount of illumination/radiation will vary according to the treatment and localisation of the tissues to be treated. Generally, the amount of illumination/radiation is between 10 and 1000 J/crn2, preferably between 10 and 350 J/cm2.<br>
Suitable light sources include the PDT 450L, PDT 650L and PDT 1200 lamps from Waldrnann AG, Germany. Alternatively, white light may be used for compound activation.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be used to kill microorganisms in vitro. Thus, a further aspect of the invention provides a sterilising solution comprising a compound according to the first and/or second aspects of the invention. The solution may also take the form of a handwash or a concentrate to be diluted prior to use.<br>
Preferably, the compound of the invention is present in solution at a concentration of 1 to 100 (j.g/ml.<br>
Preferably, the solution further comprises a surface-active agent or surfactant. Suitable surfactants include anionic surfactants (e.g. an aliphatic sulphonate), amphoteric and/or zwitterionic surfactants (e.g. derivatives of aliphatic quaternary ammonium., phosphonium and sulfonium compounds) and nonionic surfactants (e.g. aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides)<br>
Conveniently, the surface-active agent is present at a concentration of 0.5 to 5 weight percent.<br>
The sterilising solutions of the invention are particularly suited for use in hospital environments. For example, the sterilising solutions may he used to sterilise surgical instruments and surgical theatre surfaces, as well as the hands and gloves of theatre personnel. In addition, the sterilising solutions may he used during surgery, for example to sterilise exposed bones. In all cases, the solution is applied to the surface to be sterilised and then illuminated/irradiated so as to produce a reactive oxygen species (see above)<br>
Thus, a further aspect of the invention provides a method for killing microorganisms in vitro comprising contacting the microorganisms to be killed with a compound of the invention and illuminating/irradiating the compound.<br>

PHOTODYNAMIC ACTIVITY (LIGHT TOXICITY) PROFILES OF EXEMPLARY COMPOUNDS ON BACTERIAL CELLS<br>
Methodology<br>
The toxic effects of exemplary compounds of the invention against two bacterial strains, the Gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli (strain ATCC 25922) and the Gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-resistant strain ATCCBAA-44), were evaluated by measuring the extent of growth inhibition (bacteriostatic effect) and growth inhibition (cytocidal effect) in the dark and upon light exposure. Initial compound screening was undertaken using white light [390 -<br>
n<br>
740nm] (150 mW/cm ) for various timepoints at a concentration of 3uM (see Table 1). Further experiments were undertaken on those compounds identified from this initial screen using a light source emitting light at a wavelength between 417 - 420 nm at 15.2 niW/cm2, 13.68 J/cm2 (Waldmann Eclairage SA, France) (see Table 2).<br>
The following protocol was used for the initial screening of the exemplary compounds (Table 1) (see Reddi et al., 2002, Photochem. Photobiol. 75(5):462-470):<br>
(i) E. coli and S. aureus cells were grown overnight on brain heart infusion agar, resuspended in brain heart infusion broth, harvested by centrifugation (3000 g for 15 minutes) and washed once with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 containing 2.7 mM KC1 and0.14MNaCl.<br>
(ii)   The cells were then resuspended in PBS to an optical density at<br>
r\	q<br>
650 nm of 0.7, which corresponds to a density of 10 to 10  cells/ml.<br>
(iii) Next, the cells were incubated in PBS in the dark for 5 minutes with 3.0 pM of the compound to be tested.<br>
(iv) After dark incubation, cells were illuminated with white light (wavelength: 390 to 740 nm) (150 mW/cm2) for up to 30 minutes. During illumination, the cells were kept at 37DC and magnetically stirred.<br>
(v) Finally, treated and untreated (control) cells were diluted in brain heart infusion broth and maintained at 37°C while the absorbance of the suspension at 650 nm was monitored at predetermined time points for determining growth curves.<br>
The percent of growth inhibition in the treated cells was calculated by the following equation:<br>
[l-(Ax-A0)/(Ac-A0)]xlOO<br>
where Ax and Ac are the absorbances measured after 3 hours incubation: for the treated and control cell suspensions, respectively., and ao represents the initial absorbance.<br>
For the further investigation of the exemplary compounds (Table 2), the following protocol was adopted:<br>
(i) Bacteria (S. aiireus BAA-44 and E. coli 25922) were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth until they reached the stationary phase of growth.<br>
(ii) The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g for 15 min) with a table centrifuge, washed with 10 mM PBS at pH 7.4 containing 2.7 niM KC1 and 0.14 M NaCl and suspended in PBS at an optical density of 0.7 at 650 nm corresponding to 108-109 cells/ml.<br>
(iii) The bacteria, at the desired cell density (~108cells/ml) were incubated for 5 min in the dark with various concentrations of the exemplary compounds.<br>
(iv) At the end of the incubation period the cells were washed three times with PBS, suspended in PBS, transferred into a 96-well microtitre plate (200 jol/well) and illuminated for 15 min with the Waldmann light source (15.2 rnW/cm2; 13.7 J/cm2). The cells were illuminated from the bottom of tl^ ,:)&gt; • laying it on the glass cover of the lamp.<br>
(v) After illumination, cell survival was determined by plating serially diluted aliquots of treated and untreated (i.e. no exemplary compound or light present) cells onto brain heart agar (BHA) and counting the number of colonies after 18-24 h incubation at 37°C.<br>

Conclusions<br>
The results demonstrate that the compounds of the invention, when illuminated with light, are capable of killing both gram positive and gram negative bacterial cells at the low concentrations investigated.<br>
Activity of Compound 10 at low doses<br>
The above colony forming unit (CPU) protocol was also used to investigate the photodynamic activity of very low concentrations of the compounds of the invention. For example, figure 4 demonstrates the results obtained using (A) Compound 8 and (B) Compound 10 in the presence (photodynamic properties) and in the absence (inherent toxicity properties) of light.<br>
Results<br>
(i) Compounds 8 and 10 both exhibited negligible dark toxicity against BAA-44 at the concentrations tested.<br>
(ii) Compound 8 exhibited a potent antibacterial effect at concentrations as low as 0.01 uM, where a 3 log reduction in BAA-44 was achieved.<br>
(iii)  Compound 10 exhibited an even more potent antibacterial effect, causing a 3 log reduction in BAA-44 at a concentration of 0.005 and capable of killing 90% of the bacteria at a 0.0025 concentration.<br>
Conclusions<br>
Compounds 8 and 10 exhibit a dose-dependent and light-dependent toxicity against bacterial cells, even at very low doses.<br>

Photodynamic activity of Compound 10 against MRS A on ex vivo porcine skin<br>
Excised porcine skin was cut into 3(4) x 3(4) cm2 pieces under sterile conditions and incubated in 70% ethanol for 5 minutes to reduce background of colonised bacteria. After three washing steps in PBS, the skin pieces were fixed in petri dishes with Hepes-Agar. The epidermis (stratum corneum) was then inoculated with S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 (~10S, Volume: lOOul) and the skin surface dried under laminar flow cabinet until visible dry. The regions of interest were determined using a "pap" pen (1 cm2 diameter). A sterile solution of Compound 10 (10 fiM) was applied onto the skin for 10 minutes. Post application, the ex vivo porcine skin was placed under the Waldmann light source 236 and<br>

illuminated for 15 min (15.2 mW/cm , 13.7 J/cm ). A colony forming unit assay was performed to determine viable bacterial cell number immediately after irradiation using a sterile cotton rod to remove bacteria from the stratum corneum. The sterile cotton rod was moistened in sampling solution (0.1% TweenSO in 0.0075 M phosphate buffer pH 7.9) before swabbing the skin surface (3 times) and vortexed in sampling solution before undertaking serial dilutions to determine the bacterial recovery.<br>
Incubation with Compound   10  (10   uM)  followed by  15  minutes irradiation resulted in a 3.2 Iog10 growth reduction (mean value of three<br>
target areas). In contrast, control experiments (irradiation of applied bacteria without Compound 10 incubation) did not show a decrease of bacteria cell number.<br>
Thus, these data demonstrate photodynamic activity of Compound 10 against MRS A on the surface of porcine skin, even in the presence of skin lipids and enzymes.<br>
Confirmation of photodynamic properties using sodium azide andD2O<br>
Quenching studies using D20 and azide were performed with Compound 10 and light against keratinocytes in vitro. In order to investigate whether phototoxicity of the test compound against NHDF, NHEK and bacteria follows the photo-oxidation type II, sodium azide, a physical quencher of singlet oxygen as well as D20, an enhancer of reactive oxygen species were used (Lin et al., 1991, Cancer .Res. 51:1109-1116; Moan et al, 1979, Brit. J. Cancer 39:398-407).<br>
Figure 5 shows the effect of incubation with Compound 10 and quencher or Compound 10 and D20 after illumination. Cell killing by Compound 10 was reduced in the presence of sodium azide, as indicated by an increase of the cell viability, whereas the addition of D2O revealed a dramatic decrease of cell viability.<br>
In conclusion, the killing of NHDF by Compound 10 with illumination appears to be mediated mainly by singlet oxygen and not by the compound itself.<br>
Acifte'toxicity testing of Compound 10<br>
Compound 10 was used at a million times antibacterial dose (3.2 mM) in a topical formulation in a standard acute toxicity test to determine if any clinical or histological toxicity for the compound could be detected. The compound was applied to both intact and abraded rat skin for 24 hours.<br>
The acute toxicity protocol was based on OECD Guidelines for the testing of chemicals /Section 4. - Health Effects Test Number 402: Acute Dermal Toxicity.<br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
After clinical, macroscopic and microscopic observation, no clinical toxicology was observed. No histological toxicology of any major organ (including the skin) was observed. No cell infiltrates, including mast cells, were noted, neither was irritancy.<br>
In conclusion, Compound 10 does not result in any acute toxic or allergic effect: in fact, no significant clinical or pathological signs related to the substance and its vehicle application were observed.<br>
Photo-toxicity testing of Compound 10<br>
The photo-toxicity protocol was based on OECD Guidelines for the testing of chemicals /Section 4 Health Effects - Test Number 406: Skin sensitisation.<br>
Preliminary experiments determined that a light exposure of 30 minutes did not result in any damage to the surface of the skin caused by the light<br>
source. Similarly, control experiments demonstrated that Compound 10 when applied at a concentration of 32 (iM in the absence of light did not result in any damage to the surface of the skin. The photo-toxicity of the Compound 10 in the topical formulation was studied when applied onto 14 Guinea Pig skin (intact and abraded) for 24 hours, followed by a 30 minute light exposure. Compound 10 was tested at two different concentrations 32 uM and 0.32 uM. Clinical and histological examination of the skin test sites was conducted at 24 and 72 hours post illumination in classical photo-toxicity testing fashion. Biopsies were not done from contiguous sites to prevent any interaction in case of suture.    Gross findings were evaluated at the moment of the biopsy.   Before giving a score to each endpoint (erythema, oedema and rnflamrnation), data for each subject were compared to the data from the other animals and to control data.   A score from 0 to 4 was given for each site and for each endpoint according to the Draize Scale (for inflammation, a scale similar to the Draize Scale was created after microscopic observation of all skin sections, comparing with normal skin and with findings of step-1).   A mean score was then calculated for each animal and for each sampling point.<br>
On analysing the results and comparing the experimental data with the data from the control animals, it was concluded that there were no clinical signs or symptoms or histological findings that suggested any photo-toxic potential of Compound 10.<br>

WITH BACTERIAL CELLS<br>
Binding of Compounds 8,10 and 12 with E. coli<br>
E. coli cells were incubated for 5 rain with. Compound 8, 10 or 12 at various concentrations (1-7.5 pM). At the end of the incubation period, the cells were sedimented by centrifugation. to remove the fraction of unbound test compound and the cell pellet was resuspended in 2 nil of 2% SDS to obtain cell lysates. After overnight incubation with SDS, the amount of cell-bound test compound was estimated by spectrofiuorimetric analysis of the cell lysates. The concentration of the compounds in the cell lysates was calculated by measuring the intensities at the maximum of the emission fluorescence spectrum and interpolating the data on a calibration plot. The amount of cell-bound test compound was expressed as nmoles of compound per mg of cell protein. The protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry (Lowry et al, 1951, J. Biol Chem. 193:265-275).<br>
All experiments were run in triplicate and the results represent the average of 3 determinations with standard deviations.<br>
The amount of porphyrin recovered from the cells is shown in Table 4.<br>
Table 4<br><br>
(Table Remove)The results shown in Table 4 show that the three test compounds bind to E. coli with similar efficiency and that about 50% of the compound that is associated to the cells at the end of the incubation period (5 min) is removed by 3 washings with PBS.<br>
example D: testing of exemplary compounds for emergence<br>
OF BACTERIAL RESISTANCE TO PDT<br>
The potential build up of resistance of the bacterial cells to the exemplary compounds of the invention was  tested in the multi-drug resistant (including methicillin) gram positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus BAA-44, using Compound 10 as the photodynamic agent. The survival of S. aureus BAA-44 after the second treatment was again compared to the survival of S. aureus BAA-44 cells that had not been treated with PDT, The same treatment was repeated for a total of 10 times in order to assess if the sensitivity of S. aureus BAA-44 cells to PDT remained constant or whether   some  resistance   was   observed  to  develop   after  repeated treatments. In an additional experiment, clones which had been exposed nine times to PDT treatment by the above methodology were treated for a tenth time and the results compared to the cell kill observed in a parallel experiment where naive cultures (i.e. which had not been exposed to PDT)   were   subjected   to   PDT  treatment  under  exactly  the   same conditions. The results obtained after 10 subsequent PDT treatments are shown in Figure 6.<br>
The results obtained from comparing cell kill obtained from cultures that had been exposed to 10 consecutive PDT treatments with na'ive cultures (i.e. winch had not been exposed to PDT) are shown in Figure 7. The survival was expressed as log No/N, where no and N represent the number of CFU/ml of the untreated and treated cell suspensions. Statistical analysis by T test demonstrated that the differences between the 2 values were not significant (P &gt; 10%):<br>
Conclusions<br>
The photosensitization of S. aureus ATCC BAA-44 by Compound 10 induced no appreciable development of resistance. In fact, the efficiency of photodynamic activity of Compound 10 remained unchanged in ten subsequentphotodynamic sequence sessions, even though bacterial cells, which were exposed in the previous treatments, were cultivated and re-exposed to Compound 10 and light. Therefore, treatment of bacteria using Compound 10 in a photodynamic fashion is further enhanced by the apparent lack of induction of bacterial resistance, unlike antibiotic therapies, where multi-drug resistance is a significant issue.<br>

COMPOUNDS FOR BACTERIA Methodology<br>
Test compounds were screened for toxicity against cultured human skin cells using normal human epidennal Iceratinocytes (NHEK) and normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF), purchased from CellSystems Biotechnologie GmbH, Germany.<br>
The NHEK and NHDF cells were used between passages 3 and 10. The cells were seeded with 7.5 and/or 15 x 104 cells/ well (microtitreplate) and were allowed to attach overnight in an incubator (37°C, 5% CO2). After incubation with different concentrations of the selected photosensitisers, the cells were illuminated for fifteen minutes (Light source 236, Waldmann; 15.2 mW/cm2, 13.7 J/cm2) and then incubated for 24 hours in the dark.<br>
Phototoxicity was tested by standard MTT-assay (Mossman et al, 1983, Immunological Methods 65:55-63). MTT is an indicator of metabolically active cells. Dependent on enzyme activity in mitochondria a colour reaction can be visualised, which can be measured by ELISA reader (540 urn). The cell viability data were normalised, i.e. the OD values of cells after PDT without photosensitisers were adjusted to one. Each experiment was repeated three times.<br>
Results<br>
Results of the toxicity studies in keratinocytes and fibroblasts are shown in Table 5.<br>

Figure 8 shows the toxicity of Compound 8 against human fibroblasts and S. aureus BAA-44 at varying doses.<br>
Conclusions<br>
The above data demonstrate that compounds of the invention, for example Compound 8 (at a dose of 0.01 uM), Compound 12 (at a dose of<br>
0.1 uM) and Compound 10 (at a dose of 0.01 uM), are preferentially toxic to bacterial cells compared to human skin cells.<br>
In contrast, reference Compound 1 exhibits equal toxicity to "bacterial and human cells.<br>
example F: stability studies Methodology<br>
A "bespoke light source capable of delivering light of an appropriate wavelength (417 nm) was developed to activate the test compounds (Waldmaira light source 236). The light source has a light intensity of 15 mW/crn2 after 3 minutes at room temperature (25 °C), yielding a light dose of 14 J/cm2. It consists of a light box (493mm length x 278mm width x 93.3 mm height) where the samples to be tested are placed on the top surface of the light box and illuminated from below.<br>
Photostability of Compound 10<br>
The photostability of the exemplary compounds was investigated using standard photodynamic procedures. A 10 uM solution of Compound 10 was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline/ethanol, as described above, and illuminated with blue light (15 mW/crn2} using a light source with an absofbance maximum of 417 nm. The solution was illuminated for various periods:   10, 20 and 30 minutes.  After each predetermined illumination period, the absorbance at 404 run corresponding to the maximum absorption peak of the compound was measured. Parallel experiments were undertaken where the absorbance of Compound 10<br>
solutions that had been kept in the dark for the same time periods as the. illumination time periods were measured. Over the 30 minutes period of illumination a small loss in the absorbance value at 404 rim was observed (see Figure 10 A).<br>
The susceptibility of the Compound 10 to photobleaching when subjected to a light at a higher fhience rate (150 mW/cm"; i.e. ten times that used normally) was investigated. With this illumination system, the solution was kept in a quartz cuvette during illumination while an equivalent solution was kept in the dark. The reduction of absorbance caused by photobleaching was found to be approximately 15-20 % at a concentration of 10 uM after 30 minutes illumination (see Figure 10B).<br>
The above results indicate that Compound 10 undergoes photobleaching much less than other porphyrins known in the literature (for example, see Reddi et al, 2002, Photochem. Photobiol. 75:462-470).<br>
Chemical stability<br>
The following HPLC methodology was established for the analysis of the exemplary compounds of the invention.<br>
The method involves detection by UV at a wavelength of 420 nm, which is very specific for these compounds. In order to monitor impurities not related to the porphyrin structure (and therefore not absorbing at 420 nm.) UV spectra of the whole chromatograms were also recorded between 200 nm and 700 nm by DAD (diode array detector) in certain experiments.<br>

Typical retention time of the exemplary compounds was approximately 8 minutes (18 minute runtime).<br>
Qualitative stress tests were undertaken on the exemplary compounds of the invention.  Analysis  was undertaken by HPLC &amp; LC-MS. The compounds were stress tested in solid form, in an aqueous solution and a solution made up in phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The samples were initialty incubated for 7 days at 50 °C and a sample removed for testing. The samples were then incubated for a further 7 da)'s at 70 °C, samples removed as before and the samples incubated further for 7 days at 90 °C. HPLC   analysis   of freshly prepared  solutions   was  undertaken  and compared to the samples after 7, 14 and 21 days incubation. A visual comparison of the chromatograms was then undertaken and the content of the main products and by-products as area percentage values determined (see Figure 11).<br>
The 3D plots of the chromatograms show no indications for additional formation of fragments (no signals at lower wavelengths)<br>
The plot in Figure 12 shows the sample after 21 days in PBS buffer, which showed the largest degradation effect. The results demonstrated minimal degradation on analysis of solid drug and drug in solution heated to 80°C for a number of weeks.<br>
Conclusions<br>
Compounds 10 and 12 were both found to exhibit good stability and were very stable even under the stressed conditions of the test protocol. Although Compound 8 was less stable than Compounds 10 and 12, the stability demonstrated was found to be sufficient for practical use.<br>
Stability of exemplcny compounds in formulations<br>
The stability of three exemplary compounds of the invention (Compounds 8, 10 and 12) and one reference compound (Compound 1), stored at 40°C in the dark over 8 weeks in polyethylene vials in various aqueous-based formulations, was evaluated as follows:<br>
Sodium laureth sulphate (SLES) + water<br>
9:1 water rethanol<br>
SLES+ 9:1 water: ethanol<br>
UV spectra were recorded over the range 350-700 mn over a period of 7 weeks and a visual evaluation of the samples made at 8 weeks.<br>
The results indicate that all compounds tested exhibited good stability over an eight-week period (see Figure 13).<br>
For Compounds 8 and 10, the stability study was extended to 17 weeks (see Figure 14).<br>
example G: distribution studies<br>
Human skin distribution<br>
Human skin (intact) in Franz cell system was used to examine the distribution of Compounds 10 and 12 within skin compartments after 22 hours incubation at high concentration. Three separate experiments, each using one skin sample (from the same donor) was undertaken per formulation. 250ul of each formulation was applied under occlusion and removed after 22 hours. Skin was separated and the compound content in stratum comeum, epidermis and dermis, and receiver solution determined using HPLC.<br>
The following HPLC methodology was established for the analysis of the exemplary compounds of the invention:<br>
HPLC system details: TSP SCM1000 membrane degasser, P4000 quaternary pump, AS3000 autosampler, UV6000LP UV/Vis PDA detector, SN4000 controller, PC1000 Ver. 3.5.1 software. Zorbax SB-Phenyl, 5 jim, 250 x 4.6 mm column plus a Phenyl security guard cartridge (Phenomenex). Mobile phase: 550 mL water; 450 mL tetrahydroruran; 1.5 g sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1 mL formic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/rnin. Injection volume was 50 uL (foil loop injection) and operating temperature was 25°C. Detector was set at a wavelength of 409 mn plus UV/Vis scan (240-752 nm, step 4 run). Typical retention time of the exemplary compounds was approximately 8 minutes (18 minute runtime).<br>
The majority of the compounds associated with the skin were found to reside in stratum comeum. Low concentrations were detected in the epidermis (approx. 0.01 uM) - i.e. potentially anti-bacterial<br>
concentration. Lower concentrations were detected in the dermis (approx. 0.002 p.M). Compounds were not detected in the receiver solution<br>
The key findings are as follows:<br>
(i)    The vast majority of Compound 10 was recovered from the surface<br>
of the stratum corneum. (ii)   Much   lower,   yet   potentially   antibacterial,   concentrations    of<br>
Compound 10 were recovered within the stratum corneum. (iii)  In   the   absence   of  ethanol,   sub-therapeutic   concentrations   of<br>
Compound 10 were found in the epidermis and dermis. (iv)   In the presence of ethanol, higher concentrations of Compound 10<br>
were found in the epidermis, (v)   No formulation led to a potentially antibacterial concentration of<br>
Compound 10 reaching the dermis.<br>
(vi) The formulations containing SLES were the only ones in which Compound 10 was detected at very low concentration in the receptor phase.<br>
(vii) Compound 10 distribution in the skin can, to a certain degree, be manipulated by the formulation used.<br>
Human Skin Cell Distribution: imaging studies<br>
The sub-cellular distribution of the dyes in human dermal fibroblasts -(NHDF) and human dermal keratinocytes (NHEK) has been investigated. NHDF were grown on microscope slides overnight and the cells were then incubated with Compound 10 for 5 minutes, 1 and 4 hours alone or incubated cells were co-stained with organelle-specific dyes. For labelling of lysosomes and mitochondria LysoTrackerGreen (Molecular Probes) and Rhodamine G6 (Sigma) were used, respectively. Immediately after incubation   sub-cellular  localisation  was   examined  b}'   fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Vario AxioTech. Germany) using an appropriate dual band filter set (Omega Optical) for excitation and emission. Using a<br>
suitable software application, it is possible to overlay digital photographs (fluorescence) onto light microscopy photographs transparently. Therefore distribution of the dyes can be localized by one image. In addition, overlay of several digital photographs using different colour-images is also possible.<br>
NHDF cells were grown overnight on microscope slides. After that, the cells were incubated with 1 uM Compound 10 (green fluorescence) for 1 hour and co-stained with (A) organelle-specific dyes for mitochondria (Rhodamine G6; 50 ng/ml, 5 minutes; red fluorescence) and nucleus (Hoechst 33342; blue fluorescence) or (B) organelle-specific dyes for lysosomes (LysoTrackerGreen; 10 jiM, 2 h; green fluorescence) and nucleus (Hoechst 33342; blue fluorescence). Sub-cellular localisation was examined by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Vario AxioTech, Germany) using an appropriate dual band filter set (Omega Optical) for excitation and emission. Co-localisation is merged in yellow fluorescence.<br>
Staining of (A) lysosymes and (B) mitochondria without co-staining is shown in Figure 15.<br>
Figure 16 shows the intracellular fluorescence distribution of NHDF cells incubated with 1 uM Compound 10 for 1 hour.<br>
The Compound 10 fluorescence is localised extra-nuclearly and co-staining with mitochondria-specific Rhodamine G6 resulted in co-localisation of Compound 10 (green) and fluorescence of mitochondria (red). Co-localisation is merged in yellow fluorescence (Figure 16).<br>
Co-staining with lysosomal-specific dye (LysoTrackerGreen) resulted in different localization of Compound 10 (red) and lysosomal fluorescence (green) (Figure 16).<br>
Conclusions<br>
No nuclear association of Compound 10 was observed in nuclear material in these studied which may indicate that there is a low possibility of compound activity against DNA.<br><br><br>
