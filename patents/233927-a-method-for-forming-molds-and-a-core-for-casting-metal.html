Title<br>
A method for forming molds and a core for casting metal<br>
Field of the Inventions<br>
[0001] The present inventions are related to a method for forming molds by which little<br>
gas with discomforting odors and bad effects on human bodies is generated while<br>
binders are heated when materials for forming molds that include binders are formed<br>
and when melted metal is poured using a core for casting formed of materials for<br>
forming molds that include binders, and to a core for casting metal produced by the<br>
method for forming molds. Further, the present inventions are related to an aggregate<br>
material mixture for forming molds using the method for forming molds of the<br>
inventions.<br>
Background of the Inventions<br>
[0002] Phenol resins are used as caking additives in Example 1 of the method for<br>
forming molds shown in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent Early-publication<br>
(Kokai) No. Hei. 05-32148, and volatile gases such as formaldehyde, phenol and<br>
ammonia are generated when binders are cured by the heat of formed dies. The<br>
gases generated cause discomforting odors and have bad effects on human bodies.<br>
Or water glasses are used as in Example 2, and it is not preferable that molds after<br>
casting become refuse, because they cannot be recycled.<br>
[0003] Also, a so-called forming method for shell molds, in which sand coated with<br>
binders is blown and filled in heated dies for forming and the filled binders coated<br>
with sand are cured by the heat of the dies, is disclosed in the Official Gazette of<br>
Japanese Patent Early-publication {Kokai) No. Hei. 10-193033.<br>
[0004] Volatile gases such as formaldehyde, phenol, and ammonia are generated when<br><br>
binders are cured by the heat of the dies in the method for forming shown in the<br>
references of the patent. The gases generated cause discomforting odors and have<br>
bad effects on human bodies. Also, when these dies are used for casting, for example,<br>
aluminum alloys and resin binders are not fully volatilized or decomposed, because<br>
the pouring temperature into molds is about 700 °C. As a result, a core may not be<br>
easily removed from cast metal after the cast metal is cooled. Further, a water<br>
jacket core for producing aluminum castings for automobile engines is complicated<br>
in shape and is very thin. Thus, if the binders in the core are not completely baked<br>
and decomposed by the heat conduction from the poured and melted metal, it is<br>
difficult to remove the core sand from the castings.<br>
[0005] Further, as shown in the Official Gazette of Japanese Patent Early-publication<br>
(Kokai) No. Sho. 59-47043, it is not preferable that a caking additive composition<br>
using multi-functional aldehyde, glyoxal, urea, etc., as cross linking agents be used<br>
for casting, because they may generate toxic gases such as formaldehyde.<br>
[0006] Also, it is very difficult to continuously fill mixtures in a blow head into<br>
molds by the method for forming molds shown in the Official Gazette of Japanese<br>
Patent Early-publication (Kokai) No. Sho. 55-8328, because the unit particles of<br>
silica sand in the blow head aggregate to become bulky because of the method when<br>
casting sand that is combined with binders mainly composed of water and aqueous<br>
binders frozen and the frozen mixture is blow-filled into molds or during the period<br>
that lasts until the second blow-filling is done. Thus, these kinds of methods for<br>
forming molds have not been practically used.<br>
[0007] Further, when a core for casting using aqueous binders is left under a high<br>
humidity, the core may be deformed, and not maintain its shape because the<br>
aqueous binders generally absorb water and their bonds are weakened. There has<br>
been a problem in that water vapor is generated when the water component is<br>
heated and it induces bubbles when pouring metal, though the poured metal can be<br>
used for casting.<br>
[0008] Disclosure of the Inventions<br>
The present inventions were accomplished based on the above problems. First, the<br>
inventions provide a method for forming molds which generates little gas with<br>
discomforting odors or bad effects on human bodies while binders are heated when<br>
materials for forming molds, including binders, are formed and when casting metal is<br>
poured using a core for casting formed of materials for forming molds, including binders,<br>
and provide a core produced by the method for forming molds.<br>
[0009] Second, the inventions provide, the method for forming molds by which an<br>
aggregate mixture including binders and sand can be fully filled in detailed parts in a<br>
space for forming molds and a core produced by the method for forming molds.<br>
[0010] Also, third, the inventions provide a core for casting metals which can be easily<br>
removed after poured and melted metal is cooled. Namely, the inventions provide a<br>
core for casting metals in which binders are volatilized or decomposed by the heat of<br>
poured and melted metal and which can be easily removed after the poured and melted<br>
metal is cooled. When nonferrous alloys, for example, aluminum alloys, are used for<br>
the core, the pouring temperature into molds is about 700 °C and below the pouring<br>
temperature of iron - system materials, of about 1400°C.<br>
[0011] Fourth, the inventions provide a method for forming molds by which a core for<br>
casting metals formed of an aggregate material mixture that includes sand and binders<br>
can maintain its shape under high humidity and provide a core produced by this method<br>
for forming molds.<br>
[0012] Fifth, the inventions provide a core for metals such as iron - system metals,<br>
copper alloys, etc., of which the pouring temperatures are higher than those for<br>
aluminum alloys.<br>
[0013] In one embodiment, the inventions provide a method for forming molds<br>
characterized in foaming an aggregate material mixture by stirring an aggregate<br>
material mixture composed of granular aggregate materials, aqueous binders and water,<br>
filling the foamed aggregate material mixture into a space for forming molds,<br>
evaporating the water component in the aggregate material mixture, caking the<br>
aggregate material mixture, forming molds, and then taking out the formed mold from<br>
the space for forming molds.<br>
[0014] In another embodiment, the inventions provide a method for forming molds<br>
characterized in foaming an aggregate material mixture by stirring an aggregate<br>
material mixture composed of granular aggregate materials, aqueous binders, cross<br>
linking agents tnat induce a cross linking reaction with the aqueous binders and water,<br>
filling the foamed aggregate material mixture in a space for forming molds, then taking<br>
out the formed mold from the space for molding molds after evaporating the water<br>
component of the aggregate material mixture in the space for forming molds and<br>
causing a cross linking reaction with the aqueous binders and the cross linking agents.<br>
[0015] In another and further embodiment, the inventions provide a method for forming<br>
molds characterized in foaming an aggregate material mixture by stirring an aggregate<br>
material mixture composed of granular aggregate materials, aqueous binders, cross<br>
linking agents inducing a cross linking reaction with the aqueous binders and water,<br>
filling the foamed aggregate material mixture in a space for forming molds, taking out<br>
the formed mold from the space for forming molds after evaporating the water<br>
component of the aggregate material mixture in the space for forming molds, and<br>
causing a more complete cross linking reaction with the aqueous binders of the formed<br>
mold that has been taken out.<br>
[0016] Also, the inventions provide a core produced by the method for forming molds of<br>
the inventions.<br>
[0017] Further, the inventions provide an aggregate material mixture for forming molds<br>
preferable for the use in the method for forming molds of the inventions. The<br>
aggregate material mixture for forming molds is characterized in being foamed to be a<br>
whipped cream in which granular aggregate materials are equally dispersed.<br>

[Figure 3] Figure 3 shows the results of the analyses of the components of gases<br>

[0019] Preferable Embodiments for Carrying Out the Inventions<br>
The method for forming molds of the inventions is characterized in having a process of<br>
mixing granular aggregate materials, one or more kinds of aqueous binders (further<br>
adding cross linking agents according to the case) and water, a process of foaming an<br>
aggregate material mixture by stirring an aggregate material mixture, a process of<br>
filling the foamed aggregate material mixture in a space for forming molds, a process of<br>
evaporating the water component in the mixture, caking the aggregate and forming<br>
molds, a process taking out the formed mold from the space for forming molds, and<br>
according to the case a process of causing a cross linking to occur before or after the<br>
process of taking out.<br>
[0020] The granular aggregate materials in the inventions consist of more than one<br>
material chosen from silicate sand, aluminum sand, olivin sand, chromite sand, zircon<br><br>
sand, mullite sand, and various kinds of artificial aggregate materials, etc.<br>
[0021] The one or more kinds of aqueous binders in the inventions are caking additives<br>
which may be caked by evaporating the water component and contain saccharides and<br>
resins etc.<br>
[0022] Also, it is preferable to use the aqueous ones at ordinary temperature. The<br>
aqueous binders which are aqueous at ordinary temperature can be mixed without<br>
heating the aqueous binders and water when producing the aggregate material mixture<br>
with adding water. But the aqueous binders insoluble in water cannot be mixed with<br>
water without heating.<br>
[0023] However, the aqueous binders which cannot be mixed with water can also be<br>
used if they would be aqueous in the water in the situation wherein they are cooled to<br>
ordinary temperature after they are mixed with water.<br>
[0024] In the inventions, a core can be easily removed from poured and melted metal<br>
because the binders are easily volatilized and decomposed when melted metal is poured<br>
in the core produced by the method for forming molds of the inventions by using the<br>
aqueous binders.<br>
[0025] As the aqueous binders used for the inventions, one or more kinds with a<br>
saponification degree of 80 - 90 mole % of polyvinyl alcohols or their derivatives, starch<br>
or its derivatives, saponins, or saccharides, are preferable. Those of which the degree of<br>
saponification is more than 95 mole % and not more than 99 mole %, and are soluble in<br>
hot water, can also be used. Here, a saponification degree of 80 - 95 mole % of<br>
polyvinyl alcohols or their derivatives, alpha — starch, dextrin or their derivatives,<br>
saponins, or sugar, are soluble in water at ordinary temperature. Specific examples of<br>
polyvinyl alcohol derivatives are polyvinyl alcohols having acetic acid groups, carboxyl<br>
groups, lactic acid groups, silanol groups, etc. Specific examples of starch are alpha -<br>
starch and dextrin derived from potato, corn, tapioca, and wheat, etc. Specific examples<br>
of starch derivatives are etherilificated, esterificated, and cross-linked starches. The<br>
aqueous binders used for the inventions are easy to obtain, and, in particular, alpha -<br>
starch and dextrin are cheap. Also, the saccharides include poly - saccharides, di -<br>
saccharides, and mono - saccharides. In the specification the term "poly - saccharides"<br>
includes any vegetable poly - saccharides soluble in water at ordinary temperature (but,<br>
they do not include cellulose).<br>
[0026] The content of the soluble binders is preferably 0.1 - 5.0 weight parts compared<br>
to 100 weight parts of aggregate materials. Formed molds having enough strength<br>
cannot be obtained with less than 0.1 weight parts of aqueous binders. Molds obtained<br>
show excess strength with more than 5.0 weight parts of aqueous binders. Also, as the<br>
binders of the inventions, polyvinyl alcohols and saponins are superior from the point of<br>
easily foaming and starches and saccharides are superior from the point of not<br>
generating discomforting odors. So formed molds are practically done with the proper<br>
arrangement of the ratio by which they [their contents] are combined.<br>
[0027] In the method of containing cross linking agents in an aggregate material mixture,<br>
while adding more cross linking agents according to the case, and causing cross-linking<br>
of the cross linking agents and aqueous binders in the inventions, cross linking reactions are<br>
enhanced by heating the cross linking agents. Thus, the bonds between the granular<br>
aggregate materials of the aqueous binders are strengthened, the reactions between the<br>
aqueous binders and water molecules hardly occur, and molds formed of the aggregate<br>
materials can sufficiently maintain their properties even in high humidity.<br>
[0028] The cross linking agents used in the inventions are- compounds having<br>
carboxylic groups which cross-link by means of ester-bonding, such as oxalic acid,<br>
maleic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, and butanetetracarboxylic acid; ana compounds<br>
which would have carboxylic groups in an aqueous solution, such as methylvinylether-<br>
maleic anhydride copolymers and isobutylene - maleic anhydride copolymers. Also, as<br>
the cross linking agents used in the inventions, those cross linking agents that bond<br>
with ester-bonding generate little toxic gases during the formation of molds or pouring<br>
melted metal, that is, the cross linking agents having carboxyl groups are preferable.<br>
[0029] The amount of the cross linking agents added to be used in the inventions is at<br>
least 5 weight % versus aqueous binders, and preferably 5 - 300 weight %. If the<br>
amount of the cross linking agents versus aqueous binders is less than 5 weight %, the<br>
effect by the cross-linking is not enough, and the formed mold cannot maintain enough<br>
strength under high humidity. Also, if the amount of the cross linking agents versus<br>
aqueous binders is more than 300 weight %, the effect is not different from that of 300<br>
weight %, so the addition of more than an amount of 300 weight % of the cross linking<br>
agents is not economical, and is unpreferable.<br>
[0030] The cross linking agents are used as aqueous solutions in the inventions and<br>
preferably used as more than 5 weight % concentrations of aqueous solutions when, for<br>
example, butanetetracarboxylic acid, citric acid and methylvinyl ether - maleic<br>
anhydride are usecL<br>
[0031] The cross linking reaction of the inventions can be carried out either before or<br>
after taking out formed molds from a space for forming molds. When the cross linking<br>
reaction is carried out after taking out formed molds from the space for forming molds,<br>
the reaction would be done at higher temperatures for shorter times, as for example,<br>
under the atmosphere at 220°C for about 20 minutes and under the atmosphere at<br>
250 °C for about 10 minutes.<br>
[0032] The process of the inventions in which the mixture containing granular<br>
aggregate materials, one or more kinds of aqueous binders (cross linking agents are<br>
added according to the case) and water, is carried out using, for example, a stirrer.<br>
[0033] In the method for forming the molds of the inventions, in the process of foaming<br>
by stirring, the mixture of the aggregate materials is stirred so that foaming air would<br>
be equally dispersed, preferably with the foaming ratio of 50 - 80 %. Foaming is bad<br>
with a foaming ratio of 50 %, and the strength is not sufficient with a foaming ratio of<br>
not less than 80 %. According to this, the effect for the aggregate material mixture to<br>
flow when it is filled under pressure into the space for forming molds is obtained (P'igure<br>
l). The granular aggregate material mixture is equally dispersed as a whipped cream by<br>
this foaming. In the description of the inventions, "foaming" means the period of 10<br>
seconds occurring after the stirring procedure stops, which preferably occurs in the<br>
aggregate material mixture when it is stopped for more than 15 seconds with a foaming<br>
ratio of 50-80%.<br>
[0034] Here, the ratio of foaming was calculated by the following formula.<br>
Ratio of Foaming_ (%) = { (Total Volume of the Mixture) — Volume of Granular<br>
Aggregate Material, Aqueous Binder, and Water}/(Total Volume of the Mixture) } X<br>
100<br>
[0035] Further, the stirring for foaming may be done either by the same stirrer as that<br>
for mixing or by another stirrer. The foamed air generated by stirring is equally<br>
dispersed in the mixture.<br>
[0036] In the present inventions, the method for filling the foamed aggregate material<br>
mixture in the space for forming molds may be by either the method of placing the<br>
foamed aggregate material mixture in a cylinder and pressing it directly or the method<br>
of pressing by air.<br>
[0037] Here, "pressing it directly by a cylinder" means pressing the mixture in the<br>
cylinder (means for storing the mixture) into a die by the manner of press fitting of the<br>
direct pressing by the press fitting of the piston with a pressing mechanism. "Pressing<br>
by air" means the method of supplying compressed air (air) to the upper surface of the<br>
mixture in the means for storing the mixture when press fitting the mixture into a die<br>
with a cover, which cover airtightly closes the opening at the top of the means for<br>
storing the mixture and is connected to a compressed air source provided at the bottom<br>
of the piston rod of the cylinder with the pressing mechanism, instead of the piston in<br>
the method of press fitting the mixture in the means for storing the mixture by the<br>
piston with the pressing mechanism.<br>
[0038] In the process of evaporating a water component in the filled aggregate material<br>
mixture, caking the aggregate material mixture, and forming molds by the method for<br>
forming molds of the present inventions, the method of evaporating the water<br>
component consists of evaporating the water component by a die, set at a high<br>
temperature, which defines the space for forming molds, radiating heated water vapor<br>
or microwaves, leaving the mold in the vacuum atmosphere, and ventilating the space<br>
for forming molds according to the needs, etc.<br>
[0039] In evaporating at a high temperature the water component by a die that<br>
defines the space for molding molds, dispersed bubbles in the aggregate material<br>
mixture and the water component in the binders gather in the central part of the molds<br>
by means of stirring by the heat of the heated die, so molds of which the central part is<br>
low in the density of the packed aggregate materials are obtained. If the mold is used<br>
for casting, it becomes easy to eject the gases etc. derived from the decomposition of the<br>
binders because the amount of the binders is small because of the low density of the<br>
central part and because the part of the hole of the mold is large.<br>
[0040] The cores for casting metal of the present inventions are obtained from forming<br>
by the method for forming molds. When the aqueous binders used in the present<br>
inventions are used for casting nonferrous metal alloys such as aluminum alloys or<br>
magnesium alloys to form a core for casting, the core is easily removed after the binders<br>
are volatilized or decomposed and the poured and melted metal is cooled, though the<br>
pouring temperature in the mold is about 700 °C and a lower pouring temperature<br>
than the pouring temperature of iron- system materials of 1400 °C.<br>
[0041] Also, when the core for casting of the present inventions is used for casting<br>
iron-system metals, normal poured and melted iron-system metal is made by coating<br>
the surface of the core. And a mold can also be ejected and removed.<br>
[0042] Further, in the core for casting metal of the present inventions, the gases<br>
generated during the production and usage of the core for casting metal substantially do<br>
not have discomforting odors, but have the odor of baking biscuits.<br>
[0043] Also, for the preservation of the binder solutions when cross linking agents are<br>
used, preferable is keeping separately two kinds of polyvinyl alcohols or their<br>
derivatives and the other binders, and mixing both of them at the time of use.<br>
[0044] Examples<br>
The method for forming molds of the present inventions is specifically explained in the<br>
following.<br>
[0045] (Process of mixing and stirring l)<br>
To granular aggregate material of 100 weight parts and aqueous solutions comprising a<br>
binder component of 0.1 - 5.0 weight parts in relation to this granular aggregate<br>
material is added water, of which the weight parts and the weight parts of the aqueous<br>
binders are 1-20 weight parts. They are stirred by a stirrer to foam the aggregate<br>
material mixture at the ratio of foaming of 50 - 80%.<br>
[0046] (Process of mixing and stirring 2)<br>
To granular aggregate material of 100 weight parts, aqueous solutions comprising a<br>
binder component of 0.1 - 5.0 weight parts in relation to this granular aggregate<br>
material, and more than 10 weight % of an aqueous solution of 5 - 100 weight % of cross<br>
linking agents in relation to the aqueous binders, is added water of which the weight<br>
parts, the weight parts of the aqueous binders, and the weight parts of the aqueous<br>
solution of the cross linking agents, are 1-20 weight part. They are stirred by a stirrer<br>
to foam the aggregate material mixture at a ratio of foaming of 50 - 80 %.<br>
[0047] (Process of casting)<br>
Next, a process of forming is explained based on Figure 2. The mixture 1 obtained in the<br>
process of mixing and stirring is input into a cylinder 2. Then the cylinder 2 is<br>
extended, the aggregate material mixture 1 is filled in a cavity 4 of a die for forming<br>
molds 3, which cavity is set up at the upper part of the cylinder 2 and is maintained at<br>
200 - 280 °C, a water component of the filled aggregate material mixture is evaporated<br>
and caked, and a formed mold is taken out from the cavity 4 of the die for forming molds<br>
3 after a cross linking reaction has taken place. Or, when the cross linking reaction in<br>
the die for molding molds 3 is not sufficient, the formed mold that is taken out is put in<br>
an incubator maintained at a temperature wherein the aqueous binders and cross<br>
linking agents cause a sufficient cross linking reaction, preferably at 200 — 300 °C for a<br>
time sufficient for the cross linking reaction, preferably for 10 - 40 minutes. Then the<br>
formed mold is taken out from the incubator after a sufficient cross linking reaction has<br>
taken place.<br>
[0048] Example 1<br>
Silica sand (Fluttery Sand) of 100 weight parts, polyvinyl alcohol of (JP - 05: Nihon<br>
Sakubi - Poval) of 0.2 weight parts, starch (DextrinNSD - L: Nisshi) of 0.8 weight parts,<br>
citric acid (Fuso Kagaku) of 0.2 weight parts, and water of 5 weight parts, are mixed<br>
with stirring, foamed at 200 rpm for about 3 minutes by a mixer (Aikousha Desktop<br>
Mixer), and the results of the ratio of foaming of the aggregate material mixture<br>
measured. The results according to the other conditions are shown in Table 1. Also, a<br>
CCD photo of the aggregate material mixture of Test No. 1 is shown in Figure 1.<br>
[0049] Bubbles are equally and sufficiently distributed in the aggregate material<br>
mixture shown in Figure 1. Also, the aggregate material mixture of the conditions of<br>
Test Nos. 1 - 7 in Table 1 (hereafter, the explanation refers to Figure 2) are put in the<br>
cylinder 2, filled with pressure to about 70 cm3 of the volume of the cavity 4, which is<br>
maintained at 250 ºC by an electric cartridge heater of a die 3 for forming molds in a<br>
cylinder, and at a surface pressure of 0.5 MPa of an air cylinder, retained for 2 minutes,<br>
the water component of the aggregate material mixture is evaporated and caked, and<br>
then the formed mold is taken out from the cavity 4 of the die for forming molds 3 to<br>
obtain a formed mold which can be sufficient for its use.<br>
[0050] Example 2<br>
Silica sand (Fluttery Sand) of 100 weight parts, polyvinyl alcohol (JP — 05: Nihon<br>
Sakubi - Poval) of 0.2 weight parts, starch (DextrinNSD - S: Nichiden Kagaku) of 0.8<br>
weight parts, butanetetracarboxylic acid (Rikacid BT - W: Shinnihon Rika) of 0.2<br>
weight parts, and water of 5 weight parts, were mixed with stirring, foamed at about<br>
200 rpm for about 3 minutes by a mixer (Aikousha Desktop Mixer) (hereafter, the<br>
explanation refers to Figure 2), about 80 g of the aggregate material mixture was put in<br>
the cylinder 2, a pressure of about 70 cm3 of the volume of the cavity 4 was set, which<br>
was maintained at 220 °C by an electric cartridge heater of a die 3 for forming molds in<br>
a cylinder with a surface pressure of 0.5 MPa of an air cylinder, kept for 3 minutes, the<br>
water component of the aggregate material mixture was evaporated and caked, and<br>
then the formed mold was taken out from the cavity 4 of the die for forming molds 3.<br>
Then, the formed mold was put in an incubator maintained at 220 °C for 40 minutes,<br>
reacted with cross linking, and then taken out from the incubator. A test of pouring<br>
melted metal was done with this formed mold as a core of the die for casting. An<br>
aluminum alloy was poured at the pouring temperature of 710 °C and no casting<br>
defects occurred. Also, when melted metal was poured at the pouring temperature of<br>
710 ºC, the binders were volatilized and decomposed and the core could be easily<br>
removed after the poured and melted metal was cooled. Also, no discomforting odors<br>
were generated during the forming and pouring, and the odors were like those from<br>
biscuits being baked.<br>
[0051] Example 3<br>
An ethanol-system coating reagent (Threecoat MTS - 720A: Mikawa Kousan Co. Ltd.)<br>
was coated on the mold obtained by the same method for forming to give a core for<br>
casting, and a test of pouring melted metal was carried out. Cast iron (FCD450) was<br>
poured at the pouring temperature of 1370 °C to give an excellent poured and melted<br>
metal without discomforting odors, any casting defects, or generation of deformations.<br>
Also, a core could be easily removed from the poured and melted metal.<br>
[0052] Example 4<br>
Silica sand (Fluttery Sand) of 100 weight parts, polyvinyl alcohol (JP - 05: Nihon<br>
Sakubi - Poval) of 0.2 weight parts, starch (DextrinNSD -1/ Nisshi) of 0.8 weight parts,<br>
citric acid (Fuso Kagaku) of 0.2 weight parts, and water of 5 weight parts, were mixed<br>
with stirring, foamed at about 200 rpm for about 3 minutes by a mixer (Aikousha<br>
Desktop Mixer) (hereafter, the explanation refers to Figure 2) about 90 g of the<br>
aggregate material mixture was put in the cylinder 2, a pressure of about 80 cm3 of the<br>
volume of the cavity 4 was set, which was maintained at 220 - 270 °C by an electric<br>
cartridge heater of a die 3 for forming molds in a cylinder with a surface pressure of 0.5<br>
MPa of an air cylinder, kept for 1 - 3 minutes, the water component of the aggregate<br>
material mixture was evaporated and caked, and then the formed mold was taken out<br>
from the cavity 4 of the die for forming molds 3. Test templates (10 X 10 x L60) were<br>
made from this formed mold and the results measured of the packing densities and the<br>
flexural strength of the test templates kept in the incubator under a humidity of 30%.<br>
The test templates kept in the incubator under a humidity of 98% for 24 hours are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
[0053] It is found from Table 2 that the strength in regards to the flexural strength of<br>
the formed molds kept in the incubator under a humidity of 30% for 24 hours is assured<br>
under the conditions of Table 2 to be used for molds. However, at the die temperature of<br>
220 °C, the strength under a humidity of 98% after 24 hours is low even for the<br>
retention time in the die of 3 minutes. Since the cross linking reaction is not sufficient<br>
in the die under this condition, it is necessary to treat the mold with cross linking under<br>
a temperature of 220 °C for about 20 minutes, or under a temperature of 250 °C for<br>
about 10 minutes after taking out the die.<br>
[0054] When the temperature of the die is 250 - 270 °C, the strength after 24 hours at a<br>
humidity of 98% for the retention time in the die of 1 minute is sufficient for use as<br>
molds, so no cross linking treatment after taking a mold from the die is necessary.<br>

0.4 - 1.2 weight parts, and water of 5 weight parts, were mixed with stirring, foamed at<br>
about 200 rpm for about 3 minutes by a mixer (Desktop Mixer manufactured by<br>
Aikousha) (hereafter, the explanation refers to Figure l), about 90 g of the aggregate<br>
material mixture was put in the cylinder 2, a pressure of about 80 cm3 of the volume of<br>

was evaporated and caked, and then the formed mold was taken out from the cavity 4 of<br>
the die for forming molds 3. Test templates (10 X10 X L60) were made from this formed<br>
mold and the results measured of the packing densities and the flexural strength of the<br>
test templates kept in the incubator under a humidity of 30% for 24 hours are shown in<br>
Table 3.<br>

made from this formed mold and the results measured of the packing densities and the<br>
flexural strength of the test templates kept in the incubator under a humidity of 30%<br>
and the test templates kept in the incubator under a humidity of 98% for 24 hours are<br>
shown in Table 4.<br>
[0057] It is found from Table 4 that the strength in regards to the flexural strengths of<br>
the formed molds kept in the incubator under a humidity of 30% for 24 hours are<br>
assured under the conditions of Table 1, to be used for molds. It is found that the<br>
strengths in regards to the flexural strength of the formed molds kept in the incubator<br>
under a humidity of 98% for 24 hours by adding cross linking agents are assured<br>
sufficiently to be used for molds.<br>
[0058] Example 7<br>

Kishida Kagaku) of 0.2 weight parts, starch (Dextrin NSD - L: manufactured by Nissi)<br>
of 0.8 weight parts, citric acid (manufactured by Fuso Kagaku) of 0.4 weight parts, and<br>
water of 6 weight parts, were mixed with stirring, foamed at about 200 rpm for about 3<br>
minutes by a mixer (Desktop Mixer, manufactured by Aikousha) (hereafter, the<br>
explanation refers to Figure 2), about 90 g of the aggregate material mixture was put in<br>
the cylinder 2, a pressure of about 80 cm3 of the volume of the cavity 4 was set, which<br>
was maintained at 250 °C by an electric cartridge heater of a die 3 for forming molds in<br>

measured of the packing densities and of the flexural strength of the test templates kept<br>
in the incubator under a humidity of 30%. The test templates kept in the incubator<br>
under a humidity of 98% for 24 hours are shown in Table 5.<br>
[0059] It is seen from Table 2 that the strength in regards to the flexural strength of the<br>
formed molds kept in the incubator under a humidity of 30% for 24 hours using a<br>
saponin as aqueous binders also definitely have the conditions of tests Nos. 2-5<br>
necessary to be used for molds. However, when the saponin of No. 1 alone was used,<br>
the strength was not more than 1.0 MPa. When cross linking agents were added to the<br>
saponins as Nos. 2 - 5, it was found that a cross linking reaction occurred, and a<br>
strength sufficient to be used under a humidity of 98% after 24 hours was shown.<br>
[0060] Example 8<br>
A mixture of which the ratio of the contents of polyvinyl alcohol (JP - 05: manufactured<br>
by Nihon Sakubi - Poval), starch (DextrinND - S: manufactured by Nisshi) , and citric<br>
acid (Fuso Kagaku) was 1:4:2 was put in an incubator for 10 minutes. The mixture<br>
when taken out was left under a helium atmosphere in a heat decomposition oven at<br>
590 *C for 5 seconds. Then gases generated by the heat decomposition were passed<br>
through a column (after being kept at 50 °C for 10 minutes, the temperature was raised<br>
to 240 °C at the rate of 10 °C / min and kept for 15 minutes) and the species of the<br>
gases were analyzed by a mass spectrometer. Figure 3 shows the results of the<br>
analyses of the components of the gases generated from the binders of the present<br>
inventions, by that mass spectrometer. As a result, carbon dioxide, acetic acid, and<br>
furfural were detected (Figure 3).<br>

a die 3 for forming molds in a cylinder at a surface pressure of 0.5 MPa of an air cylinder,<br>
kept for 2 minutes, and the water component of the aggregate material mixture was<br>
evaporated, caked, and reacted with cross linking and then the formed mold was taken<br>
out from the cavity 4 of the die for molding the molds 3. Test templates (10 X 10 X L60)<br>
were made from this formed mold. The results of the measurements of the bulk<br>
density and the amount of binders of each part are shown in Table 6.<br>
[0062] It is found that the core of a mold (4-5 mm from surface) is low in bulk density<br>
and small in the amount of binders compared to the surface (0—1 mm from the surface).<br>
[0063] Industrial Applicability<br>
At the stage of pouring melted metal of the processes of the forming and casting,<br>
excellent effects are accomplished in that few toxic gases are generated, the formed<br>
molds can be easily removed from poured and melted metal after the pouring, and the<br>
ability to fill the die for forming molds is good. Further, anti-humidity can be<br>
accomplished by a cross linking of the aqueous binders and by cross linking agents.<br>
