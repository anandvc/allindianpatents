				<td>This invention relates to a pharmaceutical formulation useful for the treatment of Hepatitis viral infections and a process for its preparation. This invention particularly relates to a pharmaceutical formulation useful for the treatment of acute and chronic Hepatitis B &amp; C virus infections prepared from the Indian biotype medicinal plant  Helianthus amours. This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of the pharmaceutical formulation useful for the treatment of acute and chronic Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C and other viral infections of the liver from the medicinal plant Phyllanthus amarus.<br>
It is needless to stress the need for a successful drug that would keep the liver functioning at its optimum or the one that would be selectively active against the currently known etiological agents of acute viral diseases of the liver. This is important because the disease of the liver throw the entire human body out of gear. The exciting alphabet of viral Hepatitis includes a wide range of totally unrelated often highly unusual pathogenic human viruses like Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Hepatitis D virus (HDV), Hepatitis E virus (HEV) etc. Of the viruses it has been dearly established that HBV, HCV and HDV are the ones that are associated with the development of chronic persistent/active hepatitis, cirrhosis of the liver and even hepatocellular carcinoma besides being associated with culminant hepatitis and sub acute hepatic failure.<br><br>
The natural disease course in HBV is being summarized to understand the need for the effective management and treatment of Hepatitis B in a country. For normal adults with low viral production and an early immune response, the disease course is self limiting and usually asymptomatic (60-80% of all HBV infections). Individuals who replicate the virus in larger quantities, with a relatively late immune response have a self-limiting symptomatic acute hepatitis. Irrespective of whether initially symptomatic or asymptomatic, the infection becomes chronic in 5-10% of the individuals, 20-30% of them developing clinical sequelae such as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatica within years or decades. In neonates, however, the immune defense is still lacking (induction of tolerance), so that infected individuals do not develop acute hepatitis, but more of them become chronic carriers    (80-90%).    Such carriers also progress frequently to<br><br>
chronic clinical sequelae faster. Between these Uvo extremes are immunocompromised individuals, such as intravenous drug users, haemodialysis patients or transplant recipients, who are more likely to become chnjnic carriers than are healthy adults (10-60%). (WHO Tech. Report. Series 1987;754:18)<br>
Based on substantial body of data, HBV has been proved as a major pathogen producing chronic liver diseases. It has also been proved that there are over 400 mllliCKi healthy earners of HBV all over the worid and one tenth of these carriers (40 millions) t)eing in India alone. These carriers besides acsng as htrnian reservoirs of HBV infection also act as primary soun::e of spread of HBV Infection to the community and was also shown to have 200 times increased risk of develc^ng chronic liver diseases and/or hepatocellular carcinoma.<br>
With the above documented international HBV scenario, the HBV epidemiology in India is to be considered as alarming since there are definite data on preÂ«ilence pattern of HBV in asymptomatic population (4%) high risk groups (13%), significant inwslvement of HBV in Indian acute and sub-acute liver feilure cases (42 &amp; 45%). 70% of the chronic hepatitis cases, 40-80% of ctrrtrasis cases and over 60% of primary liver cancer cases.<br>
Although effective vaccines have been devdoped against HBV and successfully adopted, the need for effective treatment of acute and chronic Hepatitis B has become universal public health emergency since vaccines as on date are neit^ier capable of inducing Immunity in a carrier nor able to diminate HBV carrier status. Research conducted from the mid 70s have delineated several agents to have treatinent potential in chronic HBV infections which has be^ illustrated In tiie Table 1 given below.<br><br>

ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEPAimS-C: 1. Acute HCV Infection<br>
Persons with acute HCV infection typically are either asymptomatic or have a mild clinical illness ; 60%-70% have no discernible symptoms ; 20%-30% might have jaundice ; and 10%-20% might have nonspecific symptoms (e.g. anorexia, malaise or abdominal pain).   Qinical illness in patients with acute hepatitis C who seek medical<br><br>
care is similar to tJiat of other types of viral hepatitis, and serologic testing is necessary to determine the etiology of hepatitis in an individual patient. In a 20% of these patients, onset of symptoms might precede anti-HCV saoconversion. Average time period from exposure to symptom onset is 6-7 weeks, w/hereas average time period from e)qx&gt;sure to seroconversion is 8-9 weeks. Anti-HCV can be detected in 80% of patients within 15 weeks after exposure, in &gt; 90% witiiin 5 months after exposure, and in &gt; 97% by 6 months after exposure. Rarely, seroconversion might be delayed until 9 months after ej^sure.<br>
The course of acute hepatitis C Is variable, although elevations in semm ALT levels often in a fluduating pattern, are its most characteristic feature. Normalization of ALT levels might ocojr and suggests fliti recovery, but this is frequentiy fbilowed by ALT elevations tfiat indicate progression to chronic disease. Fulminant hepatic feilure following acute hepatitis C Is rare. However, in developing country especially India, HCV in FHF was reported significantiy.<br>
2. Chronic HCV Infection<br>
After acute Infection, l5%-25% of persons appear to resolve their infection without sequelae as defined by sustained absence of HCV RNA in serum and normalization of ALT le\Â«ls. Chronic HCV infection devel{^ in most persons (75%-85%), with persistent or fluctuating ALT elevations indicating active liver disease devdoping in 60%-70% of chronically infected persons. In the remaining 30%-40% of chronically Infected persons, ALT levels are normal. No clinical or epidemic^ogic features among patients with acute infection have been found to be predictive of either persstoit infection or chronic liver disease. Moreover, various ALT patterns have been otiserved in these patients during follow-up, and patients might have jXDlonged periods ( ^ 12 months) of normal ALT activity even though they have histologically confimied dironic b^Mtitis. Thus a single ALT detemiination cannot be used to exclude ongoing hepatic injury, and long term follow-up of patients witii HCV infection is required to determine their clinical outcome or prognosis.<br>
The course of chronic liver disease is usually insidious, progressing at a slow rate without symptoms or physical signs in the majority of patients during the first two or more decades after inl^ction. Frequentiy, chrcwiic hepatitis C is not recognised until asymptomatic persons are identified as HCV positive during blood donor screening or elevated ALT levels are detected during routine physical examinations.   Most studies<br><br>
have reported that cirrhosis develops in i0%-20% of persons with chronic hepatitis C over a period of 20-30 years, and HCC in i%-5%, with striking geographic variations in rates of this disease. This difference is more discemable also in the SEA region<br>
countries.<br>
Although factors predicting severity of liver disease have not been well defined, recent data indicate that increased alcohol intake, being aged &gt;40 years at infection, and being male are associated with more severe liver disease. In particular, among persons with alcoholic liver disease and HCV infection, liver disease progresses more rapidly ; among those with cirrhosis, a higher risk for development of HCC exists. Furthermore, even intake of moderate amounts (&gt;10 g/day) of alcohol in patients with chronic hepatitis C might enhance disease progression. More severe liver injury observed in persons with alcoholic liver disease and HCV infection possibly is attributable to alcohol induced enhancement of viral replication or increased susceptibility of cells to viral injury.<br>
The cur^nt treatment guidelines of HCV infection are presented below :<br>
. Current efifective therapy for HCV infection is IFN based, with or without other therapeutic agents such as ribavirin. Ribavirin monotherapy is not recwnmended.<br>
. For the interim, patients with acute hepatitis should receive IFN-a, 3-6 million units (or 9-15 pg) thrice weekly for atleast 6 months until more effective regimens emerge.<br>
. The standard treatment for previously untreated (naive) patients with chronic hepatitis C is IFN-a, 3-6 million units (or 9-15 pg) thrice weekly fw 12 months. However, recent data indicate that a regimen of IFN-a and ribavirin for 6 months or IFN-a monotherapy using different schedules and/or higher doses may significantiy improve sustained response rates and become preferred options for treatment in the future.<br>
. Adverse side-effects to IFN and ribavirin are tolerable, but a fatal outcome (suicide, liver failure, sepsis) has been observed primarily in patients with cirrriosis. Less severe side-effects occur in less than 10% of the treated patients and include flu-like symptoms, fetigue, thinning of hair, myalgia, bone marrow suppression requiring<br><br>
dose reduction, neuropsychiatric effects, such as depression and autoimmune disease (thyroid). All patients must be carefully monitored by the prescribing doctor for side-effects by using appropriate biochemical, haematotogical and immunological tests. Appropriate medical records should be maintained.<br>
Newer Search of Antiviral Agents Against Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C<br>
One of these searches for the last two decades has been in the development of a promising antiviral agent against hepatitis B and hepatitis C and otiier viral infections of liver  from the plant, Phyllanthus amaais.<br>
Phyllanthus niruri Linn, as it has been indexed in majority of published ethnobotanlcal reviews, until recently, belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae. Phytlanthus is one of the largest genera of the family Euphorbiaceae containing about 700 species. It has been shown that about 24 species of Phyllanthus are active against clinical Hepatitis (Jaundice) as indicated in TaWe 2, out of which 8 have been used in India.<br>

TAXONOMY OF PHYLLANTHUS AMARUS:<br>
This plant has recently been delineated as a mixture of three distinct species namely Phyilantiiusamarus, Phyilanthus frat&amp;nusand Phyflanttiusdebilis. It was later idenlafied that the drumtropical weed P. amanjs is the predominant species in South India, particularly in Tamilnadu. P. amarus are erect annual herbs, 10-60 cm tall ; main stem simple or branched, terrete smooth or scabridulous in younger parts. Cataphylls, stipules 1.5-1.9 mm long, ddtoid acuminate blade 1-1.5 mm long, subulate acuminate. Deciduous branchlets 1.5-14 cms long, subserete, smooth or a few lower nodes sometimes scabridulous witii 13-30 distichous leaves. Leaves 3-11 x 1.5 x 6 mm elliptic oblong obovate, oblong, or even obovate, obtuse, or minutely apiculate at apex, obtuse or slightiy Inequilateral at base, petioles 0.3-0.5 mm long , stipules 0.8-1.1 mm long triangular accuminate. Flowers in axillary, unisexual and bisexual cymles on deciduous branches. Prodmal 2-3 axils with unisexual cymules, each consisting of 1 male and 1 female or 2(-3) males and fenale or 1 male and 2 female flower or combination thereof ; male flowers pedicals at anthesis ca 1 mm long. Calyx lobe 5, subequal each c3 0.7 x 0.3 mm elliptic or oblong elliptic and abruf^y acute at apex hyaline with unbranched mid ribs. Disc segments 5, roundish stames 3 (rarely 2): filaments connate into a column 0.2-0.3 mm high autheros sessile a top dehiscing longitudinally. Female flowers; pedicles 0.8-1 mm long, obtusely 4 gonous, dialated above, ca 1.5 mm in fruits, calyx 5 lobes, subequal. Ovate-oblong, acute at apex, midsepaline band green. Disc flat, deeply 5 lobed. Lobes sometimes toothed at apex. Styles 3, free, more or less spreading, shallowly bifid at apex ; arms divergent (Mitra &amp; Jain, Bull Bot Surv Ind 1985;27:167-176).<br><br>
HISTORICAL USE OF P. NIRURI IN JAUNDICE<br>
Even though clinical uses of P. nimri and other species viz. P. amarus dted for over a century in the Ayurvedha and Siddha literatures, scientific evaluatory studies have been attempted only during the last 50 years for its efRcacy in the treatment of jaundia;/viral hepatitis. A logical approach towards Identification of the active principles of P. amarus is to fractionate the plant extracts and identify biologically active compounds and to chemically characterise them.<br>
STUDIES ON P.NIRURI/P. AMARUS AGAINST HBV:<br>
The first ever designed invitro antiviral shjdy on Phyllanthus niruri against any hepatitis virus with HBV as model was reported by Thyagarajan in 1979 fhxn Madras CThyagarajan, Ph.D. Thesis, University of Madras 1979), India. Subsequentiy, Thyagarajan et al (1982) have shewn the whole plant extract of P. ninjri thnxjgh several solvents bn^ught about binding of Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) (Thygarajan et al., Ind J Med Res 1982; 76(Suppl.): 124-130. This plant from Tamilnadu, India was later identified taxonomically by Unander as P. amarus. Venkateswaran et al (1987) (Proc Nati Acad Sci USA 1989;14:195-201) and Blumberg et al (1989) (Cancer detection and prevention 1987;84:274-278). fn^m United States using the P. amarus plants provided by Thyagarajan have shown that the plants collected from Madras, India whose aqueous exbacts bound the surface antigen of HBV invitro, have inhibited tiie viral DNA polymerase (DNAp) of HBV and Woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) invitro. When administered intraperltoneally to WHV infected woodchucks, acutely infected animals lost the viral surface antigen; the surfece antigen titre dropped in some chronically infected animals; the liver cancer rate in treated chronically infected animals was lower than the untreated controls.<br>
Based on these findings they had secured an Australian patent numbered AV-A-56530/86 for a composition of matter useftjl in the treatment of Hepatitis B vinjs infection consisting essentially of the methanol extractable components of P. niruri L.<br>
Yanagi et al., (Meeting on Hepatitis viruses, Sept 25-28, 1989, Cold Spring Haror Laboratory, NY, 1989,77) ft^m Japan have reported that aqueous extracts of high dilutions of P. amarus collected from South India inhibited HBV DNAp, DNApI, T4-DNAp, the Klenow fragment and reverse transcriptase of avian myeloblastosis virus. Shead et al (1990) (1990 International symposium on viral Hepatitis and liver diseases, April 4-8, 1990, Houston, TX, USA; A602) from Australia have shown tfie aqueous<br><br>
extracts to inhibit the endogenous DNAp of DHBV at high dilutions. Niu etal (1990) fbrm Australia in collatwration vi/ith Thyagarajan from India using P. amams collected from Madras, Tamilnadu, on treatment of 4-5 week old ducks congenitally infected with Duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV) with suitable controls after a period of 10 weeks treatment showed transient reduction of wral DNA in serum but no effect on the level of virus DNA or suface antigen in the liver (J Med Virol 1990;32:212-218).<br>
Jayaram et al (1996) (Ind J Pathol Microbiol 1996;39(3);211-215) reported invitro inhibition of HBsAg secr^on by PLCyPRF/5 (Alexander) cell line for 48 Mrs when the cellline was treated with 1 mg/ml concentration of P. amarus as a single dose. Lee et al (1996) (European J Qin Invest 1996; 26:1069-76) from USA in collaboration with TTiyagarajan have shown that P. amarus down-regulates Hepatitis B vims m RNA transcription and replication using transgenic mice and transgenic celllines. The continuation of this collaboration by Ott et al (1997) has shown the cellular and molecular mechanism of HBV suppression by P. amarus to be by interrupting interactions between HBV enhancer I and cellular transcription factors (European J Clin Invest 1997; 27-.908-915).<br>
The biosafety studies on P. amarus dates back to 1971 when Mokkhasmit et al from Thailand using P. niruri have reported it to be non toxic to mice at 10 gms/kg body weight (Bull of Dept of Medical Science NAPRALERT Chicago, IL, 1971;12:36-65). Rao (1985) from Andhra Pradesh, India reported 20% aqueous extract of P. ninjri leaves to be effective to be as an oral pretreatment of 0.2 ml/lOO mg body weight against CCU induced hepatotoxicity in rats (Probe 1985;115-119). Syamasundar et al (1985) from Uttar Pradesh, India showed the hexane extracted compounds Phytlanthin and Hypo phyllanthin reduced Ca4 or galatosamine induced cytotoxicity to cultijred rat hepatocytes (J Ethnopharmacol 1985;14:41-44). Jayaram et al (1987) from Madras, India using the aqueous extract of dried whole plant showed no chronic toxicity in mice at 0.2 mg daily dose per animal for 90 days as revealed by physiological, biochemical and histopathological parameters. There was also no cybDtonic or cytotoxic changes when tested in a tissue culture model using vero cell line (Biomedicine 1987;7:9-16). Venkateswaran et al (1987) fi"om USA demonstrated its invivo safety using woodchucks as animal models, while Niu et al (1990) from Australia have shown P. amanjs to be non toxic in Pekin ducks chronically infected with duck Hepatitis B virus. 3ayaram and Thyagarajan (1994) studying ttie effect of P. amarus on p-galactosamine induced hepatotoxicity on isolated rat hepatocytes have shown that a) P. amarus by itself did.not<br><br>
bring about any hepatotoxidty on rat hepatocytes. b) At 1 mg/ml concentration the aqueous extract were shown to protect isdated rat hepatocytes significantly from p-galatosamine induced hepatotoxidty thus ptiving the anti hepatrtoxic potentials of P. amanjs (Ind J Med Microbiol 1994;12(4):247-250).<br>
In all the traditional medidne systems, there has bewi several formulatory medicines for the treatment of jaundice in general without taking into consideration their virat etiology. Even though P. niruri was one of the constituents of such medicines, these wens always been multiherbaf ^Keparatkms oontaining anywhere upto 12 medicinaf hertas and most of the treatment evaluations were based on clinical Improvement onfy. On the other hand, there is no documented blal report on their use In chronic liver disease patients.<br>
It was in this context, Thyagarajan and his collaboratore, after proving the Invitro and invivo efficacy and safety of P. amams, conducted 2 open dinical trials In acute viral hepatitis cases and seven cElnical trials (2 of th&amp;r\ being double blind trials and the others Phase I/II open trials) In chronic carriers of Hepatitjs B vims (HBV) Jayanthi et al (1988)CJ Gasfroenterol and Hepatxrf 1988; 3:533-534) In a control dinical trial in acute viral hepatitis (AVH) using P. nimri on one arm, and other hertjal medicines in other groups have shown a signiflcantiy greater decrease In transaminases after two weeks treatment with P. ninjri in both HBsAg positive and negative groups. In a virologically characterised AVH dinical trial, Geetiia et at (1992) (J Gen Medidne 1992;4(2): 53-58) have ^lown that a) P. amarus treatmeit has brought about significantiy fester biochemical nonnalcy in botii hepatitis A and B ; b) there was a higher rate of HBsAg dearance in P. amarus treated AVH-B cases than ottrer treatment modalities and c) there was no observable side effects due to P. amarus treatment.<br>
The dinical trials were conducted by Thyagarajan et al between 1988 and 1997. While the first dial 1988 (Lancet 1988; 2:764-766) reported 59% HBsAg clearance in the P. amarus treated group, as against 4% in tiie placebo gnsup, the second open trial (1990) (Lancet 1990;2: 949-950) showed 20% HBsAg clearance and 63.6% loss of Infectivity Indicated by HBeAg sero-conversion. Paralldy, Investigators from other countries like l-eelarasamee et al (1990) (Lancet 1990;l:1600-160i) from Thailand, Wang Me Xia et al from China (1991) (Hepatology RIR 1991;21(5):22-24) have reported tfie non produdbility of treatment efficacy by the local variety of P. amanjs grown in tiieir respective countries.<br><br>
CONCEPT &amp; HYPOTHESIS<br>
It was the feeling that the non-reproducibliity of treatment efficacy of tiie extract of the plant Phyllanthus amams was due to the absence in the extract of all the under mentioned antiviral and biological properties which are essentially required for the efficient treatment of Hepatitis B (both acute and chronic) Hepatitis C and other rdated viral infections of the liver.<br>
(i)       HBsAg binding property fecilitating the inactivation of the virus in circulation<br>
ultimately leading to viral dearance. (li)      HBV-DNA pdymerase enzyme inhibiting potential, thus acting as anti-wral<br>
preventing the multiplication of HBV. (iii)      Reverse Transcriptase enzyme inhibition also required for the initiation of HBV<br>
replication, (iv)     Inhibition of HBsAg secretion from HBV transinfected liver cells thus possessing<br>
activity against virus infected chrcffiic live- disease conditions, (v)      Hepatoprotective and antih^jabatoxic properties against the liver cell toxidty<br>

PHYLLANTHUS AMARUS TREATMENT IN ACUTE AND CHRONIC HEPATXnS C<br>
Available lilsrature in the public domain did not reveal any report on the use of Phyllanthus amarus in the treatment of acute and chronic hepatitis C virus infection which is another major liver pathogen leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Hence the formulation of Phyllanthus amams envisaged by the present invention v^tas utilised to conduct two clinical trials to treat acute and chronic tiepatitis C. The first clinical trial was conducted on two cases by Dr.Eric Walker and his co-workers at Glasgow, UK during the period 1996-99 using the earlier "University preparation" of Phyllanthus amarus in the ftwm of capsules provided by Thyagarajan et al from Chennai, India. The preliminary results obtained by Eric Walker et al (unpublished) are presented in Table 4.<br>
Since there are no experimental animal/tissue culture models available for testing specific antjvirai properties against Hepatitis C virus (HCV), dirert studies on human volunteers infected with HCV were conducted. Ethical clearance and Infwmed consents from the study participants were obtained based on the high safety profile of the preparation of P.amaru5 prepared by the applicants as described above.<br>

The invention is based on our surprising findings that when the parts of the plant Phyllanthus amarus are extraded separately with a polar solvent alone, other than water, mixture of polar solvent and water  and water alone   and when the extracts so<br>
obtained are mixed together , the resultant formulation is found to have all the under mentioned properties which are required for the efficient treatment of Hepatitis B (both acute and chronic). Hepatitis C (both acute and chronic) and other related viral infections of the liver, (i)        HBsAg binding property facilitating the inactivation of the virus in circulation<br>
ultimately      leading to viral clearance, (ii)       HBV-DNA polymerase enzyme inhibiting potential, thus acting as anti-viral<br>
preventing the multiplication of HBV. (iii)      Reverse Transcriptase enzyme inhibition also required for the initiation of HBV<br>
replication.<br><br>
(iv)     Inhibition of HBsAg secretion from HBV transinfected liver cells thus possessing<br>
activity against virus infected chronic liver disease conditions, (v)    Hepatoprotective, antiinflammatory, antihepatotoxic and liver ceil regenerative<br>
properties against the liver cell toxicity brought about by all hepatitis viruses<br>

A.	HBsAg binding property of the pharmaceutical formulation of the invention<br>
Prindole: The test is an en2yme immunoassay based on the sandwich principle. HBsAg in the plasma is neutralised or bound by pre-incubation with anti-HBs like substance, and hence no longer reacts with the antibody coated in the wells. The presence of HBsAg binding activity in the formulation of the present inventiwi is demonstrated by reduction of colour or a negative ELISA result The presents of unbound HBsAg in a test sample is demonstrated by an increase in the colour or a positive ELISA result.<br>
Procedure: Pre-incubatlon with HBsAg plasma: Equal volume of pre-titrated HBsAg positive plasma and 5mg/ml concenb^tion of the formulation of the present invention was mixed and inojbated at 37""C for 5 days. The mixture was assayed daily for the presence of bound/unbound HBsAg using Hepanostika or any other commercial EQSA kit Control tubes containing solvent (PBS) and plasma (solvent control) and P. amams and plasma (positive control) w&amp;e set up in each batch. ELISA was performed as per the instructions of the manufacturer given in the kit.<br>
Calculation:<br>
1.	Cut-off value: the cutHDff value was calculated as mean negative conbx)l+0.025<br>
