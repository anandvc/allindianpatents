				<td>HIGH CLEANING DENTIFRICE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to dentifrice compositions containing a silica abrasive, which provides improved oral cleaning and a safe level of abrasivity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Synthetically produced silicas play an important role as an ingredient in many of today's toothpaste formulations. Such silicas are relatively safe, nontoxic, ingredients which are compatible with other toothpaste ingredients, including glycerin, sorbitol (or xylitol), thickening agents, detergents, coloring and fragrance materials and optionally fluoride and other actives, whereby the silica acts as an abrasive to clean teeth, remove plaque and food debris.<br>
As an abrasive, silicas debride and physically scrub the external surface of the teeth. This scrubbing action removes the organic film (i.e. the pellicle), formed of salivary proteins which covers the teeth and which is known to become stained and discolored by foods, such as coffee, tea and berries, as well as, by tobacco smoke, cationic antibacterials, and chromogenic bacteria. Such physical removal of the stained pellicle is a simple and effective means of removing the undesirable surface staining and discoloration which occurs daily. Further, such physical removal of the pellicle also removes plaque bacteria on the pellicle surface.<br>
Synthetic silicas include both silica gels and precipitated silicas which are prepared by the neutralization of aqueous silicate solutions with a strong mineral acid In the preparation of silica gel, a silica hydrogel is formed which is then typically washed to low salt content. The washed hydrogel may be milled to the desired size, or otherwise dried, ultimately to the point where its structure no longer changes as a result of shrinkage. When preparing such synthetic silicas, the objective is to obtain abrasives which provide maximal cleaning (i.e. removal of stained pellicle) with minimal damage to the tooth enamel and other oral tissue. Dental researchers are continually concerned with identifying synthetic silicas meeting these objectives.<br><br>
U.S. Patent 4,153,680 and GB Patent Application 2,038,303A both disclose the general use of silica hydrogels or hydrated silica gels as dentifrice polishing agents. U.S. Patent 4,632,826 discloses the use of hydrated silica gels in combination with a weakly calcined alumina polish, to form a combination abrasive system. U.S. Patents 4,943,429, 5,176,899 and 5,270,033 provide lists of alternative polishing agents, such lists including hydrated silica gels.<br>
US Patent 5,939,051 discloses dentifrice compositions prepared with silica gels having low abrasion and high cleaning products. However, the silica gels have a low particle size distribution of from 2 to 4 microns in order to achieve the low abrasive properties. Manufacturing such small particle size silica gel is energy intensive and relatively costly.<br>
US Patents 5,658,553 and 5,651,958 disclose dentifrice compositions containing a combination of precipitated silica and silica gels having high cleaning and low abrasion as indicated by their low radioactive dentin abrasion (RDA) values. Due to the low abrasive nature of the silicas-described in US 5,651,958 and 5,658,553 the composition inherently has limited cleaning ability.<br>
RDA value is a dental art recognized method of determining the abrasiveness of dentifrice formulations and is determined according to the method recommended by the American Dental Association as set forth by Hefferren, Journal of Dental Research, 'Volume 55, Issue 4, July-August 1976, pp. 563-573, and described in the Wason U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,340,583,4,420,312 and 4,421,527.<br>
In spite of the extensive prior art relating to silica hydrogels and other abrasive compounds used to prepare dentifrice compositions for oral cleaning, there is still a need for additional compositions providing improved pellicle cleaning, improved removal of plaque and food debris, all with minimal abrasion of the tooth enamel and other oral-tissue.<br>
It is known in the dental art that increasing the RDA value of a dentifrice composition above 110 does not result in a corresponding increase in the cleaning performance of the dentifrice, as measured by Pellicle Cleaning Ratio (PCR), an in vitro method used to measure the efficacy of removing tea and coffee tooth stains relative to a standard. The PCR values referred to herein are obtained by a modification of the method described in "In Vitro Removal of Stain with Dentifrice", G.K. Stookey, et al J. Dental Research, 61, 1236-9, 1982. The modification of the PCR method used herein is described in US Patents 5,658,553 and 5,651,958. In this modification, a clear pellicle material is applied to a bovine tooth first, which is then stained with a combination of the pellicle material and tea, coffee and FeCla whereas in the original method described by Stookey et al, both pellicle and stain are applied simultaneously.<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that by the practice of the present invention the PCR value of a dentifrice composition can be made significantly higher than those reported in the prior art. Li fact, PCR values from 150 to 300 can be achieved at RDA values from 110 to 200 when using the silica hydrogel abrasive of the present invention it being noted that RDA values of 110 to RDA of 250 (maximum allowable) are well within the acceptable abrasivity standards set by the US Federal Drug Administration as well as the American Dental Association, pursuant to the Federal Register (Anticaries Over-The-Counter Drug Products), vol. 45, No. 62, 1980, and vol. 60, No. 194,1995.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided a dentifrice composition having superior cleaning functionality, which dentifrice composition, comprises:<br>
(a) an orally acceptable dentifrice vehicle containing from about 5 to about 30% by weight silica hydrogel particles, the particles containing about 10 to about 35% by weight water having:<br>
(i)       a mean particle size from about 5 to about 12 microns;<br>
(ii)      an Einlehner hardness of from 1 to about 20;<br>
(iii)     an oil absorption value of from about 40 to less than 100<br>
cc/l00g; (iv)     a BET surface area from 100 to 700 m2/g of silica,<br>
the morphology of the particles being characterized by glass conchoidal fracture surfaces, whereby the dentifrice composition has an RDA of from 110 to 200, and a PCR of from about 150 to about 300.<br>
Mean particle size is-measured using a Malvern Particle Size Analyzer, Model Mastersizer S, Malvern Instruments, Inc., Southborough, MA. 01772 wherein a helium-neon gas laser beam is projected through a transparent cell which contains the silica hydrogel particles suspended in an aqueous solution, light rays which strike the particles are scattered through angles which are inversely proportional to the particle size. The photodetector array measures the quantity of light at several predetermined angles. Electrical signals proportional to the measured light flux values are then processed by a microcomputer system, against a scatter pattern predicted from theoretical particles as defined by the refractive indices of the sample and aqueous dispersant to determine the particle size distribution of the silica hydrogel.<br>
Einlehner hardness value is obtained using Einlehner At-1000 Abrader to measure the softness of the silica hydrogel in the following manner: A Fourdrinier brass wire screen is weighed and exposed to the action of a 10% aqueous silica<br>
hydrogel suspension for a given number of revolutions. The hardness value 10 expressed as milligrams weight lost of the Fourdrinier wire screen per 100,000 revolutions.<br>
BET surface area is determined by a BET nitrogen adsorption method described in Brunauer et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 60, 309 (1938). The BET measurement is preformed using an Accelerated Surface Area and Porosimetry Analyzer (ASAP 2400), by Micromeritics Instrument Corporation, Norcross, Georgia 30093. The sample is outgassed under vacuum at 350°C for a minimum of 2 hours before measurement.<br>
Oil absorption values are measured using the ASTM rub-out method D281. All measurement levels are by weight of the total composition, unless otherwise indicated, such as the case of PCR and RD A values, which are unitless. Additionally, all measurements are made at 25°C, unless otherwise specified.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Silica Hydroffel<br>
The silica hydrogel of the present invention is comprised of colloidal particles<br>
of silica having an average particle size ranging from about 3 microns to about 12 microns, and more preferably between about 5 to about 10 microns and a pH range from 4 to 10 preferably 6 to 9 when measured as a 5% by weight slurry.<br>
The silica hydrogel used to prepare the dentifrice compositions of the present invention are differentiated by means of their oil absorption values, having oil absorption values of less than 100 cc/lOOg, and preferably in the range of from 45 cc/lOOg silica to less than 70 cc/lOOg silica.<br>
The silica hydrogel used in the present composition can be further differentiated by the morphology or shape of its particles which are characterized by glass conchoidal fracture surfaces as shown in Figure 1 of the drawings.<br>
Preparation of the silica hydrogels of the present invention is known in the art, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,153,680 and U.K. Patent Application GB 2,038,303A, the hydrous silica gels being the result of the reaction of an alkali silicate solution with an SiO2 concentration of about 6 to 20 percent by weight in the presence of a mineral acid, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, or phosphoric acid. Sodium or potassium silicate may be used as the alkali silicate, with sodium silicate being preferred. The acid is added to the alkali silicate solution until a pH of less than 10 to 11 is reached. The resulting product is a solid silica which includes the water within its pores. After the silica hydrogel is formed it is washed, until a purity level of about 98% SiC&gt;2 is obtained (the remaining impurity being sulfate salts). The resulting silica hydrogel is milled to the desired 3 to 10 microns in diameter particle size and dried to a water content of from 10 to 35% by weight, preferably about 20 to 30% by weight, to yield the desired silica hydrogel.<br>

Preparation Of The Dentifrice<br>
The preparation of dentifrices is well known in the art, such as described in<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 3.996,863. 3,980.767. 4,328,205 and 4,358,437, which are incorporated herein by reference. More specifically, to prepare a dentifrice of the present invention, generally the humectants e.g. glycerin, sorbitol, propylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol; are dispersed in the water in a conventional mixer under agitation. Into the dispersion are added the organic thickeners, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), carrageenan, or xanthan gum; any anionic polycarboxylate; any salts, such as sodium fluoride anticaries agents; and any sweeteners; the resultant mixture is agitated until a homogeneous gel phase is formed. Into the gel phase are added a pigment such as TiOa, and any acid or base required to adjust the pH. These ingredients are mixed until a homogenous phase is obtained. The mixture is then transferred to a high speed/vacuum mixer; wherein, the inorganic thickener, such as Zeodent 165; and surfactant ingredients are added to the mixture. The silica hydrogel of the present invention is added at this point, along with other abrasives to be used in the composition. Any water insoluble antibacterial agent, such as triclosan, is solubilized in the flavor oils to be included in the dentifrice and the solution is added along with the surfactants to the mixture, which is then mixed at high speed for from 5<br>
to 30 minutes, under vacuum of from about 20 to 50 mm of Hg, preferably about 30 mm Hg. The resultant product is in each case a homogeneous, semi-solid, extrudable paste or gel product.<br>
The following example further describes and demonstrates preferred embodiments within the scope of the present invention. The example is given solely for illustration, and are not to be construed as limitation of this invention as many variations thereof are possible without departing from its spirit and scope.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
A   silica   dentifrice   composition   of   the   present  invention,   designated<br>
"Composition 1" was prepared with a 20% by weight total abrasive content as listed in Table I below consisting of a combination of a the silica hydrogel Sylodent XWA 650 having the morphology shown in Figure 1.<br>
For purposes of comparison, a comparative dentifrice designated "Composition 2" was also prepared in the same manner as Composition 1 with 20% by weight total abrasive content except the abrasive content consisted only of a precipitated silica abrasive (Zeodent 115) having the morphology shown in Figure 2. The ingredients of Composition 2 are also listed in Table-Ibelow.TABLEI<br>
(Table Removed)Compositions 1 and 2 were prepared in a jacketed, vacuum mixing tank at ambient room temperature. The glycerin and sorbitol humectants were added to the water in the mixing tank and agitation was started. The sodium fluoride salt, sodium saccharin sweetening agent, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose organic thickener, and Gantrez S-97 were added and mixing continued until a homogenous gel phase was obtained. Into the gel phase were added the TiO2 pigment and the sodium hydroxide to adjust the pH. The Zeodent 165 silica thickening agent was then added to the abrasives, and the resulting mixture was added to the mixing tank under high agitation and a vacuum of about 30 mm of Hg. The triclosan was dissolved in the flavor oils to form a solution and the solution was added, with the sodium lauryl sulfate surfactant, to the mixing tank still maintaining the vacuum at about 30 mm of<br>
Hg.   Mixing and vacuum continued for approximately 15 minutes.   The resulting composition which was an extrudable paste, having a pH of about 7, was tubed.<br>
The PCR of Compositions 1 and 2 was established using the modified Stookey procedure, as described hereinbefore, and the results are recorded in Table n, below. RDA values for the dentifrice compositions was determined by the Hefferren method, as described earlier, and the results also recorded in Table n.<br>
TABLEII(Table Removed)<br>
Referring to Table E, Composition 1 containing both the silica hydrogel abrasive of the present invention and precipitated silica abrasive exhibited a significantly higher PCR than comparative Composition 2, containing only the precipitated silica abrasive, the RDA values for Compositions 1 and 2 both being substantially below acceptable standards whereas the PCR value of Composition 1 was significantly greater than that of comparative Composition 2.<br>
EXAMPLE n<br>
Two silica dentifrice composition were prepared in accordance with the<br>
