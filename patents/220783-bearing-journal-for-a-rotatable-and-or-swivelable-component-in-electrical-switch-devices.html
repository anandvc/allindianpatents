				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to a bearing journal for rotatable and/or pivotable components in electric switch means according to the preamble of claim 1.<br>
Switch means such as line protecting switches, remote drives, auxiliary switches etc. normally include mechanically operable, pivotally attached components which are, in the case of a short circuit or an overload, actuated by an energy accumulator connected thereto in order to release the respective electric switch means. Remote drives e. g. include an electric motor which, via a toothed gearing, drives a control wheel for actuating a toggle which is operatively connected to the control wheel via a power transmission means, e. g. a connecting rod.<br>
If such a control wheel is driven by an electric motor the control wheel applies, via the connecting rod, an operating force (pressure) to the toggle so as to move same to its position of tension. If the remote drive shall be released by remote control the control wheel is, if necessary, further rotated by the electric motor, thereby a tension or pressure being applied, via the connecting rod, to the toggle which effects a release of the toggle, so that same is returned to its release position by a spring bias.<br>
The above description of only the control wheel as a preferred embodiment of the invention makes clear that the movable, i. e. rotatable and pivotable, components of switch means of this genre are partially subjected to pulsating or alternating stress which has to be transmitted from their respective bearing journals to the individual parts of the housing.<br><br>
In order to ensure operatability of switch means of this genre for a long time it is known from the prior art to form bearing journals of especially highly stressed components of a metal pin. This metal pin has an elongated axis portion having a small diameter at the one end of which a disc-shaped axis portion having a large diameter is provided in one piece. The housing part at which the axis shall be provided has normally a through hole including a disc-shaped hollow on the side of the housing part opposed to the bearing journal.<br>
For' mounting the metal pin forming the bearing journal same is inserted into the through hole from the one side of the housing part on which the hollow is provided, wjierein the disc-shaped axis portion of the metal pin is pressed into the disc-shaped hollow of the housing part and, if necessary, fixed therein by gluing. The component to be supported is then directly pivoted on the steel pin within the area of its axis portion having a small diameter.<br>
The above description shows that the fabrication of a bearing journal having such a design is expensive and time-consuming and that assembly is complicated. This makes the whole switch means more expensive which shall be produced as a bulk article in mass production.<br>
In these circumstances, it is the object of the invention to provide a bearing journal construction the design of which is simpler and more functional compared to the above described prior art.<br>
This object is achieved by a bearing journal having the features of claim 1.<br><br>
Consequently, the invention consists in constructing the bearing journal as a component formed in one piece with the housing part and made of the same material as the housing part, the component being provided with an axially extending bore into which a simple stiffening pin is inserted.<br>
The advantage of this design consists in the fact that the bearing journal is produced along with the fabrication of the housing part quasi in one working step, wherein the stiffening pin itself may be designed as a simple rod which only has to be pressed into the axially extending bore and/or has t.o be fixed therein by gluing. This allows the use of cheap rod and/or wire materials for the stiffening pin which do not have to be further machined according to their specific function but only have to be cut to the suitable length. This does not only simplify the production but also reduces the mounting expenditure vis-a-vis the prior art, thus reducing the costs of the switch means.<br>
The further development of the bearing journal according to the invention as described in claim 2 provides the bore as a pocket hole which is closed, at the free end portion of the bearing journal, by a top or cap which is preferably formed in one piece with the bearing journal. This measure prevents that, upon pulsating and/or alternating stress, the stiffening pin gradually moves out of the bore towards the free end portion of the bearing journal, thereby the operatability of components that might be located eccentrically at the component supported on the bearing journal being impaired.<br>
The remaining subclaims contain further advantageous embodiments of the invention.<br><br>
In the following, the invention is explained more precisely by using a preferred embodiment and by referring to the attached drawings.<br>
Figure 1 shows the interior of a remote drive as a possible example for application in a perspective view and<br>
Figure 2 shows the cross-sectional view through the electric switch means formed with a bearing journal according to the invention.<br>
According to figure 1 as attached, the electric switch means is a remote drive 6 comprising an electric motor (not shown) which is, via a reducing gear, operatively connected to a control wheel which is not shown either foj: actuating a toggle 5. The control wheel is pivoted on a bearing journal 1. The cross section of this bearing journal 1 is shown in figure 2.<br>
Consequently, a housing part 2 of the remote drive 6 which is, in the present case, a housing partition is formed in one piece with the bearing journal 1, the housing part 2 concerned being fabricated as a plastic material injection molding, wherein, during injection molding of the housing part 2, the bearing journal 1 itself is formed in one piece therewith.<br>
As can be seen from figure 2, the bearing journal 1 made of plastic material has a central axial bore 3. This bore 3 is closed at the free end portion of the bearing journal 1, thus forming a pocket hole. On the side of the housing part 2 opposite of the bearing journal 1, the bore has a hole 7.<br>
Over its entire axial length, the bore 3 is formed essentially with the same bore diameter. Into the bore 3, a<br><br>
stiffening pin 4 is inserted which is, in the present case, a metal rod or a piece of wire, the metal rod 4 being adapted to the cross section of the bore 3 which is, in the present case, a round section, preferably having a slight oversize so as to provide a press fit with the bearing journal 1 made of a plastic material.<br>
The metal rod 4 is completely pressed into the bore 3, therefore, at its free front, being flush with the side of the housing part 2 which is opposite of the bearing journal 1. If necessary, the metal rod 4 may be additionally fixed in the bore by gluing.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment, the bearing journal 1 serves for supporting the control wheel described first above of the remote drive 6, which is, via a connecting rod which is not shown, operatively connected to the actuating toggle 5 of the remote drive 6 and to which, during a drive of the control wheel by an electric motor, pulsating or alternating stress is applied for actuating the toggle 5. This kind of stress is transmitted to the bearing journal 1 as a bending force that would cause a deformation of the plastic journal if same was not stiffened.<br>
In the present case, however, the bearing journal 1 is reinforced by the stiffening pin 4 made of metal, this increasing the bearing journal's 1 bending strength. The stiffening pin 4 is simply cut from yard ware to the right measure as a cylindrical metal rod without grooves or radial projections and inserted into the bore 3 formed in the plastic bearing journal 1. Due to the fact that the bore 3 is provided as a pocket hole having a closed upper side at the free end of the bearing journal 1 the metal rod 4 cannot move out of bearing journal 1 even if there is a<br><br>
pulsating or alternating stress, so that the danger of inoperativeness of the present control wheel is removed.<br>
It should be noticed that the bearing journal design according to the present invention cannot only be used for supporting a control wheel of a remote drive but also for all other components to be pivotably or rotatably supported which are in particular subjected to a higher alternating or pulsating stress.<br>
The present invention relates to a bearing journal 1 for rotatable and/or pivotable components in electric switch means 6 such as remote drives, the bearing journal 1 being disposed at a housing part 2 of the switch means 6. According to the invention, the bearing journal, 1 is formed in one piece with the housing part 2 of the switch means 6, preferably of plastic material, and comprises an axial bore 3 into which a stiffening pin 4, preferably made of metal and of a circular shape, is inserted.<br><br><br><br><br>
