				<td>Description<br>
Control and communication system including an engineering<br>
unit<br>
The invention refers to a control and communication system<br>
including a number of automation units (e.g. computer units,<br>
computer plug-in modules or personal computers) which are<br>
adapted to process signals in function plans within the<br>
automation unit and which are connected in the same level to<br>
a common communication bus for providing a peer-to-peer<br>
communication between the automation units. Further the<br>
invention refers to an engineering unit for such a control<br>
and communication system. Finally, the invention refers to a<br>
method of an automated peer-to-peer communication in a<br>
control and communication system of the manner mentioned<br>
above.<br>
A control and communication system of said manner includes<br>
among other things a number of automation units which are<br>
connected in one level of the command structure or hierarchy<br>
of the system to a common communication bus. Such systems are<br>
also called peer-to-peer systems and the respective<br>
communication between the automation units is called peer-to-<br>
peer (PtP) communication. In these peer-to-peer systems, in<br>
order to solve control and communication objects of technical<br>
plants a particularly high number of signals has to be<br>
exchanged. Accordingly, often up to 30 automation units have<br>
to be installed at a single communication bus and up to 200<br>
signals have to be exchanged for each communication<br>
connection and direction.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, in known peer-to-peer systems so called<br>
communication components or communication chips 14 and 16<br>
have been used, which were arranged in pairs in two<br>
corresponding automation units (not shown). One of the<br>
communication components 14, the sending component, collects<br><br>
several signals and transmits them altogether to the<br>
corresponding receiving component 16 of the another<br>
automation unit. Thereby, each automation unit is working on<br>
the basis of a corresponding function plan. Fig. 1 shows the<br>
function plans 10 and 12 of the automation units and the<br>
corresponding communication components 14 and 16. The<br>
communication components 14 and 16 are addressed via signal<br>
connectors 18 transferring signals between a signal database<br>
(not shown) and the communication components 14. A particular<br>
partnership relation 20 is appointed between the<br>
communication components 14 and 16 by means of a partner<br>
number 22 for each partner or communication component 14 and<br>
16, and further by means of an identification number 24 for<br>
each of the communication components 14 and 16 within the<br>
partnership relation 20. In addition, a succession relation<br>
26 is to be defined by means of an assignment of the incoming<br>
and outgoing connections, so that the signals are not<br>
interchanged.<br>
The disadvantages of these known systems and methods are a<br>
rather high risk of failures because of peer-to-peer<br>
communication components which have to be parameterised and<br>
interconnected manually. Further, uhe documentation of these<br>
manual designs is often rather incomplete, signals of<br>
different technologies are or have to be collected for a<br>
common transfer, and a navigation over several function plans<br>
is not possible either.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a peer-<br>
to-peer control and communication system and a method of an<br>
automated peer-to-peer communication in a control and<br>
communication system in which the above mentioned problems<br>
are overcome, and by which the risk of failures in the peer-<br>
to-peer communication is reduced.<br>
According to the invention, the object is solved by a control<br>
and communication system including a number of automation<br><br>
units which are adapted to process signals in function plans<br>
within the automation unit and which are connected in the<br>
same level to a common communication bus for providing a<br>
peer-to-peer communication between the automation units, and<br>
further including an engineering unit being connected to the<br>
communication bus and being adapted to provide functions<br>
allowing at least one automation unit to exchange signals to<br>
a function plan which is attributed to another automation<br>
unit.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the functions<br>
includes allowing the at least one automation unit to present<br>
the signals to be exchanged to a function plan which is<br>
attributed to another automation unit in the same way as<br>
those signals to be exchanged within the automation unit.<br>
Further, according to the invention, the object is solved by<br>
a control and communication system including a number of<br>
automation units which are adapted to process signals in<br>
function plans within the automation unit, which are adapted<br>
to transmit the signals within the automation unit via signal<br>
connectors, and which are connected in the same level to a<br>
common communication bus for providing a peer-to-peer<br>
communication between the automation units, and further<br>
including an engineering unit being connected to the<br>
communication bus and being adapted to represent signal<br>
connections overlapping automation units in the same way as<br>
the signal connectors.<br>
In such a control and communication system according to the<br>
invention it is further preferred that the engineering unit<br>
being adapted to provide a list of those signals which are to<br>
be received by the other automation unit when the at least<br>
one automation unit intends to exchange signals to a function<br>
plan which is attributed to the other autonation system.<br><br>
The list of those signals which are to be received by the<br>
other automation unit preferably includes a version number<br>
for an unambiguous identification of the list. Thus, the risk<br>
of confusion in the signal transfer can be reduced.<br>
In addition, preferably, each automation unit is adapted to<br>
keep two consecutive versions of the list. The two<br>
consecutive versions may provide the basis for a roll back<br>
functionality in the peer-to-peer communication system<br>
according to the invention.<br>
Further preferred, the automation units each include a peer-<br>
to-peer system function being adapted to manage all peer-to-<br>
peer connections of an automation unit.<br>
The peer-to-peer system function of the receiving automation<br>
unit should advantageously be adapted to copy the list in a<br>
sending buffer of the receiving automation unit. During this<br>
step the old list might be kept in the background of the<br>
sending buffer of the receiving automation unit.<br>
For a further improvement of such a system, the peer-to-peer<br>
system function of the receiving automation unit should be<br>
adapted to send the list from the receiving automation unit<br>
to the sending automation unit.<br>
In addition, the peer-to-peer system function of the sending<br>
automation unit should be adapted to copy the list to a<br>
receiving buffer of the sending automation unit.<br>
In a further preferred peer-to-peer communication the peer-<br>
to-peer system function of the sending automation unit is<br>
adapted to copy all relevant signals according to the list<br>
from a signal data base to a sending buffer of the sending<br>
automation unit.<br><br>
Furthermore, the peer-to-peer system function of the sending<br>
automation unit should be adapted to send all signals of the<br>
sending buffer to the receiving automation unit.<br>
For a final check of the entire transmission, the peer-to-<br>
peer system function of the receiving automation unit should<br>
be adapted to compare all received signals with the list in<br>
the corresponding sending buffer and to copy all correct<br>
signals to a signal data base of the receiving automation<br>
unit.<br>
The problem underlying the invention is further solved by an<br>
engineering unit for a control and communication system<br>
including a number of automation units which are adapted to<br>
process signals in function plans within the automation unit<br>
and which are connected in the same level to a common<br>
communication bus for providing a peer-to-peer communication<br>
between the automation units, the engineering unit being<br>
adapted to be connected to the communication bus and being<br>
adapted to provide a list of those signals which are to be<br>
received by a receiving automation unit when at least one<br>
sending automation unit intends to exchange signals to a<br>
function plan which is attributed to the receiving automation<br>
unit.<br>
Further preferred the engineering unit is adapted to provide<br>
the list of those signals which are to be received by the<br>
receiving automation unit with a version number for an<br>
unambiguous identification of the list.<br>
Said object is further solved according to the invention by<br>
means of a method of an automated peer-to-peer communication<br>
in a control and communication system, the control and<br>
communications system including a number of automation units<br>
which are adapted to process signals in function plans within<br>
the automation unit and which are connected in the same level<br>
to a common communication bus for providing a peer-to-peer<br><br>
communication between the automation units, the method<br>
including the step of allowing at least one automation unit<br>
to exchange signals to a function plan which is attributed to<br>
another automation unit in the same way as those signals to<br>
be exchanged within the automation unit.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the object is solved by means<br>
of a method of an automated peer-to-peer communication in a<br>
control and communication system, the control and<br>
communication system including a number of automation units<br>
which are adapted to process signals in function plans within<br>
the automation unit, which are adapted to transmit the<br>
signals within the automation unit via signal connectors, and<br>
which are connected in the same level to a common<br>
communication bus for providing a peer-to-peer communication<br>
between the automation units, the method including the step<br>
of representing signal connections overlapping automation<br>
units in the same way as the signal connectors.<br>
Preferably, said methods according to the invention include<br>
the step of providing a list of those signals which are to be<br>
received by a receiving automation unit when at least one<br>
sending automation unit intends to exchange signals to a<br>
function plan which is attributed to the receiving automation<br>
system.<br>
Further preferred, said methods includes the step of<br>
providing a version number at the list of those signals which<br>
are to be received by the receiving automation unit for an<br>
unambiguous identification of the list.<br>
In order to provide a roll back functionality, it is further<br>
preferred that the methods include the step of keeping two<br>
consecutive versions of the list in each automation unit.<br>
The methods should further include the step of copying the<br>
list in a sending buffer of the receiving automation unit.<br><br>
Thereby, the old list should be kept in the background of the<br>
sending buffer.<br>
The list should be further send from the receiving automation<br>
unit to the sending automation unit.<br>
At the sending automation unit it is further preferred to<br>
copy the list to a receiving buffer of the sending automation<br>
unit.<br>
Further preferred, the methods according to the invention<br>
should include the step of copying all relevant signals<br>
according to the list from a signal data base to a sending<br>
buffer of the sending automation unit.<br>
Thereafter, all signals of the sending buffer should be send<br>
to the receiving automation unit.<br>
As a kind of final quality check, all received signals should<br>
be compared with the list in the corresponding sending buffer<br>
of the receiving automation unit. Thereafter, all correct<br>
signals should be copied to a signal data base of the<br>
receiving automation unit.<br>
The solutions according to the invention provide the<br>
advantage that the risk of communication failures caused by<br>
the developer and user is reduced to a minimum. There is no<br>
further danger of using the wrong communication partner,<br>
using overlapping signal areas or interchanging signals. The<br>
documentation of the systems according to the invention can<br>
be reduced to the technical features only, and there is no<br>
need for design and adjustment of visible communication<br>
components by the user.<br>
Additionally, according to the invention, by the peer-to-peer<br>
communication systems and nethods all comfortable functions<br><br>
for a function-plan-overlapping navigation of the engineering<br>
system, even for peer-to-peer signals, are supported.<br>
In case of amendments or modifications of the assignment of<br>
function plans to particular automation systems, no<br>
troublesome redesign of automation-system-overlapping signals<br>
is necessary. According to the invention, internal signals of<br>
automation systems become peer-to-peer signals, and vice<br>
versa.<br>
A preferred embodiment of a control and communication system,<br>
an engineering system and a method of an automated peer-to-<br>
peer communication in a control and communication system<br>
according to the invention will be described hereinafter<br>
referring to the enclosed schematical drawings. Therein:<br>
Fig. 1 shows the peer-to-peer communication proceeding<br>
between two automation units of prior art as described above,<br>
Fig. 2 shows an embodiment of a control and communication<br>
system according to the invention,<br>
Fig. 3 shows a peer-to-peer communication proceeding between<br>
two automation units of the control and communication systerv<br>
according to Fig. 2, and<br>
Fig. 4 shows an embodiment of a method of an automated peer-<br>
to-peer communication in a control and communication system<br>
according to Fig. 2.<br>
In Fig. 2 a control and communication system 30 is depicted<br>
which includes a number of automation units 32 and an<br>
engineering unit 34. The automation units 32 and the<br>
engineering 34 are realised by computer plug-in modules and<br>
by a personal computer, which are each adapted to process<br>
signals in corresponding function plans.<br>
Further, the automation units 32 and the engineering unit 34<br>
are each connected to a common communication bus 36. The<br>
communication bus 36 is provided in a redundant manner and is<br><br>
adapted to link or interconnect said units with each other,<br>
transferring signals among the automation units 32 and<br>
between the automation units 32 and the engineering unit 34.<br>
During the signal transfer among the automation units 32, all<br>
automation units 32 have the same communication-hierarchy<br>
level, thus providing a peer-to-peer communication between<br>
the automation units 32.<br>
The engineering unit 34 is also connected to the<br>
communication bus 36 and is adapted to provide functions<br>
allowing at least one automation unit 32 to exchange signals<br>
to a function plan which is attributed to another automation<br>
unit 32. In particular (see Fig. 4), the engineering unit 34<br>
provides functions, which allow a first automation unit<br>
handling a first function plan 38 to present signals 40 to be<br>
exchanged to a second function plan 42 which is attributed to<br>
a second automation unit in the same way as those signals to<br>
be exchanged within the automation unit.<br>
For the exchange of signals within each automation unit 32,<br>
the signals are provided with so called signal connectors 4 4<br>
(see Fig. 3), which include information about the signal<br>
connections to be provided for the corresponding signals. The<br>
engineering unit 34 is adapted to represent signal<br>
connections 4 6 overlapping automation units in the same way<br>
as the signal connectors 44.<br>
According to Fig. 5, this is achieved by the engineering unit<br>
34 in that it provides a list 48 of those signals 40 which<br>
are to be received by the other automation unit (so called<br>
peer-to-peer list, which may be advantageously provided by<br>
the sending automation unit).<br>
In other words, the list 48 is created, when a first<br>
automation unit 50 including the first function plan 38<br><br>
intends to exchange signals 40 to a second automation unit 52<br>
which is handling the second function plan 42.<br>
The list 48 of those signals 40 which are to be received by<br>
the second automation unit 52 includes a version number for<br>
an unambiguous identification of the list 48. The list 48 is<br>
sent to and received by the second automation unit 52, which<br>
is adapted to store both, the list 48 and an older version of<br>
said list, which was previously supplied.<br>
The first and the second automation units 50 and 52 further<br>
each include a peer-to-peer system function 54 and 56, being<br>
adapted to manage all peer-to-peer connections of the<br>
corresponding automation unit 50 and 52, respectively. The<br>
peer-to-peer system function 56 of the receiving second<br>
automation unit 50 is adapted to copy the list 48 in a<br>
sending buffer 59 of a peer-to-peer entity data component 60<br>
of the receiving second automation unit 52. An older version<br>
of the list 48 is kept in the background of said sending<br>
buffer 58.<br>
The peer-to-peer system function 56 of the receiving second<br>
automation unit 52 is further adapted to send the list from<br>
the second automation unit 52 to the first automation unit<br>
50, where it is stored to a receiving buffer 62 of a<br>
corresponding peer-to-peer entity data component 64. The<br>
peer-to-peer system function 54 of the first automation unit<br>
50/ which is, in this case, the sending automation unit, is<br>
further adapted to copy all relevant signals 40 according to<br>
the list 48 from a signal database 66 to a sending buffer 68<br>
of the sending first automation unit 50.<br>
In addition, the peer-to-peer system function 54 of the<br>
sending first automation unit 50 sends all signals 40 of the<br>
sending buffer 68 to the receiving second automation unit 52,<br>
where they are stored in a receiving buffer 70 of the peer-<br><br>
to-peer entity data component 60 of the second automation<br>
unit 52.<br>
Finally, the peer-to-peer system function 56 of the receiving<br>
second automation unit 52 is adapted to compare all received<br>
signals 40 with the list 48 in the corresponding sending<br>
buffer 58 and to copy all correct signals 40 to a signal<br>
database 72 of the receiving second automation unit 52.<br><br>
