				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel ketene oligomer from aliphatic non-polar amino<br>
acids and a process for the preparation thereof. Mopre particularly, the invention relates to a<br>
novel ketene oligomer of the general formula [R1R2C=C=O]n, where 'n' is an integer in the<br>
range of 10 to 16; R1 and R2 are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having carbon chain length<br>
in the range of 1 to 4; R1=R2 or R1-R2. More particularly, the present invention relates to<br>
linear ketene oligomers of molecular weight in the range of 500 - 1000. The invention further<br>
provides a process for the preparation of the novel ketene oligomer from aliphatic non-polar<br>
amino acids containing only carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen. The oligomer of the<br>
present invention is envisaged to find enormous application for providing eco-friendly<br>
solutions in respect of a range of environmental pollution problems, because it acts as a<br>
strong chelator for transition metals to produce an effective reusable complex for inactivating<br>
wide spectrum of anaerobes and aerobes in the environment. The same feature also<br>
enables the product to find potential application in pharmaceutical industries. The product<br>
may also be used as a delivery system for drugs through microencapsulation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND DESCRIPTION OF PRIOR ART<br>
Conventionally Ketenes are derivatives of carboxylic acid, which contains two consecutive<br>
double bonds (C=C=O), as reported by Egret et al. (European Polymer Journal, 38, 1953 -<br>
1961, 2002). Ketene and its polymer constitute a class of compounds of great interest in<br>
organic synthesis as well as in polymer science.<br>
In Polymer chemistry, the term 'monomer (smallest repeating unit of polymers)' is defined as<br>
"a substance composed of molecules which can undergo polymerization, thereby<br>
contributing constitutional units to the essential structure of a polymer molecule". The term<br>
'oligomer' can be defined as "a substance composed of molecules of intermediate relative<br>
molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises a small plurality of units<br>
derived, actually or conceptually from molecules of lower relative molecular mass (usually<br>
less than thirty monomer units)". 'Polymer' is "a substance composed of molecules of high<br>
relative molecular mass, the structure of which essentially comprises the multiple repeatition<br>
of units derived, actually or conceptually, from molecules of low relative molecular mass".<br>
Generally Ketene polymers are synthesized using ketenes and disubstituted ketenes by a<br>
suitable initiator system such as sodium naphthalene, dimethyl formamide, butyl lithium,<br>
ethyl magnesium bromide or triethylaluminium in toluene, which results in a high molecular<br>
weight, as reported by Zarras and Vogl (Progress in polymer science, 16, 173-201, 1991)<br>
and Egret et al. (European Polymer Journal, 38, 1953 -1961, 2002).<br>
According to Zarras and Vogl (Progress in polymer science, 16, 173 - 201, 1991), ketene<br>
can be polymerized as three structural units (polyester, polyketene and polyacetal). The<br>
propagating anion may form either on the carbon or on the oxygen atoms, generating either<br>
a carbanion or an enolate anion. Polyketene are obtained by carbon-carbon addition.<br>
Polyacetal structures are formed by carbon-oxygen addition, while mixed addition gives the<br>
ester structure. The polymerization of ketene generally yields ester and acetal type polymers<br>
and not polyketene, as reported by Olah et al. (Journal of American chemical society, <br>
9123-9124, 1989).<br>
Staudinger (US Patent 3,249,589) synthesized the first ketene polymer using dimethyl<br>
ketene in presence of trimethyl amine as a catalyst. In 1937, Wiezevich and Gleason<br>
(US2,103,505) reported the ketene polymers having the ester structures. The dimer of<br>
ketene, cyclobutane 1:3 dione was used as the starting material in presence of small<br>
amounts of catalyst such as mineral acids or metallic salts.<br>
Then, linear crystalline polymers of ketenes having the general formula R1R2C=C=O wherein<br>
RI and R2 are the same or different alkyl, aryl or alkyl aryl groups, in which polymers have a<br>
polyacetalic structure with the inherent viscosity of 0.21 dL/g was invented by Montedison<br>
SPA group (GB1,014,659). In continuation of the research, Montedison SPA group<br>
(GB987370) further synthesized high molecular crystalline polymers of the same type<br>
(R1R2C=C=O) where 'R1 &amp; R2' can be cycloalkyl or an alkyl-aryl group.<br>
In 1960s Natta et al. (Journal of American chemical society, 82, 4742, 1960) greatly<br>
contributed in the field of ketene synthesis by way of inventing high molecular weight linear<br>
polymers, having general formula R2C=C=O wherein 'R' is an alkyl group containing from<br>
one to six carbon atoms, a cycloalkyl or an alkyl-aryl group. Natta et al. (US3,249,589)<br>
prepared ketene polymers by the polymerization of the monomer in the presence of a<br>
catalyst having the general formula AIR'nXm ['R' represents an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl or<br>
alkoxy group or a hydrogen atom, 'X' is a halogen atom, 'm1 is 0, 1, 2 or 3 and 'n' is (3 - m)]<br>
or addition complexes of compounds of said formula particularly with organic oxygen<br>
containing bases, such as ethers, their dimmers or mixtures of them. According to Natta et<br>
al. (Journal of American chemical society, 82, 4742, 1960) the polymerization of ketene<br>
generally gives polyketone - ester mixed type polymers with very high molecular weight.<br>
After Natta et at. many groups came into existence of the synthesis of ketene polymers. <br>
German company named Wacker - chemie G.m.b.H (GB933.148), provided a process for<br>
the manufacture of diketene polymers by polymerizing di-ketene into a highly polymeric<br>
diketene in a liquid organic solvent containing a hydroxyl group in the presence of an<br>
alkaline catalyst. Thermally stable, macromolecular, highly crystalline high melting disubstituted<br>
ketene polymers of ester structure with inherent viscosity of 0.25 to 1.1 dL/g in<br>
tetralin at 145°C was prepared by cash et al. (US3,321,441). in presence of strongly basic<br>
catalyst (butyl lithium). Jorge (US4304767) invented polymers of di-ketene acetals and<br>
polyols of ortho ester structure having high molecular weight of 200,000.<br>
In the year 1989 the polymer research again focused into the synthesis of ketene polymers<br>
having polyketene structure and the process for its synthesis. Olah et al. (Journal of<br>
American chemical society, 111, 9123 - 9124, 1989) and Khemani &amp; Wudl (Journal of<br>
American chemical society, 111, 9124 - 9125, 1989) claimed the synthesis of polyketene<br>
with very high molecular weight. They used acetyl chloride as the starting material for the<br>
synthesis of polyketene in presence of 10 mol % of lewis acid halide (AICI3, FeCI3, ZnCI2,<br>
TiCI4, BF4, SbCI5) catalyst.<br>
To be used as a strong chelating agent for transition metals polyketene structure is<br>
preferable than the ester and acetal structure especially with the molecular weight of 500 <br>
The use of an insoluble supported catalyst in the polymer synthesis is an attractive approach<br>
since it allows simple isolation of the desired compound, easy elimination of by products &amp;<br>
excess reagents, facile separation &amp; recovery of the material and efficient reuse of the<br>
catalyst. Ketene oligomer synthesis using an insoluble supported catalyst such as activated<br>
carbon was not yet developed.<br>
An efficient impregnation of metals onto activated carbon can provide immense application<br>
in the field of organic and polymer synthesis. In our co-pending Indian patent application<br>
(320 DEL 2004) we provided a process for the preparation of transition metal impregnated<br>
activated carbon. The preparation of the materials involves the use of metal complexes in<br>
the form of acetyl acetonates, pyridine, picoline, hexafluoroacetyl acetone oxime of Cu, Co,<br>
Ni and insitu impregnation of the same on activated carbon having surface area of 392 - 430<br>
m2/g; average pore diameter of 35.28 - 37.20 °A; Bulk density of 0.56 - 0.62 g/cc and a<br>
composition of Carbon 37.96 - 39.36%; Hydrogen 2.46 - 3.41%; Nitrogen 0.5 - 0.71%<br>
followed by curing at optimized temperatures. The relative percentage of the transition metal<br>
based complex impregnated in the activated carbon is in the range of 0.25% w/w to that of<br>
the total carbon matrix.<br>
In view of the foregoing, the hitherto known ketene polymer and the known processes for<br>
their preparation are associated with the following limitations:<br>
1. If the molecular weight of the substance goes beyond 1000 then its chelating<br>
property will be decreased. Therefore Ketene oligomers or polymers known in<br>
the prior art are not suitable to be used as a strong chelating agent for<br>
transition metals which forms a water insoluble transition metal complex.<br>
2. Monomers used in the prior art are not naturally occurring monomer, it needs<br>
to be synthesized, therefore it affects the cost of the process and as well as<br>
its productivity.<br>
3. Catalyst mentioned in the prior art are not supported in an insoluble support,<br>
therefore it limits the reuse after two - three times.<br>
No prior art is available on ketene oligomer having the polyketene structure with the<br>
molecular weight 500 - 1000 having the general formula [R1R2C=C=O]n, where 'n' is an<br>
integer in the range of 10 to 16; RI and R2 are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having<br>
carbon chain length in the range of 1 to 4; R^R2 or Ri*R2.<br>
Further, no prior art is available for the usage of amino acid as the starting material and the<br>
transition metal impregnated activated carbon as the catalyst for the synthesis of ketene<br>
oligomers.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a novel ketene oligomer from<br>
aliphatic non-polar amino acids for industrial applications, which obviates the limitations as<br>
stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a<br>
novel ketene oligomer from aliphatic non-polar amino acid containing carbon, nitrogen,<br>
hydrogen &amp; oxygen.<br>
Yet another objective is the usage of transition metal impregnated activated carbon having<br>
the following characteristics<br>
Surface area of 392 - 430 m2/g;<br>
Average pore diameter of 35.28 - 37.20 °A;<br>
Bulk density of 0.56 - 0.62 g/ccComposition: Carbon 37.96 - 39.36%; Hydrogen 2.46 - 3.41%; Nitrogen 0.5 - 0.71%<br>
The relative percentage of the transition metal based complex impregnated in the activated<br>
carbon is in the range of 0.25% w/w to that of the total carbon matrix.<br>
Still another objective is to use solvent as initiator instead of a separate initiator in the<br>
reactions.<br>
The present invention finally leads to the formation of liquid oligomers of ketene having the<br>
molecular weight of 500 - 1000 and also a novel &amp; easy process for its production.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Aliphatic non-polar amino acid containing only carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen is<br>
dissolved in 10-100 times by weight of water to form an amino acid solution. And 50-500<br>
times by weight of alcohol is added to this solution to form a reaction mixture. The resulting<br>
solution is passed through a column packed with 100-600 times by weight of transition metal<br>
impregnated activated carbon based on the weight of amino acid, at the temperature range<br>
of20to60°C.<br>
The process for the preparation of transition metal impregnated activated carbon is provided<br>
in our co-pending Indian patent application (320 DEL 2004). The preparation process is as<br>
follows:<br>
The use of metal complexes in the form of acetyl acetonates, pyridine, picoline,<br>
hexafluoroacetyl acetone oxime of Cu, Co, Ni and insitu impregnation of the same on<br>
activated carbon having surface area of 392 - 430 m2/g; average pore diameter of 35.28 <br>
37.20 °A; Bulk density of 0.56 - 0.62 g/cc and a composition of Carbon 37.96 - 39.36%;<br>
Hydrogen 2.46 - 3.41%; Nitrogen 0.5 - 0.71% followed by curing at optimized temperatures.<br>
The relative percentage of the transition metal based complex impregnated in the activated<br>
carbon is in the range of 0.25% w/w to that of the total carbon matrix.<br>
The flow rate is maintained in such a way that the retention time ranges between 10-150<br>
min. The solution collected at the outlet is subjected to conventional separation such as solar<br>
evaporation or vacuum distillation, whereby the alcohol escapes leaving behind the ketene<br>
oligomer of the present invention. The product may be contaminated with unreacted nonpolar<br>
amino acid. Hence the ketene oligomer solution is optionally subjected to non-polar<br>
solvent extraction.<br>
This extraction involves treating the solution with 200 - 500 times by weight of a non-polar<br>
solvent based on the weight of the oligomer liquid followed by conventional separation. Purer<br>
form of the oligomer solution is obtained by repeating the extraction process. The final<br>
product is a liquid of ketene oligomer of the general formula [R1R2C=C=O]n, where 'n' is an<br>
integer in the range of 10 to 16; RI and R2 are hydrogen atoms or alkyl groups having<br>
carbon chain length in the range of 1 to 4; Ri=R2 or Ri*R2.<br>
The characteristics of the oligomer are as follows:<br>
Nature Viscous liquid<br>
Solubility:<br>
Water Insoluble<br>
Alcohols Soluble<br>
Non-polar solvents Soluble<br>
Aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons Soluble<br>
Elemental compositions (%):<br>
Carbon 70.76<br>
Hydrogen 9.49<br>
Oxygen 15.86<br>
Attenuated Total Reflectance - Fourier transformer Infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR):<br>
The ATR-FTIR spectrum of the oligomer was scanned in between 4000 - 1000 cm"1. The CH<br>
stretching vibration of methyl group shows at 2959.27 cm"1. The asymmetrical stretching<br>
and symmetrical stretching vibration of methylene group occur, respectively at 2929.97 and<br>
2860.41 cm"1. The asymmetrical bending vibration of methyl is overlapped with the<br>
scissoring vibration of the methylene groups and appears at 1380 cm"1. The multiple bands<br>
at 1300 - 1100 cm"1 region is as a result of C-C-C stretching and bending in the C-C(=O)-C<br>
group. The vibration at 1719.54 cm"1 shows the presence of C=O stretching of ketonic group<br>
which confirms the presence of ketonic structure in the oligomer.<br>
13C NMR<br>
The 13C, NMR spectrum was taken using CDCI3 as solvent. The a-methyl carbon resonances<br>
are assigned around 5 10.8 - 14.0 ppm. The shift around 5 22 - 38 ppm can be assigned to<br>
methylene groups present in the oligomer chains. The spectral regions around 5 128-133<br>
ppm is due to the presence of -C=C- group present in the monomer. The quaternary carbon<br>
of ketene oligomers are resonances at 5 193 ppm shows the presence of C=O stretching of<br>
ketonic group which confirms the presence of ketonic structure in the oligomer. The triplet at<br>
5 77.0 is the solvent CDCI3 peak.<br>
Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization Transfer (DEPT) NMR<br>
DEPT spectrum distinguishes between a CH3 group, a CH2 group and a CH group. The -<br>
CH2 resonances are assigned with the help of DEPT-135. The resonances, which are<br>
present in the 13C spectrum and absent in the DEPT spectrum are assigned to quaternary<br>
carbons. From this spectrum, it is evident that the signals around 8 193 ppm refer to the<br>
quaternary carbon.<br>
Proton NMR<br>
Proton NMR is studied in order to identify the complete structure of the oligomer. The<br>
spectral regions of 5 0.8 - 1.8 ppm are complex and these can be assigned to the aliphatic<br>
carbons in the main chain of the oligomers. Almost all the peaks on expansion also shows a<br>
complicated figure, so 1H - 13C cosy HETCOR 2D NMR was taken which correlates 13C<br>
nuclei directly attached to protons.<br>
1H - 13C COSY HETCOR (Heteronuclear chemical shift correlation) NMR<br>
2D HETCOR NMR enables unambiguous assignments of various resonance signals in 13C<br>
and 1H NMR spectra. The crosspeaks 1,2 centered at 10.83/0.9, 13.85/0.82 are assigned to<br>
methyl group present at the end of the oligomer chain. The backbone methylene groups<br>
showed sensitivity to various configurational sequences resulting in crosspeaks 3,4,5,6<br>
centered at 22.85/1.26, 23.73/1.38, 28.85/1.26, 30.33/1.32. The -C=C- in ketene oligomers<br>
are centered at 128.8/7.65 &amp; 130.91/7.46. The peak of 13C, which is not crossed any 1H peak<br>
can be considered as quaternary carbon, which lies at 8 193 ppm.<br>
14NNMRand15NNMR<br>
As the starting material of the reaction has got nitrogen atom, in order to confirm the<br>
absence of nitrogen in the oligomers the 14N NMR and 1SN NMR was scanned upto 2000<br>
times. This does not shows any presence of nitrogen. This result is in addition support to the<br>
CHNO analysis, which also tells the absence of nitrogen atom.<br>
Thermal Degradation (TGA)<br>
Ketene oligomers are relatively stable and degradation occurs only at about 230°C - 250°C<br>
at nitrogen atmosphere.<br>
The inventiveness of the invention lies in providing ketene oligomer of molecular weight in<br>
the range of 500-1000 from aliphatic non-polar amino acids using transition metal<br>
impregnated activated carbon.<br>
The invention is further described by the following examples, which are provided by way of<br>
illustration only and should therefore not be construed to limit the scope of the present<br>
invention.<br>
