				<td>Field of the invention<br>
This invention proposes an electro-medical device as a massage vibrator, capable of acting positively on aches and pains to the head, face and body of a person.<br>
State of the art<br>
Over thousands of years of application, traditional saiental medicine, Chinese in particular, has discovered how the stimulation of certain parts of the body surface can have a positive effect on disturbances, symptoms and illness of the internal organs and the various body zones. Among the numerous points discovered, some of the most important are, without doubt, the point of the energy channel of the large intestine and the large crossover of these channels. These points, situated between the thumb and the index<br><br>
2<br>
finger of the hands, and at the base of the big toe, respectively, have not only a general influence on the vital energy, but are also effective, in particular, for all forms of aches and pains to the face and head, such as migraines, headaches, toothaches and other body pains in general.<br>
In the course of time, the treatment of acupuncture zones has become enriched by increasingly refined and sophisticated stimulation methods. From the primitive needles in stone and bone, things have moved on via needles of gold and silver, to those in steel used today From stimulation by heat, we have arrived at stimulation by electricity, using magnetic impulses, and laser, as well as numerous other methods that are still in an experimental phase.<br>
Manual micro-massage, which involves vibration of the energy points, has always been one of the most effective methods, and this consideration was behind the design of the massage vibrator of the present invention, where the mechanical action of deep and accurate compression of the points in question has been combined with vibration.<br>
This combined action makes it possible to carry out mechanically a real and proper micro-massage, vibrating the specific points, without either pause or interruption due to the manual action of the operator, with highly effective results on the various aches and pains of the head, face and<br><br>
3<br>
other parts of the body surface. Description of the invention<br>
The massage vibrator which is proposed here consists of a central body that encloses a battery-powered vibration generator, a pair of springy arms on at least one, although better if both facing sides of the central body, and a head at the free raid of each arm. Then, the vibrations produced by the vibrator inside the central body are transmitted, by means of the springy arms, to the active terminal heads, which, applied to the points for stimulation, exercise an effective vibrating massage for aches and pains.<br>
The massage vibrator, therefore, represents a simple and easy-to-use device, since it may be handled, used and controlled independently by the patients themselves, without the need for an operator. It is a valid and modem response to those aches and pains, such as aches in the forehead, temples and crown of the head, rnigaines, toothache, shooting pains, cramps and soreness of the neck; against hair loss, anxiety, insomnia, worry, anger, etc., in order to relax generally. Brief description of the^rawinas       d<br>
The invention will be described in greater detail below and with reference to the enclosed drawings, which are indicative but not binding, and where<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective of the device;<br><br>
4<br>
Fig. 2 shows a side view in cross-section of the device in Fig. 1;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a horizontal cross-section of the device;<br>
Fig. 4 shows a side view of the device in use; and<br>
Figs 5 and 6 show other different ways of using the device. Detailed description of the invention<br>
The device in question consists of a central body-container (11), made in plastic, with a fixed flange (12) at the bottom and a detachable lid (13) at the top. From both sides of the central body, or at least from one side, there are added two curved, springy arms (14), each equipped with an active terminal head (15), The curved arms of each pair are joined to the body, have their respective inner curves facing one another and curve towards each other at their free ends. The terminal head (15) of each arm (14) is preferably spherical, although this does not exclude other hemispherical, ellipsoidal, cylindrical shapes, etc., which may be deemed necessary.<br>
Inside the body-container (11), there is housed and protected a vibration generator (16). This may be electromagnetic or, as shown here, a cam (19) with a motor driven electrically by two batteries (17), for example 1.5 V alkaline batteries. There is a support spring for each battery and, inside the lid, there are contacts (18). for opening and<br><br>
5<br>
closing the electrical circuit of the vibrator generator, as a result of a twisting or axial movement of the lid, or by means of a switch (20).<br>
As shown in Figs 4 and 5, the device can be taken and used directly by the patient, applying the terminal heads (15) of the springy arms (14) to the points on the hand to be stimulated, and moving the lid in order to start up the vibrator generator (16), as needed. In this way, the vibrations are transmitted to the points for stimulation with a vibratory massage action that produces the above-mentioned beneficial effects.<br><br>

CLAIMS<br>
1.	Massage vibrator for the effective relief of aches and<br>
pains in the head, face and body, by means of the<br>
direct stimulation of the energy channels and other<br>
points on the body surface, characterised by a central<br>
body   (11),   enclosing   a  vibration   generator   (16),<br>
powered by batteries, by at least one pair of springy<br>
arms (14) on at least one side of the central body and<br>
by an active terminal head (15) at the end of each of<br>
said arras, the terminal heads of each pair of arms<br>
being  applied  to the point to be  stimulated,  the<br>
vibrations produced by the vibrator in said body being<br>
transmitted, via the springy arms, to said terminal<br>
heads (15) in order to exercise a vibratory massage on<br>
the chosen point.<br>
2.	Massage vibrator according to claim 1, in which said<br>
springy urns (14) are joined to the central body and<br>
have a esrved shape, with the inner curves opposite<br>
each other and with the free ends, to which the active<br>
terminal heads (15) are applied, curving towards each<br>
other.<br><br>
3.	Massage vibrator according to claims  1 and 2, in<br>
which each active terminal head is either spherical,<br>
ellipsoidal, cylindrical or other in shape.<br>
4.	Massage vibrator according to the previous claims, in<br><br>
7<br>
which the central body is furnished with an electric switch (19) for turning the vibration generator on and off as needed, said switch being either on the top or consisting of a rotating lid on said body,<br>
5. Massage vibrator according to the previous claims, in which the vibration generator is an electromagnetic unit or an electrically* driven cam.<br>
Massage vibrator for the effective relief of aches and pains in the head, face and body, by means of the direct stimulation of the energy channels and other points on the body surface, characterized by a central body (11), enclosing a vibration generator (16), powered by batteries, by at least one pair of springy arms (14) on at least one side of the central body and by an active terminal head (15) at the end of each of said arms, the terminal heads of each pair of arms being applied to the point to be stimulated, the vibrations produced by the vibrator in said body being transmitted, via the springy arms, to said terminal heads (15) in order to exercise a vibratory massage on the chosen point.</td>
