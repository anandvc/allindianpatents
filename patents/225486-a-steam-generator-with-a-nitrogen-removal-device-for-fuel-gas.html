				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a steam generator with a nitrogen removal<br>
device for fuel gas and with a combustion chamber for fossil fuel<br>
which is followed on the fuel-gas side, via a horizontal gas flue<br>
and a vertical gas flue, by the nitrogen removal device for fuel<br>
gas.<br>
In a power plant with a steam generator, the fuel gas generated<br>
during the combustion of a fossil fuel is used for the evaporation<br>
of a flow medium in the steam generator. For the evaporation of<br>
the flow medium, the steam generator has evaporator tubes, of<br>
which the heating by fuel gas leads to an evaporation of the flow<br>
medium carried in them. The steam provided by the steam generator<br>
may, in turn, be provided, for example, for a connected external<br>
process or else for driving a steam turbine. When the steam drives<br>
a steam turbine, a generator or a working machine is normally<br>
operated via the turbine shaft of the steam turbine. Where a<br>
generator is concerned, the current generated by the generator may<br>
be provided for feeding into an interconnected and/or island<br>
network.<br>
The steam generator may in this case be designed as a continuous-<br>
flow steam generator. A continuous-flow steam generator is known<br>
from the paper "Verdampferkonzepte fur Benson-Dampferzeuger"<br>
["Evaporator concepts for Benson Steam Generators"] by J. Franke,<br>
W. Kohler and E. Wittchow, published in VGB Kraftwerkstechnik 73<br>
(1993), No. 4, p. 352-360. In a continuous-flow steam generator,<br>
the heating of steam generator tubes provided as evaporator tubes<br>
leads to an evaporation of the flow medium in the steam generator<br>
tubes in a single pass.<br>
Steam generators are usually designed with a combustion chamber in<br>
a vertical form of construction. This means that the combustion<br>
chamber is designed for the heating medium or fuel gas to flow<br>
through in an approximately vertical direction. In this case, the<br>
combustion chamber may be followed, on the fuel-gas side, by a<br>
horizontal gas flue, a deflection of the fuel-gas stream into an<br>
approximately horizontal flow direction taking place at the<br>
transition from the combustion chamber into the horizontal gas<br>
flue. In general, however, because of the thermally induced<br>
changes in length of the combustion chamber, combustion chambers<br>
of this type require a framework on which the combustion chamber<br>
is suspended. This necessitates a considerable technical outlay in<br>
terms of the production and assembly of the steam generator, this<br>
outlay being the higher, the greater the overall height of the<br>
steam generator is.<br>
A particular problem is the design of the containment wall of the<br>
gas flue or combustion chamber of the steam generator with regard<br>
to the tube-wall or material temperatures which occur there. In<br>
the subcritical pressure range to about 200 bar, the temperature<br>
of the containment wall of the combustion chamber is determined<br>
essentially by the height of the saturation temperature of the<br>
water. This is achieved, for example, using evaporator tubes which<br>
have a surface structure on their inside. Consideration is given,<br>
in this respect, to, in particular, internally ribbed evaporator<br>
tubes, of which the use in a continuous-flow steam generator is<br>
known, for example, from the abovementioned paper. These what may<br>
be referred to as ribbed tubes, that is to say tubes with a ribbed<br>
inner surface, have particularly good heat: transmission from the<br>
tube inner wall to the flow medium.<br>
To reduce the nitrogen oxides in the fuel gas of the<br>
fossil fuel, the method of selective catalytic reduction, what is<br>
known as the SCR method, may be used. In the SCR method, nitrogen<br>
oxides (NOx) are reduced to nitrogen (N2) and water (H2O) with the<br>
aid of a reducing agent, for example ammonia, and a catalyst.<br>
In a steam generator designed for an SCR method, a nitrogen<br>
removal device for fuel gas, with a catalyst, is conventionally<br>
arranged downstream of the fuel-gas duct which is designed as a<br>
convection flue and where the fuel gas normally has a temperature<br>
of about 320 to 400Â°C. The catalyst of the nitrogen removal device<br>
for fuel gas serves for initiating and/or maintaining a reaction<br>
between the reducing agent introduced in the fuel gas and the<br>
nitrogen oxides of the fuel gas. The reducing agent required for<br>
the SCR method is in this case usually injected, together with air<br>
as a carrier stream, into the fuel gas flowing through the gas<br>
flue. However, as a rule, the nitrogen oxide emission of the steam<br>
generator depends on the type of fossil fuel burnt. In order to<br>
adhere to the legally prescribed limit values, therefore, the<br>
reducing agent quantity to be injected is normally varied as a<br>
function of the fossil fuel used.<br>
However, a nitrogen removal device for fuel gas, arranged<br>
downstream of the convection flue on the outlet side, requires a<br>
considerable outlay in structural and production terms for the<br>
respective steam generator. This is because the nitrogen removal<br>
device has to be arranged in the steam generator in a place where<br>
it can exert a particularly high purifying effect on the fuel gas<br>
in all the operating states of the steam generator. This is<br>
normally the case where the fuel gas has a temperature in the<br>
range of about 320 to 400oC. Moreover, the outlay in terms of the<br>
production of a steam generator increases when the latter has, as<br>
well as conventional components, a nitrogen removal device in<br>
addition.<br>
The object on which the invention is based is, therefore, to<br>
specify a fossil-fired steam generator of the abovementioned type,<br>
which requires particularly<br>
low outlay in structural and production terms and in which a<br>
purification of the fuel gas of the fossil fuel is ensured<br>
particularly reliably,<br>
before these leave the steam generator on the outlet side.<br>
This object is achieved, according to the invention, in that the<br>
combustion chamber of the steam generator comprises a number of<br>
burners arranged level with the horizontal gas flue, the vertical<br>
gas flue being designed for an approximately vertical flow of the<br>
flue gas from the bottom upward and the nitrogen removal device<br>
for fuel gas being designed for an approximately vertical flow of<br>
the fuel gas from the top downward.<br>
The invention proceeds from the notion that a steam generator<br>
capable of being erected at a particularly low outlay in<br>
production and assembly terms should have a suspension structure<br>
capable of being produced by simple means. A framework, to be<br>
erected at a comparatively low technical outlay, for the<br>
suspension of the combustion chamber may at the same time be<br>
accompanied by a particularly low overall height of the steam<br>
generator. A particularly low overall height of the steam<br>
generator can be achieved by the combustion chamber being designed<br>
in a horizontal form of construction. For this purpose, the<br>
burners are arranged, level with the horizontal gas flue, in the<br>
combustion chamber wall. Thus, when the steam generator is in<br>
operation, the flue gas flows through the combustion chamber in an<br>
approximately horizontal direction.<br>
For a particularly reliable purification of the fuel gas of the<br>
fossil fuel, the nitrogen removal device for fuel gas should be<br>
arranged downstream of the vertical gas flue on the outlet side.<br>
To be precise, downstream of the vertical gas flue on the outlet<br>
side, the fuel gas has temperatures at which a purification of the<br>
fuel gas takes place particularly effectively at a low technical<br>
outlay. It must be remembered, in this case,<br>
that, for a particularly low overall height of the steam<br>
generator, the nitrogen removal device for fuel gas should be<br>
designed for an approximately vertical flow of the fuel gas from<br>
the top downward. It is thereby possible for the liquid necessary<br>
in the SCR method, together with ammonia fractions, to be injected<br>
in the main flow direction<br>
of the fuel gas, with the result that the nitrogen removal device<br>
has a particularly small vertical extent.<br>
However, in a steam generator with a combustion chamber, through<br>
which fuel gas can flow in an approximately horizontal main flow<br>
direction, the fuel gases, after leaving the horizontal gas flue,<br>
flow downward in the vertical gas flue. In order to cause the fuel<br>
gas to flow approximately vertically from the top downward in the<br>
nitrogen removal device for fuel gas, it is therefore necessary to<br>
have a duct for the fuel gas, in which the fuel gas is guided from<br>
the bottom upward downstream of the vertical gas flue on the<br>
outlet side, in order then to enter the nitrogen removal device<br>
for fuel gas, through which said fuel gas is capable of flowing<br>
from the top downward. This additional duct is not necessary when<br>
the vertical gas flue is designed for an approximately vertical<br>
flow of the fuel gas from the bottom upward and the nitrogen<br>
removal device provided for the fuel gas is designed for an<br>
approximately vertical flow of the fuel gas from the top downward.<br>
Advantageously, the purified flue gas leaving the nitrogen removal<br>
device for fuel gas can be used for the heating of air in an air<br>
preheater. The air preheater should in this case be arranged<br>
directly below the nitrogen removal device for fuel gas in a<br>
particularly space-saving way. The preheated air is to be supplied<br>
to the burners of the steam generator for the combustion of the<br>
fossil fuel. When hot air, in contrast to cold air, is supplied to<br>
the burners during the combustion of the fossil fuel, the overall<br>
efficiency of the steam generator rises.<br>
The nitrogen removal device for fuel gas advantageously comprises<br>
a DeNOx catalyst. This is because a reduction<br>
in the nitrogen oxides of the fuel gas leaving the steam generator<br>
can then be carried out in a particularly simple way, for example<br>
by means of the method of selective catalytic reduction.<br>
The containment walls of the combustion chamber are advantageously<br>
formed from vertically arranged evaporator tubes which are welded<br>
to one another in a gastight manner and a number of which are in<br>
each case capable of being acted upon in parallel by flow medium.<br>
Advantageously, one containment wall of the combustion chamber is<br>
the end wall and two containment walls of the combustion chamber<br>
are the side walls, the side walls in each case being subdivided<br>
into a first group and a second group of evaporator tubes, the end<br>
wall and the first group of evaporator tubes being capable of<br>
being acted upon in parallel by flow medium and, on the flow-<br>
medium side, preceding the second group of evaporator tubes<br>
capable of being acted upon in parallel by flow medium. A<br>
particularly favorable cooling of the end wall is thereby ensured.<br>
Advantageously, the evaporator tubes capable in each case of being<br>
acted upon in parallel by flow medium are, on the flow-medium<br>
side, preceded by a common inlet header system and followed by a<br>
common outlet header system. A steam generator designed in this<br>
configuration allows reliable pressure compensation between the<br>
parallel-connected evaporator tubes and therefore a particularly<br>
favorable distribution of the flow medium during the flow through<br>
the evaporator tubes.<br>
In a further advantageous refinement, the tube inside diameter of<br>
a number of the evaporator tubes of the combustion chamber is<br>
selected as a function of the respective position of the<br>
evaporator tubes in the combustion chamber- The evaporator tubes<br>
in the combustion chamber can thereby be adapted to a heating<br>
profile predeterminable on the gas side. By the influence brought<br>
about thereby on the flow through the evaporator tubes,<br>
temperature differences at the outlet<br>
of the evaporator tubes of the combustion chamber are kept low in<br>
a particularly reliable way.<br>
For a particularly good transmission of the heat of the combustion<br>
chamber to the flow medium guided in the evaporator tubes, a<br>
number of the evaporator tubes advantageously have on their inside<br>
in each case ribs forming a multiflight thread. In this case,<br>
advantageously, a pitch angle a between a plane perpendicular to<br>
the tube axis and the flanks of the ribs arranged on the tube<br>
inside is smaller than 60Â°, preferably smaller than 55Â°.<br>
To be precise, in a heated evaporator tube designed as an<br>
evaporator tube without internal ribbing, what may be referred to<br>
as a smooth tube, the wetting of the tube wall, necessary for a<br>
particularly good heat transmission, can no longer be maintained<br>
beyond a specific steam content. In the absence of wetting, there<br>
may be a tube wall which is dry at particular points. The<br>
transition to a dry tube wall of this type leads to a kind of heat<br>
transmission crisis with an impaired heat transmission behavior,<br>
so that, in general, the tube-wall temperatures at this point rise<br>
particularly sharply. In an internally ribbed tube, however, as<br>
compared with a smooth tube, this heat transmission crisis occurs<br>
only in the case of a steam mass content &gt; 0.9, that is to say<br>
just before the end of evaporation. This is attributable to the<br>
swirl which the flow experiences due to the spiral ribs. By virtue<br>
of the differing centrifugal force, the water fraction is<br>
separated from the steam fraction and is pressed onto the tube<br>
wall. The wetting of the tube wall is thereby maintained up to<br>
high steam contents, so that high flow velocities prevail even at<br>
the location of the heat transmission crisis. This gives rise,<br>
despite the heat transmission crisis, to a good heat transmission<br>
and, consequently, to low tube-wall temperatures.<br>
A number of the evaporator tubes of the combustion<br>
chamber advantageously have means for reducing the throughflow of<br>
the flow medium. In this case, it proves to be particularly<br>
beneficial if the means are designed as throttle devices. Throttle<br>
devices may, for example, be fittings<br>
which are built into the evaporator tubes and which reduce the<br>
tube inside diameter at a point within the respective evaporator<br>
tube.<br>
In this case, it also proves advantageous to have means for<br>
reducing the throughflow in a line system which comprises a<br>
plurality of parallel lines and through which flow medium can be<br>
supplied to the evaporator tubes of the combustion chamber. At the<br>
same time, the line system may also precede an inlet header system<br>
of parallel evaporator tubes capable of being acted upon by flow<br>
medium. In this case, for example, throttle fittings may be<br>
provided in one line or in a plurality of lines of the line<br>
system. By such means for reducing the throughflow of the flow<br>
medium through the evaporator tubes, the throughput of the flow<br>
medium through individual evaporator tubes can be adapted to the<br>
respective heating of these in the combustion chamber. As a<br>
result, in addition, temperature differences of the flow medium at<br>
the outlet of the evaporator tubes can be kept particularly low in<br>
a particularly reliable way.<br>
The side walls of the horizontal gas flue and/or of the vertical<br>
gas flue are advantageously formed from vertically arranged steam<br>
generator tubes which are welded to one another in a gastight<br>
manner and a number of which are in each case capable of being<br>
acted upon in parallel by flow medium.<br>
Adjacent evaporator or steam generator tubes are advantageously<br>
welded to one another in a gastight manner via metal bands, what<br>
may be referred to as fins. The fin width influences the<br>
introduction of heat into the steam generator tubes. The fin width<br>
is therefore adapted, preferably as a function of the position of<br>
the respective evaporator or steam<br>
generator tubes in the steam generator, to a heating and/or<br>
temperature profile predeterminable on the gas side. In this case,<br>
the predetermined heating and/or temperature profile may be a<br>
typical heating and/or temperature profile determined from<br>
empirical values or else a rough<br>
estimation, such as, for example, a stepped heating and/or<br>
temperature profile. By means of the suitably selected fin widths,<br>
it is possible, even in the case of widely varying heating of<br>
different evaporator or steam generator tubes, to achieve an<br>
introduction of heat into all the evaporator or steam generator<br>
tubes, in such a way that temperature differences at the outlet of<br>
the evaporator or steam generator tubes are kept particularly low.<br>
Premature material fatigues are reliably prevented in this way.<br>
The steam generator consequently has a particularly long useful<br>
life.<br>
The horizontal gas flue advantageously has arranged in it a number<br>
of superheater heating surfaces, the tubes of which are arranged<br>
approximately transversely to the main flow direction of the fuel<br>
gas and are connected in parallel for a throughflow of the flow<br>
medium. These superheater heating surfaces, arranged in a<br>
suspended form of a construction and also designated as bulkhead<br>
heating surfaces, are heated predominantly convectively and follow<br>
the evaporator tubes of the combustion chamber on the flow-medium<br>
side. A particularly beneficial utilization of the fuel-gas heat<br>
is thereby ensured.<br>
Advantageously, the vertical gas flue has a number of convection<br>
heating surfaces which are formed from tubes arranged<br>
approximately transversely to the main flow direction of the fuel<br>
gas. The tubes of a convection heating surface are in this case<br>
connected in parallel for a throughflow of the flow medium. These<br>
convection heating surfaces, too, are heated predominantly<br>
convectively.<br>
In order, furthermore, to ensure a particularly full utilization<br>
of the heat of the fuel gas, the vertical gas flue advantageously<br>
has economizer.<br>
Advantageously, the burners are arranged on the end wall of the<br>
combustion chamber, that is to say on that containment wall of the<br>
combustion chamber which is located opposite the outflow orifice<br>
to the horizontal gas flue.<br>
A steam generator designed in this way can be adapted particularly<br>
simply to the burnup length of the fuel. The burnup length of the<br>
fossil fuel is understood as meaning, in this context, the fuel-<br>
gas velocity in the horizontal direction at a specific mean fuel-<br>
gas temperature, multiplied by the burnup time tA of the fossil<br>
fuel. The maximum burnup length for the respective steam generator<br>
is obtained in this case at the steam power output of the steam<br>
generator under full load, what may be referred to as full-load<br>
operation of the steam generator. The burnup time tA, in turn, is<br>
the time which, for example, a coal dust grain requires in order<br>
to burn up completely at a specific mean fuel-gas temperature.<br>
In order to keep material damage and undesirable contamination of<br>
the horizontal gas flue, for example due to the introduction of<br>
molten ash at high temperature, particularly low, the length L of<br>
the combustion chamber, defined by the distance between the end<br>
wall and the inlet region of the horizontal gas flue, is<br>
advantageously at least equal to the burnup length of the fuel<br>
during full-load operation of the steam generator. This length L<br>
of the combustion chamber will generally be greater than the<br>
height of the combustion chamber, measured from the funnel top<br>
edge to the combustion chamber ceiling.<br>
In an advantageous refinement, for the particularly favorable<br>
utilization of the combustion heat of the fossil fuel, the length<br>
L (given in m) of the combustion chamber is selected as a function<br>
of the BMCR value W (given in kg/s) of the steam generator, the<br>
burnup time tA (given in s) of the fuel and the outlet temperature<br>
Tbrk (given in Â°C) of the fuel gas from the combustion chamber.<br>
BMCR stands for boiler maximum continuous rating and gives the<br>
term conventionally used internationally for the maximum<br>
continuous power output of a steam generator. This also<br>
corresponds to the design power output, that is to say the power<br>
output during full-load operation of the steam generator. In this<br>
case, with a given BMCR value W of the steam generator,<br>
approximately the higher value of the two functions (I) and (II)<br>
applies to the length L of the combustion chamber:<br>
"Approximately" is understood to mean in this case a permissible<br>
deviation of +20%/-10% from the value defined by the respective<br>
function.<br>
The advantages achieved by means of the invention are, in<br>
particular, that the steam generator has a particularly low space<br>
requirement on account of the horizontal combustion chamber and of<br>
the vertical gas flue designed for an approximately vertical flow<br>
direction of the fuel gas from the bottom upward. This<br>
particularly compact form of construction of the steam generator<br>
makes it possible, when the steam generator is incorporated into a<br>
steam turbine plant, to have particularly short connecting tubes<br>
from the steam generator to the steam turbine.<br>
An exemplary embodiment of the invention is explained in more<br>
detail by means of drawing in which:<br>
fig. 1 shows diagrammatically a side view of a fossil-fired<br>
steam generator of the dual-flue type, and<br>
fig. 2 shows diagrammatically a longitudinal section through an<br>
individual evaporator tube, and<br>
fig. 3 shows a coordinate system with the curves K1 to K6.<br>
Parts corresponding to one another are given the same reference<br>
symbols in all the figures.<br>
The steam generator 2 according to figure 1 is assigned to a power<br>
plant, not illustrated in any more detail, which also comprises a<br>
steam turbine plant. The steam generated in the steam generator 2<br>
is in this case used for driving the steam turbine which itself,<br>
in turn, drives a generator for current generation. The current<br>
generated by the generator is in this case provided for feeding<br>
into an interconnected or an island network. Furthermore, a<br>
branch-off of a part quantity of the steam may also be provided<br>
for feeding into an external process which is connected to the<br>
steam turbine plant and which may also be a heating process.<br>
The fossil-fired steam generator 2 is advantageously designed as a<br>
continuous-flow steam generator. It comprises a combustion chamber<br>
4 which is designed in a horizontal form of construction and which<br>
is followed on the fuel-gas side, via a horizontal gas flue 6, by<br>
a vertical gas flue 8. The lower region of the combustion chamber<br>
4 is formed by a funnel 5 with a top edge corresponding to the<br>
subsidiary line having the end points X and Y. By means of the<br>
funnel 5, when the steam generator 2 is in operation, ash from the<br>
fossil flue B can be discharged into an ash removal device 7<br>
arranged below said funnel. The containment walls 9 of the<br>
combustion chamber 4 are formed from vertically arranged<br>
evaporator tubes 10 welded to one another in a gastight manner. In<br>
this case, one containment wall 9 is the end wall 9A and two<br>
containment walls 9 are the side walls 9B of the combustion<br>
chamber 4 of the steam generator 2. Only one of the two side walls<br>
9B can be seen in the side view, shown in figure 1, of the steam<br>
generator 2. The evaporator tubes 10 of the side walls 9B of the<br>
combustion chamber 4 are subdivided into a first group 11A and a<br>
second group 11B. The evaporator tubes 10 of the end wall 9A and<br>
the first group 11A of the evaporator tubes 10<br>
are capable of being acted upon in parallel by flow medium S. The<br>
second group 11B of the evaporator tubes 10 is also capable of<br>
being acted upon in parallel by flow medium S. In order to achieve<br>
a particularly favorable throughflow characteristic of the flow<br>
medium S through the containment walls 9 of the combustion chamber<br>
4 and, consequently, a particularly good utilization of the<br>
combustion heat of the fossil fuel B, the evaporator tubes 10 of<br>
the end wall 9A and of the first group HA precede the evaporator<br>
tubes 10 of the second group 11B on the flow-medium side.<br>
The side walls 12 of the horizontal gas flue 6 and/or the side<br>
walls 14 of the vertical gas flue 8 are also formed from<br>
vertically arranged steam generator tubes 16 and 17 welded to one<br>
another in a gastight manner. At the same time, a number of the<br>
steam generator tubes 16, 17 can in this case be acted upon in<br>
parallel by flow medium S.<br>
The end face 9A and the first group 11A of the evaporator tubes 10<br>
of the combustion chamber 4 are, on the flow-medium side, preceded<br>
by a common inlet header system 18A for flow medium S and followed<br>
by an outlet header system 20A. Likewise, the second group 11B of<br>
the side walls 9B of the evaporator tubes 10 are, on the flow-<br>
medium side, preceded by a common inlet header system 18B for the<br>
flow medium S and followed by an outlet header system 20B. The<br>
inlet header systems 18A and 18B at the same time in each case<br>
comprise a number of parallel inlet headers.<br>
A line system 19A is provided for feeding flow medium S into the<br>
inlet header system 18A of the end face 9A of the combustion<br>
chamber 4 and of the first group 11A of the evaporator tubes 10 of<br>
the side walls 9B of the combustion chamber 4. The line system 19A<br>
comprises a plurality of parallel-connected lines which are<br>
connected in each case to one of the inlet headers of the inlet<br>
header system 18A. The outlet header system 20A is connected on<br>
the outlet side to a line system 19B which is provided for feeding<br>
flow medium S into the<br>
inlet headers of the inlet header system 18B of the second group<br>
11B of the evaporator tubes 10 of the side walls 9B of the<br>
combustion chamber 4.<br>
In the same way, the steam generator tubes 16, capable of being<br>
acted upon in parallel by the flow medium S, of the side walls 12<br>
of the horizontal gas flue 6 are preceded by a common inlet header<br>
system 21 and followed by a common outlet header system 22. In<br>
this case, a line system 25 is provided for feeding flow medium S<br>
into the inlet header system 21 of the steam generator tubes 16.<br>
Here, too, the line system 25 comprises a plurality of parallel-<br>
connected lines which are connected in each case to one of the<br>
inlet headers of the inlet header system 21. The line system 25 is<br>
connected on the inlet side to the outlet header system 20B of the<br>
second group 11B of the evaporator tubes 10 of the side walls 9A<br>
of the combustion chamber 4. The heated flow medium S leaving the<br>
combustion chamber 4 is therefore guided into the side walls 12 of<br>
the horizontal gas flue 6.<br>
This configuration of the continuous-flow steam generator 2, with<br>
inlet header systems 18A, 18B and 21 and outlet header systems<br>
20A, 20B and 22, makes it possible to have particularly reliable<br>
pressure compensation between the parallel-connected evaporator<br>
tubes 10 of the combustion chamber 4 or the parallel-connected<br>
steam generator tubes 16 of the horizontal gas flue 6, in that, in<br>
each case, all the parallel-connected evaporator or steam<br>
generator tubes 10 and 16 have the same overall pressure loss.<br>
This means that, in the case of an evaporator tube 10 or steam<br>
generator tube 16 heated to a greater extent, the throughput must<br>
rise, as compared with an evaporator tube 10 or a steam generator<br>
tube 16 heated to a lesser extent.<br>
As illustrated in figure 2, the evaporator tubes 10 have, on their<br>
inside, ribs 40 which form a type of multiflight thread and have a<br>
rib height R.<br>
In this case, the pitch angle a between a plane 42 perpendicular<br>
to the tube axis and the flanks 44 of the ribs 40 arranged on the<br>
tube inside is smaller than 55Â°. As a result, particularly high<br>
heat transmission from the inner wall of the evaporator tubes to<br>
the flow medium S guided in the evaporator tubes 10, at the same<br>
time with particularly low temperatures of the tube wall, is<br>
achieved.<br>
The tube inside diameter D of the evaporator tubes 10 of the<br>
combustion chamber 4 is selected as a function of the respective<br>
position of the evaporator tubes 10 in the combustion chamber 4.<br>
The steam generator 2 is thereby adapted to the different amounts<br>
of heating of the evaporator tubes 10. This design of the<br>
evaporator tubes 10 of the combustion chamber 4 ensures<br>
particularly reliably that temperature differences at the outlet<br>
of the evaporator tubes 10 are kept particularly low.<br>
Adjacent evaporator or steam generator tubes 10, 16, 17 are welded<br>
to one another in a gastight manner via fins in a way not<br>
illustrated in any more detail. To be precise, the heating of the<br>
evaporator or steam generator tubes 10, 16, 17 can be influenced<br>
by suitable choice of the fin width. The respective fin width is<br>
therefore adapted to a heating profile which is predeterminable on<br>
the gas side and which depends on the position of the respective<br>
evaporator or steam generator tubes 10, 16, 17 in the steam<br>
generator. The heating profile may in this case be a typical<br>
heating profile determined from empirical values or else a rough<br>
estimation. As a result, even in the case of widely differing<br>
heating of the evaporator or steam generator tubes 10, 16, 17,<br>
temperature differences at the outlet of the evaporator or steam<br>
generator tubes 10, 16, 17 are kept particularly low. Material<br>
fatigues are thereby reliably prevented, thus ensuring that the<br>
steam generator 2 has a long useful life.<br>
As means for reducing the throughflow of the flow medium S, some<br>
of the evaporator tubes 10 are equipped with throttle devices<br>
which are not illustrated in any more detail in the drawing.<br>
The throttle devices are designed as perforated diaphragms<br>
reducing the tube inside diameter D and, when the steam generator<br>
2 is in operation, bring about a reduction in the throughput of<br>
the flow medium S in evaporator tubes 10 heated to a lesser<br>
extent, with the result that the throughput of the flow medium S<br>
is adapted to the heating. Furthermore, as a means for reducing<br>
the throughput of the flow medium S in the evaporator tubes 10 of<br>
the combustion chamber 4, one or more lines of the line system 19<br>
or 25 are equipped with throttle devices, in particular throttle<br>
fittings, this not being illustrated in any more detail in the<br>
drawing.<br>
In the tubing of the combustion chamber 4, it must be remembered<br>
that the heating of the individual evaporator tubes 10 welded to<br>
one another in a gastight manner differs greatly when the steam<br>
generator 2 is in operation. Consequently, the design of the<br>
evaporator tubes 10 in terms of their internal ribbing, fin<br>
connection to adjacent evaporator tubes 10 and their tube inside<br>
diameter D is selected such that, in spite of different heating,<br>
all the evaporator tubes 10 have approximately the same outlet<br>
temperatures of the flow medium S and sufficient cooling of all<br>
the evaporator tubes 10 is ensured for all the operating states of<br>
the steam generator 2.<br>
These properties of the steam generator are ensured, in<br>
particular, when the steam generator 2 is designed for a<br>
comparatively low mass flow density of the flow medium S flowing<br>
through the evaporator tubes 10. What is achieved, moreover, by a<br>
suitable choice of the fin connections and of the tube inside<br>
diameters D is that the fraction of frictional pressure loss in<br>
the overall pressure loss is so small that a natural circulation<br>
behavior is established: evaporator tubes 10 heated to a greater<br>
extent have a higher throughflow than<br>
evaporator tubes 10 heated to a lesser extent. What is also<br>
achieved thereby is that the evaporator tubes 10 heated to a<br>
comparatively greater extent and located in the burner vicinity<br>
absorb specifically, with respect to the mass flow, approximately<br>
as much heat as<br>
the evaporator tubes 10 heated to a comparatively lesser extent,<br>
which, in comparison with them, are arranged nearer to the<br>
combustion chamber end. A further measure for adapting the<br>
throughflow of the evaporator tubes 10 of the combustion chamber 4<br>
to the heating is for throttles to be built into some of the<br>
evaporator tubes 10 or into some of the lines of the line system<br>
19. The internal ribbing is in this case designed in such a way<br>
that sufficient cooling of the evaporator tube walls is ensured.<br>
Thus, by means of the abovementioned measures, all the evaporator<br>
tubes 10 have approximately the same outlet temperatures of the<br>
flow medium S.<br>
The horizontal gas flue 6 has a number of superheater heating<br>
surfaces 23 which are designed as bulkhead heating surfaces and<br>
are arranged in a suspended form of construction approximately<br>
perpendicularly to the main flow direction 24 of the fuel gas G<br>
and the tubes of which are in each case connected in parallel for<br>
a throughflow of the flow medium S. The superheater heating<br>
surfaces 23 are heated predominantly convectively and follow the<br>
evaporator tubes 10 of the combustion chamber 4 on the flow-medium<br>
side.<br>
The vertical gas flue 8 through which fuel gas G is capable of<br>
flowing from the bottom upward has a number of convection heating<br>
surfaces 26 which are capable of being heated predominantly<br>
convectively and are formed from tubes arranged approximately<br>
perpendicularly to the main flow direction 24 of the fuel gas G.<br>
These tubes are in each case connected in parallel for a<br>
throughflow of the flow medium S and are integrated into the path<br>
of the flow medium S, this not being illustrated in any more<br>
detail in the drawing. Moreover, an economizer 28 is arranged in<br>
the vertical gas flue 8 above the convection heating surfaces 26.<br>
The economizer 28 is connected on the outlet side, via<br>
a line system 19, to the inlet header system 18 assigned to the<br>
evaporator tubes 10. In this case, one or more lines of the line<br>
system 24, which are not illustrated in any more detail in the<br>
drawing, may have throttle fittings in order to reduce the<br>
throughflow of the flow medium s.<br>
The vertical gas flue 8, through which fuel gas G is capable of<br>
flowing from the bottom upward in an approximately vertical main<br>
flow direction 24, is followed, on the outlet side, by a short<br>
connecting duct 50. The connecting duct 50 connects the vertical<br>
gas flue 8 to a housing 52. A nitrogen removal device 54 for fuel<br>
gas G is arranged on the inlet side in the housing 52. The<br>
nitrogen removal device 54 for fuel gas G is connected to an air<br>
preheater 60 via a feed 56. The air preheater 60, in turn, is<br>
connected to an electronic filter 62 via a smoke-gas duct 62.<br>
The nitrogen removal device 54 for fuel gas G is operated<br>
according to the method of selective catalytic reduction, what may<br>
be referred to as the SCR method. During the catalytic<br>
purification of the fuel gas G of the steam generator 2 according<br>
to the SCR method, nitrogen oxides (NO2) are reduced to nitrogen<br>
(N2) and water (H2O) with the aid of a catalyst and a reducing<br>
agent, for example ammonia.<br>
To carry out the SCR method, the nitrogen removal device 54 for<br>
fuel gas G comprises a catalyst designed as a DeNOx catalyst 64.<br>
The DeNOx catalyst is arranged in the flow region of the fuel gas<br>
G. To introduce ammonia water as reducing agent M into the fuel<br>
gas G, the nitrogen removal device 54 for fuel gas G has a<br>
metering system 66. In this case, the metering system 66 comprises<br>
a storage vessel 68 for ammonia water and a compressed-air system<br>
69. The metering system 66 is arranged above the DeNOx catalyst 64<br>
in the nitrogen removal device 54.<br>
A steam generator 2 is designed with a horizontal combustion<br>
chamber 4 having a particularly low overall height and can thus be<br>
erected at a particularly low outlay in production and assembly<br>
terms. For this purpose, the combustion chamber 4 of the steam<br>
generator 2 has a number of burners 70 for fossil fuel B, which<br>
are arranged, level with the horizontal gas flue 6, on the end<br>
wall 11 of the combustion chamber 4.<br>
So that the fossil fuel B, for example coal in solid form, burns<br>
up particularly completely in order to achieve particularly high<br>
efficiency and material damage to the first superheater heating<br>
surface 23, as seen on the fuel-gas side,, of the horizontal gas<br>
flue 6 and contamination of this, for example due to the<br>
introduction of molten ash at high temperature, are prevented in a<br>
particularly reliable way, the length L of the combustion chamber<br>
4 is selected such that it exceeds the burnup length of the fuel B<br>
during full-load operation of the steam generator 2. The length L<br>
is in this case the distance from the end wall 9A of the<br>
combustion chamber 4 to the inlet region 72 of the horizontal gas<br>
flue 6. The burnup length of the fuel B is in this case defined as<br>
the fuel-gas velocity in the horizontal direction at a specific<br>
mean fuel-gas temperature, multiplied by the burnup time tA of the<br>
fossil fuel B. The maximum burnup length for the respective steam<br>
generator 2 is obtained during full-load operation of the steam<br>
generator 2. The burnup time tA of the fuel B is, in turn, the time<br>
which, for example, a coal dust grain of average size requires to<br>
burn up completely at a specific mean fuel-gas temperature.<br>
In order to ensure particularly favorable utilization of the<br>
combustion heat of the fossil fuel B, the length L (given in m) of<br>
the combustion chamber 4 is suitably selected as a function of the<br>
outlet temperature of the fuel gas G from the combustion chamber 4<br>
TARK (given in Â°C), of the burnup time tR (given in s) of the fuel B<br>
and of the BMCR value W (given in kg/s) of the steam generator 2.<br>
In this context, BMCR stands for boiler maximum continuous rating.<br>
The BMCR value W is a term conventionally used internationally for<br>
the maximum continuous power output of a steam generator. This<br>
also corresponds to the design power output, that is to say to the<br>
power output during full-load operation of the<br>
steam generator. This horizontal length L of the combustion<br>
chamber 4 is in this case greater than the height H of the<br>
combustion chamber 4. The height H is in this case measured from<br>
the funnel top edge of the combustion chamber 4, marked in<br>
figure 1 by the subsidiary line having the end points X and Y,<br>
to the combustion chamber ceiling. In this case, the length L of<br>
the combustion chamber 4 is determined approximately via the two<br>
functions (I) and (II)<br>
"Approximately" in this case is understood to mean a permissible<br>
deviation of +20%/-10% from the value defined by the respective<br>
function. At the same time, in the case of an arbitrary, but fixed<br>
BMCR value W of the steam generator, the higher value of the<br>
functions (1) and (II) always applies to the length L of the<br>
combustion chamber 4.<br>
As an example of a calculation of the length L of the combustion<br>
chamber 4 as a function of the BMCR value W of the steam generator<br>
2, six curves Ki to K^ are depicted in the coordinate system<br>
according to figure 3. Here, the curves are in each case assigned<br>
the following parameters:<br>
Thus, for example for a burnup time tR = 3s and an<br>
outlet temperature TBRK = 1200Â°C of the fuel gas G from the<br>
combustion chamber 4, the curves K1 and K4 are to be used to<br>
determine the length L of the combustion chamber 4.<br>
This results, in the case of a predetermined BMCR value W of the<br>
steam generator 2<br>
of W = 80 kg/s, in a length of L = 29 m according to K4,<br>
of W = 160 kg/s, in a length of L = 34 m according to K4,<br>
of W = 560 kg/s, in a length of L = 57 m according to K4.<br>
For example, the curves K2 and K5 are to be used for the burnup time<br>
TA = 2.5s and the outlet temperature of the fuel gas G from the<br>
combustion chamber TBRK = 1300Â°C. This results, in the case of a<br>
predetermined BMCR value W of the steam generator 2<br>
of W = 80 kg/s, in a length of 1 = 21 m according to K2,<br>
of W = 180 kg/s, in a length of L = 23 m according to K2 and K5,<br>
of W = 560 kg/s, in a length of L = 37 m according to K5.<br>
The burnup time tA = 2s and the outlet temperature of the fuel gas G<br>
from the combustion chamber Tbrk = 1400Â°C are assigned, for example,<br>
to the curves K5 and K6. This results, in the case of a predetermined<br>
BMCR value W of the steam generator 2<br>
of W = 80 kg/s, in a length of L = 18 m according to K3,<br>
of W = 465 kg/s, in a length of 1 = 21 m according to K3 and K6,<br>
of W = 560 kg/s, in a length of L = 23 m according to K6.<br>
When the steam generator 2 is in operation, fossil fuel B and air are<br>
supplied to the burners 70. The air is in this case preheated in the<br>
air preheater by means of the residual heat of the fuel gas G and<br>
then, this not being illustrated in any more detail in the drawing,<br>
is compressed and supplied to the burner 70. The flames F of the<br>
burners 70 are in this case oriented horizontally. By virtue of the<br>
form of construction of the combustion chamber 4, a flow of the fuel<br>
gas G occurring during<br>
combustion is generated in the approximately horizontal main flow<br>
direction 24.<br>
The fuel gas G passes, via the horizontal gas flue 6, into the<br>
vertical gas flue 8 through which fuel gas 6 is capable of flowing<br>
from the bottom upward.<br>
Downstream of the vertical gas flue 8 on the outlet side, the fuel<br>
gas G passes, via the connecting duct 50, into the nitrogen removal<br>
device 54 for fuel gas G. Via the nitrogen removal device 54 for fuel<br>
gas G, a specific quantity of ammonia water is injected as reducing<br>
agent M into the fuel gas G with the aid of compressed air as a<br>
function of the type of fuel B operating the steam generator 2. This<br>
is necessary, since the degree of separation of the nitrogen oxides<br>
(NO5) depends on the type of fossil fuel B operating the steam<br>
generator 2. A particularly reliable removal of nitrogen from the<br>
fuel gas G is thereby ensured in all the operating states of the<br>
steam generator 2.<br>
The purified fuel gas G1 leaves the nitrogen removal device 54 for<br>
fuel gas G via a feed 56 which issues into the air preheater 58. A<br>
preheating of the air to be supplied to the burners 70 for the<br>
combustion of the fossil fuel B takes place Â±n the air preheater 58.<br>
The fuel gas G leaves the air preheater 58 via the smoke-gas duct 60<br>
and passes via the electronic filter 62 into the environment-<br>
Flow medium S entering the economizer 28 passes via the line system<br>
19A into the inlet header system 18A which is assigned to the end<br>
wall 9A and to the evaporator tubes 10 of the first group 11A of the<br>
side walls 9B of the combustion chamber 4 of the steam generator 2.<br>
The steam or a water/steam mixture occurring in the vertically<br>
arranged evaporator tubes 10 of the combustion chamber 4 of the steam<br>
generator 2 which are welded to one another in a gastight manner is<br>
collected in the outlet header system 20A for flow medium S. The<br>
steam or the water/steam mixture passes from there, via the line<br>
system 19B, into the inlet header system 18B which is assigned to the<br>
second group 11B of the evaporator tubes 10 of the side walls 9B of<br>
the combustion chamber 4. The steam or a water/steam mixture<br>
occurring in the<br>
vertically arranged evaporator tubes 10 of the combustion chamber 4<br>
of the steam generator 2 which are welded to one another in a<br>
gastight manner is collected in the outlet header system<br>
20B for flow medium S. The steam and/or the water/steam mixture<br>
passes from there, via the line system 25, into the inlet header<br>
system 21 assigned to the steam generator tubes 16 of the side walls<br>
12 of the horizontal gas flue. The steam and/or the water/steam<br>
mixture occurring in the evaporator tubes 16 passes via the outlet<br>
header system 22 into the walls of the vertical gas flue 8 and from<br>
there, in turn, into the superheater heating surfaces 23 of the<br>
horizontal gas flue 6. In the superheater heating surfaces 23,<br>
further superheating of the steam takes place, the latter<br>
subsequently being supplied for utilization, for example for driving<br>
a steam turbine.<br>
In the steam generator 2, the selection of the length L of the<br>
combustion chamber 4 as a function of the BMCR value W of the steam<br>
generator 2 ensures that the combustion heat, of the fossil fuel B is<br>
utilized particularly reliably. Moreover, the steam generator 2<br>
requires a particularly small amount of space on account of its<br>
horizontal combustion chamber 4 and its nitrogen removal device 54<br>
located directly downstream of the vertical gas flue 8. At the same<br>
time, a particularly reliable removal of nitrogen from the fuel gas G<br>
is ensured in a particularly simple way in all the operating states<br>
of the steam generator 2.<br>

The steam generator (2) as claimed in one of claims 1 to 15,<br>
in which a number of convection heating surfaces (52) are<br>
arranged in the vertical gas flue (8).<br>
The steam generator (2) as claimed in one of claims 1 to 16,<br>
in which an economizer (28) is<br>
arranged in the vertical gas flue (8).<br>
18. The steam generator (2) as claimed in one of claims 1 to 17,<br>
in which the burners (70) are arranged on the end wall (9A) of<br>
the combustion chamber (4).<br>
19. The steam generator (2) as claimed in one of claims 1 to 18,<br>
in which the length (L) of the combustion chamber (4), defined<br>
by the distance between the end wall (9A) of the combustion<br>
chamber (4) and the inlet region (72) of the horizontal gas<br>
flue (6), is at least equal to the burnup length of the fuel<br>
(B) during full-load operation of the steam generator (2).<br>
20. The steam generator (2) as claimed in one of claims 1 to 19,<br>
in which the length (L) of the combustion chamber (4) is<br>
selected as a function of the BMCR value (W), of the burnup<br>
time (tA) of the burners (70) and/or of the outlet temperature<br>
(Tbrk) of the fuel gas (G) from the combustion chamber (4),<br>
approximately according to the two functions (I) and (II)<br>
the respectively higher value of the length (L) of the<br>
combustion chamber (4) applying to a BMCR value (W).<br>
A steam generator (2) has a nitrogen removal device for fuel gas (G)<br>
and a combustion chamber (4) which is followed on the fuel-gas side,<br>
via a horizontal gas flue (6) and a vertical gas flue (8), by the<br>
nitrogen removal device (54) for fuel gas (G). The steam generator is<br>
to have a particularly low space requirement and ensure particularly<br>
reliably a removal of nitrogen from the fuel gases (G) of the fossil<br>
fuel (B). For this purpose, the combustion chamber has a number of<br>
burners (70) arranged level with the horizontal gas flue (6).<br>
Moreover, the vertical gas flue (8) is designed for an approximately<br>
vertical flow of the fuel gas (G) from the bottom upward and the<br>
nitrogen removal device (54) for fuel gas (G) is designed for an<br>
approximately vertical flow of the fuel gas (G) from the top<br>
downward.</td>
