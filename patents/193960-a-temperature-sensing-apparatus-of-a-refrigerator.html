				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a temperature sensing apparatus of a refrigerator which accurately senses a temperature of foods received between the respective selves in a cold-storage room and a freezing-storage room.<br>
Discussion of Related Art<br>
FIG. 1  is a constructional view of a conventional refrigerator.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a main body 1  cf a conventional refrigerator composed of a freezing-storage room 2 and a cold-storage room 3 compises a cold air divider 4 established on an entrance inflowing a cold air from the freezing-storage room 2 to the cold-storage room 3, for suppling a cold air to the cold-storage room 3.<br>
As described above, the operation of suppling and cutting off a cold air is controlled by a temperature sensor 5 of the<br>
inner of the cold-storage room 3.  That is, the cold air divider 4, as shown in Fig. 2, comprises a damper 6 on a side of a cold air inflowing way and cold air exhausting gates 7 on a side of a cold air exhausting way.  If the inner temperature of a cold storage room is over a determined temperature, the damper is closed and the cold air flow is cut zif. However, to sense the inner temperature of the cold storage room controlled by means of a conventional cold air divider 4, since the temperature sensor 5 attached to a constant position in the refrigerator accurately doesn't sense the temperature of a cold storage food and the inner temperature between the respective selves of the cold storage room, and sense only the scope of the portion on which the temperature  sensor 5 is established, there was a problem that a cold air supply isn't suitably performed.<br>
SUMMARY OF	THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, examples of which are<br>
illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
FIG. 3 is a constructional view showing an embodiment of<br>
a temperature sensing apparatus of a refrigerator according to<br>
the present invention.<br>
FIG. 4 is a constructional view of a controller of a<br>
refrigerator to which an apparatus according to the present<br>
invention is applied.<br>
FIGS. 5A and 5B are front and side views snowing a construction of a temperature sensor transfer apparatus of according to the present invention.<br>
The temperature sensing apparatus of a refrigerator of the invention is composed of a damper c, a cold air divider for opening and closing a cold air exhausting gate according to the temperature sensing of a sersor of a cold storage room, a temperature sensor transfer means 10, a temperature sensor 5 of a cold storage room on the transfer means 10, a temperature sensor transfer motor 11 for driving the transfer means 10 which is established under a transfer screw, and a direction converting guide member 12 for converting a measuring direction of the temperature sensor 5 into right and left.<br>
The temperature sensor 5 as described above uses a noncontact temperature sensor, the transfer motor 11 of the temperature sensor uses a stepping motor, the direction converting guide member 12 is a zigzag shape to move the sensor 5 in the direction of right and left at one same time with moving up and down.<br>
In addition, the temperature sensor 5 is fixed on a temperature sensor equipping means 8, the equipping means 8 is fixed on the transfer member 10, a converter 9 coupled with the equipping means 8 is fixed to slide on the direction<br>
converting guide member 12.<br>
At this time, the temperature sensor equipping means 8 is coupled with the transfer member 10, the converter 9 is inserted to slide on a guide groove (not shown') formed on the direction converting guide member 12.<br>
That is, the sensor equipping means 8 has a sensor equipping groove! not shown; m which the sensor 5 is fitted on the front thereof, a fixed member (not shown) in which the transfer screw 10 is inserted on the center thereof.  An internal screw (not shown) coupled with the transfer screw is formed on the fixed member, a groove which the converter 9 is guided is formed on the direction converting guide member, and on the transfer screw, a external screw ( not sncwn &gt; coupled with the internal screw of the temperature sensor equipping means is formed.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, a controller of a refrigerator of the present invention comprises a microcomputer controlling the whole system, a high temperature display portion showing an operation state ana a determined temperature of a refrigerator, a damper motor driving portion for driving a damper mctor and the damper motor o£ a driving source of the damper for inflowing and cutting off: cold air to a cold storage room, a temperature sensor transfer driving motor for<br>
driving the sensor transfer motor, a compressor for compressing refrigerant, a compressor driving portion for driving the compressor, a cooling fan generating cold air, and a cooling fan driving portion.<br>
There will be described the operation and effect of the temperature sensing apparatus of a refrigerator of the present invention as constructed above.<br>
If a sensor transfer member 10 rotates in the forward and backward by driving the transfer motor 11, an external screw of the sensor transfer is engaged with an internal screw ofthe sensor equipping means, so that the equipping means 3 moves up and down.<br>
Accordingly, the  converter 9 of the equipping repeatedly moves up and down according to a zigzag shape of the direction converting guide member 12.  As a result of moving in the direction right and left when the sensor equipping means rises and falls, it is accurate to sense the food temperature and the up and down, right and left temperature of tne inner of a cold storage room.<br>
Again, explaining the right and left moving operation of such temperature sensor, as shown in FIG. 6A, if the converter 9 of the temperature sensor equipping means 8 arrives at the center of the direction converting guide member<br>
12, the temperature sensor 5 senses the front temperature ot the inner of the cold-storage room.<br>
As shown in FIG. &gt;:b, :t the  converter arrives at tne Lett end, the sensor 5 senses the right temperature of Che cold-storage room.<br>
In addition, as shown in FIG. 6C, U one  converter 9 arrives at the right ena ct the direction converting gui.de member 12, the sensor 5 senses the left temperature m the ccic storage room.<br>
As described above, the temperature sensing apparatus of a refrigerator according to the present invention can sense the temperature of.   the received foods through tne whole range temperature in a refrigerator.   .Since the microcomputer operates the damper according to the sensea temperature,there are effects that cold- storage foods can be kept freshly by suppling cold air to the inner of the cold-storage room, and the unnecessary power is not  consumed.<br>
FIG. 7A is a waveform graph of sensing a temperature of the cold-storage room according to a conventicnui refrigerator.<br>
FIG. ^B is a waveform graph of sensing a temperature of the cold-storage room according to the present invention. As can be known above, since the temperature of the received<br>
foods and the inner temperature of a refrigerator can be accurately sensed by the temperature sensing apparatus according to the present invention, the temperature of the foods received in the determined position and the temperature of a determined position m the cold-storage room can be easily understood.<br>
FIG. 8 is a temperature sensing display view showing the temperature distribution of foods in the cold-storage room by means of such display apparatus, the temperature distribution of the foods received in a cold-storage room can be be easily known by users.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in a temperature sensing apparatus of a refrigerator of the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br>
