				<td>Termite Control<br>
The present invention is concerned with the control of harvester termites of the order Isoptera and the species Hodotermidae spp. by using bait compositions comprising agonists or antagonists of the nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects and carriers from palitable'grass or lucerne particles.<br>
The use of agonists or antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects against material damaging termites is known. But the methods useful in protecting technical material could not be used when it comes to the protection of green fields against the attack from harvester termites. Harvester termites live underground. They feed their imature stages with stuff they prepare from fermentation of parts of green plant material harvested above ground and carried underground into their rests.<br>
For this the adults forage in the surroundings of their subterraneous burrow and carry back plant parts they cut from plants they find. Thus damage is done especially to pastures, lawn, golf courses, fields etc.<br>
Conventional treatment is difficult because it would mean to treat the insects and their immature stages in their burrow. As the burrows could extend over many thousands of square meters and often beyond the area where damage is observed it is not possible to use the methods developed for combating material damaging termites.<br>
It has now been found that based upon active compounds from the agonists or antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects also known as nicotinol-compounds, mostly nitromethylene-, nitroguanidine-, cyanomethylene-, cyano-guanidine-compounds termite control could be achieved with a bait system.<br>
Subject of the present invention is<br>
1. Use of agonists or antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects in the control of harvester termites from the insect order of isoptera and species Hodotermidae spp.<br>
2.	Use of agonists or antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects<br>
in the control of harvester termites from the insect order of isoptera and<br>
species  Hodotermidae spp.  in the form of baits  comprising  the  active<br>
compounds and particles of palitable grass or lucerne and optionally usual<br>
formulating additives.<br>
3.	Use of agonists or antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects<br>
in the control of harvester termites from the insect order of isoptera and<br>
species Hodotermidae spp. in the form of bait material which is applied<br>
broadcast on the surface of the soil where the termites are foraging.<br>
4.	Bait for use of agonists or antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of<br>
insects in the control of harvester termites from the insect order of isoptera<br>
and species Hodotermidae spp. characterized that it comprises the active<br>
compounds and as carrier particles of grass or lucerne and optionally usual<br>
formulation additives.<br>
5.	Bait according to 4 characterized that it contains active compound in a con<br>
centration of 0.001-1 % by weight and the carrier in a concentration of<br>
94-99.99 % by weight and optional formulation additives up to 5 % by weight.<br>
Agonists and antagonists of nicotinergic acetylcholin receptors of insects are known compounds.<br>
They are disclosed, for example in European Offenlegungsschriften No. 464 830, 428 941, 425 978, 386 565, 383 091, 375 907, 364 844, 315 826, 259 738, 254 859, 235 725, 212 600, 192 060, 163 855, 154 178, 136 636, 303 570, 302 833, 306 696, 189972, 455000, 135956, 471 372, 302389; German OrTenlegungsschriften No. 3 639 877, 3 712 307; Japanese OrTenlegungsschriften No. 03 220 176, 02 207 083, 63 307 857, 63 287 764, 03 246 283, 04 9371, 03 279 359, 03 255 072; US Patent Specifications No. 5034524, 4948798, 4918086, 5039686, 5034404; PCT<br>

The bait formulations may be produced in known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with the carrier material, optionally with the use of additives such as surface-active agents, that is to say emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents.

As emulsifying agents there may be used non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene-fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene-fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkyl sulphonates, alkyl sulphates, aryl sulphonates as well as albumin hydrolysis products. Dispersing agents include, for example, lignin sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Adhesives such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arable, polyvinyl alcohol and poly-vinyl acetate, can be used in the formulation.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs or metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs.<br>
These additives are used in concentrations of about 0.0001-0.1 % by weight, preferably 0.001 -0.1 % by weight.<br>
Example 1<br>
A bait according to the invention is made by mixing 10 g Imidacloprid in circa 5 litres of clean water. 10 kg of dry wheat straw (length 2 cm) is spread to a thickness of circa 2 cm over a clean surface (tarpaulen ect.). The Imidacloprid/water mixture is evenly applied by means of a spray to the surface of the carrier material. Carrier material is turned and mixed and spread out again to a thickness of circa 2 cm. This procedure is repeated until the total volume of circa 5 litres of Imidacloprid/water mixture is thoroughly blended with the carrier material.<br>
