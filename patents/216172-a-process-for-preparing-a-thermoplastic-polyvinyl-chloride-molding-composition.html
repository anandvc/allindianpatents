				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to the preparation and processing of thermoplastic compositions based on vinyl chloride polymers with excellent notched impact strengths. The modification for notched Impact strength uses a shell-type graft copolymer which is in particular low in rubber and is added as a polymer latex prior to or during the polymerization of the vinyl chloride, whereupon the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) produced grafts onto the modifier latex particles. The component which improves impact strength is composed of a hard core and of a soft, rubber-like shell.<br>
The good price-performance ratio of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and its versatility in use make it one of the most widely used polymers. However, PVC on its own is too brittle for many applications, e.g. window profiles. To improve the impact strength of PVC, vinyl chloride polymers have in the past been provided with a wide variety of modifiers. Examples of these which may be mentioned are polymeric impact modifiers of butadiene type, such as acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene (ABS) and methyl methacrylate-butadiene-styrene (MBS); copolymers of ethylene with vinyl acetate (EVA); chlorinated polyolefins, such as chlorinated polyethylene (CPE); ethylene-propylene rubbers and polymers of acrylate type, such as homo- and copolymers of alkyl acrylates. The application DE 1 082 734, for example, describes a process for preparing impact-modified polyvinyl chloride. The polymer claimed is prepared by polymerizing vinyl chloride in aqueous suspension with the aid of suspension stabilizers and of organic or, respectively, inorganic activators, and the polymerization of the vinyl chloride takes place in the presence of aqueous emulsions, of polymers which have tough and resilient properties at room temperature and are present in amounts of from 2 to 25% by weight, based on solids. The polymers here may be homopolymers of acrylic or vinylic esters or, respectively, copolymers with other compounds.<br>
A disadvantage of this process is that to produce profiles a very large amount of the expensive acrylate is required to achieve sufficiently high notched impact strength in, for example, a PVC profile.<br><br>
Gratted or core-shell impact modifiers with a layer-like structure are also known   in   principle.    DE 4 302 552   describes   graft   and   core-shell copolymers with improved phase compatibility between graft base and the polymer phase grafted on. The graft and core-shell copolymers are prepared  from  a  polymer phase  a)  containing  peroxy  groups  and comprising from 0.01 to 20% by weight of a doubly olefinically unsaturated peroxy compound of the formula H2C=CH-0-C0-R^-C0-0-0-C0-R^-C0-0-CH=CH2 and contains from 80 to 99.99% by weight of one or more comonomers selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylates of alcohols having from 1  to 10 carbon atoms, vinyl esters of saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids having from 2 to  10 carbon atoms, olefins, vinylaromatics, vinyl halides and/or vinyl ethers, and from, grafted onto this, a polymer phase b) which is prepared by grafting one or more comonomers selected from the group consisting of (meth)acrylates of alcohols having from 1  to 10 carbon atoms, vinyl esters of saturated aliphatic carboxylic acids having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms, olefins, vinylaromatics, vinyl halides and styrene, and also styrene derivatives, onto the polymer phase a) containing peroxy groups. A disadvantage of this process for preparing core-shell polymers is that concomitant use of an unstable comonomer containing peroxy groups is required in order to ensure phase compatibility between polymer phases a) and b), and care has to be taken that the peroxide functions are not destroyed. The text also describes the use as an impact modifier in plastics, albeit in solid form. This, however, is another disadvantage since it necessitates an additional work-up   process,   namely   drying.   The   shell   is   moreover   used   in uncrosslinked form, and this results in some shearing away of the shell polymer during processing and is highly disadvantageous.<br>
EP 0 600 478, too, describes the preparation of a graft copolymer latex rom core-shell dispersion particles with improved phase compatibility Detween core and shell, using a two-stage emulsion polymerization )rocess. However, only crosslinked, elastomeric polymers are permissible n the first stage. In addition, the shell polymer has to have a glass ransition temperature (Tg) above 20°C, and this would have a rather idverse effect for the use as impact modifier in thermoplastics.<br>
There are also known core-shell modifiers for improving the notched npact strength of PVC which have a hard core and a soft shell made from ubber-like   material.   For   example   US 3 763 279   and   DE 3 539 414<br><br>
describe the preparation of polymer systems which have a hard, crosslinked core made from polystyrene and a soft, crosslinked polyacrylate shell. Disadvantages are firstly the relatively poor compatibility of the polystyrene core with the PVC matrix, the effect of which is especially adverse when welding PVC profiles which have been cut to the required dimensions. Secondly, these processes were optimized for transparency, and polystyrene therefore had to be used as core material. This is uneconomic, however, when transparency is not needed in the resultant semifinished product.<br>
The object was therefore to develop a process which avoids the disadvantages stated. This object has been achieved as described in the patent claims.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that improved properties can be achieved in impact-modified PVC by way of a reduced elastomer proportion in the impact modifier, which is prepared by way of a core-shell structure by replacing some of the rubber phase with a core made from cost-effective PVC.<br>
The invention provides a novel process for preparing a thermoplastic polyvinyl chloride molding composition modified with an elastomer-containing core-shell modifier with improved impact strength and comer strength and with improved optical properties, such as surface gloss, and with, at the same time, a smaller proportion of the elastomer component than in conventional single-phase impact modifiers.<br>
The core of the impact modifier is composed of polyvinyl chloride or of vinyl chloride copolymers, and the shell of the impact modifier is composed of crosslinked alkyl (meth)acrylate homo- or copolymers. The graft polymerization of the vinyl chloride monomer takes place by suspension polymerization processes known to the chemist and the engineer in the presence of the abovementioned core-shell modifier. The suspension polymerization is initiated by monomer-soluble free-radical initiators, such as those of peroxide type or azo compounds. Examples of peroxide initiators are diacyl peroxides, dialkyi peroxides, peroxydicarbonates and alkyl peresters, such as bis(2-methylbenzoyl) peroxide, di-tert-butyl peroxide, dilauroyl peroxide, acetyl benzoyl peroxide, dicumyl peroxide, diacetyl peroxydicarbonate and tert-butyl perpivalate, and an example of<br><br>
an azo initiator is azobis(isobutyronitrile). The type and amount of the initiator are selected in the usual way as in the current prior art, and mixtures of initiators may also be used here. Amounts of from 0.05 to 1% by weight of primary protective colloids, based on the total amount of the organic phase, may be added as suspending agents. Examples of these are the substantially water-soluble cellulose derivatives with viscosities (for 2% strength aqueous solutions) of from 25 to 3000 mPa-s, such as alkyl-, hydroxyalkyi-, alkylhydroxyalkyl- and carboxyalkylcellulose ethers, polyvinyl alcohol, partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetates, copolymers made from vinylpyrrolidone and from ethylenically unsaturated esters, and polyoxazolines. Known nonionic surfactants, e.g. fatty acid ethoxylates, alcohol ethoxylates, or fatty acid esters of polyols, or anionic surfactants, e.g. alkyl sulfates, alkyl- or alkylarylsulfonates, sorbitan monolaurate, or esters or half-esters of sulfosuccinic acid may also be added as suspension auxiliaries, in amounts of from 0.01 to 1.2 parts by weight, based on the total amount of the organic phase. Any other known auxiliary may also be used for carrying out the suspension polymerization (see, for example, Encylopedia of Polymer Science and Technology).<br>
The core-shell modifier is prepared by emulsion or microsuspension polymerization and by techniques known from the literature (e.g. Kunststoffhandbuch Polyvinylchlorid [Plastics Handbook-Polyvinyl Chloride], Vols. 1 &amp; 2, 2nd Edition, Carl-Hanser Verlag, 1986) to water in the presence of conventional prior-art dispersing agents and initiators, in two stages. In the first stage the PVC homo- or copolymer core is synthesized and in the second stage the elastomeric shell is synthesized in the presence of the core. The emulsion polymerization may preferably be initiated by suitable water-soluble free-radical generators. The amounts usually used in the prior art are from 0.01 to 4% by weight, based on the total weight of the monomers. Examples of the initiators used are hydrogen peroxide or peroxide derivatives, such as the persulfates or peroxodisulfates of ammonium, sodium or potassium, and these are decomposed thermally or with the aid of suitable reducing agents (as described, for example, in Houben-Weyl Vol. 14/1, pp. 263-297). Examples of reducing agents are the following compounds: sodium sulfite, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium dithionite and ascorbic acid. Any of the emulsifiers and protective colloids known from the prior art may be used as dispersing agents for the emulsion polymerization. The amounts are usually from 0.5 to 5% by weight, based on the total weight of the<br><br>
monomers. Examples of those suitable are anionic surfactants, such as alky! sulfates with a chain length of from 8 to 20 carbon atoms, alkyl- or alkylarylsulfonates with comparable chain lengths, or esters or half-esters of sulfosuccinic acid. Alkyl polyglycol ethers or alkylaryl polyglycol ethers having from 1 to 30 ethylene oxide units are examples of nonionic surfactants which may be used. It is also possible, if desired, to use protective colloids, such as vinyl alcohol-vinyl acetate copolymers with a content of from 70 to 100 mol% of vinyl alcohol units, polyvinylpyrrolidone with a molar mass of from 10,000 to 350,000 g/mol and hydroxyalkylcelluloses with a degree of substitution of from 1 to 4. Acids, bases or conventional buffer salts, such as alkali metal phosphates or alkali metal carbonates may be added to control the pH. Known molecular-weight regulators, such as mercaptans, aldehydes or chlorinated hydrocarbons, may also be used.<br>
In the microsuspension process vinyl chloride is finely dispersed by mechanical means in an aqueous phase in the presence of an emulsifier system prior to the polymerization. Suitable homogenizers are high-pressure jets, colloid mills, high-speed stirrers or ultrasound dispersers. Preferred primary emulsifiers are the ammonium or alkali metal salts of fatty acids, alkyl sulfates, alkylarylsulfonates and the ammonium or alkali metal salts of sulfosuccinic esters. Secondary emulsifiers, such as hydrocarbons, C14-C24 fatty alcohols, fatty acids, ethoxylated long-chain alcohols, carboxylic acids, halogenated hydrocarbons, substituted phenols, ethylene oxide/propylene oxide adducts or partial polyhydric alcohol esters of fatty acids stabilize the monomer/water interface and suppress the Ostwald ripening of the dispersion. The initiators used are the oil-soluble free-radical generators which are also usual in suspension polymerization (see above).<br>
The proportion of core made from PVC in the impact modifier is from 5 to 80% by weight, preferably from 20 to 60% by weight, and the proportion of elastomer in the shell is from 20 to 95% by weight, preferably from 40 to 80% by weight.<br>
The overall diameter of the core-shell modifier particles is from 50 to 800 im, preferably from 60 to 400 nm.<br><br>
The core of the modifier is composed of pure PVC or of a VC copolymer with at least 50 parts of vinyl chloride (based on the total amount of monomer).<br>
The shell of the impact modifier is composed of an alkyl (meth)acrylate homo- or copolymer with a glass transition temperature 
An additional compatibilizing layer, composed of poly(meth)acrylates with a glass transition temperature &gt; 25°C, preferably &gt; 70°C, is polymerized onto the shell of the core-shell impact modifier. The proportion of this layer is not more than 50% by weight, based on the entire shell.<br>
The proportion of core-shell modifier, based on the entire monomer, is from 2 to 80% by weight, preferably from 3 to 50% by weight.<br>
The polymers prepared according to the invention are particularly suitable for thermoplastic molding, i.e. molding using heat and pressure, e.g. by calendering, extruding, thermoforming, injection molding or hot press molding, with or without plasticizer, for example to produce profiles for window frames or to give films, etc.<br>
