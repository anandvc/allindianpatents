				<td>HIGH REFRACTIVE INDEX THERMOPLASTIC POLYPHOSPHONATES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed to melt processable, high molecular weight polyphosphonates having a high refractive index and methods of preparing the same.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Polycarbonates are tough, rigid engineering thermoplastics. They are melt-processable and can easily be formed into optical and ophthalmic products by injection molding, instead of more time consuming and expensive casting processes. There is increasing demand for high refractive index materials for optical and opthalmic products. Polycarbonates, however, have only a limited refractive index.<br>
Thus, there is a need for melt processable materials which have high refractive indices.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides high molecular weight, film forming, high refractive index, melt-processable polyphosphonates. These polymers typically have lower melt processing temperatures and birefringerence than polycarbonates. These polymers may be used to form optical or ophthalmic products, such as lenses. Furthermore, the polymers of the present invention can be transferred directly from a reactor to a final mold for, for example, ophthalmic lens production, increasing the economic efficiency of the lens manufacturing process.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention is a method of preparing the polyphosphonates of the present invention.<br>

Example 1<br>
A 4-necked, 500 mL round bottomed flask equipped with an overhead stirrer, nitrogen inlet, temperature probe, dropping funnel and a condenser, was flame dried three times and cooled to room temperature each time under a strong purge of dry nitrogen. 20.546 g (0.09 moles) of bisphenol A, 120 mL of dry distilled methylene chloride, 27.5 mL (0.198 moles) of dry distilled triethylamine (10% excess), and 0.24 mL (0.003 moles) of 1-methyl imidazole was added to the flask. The mixture was stirred until the bisphenol A was completely dissolved. The flask was cooled to about 0° C with stirring. A solution of 17.549 g (0.09 moles) of distilled phenylphosphonic acid dichloride in 60 mL of dry methylene chloride was added dropwise from a dropping funnel over about 40-60 minutes while the flask was maintained at about 0° C and the mixture was stirred. After completion of the dropwise addition, stirring was continued for another hour. A solution of 1.367 g (0.00091 moles) t-butylphenol in 15 mL of methylene chloride was added to the mixture and the mixture was stirred for 30 minutes. The mixture was washed with 0.5 N aqueous hydrochloric acid and then repeatedly washed with water until the aqueous phase was neutral. The mixture was poured into rapidly stirred methanol and allowed to coagulate. The polymer was dried and dissolved in about 15-20% w/v tetrahydrofuran (THF) and allowed to coagulate in the water to form a free flowing fibrous polymer. The polymer was dried in a vacuum oven at about 90-95 ° C. This polymer comprised units having the formula<br>

A first solution of phenyl thiophosphonic dichloride in methylene chloride was added dropwise over about 1 hour to a second solution of bisphenol A, triethylamine, and N-methyl imidazole, while the second solution was maintained at about 0° C and stirred. After completion of the dropwise addition, the solution was warmed to room temperature and stirred for about 10 hours. The mixture was then washed with water. The mixture was poured into rapidly stirred methanol and allowed to coagulate to form a polymer. The polymer was dried and dissolved in about 15-20% w/v tetrahydrofuran (THF) and allowed to coagulate in the water to form a free flowing fibrous polymer.
