				<td>CIGARETTE FILTER AND PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING THE<br>
SAME<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119 of German<br>
Patent Application No. 102 17 410.5, filed on April 18, 2002, the disclosure of<br>
which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to a filter for articles of the tobacco<br>
processing industry, e.g., for cigarettes, that includes at least two filter<br>
components, in which one filter component is a sort of multiple-component fiber.<br>
The invention further relates to a process for producing a corresponding filter for<br>
articles of the tobacco processing industry, in particular for cigarettes.<br>
2.	Discussion of Background Information<br>
[0003] A process for producing a filter mass, e.g., for cigarette filters, is known<br>
from German Patent Application No. DE 30 28 328 A1. The process starts from a<br>
mass containing fibers, in which the mass appears as a homogenous mixture of<br>
fibers of different types. To this end, the mixture includes a synthetic fiber that<br>
melts at relatively low temperature and thereby effectuates adhesion and,<br>
moreover, a more heat-resistant fiber that absorbs harmful substances from<br>
tobacco smoke. The mixture is shaped into a cylindrical body, having dimensions<br>
of, e.g., a cigarette filter, before heat is applied. It is hereby achieved that the draw<br>
resistance is improved with increased filter effect. The process uses at least two<br>
different types of fibers, one of which is insensitive to the heat applied, but<br>
absorbs harmful substances in the smoke. The second fiber melts completely<br>
under the applied heat, through which the space originally occupied by this fiber<br>
forms a network of interconnected pores extending in all directions, which remains<br>
open for the smoke to pass through. The melted mass forms droplets at the<br>
intersections of the absorbing fibers, connecting them.<br><br>
[0004] The filters produced in this way have the disadvantage that an<br>
inhomogeneous distribution of the draw resistance is caused via the filter<br>
produced. Furthermore, the fibers absorbing the tobacco smoke or the<br>
components from the tobacco smoke are partially covered by the melted<br>
components so that the absorption properties are impaired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005] In contrast, the present invention provides a filter that features a<br>
homogeneous structure, that can be produced simply and that can be very variably<br>
adjusted by the filter properties. Furthermore, the present invention provides a<br>
process with which the filter can be produced in a simple, effective and<br>
correspondingly variable and homogenous manner.<br>
[0006] The present invention is directed to a filter for articles of the tobacco<br>
processing industry, in particular for cigarettes, comprising at least two filter<br>
components. The filter is further developed in that one filter component is a sort<br>
of multiple-component fiber, in which a length of the multiple-component fibers is<br>
smaller than the length of the filter.<br>
[0007] Through the further development of the known filter according to the<br>
invention, this can be embodied in a very homogenous way, whereby a<br>
corresponding variability is rendered possible as well as a simple production. The<br>
length of the multiple-component fibers is preferably between 0.5 mm and 30 mm.<br>
Further, the length of the multiple-component fibers is also preferably between 2<br>
mm and 8 mm and in particular between 3 mm and 6 mm.<br>
[0008] The multiple-component fibers include a core and a casing composed of<br>
different materials. According to the exemplary embodiment, the casing material<br>
features a lower melting point than the core material, such that a very secure<br>
bonding of the fibers in the filter can be produced, In this regard, the filter or the<br>
mixture of fibers from which the filter is made is brought to a temperature that is<br>
somewhat above the melting point of the casing material, so that a corresponding<br>
adhesion of filter components is rendered possible. The multiple-component fiber<br><br>
is preferably a bi-component fiber. With a corresponding bi-component fiber, the<br>
casing can be of polyethylene (PE) and the core, e.g., of polyester or polyethylene<br>
terephthalate (PET). The melting point of such a casing is then 127° C and the<br>
melting point of such a core is 256° C. In this way, a very dimensionally stable bi-<br>
component fiber is formed, in which the casing material has a lower melting point<br>
than its core material. A corresponding bi-component fiber is produced by Trevira<br>
(65926 Frankfurt, Germany). A bi-component fiber by Trevira preferably used by<br>
way of example has the type number 255, has a titer of 3.0 dtex, a cut length of<br>
between 3 and 6 mm, a core of PES (man-made fiber of polyester) and a shell or<br>
casing of copolyethylene, whereby the shell or casing is modified for increased<br>
adhesion, i.e., with additives provided to lead to a lower surface tension.<br>
(0009] In a preferred embodiment, at least a part of the filter components adhere<br>
and/or stick to the multiple-component fibers at contact points. Within the scope<br>
of this invention, the term "contact point" also includes the term "point of<br>
intersection" and "adhesion point." Adhesion and/or sticking is achieved when the<br>
filter components and, in particular, the multiple-component fibers are heated to a<br>
temperature above the casing melting temperature. In this regard, the casing<br>
correspondingly softens or begins to melt, so that at contact points of the multiple-<br>
component an adhesive connection or gluing connection to other components of<br>
the filter occurs at contact points. After the corresponding filter components have<br>
cooled, a dimensionally very stable filter is thus produced.<br>
[0010] In another exemplary embodiment, the filter also includes another filter<br>
component composed of other sorts of fibers. In this way, a very environmentally<br>
friendly filter can be produced when the other sorts of fibers are, e.g.,<br>
biodegradable or can be produced biologically. In particular, cellulose fibers are<br>
preferably considered here or charcoal fibers, which can be activated. Other<br>
fibers, such as, e.g., hemp fibers or cotton fiber or the like, can also be utilized.<br>
These fibers preferably adsorb and/or absorb components of tobacco smoke<br>
effectively. Further, the length of the other sorts of fibers is preferably smaller<br><br>
than the length of the filter and is preferably between 0.1 mm and 30 mm and, in<br>
particular, between 0.2 mm and 10 mm.<br>
[0011] In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a powdery or granular<br>
material can be utilized as another filter component, such that it is possible very<br>
effectively filter gaseous smoke. The powdery or granular material is preferably<br>
activated charcoal powder or granulate of activated charcoal. Moreover, this<br>
material can be catalysts that increase the absorption of smoke components or<br>
generate or facilitate a chemical transformation (reaction) into components that are<br>
not hazardous to the smoker. A substantial advantage of the invention lies in that<br>
an effective surface of the powder or of the granulate, which forms another filter<br>
component, is clearly increased as compared with corresponding filters made of<br>
cellulose acetate mixed with powder, since no adhesive such as triacitin covers the<br>
surface. For example, adhesion only occurs to the multiple-component fibers, so<br>
that the part of the surface that does not adhere to the fiber remains free and thus is<br>
available for adsorption or absorption. In accordance with the invention, flavoring<br>
materials can be selected as the powdery or granular material. Thus, in<br>
accordance with the foregoing description, a smaller amount of the flavoring<br>
materials are necessary in order to achieve a same taste effect. Preferably, the<br>
powdery or granular material is an adsorbing material.<br>
[0012] In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, a proportion of<br>
multiple-component fibers is between 2% and 100% and a proportion of other<br>
fibers is between 0% and 98%. Within the scope of the invention, the percentages<br>
of the proportions of materials are to be considered as percentages by weight<br>
(%wt).<br>
[0013] A filter that binds the cigarette smoke in a particularly effective manner<br>
is given when the filter includes a proportion of powdery or granular material that<br>
is between 80% by weight or 100 % by weight and preferably is 90% by weight.<br>
[0014] The filter is preferably a component of a multiple filter. Within the scope<br>
of this instant invention, the term "multiple filter" also includes the term "multi-<br><br>
segment filter." Thus, the filter according to the invention can be the entire filter<br>
or a segment of a multiple filter of, e.g., a cigarette.<br>
[0015] Further, the invention provides a process to manufacture a filter for<br>
articles of the tobacco processing industry. The process includes producing a rod,<br>
with at least one sort of multi-component fibers having lengths smaller than a<br>
length of the filter to be manufactured, heating the fiber rod to a temperature<br>
above a melting temperature of a casing of the at least one sort of multiple-<br>
component fibers, and cooling the fiber rod to a temperature below the melting<br>
temperature of the casing of the at least one sort of multiple-component fibers.<br>
[0016] Through the process according to the invention, it is possible to<br>
manufacture a very homogenous filter in a cost-effective manufacture, in which<br>
high variability is available. The temperature to which the fiber rod is heated is<br>
preferably greater than the melting temperature of the casing or the outer casing of<br>
the multiple-component fibers. With a casing of, e.g., polyethylene, this is over<br>
127° C. If bi-component fibers are used, a core of polyester is preferred which has<br>
a melting temperature of 256°C, such that the fiber rod is heated to a temperature<br>
below 256° C, and is preferably heated in a temperature range between 127° C and<br>
150° C.<br>
[0017] When, before the production of the rod, at least one other component is<br>
mixed into the at least one sort of multiple-component fibers, it is possible to<br>
manufacture a very cost-effective as well as environmentally friendly filter. By<br>
way of example, cellulose fiber is suitable as this other component, and can be<br>
purchased from, e.g., Stora Enso Pulp, in Falun, Sweden. In this regard, the<br>
cellulose fiber type under the name Stora Fluff EF can be utilized. Moreover, a<br>
powdery or granular component of an adsorber, absorber, catalyst or flavoring<br>
material can be used as the other component, either separately or in combination<br>
with each other and with the cellulose fiber.<br>
[0018] A particularly effective and simple process control is given when at least<br>
one part of the components is poured onto a conveyor to produce the rod. In this<br><br>
way, a corresponding filter rod or corresponding filter is manufactured in a<br>
particularly homogenous manner. Reference is hereby made to the manufacture of<br>
tobacco rods, which is described, e.g., in German Patent No. DE 36 24 098 C2, the<br>
disclosure of which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
Preferably, the process can also be used for manufacturing filters, in such a<br>
manner that the initial components are first present in a loose mixture, i.e., before<br>
the manufacture of the rod, and then, as with tobacco rod manufacture, are poured<br>
on a suction belt and further processed. To this extent, the content of German<br>
Patent No. DE 36 24 098 C2 can thus be used for the manufacturing process of<br>
filters or filter rods.<br>
[0019J Preferably at least those components that are present in fiber form are<br>
poured. The poured fibers present in the mixture have a length that is preferably<br>
shorter than the length of the filter to be manufactured. Further, a particularly<br>
effective and cost-effective filter can then be manufactured when at least one other<br>
component in powder form or as granulate is added to the rod before heating or is<br>
added to the multiple-component fibers or the mixture during pouring. If, e.g., a<br>
powder of activated charcoal is added, it is possible to provide a very large surface<br>
on the charcoal powder particles, so that effectively fewer charcoal particles have<br>
to be added; Furthermore, in view of the instant invention, it is then no longer<br>
necessary to provide an active charcoal granulate filter for a multiple filter, which<br>
is relatively cost-intensive in the manufacture. Moreover, a more homogenous<br>
mixture of the powder in the multiple-component fibers or in the mixture of the<br>
fibers is possible than with a granulate filter. Still further, the draw resistance is<br>
more constant and can be better influenced.<br>
[0020] When the rod is shaped by a garniture apparatus, to produce, e.g., a<br>
cylindrical form, it is possible to manufacture the desired end measurements of the<br>
filter to be manufactured in a simple manner. In this connection, reference is once<br>
again made to German Patent Application No. DE 36 24 098 C2, in which a<br>
corresponding garniture apparatus is described for producing an endless rod. A<br><br>
garniture apparatus adapted to the physical properties of the filter components can<br>
be used according to this invention. Further, the rod is preferably compressed<br>
during shaping. Moreover, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment, it is<br>
possible to encase the rod within a suitable casing material, e.g., a paper strip,<br>
removed from a bobbin and laid on a driven garniture belt. The garniture belt then<br>
transports the filter rod or the combined fiber rod and paper strip through the<br>
garniture apparatus in order to fold the paper strip around the fiber rod. However,<br>
one edge of the paper strip projects from the rod, which is glued by a gluing<br>
device in a known manner. Finally the gluing seam is closed and dried by a seam<br>
sealer.<br>
[0021] The heating of the rod occurs in or after the shaping in the garniture<br>
apparatus. Preferably, the heating occurs after the cutting of the filter rod into<br>
filter nth use lengths or filter bars. Subsequently the filter, is cut to length or cut<br>
off. To this end, filters of nth use lengths are produced, which are subsequently<br>
used to produce, e,g,, filter cigarettes. In this regard, n is a natural number and<br>
preferably even. For example, when a filter is placed between, and subsequently<br>
connected to, two cut tobacco rods, n is two (2), such that this filter is of double<br>
use length and is to be cut through in the middle after connection with the cut<br>
tobacco rods, in order to serve as filter for two cigarettes.<br>
[0022] The invention is also directed to a filter manufactured according to the<br>
process of the instant invention or a preferred embodiment of the process<br>
according to the invention. Moreover, a cigarette is formed by a cut tobacco rod<br>
and a filters according to the invention.<br>
[0023] The present invention is directed to a filter for articles of the tobacco<br>
processing industry. The filter includes at least one filter component of multiple-<br>
component fibers. The multiple-component fibers have lengths shorter than a<br>
length of the filter.<br>
[0024] According to a feature of the invention, the filter can be manufactured for<br>
use with cigarettes.<br><br>
[0025] In accordance with another feature of the instant invention, the lengths of<br>

lengths of the multiple-component fibers can be between 2 mm and 8 mm, and,<br>
preferably, the lengths of the multiple-component fibers are between 3 mm and 6<br>
mm.<br>
[0026] Further, the multiple-component fibers can include cores and casings<br>
composed of different materials. The casing material may have a lower melting<br>
point than the core material.<br>
[0027] According to still another feature of the instant invention, each of the<br>
multiple-component fibers may include a core and a casing composed of materials<br>
having different melting points. The casing material has a lower melting point<br>
than the core material.<br>
[0028] In accordance with a further feature of the invention, the multiple-<br>

[0030] Moreover, the at least one filter component can further include other<br>
fibers, different from the multiple-component fibers. Lengths of the other fibers<br>
may be shorter than a length of the filter. The lengths of the other fibers are<br>
between 0.1 mm and 30 mm. Further, the lengths of the other fibers can be<br>
between 0.2 mm and 10 mm. Still further, the other fibers may include at least<br>
one of cellulose fibers and charcoal fibers. The at least one filter component may<br>
also include a powdery or granular material. The multiple-component fibers can<br>
be structured so that portions of the multiple-component fibers contacting each<br>
other and contacting portions of the other fibers adhere to each other forming<br>

[0031] In accordance with another feature of the present invention, the filter can<br>
be composed of between 2 % wt. and 100 % wt. of the multiple-component fibers<br><br>
and between 0 % by wt. and 98 % by wt. of other fibers, which are different from<br>
the multiple-component fibers. Further, the other fibers may include at least one<br>
of cellulose fibers and charcoal fibers. The filter can also be composed of between<br>
80 % wt. and 95 % wt. of a powdery or granular material. The powdery or<br>
granular material can include at least one of activated charcoal, an adsorber, an<br>
absorber, a catalyst and a flavoring material. Further, the multiple-component<br>
fibers are structured so that portions of the multiple-component fibers contacting<br>
each other, contacting portions of the other fibers, and contacting portions of the<br>
powdery or granular material adhere to each other forming contacting points.<br>
[0032] According to the present invention, the filter can be a component of a<br>
multiple filter.<br>
[0033] In accordance with another feature of the invention, a cigarette can<br>
include a filter as described above connected to a cigarette rod.<br>
[0034] The present invention is directed to a process for producing a filter for<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
[0057] The particulars shown herein are by way of example and for purposes of<br>
illustrative discussion of the embodiments of the present invention only and are<br>
presented in the cause of providing what is believed to be the most useful and<br>
readily understood description of the principles and conceptual aspects of the<br>
present invention. In this regard, no attempt is made to show structural details of<br>
the present invention in more detail than is necessary for the fundamental<br>
understanding of the present invention, the description taken with the drawings<br>
making apparent to those skilled in the art how the several forms of the present<br>
invention may be embodied in practice.<br>
[0058] Figures 1a - 1d diagrammatically illustrate cross-sections of filter<br>
cigarettes. Filters 10 in Figures 1a - 1d are each structured differently. Further, a<br>
cut tobacco rod 11 is attached to each filter, whereby cut tobacco rod 11 and filter<br>
10, as shown in diagrammatic form, are provided with a casing paper 17.<br>
[0059] In Figure la, filter 10 comprises multiple-component fibers, i.e., bi-<br>
component fibers 12, e.g., bi-component fibers of type 255 by Trevira (65926<br><br>
Frankfurt, Germany), which were described above with regard to their properties.<br>
Bi-component fibers 12 comprise a core 20 of, e.g., PES, a man-made fiber of<br>
polyester, or PET, i.e. polyethylene terephthalate. In this exemplary embodiment<br>
casing 21 is made of PE (polyethylene). The melting point of casing 21 is 127° C<br>
and the melting temperature of core 20 is 256°C. In order to produce the filter<br>
according to the invention, bi-component fibers 12 are correspondingly mixed,<br>
whereby loose fibers are used, which have a finite length shorter than the length of<br>
the filter to be produced. In this exemplary embodiment, bi-component fibers 12<br>
have a cut length of 6 mm. The filter to be produced has a length of 21 mm.<br>
[0060] Bi-component fibers 12 are poured onto a suction conveyor for the<br>
production of the filter, in order to form a stream or a rod of bi-component fibers<br>
12. This stream or rod of bi-component fibers 12 is then shaped into the filter<br>
shape, preferably cylindrical, by a garniture apparatus, and encased with a casing<br>
paper 17. In order to achieve a corresponding stability, the filter is brought to a<br>
temperature of above the melting temperature of casing 21 of bi-component fibers<br>
12, so that casing 21 melts or begins to melt. After a subsequent cooling,<br>
connections have formed at intersection points 18 of bi-component fibers 12,<br>
which connections lead to a bonding of bi-component fibers 12 in the rod. The<br>
heating of the rod can occur before the shaping of the filter in the garniture<br>
apparatus. However, this heating can also occur during shaping or afterwards. A<br>
corresponding adhesion of bi-component fibers 12, as shown in Figure 2, occurs at<br>
a point of intersection 18 at which casing 21 material is accordingly melted.<br>
Through this connection it is possible to produce a very dimensionally stable<br>
filter. Moreover, it is noted that the length specification in the lower area of<br>
Figure 2 is 10 μm.<br>
[0061] Figure 1b shows a filter that is made of a mixture of fibers, including bi-<br>
component fibers 12 and cellulose fibers 13. In a preferred manner, a mixture of<br>
20 to 30 % bi-component fibers 12 and 70 to 80 % cellulose fibers 13 is used.<br>
Cellulose fibers 13 hereby serve as absorption- or adsorption fibers and bi-<br><br>
component fibers 12, with the adhesion points at intersection points 18, serve as a<br>
framework. It should be noted that not only are bi-component fibers 12 adhered<br>
together, but also cellulose fibers 13 at intersection points 18 with bi-component<br>
fibers 12.<br>
[0062] In another exemplary, albeit unillustrated, embodiment, the filter is<br>
composed of 20% wt. bi-component fibers, 70% wt. cellulose fibers and 10 % wt.<br>
charcoal fibers, preferably, activated charcoal fibers. The advantage of such a<br>
filter with these three fiber components is that harmful gaseous substances are also<br>
well adsorbed from the smoke. A filter can be produced more cost-effectively<br>
than an activated charcoal granulate filter. Furthermore, a very homogenous filter<br>
can be realized. Finally, a higher activity is given, since the active fibers are not<br>
glued with a glue such as, triacetin, and, therefore, a larger active surface is<br>
rendered possible. Another scanning electron microscope image is shown in<br>
Figure 3, which illustrates a mixture of 20% wt. bi-component fibers 12 and 80 %<br>
wt. cellulose fibers 13.<br>
[0063] Figure 1c shows another filter that comprises three components, which<br>
includes an activated charcoal granulate 14 used as additional component These<br>
activated charcoal granulate particles or activated charcoal powder particles<br>
adhere or stick to the bi-component fibers at a corresponding adhesion point 19.<br>
Due to the small adhesion point or sticking point of charcoal particles 14 on bi-<br>
component fibers 12, a large free surface results with the charcoal particles, which<br>
surface is active. Other adsorbates, catalysts and/or flavoring materials can also be<br>
used instead of the activated charcoal particles or granulate, or powder. The grain<br>
size of the activated charcoal powder is normally a maximum of 10 um. For<br>
example, 20 mg can be added to a filter accordingly.<br>
[0064] Figure 4 shows a scanning electron microscope image of a corresponding<br>
part of a filter with a mixture of bi-component fibers 12, cellulose fibers 13 and<br>
particles of an activated charcoal powder 14. It can be easily observed that<br>
activated charcoal particles 14 adhere to bi-component fibers 12. However, some<br><br>
activated charcoal particles 14 are also arranged on cellulose fiber 13, which<br>
adhere there, although less firmly than to bi-component fiber 12.<br>
[0065] A multiple filter 10' is shown in Figure 1d that comprises a filter element<br>
16, which can comprise, e.g., a conventional cellulose acetate filter 15, and a filter<br>
element 16', which can, e.g., correspond to the filter element depicted in Figure<br>
1c.<br>
[0066] Through the filter according to the invention and the manufacturing<br>
process of the filter according to invention, there is a possibility of selecting and<br>
mixing the components of the filters such that smoke components can be<br>
specifically filtered out.<br>
[0067] A filter produced according to the invention preferably has a length of 21<br>
mm, a diameter of 7.8 mm, a weight of 110 mg, and a draw resistance of 55<br>
mmWS. The filter comprises 75 % wt. cellulose fibers of the type stora Fluff EF<br>
with a fiber length of 0.4 mm and 25 % wt. bi-component fibers of the type 255 by<br>
Trevira with a cut length of 6 mm and a diameter of 25 um. With the filter<br>
according to the invention, tar values of 12 mg/cig. and nicotine values of 0.87<br>
mg/cig. are achieved with a ventilation of 18 %.<br>
[0068] Figure 5 shows a diagrammatic illustration of a cross section through a<br>
filter cigarette according to Figures 1a through 1d. In comparison to the examples<br>
of Figures 1a - 1d, the filter according to the invention comprises two filter<br>
elements 16 and 16', whereby filter element 16' is a mixture of bi-component<br>
fibers 12 and activated charcoal granulate 14 or activated charcoal powder 14.<br>
Further, a particularly preferred mixture includes between 80 and 95 % wt.<br>
activated charcoal granulate or powder 14 and 5 to 20 % wt. bi-component fibers<br>
12. A mixture ratio of approx. 90 % wt. activated charcoal granulate or powder 14<br>
and approx. 10 % wt. bi-component fibers 12 is particularly preferred. As noted,<br>
the percentages are in particular percentages by weight.<br><br>
[0069] The activated charcoal granulate or powder is, e.g., the granulate Norit<br>
GCN 3060 by Norit Nederland B.V. For 90 % of the granulate the grain size is<br>
between 0.25 mm and 0.59 mm.<br>
[0070] Figure 6 illustrates a scanning electron microscope image of a section<br>
through a filter according to the invention comprising approx. 10 % wt. bi-<br>
component fibers 12 and approx. 90 % wt. activated charcoal granulate 14. This<br>
figure is depicted as a 205 x magnification. In the lower area of Figure 6, a scale<br>
is shown that shows in total 1 mm, whereby the units within this scale are 100 μm.<br>
[0071] Activated charcoal granulate 14 is, as can be seen in Figure 6, held in a<br>
matrix of bi-component fibers 12, whereby holding is rendered possible in<br>
particular by adhesion to bi-component fibers 12, after they have been brought to<br>
the melting of the shell during the manufacturing process of the filter,<br>
[0072] It is noted that the foregoing examples have been provided merely for the<br>
