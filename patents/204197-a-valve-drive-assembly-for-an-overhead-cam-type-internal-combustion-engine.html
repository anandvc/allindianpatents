PROVISIONAL/COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan,, 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome,, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
GRANTED<br>
6-4-2000<br>
The   following   specification   particularly   describes   the   nature   of  the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a valve drive assembly for an overhead cam type internal combustion engine.<br>
The present invention relates to a valve drive assembly for an OHC (overhead cam) type internal combustion engine. [0002] [Related Art]<br>
An OHC type internal  combustion engine transmits rotational force of a crankshaft inside a crankcase through a cylinder block and to an exhaust valve arranged in a cylinder head and must be operated at a fixed timing, and a cam chain is sometimes used as transmission means. [0003]<br>
A cam chain is suspended across a drive sprocket fitted to the crankshaft and a driven sprocket fitted to a cam shaft.<br>
When the internal combustion engine is assembled, the cam chain hanging from the drive sprocket inside the crankcase is taken out to the outside through the inside of the cylinder block, the cylinder head is attached and the cam chain is hung on<br><br><br>
the driven sprocket.<br>
[0004]<br>
At the time of the operation of taking out the cam chain hung from the drive<br>
sprocket to the outside from the cylinder block, there is a problem that it is easy for the<br>
cam chain to come away from the drive sprocket, and if it comes away once, the<br>
cylinder block must be taken off again.<br>
In an example disclosed in Japanese Utility Model laid-open No. Sho. 63-<br>
20558, a rib is formed on a cam chain line of a crankcase, and the cam chain hung from<br>
the drive sprocket is regulated by the rib so that it does not come away from the drive<br>
sprocket.<br>
[00G5]<br>
[Problems To Be Solved By The Invention]<br>
If the crankshaft is supported by a metal bearing, the internal diameter of<br>
machined holes in the side of the crankcase into which this metal bearing fits is smaller than the external diameter of the cam chain, which means that the rib does not hinder production of the machined holes<br>
[0006]<br>
However, when the crankshaft is supported by a roller bearing, the externa! diameter of this roller bearing itself is large, and the machined holes in the crankcase also become larger than the external diameter of the cam chain, as a result of which the rib is a hindrance at the time of forming the holes, and the rib is shaved off. [0007] <br>
The present invention has been conceived in view of the above described situation, and an object of the present invention is to cheaply provide a valve drive assembly, for an OHC type internal combustion engine in which a crankshaft is rotatably pivoted in a crank case via a roller bearing that has a simple construction and can prevent a cam chain coming off at the time of assembly [0008]<br><br><br>
[MEANS OF SOLUTION AND OPERATIONAL EFFECTS]<br>
The present invention relates to a valve drive assembly for an overhead cam type internal combustion engine having a crankshaft rotatably pivoted in a crankcase via a roller bearing, wherein<br>
a drive sprocket for a cam chain of a valve transmission system is fitted onto the crankshaft; characterized in that<br>
a bolt or pin is arranged on the periphery of the drive sprocket close to a cam chain wound around the drive sprocket.<br>
[0009]<br>
In an internal combustion engine having a crankshaft rotatably pivoted in a crankcase via a roller bearing, with a simple structure where a bolt or pin is arranged close to a cam chain wound around the drive sprocket, machined bearing holes in the crankcase are not hindered by a rib etc. and can be machined easily, and it is possible to simply prevent the cam chain coming away, from the drive sprocket using the bolt or pin. [0010]<br>
The invention of claim 2 is a valve drive assembly for an overhead cam type internal combustion engine having a crankshaft rotatably pivoted in a crankcase via a roller bearing, in which a drive sprocket for a cam chain of a valve transmission system is fitted onto the crankshaft, and a guide plate for the cam chain and an attachment bolt for the guide plate are arranged side by side on the periphery of the drive sprocket along a cam chain line and close to a cam chain wound around the drive sprocket. [0011]<br>
A guide plate is attached in advance to the crankcase using attachment bolts, and by fitting the crank shaft having the cam chain hanging from the drive sprocket into the crank case, the guide plate and attachment bolts more reliably prevent the cam chain coming away during subsequent assembly operations.<br>
In an internal combustion engine having a crankshaft rotatably pivoted in a crankcase via a roller bearing, there is a simple structure having the guide plate attached to the crankcase by attachment bolts, which is cheap, and it is easy to machine the bearing holes in the crankcase.<br><br><br>

[0013]<br>
A vehicle frame is made up of three sections, namely a front frame 2, a center frame 3 and a rear frame 4 linked together in this order.<br>
The front frame 2 is made up of a head pipe 2a, a down tube 2b extending downwards and outwards from the head pipe 2a, and a step floor section 2c curving backwards at a lower end. [0014]<br>
The center frame 3 is connected to a rear end of the front frame 2, rises upwards and then slopes backwards, and supports a helmet box. The power unit 20 is supported via a pivot 10 of a bracket projecting from a curved section of the center frame 3 so as to be capable of swinging up and down. [0015]<br>
The rear frame 4 is a pipe member extending backwards from a rear end of the center frame 3, and supports a fuel tank 12. [0016]<br>
The power unit 20 comprises an OHC type single cylinder internal combustion engine 21 arranged substantially horizontally and facing to the front of the vehicle frame, and a belt type infinitely variable transmission 22 extending from the left side of the internal combustion engine 21 to the rear of the vehicle A rear cushion 14 is interposed between the rear of the belt type infinitely variable transmission 22 and a rear end of the center frame 3.<br>
An air cleaner 15 is supported on an upper surface of the belt type infinitely variable transmission 22, while a stand 17 is supported in a lower surface of the internal combustion engine 21. [0017]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the internal combustion engine 21 has a crankcase 26 and a cylinder block 27 fitted together so that a crankshaft 25 is aligned with joining surfaces, a cylinder head 28 is fitted on top of the cylinder block 27, and an end surface of the cylinder head 28 is covered by a cylinder head cover 29 [0018]<br>
A transmission case 30 has a front section coupled to a left end surface of the crankcase 26 and extends backwards, and as shown in Fig. 2 a V belt 33 is suspended between a drive sprocket 31  whose diameter is variable by a centrifugal weight<br><br><br>
provided on the crankshaft 25 sticking out to the left of the transmission case 30, and a driven sprocket 32 provided on an output shaft 34, constituting the belt type infinitely variable transmission 22. [0019]<br>
As shown in Fig. 3, an AC generator 35 provided on the right side of the crankshaft 25 is covered by a generator cover 36, and a radiator 37 is provided on the right side of this generator cover 36.<br>
A cooling fan 38 for supplying cooling air to the radiator 37 fixed to the right end of the crankshaft 25 is arranged between the AC generator 35 and the radiator 37. [0020]<br>
This crankshaft 25 has both sides of a counterweight 25a rotatably supported by roller bearings 40, 40, and these roller bearings 40, 40 are fitted into respective semicircular actuate machined holes in the cranks case 26 and the cylinder block 27.<br>
A piston 42 fitted into the cylinder head 41 inside the cylinder block 27 so as to reciprocate is connected to the crankshaft 25 via a connecting rod 43. [0021]<br>
A cam shaft 45 is rotatably supported by the cylinder head 28, and as shown in Fig. 4, rocker shafts 46 and 47 are arranged above and below and diagonally in front of the cam shaft 45 Rocker arms 48 and 49 are respectively slidably supported on each rocker shaft 46 and 47.<br>
In the cylinder head 28, an intake valve 51 and an exhaust valve 52 are slidably supported via valve guides 50, 50, passing respectively through an intake port 28a and an exhaust port 28b so as to be capable of opening and closing port apertures [0022]<br>
Spring retainers 53a and 54a for holding ends of valve springs 53 and 54 are attached to the stem sections of the intake valve 51 and the exhaust valve 52, with tappet shims 55 and 56 being housed in a concave central part of the valve spring retainers, operation points of the rocker arms operating above the tappet shims, and power points of the rocker arms 48 and 49 being connected to respective cam lobes 45a and 45b of the cam shaft 45.<br>
Accordingly, the rocker arms 48 and 49 rock with rotation of the cam shaft 45 to cause the intake valve 51 and exhaust valve 52 to slide back and forth at a specified timing and open and close the valves.<br><br><br>
[0023]<br>
As shown in Fig 5, the rocker shafts 46 and 47 are inexpensive and different in structure, with an upper rocker shaft having an oil supply passageway 46a formed therein but the lower rocker shaft 47 not having an oil supply passageway formed therein, and the shapes of end surfaces exposes to the side of the cylinder head 28 are also different, in order to prevent them being attached the wrong way round, with the end surface of the upper rocker shaft 46 having a concave sections 46b and the end surface of the lower rocker shaft 47 having a convex section 47a. [0024]<br>
The end surfaces of the rocker shafts 46 and 47 press against a press plate 58 from an outer side, and the press plate 58 is screwed to the cylinder head using a bolt 59.<br>
The end section of the press plate 58 that the end surfaces of the rocker shafts 46 and 47 press against is formed shaped taking into consideration the concave section 46b and concave section 47b of the respective end surfaces (refer to Fig 2), so that in the event that the rocker shafts 46 and 46 are assembled incorrectly the end surface of the press plate 58 does not line up. [0025]<br>
As shown in Fig 5, the rocker shafts 46 and 47 are inserted so as to span between a left side wall 28a and an inner wall 28b of the cylinder head 28, the intake valve 51 and the exhaust valve 52 protrude into a space 28c between the two walls 28a and 28b, and the rocker arms 48 and 49 are supported so as to rock on the respective rocker shafts 46 and 47 and slide in the axial direction in this space 28c [0026]<br>
As shown in Fig 5, the rocker arm 48 supported on the upper rocker shaft 46 comes into contact with the inner wall 28b as a result of being forced to the right (to the left in Fig. 5) by a spring 60 interposed between the left side wall 28b and the inner wall 28a, and in this state the rocker arm 48 has power points coming into contact with specified cam lobes 45a of the cam shaft 45 and operating points pressed against end portions of the intake valve 51 via the tappet shim 55. [0027]<br>
Similarly, the rocker arm 49 supported on the lower rocker shaft 47 comes into contact with the left side wall 28a as a result of being forced to the left (to the right in<br><br><br>
Fig, 5) by a spring 61 interposed between the inner wall 28a and the left side wall 28b, and in this state the rocker arm 49 has power points coming into contact with specified cam'lobes 45b of the cam shaft 45 and operating points pressed against end portions of the exhaust valve 52 via the tappet shim 56.<br>
The respective power points of the rocker arms 48 and 49 are offset from one another in the axial direction, and contact specified cam lobes 45a and 45b. [0028]<br>
Because of this type of valve structure, if the upper rocker arm 48 is moved in the right direction against the spring 60, operating points of the rocker arm 48 come away from the end of the intake valve 51 as shown by the two dot chain line in Fig. 5, the tappet shim 55 can be replaced and it is possible to simply carry out tappet clearance adjustment without removing the rocker arm 48. [0029]<br>
In a similar way, it is also possible to easily carry out tappet clearance for the lower rocker arm 49 by moving the rocker arm to the position shown by the two dot chain line in Fig. 5 so that the tappet shim 56 of the exhaust valve 52 can be replaced. [0030]<br>
The power points of the rocker arms 48 and 49 are offset in a direction opposite to the direction of movement, and tappet clearance adjustment is carried out by moving the rocker arms 48 and 49 in a direction approaching these power points, which means that if there is a narrow space 28c between the left side wall 28a and the inner wall 28b it sufficient to enable tappet clearance adjustment and space efficiency is good. [0031]<br>
Conventional tappet clearance adjustment involves the problem of taking out the rocker arm etc., which means that tappet clearance adjustment is generally carried out using an adjustment screw and nut attached to the end of the rocker arm, as disclosed in Japanese Utility Model No. 57-39531, but this makes the equivalent mass of the valve system large, and is disadvantageous with respect to friction and fuel consumption. [0032]<br>
In this respect the present valve structure does not have an adjustment screw and nut on the rocker arm 48 for tappet adjustment, making the equivalent mass of the valve system small which is advantageous with respect to friction and fuel consumption,<br><br><br>
and also, tappet clearance adjustment is remarkably simple [0033]<br>
The cam shaft 45 causing the rocker arms 48 and 49 to rock penetrates through the inner wall 28b and extends to the right, as shown in Fig. 3, and has a cooling water pump 65 provided on the right end, with the cooling water pump being covered by a thermostat case 67 of a thermostat 66. [0034]<br>
A driven sprocket 71 is fitted to the cam shaft 45 between the cooling water pump 65 and the inner wall 28b (refer to Fig. 3).<br>
On the other hand, a drive sprocket 70 fitted to the crankshaft 25 and corresponding to the driven sprocket 71 is between a right side roller bearing 40 and the AC generator 35, as shown in Fig. 3, is integrally formed with a gear 68 for transmitting drive power to an oil pump [0035]<br>
A cam chain 72, being a silent chain, is looped between the crankcase 26 side drive sprocket 70 and the cylinder head 28 side driven sprocket 71, and chain passageways 27a and 28d for passage of the cam chain 72 are formed in the cylinder block 27 and the cylinder head 28 (refer to Fig. 3 and Fig. 6) [0036]<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, an upper section of the cam chain 72 looped between the front side driven sprocket 71 and the rear side drive sprocket 70 is pressed downwards by a cam chain guide 74 urged by a cam chain tensioner 73, while the lower section of the cam chain is supported and guided by a cam chain guide 75. [0037]<br>
Accordingly, the valve drive mechanism is constructed so that rotation of the crankshaft 25 is transmitted to the cam shaft 45 by the cam chain guided at top and bottom by the cam chain guides 74 and 75 and looped between the drive sprocket 70 and the driven sprocket 71. [0038]<br>
In the crankcase 26, a guide plate 80 is fixed over the cam chain at the periphery of the drive sprocket 70 using an attachment bolt 81 (refer to Fig. 6). [0039]<br>
The guide plate 80 extends from a fixing section 80b in which a bolt hole 80a<br><br><br>
is formed, in the same plane, and a tip part curves upwards vertically in the opposite<br>
direction to an abutment section 80c curving one way<br>
[0040]<br>
The crankcase 26 to which the guide plate 80 is attached has three ribs 26a, 26b and 26c parallel with each other formed on an inner side, as shown in Fig. 9, sequentially protruding from the right in Fig. 9, and a pair of roller bearings 40, 40 for rotatably supporting the crankshaft 25 are fitted into semicircular holes 26a' and 26b' formed in the two right ribs 26a and 26b. [0041]<br>
The drive sprocket 70 is fitted between the rib 26b and the rib 26c, and the cam chain 72 is wrapped around the drive sprocket 70.<br>
An attachment boss 26d is formed between these ribs 26b and 26c and the guide plate 81 is fixed to the attachment boss 26d with an attachment bolt 81 [0042]<br>
At the position shown by the two for chain line in Fig. 9, the guide plate 80 is attached to the attachment boss 26d by the attachment bolt 81.<br>
Specifically, the edge of the tip end curved toward the rib 26b of the abutment section 80c of the guide plate 80 comes into contact with the rib 26b, and when screwed on using the attachment bolt 81, the guide plate 80 is attached so as not to turn with the attachment bolt 81 [0043]<br>
When the guide plate 80 is attached, the guide section 80d of the guide plate 80 and the head 81a of the attachment bolt 81 are arranged side by side along the cam chain line, as shown in Fig. 6. [0044]<br>
The spacing between the cam chain wrapped around the drive sprocket 70 and the guide section 80d of the guide plate 80, and the spacing between the drive sprocket 70 and the head 81a of the attachment bolt 81 are small and adjacent to each other, and it is possible to prevent the cam chain 72 coming off when it deviates in the axial direction [0045]<br>
Particularly, a silent chain is more likely to slide sideways compared to a roller chain because of the shape of the toothed sections, but it is easy to prevent the chain<br><br><br>
coming off using the guide plate 80 and the attachment bolt 81. [0046]<br>
It can also be considered to initially cause the ribs to protrude instead of using the guide plate 80 and the attachment bolt 81, as in the related art. However, if the crankshaft 25 is supported by a roller bearing 40, machining of the crankcase is difficult. [0047]<br>
Specifically, referring to Fig 6, the inner diameter D of semicircular holes 26b' for supporting the roller bearing 40 of the crankcase 26 is larger than the outer diameter d of the cam chain, which means that if there is a rib protruding out close to the cam chain 72, the rib gets in the way and makes manufacture extremely difficult, even if the hole 26b' is formed. [0048]<br>
The structure of this embodiment for preventing the cam chain coming off does away with this rib, manufacture is made easy, and cost can also be reduced due to the simple structure for fixing the guide plate 80 using the attachment bolt [0049]<br>
The cam chain coming off is a problem, especially at the time of assembling the cam chain, but this structure for preventing the cam chain coming off can reliably prevent the cam chain coming off, even at the time of assembly [0050]<br>
The order of assembling the cam chain will now be described The guide plate 80 is attached to the attachment boss 26d of the crankcase 26 in advance using the attachment bolt 81.<br>
With the cam chain 72 wound around the drive sprocket 70 of the crankshaft 25, the crankshaft 25 is placed in the cylinder block 27 with the crankcase at an upper side via the roller bearings 40, 40, and the cam chain 72 is passed through the chain passageway 27a and taken out to the cylinder head side (lower side) [0051]<br>
The guide plate 80 and the crankcase to which the attachment bolt has been attached are joined using cover bolts on matching surfaces above an upper side of the cylinder block 27.<br>
The combined crankcase 26 and cylinder block 27 hold the cam chain 72 taken<br><br><br>
out from the cylinder head side and are turned over [0052]<br>
Normally at this time it is easy for the cam chain to come away from the drive sprocket 70, but with this embodiment the cam chain 72 is prevented from coming off by the guide plate 80 and the attachment bolt 81<br>
Then, the cam chain guides 74 and 75 are attached and the cylinder head 28 is fitted with a head gasket between the cylinder head 28 and the cylinder block 27, and the cam chain 72 is wrapped around the driven sprocket. [0053]<br>
When assembling the cam chain 72 as described above, it is possible for manufacturing to proceed smoothly without the cam chain 72 wrapped around the drive sprocket 70 corning off during assembly. [0054]<br>
With the above described embodiment, the guide plate 80 is fixed by the attachment bolt 81 and the cam chain 72 is prevented from coming away from the drive sprocket by the guide plate 80 and the attachment bolt 81, but it is also possible to prevent the cam chain coming off using only a bolt head or a knock pin etc., instead of the guide plate [0055]<br>
An example of modification to the guide plate is shown in the following<br>
The guide plate 90 shown in Fig   10 to Fig. 13 has a fixing section 90b the same shape as the above described guide plate 80 and with a bolt hole 90 formed therein, an abutment section 90c and a guide section 90d, and a hook section 90e extends outwards from one side edge of a diagonally bent part of the guide section 90d [0056]<br>
If the guide plate 90 is fixed to an attachment boss section 26d of the crankcase 26 using an attachment bolt 91, the hook section 90e is positioned close to the cam chain 72, running along a left side surface of the cam chain 72 wrapped around the drive sprocket 70, as shown in Fig 13. [0057]<br>
Accordingly, in addition to the attachment bolt 91 and the guide section 90d, it is possible to reliably prevent the can chain 72 coming off the drive sprocket 70 by restricting deviation of the cam chain in the left direction with the hook section 90e.<br><br>
Deviation of the cam chain 72 in the right direction is restricted by the gear 69 so the cam chain 72 does not come off. [0058]<br>
A guide plate 95, being another modified example, will now be described with reference to Fig 14 to Fig. 18.<br>
Both ends of a horizontal plate section 95b having a bolt hole 95b formed therein are bent vertically, to respectively form vertical plate sections 95c and 95d, and upper ends of the vertical plate sections 95c and 05d are expanded in concentric arcs to form guide sections 95e and 95f [0059]<br>
If the guide plate 95 is fixed to the attachment boss section 26d of the crankcase 26 using an attachment bolt 96, the concentric arc shaped guide sections 95e and 95f form an arc with the crankshaft 25 at the center, as shown in Fig. 17 and Fig, 18, and are close to the cam chain 72 wrapped around the drive sprocket 70 on the cam chain line. [0060]<br>
Accordingly, with assembly of the cam chain as described above, if the hold on the cam chain 72 becomes loose when the cam chain 72 taken out from the cylinder side is held and the combined crankcase 26 and cylinder head 27 are turned over, both sides of the cam chain wrapped around the drive sprocket 70, as shown by the two dot chain line in Fig. 18, come into contact with the guide sections 95e and 95f, and the section of the cam chain wrapped around the central drive sprocket 70 is retained so that the cam chain 72 does not come off [0061]<br>
A guide plate 100 being another modified example will be described with reference to Fig. 19 to Fig. 22.<br>
This guide plate 100 is similar to the guide plate 90 described above, and a fixing section 100b having a bolt hole 100 formed therein, a guide section 100d and a hook section 100e are the same, but the abutment section 90c is not provided and instead a tip end of the guide section 100d is bent to form an abutment section 100c [0062]<br>
When the guide plate 100 is fixed to the attachment boss 26d of the crankcase 26 by the attachment bolt 101, the abutment section 100c bent from the guide section<br><br><br>
100d of the guide plate 100 in inserted into and abuts against an abutment groove 26e of the crankcase 26 for abutting a tip of the cam chain guide 75, as shown in Fig 22, and so when the attachment bolt is screwed into the attachment boss 26d, the guide plate 100 is prevented from turning and it is possible to improve the positional accuracy of the guide section 100d of the guide plate 100 with respect to the cam chain line [0063]<br>
The guide plate attached to the attachment boss 26d prevents deviation of the cam chain 72 in the left direction with the hook 100e in addition to the head of the attachment bolt 101 and the guide section 100d, making it possible to reliably prevent the cam chain 72 from coming off the drive sprocket 70<br><br><br><br><br>
