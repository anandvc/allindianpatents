				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>sealing material and a substrate material or a device to<br>
be sealed, cure shrinkage, and high-temperature conditions<br>
in reflowing or the like. As a result, the sealing material<br>
has the occurrence of the disadvantages such as interfacial<br>
peeling, cracks, and the like at the interface between the<br>
sealing material and the substrate or the device to be sealed.<br>
The following known methods have been widely employed to<br>
improve these disadvantages: for example, a method for.<br>
compounding a significantly large amount of a filler, such<br>
as silica, to bring the linear expansion coefficient of an<br>
epoxy resin composition close to that of a material of a<br>
substrate; or a method for adding a rubber component to an<br>
epoxy resin composition used to reduce the stress of the<br>
epoxy resin composition.<br>
[0003]<br>
As a method for improving impact resistance of an epoxy<br>
resin by addition of a rubber component or a method for<br>
reducing stress of an epoxy resin, there has been known,<br>
for example, a method of adding a reactive liquid rubber<br>
(e.g., carboxyl-terminated butadiene-acrylonitrile (CTBN) )<br>
or a nitrile rubber (e.g., Japanese Patent Publication No.<br>
62-34251). However, since the reactive liquid rubber is<br>
dissolved in an epoxy resin and then phase-separated during<br>
curing, the morphology of the resulting cured product is<br>
changed depending on the type of epoxy resin compounded and<br>
curing conditions; therefore, the effect of reducing stress<br>
is not desirably obtained, or reproducibility of quality<br>
is poor. In addition, since the rubber component is<br>
partially dissolved and remains in the epoxy resin phase<br><br>
after curing, the elasticity modulus, glass transition<br>
temperature (hereinafter, also referred to as "Tg") of the<br>
cured product, or adhesive strength between a sealing<br>
material and a substrate or a device to be sealed is decreased,<br>
thus degrading the quality of the sealing material.<br>
[0004]<br>
To solve the disadvantageous change in morphology due<br>
to the addition of the rubber component and to control the<br>
change in morphology, there has been known a method for<br>
conducting polymerization of a monomer, such as an acrylate,<br>
in an epoxy resin to prepare a composition containing rubber<br>
particles dispersed in the epoxy resin (Japanese Patent<br>
Laid-open Publication No. 59-138254) . However, the partial<br>
dissolution of the rubber component in the epoxy resin phase<br>
after curing is unavoidable even with the above-described<br>
process, and a glass transition temperature is decreased<br>
in some cases; hence, quality is insufficient.<br>
[0005]<br>
To solve such problems, a method for adding rubbery<br>
polymer particles insoluble in the epoxy resin to an epoxy<br>
resin has been known (for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open<br>
Publication No. 10-287792) . By employing this method, since<br>
the rubber component is not dissolved in the epoxy resin<br>
phase after curing, it is possible to suppress deterioration<br>
in heat resistance (glass transition temperature). In this<br>
case, the rubbery polymer particles are not prepared by<br>
polymerization in the epoxy resin, but previously prepared<br>
by polymerization before being mixed with the epoxy resin.<br>
Since such rubber particles each have a crosslinked<br><br>
structure therein, the structure of the particles is fixed.<br>
However, it is relatively difficult to impart satisfactory<br>
compatibility and affinity with the epoxy resin component<br>
to the rubber particles. Furthermore, despite the<br>
crosslinked structure, in practical handling, it is more<br>
difficult to disperse the particles because of the<br>
occurrence of fusion or adhesion of the surfaces of the<br>
rubber particles. Therefore, in a step of adding the rubber<br>
particles to the epoxy resin, it is necessary to, for example,<br>
previously mix a compound, such as talc, used for preventing<br>
blocking of the rubber particles, or it is necessary to<br>
adequately perform kneading under high shear force for a<br>
long time to disperse the particles in the epoxy resin.<br>
Furthermore, in a step of curing the epoxy resin, there is<br>
a possibility of reaggregation of the rubber-particle<br>
component that has been dispersed once. Thus, it is not<br>
easy to obtain a desired dispersion state, and a satisfactory<br>
performance is not always exhibited.<br>
[0006]<br>
Furthermore, to improve an affinity in the interface<br>
between the rubber particle component and the epoxy resin<br>
and to improve a dispersion state of the rubber particles<br>
in a resin matrix component, a method for adding what is<br>
called core-shell polymer is employed. In order to improve<br>
impact resistance by finely dispersing a rubber particle<br>
phase in a resin matrix phase, a method for adding the<br>
core-shell polymer as the rubber component to the resin<br>
matrix phase have been widely tried in system using<br>
thermoplastic resins as dispersion media. And, in some of<br><br>
thermosetting resin systems, attempts to apply the<br>
above-described method have also been made (for example,<br>
US Patent Nos. 3322852 and 3496250). Such core-shell<br>
polymers have been widely available in the market under the<br>
trade name of Kane Ace (manufactured by Kaneka Corporation) ,<br>
Paraloid (manufactured by Rohm and Hass Company), and the<br>
like. However, typically, these are commercially available<br>
in the form of powders each having a particle size of several<br>
tens to several hundreds of micrometers, and the powders<br>
are constituted of aggregates of primary particles. Thus,<br>
when the core-shell polymers are mixed with epoxy resins,<br>
it is necessary to, for example, previously pulverize the<br>
powdered core-shell polymers into fine particles each having<br>
a particle size of less than 10 µm before mixing or to perform<br>
mixing under high shear force at high temperature during<br>
mixing. Even when the core-shell polymer is mixed with an<br>
epoxy resin through such a complicated procedure, the<br>
following problem often occurs: for example, a core-shell<br>
polymer that has been dispersed once is easily separated,<br>
e.g., precipitated or floated; or the particles of the<br>
core-shell polymer are not completely dispersed in the form<br>
of primary particles but are dispersed in the form of<br>
aggregates.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition to above, it is usually difficult to remove<br>
electrolytes such as emulsifiers and contaminants added<br>
during polymerization of a core-shell polymer effectively,<br>
from the core-shell polymer being in the form of a powder.<br>
These electrolytes or contaminants cause, for example, a<br><br>
crack during reflowing due to moisture absorption of the<br>
sealing material; or deterioration in electrical insulation,<br>
thus resulting in a drop of the reliance of the sealing<br>
material. To prevent this, for example, a highly specific<br>
method is required in the method including the steps of<br>
performing polymerization using a quite large amount of<br>
nonionic emulsifier having relatively low polymerization<br>
stability and then performing thermal aggregation at a<br>
cloudy point or higher temperature of the nonionic<br>
emulsifier without coagulation using an electrolyte; or in<br>
combination therewith isolating the resulting polymer by<br>
a special process, for example, spray drying or<br>
freeze-coagulation. Thus, the method is not enough<br>
practical. Furthermore, in such a method, even when a large<br>
amount of nonionic emulsifier is used, it is difficult to<br>
maintain polymerization stability during polymerization,<br>
thus polymerization stability may be insufficient when a<br>
core-shell polymer is prepared by multistage emulsion<br>
polymerization in commercial scale. Thus the method is not<br>
considered to be widely employed so far except for a few<br>
methods for preparing non-core-shell polymers by<br>
single-step emulsion polymerization.<br>
[0008]<br>
As described above, in the present circumstances, a<br>
known sealing material containing an epoxy resin composition<br>
compounded with a core-shell polymer in a powder form has<br>
not only poor handling property and inferior reproducibility<br>
of physical properties but also an unsatisfactory balance<br>
among heat resistance, peeling resistance, thermal shock<br><br>
resistance, moisture resistance reliability, and internal<br>
stress relaxation.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to these circumstances, in recent years,<br>
from the viewpoint of environmental protection, solder<br>
materials used for electrically connecting electronic<br>
devices have been moving from conventional lead-containing<br>
solder to lead-free solder. However, lead-free solder<br>
having satisfactory connection reliability similar to that<br>
of conventional lead-containing solder has a melting point<br>
of 30 °C to 40 °C higher than that of the conventional<br>
lead-containing solder, thus leading to a further increase<br>
in reflow temperature in mounting electrical devices in the<br>
future. In the present circumstances, the development of<br>
an epoxy resin sealing material having further improved<br>
balance among heat resistance, peeling resistance, thermal<br>
shock resistance, moisture resistance reliability, and<br>
internal stress relaxation is more highly desired beyond<br>
a level required for a conventional epoxy resin sealing<br>
material.<br>

To adjust the degree of crosslinking, a polyfunctional<br>
monomer may be contained as a component constituting the<br>
rubber elastomer. Examples of the polyfunctional monomer<br>
include divinylbenzene, butanediol di(meth)acrylate,<br>
triallyl (iso)cyanurate, allyl (meth)acrylate, diallyl<br>
itaconate, and diallyl phthalate. The amount of the<br>
polyfunctional monomer used is 10 percent by weight or less,<br>
preferably 5 percent by weight or less, and more preferably<br>
3 percent by weight or less for the total weight of core<br>
portion (B-1). Using amount of the polyfunctional monomer<br>
exceeding 10 percent by weight tend to drop the ability of<br>
stress reduction of an epoxy resin.<br>
[0034]<br>
To adjust the molecular weight or the degree of<br>
crosslinking of the polymer constituting the rubber<br>
elastomer, a chain-transfer agent may be used. A specific<br>
example thereof is an alkyl mercaptan having 5 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms. The amount of the chain-transfer agent used is 5<br>
percent by weight or less and more preferably 3 percent by<br><br>
weight or less for the total weight of core portion (B-1).<br>
At the amount of chain-transfer agent used exceeding 5<br>
percent by weight, in some cases, the amount of an<br>
uncrosslinked component in the rubber particle core (B-1)<br>
is increased, thus giving negative influences on, for<br>
example, heat resistance and viscosity of the epoxy resin<br>
composition.<br>
[0035]<br>
As the rubber particle core (B-1), a polysiloxane<br>
rubber may also be used instead of or in combination with<br>
the previously mentioned rubber elastomer. In the use of<br>
the polysiloxane rubber as the rubber particle core (B-1),<br>
examples of the polysiloxane rubber that can be used include<br>
polysiloxane rubbers containing an alkyl- or<br>
aryl-disubstituted silyloxy unit, such as dimethylsilyloxy,<br>
methylphenylsilyloxy, and diphenylsilyloxy. When such a<br>
polysiloxane rubber is used, if necessary, a crosslinked<br>
structure is preferably introduced by the following typical<br>
method: a method of adding a polyfunctional alkoxysilane<br>
compound in polymerization; a method of introducing a<br>
reactive group, such as a reactive vinyl group or a mercapto<br>
group, and then adding a vinyl-polymerizable monomer or an<br>
organic peroxide to cause radical reaction; or a method of<br>
adding a crosslinkable monomer, such as a polyfunctional<br>
vinyl compound or a mercapto group-containing compound,<br>
after polymerization for the polysiloxane rubber, and then<br>
performing polymerization.<br>
[0036]<br>
Preferably, from the stand point of the affinity<br><br>
between the epoxy resin and the core-shell polymer, a polymer<br>
constituting the shell layer (B-2) is grafted onto the<br>
polymer constituting the rubber particle core (B-1) by graft<br>
polymerization and is substantially bonded to the polymer<br>
constituting the rubber particle core (B-1) . In the polymer<br>
constituting the shell layer (B-2), preferably 70 percent<br>
by weight or more, more preferably 80 percent by weight or<br>
more, and still more preferably 90 percent by weight or more<br>
of the polymer is desirably bonded to the rubber particle<br>
core (B-1) .<br>
[0037]<br>
The shell layer (B-2) is intended to impart affinity<br>
for the epoxy resin (A) to the core-shell polymer (B) so<br>
that the core-shell polymer (B) is stably dispersed in the<br>
form of primary particles in the epoxy resin composition<br>
(C) . The shell layer (B-2) preferably has swelling property,<br>
miscibility (compatibility), or affinity to an organic<br>
solvent (I) described below and the epoxy resin (A) . In<br>
the present invention, "the core-shell polymer (B) being<br>
dispersed in the form of primary particles" means that the<br>
core-shell polymer particles are not aggregated together<br>
in the epoxy resin (A) , but each particle is dispersed<br>
independently.<br>
[0038]<br>
The shell layer (B-2) preferably has reactivity to<br>
the epoxy resin (A) or a curing agent compounded in the<br>
practical use, according to the necessity. This makes the<br>
shell layer (B-2) have the function of causing chemical<br>
reaction with the epoxy resin (A) or curing agent to form<br><br>
bondings under the conditions that the epoxy rein (A) is<br>
reacted with the curing agent to cause curing, whereby the<br>
re-aggregation of the core-shell polymer and deterioration<br>
of the dispersion state are effectively prevented under the<br>
curing conditions.<br>
[0039]<br>
The polymer constituting the shell layer (B-2) is<br>
preferably a (co)polymer prepared by copolymerization of<br>
at least one component selected from (meth)acrylates,<br>
aromatic vinyl compounds, vinylcyanide compounds,<br>
unsaturated acid derivatives, (meth)acrylamide derivatives,<br>
and maleimide derivatives. When the shell layer (B-2) is<br>
required to have chemical reactivity in curing the epoxy<br>
resin, it is more preferred to use a copolymer prepared by<br>
copolymerizing at least one monomer containing a functional<br>
group selected from an epoxy group, a carboxyl group, a<br>
hydroxyl group, a carbon-carbon double bond, and the like<br>
with at least one component selected from the<br>
(meth)acrylates, aromatic vinyl compounds, vinylcyanide<br>
compounds, unsaturated acid derivatives, (meth)acrylamide<br>
derivatives, or maleimide derivatives, the functional group<br>
having reactivity to the epoxy resin (A), a curing agent,<br>
or a curing catalyst described below. Among these, the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) particularly preferably contains an<br>
epoxy group as the reactive functional group so that the<br>
epoxy equivalent value is 4,500 or less for the total weight<br>
of the core-shell polymer (B) because it is possible to<br>
effectively suppress the reaggregation of the particles of<br>
the core-shell polymer (B) under curing conditions and<br><br>
ensure a satisfactory dispersion state before and after<br>
curing.<br>
[0040]<br>
Examples of the (meth)acrylates include alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylates such as methyl (meth)acrylate, ethyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, butyl (meth)acrylate, and 2-ethylhexyl<br>
(meth)acrylate. Examples of the aromatic vinyl compounds<br>
include styrene, (X-methylstyrene, alkyl-substituted<br>
styrene, and halogen-substituted styrenes such as<br>
bromostyrene and chlorostyrene. Examples of the<br>
vinylcyanide compounds include (meth)acrylonitrile and<br>
substituted acrylonitrile. Examples of the reactive<br>
functional group-containing monomers include reactive<br>
side-chain-containing (meth)acrylates such as<br>
2-hydroxyethyl (meth)acrylate, 2-aminoethyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
and glycidyl (meth)acrylate. Examples of a vinyl ether<br>
containing a reactive group include glycidyl vinyl ether<br>
and allyl vinyl ether. Examples of an unsaturated carboxylic<br>
acid derivative include (meth)acrylic acid, itaconic acid,<br>
crotonic acid, and maleic anhydride. An example of the<br>
(meth)acrylamide derivatives is (meth)acrylamide<br>
(including N-substituted (meth)acrylamide). An example of<br>
the maleimide derivatives is maleimide (including<br>
N-substituted maleimide).<br>
[0041]<br>
The weight ratio of the rubber particle core (B-1)<br>
to the shell layer (B-2) of the core-shell polymer (B), i.e.,<br>
(B-1)/(B-2), is preferably in the range of 40/60 to 95/5<br>
and more preferably 60/40 to 90/10. When the ratio of the<br><br>
core (B-1) decreases, and the ratio (B-1)/(B-2) is lower<br>
than the above range (40/60), there is a tendency to decrease<br>
the effect of stress reduction of the epoxy resin composition<br>
of the present invention. When the ratio of the shell layer<br>
(B-2) decreases, and the ratio (B-1)/(B-2) is larger than<br>
the above ratio (95/5), aggregation easily occurs during<br>
the process condition of the present invention. As a result,<br>
handling property becomes worse, and desired physical<br>
properties are not obtained, in some cases.<br>
[0042]<br>
A production method of the core-shell polymer (B) is<br>
not particularly limited and produced by a widely known<br>
method, such as emulsion polymerization, suspension<br>
polymerization, or microsuspension polymerization. Among<br>
these, a production method of multistage emulsion<br>
polymerization is suitable. Specific examples of an<br>
emulsifier (dispersant) used in an aqueous medium include<br>
alkali metal salts or ammonium salts of various acids, for<br>
example, alkylsulfonic acids, such as dioctyl sulfosuccinic<br>
acid, and arylsulfonic acids such as dodecylbenzenesulfonic<br>
acid; alkyl ether sulfonic acids and aryl ether sulfonic<br>
acids; alkylsulfuric acids, such as dodecylsulfuric acid,<br>
and arylsulfuric acids; alkyl or aryl ether sulfuric acids;<br>
alkyl- or aryl-substituted phosphoric acids; alkyl or aryl<br>
ether-substituted phosphoric acids; N-alkylsarcosines,<br>
such as dodecylsarcosine, and arylsarcosines;<br>
alkylcarboxylic acids, such as oleic acid and stearic acid,<br>
and arylcarboxylic acids; and alkyl or aryl ether carboxylic<br>
acids ; nonionic emulsifiers or dispersants, such as alkyl<br><br>
or aryl-substituted polyethylene glycol; and other<br>
dispersants, such as polyvinyl alcohol, alkyl-substituted<br>
cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyacrylic acid<br>
derivatives. These compounds may be used alone or in<br>
appropriate combination.<br>
[0043]<br>
In view of the gist of preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention, each of these emulsifiers (dispersants)<br>
is more preferably used in an as small amount as possible<br>
without interference with dispersion stability in a step<br>
of preparing a latex of the core-shell polymer (B) .<br>
Alternatively, each of these emulsifiers (dispersants) more<br>
preferably has water-solubility so as to be extracted and<br>
removed during the process of preparing the epoxy resin<br>
composition of the present invention to the extent that the<br>
remaining emulsifier (dispersant) has no negative influence<br>
on physical properties of the epoxy resin composition to<br>
be produced.<br>
[0044]<br>
The content of the core-shell polymer (B) that can<br>
be used in the present invention is usually in the range<br>
of 1 to 50 percent by weight, preferably 2 to 20 percent<br>
by weight, and more preferably 3 to 10 percent by weight<br>
for the total weight of the epoxy resin composition (C) or<br>
the epoxy resin composition containing the epoxy resin<br>
composition (C) in combination with an appropriate epoxy<br>
resin according to need. When the content of the core-shell<br>
polymer (B) is less than 1 percent by weight, effect of stress<br>
reduction may not be enough obtained. When the content of<br><br>
the core-shell polymer (B) exceeds 50 percent by weight,<br>
the resulting epoxy resin molding material for sealing<br>
semiconductor devices may not have enough heat resistance.<br>
[0045]<br>
The particle size of the core-shell polymer (B) that<br>
can be used in the present invention is not particularly<br>
limited. Any particle size can be used as long as the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) can be stably obtained in the form<br>
of an aqueous latex. From the standpoint of industrial<br>
productivity, i.e., ease of production, the volume-average<br>
particle size is preferably 0 . 03 to 2 . 0 (Jm and more preferably<br>
0.04 to 1.0 Jim. The volume-average particle size of the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) can be measured by a known method,<br>
for example, using Microtrac UPA (manufactured by Nikkiso<br>
Co., Ltd.).<br>
[0046]<br>
The epoxy resin composition (C) used in an epoxy resin<br>
molding material of the present invention is preferably<br>
prepared by a specific production process. An example of<br>
the specific production process is a process in which the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) prepared in the form of an aqueous<br>
latex is mixed with an organic solvent to transfer the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) into an organic phase, thus resulting<br>
in a dispersion (E) containing the core-shell polymer (B)<br>
dispersed in the organic solvent, and then the resulting<br>
dispersion (E) is mixed with the epoxy resin (A) . The epoxy<br>
resin composition (C) used in an epoxy resin molding material<br>
of the present invention is preferably prepared by such a<br><br>
specific production process. By employing the production<br>
process, it is possible to prepare an epoxy resin composition<br>
in which most of the core-shell polymer (B) is dispersed<br>
in the form of primary particles in the epoxy resin (A) matrix,<br>
and in the same time, contaminants such as an emulsifier<br>
and alkali metal ions, usually contained in a core-shell<br>
polymer are significantly decreased. Examples of such a<br>
process include processes disclosed in Japanese Patent<br>
Application Nos. 2003-107882, 2003-164416, and 2003-326711.<br>
[0047]<br>
To be more specific, an exemplary process for producing<br>
the dispersion (E) containing the core-shell polymer (B)<br>
dispersed in the organic solvent includes bringing a mixture<br>
(F) of an aqueous latex containing the core-shell polymer<br>
(B) and a specific organic solvent (I) into contact with<br>
water to form aggregates (G) of the core-shell polymer (B)<br>
including the organic solvent (I) in an aqueous phase (H);<br>
separating the aggregates (G); and redispersing the<br>
aggregates (G) into an organic solvent (I).<br>
[0048]<br>
By mixing the resulting dispersion (E) with the epoxy<br>
resin (A) and, if necessary, by removing a volatile component<br>
including the organic solvent, it is possible to produce<br>
the epoxy resin composition (C) used in an epoxy resin<br>
molding material of an present invention.<br>
[0049]<br>
An alternative process for producing the epoxy resin<br>
composition (C) includes mixing the resulting aggregates<br><br>
(G) with the epoxy resin (A).<br>
[0050]<br>
In the epoxy resin composition (C) prepared by such<br>
processes, most of the core-shell polymer (B) is dispersed<br>
in the form of primary particles in the epoxy resin (A) matrix.<br>
To be specific, preferably at least 70% of the core-shell<br>
polymer (B) and more preferably at least 90% of the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) is dispersed in the form of primary<br>
particles in the epoxy resin (A) matrix.<br>
[0051]<br>
Furthermore, another advantage of these processes is<br>
that, in the step of transferring the core-shell polymer<br>
(B) from the aqueous latex containing the core-shell polymer<br>
(B) into the organic phase, most of electrolytes or<br>
water-soluble materials, such as an emulsif ier, a dispersant,<br>
a water-soluble polymerization initiator, and a reductant,<br>
used in preparing the aqueous latex containing the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) are eluted to the aqueous phase when<br>
the aggregates (G) are formed and thus can be removed from<br>
the aggregates (G) due to the difference of distribution<br>
ratio (between organic solvent phase and aqueous phase).<br>
Therefore, such water-soluble contaminants can be<br>
decreased or removed effectively and efficiently while<br>
performing the step of dispersing the core-shell polymer<br>
(B) into the organic solvent.<br>
[0052]<br>
More preferably, by bringing the dispersion (E)<br>
containing the core-shell polymer (B) in the organic solvent<br>
into contact with water and then performing the step of<br><br>
separating and removing the resulting aqueous phase at least<br>
once before mixing the dispersion (E) with the epoxy resin<br>
(A), the core-shell polymer (B) being prepared by the<br>
above-described process, it is possible to further decrease<br>
the contents of water-soluble contaminants, such as an<br>
emulsifier, a dispersant, a water-soluble polymerization<br>
initiator, and a reductant, used in preparing the aqueous<br>
latex of the core-shell polymer (B) or to remove these<br>
compounds from the dispersion (E). In particular, it is<br>
possible to further decrease the contents of alkali metal<br>
ions or to remove the ions.<br>
[0053]<br>
In the epoxy resin composition (C) prepared by the<br>
above-described process, preferably 80 percent by weight<br>
or more, more preferably 90 percent by weight or more, and<br>
particularly preferably 95 percent by weight or more of an<br>
anionic emulsifier used in polymerization for the core-shell<br>
polymer (B) is removed. As a result, it is possible to obtain<br>
an epoxy resin composition in which the content of the<br>
anionic emulsifier in the epoxy resin composition (C) is<br>
preferably 100 ppm or less, more preferably 60 ppm or less,<br>
and particularly preferably 30 ppm or less. The residual<br>
emulsifier may be determined, for example, by colorimetry<br>
as follows: the dispersion (E) before being mixed with the<br>
epoxy resin (A) is exsiccated, and the emulsifier is<br>
extracted with ethanol. The determination of the resulting<br>
extract is performed by colorimetry with methylene blue at<br>
a wavelength of 650 run.<br>
[0054]<br><br>
The contents of the alkali metal ions of the epoxy<br>
resin composition (C) prepared in the present invention are<br>
preferably 30 ppm or less, more preferably 15 ppm or less,<br>
and particularly preferably 10 ppm or less. The contents<br>
of the alkali metal ions may be determined for example by<br>
the following method: the epoxy resin composition (C) is<br>
decomposed by acidolysis under pressure, and then the<br>
resulting decomposition product is measured by inductively<br>
high-frequency induction plasma atomic emission<br>
spectrochemical analysis.<br>
[0055]<br>
Examples of the specific organic solvent (I) mixed<br>
with the aqueous latex containing the core-shell polymer<br>
(B) include esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl acetate,<br>
propyl acetate, and butyl acetate; ketones such as acetone,<br>
methyl ethyl ketone, diethyl ketone, and methyl isobutyl<br>
ketone; alcohols such as ethanol, (iso)propanol, and<br>
butanol; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, tetrahydropyran,<br>
dioxane, and diethyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbons such as<br>
benzene, toluene, and xylenes; and halogenated hydrocarbons<br>
such as methylene chloride and chloroform. These organic<br>
solvents may be used alone or in a mixture thereof. In<br>
particular, an exemplary organic solvent preferably has a<br>
water solubility of 5 percent by weight to 40 percent by<br>
weight at 20 °C. When the organic solvent (I) has a water<br>
solubility of less than 5 percent by weight, it tends to<br>
be rather difficult to mix the solvent with the aqueous latex<br>
containing the core-shell polymer (B) . On the contrary,<br>
when the organic solvent (I) has a water solubility exceeding<br><br>
40 percent by weight, it tends to become increasingly<br>
difficult to efficiently separate and remove the aqueous<br>
phase after adding the organic solvent immiscible with<br>
water-soluble electrolytes or the aqueous latex. The<br>
organic solvent (I) added to the aggregates (G) in preparing<br>
the dispersion (E) is not necessarily identical to the<br>
specific organic solvent (I) mixed with the aqueous latex<br>
containing the core-shell polymer (B) .<br>
[0056]<br>
A known process may be available for removing a<br>
volatile component containing the organic solvent from the<br>
mixture containing the resulting epoxy resin composition<br>
(C). Examples of the process include a batch process for<br>
feeding the mixture into a vessel and then removing by<br>
distillation (under reduced pressure); a process for<br>
bringing the mixture into countercurrent contact with a dry<br>
gas in a vessel; a continuous process such as using a film<br>
evaporator; a process using an extruder or continuous<br>
stirring vessel equipped with a vent or evaporating system.<br>
Processing conditions, such as temperate and time required,<br>
during removal of the volatile component may be<br>
appropriately selected within a range in which the epoxy<br>
resin (A) is not reacted or quality is not impaired. Such<br>
a process for removing the volatile component may be<br>
performed after addition of a curing agent or an additive<br>
depending on various applications for convenience of the<br>
applications.<br>
[0057]<br>
An epoxy resin molding material of the present<br><br>
invention maybe obtained by appropriately mixing the<br>
resulting epoxy resin composition (C) or an epoxy resin<br>
composition containing the epoxy resin composition (C) in<br>
combination with a suitable epoxy resin according to need<br>
with at least one curing agent (K) or, curing catalyst, and<br>
an inorganic filler (L), and if necessary, an additive or<br>
a compound agent, such as a curing accelerator (M), a flame<br>
retardant, a coupling agent, a mold-releasing agent, or a<br>
pigment that are usually used for a semiconductor sealing<br>
material. Typical additives and compound agents used in<br>
this field may be used without problems.<br>
[0058]<br>
Examples of the curing agent (K) that can be used<br>
include phenol resins such as a phenol novolac; aliphatic<br>
amines; aromatic amines; and carboxylic acid derivatives<br>
such as acid anhydrides or blocked carboxylic acids. Among<br>
these, from the standpoint of high heat resistance of a cured<br>
product to be obtained, the phenol resin is more preferably<br>
used. The content of the curing agent (K) varies depending<br>
on the sealing form for semiconductor devices but is usually<br>
1 to 300 parts by weight for the epoxy resin composition<br>
(C) or the epoxy resin composition containing the epoxy resin<br>
composition (C) in combination with an appropriate epoxy<br>
resin according to need.<br>
[0059]<br>
Examples of the curing accelerator (M) include<br>
imidazole compounds; tertiary amine compounds; and<br>
phosphine compounds such as triphenylphosphine. When<br>
photo-curing is applied, examples of the curing catalyst<br><br>
that can be used include aromatic sulfonium salts, aromatic<br>
diazonium salts, and aromatic iodonium salts. A known<br>
sensitizer, such as an anthracene derivative, may be used<br>
in appropriate combination. The content of the curing<br>
accelerator (M) or the curing catalyst varies depending on<br>
the sealing form for semiconductor devices but is usually<br>
0.01 to 50 parts by weight for the epoxy resin composition<br>
(C) or the epoxy resin composition containing the epoxy resin<br>
composition (C) in combination with an appropriate epoxy<br>
resin according to need.<br>
[0060]<br>
Examples of the inorganic filler (L) that can be used<br>
include fused silica, crystalline silica, alumina, calcium<br>
carbonate, boron nitride, and silicon carbide. The content<br>
of the inorganic filler (L) varies depending on the sealing<br>
form for semiconductor devices but is usually 0 to 2,000<br>
parts by weight for 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin<br>
composition (C) or the epoxy resin composition containing<br>
the epoxy resin composition (C) in combination with an<br>
appropriate epoxy resin according to need.<br>
[0061]<br>
Examples of the flame retardant that can be used<br>
include bromobisphenol-A epoxy resin; other bromine-based<br>
flame retardants; phosphorus-based flame retardants such<br>
as condensed phosphates; metal hydroxide-based flame<br>
retardants such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum<br>
hydroxide; and silicone resin-based flame retardants such<br>
as polysiloxane derivatives. The content of the flame<br>
retardant varies depending on the sealing form for<br><br>
semiconductor devices but is usually about 0 to 100 parts<br>
by weight for 100 parts by weight of the epoxy resin<br>
composition (C) or the epoxy resin composition containing<br>
the epoxy resin composition (C) in combination with an<br>
appropriate epoxy resin according to need. These flame<br>
retardants may be used alone or in appropriate combination.<br>
[0062]<br>
Examples of the coupling agent include epoxysilanes,<br>
aminosilanes, alkylsilanes, vinylsilanes, and<br>
organotitanates. Examples of the mold-releasing agent<br>
include natural wax, synthetic wax, and esters. An example<br>
of a colorant is carbon black. The contents of the coupling<br>
agent, the mold-releasing agent, and the colorant vary<br>
depending on the sealing form for semiconductor devices but<br>
each are usually about 0 to 50 parts by weight for 100 parts<br>
by weight of the epoxy resin composition (C) or the epoxy<br>
resin composition containing the epoxy resin composition<br>
(C) in combination with an appropriate epoxy resin according<br>
to need.<br>
[0063]<br>
Examples of a general method for producing an epoxy<br>
resin molding material of the present invention using such<br>
materials includes a method for mixing predetermined amounts<br>
of materials fed with a mixer or the like, melt-kneading<br>
the resulting mixture by heat rollers or the like, and<br>
forming a shape or pulverizing the mixture under cooling;<br>
and a method for mixing and dissolving the predetermined<br>
amounts of materials fed in an organic solvent, applying<br><br>
the resulting solution onto a support composed of polyimide,<br>
glass, or the like, and drying the solution to produce a<br>
molding material in the form of a sheet. These methods have<br>
been widely used. In mixing these materials, the core-shell<br>
polymer (B) has been stably dispersed in the form of primary<br>
particles in the epoxy resin composition (C). Therefore,<br>
it is possible to mix the materials easily and uniformly<br>
without a special apparatus. In mixing and curing, since<br>
the shell portion of the core-shell polymer (B) has an<br>
affinity for or reactivity to the epoxy resin, the dispersion<br>
failure or reaggregation of the core-shell polymer (B) does<br>
not occur. Therefore, an epoxy resin molding material for<br>
sealing semiconductor devices can be prepared, the epoxy<br>
resin molding material having satisfactory reproducibility<br>
of physical properties.<br>
[0064]<br>
When the epoxy resin molding material of the present<br>
invention is used as a semiconductor sealing material, a<br>
known method, such as transfer molding, injection molding,<br>
a method for directly bonding an electronic device onto a<br>
substrate and, at the same time, sealing the device with<br>
a sealing material of a liquid or semi-cured sheet epoxy<br>
resin material, cast molding, or compression molding, may<br>
be widely available.<br>
[0065]<br>
Examples<br>
The present invention will be described in detail based<br>
on Examples. However, the present invention is not limited<br>
to these Examples.<br><br>
[0066]<br>
Hereinafter, the amount of residual impurities was<br>
analyzed using the amount of emulsifier (anionic surfactant)<br>
and the total amount of ions as indicators. After<br>
preparation of an ultrα-thin section of a cured product<br>
prepared from the resulting epoxy resin composition, the<br>
dispersion state of a core-shell polymer in an epoxy resin<br>
component was observed and evaluated with a transmission<br>
electron microscope (TEM).<br>
[0067]<br>
Methods of analysis and measurement employed in the<br>
present invention will now be described before Examples.<br>
[0068]<br>
[1] Amount of residual emulsifier<br>
With respect to the amount of residual emulsifier,<br>
the amount of emulsifier remaining in a dispersion (E) before<br>
being mixed with an epoxy resin (A) was measured by an<br>
analytical method described below. The ratio (percent by<br>
weight) of the resulting amount of emulsifier to 100 percent<br>
by weight of the total amount of emulsifier used for<br>
polymerization of a core-shell polymer (B) was calculated<br>
and used as indicator. Furthermore, after preparation of<br>
an epoxy resin composition (C), the weight ratio (ppm) of<br>
the amount of emulsifier remaining in the system to the<br>
amount of the system was calculated and then used as an<br>
indicator.<br>
[0069]<br>
[1-1] Sample pretreatment<br>
In methods described in Examples described below, 5<br><br>
mL of the dispersion (E) of the core-shell polymer (B) before<br>
being mixed with the epoxy resin (A) was exsiccated. The<br>

To a 100-L pressure-resistant reactor, 200 parts by<br>
weight of water 0.03 parts by weight of tripotassium<br>
phosphate, 0.25 parts by weight of potassium dihydrogen<br>
phosphate, 0.002 parts by weight of<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.001 parts by weight of<br>

dodecylbenzenesulfonate were charged. After nitrogen purge<br>
was sufficiently performed under stirring to remove oxygen,<br>
75 parts by weight of butadiene and 25 parts by weight of<br>
styrene were added to the system, and the temperature was<br>
raised to 45°C. Then, 0.015 parts by weight of p-menthane<br>
hydroperoxide and 0.04 parts by weight of sodium<br>
formaldehyde sulfoxylate were added thereto to initiate<br>
polymerization. At 4 hours after initiation of the<br>
polymerization, 0.01 parts by weight of p-menthane<br>
hydroperoxide, 0.0015 parts by weight of<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 0.001 parts by weight<br>
of ferrous sulfate were added. At 10 hours after initiation<br>
of the polymerization, residual monomers were devolatilized<br>
under reduced pressure to complete the polymerization. The<br>
polymerization conversion was 98%. The resulting<br>
styrene-butadiene rubber latex had a volume average particle<br>
diameter of 0.1 |Jin.<br>
[0088]<br><br>
To a 3-L glass vessel, 1,300 g of the resulting rubber<br>
latex (containing 420 g of styrene-butadiene rubber<br>
particles and 1.5 percent by weight of sodium<br>
dodecylbenzenesulfonate as an emulsifier for the solid<br>
content of the rubber) and 440 g of pure water were fed.<br>
The resulting mixture was stirred at 70 °C under nitrogen<br>
purging. After addition of 1.2 g of azobisisobutyronitrile<br>
(AIBN), a mixture of 60 g of styrene, 50 g of methyl<br>
methacrylate, 30 g of acrylonitrile, and 40 g of glycidyl<br>
methacrylate was continuously added over a period of 3 hours<br>
to perform graft polymerization. After completion of the<br>
addition, stirring was continued for another 2 hours to<br>
finish the reaction, thereby resulting in a core-shell<br>
polymer (B) latex. The polymerization conversion was 99.5%.<br>
The resulting latex was used without any conditioning.<br>
[0089]<br>
Example 1<br>
To a 1-L vessel (inner diameter: 100 mm) equipped with<br>
a stirrer (with 3 impellers provided on the shaft in the<br>
axial direction, each impeller 75 mm in diameter having 4<br>
flat paddles), 126 g of methyl ethyl ketone (solubility in<br>
water: 10 percent by weight at 20 °C) was charged. Then,<br>
126 g of the aqueous core-shell polymer (B) latex prepared<br>
in Production example 1 was added under stirring at 500 rpm.<br>
After the mixture was mixed into a homogeneous mixture,<br>
200 g of water was added at a feeding speed of 80 g/min under<br>
stirring at 500 rpm. After completion of the addition,<br>
stirring was stopped immediately to obtain a slurry<br>
including floating aggregates (G) and an aqueous phase<br><br>
containing a part of the organic solvent. Next, 348 g of<br>
the aqueous phase was drained from a discharge port at the<br>
base of the vessel while leaving the aggregates (G)<br>
containing a part of the aqueous phase. The aggregates (G)<br>
containing a part of the aqueous phase weighed 104 g. The<br>
ratio of the organic solvent to the entire weight of the<br>
aggregates was 39 percent by weight. The aggregates (G)<br>
were floating ability. The particles of the aggregates had<br>
particle size distribution. Samples of the aggregates were<br>
analyzed by image analysis. As a result, the number-average<br>
particle diameter was about 5 mm. The concentration of the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) in the drained aqueous phase was 0.1<br>
percent by weight. The resulting aggregates (G) were<br>
filtered and dehydrated with a filter mounted on a suction<br>
flask and dried in a nitrogen atmosphere at 40 °C for 12<br>
hours in a box dryer to obtain core-shell polymer (B)<br>
particles. The resulting aggregates were sampled, and<br>
methyl ethyl ketone was added to form a dispersion dope.<br>
The residual emulsifier and electrolytes were measured.<br>
As a result, the rates of removal were 95% and 90%,<br>
respectively. Next, 65 g of methyl ethyl ketone was added<br>
to 50.0 g of the resulting aggregates. The resulting mixture<br>
was mixed for 30 minutes under stirring at 500 rpm to form<br>
a homogeneous dispersion containing the core-shell polymer.<br>
The dispersion was placed in a 1-L vessel (inner diameter:<br>
100 mm) equipped with a jacket and a stirrer (with an impeller<br>
90 mm in diameter having an anchor blade), and 169.0 g of<br>
o-cresol novolac-type epoxy resin (Sumiepoxy ESCN 195XL-4<br>
manufactured by Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd.) was added<br><br>
thereto. After the mixture was mixed into a homogeneous<br>
mixture, the jacket temperature was set at 110 CC. A volatile<br>
component was distilled off under reduced pressure with a<br>
vacuum pump (TSW-150, oil-sealed rotary vacuum pump,<br>
manufactured by Sato Vac Inc). The distillation was<br>
continued until the concentration of the volatile component<br>
reached a predetermined value (5,000 ppm). A nitrogen gas<br>
was introduced into the vessel to allow the internal pressure<br>
to return to atmospheric pressure. Then, the contents in<br>
a molten state were cast on a fluorocarbon resin sheet and<br>
left standing to cool and solidify, followed by<br>
pulverization to form a flaky, pale yellow epoxy resin<br>
composition. The time required for volatilization was 4<br>
hours. The content of the alkali metal ions of this epoxy<br>
resin composition was 9.0 ppm. The content of the residual<br>
emulsifier was 53 ppm. As a result of the observation of<br>
the dispersion state of the core-shell polymer in a cured<br>
product produced from this epoxy resin composition, the<br>
core-shell polymer was homogeneously dispersed without<br>
aggregation. An epoxy resin molding material for sealing<br>
semiconductor devices was prepared using the resulting epoxy<br>
resin composition in amounts shown in Table 1, and then<br>
physical properties were evaluated. Table 2 shows the<br>
evaluation results.<br>
[0090]<br>
Example 2<br>
An epoxy resin molding material was produced using<br>
the epoxy resin composition prepared in EXAMPLE 1 in amounts<br>
shown in Table 1, and physical properties were evaluated.<br><br>

[0091]<br>
Example 3<br>
To a 1-L vessel equipped with a stirrer (inner<br>
diameter: 100 mm, stirrer with an impeller 56 mm in diameter<br>
having three retreating blades), 144 g of methyl ethyl ketone<br>
was charged. Then, 144 g of the aqueous core-shell polymer<br>
(B) latex prepared in Production example 1 was added under<br>
stirring at 400 rpm, and the resulting mixture was mixed<br>
into a homogeneous mixture. Then, 207 g of water was<br>
introduced carefully from a discharge port at the base of<br>
the vessel without stirring, and the resulting mixture was<br>
stirred at 400 rpm for 2 minutes. After completion of the<br>
stirring, a slurry including aggregates (G) (floating) and<br>
an aqueous phase containing a part of the organic solvent<br>
was obtained. Next, 373 g of the aqueous phase was drained<br>
from the discharge port at the base of the vessel while<br>
leaving the aggregates (G) containing a part of the aqueous<br>
phase. The aggregates (G) containing a part of the aqueous<br>
phase weighed 122 g. The ratio of the organic solvent to<br>
the entire weight of the aggregates (G) was 45 percent by<br>
weight. The number-average particle diameter of the<br>
aggregates (G) was about 5 mm. The concentration of the<br>
core-shell polymer (B.) in the drained aqueous phase was 0.2<br>
percent by weight. Hereinafter, core-shell polymer (B)<br>
particles were obtained by the same procedure as that in<br>
EXAMPLE 1. Methyl ethyl ketone was added to sampling of<br>
the resulting aggregates to form a dispersion dope. The<br>
residual emulsifier and electrolytes were measured. As a<br><br>
result, the rates of removal were 92% and 87%, respectively.<br>
Next, 120 g of methyl ethyl ketone was added to 70.0 g of<br>
the resulting aggregates. The resulting mixture was mixed<br>
for 30 minutes under stirring at 500 rpm to form a homogeneous<br>
dispersion (E) containing the core-shell polymer (B). This<br>
dispersion (E) was placed in a 1-L vessel (inner diameter:<br>
100 mm) equipped with a jacket and a stirrer (with an impeller<br>
90 mm in diameter having anchor blade), 117.8 g of a<br>
biphenyl-type epoxy resin (YX4000H, manufactured by Japan<br>
Epoxy Resins Co., Ltd.) was added thereto. After the mixture<br>
was mixed into a homogeneous mixture, the jacket temperature<br>
was set at 90 °C. A volatile component was distilled off<br>
under reduced pressure with a vacuum pump (TSW-150,<br>
oil-sealed rotary vacuum pump, manufactured by Sato Vac<br>
Inc.). The distillation was continued until the<br>
concentration of the volatile component reached a<br>
predetermined value (5,000 ppm). A nitrogen gas was<br>
introduced into the vessel to allow the internal pressure<br>
to return to atmospheric pressure. Then, the contents in<br>
a molten state were cast on a fluorocarbon resin sheet and<br>
left standing to cool and solidfy, followed by pulverization<br>
to form a flaky, pale yellow epoxy resin composition (C).<br>
The time required for volatilization was 5 hours. The<br>
content of the alkali metal ions of this epoxy resin<br>
composition was 19.6 ppm. The content of the residual<br>
emulsifier was 47 ppm. As a result of the observation of<br>
the dispersion state of the core-shell polymer (B) in a cured<br>
product produced from this epoxy resin composition, the<br>
core-shell polymer (B) was homogeneously dispersed without<br><br>
aggregation. An epoxy resin molding material for sealing<br>
semiconductor devices was prepared using the resulting epoxy<br>
resin composition in amounts shown in Table 1, and then<br>
physical properties were evaluated. Table 2 shows the<br>
evaluation results.<br>

axial direction, each impeller 75 mm in diameter having 4<br>
flat paddles), 500 g of the aqueous core-shell polymer (B)<br>
latex prepared in Production example 1. Then, 13 g of a<br>
35% by weight calcium chloride (CaClz) aqueous solution was<br>
added as a coagulant under stirring at 400 rpm to form<br>
aggregates. The resulting slurry containing the aggregates<br>
was heated to 60°C and cooled to 23°C under stirring. This<br>

The results clearly show that use of the inventive<br>
epoxy resin molding material for a semiconductor sealing<br>
material reduces a satisfactory dispersion of a core-shell<br>
polymer and decreases the amounts of residual emulsifier<br>
and metal ions that cause decreased moisture resistance<br>
reliability. Furthermore, satisfactory heat resistance,<br>
good peeling resistance, and a high effect of decreasing<br>
internal stress can be achieved.<br><br>
