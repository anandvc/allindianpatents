				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a protection of glass<br>
windows during storm corditions; and, more particularly, to the<br>
use of a polymeric foam layer applied to the exterior of a glass<br>
pane to protect the glass pane from shattering and from damage<br>
due to high winds and wird-borne debris.<br>
Discussion of the Prior Art<br>
Protection of glass panes in buildings during storms has<br>
been a great problem in the past and many efforts nave been made<br>
to prevent the glass pares from shattering and falling into the<br>
building due to high winds, projectiles and debris thereby<br>
damaging the interior of the building due to the glass and due to<br>
wind and rain damage through the breached glass pane. Prior art<br>
attempts to protect glass panes in buildings from storm damage<br>
have included prefabricated storm shutters, plywood sheets,<br>
lamination systems and taping. Storm shutters are normally made<br>
of aluminum or other lightweight metal alloys, fiberglass<br>
acrylate, a polyvinyl or other plastic. Storm shutters are<br>
fabricated to fit the exact measurements of window<br><br>
structures, including glass panes, to be protected and have the<br>
disadvantages of being expensive and requiring substantial time<br>
for fabrication such that storm shutters are not available unless<br>
ordered well in advance of storm. Plywood sheets are generally<br>
sold in 1.2192 meters by 2.4384 m sheets with a thickness of<br>
1.588 cm such that the plywood sheets weight approximately<br>
22.6795 Kg each. The plysood sheets must be cut to fit the size<br>
of the window structures and are normally drilled and screwed<br>
into the building or wirdow frame requiring craftsmanship, labor<br>
and hardware and, thus, having the disadvantages of being<br>
expensive and requiring substantial time to cover windows when a<br>
storm is approaching as well as being extremely heavy, lamination<br>
systems, such as those supplied by 3M Corporation (e.g.<br>
Scotchshield) have the disadvantages that they are films applied<br>
to the interior of the glass panes in that they are designed to<br>
prevent shattered glass from collapsing to thereby prevent rain<br>
damage and glass fragments from becoming projectiles. The film is<br>
not particularly effective in preventing the glass from<br>
shattering and does not make the glass more shatter resistant.<br>
Since the film is on the interior of the glass, it cannot absorb<br>
enough energy from the glass fast enough<br><br><br>
to prevent a failure or fracture of the glass if the glass pane is struck by debris or<br>
projectiles. Accordingly, the primary use of lamination systems is to prevent shattered<br>
glass from falling; apart. Taping of windows results, at best, in the holding of most of<br>
arractured glass pane in place to reduce rain damage and the risk of individuals being<br>
cut.<br>
U.S. Patents No. 3,830,670 to Bengston and No. 4,596,725 to Kluth et al are<br>
exemplary of polyurethane foams and discuss one-component and two-component<br>
polyurethanes. U.S. Patents No. 3,455,865 to Bolt et al, No. 3,486,918 to Motter, No.<br>

Woodhall et al and No. 5,523,117 ro Woodhall et al, are representative of polymeric<br>
films or layers for glass and/or polymeric films or layers removable by peeling. None<br>
of the above patents disclose or contemplate the use of a polymeric foam to protect a<br>
glass pane of a window structure installed in a building for protection against damage<br>
from storms.<br>
From the above, it will be appreciated that there is a great need for prsection<br>
of glass panes in window structures installed in buildings due to storms where the<br>
protection can be quickly applied and is inexpensive while also being easily removed.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide protection for glass<br>
panes overcoming the abovementioned disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present inventions to protect glass panes in buildings from<br>
storm damage by temporarily applying or adhering a polymeric foam layer on the glass<br>
pane and, after the storm passes, removing the polymeric foam layer by peeling or<br>
stripping the layer from the glass pane.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to apply a polymeric foam, such as<br>
high impact styrene or a polyurethane foam layer to a glass pane of a window structure<br>
in a building to absorb energy from debris during a storm and to maintain the integrity<br>
of the glass par:e in the event of damage thereto.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to adhere a polyurethane foam layer<br>
to the outside surface of a glass pane to produce a temporarily protected window<br>
structure in a building.<br>
Some of the advantages of the present invention over the prior art are that tre<br>
polymeric foam layer protects glass panes from shattering in wind storms, is easy to<br>
apply, and can be applied by spraying in substantially less time than required for other<br>
glass pane protection systems with no measuring required, containers for the<br>
compositions of the polymeric foam layer can be small, the weight of the polymeric<br>
foam layer is insubstantial, the polymeric foam layer can be easily removed by peeling<br>
from the exterior window structure surface either from the exterior of the building or, if<br>
the windows can be opened, from the interior of the building, a two-component<br>
polyurethane system provides long shelf life such that an individual can be prepared<br>
at all times, the polymeric foam layer can be installed by one person, can be<br>
translucent to et light in and will not lose its shape or protective qualities when wet by<br>
rain.<br>
The present invention is generally characterized in a method of protecting a<br>
glass pane installed in a building from damage during a storm comprising the steps of<br>
before the storm arrives, applying a polymeric foam layer to the exterior of the glass<br>
pane and, after the storm has passed, peeling the polymeric foam layer from the glass<br>
pane. Preferably, the polymeric foam layer is a polyurethane foam having cells<br>
absorbing energy from wind-borne debris, wind and driven rain. The present invention<br>
is further generally characterized in a window structure instated in a building<br>
comprising a glass pane having an exterior surface, a frame mounting the glass pane<br>
to the buildings and a layer of polyurethane foam disposed on the exterior surface of<br>
the glass pane for protecting the glass pane from storm damage, the layer of<br>
polyurethane foam being peelable for removal from the glass pane.<br>
Other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent<br>
from the follow ng description of the preferred embodiments taken in conjunction with<br>
the accompanying drawings wherein like pats in each of the several figures are<br>
identified by the same reference characters.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
As shown in Fig. 1, the present invention relates to application of a polymeric<br>
foam film or layer to a glass window structure 10 in an existing building 12, the glass<br>
window structures including a glass pane 14 mounted by a frame 16. The building 12<br>
can be of any type, residential or commercial, and of any conventional construction.<br>
The glass window structure 12 can be of any conventional construction where one or<br>
more glass panes are held in place in a frame of one or. multiple parts surrounding the<br>
glass pane, such as sash windows, casement windows, sliding glass doors, slidably or<br>
pivotally movable windows, non-movable windows, protruding windows and recessed<br>
windows. The polymeric foam film or layer 18 is applied to the window structure to<br>
create a temporary shield for the glass pane. The polymeric foam layer can be applied<br>
in any suitable rranner dependent on the polymeric composition to adhere to the glass<br>
pane. In a preferred embodiment, the polymeric foam layer 18 is formed by a<br>
polyurethane with a propellant causing the polyurethane to form foam upon application<br>
by spraying onto the window structure when a storm is expected to form layer 18<br>
overlying the glass pane 14 and, in most cases, a portion of the frame 16 as shown in<br>
Figs. 2 and 3. Dependent upon the location of the window structure 10 in the building<br>
12. the polyurethane can be sprayed by a hand-held spraying device 20 or a remotely<br>
controlled spraying device mounted on a pole extendible to be positioned adjacent<br>
window structures to be protected.<br><br>
The polyurethane can be provided as a one-component or two-component<br>
system. The too-component system has a first chamber containing a polymeric polyol<br>
and a second chamber containing a diisocyanate with a mixing head to statically blend<br>
the polyol and diisocyanate components and to spray the polymeric blend or mix onto<br>
the window structure. The one-component system contains a polymeric/polyol,<br>
polyurethane prepolymer and a polymeric hydrocarbon propellant such that mixing<br>
takes place in the spraying device or container and moisture curing occurs on the<br>
surface of the window structure.<br>
Since polyurethanes are very adhesive by nature, a release agent can be added<br>
to the one-component or two-component systems to adjust the adhesive properties of<br>
the polyurethane foam layer to the glass pane and a portion of the frame. The<br>
adhesive properties of the poiyurethane foam layer could also be adjusted by altering<br>
the molecular structure of the polyurethane or the exterior surface of the glass pane<br>
could be coaled with the release agent that would reduce the adhesion of the<br>
polyurethane layer thereto in a manner such that an adhesive balance is achieved<br>
whereby the polyurethane tayer remains in place during a storm but is easy to remove<br>
by peeling or stripping. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 3, a film can to applied prior to<br>
application of the polymeric foam layer with the film carrying a reieasable or low-<br>
adherency, non-permanent, pressure sensitive adhesive to facilitate removal of the<br>
polymeric foam layer by the film acting as a release agent.<br>
Since polyurethane is very adiesive to glass, the polyurethane can be sprayed<br>
onto a polymeric film that was first applied to the glass, the film acting as a release<br>
agent. The film preferably has high tensile strength. For further strengthening, a high<br>
tensile film can be applied to the outside of the polymeric foam structure to act as a<br>
protective skin helping to prevent the piercing of the polymeric foam. The high tensile<br>
film can be of one or more layers, and the layers can be formed along the same or<br>
angular planes (such as 90 degrees) to each other.<br>
The polyurethanefoam layer probably has twice as great compression strength<br>
in a direction parallel to the foam rise, shown by arrow 22, as compared with the<br>
compression strength in a direction perpendicular to foam rise, shown by arrow 24, as<br>
illustrated in Fig. 3. The compressive strength and other physical strength properties<br>
of the polyurethane foam layer will vary with the type of foaming system utilized.<br><br>
Compressive strength values from 1.054605 to 2.81228 Kg-force/cm<br>
can be obtained from 2 lb/ft3 density urethane foams. A<br>
compressive strength 2.10921 Kg-force/cm2 can be obtained with<br>
foam densities from 16,018.463g/ m3 to 160. 184.63g/m3. Many foams<br><br>
will be in the range of 8.0092.315g/m3. With the variation in<br>
compressive strength values related to density, a generalized<br>
correlation of strenght uith density can be obtained.<br>
The polymeric foan layer 18 is applied to the outside<br>
surface of the window structure when a storm is expected and acts<br>
as a temporary protective shield against glass window damage and<br>
shattering caused by projectiles and high winds. With the<br>
polymeric foam layer adhered to the glass pane as shown in Figs 2<br>
and 3, the foam provides increased energy absorption from<br>
projectiles as compared with a non-foam polymeric layer due to<br>
the mechanical properties of the foam cell structure. The cells<br>
preferably have diameters in a range of from 0.005 mm to 5.0 mm<br>
and, most preferably, in a range of from 0.01mm to 0.03mm and<br>
create a spongy three-dimensional, elastomeric web pattern with<br>
entrapped gas to absorb energy. The polymeric layer 18 preferably<br>
has a thickness in a range of from 1.27 cm to 30.48 cms and, most<br>
preferably in a range of from 2.54 cm to 10.16 cm to form an<br>
elastomeric, spongy cushion preventing shattering breakage or<br>
fracture of the underlying glass.<br><br>
When the glass pane is recessed in the frame 16, as shown in<br>
Fig.3, the volume of the recess 26 is preferably filled with the<br>
polyurethane foam such that the polyurethane foam layer is<br>
coextensive with the exterior plane or surface of the building.<br>
If desired, the polyurethane foam layer 18 can be applied to<br>
overlap the frame 16 and can be formed from a single layer or<br>
coat of foam or a plurality of layers or coats of foam. When a<br>
plurality of foam layers are applied to form the temporarily<br>
protected window structure in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the layers are applied sequentially after at least<br>
partial curing of the underling layers. Each of the layers of<br>
coats can have a thickness of from 1.27 to 30.48 cms.<br>
The polymeric foam layer 18, formed of one or more layers or<br>
coats 18A are shown in dashed lines in Fig. 3, is applied to a<br>
window structure in a building in anticipation of storm<br>
conditions. The layer 18 can be sprayed onto the window<br>
structure with the use of a spraying device of a size to be held<br>
in the hand at a level with the window structure or operated from<br>
an extendible pole. Larger containers can •••••••••••.<br><br>
be supported on the ground or on a truck and used with a spray head movable to be<br>
placed adjacent the window structure.<br>
Once the storm passes, the polymeric foam layer 18 can be peeled from the<br>
window structure as shown in Fig. 4. If a plurality of layers or coats 18A are used, the<br>
layers can be peeled from the window structure individually or simultaneously. The<br>
foam layer 18 can be removed from the exterior of the building; or, if the window<br>
structure is movable (e.g. pivotal or on tracks), the foam layer can be removed from the<br>
interior of the building without the use of a ladder by opening the window structure<br>
slowly and pulking the foam layer into the building. If the windows are not movable (do<br>
not open), an extension arm or pole can be used to remove the foam layer. If all of the<br>
windows are completely flat, as in a glass building, and if a polymeric film such as<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene or a polyvinyl is used as a release agent, one could either<br>
use a stronger adhesive backing for the polymeric film or pull a section of the film into<br>
the building through a window or opening if possible to create a better physical bond<br>
between the building and the film. The intrinsic adhesive properties of the polyurethane<br>
foam will create a strong bond between it and the polymeric film.<br>
A two-component polyurethane foam system is shown schematicaliy in Fig. 5<br>
wherein a canister 28 contains diisocyanate and a canister 30 contains polymeric<br>
polyol, the canisters communicating with a static mixing head 32 under pressure from<br>
a propallant 34. The diisocyanate and the polymeric polyol are mixed under the<br>
propallant's pressure and sprayed, as shown at 36, onto a window structure. As soon<br>
as the polymeric blend is sprayed and hits the glass pane 14, foaming will start, and a<br>
desired polymeric foam thickness is achieved. As noted above, additional layers or<br>
coats cart be applied for extra protection. The polymeric foam layer will be dry to the<br>
touch within minutes after application and will be completely cured in a few hours. A<br>
catalyst can be added if curing time is desired to be decreased. A one-component<br>
polyurathane foam system is similar with the exception that a higher viscosity<br>
polyurethane prepolymer is used that is moisture cured by atmospheric humidity. A thin<br>
mesh made of either a polymer, a metal or a composite could be applied to the outside,<br>
or inside, of the-polymeric foam to create a higher tensile strength membrane that adds<br>
integrity to the foam structure. The polymeric foam can act as a vehicle to attach other<br>
reinforcing materials to the window structure.<br><br>
An example of a two-component spray polyurethane foam system<br>
is the FROTH-PAK system marketed by Flexible Products Company<br>
Constuction Group, of Joilet, Illinois.<br>
Other polymeric foams can be utilized in accordance with the<br>
present invention includirg modified styrene foams, particularly<br>
high impact styrene foams modified with polymers, such as<br>
polybutadiene, polystyrene foams, polypropylene, polystyrene and<br>
polyethylene blends and copolyrmerization materials such as Dow<br>
Chemical Index Interpolymers. The interior and/or exterior films<br>
or membranes can be made of the same materials, a various<br>
materials can be added to the polymeric foam structure to form a<br>
composite, such as graphite.<br><br>
