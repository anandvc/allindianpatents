				<td>Technical Field [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a medicine, and in<br>
particular, to a novel<br>
cyclohepta[b]pyridine-3-carbonylguanidine derivative having an inhibitory effect on an Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) , and a medicine containing the same. Background Art <br>
[0002]<br>
Ischemic myocardium undergoes virtually no histological changes when reperfused in the early phase of ischemia; however, when ischemia is sustained and reperfusion occurs during the course of necrosis, reperfusion injuries such as reperfusion-induced arrhythmia, no-reflow phenomenon and myocardial necrosis, which are mainly caused by Ca2+ overload, are observed. If these reperfusion injuries could be suppressed to be minimal, it would be expected that such prevention would lead to an improved mortality or improvedpost - infarction cardiac function.<br>
The NHE on the cell membrane is an ion transporter which controls the pH inside a cell by permitting a Na+ influx into the cell and pumping H+ out of the cell, and increased activity<br>
of the NHE is believed to cause the Ca2+ overload during ischemia reperfusion.  It is therefore conceived that an NHE inhibitor suppresses the Ca2+ overload, thereby suppressing the ventricular fibrillation caused by reperfusion-induced arrhythmia and suppressing expansion of myocardial necrosis.<br>
Furthermore, it is also suggested that NHE is involved in ischemia or ischemic reperfusion injury in various organs such as brain, liver and kidney in addition to the heart, as well as in hypertension, angina pectoris, cardiac hypertrophy, diabetes mellitus, diseases caused by prolif erability of cells, or diseases caused by vascular endothelial disorder. Therefore, an NHE inhibitor is expected to be effective in suppressing these diseases or disorders, and is considered to be useful as a therapeutic agent or prophylactic agent of these diseases or disorders.<br>
Amiloride, a K+ sparing diuretic represented by the formula shown below, is a pyrazine derivative having acylguanidine. This derivative has NHE inhibitory effect, and is also reported to exhibit antiarrhythmic effect (Non-Patent Document 1). However, the antiarrhythmic effect of amiloride is weak, and also, amiloride has antihypertensive effect and salt excreting effect, which are rather considered as side effects that are undesirable for the treatment of arrhythmia. [0003]<br>
[Chemical Formula 1](Formula Removed)<br>
[0004]<br>
As a derivative which is not associated with the salt<br>
excreting effect, but has NHE inhibitory effect and antiarrhythmic effect, a benzoylguanidine derivative<br>
(Non-Patent Document 2, Patent Documents 1 and 2), an<br>
indolylguanidine derivative (Patent Document 3), an aminoguanidinehydrazone derivative (Patent Document 4) , and a cycloalka[b]pyridine derivative (Patent Document 5) have been respectively reported.<br>
In recent years, it has been reported that when the NHE inhibitor passes through the blood brain barrier and arrives at the brain, it manifests characteristic neurotoxicity which commonly appears in specific areas (Non-Patent Document 3) . It is also reported that a NHEl gene-deficient mouse displays severe ataxia, andneuropathy that is specif ic to cerebellum, vestibular nucleus and cochlear nucleus (Non-Patent Document 4). Therefore, the neurotoxicity of conventional NHE inhibitors has potential to induce various neuropathies. Accordingly, development of an NHE inhibitor which does not affect neurons is desired.<br>
In Patent Document 6, introducing a -SO3H group (sulfo group) , a -PO3H2 group or the like to the NHE inhibitors via various crosslinking groups has been suggested as a method of reducing the effect of the NHE inhibitors on the nervous system, particularly on the central nervous system, and specifically, the case of an indolylguanidine derivative is disclosed. However, since no specific data is presented for the effect of<br>
such introduction, the effectiveness of the introduction has been not proved for all conventional NHE inhibitors.<br>
In fact, the inventors of the present invention have synthesized and investigated a variety of derivatives, and found that depending on the combination of the substituent and the NHE inhibitor as a nucleus, in some cases the NHE inhibitory effect has been significantly attenuated, or in some cases the derivative has been metabolized immediately after administration to be converted to the original NHE inhibitor, or in some cases, even the derivative itself has been exhibited an action on the central nervous system. Thus, such derivatives are not necessarily effective in reducing toxicity to the central nervous system.<br>

brain.<br>

The NHE inhibitory activity was measured according to the method by Scholz et al. [British Journal of Pharmacology, Vol. 109, p.562-568 (1993)], taking the swelling of rat platelets induced by sodium propionate as an index.<br>
Under etherization, blood was collected (8 mL) from the abdominal aorta of a Wistar rat, and 1 mL of a citrate dextrose solution as an anticoagulant was added. The blood sample was immediately centrifuged at 90xg for 10 minutes, and then the collected supernatant was taken as platelet-rich plasma. Subsequently, to 250 (J.L of a 140 mM sodium propionate buffer solution containing the test compound dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (pH 6.7, final dimethylsulfoxide concentration^) , theplatelet-richplasmapreparedintheabove (number of platelet; 10xl06/50 jIL) was added, and the decrease in the absorbance associated with the swelling of platelets was measured over time with a Hematracer (NKK Corp.).<br>
The rate of decrease in the absorbance at 20 seconds after the addition of the platelet-rich plasma was taken as the NHE activity, and the inhibitory activity of the respective compounds was expressed as a relative activity, while the action obtained upon addition of 300 (µM of Amiloride was taken as 100% inhibition.<br>
In addition, the test results were obtained by calculating the concentration at which the inhibitory activity of the test compound becomes 50% (IC50 value) , by a Probit method. The IC50 values for the NHE inhibitory activity of these test compounds are presented in Table 1. [0098]<br>
[Table 1]	(Table Removed)<br>
[0099]<br>
[Test Example 2] Reperfusion-induced arrhythmia inhibitory action test<br>
Subsequently, in evaluation of the in vivo NHE inhibitory action, the effect of the test compound on reperfusion-induced arrhythmia upon myocardial ischemia was evaluated according to the method of Aihara et al. [European Journal of Pharmacology, Vol. 404, p.221-229 (2000)]. Under anesthesia using pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, intraperitoneal administration), cannulae were inserted into trachea, femoral vein and carotid artery of male SD rats (weeks old) for artificial ventilation, drug administration and blood pressure measurement, respectively. The blood pressure was measured using a strain pressure amplifier via a pressure transducer, while the heart rate was measured from the blood pressure pulse wave using a cardiotachometer. Furthermore, an electrocardiogram (lead II) was measured from the electrodes attached to each four limbs. Next, under artificial ventilation, left thoracotomy was performed and a snare (5-0 nylon) was loosely placed around a<br>
blood vessel which was about 3 mm apart from the origin of the left coronary artery. Thereafter, it was confirmed that arrhythmia was not occurred for 10 minutes, and then the snare was fastened to induce local myocardial ischemia. Furthermore, after 4 minutes of myocardial ischemia, the compound was intravenously administered for 1 minute, and after 5 minutes of myocardial ischemia, the snare was loosened, then the arrhythmia occurred after reperf usion was recorded and analyzed with an arrhythmia analyzer (Softron Co., Ltd.), thereby the anti-arrhythmic action of the compound was evaluated. The test compounds were respectively dissolved in physiological saline at a concentration of 3.62 mmol/L, and 4 to 5 animals in each group were respectively administered at 1 mL/kg of the compound. The control group was administered with physiological saline.<br>
With regard to the ventricular fibrillation (Vf) which occurred within 10 minutes after reperf usion (in the cases of halfway death, up to the time point where cardiac arrest was confirmed) , arrhythmia analysis was performed according to the Guidelines for Lambeth Convention [Cardiovascular research, Vol. 22, p.447-455, 1988], and evaluation was made in terms of the frequency of Vf occurrence, cumulative duration time of Vf, and the mortality.<br>
The frequency of Vf occurrence, cumulative duration of Vf, and the mortality for the respective test compounds are presented in Table 2. [0100]<br>
[Table 2]<br>
(Table Removed)* The concentration was 1.09 mmol/L, and administration of 1 mL/kg was performed in 5 animals. [0101]<br>
The compound of the present invention exhibited a high NHE inhibitory action both in vitro and in vivo. Although the activity in vitro was slightly lower as compared with the control<br>
compound, the NHE inhibitory activity was still strong. Meanwhile, unlike the present invention, the Reference Compound 22 and 23, in which sulfoxy groups were introduced at the 5-position and 2-position of the cyclohepta[b]pyridine ring respectively, showed significant lowering in the activity. Moreover, for reperfusion-induced arrhythmia, the compound of the present invention greatly shortened the cumulative duration of Vf and lowered the mortality, thus effects of the inventive compound were comparable to or greater than those of the control compound. [0102] [Test Example 3] Metabolic stability test in rat<br>
The compound represented by Formula (1) of the present invention has a structure in which the hydroxyl group on the 9-position of a<br>
9-hydroxymethyl-cyclohepta[b]pyridine-3-carbonylguanidine derivative is converted to a specific substituent. However, if the compound is metabolized in vivo to remove the specific substituent from the compound, there may be generated the original<br>
9-hydroxymethyl-cyclohepta[b]pyridine-3-carbonylguanidine derivative, which has toxic effects on the central nervous system. Thus, the inventive compounds as synthesized in Examples were administered in vivo to study whether the control compound, which was the corresponding 9-hydroxymethyl product, was generated.<br>
Male SD rats (7 weeks old) were administered at 1 mg/kg (an amount calculated excluding salts) of the control compound,<br>
an equivalent amount of the Inventive Compound 2, 4, 6, 7 or 12, or Reference Compound 20, through the tail vein. After administration, about 0.2 mL of blood samples were collected after 5, 15, 30, 60 and 120 minutes, and the blood samples were centrifuged at 4°C at a speed of rotation of 15000 for 15 minutes, thus to separate the supernatant plasma. The concentration of the control compound in the plasma was measured by LC/MS/MS. The measurement results were shown as +++ when the detected plasma concentration of the control compound is 200 ng/mL or greater; ++ for more than 100 ng/mL and less than 200 ng/mL; + for more than 20 ng/mL and less than 100 ng/mL; and - for less than 20 ng/mL or no detection. The results are presented in Table 3. [0103]<br>
[Table 3] (Table Removed)For the Inventive Compounds 2, 4, 6, 7 and 12, the control compound was not detected at any time point, and it was found that the Inventive Compounds do not decompose into the Control Compound in vivo, which indicates a possibility of reduced toxic effects of the compounds of the present invention on the central nervous system was suggested. Meanwhile, the Reference Compound 20 which was a phosphoric acid derivative was rapidly degraded to the Control Compound after administration, and thus, it was conceived that the Reference Compound 20 showed the same toxic effects on the central nervous system as those of the Control Compound. [0105]<br>
[Test Example 4] Toxicity test with 2-days repeated intraperitoneal administration in mouse<br>
For three male mice in each group, 300 mg/kg of the Control Compound (anamount calculatedexcluding salts) , or an equivalent amount of the Inventive Compound 2, 4, 6, 7 or 12 were intraperitoneally administered once a day for 2 days, and a histopathological tests were performed. The Control Compound, and the Inventive Compounds 2, 4 and 6 were suspended in a 0.5% tragacanth gum solution, and the Inventive Compound 7 was suspended in a 10% DMSO-containing 0 . 5% tragacanth gum solution, while the Inventive Compound 12 was suspended in olive oil. For the histopathological test, in order to make a more thorough examination of central nervous toxicity, the brain was examined after whole body was subjected to perfusion fixation with a 4% formaldehyde in neutral phosphate buffer as a fixing solution<br>
using a liquid transporting pump under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia.<br>
In the pathological test, vacuolation was recognized in the cerebellar nuclei and vestibular nuclei in the group administered with the Control Compound, but for the groups administered with the Inventive Compounds 2, 4, 6, 7 and 12, any histologic finding which could be caused by drug administration was not recognized.<br>
From the results, it was confirmed that the toxicity of the Inventive Compounds 2, 4, 6, 7 and 12 on the central nervous system was obviously reduced as compared to the Control Compound. [0106]<br>
[Test Example 5] Toxicity test after 4 -days repeated intravenous administration in beagle dogs<br>
With one male and one female dogs in each group, 30 mg/kg of the Control Compound dissolved in physiological saline (an amount calculated excluding salts) , or an equivalent amount of the Inventive Compound 2, 4, 6 or 8 was repeatedly administered intravenously once a day for 4 days, and general symptom observation and pharmacological histopathologic examination were performed. For the histopathologic examination, in order to perform a more thorough examination of the central nervous toxicity, only the brain was examined after whole body was subjected to perfusion fixation with a 4% formaldehyde in neutral phosphate buffer as a fixing solution using a liquid transporting pump under pentobarbital sodium anesthesia.<br>
As a result, in a general condition, vomiting, salivation,<br>
and decreases in locomotor activity, staggering gait and ananastasia were recognized in the group administered with the Control Compound. On the other hand, in the groups administered with the Inventive Compounds 2,4, 6 and 8, only vomiting was recognized.  In the pathologic examination, necrosis/ chromatolysis of nerve cells, swelling of axons and vacuolation of myelin sheath were recognized in the cerebellar nuclei and vestibular nucleus of the group administered with the Control Compound.  In the groups administered with the Inventive Compounds 2,4,6 and 8, any histologic finding which could be caused by drug administration was not recognized in both male and female dogs.<br>
From the above results, it was confirmed that the toxicities of the Inventive Compounds 2,4,6 and 8 on the central nervous system were obviously reduced as compared to the Control Compound. [0107]<br>
[Test Example 6] Comparative test for transferability to the brain in rat<br>
To male SD rats (6 weeks old), the Control Compound or the Inventive Compound 2 was administered through the tail vein in an amount of 50 mg/kg. After administration, whole blood samples were collected over time from the abdominal aorta under etherization, and the brain tissues were extracted immediately. The brain tissues were lightly washed off to remove the blood attached around with physiological saline, and subsequently the tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and preserved at -30°C<br>
until analyzed. The blood was centrifuged at 4°C at a rotation speed of 15000 for 15 minutes to separate the supernatant plasma, and was preserved at -30°C until analyzed. The brain tissues were thawed by standing at ambient temperature, and then the wet weight was measured. Distilled water was added in an amount five times of the wet weight, and a suspension was prepared using a Polytron homogenizer. The measurement of the test compound concentration in the plasma and the brain tissues was performed by LC/MS/MS. The transferability of the drug to the brain was calculated by dividing the drug concentration in the brain tissues by the plasma concentration obtained at the same time. The test results are presented in Table 4. [0108]<br>
[Table 4] (Table Removed)<br>
* N.D. The intracerebral concentration was not detected.<br>
[0109]<br>
Compared with the Control Compound, the Inventive Compound 2 was confirmed to have decreased transferability to the brain tissues. From this, the decreased toxic effects on the central nervous system were proved.<br>
