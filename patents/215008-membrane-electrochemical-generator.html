				<td>MEMBRANE ELECTROCHEMICAL GENERATOR<br>
The present invention relates to a membrane electrochemical generator<br>
characterised by reduced weight, improved electrical insulation to the external<br>
environment and simplified assemblage. Processes of conversion of chemical to<br>
electric energy based on membrane electrochemical generators are known in the art.<br>
One example of prior art membrane electrochemical generator is outlined in figure 1.<br>
The electrochemical generator (1) is formed by a multiplicity of reaction cells (2)<br>
mutually connected in series and assembled according to a filter-press configuration.<br>
Each reaction cell (2) converts the free energy of reaction of a first gaseous reactant<br>
(fuel) with a second gaseous reactant (oxidant) without degrading it completely to<br>
thermal energy, thereby without being subject to the limitations of Camof s cycle. The<br>
fuel is supplied to the anode compartment of the reaction ceil (2) and consists for<br>
example of a mixture containing hydrogen or light alcohols, such as methanol or<br>
ethanol, while the oxidant is supplied to the corresponding cathode compartment and<br>
consists for instance of air or oxygen. The fuel is oxidised in the anode compartment<br>
simultaneously releasing H+ ions, while the oxidant is reduced in the cathode<br>
compartment, consuming H+ ions. An ion-exchange membrane separating the anode<br>
from the cathode compartment allows the continuous flow of H+ ions from the anode<br>
to the cathode compartment while hindering the passage of electrons. The difference<br>
in the electric potential established at the poles of the reaction cell (2) is thereby<br>
maximised.<br>
More in detail, each reaction cell (2) is delimited by a pair of electrically conductive<br>
flat -face bipolar sheets (3) enclosing, proceeding outwards, the ion-exchange<br>
membrane (4); a pair of porous electrodes (5); a pair of current collectors/distributors<br>
(7) realised by means of a reticulated conductive element of the type disclosed in US<br>
5,482,792, electrically connecting the bipolar sheets (3) to the porous electrodes (5)<br>
while simultaneously distributing the gaseous reactants; a pair of sealing gaskets (8)<br>
directed to seal the periphery of the reaction cell (2) to prevent the leakage of the<br>
gaseous reactants towards the external environment. In the bipolar sheets (3) and in<br>
the sealing gaskets (8) of each reaction cell (2), feed openings and discharge<br>
openings are present, not shown in figure 1, in communication with the cell anode<br>
and cathode chamber through distributing channels, also not shown in figure 1. The<br>
distributing channels are preferably obtained within the thickness of the sealing<br>
gaskets (8) and have a comb-like structure. They distribute and collect the gaseous<br>
reactants and the reaction products, the latter optionally mixed with the exhausts, in a<br>
uniform fashion within each reaction cell (2). The bipolar sheets (3) and the sealing<br>
gaskets (8) are also provided with openings for feeding and discharging a cooling<br>
fluid (typically deionised water) with the purpose of maintaining the electrochemical<br>
generator (1) at the required operating temperature. In a filter-press configuration, the<br>
coupling between the aforementioned openings determines the formation of two<br>
longitudinal manifolds directed to feed the gaseous reactants, two longitudinal<br>
manifolds directed to discharge the reaction products optionally mixed with exhausts<br>
and finally of coolant feed and discharge manifolds. Externally to the cell reaction (2)<br>
assembly, two terminal plates (11) are present, delimiting the electrochemical<br>
generator (1) and allowing, in co-operation with other devices such as springs or tie-<br>
rods, to keep the various components under compression ensuring thereby the gas<br>
sealing to the external environment and the longitudinal electric continuity. One of the<br>
two terminal plates (11) is provided with nozzles, not shown in figure 1, for<br>
connecting the aforementioned longitudinal manifolds to the external circuits.<br>
Moreover, both of the terminal plates (11) are provided with suitable holes (also not<br>
shown in figure 1) for housing the tie-rods by means of which the electrochemical<br>
generator (1) is tightened. As shown in figure 2, the electrochemical generator (1) of<br>
the prior art may also comprise a multiplicity of cooling cells (20) interposed between<br>
the reaction cells (2). The cooling cells (20) are similar to the reaction cells (2) except<br>
they do not enclose the electrochemical package composed by the ion-exchange<br>
membrane (4), the porous electrodes (5) and the catalytic layers (6). The cooling<br>
cells (20), deputed to coolant flowing, contain a conductive element equivalent to the<br>
above disclosed collectors (7) and directed in this case to establish the electric<br>
continuity between two adjacent bipolar sheets while increasing the thermal<br>
exchange coefficient.<br>
The electrochemical generator (1) of the prior art, although advantageous under<br>
several aspects, nevertheless is affected by a few drawbacks. Firstly, in order to<br>
decrease the costs and avoid problems of fragility, the electrochemical generator (1)<br>
is preferably assembled with metal bipolar sheets, for instance made of stainless<br>
steel, rather than of graphite or the known polymer-graphite composites. This leads<br>
however to a remarkable weight and complexity, since the generator comprises a<br>
high number of components. The use of a high number of components also entails a<br>
significant amount of seals, and thus a higher risk of leakages besides a difficult<br>
assemblage, be it manual or automated, with high execution times and subject to<br>
inexactness which may have consequences on its correct functioning. Other<br>
disadvantages associated to the structure of the above described electrochemical<br>
generator are given by the lack of electrical insulation to the external environment, by<br>
the contact of metal with fluids, particularly referred to the coolant, taking place within<br>
the longitudinal manifolds and giving rise to possible shunt currents, and finally by the<br>
dispersion of the thermal power produced by the generator to the external<br>
environment.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a membrane electrochemical<br>
generator comprising metal bipolar sheets, overcoming the drawbacks of the prior<br>
art.<br>
For a better understanding of the present invention, some embodiments thereof are<br>

and<br>
- figure 13 shows a view along section G-G of the component of figure 12.<br>
Figure 3 shows an embodiment of electrochemical generator (100) in accordance<br>
with the invention formed by a multiplicity of reaction cells (101) mutually connected<br>
in series and assembled in a filter-press configuration, with cooling ceils (120)<br>
intercalated thereto, equivalent to the above discussed cooling cells (20) of figure 2,<br>
in a 1:1 ratio to the reaction cells. In other embodiments such ratio may be different,<br>
such as 1:2 or 1:3. Each reaction cell (101) is delimited by a pair of flat-face bipolar<br>
sheets (102), among which are comprised, proceeding outwards, an ion-exchange<br>
membrane (103); a pair of porous electrodes (104); a pair of catalytic layers (105)<br>
deposited at the interface between the membrane (103) and each of the porous<br>
electrodes (104); a pair of current collectors/distributors (106), realised by means of a<br>
reticulated metallic element of the type disclosed in US 5,482,792, electrically<br>
connecting the bipolar sheets (102) to the porous electrodes (104) while<br>
simultaneously distributing the gaseous reactants.<br>
As shown more in detail in figures 4, 5a, 5b, the bipolar sheets (102) are formed by a<br>
central metallic body (110), with dimensions slightly exceeding those of the active<br>
area of the reaction cells (101), integrated in a frame (111) made of polymeric<br>
material (for instance of thermoplastic or thermosetting type). The frame (111) is laid<br>
on the central metallic body (110) by moulding or gluing, optionally of separate<br>
pieces. The frame (111) advantageously takes care of all the functions of the sealing<br>
gasket (8) of the electrochemical generator of the prior art, which may therefore be<br>
omitted.<br>
As shown in figure 4, the frame (111) presents first and second openings (111a1,<br>
111a2) for the passage of the gaseous reactants, respectively fuel and oxidant, first<br>
and second openings (111b1, 111 b2) for the discharge of the reaction products<br>
optionally mixed with exhausts, openings (112) for feeding and discharging a cooling<br>
fluid. The frame (11) is also provided with a multiplicity of holes (150) for housing tie-<br>
rods by means of which the electrochemical generator (100) is tightened.<br>
Furthermore, the frame (111) presents distributing channels (113a, 113b) (figure 5a)<br>
and cooling channels (114) (figure 5b), all obtained within the thickness of the frame<br>
itself. The distributing channels (113a) and (113b) are positioned at the interface with<br>
the central metallic body (110) and put the first and second openings (111a1, 111a2)<br>
(only one of which is shown in figure 5a) and, respectively, the first and second<br>
openings (111b1, 111b2) (only one of which is shown in figure 5a) in direct<br>
communication with the interior of the reaction cell (101) while the cooling channels<br>
(114) put the openings (112) in communication with the interior of the cooling cell<br>
(120). In a filter-press configuration, the coupling between openings (111a1, 111a2)<br>
and openings (111b1, 111 b2) of all the frames (111) determines respectively the<br>
formation of two longitudinal manifolds (115) and two longitudinal manifolds (116),<br>
white the coupling between the openings (112) of all the frames (111) also<br>
determines the formation of relevant manifold, although they are not shown in figure<br>
3 for the sake of simplicity. The two longitudinal manifolds (115), only one of which is<br>
shown in figure 3, are directed to feeding the gaseous reactants, the two longitudinal<br>
manifolds (116), only one of which is shown in figure 3, are directed to withdrawing<br>
the reaction products (water) optionally mixed with exhausts (gaseous inerts and<br>
unconverted fraction of reactants), the manifolds formed by the coupling of openings<br>
(112) are directed to feeding and extracting the cooling fluid.<br>
Externally to the assembly of reaction cells (101), two terminal plates (117) are<br>
present (figure 3), delimiting the electrochemical generator (100). One of the two<br>
terminal plates (117) is provided with nozzles, not shown in figure 3, for the hydraulic<br>
connection of the various longitudinal manifolds to the external circuits. Moreover,<br>
both of the terminal plates (117) are provided with appropriate holes (also not shown<br>
in figure 3) for housing the tie-rods.<br>
In case the cooling cells (120) are interposed in a 1:1 ratio to the reaction cells (101),<br>
as shown in the embodiment of figure 3, the central metallic body (110) of the bipolar<br>
sheets (192) may be provided with a multiplicity of calibrated holes (130a, 130b) with<br>
diameter comprised between 0.1 and 5 mm, as shown in figure 6. Through the<br>
multiplicity of calibrated holes (130a) and (130b), respectively, the gaseous reactants<br>
flow into the reaction cell (101) and the reaction products and exhausts are<br>
withdrawn from the same, as will be illustrated more in detail hereafter, tn a<br>
construction alternative, the calibrated holes (130a) and (130b) have regularly varied<br>
diameters with the purpose of ensuring an equal distribution of gaseous reactants<br>
and withdrawal of products. The holes (130a) and (130b) are respectively positioned<br>
below and above the inner edges of frame (111) on the side opposite to that<br>
containing the distributing channels (131) and (132). The distance of the holes from<br>
the edges of frame (111) is preferably about 1 mm for a better exploitation of the<br>
reaction cell (101) active area.<br>
Making now reference to figure 7, representing a side-view of the bipolar sheet of<br>
figure 6 along section C-C, the frame (111) presents, on the side opposite to cooling j<br>
cell (120), a distributing zone of gaseous reactants (131) in communication with first<br>
and second openings (111a1, 111a2), and a collection zone of the reaction products<br>
and exhausts (132) in communication with first and second openings (111b1, 111b2).<br>
The distributing zone of gaseous reactants (131) and the collection zone of the<br>
reaction products and exhausts (132) are both obtained within the thickness of the<br>
frame (111). On the side opposite to the reaction cell (101), the frame (111) is free of<br>
channels and its thickness on this side may be optimised as a function of the<br>
thickness of the membrane-electrode-collector assembly without further constraints.<br>
The distributing (131) and collection (132) zones are shown in figure 8, representing<br>
a front-view of the section of bipolar sheet (102) of figure 7 along the D-D plane.<br>
Channels (133) and (134) coincide with the alignment of holes (130a) and (130b).<br>
In this case, the electrochemical generator (100) operates as follows: the gaseous<br>
reactants (fuel and oxidant), which are supplied to the electrochemical generator<br>
(100) through the longitudinal manifolds (115), flow to the distributing zone (131).<br>
from here, the gaseous reactants flow across the channel (133) and through the<br>
multiplicity of calibrated holes (130a), and are injected into the reaction cell (101).<br>
The reaction products and exhausts produced therein pass in their turn through the<br>
multiplicity of calibrated holes (130b) and across the channel (134) reaching the<br>
collection zones (132) and the manifolds (116) through which they exit the<br>
electrochemical generator (100).<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the holes (130a) are used for injecting water directly<br>
into the reaction cell instead than for the injection of the gaseous reactants as seen<br>
above. In this case, the injected water plays a double role, namely providing for the<br>
humidification of the gases and the membrane (103) and for the withdrawal of the<br>
heat of reaction upon partially evaporating. The unevaporated water is extracted from<br>
the reaction cell together with the products and exhausts through the collection zone<br>
in communication with a longitudinal discharge manifold. The holes (130b) can<br>
therefore be eliminated. By virtue of the cooling effect produced by the water directly<br>
injected into the reaction cell, the supply of coolant, for instance water, to the cooling<br>
cells (120) is no more required. The cells (120), although maintaining the structure of<br>
figure 3 comprising the element (106), retain the sole function of establishing the<br>
electric contact between the metallic bodies (110) of two adjacent bipolar sheets<br>
(102). Taking figure 6 as reference, the section along the line C-C is represented, as<br>
regards this specific case, in figure 9, wherein the common parts with the previous<br>
figures are indicated with the same reference numbers. For the sake of better<br>
understanding, the section of the bipolar sheet of figure 9 along the line E-E is<br>
represented in figure 10, wherein the development of the channel (135) coinciding<br>
with holes (130a) and permitting the injection of water coming from (112) through the<br>
same is evidenced. The supply of reactant gases and the withdrawal of products and<br>
exhausts takes place, as indicated in figure 5a, through the channels (113a) and<br>
(113b). In this case, the thickness of the gasket (111) on the reaction cell side,<br>
similarly to the case of the embodiment of figure 5a, is limited by the necessity of<br>
housing the channels (113a) and (113b) and cannot be freely optimised as allowed<br>
by the embodiment of figure 7. It is possible to enjoy such advantage again,<br>
simultaneously making use of the effective direct water injection, by means of a<br>
further embodiment of the invention, characterised by resorting to a frame design<br>
encompassing the two concepts of gas distribution and water injection outlined in<br>
figures 7 and 9. Such embodiment is represented in figure 11 as a front-view of<br>
bipolar sheet (102) wherein the common parts with the previous figures are indicated<br>
with the same reference numbers. As it can be seen, the central metallic body (110)<br>
is provided with a double row of holes, respectively 130a for feeding the gaseous<br>
reactants and (136) for injecting water, and with a single row of holes 130b directed<br>
to the withdrawal of reaction products, exhausts and residual water. For the sake of a<br>
better understanding, the section of the frame (111) along the line F-F is represented<br>
in figure 12 showing the section of the distributing channel (135) of the water to be<br>
injected into the reaction cell (101) through the holes (136). A front-view of a further<br>
section of the bipolar sheet along the line G-G of figure 12 is shown in figure 13.<br>
The advantages obtained with the above disclosed invention are the following:<br>
a) reduction in weight of the electrochemical generator according to the<br>
invention: the electrochemical generator made in accordance with the present<br>
invention provides the use of bipolar sheets with a metallic portion having<br>
dimensions slightly superior to those of the reaction cell active area, while the<br>
metallic bipolar sheets of the prior art have dimensions substantially coinciding<br>
with the whole front area of the generator; the esteemed weight reduction due<br>
to this modification is about 30%.<br>
b) reduction in the number of components making up the electrochemical<br>
generator according to the invention: the reduction in the number of<br>
components entails a remarkable advantage in terms of reduction of the time<br>
for the assemblage and of the relevant costs, besides decreasing the<br>
occurrence of errors. For instance, the assemblage of a generator according<br>
to the prior art of figure 2 comprising n reaction cells requires 3 x n gaskets<br>
and 2 x n bipolar plates for a total of 5 x n components (without considering<br>
the components relative to the electrochemical package, which remain<br>
unvaried); making use of the electrochemical generator (100) of the invention<br>
according to the embodiment of figure 3, only 2 x n components are required.<br>
c) reduction in the number of seals: ensuring a leak-free sealing in the<br>
assemblage of a multiplicity of parts made of diverse materials is one of the<br>
main problems to be faced during the construction of generators, and such<br>
problems is not always of straightforward resolution. The assemblage of the<br>
prior art generator of figure 2 with n reaction cells entails 5 x n sealed<br>
surfaces, reduced to 2 x n when bipolar sheets in accordance with the<br>
invention are employed.<br>
d) better alignment and centring of the components: the bipolar sheets in<br>
accordance with the invention allow to improve the component alignment<br>
during the assemblage of the generator since, as mentioned above, the<br>
amount of components is much reduced and the polymer frames are<br>
automatically in the right position, contrarily to what happens with the prior art<br>
technology, wherein the components to assemble are many and the<br>
positioning of the gaskets, which are not secured to the bipolar sheets, is<br>
undoubtedly difficult. Also the centring of the other elements of the<br>
electrochemical generator (current collector/distributor, electrodes and<br>
membrane) is made simpler by the presence of a predisposed seat delimited<br>
by the frame (111).<br>
e) improved external electrical insulation: the bipolar sheets according to the<br>
invention allow to electrically insulating the generator from the external<br>
environment while reducing the dispersion of thermal power.<br>
f) absence of fluid to metal contacts in the feed and discharge manifolds:<br>
another relevant issue when metallic components are used within<br>
electrochemical generators is trying to reduce at most the contact of metals<br>
with fluids (humidified gaseous reactants, coolant) so as to reduce the risks of<br>
corrosion and to suppress the shunt currents. The use of the bipolar sheets<br>
according to the invention allows eliminating the metallic parts both from the<br>
feed and discharge manifolds of the humidified gaseous reactants and from<br>
the feed and discharge manifolds of the coolant since all these ducts are<br>
obtained within the polymer frame.<br>
The production of the bipolar sheets of the invention consisting of a central<br>
metallic body optionally provided with holes for distribution and collection and<br>
integrated with a frame of plastic material incorporating the different openings and<br>
channels may be achieved with one of the methods listed hereafter<br>
- application of leachable elements shaped as the sections of the various<br>
channels to the metallic body, moulding of the plastic material in order to form<br>
the integral frame and leaching with a suitable reactant after optional cooling<br>
in the case of thermoplastic materials or after completion of polymerisation in<br>
the case of thermosetting materials. An adequate teachable material is<br>
aluminium, which is easily dissolved with caustic soda. The plastic material of<br>
the frame must have mechanical characteristics, in particular minimum long-<br>
term deformability at the operative temperature and under the typical operative<br>
compression conditions, suitable for maintaining the passage section of the<br>
various channels substantially unvaried.<br>
- application of preformed element having the shape of the required channels<br>
on the metallic body followed by moulding of the plastic material so as to form<br>
the integral frame, the preformed materials may be made of metal, preferably<br>
stainless steel, or plastics: if the mechanical resilience to compression of the<br>
preformed elements is high, the above constraints of low deformability for the<br>
frame material are overcome.<br>
- pre-forming of the frames, e.g. by moulding, optionally in two sections, each<br>
consisting of a face of said frame and comprising its own channels, and<br>
assemblage with the metallic body by thermal bonding or preferably by gluing<br>
with suitable adhesive, in order to prevent any damage to the section of<br>
passage of the channels. The selection of the frame material is in this case<br>
subjected, besides the constraints of minimum deformability, also to those of<br>
compatibility with the commercial adhesives, among which the thin film<br>
adhesives are preferred.<br>
To improve the adhesion between metallic body and frame material, with an<br>
adhesive optionally interposed, the metallic body is preferably subjected to pre-<br>
treatments such as fine sandblasting and/or chemical attacks, with the aim of<br>
producing a micro-rough and chemically reactive surface. A further measure,<br>
equally directed to impart adhesion between metallic body and frame, may<br>
consist of providing the metallic body with openings in the peripheral zone,<br>
wherein the frame material may penetrate during the moulding step, thereby<br>
establishing a continuity between the two faces of the frame itself.<br>
The above description shall not be understood as limiting the invention, which<br>
may be practised according to different embodiments without departing from the<br>
scopes thereof, and whose extent is solely defined by the appended claims.<br>
In the description and claims of the present application, the word "comprise" and<br>
its variation such as "comprising" and "comprises" are not intended to exclude the<br>
presence of other elements or additional components.<br>
