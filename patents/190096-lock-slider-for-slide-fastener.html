1.	Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to a lock slider for a slide fastener, and more particularly to a lock slider that a slider body and a pull tab having a locking claw are simultaneously molded in an assembled form by a mold.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 2,495,539 (FIGS. U and 15) discloses a lock slide fastener slider in which a slider body 1' and a pull tab 20' having a locking claw 22' are simultaneously molded in an assembled form by a mold.<br>
In the lock slider disclosed in the above-mentioned U.S. Patent, the upper wing 2' of a slider body 1' has an aperture 7' extending from one side of the upper wing 2' to a pull-tab attaching lug 3' projecting centrally from the upper surface of the upper wing 2', and a pull tab 20' has a locking claw 22' projecting from one, surface at a position toward one side for insertion through the aperture 7'. The pull-tab attaching lug 3' has on opposite sides there¬of a pair of projections 21', 21' on which attachment<br><br>
holes 6', 6' for the pull tab 20' are to be threaded.<br>
Regarding the known lock slider mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, for forming the locking-claw-insertion aperture 7' in the upper wing 2' of the slider body 1', a side core having a thickness equal to the thickness of the upper wing 2' is inserted during the molding. Accordingly, the upper wing 2' has no coupling-element protecting region, which guides and holds corners of the coupling elements, at a position toward the flange side of the aperture 7', and front and back end walls of the aperture 7' rise steeply, which would be a cause for damage to upper surfaces of coupling elements, especially braids or sewing threads when the slider slides along the coupling element rows.<br>
Further, since the aperture 7' has a width greater than that of the locking claw 22' according to the shape of the upper wing 2' so that the coupling element rows cannot be guided smoothly. And since the pull tab 20' is inserted through the pull-tab attaching lug 3' project¬ing centrally from the upper wing 2', stable attachment of the pull tab 20' is difficult to achieve.  In addition, since the upper wing 2' at one side of the aperture 7' is completely cut away but is bridged by the flange 4' solely, adequate toughness of the slider cannot be guaranteed.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION With the foregoing problems in view, it is an object of this invention to provide a lock slider, for slide fasteners, which has an improved-toughness slider body guiding coupling element rows smoothly,<br>
protecting the coupling elements reliably and in which a locking-claw-insertion aperture on an upper wing of the slider body has a width equal to that of the locking claw. More particularly, the invention relates to a lock slide fastner slider which has a contour easy to manufacture and in which a pull tab and a slider body is formed by molding and the pull tab is assembled with the slider body simultaneously with the molding.<br>
The above object is accomplished by a lock slider for a slide fastener, comprising: a molded slider body composed of upper and lower wings, the upper wing having along its opposite side edges a pair of flanges extending downwardly, the upper wing having a locking-claw-insertion aperture at a position on its top surface toward one of the flanges and a slit communicating with the aperture and extending through the flange, the upper wing further having a pair of pintle-supporting brackets projecting upwardly from the flanges, the pintle-supporting brackets having<br><br>
a pair of axially aligned through holes; and a molded pull tab assembled with the slider body simultaneously with the molding of the slider body, the pull tab having a locking claw projecting from one of opposite tab sur¬faces to be inserted through the aperture and a pivotal pintle pivotally inserted in the through holes.<br>
Preferably, the upper wing has between the flanges and the aperture a plate-like retainer for guiding coupl¬ing elements of the slide fastener.  Further, the upper wing has preferably another locking-claw-insertion aper¬ture at a position toward the other flange, and also the pull tab has another locking claw to be inserted through the last-named aperture.<br>
Still further, the pivotal pintle of the pull tab is formed integrally with the pull tab by molding, and the pull tab has a protuberance bulging centrally from the one tab surface for supporting the pull tab.<br>
The thus constructed lock slide fastener slider is adapted to be mounted on a fastener chain which is symmetrical with respect to the plane of fastener tapes. Alternatively, the lock slider may be used on a fastener chain of the type in which coupling elements formed from a zigzag-shape monofilament is attached to inner edges of opposed fastener tapes by braids and<br><br>
sewing threads, a fastener chain having only a single coupling element   row. or various other types of fastener chains.<br>
In the sliding action of the slider, the braids and the sewing threads extending across and over the coupling elements are not influenced by the aperture of the upper wing, so that the coupling elements are protected and guided by the plate-like retainer and the flange toward the aperture, thus realizing smooth sliding of the slider.<br>
When the slider is to be stopped and locked in a desired position of the fostener chain, the pull tab is brouglit to tall flat forcing the locking claw into a gap between adjacent coupling elements to lock the slider in that position. When the slider is to be unlocked for sliding movement, the pull tab is pulled to stand upright to release the locking claw from the gap between adjacent coupling elements, allowing the slider to slide trebly.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a lock slider for a slide fastener, comprising a molded slider body composed of upper and lower wings said upper wing having along its opposite side edges a pair of flanges extending downwardly, said upper wing having a locking-claw-insertion aperture at a position thereof toward one of said flanges and a slit communicating with said aperture and extending through said one flange, said upper wing flirtier having a pair of pintle-supporting brackets projecting upwardly from said flanges, said pintle-supporting brackets having a pair of axially aligned through holes and a molded pull tab assembled with said slider body simultaneously within the molding of said slider body, said pull tab having a locking claw projecting from one of opposite pull tab surfaces and to be inserted through said aperture and a pair of pivotal pintles pivotally inserted in said thoroughly holes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of a lock slide fastener slider of this invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In the lock slide fastener slider of a first embodiment of this invention, as shown in FIGS. 1 through h,  a slider body 1 has a pair of pintle-supporting brackets 3 standing upwardly from opposite side edges of an upper wing 2 and having outer surfaces vertically aligned with those of flanges 4 projecting downwardly from the opposite side edges of the upper wing 2, defining between the opposite pintle-supporting brackets 3 a longitudinal recess 5. The pintle-supporting brackets 3 have a pair of axially aligned through holes 6. A pair of longitudinal locking-claw-insertion apertures 7 are formed in the recess 5 of the upper wing 2 one on each of opposite sides, extending from a position adjacent to the respective through being holes 6 amid terminating short of a rear end 13 of the slider body 1. Also the upper wing 2 has a pair of slits 8 each communicating with the respective aperture 7 and extend¬ing through the respective flange A, each slit 8 being<br><br>
defined partly by hollowing out part of the upper sur¬face of the upper wing 2. A pair of plate-like retainers 9 are attached to the upper wing 2 so as not to cover the locking-claw-insertion apertures 7. Thus, Each of the retainers 9 partly with each of the flanges A assumes a  shape.<br>
The slider body 1 is composed of upper and lower wings 2, 10 integrally joined together by a central guide post 11, and the lower wing 10 has a pair of flanges 12 projecting upwardly from opposite side edges of the lower wing 10 and confronting with the respective flanges A of the upper wing 2. The upper and lower wings 2, 10 have a pair of central ridges 14, 15, each extending centrally on their respective inner surfaces, i.e. lower and upper surfaces respectively, from the central guide post 11 toward the rear end 13 of the slider body 1, for coasting with flanges 4, 12 to guide the braids 17 and the sewing threads 18 cover¬ing the coupling elements 16. Reference numerals 19 designate fastener tapes.<br>
The pull tab 20 has on opposite sides of its base a pair of pivotal pintles 21 to be pivotally received in the respective through holes 6 of the pintle-supporting brackets 3. The pull tab 20 has on its base a pair of locking claws 22 to be inserted<br><br>
through the respective locking-claw-insertion apertures 7 projecting into the space between adjacent coupling elements 16. The two locking claws 22 are displaced in the longitudinal direction of the slider body 1 by a half of the pitch of coupling elements 16. Also the pull tab 20 has a pull-tab-supporting protuberance 23 bulging centrally from its locking-claw-side surface so that a constant gap is defined between the pull tab 20 and the slider body 1 to thereby prevent the pull tab 20 from coming into close contact with the slider body 1. The gap between the pull tab 20 and the slider body 1 serves also to facilitate inserting the cores of a mold in the process of molding the slider.<br>
For manufacturing the slider of the above-described contour, the cores for molding the slider body 1 and the pull tab 20 are shifted horizontally in the longitudinal direction of the slider body 1 and vertically toward one another as shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Meanwhile the cores for molding the through holes 6 of the slider body 1 and the pivotal pintles 21 of the pull tab 20 are shifted horizontally toward each other in the transverse direction of the slider body 1. At the same time, a pair of side cores 32 contactable with the upper surface of a core 31 to be inserted into the slider body 1 from the rear<br><br>
end 13 are Inserted into the upper wing 2 and the brackets 3 of the slider body 1. The core 31 has on its upper surface a pair of projections 33 for forming the respective locking-claw-insertion apertures 7. As the projections 33 and the side cores 32 come into contact with one another, the locking-clav-insertion apertures 7 and the slits 8 are formed so as to communicate with one another. Thus, a molding die is assembled using various kinds of cores, and a slider is molded by pouring molding material into the molding die, at which time the slider body 1 and the pull tab 20 are molded in an assembled form in a single molding step.<br>
FIGS. 7 through 10 shows a lock slide fastener slider according to a second embodiment of this invention. In the second embodiment, the recess 5 of the upper wing 2 has only one locking-claw-insertion aperture 7 at a position toward one flange 4 and only one slit 8 communicating with the aperture 7 and extending from part of the upper wing 2 to part of the flange h.   The pull tab 20 has only one locking claw 22 at a position corresponding to the locking-claw-insertion aperture 7. Accordingly the second embodiment is substantially identical in construction with the first embodiment except that the slider has<br><br>
a single-lock structure.<br>
FIG. 11 shows a lock slider according to a third embodiment which differs from the first embodiment in that the two locking claws 22 of the pull tab 20 are transversely aligned with each other and have different lengths and that the longer locking claw 22 has a taper end while the shorter locking claw 22 has a flat end. When the slider is to be locked at a position on the opposed coupling element rows, the longer lock¬ing claw 22 is forced into the space between adjacent coupling elements 16 of one row and the shorter lock¬ing claw 22 is pressed against the upper surfaces of the coupling elements 16 of the other row. The third embodiment is substantially identical in construction with the first embodiment except that the pull tab is devoid of no pull-tab-supporting protuberance 23.<br>
The lock slide fastener slider of this invention can be applied to a slider of the type which guides a pair of coupling element rows mounted on one surface of each fastener tape, e.g. a slider for a slide fas¬tener in which each coupling element row is in the form of a coiled continuous monofilament sewn to one surface of the respective fastener tape, namely, a slider in which the upper and lower wings are asymme¬trical and in which the lower wing is flat having no<br><br>
flanges for guiding the coupling elements. This slider can be applied to any type of slider, as long as the upper surface of the slider body has a locking-claw-insertion aperture and the pull tab has a locking claw.<br>
According to the lock slider of this invention, as mentioned above, following results can be obtained:<br>
Partly since the upper wing 2 of the slider body 1 has a longitudinally extending locking-claw-insertion aperture 7 at a position toward one flange 4, and partly since the upper wing 2 has a horizontal slit 8 communicating with the locking-claw-insertion aperture 7 and extending from part of the upper wing 2 to the upper edge of flange 4, it is possible to form the locking-claw-insertion aperture 7 so as to have a uniform width along its entire length so that the lock¬ing claw 22 can act stably. Further, since the outer surface of the flange k  and the outer surface of the pintle-supporting bracket 3 are continuous and verti¬cally aligned with each other, it is possible to realize a slider neat in appearance.<br>
In production, since the slider body 1 and the pull tab 20 are molded in an assembled form in which the pivotal pintles 21 are inserted through the axially aligned through holes 6 of the pintle-support-<br><br>
Ingo brackets 3 with the locking claw 22 projecting from the base of the pull tab 20 ate position corres¬ponding to the locking-claw-insertion aperture 7, it is possible to attach the pull tab 20 to the slider body 1 stably and, as a result, it is possible to assemble a slider, in which the pull tab 20 can be operated stably and excellently, simultaneously with the molding.<br>
Further, since the plate-like retainer 9 for guiding the coupling elements 16 is attached to the position between the flange A of the upper wing 2 and the locking-claw-insertion aperture 7, it is possible to guide the coupling elements 16 smoothly and to increase the toughness of the flange portions of the slider body 1.<br>
In an alternative form, partly since the upper wing 2 has a pair of longitudinally extending locking-claw-insertion apertures 7 at positions toward the opposite flanges and partly since the pull tab 20 has a pair of locking claws 22 on opposite sides on its base surface, it is possible to obtain a well-balanced stable locking function.<br>
Since the pivotal pintles 21 projecting from opposite sides of its base of the pull tab 20 are molded, it is possible to pivotally attach  to the<br><br>
slider body 1 firmly so that the pull tab 20 can be brought to fall flat and to stand upright smoothly.<br>
Further, since the pull tab 20 has a pull-tab-supporting protuberance 23 centrally on its base at the same surface as the locking claw 22, it is possible to prevent the pull tab 20 from coming into close contact with the slider body 1 so that the pull tab 20 can be operated with ease. The slider can be manufac¬tured by a simple molding method.<br><br><br>
