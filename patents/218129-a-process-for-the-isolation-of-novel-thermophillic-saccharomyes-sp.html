				<td>This invention relates to a process for the isolation of a novel thermophillic Saccharomyces sp. More particularly it relates to the isolation of the species from rotten grapes.<br>
The organism was deposited in June, 1996 at National collection of yeast culture(NCYC) and identified as Kluyveromyces marxianus NCYC 2675.<br>
Invertase catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose to an equimolar solution of fructose and glucose. Two types of invertases have been reported; the extracellular invertase which is membrane bound and is a glycoprotein, and an intracellular invertase which is said to be a nonglycosylated form of the extracellular invertase. Both these exhibit same properties. The hydrolysis of sucrose by invertase results in invert sugar; invert sugar is hygroscopic, noncrystallizable in nature and is sweeter than sucrose due to fructose which is one of its products. This property of invert sugar makes it ideal fro preparation of soft centered chocolates and fondants. Invertase is also used for the preparation of artificial honey, as a plasticizing agent, in cosmetics and paper industry and as enzyme electrodes for detection of sucrose. Invertase is also useful in production of jams and jellies since invertase action induces noncrystallization of sugars present in the jams. The enzymatic method of pretreatment of sugars in jams and jellies with invertase is milder whereas with the chemical treatment of sucrose there is likelihood of other undesirable products like furfural being formed.<br><br>
The Saccharomyces sp. has been reportedly isolated by the inventors of this inventions for the first time and hence there is no prior art available for the isolation of the yeast sp.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provides a process for the isolation of the yeast designated as Saccharomyces sp.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the isolation of a novel thermophillic Saceharomyces which comprises surface sterilising by conventional methods the rotting grapes, crushing the surface sterilized grapes and inoculating the pulp into medium (i) consisting of ingredients such as Jaggery -20-50, grins/litre (gpl), Yeast extract-l-3 gpl, malt extract- 1-3 gpl, and Peptone-2-5 gpl, incubating the inoculated medium at 40-450C for 18 to 48 hrs, plating this culture onto medium(2) having composition consisting Molasses-20-50 gins/litre (gpl), Yeast extract-l-3 gpl, Malt extract- 1-3 gpl, and Peptone- 2-5 gpl, isolating the colonies thus obtained and innoculating these colonies into a medium (2) at 40 to 450C for 24 to 48 hrs. with constant shaking or stirring, harvesting and centriftiging the innoculum, to obtain the colonies of the Saceharomyces sp.<br>
The process of the present invention is described herein below examples which are illustrative only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner whatsoever.<br><br><br>
Example 1.<br><br>
The rotten grapes 20 gins. obtained from local vendors were surface sterilized, crushed and the pulp was innoculated firstly into a medium consisting of Jaggery 50 glut, yeast extract, 3 g/lit, malt extract, 3 g/lit, peptone 5 g/lit. The culture was incubated at 450C for 24 hrs. The culture was then plated onto another medium containing the same medium as above except jaggery which was replaced by molasses, This medium was incubated for 24 hrs. al 45 0C. The colonies of the Saccharomyces sp. grown were separated by colony character:istics.<br><br><br>
Example 2.<br><br>
The rotten grapes 15 gins. obtained from local vendors were surface sterilized, crushed and the pulp was innoculated firstly into a medium consisting of Jaggery 20 g/lit, yeast extract, 1.5 gllit, malt extract, 1.5 g/lit, peptone 3.5 g/lit. The culture was incubated at 450C for 48 hrs. The culture was then plated onto another medium containing the same medium as above except jaggery which was replaced by molasses, This mcdium was incubated for 24 hrs. at 45 0C. The colonies of the Saccharomyces sp. grown were separated by colony characte.r~istics.<br><br><br>
The present invention provides a process for the isolation of the new Saccharomyces sp. which can grow and ferment at high temperature upto 450C and could be effectively utilised for the preparation of many enzymes like invertase which has abandant industiral applications.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br><br>
1.	A process for the isolation of a novel thermophullic $accharomyces which comprises: surface sterilising by conventional methods the rotting grapes, crushing the surface sterilzed grapes and inoculating the pulp into medium (i) consisting of ingredients such as Jaggery -20-50, grins/litre (gpl), Yeast extract-i-3 gpl, Malt extract- 1-3 gpl, and Peptone-2-5 gpl, incubating the inoculated medium at 40-450C for 18 to 48 hrs, plating this culture onto medium(2) having composition consisting Molasses-20-50 gins/litre (gpl), Yeast extract- 1-3 gpl, Malt extract- 1-3 gpl, and Peptone- 2-5 gpl, isolating the colonies thus obtained and innoculating these colonies into a medium (2) at 40 to 45 0C for 24 to 48 hrs. with constant shaking or stirring, harvesting and centrifuging the innoculum, to obtain the colonies of the Saccharomyces sp.<br><br>
2.	A process for the isolation of novel thermophillic Saccharomyces sp. as substantially described hereinbefore with reference to examples.<br><br></td>
