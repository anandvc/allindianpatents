FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an antimicrobial medical device and an antimicrobial<br>
packaged medical device and their methods of making.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Each year, patients undergo a vast number of surgical procedures in the United States.<br>
Current data shows about twenty-seven million procedures are performed per year.<br>
Post-operative or surgical site infections ("SSIs") occur in approximately two to three<br>
percent of all cases. This amounts to more than 675,000 SSIs each year.<br>
The occurrence of SSIs is often associated with bacteria that can colonize on<br>
implantable medical devices used in surgery. During a surgical procedure, bacteria<br>
from the surrounding atmosphere may enter the surgical site and attach to the medical<br>
device. Specifically, bacteria can spread by using the implanted medical device as a<br>
pathway to surrounding tissue. Such bacterial colonization on the medical device may<br>
lead to infection and trauma to the patient. Accordingly, SSIs may significantly<br>
increase the cost of treatment to patients.<br>
Implantable medical devices that contain antimicrobial agents applied to or<br>
incorporated within have been disclosed and/or exemplified in the art. Examples of<br>
such devices are disclosed in European Patent Application No. EP 0 761 243. Actual<br>
devices exemplified in the application include French Percuflex catheters. The<br>
catheters were dip-coated in a coating bath containing 2,4,4 "-tricloro-2-<br>
hydroxydiphenyl ether (Ciba Geigy Irgasan (DP300)) and other additives. The<br>
catheters then were sterilized with ethylene oxide and stored for thirty days. Catheters<br>
coated with such solutions exhibited antimicrobial properties, i.e., they produced a zone<br>
of inhibition when placed in a growth medium and challenged with microorganism, for<br>
thirty days after being coated. It is not apparent from the application at what<br>
temperature the sterilized, coated catheters were stored.<br>
Most implantable medical devices are manufactured, sterilized and contained in<br>
packages until opened for use in a surgical procedure. During surgery, the opened<br>
package, packaging components contained therein, and the medical device are exposed<br>
to the operating room atmosphere, where bacteria from the air may be introduced.<br>
Incorporating antimicrobial properties into the package and the packaging components<br>
substantially prevents bacterial colonization on the package and components once the<br>
package has been opened. The antimicrobial package and packaging components, in<br>
combination with the incorporation of antimicrobial properties onto the medical device<br>
itself would substantially ensure an antimicrobial environment about the sterilized<br>
medical device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antimicrobial medical devices and antimicrobial<br>
packaged medical devices and methods for preparing them. In accordance with<br>
embodiments of the present invention, an antimicrobial agent source is utilized. The<br>
medical device, with or without one or more packaging component, is positioned within<br>
a package, and upon being subjected to sufficient conditions, a portion of the<br>
antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent source transfers to the package, the<br>
packaging component (if utilized) and the medical device. The transfer of the<br>
antimicrobial agent is in an amount sufficient to inhibit bacterial growth on the<br>
package, the packaging component (if utilized) and the medical device.<br>
In accordance with various embodiments of the present invention, the package may<br>
contain an antimicrobial agent source, may have an antimicrobial agent source attached<br>
to the inner surface of the package, or may have an antimicrobial agent source that is<br>
integral with one or more packaging component in the package or with the package<br>
itself. Alternatively, the medical device may be positioned within a package, and the<br>
package having the medical device is exposed to an external antimicrobial agent<br>
source. In these embodiments, the medical device is positioned within the package and<br>
may initially be free of an antimicrobial agent or may initially comprise one or more<br>
surfaces having an antimicrobial agent disposed thereon. The package, the<br>
antimicrobial agent source and the medical device are then subjected to time,<br>
temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to vapor transfer an effective amount of<br>
the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent source to the inner surface of the<br>
package and the medical device, thereby substantially inhibiting bacterial colonization<br>
on the medical device.<br>
The present invention is also directed to a method for making an antimicrobial medical<br>
device comprising the step of positioning an antimicrobial agent source in a package<br>
having a medical device, attaching an antimicrobial agent source to the inner surface of<br>
a package having a medical device, or providing an antimicrobial agent source that is<br>
integral with one or more packaging component in the package having the medical<br>
device or with the package itself. In these embodiments, the medical device that is<br>
positioned within the package may initially be free of an antimicrobial agent or may<br>
initially comprise one or more surfaces having an antimicrobial agent disposed thereon.<br>
The package, the antimicrobial agent source and the medical device are then subjected<br>
to time, temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to vapor transfer an effective<br>
amount of the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent source to the medical<br>
device, thereby substantially inhibiting bacterial colonization on the medical device.<br>

medical device to a packaging component at 55°C as a function of time.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Packaged Antimicrobial Medical Device<br>
The medical devices described herein are generally implantable medical devices and<br>
implants, including but not limited to mono and multifilament sutures, surgical meshes<br>
such as hernia repair mesh, hernia plugs, brachy seed spacers, suture clips, suture<br>
anchors, adhesion prevention meshes and films, and suture knot clips. Also included<br>
are implantable medical devices that are absorbable and non-absorbable. An<br>
absorbable polymer is defined as a polymer that will degrade and be absorbed by the<br>
body over a period of time when exposed to physiological conditions. Absorbable<br>
medical devices typically are formed from generally known, conventional absorbable<br>
polymers including but not limited to glycolide, lactide, copolymers of glycolide, or<br>
mixtures of polymers, such as polydioxanone, polycaprolactone, oxidized regenerated<br>
cellulose and equivalents thereof. Preferably, the polymers include polymeric materials<br>
selected from the group consisting of greater than about 70% polymerized glycolictej<br>
greater than about 70% polymerized lactide, polymerized l,4-dioxan-2-one, greater<br>
than about 70% polypeptide, copolymers of glycolide and lactide, greater than about<br>
70% cellulosics and cellulosic derivatives. Preferably, absorbable medical devices are<br>
made from polydioxanone, poliglecaprone, or a glycolide/lactide copolymer. Examples<br>
of absorbable medical device include mono and multifilament sutures. The<br>
multifilament suture includes sutures wherein a plurality of filaments is formed into a<br>
braided structure. Examples of non-absorbable medical devices include mono and<br>
multifilament sutures, surgical meshes such as hernia repair mesh, hernia plugs and<br>
brachy seed spacers, which may be polymeric or nonpolymeric. Non-absorbable<br>
medical devices may be made in whole or in part from polymeric materials that<br>
include, but are not limited to, polyolefms such as polypropylene; polyamides such as<br>
nylon; chlorinated and/or fluorinated hydrocarbons such as Teflon® material; or;<br>
polyesters such as Dacron® synthetic polyesters; or from nonpolymeric materials that<br>
include, but are not limited to, silks, collagen, stainless steel, titanium, cobalt chromium<br>
alloy, nitinol. Preferably, the non-absorbable medical devices are made from nylon or<br>
polypropylene.<br>
Suitable antimicrobial agents may be selected from, but are not limited to, halogenated<br>
hydroxyl ethers, acyloxydiphenyl ethers, or combinations thereof. In particular, the<br>
antimicrobial agent may be a halogenated 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether and/or a<br>
halogenated 2-acyloxy diphenyl ether, as described in U.S. Patent No. 3,629,477, and<br>
represented by the following formula:<br>
In the above formula, each Hal represents identical or different halogen atoms, Z<br>
represents hydrogen or an acyl group, and w represents a positive whole number<br>
ranging from 1 to 5, and each of the benzene rings, but preferably ring A can also<br>
contain one or several lower alkyl groups which may be halogenated, a lower alkoxy<br>
group, an allyl group, a cyano group, an amino group, or lower alkanoyl group.<br>
Preferably, methyl or methoxy groups are among the useful lower alkyl and lower<br>
alkoxy groups, respectively, as substituents in the benzene rings. A halogenated lower<br>
alkyl group, trifluoromethyl group is preferred.<br>
Antimicrobial activity similar to that of the halogen-o-hydroxydiphenyl ethers of the<br>
above formula is also attained using the O-acyl derivatives thereof which partially or<br>
completely hydrolyze under the conditions for use in practice. The esters of acetic acid,<br>
chloroacetic acid, methyl or dimethyl carbamic acid, benzoic acid, chlorobenzoic acid,<br>
methylsulfonic acid and chloromethylsulfonic acid are particularly suitable.<br>
One particularly preferred antimicrobial agent within the scope of the above formula is<br>
2,4,4"-trichloro-2"-hydroxydiphenyl ether, commonly referred to as triclosan <br>
(manufactured by Ciba Geigy under the trade name Irgasan DP300 or Irgacare MP).<br>
Triclosan is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been used in a variety of<br>
products, and is effective against a number of organisms commonly associated with<br>
SSIs. Such microorganisms include, but are not limited to, genus Staphylococcus, <br>
Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant <br>
Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and <br>
combinations thereof. <br><br>
The antimicrobial agent may be delivered to the medical device from an antimicrobial<br>
agent source that is positioned within or attached to the inner surface of a package.<br>
Specifically, the antimicrobial agent is transferred from the antimicrobial agent source<br>
to the medical device when the package, the antimicrobial agent source and the medical<br>
device are subjected to time, temperature and pressure conditions, as described below.<br>
For example, the antimicrobial agent source may be an antimicrobial agent-loaded<br>
paper reservoir, an antimicrobial agent-loaded porous pouch reservoir, an antimicrobial<br>
agent-loaded plastic reservoir, an antimicrobial agent-loaded sponge or foam reservoir,<br>
an antimicrobial agent-loaded tape, or an antimicrobial agent-loaded tablet.<br>
Alternatively, the antimicrobial agent source may be integral with the package itself,<br>
i.e., antimicrobial agent incorporated into or on the package itself, such as but not<br>
limited to, applied directly on the inner surface of the package. Where the<br>
antimicrobial agent source is in a paper or plastic reservoir, such reservoir may be<br>
integral with one or more packaging component in the package.<br>
Additionally, the medical device may optionally have a coating thereon, and/or may<br>
optionally comprise one or more surfaces having an antimicrobial agent disposed<br>
thereon prior to any transfer of antimicrobial agent to the medical device from the<br>
antimicrobial agent source. For example, it is advantageous to apply a coating<br>
composition having an antimicrobial agent therein to the surface of the medical device.<br>
Examples of medical devices, as well as coatings that may be applied thereto, may be<br>
found in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,201,216, 4,027,676, 4,105,034, 4,126,221, 4,185,637,<br>
3,839,297, 6,260,699, 5,230,424, 5,555,976, 5,868,244, and 5,972,008, each of which is<br>
hereby incorporated herein in its entirety. As disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,201,216,<br>
the coating composition may include a film-forming polymer and a substantially water-<br>
insoluble salt of a Cg or higher fatty acid. As another example, an absorbable coating<br>
composition that may be used for an absorbable medical device may include<br>
poly(alkylene oxylates) wherein the alkylene moieties are derived from C(, or mixtures<br>
of C4 to C]2 diols, which is applied to a medical device from a solvent solution, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,105,034. The coating compositions may include a<br>
polymer or copolymer, which may include lactide and glycolide, as a binding agent.<br>
The coating compositions may also include calcium stearate, as a lubricant; and an<br>
antimicrobial agent. The coating may be applied to the device by solvent-based coating<br>
techniques, such as dip coating, spray coating, or suspended drop coating, or any other<br>
coating means.<br>
Absorbable medical devices are moisture sensitive, that is, they are devices that will<br>
degrade if exposed to moisture in the atmosphere or in the body. It is known by those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art that medical devices made from absorbable polymers may<br>
deteriorate and lose their strength if they come into contact with water vapor prior to<br>
use during surgery. For instance, the desirable property of in vivo tensile strength<br>
retention for sutures will be rapidly lost if the sutures are exposed to moisture for any<br>
significant period of time prior to use. Therefore, it is desirable to use a hermetically<br>
sealed package for absorbable medical devices. A hermetically sealed package is<br>
defined herein to mean a package made of a material that serves as both a sterile barrier<br>
and a gas barrier, i.e., prevents or substantially inhibits moisture and gas permeation.<br>
Materials useful for constructing the package for absorbable medical devices, for<br>
example, include single and multilayered conventional metal foil products, often<br>
referred to as heat-sealable foils. These types of foil products are disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 3,815,315, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Another type of foil product that may be utilized is a foil laminate referred to in the<br>
field of art as a peelable foil. Examples of such peelable foil and substrates are<br>
disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,623,810, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its<br>
entirety. If desired, conventional non-metallic polymer films in addition to or in lieu of<br>
metal foil may be used to form the package for absorbable medical devices. Such fiims<br>
are polymeric and may include conventional polyolefins, polyesters, acrylics,<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons and the like, combinations thereof and laminates. These<br>
polymeric films substantially inhibit moisture and oxygen permeation and may be<br>
coated with conventional coatings, such as, for example, mineral and mineral oxide<br>
coatings that decrease or reduce gas intrusion. The package may comprise a<br>
combination of polymer and metal foils, particularly a multi-layer polymer/metal-foil<br>
composite, such as a polyester/aluminum foil/ethylacrylic acid laminate.<br>
Nonabsorbable medical devices may be packaged in any of the materials described<br>
above. In addition, it is desirable to package nonabsorbable medical devices in a<br>
package made of a material that serves as a sterile barrier, such as a porous material,<br>
i.e., medical grade paper, or a polymeric film or fabric that is permeable, to moisture<br>
and gas, i.e., TYVEK® nonwoven material, manufactured by DuPont and made from<br>
high-density polyethylene fibers. Preferably, nonabsorbable medical devices are<br>
packaged in the same packaging materials that are used for absorbable medical devices,<br>
such as hermetically sealed packages, when it is desirable to have antimicrobial<br>
medical devices having a shelf life of at least 6 months, preferably at least 1 year and<br>
most preferably at least 2 years.<br>
Microorganisms of the genus Staphylococcus are the most prevalent of all of the<br>
organisms associated with device-related surgical site infection. S. aureus and S.<br>
epidermidis are commonly present on patients" skin and as such are introduced easily<br>
into wounds. An efficacious antimicrobial agent against Staphylococcus is 2,4,4"-<br>
trichloro-2"-hydroxydiphenyl ether. This compound has a minimum inhibitory<br>
concentration (MIC) against S. aureus of 0.01 ppm, as measured in a suitable growth<br>
medium and as described by Bhargava, H. et al in the American Journal of Infection<br>
Control, June 1996, pages 209-218. The MIC for a particular antimicrobial agent and a<br>
particular microorganism is defined as the minimum concentration of that antimicrobial<br>
agent that must be present in an otherwise suitable growth medium for that<br>
microorganism, in order to render the growth medium unsuitable for that<br>
microorganism, i.e., the minimum concentration to inhibit growth of that<br>
microorganism. The phrases "an amount sufficient to substantially inhibit bacterial<br>
colonization" and "an effective amount" of the antimicrobial agent, as used herein, are<br>
defined as the minimum inhibitory concentration for S. aureus or greater.<br>
A demonstration of this MIC is seen in the disk diffusion method of susceptibility. A<br>
filter paper disk, or other object, impregnated with a particular antimicrobial agent is<br>
applied to an agar medium that is inoculated with the test organism. Where the<br>
antimicrobial agent diffuses through the medium, and as long as the concentration of<br>
the antimicrobial agent is above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), none of<br>
the susceptible organism will grow on or around the disk for some distance. This<br>
distance is called a zone of inhibition. Assuming the antimicrobial agent has a<br>
diffusion rate in the medium, the presence of a zone of inhibition around a disk<br>
impregnated with an antimicrobial agent indicates that the organism is inhibited by the<br>
presence of the antimicrobial agent in the otherwise satisfactory growth medium. The<br>
diameter of the zone of inhibition is inversely proportional to the MIC.<br>
Method for Making an Antimicrobial Medical Device<br>
In accordance with various methods of the present invention, a medical device is<br>
directly exposed to the antimicrobial agent, i.e., the antimicrobial agent source is<br>
located in the package having the medical device. For example, the package may<br>
contain an antimicrobial agent source, may have an antimicrobial agent source attached<br>
to the inner surface of the package, or the antimicrobial agent source may be integral<br>
with one or more packaging component in the package or with the package itself. In<br>
these embodiments, the medical device is positioned within the package and may<br>
initially be free of an antimicrobial agent or may initially comprise one or more<br>
surfaces having an antimicrobial agent disposed thereon. The package, the<br>
antimicrobial agent source and the medical device are then subjected to time,<br>
temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to vapor transfer an effective amount of<br>
the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent source to the medical device,<br>
thereby substantially inhibiting bacterial colonization on the medical device.<br>
In the case where the medical device is initially free of an antimicrobial agent, the<br>
antimicrobial agent is delivered to the medical device from an antimicrobial agent<br>
source when the package, the antimicrobial agent source and the medical device are<br>
subjected to time, temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to vapor transfer a<br>
portion of the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent source to the medical<br>
device.<br>
In the case where the medical device initially comprises one or more surfaces having an<br>
antimicrobial agent disposed thereon, the time, temperature and pressure conditions are<br>
sufficient to vapor transfer a portion of each of the antimicrobial agent disposed on the<br>
medical device and the antimicrobial agent in the antimicrobial agent source to the<br>
inner surface of the package, such that an effective amount of the antimicrobial agent is<br>
retained on the medical device, thereby substantially inhibiting bacterial colonization<br>
on the medical device and the inner surface of the package. In this embodiment, the<br>
amount or concentration of antimicrobial agent on the medical device is stabilized by<br>
providing additional antimicrobial agent in the packaging environment.<br>
Alternatively, the medical device may be positioned within a package, and the package<br>
having the medical device is exposed indirectly to an external antimicrobial agent<br>
source, i.e., the antimicrobial agent source is external to the package having the medical<br>
device. Specifically, the antimicrobial agent source and the package having the<br>
medical device are subjected to time, temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to<br>
vapor transfer an effective amount of the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial<br>
agent source to the medical device within the package, thereby substantially inhibiting<br>
bacterial colonization on the medical device. In this embodiment, the package may be<br>
made from a material that serves as a sterile barrier, such as a porous material or<br>
polymeric film that is permeable to moisture and gas, such that a gaseous antimicrobial<br>
agent source is capable of permeating or transmitting as a vapor through the package.<br>
For example, the package having the medical device may be placed in a sealed<br>
environment, and the antimicrobial agent source may be contained within the sealed<br>
environment or may be subsequently introduced to the sealed environment. The<br>
antimicrobial agent source may be any vapor form of the antimicrobial agent.<br>
The rate of vapor transfer of an antimicrobial agent such as triclosan from che<br>
antimicrobial agent source to the medical device is substantially dependent upon the<br>
time, temperature and pressure conditions under which the package and the medical<br>
device are processed, stored and handled. For example, Figure 1 illustrates that<br>
triclosan is capable of transferring from a suture to a packaging component (in a closed<br>
vial at atmospheric pressure) when the temperature is maintained at 55°C over a period<br>
of time. The conditions to effectively vapor transfer an antimicrobial agent such as<br>
triclosan include a closed environment, atmospheric pressure, a temperature of greater<br>
than 40°C, for a period of time ranging from 4 to 8 hours. Also included are any<br>
combinations of pressure and temperature to render a partial pressure for the<br>
antimicrobial agent that is the same as or greater than the partial pressure rendered,<br>
under the conditions described above, in combination with a period of time sufficient to<br>
render an effective amount or concentration of the antimicrobial agent on the medical<br>
device, i.e., the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for S. aureus or greater.<br>
Specifically, it is known to one of ordinary skill that if the pressure is reduced, the<br>
temperature may be reduced to effect the same partial pressure. Alternatively, if the<br>
pressure is reduced, and the temperature is held constant, the time required to render an<br>
effective amount or concentration of the antimicrobial agent on the medical device may<br>
be shortened. Generally, the amount of antimicrobial agent in the antimicrobial agent<br>
source is at least that amount which is necessary to deliver the effective amount of the<br>
antimicrobial agent on the medical device, when exposed to the conditions described<br>
below.<br>
Medical devices typically are sterilized to render microorganisms located thereon<br>
substantially non-viable. In particular, sterile is understood in the field of art to mean a<br>
minimum sterility assurance level of 10"6. Examples of sterilization processes are<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,815,315, 3,068,864, 3,767,362, 5,464,580, 5,128,101<br>
and 5,868,244, each of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. Specifically,<br>
absorbable medical devices may be sensitive to radiation and heat. Accordingly, it may<br>
be desirable to sterilize such devices using conventional sterilant gases or agents, such<br>
as, for example, ethylene oxide gas.<br>
An ethylene oxide sterilization process is described below, since the time, temperature<br>
and pressure conditions sufficient to vapor transfer the antimicrobial agent from the<br>
antimicrobial agent source to the medical device, are present in an ethylene oxide<br>
sterilization process. However the time, temperature and pressure conditions sufficient<br>
to vapor transfer the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent source to the<br>
medical device, may be effected alone or in other types of sterilization processes, and<br>
are not limited to an ethylene oxide sterilization process or to sterilization processes in<br>
general.<br>
As discussed above, absorbable medical devices are sensitive to moisture and are<br>
therefore often packaged in hermetically sealed packages, such as sealed foil packages.<br>
However, sealed foil packages are also impervious to sterilant gas. In order to<br>
compensate for this and utilize foil packages in ethylene oxide gas sterilization<br>
processes, processes have been developed using foil packages having gas permeable or<br>
pervious vents (e.g., TYVEK polymer). The gas permeable vents are mounted to an<br>
open end of the package and allow the passage of air, water vapor and ethylene oxide<br>
into the interior of the package. After the sterilization process is complete, the package<br>
is sealed adjacent to the vent so the vent is effectively excluded from the sealed<br>
package, and the vent is cut away or otherwise removed, thereby producing a gas<br>
impervious hermetically sealed package. Another type of foil package having a vent is<br>
a pouch-type package having a vent mounted adjacent to an end of the package, .<br>
wherein the vent is sealed to one side of the package creating a vented section. After<br>
the sterilization process is complete the package is sealed adjacent to the vented<br>
section, and the sealed package is cut away for the vented section.<br>
In one embodiment, the antimicrobial agent source is placed within the package,<br>
attached to the inner surface of the package, or is integral with one or more packaging<br>
component in the package or with the package itself. After the peripheral seal and side<br>
seals have been formed in the package, the packaged medical device may be placed<br>
into a conventional ethylene oxide sterilization unit. If the package is a foil package,<br>
the antimicrobial agent source may be any of the antimicrobial agent sources described<br>
above or the antimicrobial agent source may be an antimicrobial agent loaded-gas<br>
permeable vent. For example, an antimicrobial agent such as triclosan may be loaded<br>
onto a Tyvek gas permeable vent by coating the Tyvek strip with a solution of ethyl<br>
acetate and triclosan; the antimicrobial agent loaded gas permeable vent is positioned<br>
within a package by mounting it to a hermetic packaging material; the medical device is<br>
positioned within the hermetic packaging material; the periphery of the hermetic<br>
packaging material is sealed in a manner to enclose the medical device and to allow the<br>
passage of gas into the interior of the hermetic packaging material through the vent; the<br>
packaging material having the antimicrobial agent loaded gas permeable vent and the<br>
medical device is subjected to time, temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to<br>
vapor transfer an effective amount of the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial<br>
agent loaded gas permeable vent to the medical device; the packaging material is sealed<br>
to enclose the medical device and exclude the vent; and the vent is cut away to thereby<br>
produce an antimicrobial medical device.<br>
In another embodiment, the antimicrobial agent source may be introduced into the<br>
sterilization or other unit external to the package having the medical device. For<br>
example, the medical device is positioned within the package; the package having the<br>
medical device is exposed to an antimicrobial agent source; and the package having the<br>
medical device and the antimicrobial agent source is subjected to time, temperature and<br>
pressure conditions sufficient to vapor transfer an effective amount of the antimicrobial<br>
agent from the antimicrobial agent source to the medical device within the package,<br>
thereby substantially inhibiting bacterial colonization on the medical device. The<br>
package may be made from a material that serves as a sterile barrier, such as a porous<br>
material or a polymeric film that is permeable to moisture and gas, or from a material<br>
that results in a hermetically sealed package.<br>
Prior to the start of the cycle, the sterilization unit may be heated to an internal<br>
temperature of about 25°C. The sterilization unit is maintained about 22 to 37°C<br>
throughout the humidification and sterilization cycles. Next, a vacuum may be drawn<br>
on the sterilization unit to achieve a vacuum of approximately 1.8 to 6.0 kPa. In a<br>
humidification cycle, steam then may be injected to provide a source of water vapor for<br>
the product to be sterilized. The packaged medical devices may be exposed to water<br>
vapor in the sterilization unit for a period of time of about 60 to 90 minutes. Times<br>
may vary, however, depending upon the medical device being sterilized.<br>
Following this humidification portion of the cycle, the sterilization unit may be<br>
pressurized by the introduction of dry inert gas, such as nitrogen gas, to a pressure of<br>
between about 42 and 48 kPa. Once the desired pressure is reached, pure ethyl ene<br>
oxide may be introduced into the sterilization unit until the pressure reaches about 95<br>
kPa. The ethyl ene oxide may be maintained for a period of time effective to sterilize<br>
the packaged medical device. For example, the ethylene oxide may be maintained in<br>
the sterilization unit for about 360 to about 600 minutes for surgical sutures. The time<br>
required to sterilize other medical devices may vary depending upon the type of<br>
product and the packaging. The ethylene oxide then may be evacuated from the<br>
sterilization unit and the unit may be maintained under vacuum at a pressure of<br>
approximately 0.07 kPa for approximately 150 to 300 minutes in order to remove<br>
residual moisture and ethylene oxide from the sterilized packaged medical devices.<br>
The pressure in the sterilization unit may be returned to atmospheric pressure.<br>
The following stage of the process is a drying cycle. The packaged medical device may<br>
be dried by exposure to dry nitrogen and vacuum over a number of cycles sufficient to<br>
effectively remove residual moisture and water vapor from the packaged medical<br>
device to a preselected level. During these cycles, the packaged medical device may be<br>
subjected to a number of pressure increases and decreases, at temperatures greater than<br>
room temperature. Specifically, the jacket temperature of the drying chamber may be<br>
maintained at a temperature of between approximately 53°C to 57°C throughout the ,<br>
drying cycle. Higher temperatures, however, may be employed, such as about 65°C to<br>
70°C for sutures, and higher depending upon the medical device being sterilized. A<br>
typical drying cycle includes the steps of increasing the pressure with nitrogen to<br>
approximately 100 kPa, evacuating the chamber to a pressure of approximately 0.07kPa<br>
over a period of 180 to 240 minutes, reintroducing nitrogen to a pressure of 100 kPa<br>
and circulating the nitrogen for approximately 90 minutes, evacuating the chamber to a<br>
pressure of approximately 0.01 kPa over a period of approximately 240 to 360 minutes<br>
and maintaining a pressure of not more than 0.005 kPa for an additional 4 to 96 hours.<br>
At the end of the humidification, sterilization and drying cycles, which takes typically<br>
about 24 hours, the vessel is returned to ambient pressure with dry nitrogen gas. Once<br>
drying to the preselected moisture level is complete, the packaged medical device may<br>
be removed from the drying chamber and stored in a humidity controlled storage area.<br>
Upon completion of the sterilization process, the antimicrobial medical device, the<br>
package and/or the packaging component have thereon an amount of the antimicrobial<br>
agent effective to substantially inhibit colonization of bacteria on or adjacent the<br>
antimicrobial device, the package and/or the packaging component. The examples<br>
below demonstrate that it is possible to produce an antimicrobial medical device having<br>
an effective amount of antimicrobial agent for at least 6 months, preferably for at least<br>
1 year and most preferably for at least 2 years, after sterilization and packaging of the<br>
medical device and before its use in a surgical procedure, when a hermetically sealed<br>
package is used.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
27" length of VICRYL® sutures, size 5-0 and dyed (a braided multifilament suture<br>
composed of a copolymer made from 90% glycolide and 10% L-lactide, that is<br>
commercially available from Ethicon, Inc.), initially substantially free of an<br>
antimicrobial agent and positioned in a polypropylene suture tray, were placed in<br>
packages having an antimicrobial agent source located therein. In these examples,<br>
packaging components, i.e., paper lids made from medical grade, kraft paper, weighing<br>
about 0.45g each and used to cover the suture tray, were coated by dipping the<br>
individual lids in a solution containing 5% by weight triclosan in ethyl acetate. Each<br>
lid was held in the solution for approximately five seconds, allowed to air dry at room<br>
temperature overnight, and then positioned over the suture tray. The triclosan present<br>
on each lid ranged from 2-3% by weight of the total weight of the dried lid. The suture<br>
assemblies, each having the suture, the suture tray and the triclosan-loaded paper lid,<br>
were arranged in separate cavities created in a peelable foil packaging material, i.e., an<br>
ethylacrylic acid-coated aluminum foil composite, having a TYVEK® gas permeable<br>
vent mounted to an open end of the packaging material to allow the passage of air,<br>
water vapor and ethylene oxide into the interior of the cavities within the packaging<br>
material. The suture assemblies were then sterilized, which conveniently subjected the<br>
suture assemblies to time, temperature and pressure conditions sufficient to vapor<br>
transfer an effective amount of the antimicrobial agent from the antimicrobial agent<br>
source, i.e., the triclosan-loaded paper lid, to the suture. After the sterilization process<br>
was complete, the individual cavities were sealed and the gas permeable vent was<br>
effectively excluded to form sealed packages each having a suture assembly contained<br>
therein. The sutures were then removed from packages and subjected to zone of<br>
inhibition testing.<br>
The data included in the tables below was from zone of inhibition testing performed on<br>
the sutures, when challenged with Staphylococcus. aureus ATCC 6538; methicillin-<br>
resistant Staphylococcus. epidermidis ATCC 51625, Escherichia coli ATCC 8739,<br>
vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium ATCC 700221, or Streptococcus<br>
agalacticae ATCC 624, grown in Tryptic Soy broth at 37°C for 24 h. The culture was<br>
diluted in sterile 0.85% saline to create inocula with concentrations of approximately<br>
1,000,000 cfu (colony forming units) per milliliter. For each challenge organism, the<br>
suture was aseptically cut into 5-cm pieces. The pieces were placed in separate sterile<br>
Petri dishes with 0.1 mL of inoculum. Tryptic Soy agar was poured into the plates, and<br>
the plates were incubated at 37°C for 48 h. Zones of inhibition were read as the<br>
distance in millimeters from the suture to the edge of visible growth.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
This example is identical to EXAMPLE 1, except the suture was a PDS® II suture (a<br>
monofilament polydioxanone suture that is commercially available from Ethicon, Inc.)<br>
and the paper lid was coated by dipping the individual lids in a solution containing 10%<br>
by weight triclosan in ethyl acetate.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
This example is identical to EXAMPLE 1, except the suture was a PROLENE® suture<br>
(a monofilament polypropylene suture that is commercially available from Ethicon,<br>
Inc.) and the paper lid was coated by dipping the individual lids in a solution containing<br>
10% by weight triclosan in ethyl acetate.<br>
EXAMPLES 4-5<br>
The preparation of these samples was identical to the preparation of EXAMPLE 1,<br>
except a solution containing 1.1% (Example 4) or 5.6% (Example 5) by weight<br>
triclosan, 15% by weight copolymer of glycolide and lactide, and the remainder ethyl<br>
acetate, was used as the antimicrobial agent source, instead of the triclosan-loaded<br>
paper lid. 0.5 ml of these solutions were placed in separate cavities created in the<br>
peelable foil packaging material, i.e., under each suture assembly, and allowed to dry at<br>
room temperature overnight, such that Example 4 had 5 mg triclosan in each cavity,<br>
while Example 5 had 25 mg of triclosan in each cavity. Then sutures assemblies, each<br>
having a 27" suture wound in a polypropylene tray and covered with a paper lid, were<br>
placed into the cavities followed by sterilization.<br>
Examples 4 and 5 show that the use of an antimicrobial agent reservoir in the foil cavity is an<br>
effective means of generating a product that exhibits a zone of inhibition when challenged with<br>
S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The table below shows data from a tissue passage study using<br>
sutures prepared by the procedure described for Example 5. Specifically, a needle was<br>
manually attached to a sterile suture and then passed ten times through a raw chicken breast<br>
to determine if the triclosan would be removed. The data shows that significant zones of<br>
inhibition still remain after passing the suture through the tissue, when challenged with S.<br>
aureus and S. epidermidis.<br>
The preparation of EXAMPLE 6 was identical to the preparation of EXAMPLE 4,<br>
while the preparation of EXAMPLE 7 was identical to the preparation of EXAMPLE 5,<br>
except the suture was a PDS® II suture.<br>
Examples 6 and 7 show that the use of an antimicrobial agent reservoir in the foil cavity is an<br>
effective means of generating a product that exhibits a zone of inhibition when challenged with<br>
S. aureus and S. epidermidis. The table below shows data from a tissue passage study using<br>
sutures prepared by the procedure described for Example 7. Specifically, a needle was<br>
manually attached to a sterile suture and then passed ten times through a raw chicken breast<br>
to determine if the triclosan would be removed. The data shows that significant zones of<br>
inhibition still remain after passing the suture through the tissue, when challenged with S.<br>
aureus and S. epidermidis.<br>
EXAMPLES 8-10<br>
These examples are identical to EXAMPLE 1, except the suture was a dyed VICRYL®<br>
Plus suture, size 5-0 (a braided multifilament antimicrobial suture composed of a<br>
copolymer made from 90% glycolide and 10% L-lactide, having triclosan contained in<br>
a coating mixture composed of a copolymer of glycolide and lactide and calcium<br>
stearate and ethyl acetate, that is commercially available from Ethicon, Inc.). Example<br>
8 had 1.0% by weight triclosan in the coating mixture; Example 9 had 2.0%; and<br>
Example 10 had 3.0%, based on the total weight of the coating mixture.<br>
EXAMPLES 11-12<br>
These examples are identical to EXAMPLES 4-5, except the suture was a dyed<br>
VICRYL® Plus suture, size 2-0, with 2% by weight triclosan in the coating mixture.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
This example is identical to EXAMPLE 1, except that VICRYL® sutures, size 2-0 and<br>
dyed, were used and the antimicrobial agent source was a Tyvek® gas permeable strip.<br>
One side of a Tyvek strip was manually coated with ethyl acetate containing 20% by<br>
weight triclosan. Suture assemblies, each having the suture, a polypropylene suture<br>
tray and a paper lid, were arranged in separate cavities created in a peelable foil<br>
packaging material having the triclosan-loaded TYVEK® gas permeable strip mout. ted<br>
to an open end of the packaging material to allow the passage of air, water vapor and<br>
ethylene oxide into the interior of the cavities within the packaging material. The<br>
suture assemblies were sterilized. After the sterilization process was complete, the<br>
individual cavities were sealed and the gas permeable vent was effectively excluded to<br>
form sealed packages each having a suture assembly contained therein. Thereafter, the<br>
sutures were removed from packages and subjected to zone of inhibition testing. Three<br>
samples were taken from each suture; all samples showed zones of inhibitions when<br>
challenged with S. aureus and S. epidermis.<br>
