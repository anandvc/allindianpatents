				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Most of the terrain and aircraft vehicles moving today use gas-inflated tires with or<br>
without tubes. For a proper functioning, a tire has to contain a pre-established gas<br>
quantity (usually air, but also different kind of gases), that means that the gas in the tire<br>
must reach and maintain a prefixed pressure value in function of a determined reference<br>
temperature. When the tire is inflated by introducing a proper gas quantity, said<br>
quantity decreases because of natural gas leaks from the tire and, eventually, from other<br>
components of the wheel group; this occurs also because of accidental leaks, of more or<br>
less high intensity, due to damages and/or punctures. Moreover, the right quantity of<br>
gas to be introduced into the tire depends, according to the instructions of the<br>
manufacturers of the tires and the vehicles on which said tires are mounted, on the<br>
expected using conditions, and in particular on the load and speed. Therefore, more or<br>
less frequent interventions are necessary in order to modify or to reset the right quantity<br>
of gas inside the tires.<br>
MAIN FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The anti-sabotage and ami-theft device for inflating valves of the tires comprises:<br>
a cap with an internally threaded body screwing on an inflating valve of tire;<br>
an envelope connected to the internally threaded body through a free tripper allowing the<br>
screwing only and not the unscrewing of the cap, the envelope preventing to directly<br>
access to the threaded body,<br>
the access occurring only in a pre-established zone of the threaded body, while the<br>
unscrewing of the threading body occurring through a tool acting on said zone.<br>
In a first embodiment the free tripper presents a radial development.<br>
In a second embodiment the free tripper presents an axial development.<br>
An element is provided between the threaded body and the threaded end of the tube of<br>
the valve; the element generates an unscrewing couple, which is higher than the one due<br>
to the clamping of the threaded body on the tube only.<br>
In order to obtain the unscrewing of the cap, an undercut tool is used to reach the pre-<br>
established zone of the threaded body; the tool engaging teeth found on a lower<br>
appendix of the threaded body.<br>
The undercut tool is fitted with own teeth shaped to apply an unscrewing couple only and<br>
not a screwing one.<br>
The pre-established accessing zone to the threaded body for the unscrewing, engaged by<br>
a tool, is located on the upper part of the threaded body and it is reached through a<br>
passage in the envelope.<br>
The engaging zone of the external contour of the envelope presents knurls, grooved or<br>
polygonal profiles for an efficient transmission of the screwing torque.<br>
A sliding pair is provided, said sliding pair being formed by a radial protuberance and a<br>
corresponding groove located in the internal wall of the envelope, the sliding pair<br>
allowing the transmission of the torque in both directions between the envelope and a<br>
cylindrical member, and allowing the cylindrical member to freely axially translate inside<br>
an internal housing located between the threaded body and the envelope.<br>
A spring is further provided to keep the frontal teeth of the axial free tripper engaged.<br>
The axial free tripper comprises teeth integral with the threaded body and teeth integral<br>
with the cylindrical member; the shape of the teeth is chosen to allow the transmission<br>
of a sufficient screwing couple and a negligible unscrewing couple between the envelope<br>
and the threaded body.<br>
The radial free tripper comprises teeth integral with the threaded body and radially<br>
deforming teeth integral with the envelope; the shape of the teeth is chosen to allow the<br>
transmission of a sufficient screwing couple and a negligible unscrewing couple between<br>
the envelope and the threaded body.<br>
The contact between teeth, integral with the threaded body and teeth, integral with the<br>
envelope, occurs on contact surfaces inclining of an angle (y, 8) in order to disengage the<br>
contact between teeth and teeth, so that the screwing couple transmitted by the<br>
envelope to the body is limited. <br>
AIMS AND EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION <br>
In order to modify the gas quantity inside the tire, a valve is usually fixed on the tread of<br>
the wheel (in case of tires with tube, the valve is sealing fixed to the same tube and<br>
comes out from the tread through a hole).<br>
Said valve, shown in Fig 1, substantially consists of a metal tube (1) containing a body<br>
(2) fixed to its inner part through a sealing threaded connection (3), in which a self-<br>
closing member (4) with a sealing gasket (5) axially slides, said closing member (4) being<br>
hold in the closing position by a spring (6). The closing member (4) is capable of<br>
automatically opening when the pressure in its part faced outside, that is in the chamber<br>
(7), multiplied for the efficient surface of the sealing gasket (5) generates, on the closing<br>
member (4), an axial downwards force higher than the one due to the pressure in its part<br>
faced inside, that is in the chamber (8), or inside the tire, multiplied for the efficient<br>
surface of the sealing gasket (5) further to the force of the spring (6) or, vice-versa,<br>
capable of remaining closed when the force due to the pressure in its part faced outside<br>
(chamber 7) is lower than the one due to the pressure inside the tire (chamber 8) further<br>
to the force of the spring (6). Of course, the self-closing member (4) is also opened by a<br>
mechanical action from outside by applying a force on its end pushing towards the<br>
internal part of member (4) (this is an easy procedure to be followed by everyone to<br>
make the air come out from the tire).<br>
For what concerns the fixing of the valve to the wheel group, that is to the tread, in case<br>
of a tire with the tube, the metal tube (1) is let into a rubber protuberance connected to a<br>
hole in the tube of the tire, this protuberance being then inserted in its own hole in the<br>
tread; on the contrary, in case of tubeless tires, the metal tube (1) is properly shaped<br>
and eventually threaded, as shown in Fig 2, in its lower part in order to get a direct<br>
connection, by interposing proper gaskets, to the hole of the wheel tread (not shown)<br>
allowing the fixing through the clamping of a nut (full metal valve), which is connected<br>
to the hole of the tread by the simple interference of a rubber covering (Fig 3) applied to<br>
the metal tube (1) and then properly shaped and fitted with a groove having a suitable<br>
diameter (B), and with an abutment of diameter (A) capable of assuring the fixing of the<br>
valve loaded by the gas pressure inside the tire. All these embodiments are known and<br>
standard and the valves are obtained according to the different kinds of length and<br>
diameter.<br>
The end of the metal tube (1) faced outside is externally threaded (member 9 of Fig 1)<br>
both to allow the clamping of members for inflating the tire and to grant the screwing<br>
and the clamping of a device (10) closing and/or protecting the valve or another device<br>
presenting further aims depending on the functioning condition of the tire, which will be,<br>
here following, called "cap", capable of preventing the direct entrance to the sealing<br>
internal part of the self-closing member (4), and protecting said member (4) and the<br>
relevant gaskets from impacts and/or the introduction of polluting external means (dirt,<br>
dust, etc) causing damages or malfunctioning.<br>
The main aim of the cap is to protect the valve and its internal components against<br>
unexpected external means (dirt, etc), anyway, nowadays; several kinds of caps are<br>
available in order to assure more functions with different levels further to the usual<br>
protection against dirt and gas leaks.<br>
Caps with gaskets for clamping the end of the metal tube are known, see the member<br>
(11) of Fig 4, capable of sealing against any gas leak through the valve when its internal<br>
members (3, 4, 5) of Fig 1 cannot assure a perfect sealing.<br>
If the cap, for its particular shapes, proposes technologic members, and/or consists of<br>
special materials, and/or specially coloured, intensifies real or supposed technologic<br>
features (of the cap, wheel and/or its components, vehicle, etc) it meets aesthetic<br>
functions.<br>
In addition, the cap is capable of supplying particular information about, for example,<br>
the tire and its use: for example, the colour of the cap often indicates the inflating with<br>
gas different from the usual air (for example, nitrogen, helium, etc) and/or specifies the<br>
safety function of the cap (for example, the yellow colour of the caps of the valves used<br>
for the tires of the aircraft).<br>
Finally, caps are known including also measuring and/or surveying groups for the<br>
functioning condition of the tires (for example, by means of the measuring of the<br>
inflating pressure, temperature, etc.) and/or groups signalling the functioning condition<br>
outside. For example, the cap disclosed in EP No. 0 893 284 belonging to the Applicant. <br>
In these cases, said groups protect like a cap. <br>
Here following, as "cap" will be called any member capable of being applied at the end<br>
of a tire inflating valve carrying out one ore more functions, some of these having been<br>
mentioned above.<br>
Of course, the caps, as above defined, have to assure the mounting on the valve and the<br>
dismounting from the same valve (for example for the usual tire inflating) for many<br>
times.<br>
In addition, it is necessary to consider that many typologies of groups for surveying<br>
and/or controlling and/or signalling* the functioning condition of the tires have been<br>
developed. Some of these groups are clamped with the part of the valve located inside<br>
the tread; in this case the part of the valve located outside the tread usually maintains<br>
the shape and the dimension of a standard valve. Other groups are directly fixed to the<br>
internal part of the tread, and, therefore, the tire-inflating valve is not involved. In any<br>
case, the external end of the tire inflating valve is still protected by a cap screwed as in<br>
the usual inflating valves.<br>
All the systems known from the prior art, both for usual inflating valves for tires with<br>
usual protection caps, and for special valves containing devices for surveying and/or<br>
controlling and/or signalling the functioning condition of the tires, and for usual valves in<br>
which, instead of the usual protection cap, a device for surveying and/or controlling<br>
and/or signalling the functioning condition of the tires is screwed at the ends of the<br>
valve, do not provide any appropriate mean to prevent the usual unscrewing of the part<br>
screwed to the external end of the valve (either for an usual cap or a more composite<br>
group for surveying and/or controlling and/or signalling the functioning condition of the<br>
tires). Therefore, said part is screwed to the valve (by hand or by proper tools) and,<br>
consequently, is easily unscrewed (by hand or by said tools). On the wheels of the land<br>
and aircraft vehicles with tires, anti-sabotage and an anti-theft function is expected. The<br>
anti-theft function can be considered as a subset, or a consequence, of the anti-sabotage<br>
function, in particular when the cap consists of a more complex device capable of<br>
carrying out other functions (for example, surveying and/or signalling the functioning<br>
condition of the tire) and/or, anyway, fitted with an own sensible value.<br>
The known tire inflating valves have a cap which, if it does not carry out other functions<br>
for surveying and/or controlling and/or signalling the functioning condition of the tires,<br>
generally protects the internal part of the valve, being used also, if it is fitted with a<br>
proper gasket (11), as further sealing against gas leak through its inflating valve.<br>
The cap (10), usually consisting of polymeric or metallic material, fitted or not with a<br>
sealing gasket for the tire inflating valve, is screwed on the threaded end of the valve,<br>
usually by hand, and, therefore, it is always easily unscrewed by hand. Also in case of<br>
more improved caps, eventually made of more resistant materials (for example metal<br>
substances) and screwed on the valve through stronger clamping couples obtained by<br>
means of proper manoeuvring keys or tools (pincers, for example), the removing of the<br>
cap is easier.<br>
Everyone can unduly remove the cap without particular ability and/or proper tools in<br>
few seconds, in order to easily access to the valve and to its internal components (and,<br>
through them, inside the tire) and/or to appropriate the cap.<br>
Both in case of usual protecting caps of the tire valves and in case of more complicated<br>
devices applied on the valves instead of the usual protecting cap, the theft does not<br>
cause the loss of an economical value only (that is very cheap in case of usual protecting<br>
cap) and the possible end of the functions the stolen cap carried out (in particular the<br>
devices for surveying and/or controlling and/or the signalling the function condition of<br>
the tires used instead of the usual cap), but, above all, the loss of the cap causes the risk<br>
of contamination and possible dangerous external actions for the valve body, and in<br>
particular for the self-closing member (4). In any case, the theft causes inconvenience,<br>
trouble, and annoyance for the owner and/or driver of the vehicle. Therefore, the anti-<br>
theft function for these devices is suggested both for usual protecting caps of the tire<br>
valves, and for a device signalling the tire inflating condition.<br>
In addition to the above matter, the main problem of tampering or of the real sabotage is<br>
connected, since the removal of the protecting cap of the valve (for any kind of it) is<br>
often carried out not only to take possession of the cap, but also to access to the self-<br>
closing member (4) acting the opening of the valve and allowing the leakage of gas from<br>
the tire. Further to more evident actions, one of the classic case can occur (and that often<br>
occurs, in fun, from spite or for other worse reasons, up to a real attempt to the health<br>
of the driver and the passengers of the vehicle) is the intentional total or partial deflating<br>
by someone, of one or more tires (that probably being the case more easily and quickly<br>
to be obtained and, also, the worst one. In fact, it is very difficult to see a partial and<br>
unexpected deflating when getting in a vehicle or driving it at low speed, but the<br>
consequence can be even fatal because of the worsening of the driving and safety<br>
conditions for the vehicle, above all in case of high speed).<br>
In order to obtain the partial or total deflating of the tire without particular effort,<br>
without using tools, without evident actions, that is without risks and in a short time, it<br>
is sufficient to remove (temporally or definitely) the protecting cap of the tire valve and<br>
to manually and directly act on the self-closing member (4) housed inside the tire<br>
inflating valve: pushing it with a soft effort towards the inside of the valve, the self-<br>
closing member (4) opens and allows the leakage of gas from the tire. Apart from the<br>
purpose of this action, it is a sabotage, which can have more or less serious<br>
consequences, from the only annoyance to the disaster. The matter is rather important<br>
in an age when, because of the political, religious, social, racial etc. reasons, the risk of<br>
attempts to particular subjects or, also, for terrorist purpose (therefore, without an<br>
exact choice of the person to be hit) it is increased, as the daily news disclose. The<br>
chance, so doing, to cause serious damages with a real cheap cost and a negligible risk<br>
cannot be undervalued (consider a sabotage of the tires of a bus), so that such a device<br>
being available for all the vehicles becomes very important. This kind of sabotage so<br>
easily practicable could be prevented, or, at least, could take a long time, or could be<br>
difficult and risky to be carried out, if it should be impossible to unscrew by hand the<br>
protecting cap of the tire valve. This behaviour of the valve would also carry out the<br>
secondary anti-theft function as above disclosed.<br>
It is, therefore, useful and important to prevent such a situation. To obtain the desired<br>
results it should be sufficient to prevent the removing of the cap (10) (both for usual<br>
protecting cap or a device with other functions, as, for example, for controlling and/or<br>
signalling the functioning and/or using condition of the tire) without using a particular<br>
key or a tool available for staff only authorised to access to the valve or, anyway, to<br>
remove the cap.<br>
AIMS AND FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
The aim of the invention is to remedy to the failure of the prior art. The invention, as<br>
claimed, solves the problem of creating an anti-sabotage and anti-theft device for tire<br>
inflating valves.<br>
The solved problems and the main features of the invention are disclosed below by A<br>
referring to the accompanying drawings, not limiting the purpose of the invention:<br>
1. To prevent the undue or unwanted removing of the cap (10) that means, practically,<br>
to provide the cap with the desired anti-sabotage function and, consequently, with<br>
the desired anti-theft function of the cap, without modifying the structure of the<br>
valve and the usual montage and use of the cap formalities;<br>
2. To provide the cap with a device for controlling of the clamping torque.<br>
As shown in Figs5, 6, the anti-sabotage device is obtained in several ways, for example,<br>
by locating on the end of the valve, as interference for the connection of the cap, an<br>
undercut shaped contour (12) (See Fig 5), instead of the usual threading (9) so that the<br>
clamping cap (10) radially embraces one of its parts (13) around the undercut shaped<br>
contour (12); or, by keeping the threading (9), to provide (Fig 6) the cap (10) with a<br>
further radial clamping device (14) with respect to the end of the valve (clamp, radial<br>
screw, etc.) requiring a particular tool to be acted for removing the cap (10).<br>
It is necessary to consider that it is not suggested to modify the usual tire inflating valve<br>
and, therefore, it is better to maintain the threaded end (standard) unchanged even<br>
providing the valve/cap group with an anti-sabotage-anti-theft device. It is also<br>
suggested to avoid using systems capable of changing or modifying the threaded end<br>
and, in general, the standard original structure of the valve.<br>
It is also preferable, for practical reasons, that the montage and the clamping of the cap<br>
(10) (also in case of a more complex system and carrying out one or more functions,<br>
with particular regard to functions for controlling and signalling the functioning<br>
condition of the tire) and the starting of the anti-sabotage-anti-theft function are as<br>
normally obtained as for the screwing and clamping of the usual protecting cap, by<br>
hand, without particular tools or keys, since the anti-sabotage and anti-theft functions<br>
are useful only to prevent the removing of the cap, while they cause a difficult montage<br>
phase of the cap on the valve.<br>
To attain the anti-sabotage and anti-theft functions without modifying the usual<br>
montage and clamping formalities of the cap (10) and without changing, anyway, the<br>
usual standard inflating valve of the tire, that is by maintaining the connection through<br>
the threading, it is necessary to provide the cap with apparatuses prevent the removing<br>
by just unscrewing unless a particular key or tool, to be supplied and not available for<br>
everyone, is used.<br>
This is the aim of the invention*. The solution cannot, of course, be so obvious:<br>
therefore, it cannot, for example, base on a very strong final clamping of the cap (10)<br>
during the montage for the screwing, that can prevent the unscrewing without using the<br>
keys or pincers allowing to apply quite high unscrewing couples on the cap (10).<br>
In fact, everyone can be easily provided with these generic tools or members with<br>
equivalent function, and, therefore, it should not necessary, in this case, any particular<br>
tool or key for authorised staff only. Substantially, the function cannot be easily<br>
associated to a higher torque to be applied to the final clamping of the cap (10) after the<br>
screwing on the valve body.<br>
In the same way, the function cannot be reached through a device which, when it is<br>
screwed on the valve, requires the permanent changing or the destruction of the device<br>
(to be carried out by means of particular tools) to obtain its removing, since it avoids the<br>
main need to use again the cap (10) for several times.<br>
On the contrary, it is important that the cap (10) is normally screwed by applying the<br>
proper torque to the envelope (16) (usually this operation is carried out by hand,<br>
therefore the torque never results very high because of, also, the small diameters of the<br>
envelope), but that, when the clamping is reached, the threaded connecting member is no<br>
more removable if a particular tool, or mechanism or key is not used.<br>
A formality to reach what is desired is obtained through a cap (10) that is no more a<br>
single part (now, the usual caps have an envelope which is directly threaded inside for<br>
the clamping to the end of the valve) but it is fitted with, at least, the two main members<br>
of Fig 7: an internally threaded member (15) capable of screwing on the end of the valve<br>
(9) and the envelope (16) of the cap. The connection between the envelope (16), the<br>
clamping and screwing couple is applied to (for example by hand by a proper tool) and<br>
the internally threaded member (15) is reached though a free tripper (Fig 7 section A-A)<br>
allowing the transmission of a torque between the envelope (16) and the threaded body<br>
(15) in the screwing direction only. So doing, when the clamping of the cap is reached<br>
and a proper stopping torque is granted (capable of contrasting an unscrewing couple),<br>
it is impossible to unscrew the cap from the valve since the unscrewing couple applied<br>
to the envelope (16) is not transmitted to the threaded body (15).<br>
In order to remove the cap (10) it*is necessary to provide parts on the threaded body<br>
(15); said parts being properly shaped and capable of clamping by means of a special<br>
key, or tool, or similar mechanism to be supply and available for staff only charged to<br>
remove the cap (10). Suitably, said parts are located in a zone of the cap/valve group not<br>
directly accessible, sp that the unscrewing by means of improper tools instead of<br>
specific tools is prevented.<br>
In addition, not only a device for surveying and/or controlling and/or signalling the<br>
functioning condition of the tires mounted in place of the protecting cap of the valve,<br>
but also the current protecting caps of the valve need a full and sure clamping on the<br>
threading (9) of the tube of the tire inflating valve. This clamping is necessary not only<br>
to avoid their unscrewing and falling during the running of the vehicle because of the<br>
external forces and vibrations, but also to assure the efficiency of one of the functions<br>
that these components (also in case of current protecting caps) have to carry out,<br>
consisting of creating, through a gasket (11), a further barrier to the eventual gas leakage<br>
through the valve when the self-closing member (4) or other internal parts of the<br>
inflating valve cannot assure a proper sealing for the gas of the tire and, therefore, cause<br>
a leakage through the internal passage of the valve.<br>
The function preventing the manual unscrewing of the cap (10) after its screwing on the<br>
tire inflating valve is obtained by separating the envelope (16), capable of being<br>
manipulated and used to transmit to the device the couple necessary for the screwing,<br>
from the internally threaded member (15), capable of screwing on the threaded end of<br>
the tube of the tire inflating valve, and by introducing between them an unidirectional<br>
free tripper.<br>
Said unidirectional free tripper has a radial shape according to the functioning schemes<br>
Said unidirectional free tripper has a radial shape according to the functioning schemes<br>
of Fig 7 Section A-A, or an axial shape, according to the functioning schemes of Fig 8.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the radial shape, radial teeth (17) are found on<br>
the external cylindrical surface of the threaded body (15), the teeth (17) being capable of<br>
engaging the frontal surface of proper protuberances (18) connected to the internal<br>
cylindrical surface of the envelope (16). Said protuberances (18) are normally located in<br>
the configuration of Fig 7 Section A-A, but they present an elasticity sufficient to allow<br>
their radial flexion towards outside so that they disengage, eventually, from the teeth<br>
(17).<br>
The radial elasticity of the protuberances (18) is eventually controlled or changed by<br>
means of external elastic members, as springs, polymeric members, etc.<br>
By applying a torque in a clockwise direction (according to Fig 7 Section A-A) to the<br>
envelope (16), the protuberances (18) engage the teeth (17) and transmit the torque to<br>
the threaded body (15). Vice-versa, by applying a torque in a counter-clockwise<br>
direction (according to Fig 7 Section A-A) to the envelope (16), the protuberances (18)<br>
slide on the back of the teeth (17) and they do not transmit any torque to the threaded<br>
body (15) (a minimum value due to the friction during the sliding of the protuberances<br>
(18) on the back of the teeth (17) excepted).<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the axial scheme as for Fig 8 of the frontal teeth<br>
(19), parallel to the axis of the device and located on an external circumference of the<br>
threaded body (15), engage the homologous axial frontal teeth (20) located on a<br>
cylindrical member (21) to be co-axially mounted on the threaded body (15) and capable<br>
of axially sliding downwards with respect to the body (15). The sliding has a sufficient<br>
width to disengage the homologous teeth, while a spring (22) pushes on the cylindrical<br>
member (21) upward, which tends to maintain the teeth (19, 20) in contact each other.<br>
For mounting reasons of the cylindrical member (21), the threaded body (15) consists of<br>
two parts (15a, 15b) welded each other.<br>
The cylindrical member (21) is connected through a sliding pair, for example the radial<br>
protuberance (23), to a corresponding groove (24) located in the internal wall of the<br>
envelope (16); so doing, it is possible to transmit a torque in both directions between<br>
the envelope (16) and the cylindrical member (21), which, anyway, carries out its axial<br>
translation in the housing located inside the external cylindrical surface of the threaded<br>
body (15) by contrasting the action of the spring (22).<br>
By applying a torque in the screwing direction on the envelope (16), said torque is<br>
transmitted to the cylindrical member (21), its axial teeth (20) engage the homologous<br>
axial teeth (19) of the threaded body (15). In this way, the stopping torque is<br>
transmitted to the threaded body (15).<br>
After the clamping, a non-return couple acts between the threaded body (15) and the<br>
threaded end (9) of the tube (1) of the tire-inflating valve.<br>
By acting a torque in the unscrewing direction on the envelope (16), said torque is<br>
transmitted to the cylindrical member (21), its axial teeth (20) tend to slide on the<br>
homologous back of the axial teeth (19) of the threaded body (15); this is due to the<br>
particular inclination angle of the backs of the teeth, so that the cylindrical member (21)<br>
tends to downwards translate against the force of the spring (22), without transmitting<br>
an unscrewing couple to the threaded body (15), a value of the friction couple in the<br>
sliding motion of the backs of the axial teeth excepted.<br>
The spring (22), as shown in Fig 9, is also located between the threaded body (15) and<br>
the envelope (16): in this case, said spring (22) acts as above, if the sliding pair between<br>
the envelope (16) and the cylindrical member (21) presents an axial abutment<br>
compelling the cylindrical member (21) to move downwards the envelope (16) against<br>
the force of the spring (22), if the unscrewing couple is applied to the envelope (16) and<br>
the teeth backs of the cylindrical member (21) slide with respect to the ones of the<br>
threaded body (15).<br>
With this configuration, it is also possible to make the envelope (16) and the cylindrical<br>
member (21) in just one piece or make them integral each other.<br>
The embodiment with radial arrangement presents a radial encumbrance higher than the<br>
axial arrangement: therefore, this axial arrangement is better than the radial one because<br>
of the limits for the radial admissible encumbrance with respect to the environment and<br>
the components existing around the tire inflating valve.<br>
It is obvious that, by using these kinds of mechanisms, only a part of the torque in the<br>
screwing direction (in a clockwise direction in Fig 7 if a right thread is used) is<br>
transmitted to the threaded body (15) because of the friction between the free tripper<br>
teeth and the threaded body (15).<br>
In both radial and axial embodiments, the mesh among the homologous teeth is replaced<br>
by homologous cavities on both parts with interposition of properly shaped floating<br>
connecting rods, as for free trippers of common industrial production.<br>
So doing, the unscrewing of the device acting on the external envelope (16) is prevented,<br>
as it is desired, on condition that the threaded body (15) is clamped if it is screwed,<br>
causing a non-return clamping couple with a value higher than the torque that can be<br>
transmitted in the unscrewing direction, said torque being low but existing.<br>
In order to assure a higher non-return clamping couple, further to the usual friction<br>
between both parts connected through the thread when their both ends are in contact,<br>
other technical members are used, as for example:<br>
• Self-clamping devices in the threaded body (15) on the male thread (9), as a partial<br>
deformation of the female thread of the threaded body (15) or the interposition, on<br>
its upper end, of a deforming element capable of causing an high friction couple on<br>
the thread (9), as usually used for the self-clamping nuts. (See Filippi, Disegno di<br>
Macchine, Vol. II, Hoepli as known not limiting or exhaustive examples);<br>
• Further components allowing a strong friction and an effective non-return couple<br>
between both parts (15, 19) fixed each other, as for example elastic washers of UNI<br>
1751 e 1752 o DIN 128, undulated and knurled elastic washers, plane or conic<br>
elastic washers with toothing according to UNI 3703, 3704, 3705, 3706, etc (See<br>
Filippi as cited), to be applied to the abutment end of the male thread (9) in order to<br>
avoid damages of the male thread.<br>
An embodiment is shown in Fig 10: the upper abutment end of the male thread section<br>
(9) of the tube (1) of the inflating valve contemporaneously touches both the sealing<br>
gasket (11) and the element (25) characterised by elastic axial toothings engaging the seat<br>
found on the upper end of the cavity of the threaded body (15) and the abutment end of<br>
the tube during the clamping, causing a strong non-return couple against the unscrewing.<br>
To assure the unscrewing is carried out when required, without carrying out by hand or<br>
by usual tools and/or commercial members, it is necessary to apply the unscrewing<br>
couple directly on the threaded body (15) in zones which are reachable only by means<br>
of proper tools and available only for buyer of components fitted with anti-theft<br>
devices. <br>
An embodiment is shown in Figg 8, 11, this embodiment using a special key (26) with<br>
two arms on the lower part (27) of the threaded body (15); the key (26) axially<br>
extended downwards so that proper radial notches (28), capable of introducing the teeth<br>
(29) of the special key (26), are formed. Said lower part (27) is covered by the external<br>
envelope (16) and is undercut with respect to the envelope (16) if someone wants to<br>
access from outside (considering the usual mounting condition of the tire valves on the<br>
vehicle wheels). Only,by means of a key capable of conforming to the undercut and<br>
engaging the notches (28) found on the lower part (27) of the threaded body (15), so<br>
that the required unscrewing couple is applied to the threaded body (15), the<br>
unscrewing of the valve cap is carried out.<br>
Both arms (26a, 26b) of the special key (26) are flexible or movable in the radial<br>
direction to open and allow reaching the lower part (27) of the threaded body (15).<br>
The teeth (29) located at the ends of the arms (26a, 26b) of the special key (26) to<br>
engage the lower part (27) of the threaded body (15) are shaped as shown in Fig 12 in<br>
order to be used just for applying a unscrewing couple to the threaded body (15), said<br>
teeth (29) present a sloping plane tending to extract them from the notch (28) if a<br>
screwing couple is applied. This is useful to avoid, anyway, the application of<br>
exceeding clamping couples.<br>
A further embodiment to directly apply the unscrewing couple to the threaded body<br>
(15) in zones which are reached only by means of proper special tools consists, as<br>
shown in Fig 13, of creating a central opening (30) in the upper wall of the external<br>
envelope (16), through said central opening (30) a blind hole (31), finding on a<br>
protuberance (32) located on the upper part of the threaded body (15), is reached. The<br>
protuberance has a proper and non standard contour where only a key with a male<br>
profile having the same area of the blind hole (31) is inserted for unscrewing.<br>
To prevent the introduction of impurities, the interference zone between the central<br>
opening (30) of the envelope (16) and the protuberance (32) is fitted with a proper<br>
gasket (33).<br>
In all the described embodiments, in order to prevent the introduction of impurities, a<br>
further gasket or protecting lip (34) is provided in the lower part of the envelope (16) in<br>
its interface zone with the cylindrical lower part of the threaded body (15).<br>
In all the above mentioned embodiments, it is also possible to shape the external<br>
contour of the envelope (16) in the engaging zone for applying the couple (both manual<br>
and by means of manoeuvring keys or proper tools) not only with a cylindrical shape<br>
but also with shapes more suitable for a better clamping and transmission of the torque,<br>
as for example, knurls, grooved or polygonal contours as shown in Fig 14.<br>
The clamping of the cap on the valve is correctly reached when it is obtained by means<br>
of a proper, sufficient and not excessive final couple. Both in case of manual screwing of<br>
the cap on the end of the tire inflating valve and, above all, in case of using of ancillary<br>
tools for a stronger clamping couple, the risk is to apply a too strong clamping couple<br>
damaging the cap and/or the sealing gasket (11). But, the application of an excessive<br>
clamping couple is not the only problem: also an insufficient clamping couple is harmful<br>
since it invalidates the sealing gasket (11) action and causes the unexpected, even full,<br>
unscrewing of the cap because of the vibrations due to the running of the vehicle.<br>
Advantageously, the anti-sabotage and anti-theft device applied to the protecting cap of<br>
the tire valve (also in case the cap comprises groups for surveying and/or controlling<br>
and/or signalling the functioning condition of the tires) is, therefore, fitted with members<br>
assuring an efficient and full clamping of the threaded elements (15, 9) and of the<br>
eventual gasket (11) located inside the cap for sealing on the upper edge of the threaded<br>
end (9) of the tire inflating valve by a not skilled person who has not any proper tool<br>
(and, therefore, he is not able to verify if the couple for the screwing has a sufficient<br>
value for clamping).<br>
Another embodiment is suggested which, further to assure a full and efficient clamping<br>
of the threaded body (15) on the valve (9), that is to advise the operator when a<br>
screwing torque with a proper value is reached, prevents an excessive clamping by<br>
applying screwing torque with a value higher than the proper one. In fact, the excessive<br>
clamping causes, as known, a quick deterioration of the component and/or its<br>
destruction and consequent uselessness when protection caps for tire inflating valves<br>
made of plastic are used. That particularly occurs when the cap presents a gasket in the<br>
beat zone for sealing of the tire gas. An excessive clamping torque easily damages this<br>
gasket. Of course, this occurs also in case of a component screwed on the end of the<br>
valve carrying out other functions, as for example surveying and/or controlling and/or<br>
signalling the functioning condition of the tire,not only in case of an usual protection<br>
cap.<br>
To reach this purpose it is necessary, therefore, to apply a limiting device for the<br>
screwing torque also capable of advising the operator if the required torque value is<br>
obtained. The usual and well-known tire valves, and relevant protection caps, do not<br>
present any function or any anti-theft and anti-sabotage device, nor mechanisms<br>
assuring a full and efficient clamping of the cap and its sealing gasket on the threaded<br>
end of the tire inflating valve. The same thing is valid for the device surveying and/or<br>
controlling and/or signalling the functioning condition of the well-known tires.<br>
A device to get what mentioned above consists in applying a member limiting the<br>
screwing torque applied by the external envelope (16) to the threaded body (15)<br>
through the free tripper.<br>
Considering the radial free tripper with teeth integral with pieces of Fig 7 Section A-A<br>
shown in Fig 15, the frontal part located between the teeth (17) and the protuberances<br>
(18) is so shaped that the frontal part is not radial, that is perpendicular to the force<br>
mutually transmitted each others (approximately tangential), but slanted with a proper<br>
angle ? with respect to the radial direction causing, during the contact between both<br>
surfaces A and B of the tooth (17) and the protuberance (18), a radial component R<br>
tending to bend the protuberance (18) towards outside in order to disengage it from the<br>
corresponding tooth on the threaded body (15).<br>
When a pre-established perpendicular force F between the two surfaces A and B (that is<br>
when a pre-established torque value applied to the external envelope (16) is reached<br>
assuring the proper clamping of the threaded body (15) on the tube of the tire inflating<br>
valve), the radial component R reaches a value causing the disengaging of the two<br>
surfaces A and B of the teeth of the free tripper. This, as desired, limits the maximum<br>
clamping couple to be applied and advises the operator, who is applying the torque,<br>
that a quick decrease of the opposite couple, together with a vibration and noise due to<br>
the radial release of the teeth, by indicating the correct conclusion of the clamping<br>
operation. So doing a first kind of radial free tripper is reached, also forming a couple<br>
limiting device which is easily regulated by properly planing the angle ? and the elastic<br>
reaction of the protuberances (18).<br>
With regards to the axial free tripper embodiment as shown in Fig 8, the couple limiting<br>
device is made by a slant 6 of Fig 16 to the contacting surfaces of the frontal teeth (19,<br>
20), initially on planes parallel to the axis of the device, transmitting the torque between<br>
the external envelope (16) and the threaded body (15) through the cylindrical member<br>
(21): the same effect as described above for the radial free tripper is reached. So doing,<br>
moreover, frontal cams (19, 20) are obtained allowing a relative helical movement<br>
between the external envelope (16) and the threaded body (15). By using a contrasting<br>
elastic member (the spring (22) of Fig 9), properly loaded, tending, as reaction, to<br>
prevent the axial movement of the cylindrical member (21) and/or the external envelope<br>
(16) with respect to the threaded body (15), said helical movement, and the relevant<br>
axial descent of the cylindrical member (21) and/or the external envelope (16) with<br>
respect to the threaded body (15), begins only after the screwing couple applied to the<br>
external envelope (16) has exceeded a value capable of generating, in the helical coupling<br>
of the frontal cams (19, 20), an axial force higher than the one due to the contrasting<br>
elastic member (22). When this couple value has been exceeded (corresponding to the<br>
correct clamping couple of the two threaded elements) the relative sliding of the helical<br>
surfaces E and G of the frontal cams (19, 20) and the descent, for a stroke C, of the<br>
cylindrical member (21) and/or the external envelope (16) with respect to the threaded<br>
body (15), at the end of which the cylindrical member (21) and/or the external envelope<br>
(16), due to the force of the contrasting elastic element (22), releases again upwards<br>
until the surface G of the connected frontal cam is in contact with the surface E' of the<br>
immediately following tooth located on the threaded body (15). In this way a second<br>
kind of axial free tripper is obtained which, in function of the force of the contrasting<br>
elastic element (22), forms a couple limiting device capable of being easily adjusted by<br>
properly planing the angle 6 and the contrasting force of the spring (22), and, as for the<br>
previous case, a system advising that the correct couple value has been reached.<br>
By applying a couple to the external envelope (16) higher than the one necessary to<br>
exceed the maximum torque to be applied to the threaded body (15) and the reaction of<br>
the elastic element (22), an axial force P positive in the direction shown in Fig 17 is<br>
reached. This force P with stroke C is due to the helical coupling of the surfaces E and<br>
G of the frontal cams and to the external envelope (16) with respect to the threaded<br>
body (15) or other interposed or connected members. Said axial force P is used for<br>
carrying out functions relevant to the mounting and/or functioning and/or using of both<br>
usual protection caps of tire inflating valve and, more particularly, devices for<br>
controlling and/or surveying and/or signalling the functioning condition of the tires<br>
screwed to the external end of the inflating valve.<br>
A further advantage of this embodiment is due to the fact that, before applying the<br>
above mentioned positive axial force P, it is, anyway, necessary to efficiently complete<br>
the clamping of the threaded body (15) on the end (9) of the valve by assuring in<br>
advance the good result of this function.<br>
What said up to now is useful for all the above mentioned cases, in particular when the<br>
axial force P is necessary for carrying out the functions relevant the mounting and/or<br>
functioning and/or using of usual protection caps of the tire inflating valve and, more<br>
particularly, devices for controlling and/or surveying and/or signalling the functioning<br>
condition of the tires screwed to the external end of the inflating valve which, before<br>
their activation, have to be correctly clamped on the valve with a pre-established couple<br>
value even if the operation is carried out by hand and without any particular tool or<br>
measuring and controlling member.<br>
An other embodiment of the couple limiting device provides that the relative sliding<br>
between the helical surfaces E and G of the two frontal cams, which are respectively<br>
found on the threaded body (15) and the external envelope (16), is limited to just one<br>
stroke C (Fig 16) lower than the stroke C causing their disengage and the passage of the<br>
surface G from the contact with the surface E to the contact with the surface E' after<br>
passing said stroke C. When the pre-established value of the clamping couple of the<br>
threaded body (15) on the valve end is exceeded, a direct helical movement of the<br>
external envelope (16) with respect to the threaded body (15) occurs; said movement<br>
causes a translation of the external envelope (16) with respect to the threaded body (15)<br>
for a quantity corresponding to C. When the clamping couple applied to the external<br>
envelope (16) is releases, it occurs the return of the external envelope (16) to its rest<br>
position with respect to the threaded body (15), with sufficiently low angles 6, by<br>
means of a retrograde helical motion due to the reaction of the elastic element (22).<br>
By applying the couple-limiting device, with respect to the screwing torque, as further<br>
advantage, any exceeding clamping is prevented.<br>
All the above mentioned embodiments are applied not only to the usual protection caps<br>
of the tire inflating valves, but also to the devices for controlling and/or surveying and/or<br>
signalling the functioning condition of the tires which are screwed on the external end of<br>
the inflating valve and, therefore, they protect the valve and are subject to the risk of<br>
removal for sabotage and/or theft.<br>
The mentioned technical solutions, for what concerns the control of the clamping<br>
couple, and in particular the solutions allowing (through the advise of the start of the<br>
tripping) to reach a proper and efficient clamping value and/or solutions allowing,<br>
anyway, to avoid the application of exceeding clamping couples, can be applied and<br>
used separately and/or contemporaneously by applying the anti-sabotage-anti-theft<br>
system making the manual unscrewing impossible by an unscrewing couple applied to<br>
the external envelope (16).<br>
All the above mentioned embodiments are used not only for components to be applied<br>
to the end of the tire inflating valves but in all cases of controlled clamping of threaded<br>
members in order to assure a pre-established value of the clamping couple and/or to<br>
avoid the unexpected application of clamping couples presenting a value much higher<br>
than the pre-established one and/or to prevent the unscrewing by applying an<br>
unscrewing couple to an external envelope (16), even if the screwing or unscrewing<br>
couples are applied by hand or by means of keys and/or tools which engage the external<br>
envelope (16).<br>
All the above mentioned devices, and the external envelope (16) in particular, are made<br>
of polymeric materials or metal ones, fitted with colouring due to the nature or<br>
pigmentation of the material or to coating of varnish or other substances. In addition,<br>
the external plan contour of the envelope (16) presents a circular section or any other<br>
section suitable to favour the transmission of the torque by hand or by means of keys<br>
and/or tools. In particular, said external plan contour presents protuberances or a<br>
polygonal shape.<br>
