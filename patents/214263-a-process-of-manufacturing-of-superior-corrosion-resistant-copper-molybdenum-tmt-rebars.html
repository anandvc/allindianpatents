				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing of improved<br>
corrosion resistant TMT rebars. In particular, the present invention<br>
relates to a process for manufacturing copper-molybdenum TMT rebars<br>
having improved strength and corrosion resistant properties suitable for<br>
applications in chloride containing environment.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Effect of alloying elements such chromium, copper, molybdenum,<br>
vanadium etc. are known for improving mechanical strength and<br>
corrosion properties of steel. These properties are found to vary in<br>
different processing parameters. Several processes for manufacturing of<br>
steel are known in the art where the properties of steel have been<br>
improved by varying the steel chemistry and processing parameters.<br>
TMT rebars or thermo-mechanically treated rebars are extra high strength<br>
reinforcing which eliminate any form of cold twisting. TMT rebars have<br>
wide applications in the construction sector such as general concrete<br>
reinforcement in buildings, bridges and various other concrete structures<br>
and especially high rise buildings. For its various applications, specially<br>
in chloride containing environments, it is desirable that TMT rebars have<br>
enhanced corrosion resistance along with necessary mechanical strength.<br>
It is further desired that the rim of TMT rebars have greater hardness as<br>
compared to hardness of the core. The rebars should be weldable as well.<br>
Among the known TMT rebars, copper-phosphorous TMT rebars are<br>
widely used. However, such known TMT rebars do not have the sufficient<br>
mechanical strength required for specific applications. More importantly,<br>
the corrosion properties of known copper-phosphorous TMT rebars (CRI of<br>
around 1.6) are not suitable for use in chloride containing environment in<br>
which cause quick degradation of such known TMT rebars occurs.<br>
Therefore, in view of the growing need of TMT rebars attempts have been<br>
made in the past to provide TMR rebars with improved strength and<br>
corrosion resistant properties suitable for use in chloride containing<br>
environments.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Therefore the basic object of the present invention is to provide a process for<br>
manufacture of TMT rebars having improved strength and corrosion properties<br>
by proper selection of steel chemistry and processing parameters.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacture of<br>
TMT rebars having higher hardness of rim compared to hardness of core.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to provide for a process for manufacture<br>
of TMT rebars having enhanced weldability.<br>
After extensive investigation the applicants have now found that by suitably<br>
selecting the steel chemistry, in particular use of copper and molybdenum as<br>
alloying elements and by proper selection of process parameters, TMT rebars<br>
with improved mechanical strength and corrosion resistant properties is<br>
achieved.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Therefore according to the present invention there is provided a process for the<br>
manufacture of thermo-mechanically treated (TMT) Cu-Mo rebars having<br>
improved mechanical and corrosion properties comprising:<br>
(i) providing steel ingots having composition comprising 0.14 to<br>
0.18 wt% carbon, 1.0 to 1.2 wt% manganese, 0.2 to 0.3 wt%<br>
silicon, up to 0.03 wt% sulphur, up to 0.03 wt% phosphorous, 0.3<br>
to 0.4 wt% copper and 0.15 to 0.2 wt% molybdenum, the<br>
balance being iron;<br>
(ii) soaking said steel ingots and processing to billets;<br>
(iii) cooling the surface of said billets in Thermix Unit with water<br>
pressure between 15 to 22 kg/mm2 and equalization temperature<br>
between 600 to 680°C; and<br>
(iv) finish rolling said surface cooled steel bars between 950 to<br>
1060°C.<br>
Detailed description of the Invention<br>
The alloying elements, in particular copper and molybdenum, are found to reduce<br>
corrosion particularly the effect of chloride ions in chloride containing<br>
environment. The alloying elements are found to form a layer on the surface of<br>
the rebars and develop resistance to the diffusion of chloride ions to steel<br>
surface, thus preventing the interaction between corrosive media and steel<br>
surface. These also improve the corrosion resistance under non-stress and<br>
stress conditions. In addition, Molybdenum induces resistance to chloride ions.<br>
Molybdenum also improves stress corrosion properties.<br>
Following the process of the present invention improved TMT rebars are<br>
manufactured by selecting alloy chemistry formulation and adjustment of finishing<br>
rolling temperature, water pressure and equalization temperature in the TMT line.<br>
The steel ingots are prepared by conventional methods such as melting of steel<br>
in a furnace and tapping it in a preheated ladle at around 1600 to 1650°C,<br>
preferably between 1620 to 1640°C. The required quantity of preheated<br>
ferroalloys and copper cathode plate are kept in the ladle prior to tapping of steel<br>
to meet the aimed chemistry. The liquid steel is preferably homogenized with<br>
purging of argon and cast as ingots.<br>
The ingots are soaked at temperature between 1250 to 1350°C for around for six<br>
hours and are processed to form billets. The billets are then surface cooled<br>
in Thermix unit preferably consisting of four tubes through which<br>
pressurized water is circulated to cool the surface of bars to<br>
lower temperature for specific metallurgical changes. The finishing<br>
rolling temperature is between 950 to 1060°C. The water pressure selected<br>
between 15 to 22 kg/mm2 for 22-40 mm diameter bars. The equalization<br>
temperature is selected between 600 to 680°C.<br>
Several tests were conducted to assess different properties of the copper-<br>
molybdenum TMT rebars of the present invention. The result revealed<br>
improved mechanical properties over conventional copper-phosphorous<br>
TMT rebars. The hardness of core and rim of the copper- molybdenum<br>
TMT rebars were also found to be higher as compared to the known<br>
phosphorus TMT rebars. Improved corrosion properties and good<br>
weldability were also revealed by the tests.<br>
The present invention will now be described with reference to non-limiting<br>
examples and following figures in which :<br>
Fig. 1 shows the flow chart of the process of the present invention ;<br>
Fig. 2 shows optical microstructure of 16mm diameter Cu-Mo TMT Bar<br>
and reveals the presence of tempered martensite at rim and ferrite/bainite<br>
at core.<br>

manganese, 0.21 wt% silicon, 0.03 wt% sulphur, 0.024 wt%<br>
phosphorous, 0.3 wt% copper and 0.17 wt% molybdenum, the balance<br>
being iron were prepared by melting of steel in a furnace and tapping it in<br>
a preheated ladle at 1630ºC. The required quantity of preheated<br>
ferroalloys and copper cathode plate were kept in the ladle prior to<br>
tapping of steel to meet the aimed chemistry. The Liquid steel was<br>
homogenized with purging of argon and cast as ingots of weight 9 tones<br>
each or continuously cast as 100 x 100 mm billets. The ingots were<br>
soaked at 1300°C Tor six hours and then processed to form billets. The<br>
billets were then surface cooled in Thermix unit consisting of four tubes<br>
through which pressurized water is circulated to cool the surface of bars<br>
to lower temperature for specific metallurgical changes. The finishing<br>
rolling temperature was maintained at 1000°C. The water pressure was<br>
maintained at 15 w 22 kg/mm2 for 22-40 mm diameter bars, the<br>
equalization temperature being 650°C.<br>
Example 2 - Manufacture of TMT rebars of 32 mm diameter<br>
