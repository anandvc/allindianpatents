COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"PIPERIDINE-AND PIPERAZINE SUBSTITUTED N-HYDROXYFORMAMIDES AS INHIBITORS OF METALLOPROTEINASES"<br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to compounds useful in the inhibition of metalloproteinases and in particular to pharmaceutical compositions comprising these, as well as their use.<br>
The compounds of this invention are inhibitors of one or more metalloproteinase enzymes. Metalloproteinases are a superfamily of proteinases (enzymes) whose numbers in recent years have increased dramatically. Based on structural and functional considerations these enzymes have been classified into families and subfamilies as described in N.M. Hooper (1994) FEBS Letters 354:1-6. Examples of metalloproteinases include the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) such as the collagenases (MMP1, MMP8, MMP13), the gelatinases (MMP2, MMP9), the stromelysins (MMP3, MMP10, MMP11), matrilysin (MMP7), metalloelastase (MMP 12), enamelysin (MMP 19), the MT-MMPs (MMP 14, MMP 15, MMP 16, MMP 17); the reprolysin or adamalysin or MDC family which includes the secretases and sheddases such as TNF converting enzymes (ADAM 10 and TACE); the astacin family which include enzymes such as procollagen processing proteinase (PCP); and other metalloproteinases such as aggrecanase, the endothelin converting enzyme family and the angiotensin converting enzyme family.<br>
Metalloproteinases are believed to be important in a plethora of physiological disease processes that involve tissue remodelling such as embryonic development, bone formation and uterine remodelling during menstruation. This is based on the ability of the metalloproteinases to cleave a broad range of matrix substrates such as collagen, proteoglycan and fibronectin. Metalloproteinases are also believed to be important in the processing, or secretion, of biological important cell mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF); and the post translational proteolysis processing, or shedding, of biologically important membrane proteins, such as the low affinity IgE receptor CD23 (for a more complete list see N. M. Hooper et al.t (1997) Biochem J. 321:265-279).<br>
Metalloproteinases have been associated with many disease conditions. Inhibition of the activity of one or more metalloproteinases may well be of benefit in these disease<br><br><br>

PCT/GB0l/00624<br><br>
conditions, for example: various inflammatory and allergic diseases such as. inflammation of the joint (especially rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and gout), inflammation of the gastro-intestinal tract (especially inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and gastritis), inflammation of the skin (especially psoriasis, eczema, dermatitis); in tumour metastasis or invasion; in disease associated with uncontrolled degradation of the extracellular matrix such as osteoarthritis; in bone resorptive disease (such as osteoporosis and Paget's disease); in diseases associated with aberrant angiogenesis; the enhanced collagen remodelling ass;dated with diabetes, periodontal disease (such as gingivitis), corneal ulceration, ulceration of the skin, post-operative conditions (such as colonic anastomosis) and dermal wound healing; demyelinating diseases of the central and peripheral nervous systems (such as multiple sclerosis); Alzheimer's disease; extracellular matrix remodelling observed in cardiovascular diseases such as restenosis and atheroscelerosis; and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, COPD (for example, the role of MMPs such as MMP12 is discussed in Anderson &amp; Shinagawa, 1999, Current Opinion in Anti-inflammatory and Immunomodulatory Investigational Drugs, 1(1): 29-38).<br>
A number of metalloproteinase inhibitors are known; different classes of compounds may have different degrees of potency and selectivity for inhibiting various metalloproteinases. We have discovered a new class of compounds that are inhibitors of metalloproteinases~and"are"of particular interest in hibiting MMP-13, as well as MMP-9 The compounds of this invention have beneficial potency and/or pharmacokinetic properties.<br>
MMP13, or collagenase 3, was initially cloned from a cDNA library derived from a breast tumour [J. M. P. Freije et al. (1994) Journal of Biological Chemistry 269(24): 16766-16773]. PCR-RNA analysis of RNAs from a wide range of tissues indicated that MMP13 expression was limited to breast carcinomas as it was not found in breast fibroadenomas, normal or resting mammary gland, placenta, liver, ovary, uterus, prostate or parotid gland or in breast cancer cell lines (T47-D, MCF-7 and ZR75-1). Subsequent to this observation MMP13 has been detected in transformed epidermal keratinocytes [N. Johansson et al., (1997) Cell Growth Differ. 8(2):243-250], squamous cell carcinomas [N. Johansson et al,<br><br><br>
WO 01/62742<br><br>
PCT/GB01/00624<br><br>
(1997) Am. J. Pathol. 151(2):499-508] and epidermal tumours [K. Airola et al, (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(2):225-231]. These results are suggestive that MMP13 is secreted by transformed epithelial cells and may be involved in the extracellular matrix degradation and cell-matrix interaction associated with metastasis especially as observed in invasive breast cancer lesions and in malignant epithelia growth in skin carcinogenesis.<br>
Recent published data implies that MMP13 plays a role in the turnover of other connective tissues. For instance, consistent with MMP13 s substrate specificity and preference for degrading type II collagen [P. G. Mitchell et al, (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; V. Knauper et al, (1996) The Biochemical Journal 271:1544-1550], MMP 13 has been hypothesised to serve a role during primary ossification and skeletal remodelling [M. Stahle-Backdahl et al, (1997) Lab. Invest. 76(5):717-728; N. Johansson et al, (1997) Dev. Dyn. 208(3):387-397], in destructive joint diseases such as rheumatoid and osteo-arthritis [D. Wernicke et al., (1996) J. Rheumatol. 23:590-595; P. G. Mitchell et al, (1996) J. Clin. Invest. 97(3):761-768; O. Lindy et al, (1997) Arthritis Rheum 40(8): 1391-1399]; and during the aseptic loosening of hip replacements [S. Imai et al, (1998) J. Bone Joint Surg. Br. 80(4):701-710]. MMP13 has also been implicated in chronic adult periodontitis as it has been localised to the epithelium of chronically inflamed mucosa human gingival tissue [V. J. Uitto et al, (1998) Am. J. Pathol 152(6):1489-1499]and in remodelling of the collagenous matrix in chronic wounds [M. Vaalamo et al, (1997) J. Invest. Dermatol. 109(1):96-101].<br>
MMP9 (Gelatinase B; 92kDa Type lV Collagenase; 92kDa Gelatinase) is a secreted protein which was first purified, then cloned and sequenced, in 1989 (S.M. Wilhelm et al (1989) J. Biol Chem. 264 (29): 17213-17221. Published erratum in J. Biol Chem. (1990) 265 (36): 22570.).  A recent review of MMP9 provides an excellent source for detailed information and references on this protease : T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998) (In : Matrix Metalloproteinases. 1998. Edited by W.C. Parks &amp; R.P. Mecham. ppl 15 -148. Academic Press.. ISBN 0-12-545090-7). The following points are drawn from that review by T.H. Vu &amp; Z. Werb (1998).<br><br><br>
'   WO 01/62742	PCT/GB01/00624<br>
The expression of MMP9 is restricted normally to a few cell types, including trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils and macrophages. However, it's expression can be induced in these same cells and in other cell types by several mediators, including exposure of the cells to growth factors or cytokines. These are the same mediators often implicated in initiating an inflammatory response. As with other secreted MMPs, MMP9 is released as an inactive Pro-enzyme which is subsequently cleaved to form the enzymatically active enzyme. The proteases required for this activation in vivo are not known. The balance of active MMP9 versus inactive enzyme is further regulated in vivo by interaction with TIMP-1 (Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases -1), a naturally-occurring protein. TIMP-1 binds to the C-terminal region of MMP9, leading to inhibition of the catalytic domain of MMP9. The balance of induced expression of ProMMP9, cleavage of . Pro- to active MMP9 and the presence of TIMP-1 combine to determine the amount of catalytically active MMP9 which is present at a local site. Proteolytically active MMP9 attacks substrates which include gelatin, elastin, and native Type IV and Type V coUagens; it has no activity against native Type I collagen, proteoglycans or laminins.<br>
There has been a growing body of data implicating roles for MMP9 in various physiological and pathological processes. Physiological roles include the invasion of embryonic trophoblasts through the uterine epithelium in the early stages of embryonic -implantation-some-role-inthe-growthand -development of b.ones; and migration of inflammatory cells from the vasculature into tissues. Increased MMP9 expression has observed in certain pathological conditions, thereby implicating MMP9 in disease processed such as arthritis, tumour metastasis, Alzheimer's, Multiple Sclerosis, and plaque rupture in atherosclerosis leading to acute coronary conditions such as Myocardial Infarction.<br>

It will be appreciated that the particular substituents and number of substituents on B and/or Rl are selected so as to avoid sterically undesirable combinations.<br>
Each exemplified compound represents a particular and independent aspect of the invention.<br>
Where optically active centres exist in the compounds of formula I, we disclose all individual optically active forms and combinations of these as individual specific embodiments of the invention, as well as their corresponding racemates. Racemates may be separated into individual optically active forms using known procedures (cf. Advanced Organic Chemistry: 3rd Edition: author J March, p104-107) including for example the formation of diastereomeric derivatives having convenient optically active auxiliary species followed by separation and then cleavage of the auxiliary species.<br>
It will be appreciated that the compounds according to the invention can contain one or more asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms. The presence of one or more of these asymmetric centres (chiral centres) in a compound of formula I can give rise to stereoisomers, and in each case the invention is to be understood to extend to all such stereoisomers, including enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures including racemic mixtures thereof.<br>
In the examples we disclose the isolation and characterisation of certain enantiomers. Enantiomers may be prepared by the reaction of racemic material with a chiral auxilliary, separation of the diastereomers formed using chromatography, followed by subsequent cleavage of the chiral auxilliary. The diastereomer eluted second from the column (using conditions herein described) and subsequently cleaved gives the more active enantiomer when tested. In each case we believe the active enantiomer has S stereochemistry but do not wish to be limited by this initial determination. The active enantiomer is characterised by its derivative being eluted second from the separation column. Use of different compounds of formula I, alternative columns and/or different solvents may affect the elution order of the most active enantiomer.<br>
In the examples we disclose the isolation and characterisation of certain diastereomers. Chromatographic separation and subsequent testing revealed that the more active<br>
-8-<br><br>
WO 01/62742	PCT/GB01/00624<br>
diastereomr is eluted first from the separation column (ie the more active diastereomer is characterised by being eluted first from the separation column). Use of different compounds of formula I, alternative columns and/or different solvents may affect the elution order of the most active diastereomer.<br>
For compounds of formula I with two chiral centres we believe the active enantiomer has S,S stereochemistry but do not wish to be limited by this initial determination.<br>
Where tautomers exist in the compounds of formula I, we disclose all individual tautomeric forms and combinations of these as individual specific embodiments of the invention.<br>
As previously outlined the compounds of the invention are metalloproteinase inhibitors, in particular they are inhibitors of MMP13. Each of the above indications for the compounds of the formula I represents, an independent and particular embodiment of the invention. Whilst we do not wish to be bound by theoretical considerations, the compounds of the invention are believed to show selective inhibition for any one of the  . above indications relative to any MMP1 inhibitory activity, by way. of non-limiting example they may show 100-1000 fold selectivity over any MMP1 inhibitory activity.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention are of particular use as aggrecanase inhibitors ie. inhibitors of aggrecan degradation. Certain compounds of the invention are of particular<br>
use-as-inhibitors of MMP9 and/or MMP12.	<br>
The compounds of the invention may be provided as pharmaceutically acceptable salts. These include acid addition salts such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, citrate and maleate salts and salts formed with phosphoric and sulphuric acid. In another aspect suitable salts are base salts such as an alkali metal salt for example sodium or potassium, an alkaline earth metal salt for example calcium or magnesium, or organic amine salt for example triethylamine.<br>
They may also be provided as in vivo hydrolysable esters. These are pharmaceutically acceptable esters that hydrolyse in the human body to produce the parent compound. Such esters can be identified by administering, for example intravenously to a test animal, the compound under test and subsequently examining the test animal's body fluids. Suitable<br><br><br>

The purified enzyme can be used to monitor inhibitors of activity as follows: purified proMMP13 is activated using 1mM amino phenyl mercuric acid (APMA), 20 hours at 21°C; the activated MMP 13 (11.25ng per assay) is incubated for 4-5 hours at 35°C in . assay buffer (O.IM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 containing 0.1M NaCl, 20mM CaC12, 0.02 mM ZnCl and 0.05% (w/v) Brij 35 using the synthetic substrate 7-methoxycoumarin-4-yl)acetyl.Pro.Leu.Gly.Leu.N-3-(2,4-dinitrophenyl)-L-2,3-diarriinopropionyl.Ala.Arg.NH2 in the presence or absence of inhibitors. Activity is determined by measuring the fluorescence at λex 328nm and λem 393nm. Percent inhibition is calculated as follows: % Inhibition is equal to the [Fluorescenceplus inhibitor - Fluorescencebackground] divided by the [Fluorescenceminus inhibitor - Fluorescencebackground].<br>
A similar protocolcan be used for other expressed and purified pro MMPs using substrates and buffers conditions optimal for the particular MMP, for instance as described in C. Graham Knight et al, (1992) FEBS Lett. 296(3):263-266.<br>
Adamalysin family including for example TNF convertase<br>
The ability of the compounds to inhibit proTNFa convertase enzyme may be assessed using a partially purified, isolated enzyme assay, the enzyme being obtained from the membranes of THP-1 as described by K. M. Mohler et al.; (1994) Nature 370:218-220. The purified enzyme activity and inhibition thereof is determined by incubating the partially purified enzyme in the presence or absence of test compounds using the substrate<br><br><br>

4',5'-Dimethoxy-fluoresceinyl Ser.Pro.Leu.Ala.Gln.Ala.Val.Arg.Ser.Ser.Ser.Arg.Cys(4-(3-succinimid-l-yl)-fiuorescein)-NH2 in assay buffer (50mM Tris HCI, pH 7.4 containing 0.1 % (w/v) Triton X-100 and 2mM CaCl2), at 26°C for 18 hours. The amount of inhibition is determined as for MMP13 except Xex 490nm and Xem 530nm were used. The substrate was synthesised as follows. The peptidic part of the substrate was assembled on Fmoc-NH-Rink-MBHA-polystyrene resin either manually or on an automated peptide synthesiser by standard methods involving the use of Fmoc-amino acids and O-benzotriazol-1-yl-N,N,N',N'-terramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU) as coupling agent with at least a 4- or 5-fold excess of Fmoc-amino acid and HBTU. Ser1 and Pro2 were double-coupled. The following side chain protection strategy was employed; Ser1 (But), Gln5(Trityl), Arg8,12(Pmc or Pbf), Ser9-lcul(Trityl), Cys13(Trityl). Following assembly, the N-terminal Fmoc-protecting group was removed by treating the Fmoc-peptidyl-resin with in .DMF. The amino-peptidyl-resin so obtained was acylated by treatment for 1.5-2hr at 70°C with 1.5-2 equivalents of 4',5'-dimethoxy-fluorescein-4(5)-carboxylic acid [Khanna &amp; Ullman, (1980) Anal Biochem. 108:156-161) which had been preactivated with diisopropylcarbodiimide and 1-hydroxybenzotriazole in DMF]. The dimethoxyfiuoresceinyl-peptide was then simultaneously deprotected and cleaved from the resin by treatment widi trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% each of water and triethylsilane. The dimemoxyfjuoresceinyl-peptide was isolated by evaporation, trituration with diethyl ether and filtration. The isolated peptide was reacted with 4-(N-maleimido)-fluorescein in DMF containing diisopropylethylamine, the product purified by RP-HPLC and finally isolated by freeze-drying from aqueous acetic acid. The product was characterised by MALDI-TOF MS and amino acid analysis.<br>

Test as an agent to inhibit whole blood TNF sheddase activity<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit TNFa production is assessed in a human whole blood assay where LPS is used to stimulate the release of TNFa. Heparinized (l0Units/ml) human blood obtained from volunteers is diluted 1:5 with medium (RPMII640 + bicarbonate, penicillin, streptomycin and glutamine) and incubated (160ul) with 20ul of test compound (triplicates), in DMSO or appropriate vehicle, for 30 min at 37°C in a humidified (5%C02/95%air) incubator, prior to addition of 20µl LPS (E. coli. 0111 :B4; final concentration 10µg/ml). Each assay includes controls of diluted blood incubated with medium alone (6 wells/plate) or a known TNFa inhibitor as standard. The plates are then incubated for 6 hours at 37°C (humidified incubator), centrifuged (2000rpm for 10 min; 4°C), plasma harvested (50-l00µl) and stored in 96 well plates at -70°C before subsequent analysis for TNFa concentration by ELISA.<br><br><br>

Pharmacodynamic test<br>
To evaluate the clearance properties and bioavailability of the compounds of this invention an ex vivo pharmacodynamic test is employed which utilises the synthetic substrate assays above or alternatively HPLC or Mass spectrometric analysis. This is a generic test which can be used to estimate the clearance rate of compounds across a range of species. Animals (e,g. rats, marmosets) are dosed iv or po with a soluble formulation of compound (such as 20% w/v DMSO, 60% w/v PEG400) and at subsequent time points (e.g. 5, 15, 30, 60, 120,240, 480, 720, 1220 mins) the blood samples are taken from an appropriate vessel into 10U heparin. Plasma fractions are obtained following centrifugation and the plasma proteins precipitated with acetonitrile (80% w/v final concentration). After 30 mins at -20°C the plasma proteins are sedimented by centrifugation and the supernatant fraction is evaporated to dryness using a Savant speed vac. The sediment is reconstituted in assay buffer and subsequently analysed for compound content using the synthetic substrate assay. Briefly, a compound concentration-response curve is constructed for the compound —-undergoing evaluation. Serial dilutions of the reconstituted plasma extracts are asessed for activity and the amount of compound present in the original plasma sample is calculated using the concentration-response curve taking into account the total plasma dilution factor.<br>

Test as an anti-TNF agent<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention as ex vivo TNFα inhibitors is assessed in the rat. Briefly, groups of male Wistar Alderley Park (AP) rats (180-210g) are dosed with compound (6 rats) or drug vehicle (10 rats) by the appropriate route e.g. peroral (p.o.), intraperitoneal (i.p.)j subcutaneous (s.c). Ninety minutes later rats are sacrificed using a rising concentration of CO2 and bled out via the posterior vena cavae into 5 Units<br><br><br>

of sodium heparin/ml blood. Blood samples are immediately placed on ice and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C and the harvested plasmas frozen at -20°C for subsequent assay of their effect on TNFα production by LPS-stimulated human blood. The rat plasma samples are thawed and 175µl of each sample are added to a set format pattern in a 96U well plate. Fifty ul of heparinized human blood is then added to each well, mixed and the plate is incubated for 30 min at 37°C (humidified incubator). LPS (25 µl final concentration 10p.g/ml) is added to the wells and incubation continued for a further 5.5 hours. Control wells are incubated with 25µl of medium alone. Plates are then centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm and 200µl of the supematants are transferred to a 96 well plate and frozen at -20° C for subsequent analysis of TNF concentration by ELISA.<br>
