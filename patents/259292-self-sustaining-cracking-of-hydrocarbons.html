SELF-SUSTAINING<br>
CRACKING OF HYDROCARBONS<br>
Inventors: Yuriy A. Zaikin and Raissa F. Zaikina<br>
The present application claims priority to and the benefit of US Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 60/751,352, filed December 16,2005.<br>
FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE<br>
The present disclosure relates generally to the field of petroleum processing. More<br>
specifically, the present disclosure relates to novel method for self-sustained cracking of<br>
petroleum feedstocks to produce commodity petroleum products.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The petroleum refining industry has long been faced with the need to increase the<br>
efficiency of the production of commodity petroleum products from petroleum feedstock. In<br>
addition, the demand for particular commodity petroleum products has also increased.<br>
Furthermore, the quality of the commodity petroleum products produced has also been subject to<br>
increasing demands of stability and purity. For example, while many prior art processes have<br>
been described that produce commodity petroleum products with shorter hydrocarbon chain<br>
lengths from petroleum feedstocks containing higher hydrocarbon chain length precursors, the<br>
resulting commodity petroleum products are often unstable due to chemical species produced<br>
during the conversion process (such as but not limited to high olefinic content) or possess<br>
undesirable characteristics from a performance perspective (such as, but not limited to, low octane<br>
ratings) or an environmental perspective (such as, but not limited to, high sulfur content).<br>
In addition, the petroleum industry is faced with the prospect of using multiple sources of<br>
petroleum feedstock that vary significantly in chemical content. In order to cope with the<br>
changing composition of the petroleum feedstock, methods must be developed that are flexible<br>
enough to be used with a variety of petroleum feedstocks without substantial alterations of the<br>
method. Such flexibility would expand the natural resources (i.e., petroleum feedstocks) available<br>
for the production of commodity petroleum products and further enhance the efficiency of<br>
production of commodity petroleum products.<br>
In addition to being flexible enough to accommodate a variety of petroleum feedstocks as<br>
a starting material, production efficiency could be enhanced by a method flexible enough to<br>
produce a commodity petroleum product with a desired set of properties, such as but not limited<br>
to, a desired hydrocarbon chain length, from a given petroleum feedstock. For example,<br>
economic conditions or supply and demand in the marketplace may dictate that a lubricant with a<br><br>
higher hydrocarbon chain length than gasoline is a preferred commodity petroleum product for a<br>
period of time. Therefore, a method flexible enough to produce a variety of commodity<br>
petroleum products from a petroleum feedstock would be an advantage in meeting the demands of<br>
a changing marketplace and would further maximize the value of the commodity petroleum<br>
products.<br>
Crude oil can be effectively used as an example. Crude oil is a complex mixture that is<br>
between 50% and 95% hydrocarbon by weight (depending on the source of the crude oil).<br>
Generally, the first step in refining crude oil involves separating the crude oil into different<br>
hydrocarbon fractions, such as by distillation. A typical set of hydrocarbon fractions is given in<br>
Table 1. An analysis of Table 1 shows that gasoline has a hydrocarbon chain length of 5-12<br>
carbon atoms and natural gas has a hydrocarbon chain length of 1-4 carbons while lubricants have<br>
a hydrocarbon chain length of 20 carbons and above and fuel oils have a hydrocarbon chain length<br>
of 14 and above. In order to maximize the value of a single barrel of crude oil, it would be<br>
advantageous to develop a process to convert the petroleum feedstock with longer hydrocarbon<br>
chain lengths into a desired commodity petroleum product with shorter hydrocarbon chain<br>
lengths, thereby maximizing the potential use and value for each barrel of crude oil. While<br>
commodity products with hydrocarbon chain lengths of 15 or less are generally desirable and<br>
more valuable, conditions in the marketplace may make the production of other commodity<br>
products more desirable.<br>
In addition, certain types of petroleum feedstocks are not suitable for use as starting<br>
materials in petroleum refining operations. For example, bitumen is a complex mixture of<br>
hydrocarbon molecules that generally has a viscosity too great for use in standard petroleum<br>
refining techniques. Bitumen includes what are commonly referred to as tar and asphaltic<br>
components. However, if bitumen and other similar petroleum feedstocks could be treated to<br>
reduce the higher molecular mass components, they would become useful in petroleum refining<br>
operations and could yield a number of commodity petroleum products. Such a process is<br>
referred to as "petroleum upgrading". Therefore, it would be advantageous to develop a process<br>
to convert such complex hydrocarbon feedstocks to petroleum feedstocks and/or commodity<br>
petroleum products capable of further refining.<br>
One important consideration for any method of processing petroleum feedstock to produce<br>
commodity petroleum products is the economic aspect. Current technologies exist that allow the<br>
processing of petroleum feedstocks with high hydrocarbon chain lengths into commodity<br>
petroleum products with shorter hydrocarbon chain lengths. However, many of these methods<br>
require substantial amounts of energy to be input into the system making them a less desirable<br>
alternative. In addition, many of the prior art processes are multi-stage processes requiring<br><br>
multiple steps and or multiple plants or facilities for the initial and subsequent processing. For<br>
example, a given process may require three steps to produce gasoline from a given petroleum<br>
feedstock and then require additional processes to remove contaminants from the produced<br>
gasoline or to enhance the performance characteristics of the gasoline. A one-step method of<br>
producing desired commodity petroleum products from a given petroleum.feedstock would be of<br>
substantial value to the petroleum industry.<br>
In order to achieve the above stated objectives, the prior art has utilized a variety of<br>
hydrocarbon cracking reactions to reduce the hydrocarbon chain length of various petroleum<br>
feedstocks. The main problem to be solved for effective processing of any type of petroleum<br>
feedstock via a cracking reaction is a problem of the control of the cracking reaction in conditions<br>
that provide combination of high processing rate and high conversion efficiency with a maximum<br>
simplicity, reduced capital expenditures for plant construction, maintenance and operation and<br>
economic efficiency at minimum energy expense.<br>
As discussed above, only methods that allow the efficient propagation of hydrocarbon<br>
chain cracking reactions can provide the high processing rates necessary for industrial and<br>
commercial use. Furthermore, in one particular embodiment, such methods should utilize low<br>
pressures and temperatures during all phases of the cracking reaction in order to minimize<br>
operational costs and increase safety. Realization of such methods requires that the problems of<br>
cracking initiation and stimulation of chain cracking propagation at lowered temperatures be<br>
solved.<br>
The present disclosure provides such a solution by providing a simple and efficient method<br>
for the self-sustaining radiation cracking of hydrocarbons. The method disclosed provides for the<br>
deep destructive processing of hydrocarbon chains utilizing hydrocarbon chain decomposition<br>
under a wide variety of irradiation conditions and temperature ranges (from room temperature to<br>
450° C). Several embodiments of such method are disclosed herein, including; (i) a special case<br>
of radiation-thermal cracking referred to as high-temperature radiation cracking (HTRC); (ii) low<br>
temperature radiation cracking (LTRC); and (iii) cold radiation cracking (CRC). The<br>
technological results of this disclosure include, but are not limited to: (i) the expansion of the<br>
sources of petroleum feedstocks for the production of commodity petroleum products; (ii)<br>
increasing the degree of petroleum feedstock conversion into usable commodity petroleum<br>
products; (iii) maximizing the yields of a variety of commodity petroleum products from<br>
petroleum feedstocks; (iv) upgrading the quality of various petroleum feedstocks; (v) and<br>
increasing the quality commodity petroleum products by minimizing undesirable contaminants<br>
(such as but not limited to sulfur) that may be present in the commodity petroleum products as a<br>
result of unwanted chemical reactions; (vi) increasing the stability of the commodity petroleum<br><br>
products produced by minimizing or preventing undesirable chemical reactions; (vii) providing a<br>
method flexible enough to produce a variety of commodity petroleum products from a given<br>
petroleum feedstock. The methods of the present disclosure provide these, and other benefits<br>
while reducing the energy required, simplifying the physical plant required to implement the<br>
methods and reducing the number of steps involved in the process as compared to prior art<br>
methods.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Definitions<br>
As used herein the following terms have the meanings set forth below.<br>
"Petroleum feedstock" refers to any hydrocarbon based petroleum starting material,<br>
including, but not limited to, crude oil of any density and viscosity, high-viscous heavy crude oil,<br>
high-paraffin crude oil, fuel oil, tar, heavy residua of oil processing, wastes of oil extraction,<br>

"Treated petroleum feedstock" refers to a petroleum feedstock treated by HTRC, LTRC or<br>
CRC, wherein the petroleum feedstock so treated has an altered average hydrocarbon chain length<br>
of the hydrocarbon chains, an altered fractional composition and/or an altered chemical<br>
composition as compared to the untreated petroleum feedstock, said alteration occurring through<br>
one or more reactions including, but not limited to, hydrocarbon chain decomposition,<br>
polymerization, polycondensation, isomerization, oxidation, reduction and chemisorption; a<br>
treated petroleum feedstock may be used directly as a commodity petroleum product, as a starting<br>
material to generate commodity petroleum products, as a petroleum feedstock or as an upgraded<br>
petroleum feedstock.<br>
"Commodity petroleum product" refers to a product for use derived, directly or indirectly,<br>
from a treated petroleum feedstock, from a petroleum feedstock treated by HTRC, LTRC or CRC<br>
or from an upgraded petroleum feedstock.<br>
"Hydrocarbon molecule" refers to any chemical species in a petroleum feedstock<br>
containing carbon and hydrogen and capable of being altered by HTRC, LTRC or CRC treatment;<br>
exemplary chemical species include linear molecule composed of hydrogen and carbon, ring<br>
structures composed of hydrogen and carbon-and combinations of the foregoing, as well as more<br>
complex chemical species composed of hydrogen and carbon.<br>
"High-temperature radiation cracking" or "HTRC" refers to a process for the treatment of<br>
a petroleum feedstock, where said treatment is accomplished by feedstock irradiation at<br>
temperatures greater or equal to about 350° C but less man or equal to about 450° C and a time-<br>
averaged irradiation dose rate of about 5 kGy/s or higher resulting in a total absorbed dose of<br>

irradiation as defined by the stability of the a treated petroleum feedstock and/or petroleum<br>
commodity products derived from the petroleum feedstock given the particular HTRC processing<br>
parameters and petroleum feedstock, said irradiation generating a self-sustaining chain reaction<br><br>
between chain carriers and excited molecules. HTRC shall be understood not to include reactions<br>
of hydrocarbon molecule decomposition that are not self-sustaining, such as, but not limited to,<br>
radiolysis and mechanical processing. However, HTRC can be accompanied by other non-<br>

General<br>
The present disclosure provides a simple and efficient method for the self-sustaining<br>
radiation cracking of hydrocarbons. The method disclosed provides for the deep destructive<br>
processing of hydrocarbon molecules utilizing hydrocarbon molecule decomposition utilizing<br>
self-sustaining radiation cracking of hydrocarbon molecules under a wide variety of irradiation<br>
conditions and temperature ranges (from room temperature to 400° C). Several embodiments of<br>
such method are disclosed herein, including; (i) a special case of radiation-thermal cracking<br>
referred to as high-temperature radiation cracking (HTRC); (ii) low temperature radiation<br>
cracking (LTRC); and (iii) cold radiation cracking (CRC). Such methods were not heretofore<br>
appreciated in the art. In one embodiment, a petroleum feedstock is subjected to irradiation to<br>
initiate and/or at least partially propagate a chain reaction between components of the petroleum<br>
feedstock. In one embodiment, the treatment results in hydrocarbon molecule decomposition;<br>
however, other chemical reactions as described herein may also occur.<br>
The methods are carried out in a suitable reactor at the desired temperature, a desired dose<br>
of radiation and a desired dose rate of radiation using a desired petroleum feedstock. The<br>
parameters of temperature, dose and dose rate may be easily varied by the user as well as the<br>
nature of the petroleum feedstock. Furthermore, reaction may be varied by the addition of one or<br>
more agents to the petroleum feedstock and/or by additional processing of the petroleum<br>
feedstock. The petroleum feedstock may be subject to such agents and additional processing<br>
either prior to processing as described herein and/or during such processing. In one embodiment,<br>
the agent is ionized air, steam, ozone, oxygen, hydrogen, methanol, and methane; the above list is<br>
not inclusive and other gases, vapors and liquids may be used as agents in the present disclosure.<br>
In one embodiment, the additional processing may involve subjecting the petroleum feedstock to<br>
thermal, mechanical, acoustic or electromagnetic processing. By varying the temperature, dose,<br><br>
dose rate, petroleum feedstock, the agent and/or additional feedstock processing, the rate and yield<br>
of the radiation cracking chain reaction, as well as the production of desired commodity<br>
petroleum products, the final viscosity of the treated petroleum feedstock, the degree of<br>
conversion of the petroleum feedstock and the stimulation of alternate chemical reactions (such as<br>
but not limited to polymerization, polycondensation, isomerization, oxidation, reduction, and<br>
chemisorption) may be controlled by the user.<br>
In one embodiment, the method proceeds, at least in part, by a chain reaction which results<br>
in hydrocarbon molecule decomposition; the method may also involve other chemical processes<br>
such as, but not limited to, polymerization, polycondensation, isomerization, oxidation, reduction<br>
and chemisorption. Such alternative chemical processes may impart useful properties to the<br>
treated petroleum feedstock.<br>
The radiation source generates particles having a predetermined average energy and<br>
energy distribution. The petroleum feedstock is exposed to a sufficient particle current density of<br>
said particles such that the rate of energy absorbed per unit of petroleum feedstock mass is<br>
sufficient for initiation and/or propagation of HTRC, LTRC or CRC and energy absorbed per unit<br>
of petroleum feedstock mass is sufficient for the required degree of conversion to desired<br>
commodity petroleum products and/or to impart desired characteristics to the treated petroleum<br>
feedstock. In one embodiment, the dose and/or dose rate is determined based on the<br>
characteristics of the pulsed or continuous irradiation, the degree of treatment required, the final<br>
viscosity of the treated petroleum feedstock and/or the type of commodity petroleum product<br>
desired.<br>
Petroleum feedstock may be irradiated- in either in a continuous or pulsed mode. In one<br>
embodiment, the radiation source is an electron accelerator producing an electron beam<br>
comprising electrons having of energy in the range of about 1 to about 10 MeV and the petroleum<br>
feedstock is exposed to a sufficient electron beam current density such that the time averaged dose<br>
rate is about 5 kGy/s or greater. The method proceeds from about atmospheric pressure to 3<br>
atmospheres, although higher or lower pressures may be used as desired it being understood that<br>
higher and lower pressures will increase the complexity of the physical processing plant and the<br>
energy costs involved. As a result of HTRC, LTRC or CRC, the petroleum feedstock is converted<br>
to a treated petroleum feedstock having one ore more desired properties or a desired set of<br>
commodity petroleum products. The treated petroleum feedstock can be further processed to<br>
separate and/or isolate various fractions. Such fractions may be used directly as commodity<br>
products or used in further purification or processing reactions. Alternatively, the treated<br>
petroleum feedstock may be transported, due to its improved characteristics, by means known in<br><br>
the art for further processing, using methods known in the prior art or the methods disclosed<br>
herein<br>
The methods disclosed herein combine unique combinations of temperature, absorbed<br>
dose of radiation, and dose rate of irradiation in order to initiate and/or maintain the described<br>
chain reactions. HTRC, LTRC and CRC are high-rate chain reactions that are suitable for<br>
industrial scale use. In one embodiment, HTRC, LTRC and CRC induce the hydrocarbon<br>
molecule decomposition. The hydrocarbon molecule decomposition can also be accompanied by<br>
alternate chemical reactions as discussed herein. Furthermore, HTRC, LTRC and CRC are<br>
effective with a wide range of petroleum feedstocks, including but not limited to, high-viscous<br>
crude oil, bitumen and high-paraffinic oil. Therefore, HTRC, LTRC and CRC methods may be<br>
used in a variety of industrial settings with a wide variety of petroleum feedstocks.<br>
Several methods of radiation self-sustaining cracking are disclosed herein, including<br>
HTRC, LTRC and CRC. As discussed above, by varying the parameters of the radiation self-<br>
sustaining cracking (such as, but not limited to, temperature, total absorbed dose, dose rate, type<br>
of petroleum feedstock, the use of agents and/or additional feedstock processing) the rate and<br>
yield of the radiation cracking chain reaction, as well as the production of desired commodity<br>
petroleum products, the final viscosity of the treated petroleum feedstock, the degree of<br>
conversion of the petroleum feedstock and the stimulation of alternate chemical reactions (such as<br>
but not limited to polymerization, polycondensation, isomerization, oxidation, reduction, and<br>
chemisorption) may be controlled by the user. In each method, the total absorbed dose of<br>
irradiation is selected so that the total absorbed dose is less than the limiting dose of irradiation, as<br>
defined by the stability of the treated petroleum feedstock, the commodity petroleum products<br>
desired to be produced or the desired characteristics of the treated petroleum feedstock. The<br>
limiting dose of radiation can be impacted by the other parameters of the reaction, such that the<br>
limiting dose of radiation for a particular feedstock can be different if the other parameters of the<br>
reaction are varied.<br>
In one embodiment, the self-sustaining cracking reaction is HTRC. In an alternate<br>
embodiment, the self-sustaining cracking reaction is LTRC. In yet another alternate embodiment,<br>
the self-sustaining cracking reaction is CRC. For HTRC, the petroleum feedstock is irradiated at<br>
temperatures greater or equal to about 350° C but less than or equal to about 450° C using a rime-<br>
averaged irradiation dose rate of 5 kGy/s or higher with a total absorbed dose of 0.1 to 3.0 kGy.<br>
In one embodiment the temperature range is greater or equal to about 350° C but less than or equal<br>
to about 400°. For LTRC the petroleum feedstock is irradiated at temperatures greater than about<br>
200° C and less than about 350° C using a time-averaged irradiation dose rate of 10 kGy/s or<br>
higher with a total absorbed dose of 1.0 to 5.0 kGy. For CRC the petroleum feedstock is irradiated<br><br>
at temperatures less than or equal to about 200° C using a time-averaged irradiation dose rate of 15<br>
kGy/s or higher with a total absorbed dose of 1.0 to 10.0 kGy. In one embodiment, the<br>
temperature is less than about 100° C; in a further alternate embodiment, the temperature is about<br>
room temperature; in still a further embodiment, the temperature is about 20° C.<br>
In each of HTRC, LTRC and CRC, the irradiation initiates and/or partially sustains a high-<br>
rate self sustaining chain reaction between chain carriers and excited molecules. HTRC, LTRC<br>
and CRC shall be understood not to include reactions of hydrocarbon molecule decomposition<br>
that are not self-sustaining, such as, but not limited to, radiolysis and mechanical processing.<br>
However, HTRC, LTRC and CRC can be accompanied by other non-destructive, non-self-<br>
sustaining reactions, such as but not limited to, polymerization, isomerization, oxidation,<br>
reduction and chemisorption, regulated by the special choice of processing conditions.<br>
In each of HTRC, LTRC and CRC the total absorbed dose of irradiation is less than the<br>
limiting dose of irradiation as defined by the stability of the treated petroleum feedstock, the<br>
commodity petroleum products produced or the desired characteristics of the treated petroleum<br>
feedstock. In addition, for each of HTRC, LTRC and CRC additional agents may be added before<br>
and/or during processing and/or the petroleum feedstock may be treated with a secondary process<br>
before and or during processing, each as described herein.<br>
Certain characteristics of HTRC, LTRC and CRC may make each process a better choice<br>
depending on the results desired and the starting material available. The production rate of a<br>
radiation facility (kg/s), designated Q, can be evaluated using formula<br><br>
where N is electron beam power (kW); D is the dose (kJ/kg); 77 is the accelerator efficiency (for<br>
many types of electron accelerators 77=0.8-0.85); a is coefficient that takes into account beam<br>
power losses (it is usually assumed that a «l/3). As can be seen, for the given characteristics of<br>
an electron accelerator the facility production rate depends only on the dose required for the<br>
process.<br>
The rates of irradiation-induced reactions of chain initiation and chain propagation<br>
increase as the dose rate, V, increases. Therefore, the dose necessary for the given degree of<br>
petroleum feedstock conversion depends on the dose rate. In the case of radiation-thermal<br>
cracking this dose is proportional to P"l/2, while in the case of CRC it is proportional to P'3/2. The<br>
stronger dependence D(P) for the CRC provides industrial scale processing of petroleum<br>
feedstock at low temperatures but heightened dose rates of electron irradiation.<br>
CRC provides the most economic process by allowing the highest degree of energy saving<br>
through the elimination of energy expenses for the petroleum feedstock heating. Application of<br><br>
HTRC and LTRC assumes preliminary petroleum feedstock heating to the temperatures up to<br>
about 450° C and 350° C, respectively, that is associated with additional energy consumption<br>
compared with CRC. However, in the case of LTRC, and to a lesser extent HTRC, energy<br>
expense for petroleum feedstock heating is much lower than that characteristic for conventional<br>
thermocatalitic or radiation-thermal cracking due to the increased and controllable yields of<br>
commodity petroleum products produced. At the same time, due to additional thermal excitation<br>
of hydrocarbon molecules, the HTRC and LTRC reaction rate and, therefore, production rate is<br>
higher compared with CRC at the same dose rate of electron irradiation. Moreover, HTRC and<br>
LTRC maintain temperature as an additional parameter for initiation and control of thermally<br>
activated reactions with low activation energies at relatively low temperatures; the latter can be<br>
useful for provision of the desired properties of products obtained from the special types of<br>
petroleum feedstock.<br>
Principle of Hydrocarbon Cracking<br>
For any hydrocarbon molecule cracking reaction, two stages are required (as discussed in<br>
the Background): (i) the initiation stage; and (ii) the propagation stage. Each of the initiation and<br>
propagation stages can be characterized by the specific chemistry that occurs in each reaction. The<br>
initiation stage comprises the formation and maintenance of chain carriers. The concentration of<br>
chain carriers produced during the initiation stage increases with the dose of the radiation<br>
absorbed by the petroleum feedstock.<br>
The chain carriers are produced at a concentration sufficient to initiate the chain reaction<br>
process. In one embodiment, a dose rate of ionizing radiation greater than or equal to about 1<br>
kGy/s is sufficient to produce a sufficient concentration of chain carriers to initiate the high rate<br>
chain reaction process. Principally, 1 kGy per second is sufficient for initiation of the cracking<br>
reaction (but not for its propagation). It should be noted that while 1 kGy/s is sufficient, higher<br>
dose rates will result in higher reaction rates.<br>
The propagation stage comprises the formation and maintenance of concentrations of<br>
excited molecules necessary for the propagation of the chain reaction and the maintenance of the<br>
self sustaining chain reaction. In one embodiment, excited molecules are generated entirely<br>
through excitation induced by the irradiation. In an alternate embodiment, the excited molecules<br>
are generated through excitation induced by the irradiation and other mechanisms such as, but not<br>
limited to, pre-heating the petroleum feedstock to temperatures less than 150 C, mechanical,<br>
acoustic or electromagnetic processing. In one embodiment, a dose rate of ionizing radiation<br>
greater than about 5 kGy/s is sufficient to solely produce a sufficient concentration of excited<br>
molecules to propagate the chain reaction. In embodiments where the dose rate of ionizing<br><br>
radiation is less than 5 kGy/s, the production and maintenance of excited molecules requires<br>
additional mechanisms as set forth above.<br>
In the HTRC, LTRC and CRC methods described herein, the initiation stage and the<br>
propagation stage can be carried out at temperatures from 20° C to 450° C and from about<br>
atmospheric pressure to 3 atmosphere. While the reaction vessel in which the HTRC, LTRC and<br>
CRC processes occur is not pressurized, gas evolution generated during such processes can<br>
increase the pressure in the reaction vessel to greater than atmospheric pressure. Therefore, in<br>
certain embodiments of the methods disclosed herein (such as LTRC and CRC), the initiation and<br>
propagation stages can be carried out without any thermal activation of the chain propagation<br>
reaction, although thermal enhancement may also be used. In HTRC, the temperature is sufficient<br>
for thermal activation of the chain propagation reaction. However, as distinct from the methods<br>
of the prior art, such as RTC, the rate of the HTRC reaction and the limiting dose of radiation is<br>
regulated by the variation of the dose rate in the range of greater than about 5 kGy/s and through<br>
additional treatment with processes such as, but not limited to, pre-heating the petroleum<br>
feedstock to temperatures less than 150° C, mechanical, acoustic or electromagnetic processing, to<br>
structurally and/or chemically modify the petroleum feedstock. It should be noted that the<br>
temperatures of less than about 350° C are not sufficient for thermal activation of the chain<br>
propagation reaction as is used in prior art cracking methods such as RTCj however, when<br>
combined with irradiation as described herein, thermal enhancement of chain propagation may<br>
occur due to enhanced chain carrier diffusion, which enhances the chain reaction initiated by the<br>
irradiation as provided herein. Furthermore, the concentration of the excited molecules produced<br>
by the action of irradiation can be achieved using dose rate of ionizing radiation described herein.<br>
In the case of CRC, the initiation stage and the propagation stage require only the energy<br>
provided by the ionizing radiation. In the CRC process both chain carriers and excited molecules<br>
are produced by the interaction of the ionizing radiation at a predetermined dose rate with the<br>
petroleum feedstock at temperatures below or equal to about 200° C. The chain carriers can then<br>
be used to initiate the propagation stage. Under these conditions, concentrations of chain carriers<br>
and excited molecules generated by irradiation are sufficient for the high rate of chain reaction.<br>
Since no or rninimal thermal heating is required, treatment of the petroleum feedstock can be<br>
carried out at the temperatures unusually low for hydrocarbon molecule cracking reactions.<br>
However, dependence of the hydrocarbon molecule cracking reaction rate on the radiation<br>
dose rate is different for RTC and CRC. In the case of RTC dependence of the cracking rate, W,<br>
on the radiation dose rate, P, can be written in the form of equation 1 below:<br><br><br>
In the case of CRC dependence of the cracking rate, W, on the radiation dose rate, P, can<br>
be written in the form of equation 2 below:<br><br>
In this dependence radiation generation of excited molecules at heightened dose rates is taken into<br>
account. As can be seen in comparing equations (1) and (2), an increase in the radiation dose rate<br>
P provokes a significant increase in the reaction rate observed in CRC at any temperature. This<br>
enhanced reaction rate makes CRC applicable in the industrial scale. The same and higher<br>
enhanced reaction rate also applies to HTRC and .CRC.<br>
HTRC and LTRC utilize the heightened dose rates described herein and at a temperature in<br>
the range of about 350-450° C for HTRC and about 200-350° C for LTRC. The activation energy<br>
of the HTRC process is about 80,000 J/mole and about 8600 J/mole for the LTRC process, which<br>
corresponds to activation energy for diffusion of light molecules characteristic for liquid<br>
hydrocarbon. The contribution of the added thermal energy in HTRC and LTRC increases the<br>
diffusion of the chain carriers and increases the reaction rate of hydrocarbon molecule cracking<br>
observed in LTRC.<br>
Practical application of HTRC and LTRC allows realization of radiation-initiated cracking<br>
for any type of petroleum feedstock at temperatures of greater than about 200° C and provides<br>
high reaction rates such that the process can be utilized on a commercial scale.<br>
Comparison of the prior art cracking processes to the HTRC, LTRC and CRC processes<br>
described herein are provided in Table 2. As can be seen, the mechanisms responsible for the<br>
chain propagation stage are different in HTRC, LTRC and CRC and the prior art methods. The<br>
reduction in the temperatures used in LTRC and CRC significantly reduces.energy consumption<br>
requirements per ton of petroleum feedstock in the LTRC and CRC methods as compared to the<br>
prior art methods as shown in Table 2. The characteristic temperatures used for LTRC, CRC and<br>
the prior art cracking methods are shown in FIG. 1 (RTC indicates radiation-thermal cracking,<br>
TCC indicates thermocatalytic cracking, TC indicates thermal cracking and LTRC and CRC are<br>
as previously defined). As can be observed, the temperature requirements for RTC, TCC and TC<br>
are about 10-50 fold higher than those required for CRC and 2-3 fold higher than those required<br>
for LTRC. This reduction in energy consumption reduces the economic costs associated with the<br>
LTRC and CRC processes, and when combined with the high reaction rates, makes LTRC and<br>
CRC attractive from a commercial standpoint. Furthermore, while the temperatures used in<br>
HTRC are comparable to the temperatures used in RTC, the higher reaction rate induced by the<br>
increased dose rate and structural and/or chemical modification of the petroleum feedstock with<br>
processes such as, but not limited to, pre-heating the petroleum feedstock, mechanical, acoustic or<br><br>
electromagnetic processing, result in a more efficient process in terms of the characteristics of the<br>
treated petroleum feedstocks and the commodity petroleum products produced.<br>
Irradiation modes<br>
The reaction rate in HTRC, LTRC and CRC is dependent on the characteristics of the<br>
irradiating particles. The irradiation may be provided in a continuous or anon-continuous mode.<br>
In one embodiment, the non-continuous mode is a pulsed mode with the pulse having an average<br>
pulse width and an average frequency. In one embodiment, the average pulse width is from 1-5<br>
us and the average frequency is from 30-600 s-1.<br>
In one embodiment, the irradiation is provided by an electron accelerator. In this<br>
embodiment, the reaction rate in HTRC, LTRC and CRC is dependent, in part, on the<br>
characteristics of the particles comprising the electron beam. In this embodiment, the electron<br>
accelerator produces electrons to irradiate the petroleum feedstock, with said electrons having an<br>
energy of from 1 to 10 MeV.<br>
FIG. 2 shows the calculated dependence of quasi-stationary radical concentration in three<br>
different pulsed (i.e. non-continuous) irradiation modes on the stationary radical concentration at<br>
the same average dose rate in the continuous irradiation mode. The non-continuous mode<br>
characterized by the lowest pulse width and frequency (3 us, 60 s-1) differs the most from the<br>
continuous irradiation mode. The two additional non-continuous modes (3 us, 300 s-1 and 5 us,<br>
200 s-1) give the results close to continuous irradiation when dose rates are relatively low. When<br>
the dose rate in a pulse is lower than 2 X 106 Gy/s, the corresponding radical concentrations differ<br>
by less than 25%. At high dose rates the quasi-stationary time-averaged radical concentration<br>
depends on the square root of the time-averaged dose rate according to the logarithmic law, and<br>
its difference from the stationary radical concentration in the continuous irradiation mode rapidly<br>
increases with the dose rate.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 2, the continuous mode of electron radiation provides a higher<br>
concentration of chain carriers, and consequently excited molecules, than the non-continuous<br>
modes. However, both continuous and non-continuous modes of irradiation can be used in LTRC<br>
and CRC as described herein.<br>
Process<br>
The technological scheme for treatment petroleum feedstock and methods for reaction<br>
control are based on the fundamental regularities of radiation-chemical conversion.<br>
The HTRC, LTRC and CRC methods provide for the efficient transfer of irradiation<br>
energy to hydrocarbon molecules in a petroleum feedstock. The mechanism and kinetics for<br>
interaction of chain carriers and excited molecules can be considered as universal with respect to<br>
all petroleum feedstocks, including but not limited to oil petroleum feedstocks, such as but not<br><br>
limited to, heavy crude oil, heavy residua of oil processing, bitumen extracts, etc. For realization<br>
of HTRC, LTRC and CRC, a desired petroleum feedstock is supplied to a radiation-chemical<br>
reactor vessel. The petroleum feedstock may be supplied in a liquid form, a gas form, a solid<br>
form or a combination of the foregoing. In one embodiment, the petroleum feedstock is supplied<br>
in a liquid form. The reactions required for the HTRC, LTRC and CRC processes occur in the<br>
radiation-chemical reactor vessel.<br>
The general scheme for the HTRC, LTRC and CRC process is given in FIG. 3. In the<br>
reactor vessel, the petroleum feedstock is irradiated by particles having a defined energy produced<br>
by a radiation source. The petroleum feedstock is exposed to the particles with a defined energy<br>
for a defined time so that the absorbed radiation dose rate is sufficient to initiate and/or sustain the<br>
CRC process and the dose is sufficient to provide the required degree of petroleum feedstock<br>
treatment.<br>
The reactor vessel may be any vessel that is known in the art. A typical reaction vessel<br>
will comprise an input window to allow the irradiation to enter. The input window generally<br>
corresponds to the area of the electron beam sweep, hi one embodiment the input window is 100<br>
x 15 cm2. However, other dimensions may be used as desired.<br>
For the various methods described below, the petroleum feedstock may be introduced into<br>
the reactor vessel using any technique known in the art. In one embodiment, the petroleum<br>
feedstock is introduced by injection into the reactor vessel in a dispersed form, such as via an<br>
atomizer. As discussed below, the petroleum feedstock may be treated with an agent to enhance<br>
the reaction (such as but not limited to ionized air, steam, ozone, oxygen, hydrogen, methane and<br>
methanol, or other gases/vapors/liquids) or subject to structural and/or chemical modification<br>
using an additional processing step (such as but not limited to thermal, mechanical, acoustic or<br>
electromagnetic processing). Said agent may be added or said additional processing may occur<br>
before processing, during processing or both. The additional processing is referred to herein as<br>
modification of the petroleum feedstock. Modification of the petroleum feedstock is optional.<br>
However, the limiting dose or irradiation and the reaction rate may be varied through the use of<br>
the optional modification. Furthermore, the limiting dose or irradiation and the reaction rate may<br>
be varied through altering the time-averaged' irradiation dose rate and the flow condition<br>
parameters.<br>
In the CRC process the petroleum feedstock temperature is in the range of about 20° C to<br>
about 200° C. In one embodiment, petroleum feedstock temperature is not higher than about 70°<br>
C. In an alternate embodiment, petroleum feedstock temperature is not higher than about 50° C.<br>
In yet another alternate embodiment, petroleum feedstock temperature is not higher than about<br>
room temperature. The petroleum feedstock may be irradiated in a static (no flow of petroleum<br><br>
feedstock) state or a non-static (with flow of the petroleum feedstock) state. In the non-static<br>
state, the petroleum feedstock flow rate through the reactor vessel is maintained at a flow rate<br>
such that the exposure time of the petroleum feedstock is the minimal time required for the<br>
petroleum feedstock to absorb a total dose of radiation, at a given dose rate and temperature, to<br>
initiate and/or sustain the initiation and/or propagation stages of CRC. The flow rate may be<br>
maintained at a constant rate or varied and may depend on the volume of the petroleum feedstock<br>
being treated. Generally, the higher the energy of the particle (such as an electron) used to<br>
provide the irradiation, the lower the flow rate can be for the given rate of processing, given dose<br>
rate and/or absorbed dose. At a given flow rate, the linear velocity of the flow and the depth of<br>
the petroleum feedstock layer subject to irradiation can be varied. In one embodiment, the flow<br>
rate is between about 10 and 200 kg/hour, the linear flow velocity is between 10 and 50 m/s and<br>
the depth of the petroleum feedstock being irradiated is from about 0.5 to 4 mm. The maximal<br>
depth of the petroleum feedstock is defined by the depth of the particle penetration into the<br>
petroleum feedstock and depends on the energy of the particle. For example, for an electron with<br>
an energy of 7 MeV, the depth of particle penetration is about 4 cm.<br>
In one embodiment of CRC, the irradiation is provided as a pulsed electron beam or a<br>
continuous electron beam as described herein and the particles are electrons. The electron beam<br>
may be produced by an electron accelerator. In one embodiment of the CRC process, a continuous<br>
mode of irradiation is used. The electrons may have energies within the range of about 1-10 MeV.<br>
In one embodiment the irradiation dose rates used in the CRC process are above about 15 kGy/s,<br>
the total absorbed dose of irradiation is from about 1.0 to about 10.0 kGy and the total absorbed<br>
dose is less than the limiting dose of irradiation, as defined by the stability of the treated<br>
petroleum feedstock, the commodity petroleum products desired to be produced or the desired<br>
characteristics of the treated petroleum feedstock. As would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art, it is advantageous to maintain the absorbed dose of radiation and the time of exposure to a<br>
minimum required to achieve the desired objective.<br>
For LTRC, the petroleum feedstock may be supplied to a reactor vessel as described above<br>
for the CRC process. LTRC of die petroleum feedstock is carried out using the same<br>
technological scheme and the same radiation-chemical reactor vessel as shown in FIG. 3 and<br>
described above in relation to the CRC process. However, in LTRC, the petroleum feedstock is<br>
heated up to a temperature from about 200 to about 350° C. In LTRC, as with CRC, in the reactor<br>
vessel the petroleum feedstock comes into contact with particles having a defined energy<br>
produced by a radiation source. The petroleum feedstock is exposed to the particles witfi a<br>
defined energy for a defined time so that the absorbed radiation dose rate is sufficient to initiate<br>
and/or sustain the LTRC process and the dose is sufficient to provide the required degree of<br><br>
petroleum feedstock treatment The petroleum feedstock may be irradiated in a static (no flow of<br>
petroleum feedstock) state or a non-stack (with flow of the petroleum feedstock) state. In the non-<br>
static state, the petroleum feedstock flow rate through the reactor vessel is maintained at a flow<br>
rate such that the exposure time of the petroleum feedstock is the minimal time required for the<br>
petroleum feedstock to absorb a dose of Tadiation, at a given dose rate and temperature, to initiate<br>
and/or sustain the initiation and/or propagation stages of the LTRC reaction. The flow rate may<br>
be maintained at a constant rate or varied and may depend on the volume of the petroleum<br>
feedstock being treated. Generally, the higher the energy of the particle (such as an electron) used<br>
to provide the irradiation, the lower the flow rate can be for the given rate of processing, given<br>
dose rate and/or absorbed dose. At a given flow rate, the linear velocity of the flow and the depth<br>
of the petroleum feedstock layer subject to irradiation can be varied. In one embodiment, the flow<br>
rate is between about 10 and 200 kg/hour, the linear flow velocity is between 10 and 50 m/s and<br>
the depth of the petroleum feedstock being irradiated is from about 0.5 to 4 mm. The maximal<br>
depth of the petroleum feedstock is defined by the depth of the particle penetration into the<br>
petroleum feedstock and depends on the energy of the particle. For example, for an electron with<br>
an energy of 7 MeV, the depth of particle penetration is about 4 cm.<br>
In one embodiment, petroleum feedstock is irradiated with pulsed electron beam. The<br>
pulsed electron beam may be produced by an electron accelerator. For the LTRC process, a<br>
continuous or pulsed mode of irradiation is used. When the petroleum feedstock is heated to a<br>
temperature at or below about 250°C, a continuous mode of irradiation is preferred. However,<br>
when the petroleum feedstock is heated to temperatures above 250°C either a pulsed or continuous<br>
mode of irradiation may be used. However, a continuous mode of irradiation provides a higher<br>
production rate. The electrons may have energies within the range of about 1-10 MeV. In one<br>
embodiment the irradiation dose rates used in the LTRC process are above about 10 kGy/s, the<br>
total absorbed dose of irradiation is from about 1.0 to about 5.0 kGy and the total absorbed dose is<br>
less than the limiting dose of irradiation, as defined by the stability of the treated petroleum<br>
feedstock, the commodity petroleum products desired to be produced or the desired characteristics<br>
of the treated petroleum feedstock. As would be obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art, it is<br>
advantageous to maintain the total absorbed dose of radiation, and the time of exposure to a<br>
minimum required to achieve the desired objective.<br>
For HTRC, the petroleum feedstock may be supplied to a reactor vessel as described<br>
above for the CRC process. HTRC of the petroleum feedstock is carried out using the same<br>
technological scheme and the same radiation-chemical reactor vessel as shown in FIG. 3 and<br>
described above in relation to the CRC process. However, in LTRC, the petroleum feedstock is<br>
preheated and processed up to a temperature from about 350 to about 450° C. In HTRC, as with<br><br>
CRC, in the reactor vessel the petroleum feedstock comes into contact with particles having a<br>
defined energy produced by a radiation source. The petroleum feedstock is exposed to the<br>
particles with a defined energy for a defined time so that the absorbed radiation dose rate is<br>
sufficient to initiate and/or sustain the HTRC process at the prescribed dose rate and the dose is<br>
sufficient to provide the required degree of petroleum feedstock treatment. The petroleum<br>
feedstock may be irradiated in a static (no flow of petroleum feedstock) state or a non-static (with<br>
flow of the petroleum feedstock) state. In the non-static state, the petroleum feedstock flow rate<br>
through the reactor vessel is maintained at a flow rate such that the exposure time of the<br>
petroleum feedstock is the minimal time required for the petroleum feedstock to absorb a dose of<br>
radiation, at a given dose rate and temperature, to initiate and/or sustain the initiation and/or<br>
propagation stages of the HTRC reaction. The flow rate may be maintained at a constant rate or<br>
varied and may depend on the volume of the petroleum feedstock being treated. Generally, the<br>
higher the energy of the particle (such as an electron) used to provide the irradiation, the lower the<br>
flow rate can be for the given rate of processing, given dose rate and/or absorbed dose. At a given<br>
flow rate, the linear velocity of the flow and the depth of the petroleum feedstock layer subject to<br>
irradiation can be varied. In one embodiment, the flow rate is between about 10 and 200 kg/hour,<br>
the linear flow velocity is between 10 and 50 m/s and the depth of the petroleum feedstock being<br>
irradiated is from about 0.5 to 4 mm. The maximal depth of the petroleum feedstock is defined by<br>
the depth of the particle penetration into the petroleum feedstock and depends on the energy of the<br>
particle. For example, for an electron with an energy of 7 MeV, the depth of particle penetration<br>
is about 4 cm.<br>
In one embodiment, petroleum feedstock is irradiated with pulsed electron beam. The<br>
pulsed electron beam may be produced by an electron accelerator. For the HTRC process, a<br>
continuous or pulsed mode of irradiation is used. In the case of HTRC, either a pulsed or<br>
continuous mode of irradiation may be used. The electrons may have energies within the range of<br>
about 1-10 MeV. In one embodiment the irradiation dose rates used in the HTRC process are<br>
above about 5 kGy/s, the total absorbed dose of irradiation is from about 0.1 to about 2.0 kGy and<br>
the total absorbed dose is less than the limiting dose of irradiation, as defined by the stability of<br>
the treated petroleum feedstock, the commodity petroleum products desired to be produced or the<br>
desired characteristics of the treated petroleum feedstock. As would be obvious to one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art, it is advantageous to maintain the total absorbed dose of radiation, and the time of<br>
exposure to a minimum required to achieve the desired objective.<br>
In the above reactions, as further exemplified in the following examples, the limiting dose<br>
of radiation and the reaction rate is a function of the time-averaged irradiation dose rate and the<br>
modification to the petroleum feedstock, which is optional. By varying one or all of these<br><br>
parameters the limiting dose of radiation and the reaction rate can be altered. In one embodiment,<br>
modification of the petroleum feedstock allows the time-averaged irradiation dose rate to be<br>
decreased while maintaining the reaction rate and the overall yield of the reaction.<br>
Furthermore, in the above reactions the. treatment in flow conditions provides a radiation<br>
chemical yield of light fractions of not less than 100 molecules per 100 eV applied to the reaction.<br>
Light fractions in this regard refer to those species in the treated petroleum feedstock, commodity<br>
petroleum product or upgraded petroleum feedstock having a carbon chain of 14 carbons or less.<br>
The method of calculating radiation chemical yield is described in [2].<br>
The radiation-chemical yield, G, is defined as the number of product molecules (or the<br>
number of reacted feedstock molecules) per 100 eV of consumed irradiation energy. In the case<br>
processing reactions that do not utilize a self-sustaining chain reaction as set forth in the present<br>
disclosure, characteristic G values are 3-5 molecules/lOOeV. In the case processing reactions that<br>
utilize a self-sustaining chain reaction as set forth in the present disclosure, G can vary in the<br>
range from about 10 to about 20,000 molecules/100 eV (see Examples below).<br><br>
where NA is the Avogadro number, e is the electron charge, P is the dose rate, M, in kg/mole, is<br>
the average molecular mass of the product or the feedstock, depending on which radiation-<br>
t<br>
chemical yield is being determined and W is the initial rate of cracking reaction, s-1 :<br><br>
where t is time, Y is the relative share of reacted feedstock molecules or accumulated product<br>
molecules).<br>
Finally, in the above reactions, to prevent heating of metal parts of the radiation-chemical<br>
reactor vessel, water and/or liquid nitrogen cooling may be used if desired. When more<br>
homogeneous irradiation and higher reaction rates are desired, the petroleum feedstock may be<br>
injected to the reaction camera in a dispersed form through atomizers or water vapor (such as<br>
steam) and/or ionized (ozone containing) air may be injected into the reactor vessel. The ionized<br>
air used for injection may be obtained as a by product of the electron accelerator operation. The<br>
water vapor and/or ionized air may be pumped into the reactor vessel during irradiation of the<br>
petroleum feedstock or may be bubbled into the petroleum feedstock before introduction into the<br>
reactor vessel. In a particular embodiment where the ionized air is introduced into the petroleum<br>
feedstock into in the reactor vessel during radiation processing, the irradiation dose rates may be<br><br>
decreased 4- 20 fold, or in the case of CRC to the 1-5 kGy/s range. Therefore, irradiation doses<br>
can be reduced and production rates can be increased 4- 20 fold.<br>
The product of HTRC, LTRC and CRC processes are a treated petroleum feedstock, a<br>
commodity petroleum product and/or an upgraded petroleum product. The treated petroleum<br>
feedstock may comprise an upgraded liquid traction and/or an upgraded gaseous fraction (such as<br>
but not limited to hydrogen, methane, ethylene and other gases). The upgraded liquid and/or<br>
gaseous fraction may contain a single component or multiple components which can be further<br>
isolated. By upgraded, it is meant that the liquid or gaseous fractions have, on average, shorter<br>
hydrocarbon molecule lengths than found, on average, in the petroleum feedstock or these<br>
fractions have upgraded properties (i.g. higher gasoline octane numbers, a desired polymeric<br>
composition or a desired isomer composition). The upgraded gaseous fraction may be transferred<br>
from the reactor vessel to a gas separator in communication with the reactor vessel to separate the<br>
various gaseous fractions into commodity gaseous products. The gas separator can be any gas<br>
separator currently known or known in the future as the exact operation of the gas separator is not<br>
critical to the present disclosure. The commodity gaseous products may be used for a variety of<br>
purposes, such as petroleum feedstocks for the chemical industry. The upgraded liquid fraction is<br>
transferred from the reactor vessel to a device for fractionation of the upgraded liquid fraction into<br>
commodity products. The device for fractionation is in communication with the reactor vessel.<br>
The device for fractionation can be any device currently known or known in the future as the<br>
exact operation of the device is not critical to the. present disclosure. In an alternate embodiment,<br>
the upgraded liquid fraction can be used directly for further processing reactions (such as a<br>
synthetic crude oil) or can be used directly as a commodity product. Alternatively, the treated<br>
petroleum feedstock may be transferred to another facility for further processing, using prior art<br>
methods or the methods of the present disclosure. The use of HTRC, LTRC and/or CRC may<br>
result in the treated petroleum feedstock having desired characteristics, such as, but not limited to,<br>
decreased viscosity, that allow the treated petroleum feedstock to be transported.<br>
Furthermore, in the case where the HTRC, LTRC or CRC process is accompanied by<br>
considerable gas evolution, for example when the petroleum feedstock is a rugh-paraffmic<br>
petroleum feedstock, gases produced may be partially recycled through the HTRC, LTRC or CRC<br>
process and used for upgrading the products of the process.<br>
Therefore, through the use of HTRC, LTRC and CRC, the economic treatment of<br>
petroleum feedstocks is accomplished on an industrial scale. As a result, many previously<br>
unusable petroleum feedstocks may be converted into usable petroleum feedstocks to produce a<br>
variety of commodity products. Furthermore, through hydrocarbon molecule decomposition, the<br>
recovery of shorter chain hydrocarbon fractions may be increased and the properties associated<br><br>
with shorter chain hydrocarbon fractions, such as increased viscosity, may be increased. The<br>
HTRC, LTRC and CRC processes allow this transformation at a minimum energy expense. The<br>
energy consumed for electron accelerator operation is significantly lower than the energy required<br>
for petroleum feedstock heating RTC and TC, as well as other prior art hydrocarbon molecule<br>
cracking processes. The reduction in energy expense leads to a corresponding decrease in<br>
operational costs for petroleum feedstock processing and also to potentially lower cost for the<br>
commodity goods derived therefrom.<br>
In addition to the economic benefits, the use of HTRC, LTRC and CRC provide other<br>
benefits as well. Since these processes occur at pressures from about atmospheric pressure to 3<br>
atmospheres, the process is safer than prior art hydrocarbon cracking processes. Specifically, the<br>
risks of explosions and accidental leakage are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the costs of<br>
equipment and equipment maintenance are reduced since the HTRC, LTRC and CRC processes<br>
operate at lowered pressure and lowered temperatures. Yet another benefit relates to the low<br>
temperatures used in the LTRC and CRC process. The low temperature reactions reduce<br>
unwanted chemical processes that occur at higher temperatures, such as coking and<br>
polymerization. Furthermore, while higher temperatures are used in the HTRC process, the<br>
additional parameters of the HTRC process allow for control of such unwanted chemical<br>
processes. Therefore, the HTRC, LTRC and CRC processes generate less waste products than the<br>
prior art hydrocarbon cracking methods.<br>
Expected Production Rates<br>
The expected production rate of a single industrial facility employing the CRC process<br>
based on an accelerator with an electron energy of 2-10 MeV and an electron beam power of ~100<br>
MA is 500-700 thousands tons of petroleum feedstock per year. The production rate for the CRC<br>
process (given the conditions stated above) can be increased by an order of magnitude if the<br>
petroleum feedstock is bubbled with ionized air and/or ionized air is injected into the reactor<br>
vessel in a dispersed form. Using this technique, the irradiation dose necessary for realization of<br>
CRC can be reduced to the value of ~l-2 kGy.<br>
An increase in the temperature of the petroleum feedstock up to 350° C in the LTRC<br>
process will further increase the reaction rate of hydrocarbon molecule cracking by 20-30 fold.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
In this example, the petroleum feedstock was fuel oil (i.e., the heavy residua of primary oil<br>
distillation). The fuel oil petroleum feedstock is characterized in Table 3. The fuel oil was<br>
processed using HTRC as described with the following parameters: pulse irradiation mode (pulse<br>
width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with energy of 2 MeV in flow<br><br>
conditions at the temperature of 410° C and time-averaged dose rate of 2 kGy/s for a total<br>
absorbed electron dose of 3 kGy.<br>
The total yield of liquid product (fraction boiling out below 450°C) produced using the<br>
HTRC method under the conditions described above was 76% (by mass) and the yield of motor<br>
fuels (fraction with BP up to 350° C) was 45% (by mass). However, the liquid commodity<br>
petroleum products produced were unstable and demonstrated a strong tendency toward coking.<br>
After a 10-day storage post-processing, the concentration of the fraction with BP 
fuels) decreased by 10% (by mass).<br>
In this example, for the given type of petroleum feedstock utilized (fuel oil) and the HTRC<br>
processing conditions employed, the limiting dose of irradiation as defined by the stability of the<br>
commodity petroleum products is lower than 3 kGy.<br>
To increase the limiting dose of irradiation (as defined by the stability of the commodity<br>
petroleum products) and to increase the yields of desirable commodity petroleum products (in this<br>
case motor fuels such as gasoline), the same fuel oil petroleum feedstock was preliminarily<br>
bubbled with ionized air produced as a by-product of the electron accelerator operation for 7<br>
minutes at a temperature of 180° C before being subject to HTRC processing. The ionized air aids<br>
in the destruction of the radiation-resistant cluster structure present in the fuel oil petroleum<br>
feedstock, reducing the tendency toward coking and increasing the stability of the produced<br>
commodity petroleum products. The reduction' of radiation-resistant cluster structures allows the<br>
limiting dose of radiation, as defined by the stability of the commodity petroleum products to be<br>
increased. At the same time, the ionized air increased the desulfurization of the petroleum<br>
feedstock and causes oxidation reactions that facilitate destruction of high-molecular compounds.<br>
As a result, the temperature required for HTRC processing can be lowered.<br>
To further increase the limiting dose of irradiation (as defined by the stability of the<br>
commodity petroleum products) and to increase the yields of desirable commodity petroleum<br>
products (in this case motor fuels such as gasoline), the fuel oil petroleum feedstock was<br>
irradiated with an increased electron dose rate. In this example, the fuel oil was processed using<br>
HTRC as described with the following parameters: pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 \xs<br>
and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with energy of 2 MeV in flow conditions at the<br>
temperature of 380° C and time-averaged dose rate of 6 kGy/s for a total absorbed electron dose of<br>
3.5 kGy.<br>
The total yield of liquid product (fraction boiling out below 450°C) produced using the<br>
HTRC method under the conditions described above was 86% (by mass); the yield of gases was<br>
8.6% by mass and the yield of coking residue was 5.4% (by mass). The yield of motor fuels<br>
(fraction with BP up to 350° C) was 52% (by mass). The results are illustrated in FIGS. 4A and B.<br><br>
Using HTRC processing with the conditions described above, the commodity petroleum<br>
products were stable. The fractional contents of the treated petroleum feedstock one year after<br>
HTRC processing as described did not show any changes within the error of measurements. In<br>
this example, for the given type of petroleum feedstock utilized (fuel oil) and the HTRC<br>
processing conditions employed, the limiting dose of irradiation as defined by the stability of the<br>
commodity petroleum products is greater than 3.5 kGy due to bubbling of ionized air into the<br>
petroleum feedstock prior to HTRC processing and application of the heightened dose rate of<br>
irradiation.<br>
An additional result of the HTRC processing as described was decrease in total sulfur<br>
content in the liquid commodity petroleum product produced. The sulfur content was reduced by<br>
up to 1% (by mass), which is 3 times lower than the sulfur concentration in the liquid product of<br>
direct distillation of the fuel oil. Since no other special measures for desulfurization were<br>
undertaken, the decrease in sulfur content is the direct result of bubbling of ionized air into the<br>
petroleum feedstock prior to HTRC processing.<br>
Example 2<br>
In this example, a high-viscous oil and fuel oil were used as the petroleum feedstocks. The<br>
high-viscous oil and fuel oil petroleum feedstocks are characterized in Table 4. The high-viscous<br>
oil and fuel oil were processed using HTRC as described with the following parameters: pulse<br>
irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with energy<br>
of 2 MeV in flow conditions at the temperature of 430° C and time-averaged dose rate of 1 kGy/s<br>
for a total absorbed electron dose of 7 kGy. The characterization of the commodity petroleum<br>
products obtained are also characterized in Table 4.<br>
In this example, the desired commodity petroleum product was the basic material for<br>
lubricant production characterized by longer hydrocarbon chains (carbon chain lengths of 20 and<br>
above) and higher molecular mass compared with motor fuels (see Table 1).<br>
In contrast to the requirements for the optimal production of commodity petroleum<br>
products such as motor fuels, an important role in HTRC processing for the production of<br>
lubricants is performed by radiation-induced polymerization, which reduces the mono-olefin<br>
content in the lubricant-containing fraction and attenuates its oxidation. The heavy polymer<br>
deposit forming during HTRC processing is the result, in part, of the high adsorption capacity of<br>
such compounds. The intense olefin polymerization combined with radiation-induced adsorption<br>
causes efficient release of the lubricant-containing fraction from pitches, asphaltenes, mechanical<br>
impurities, if available, and further easy extraction of purified lubricants. The combination of high<br>
rates of destruction and olefin polymerization are provided by HTRC processing at temperatures<br><br>
higher than the temperature characteristic for the start of HTRC in conditions favorable for<br>
development of non-destructive thermally activated processes.<br>
This example shows that variation of irradiation parameters, such as, but not limited to,<br>
temperature, time averaged dose rate, total dose and petroleum feedstock, subject to the basic<br>
phenomenon of HTRC processing allows control on the required length of the hydrocarbon chain<br>
and provides different types of products obtained from the same feedstock.<br>
Example 3<br>
In this example, a high viscosity crude oil (viscosity V20 — 2200 cCt, density P20 = 0.95<br>
g/cm3, considerable contents of sulfur (about 2 mass %) and vanadium (100-120 /*g/g)) was used<br>
as the petroleum feedstock and was processed using LTRC as described above using the following<br>
parameters: pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using<br>
electrons with an energy of 2 MeV in static (meaning no petroleum feedstock flow and no<br>
bubbling of ionized air or water vapor) conditions at a temperature of 250° C and a time averaged<br>
dose rate of 10 kGy/s for a total absorbed electron dose of 1.8MGy.<br>
The results are illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B. FIG. 5A displays the results as changes in<br>
the fractional contents of the petroleum feedstock as determined by the number of carbon atoms in<br>
a molecule of the petroleum feedstock before (darker line) and after treatment (lighter line) and<br>
FIG. 5B displays the results as changes in the boiling point ranges of the petroleum feedstock<br>
before (darker bars) and after treatment (lighter bars). The treated petroleum feedstock contained<br>
95% (by mass) liquid fraction and 5% (by mass) gases, with the gaseous fraction comprising<br>
10.5% (by mass) hydrogen, 32.5% (by mass) methane, 18% (by mass) ethane, 10% (by mass)<br>
butane, 15% (by mass) ethylene, 8% (by mass) propylene, 6% (by mass) olefins and other gases.<br>
As can be seen in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the yield of lighter (i.e. short chain) hydrocarbon<br>
fractions (indicated by the lower number of carbon atoms in the molecule, FIG. 5A, and lower<br>
boiling points, FIG. 5B) is increased and the yield of heavier (i.e. long chain and residue)<br>
hydrocarbon fractions is decreased. The boiling points of some commonly obtained commodity<br>
petroleum products are listed in Table 1. As a result of the LTRC processing the yields of<br>
fractions with boiling points of less than 350° C increased from 43% (by mass) in the petroleum<br>
feedstock to 55.3% (by mass) in the treated petroleum feedstock. After LTRC, the concentration<br>
of the total sulfur in the gasoline and the kerosene fractions (start of boiling — 250 °C) was less<br>
than 0,1% (by mass). The obtained distributions of sulfur-containing compounds have shown that<br>
LTRC process causes transformation of these sulfur-containing compounds due to radiation-<br>
induced oxidation reactions with ionized air. It results in "cleaning" motor fuels due to higher<br>
sulfur concentration in the heavy LTRC residue (fractions boiling out at temperatures higher than<br>
450° C).<br><br>
The octane number of the gasoline fraction extracted from the overall product (start of<br>
boiling - 180°C) was 84. Similar measurements of the octane number in the gasoline extracted<br>
from the original petroleum feedstock resulted in the value of 67.<br>
Example 4<br>
In this example, another type of high-viscous crude oil was used as the petroleum<br>
feedstock (viscosity v20= 496 cCt, density D20 = 0.92 g/cm3, sulfur concentration - 1.4% (by<br>
mass). Its fractional content is characterized by the dark curve in FIG. 6A and dark columns in<br>
FIG. 6B. The petroleum feedstock was processed u.sing CRC as described above using the<br>
following parameters: pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 3 us and pulse frequency of 60 s-1)<br>
using electrons with an energy of 7 MeV in non-static (i.e. with feedstock distillation under the<br>
electron beam and bubbling of ionized air into the petroleum feedstock during radiation<br>
processing inside the reactor vessel) at a temperature of 170° C and a time averaged dose rate of<br>
2.7 kGy/s for a total absorbed electron dose of 300 kGy.<br>
The results are illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B. FIG. 6A displays the results as changes in<br>
the fractional contents of the petroleum feedstock as determined by the number of carbon atoms in<br>
a molecule of the petroleum feedstock before (darker line) and after treatment (lighter line) and<br>
FIG. 6B displays the results as changes in the boiling point ranges of the petroleum feedstock<br>
before (darker bars) and after treatment (lighter bars). As with the results in FIGS. 5A and 5B,<br>
CRC processing resulted in an increased in the yield of lighter (i.e. short chain) hydrocarbon<br>
fractions (indicated by the lower number of carbon atoms in the molecule, FIG. 6A, and lower<br>
boiling points, FIG. 6B) and a decrease in the yield of heavier (i.e. long chain and residue)<br>
hydrocarbon fractions. Furthermore, the results of Example 4 show that bubbling the petroleum<br>
feedstock with ionized air allows approximately the same type of petroleum feedstock conversion<br>
(compare the results of Example 3 to Example 4) using a 6-fold lower dose (300 kGy compared<br>
with 1800 kGy in Example 2) at a considerably lower dose rate (2.7 kGy/s compared with 10<br>
kGy/s in Example 2).<br>
Example 5<br>
In this example, the same petroleum feedstock was used as described in Example 3. Again<br>
the petroleum feedstock was processed using LTRC as described above using the following<br>
parameters: pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using<br>
electrons with an energy of 2 MeV in non-static (i.e. with feedstock distillation under the electron<br>
beam and bubbling of ionized air into the petroleum feedstock during radiation processing inside<br>
the reactor vessel) at a temperature of 220° C and a time averaged dose rate of 10 kGy/s for a total<br>
absorbed electron dose of 26 kGy. The results are illustrated in FIGS. 7A and 7B. FIG. 7A<br>
displays the results as changes in the fractional contents of the petroleum feedstock as determined<br><br>
by the number of carbon atoms in a molecule of the petroleum feedstock before (darker line) and<br>
after treatment (lighter line) and FIG. 7B displays the results as changes in the boiling point<br>
ranges of the petroleum feedstock before (darker bars) and after treatment (lighter bars).<br>
As can be seen in FIGS 7A and 7B the changes in fractional contents of the petroleum<br>
feedstock under the conditions of Example 5 were more pronounced, especially in the fractions<br>
having a boiling point of less than 300° C. In addition, LTRC processing under the conditions of<br>
Example 5 results in practically complete liquidation of the heavy residue with the boiling<br>
temperature higher than 450° C. This increase in conversion occurred even though the total<br>
absorbed electron dose was significantly decreased at the same dose rate as compared to Example<br>
3. The experimentally observed rate of the hydrocarbon molecule cracking reaction was<br>
approximately 4.9 s-1. This reaction rate was approximately 63% higher than the rate of the<br>
hydrocarbon molecule cracking reaction observed at a temperature of 400° C and the dose rate of<br>
4 kGy/s for the same petroleum feedstock.<br>
Comparison with Example 4 shows that an increase in the dose rate (10 kGy/s compared<br>
with 2.7 kGy/s in Example 4) and temperature of processing (220°C compared with 170°C in<br>
Example 4) allowed approximately the same degree of petroleum feedstock conversion using a<br>
total dose 11.5 fold lower (26 kGy compared with 300 kGy in Example 4).<br><br>
where H is the activation energy for light radicals diffusion in hydrocarbons (H « 8,4 kJ/mole) and<br>
indexes 1 and 2 refer to the values of quantities in the two different experiments. Substituting the<br>
values of the dose rate and the temperatures in Examples 4 and 5, S=l 1.3 which corresponds to<br>
the experimental dose ratio. Thus, the data given in these examples are in agreement with the<br>
concepts disclosed in the present disclosure and show that the same processes are valid for the two<br>
types of high-viscous crude oil used as petroleum feedstock in Examples 4 and 5.<br>
Example 6<br>
In this example, the same petroleum feedstock was used as described in Example 3.<br>
Example 6 compares the dependence of the initial hydrocarbon molecule cracking rate, W, on the<br>
dose rate, P, of electron irradiation at 400° C (for RTC) and 220° C (for LTRC). The results are<br>
shown in FIG. 8.<br>
According to commonly accepted theory of radiation-thermal cracking [2], the rate of<br>
thermally activated cracking propagation W is proportional to the factorPxn exp(—2?/W). The<br>
value of activation energy for chain propagation, E, characteristic for hydrocarbons is 250<br>
kJ/mole. Therefore, attainment of the same cracking rate at 220° C would require increase of the<br><br><br>
molecule cracking rate at a temperature of 220° C would be for all practical purposes impossible.<br>
FIG. 8 shows that this commonly accepted theory is not accurate. For example, at the<br>
temperature of 400° C and the dose rate of electron irradiation of 4 kGy/s the observed<br>
hydrocarbon molecule cracking rate is 3 s"\ FIG. 8 shows that the same hydrocarbon molecule<br>
cracking rate is 3 s-1 can be obtained using the LTRC methods of the present disclosure at a<br>
temperature of 220° C and a dose rate of 7.5 kGy/s, which is only 1.9 time greater than the dose<br>
rate required using RTC at a temperature of 400° C.<br>
Example 7<br>
In this example, the same petroleum feedstock was used as described in Example 3. The<br>
petroleum feedstock was processed using CRC as described using the following parameters:<br>
pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 jis and pulse frequency of 200 s"') using electrons with an<br>
energy of 2 MeV in static conditions at the temperature of 50° C, a time averaged dose rate of 36-<br>
40 kGy/s and a total absorbed dose of 320 kGy.<br>
The results are illustrated in FIGS. 9A and 9B. FIG. 9A displays the results as changes in<br>
the fractional contents as determined by the number of carbon atoms in a molecule of the<br>
petroleum feedstock before (darker line) and after treatment (lighter line) and FIG. 9B displays<br>
the results as changes in the boiling point ranges of the petroleum feedstock before (darker bars)<br>
and after treatment (lighter bars). Comparison of chromatography data in FIG. 9A shows that<br>
CRC process causes considerable changes in fractional contents of the untreated versus treated<br>
petroleum feedstock. Notably, after CRC processing the concentration of heavy fractions<br>
(represented by fraction having molecules with over 27 carbon atoms and boiling points greater<br>
than about 400° C) decreases and the average molecular mass of the component in the various<br>
fractions contents becomes considerably lower indicating products with smaller hydrocarbon<br>
chains have been formed.<br>
The effects of CRC processing were the decrease in the heavy residue content and increase<br>
in concentration of light fractions, which include various types of commodity fuels among other<br>
components. The degree of petroleum feedstock conversion was conventionally defined by<br>
changes in concentration of the heavy residua boiling out at the temperatures higher than 450° C.<br>
In this example, the degree of the petroleum feedstock conversion reached 47% (by mass) after 9<br>
seconds of radiation processing; the rate of conversion was 5.2% per second.<br>
Example 8.<br>
In this example, the same petroleum feedstock was used as described in Example 3. The<br>
petroleum feedstock was processed using CRC as described using the following parameters:<br><br>
pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with an<br>
energy of 2 MeV in static conditions at the temperature of 30° C, a time averaged dose rate of 14<br>
kGy/s and a total absorbed dose of 450 kGy.<br>
In one of the experimental runs 1.5 mass % methanol was added into the feedstock prior to<br>
said treatment. Fractional contents of the liquid product of the feedstock processing in said<br>
conditions without methanol addition and that with methanol added to the feedstock before<br>
electron irradiation are compared in Fig. 10.<br>
Fig. 10 shows that the degree of feedstock conversion and the hydrocarbon contents of the<br>
liquid product can be purposefully changed by using special additives. Methanol addition results<br>
in deeper conversion of the fraction boiling in the range of 350-450°C. In the case of methanol<br>
addition, the conversion degree is some lower for the heavy residue boiling out at temperatures<br>
higher than 450°C. However, the total yields of light fractions boiling out below 350°C increases<br>
almost twice when 1.5 mass% methanol is added.<br>
Example 9<br>
In this example, the petroleum feedstock is a heavy petroleum feedstock, bitumen.<br>
Bitumen, in its raw state, is a black, asphalt-like oil which has a consistency similar to molasses.<br>
Density of the bitumen samples was in the range of 0.97-1.00 g/cm3; molecular mass was 400-500<br>
g/mole; kinematic viscosity at 50°C was in the range 170-180 cSt; sulfur concentration was 1.6-<br>
1.8% (by mass). Bitumen cannot be used directly in most conventional refining operations and<br>
requires upgrading to produce a useful product. In fact bitumen is so viscous it cannot be<br>
transported via pipeline without upgrading or dilution. The bitumen petroleum feedstock is<br>
processed using CRC with the following parameters: pulse irradiation mode (pulse width of 5 us<br>
and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with an energy of 2 MeV in static conditions at<br>
room temperature of 50° C, a time averaged dose rate of 20-37 kGy/s and a total absorbed dose of<br>
radiation of 360 kGy. The total absorbed dose of radiation depends on the time of exposure of the<br>
petroleum feedstock to the radiation. Samples of petroleum feedstock were examined before CRC<br>
processing and after 18 seconds exposure to the electron beam during CRC processing (total<br>
absorbed electron dose equal to 360 kGy) and chromatograms were prepared.<br>
The results are displayed in FIG. 11. In FIG. 11, the results are displayed as changes in the<br>
fractional contents (as determined by boiling point ranges of the petroleum feedstock before<br>
(darker bars) and after treatment (lighter bars). FIG. 11 shows that although the degree of<br>
bitumen feedstock conversion is somewhat lower than that observed after processing of the<br>
petroleum feedstocks comprising lighter hydrocarbon chains (see Examples 3-7), CRC processing<br>
significantly altered the hydrocarbon chain length in the fractional contents of the bitumen<br><br>
feedstock. As can be seen in FIG. 11, the exposure to the electron beam led to an increase in the<br>
amount of shorter chain hydrocarbon products as indicated by an increase in the components in<br>
the lower boiling point fractions. As demonstrated in Examples 3-7, the content of the heaviest<br>
hydrocarbon fractions was reduced after CRC processing.<br>
Concentration of the total sulfur in the fractions that compose motor fuels (fractions<br>
boiling out at temperatures less than 350°C) decreased more than two-fold after CRC processing<br>
compared with sulfur concentration in the products of primary thermal distillation of the original<br>
bitumen petroleum feedstock.<br>
The degree of petroleum feedstock conversion was determined as described in Example7.<br>
In this example, the degree of the petroleum feedstock conversion increases proportionally to the<br>
time of exposure, reaching 45% conversion (by mass) after 18 seconds of radiation processing;<br>
the rate of conversion is 2.5 % per second.<br>
The elemental balance of the overall product of bitumen radiation processing is shown in<br>
Table 5. Table 5 shows that water present in the organic part of bitumen compensates for<br>
hydrogen deficiency. The formation of light hydrocarbons in the reactions described herein<br>
requires increased hydrogen concentrations in the light fractions. In heavy petroleum feedstocks,<br>
such as, but not limited to, bitumen, the yields of the light fractions are limited by the high C/H<br>
ratios. High yields of light fractions after radiation processing of such extremely heavy petroleum<br>
feedstock is possible due to water originally present or specially added to bitumen. In this<br>
example, the petroleum feedstock contained 6% (by mass) water.<br>
Example 10<br>
In this example, two types of petroleum feedstock were used: the first feedstock was as<br>
described in Example 3 (Sample 1) and the second feedstock was as described in Example 4<br>
(Sample 2). Sample 1 was processed using CRC as described above using the following<br>
parameters: continuous irradiation mode using electrons with an energy of 2 MeV in static<br>
conditions at a temperature of 50° C and a time averaged dose rate of 80 kGy/s. Sample 2 was<br>
processed in the same conditions but using the time averaged dose rate of 120 kGy/s. The total<br>
absorbed dose of radiation depends on the time of exposure of the petroleum feedstock to the<br>
radiation. For FIG. 12A (Sample 1) the total absorbed dose of radiation was 100 kGy; for FIG.<br>
12B (Sample 2) the total absorbed dose of radiation was 50 kGy.<br>
The results are displayed in FIG. 12A for Sample 1 and FIG.l IB for Sample 2. In FIGS.<br>
12A and 12B, the results are displayed as changes in the fractional contents (as determined by<br>
boiling point ranges) of the petroleum feedstock before (darkest bars) and after treatment (lighter<br>
bars) at the time points indicated.<br><br>
Comparison of FIGS. 12A and 12B shows that nearly the same degree of oil conversion<br>
(about 50% by mass) can be attained at the dose rate of 80 kGy/s and total dose of 100 kGy or at<br>
the dose rate of 120 kGy/s and total dose of 50 kGy. According to the dependence of the cracking<br>
reaction on the dose rate characteristic for the process of the present disclosure the ratio of these<br>
two doses must be (120 kGy/s / 80 kGy/s)3/2 that is approximately equal to 1.8. Therefore, the<br>
experimentally observed dose ratio is in accordance with the concepts provided in the present<br>
disclosure.<br>
Fig. 13 shows degree of petroleum feedstock conversion as a function of irradiation time<br>
for Sample 1. In this example, the degree of the petroleum feedstock conversion increases<br>
proportionally to the time of exposure reaching about 50% conversion (by mass) after 3 seconds<br>
of radiation processing; the rate of conversion is about 17% per second. Similar results were<br>
obtained for Sample 2. For the both types of petroleum feedstocks these dependences are similar,<br>
It confirms that the CRC process is generally applicable to a variety of petroleum feedstocks.<br>
Example 11<br>
In this example, the petroleum feedstock is fuel oil (020 — 0, 975 g/cm3 (13.5 API), uioo = 9<br>
cSt, Stoiai = 2.9 mass%, Pour point - 28° C, Coking ability —14.2%). The petroleum feedstock was<br>
preheated to 150° C (heating was not maintained during CRC, which was carried out at 50° C) and<br>
irradiated in CRC mode in flow conditions (with the flow rate of 60.1 kg/hr in a layer 2 mm thick)<br>
using the following parameters: pulse irradiation (pulse width of 5 u,s and pulse frequency of 200<br>
s"') using electrons with energy of 2 MeV at the time averaged dose rate of 6 kGy/s. The<br>
feedstock was continuously bubbled with ionized air supplied into the reactor during radiation<br>
processing. The total absorbed dose of radiation depends on the time of exposure of the petroleum<br>
feedstock to the radiation. For FIG. 14 the total absorbed dose of radiation was 1.6 kGy.<br>
In this example, the limiting dose of irradiation as defined by stability of the petroleum<br>
commodity products and the rate of cracking reaction were regulated by feedstock preheating and<br>
continuous supply of ionized air into the reactor.<br>
As a result of the CRC processing as described in this example, the degree of the feedstock<br>
conversion, defined as described in Example 7, reached 53% after irradiation with the dose of 1.6<br>
kGy (FIG.14). The same result could be obtained in static conditions (see Example 9) at a total<br>
absorbed dose about 60 times higher and the dose rate about 15-20 times higher compared with<br>
irradiation parameters used on this example.<br>
Example 12<br>
In this example, the petroleum feedstock was high-viscous oil, as described in Example 3.<br>
The feedstock was preheated to 110°C and irradiated in CRC mode in flow conditions (with the<br>
average linear flow rate of 20 cm/s in a layer 2 mm thick) using the following parameters: pulse<br><br>
irradiation (pulse width of 5 u.s and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with energy of 2<br>
MeV at the time averaged dose rate of 6 kGy/s. Feedstock preheating was necessary for lower oil<br>
viscosity and the higher rate of its passage under the electron beam in a thin layer. The total<br>
absorbed dose of radiation depends on the time of exposure of the petroleum feedstock to the<br>
radiation. For FIG. 15 the total absorbed dose of radiation was 10-60 kGy. -<br>
The petroleum feedstock was not heated during irradiation. The temperature of the liquid<br>
product accumulated in the receiving tank after processing was 30-40° C. The products were<br>
analyzed in 3-10 hours after processing.<br>
FIG. 15 shows that the degree of oil conversion as defined in Example 7, was about 48% at<br>
the dose of 10 kGy and slowly changed with the dose reaching 52% at the dose value of 60 kGy.<br>
However, the commodity petroleum products obtained by irradiation with total absorbed<br>
doses higher than 10 kGy were unstable; their hydrocarbon contents changed in a time-dependent<br>
manner with higher total absorbed doses of irradiation. The liquid CRC commodity petroleum<br>
products obtained by irradiation with the total absorbed dose of lOkGy at 6kGy/s demonstrated<br>
high stability (FIG. 16). FIG. 16 shows that its hydrocarbon content has not changed after 30 days<br>
of exposure.<br>
In this example, the total absorbed dose of 10 kGy is the limiting dose of irradiation and<br>
limits the product stability. FIG. 17 shows that it also limits the yields of stable commodity<br>
petroleum products. Each of the higher total absorbed dose indicated in FIG. 17 was obtained by<br>
dose fractionation. A part of the liquid product was taken for analysis after each of the subsequent<br>
irradiations. The liquid commodity petroleum products obtained by irradiation with a total dose of<br>
10 kGy is characteristic for the highest concentration in the overall commodity petroleum product<br>
and the highest stability. To make yields of light fractions still higher other irradiation conditions<br>
(the dose rate, external treatment for changes in the feedstock original structure or the form of<br>
feedstock supply to the reactor) may also be varied.<br>
Example 13<br>
In this example, the petroleum feedstock was high-paraffin crude oil (Density P20 — 0.864<br>
g/cm3 (32 API), H50 = 18,8 mm2/s, Stot = 
18 %,Paraffins - 20% and Coking ability — 3.5%). High-paraffin crude oils axe characterized by<br>
high solidification temperature. Radiation processing of this type of oil is directed to enabling the<br>
long-distance transportation of this petroleum feedstock through pipelines in different climatic<br>
conditions without application of complicated and expensive system for oil heating over all the<br>
distance of transportation. Together with high content of heavy paraffins, the high-paraffin crude<br>
oil petroleum feedstock considered in this example is characterized by high concentrations of<br>
pitches and asphaltenes.<br><br>
The petroleum feedstock was preheated to 35°C and irradiated in CRC mode in flow<br>
conditions (with the flow rate of 30 kg/hour in a layer 2 mm thick) using the following<br>
parameters: pulse irradiation (pulse width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s"') using electrons<br>
with energy of 2 MeV at the time averaged dose rate of 5.2 kGy/s. The total absorbed dose of<br>
radiation depends on the time of exposure of the petroleum feedstock to the-radiation.<br>
FIG. 18 illustrates fractional contents of fee products of high-paraffin oil CRC processing<br>
obtained in flow conditions for different irradiation doses. It shows that the highest conversion<br>
degree and the highest yields of light fractions are observed after CRC processing with a total<br>
absorbed dose of 8.5 kGy. Increase in the total absorbed dose over 10 kGy not only reduces the<br>
yields of light fractions but also degrades stability of the liquid petroleum commodity products<br>
due to accumulation of the reactive polymerizing residue. Similar to Example 10 for the high<br>
viscous oil, the limiting dose or irradiation as defined by product yields and stability is about 10<br>
kGy for the given CRC processing conditions.<br>
Heating of high-paraffinic oil to high temperatures characteristic for RTC provokes<br>
thermal activation of intense polymerization that reduces yields of light fractions and makes them<br>
instable. Therefore, CRC processing at heightened dose rates is most effective and profitable for<br>
high-paraffin oil upgrading or deep processing in industrial scales.<br>
Example 14<br>
In this example, the feedstock was high-paraffin fuel oil, which is a product of high-<br>
paraffin crude oil primary distillation (Density P20, 0.925 g/cm3 ( 21 API), Sulfur content<br>
16.8 cSt ). This type of petroleum feedstock is especially difficult for traditional methods of oil<br>
processing; due to the presence of high-molecular paraffins, which results in a very high pour<br>
point (+45°C).<br>
The feedstock was preheated to 60°C and irradiated in CRC mode in flow conditions (with<br>
the flow rate of 30 kg/hour in a layer 2 mm thick) vising the following parameters: pulse<br>
irradiation (pulse width of 5 us and pulse frequency of 200 s-1) using electrons with energy of 2<br>
MeV at the time averaged dose rate of 5.2 kGy/s. The irradiation dose was 24 kGy. In addition,<br>
CRC processing was also accomplished using the above parameters in static mode at the time<br>
averaged dose rate of 20 kGy/s. The irradiation dose was 300 kGy<br>
Comparison of the efficiencies of CRC processing in flow and static conditions is given in<br>
FIG. 19. The comparison shows that flow • conditions provide a considerably higher effect<br>
compared with static conditions even at much lower total doses and dose rates of electron<br>
irradiation. In flow conditions, an increase in the dose rate up to 20 kGy/s will cause almost 6<br>
times higher degree of the petroleum feedstock conversion.<br><br>
Example 15<br>
In this example, the same petroleum feedstock was used as described in Example 3 and the<br>
parameters used were as set forth in Example 10 for Sample 1 with the difference that instead of<br>
static conditions, the petroleum feedstock was atomized inside the reactor vessel and was<br>
irradiated in a dispersed form up to the dose of 3.2 kGy.<br>
The results are displayed in FIGS. 20A and 20B. FIG. 20A displays the results as changes<br>
in the fractional contents as determined by the number of carbon atoms in a molecule of the<br>
petroleum feedstock before (darker line) and after treatment (lighter line) and FIG. 20B displays<br>
the results as changes in the boiling point ranges of the petroleum feedstock before (darker bars)<br>
and after treatment (lighter bars). As can be seen in FIGS. 20A and 20B, the yield of lighter (i.e.<br>
short chain) hydrocarbon fractions (indicated by the lower number of carbon atoms in the<br>
molecule, FIG. 20A, and lower boiling points, FIG. 20B) is increased and the yield of heavier (i.e.<br>
long chain and residue) hydrocarbon fractions is decreased. In this Example, the rate of<br>
conversion increased more than 50-fold as compared to the rate observed in Example 10.<br>
Furthermore, a degree of conversion of 80% is attained in this example at a dose of 3.2 kGy that<br>
corresponds to commercial requirements to the highly economic radiation processing. The rate of<br>
conversion is 1.25 mass % per millisecond.<br><br>
