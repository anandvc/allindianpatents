				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Background of the invention	<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing aloe-emodin from aloin.<br>
Further there is provided a process for preparing rhein and diacerein from aloin.<br>
Diacerein is known as being useful in the treatment of diseases associated with<br>
an abnormal degeneration of the connective tissue, and more particularly in the<br>
treatment of inflammatory states of the joints and of the connective tissue such<br>
as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and osteoporosis, of acute respiratory<br>
syndrome in adults, or of pulmonary emphysema.<br>
The most known process for preparing diacerein from aloin comprises acetylation<br>
of aloin and subsequent chromic oxidation of the acetylated product to obtain<br>
diacerein.<br>
For example, WO-A-98 56750 (Synteco) discloses a process for preparing<br>
diacerein from aloin which comprises acetylating aloin to obtain acetylbarbaloin,<br>
oxidizing acetylbarbaloin with an oxidizing agent consisting of chromic anhydride<br>
in acetic acid solution to obtain crude diacerein and subsequently purifying crude<br>
diacerein.<br>
In such a process, the chromic oxidation occurs only if aloin used as the starting<br>
material has a high degree of purity.<br>
Further, use of hexavalent chromium compounds such as chromic anhydride<br>
(CrO3) is subjected to stringent regulations in view of their very high toxicity and<br>
carcinogenicity, as well as on their harmful effect on the environment and at the<br>
present time, and in the future authorities may limit the use of hexavalent<br>
chromium compounds in the industry.<br><br>
Still further, to reach a purity of pharmaceutical grade, crude diacerein obtained<br>
by chromic oxidation of acetylbarbaloin must be subjected to a subsequent<br>
purification process for obtaining a diacerein substantially free from impurities,<br>
and more particularly free from aloe-emodin and free from any traces of<br>
chromium.<br>
However, purification of crude diacerein to obtain diacerein free from aloe-<br>
emodin and free from chromium residues is known to be particularly critical.<br>
Therefore, many processes have been proposed in the literature for purifying<br>
crude diacerein obtained by chromic oxidation of acetylbarbaloin (see for<br>
example EP-A-0 636 602 (Laboratoire Medidom), WO-A-00/68179 (Synteco),<br>
WO-A-98/56750 (Synteco), WO-A-01/96276 (Synteco), WO-A-2004/050601<br>
(Synteco)).<br>
However, known processes for purifying crude diacerein obtained by chromic<br>
oxidation of acetylbarbaloin suffer from several drawbacks in that they are<br>
complex multi-step processes and/or use toxic solvents or reagents, and/or<br>
provoke a remarkable decrease in the yield of pure diacerein with respect to<br>
crude diacerein.<br>
As an alternative to preparing diacerein from aloin via the acetylation of aloin to<br>
obtain acetylbarbaloin, there have been proposed in the literature processes for<br>
the preparation of diacerein starting from aloe-emodin. For example there has<br>
been described the preparation of diacerein via oxidation with hexavalent<br>
chromium of aloe-emodin ("Sostanze farmaceutiche", Italian translation and<br>
review by R. Longo. OEMF, Milan, 1988, p.596, of "Pharmazeutische Wirkstoffe,<br>
Synthesen, Patente, Anwedungen", George Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart-New York,<br>
1982-1987).<br>
In the literature there have been described processes for the preparation of aloe-<br>
emodin by semi-synthetic preparative processes. Chen When-Ho et al. (Journal<br>
of Nanjing College of Pharmacy, 1986, 17(1), 1-4; Chemical Abstract, Vol. 105,<br><br>
1986, 105:226138z), and US Patent 5,652,265 of Vittori et al., describe the<br>
preparation of aloe-emodin by treatment of aloin with FeCl3.<br>
However known processes for the preparation of aloe-emodin suffer from several<br>
drawbacks, in that the known synthetic processes require the use of metallic<br>
reagents, or other harmful or toxic substances, and require complicated<br>
purification processes to remove residues of the metallic or otherwise harmful<br>
reagents.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Therefore, there is a need for a process for preparing aloe-emodin from aloin<br>
which does not require the use of toxic or harmful substances, which does not<br>
require complex purification processes and which provides aloe-emodin with a<br>
good yield and level of purity.<br>
There is also a need for a process for preparing diacerein from aloin which does<br>
not comprise chromic oxidation and which does not require complex purification<br>
process.<br>
After extensive studies, the present inventors have found that aloe-emodin may<br>
be easily and advantageously prepared from crude aloin without the need for<br>
chromium compounds or other toxic or harmful substances, using a process<br>
which can be easily scaled up to industrial level.<br>
The present invention has been achieved on the basis of these results.<br>
Disclosed herein is a process for preparing aloe-emodin from aloin comprising<br>
treating aloin with an oxygen-containing gas in the presence of an acid. The acid<br>
used in oxidizing aloin is preferably nitric acid or sulphuric acid.<br>
The aloin is advantageously dissolved in a polyhydric alcohol, preferably ethylene<br>
glycol or propylene glycol, before treatment with the oxygen-containing gas.<br><br>
Preferably, the aloin is dissolved in the polyhydric alcohol at a concentration up to<br>
70 % w/v.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aloin used is crude aloin<br>
extracted from Aloe-Vera comprising at least 1 % pure aloin, and preferably from<br>
30 to 50 % pure aloin.<br>
Preferably, oxidation of the aloin is carried out at a temperature ranging from 100<br>
to 120Â°C, under an oxygen-saturated atmosphere.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the oxygen-containing gas is<br>
preferably selected from a group including oxygen gas and air.<br>
The aloe-emodin may be advantageously prepared from crude aloin, e.g. as<br>
extracted from Aloe-Vera.<br>
Advantageously, aloe-emodin may be obtained from aloin by the present process<br>
without the need for metallic reagents, avoiding the need for complex purification<br>
processes to remove residual metal ions.<br>
Further disclosed is a process for preparing rhein or diacerein from the thus-<br>
obtained aloe-emodin, comprising the steps of oxidizing the aloe-emodin by<br>
treatment with a chromium-free oxidizing medium to obtain rhein, and purifying<br>
the rhein.<br>
The chromium-free oxidizing medium may include a salt of nitrous acid,<br>
advantageously sodium nitrite. The chromium-free oxidizing medium may<br>
advantageously further include boric acid dissolved in sulphuric acid, whereby<br>
the oxidation is preferably carried out at a temperature ranging from 110 to<br>
130Â°C.<br>
The purification of rhein may advantageously be performed by liquid-liquid<br>
partition between an apolar aprotic organic solvent which is not miscible in water<br>
and an aqueous phase having a pH in the range from 9 to 9.5.<br><br>
Preferably, in the step of purification of rhein, the apolar aprotic organic solvent<br>
which is not miscible in water is selected from toluene and dichloromethane. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention, purification by liquid-liquid<br>
partition is carried out by means of a continuous liquid-liquid extraction.<br>
The rhein obtained may be acetylated by treatment with an acetylating agent,<br>
preferably acetic anhydride, to obtain diacerein.<br>
Advantageously rhein and diacerein may thus be obtained from aloin, via<br>
oxidation to aloe-emodin, without carrying out chromium oxidation.<br>
Other objects and advantageous features of the present invention will be<br>
apparent from the claims and the following detailed description and examples.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The process of the present invention comprises oxidizing aloin represented by<br>
the following formula (I):<br><br>
to obtain aloe-emodin represented by the following formula (II):<br><br><br>
The aloin is oxidized by treatment with an oxygen-containing gas in a reaction<br>
medium in the presence of an acid.<br>
According to the present invention, the degree of purity of aloin as the starting<br>
material is not critical.<br>
Therefore, it must be understood that in the present application, the term "aloin"<br>
is intended to mean aloin having any degree of purity, unless otherwise is<br>
indicated.<br>
As an example, aloin as the starting material may be pure aloin, commercial aloin<br>
or crude aloin, preferably crude aloin in the form of an extract from different plant<br>
species containing at least 1 % pure aloin, and more preferably crude aloin<br>
extracted from Aloe species containing at least 30% pure aloin, for example from<br>
30 to 50 % pure aloin.<br>
Using crude aloin extracted from Aloe containing from 30 to 50 % pure aloin is<br>
particularly advantageous from the point of view of production costs.<br>
For the oxidation reaction any suitable reaction medium may be used. A suitable<br>
reaction medium includes any solvent in which aloin is soluble to form a stable<br>
solution and which is capable of supporting the temperature required for the<br>
oxidation reaction. Advantageously the reaction medium is an organic solvent.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention the reaction medium is a<br>
polyhydric alcohol. The polyhydric alcohol used as the reaction medium may be<br>
any polyhydric alcohol which dissolves aloin. Preferably, polyhydric alcohols used<br>
for dissolving aloin are dihydric alcohols such as ethylene glycol, propylene<br><br>
glycol, 1,4-butane-diol, 1,5-pentane-diol and trihydric alcohols such as glycerol,<br>
manitol, sorbitol, without being limited to these.<br>
Polyhydric alcohols are particularly suitable as a reaction medium as aloin<br>
dissolves readily in polyhydric alcohols, oxygen is readily soluble in polyhydric<br>
alcohols at the temperature at which the oxidation reaction is carried out, and<br>
aloe-emodin is poorly soluble in polyhydric alcohols. Further, the polyhydric<br>
alcohols are capable of supporting the temperatures at which the oxidation<br>
reaction is carried out, and are inert to the oxidation reaction.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, polyhydric alcohol used for<br>
dissolving aloin is selected from ethylene glycol, propylene glycol and glycerol.<br>
Ethylene glycol is preferred due to its low toxicity, relatively high flash point of<br>
111Â°C, and low industrial cost.<br>
Preferably, crude aloin is dissolved in the polyhydric alcohol at a concentration up<br>
70 % w/v.<br>
In order to proceed with the oxidation of aloin in the presence of an acid, an acid<br>
is added slowly to the aloin-containing solution, preferably under an inert<br>
atmosphere, for example nitrogen or argon atmosphere, before carrying out the<br>
oxidation.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the aloin-containing solution<br>
may be heated at a temperature in the range from 80 - 160Â°C, more preferably at<br>
a temperature in the range from 100 - 120Â°C.<br>
Preferably, the acid is a strong mineral acid, and may be for example nitric acid,<br>
sulphuric acid, trichloroacetic acid or perchloric acid. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the acid is selected from nitric acid and sulphuric acid. The acid is preferably<br>
added in an amount ranging from 0.1 to 5 molar equivalents with respect to pure<br>
aloin content.<br><br>
Oxidation of aloin dissolved in the polyhydric alcohol with an oxygen-containing<br>
gas in the presence of an acid may be carried out for example by introducing the<br>
oxygen-containing gas in a continuous way into the heated solution or by putting<br>
the heated solution under an oxygen-containing gas over-pressure. Preferably<br>
the oxidation reaction is carried out under an oxygen-containing gas over-<br>
pressure. The oxygen-containing gas is preferably oxygen gas or air.<br>
Where oxidation of aloin is carried out by subjecting the heated aloin solution to a<br>
gas over-pressure of oxygen, the gas pressure in the reaction chamber may<br>
suitably be 0.1 - 6 bar absolute pressure, preferably 1.2-2 bar, for example 1.5<br>
bar. If the oxidation is carried out by subjecting the heated aloin solution to a gas<br>
over-pressure of air, the reaction is preferably carried out under a gas pressure of<br>
1.2-10 bar absolute pressure, preferably 2 - 2.5 bar.<br>
The reaction time will depend on the reaction conditions. Oxidation of aloin<br>
under an oxygen-containing gas over-pressure may generally be carried out over<br>
3-12 hours preferably 4-6 hours.<br>
If oxidation of aloin is carried out by introducing air in a continuous way into the<br>
heated solution, air is preferably introduced into the heated solution at a flow rate<br>
of 5 - 50 L/min.<br>
If oxidation of aloin is carried out by introducing oxygen gas in a continuous way<br>
into the heated solution, oxygen gas is preferably introduced into the heated<br>
solution at a flow rate of 1 -10 L/min.<br>
The reaction time of the oxidation will depend on the reaction conditions.<br>
Determination of the reaction time and the degree of conversion of aloin to aloe-<br>
emodin may be obtained by conventional techniques of analysis, for example<br>
HPLC.<br><br>
As an example, a study of the influence of the amount of oxygen gas<br>
continuously introduced into a heated aloin-containing solution has been carried<br>
out.<br>
The heated aloin-containing solution used in this study has been prepared by<br>
dissolving 72 g crude aloin containing 39 % pure aloin in 250 ml ethylene glycol,<br>
pouring the solution into a one-liter reactor, warming it to 120Â°C in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere and adding over 20 minutes 7.58 g HNO3 diluted in 50 ml ethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
Oxygen gas at various flow rates was introduced into said heated aloin-<br>
containing solution and samples were withdrawn every hour from the reaction<br>
mixture and analyzed by HPLC.<br>
The results are summarized in Table 1 below.<br><br>
From Table 1, it can be seen that in the above specific conditions, the maximum<br>
yield of oxidation of aloin into aloe-emodin occurs after 5-6 hours if oxygen is<br>
introduced at a flow rate ranging from 2 to 4 [L/min].<br>
The oxidation reaction will be usually followed by a conventional treatment of the<br>
reaction mixture to isolate aloe-emodin. This may comprise for example pouring<br>
the reaction mixture into water, extracting aloe-emodin using an organic solvent,<br><br>
for example toluene or dichloromethane, precipitating aloe-emodin in an alcohol,<br>
for example ethanol, filtering aloe-emodin and drying aloe-emodin.<br>
The isolation of aloe-emodin from the reaction mixture may advantageously<br>
comprise extraction and purification by liquid-liquid partition, which may be<br>
followed by crystallization of the aloe-emodin in pure form.<br>
For the extraction and purification the oxidized reaction mixture may preferably<br>
first be filtered and washed. The washing may advantageously comprise<br>
washing with excess reaction medium, e.g. polyhydric alcohol, to remove residual<br>
compounds soluble therein, and washing with water to remove any residual<br>
reaction medium, e.g. polyhydric alcohol. Additionally the filtrate may be washed<br>
with aqueous solution with pH adjusted to pH 9-11 to remove residual<br>
compounds soluble in water at basic pH.<br>
Aloe-emodin may then be extracted by solvent extraction using any suitable<br>
organic solvent in which aloe-emodin is soluble, for example methylene chloride<br>
or toluene. The solvent solution containing aloe-emodin is subjected to a liquid-<br>
liquid partitioning with an aqueous buffered solution, pH adjusted to pH 9 to 11,<br>
preferably pH 10. A pH above 11 is not suitable as at such a pH aloe-emodin is<br>
soluble in aqueous solution and would be lost. Any buffer having a pK in the<br>
range of 9 - 11 may be used, for instance glycine buffer, KCI-boric acid-NaOH<br>
buffer, carbonate buffer, CHES (2-(N-Cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid)<br>
buffer, CAPSO (3-(Cyclohexylamino)-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid) buffer,<br>
AMP (2-Amino-2-Methyl-1-propanol) buffer, CAPS (3-(Cyclohexylamino)-1-<br>
propanesulfonic acid) buffer. The aloe-emodin containing solvent solution is then<br>
subjected to a second liquid-liquid partitioning step with an alkaline aqueous<br>
solution. The pH of the aqueous solution is adjusted to above pH 11 with an<br>
organic base. The organic base may be an alkaline metal hydroxide, such as<br>
sodium hydroxide.<br>
The liquid-liquid extraction may for example be a batch liquid-liquid extraction or<br>
a continuous liquid-liquid extraction. If said liquid-liquid extraction is a batch<br><br>
liquid-liquid extraction, it is preferably repeated until aloe-emodin having the<br>
required degree of purity is obtained. If the liquid-liquid extraction is a continuous<br>
liquid-liquid extraction, it is preferably continued until aloe-emodin having the<br>
required degree of purity is obtained. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the liquid-liquid extraction is a continuous liquid-liquid extraction.<br>
Advantageously, the extraction solvent can be recovered and recycled for further<br>
use in the extraction process.<br>
The liquid-liquid extraction may be followed by a conventional treatment of the<br>
aqueous phase to isolate pure aloe-emodin. This may comprise, for example,<br>
acidifying the basic aqueous phase containing aloe-emodin with an inorganic<br>
acid, such as hydrochloric acid, to precipitate aloe-emodin, filtration, washing with<br>
purified water, and drying the aloe-emodin,<br>
Aloe-emodin obtained according to the process of the present invention has a<br>
purity degree of 95 % or more, generally about 98.0 - 99.5 %.<br>
According to the one embodiment of the present invention, aloe-emodin<br>
produced by the above-described oxidation of aloin, may be oxidized to obtain<br>
rhein represented by the following formula (III):<br><br>
Aloe-emodin is advantageously oxidized in a chromium-free oxidizing medium.<br>
The step of oxidation of aloe-emodin to rhein in a chromium-free oxidizing<br>
medium may be carried out by known methods, for instance as described in EP 0<br>
928 781 A1, Laboratoire Medidom S.A. The chromium-free oxidizing medium<br>
may comprise a salt of nitrous acid, in particular an inorganic salt, such as salts<br><br>
of alkaline or alkaline-earth metals, for instance sodium nitrite, potassium nitrite,<br>
or calcium nitrite. Preferably, sodium nitrite is used.<br>
The reaction medium preferably comprises an acid, for example a mineral acid,<br>
in particular a strong mineral acid, such as sulphuric acid or boric acid, or<br>
alternatively a carboxylic acid, possibly halogenated, such as acetic acid,<br>
trichloro-acetic acid, or a sulphonic acid, such as methanesulphonic acid. The<br>
chromium-free oxidizing medium comprises preferably sodium nitrite dissolved in<br>
sulphuric acid, optionally with the addition of boric acid.<br>
The oxidation may be carried out for example by adding slowly aloe-emodin to<br>
the chromium-free oxidizing medium comprising, for instance, sodium nitrite<br>
dissolved in sulphuric acid, or sodium nitrite dissolved in sulphuric acid and boric<br>
acid, to obtain crude rhein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the chromium-free oxidizing medium comprising<br>
sodium nitrite dissolved in sulphuric acid, and optionally boric acid, is heated at a<br>
temperature in the range from 80 - 160Â°C, and more preferably in the range from<br>
110 - 130Â°C, before the addition of aloe-emodin.<br>
The reaction time will depend on the reaction conditions and will usually lie in the<br>
range from 2 to 4 hours.<br>
The oxidation reaction may be followed by a conventional treatment of the<br>
reaction mixture to isolate crude rhein. This may comprise for example pouring<br>
the reaction mixture into distilled water at 2Â°C to precipitate rhein, filtering rhein,<br>
washing rhein with distilled water at 2Â°C and drying rhein.<br>
The purity of rhein obtained by the chromium-free oxidation of aloe-emodin is<br>
dependant on the purity of the starting aloe-emodin. Rhein obtained by the<br>
above chromium-free oxidation process according to the invention, from aloe-<br>
emodin prepared by the oxidation of aloin according to the process of the present<br>
invention has a purity degree of around 90% - 95%.<br><br>
In order to remove all aloe-emodin residues and other contaminants, rhein<br>
obtained by the above oxidation process is subjected to a purification step.<br>
This purification step advantageously comprises purifying rhein by liquid-liquid<br>
partition between an aprotic apolar organic solvent which is not miscible in water<br>
and an aqueous phase having a pH in the range from 7,5 to 11. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the pH is in the range from 9 to 9,5.<br>
In the purification step, the rhein obtained by oxidation of aloe-emodin will<br>
preferably first be put into water to obtain an aqueous solution containing rhein.<br>
Preferably, the aqueous solution contains 10 mg rhein per 1 ml water.<br>
After dissolution of rhein into water, the pH of the aqueous solution containing<br>
rhein is adjusted to a pH value ranging from 9 to 9.5 with an inorganic base. The<br>
inorganic base may be for example an alkaline metal hydroxide such as sodium<br>
hydroxide or potassium hydroxide. In a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention, said inorganic base is sodium hydroxide, and more preferably<br>
sodium hydroxide 5M.<br>
The aqueous solution containing rhein and having a pH in the range from 9 to 9.5<br>
is subjected to a liquid-liquid extraction with an aprotic apolar organic solvent<br>
which is not miscible in water. The aprotic apolar organic solvent which is not<br>
miscible in water may be for example toluene, dichloromethane, hexane,<br>
heptane, pentane, ether, tetrahydrofurane (THF). In a particularly preferred<br>
embodiment, said aprotic apolar organic solvent which is not miscible in water is<br>
toluene or dichloromethane:<br>
The liquid-liquid extraction may for example be a batch liquid-liquid extraction or<br>
a continuous liquid-liquid extraction. If said liquid-liquid extraction is a batch<br>
liquid-liquid extraction, it is preferably repeated until rhein having the required<br>
degree of purity is obtained. If the liquid-liquid extraction is a continuous liquid-<br>
liquid extraction, it is preferably continued until rhein having the required degree<br><br>
of purity is obtained. The required degree of purity of rhein will depend on the<br>
subsequent use of rhein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the liquid-liquid extraction is<br>
a continuous liquid-liquid extraction which is continued until the rhein contains<br>
less than 2 ppm of aloe-emodin (HPLC).<br>
The liquid-liquid extraction will be usually followed by a conventional treatment of<br>
the aqueous phase to isolate pure rhein. This may comprise for example<br>
acidifying the aqueous phase containing pure rhein until pH 1 with an inorganic<br>
acid, for example hydrochloric acid, to precipitate rhein, filtering rhein, washing<br>
rhein with distilled water at 2Â°C and drying rhein.<br>
If needed, the thus produced rhein may be further acetylated according to an<br>
optional acetylation step to obtain diacerein as represented by the following<br>
formula (IV):<br><br>
The acetylation of rhein may be carried out by treatment of rhein with an<br>
acetylating reagent which can be chosen from those known to the person skilled<br>
in the art. However, in a preferred embodiment, the acetylating agent is acetic<br>
anhydride.<br>
The acetylation may be carried out in various organic solvents provided that they<br>
are inert, or in any case compatible with the reaction conditions such a glacial<br>
acetic acid. However, in a preferred embodiment, acetic anhydride is used as the<br>
reaction solvent.<br><br>
Acetylation of rhein with acetic anhydride is preferably carried out in the presence<br>
of an acid as a catalyst. In a preferred embodiment, said acid used as a catalyst<br>
is sulphuric acid.<br>
Acetylation of rhein with acetic anhydride is preferably carried out at a<br>
temperature ranging from 20 to 50 Â°C, more preferably, from 30 to 40Â°C, for 3 to<br>
6 hours, yet more preferably for 4 to 5 hours.<br>
The acetylation reaction will be usually followed by a conventional treatment of<br>
the reaction mixture to isolate diacerein. This may comprise for example pouring<br>
the reaction mixture in distilled water at 4Â°C, filtering diacerein, washing diacerein<br>
with distilled water and drying diacerein. If needed, diacerein may be further<br>
purified by recrystallization in a solvent such as ethanol, acetone or isopropanol<br>
or any other appropriate solvent.<br>
According to the process of the present invention, aloe-emodin may be prepared<br>
from aloin without the need for metallic reagents, or other toxic or harmful<br>
substances, and without the need for complex purification processes to remove<br>
residual metal ions. According to the process described herein aloe-emodin may<br>
be obtained from aloin at a good yield and level of purity.<br>
The process according to the invention is also economical since crude aloin may<br>
be used as the starting material, and inexpensive reagents and solvents may be<br>
used in the process. Moreover, the process is easy to carry out even in an<br>
industrial scale.<br>
According to the one embodiment of the present invention, rhein and diacerein<br>
may advantageously be obtained from aloin without carrying out chromium<br>
oxidation, and without using toxic or harmful reagents or solvents.<br>

PREPARATION OF ALOE-EMODIN FROM ALOIN<br>
Example 1<br>
Crude Aloin (72 g containing 39 % pure aloin) was dissolved in ethylene glycol<br>
(250 ml) . The solution was poured in a one-liter reactor and warmed at 120Â°C<br>
under nitrogen atmosphere. When the temperature of 120Â°C was reached, HNO3<br>
(7.58 g) diluted in ethylene glycol (50 ml) was added during 20 minutes. At this<br>
time, oxygen gas was introduced at a flow rate of 4 L/min by means of a sparger<br>
into the reactor. Samples were withdrawn every hour from reactor and analyzed<br>
by HPLC to determine the completion of the reaction. After 6 hours, the reaction<br>
was completed. Under these conditions, the conversion rate from aloin to aloe-<br>
emodin was 61 %.<br>
Isolation of aloe-emodin was then carried out by successively pouring the<br>
reaction mixture into water, extracting aloe-emodin with toluene or<br>
dichloromethane, evaporating toluene or dichloromethane, drying aloe-emodin<br>
(purity: 50%), precipitating aloe-emodin in ethanol, filtering aloe-emodin and<br>
drying aloe-emodin to obtain aloe-emodin 95 - 98 % pure. The yield was in a<br>
range of 75%-95%.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Under nitrogen atmosphere, crude Aloin (3.24Kg, containing 36% pure aloin) was<br>
dissolved in ethylene glycol (13.5 I). Under continuous agitation 170g of nitric<br>
acid (dissolved in ethylene glycol) were added over 5 minutes. The solution<br>
warmed to a temperature of 105Â°C. At this time nitrogen was washed out by the<br>
introduction of oxygen flow for 10 minutes. The reactor was then pressurized by<br>
the introduction of oxygen up to a pressure of 1.5 bars absolute pressure. The<br>
oxygen pressure was maintained at 1.5 bars absolute pressure for 5 hours. The<br>
reactor was then depressurized to ambient pressure and cooled to room<br>
temperature. Under these conditions, the conversion rate from aloin to aloe-<br>
emodin was 80%.<br>
Isolation of aloe-emodin was then carried out. The reaction mixture containing<br>
aloe-emodin in suspension was passed through a stainless steel filter press<br>
under pressure (8 bars absolute for 1 hour). The filter cake was then washed<br>
with half volume (7 I) of ethylene glycol under pressure (8 bars absolute for 7-8<br>
hours), followed by purified water (8 bars absolute pressure for 2 hours), glycine<br>
buffer (0.1M at pH 10) for 20 min at 8 bars absolute pressure, and purified water<br>
(10 minutes at 8 bars absolute pressure). The filter cake was then partially dried<br>
by blowing with nitrogen at 11 bars absolute pressure.<br>
Methylene chloride was then passed through the filter cake in a continuous<br>
manner to extract aloe-emodin. The methylene chloride solution was added to<br>
an aqueous solution buffered with glycine 0.1 M at pH 10, and the liquids<br>
separated using a liquid-liquid centrifuge. Buffer solution was continuously<br>
recirculated until saturation, after which new buffer was constantly added and<br>
saturated buffer constantly washed out to maintain a steady concentration in the<br>
reaction vessel. The methylene chloride solution, still containing aloe-emodin,<br>
was then added to an aqueous solution containing NaOH 1M and the liquids<br>
separated using a liquid-liquid centrifuge. NaOH solution containing aloe-emodin<br>
was continuously recirculated until saturation, after saturation new NaOH 1M<br>
solution was constantly added and NaOH solution saturated with aloe-emodin<br><br>
constantly washed out and collected elsewhere to maintain a steady<br>
concentration in the reaction vessel.<br>
The solution of aloe-emodin in NaOH was then precipitated by the addition of<br>
hydrochloric acid. Fine orange needles of aloe-emodin were precipitated on<br>
lowering the pH to below 1. The precipitate was then filtered, washed with<br>
purified water and dried with hot nitrogen. The aloe-emodin obtained had a purity<br>
of 99%.<br>
OXIDATION OF ALOE-EMODIN TO RHEIN<br>
Example 3<br>
Oxidizing medium was prepared by dissolving sodium nitrite (255 g) in sulphuric<br>
acid (1.2 I). The oxidizing medium was heated to 120Â°C and then aloe-emodin<br>
(100 g) was added slowly thereto. After completion of the oxidation reaction (3<br>
hours), the reaction mixture was poured into distilled water (7.2 I) at 2Â°C to<br>
precipitate rhein, and rhein is filtered and dried. Rhein having a degree of purity<br>
of 90 - 95 % was obtained in a yield of more than 85 %.<br>
PURIFICATION OF RHEIN<br>
Example 4<br>
Crude rhein obtained in example 3 was put in water to obtain a solution having a<br>
concentration of rhein at 10 mg/ml. The pH was adjusted at 9 - 9.5 with sodium<br>
hydroxide sodium 5M. The basic aqueous phase obtained was continuously<br>
extracted with dichloromethane until a satisfactory degree of purity is obtained<br>
(
aqueous phase to adjust the pH to 1 in order to precipitate rhein. Precipitated<br>
rhein was filtered, washed with distilled water at 2Â°C and dried. Rhein 99.5%<br>
pure with a yield of 90 to 95% was obtained.<br>
PREPARATION OF DIACEREIN<br>
Example 5<br><br>
Purified rhein (90 g) obtained in example 4 was dissolved in acetic anhydride<br>
(6.48 I) and the solution was cooled at 0Â°C. Then sulphuric acid (64.8 ml) was<br>
added thereto and the reaction mixture was warmed at 30Â°C. After completion of<br>
the reaction (4-5 hours), the reaction mixture was poured into distilled water at<br>
4Â°C and the precipitated diacerein was filtered, washed with distilled water and<br>
dried. Diacerein was obtained in a yield of more than 90 %. The diacerein was<br>
recrystallized in ethanol. The diacerein obtained was more than 98% pure.<br><br>
