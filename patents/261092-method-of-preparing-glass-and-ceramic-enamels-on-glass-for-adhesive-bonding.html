ADHESIVE BONDING<br>
Claim of Benefit of Filing Date<br>
[0001] The present application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Application Serial No. 60/932,243, filed May 30, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference for all purposes.<br><br>
Field of invention<br>
[0002] The invention relates to a method of preparing a glass surface or a ceramic enamel frit on the surface of glass for adhesive bonding utilizing an alumina containing composition. The invention further relates to a method of bonding glass into a window frame wherein the glass or the ceramic enamel frit disposed on the glass is treated with an alumina containing composition prior to conzacwig the adhesive with the glass or ceramic enamel frit.<br><br>
'    Background of Invention<br>
[0003] Windows made from glass are often delivered with contaminants on the surface of the glass, such as silicone based materials. These contaminants can interfere with the bond of the adhesive used to bond the glass into a window frame. Glass windows often have disposed on the periphery of the window a ceramic enamel referred to as a frit. The ceramic enamel frit functions to block transmission of light to the adhesive used to bond the window into a structure and to enhance bonding of the adhesive to the window. The contaminants on the ceramic enamel frit located or. the glass window are conventionally removed using an abrasive pad. The problem is that the abrasive pad can damage the ceramic enamel frit.<br>
[0004] Several references disclose cleaning compoMtions which have been developed for cleaning glass, such as WO 2007/003584 to Sika; U.S. 4,808,329 to Henkel and U.S. 5,076,955 to Joh. A. Benckiser. Many cleaning solutions can damage the ceramic enamel frit surface, leave an undesired film or powder on the surface or interfere with the bonding of the adhesive to the glass or ceramic enamel frit surface,<br>
[0005] What is needed is a method of preparing the surface of the glass, including the surface where the ceramic enamel is located, which does not harm the ceramic enamel or the glass surface or interfere in the bonding of an adhesive to the glass or ceramic enamel surface. What is further needed is a method which enhances the bonding of the adhesive to the glass surface or the ceramic enamel frit.<br><br>
Summary of Invention<br>
[0006] In one embodiment, the invention is a method comprising contacting a composition comprising i) alumina particles having a particle size of about 1 to about 40 microns and a Mohs hardness of about 9.0 to about 9.5;<br>
ii)        one or more alkyl sulphates;<br>
iii)       one or more thickeners; and<br>
iv)       water with the surface of glass or a ceramic frit disposed on the surface of glass. The contacting can be performed by applying the composition to the surface of the glass or the ceramic frit using an application apparatus. In one embodiment, the composition further comprises a lubricant. In another embodiment, the composition further comprises one or more ethoxylated alcohols. In another embodiment, the composition further comprises one or more fragrances.<br>
[0007] In another embodiment, the method further comprises the step of treating the surface of the ceramic frit. In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises applying a glass primer system to the surface of the ceramic frit after applying the composition containing alumina particles. In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises applying an adhesive to the surface of the glass or to the ceramic enamel frit disposed the surface of the glass and contacting the glass with a second substrate wherein the adhesive is disposed between the glass or the ceramic enamel frit disposed on the glass and the second substrate.<br>
[0008] In another embodiment, the invention is a method of replacing a glass window in a structure which comprises a) removing the old glass window from the window frame; b) applying a composition comprising i) alumina particles having a particle size of about 1 to about 40 microns and a Mohs hardness of about 9.0 to about 9.5, ii) one or more alkyl sulphates, iii) one or more thickeners, and iv) water; to the surface of a glass replacement window or a ceramic frit disposed on the surface of a replacement glass window. The method optionally further comprises c) cleaning the surface of the glass or the ceramic enamel frit surface with a cleaner; and/or d) applying a primer system to the surface of glass or the ceramic enamel frit. The method may further comprise e) applying a bead of adhesive to the glass window around the periphery of the glass window or ceramic frit; f)<br>
applying an activator system to the adhesive remaining on a flange of the window frame and<br>
-4-<br><br>
g) cpntacting the glass window with the window frame such that the adhesive is disposed between the glass window and the flange and that the adhesive forms a seal between the glass window and the window frame.<br>
[0009] The method of the invention can be used to bond windows into structures such as automobiles and buildings. The method allows preparing and bonding of windows without interfering with the bonding of the adhesive to the glass or ceramic enamel frit surface. The method further enhances the bonding of the adhesive to the glass or ceraniic enamel frit. In certain circumstances the method allows the adhesive to bond to the surface of the glass or the ceramic enamel frit without the need for one or both of the cleaning or priming steps. The method of the invention does not harm the glass or the ceramic enamel frit surface on the window.<br><br>

[0023] The method of the invention comprises applying the alumina<br>
composition to the surface of glass to enhance the bonding of an adhesive to the surface.<br>
The surface may be glass or glass with a ceramic enamel frit applied to the glass. The<br>
alumina composition can be applied by any means known for applying a liquid composition<br>
to a surface including applying it with an absorbent material, such as a cloth, a sponge, a felt<br>
-10-<br><br>
or a paper towel. The absorbent material is preferably saturated with the composition. Preferably, the absorbent material is lint free cloth. The composition can be applied and left on the surface of the glass or ceramic enamel frit or it can be removed with the use of a glass cleaner. The alumina composition can be applied at any temperature at which the alumina composition has suitable viscosity for application. The alumina composition is preferably applied at a temperature of about 0°C or greater, more preferably about 10°C or greater and mosi preferably about 20°C or greater. The alumina composition is preferably applied at a temperature of about 40CC or less, more preferably abou: 50CC or less and most preferably about 25°C or less. Before any other operation may be perfomed, it is preferred to allow the water to volatilize away. Usually the water volatilizes away in about 5 to about 10 minutes.<br>
[0024] Thereafter, the surface to which the alumina containing composition was applied may be cleaned. The cleaner can be any cleaner used to clean glass in preparation for applying an adhesive to the glass or the ceramic enamel applied to the glass. Among known cleaners which may be used is BETACLEAN 3300 glass cleaner, BETACLEAN is a trademark of The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan USA. Preferred cleaning compositions comprise water and one or more straight or branched chain alcohols, aJkoxy alcohols or mixtures thereof. Preferred alcohols include isopropanol, butanol, jsobutanol, hexanol, 2-butoxyethanol, 3-butoxypropanoJ, 2-isopropoxyethanol, 3-isopropoxypropanol and the like. Preferably, the pH of the cleaning composition is adjusted with a base, such as ammonia, to match the pH of the alumina containing composition. Preferably, the pH of the cleaner is about 8.5 or greater and more preferably 9.0 or greater. Preferably, the pH of the cleaner is about 9.5 or less and more preferably 9.0 or less. The cleaner can be applied in any manner known to one skilled in the art, for instance by the application with an absorbent material such as a sponge, a lint-free cloth or a paper towel. Before any further step can be performed, the solvent of the cleaner is allowed to flash off, that is volatilized away. Typically, the solvent volatilizes away in about 2 to about 5 minutes.<br>
[0025] The method of the invention may further comprise application of a glass primer to the surface of the glass or ceramic enamel deposited on the glass. Any primer known for use on glass and with the chosen adhesive can be used. Generally, the primer comprises a film forming resin, such as an isocyanate prepolymer, acrylic resin, silane functional resin, polyester resin, and the like; a silane containing component such as<br>
-11-<br><br>
an aminosilane, isocyanato silane, mercapto silanes; and a solvent, such as aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, hydrofurans and acetates. Examples of such primers include BETAPRIME™ 5500 glass primer and BETAPRIME™ 5504 glass primer, BETAPRIME is a trademark of The Dow Chemical Company, Midland, Michigan USA. If a primer is applied, it is applied after the application of the alumina containing composition and the cleaning step, if used, are completed. More particularly, the primer is applied after the water from the alumina containing composition has volatilized away. If a cleaning step is used the primer is applied after the solvent of the cleaning sol-nor. has flashed off, volatilized away. The primer may be applied by any means well known in the art. It may be applied manually by brushing, rolling or applying a cloth containing the composition to the surface of a substrate to which the adhesive will be applied such that a sufficient amount of the primer composition is applied to the surface. The primer can be applied by hand using an absorbent material such as a felt or sponge applicator, a primer stick or by robotic application, utilizing machines such as automated felt applicator as, e.g., provided by Nordson Deutschland GmbH, Erkrath, Germany or automated spray application equipment as e.g., provided by SCA Schucker GmbH, Bretten-Golshausen, Germany or the M710I robotic system or available from Fanuc Robotics America, of Rochester Hills, Michigan used with an automated primer dispense applicator supplied by Nordson Corporation, Amherst, Ohio. Typically, a film of primer is deposited on the surface of the glass or ceramic enamel frit. Preferably, the film is 4 microns or greater and more preferably 5 microns or greater. Preferably, the film is 18 microns or less and preferably 15 microns or less. The primer is applied such that there is a dry time after priming of greater than 30 seconds after spray application and about 180 seconds after application using on absorbent material. The adhesive is applied at least 20 seconds after application of the primer.<br>
[0026] The primer may further contain a component that fluoresces when illuminated by ultraviolet light. Fluorescing components are readily available from numerous sources, for example, Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  As a specific example, the fluorescing component can be Uvitex OB brand fluorescing agent available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals, Tarrytown, New York (USA). The amount of fluorescing agent added to the primer must be sufficient so that the area of the window treated with the primer is apparent when the window is illuminated with an ultraviolet light.<br>
-12-<br><br>
[0027] One process for applying a primer to a surface such as a window or a surface of a metal, plastic or composite which may be coated, comprises the steps of: (a) directing light onto the surface to illuminate a portion of the surface and (b) applying a primer along the illuminated portion of the surface. If the adhesion primer contains a component that evaporates, then the process can further include the step of forming an infrared image of the surface as the component evaporates to indicate the area of application of the adhesion primer. If the adhesion primer contains a component that fluoresces when illuminated by ultraviolet light, then the process can further include me step of illuminating the surface with ultraviolet light to indicate the area of application of the adhesion primer. These processes may be performed as disclosed in commonly assigned PCT Application 2003/19745 filed June, 11, 2003, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0028] The glass substrate is glass which preferably has a ceramic enamel frit disposed on a portion of the surface of the glass. The glass can be flat or shaped. Included in shaped glass is glass having a curved surface. Preferably, the glass is used as a window and the ceramic enamel frit is located about the periphery of the glass. Preferably, the ceramic enamel is located about the periphery of the glass such that it is capable of blocking transmission of light to prevent it from contacting the adhesive, which bonds the window into a structure. The ceramic enamel frit on the periphery also hides the trim components disposed about the periphery of the window. The glass is preferably used as a window and preferably used as a window in an automobile. Figure 1 illustrates a window treated according to the method of the invention. Figure 1 illustrates a window (10) with a frit (11) located about the periphery of the window (10). In another embodiment, the invention is a process for installing a window made of glass, optionally with a ceramic enamel frit disposed about the periphery of the window and an adhesive applied to the periphery of the glass or to the ceramic enamel about the periphery of the glass. Figure 2 illustrates a window with the adhesive disposed on the window, wherein a window (10) has located on it a frit (11) and applied to the frit on the window is a bead of adhesive (12). The bead of adhesive (12) iLs disposed about the periphery of the window (JO) such that it forms a continuous bead of adhesive (12) which is capable of completely sealing around the periphery of the window. Figure 3 illustrates a stepped cross section of the bond between the structure and the window. The figure shows the glass (10) and the organic frit (11).<br><br>
Located adjacent to the organic frit (11) are the adhesive (12) and the flange of the structure (13) to which it is bonded.<br>
[0029] In a preferred embodiment, the alumina containing composition is used in the process to replace windows in structures or vehicles and most preferably in vehicles. The first step is removal of the previous window. This can be achieved by cutting the bead of the adhesive holding the old window in place and then removing the old window. Thereafter, the new window is cleaned, treated according to the method of the invention and primed. The old adhesive that is located on the window flange can be removed, although it is not necessary and in most cases it is left in place. The window flange is preferably primed with a paint primer or an activator system. The adhesive is applied in a bead to the periphery of the window located such that it will contact the window flange when placed in the vehicle. The window with the adhesive located thereon is then placed into the flange with the adhesive located between the window and the flange. The adhesive bead is a continuous bead mat functions to seal the junction between the window and the window flange. A continuous bead of adhesive is a bead that is located such that the bead connects at each end to form a continuous seal between the window and the flange when contacted. Thereafter the adhesive is allowed to cure.<br>
[0030] The adhesive used to bond glass to a substrate can be any known adhesive bead useful in bonding glass to structures.

[0034] In general, the method of bonding glass, such as a window, to a substrate comprises, applying an adhesive to the surface of the glass along the portion of the glass which is to be bonded to the structure which has the composition of this invention coated thereon. Where a ceramic ename] frit is present the adhesive is applied to the surface of the ceramic enamel frit. The adhesive is thereafter contacted with the second substrate such that the adhesive is disposed between the glass and the second substrate. The adhesive is allowed to cure to form a durable bond between the glass and the substrate. In a preferred embodiment, one substrate is glass the other substrate is a plastic, metal, fiberglass or composite substrate (for instance cured sheet molding compound) which may optionally be painted. This method is especially effective for substrates painted with an acid resistant paint. Generally, the adhesives are applied at ambient temperature in the presence of atmospheric moisture. Exposure to atmospheric moisture is sufficient to result in curing of the adhesive. Curing may be further accelerated by applying heat to the curing adhesive by means of convection heat or microwave heating.<br><br>
Specific Embodiments of Invention<br>
[0035] The following examples are included for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. Unless otherwise stated, all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
[0036] The efficiency of an alumina containing composition comprising 39.1 weight percent water, 49.5 weight percent alumina, 10.0 weight percent white mineral oil (petroleum), 0.9 weight percent sodium Iauryl sulphate, 0.- *---e:£hi perce-ri hydroxyethylcellulose, 0.03 weight percent fatty alcohol ethoxylated and 0.09 weight percent orange fragrance for enhancing the bonding of adhesives to glass surfaces is determined by quick knife (peel) tests on silicone contaminated enamel frirs in comparison to alternative treatment processes.<br>
Preparation of Samples for Testing<br>
[0037] Silicone contaminated ceramic frits are treated with the alumina containing composition and/or cleaned with different cleaners, specifically BETACLEAN™ 3300 glass cleaner and/or BETACLEAN™ 3350 glass cleaner as described hereinafter. After a flash-off time of two minutes BETAPRIME™ 5500 glass primer system is applied and after 5 minutes open time BETASEAL™ 2002 LVRP isocyanate functional polyurethane based adhesive system is applied. BETACLEAN, BETAPRIME and BETASEAL are trademarks of The Dow Chemical Company. The primer is applied on ceramic enamel frit with a standardized primer applicator to achieve a uniform film thickness. The primer applicator comprises a polyethylene bottle with a mounted felt, where the felt material is wool with a density 0.16 +/- 0.021 gem"3 and a diameter of 2.2 cm provided by Filzfabrik Fulda, Fulda, Germany. After an open time of 5 minutes, an adhesive bead with 10 mm (height) x 10 - 15 mm (width) x 200 mm (length) is applied. The adhesive bead is compressed to a height of approximately 6 mm. The test sample is cured and exposed to the following conditions:(l) 7 days at 23°C at 50 percent relative humidity (rh.), (2) plus 7 days in water at 23°C, and (3) 7 days of cataplasma. Cataplasma treatment includes the packaging of the sample with cotton and saturation of the cotton packaging with 10 fold water and consecutively wrapping in aluminum foil and PE foil to avoid evaporation. The packed sample is exposed 7 days at 70°C, 16 hours at -20°C, brought to ambient temperature and the unwrapped sample is stored 2 hours at 23°C.<br><br>
'     Quick Knife Test<br>
[0038] To evaluate the adhesion performance, a quick knife test is performed after each of the exposures (1), (2) and (3). In the quick knife test, the adhesive bead is cut on the edge approximate 10 mm parallel to the substrate and peeled of in a 90° angle. Approximately after each 10 mm, the peeled off bead is cut with a knife to the substrate and peeling off is continued. The peeled samples are rated according to the percentage of cohesive failure. Cohesive failure of greater than 80 percent is considered to be sufficient for glazing applications,<br>
[0039] The results are summarized in Table 1.<br>
Table 1. Peel adhesion tests on silicone contaminated windscreens after application of different treatments<br><br>
1.	BETACLEAN™ 3300 glass cleaner.<br>
2.	BETACLEAN™ 3350 glass cleaner.<br>
3.	Alumina containing composition described above.<br><br>
[0040] The application of the alumina containing composition described above on silicone contaminated ceramic frits, cleans and prepares the surface for bonding more efficiently than the other tested glass cleaning systems alone. Entry 5 in Table 1 also demonstrates that cleaning after the application of the alumina containing composition described above is not a necessity for acceptable bonding.<br>
[0041] The application of BETACLEAN™ 3300 glass cleaner after the cleaning step with the alumina containing composition described above facilitates the visualization of the cleaning efficiency on the basis of the wemng behavior of the cleaner. Figure 4 shows a picture of the wetting behavior of BETACLEAN™ 3300 glass cleaner on a ceramic frit after treatment with the alumina containing composition which indicates a clean surface. Figure 5 is a picture of the wetting behavior of BETACLEAN™ 3300 glass cleaner on a ceramic frit without treatment with the alumina containing composition which indicates a silicon contaminated surface.<br><br><br>
