The present invention relates to a position-reporting device for a rotary company, especially for a motorised drive of tap selector switch, a reversing device or a solenoid coil.<br>
In the context of electrical current supply regulation, tap selector switches enable uninterrupted switching-over between winding taps of a tapped transformer under load, reversing devices enable the switching-over between such taps in the unloaded state, and solenoid coils enable the setting or changing of an inductance. Position-reporting devices, as components of motorised drives of tap selector switches or the like, serve to detect and report the instantaneous setting of the tap selector switch or the like. This in turn is the starting point for an optical actual setting display and, as an actual value, is the basis of subsequent control or regulating functions.<br>
Known position-reporting devices, for example as described in German published patent specification (DE-AS) No 21 08 013, for tap selector switches consist of a circular arrangement of a plurality of reporting contacts, wherein each operational setting of the tap selector switch or the like is associated with at least one respective reporting contact. In that case, the reporting contacts are contacted by means of a rotatable central reporting contact lever, which is connected with the tap selector switch or, more precisely, with the motor drive of the tap selector switch.<br>
The contact lever is moved, on each change of the operational setting of the tap selector switch, i.e. in the case of switching-over from one winding tap to another, through a switching angle which corresponds with the spacing between two adjacent reporting contacts. In consequence of the continuous movement of the lever, a very slow contact separation comes about, which in dependence on the particular switching process can extend over several seconds. Such a position-reporting device is thus not suitable when circuits operated by direct current are carried by way of the reporting contacts or, in general, when higher currents are to be switched. To deal with this situation, a position-reporting device in which each reporting contact is constructed as an individual toggle switch so as to increase the switching power, is described in German laid-open patent specification (DE-OS) No. 18 12 609. This device, however, involves high expenditure.<br>
For simplification, it is known from German patent specification No 21 08 013 to provide a position-reporting device in which - instead of the many individual toggle switches - only a single such toggle switch or snap switch is arranged in the current circuit.   The single<br><br>
switch is actuated by means of a cam disc which is coupled by way of a gear with the reporting contact lever. However, this device is still too expensive, because two different rotational movements must be produced. On the one hand there is the actual movement of the reporting contact lever from one reporting contact to a neighbouring one, thus through an angle of 360/n degrees in the case of n possible settings andr on the other hand the movement of the cam disc which, for each switching action, rotates through an angle of 360 degrees, thus executes a complete revolution.<br>
Tor further simplification, German patent specification No. 29 47 343 describes a position-reporting device in which a single snap switch is arranged on the rotatable contact lever itself. The actuation of the snap switch in that case is effected by a single concentric cam track which extends around the circularly arranged reporting contacts.<br>
This device, however, has the disadvantage that the movable reporting contact cannot be in the form of a simple bridge, since, as explained, it must also receive the snap switch and a series connection of reporting contact, snap switch and reporting contact on the contact arm is required. Moreover, the electrical feed and output lines to and from the snap switch make this arrangement more complicated, since the snap switch with the reporting contact lever executes a rotational movement, thus is no longer a stationary component. The device is also not suitable for production by printed circuitboard technology.<br>
In summary, this known position-reporting device is still too complicated in respect of construction as well as in respect of operation.<br>
It is accordingly the object of the invention to provide a position-reporting device which includes only a single toggle switch, but which is simple in construction and reliable in function and which can be manufactured in a particularly simple manner.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided position-reporting device for a rotary component, especially a motor drive of a tap selector switch, a reversing device or a solenoid coil, comprising a plurality of fixed reporting contacts, which are associated with different operational settings of the component and are arranged in a circle, and a movable reporting contact lever mounted to be rotatable centrally in this circle, wherein the individual reporting contacts can be switched to by means of the reporting contact lever<br><br>
and electrically connected with an output line by way of at least one interconnected toggle switch, characterised in that the reporting contact lever comprises a cam disc with an end face cam profile and the at least one toggle switch is arranged externally of the circle of<br>

dependence on the rotation of the disc.<br>
It is in that case of particular advantage that a constructionally simple arrangement, which is easy to assemble, of the entire device results. This is made possible by the reporting contact lever being constructed as a cam disc. The disc thereby performs two different functions which, in the prior art, were realised by separate components. On the one hand, it switches to the reporting contacts arranged in a circle and connects these individually with an output line and on the other hand its cam profile simultaneously actuates the stationary toggle switch connected into the current circuit. Consequently, no additional measures are needed for actuation of the toggle switch and it is not necessary to provide an additional cam disc or to produce an additional movement. This significantly simplifies the entire device.<br>
In addition, the reporting contact lever constructed in the form of a cam disc can be manufactured as a separate component. The manufacture of additional cam discs, the assembly of which concentrically around the reporting contacts would impose appreciable accuracy requirements, becomes superfluous.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the disc comprises insulating material and is provided with recesses or openings in which is mounted at least one electrically conductive contact bridge, which on rotation of the disc is effective to contact the individual reporting contacts and produce the connection to the output line. Through different arrangement, position, number and size of the contact bridge or bridges, diverse wiring layouts and switching sequences can be realised with minimum effort in an otherwise unchanged device.<br>
jollity<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the lrtyei|ltipn, the disc has its own bearing, i.e. a separate bearing. Consequently, the rotatapl'disc and the bearing making its rotation possible can be produced as an independent Subassembly and subsequently be fitted, in simple manner, to a mounting plate which carries the circularly arranged reporting contacts and the toggle switch. It is particularly advantageous in that case if this mounting plate is constructed as a printed circuitboard.<br><br>
|:   ;,v<br><br>
It is also possible to arrange several such cam discs and mounting plates one upon the<br>
other in the manner of modules and to actuate them by a common central shaft. As a<br>
result, and due to the already described possibility of variation of the contact bridges<br>
arranged on the cam discs, diverse forms of connection of the reporting contacts are<br>
possible in simple manner with only a few components.	*<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be more particularly described by way of example with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1	is a partly cut-away schematic plan view of a first device embodying the<br>
invention;<br>
Fig. 2<br>
Fig. 3<br>
is a schematic side view of the device of Fig. 1; and<br>
is a schematic side view of a second device embodying the invention.<br>
Referring now to the drawings there is shown in Figs. 1 and 2 a first embodiment of a position-reporting device, which comprises a mounting plate 1. This mounting plate 1 in turn has circularly arranged individual reporting contacts 11 insulated from each other. It also has a continuous output contact ring 12 on a circle concentric with the circle of reporting contacts 11. The reporting contacts 11 and the output contact ring 12 can consist of separate contact members or tracks. It is, however, particularly advantageous to construct the mounting plate 1 as a printed circuitboard and to form the reporting contacts 11 and the output contact ring 12 as conductive tracks on the upper side of this circuitboard.<br>
A toggle switch 3, which comprises an actuating roller 31, is fastened outside the contact tracks on the mounting plate 1. A microswitch is particularly suitable as the toggle switch 3. The electrical connections of the toggle switch 3 as well as the conductors, which are connected with the switch, with the individual reporting contacts and with the output contact ring, at the rear side of the plate 1 are not illustrated in the drawings.<br>
The position-reporting device also comprises a cam disc 2, which is rotatably mounted on the mounting plate 1 and disposed at a specific spacing from and parallel to the plate. For this purpose, the cam disc 2 comprises a bearing 21, which is mounted on the plate 1 in<br><br>
the centre of the concentric contact tracks of reporting contacts 11 and output contact ring 12 situated on this plate.<br>
The periphery of the cam disc 2 has a cam profile 22, which co-operates with the roller 31 of the switch 3.<br>
Arranged on the disc 2 on the side facing the plate 1 is an electrically conductive contact bridge 23, which at one end has a tongue-like projection which contacts the reporting contacts 11 individually and which at its other end is in con^ant contact with the output contact ring 12, i.e, wipes this ring. The contact bridge 23 can be mounted in particularly simple manner by being plugged, by projections provided 'his purpose, free ends or the like, into openings 24 in the disc 2. With this arrangement, different individual reporting contacts 11 can be electrically connected one after the Ou ar with the contact ring 12 on rotation of the disc 2. At the same time, the switch 3, whi is connected into a reporting electrical circuit and the roller 31 of which runs along the c u profile 22, is actuated by the cam profile. The disc 2 is connected with, for exampK r&gt; motor drive of a tap selector switch by way of a central drive shaft 4.<br>
In operation, if the tap selector switch is to be switched from one step to an adjacent other step, i.e. from one winding tap to an adjacent winding tap, the associated motor drive is set into motion. The drive shaft 4 and thereby the cam disc 2 begin to rotate. The contact bridge 23, which hitherto produced an electrical connection between the fixed reporting contact 11 representing the previously selected tap position and the output contact ring thus begins to leave this reporting contact and moves in accordance with the direction of rotation towards one of the two adjacent reporting contacts. At the same time, the roller 31 runs up onto a cam lobe of the cam profile 22, whereby the toggle switch 3 is actuated and opens the current circuit before the contact bridge 23 completely leaves the previous reporting contact. Due to the switch 3, the electrical circuit is interrupted before a mechanical contact separation at the previously contacted reporting contact takes place, so that an arc or the like cannot occur at the contact. Rather, the actual contact separation takes place free of current. On further rotation, the contact bridge 23 reaches the adjacent reporting contact and produces an electrical connection between this and the output contact ring 12. Subsequently, the actuating roller 31 runs into a cam valley of the cam profile 22 and the switch 3 again completes the current circuit.<br><br>
In order to ensure this sequence, appropriate^dimensioning* of the width of the individual reporting contacts 11 and their spacing one from the other, the contact bridge 23 and the cam profile 22 are required. In dependence on these dimensionings, switching sequences of diverse kinds can be realised. Thus, it is quite possible, in modification of the just explained switching sequence, to provide for the toggle switch 3 to complete the current circuit before the contact bridge 23 has reached the new reporting contact.<br>
The drive shaft 4 and thus the cam disc 2 perform a rotational movement through an angle of 360/n degrees on each switching action of the tap selector switch, wherein n is the number of the possible tap settings and thus the number of the reporting contacts present.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the device, in which the bearing 21 is firmly connected with the cam disc 2 by means of a fastening element 25 and comprises a central bearing bush 27, the internal outline of which corresponds with the external outline of the drive shaft 4. A bore 13, the diameter of which is somewhat greater than that of the bearing 21 so that this can be plugged in and can rotate freely, is provided in the mounting plate 1.<br>
Axial fixing is effected on the one hand by a projection 28 at the bearing bush 27 of larger diameter and on the other hand by a fastening ring 26, which after assembly on the other side of the mounting plate 1 is introduced into a recess 29 of the bearing 21. Thus, a reliable fixing of the assembly consisting of the bearing 21 and the cam disc 22 is ensured with unrestricted rotatability on the mounting plate 1.<br>
i i<br>
This construction offers several advantages. On the one hand, the entire assembly of cam disc and bearing can be preassembled and, on the other hand, this assembly can be mounted simply by being inserted through an opening 13 in the plate 1 and locked on the other side by the fastening ring 26. A further advantage is that the shaft 4, which transmits<br>
the rotational movement from the  be inserted into the bearing bush 27<br>
'<br>
(}i Mil<br>
subsequently. In that case, a mechanically coupling can be produced in known, manner by appropriate outline shapes.<br>
It is also possible for the position-reporting device to include several position-reporting assemblies in separate planes one above the other, such as may be desired for, for example, multiphase arrangements.   In Fig. 3, such an arrangement is indicated in two<br>
'■\]-i    Mi<br><br>
planes. In this arrangement, a second mounting plate 5 and a second cam disc 6 are provided, which form an identical second position-reporting assembly. The fixing and fastening of the individual assemblies in that case is effected by spacer elements 7 and the synchronous movement of the two cam discs 2 and 6 by the drive shaft 4 running through the entire arrangement.<br><br><br><br><br>
