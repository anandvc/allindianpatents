				<td>Novel polysiloxane sunscreens<br>
The present invention relates to novel sunscreens on the basis of polysiloxanes, to their preparation and to their use, especially in formulations for the protection against harmful effects of sunlight.<br>
There is a constantly increasing need for sunscreen protection agents in a population that is exposed to an increasing amount of damaging sunlight. Repetitive sun exposure can result in skin changes known as photoaged skin. The clinical changes that are seen in photoaged skin differ from those of normally aged skin in sunlight protected sites of the body. Among the damaging results of intensive sun exposure of the skin there is increased wrinkling, elastosis, pigmentary changes, precancerous and cancerous skin lesions.<br>
Many sunscreening chemicals have been developed in the past protecting against the harmful effects of UVA (320 - 400 nm) and/or UVB (290 - 320 nm) wavelengths. Very recently a new class of sun screening chemicals, the broadband UV-filters have been developed which shield the skin from UV-A and UV-B radiation. These chemicals have been incorporated either alone or in combination with each other into cosmetic or pharmaceutical preparations which are widely known and used. However, these is a need for the development of even more potent sunscreening chemicals and preparations containing them as well as of easier and economically more attractive chemical syntheses thereof, especially in view of further depletion of the ozon layer of the earth to be expected with concurrent increasing doses of UVA and UVB and even shorter wavelengths (UVC) to be endured.<br>
The present invention, therefore, provides new polysiloxane-based sunscreen compounds, a method for their preparation and cosmetic or pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
More particularly the new compounds of the present invention are substituted polysiloxanes containing a certain number of the following structural elements per molecule, viz.<br>
one element of formula    (H3C)3-Si-	(I),<br>
one element of formula    -O-Si(CH3)3	(II),<br>
at least two elements selected from the groups (A), (B), (C) and (D)<br>
(A)	0 to 100, preferably 5 to 60, elements in arbitrary order which are   either<br>
identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[CH(CH3)R1]-	(Ilia),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH2-CH2-R1)-	(Illb),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[C(=CH2)R1]-	(Illc), and<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH=CH-R1)-	(llld);<br>
(B)	0 to 100, preferably 5 to 60, elements in arbitrary order which are    either<br>
identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[CH(CH3)R2]-	(IVa),<br>
-O-Si(CH3)(CH2-CH2-R2)-	(IVb),<br>
-O-Si(CH3)[C(=CH2)R2]-	(IVc), and<br>
-O-Si(CH3)(CH=CH-R2)-	(IVd);<br>
(C)	0 to 100, preferably 5 to 60, elements in arbitrary order which are    either<br>
identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[CH(CH3)R3]-	(Va),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH2-CH2-R3)-	(Vb),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[C(=CH2)R3]-	(Vc), and<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH=CH-R3)-	(Vd);<br>
(D)	0 to 100, preferably 5 to 60, elements in arbitrary order which are    either<br>
identical or different from each other selected from the group consisting of formulae<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[CH(CH3)R4]-	(Vla),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH2-CH2-R4)	(Vlb),<br>
-0-Si(CH3)[C(=CH2)R4]-	(Vic), and<br>
-0-Si(CH3)(CH=CH-R4)-	(Vld);<br>
1 - 200, preferably 5 to 80 elements in arbitrary order of formula -O-Si(CH3) 2-    (VII) and optionally 1-20 elements in arbitrary order of formula -O-SiH(CH3)-    (VIM) are present, wherein R1 is a UV-B light absorbing group,<br>
R2 is a UV-A light absorbing group, R3 is a UV-C light absorbing group and R4 is a broadband light absorbing group;<br>
with the proviso that at least two elements belonging to different groups (A), (B), (C) and (D) are present.<br>
The term "in arbitrary order" means that there is no specific order or sequence of the elements of formulae III a - III d, IV a - IV d, V a - V d, VI a - VI d, VII and VIII in the polysiloxane molecule and that the order or sequence of the elements may vary from molecule to molecule.<br>
Elements may be "identical" or "different from each other". This means that there may be present only one type of an element of formula Ilia - 11 Id and/or of formula IVa -IVd and/or of formula V a - V d and/or of formula VI a - VI d; or several elements of formula Ilia - Hid to formula VI a - VI d. Thus, all possible combinations of different elements as defined above are comprised by the present invention. The sunscreen molecules of the present invention contain at least two different UV absorbing groups (chromophores), preferably, one type of UVA defined by formula IVa - IVd and one type of UVB absorbing groups defined by formula Ilia - llld are present in the same molecule in arbitrary order to give protection against a broad wavelength spectrum. Additional groups with different absorption maxima, including UVC absorbing groups, may be present.<br>
Thus, e.g., a polysiloxane compound of formula<br>
(H3C)3Si-[-O-Si(CH3)(CH2-CH2-R1)H-O-Si(CH3)2]31-[-O-Si(CH3)(CH2-CH2-R2)]BO-Si(CH3)3<br>
contains in arbitrary order 44 silyloxy groups, 7 of which being groups of formula Illb with chromophores R1, 6 of which being groups of formula IVb with chromophores R2, 31 of which being groups of formula IV.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the present invention can be prepared by reacting a polydimethylhydrosiloxane of the general formula<br>
CH3<br>
I (H3C)3SH-0-SiH]m-[-0-Si(CH3) 2]nO-Si(CH3)3   (IX)<br>
wherein n+m is an integer of 4 to 520, preferably of 10 to 200 and more preferably of 20 to 60 and the ratio of n to m is 1:1 to 20:1, preferably 5:1 to 15:1.<br>
with at least two terminally unsaturated compounds of the formulae<br>
H2C = CH - R1-4	(X)<br>
and/or HC = C - R1-4	(XI)<br>
wherein R1-4 denotes one of the groups R1, R2, R3and RA are as defined above, with the proviso that the reactants X and XI comprise at least two different groups R1-4,<br>
in the presence of a noble metal catalyst.<br>
UV-light absorbing groups comprise all groups which absorb light in the range of wavelengths 400 - 320 nm (UVA) and 320 - 290 (UVB) or of even shorter wavelengths (UVC) and which are or can be used as chemical UV filters. The term "broadband light absorbing group" as used herein refers to groups which absorb light in a region overlapping UV-A and UV-B, especially in the range between about 310 and 360nm. UV-light absorbing groups which may be present in compounds of the instant invention are, e.g., present in compounds belonging to the groups of acrylates, p-aminobenzoates, camphor derivatives (such as of benzylidene camphor type), cinnamates, benzophenones, esters of benzalmalonic acid, esters of 2-(4-ethoxy anilinomethylene)propandioic acid, imidazole derivatives, salicylates, triazone derivatives, triazol derivatives, dibenzoylmethanes, anthranilates, amino substituted<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein R' is hydrogen, hydroxy, straight or branched chain C1-20-alkyl. -alkoxy or C2-20-alkenyl.<br>
Examples of preferred polysiloxanes of the present invention are those wherein wherein R1 is derived from a benzalmalonate and R2 is derived from an amino substituted hydroxybenzophenone, especially those obtained from reactants of the above structures.<br>
The reaction of the polymethylhydrosiloxane of formula IX with the compounds of formulae X and/or XI to yield the compounds of the present invention can be carried out in a manner known per se, see, e.g., as described in WO 03/086340.<br>
The reaction is suitably conducted in an organic solvent, e.g., an aliphatic, possibly chlorinated, or aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene or xylene; an alcohol such as isopropanol; an ether such as THF; or a polar aprotic solvent, such as DMF, which is preferably part of the solvent as a solubilizer.<br>
The reaction temperature, depending upon the reactants, is in the range of 40 to 150°C, preferably from 60°C to 100°C, e.g., at about 80°C. The reaction time may vary between 2 and 48 hours.<br>
Preferred noble metal catalysts are platinum metal catalysts, viz. Pt, Pd, Rh and Ru, with platinum being especially preferred. The catalyst can be in heterogeneous phase, e.g., on charcoal or, preferably, in homogeneous phase (Karstedt catalyst).<br>
The reactants are reacted in the desired molecular ratios of the substituents R1, R2, R3, and R4 in the end product either simultaneously or successively under an inert gas atmosphere, preferably under nitrogen or argon. It is evident that the product obtained is a mixture of different polydimethylsiloxanes statistically substituted with residues carrying at least two UV-light absorbing groups chosen from R1, R2, R3and R4.<br>
Since the compounds of formulae X to XI can react in 1 - or 2-position (of the terminal double or triple bond) with the polydimethylhydrosilane of formula IX a mixture of vicinal (1.2-substitution) and geminal (2.2-substitution) - relative to the terminal double or triple bond of compound X to XI - reaction products is obtained which can be used as sunscreens without previous separation of its components.<br>
The ratio of UV-light absorbing groups of formula Illa-d to Vla-d in the compounds of the present invention is not critical. Preferably a UV-B (R1) and a UV-A (R2) absorbing group in a ratio of 5:1 to 1:5, preferably 3:1 or 1:1, most preferred 2:1.<br>
The ratio of the sum of the UV-light absorbing groups of formula Illa-d to Vla-d to elements of formula VII is 1:20 to 1:1, preferably 1:15 to 1:5.<br>
The so-obtained reaction product which comprises the compounds of the present invention may contain 1 to 20 elements of formula VIII, viz. unreacted elements from the starting material. This may be the case when sufficient amounts of reactants of formulae X and XI were lacking in the reaction mixture or did not react quantitatively for whatever reason. Such compounds may be eliminated, e.g., by a further reaction with a compound of the formula X or XI. Preferably, elements of formula VIII are absent or substantially absent from the compounds of the present invention.<br>
The starting polydimethylhydrosiloxane material of formula are well known in the silicone industry and are commercially available (e.g. Wacker, GE-Bayer Silcones or Dow Corning) or can easily be prepared by a person skilled in the art from dichloro-methylsilane and trimethyl-chlorosilane, using the desired molecular ratios, in aqueous solution. They are described, for example, in the following patents: US 3,220,972, US 3,697,474 and US 4,340,709.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the present invention can be used as sunscreens. They are suitable for the protection of human skin and/or hair from damaging effects of UV radiation, as well as for protection of UV sensitive plastic materials, medicinal products and other objects.<br>
Therefore, the polysiloxane compounds can be converted into compositions, particularly into topical compositions, in combination with pharmaceutically and/or cosmetically acceptable excipients.<br>
The compositions comprising the compounds of the present invention are particularly suitable for topical applications onto human skin and/or hair.<br>
If desired, additional UV-A and UV-B screening agents may be added to the cosmetic and/or dermatological compositions of the present invention. The combination of different UV filters may also show synergistic effects.<br>
While the compounds of the present invention can be used alone or in combination with other compounds which absorb in the UV range, although at least an effective amount of a compound of the present invention should be present in the sunscreen compositions. The term "effective amount of the compound of the present invention" means generally at least 0.2% by weight based on the total weight of the sunscreen composition.<br>
The total amount of UV screening agents, i.e. of the present compounds and, if desired, of additional UV-A/B screening agents, is not narrowly critical. Such amounts may vary from 0.2 % by weight and higher, suitably between about 0.5 and about 20%, preferably between about 0.5 and about 12% by weight of the total amount of the composition.<br>

The ZnO particles may also be coated by metal oxides such as, e.g., aluminum or zirconium oxides or by organic coatings such as e.g. polyols, methicone, aluminum stearate, alkyl silane. Such coatings are well known in the art.<br>
Because dibenzoylmethane derivatives are photolabile UV-A screening agents, it may be desirable to photostabilize them. Thus, the term "conventional UV-A screening agent" also refers to dibenzoylmethane derivatives such as e.g. PARSOL® 1789 stabilized by, e.g.,<br>
