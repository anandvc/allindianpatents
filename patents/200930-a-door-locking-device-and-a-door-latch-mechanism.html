" A DOOR LOCKING DEVICE AND A DOOR LATCH MECHANISM"<br>
This    invention   relates  to  a   door    locking    device    and  a  door      latch mechanism.<br>
The   present  invention   particularly   relates   to locking devices for door latches of the  type  which  may  be  released to enable opening of a door by turning one of the 5         associated  door handles  on  opposite  sides of the door. The locking device enables the   latch   to   be locked in its latched position from one side of the door and prohibits the door from being opened by turning of the handle on the opposite side.<br>
Door latches are used to retain closures such as doors and gates in closed positions and, typically, comprise a spring loaded latch bolt which is resilientty urged outwardly of the 10 latch into a latching position in which it is engageable with a retainer or catch on an adjacent door frame to latch the door in its closed position. The latch is retracted in order to permit opening of the door by turning of a square section bar which projects from opposite sides of the latch and the door and which may be turned by handles fitted to opposite ends of the bar. The handles may be knobs or lever arms. If a door having such a latch<br><br>
15       mechanism is to be locked in its latched position, the latch normally incorporates a separate i key-operated  bolt or, alternatively,   one or both latch   handles   may be  fitted with a complicated   central   locking   mechanism   actuated by a central push button or tumable member.<br>
US-A-1688240   comprises  a   spring   loaded   latch   bolt which is resiliency urged<br>
20       outwardly   to   engage  a   catch   in the door jamb and which is retractable in response to turning of either of a pair of coaxial latch bars, each fitted with a door knob. To lock the door from    the inside, when it is closed, the inside door knob is turned in either direction. This knob  is  coupled  by its  latch bar to a cam which, in response to turning of the knob, pushes  a   locking   member mounted on the latch bar, within the latch mechanism, so<br>
25 that a part of the locking member engages a slot in the housing of the mechanism. When engaged with the slot the locking member prevents the other latch   bar from  turning so that the outside door knob cannot be turned. Hence, the door<br><br><br>
2<br>
cannot be opened from the outside. To release the outside knob, the inside knob must f;rst be turned to retract the latch bolt and this enables the door to be opened. When the door is opened, the inside knob has to be released by the user to enable the spring loaded boit to extend beyond the door, 5 whereupon the latch bolt pulls the locking member from the slot,thus releasing the outside door knob.<br>
US-A-5433495 also discloses a door latch mechanism within a body of a door, comprising a latch bolt whicn is retractable in response to turning of a door knob en either side of the doer.    One of the knobs is designed to be<br>
10 pushed in towards the door to prevent the latch bolt from being retracted by either knob. To enable the door knobs to be able to subsequently retract the latch bolt, the same door knob is then pulled out.<br>
CH-A-565307 discloses a sash window with a crank handle and a spring biased lock.<br>
15	An object of the present invention is to provide a locking device for the<br>
latch bolt of a door latch mechanism, which device may be actuated by a turning action of the door handle also used to retract the latch bolt for opening of an associated door.<br>
According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
20 locking device for use with a door latch mechanism in which the door latch mechanism has a latch bar which is turnable to retract a latch bolt of the door latch mechanism by turning of a door handle at either end of the latch bar, the locking device being characterised by<br>
locking means adapted to be actuated to prohibit turning of the latcn<br>
2 5       bar and retraction of the latch bolt, and<br>
cam means for controlling the locking means and adapted to be coupled to the latch bar, whereby the locking means is actuated by turning of the cam means in response to Turning of one of the door handles of the door latch mechanism in one direction, whereafter the locking means is releasable by<br>
30      turning of the cam means in response to turning of said one door handle in the<br>

opposite direction.<br>
Preferably, the cam means is coupled to the latch bar by coupling means enabling the cam means to turn relatively to the latch bar, when turned in said one direction. The coupling means may comprise a passageway in the 5 cam means for fitting the cam means to the latch bar, said passageway having an internal profile which enables the cam means to turn through a limited arc of movement relative to the latch bar, when turned in said one direction.<br>
The locking means may comprise first means turnable with the latch<br>
10 bar and second means which is engaged" with the first means to prohibit turning of the latch bar in response to turning of the cam means in said one direction, and which is disengaged from the first means by turning the cam means in the opposite direction.<br>
In one embodiment, the second means comprises a slidable locking<br>
15 member controlled by the cam means. The first means may comprise a detent, and the slidable locking member may be engagable with the detent to prohibit turning of the latch bar. The detent may be disposed on a rotatable locking member adapted to be mounted on the latch bar so as to turn therewith.<br>
20	It may be desirable for the cam means to be profiled to prevent the<br>
siidable locking member from engaging the first means when the cam means is turned in said opposite direction whilst permitting the slidable locking member to engage the first means when turned in said one direction. The cam means may have a recess which permits the slidable locking member to<br>
25 move into engagement with the first means, said recess having a stop portion at one end which prevents the cam means from turning further in said one direction upon engagement of the locking member in the recess, and a ramp portion at its opposite end to ease the locking member from the recess when the cam means is turned in the opposite direction.<br>
30	The locking device may include a door handle with the cam means<br>

integral with the handle. Conveniently, the handle is rctatably mounted in a housing adapted to be secured in a fixed position relative to the door latch mechanism.   The second means may be mounted in said housing.<br>
The coupling means of the locking device may comprise a first part in<br>
5       the cam means and a second part turnable with the latch bar which the first<br>
part is  adapted to  engage,  the  cam  means  being  able to  turn through  a<br>
limited arc of movement relative to the latch bar   when turned in said one<br>
direction, when the coupling parts are disengaged.<br>
The locking device may have   indexing means for indexing the door<br>
10      handle alternatively in either of two positions in one of which the latch bar is<br>
prohibited from turning, and in the other of which the latch bar is free to<br>
turn.<br>
According to this aspect of the present invermon Ibfite is provided an auxiliary lockin_q_rij£yic£,  which may be fitted to an existing latch.    In this<br>
15 case, the locking device with a handle is fitted in place of one of the original latch handles in order to provide The latch with a locking facility, so that a door can be locked from one side and cannot be opened by turning the latch handle attached to the latch bar on the opposite side of the door.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
20 a door latch mechanism comprising a latch bolt which is retractable in response to turning of a latch bar, characterised by locking means adapted to be actuated in response to turning of a door handle fitted to the latch bar to prohibit retraction of the latch bolt by turning of a handle on the opposite side of the door, whereafter the locking means is releasable by turning said<br>
25       one handle in the opposite direction.<br>
The locking means of the latch mechanism may be adapted to be actuated to prohibit turning of the latch bar, and include cam means for controlling the locking means, which cam means is coupled to the latch bar, whereby the  locking means  is  actuated  by turning  of the  cam  means  in<br>
30       response to turning of said one door handle in one direction, and the locking<br><br>

means is rsieasable by turning of the cam means in response to turning of said cne door handle in the opposite direction.<br>
In one embodiment, the cam means cf the latch mechanism is coupled to the latch bar by coupling means enabling the cam means to turn relatively 5 to the latch bar, when turned in said one direction, the coupling means comprising a passageway of rectangular cross-section in the cam means by which the cam means is coupled to the latch bar and wherein the latch bar has an external profile which enables the cam means to turn through a limited arc cf movement relative to the latch bar, when turned in said one<br>
IC      direction.<br>
In another embodiment, the latch mechanism may include first and second coaxial latch bars for projecting from opposite sides of the door, the locking means comprising actuating members on said latch bars, the actuating members being engageable with the latch bolt, whereby at least one of the<br>
15      latch bars is rotatable in said one direction to cause rts actuating member to engage the latch bolt and prohibit retraction thereof by turning of the other<br>

The locking device 1 illustrated in Figures 1 to 16 of the accompanying drawings is designed for fining to the latch bar of a door latch inset within the 10      body of a door between opposite sides of the door. The latch bar is of square cross section and projects from opposite sides of the door and a normal door<br><br><br>
WO 00/71841	PCT/CB0O/U!9:0<br>
5<br>
handle is fixed to the end of the latch bar at one side of the door and the locking device is fitted to the end of the latch bar on the opposite side to permit the door to be locked from that side. As is conventional, the latch includes a spring loaded latch bolt which is resiliency urged into a projecting 5 position for engaging a catch on the door frame so as to latch the door in a closed position. The latch bar is coupled to the latch bolt by a conventional latch mechanism which operates to retract or withdraw the latch bolt into the latch casing and disengage it from a cooperating door catch, in response to turning of the latch bar. so as to permit the.door to be opened.<br>
10	Referring to Figures   1   to   12,  the locking device   1   comprises a cast<br>
metal housmq or escutcheon 2 .in which is journalled a door handle 3.   This door handle  comprises  a generally conical  body 4  from the outer  end of which projects a lever arm 5 by which the handle may be manually turned. The opposite end of the body 4 has a cylindrical part 6 of reduced diameter<br>
15 compared to the diameter of the adjoining pan of the body. This reduced diameter part 6 projects into the housing 2 through a suitable hole m the housing and is journalled in an annular collar 7 projecting from the housing, about the hole, by means of a sleeve 8 (see also Figure 8). The sleeve has an annular flange 9 projecting between and in abutting relation with both the<br>
20 free end of the collar 7 and the body 4. It is prevented from turning tn the collar by grooves 10 of the sleeve 8 engaging cooperating ribs 11 (Figure 12) projecting from the inside of the collar 7. The sleeve has first and second pockets 12.13 spaced circumferentially about its inner periphery for encaging a dome shaped detent 14 mounted in the cylindrical part 6 of the<br>
25      handle for indexing the handle in the rest and locked positions, respectively.<br>
The detent is mounted in a socket  1 5 (Figures 4 and 7} in the cylindrical<br>
part 6 and is spring biassed towards the surrounding sieeve 8. The handle 3<br>
is secured to the housing 2 by means of a circlip 1 6 fitted to the cylindrical<br>
part 6 of the body 4 and abutting the inside of the housing.<br>
30	The  handle body  4 has a blind  passageway  17 extending  into  the<br><br>
UO 00/71841	PCT/GBOO/019:0<br>
body from trie inner end thereof opposite the lever arm 5 and fitting onto the adjacen; projecting end 0: the latch bar 18 (shown in chain dotted lines on Figure 5). The passageway 17 has an internal profile formed from specially designec longitudinally extending ribs 19 which are arranged so as to enable :¦ the handle to engage ana turn tr.e square section latch bar, when the handle is turned in a clockwise direction from the rest position, and enable the handle to turn relative:-/ to the latcn bar when the handle is turned in an anticlockwise direction from the rest position.<br>
Disposed m the housing 2, adjacent the inner end of the part 6 of the<br>
10       handle bcdy 4.  is an annular cam or locking bush or member 20 (see also<br>
Figure 9) which has a collar 21   projecting from its end opposite the part 6<br>
and journalled in a suitable hole in a base plate 22 attached to the housing 2.<br>
The locking bush is rotatabie relative to the housing and base plate and has<br>
a central, square aperture 23 for engaging the latch bar and a locking notch<br>
15      or recess or detent 24 in its periphery.<br>
Cast en the inside of the housing 2, adjacent its periphery, is a locking bar guide 25 (see Figures 10 and 1 1) which is in the form of a channel that is radially disposed to the axis of rotation of the handle 3. The guide mounts a locking bar or member 26 which is shdable radially in the channel ana is<br>
2C       spring biased towards the locking bush 2u and the cylindrical pan 6 of the<br>
handle body A. The locking bar includes a protrusion 21 which is slidable in a<br>
guide slct 2S in the tase plate 22 and aligned with the locking bar guide 25.<br>
The inner end  of the cylindrical  part   6  has  a  cam  surface  formed  on  its<br>
periphery for controlling movement of the locking bar. At its radially inner<br>
25 end the locking bar has a cam follower portion 30 in engagement with the cam surface and the latter includes a camming recess 31 which, when the handle 3 and cylindrical parr 6 are turned to a predetermined locking position, permits the locking bar to clip into engagement with the notc.h 24 in the locking bush 20. One end 32 of the camming recess serves as a stop<br>
30       which engages the cam follower portion 30 of the locking bar 26 to prevent<br><br>
WO 00/71841	PCT/GBOO/019:0<br>
further turning of the cylindrical par: 6 and handle 3 once the locking bar is engaged with the notch 24 in the locking bush 20 and the opposite end 33 of the camming recess is inclined cr ramped to facilitate disengagement of the locking bar from the notch when the handle is turned in the opposite z      direction.<br>
The housing 2 of the locking device 1 is attached to one side of a door by means of screws, with the passageway 17 of the handle body 4 engaged with the latch bar 18. Holes 34 are provided through the wall cf the housing and in the base plate 22 for these screws.<br>
10	The handle 3 maybe a JPS Raven handle or equivalent.   The housing 2<br>
may be a zinc alloy coating, the sleeve 8 may be of nylon and the detent 14 may be of brass. The base plate 22 may be stamped from steel plate and may have a thickness of 1.5mm.<br>
When the handle 3 of the locking device 1 is in its rest position shown<br>
15 in Figure 2, the locking bar 26 is aligned with the notch 24 in the locking bush 20 but is prevented from being urged into engagement with the notch by the cam surface on the cylindrical handle part 6. In this position, the detent 1 4 engages the first pocket 1 2 in the sleeve 8. to index the handle in its rest position.<br>
2C	To open a door fitted with the locking device 1, the lever arm 5 of the<br>
handle 3 is turned in a clockwise direction from its rest position, when viewed from the front. When turned in this direction, the ribs 19 of the handle body 4 couple and engage the square section of the latch bar 1 3 so that the latter turns with the handle and, hence, the latch bolt is retracted<br>
25 allowing the door to be opened. At the same time, the locking bush 20 also rotates with the latch bar. The turning of the handle body 4 causes the detent 14 to disengage from the first pocket 12 in the sleeve 8. When the lever arm 5 is released, the latch bar turns under the action of the latch spring in an anti-clockwise direction causing the handle 3 and locking bush<br>
30      20 to return to the rest position where the detent 14 re-enters the pocket 12<br><br>
8 to index the handle in this rest position.<br>
To   lock   the   door,   the handle 3 is lifted upwardly from its rest position, in an anticlockwise   direction.   In this direction of rotation, because of the design of the ribs 19, the<br>
5	handle  tums   relatively  to the latch bar 18 and locking bush 20. The turning of the handle<br>
causes the detent 14 to disengage from the first pocket 12. As the handle body 4 rotates, the camming recess 31 moves into contact with the cam follower portion 30 of spring loaded locking bar 26 enabling the latter to fall into engagement with the notch 24 in the locking bush 20 which, in the indexed rest position of the handle, is aligned with the locking bar 26<br>
10 thereby locking the latch bolt in its extended position. As the door locks, the detent 14 engages the second pocket 13 to index the handle in this locked position. Further anticlockwise movement of the handle is positively prevented by the cam follower engaging the stop side 32 of the cam recess 31. The latch bar 18 is, thus, firmly locked against turning, preventing operation of the latch from the opposite side of the door. The door is thus locked.<br>
15        Returning the handle clockwise to its rest position reverses the movement described above. The inclined side 33 of the camming recess 31 eases the locking bar 26 radially outwardly from the body 4 in response to the latter being turned and causes the locking bar to disengage from the locking bush 20, thereby releasing the latch bar so that it can be turned from the opposite side of the door.<br>
20	In a modification shown in Figure 13 (which is similar to Fig. 7), the passageway 17<br>
in the cylindrical part 6 of the handle has an internal profile formed from an alternative arrangement of longitudinally extending nbs 61 .<br>
In another modification shown in Figures 14 and 1 5, the locking device includes a dog clutch 35 having two halves 36,37. The first clutch half 36 has a square shaped aperture<br>
25 38 and the latch bar engages within the aperture so as to couple the first clutch half to the latch bar. This first clutch half replaces, or is fixed to, the locking bush 20. The second clutch half  37 is   attached   to   the   inner  end   of  the   handle body and has a circular shaped<br><br>
WO 00/71841	PCT/G B00/01920<br>
9<br>
aperture 39 through which the latch bar freely projects.   The latch bar is also freely rotatabie within the handle body passageway.<br>
Each half of the clutch has a pair of lugs 40 which respectively abut against the lugs 40 in the opposing clutch half when the locking device is in 5 its rest position. When the handle is turned clockwise from its rest position, the engaged lugs cause both halves 36,37 of the clutch to rotate, which turns the latch bar 18 to retract the-latch bolt. When, however, the lever arm is turned anti-clockwise from the rest position, the pairs of lugs are disengaged, thereby allowing the handle to turn relative to the latch bar and the locking<br>
1C block to move into locking relation with the latch bar under control of the cam member.<br>
In yet another modification shown in Figure 16, the locking device includes a circular plate 41 which has a pair of opposing arcuate slots 42 engaged by a pair of pegs 43.   The circular plate has a square shaped aperture<br>
15 44 within which the latch bar 18 engages so as to couple the circular plate to the latch bar. This circular plate replaces, or is fixed to, the locking bush 20 of the first embodiment. The pegs project from the inner end of the handle body which is freely rotatabie relatively to the latch bar. When the handle is turned clockwise from the rest position, the pegs are forced against the ends<br>
20 of the arcuate slots 42, causing the latch bar 18 to rotate. When, however, the handle arm is turned anti-clockwise from the rest position, the pegs travel freely along the slots enabling the handle to turn relative to the latch bar.<br>
An advantage of the above described embodiment is that the locking device can be easily attached to one side of a door, replacing any existing door<br>
2 3 handle arrangement on that side of the door. The door handle arrangement on the other side of the door need not be changed. The locking device does not require a receiving cavity to be chiselled into the body of a door between opposite sides of the door or any other form of carpentry work to be performed.<br>
30	Moreover, the operation of the locking device is simple.   With the door<br><br>

closed, the handle of the locking device is Turned upwards, for example, through 45° and this locks the latch bar extending through the door and,, hence, the latch. The door cannot then be opened from the opposite side. However, in the case of emergency, such as a fire, the door is simply and 5 quickly opened by the normal method of pulling the handle down. Practical tests have shown that it is far quicker to operate than any other form of lock, whether this be a key or bolt, and there is no fumbling in the case of panic as it is the natural way to open the door.<br>
In a second embodiment shown in Figure 1 7, the cylindrical part 6 of<br>
10 the handle has a blind, rectangular section passageway 62 extending into the handle body for fining to the latch bar 63 which has an external profile defined by the bar being hexagonal in cross-section. This enables the handle to engage and turn the latch bar 63, when the handle is turned in a clockwise direction from the rest position, and enables the handle to turn relatively to the<br>
15 latch bar when the handle is turned in an anti-clockwise direction from the rest position.<br>
In a modification shown in Figure 18 to the second embodiment, the hexagonal section latch bar has been replaced by a latch bar 64 which has an external profile defined by the bar being "S" shaped in cross-section.<br>
20	Figures 19 to 27 illustrate a third embodiment of the invention which<br>
essentially consists in a modified door rim latch very similar to those in current use and which is intended to be inset within the body of a door between opposite sides of the door. In this embodiment, instead of a latch bar of square cross section extending through the latch and the door, the<br>
2 5 latch bar is split into first and second coaxial latch bar members 44,45 each projecting from one side of the door and having a lever door handle 46,47 fitted thereto for turning the latch bar member. The two handles are suitably journalled and operate independently of one another. The latch includes a latch   bolt   48   which   is   resiliency   urged   into   a   latching   position   by   a<br>
^0      compression spring 49.   The latch bolt has a hollow latch body 50 formed as<br><br>
WO 00/71841	PCT/CB00/0I920<br>
a pressing and having a solid nose 51 for engaging a cc-cperatmg catch on the dcor frame. The latch bar members project into the latch body and each member has a cam 52,53 attached to its end projecting into the body. These cams control movement of the latch bolt and each cam has an acurate flange 5 54,55 projecting from the cam about part of its circumference. The cam flanges are arranged to engage a slot 56 in the top part 57 of the body 50 of the latch bolt and, in the rest position illustrated in Figures 19, 20 and 21, where the latch bolt is urged into engagement with its co-operating catch by the compression spring 49, the radial edges of the flange are in contact with<br>
10 the body 50 and the handles are horizontal. The cam flange associated with at least one of the handles is formed with an additional lug 58 at the peripheral end of the flange opposite that engagable with the end of the slot 56 which, when the latch bolt is in its extended, latching position can engage with a co-operating slot 59 in the bottom part 60 of the latch body.   When the<br>
15 latch is in its latching position, turning of the relevant latch handle 46 or 47 in an anti-clockwise direction moves the associated cam flange 52,53 so as to engage the lug 53 with the slot 59 and prevents the latch bolt from being retracted.<br>
Hence,  if either handle is turned,  for example, through 45°,  in this<br>
20 case, downwardly from the rest position, either cam operates the latch, by means of its acurate flange actuating the latch body, and opens the latch bolt 50 in a normal manner, as shown in Figures 22, 23 and 24. However, if the handle with the locking iug is moved through 453 anti-clockwise from the rest position, its cam lug 58 engages in the slot 59 in the bottom of the<br>
2 5      latch body, as illustrated in Figures 25, 26 and 27, and prevents the latch from being retracted if any attempt is made to move the other door handle. The dcor is  thus locked.    The  non-locking  side  of the door has a handle which will not move from the horizontal position in an anti-clockwise manner so that a door can only be locked from one side.<br>
30	Whilst    particular    embodiments    have    been    described    it    will    be<br><br>

understood that various modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. For example, the locking device could be easily adjusted to be operated by a left-handed lever arm instead of a right-handed lever arm. The direction of rotation of the 5 lever arm can be reversed to lock or open the door respectively. The lever arm may be replaced by a knob. The components of the locking device may be made of any suitable material. In the last described embodiment, a catch may be used to retain or index the first handle in place in order to lock the door from the opposite side. 10<br><br><br>
