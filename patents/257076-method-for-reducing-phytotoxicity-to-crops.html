New Herbicidal Compositions<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the safening of herbicidal compounds, in particular the safening of benzoylisoxazole and/or dione derivatives which are useful for the growing of crops in particular for maize (.Zea mays) and to compositions useful for such treatment.<br>
Discussion of Related Art<br>
An important factor influencing the usefulness of a given herbicide is its selectivity toward crops. In some cases, a beneficial crop is susceptible to the effects of a herbicide when applied at application rates needed to control weed growth. In addition, certain herbicidal compounds are phytotoxic to some weed species but not to others. This may render such herbicides unsuitable for controlling weeds in the presence of certain crops.  To be effective, a herbicide must cause minimal damage (preferably no damage) to the beneficial crop while maximising the damage to weed species which infest the locus of the crop. Reduction in herbicidal injury to crops without an unacceptable reduction in the herbicidal action can be accomplished by the use of crop protectants known as "antidotes" or "safeners". Identification of an antidote which safens a herbicide in crops is a complicated task. The precise mechanism by which an antidote reduces herbicidal crop injury has not been established. In general, the safening effect of a compound is specific to the herbicidal partner and the crop where the active ingredients are applied. Benzoylisoxazoles are known to possess herbicidal properties for example, European Patent Publication Nos. 0418175, 0487357, 0527036 and 0560482. European Patent Publication Nos. 0496630, 0496631, 0625505 and 0625508 disclose certain dione derivatives possessing herbicidal properties.  In general such herbicides are very active against broad-leafed and grass weeds by pre- and/or post-emergence application.  The method of controlling vegetation with these compounds comprises applying a herbicidally effective amount of the compounds, usually with an inert carrier or diluent, to the area where herbicidal corrtrol is desired.   However, the herbicidal benzoylisoxazole and/or dione compounds have been found in some instances to adversely affect or interfere with the development of crop plants, especially maize crops.  The effective use of these herbicides for controlling weeds in the presence cf such crops may be enhanced by, or may<br><br>
require in certain instances, the addition of  a compound which is antidotally<br>
effective with the herbicide.<br>
Although it is possible to say in general terms that herbicides may be used in the<br>
presence of an antidote, the problem in identifying specific antidotes for specific<br>
crops at appropriate rates to control weed growth, is substantial.<br>
The applicants have found that certain compounds, in particular when applied as<br>
described hereinafter, are effective antidotes for the protection of crops, especially<br>
maize crops, from herbicidal injury or the reduction of herbicidal injury caused by<br>
the application of an amount of a benzoylisoxazole and/or dione compound<br>
(optionally in admixture with a partner herbicidel effective to control the growth of<br>
weeds.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide compositions of<br>
benzoylisoxazofes and/or dione herbicides in combination with antidotes, said<br>
compositions providing a reduction in crop injury, especially to maize Ilea mays),<br>
arising from the phytotoxicity of the herbicides, and a method of using said<br>
herbicides and antidotes.<br>

The mixtures of the invention may be used to obtain selective weed control with low crop injury in various crop plants such as maize, soybean, cotton, canola, sugar beet, potatoes, wheat, tobacco, rice and oil seed rape.   Preferred crops include maize, sugar beet, cotton and canola.   Particularly preferred crop species are maize and soybean, especially maize.<br>
Effective weed control coupled with low crop injury is a result of treatment of a plant locus with a combination of a herbicidal benzoylisoxazole and/or diore derivative and an antidote compound in accordance with the method of the present invention.   By application to the 'plant locus' is meant application, for example to the plant growing medium, such as soil, as well as to the seeds, emerging seedlings, roots, stems, leaves or other plant parts.<br>
The phrase 'combination of a herbicidal isoxazole and/or dione derivative and an antidote compound' includes various methods of treatment. For example, the soil of a plant locus may be treated with a "tank-mix" composition containing a mixture of the herbicide and the antidote which is "in combination" , or the soil may be treated with the herbicide and antidote compounds separately so that the "combination" may be made on, or in the soil. After such treatments of the soil with a mixture of herbicide and antidote or by separate or sequential application of the herbicide and the antidote to the soil, the herbicide and antidote may be mixed into or incorporated into the soil either by mechanical mixing of the soil with implements or by "watering in" by rainfall or irrigation. The soil of a plant locus may also be treated with antidote by application of the antidote in a dispersible-concentrate form such as a granule. The granule may be applied to a furrow which is prepared for receipt of the crop seed and the herbicide may be applied to the plant locus either before or after in-furrow placement of the antidote-containing granule so that the herbicide and antidote form a "combination". Crop seed may be treated or coated with the antidote compound either while the crop seed is in-furrow just after seeding or, more commonly, the<br><br>
crop seed may be treated or coated with antidote prior to seeding into a furrow.<br>
The herbicide may be applied to the soil plant locus before or after seeding and a<br>
"combination" is made when both herbicide and an antidote-coated seed are in the<br>
soil.<br>
In a preferred method of the invention (a} the herbicidal benzoylisoxazole and/or<br>
dione derivative and (bl antidote are applied separately such that the antidote<br>
contacts the seed or plant being treated before the herbicidal compound.<br>
Separate application can be achieved, for example, by dressing seed with antidote.<br>
The seed may also be treated, for example, at the time of planting, for example by<br>
applying antidote to seed in a seed furrow or to growing medium (for example soil)<br>
which then covers the seed. The herbicidal compound may then be applied to the<br>
surface of the growing medium (for example soil) or to a layer of soil above the<br>
layer containing antidote.<br>
Apparatus suitable for planting seed, for example in a furrow and applying antidote<br>
to a layer of soil to cover the seed is generally known in the art. Herbicide may<br>
then be applied to the soil surface, for example by spraying a fluid formufation or<br>
distributing a solid formulation.<br>
Separate application can also be achieved, for example, by applying the herbicidal<br>
compound and antidote simultaneously, preferably in a single composition, which<br>
composition permits contact of the antidote with the seed or plant before contact<br>
with the herbicidal compound.<br>
For example the composition may comprise a delayed release formulation of the<br>
herbicidal compound, for example the antidote in the composition is released<br>
substantially immediately and before delayed release of the herbicidal compound.<br>
In one embodiment the method of the invention is preferably performed by<br>
applying the antidote directly to the seed before planting. This is generally<br>
effected by coating a quantity of crop seed with the antidote and thereafter<br>
planting the coated seed.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the method of the invention, the antidotes are<br>
selected from fenchlorazole; CMPt; 4-hydroxY-1-methyl-3-(1-1H-tetrazol-5-<br>
ylmethanoyi)-1H-quinolin-2-one; (S)-MBU and dimepiperate.<br>
The amount of a particular benzoylisoxazole and/or dione herbicide to be applied to<br>
the plant locus or crop-growing area will depend upon the nature of the weeds, the<br>
particular herbicide used, the time of application, the climate and the nature of the<br>
crop. Application rates of from about 0.004kgha' to 5kgha"' herbicide are<br><br>
generally suitaoie, with a rate ot about 0.01 kgha' to 2kgha' being preferred, and with a rate of O.OOSkgha ' to O.Skgha' being more preferred. The amount of antidote used in the method of the invention varies according to a number of parameters including the particular antidote employed, the crop to be protected, the amount and rate of herbicide applied, and the edaphic and climatic conditions prevailing.   Also, the selection of the specific antidotes for use in the method of the invention, the manner in which it is to be applied and the determination of the activity which is non-phytotoxic but antidotally effective, can be readily performed in accordance with common practice in the art. The antidote is applied in combination with the herbicide in a non-phytotoxic antidotally effective amount. By "non-phytotoxic" is meant an amount of the antidote which causes at most minor or no injury to the desired crop species. By "antidotally-effective" is meant an antidote used in an amount which is effective as an antidote with the herbicide to decrease the extent of injury caused by the herbicide to the desired crop species.<br>
The herbicide/safener combination according to the invention may also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of genetically engineered plants which are either known or still to be developed. As a rule, the transgenic plants are distinguished by particular, advantageous properties, for example by resistances to certain crop protection agents, resistances to plant diseases or pathogens causing plant diseases such as particular insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate for example, to the harvested material in terms of quantity, quality, storing properties, composition and specific constituents. Thus, transgenic plants are known which have an increased starch content or an altered starch quality, or those where the harvested material has a different fatty acid composition.<br>
The use of the combinations according to the invention in economically important transgenic crops of useful plants and ornamentals, for example cereals such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, panic grasses, rice, cassava and maize or else crops of sugar beet, cotton, soya, oilseed rape, potatoes, tomatoes, peas and other types of vegetables.<br>
When the combinations according to the invention are applied in transgenic crops, effects on harmful plants to be observed in other crops are frequently accompanied by effects which are specific for application in the transgenic crop in question, for<br><br>
example an altered or specifically widened weed spectrum which can be controlled, altered application rates which may be used, preferably good compatibility with the herbicides to which the transgenic crop is resistant, and altered growth and yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
The invention therefore also relates to the use of the combination according to the invention for controlling harmful plants in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The following non-limiting examples illustrate the invention wherein Antidote A is ethyl 5,5-diphenylisoxa2oline'3-carboxylate and Antidote B is  5,5-diphenylisoxazoline-3-carboxylic acid.<br>
Example 1<br>
Maize seeds were sown in non-sterile loam and safener, dissolved in acetone was<br>
applied to the soil surface.   After 30 minutes a treatment of herbicide. Compound<br>
A [5-cyclopropyl-4-{2-methylsulphonvl-4-trifluoromethvlbenzoyl) isoxazole] was<br>
applied to the treated soil.<br>
A visual assessment of the percentage phytotoxicity (measured as a reduction in<br>
green plant matter or plant height} compared to an untreated control was made 14<br>
days after treatment (DAT).<br>
Maize seeds were sown in non-sterile loam and grown up to a 1.5 -2 leaf stage.<br>
Antidote, dissolved in acetone, was applied post-emergence to the soil surface.<br>
After 30 minutes a treatment of herbicide, Compound A [5-cyclopropyl-4-{2-<br>
methvlsulphonyl-4-trifluoromethvlbenzoyl) isoxazole] was applied to the treated<br>

control was made 14 DAT.<br><br><br><br>
(a) a herbicidally effective amount of a benzoylisoxazole and/or dione derivative of formula di or an agriculturally acceptable sah or metal complex thereof; and (bt an antidotaliy effective amount of an antidote compound or an agriculturally acceptable salt thereof;<br>
in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in, one or more compatible herbicidally- acceptable diluents or carriers and/or surface-active agents (i.e. diluents or carriers or surface-active agents of the type generally acceptable in the art as being suitable for use in herbicidal compositions and which are compatible with the herbicides of the present invention). In preferred compositions the antidote contacts the seed or plant being treated before the herbicidal compound. For example, the herbicidal compound may be in a delayed release composition. The term "homogeneously dispersed" is used to include compositions in which the benzoylisoxazole and/or dione of formula (I)  and antidote are dissolved in the other components.  The term "herbicidal composition" is used in a broad sense to include not only compositions which are ready for use as herbicides but also concentrates which must be diluted before use. The ratio of herbicide to antidote may vary depending upon the crop to be protected, weed to be inhibited, herbicide used, etc., but nomially an herbicide-to-antidote ratio ranging from 1:25 to 60:1 parts by weight may be employed, although much higher rates of antidote may be used, e.g., 1:100 to 1:300 parts by weight of herbicide to-antidote. The preferred weight ratio of herbtcide-to-antidote is from 1:10 to 30:1. Another preferred weight range ratio is from 1:1 to 20:1, with an even more preferred weight ratio range from 2:1 to 15:1.<br>
Preferably, the compositions contain from 0.05 to 90% by weight of benzoylisoxazole and/or dione of formula (1)  and antidote.<br>
The herbicidal composition may contain solid and liquid carriers and surface-active agents (e.g. wetters, dispersants or emulsifiers alone or in combination).   Surface-active agents that may be present in the herbicidal compositions of the present invention may be of the ionic or non-ionic types, for example sulphoricinoleates, quaternary ammonium derivatives, products based on condensates of ethylene oxide with nonyi- or octyl-phenols, or carboxylic acid esters of anhydrosorbitols which have been rendered soluble by elherification of the free hydroxy groups by condensation with ethylene oxide, alkali and alkaline earth metal salts of sulphuric acid esters and sulphonic acids such as dinonyl- and dioctyl-sodium sulphono-<br><br>
Application of the herbicide, antidote, or mixture thereof, can be carried out by conventional techniques utilizing, for example, hand-carried or tract or-mounted spreaders, power dusters, boom and hand sprayers, spray dusters, and granular applicators, if desired, application of the compositions of the invention to plants can be accomplished by incorporating the compositions in the soil or other media. Herbicidal compositions according to the present invention may also comprise (al and (b) in association with, and preferably homogeneously dispersed in, one or more other pesticidally active compounds and, if desired one or more compatible pesticidally acceptable diluents and carriers.   Examples of other pesticidally active ingredients include fungicides, insecticides, plant growth regulators and, most preferably, herbicides.<br>
The optional partner herbicides which may be combined with the derivatives of formula (1) and antidote are preferably selected from chloroacetamides (e.g. metolachlor, acetochlor, aiachior), sulfonylureas, thiocarbamates, dithiocarbamates, metribuzin, sulfentrazone, flumetsulam, clorasulam-methyl, Qxasulfuron, flumiclorac, bentazon, chlorimuron, tinuron, cfomazone, dimethenamid, pendimethalin, trifluralin, clethodim and acifluorfen, bifenox, diflufenican, diuron, atrazine and ametryne.<br>
