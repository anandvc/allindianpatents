				<td>TITLE:	WATER BLENDED FUEL COMPOSITION<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a water blended fuel composition. More particularly, this invention relates to a water blended fuel composition comprising a normally liquid hydrocarbon fuel, water, and a nitrogen-free surfactant. These fuel compositions may be used in open-flame burners and internal combustion engines.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
A major objective of using a water blended fuel is to lower NOx (nitrogen oxides) emissions. In internal combustion engines, such as typical diesel engines for on-road vehicles, combustion temperatures usually approach about 2000°C. Under these conditions, the majority of the NOx produced is from oxidized atmospheric nitrogen that is pulled into the engine's manifold. On the other hand, combustion occurs at lower temperatures in open-flame burners such as in industrial boilers. At such lower temperatures, lower amounts of atmospheric N2 are oxidized and most of the NOx produced by such burners results from nitrogen introduced via the fuel and fuel additives.<br>
Current commercial water blended fuel additive formulations, which are formulated for use in internal combustion engines contain on the order of 1000-1500 ppm nitrogen. The base fuel typically introduces about 100 to about 300 ppm nitrogen with the remainder coming from the additives. A significant portion of the nitrogen contributed to these fuels comes from surfactants which are used to stabilize the water blended fuels.<br>
The problem, therefore, is to provide nitrogen-free surfactants for use in applications where nitrogen level is an issue, such as industrial boilers. Low nitrogen content may also become a factor in internal combustion engines as NOx emission levels are expected to be significantly lower by 2007.<br>
This invention provides a solution to this problem by providing a water blended fuel composition containing a nitrogen-free surfactant. These fuels<br><br>
may be used advantageously in open-flame burners such as industrial boilers. These fuels are also useful in internal combustion engines.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a water blended fuel composition made by combining:<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" and "hydrocarbon," when referring to groups attached to the remainder of a molecule, refer to groups having a purely hydrocarbon or predominantly hydrocarbon character within the context of this invention. Such groups include the following:<br>
(1)	Purely hydrocarbon groups; that is, aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic,<br>
aliphatic- and alicyclic-substituted aromatic, aromatic-substituted aliphatic and<br>
alicyclic groups, and the like, as well as cyclic groups wherein the ring is<br>
completed through another portion of the molecule (that is, any two indicated<br>
substituents may together form an alicyclic group). Examples include methyl,<br>
octyl, cyclohexyl, phenyl, etc.<br>
(2)	Substituted  hydrocarbon groups; that is, groups containing<br>
non-hydrocarbon   substituents   which   do   not   alter   the   predominantly<br>
hydrocarbon character of the group. Examples include hydroxy, alkoxy, acyl,<br>
etc.<br><br>
(3) Hetero groups; that is, groups which, while predominantly hydrocarbon in character, contain atoms other than carbon in a chain or ring otherwise composed of carbon atoms. Examples include oxygen and sulfur.<br>
In general, no more than about three substituents or hetero atoms, and in one embodiment no more than one, will be present for each 10 carbon atoms in the hydrocarbyl or hydrocarbon group.<br>
The term "lower" as used herein in conjunction with terms such as hydrocarbon, alkyl, alkenyl, alkoxy, and the like, is intended to describe such groups which contain a total of up to 7 carbon atoms.<br>
The term "oil-soluble" refers to a material that is soluble in mineral oil or hydrocarbon fuel to the extent of at least about 0.5 gram per liter at 25°C.<br>
The term "water-soluble" refers to materials that are soluble in water to the extent of at least 0.5 gram per 100 milliliters of water at 25°C. The Water Blended Fuel Composition<br>
The water blended fuel composition may be in the form of a water-in-oil emulsion or a micro-emulsion. Throughout the specification and in the appended claims the term "oil" (as in water-in-oil emulsion) is sometimes used to refer to the normally liquid hydrocarbon fuel phase of the water blended fuel composition.<br>
The water blended fuel composition contains (i) a normally liquid hydrocarbon fuel, (ii) water, and (iii) a nitrogen-free surfactant. These fuels may also include as optional ingredients one or more acids having a pKa of up to about 6, cetane improvers, non-metallic combustion modifiers, metallic combustion modifiers, water-soluble salts, antifreeze agents, organic solvents, as well as other fuel additives known in the art.<br>
Although the surfactant (iii) used in the inventive water blended fuel composition is a nitrogen-free surfactant and with these fuel compositions it is desirable to reduce or eliminate the use of nitrogen-containing ingredients, it is permissible to include nitrogen containing ingredients (e.g., various cetane improvers, non-metallic combustion modifiers, water-soluble salts such as ammonium nitrate, and the like) in various embodiments of the inventive fuel<br><br>
compositions  to  provide desirable  performance  attributes to  such fuel compositions.<br>
The water blended fuel composition may be characterized by a continuous oil or fuel phase and a discontinuous or dispersed aqueous phase. These emulsions may be characterized as water-in-oil emulsions or micro emulsions. The term "micro emulsion" generally refers to emulsions wherein the dispersed phase is characterized by droplets having a mean diameter of up to about 0.1 micron. The dispersed aqueous phase for the inventive water blended fuel composition may be comprised of aqueous droplets having a mean diameter of about up to about 50 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 50 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 30 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 20 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.01 to about 10 microns, and in one embodiment, 0.01 to about 5 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 2 microns, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 1 micron, and in one embodiment about 0.05 to about 0.8 micron, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 1.0 micron, and in one embodiment about 0.5 to about 1.0 micron. The Normally Liquid Hydrocarbon Fuel (i)<br>
The normally liquid hydrocarbon fuel may be a hydrocarbonaceous petroleum distillate fuel such as motor gasoline as defined by ASTM Specification D439 or diesel fuel or fuel oil as defined by ASTM Specification D396. The normally liquid hydrocarbon fuel may be a biodegradable fuel, a biodiesel fuel, or a mixture thereof. The fuel may be a residual fuel. Normally liquid hydrocarbon fuels comprising non-hydrocarbonaceous materials such as alcohols, ethers, and the like (e.g., methanol, ethanol, diethyl ether, methyl ethyl ether) are also within the scope of this invention as are liquid fuels derived from vegetable or mineral sources such as corn, alfalfa, rapeseed, soybeans, shale and coal. The fuel may be derived from Fischer-Tropsch synthesized hydrocarbons. Normally liquid hydrocarbon fuels which are mixtures of one or more hydrocarbonaceous fuels and one or more non-hydrocarbonaceous materials are also contemplated. Examples of such mixtures are combinations of gasoline and ethanol, and diesel fuel and ether.<br><br>
The gasoline that is useful may be a mixture of hydrocarbons having an ASTM distillation range from about 60°C at the 10% distillation point to about 205°C at the 90% distillation point.<br>
The diesel fuel may be any diesel fuel. The diesel fuel may have a 90% point distillation temperature in the range of about 300°C to about 390°C, and in one embodiment about 330°C to about 350°C. The viscosity for the diesel fuel may range from about 1 to about 24 centistokes at 40°C. The diesel fuel may be classified as any of Grade Nos. 1-D, 2-D or4-D as specified in ASTM D975. These diesel fuels may contain alcohols and esters. In one embodiment the diesel fuel has a sulfur content of up to about 0.05% by weight (low-sulfur diesel fuel) as determined by the test method specified in ASTM D2622-87.<br>
The fuel oil may be a Grade No. 1, No. 1 low sulfur, No. 2, No. 2 low sulfur, No. 4, No. 4 light, No. 5 light, No. 5 heavy, or No. 6 as defined by ASTM Specification D396-01. The fuel oil may be a Grade No. 3 fuel oil. The fuel oil may be a residual fuel that is heavier than No. 6. The fuel may comprise bitumen.<br>
The normally liquid hydrocarbon fuel may be present in the water blended fuel composition at a concentration of about 50% to about 99.5% by weight, and in one embodiment about 55 to about 99% by weight, and in one embodiment about 60 to about 98% by weight, and in one embodiment about 65 to about 95% by weight, and in one embodiment about 75 to about 95% by weight. The Water (ii)<br>
The water may be taken from any convenient source. In one embodiment, the water is deionized. In one embodiment, the water is not deionized. In one embodiment, the water is purified using reverse osmosis or distillation. The water may be in the form of waste water such as condensed steam from a boiler.<br>
The water may be present in the water blended fuel composition at a concentration of about 0.5 to about 50% by weight, and in one embodiment<br><br>
about 1 to about 45% by weight, and in one embodiment about 2 to about 40% by weight, and in one embodiment about 5 to about 35% by weight, and in one embodiment about 5 to about 25% by weight. The Nitrogen-Free Surfactant (iii)<br>
The nitrogen-free surfactant (iii) may function as an emulsifier and may be referred to as an emulsifier. The surfactant (iii) comprises the combination of surfactant components (iii)(a) and (iii)(b) referred to above and discussed below.<br>
The above-indicated combination of surfactant components provides for the formation of stable emulsions. These emulsions may be characterized by a shelf life of at least about 1 day, and in one embodiment at least about 5 days, and in one embodiment at least about 10 days, and in one embodiment at least about 20 days, and in one embodiment at least about 50 days, and in one embodiment at least about 90 days. While not wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that surfactant component (iii)(a) provides the water blended fuel composition with long-term stability while surfactant component (iii)(b) enables formation of the emulsion rapidly with a small particle size for the aqueous droplets.<br>
The term "nitrogen-free" does not exclude the possibility of nitrogen being present in the surfactant (iii) at contaminate levels. Typical contaminate levels may be up to about 100 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 200 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 300 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 400 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 500 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 700 ppm, and in one embodiment up to about 1000 ppm.<br>
The concentration of the surfactant (iii)(a) in the water blended fuel composition may range from about 0.05 to about 5% by weight, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 3% by weight, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 2% by weight.<br>
The concentration of surfactant (iii)(b) in the water blended fuel composition may range from about 0.05 to about 5% by weight, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 3 percent by weight, and in one embodiment about 0.1 to about 2% by weight.<br><br>
The weight ratio of surfactant (iii)(a) to surfactant (iii)(b) may range from about 1 :9 to about 9:1 , and in one embodiment about 3:1 to about 1 :3, and in one embodiment about 2:1 to about 1:2.5, and in one embodiment about 1:1.5 to about 1 :2.5, and in one embodiment about 1 :2.<br>
Surfactant Component (iii)(a)<br>
The surfactant component (iii)(a) may be a hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid, or a reaction product of the hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or a reactive equivalent thereof with an alcohol. The carboxylic acids may be monobasic or polybasic. The polybasic acids include dicarboxylic acids, although tricarboxylic and tetracarboxylic acids may be used. The reactive equivalents may be acid halides, (e.g., chlorides), anhydrides or esters, including partial esters, and the like.<br>
The hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or reactive equivalent may be made by reacting one or more alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid reagents containing 2 to about 20 carbon atoms, exclusive of the carboxyl groups, with one or more olefin polymers. The olefin polymers may contain about 30 to about 500 carbon atoms, and in one embodiment about 50 to about 500 carbon atoms.<br>
The alpha-beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid reagents may be either monobasic or polybasic in nature. Exemplary of the monobasic alpha-beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid reagents include the carboxylic acids corresponding to the formula<br>
R__CH=C— COOH<br>
wherein R is hydrogen, or a saturated aliphatic or alicyclic, aryl, alkylaryl or heterocyclic group, and R1 is hydrogen or a lower alkyl group. R may be a lower alkyl group. The total number of carbon atoms in R and R1 typically does not exceed about 18 carbon atoms. Examples include acrylic acid; methacrylic acid; cinnamic acid; crotonic acid; 3-phenyl propenoic acid; alpha, and beta-decenoic acid. The polybasic acid reagents may be dicarboxylic, although tri-and tetracarboxylic acids can be used. Examples include maleic acid, fumaric<br><br>
acid, mesaconic acid, itaconic acid and citraconic acid. Reactive equivalents include the anhydride, halide or ester functional derivatives of the foregoing acids. A useful reactive equivalent is maleic anhydride.<br>
The olefin monomers from which the olefin polymers may be derived are polymerizable olefin monomers characterized by having one or more ethylenic unsaturated groups. They can be monoolefinic monomers such as ethylene, propylene, butene-1, isobutene and octene-1, or polyolefinic monomers (usually di-olefinic monomers such as butadiene-1,3 and isoprene). Usually these monomers are terminal olefins, that is, olefins characterized by the presence of the group &gt;C=CH2. However, certain internal olefins can also serve as monomers (these are sometimes referred to as medial olefins). When such medial olefin monomers are used, they normally are employed in combination with terminal olefins to produce olefin polymers that are interpolymers. The olefin polymers may include aromatic groups and alicyclic groups. These include polymers derived from both 1,3-dienes and styrenes, such as butadiene-1,3 and styrene or para-(tertiary butyl) styrene; also included are partially hydrogenated polymers derived from the foregoing.<br>
Generally the olefin polymers are homo- or interpolymers of terminal hydrocarbon olefins of about 2 to about 30 carbon atoms, and in one embodiment about 2 to about 16 carbon atoms, and in one embodiment about 2 to about 6 carbon atoms, and in one embodiment 2 to about 4 carbon atoms.<br>
The olefin polymer may be a polyisobutene, polypropylene, polyethylene, a copolymer derived from isobutene and butadiene, or a copolymer derived from isobutene and isoprene.<br>
In one embodiment, the olefin polymers are polyisobutenes (or polyisobutylenes) such as those obtained by polymerization of a C4 refinery stream having a butene content of about 35 to about 75% by weight and an isobutene content of about 30 to about 60% by weight in the presence of a Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminum chloride or boron trifluoride. These polyisobutenes generally contain predominantly (that is, greater than about 50 percent of the total repeat units) isobutene repeat units.<br><br>
The olefin polymer may be a polyisobutene having a high methylvinylidene isomer content. These include the polyisobutenes wherein at least about 50% by weight, and in one embodiment at least about 70% by weight, of the polyisobutenes have methylvinylidene end groups. Suitable polyisobutenes having such high methylvinylidene isomer contents include those prepared using boron trifluoride catalysts.<br>
The hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or reactive equivalent may be a hydrocarbyl (e.g., polyisobutene) substituted succinic acid or anhydride wherein the hydrocarbyl substituent has from about 30 to about 500 carbon atoms, and in one embodiment from about 50 to about 500 carbon atoms. The hydrocarbyl substituent may have a number average molecular weight of about 750 to about 3000, and in one embodiment about 900 to about 2000. In one embodiment, the number average molecular weight is from about 750 to about 1500, and in one embodiment it is from about 1500 to about 3000.<br>
In one embodiment, the hydrocarbyl-substituted succinic acids or reactive equivalents thereof are characterized by the presence within their structure of an average of at least about 1.3 succinic groups, and in one embodiment from about 1.5 to about 2.5, and in one embodiment form about 1.7 to about 2.1 succinic groups for each equivalent weight of the hydrocarbyl substituent. The ratio of succinic groups to equivalent of substituent groups present in the hydrocarbyl substituted succinic acid or reactive equivalent (also called the "succination ratio") may be determined by one skilled in the art using conventional techniques (e.g., saponification or acid numbers). This is described in U.S. Patent 4,234,435, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The conditions for reacting the alpha, beta olefinically unsaturated carboxylic acid reagent with the olefin polymer are known to those in the art. Examples of patents describing various procedures for preparing useful hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acids or reactive equivalents thereof include U.S. Patents 3,215,707; 3,219,666; 3,231,587; 3,912,764; 4,110,349; and 4,234,435; and U.K. Patent 1,440,219. The disclosures of these patents are hereby incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The alcohol which may be reacted with the hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or reactive equivalent to form surfactant component (iii)(a) may be a mono- or a polyhydric hydrocarbon-based alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, the propanols, butanols, pentanols, hexanols, heptanols, octanols, decanols, and the like. Also included are fatty alcohols and mixtures thereof, including saturated alcohols such as lauryl, myristyl, cetyl, stearyl and behenyl alcohols, and unsaturated alcohols such as palmitoleyl, oleyl and eicosenyl. Higher synthetic monohydric alcohols of the type formed by the Oxo process (e.g., 2-ethylhexanol), by the aldol condensation, or by organoaluminum-catalyzed oligomerixation of alpha-olefins (e.g., ethylene), followed by oxidation, may be used. Alicyclic analogs of the above-described alcohols may be used; examples include cyclopentanol, cyclohexanol, cyclododecanol, and the like.<br>
The polyhydroxy compounds that may be used include ethylene, propylene, butylene, pentylene, hexylene and heptylene glycols; tri-, tetra-, penta-, hexa- and heptamethylene glycols and hydrocarbon-substituted analogs thereof (e.g., 2-ethyl-1,3-trimethylene glycol, neopentyl glycol, etc.), as well as polyoxyalkylene compounds such as diethylene and higher polyethylene glycols, tripropylene glycol, dibutylene glycol, dipentylene glycol, dihexylene glycol and diheptylene glycol, and their monoethers. A glycol that may be used is 1,2-propane diol.<br>
Phenol, naphthols, substituted phenols (e.g., the cresols), and dihydroxyaromatic compounds (e.g., resorcinol, hydroquinone), as well as a benzyl alcohol and similar di-hydroxy compounds wherein the second hydroxy group is directly bonded to an aromatic carbon (e.g., 3-HO*CH2OH wherein $ is a divalent benzene ring) may be used. Sugar alcohols of the general formula HOCH2 (CHOH)^ CH2OH such as glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol, and the like, and their partially esterified derivatives may be used. Oligomers of such sugar alcohols, including diglycerol, triglycerol, hexaglycerol, and the like, and their partially esterfied derivatives may be used. Methylol polyols such as pentaerythritol and its oligomers (di- and tripentaerythritol, etc.), trimethylolethane, trimethylolpropane, and the like may be used.<br><br>
The surfactant component (iii)(a) may be in the form of an acid, an ester, or a mixture thereof. The acid may be formed by reacting a hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid reactive equivalent with water to provide the desired acid. For example, hydrocarbyl (e.g., polyisobutene) substituted succinic anhydride may be reacted with water to form hydrocarbyl substituted succinic acid. The reaction between the hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or reactive equivalent thereof and the alcohol to form an ester may be carried out under suitable ester forming reaction conditions. Typically, the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of from about 50°C to about 250°C; optionally in the presence of a normally liquid, substantially inert organic liquid solvent/diluent, until the desired product has formed. In one embodiment, the hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or reactive equivalent thereof and the alcohol are reacted in amounts sufficient to provide from about 0.3 to about 3 equivalents of the acid or reactive equivalent thereof per equivalent of alcohol. In one embodiment, this ratio is from about 0.5:1 to about 2:1.<br>
The number of equivalents of the hydrocarbyl substituted carboxylic acid or reactive equivalent thereof depends on the total number of carboxylic functions present which are capable of reacting with the alcohol. For example, there would be two equivalents in an anhydride derived from the reaction of one mole of olefin polymer and one mole of maleic anhydride.<br>
The weight of an equivalent of an alcohol is its molecular weight divided by the total number of hydroxyl groups present in the molecule. Thus, the weight of an equivalent of ethylene glycol is one-half its molecular weight.<br>
Surfactant Component (iii)(b)<br>
The surfactant component (iii)(b) may be at least one compound represented by one or more of the formulae:<br><br>
