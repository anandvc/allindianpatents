				<td>PHARMACEUTICAL TABLETS HAVING A RELATIVELY INACTIVE SEGMENT<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention involves layered immediate release<br>
pharmaceutical tablets comprising a layer containing a drug<br>
and a layer either lacking a drug or containing said drug<br>
as part of a different granulation, such as in a less<br>
concentrated form.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The invention derives from the need to solve two related<br>
problems within the pharmaceutical industry. One is that<br>
immediate release pharmaceutical tablets are commonly<br>
broken, and are often produced with a score to aid<br>
breaking, but that tablet breaking is well-documented to<br>
suffer many problems, some of which are delineated below.<br>
The second problem is that combination drug products are<br>
typically produced as homogeneous mixtures or as capsules,<br>
so that a physician prescribing these products, such as to<br>
treat arterial hypertension, is limited in adjusting the<br>
dose of only one of said combination.<br>
Documentation of the importance of the first problem is<br>
summarized as follows:<br>
Many drugs require dosage adjustments, such as warfarin,<br>
the scored tablets of which are frequently broken. These<br>
dosage adjustments through tablet breaking by patients have<br>
been determined to be imprecise. As the following<br>
discussion demonstrates, for many years experts have called<br><br>
upon the pharmaceutical industry to improve the quality of<br>
tablet breaking, yet such has not been optimized until the<br>
current invention.<br>
In 1984, Stimpel et al. ("Stimpel"), described the relative<br>
accuracy of breaking of various tablets for treatment of<br>
cardiovascular problems. M. Stimpel et al . , "Breaking<br>
Tablets in Half." The Lancet (1984):1299. Even though<br>
breaking was performed by a sophisticated, dexterous<br>
person, Stimpel found that breaking was not accurate, and<br>
opined that real world use by patients woul-d provide yet<br>
more unsatisfactory results. Stimpel called upon the<br>
pharmaceutical industry to improve the accuracy of<br>
splitting tablets: "Clearly any assumption that halving a<br>
tablet will not lead to inaccurate doses is invalid. This<br>
potential source of inaccuracy could be even more<br>
significant in clinical situations (our study was done<br>
under ideal conditions) and the pharmaceutical industry<br>
should tackle it, either by improving divisibility (as<br>
already has been done for lopressor and logroton) or, even<br>
better, by marketing a wider range of unscored tablets to<br>
provide all the doses that might be indicated clinically."<br>
Despite that finding and statement, and despite the<br>
issuance of various patents relating to optimizing a<br>
scoring pattern and/or tablet shape, Rodenhuis et al . ,<br>
(2004) noted that: "Improving the functioning of score<br>
lines may be a more practical approach than banning this<br>
dosage form" (emphasis added) . N. Rodenhuis et al . , "The<br>
rationale of scored tablets as dosage form." European J. of<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences 21 (2004):305-308 (hereafter<br>
"Rodenhuis"). Rodenhuis observed that European regulatory<br>
authorities started a policy to discourage scoring of<br><br>
"tablets in 1998. This policy change, according to<br>
Rodenhuis, likely related to "many recent reports of bad<br>
functioning score lines," that "many scored tablets are<br>
difficult to break," and that "many scored tablets show<br>
unsatisfactory mass uniformity of the subdivided halves."<br>
The authors then go on to describe useful aspects of<br>
scoring tablets. For a comprehensive review article on<br>
this topic, see van Santen, E., Barends, D.M. and Frijlink,<br>
H.W. "Breaking of scored tablets: a review." European J. of<br>
Pharmaceutics and Biopharmaceutics 53 (2002) :139-145 .<br>
Some current studies that demonstrate the severity of the<br>
problem are described below.<br>
Peek et al. , (2002), studied tablet splitting by "elderly<br>
patients" aged 50-79. Peek, B.T., Al-Achi, A., Coombs, S.J.<br>
"Accuracy of Tablet Splitting by Elderly Patients." The<br>
Journal of the American Medical Association 288 No. 4<br>
(2002) : 139-145. Breaking scored tablets with mechanical<br>
tablet splitters without specific instruction led to highly<br>
unsatisfactory separating of the tablets. For example,<br>
warfarin 5 mg was on average split into 1.9 and 3.1 mg<br>
tablets. This potent anticoagulant has such a narrow<br>
therapeutic range that 2, 2.5, and 3 mg tablet doses are<br>
manufactured. Biron et al. , (1999), demonstrated that<br>
warfarin 10 mg also often split to less than 4.25 or<br>
greater than 5.75 mg. Biron, C, Liczner, P., Hansel, S.,<br>
Schved, J.F., "Oral Anticoagulant Drugs: Do Not Cut Tablets<br>
in Quarters." Thromb Haemost 1201 (1999). In addition,<br>
they demonstrated that loss of mass due to crumbling or<br>
chipping of the breaking of the warfarin tablets was<br>
statistically significant. They also demonstrated that<br>
quartering of the tablets was grossly inaccurate.<br><br>
McDevitt et al., (1998) , found that 25 mg unscored<br>
hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) tablets were manually split<br>
badly enough that 12.4% deviated by more than 2 0% from<br>
ideal weight. McDevitt, J.T., Gurst, A.H., Chen, Y.<br>
"Accuracy of Tablet Splitting." Pharmacotherapy 18<br>
No.1(1998):193-197. 77% of the test subjects stated that<br>
they would be willing to pay a premium for individually<br>
produced HCTZ 12.5 mg tablets rather than split unscored 2 5<br>
mg tablets.<br>
Rosenberg et al., (2002), studied pharmacist-dispensed<br>
split tablets. Rosenberg, J.M., Nathan, J.P., Plakogiannis,<br>
F. "Weight Variability of Pharmacist-Dispensed Split<br>
Tablets." Journal of American Pharmaceutical Association 42<br>
No.2 (2002) :200-205. They found that "tablet splitting<br>
resulted in an unacceptably high incidence of weight<br>
variation." They recommended that "standards should be<br>
developed to ensure uniformity of split tablets."<br>
Teng et al. , (2002), using a trained individual in a<br>
laboratory setting to split tablets, concluded that "the<br>
majority of the 11 drug products we tested, when assessed<br>
for their ability to be split into half-tablets of equal<br>
dose, failed a liberally interpreted USP (United States<br>
Pharmacopeia) uniformity test. . . The practice of dividing<br>
tablets to save costs or to improve a dosage regimen .<br>
is not recommended for patients using drugs with more<br>
substantial toxicity and steep dose-response efficacy<br>
curves." Teng, J., Song, C.K., Williams, R.L., Polli, J.E.<br>
"Lack of Medication Dose Uniformity in Commonly Split<br>
Tablets." Journal of American Pharmaceutical Association 42<br>
No. 2 (2002) :195-199.<br><br>
Rodenhuis reporred that 31% of all tablets in one<br>
Netherlands study were subdivided before being swallowed.<br>
In the U.S., many "managed care" insurance organizations<br>
encourage tablet splitting by patients including of<br>
unscored, irregularly-shaped tablets. Many drug products<br>
in the US are unscored or are provided as capsules despite<br>
being tablettable. The invention herein provides a means<br>
of ameliorating the above problems.<br>
The second problem has, for example, hindered the<br>
acceptability of combination treatments for arterial<br>
hypertension ("hypertension"). If there were no cost<br>
advantage to a patient in taking one dosage form comprising<br>
two drugs (a "combination" dosage form) as opposed to two<br>
dosage forms each comprising one drug, and if the patient<br>
were as willing and able to take two dosage forms as to<br>
take one, there would thus be a disadvantage to a<br>
combination dosage form, due to the inflexibility of<br>
dealing with changing circumstances such as fluctuating<br>
blood pressure or the appearance of side effects to a drug.<br>
This observation, in the U.S., has been propounded many<br>
times over the years, but combination treatments for<br>
hypertension have proven popular for cost and potential<br>
compliance	reasons,	nonetheless.<br>
In both of the above cases, the present invention provides<br>
a novel and optimal means of ameliorating both of the above<br>
problems.<br>
The prior art as it relates to immediate release<br>
pharmaceutical tablets comprising one drug, or a mixture of<br>
a plurality of drugs within one granulation, appears<br>
straightforward: it has not been taught to place two<br><br>
substantially identical layers in different places of an<br>
immediate release pharmaceutical tablet with an interposed<br>
different layer, or to utilize a drug in two different<br>
concentrations in the same tablet. The current invention<br>
explains reasons why both of the above may be useful.<br>
The prior art regarding combination drugs teaches<br>
separating them into different layers with an interposed<br>
inactive layer (i.e., one derived from a granulation<br>
lacking drug) only when there is a physical or chemical<br>
incompatibility between them. In that case, the prior art<br>
specifically teaches that said "separating layer" be of as<br>
limited a size as is necessary to separate the incompatible<br>
layers. In contrast, the present invention teaches placing<br>
compatible granulations in different parts of the tablet,<br>
with an interposed preferably inactive layer (preferably of<br>
adequate height to allow it to be broken through); or, in<br>
the case of incompatible substances, requiring that any<br>
separating layer be of a height different than the current<br>
teaching regarding layers comprising incompatible<br>
substances.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides an immediate release pharmaceutical<br>
tablet with at least two different vertically disposed<br>
segments, said tablet comprising a drug or drugs, in which:<br>
(a) said tablet includes two or more segments and each<br>
segment either contains the same drug, or two or more<br>
drugs at substantially the same ratio; or else said segment<br>
lacks any pharmacologically effective dose of a drug or<br>
combination of drugs; or (b) said tablet includes a<br><br>
first segment containing a drug or drugs; a third segment<br>
containing a drug or drugs which are different from the<br>
drug or drugs in said first segment and said first and<br>
third segments are physically and chemically compatible;<br>
and a second segment that is interposed between said first<br>
and third segments and that has an undetectable amount of,<br>
or else a pharmacologically ineffective amount of, any drug<br>
present in said tablet; or (c) said tablet includes a<br>
first segment containing a drug or drugs, a third segment<br>
containing a drug or drugs which are different from the<br>
drug or drugs in said first segment and wherein components<br>
of said first and third segments are physically or<br>
chemically incompatible, and a second segment that is<br>
interposed between said first and said third segment and<br>
that has an undetectable amount of, or a pharmacologically<br>
ineffective amount of, any drug present in said tablet;<br>
said third segment has a height of at least 1.5 mm.<br>
The preferred core tablets of the invention are compressed<br>
tablets having at least two compositionally distinct<br>
segments, with a first segment containing an active drug<br>
and a second segment that:<br>
(a) contains the same drug at a lower concentration than<br>
the concentration of said drug in said first segment,<br>
concentration being dependent on weight/weight ratios of<br>
active drug or drugs to excipients within a segment; or (b)<br>
has no detectable drug or the same drug which is in said<br>
first segment in a pharmacologically ineffective amount,<br>
and said tablet also includes a third segment having the<br>
same drug that is present in said first segment; or<br>
(c) has a combination of said drug that is present in said<br>
first segment with another drug or drugs not present in a<br><br>
pharmacologically effective quantity or not detectable in<br>
said first segment; or<br>
(d)	has no detectable drug or the same drug which is in<br>
said first segment in a pharmacologically ineffective<br>
amount, and said tablet also includes a third segment<br>
having a different drug from the drug that is present in<br>
said first segment wherein the components of said third<br>
segment are compatible with the components of said first<br>
segment; or<br>
(e)	has no detectable drug or the same drug which is in<br>
said first segment in a pharmacologically ineffective<br>
amount, and said tablet also includes a third segment<br>
having a different drug from the drug that is present in<br>
said first segment, said second segment having a vertical<br>
height of at least 3mm;<br>
(f)	has a different drug than the drug in said first<br>
segment and said tablet also includes a third segment<br>
having the same drug that is present in said first segment.<br>
The invention involves immediate release pharmaceutical<br>
tablets. The terms "active agent," "active drug," "drug,"<br>
"active pharmaceutical ingredient" and "pharmacologically<br>
active agent" may be used interchangeably herein to refer<br>
to a chemical material or compound which, when administered<br>
to an organism (human or animal) induces a pharmacologic<br>
effect, and which includes prescription and non-<br>
prescription pharmaceutical compounds; and such substances<br>
as pharmacologically effective doses of vitamins or co-<br>
factors and the like. Excluded as being drugs herein are<br>
such substances as foodstuffs and vitamins in recommended<br>
daily allowance guantities.<br><br>
Tablets of the invention belong to the class of immediate<br>
release pharmaceutical tablets formulated with two or more<br>
layers, and are thus non-homogeneous. Tablets of the<br>
invention are adapted to be useful not only as whole<br>
tablets but also to be breakable into subunits known herein<br>
as tablettes, with accurate dosing both as whole tablets<br>
and in tablette form. The invention achieves these ends by<br>
utilizing in most of its preferred embodiments a segment<br>
that is created from a granulation free of active drug (an<br>
"inactive granulation").<br>
It is a primary object of the invention to create immediate<br>
release pharmaceutical tablets adapted to be broken when it<br>
is desired to create a lower dosage (including a dosage of<br>
zero) of a drug or drugs present in the whole tablet, by<br>
allowing breaking through a segment containing no drug, or<br>
else either a minimal concentration of drug or mixture of<br>
drugs (on a w/w basis) or a pharmacologically ineffective<br>
quantity of drug or mixture of drugs, and less preferably<br>
through a segment that contains a more than minimal but<br>
decreased concentration of a drug relative to another<br>
segment in the tablet.<br>
It is a primary object of the invention to apply the<br>
invention both to accurate dosing of- single agent products<br>
and to combination products.<br>
With regard to combination products, relevant introductory<br>
points are: A mixture of drugs within one granulation acts<br>
as a single drug in a granulation from the standpoint of<br>
the separability of one segment from another or from a<br>
portion of another per the invention, in that said two<br><br>
admixed drugs are inseparable one from another. On the<br>
other hand, the invention is very useful in the case that a<br>
given drug, or mixture of drugs, is present in a<br>
pharmacologically effective quantity in one segment, and a<br>
different drug or different mixture of drugs, are present<br>
in different segments. In a preferred embodiment in which,<br>
for example Drug A is present in a therapeutically<br>
effective quantity in an upper segment, an inner segment<br>
that lacks a pharmacologically effective quantity of any<br>
drug is interposed between two outer (i.e., top and bottom)<br>
segments, and Drug B is present in a therapeutically<br>
effective quantity in a lower segment, then the invention<br>
is most useful in the situation that the height and<br>
especially the "effective height" of said inner segment is<br>
great enough to allow said inner segment to serve as the<br>
breaking region of said tablet substantially without<br>
breaking through either outer segment. The prior art,<br>
however, is such that no minimum height of said inner<br>
segment is necessary for novelty of the invention if, in<br>
said tablet, all ingredients of the upper and lower<br>
segments are physically and chemically compatible with each<br>
other, because in immediate release tablets, no<br>
"separating" layer or segment has been utilized or taught<br>
to be utilized in such a case. In the specialized<br>
situation in which there is an incompatibility between<br>
components of said outer segments, then the prior art is<br>
such that any inner "separating" segment be limited in<br>
height to the minimum needed to eliminate the presence of<br>
any of said incompatibilities, for such reasons as to<br>
minimize the size of the tablet as a whole. In that case,<br>
the invention remains novel in any of its more preferred<br>
forms, in which there is an excess of said inner separating<br>
segment to allow it to be broken.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Tablets of the invention are preferably produced on a layer<br>
press, such as a tri-layer or five-layer high speed press<br>
manufactured by Korsch AG of Germany.<br>
The tablets are formed from at least two different<br>
granulations; more preferred tablets comprise three<br>
vertically disposed segments.<br>
Of the many tablets than can be produced according to the<br>
invention, some examples are:<br>
A first granulation comprising amlodipine besylate (or,<br>
"amlodipine") enters into a die at a first filling station;<br>
a second granulation comprising inactive excipients enters<br>
on top of said first granulation at a second filling<br>
station; a granulation substantially identical in<br>
composition and quantity (weight) to said first granulation<br>
enters at a third filling station. After final<br>
compression, said tablet is ejected from the die. Each<br>
granulation, upon full entry into the die and thereafter,<br>
forms a layer. Ideally there is minimal, inadvertent<br>
mixing between different granulations in the formation of<br>
layers, but some mixing is to be expected and does not<br>
alter the improvement in the art of creating breakable<br>
tablets from the invention. Different granulations may be<br>
of the same or different colors.<br>
By convention herein, the term "segments" may be used in<br>
place of "layers" in general in discussing the finished<br>
tablets of the invention, for reasons that are explained<br>
below.<br><br>
A segment represents the entirety of a substantially<br>
homogeneous contiguous part of a tablet. A segment may be<br>
formed from more than one layer, however: If two<br>
substantially identical granulations entered the tablet die<br>
successively, with the second entering directly after and<br>
onto the first, such as at two successive filling stations<br>
during automated high-speed tablet manufacture, then the<br>
two granulations would each form a separate layer after<br>
entering, but when compressed, they would comprise one<br>
segment. A segment therefore is a basic unit of how the<br>
tablets of the invention prove useful. If, however, two<br>
different active drugs, such as different active drugs or<br>
different salts of the same active drug, were compressed<br>
one on top of the other, they would form two segments.<br>
Granulations comprising the same active drug but with<br>
dissimilar excipients would also two segments if one<br>
granulation were compressed onto another.<br>
A segment formed by a plurality of layers that are formed<br>
from substantially identical granulations is called a<br>
compound segment. Compound segments may prove useful in<br>
situations of relatively large quantities of an inactive<br>
granulation, or granulation containing a drug or drugs, so<br>
that two consecutive fills ("feeds") of substantially<br>
identical granulation occur.<br>
Probably the more common situation in tablets of the<br>
invention involves a layer formed from a granulation that<br>
is neither disposed upon nor under (i.e., does not adjoin<br>
and is not contiguous with) a substantially identical<br>
granulation. In this case, a simple segment is formed. In<br>
other words, a non-compound segment is a simple segment.<br>
As used herein, such terms as "horizontal" ("transverse")<br>
and "vertical" when used in relation to a tablet, are based<br><br>
on the spatial orientation of the tablet as, and after, it<br>
is produced in a die, but before removal or ejection from<br>
the die. Current methods of manufacture produce tablets<br>
with one granulation entering the die on top of another, so<br>
that tablets of the invention produced in such a manner<br>
comprise one or more top (outer) segments, one or more<br>
bottom (outer) segments, and optionally one or more middle<br>
(inner) segments. A segment that is not a top or bottom<br>
(i.e., outer) segment is considered to be an inner segment.<br>
Of course, the lateral parts of an inner segment have an<br>
external surface.<br>
If separate granulations were to be sequentially placed in<br>
a die horizontally (side-to-side) and not vertically as is<br>
currently the practice, then the tablets so produced would<br>
be within the scope of the present invention as the same<br>
product would be produced. When the tablet of Fig. 1, for<br>
example, is laid on a flat table, it will tend to lie<br>
lengthwise at right angles to the manner in which it is<br>
formed in the die, so that if the three segments were all<br>
different colors, then the segments would appear to be<br>
arranged not vertically (one on top of the other) , but<br>
rather horizontally (side-to-side). For consistency of<br>
terminology, such segments nonetheless are considered<br>
herein to be disposed vertically on top of each other.<br>
Tablets of the invention are not formed using a cement,<br>
glue, adhesive, or the like, and are preferably uncoated.<br>
The term "relatively inactive segment" refers to a segment<br>
that either contains an undetectable amount of any drug or<br>
contains a decreased concentration of any<br>
drug or drugs contained in another segment or segments in a<br>
pharmacologically effective quantity. By "decreased<br>
concentration" we mean that the concentration of a drug or<br>
drugs in said relatively inactive segment is no more than<br>
80% that of said drug or drugs in another segment, more<br><br>
preferably no more than 20% of said other segment's drug or<br>
drugs concentration; most preferably said ratio is no more<br>
than 5%, however. The concentration of a drug or drugs in<br>
a segment means, herein, the ratio, on a weight to weight<br>
basis, of the drug or drugs in said segment to the total<br>
weight of said segment, which includes said drug or drugs<br>
and inactive excipients.<br>
The tablets of the invention are best broken transversely<br>
in order to realize their benefits. They may be broken in<br>
standard ways, according to the invention such as either by<br>
applying force such as a cutting edge directly to the<br>
separation mark desired breaking region, or to other areas<br>
of the tablet, such as the outer segments, to cause the<br>
tablet to break at the desired location.<br>
The drawings depict vertical cross-sectional views of<br>
tablets and tablettes of the invention. Tablets are<br>
depicted as if they were in the die, so that the top of the<br>
tablet as it is oriented on the page corresponds with the<br>
top of the tablet in the die. In other words, the top<br>
segment of the tablet as viewed contains the last<br>
granulation to enter the die. Tablettes are depicted as<br>
they would have been in the die as part of the tablet of<br>
which they were once parts.<br>
Separation marks are intended to guide optional tablet<br>
breaking in the usual manner that is well known with<br>
scores, so that force will be applied to break the tablet<br>
at or about the separation mark in a direction that is<br>
substantially perpendicular to the surface on which it is<br>
desired that breakage of the tablet will be initiated. The<br>
tablet may be broken according to the invention either by<br>
applying force such as a cutting edge directly to the<br>
separation mark, or to other areas of the tablet, such as<br>
the outer segments, to cause the tablet to break at or<br><br>
about the separation mark and in the direction of the<br>
separation mark.<br>
The separation mark or marks may comprise one or more of<br>
the following:<br>
(a)	a score in a side wherein said score is not oriented<br>
vertically ;<br>
(b)	indicia on at least side that locates aa desired<br>
breaking region of said tablet;<br>
(c) a band which is located on one segment which is located<br>
on one segment or at an interface of te two segments; or<br>
(d) a core of said tablet in which a first lower and a<br>
second upper segment have the same color and contain either<br>
the same drug in a pharmacologically effective quantity or<br>
both lack a pharmacologically effective quantity of any<br>
drug, and a third inner, interposed segment that has a<br>
different color from said first segment and has either the<br>
same drug as said first segment when said first segment has<br>
a pharmacologically effective quantity of a drug or has no<br>
pharmacologically effective quantity of a drug when said<br>
first segment lacks a pharmacologically effective quantity<br>
of any drug.<br>
"Front views" refer to a cross-sectional view of a tablet<br>
that has a theoretical geometric plane passed through the<br>
tablet relative to a side which is arbitrarily designated<br>
as the front. Figures labeled as "side view", which also<br>
have a corresponding "front view" are taken as a cross-<br>
section through the whole tablet from the right side of a<br>
front view i.e. a side view is a cross-section that is<br>
taken by passing a plane through the vertical axis of the<br>
whole tablet at a 90° angle to the cross-sectional front<br>
view. Each front view represents a schematic cross-section<br>
that passes through the midpoint of the horizontal cross-<br>
section as measured from the front of the tablet to the<br><br>
back of the tablet or tablette. The front view is also<br>
parallel to the major axis of the tablet (e.g, for a tablet<br>
with a rectangular (but not square) transverse cross-<br>
section, the longer side of the perimeter is parallel with<br>
the plane that depicts the cross-sectional, front view.<br>
That plane is located half-way between the front and back<br>
surfaces of said tablet. The side views of Figs, lb and<br>
2c-d are taken from a vertically-oriented plane that passes<br>
through the midpoint of the longer transverse dimension<br>
(i.e., the width), and thus are located at and<br>
perpendicular to the mid-point of the front view. Drawings<br>
are of tablets that have a rectangular but not square<br>
horizontal cross-section at the vertical mid-point of the<br>
tablet.<br>
Segments containing pharmacologically active amounts of a<br>
drug or drugs are shown crosshatched; pharmacologically<br>
ineffective segments are shown plain (clear, without<br>
crosshatching or stippling). The upper part of each figure<br>
corresponds to the upper part of a tablet, all of which are<br>
depicted as they are situated within a die after final<br>
compression and before ejection from the die. For<br>
consistency, tablettes are depicted in the same orientation<br>
as the tablets from which they are formed, although<br>
tablettes are created after tablet ejection from the die.<br>
Dotted lines in the tablets depicted in the figures may<br>
represent printed marks or other indicia, or scores that<br>
are present on or in the surface of the tablet and, if they<br>
represent a score, said score does not extend deeply enough<br>
into the tablet to appear in the cross-sectional front<br>
view. The transverse dotted lines reflecting scores shown<br>
in the Figures imply no intention to limit the depth of any<br>
scores of the tablets of the invention. Horizontal dotted<br>
lines on the front views that represent the surface scores<br>
are schematic, and do not necessarily represent the full<br>
vertical extent of a score, printed mark, or the like.<br><br>
Tablettes are depicted with broken surfaces as indicated by<br>
a fine saw-tooth pattern. Such saw-tooth depiction is<br>
schematic and not intended to represent the actual pattern<br>
of breaking of a tablet (or tablette, which often leads to<br>
irregular edges even if said tablet is broken through a<br>
score.<br>
Separation marks in the tablets depicted in the Figures<br>
are depicted as scores that are present on or in the<br>
surface of the tablet and that do not extend deeply enough<br>
into the tablet to appear in the cross-sectional front<br>
views are depicted in the drawings as dotted lines to<br>
reflect the location of said scores on or in the surface of<br>
the tablet (not shown) . It is to be understood that the<br>
depth of a separation mark or other score may be deeper<br>
than one-half the widest cross-section of the tablet in a<br>
particular embodiment, and thus the transverse dotted lines<br>
reflecting scores that are separation marks shown in the<br>
Figures imply no intention to limit the depth of any scores<br>
of the tablets of the invention. Similarly, the tablets<br>
shown that contain scores do not limit the width or extent<br>
of said scores. The horizontal dotted lines on the front<br>
views that represent the surface scores are schematic, and<br>
do not necessarily represent the full vertical extent of<br>
the score. (Perforations or discontinuous scores through<br>
the width or depth of the tablets are not depicted herein,<br>
but remain within the scope of the invention, as are other<br>
marks on or physical changes to the tablet that create a<br>
separation mark.) Any scores or printed indicia that serve<br>
as separation marks are for convenience herein assumed to<br>
be on the front surface of the tablet, which is arbitrarily<br>
chosen from a vertically-oriented surface of the tablets .<br><br>
The "side view" of a tablet is a cross-sectional view of<br>
the tablet rotated 90 degrees from the front view, and is<br>
shown in Fig. 2c and 2d. No dimension of the separation<br>
marks is limited by their depiction as dotted lines in any<br>
figure. Tablettes are depicted with broken surfaces as<br>
indicated by a fine saw-tooth pattern. Such saw-tooth<br>
depiction is schematic and not intended to represent the<br>
actual pattern of breaking of a tablet or tablette.<br>
Figures la and lb depict a tablet with compositionally<br>
substantially identical upper segment 40 and lower segment<br>
44. Inner segment 42 contains trace amounts of the drug<br>
that is present in a therapeutically effective quantity in<br>
each of segments 40 and 44. Interfaces 46 and 48 represent<br>
regions in which the upper part of segment 42 and the lower<br>
part of segment 42 respectively adjoin upper segment 40 and<br>
lower segment 44. The curved interfaces result from the<br>
profile of the upper tablet punch which is curved. Score<br>
52 is depicted in Fig. lb. Dotted line 50 in Fig. la is a<br>
reflection of score 52 on the surface of the tablet (not<br>
shown) , that does not penetrate half-way through the<br>
shorter transverse axis of the tablet.<br>
Figs. 2a-d depicts tablettes formed from breaking the<br>
tablet of Figs, la and lb through score 52. Inner segment<br>
42 of Fig. la no longer exists as an intact segment. The<br>
upper tablette of Figs. 2a and 2c contains segment 80 that<br>
adjoins an intact upper segment 40 and the lower tablette<br>
contains segment 82 and intact segment 44.<br>
Breaking the tablet of Fig. la and lb through the score<br>
placed in segment 42 is clearly easier than breaking the<br><br>
tablet through its vertical dimension, which is currently<br>
the practice with scored layered (segmented) tablets. The<br>
fact that no break is made in the parts of the tablet where<br>
the active drug has been place provides for exceptionally<br>
accurate breaking relative to the active drug or drugs<br>
contained in the tablet.<br>
Fig. 3 demonstrates a two-segment tablet, each segment<br>
formed from a granulation containing a pharmacologically<br>
effective amount of medication. Upper (outer) segment 124<br>
is larger than lower (outer) segment 126. Interface 128<br>
indicates a region at which said segments are contiguous.<br>
A printed mark on the outer surface of the tablet (not<br>
shown) indicates a desired breaking point, as indicated by<br>
the location of arrow 130 that reflects the position of<br>
said surface printed mark. The two segments also have<br>
different colors, however, further allowing identification<br>
of which part of the tablet contains which segment.<br>
Figs. 4a and 4b depict the two tablettes formed by breaking<br>
the tablet of Fig. 3. The tablette of Fig. 4a consists of<br>
segment 118, which represents the bulk of segment 124 of<br>
Fig.' 3. The tablette depicted in Fig. 4b contains segment<br>
112 in an intact form and segment 120, which represents a<br>
less than half-portion of segment 126 of Fig. 3. Interface<br>
116 indicates a region at which said segments are<br>
contiguous. The curved face is due to the profile of the<br>
tablet punch.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a tablet more elongated than those<br>
previously demonstrated. This tablet is adapted, even more<br>
than the others, for ease of breaking through one segment.<br><br>
Upper segment 600 is provided with a therapeutic quantity<br>
of a drug; stippled inner segment 604 is provided with a<br>
therapeutic quantity of a different drug; and, lower<br>
segment 608 is provided with a therapeutic quantity of a<br>
drug different from that found in a therapeutic quantity in<br>
segments 600 and 604. Clear (plain) inner segments 602 and<br>
606 contain pharmacologically ineffective amounts of each<br>
of the three drugs found in the tablet. Interfaces 610,<br>
612, 614, and 616 represent the regions at which two<br>
contiguous segments adjoin. The tablet of Fig. 5 is<br>
provided with a different color for each segment. Even<br>
though there is no surface scoring or indicia, the color<br>
scheme is such that a person's attention may be directed to<br>
apply force to break the tablet through segment 602 to<br>
create the tablettes depicted in Figs. 6a and 6b. Fig. 6a<br>
depicts the smaller tablette created by breaking the tablet<br>
of Fig. 5 through segment 602 in a transverse fashion.<br>
Segment 62 0 has been created by said breaking, and segment<br>
602 of Fig. 5 no longer exists as a intact segment. Fig.<br>
6b depicts the larger tablette created by said breaking of<br>
the tablet of Fig. 5. New upper segment 622 has been<br>
created.<br>
Figs. 7a-c depict three tablettes created by the subsequent<br>
breaking of the tablette of Fig. 6b. New segment 630 and<br>
segment 632 have been created and segment 606 no longer<br>
exists as an intact segment.<br>
Fig. 8 is a cross-section of a three segment tablet, having<br>
a top segment 230 having a drug, an inactive middle segment<br>
(no detectable drug or a pharmacologically ineffective<br>
amount of a drug) and a bottom segment which contains the<br>
same drug as the top segment. This tablet is formed with a<br><br>
tablet punch having a curved profile which forms curved<br>
interfaces 236 and 238 as well as the top of the tablet.<br>
The effective height of the middle segment is H which is<br>
less than the actual height HT of the middle segment due to<br>
the effect of the curved tablet punch. It is desired to<br>
break this type of a tablet only through that part of the<br>
middle segment within the effective height H to avoid<br>
breaking into the drug containing top or bottom segment.<br>
The above-described tablet contains three layers and three<br>
segments may contain amlodipine. It may be broken through<br>
the segment formed from the inactive granulation. Said<br>
breaking, if confined solely to said middle granulation,<br>
will create two tablettes, each containing one<br>
substantially intact segment comprising amlodipine and a<br>
part of the middle segment. The advance on the art of<br>
tablet splitting is that maximal accuracy of dosing present<br>
in each tablette will be achieved, since any weight (or,<br>
mass) difference between the two tablettes will be due to<br>
differences in the quantity of middle segment present, but<br>
said middle segment is expected to have little if any<br>
amlodipine therein. Similarly, any loss of mass due to<br>
chipping or crumbling is expected to occur in the middle<br>
segment.<br>
Fig. 9 is a perspective view of a tablet of the invention<br>
which shows score 701 as a separating mark on a front<br>
surface and top active (drug containing) segment 702;<br>
middle inactive segment (no detectable drug or a<br>
pharmacologically ineffective amount of a drug) and bottom<br>
active segment 706. When the tablet is broken at the score<br>
701, the top segment and the bottom segment will remain<br>
intact.<br>
Fig. 10 is a front view of a tablet of the invention<br><br>
showing a band 901, such as a gelatin band that is used to<br>
seal hard gelatin capsules, which is applied to suitable<br>
tablets according to the invention to provide a separating<br>
mark. Techniques such as those use to band capsules, as<br>
disclosed in U.S. 4,922,682, which is incorporated by<br>
reference, may be modified to provide a band in making<br>
tablets according to the invention.<br>
Fig. 11 shows a series of perforations 100 that may be made<br>
in the surface of a tablet to form a separation mark<br>
according to the invention. These perforations may be<br>
formed e.g. by mechanical or laser drilling l-2mm holes<br>
that extend into the surface to a depth of l-2mm.<br>
Fig. 12 shows a front view of a tablet according to the<br>
invention that has two printed dotted lines that serve as a<br>
separation mark according to the invention.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes a<br>
variation on the above, for example:<br>
A first granulation comprising hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)<br>
enters the die, followed by an inactive granulation<br>
entering the die twice, followed at the fourth and final<br>
filling station by a granulation comprising bisoprolol (a<br>
beta-blocker) . After final compression, a tablet<br>
consisting of three segments (formed from four layers) has<br>
been created. The layer formed from the first granulation<br>
is the bottom layer, the layers formed from inactive<br>
excipients are the two inner layers and together, after<br>
tablet formation, make up the middle (inner) segment, and<br>
the final granulation comprises the top layer, which after<br>
final compression is denoted the top segment. Thus all<br>
dimensions and directions herein relate to the method of<br><br>
manufacture of the tablet. This preferably taller than<br>
wider tablet may contain some amount of HCTZ in the middle<br>
and top segments, and may contain some amount of bisoprolol<br>
in the middle and bottom segments.<br>
After breaking the above tablet entirely through the middle<br>
segment, two tablettes are formed. One contains primarily<br>
the full, presumably therapeutically effective quantity of<br>
HCTZ and probably some amount, preferably trace, of<br>
bisoprolol; the other contains primarily the full amount of<br>
bisoprolol and probably some amount, preferably trace, of<br>
HCTZ, plus some quantity of said middle segment. Important<br>
therapeutic benefits in terms of dosage adjustment, side<br>
effect management, and the like are obtained from the above<br>
tablet design and optional ability to substantially<br>
completely create two individual dosage forms form the<br>
combination product.<br>
As Fig.8 demonstrates, cupping or beveling of the upper<br>
punch commonly causes the peripheral parts of any segment<br>
other than the lowest segment, to extend below the level of<br>
the central part of that segment. In order to fully<br>
realize the benefit of a "separating segment" per the<br>
invention, it is optimal that a transverse plane be able to<br>
be placed between the lowest part of a superiorly disposed<br>
segment, and the highest part of an inferiorly disposed<br>
segment, with said plane passing between an interposed,<br>
preferably pharmacologically inactive segment. The<br>
vertical distance between the lowest part of a superiorly<br>
disposed segment and the highest part of an inferiorly<br>
disposed segment is herein denoted the effective height H.<br>
Generally, that measurement will be from the vertical<br>
height from the bottom of the tablet to the plane drawn<br><br>
horizontally from the periphery of the higher segment, due<br>
to the cupping or beveling of such a segment, and from the<br>
vertical height from the bottom of the tablet to the center<br>
of the lower segment.<br>
The effective height in the case of beveling or cupping of<br>
segments, as easily reflected in the shape of the top of<br>
the tablet, is always less than the height of the<br>
separating or interposed segment through which breaking is<br>
intended to occur. The height of an interposed segment is<br>
the vertical distance from its highest point to the highest<br>
point of the contiguous superiorly disposed segment.<br>
In the case of separating or interposed segments, prior art<br>
limits the height to approximately 1 mm for immediate<br>
release pharmaceutical tablets. The effective height H has<br>
been limited to less than that.<br>
Preferred tablets of the invention often use a height and<br>
an effective height H that are both over 4 mm, and may<br>
exceed 6 mm. Lesser heights and effective heights are<br>
utilized when needed due to size constraints on the tablet.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF MANUFACTURE OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
A tablet is made which has three segments, each with an<br>
active top or upper segment and an active lower or bottom<br>
segment separated by a substantially inactive middle<br>
segment. A Stokes 27-station tri-layer rotary tablet press<br>
is used. All formulations are directly compressible powder<br>
blends. The blending both of the amlodipine formulation and<br>
the benazepril formulation are performed in a Patterson-<br>
Kelly "V" blender. The middle segment consists of 194 mg of<br>
Nu-Tab® and requires no blending. The tablets are<br>
compressed using 0.131 inch by 0.3222 inch oval, concave<br>
tablet punches to a hardness of 35 kiloponds. The bottom<br>
segment is introduced first into the die. The tablet<br>
weight is 310 mg. Tablets so made are 8 mm tall; the<br>
inactive middle segment varies from 5-6 mm in height and a<br>
width of 4mm.<br>
Weights in mg of the granulation comprising each segment<br>
are as follow:<br><br><br>

A similar tablet of the invention is separately<br>
produced using the same top and bottom segments as the<br>
above, but using the following ingredients instead of Nu-<br>
Tab for the middle segment. The following are blended<br>
using a Patterson-Kelly "V" blender.<br><br><br>

The tablets were compressed using oval 0.131 inch by 0.3222<br>
inch, concave tablet punches to a hardness of 35 kilqponds.<br>
The bottom segment was introduced first into the die. The<br>
tablet weight was 280 mg. Tablets with said middle segment<br>
were 6 mm high, and the.inactive middle segment was 3.5-4<br>
mm high.<br>

2 . Place the powder for placebo layer in hopper #2<br>
3.	Place the powder for active layer in hopper #3<br>
4.	Compress layer #1 tablets to desired weight (tablets<br>

(tablets should form a soft compact)<br>
6.	Compress the tri-layer tablet to the desired total<br>
tablet weight (layer #1 weight + layer #2 weight +<br>
layer #3 weight) Tablet should be at desired hardness.<br>
In a similar way, other taller than wider tablets can be<br>
made on a tablet press, such as, the Korsch TRP900 which<br><br>
can produce taller tablets due to its design for deep<br>
filling cams which allow for deeper fills and greater<br>
distances between the upper and lower compression tools.<br>
To make an oval 0.131 inch by 0.3222 inch, concave tablet<br>
that is 12mm tall on the Korsch TRP900 the formulator<br>
would have to increase the weight of the inactive Nu-Tab®<br>
middle segment to about 323mg. Similarly to have a<br>
finished tablet height of 14mm the tablet would be<br>
formulated with a middle segment weighing about 3 8 8mg. If<br>
the formulator preferred, they could use the second<br>
example for a middle layer, i.e., the dibasic calcium<br>
phosphate (DCP) formulation. In such a case making an<br>
oval 0.131 inch by 0.3222 inch, concave tablet that is<br>
12mm tall on the Korsch TRP900 the formulator would have<br>
to increase the weight of the inactive DCP middle segment<br>
to about 410mg. Similarly to have a finished tablet<br>
height of 14mm the tablet would be formulated with a<br>
middle segment weighing about 4 92mg.<br>
•	*	*<br>
The invention also includes the method of administering one<br>
or more drugs via the dosage forms such as tablets and<br>
tablettes of the invention to a patient, mammal, or other<br>
animal in need of pharmaceuticals for the prevention or<br>
treatment of an illness, maintenance of good health,<br>
retarding of aging, or other purpose. Included are methods<br>
of treating a patient with only one drug from a combination<br>
product, such as with a novel tablette of the invention,<br>
enabling downward dose adjustment for a variety of reasons;<br>
or, in a similar vein, a patient may be treated with one<br>
whole tablet containing a plurality of active drugs and in<br>
addition receive only one drug from a similar tablet, thus<br><br>
enabling upward dose adjustment. Combination products that<br>
can benefit from the invention, in which one drug is in an<br>
outer active segment, and a second and different drug is in<br>
the other outer active segment, and a pharmacologically<br>
ineffective inner segment as in embodiments such as was<br>
described above, include those containing the following<br>
pairs of drugs: amlodipine and either benazepril,<br>
chlorthalidone, or atorvastatin; benazepril and<br>
hydrochlorothiazide; olmesartan and hydrochlorothiazide;<br>
and many others, including the majority of the currently-<br>
produced combination products. Also included is the method<br>
of treating a patient with a precise partial dose of<br>
medication from a whole tablet, which may be a half or<br>
quarter of the whole dose, but may usefully be a different<br>
fraction. Warfarin especially may usefully be produced and<br>
dosed according to the invention with separable segments of<br>
the tablet that may but need not be as halves, quarters,<br>
etc. L-thyroxine and digoxin are other examples that could<br>
so benefit, along with warfarin.<br>
The following give possible clinical situations in which<br>
the tablets of the invention could provide important<br>
benefits.<br>
1. A currently marketed product in the United States is<br>
Caduet®, which contains the active ingredients atorvastatin<br>
calcium (atorvastatin) and amlodipine besylate (amlodipine)<br>
which are largely homogeneously interdispersed in an<br>
unscored tablet. The product is indicated to treat both<br>
hyperlipidemia (atorvastatin) and hypertension<br>
(amlodipine). A patient ingesting this tablet daily may<br>
then undergo a blood test and be diagnosed as having liver<br>
dysfunction as manifested by elevation of an enzyme's<br><br>
concentration in the blood. The physician may then<br>
recommend cessation, possibly temporary, of atorvastatin,<br>
which is stated by the manufacturer to be a possible cause<br>
of liver dysfunction. A patient receiving Caduet, however,<br>
would have to thus also discontinue amlodipine, which is<br>
not in this example desired by the physician. A tablet of<br>
the invention in which atorvastatin and amlodipine were<br>
segregated in different outer active segments, separated by<br>
a middle segment of adequate dimensions, would be a clear<br>
advance over the current Caduet formulation, because such a<br>
tablet would allow a patient to promptly continue ingesting<br>
amlodipine while stopping ingestion of atorvastatin,<br>
without having to go to a pharmacy and fill a new<br>
prescription for a tablet containing only amlodipine as the<br>
active ingredient, while having previously had the<br>
convenience of having both drugs combined in a single<br>
dosage form. The above embodiment of the invention<br>
represents an improvement over the current Caduet dosage<br>
form.<br>
Another clinical situation in which the invention is<br>
superior to Caduet is one in which a patient receiving<br>
amlodipine 5 mg once daily and atorvastatin 20 mg once<br>
daily is advised by a physician to increase the daily<br>
amlodipine dose to 10 mg once daily. A patient in<br>
possession of adequate tablets of the invention, with the<br>
active drugs segregated in a three-segment tablet, would be<br>
able to promptly increase the amlodipine dose by taking a<br>
whole tablet of the invention once daily, plus a tablette<br>
containing 5 mg of amlodipine, produced by breaking a<br>
second whole tablet of the invention.<br>
Another clinical situation in which . the invention is<br><br>
superior to Caduet involves the case in which a physician<br>
wishes a patient to ingest atorvastatin 20 mg each morning<br>
and amlodipine 2.5 mg twice daily. The invention provides<br>
for amlodipine to be separated from atorvastatin and then<br>
broken precisely in half. The invention thus allows the<br>
patient the advantage of one tablet, whereas to accomplish<br>
this currently in the United States would require one 20 mg<br>
Lipitor® (atorvastatin) tablet and two Norvasc®<br>
(amlodipine) 2.5 mg tablets.<br>
2. The combination of amlodipine besylate and benazepril<br>
hydrochloride (benazepril) is marketed in the United States<br>
under the brand name of Lotrel®. This product is a capsule<br>
that is routinely ingested whole. An embodiment of the<br>
invention provides a whole tablet containing one outer<br>
segment containing amlodipine as the only active drug and<br>
the other outer segment containing benazepril as the only<br>
active drug. If desired, either outer layer may be formed<br>
into more than one segment, as in Fig. la. As in example 1<br>
above regarding Caduet, the middle segment is inactive and<br>
may be broken through to create two tablettes, each<br>
comprising a whole amount of each outer active segment plus<br>
approximately half of the amount of the middle inactive<br>
segment. If a patient were to develop a need for double<br>
the 'dose of one active drug but not the other, the tablet<br>
of the invention could meet that need. Alternatively, if a<br>
patient were to develop a need to ingest only one active<br>
drug, possibly temporarily, due to such conditions as blood<br>
pressure changes or a side effect to one drug but not the<br>
other, the tablet of the invention allows this to be done<br>
without a new dosage form being prescribed.<br>
3. Another use of the invention involves the combination<br><br>
of amlodipine and chlorthalidone or another diuretic, which<br>
may usefully be combined to treat hypertension. Benefits<br>
of the invention are similar to those described in the<br>
paragraph immediately preceding this paragraph.<br>
4 . Another use of the invention involves the combination<br>
of olmesartan medoxomil (olmesartan, an angiotensin<br>
receptor blocker) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). This<br>
product is currently marketed in the United States under<br>
the name Benicar/HCT®, with the doses, respectively, of, in<br>
mg: 2 0/12.5, 4 0/12.5, and 4 0/25. A very common starting<br>
dose of a patient will be 20/12.5 once daily. The product<br>
is currently marketed in all strengths as a homogeneous<br>
tablet containing both active drugs. Formulated according<br>
to the current invention, a patient who begins treatment<br>
with the 20/12.5 dose may be increased with the same tablet<br>
to each of the other doses by ingesting one whole 20/12.5<br>
tablet and either a half tablet containing 20 mg of<br>
olmesartan or a half tablet containing 25 mg of HCTZ. This<br>
will provide the physician an opportunity to investigate<br>
the new dose before giving the patient a new prescription.<br>
Other advantages of the invention are similar to those<br>
described above.<br>
5. Another useful combination product that may be<br>
formulated according to the invention involves angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEs) and diuretics such as<br>
HCTZ. Both types of drug not uncommonly have side effects,<br>
so that the invention will be useful to physicians in<br>
dealing with the side effects, as well as with changing<br>
dosing needs to deal with the anti-hypertensive and other<br>
clinical benefits of the drugs.<br><br>
6. Another product that may benefit from the invention<br>
regarding separating active drugs in separate outer layers<br>
with an inactive middle segment (layer) is a combination<br>
product containing two active drugs, fluoxetine and<br>
olanzapine.<br>
No limitation to the above therapeutic fields or to the<br>
specific examples within their fields is intended for<br>
tablets of the invention, which may be used in any suitable<br>
combination of drugs. No limitation to two-drug<br>
combinations exists, as well. For instance, one outer<br>
active segment of a tablet according to the invention could<br>
contain levodopa and carbidopa, and the other outer active<br>
segment could contain entacapone, a tablet product<br>
containing all three drugs in a homogeneous fashion that is<br>
currantly marketed in the United States as Stalevo®. Also,<br>
a tablet per the invention could involve five layered<br>
segments, with, for example, amlodipine in one outer<br>
segment, an inactive segment adjoining it, a middle segment<br>
containing chlorthalidone or HCTZ, and a second inactive<br>
Segment adjoining both it and the other outer segment that<br>
contains benazepril (see Fig. 8). If both inactive<br>
segments were of adequate dimensions to be conveniently<br>
breakable without damaging any of the three active<br>
segments, thus providing significant clinical advantages<br>
due to the adoption of flexible dosing of the different<br>
active segments.<br>
The following list of possible combinations of a plurality<br>
of drugs is exemplary and not limiting. The combinations<br>
referred to may include two or more members of the classes<br>
listed. Drugs listed below, and herein, may for<br>
convenience exclude mention of any salt of a drug; e.g.,<br><br>
"atorvastatin" is listed even though its marketed form is<br>
atorvastatin calcium.<br>
Without limitation, useful combinations may include a<br>
plurality of drugs from within the following six drug<br>
classes.<br>
In addition, tablets of the invention may be created<br>
containing only one of a drug from the following list.<br>
With regards to combination use, two methods of use may<br>
apply to the invention. One of these methods is to place<br>
an individual drug in a granulation and a different<br>
individual drug (or combination of drugs) in a different<br>
granulation, potentially with an inactive granulation<br>
interposed between them; another method is to place a<br>

The combinations of drugs disclosed herein are for<br>
illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
Regarding the important usage of the tablets and tablettes<br>
of the invention, that involving division of a tablet into<br>
tablettes containing similar active segments, most drugs<br>
that may undergo dosage adjustment will be preferred if<br>
they may be divided in an optimally precise manner.<br>
Examples of drugs that will especially benefit from the<br>
advances of the invention in this manner include narrow<br>
therapeutic index drugs such as warfarin, digoxin, L-<br>
thyroxine; vasoactive drugs such as amlodipine;<br>
hypoglycemic agents such 'as rosiglitazone and glipizide;<br>
and anxiolytics drugs such as alprazolam. These are<br>
however but a small fraction of the great mass of drugs<br>
that will benefit from the various embodiments and<br>
procedures of the invention.<br>
There are numerous methods of use of the dosage forms of<br><br>
the invention, including its tablets and tablettes.<br>
Persons skilled in the medical and pharmaceutical arts will<br>
recognize the many advantages that the various embodiments<br>
of the invention allow over current products. Some<br>
examples of benefits of the inventions involving tablets<br>
containing exactly one similar active segment are described<br>
immediately below.<br>
1. Warfarin is an anticoagulant marketed in the U.S. under<br>
the brand name Coumadin®, which is a scored tablet.<br>
Research has shown that patients do not break warfarin 5 mg<br>
tablets into equal 2.5 mg segments. The invention teaches<br>
different types of tablets that allow warfarin tablets of<br>
any common human dose to be broken into precise halves, and<br>
potentially precise thirds, quarters, etc. . Thus a patient<br>
may utilize warfarin half-tablets produced as per the<br>
invention with similar confidence as in the whole tablet.<br>
Because warfarin doses are frequently broken, many clinical<br>
scenarios exist in which the invention will benefit<br>
patients.<br>
2. Norvasc (amlodipine besylate or amlodipine herein) is<br>
marketed as unscored 2.5, 5, and 10 mg tablets in the U.S.<br>
These tablets are of irregular shape and are difficult to<br>
break. The FDA-approved dosage range is from 2.5 to 10 mg<br>
ingested orally daily. The invention allows improved<br>
functionality of amlodipine. For example, under the<br>
invention, a patient receiving 5 mg daily who a physician<br>
wishes to increase to 7.5 mg daily may simply utilize a<br>
tablet of the invention that comprises two separate 2.5 mg<br>
segments to increase the dose to precisely 7.5 mg, such as<br>
by ingesting one whole 5 mg tablet and one 2.5 mg tablette<br>
created by breaking a 5 mg tablet into two tablettes each<br><br>
containing 2.5 mg of amlodipine. Convenience and cost<br>
savings are clear. Similarly, a patient receiving a 10 mg<br>
dose of Norvasc who is advised to reduce the dose to 5 mg<br>
daily must currently purchase a new prescription for 5 mg<br>
Norvasc tablets. The invention provides the ability to<br>
provide a 10 mg tablet that may be broken into two<br>
tablettes, each containing precisely 5 mg of amlodipine.<br>
The invention may therefore enable greater flexibility of<br>
treating patients, and provide cost savings as well. A<br>
further benefit of the invention is that various<br>
embodiments allow fully accurate separation of a tablet<br>
into a tablette comprising one-fourth of the dose of the<br>
active ingredient as is found in the whole tablet. This<br>
may for example be done for amlodipine by providing four<br>
active segments all containing 2.5 mg of amlodipine and all<br>
contiguous with the same side of an inactive outer segment<br>
(see embodiment #1; and see Fig. 6a modified to have four<br>
and not two active segments) . Thus, a 10 mg amlodipine<br>
tablet of the invention may be utilized to provide a 7.5 mg<br>
dose; or, it may be utilized to provide four 2.5 mg doses.<br>
A further benefit of the invention may relate. to pediatric<br>
or geriatric doses, which may not be produced in<br>
appropriate dose strengths. In the case of amlodipine, a<br>
1.25 mg daily dose may be useful in either small children<br>
with hypertension, or in frail elderly patients with angina<br>
or hypertension, who may have hepatic dysfunction. Even<br>
though the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<br>
has not approved a 1.25 mg dose, precise divisibility of<br>
the approved 2.5 mg dose would allow a 1.25 mg daily dose.<br>
In addition, precise divisibility of the approved 2.5 mg<br>
dose will allow accurate dosing of 3.75 mg daily.<br><br>
Another use of the invention is to for the first time<br>
enable a method of cost savings to insurers and patients.<br>
The invention allows this because many drugs, such as<br>
Norvasc and Coumadin, have pricing that differs little (if<br>
at all) between different doses. Because tablet splitting<br>
is imprecise for most scored tablets, the practice of<br>
mandatory splitting has been met with disapproval by most<br>
physician and pharmacist organizations. The invention<br>
enables tablet splitting due to provide accurate dosing<br>
when a tablet (or some tablettes, as in Fig. lb) of the<br>
invention are broken as described herein. Substantial<br>
benefits are foreseen from this innovation. In addition,<br>
the ability to separate one active drug from another in a<br>
combination product has cost saving advantages, as well.<br>
It is recognized that related inventions may be within the<br>
spirit of the disclosures herein. Also no omission in the<br>
current application is intended to limit the inventors to<br>
the current claims or disclosures. While certain preferred<br>

forth for purposes of disclosing the invention,<br>
modifications to the disclosed embodiments may occur to<br>
those who are skilled in the art.<br><br>
