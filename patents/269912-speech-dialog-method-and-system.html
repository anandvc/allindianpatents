SPEECH DIALOG METHOD AND SYSTEM<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention is in the field of speech dialog systems, and more<br>
specifically in the field of confirmation of phrases spoken by a user.<br>
Background<br>
Current dialog systems often use speech as input and output modalities. A<br>
speech recognition function is used to convert speech input to text and a text to<br>
speech (TTS) function is used to present text as speech output. In many dialog<br>
systems, this TTS is used primarily to provide audio feedback to confirm the speech<br>
input. For example, in handheld communication devices, a user can use the speech<br>
input for name dialing. Reliability is improved when TTS is used to confirm the speech<br>
input. However, conventional confirmation functions that use TTS take a significant<br>
amount of time and resources to develop for each language and also consume<br>
significant amounts of memory resources in the handheld communication devices.<br>
This becomes a major problem for world-wide deployment of multi-lingual devices<br>
using such dialogue systems.<br>

Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
Before describing in detail the particular embodiments of speech dialog<br>
systems in accordance with the present invention, it should be observed that the<br>
embodiments of the present invention reside primarily in combinations of method<br>
steps and apparatus components related to speech dialog systems.   Accordingly, the<br>
apparatus components and method steps have been represented where appropriate<br>
by conventional symbols in the drawings, showing only those specific details that are<br>
pertinent to understanding the present invention so as not to obscure the disclosure<br>
with details that will be readily apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art having the<br>
benefit of the description herein.<br>
It will also be understood that the terms and expressions used herein have the<br>
ordinary meaning as is accorded to such terms and expressions with respect to their<br>
corresponding respective areas of inquiry and study except where specific meanings<br>
have otherwise been set forth herein.<br>
In this document, relational terms such as first and second, top and bottom,<br>
and the like may be used solely to distinguish one entity or action from another entity<br>
or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order<br>
between such entities or actions. The terms "comprises," "comprising," or any other<br>
variation thereof, are intended to cover a non-exclusive inclusion, such that a process,<br>
method, article, or apparatus that comprises a list of elements does not include only<br>
those elements but may include other elements not expressly listed or inherent to<br>
such process, method, article, or apparatus. An element preceded by "comprises ...a"<br><br>
WO 2006/118683	PCT/US2006/010206<br>
3<br>
does not, without more constraints, preclude the existence of additional identical<br>
elements in the process, method, article, or apparatus that comprises the element.<br>
A "set" as used in this document may mean an empty set. The term "another",<br>
as used herein, is defined as at least a second or more. The terms "including" and/or<br>
"having", as used herein, are defined as comprising. The term "coupled", as used<br>
herein with reference to electro-optical technology, is defined as connected, although<br>
not necessarily directly, and not necessarily mechanically. The term "program", as<br>
used herein, is defined as a sequence of instructions designed for execution on a<br>
computer system. A "program", or "computer program", may include a subroutine, a<br>
function, a procedure, an object method, an object implementation, an executable<br>
application, an applet, a sen/let, source code, object code, a shared library/dynamic<br>
load library and/or other sequence of instructions designed for execution on a<br>
computer system.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1, 2, and 3 a flow chart 100 (FIG. 1) of some steps used in<br>
a method for speech dialog, a diagram of an analysis of a speech phrase, and a block<br>
diagram of an electronic device 300 (FIG. 3) are shown, in accordance with some<br>
embodiments of the present invention. At step 105 (FIG. 1), a speech phrase that is<br>
uttered by a user during a dialog is received by a microphone 305 (FIG. 3) of the<br>
electronic device 300 and converted to a sampled digital electrical signal 307 by the<br>
electronic device 300 using a conventional technique. The speech phrase comprises a<br>
request phrase that includes an instantiated variable, and may further comprise a non-<br>
variable segment. In an example used in FIG. 2, the speech phrase is "Dial Tom<br>
MacTavish". In this speech phrase, "Dial" is word that is a non-variable segment and<br>
"Tom MacTavish" is a name that is an instantiated variable (i.e., it is a particular value<br>
of a variable). The non-variable segment in this example is a command <dial>, and<br>
the variable in this example has a variable type that is <dialed name>. The speech<br>
phrase may alternatively include no non-variable segments or more than one non-<br>
variable segment, and may include more than one instantiated variable. For example,<br>
in response to the received speech phrase example shown in FIG. 2, the electronic<br>
device may synthesize a response "Please repeat the name", for which a valid speech<br>
phrase may include only the name, and no non-variable segment. In another example,<br>
the speech phrase may be "Email the picture to Jim Lamb".  In this example, "Email" is<br>
a non-variable segment, "picture" is an instantiated variable of type <email object>,<br><br>
WO 2006/118683	.      PCT/US2006/010206<br>
4<br>
and "Jim Lamb" is an instantiated variable of the type <dialed name>. The electronic<br>
device 300 stores mathematical models of sets of values of the variables and non-<br>
variable segments in a conventional manner, such as in a hidden Markov model<br>
(HMM). There may be more than one HMM, such as one for non-variable segments<br>
and one for each of several types of variables, or the HMM may be a combined model<br>
for all types of variables and non-variable segments. At step 110 (FIG. 1), a voice<br>
recognition function 310 (FIG. 3) of the electronic device 300 processes the digitized<br>
electronic signal of the speech phrase at regular intervals 220 (FIG. 2), such as 10<br>
milliseconds, and generates pitch and voicing characteristics 315 and generates<br>
acoustic vectors of the speech phrase. The acoustic vectors may be mel-frequency<br>
cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) or may be feature vectors of another conventional (or<br>
non-conventional) type. These may be more generally described as types of acoustic<br>
characteristics. In the example illustrated by FIG. 2, acoustic vectors are represented<br>
by a series of boxes 225 and the pitch and voicing characteristics are represented by<br>
a series of boxes 230. Using a stored model of acoustic states that is derived from<br>
acoustic states for a set of values (such as Tom MacTavish, Tom Lynch, Steve<br>
Nowlan, Changxue Ma,...) of at least one type of variable (such as <dialed name>)<br>
the voice recognition function 310 selects a set of acoustic states from the stored<br>
model that are most likely representative of the received acoustic vectors for each<br>
instantiated variable and non-variable segment (when a non-variable segment exists).<br>
In one example, the stored model is a conventional hidden Markov model (HMM),<br>
although other models could be used, in the more general case, the states that<br>
represent the stored values of the variables are defined such that they may be used<br>
by the mathematical model to find a close match to a set of acoustic characteristics<br>
taken from a segment of the received audio to a set of states that represents a value<br>
of a variable. Although the HMM model is widely used in conventional voice<br>
recognition systems for this purpose, other models are known and other models may<br>
be developed; any of them may be beneficially used in embodiments of the present<br>
invention. The selected set of acoustic states for a non-variable segment identifies<br>
the value 325 (FIG. 3) of the non-variable segment, completing a voice recognition of<br>
the non-variable segment at step 120. The set of acoustic states that most likely<br>
represents an instantiated variable is termed the most likely set of acoustic states 320<br>
(FIG. 3) for the instantiated variable, and the selection of the most likely set of<br><br>
WO 2006/118683	PCT/US2006/010206<br>
5<br>
acoustic states completes the aspects of voice recognition for the instantiated variable<br>
at step 125. In the example of FIG. 2, the most likely set of states for the instantiated<br>
variable "Tom MacTavish" are shown as a series of acoustic states 235.<br>
In accordance with some embodiments, a response phrase determiner 330<br>
(FIG. 3) determines a response phrase using the identified value 325 of the non-<br>
variable segment (when it exists in the voice phrase) in conjunction with a dialog<br>
history generated by a dialog history function 327 (FIG. 3). In the example shown in<br>
FIG. 2, the non-variable value <dial> has been determined and may be used without<br>
a dialog history to determine that audio for a response phrase "Do you want to call"<br>
240 is to be generated. In some embodiments, a set of acoustic states for each value<br>
of response phrases are stored in the electronic device 300, and are used with stored<br>
pitch and voicing values to generate a digital audio signal 331 of the response phrase<br>
by conventional voice synthesis techniques, which is represented in FIG. 2 as a set of<br>
acoustic vectors 245 and associated pitch and voicing characteristics 250. In other<br>
embodiments, digitized audio samples of the response phrases are stored and used<br>
directly to generate the digital audio signal 331 of the response phrase.   The<br>
electronic device 300 further comprises a synthesized instantiated variable generator<br>
335 that generates a digitized audio signal 336 of a synthesized instantiated variable<br>
from the most likely set of acoustic states aligned with the pitch and voicing<br>
characteristics of the received audio phrase, represented in FIG. 2 by acoustic vectors<br>
255 and pitch and voicing characteristics 260. The duration of the pitch and voicing<br>
characteristics are expanded or contracted during the alignment to match the acoustic<br>
vectors generated from the most likely set of acoustic states. A data stream combiner<br>
340 sequentially combines the digitized audio signals of the response phrase and the<br>
synthesized instantiated variable in an appropriate order. During the combining<br>
process, the pitch and voicing characteristics of the response phrase may be modified<br>
from those stored in order to blend well with those used for the synthesized<br>
instantiated variable.<br>
In the example illustrated in FIG. 2, when the selected most likely set of<br>
acoustic states is for the value of the called name that is Tom MacTavish, the<br>
presentation of the response phrase and the synthesized instantiated variable, "Tom<br>
MacTavish" 265 would typically be quite understandable to the user in most<br><br>
WO 2006/118683	PCT/US2006/010206<br>
6<br>
circumstances, allowing the user to affirm the correctness of the selection. On the<br>
other hand, when the selected most likely set of acoustic states is for a value of the<br>
called name that is, for example Tom Lynch, the presentation of the response phrase<br>
and the synthesized instantiated variable Tom Lynch" 270 would typically be harder<br>
for the user to mistake as the desired Tom MacTavish because not only was the<br>
wrong value selected and used, it is presented to the user in most circumstances with<br>
wrong pitch and voicing characteristics, allowing the user to more easily dis-affirm the<br>
selection. Essentially, by using the pitch and voicing of the received phrase,<br>
differences are exaggerated between a value of a variable that is correct and a value<br>
of the variable that is phonetically close but incorrect.<br>
In some embodiments, an optional quality assessment function 345 (FIG. 3) of<br>
the electronic device 300 determines a quality metric of the most likely set of acoustic<br>
states, and when the quality metric meets a criterion, the quality assessment function<br>
345 controls a selector 350 to couple the digital audio signal output of the data stream<br>
combiner to an speaker function that converts the digital audio signal to an analog<br>
signal and uses it to drive a speaker. The determination and control performed by the<br>
quality assessment function 345 (FIG. 3) is embodied as optional step 130 (FIG. 1), at<br>
which a determination is made whether a metric of the most likely set of acoustic<br>
vectors meets a criterion. The aspect of generating the response phrase digital audio<br>
signal 331 (FIG. 3) by the response phrase determiner 330 is embodied as step 135<br>
(FIG. 1), at which an acoustically stored response phrase is presented. The aspect of<br>
generating a digitized audio signal 336 of a synthesized instantiated variable using the<br>
most likely set of acoustic states and the pitch and voicing characteristics of the<br>
instantiated variable is embodied as step 140 (FIG. 1).<br>
In those embodiments in which the optional quality assessment function 345<br>
(FIG. 3) determines a quality metric of the most likely set of acoustic states, when the<br>
quality metric does not meet the criterion, the quality assessment function 345<br>
controls an optional selector 350 to couple a digitized audio signal from an out-of-<br>
vocabulary (OOV) response audio function 360 to the speaker function 355 that<br>
presents a phrase to a user at step 145 (FIG. 1) that is an out-of-vocabulary notice.<br>
For example, the out-of-vocabulary notice may be "Please repeat your last phrase". In<br>
the same manner as for the response phrases, this OOV phrase may be stored as<br><br>
WO 2006/118683	PCT/US2006/010206<br>
7<br>
digital samples or acoustic vectors with pitch and voicing characteristics, or similar<br>
forms.<br>
In embodiments not using a metric to determine whether to present the OOV<br>
phrase, the output of the data stream combiner function 340 is coupled directly to the<br>
speaker function 355, and steps 130 and 145 (FIG. 1) are eliminated.<br>
The metric that is used in those embodiments in which a determination is<br>
made as to whether to present an OOV phrase may be a metric that represents a<br>
confidence that a correct selection of the most likely set of acoustic states has been<br>
made. For example, the metric may be a metric of a distance between the set of<br>
acoustic vectors representing an instantiated variable and the selected most likely set<br>
of acoustic states.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a flow chart of a method for speech dialog is shown, in<br>
accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. Steps 105-125 are<br>
described above with reference to FIG. 1. At step 410, instantiated variables that are<br>
determined to correctly correspond to unique values for at least one variable are<br>
stored into a value attributes database, each identified value being associated with the<br>
stored most likely set of acoustic states and pitch and voicing characteristics of the<br>
instantiated variable from which the value was identified. A new speech phrase that<br>
comprises a new request phrase that includes a new instantiated variable is received<br>
at step 415. A recognized value is determined at step 420 by voice recognition of the<br>
second instantiated variable. At least one most likely set of acoustic states and pitch<br>
and voicing characteristics is determined from the value attributes database's<br>
association with the recognized value at step 425 that has a likelihood of<br>
disambiguating the recognized value. At step 430, a response is generated using the<br>
most likely set of acoustic states and the pitch and voicing characteristics associated<br>
with the recognized value in the value attributes database. It will be appreciated that<br>
by this method, acoustic states and the pitch and voicing associated with one or more<br>
previously received variables can be used in lieu of a newly received instantiated<br>
variable, in order to advantageously disambiguate the instantiated variable.<br>
The embodiments of the speech dialog methods 100, 400 and electronic<br>
device 300 described herein may be used in a wide variety of electronic apparatus<br><br>
WO 2006/118683	PCT/US2006/010206<br>
8<br>
such as, but not limited to, a cellular telephone, a personal entertainment device, a<br>
pager, a television cable set top box, an electronic equipment remote control unit, an<br>
portable or desktop or mainframe computer, or an electronic test equipment. The<br>
embodiments provide a benefit of less development time and require fewer processing<br>
resources than prior art techniques that involve speech recognition down to a<br>
determination of a text version of the most likely instantiated variable and the<br>
synthesis from text to speech for the synthesized instantiated variable. These benefits<br>
are partly a result of avoiding the development of the text to speech software systems<br>
for synthesis of the synthesized variables for different spoken languages for the<br>
embodiments described herein.<br>
It will be appreciated the speech dialog embodiments described herein<br>
may be comprised of one or more conventional processors and unique stored<br>
program instructions that control the one or more processors to implement, in<br>
conjunction with certain non-processor circuits, some, most, or all of the functions of<br>
the speech dialog embodiments described herein. The unique stored programs made<br>
be conveyed in a media such as a floppy disk or a data signal that downloads a file<br>
including the unique program instructions. The non-processor circuits may include, but<br>
are not limited to, a radio receiver, a radio transmitter, signal drivers, clock circuits,<br>
power source circuits, and user input devices. As such, these functions may be<br>
interpreted as steps of a method to perform accessing of a communication system.<br>
Alternatively, some or all functions could be implemented by a state machine that has<br>
no stored program instructions, in which each function or some combinations of<br>
certain of the functions are implemented as custom logic. Of course, a combination of<br>
the two approaches could be used. Thus, methods and means for these functions<br>
have been described herein.<br>
In the foregoing specification, the invention and its benefits and advantages<br>
have been described with reference to specific embodiments. However, one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art appreciates that various modifications and changes can be<br>
made without departing from the scope of the present invention as set forth in the<br>

instantiated variable ;<br><br>
12<br>
a function for generating pitch and voicing characteristics of the instantiated variable;<br>
a function for performing speech recognition of the instantiated variable to determine a most<br>
likely set of acoustic states ; and<br>
a function for generating a synthesized value of the instantiated variable using the most likely<br>
set of acoustic states and the pitch and voicing characteristics of the instantiated variable .<br>
11.	The media according to claim 10, wherein the request   phrase further includes a non-<br>
variable segment that is associated with the instantiated variable, further comprising:<br>
a function for performing speech recognition of the non - variable segment; and<br>
a function for presenting an acoustically stored response phrase .<br>
12.	The media according to claim   10, wherein the function for performing the  speech<br>
recognition of the instantiated variable comprises :<br>
a function for determining acoustic characteristics of the instantiated variable; and<br>
a  function  for using  a mathematical  model  of stored  lookup  values  and the  acoustic<br>
characteristics to determine the most likely set of acoustic states.<br>
13.	The method for speech dialog according to claim 12, wherein the mathematical model of<br>
stored lookup values is a hidden Markov model .<br>
14.	The media according to claim 10, wherein the function of generating the synthesized value<br>
of the instantiated variable is performed when a metric of the most likely set of acoustic states meets a<br>
criterion, and further comprising :<br>
a function for presenting an acoustically stored out-of-vocabulary response phrase when the<br>
metric of the most likely set of acoustic states fails to meet the criterion.<br>
15.	A method for speech dialog, comprising :<br>
receiving one or more speech phrases that include one or more instantiated variables ;<br>
generating pitch and voicing characteristics of the one or more instantiated variables ;<br><br>
13<br>
performing speech recognition of the instantiated variables to determine a most likely set of<br>
acoustic states for each of the one or more instantiated variables;<br>
storing most likely sets of acoustic states and pitch and voicing characteristics of the one or<br>
more instantiated variables that are each determined to correctly correspond to a unique value of a<br>
variable into a value attributes database, each of the most likely sets of acoustic states and pitch and<br>
voicing characteristics being stored in association with the unique value to which it corresponds ;<br>
receiving a new speech phrase that comprises a new request phrase that includes a new<br>
instantiated variable ;<br>
determining by speech recognition of the new instantiated variable a recognized value ;<br>
determining a most likely set of acoustic states and pitch and voicing characteristics from the<br>
value attributes database that has a likelihood of disambiguating the recognized value ;<br>
generating a response using the most likely set of acoustic states and the pitch and voicing<br>
characteristics associated with the recognized value in the value attributes database.<br><br>
An electronic device (300) for speech<br>
dialog includes functions that receive (305, 105) a speech<br>
phrase that comprises a request phrase that includes an<br>
instantiated variable (215), generate (335, 115) pitch<br>
and voicing characteristics (315) of the instantiated<br>
variable, and performs voice recognition (319,125) of<br>
the instantiated variable to determine a most likely set of<br>
acoustic states (235). The electronic device may generate<br>
(335, 140) a synthesized value of the instantiated variable<br>
using the most likely set of acoustic states and the pitch<br>
and voicing characteristics of the instantiated variable.<br>
The electronic device may use a table of previously<br>
entered values of variables that have been determined to<br>
be unique, and in which the values are associated with a<br>
most likely set of acoustic states and the pitch and voicing<br>
characteristics determined at the receipt of each value<br>
to disambiguate (425, 430) a newly received instantiated<br>
variable.</dial></dialed></dialed></email></dialed></dial></td>
