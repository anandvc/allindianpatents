j ^1 High levels of free fatty acids (FFA) lead to an increase of liver<br>
I ^^ mitochondrial p-oxidation, which is crucial to drive efficient gluconeogenesis. The<br>
I<br>
j mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain FFA requires the intervention of two<br>
' membrane-bound camitine-dependent palmitoyltransferases (CPTs). CPTl, the<br>
outer mitochondrial membrane enzyme, catalyzes the formation of long-chain<br>
I acylcamitines. Liver (L-CPTl) and muscle (M-CPTl) CPTl isoforms are encoded<br>
1 by two different genes and inhibited by malonyl-CoA. The N-ter domain of L-<br>
1 CPTl confers its lower sensitivity to malonyl CoA. CPT2, the inner mitochondrial<br>
I membrane enzyme, reconverts long-chain acylcamitines into long-chain acyl CoA<br>
I esters. Long-chain acyl-CoAs are then p-oxidized to acetyl-CoA, which activates<br>
i<br>
I the pyruvate carboxylase and gluconeogenesis. According to the mechanism of<br>
i action described above, pharmaceutically active substances which inhibit L-CPTl<br>
I reduce liver P-oxidation, consequently inhibit gluconeogenesis and therefore<br>
I counteract hyperglycemia.<br>
i<br>
j The present invention relates to novel compoimds which inhibit liver<br>
carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (L-CPTl) activity. The compoimds of the present<br>
', invention can be used as pharmaceutically active agents which are useful in the<br>
prevention and/or treatment of diseases which are modulated by L-CPTl<br>
inhibitors, particularly diseases which are related to hyperglycemia and/or glucose<br>
tolerance disorders. Such diseases include e.g. diabetes and associated pathologies,<br>
1 non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (also refisrred to as diabetes type II),<br>
j obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome,<br>
I hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolemia, fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis,<br>
I congestive heart failure and renal failure.<br>

Mk Compounds which carry an acid isostere such as 5-oxo-4H-<br>
^^^ [l,2,4]thiadiazol-3-yl, e.g. as a substituent on R^, can be obtained by starting from<br>
the corresponding N-hydroxy-benzamidines. The N-hydroxy-benzamidines can be<br>
converted to the desired compounds using methods well known to somebody<br>
skilled in the art, e.g. intramolecular thiocarbamate formation. The reaction is<br>
typically carried out in an aprotic solvent like dimethyl-formamide, dimethyl<br>
sulfoxide, acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran or dichloromethane or mixtures thereof in<br>
the presence of a Lewis acid. A typically used reagent is 1,1'-<br>
thiocarbonyldiimidazole and a typical acids is boron trifluoride.<br>
Compoimds which carry a tertiary hydroxyl, e.g. in a substituent on R^, can<br>
be obtained by starting from the corresponding ketones. The ketones are obtained<br>
as described in schemes 1-14 by employing an appropriate (alkylcarbonyl)-aminoarene<br>
in the amide formation step. The Ketones can be converted to the desired<br>
compounds using methods well known to somebody skilled in the art, e.g.<br>
Grignard addition or addition of other organometallic reagents, or reagents capable<br>
of generating a nucleophilic carbon under the reaction conditions. The reaction is<br>
typically carried out in an aprotic solvent like tetrahydrofuran, ether or<br>
dichloromethane or mixtures thereof at temperatures between -80°C and 25°C<br>
under anhydrous conditions.<br>
Compoimds of formula (I) which comprise an acid group such as COOH or<br>
an acid isostere can form salts with physiologically compatible bases. Examples of<br>
such salts are alkaline, earth-alkaline and ammonium salts such as e.g. sodiimi,<br>
potassium, calcium and trimethylammonium salt. One method to form such a salt<br>
is e.g. by addition of 1/n equivalents of a basic salt such as e.g. M(OH)n, wherein<br>
M = metal or ammonium cation and n = number of hydroxide anions, to a solution<br>
of the compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. ethanol, ethanol-water mixture,<br>
tetrahydrofuran-water mixture) and to remove the solvent by evaporation or<br>
lyophilisation.<br>
The conversion of compoimds of formula (I) into pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable esters can be carried out e.g. by treatment of a suitable carboxy group<br>
present in the molecule with a suitable alcohol using e.g. a condensating reagent<br>
such as benzotriazol-l-yloxytris(dimethylamino)phosphonium<br>
hexafluorophosphate (BOP), N,N-dicylohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), N-(3-<br>
46 J<br>
^ . dimethylaminopropyl)-N'-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI) or 0-(l,2-<br>
^^ dihydro-2-oxo-l-pyridyl)-N,N,N,N-tetra-methyluronium-tetrafluoroborate<br>
(TPTU). Pharmaceutically acceptable esters can furthermore be prepared by<br>
treatment of a suitable hydroxy group present in the molecule with a suitable acid,<br>
optionally or if necessary in the presence of a condensating agent as described<br>
above.<br>
Insofar as their preparation is not described in the examples, the compounds ;<br>
of formula (I) as well as all intermediate products can be prepared according to<br>
analogous methods or according to the methods set forth above. Starting materials<br>
are commercially available, known in the art or can be prepared by methods known<br>
in the art or in analogy thereto.<br>

The following tests were carried out in order to determine the activity of the<br>
compounds of the present invention. Background information on the performed<br>
assays can be found in: Jackson et al., 1999, Biochem. J. 341, 483-489 and Jackson<br>

Human liver and muscle CPTl cDNAs and rat CPT2 cDNA were I<br>
subcloned in pGAPZB or pGAPZA, respectively. These plasmids were used to<br>
transform P. pastoris strain X-33 via electroporation after the preparation of<br>
48 ;<br>
^Pl electrocompetent cells. High copy number clones were selected where necessary<br>
^ ^ using 0.5 or 1 mg/ml Zeocin. Cultures for activity measurements were induced for<br>
16 h in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose). Crude cell<br>
extracts were prepared by disrupting the cells with glass beads or French Press,<br>
depending on fermenter sizes. After centrifugation, the cell-free extracts were<br>
resuspended in cell breaking buffer (50 mM Tris, pH7.4, 100 mM KCl, ImM<br>
EDTA) in the presence of a protease inhibitor cocktail, before aliquoting and<br>
freezing at -20°C.<br>
CPT activity was measured using a spectrophotometric assay using 5,5'-<br>
dithio-W5-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) also called Ellman's reagent. The HSCoA<br>
released on the formation of acylcamitine from carnitine (500 \JM) and<br>
pahnitoyl-CoA (80 |JM) reduced DTNB (300 |JM) forming 5-mercapto-(2-<br>

13600 M'cm'. The assay buffer contained 120 mM KCl, 25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA. This assay was used for the identification of selective inhibitors of the<br>
liver CPTl isoform versus the muscle CPTl and CPT2 isoforms.<br>
The compoimds according to formula (I) preferably have an IC50 value i<br>

The compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts<br>
can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for<br>
enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for<br>
example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft<br>
gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally, e.g. in the form of<br>
suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or suspensions or<br>
infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils. Oral<br>
administration is preferred.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a<br>
manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the<br>
described compounds of formula I and/or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts,<br>
optionally in combination with other therapeutically valuable substances, into a<br>
galenical administration form together wifli suitable, non-toxic, inert,<br>
therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual<br>
pharmaceutical adjirvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also<br>
organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, com starch or derivatives<br>
thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets,<br>
coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for<br>
soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid<br>
and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers<br>
might, however, be required in the case of soft gelatine capsules). Suitable carrier<br>
materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water,<br>
polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection<br>
solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils.<br>
Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened<br>
oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for<br>
topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides,<br>
hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols,<br>
polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>

^k Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents,<br>
^ ^ consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the<br>
osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and<br>
antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compoimds of formula I can vary vv^ithin wide limits<br>
depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of<br>
the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the<br>
individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of<br>
about 1 to 2000 mg, especially about 1 to 500 mg, comes into consideration.<br>
Depending on severity of the disease and the precise pharmacokinetic profile the<br>
compoimd could be administered with one or several daily dosage units, e.g. in 1<br>
to 3 dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 1-500 mg,<br>
preferably 1-200 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
