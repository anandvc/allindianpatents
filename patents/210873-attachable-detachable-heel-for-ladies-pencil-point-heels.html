				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>The most beautiful and elegant footwear of the ladies, Pencil point sandal heels. In olden times all ladies young and old competed with each other in wearing slender and tall pencil point heels. These days we noticed these beautiful pencil point heels being replaced by short, fat and in comparison ugly heels. It appear that the reason for this is the increase in pace of life and also that pencil point heels sink into the soft soil outdoors making the ladies loose their balance. In order to preserve the beautiful pencil point heel the Attachable Detachable large area supporting base element has been invented with a greater supporting surface for the pencil point heel thereby helping the lady to balance as well as to walk on soft soil. The object of this invention being to preserve in future the beautiful pencil point heels for lady&#x27;s sandals and shoes.</td>

				<td>LADIES PENCIL HEEL ENLARGED AREA WEIGHT DISTRIBUTING AND SUPPORTING ELEMENT - ATTACHABLE DETACHABLE<br>
This application is an Addition to Indian Patent Application No. 7/DEL/98 dated 1/1/98. This Indian Application was filed as a Provisional on - 1/1/98 and followed by a Complete Application on 30/3/99..<br>
Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel ladies pencil heel enlarged area weight distributing and supporting element - attachable detachable. As such, specifically, the invention is directed to a novel innovation for an attachable / detachable base element which when attached to the pencil point heel provides it with an element having an enlarged supporting area enabling her to balance properly and also when a lady goes from the hard floor of an indoor party after attaching the base element to her pencil point heel onto the soft soil of an outdoor garden party the enlarged surface of the base element will prevent the pencil point heel from sinking into the soft soil. There are atleast 8 different preferred embodiments of this attachable - detachable base element.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As the Point of the pencil point heel has a very small area, most of the weight of the user acting upon it makes it sink into the soft soil at a garden party causing the wearer discomfort and she looses her balance preventing her from moving around comfortably.<br>
As a solution to this, the applicant has filed a Provisional Specification in Indian Patent application No. 7/DEL/98 on 1/1/98 followed by a Complete Specification submitted at the Patent Office on 30/3/99 at Delhi, wherein is described an invention relating to "Click on Heels" which can be clicked on to ladies pencil point high heels and taken off at will within few seconds. This invention is a device having a flat platform pencil point supporting base element the front end having a tongue, which fits under the ball of the<br>
foot between the leather and the rubber sole. The rear end of this flat heel has a mechanism, which clicks it on to the pencil point heel.<br>
The primary disadvantage of this device described in this Provisional and Complete Specification is that it is rather complicated and involves many components assembled together. Yet another disadvantage is that the shoe may have to be taken off in order to fix the attachable heel in short it is not a user-friendly embodiment.<br>
Accordingly, in recognition of this fact that the users of the attachable heels being ladies prefer simple constructions, which are elegant, with a good appearance and being cost-effective, the applicant in the present invention provides other more user-friendly embodiments which are pushed in/ pulled out, screwed on/ screwed off and pushed on/pulled off attachable detachable supporting base element having an enlarged area that prevents the pencil point heel from sinking into the soft soil. The attachable detachable supporting base elements having 7 to 10 times enlarged area on being attached to the pencil point heel thereby distributes the ladies weight on the heels over this enlarged base area preventing the heels from sinking into the soft soil and enabling the wearer to stride over any kind of soft soil or surface comfortably.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the invention is to provide a push in/ pull out, screw on / screw off and push on / pull off attachable/detachable enlarged area supporting base element for a pencil point heel that permits the pencil point shoe heel to be used on all sorts of surfaces by distributing the weight of pencil point heel over an enlarged area preventing it from sinking into the soft soil.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide for a shoe an attachable/detachable pencil point enlarged area supporting base element of several different embodiments that can be easily and quickly attached and detached from a ladies pencil point shoe heel.<br>
Another object of this invention is that these supporting base elements are made small enough to be carried in a ladies bag to give her the option to attach or detach them at her free will.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides attachable - detachable supporting base element primarily comprising a base element having surface area sufficient to distribute the weight and these elements may be pushed in / pulled out, screwed on / screwed off or pushed on / pulled off to engage / receive the lower end of the ladies pencil point shoe or sandal heel.<br>
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The accompanying drawings describe the invention and illustrate various preferred embodiments having different shapes and sizes, wherein 8 embodiments have been described each on a separate drawing. Each of these drawings shows the embodiments side view, plan view and rear view of the sandal or shoe attached with a pencil point heel base-supporting element. Each embodiment also shows separately a pencil point heel enlarged surface base supporting element, which prevents the pencil point heel from sinking into the soft soil. As such there are 8 separate drawings each having 4 Figures as such on 8 drawing we have 4 x 8 = 32 Figures. For complete understanding please referred to the Detail Description.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention describes an attachable - detachable pencil point heel-supporting element having an enlarged surface area whereby the weight gets distributed and the pressure per unit area goes down for supporting the maximum body weight of a lady on her pencil point heel. As a result helping her to balance better &amp; preventing the pencil point heel from sinking into the soft soil. This happens when a lady after attaching the pencil point heel base-supporting element goes from the hard floor to a soft or sandy soil. The shape of the enlarged base element is immaterial as long as it serves the<br>
purpose. The shape may be round, square or hexagonal as may be demanded by the customer<br>
In general the pencil point heel supporting base element could be of steel/acrylic with a rubber sole stuck firmly underneath it, in another case an aluminium plate may be inserted and stuck firmly between the steel/acrylic and rubber sole. Screws fixed in the heel with a screw on and screw off pencil point supporting element or push in and pull out base supporting element or else a push on and pull off base supporting element. Besides this special embodiment is a box type base-supporting element.<br>
