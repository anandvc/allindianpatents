				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
EXHAUST-GAS CONVERTING APPARATUS TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[000l] The present invention relates to an exhaust-gas converting apparatus for converting exhaust gas, which is emitted from internal-combustion engine for automobile, and the like; particularly it relates to an NOX storage-and-reduction type exhaust-gas converting apparatus that is optimum for converting exhaust gases from lean-burn engine.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002] Recently, the global warming phenomena that result from carbon dioxide have become problems, and reducing the emission of carbon dioxide has become an assignment. Even in automobiles, the reduction of carbon dioxide in the exhaust gases has become an assignment, and accordingly lean-burn engine for lean burning fuel in oxygen-rich atmosphere has been used. Since the usage amount of fuel is reduced by means of this lean-burn engine, it is possible to suppress the emission of carbon dioxide.<br>
[0003] And, as a catalyst for converting harmful components in exhaust gases from lean-burn engine, an NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst has been known, NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst on which an NOX storage material being selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals and rare-earth elements is supported along with a noble metal. Using this NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, and controlling the composition of air-fuel mixture so as to turn it into stoichiometric-rich atmosphere in pulsating manner in the course of lean atmosphere, it is possible effectively to develop the oxidation of HC and CO and the reduction<br>
of NOX efficiently, and thereby high converting performance is obtainable.<br>
[0004] However, in general NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, there is such a problem that the NOX storage amount in low-temperature regions is insufficient.<br>
[0005] Moreover, in exhaust gases, SOX, which sulfur (S) being included in fuel burns to generate, is included, and then they are oxidized to turn into SOs by means of catalytic metal in oxygen-rich atmosphere. And, since it is readily turned into sulfurous acid or sulfuric acid by means of water vapor that is likewise included in the exhaust gases, and since these react with NOX storage material to generate sulfites and sulfates, it has become apparent that the NOX storage material has been poisoned to deteriorate. In addition, since porous supporter, such as alumina, has a property of being likely to store SOX, there has been such a problem that the aforementioned sulfur poisoning has been facilitated.<br>
[0006] And, when NOX storage material thus turns into sulfites and sulfates, it becomes difficult to store NOX any further, and there has been such a problem that the after-durability converting performance for NOX has declined.<br>
[0007] Hence, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Gazette No. 2002-11,347, an SOX storage material is set forth, SOX storage material which includes a composite oxide including a rare-earth element and an aluminum oxide, and putting this SOX storage material in place on an upstream side of an NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst is set forth therein.<br>
[0008] Moreover, in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Gazette No. 2001-113,172, a catalyst for converting exhaust gas is<br>
proposed, catalyst in which a barrier layer for suppressing the diffusion of SOX is disposed on an NOX storage-and-reduction catalytic layer as an upper layer. The barrier layer includes an inorganic oxide on which a noble metal and a transition metal are supported. In accordance with this catalyst for converting exhaust gas, since the noble metal oxidized S at the barrier layer in lean atmosphere and then the generated SOX are captured firmly by the transition metal, the SOX are suppressed from diffusing to a lower layer, the NOX storage-and-reduction catalytic layer. And, the noble metal of the barrier layer reduces SOX in stoichiometric-rich atmosphere, then the bond between the transitionmetal and the SOX are disconnected, and thereby the SOX are released from the barrier layer. Therefore, the SOX storage ability of the barrier layer hardly saturates.<br>
[0009] Hence, it is possible to think of putting a catalyst in which only the barrier layer as set forth in Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication (KOKAI) Gazette No. 2001-116,172 is formed in place on an upstream side of an NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst.<br>
[0010] In accordance with an exhaust-gas converting apparatus in which a storage catalyst on which an SOX storage material being capable of storing SOX is thus put in place on an upstream side of an NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, it is possible to suppress the sulfur poisoning of the downstream-side NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst. Moreover, since storing SOX means storing NOX as well, there might be a case where such an advantage is obtainable that the NOX storage amount in low-temperature regions increases.<br>
[0011] However, in conventional storage catalyst, since there is a limitation on the supporting amount of SOX storage material so that the storage performance of SOX is not sufficient, there has<br>
been such a problem that the sulfur poisoning of NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, which is put in place on a downstream side, cannot be prevented sufficiently. Moreover, in a case where an SOX storage material is supported in a large amount, there has been such a problem that the SOX storage material reacts with a supporter substrate so that the strength of the supporter substrate has declined considerably.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION Assignment to be Solved by the Invention<br>
[0012] The present invention is one which has been done in view of the aforementioned circumstances, and it is an assignment to be solved to augment the SOX storage amount of storage catalyst that is put in place on an upstream side of NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst and additionally to augment the NOX storage amount in low-temperature regions as well.<br>
Means for Solving the Assignment<br>
[0013] A characteristic of an exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to the present invention which solves the aforementioned assignment lies in that it is an exhaust-gas converting apparatus including: a storage catalyst for storing NOX and SOX; and an NOX. storage-and-reduction catalyst being put in place on an exhaust-gas-flow downstream side of the storage catalyst, and in that<br>
the storage catalyst includes:<br>
a supporter substrate, which is formed of at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A12O3, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite, and whose specific surface area is 30 m2/g or more;<br>
and<br>
a coating layer, which is formed on a surface of the supporter substrate, and which includes : a supporting powder including at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A1203, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite; a storage material for storing NOX and SOX, the storage material being supported on the supporting powder; and a noble metal being supported on the supporting powder.<br>
[0014] It is desirable to include the aforementioned storage material in the supporter substrate as well.<br>
Effect of the Invention<br>
[0015] In accordance with the exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to the present invention, the storage catalyst uses the supporter substrate, which is formed of at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A1203, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite, and whose specific surface area is 30 m2/g or more. Since this supporter substrate has a large specific surface area, the supporting amount of the storage material for storing NOX and SOX augments remarkably, and thereby the SOX storage amount and NOX storage amount in low-temperature regions augment markedly. Moreover, since the supporter substrate that is formed of such qualities of material is less likely to react with the storage material for storing NOX and SOX, there is not such a problem that the strength of the supporter substrate has declined, either.<br>
[0016] Therefore, the NOX converting performance improves as an exhaust-gas converting apparatus as a whole, and additionally the<br>
durability improves because it is possible to prevent the sulfur poi son ing of the downs t ream- side NOX s t or age-and-reduction catalyst.<br>

Explanation on Reference Numerals [0018]     1: Engine;<br>
2: Catalytic Converter; 3: Storage Catalyst; and 4: NOX Storage-and-Reduction Catalyst Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
[0019] An exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to the present invention includes a storage catalyst for storing NOX and SOX, and an NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst being put in place on an exhaust-gas-f low downstream side of the storage catalyst. Of these, for the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, it is possible to use one that is the same as the conventional one that is constituted of a porous oxide supporter, a noble metal being supported on the porous oxide supporter, and an NOK storage material being selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals and rare-earth elements and being supported on the porous oxide supporter.<br>
[0020] As for the porous oxide supporter that is used for the NOX<br>
s t or age-and-reduction catalyst, it is possible to use alumina, silica, silica-alumina, zirconia, titania, zeolite, or the like.  It can be one member of these, or it is possible to mix or composite plural members of these to use. Among them, it is preferable to use y -alumina whose activities are high.<br>
[ 0021 ] As for the noble metal that is used for the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, Pt, Rh, Pd, Ir, and the like, can be exemplified. Among them, Pt whose activities are high is especially preferable. Moreover, it is preferable to set a supporting amount of the noble metal at 0.1-10 g per 1-L catalyst. When it is less than this, the converting activities become insufficient; and, when supporting it more than this, the effects saturate and additionally that has become costly.<br>
[0022] Moreover, it is desirable to set a supporting amount of the NOX storage material in the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst in a range of 0.01-2 mol per 1-L catalyst. When the supporting amount is less that this range, the NOX converting capacity has lowered because the NOX storage amount lowers; and, when it becomes more than this range, the noble metal is covered with the NOX storage material so that the activities have come to lower.<br>
[0023] As for the alkali metals, lithium, sodium, potassium, and cesium can be exemplified.  For the alkaline-earth metals, the group 2Aelements in the periodic table, i.e., barium, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, and the like, can be exemplified.  Moreover, as for the rare-earth elements, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, dysprosium, ytterbium, and so forth, can be exemplified.<br>
[0024] The storage catalyst that makes a feature of the present<br>
invention includes a supporter substrate, and a coating layer that is formed on a surface of the supporter substrate. The supporter substrate is formed of at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A1203, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite, and has a specific surface area of 30 m2/g or more. The specific surface area being less than 30 m2/g is not preferable because a supporting amount of the storage material has become insufficient, and because the SOX storage amount decreases and additionally the NOX storage amount in low-temperature regions decreases as well. It is especially desirable that the specific surface area of the supporter substrate can be 50 m2/g or more.<br>
[0025] Moreover, for a quality of material for the supporter substrate, A1203 or Zr02 is especially preferable among those as mentioned above . y -A12O3 is preferable because the specific surface area is high remarkably; since Zr02 is of high basicity, the storage performance of SOX improves furthermore. Moreover, according to later-described reasons, zeolite can also be a preferable quality of material.<br>
[0026] The coating layer is one which includes a supporting powder that includes at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A1203, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite, a storage material for storing NOX and SOX, storage material which is supported on the supporting powder, and a noble metal that is supported on the supporting powder. As for the supporting powder, according to the same reasons as mentioned above, A1203 or Zr02 is especially preferable; and, according to later-described reasons, zeolite is preferable as well. It is preferable to set a forming amount of the coating layer to 100 g or more per 1-L storage catalyst; and<br>
it is especially desirable to set it to 150 g or more per 1-L storage catalyst. When the forming amount of the coating layer is less, the storage amounts of NOX and SOX have lowered.<br>
[0027] For the storage material for storing NOX and SOX, it is desirable to use at least one member being selected from the group consisting of alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals. Among them, Mg or Ba whose basicity is high and which is good in terms of stability is preferable.<br>
[0028] For example, although the oxide of alkali metal or the oxide of alkaline-earth metal, and the like, has a high ability of storing NOX and SOX, it is on the contrary less likely to release stored NOX and SOX. Consequently, a temperature at which it releases NOX and SOX has become high, and thereby there arises such a drawback that the storage amounts of NOX and SOX saturate in the case where it is employed in regions of from low temperature to intermediate temperature so that the storage of NOX and SOX that is those or more becomes difficult. However, when a storage material is made by supporting an alkali metal or an alkaline-earth metal onto a supporting powder, such as zeolite, by means of ion exchange, the temperature at which stored NOX and SOX are released becomes low, and thereby the repetition of storage and release of NOX and SOX becomes feasible even at an exhaust-gas temperature that falls in regions of from low temperature to intermediate temperature.<br>
[0029] Moreover, one in which an alkali metal or an alkaline-earth metal is added to Zr02 exhibits an especially good storage capacity, compared with that of another storage material. And, when supporting a noble metal, such as Pt, Rh or Pd, and a transition-metal oxide, such as Co304, Ni02, Mn02 or Fe203, onto Zr02 with an alkali metal<br>
or an alkaline-earth metal added, the storage capacity improves furthermore. This is believed to be attributable to the following: an oxidizing activity is demonstrated by means of Pt and Co304, Ni02, Mn02, Fe203, or the like; and then NO or S02 in exhaust gases is oxidized and thereby the storage amounts augment.<br>
[0030] Although it has not been apparent why an alkali metal or an alkaline-earth metal is thus effective, it is believed as follows: an alkali metal or an alkaline-earth metal solves into the lattices of Zr02 so that the alkali metal or the alkaline-earth metal is composited with the Zr02; and thereby the Zr02's surface is reformed so that storage sites are generated anew.<br>
[0031] Storage materials exhibit differing temperatures, at which they store NOX and SOX, depending on their types. Hence, it is preferable as well to jointly use multiple types of storage materials that exhibit different temperatures for showing the maximum storage amounts. For example, when putting a low-temperature type storage material that stores NOX and SOX efficiently at low temperature in place on an upstream side and putting an intermediate-type storage material that stores NOX and SOX efficiently at intermediate temperature-high temperature in place on a downstream side to that, it is possible to store NOX and SOX in wide temperature regions from low-temperature regions to high temperature regions because NOX and SOX are stored gradually from the upstream side whose storage temperature is low. Moreover, since exhaust gases are heated by the heat generation by means of storing NOX and SOX, such an effect is available that the activities of the downstream-side storage material or NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst are demonstrated at an early stage.<br>
 [0032] For example, as for a storage material that exhibits the maximum storage amount at room temperature-100 °C, the following can be exemplified: those in which rare-earth elements, such as Ce, are supportedon zeolite, those in which alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals or transition metals are supported on zeolite, and the like; and, as for a storage material that exhibits the maximum storage amount at 100-200 °C, the following can be exemplified: those in which noble metals are supported on ZrO2, those on which transition metals, such as Co304, are supported, and so forth; and, as for a storage material that exhibits the maximum storage at 300 °C or more, the following can be exemplified: those in which noble metals and alkali metals or alkaline-earth metals are supported on ZrO2, A12O3 or the like, and so on.<br>
[0033] Since zeolite is also referred to as another name, amolecular sieve, it has pores that are equal to the sizes of molecules; and, in addition to being utilized as a storage material, it has been utilized as catalysts for many reactions. Moreover, since it includes cations for neutralizing the negative charges of its major component, Al2O3, and since these cations are readily exchanged with the other cations in aqueous solutions, it has been utilized as a cation exchanger. Therefore, it is possible to support at least one member of metals being selected from the group consisting of alkali metals and alkaline-earth metals on it by means of ion exchange, and it is possible to support the metal on it in an extremely highly-dispersed state.<br>
[0034] And, since a metallic element being supported by means of ion exchange is supported on zeolite in an extremely highly-dispersed manner, it is believed that the activities are high extremely so<br>
that the oxidizing activities for NO and S02 in low-temperature regions improve. Consequently, it is believed that NO and S02 in exhaust gases are oxidized to turn into NOX and SOX on the storage material even in low-temperature regions and then they are stored into the storage material, and eventually NOX and SOX are stored sufficiently even in low-temperature regions.<br>
[0035] Moreover, since HC in exhaust gases are also stored into zeolite, the reactions between the stored HC and NOX can be expected. Therefore, the NOX converting capacity improves furthermore.<br>
[0036] Note that, as for zeolite, it is possible to use zeolites, such as ferrierite, ZSM-5, mordenite and type Y zeolite, and the like. Among them, since ZSM-5 and mordenite are good in terms of the ion-exchanging capacity, it is desirable to select it from these to use.<br>
[0037] And, when putting the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst in place on a downstream side of the storage material in which at least one metallic element being selected from the group consisting of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals and rare-earth elements is supported on zeolite by means of ion exchange, even if NOX that cannot be stored with the storage material fully exist, they are stored into the downstream-side NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst because NO has already been turned into NOX even in low-temperature regions. Therefore, the NOX storing capacity in low-temperature regions improves, and then the NOX converting capacity improves.<br>
[0038] Onto the coating layer, a noble metal is further supported. As for this noblemetal, Pt, Rh, Pd, Ir, or the like, can be exemplified. Among them, Pt whose oxidizing activity is high is especially preferable. Moreover, it is preferable to set a supporting amount<br>
of the noble metal at 0.5-2.0 g per 1-L storage catalyst. When it is less than this, the storage performance of NOX and SOX becomes insufficient; and, when supporting it more than this, the effects saturate and additionally that has become costly.<br>
[0039] A configuration of the supporter substrate in the storage catalyst can be adapted into pellet configurations, foam configurations, straight-flow type honeycomb configurations wall-flow type honeycomb configurations, and the like. Moreover, the coating layer is formed on a surface of the supporter substrate that comes in contact with exhaust gases . In the case of the supporter substrate with a wall-flow honeycomb type configuration, it is preferable to form the coating layer also on the inner surfaces of the pores within the partition walls that demarcate the inlet-side cells and outlet-side cells.<br>
[0040] When manufacturing the supporter substrate of the storage catalyst as a straight-flow type honeycomb configuration, for instance, it can be manufactured by turning a powder, which includes at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A1203, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite, into a slurry whose viscosity is high along with a binder; and then firing it after subjecting it to extrusion molding. And, when forming the coating layer on a surface of the supporter substrate, it is allowable to carry it out as follows: a powder, which includes at least one member being selected from the group consisting of A1203, Ce02, Zr02, Ti02 and zeolite, is turned into a slurry whose viscosity is low relatively along with a binder; it is dried and fired after charging it into the supporter substrate and then suctioning it therefrom subsequently; it is thereafter impregnated with a solution in which a noble-metal compound is<br>
dissolved and with another solution in which a compound that includes a storage-material element includes in sequence; and then it is dried and fired.<br>
[004l] When supporting the storage material onto the coating layer, a solution is used, solution in which a compound, such as nitrate, that includes a storage-material element is dissolved. Since it is sought to make a supporting amount of the storage material great as much as possible, it is desirable to set a concentration of the compound that includes a storage-material element in the solution at the saturated concentration. Moreover, since it is desirable to support it in a great amount in a single process, it is preferable that an amount of absorbed water in a state that the coating layer is formed can be at least 150 g or more per 1-L catalyst, and it is especially desirable that it can be 200 g or more per 1-L catalyst.<br>
[0042] Moreover, in the supporter substrate of the storage catalyst as well, it is desirable that said storage material can be included. By means of this, the storage amounts of N0xand SOX augment furthermore . Although the storage material can be included in the supporter substrate to a certain extent by means of the aforementioned supporting method, it is desirable to mix a storage-material powder, such as MgO or BaO, into a slurry, which is used for the manufacture of the supporter substrate, in advance. When a mixing amount of the storage-material powder in this case becomes great, there might arise such a case that the strength of the supporter substrate has lowered or the specific surface area has become less than 30 m2/g.<br>
[0043] Bytheway, it has been understood that the converting reaction of NOX in the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst includes: a first step of oxidizing NO in exhaust gases in lean atmosphere to turn<br>
it into NOX; a second step of storing the NOX into N0x-storing element; and a third step of reducing NOX, which are released from the N0x-st or ing element, on catalyst in stoichiometric-rich atmosphere . Therefore, in order that the N0x-converting reaction proceeds smoothly, these respective steps should proceed smoothly, respectively.<br>
[0044] However, it is believed that the oxidation reaction of NO is less likely to proceed in low-temperature regions of less than 300 °C, for instance, so that the first step is less likely to proceed therein. Because of that, it is believed that the generation amount of NOX becomes less in low-temperature regions so that the second step and third step have come not to proceed smoothly, either, and thereby the NOX converting capacity in low-temperature regions becomes low.<br>
[0045] Hence, in the exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to the present invention, it is adapted into such a construction that the storage catalyst is put in place on an exhaust-gas-flow upstream side of the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst. The storage material that is included in the storage catalyst is likely to store NOX, and stores NOX even in low-temperature regions . Therefore, since exhaust gases that hardly include NOX are supplied to the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst in low-temperature regions, NOX are hardly discharged. And, when the temperatures of the exhaust gases rise, although the stored NOX are eliminated from the storage material to flow into the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst, the aforementioned first step's reaction proceeds smoothly because the NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst has become the activation temperature already, and thereby NO is converted by means of reduction efficiently. By means of such a mechanism, it is possible to secure<br>
high NOX reduction conversions from low temperature up to high temperature in accordance with the exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0046] Hereinafter, thepresent invention will be explained in detail by means of examples and comparative examples.<br>
(Example No. 1)<br>
[0047] In Fig. 1, an exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to the present example is illustrated. In an exhaust-gas flow passage of an engine 1, a catalytic converter 2 is put in place. In the catalytic converter 2, a storage catalyst 3 is put in place on the upstream side, and an NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst 4 is put in place on the downstream side of the storage catalyst 3. Both of the storage catalyst 3 and NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst 4 are straight-flow-structured honeycomb catalysts.<br>
[0048] The storage catalyst 3 included a straight-flow type honeycomb substrate 30 that was formed of y -A1203, and a coating layer 31 that was formed on its cell wall surfaces. The honeycomb substrate 30 had a volume of 2 L, exhibited 600 cells/in2, and had a specific surface area of 100 m2/g. The coating layer 31 was formed in an amount of 150 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate 30.<br>
[0049] The coating layer 31 was formed by wash coating a slurry that mainly included a y -A1203 powder, and was supported with 2.0-g Pt per 1-L honeycomb substrate 30 and 2.5-mol MgO per 1-L honeycomb substrate 30. First of all, an alumina coating layer was formed by wash coating a slurry that mainly included a y -A1203 powder and then drying and firing it. Next, the alumina coating layer was impregnated with a Pt chemical solution having a predetermined<br>
concentration in a prescribed amount, and was fired to support Pt thereon. Subsequently, it was impregnated with a magnesium nitrate aqueous solution (saturated aqueous solution) in the maximum amount, and was dried and fired to support MgO thereon. An amount of the supported MgO was 100 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate 30.<br>
[ 0050 ] The NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst 4 included a straight-flow type honeycomb substrate 40 that was formed of cordierite, and a coating layer 41 that was formed on its cell wall surfaces. The honeycomb substrate 40 had a volume of 3 L, exhibited 400 cells/in2, and had a specif ic surf ace area of 100 m2/g . Thecoating layer 41 was formed in an amount of 150 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate 40.<br>
[005l] The coating layer 41 included a γ -A1203 powder, and Pt, K and Ba that were supported on the γ -A1203 powder. Pt was supported in an amount of 2 g; K was supported in an amount of 0.1 mol; and Ba was supported in an amount of 0. 1 mol; per 1-L honeycomb substrate 40.<br>
(Example No. 2)<br>
[0052] As a honeycomb substrate of the storage catalyst 3, instead of the γ -A1203 powder, one that was formed of a mixture powder was used, mixture powder in which a γ -A1203 powder and an MgO powder were mixed with a weight ratio of γ -A1203 powder: MgO powder =9:1. The honeycomb substrate had the same configuration as that of Example No. 1, andits specif ic surface area was 100m2/g. Using this honeycomb substrate, the same alumina coating layer as that of Example No. 1 was formed. The alumina coating layer was formed in an amount of 150 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate. When Pt and MgO were supported onto the alumina coating layer in the same manner as Example No.<br>
1 except that the concentration of the magnesium nitrate aqueous solution differed, the supporting amounts of Pt and MgO were the same as those in Example No. 1. Note that, when the supported distribution of MgO was surveyed, it was supported in an amount of 1.0 mol/L on the honeycomb substrate and was supported in an amount of 1.5 mol/L on the coating layer.<br>
[0053] Into the catalytic converter 2, the obtained storage catalyst was put in place on the upstream side, and the same NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst 4 as that of Example No. 1 was put in place on its downstream side, and then they were labeled as an exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to Example No. 2.<br>
(Comparative Example No. 1)<br>
[0054] As a honeycomb substrate of the storage catalyst 3, instead of the γ -AlaOs powder, one that was formed of a cordierite powder was used. The honeycomb substrate had the same configuration as that of Example No. 1, and its specific surface area was 0.1-1 m2/g. Using this honeycomb substrate, the same alumina coating layer as that of Example No. 1 was formed. The alumina coating layer was formed in an amount of 150 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate. And, when Pt and MgO were supported onto the alumina coating layer in the same manner as Example No. 1, the supporting amount of Pt was the same as that in Example No. 1, but the supporting amount of MgO was 1.0 mol/L and it was less than that in Example No. 1.<br>
[0055] Into the catalyticconverter 2, the obtained storage catalyst was put in place on the upstream side, and the same NOX storage-and-reduction catalyst 4 as that of Example No. 1 was put in place on its downstream side, and then they were labeled as an exhaust-gas converting apparatus according to Comparative Example<br>
No. 1.<br>
(Comparative Example No. 2)<br>
[0056] As a honeycomb substrate of the storage catalyst 3, instead of the γ -A1203 powder, one that was formed of a cordierite powder was used. The honeycomb substrate had the same configuration as that of Example No. 1, and its specific surface area was 0.1-1 m2/g. Using this honeycomb substrate, the same alumina coating layer as that of Example No. 1 was formed. The alumina coating layer was formed in an amount of 150 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate. And, when Pt and MgO were supported onto the alumina coating layer in the same manner as Example No. 1, the supporting amount of Pt was the same as that in Example No. 1, but the supporting amount of MgO was 1.25 mol/L and it was less than that in Example No. 1.<br><testing example><br>
[0057] Only the storage catalysts 3, which were used for the exhaust-gas converting apparatuses of the respective examples and respective comparative examples, were fit onto an evaluating apparatus, respectively, and a stationary-lean model gas as set forth in Table 1 was flowed into them. The catalytic bed temperature was set at 150 °C, and the model-gas flow volume was 30 L/min. And, the results of analyzing outlet gases from the catalysts to measure the NOX storage amounts are illustrated in Fig. 2.<br>
[0058]  TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [0059] Moreover, only the storage catalysts 3, which were used for the exhaust-gas converting apparatuses of the respective examples<br>
and respective comparative examples, were fit onto an evaluating apparatus, respectively, and a stationary-lean model gas as set forth in Table 2 was flowed into them. The catalytic bed temperature was set at 400 °C, and the model-gas flow volume was 30 L/min. And, Fig. 3 illustrates the results of measuring stored sulfur amounts when the model gas whose volume as sulfur was equivalent to 90 g per 1-L honeycomb substrate was passed through them. [0060] TABLE 2<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
 [006l] According to Fig. 2andFig. 3, the storage catalysts according to Example No. 1 and Example No. 2 were good in terms of the NOX storage performance in low-temperature regions, and are good in terms of the SOX storage performance as well, and it is apparent that these result from the fact that the supporting amounts of MgO were abundant.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
