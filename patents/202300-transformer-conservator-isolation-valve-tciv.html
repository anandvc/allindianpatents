TRANSFORMER CONSERVATOR ISOLATION VALVE (TCIV)<br>
Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to the field of an isolation valve, more particularly to electrical transformer Conservator Isolation Valve (TCIV) which is used between the conservator and buchholz relay in an electrical transformer for the purpose of isolating oil in the electrical transfoimer conservator mounted on top of the electrical transformer tank, in case of rupture of the electrical transformer tank or bursting of electrical transformer bushing.<br>
Background/Prior art:<br>
When the oil of an electrical transformer becomes contaminated or properties of the oil deteriorate, there is a need to filter the oil. Since the oil is always filtered from the bottom of the electrical transformer and fed again into to the conservator or top filter valve of the electrical transformer tank, oil circulation is blocked whenever filtered oil is fed into the conservator, whose outlet conduit or pipe is fitted with a conventional design preset non return valve. Therefore filtration of oil cannot be done. In the existing or conventional design of preset non return valve (PNRV), isolation of the electrical transformer conservator occurs in case of bursting of electrical transformer tank or rupture of electrical transformer bushing mounted on the electrical transformer tank. However, diving filtration or filling or refilling of electrical transformer oil, the FNRV by virtue of its inherent construction remains closed and prevents flow of oil. It is therefore necessary to obviate the above drawback of the prior art system by another device.<br><br><br>
Object of Investion:<br>
The objective of the present invention is to eliminate die above-said drawbacks associated with prior valves.<br>
The main objective of this invention is to provide a TCTV to be operated in dual mode for isolating the electrical transfonner conservator during abnormal flow of oil due to rupture of electrical transformer tank or nursling OT electrical transformer bushing or while draining oll from the electrical transformer tank and also not to isolate the electrical transformer conservator during normal flow of oil during filtration or filling or refilling.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
The disadvantages associated win the prior art are overcome by designing the Transformer Conservator Isolation Valve (TCTV) which is operated in dual mode for isolating the electrical transformer conservator during abnormal flow of oil due to rupture of electrical transformer tank or bursting of electrical transformer bushing or while draining oil from the electrical transformer tank and also not to isolate the electrical trasformer conservator during normal flow of oil during filtration or filling or refilling.<br>
