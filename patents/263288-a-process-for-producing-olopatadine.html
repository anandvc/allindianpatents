catalytic amount of water to an inert solvent such as<br>
toluene and chlorobenzene, and successively add a<br>
vinylidene compound represented by Formula (4) thereto at<br>
a temperature of about 15 to 60°C.<br>
In either of the above esterification methods, after<br>

method as required, thereby obtaining the target substance.<br>
A carboxylic acid represented by Formula (1) used to<br>
produce the tertiary alkyl ester represented by Formula<br>
(2) of the invention can be prepared, for example, through<br>
the following [Step 1] to [Step 5] . This preparation<br>
method gives the carboxylic acid represented by Formula<br><br>
(1) at high yield, and the reactions can be performed at<br>
temperatures of less than 140°C. Accordingly, steam<br>
heating can be easily employed, which provides convenience.<br>
[Step 1] Step of a reaction of phthalide with thionyl<br>
chloride to produce 2-chloromethylbenzoyl chloride:<br>
In this step, phthalide is dissolved in an inert<br>
solvent such as xylene, and thionyl chloride is added<br>
thereto while heating in the presence of a catalyst such<br>
as BF3-etherate complex. The amount of the solvent is<br>
preferably 100 to 1000 parts by weight per 100 parts by<br>
weight of the phthalide. The amount of the catalyst is<br>
preferably about 0.01 to 0.2 mol per 1 mol of the<br>
phthalide.<br>
The reaction mixture preferably contains a<br>
quarternary ammonium salt such as benzyltriethylammonium<br>
chloride for the purpose of promoting the reaction. The<br>
content thereof is preferably about 0.01 to 0.2 mol per 1<br>
mol of the phthalide.<br>
The amount of the thionyl chloride is preferably<br>
about 1 to 2 mol per 1 mol of the phthalide. The solution<br>
temperature upon addition of the thionyl chloride to a<br>
phthalide solution is preferably 80 to 130°C. Dropwise<br>
addition of thionyl chloride is preferably performed over<br>
about 0.5 to 2 hours per molar quantity. After the<br>
dropwise addition of the thionyl chloride, in order to<br><br>
further ensure the reaction, the mixture is preferably<br>
stirred at temperature of about 120 to 135°C for about 1<br>
to 5 hours.<br>
After the reaction is completed, excessive thionyl<br>
chloride and solvent are removed. Preferably, the thionyl<br>
chloride is distilled off at normal pressure, and the<br>
solvent is then distilled off under reduced pressure. As<br>
a result, 2-chloromethylbenzoyl chloride is obtained as a<br>
residue.<br>
[Step 2] Step of a reaction of 2-chloromethylbenzoyl<br>
chloride with methanol to produce methyl 2-<br>
chloromethylbenzoate represented by Formula (5):<br><br>
This step may be as follows, for example. Methanol<br>
is added dropwise to 2-chloramethylbenzoyl chloride taking<br>
about 0.5 to 2 hours per 1 mol of methanol, and stirred at<br>
30 to 60°C for about 0.5 to 1 hour. It is also possible<br>
to add 2-chloromethylbenzoyl chloride dropwise to a mixed<br>
solution of methanol and toluene. The amount of the<br>
methanol is preferably 1 to 3 mol per 1 mol of the 2-<br>
chloromethylbenzoyl chloride.<br>
The reaction mixture obtained by the reaction<br>
described above contains hydrochloric acid produced during<br>
the reaction, and thus is preferably neutralized with<br><br>
alkali. For example, the above reaction mixture may be<br>
added dropwise at 0 to 50°C to an aqueous solution having<br>
dissolved therein a designated amount of potassium<br>
carbonate. After neutralization, washing is performed<br>
with brine having a concentration of about 15 to 35 wt%,<br>
and the organic layer is concentrated under reduced<br>
pressure, thereby giving methyl 2-chloromethylbenzoate<br>
represented by Formula (5) as a residue.<br>
[Step 3] Step of a reaction of methyl 2-<br>
chloromethylbenzoate with methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate<br>
represented by Formula (6):<br><br>
to produce methyl 2-(4-methoxycarbonylmethylphenoxymethyl)<br>
benzoate represented by Formula (7):<br><br>
This step may be as follows, for example. A mixture<br>
of methyl 2-chloromethylbenzoate, potassium carbonate and<br>
a solvent such as dimethylacetamide is heated to a<br>
temperature of about 50 to 120°C, a designated amount of<br>
methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate is added thereto, and the<br>
mixture is stirred at the same temperature for about 1 to<br>
12 hours. At that time, the amounts of the methyl 2-<br><br>
chloromethylbenzoate and the methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate<br>
are preferably approximately stoichiometric amounts<br>
(equimolar amounts), and the methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate<br>
is preferably added dropwise over about 0.5 to 2 hours per<br>
0.2 molar quantity. The amount of the potassium carbonate<br>
is preferably about 0.5 to 1.5 mol per 1 mol of the methyl<br>
2-chloromethylbenzoate. The preferable amount of the<br>
solvent such as dimethylacetamide is about 100 to 500<br>
parts by weight per 100 parts by weight of the methyl 4-<br>
hydroxyphenylacetate.<br>
After the reaction, the target substance may be<br>
isolated by a known method. For example, the reaction<br>
mixture is poured into water, an organic solvent such as<br>
toluene is added thereto to separate the organic layer,<br>
which is then washed with water. The organic solvent is<br>
distilled off to give methyl., 2-(4-<br>
methoxycarbonylmethylphenoxymethyl)benzoate represented by<br>
Formula (7).<br>
Methyl 4-hydroxyphenylacetate can be prepared by<br>
allowing 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid to react directly with<br>
methanol in the presence of an acid catalyst such as<br>
sulfuric acid.<br>
[Step 4] Step of hydrolyzing methyl 2-(4-<br>
methoxycarbonylmethylphenoxymethyl)benzoate to produce 2-<br>
(4-carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid represented by<br><br>
Formula (8) :<br><br>
Hydrolysis in this step may be performed in<br>
accordance with a known ester hydrolysis method that<br>
performs hydrolysis with an acid or an alkali.<br>
[Step 5] Step of treating 2-(4-<br>
carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid with<br>
trifluoroacetic anhydride or a halogenating agent and<br>
cyclizing with a Lewis acid catalyst to produce a<br>
carboxylic acid represented by Formula (1):<br>
This step is usually performed in a solvent, and an<br>
inert solvent such as dichlorobenzene and chlorobenzene is<br>
used. The solvent is usually used in an amount of about<br>
0.5 to 2 L per 1 mol of the 2-(4-<br>
carboxymethylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid. The temperature<br>
treating the 2-(4-carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid<br>
with the trifluoroacetic anhydide or the halogenating<br>
agent is preferably 10 to 100°C.<br>
The amount of the trifluoroacetic anhydride is<br>
preferably about 2 to 2.5 mol per 1 mol of the 2-(4-<br>
carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid.<br>
In the treatment of the 2-(4-<br>
carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid with the<br>
halogenating agent, the halogenating agent reacts with the<br><br>
2-(4-carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid in an amount<br>
of 2 to 2.5 mol per 1 mol of the 2-(4-<br>
carboxymethylphenoxymethyl)benzoic acid to produce an acid<br>
halide (carboxylic dihalide) , and then cyclized with a<br>
Lewis acid catalyst such as boron trifluoride, aluminum<br>
chloride or the like. Thionyl chloride or the like is<br>
preferably used for the halogenating agent.<br>
The amount of the Lewis acid is preferably about<br>
0.05 to 0.2 mol per 1 mol of the 2-(4-<br>
carboxymethylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid. The temperature<br>
for the cyclization reaction is preferably -20°C to +30°C.<br>
The tertiary alkyl ester represented by Formula (2)<br>
of the invention can be converted to olopatadine after a<br>
reaction with 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride, and<br>
the tertiary alkyl ester is useful as an intermediate of<br>
olopatadine useful as a medicament. That is, after the<br>
tertiary alkyl ester represented by Formula (2) reacts<br>
with the 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride,<br>
dehydration reaction and de-esterification are performed,<br>
whereby olopatadine can be produced. Hereinafter,<br>
explanation is given with reference to an example where t-<br>
butyl ester is used as a tertiary alkyl ester.<br>
First,	t-butyl	11-hydroxy-11-(3'-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-<br>
acetate represented by Formula (9):<br><br><br>
is produced by a reaction of t-butyl ester represented by<br>
Formula (3) with 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride.<br>
The 3-dimethylaminopropylmagnesium chloride used<br>
herein can be produced from, for example, 3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl chloride hydrochloride and magnesium<br>
in accordance with a conventional method producing a<br>
Grignard reagent. The amount of the 3-dimethylaminopropyl<br>
chloride is preferably about 1 to 2 mol per 1 mol of the<br>
t-butyl ester represented by Formula (3). The 3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl chloride is preferably used as a<br>
solution dissolved in a suitable solvent, such as a mixed<br>
solvent of toluene and tetrahydrofuran, to a concentration<br>
of about 10 to 40%, and is preferably slowly added<br>
dropwise to a solution of the t-butyl ester represented by<br>
Formula (3) dissolved in an inert solvent such as<br>
tetrahydrofuran. The temperature of the solution is<br>
preferably about 10 to 30°C at the dropwise addition.<br>
After the reaction is completed, t-butyl 11-hydroxy-<br>
11-(3' -dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-<br>
2-acetate can be obtained from the reaction mixture by<br>
conventional procedures such as extraction, phase<br>
separation, washing, drying and concentration.<br><br>
Next, the above-obtained t-butyl 11-hydroxy-11-(3'-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-<br>
acetate is dehydrated and de-esterified. The dehydration<br>
reaction and de-esterification may be performed as follows,<br>
for example.<br>
Hydrochloric acid having a concentration of about 1<br>
to 35% is added to the t-butyl 11-hydroxy-11-(3'-<br>
'dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-dihydrodibenz[b,e]oxepin-2-<br>
acetate in an amount of about 1 to 5 mol per 1 mol of the<br>
t-butyl 11-hydroxy-11-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-6,11-<br>
dihydrodibenz [b, e] oxepin-2-acetate, and stirred at<br>
temperature of about 20 to 100°C for about 0.5 to 10 hours.<br>
Examples<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
in further detail with reference to the Examples; however,<br>
the invention is not limited to these Examples.<br>
