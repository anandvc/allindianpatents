SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR COLLISION-FREE TRANSMISSION<br>
SCHEDULING USING NEIGHBORHOOD INFORMATION AND<br>
ADVERTISED TRANSMISSION TIMES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to the scheduling of transmissions without collisions in ad hoc networks in which routers can move and have both hosts and networks attached to them.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Many medium-access control (MAC) protocols have been developed for wireless networks. The carrier-sense multiple access (CSMA) protocol was the first to be used in multihop packet-radio networks. A limitation of CSMA in multihop networks is that sources hidden from one another cannot detect their transmissions, which degrades CSMA's performance to that of the pure ALOHA protocol. Many MAC protocols have been proposed and implemented to solve the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA. The throughput of CSMA protocols is very good, as long as the multiple transmitters within range of the same receivers can sense one another's transmissions. Unfortunately, "hidden terminal" problems degrade the performance of CSMA substantially, because carrier sensing cannot prevent collisions in that case.<br>
The busy tone multiple access (BTMA) protocol (F. A. Tobagi and L. Kleinrock, "Packet switching in radio channels: Part II- the hidden terminal problem in carrier sense multiple-access modes and the busy-tone solution," IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. COM-23, no. 12, pp. 1417—1433,1975.) was the first proposal to combat the hidden-terminal problems of CSMA. BTMA is designed for station-based networks and divides the channel into a message channel and the busy-tone channel. The base station transmits a busy-tone signal on the busy-tone channel as long as it senses carrier on the data channel. Because the base station is in line of sight of all terminals, each terminal can sense the busy-tone channel to determine the state of the data channel. The limitations of BTMA are the use of a separate channel to convey the state of the data channel, the need for the receiver to transmit the busy<br>
time that stations must wait listening to the channel once they have packets to send. The method disclosed does not work in networks with hidden terminals.<br><br>
MACA (P. Kara, "MACH - a new channel access method for packet radio," in ARRL/CRRL Amateur Radio 9th Computer Networking Conference, pp. 134-40, ARRL, 1990) includes a technique that amounts to SRMA running over a single channel in which a request-to-send (RTS) packet is sent without carrier sensing. There is no description of how to support packet trains.<br>
U.S. Pat. No.5,231,634 assigned to Proxim, Inc. discloses a method that also applies SRMA's basic approach over a single channel. The RTS specifies the length of the impending data packet.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,502,724 assigned to International Business Machines Corporation discloses a method that extends the collision avoidance handshake to allow for multiple data packets to flow among a pair of communicating stations. A station that intends to establish a connection with a second station senses the channel. If the channel is idle, it sends a connection request (CR) packet to the intended receiver station. The CR specifies the number of data packets that the connection includes. The intended receiver sends a connection confirm (CC) packet to the sending station; the CC also specifies the number of packet in the connection. After the exchange of correct CR and CC packets the sending station may send one or multiple data packets and the receiving station may send an acknowledgment packet specifying which data packets were received correctly. To end the connection, the sending station sends a disconnect request (DR) and the receiving station issues a disconnect confirm (DC). Stations that receive a CR packet back off for an amount of time that is long enough for the advertised number of data packets to be sent to the receiver. After receiving a CR or CC, a station can attempt to access the channel when a timer proportional to the number of packets to be sent in the connection expire, or when it receives a DR or DC packet. The limitation with the method disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,502,724 is that the method cannot ensure collision-fee transmissions of data packets, even with the transmission of CC packets by the receiver. The need for feedback from the receiver to its neighbors on a packet-by-packet basis was demonstrated by Fullmer and Garcia-Luna-Aceves (C. L. Fullmer and J J. Garcia Luna-Aceves, "Solutions to Hidden Terminal Problems in Wireless Networks", Proc. ACM SIGCOMM 97, Cannes, France, September 14-18, 1997). Because the CC packet sent by the receiver may collide with another packet<br><br>
tone while detecting carrier in the data channel, and the difficulty of detecting the busy-tone signal in a narrow-band channel.<br>
A receiver initiated busy-tone multiple access protocol for packet-radio networks has also been proposed (C. Wu and V. 0. K. Li, "Receiver-initiated busy-tone multiple access in packet radio networks," ACM SIGCOMM 87 Workshop: Frontiers in Computer Communications Technology, Stowe, VT, USA, 11-13 Aug. 1987). In this scheme, the sender transmits a request-to-send (RTS) to the receiver, before sending a data packet. When the receiver obtains a correct RTS, it transmits a busy tone in a separate channel to alert other sources that they should back off. The correct source is always notified that it can proceed with transmission of the data packet. The limitations of this scheme are that it still requires a separate busy-tone channel and full-duplex operation at the receiver.<br>
Several protocols have been proposed based on different types of "collision-avoidance " handshakes done with small control packets and meant to avoid data collisions when sources of data packets cannot hear one another. The collision-avoidance approach in the prior art follows the basic philosophy first introduced by Tobagi and Kleinrock in the Split-Channel Reservation Multiple Access (SRMA) protocol (F. A. Tobagi and L. Kleinrock, "Packet switching in radio channels: Part III - polling and (dynamic) split-channel reservation multiple access," IEEE Trans. Commun., vol. COM-24, no. 8, pp. 832-845,1976). In SRMA, and most subsequent collision-avoidance protocols, a sender node sends a request-to-send (RTS) packet to the intended receiver, either sensing the channel before sending the RTS or not sensing the channel before the RTS transmission. A receiver that hears a clean RTS responds with a clear-to-send (CTS), and the sender can send a data packet after hearing a clean CTS.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,319,641 assigned to Echelon Systems Corp. discloses a method to improve CSMA p-persistent protocols by introducing a random waiting time that stations must wait listening to the channel once they have packets to send. The method disclosed does not work in networks with hidden terminals.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,661,902 assigned to Apple Computer, Inc. discloses a method that amounts to an implementation of SRMA over a single channel in which stations use carrier sensing before sending RTSs.<br><br>
at a neighbor of a receiver, the CC packet does not provide sufficient feedback to hidden nodes; furthermore, the need for feedback packets to be longer than request packets was also demonstrated by Fullmer and Garcia-Luna-Aceves (C. L. Fullmer and J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "Floor Acquisition Multiple Access (FAMA) for Packet-Radio Networks," Proc. ACM SIGCOMM 95, Cambridge, MA, Aug. 28-Sept. 1,1995). In addition, even though the disclosed method makes reference to broadcast packets sent to all the neighbors of a station, it provides no provisions to ensure that broadcast or multicast packets are received without interference by all the neighbors of a sending station.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,721,725 assigned to Xerox Corp. discloses a method similar to SRMA, and describes it to be an improvement over MACH. The method disclosed extends MACH by specifying in the RTS packets the desired data rate for data packets and allowing sender and receiver to negotiate the transmission data rate. This method fails to guarantee collision free transmissions in networks with hidden terminals because no provisions are made on the length of the CTS being longer than the length of any RTS to ensure that collisions of RTSs and CTSs are detected by hidden stations.<br>
DFWMAC IEEE802.11 (K.C. Chen, "Medium Access Control of Wireless LANs for Mobile Computing," IEEE Network, vol. 8, no. 5, pp. 50-63, 1994), FAMA-NCS (C. L. Fullmer and J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "Solutions to Hidden Terminal Problems in Wireless Networks", Proc. ACM SIGCOMM 97, Cannes, France, September 14-18,1997), and RIMA (J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves and A. Tzamaloukas, "Reversing the Collision Avoidance Handshake in Wireless networks," Proc. ACM/IEEE Mobicom 99, August 1999) are three recent additional examples of collision-avoidance protocols. IEEE 802.11 is a method very similar to SRMA with carrier sensing for the transmission of RTSs. The objective of FAMA-NCS is for a station that has data to send to acquire control of the channel in the vicinity of the receiver (which we call "the floor") before sending any data packet, and to ensure that no data packet collides with any other packet at the receiver. FAMA-NCS makes the length of CTSs much longer than the length of RTSs in order to detect the collision of RTSs with CTSs, which cannot be enforced in prior collision-avoidance protocols. RIMA includes a family of protocols that<br><br>
reverse the collision-avoidance handshake method first introduced in SRMA and makes the receiver polls the sender of data. Several other medium access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed for either single-channel wireless networks or wireline local area networks that are based on similar RTS-CTS exchanges, or based on RTSs followed by pauses. However, despite the popularity gained by collision-avoidance protocols and systems based on such protocols over the past few years, two key performance limitations of all collision-avoidance MAC protocols are that: (a) they cannot provide channel-access delay guarantees, which represents a big problem for real-time applications; and (b) they lack explicit support of collision-free multicasting or broadcasting, which implies that either a node must transmit the same multicast packet multiple times, once to each multicast-group neighbor, or packets are sent with likelihood of reception as low as the ALOHA protocol. In addition, collision-avoidance protocols require carrier sensing, which is not technically or economically feasible to implement correctly in direct sequence spread spectrum radios with very high chip rates.<br>
To circumvent hidden-terminal interference problems, unique codes (spreading codes or frequency-hopping sequences) can be assigned to receivers or senders.<br>
An example of this approach was the Metricom network. However, receiver oriented code assignment (ROCA) and transmitter oriented code assignment (TOCA) require either pre-configuring radios with the node to code mappings, or finding the codes being used by neighboring transmitters or receivers. Furthermore, efficient broadcasting is not guaranteed simply by establishing a TOCA approach; because all the neighbors of a transmitter must agree to listen to the transmitter at the same time to minimize the number of transmissions.<br>
Another approach to channel access used in multihop wireless networks includes establishing transmission schedules, i.e., allocating stations to different times and data channels (e.g., frequencies, spreading codes, or their combination) in a way that no collisions occur. Transmission scheduling can be static or dynamic; MAC protocols based on dynamic transmission scheduling explore the spatial reuse of the radio channel and thus have much higher channel utilization than such fixed scheduling approaches as TDM A and FDMA.<br><br>
In TDMA protocols, time is divided into frames comprising time slots. Time slots are allocated to specific nodes or a centralized station is used to allocate the time slots. The limitations of TDMA stem from the fixed assignment of time slots to nodes, which are slow to adapt to network changes and makes inefficient use of the channel if nodes are bursty sources of traffic, and the use of centralized assignments.<br>
There are many approaches in the prior art based on dynamic TDMA methods in which stations use ALOHA, slotted ALOHA or other contention protocols in an uplink to request time slots from a base station. An example of this approach is the system disclosed in U.S. Pat. 5,638371 assigned to NEC USA, Inc. The present invention eliminates the need for a base station to make slot assignments.<br>
A number of protocols have been proposed in the recent past to provide dynamic time-slot allocation without requiring central base stations. These protocols can be classified as topology-independent and topology-dependent time scheduling protocols.<br>
Shepard (T. Shepard, "A Channel Access Scheme for Large Dense Packet Radio Networks," Proc. SIGCOMM 96,1996; T. Shepaid, "Scalable, Self-Configuring Packet Radio Network Having Decentralized Channel Management Providing Collision-Free Packet Transfer," US Patent 5,682382, October 28,1997), Chlamtac et al (I. Chlamtac et al, Time-Spread Multiple-Access (TSMA) Protocols for Multihop Mobile Radio Networks," IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, Vol. 5, no. 6, Dec. 1997), and Ju and Li (Ji-Her Ju, Victor O.K. Li, "An Optimal Topology-Transparent Scheduling Method in Multihop Packet Radio Networks," IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking, Vol. 6, no. 3, June 1998) have proposed topology-independent time-scheduling protocols. In these protocols, nodes are pie-assigned (by means of their nodal IDs, for example) or adopt a transmission schedule that they publish, and such a schedule specifies the times when a node transmits and receives. The protocols guarantee or provide a high likelihood that at least one transmission time in a node's schedule does not conflict with any node one or two hops away. In the Chlamtac and Ju approaches, nodes are unable to determine which transmissions will succeed, complicating the job of higher layer (e.g.,<br>
actual network conditions (if the network is larger or more dense than expected). Shepard's approach avoids collisions by assuming nodes are synchronized with their<br><br>
link-layer) protocols. These approaches also require values for the total number of nodes in the network and maximum number of neighbors for each node, as input parameters to the algorithm, thus making them design for the worst case conditions (and thus, inefficient if the network is not as dense as expected), or being sensitive to actual network conditions (if the network is larger or more dense than expected). Shepard's approach avoids collisions by assuming nodes are synchronized with their neighbors, have knowledge of their neighbors' schedules, and are able to receive from multiple transmitting neighbors simultaneously. This final assumption requires fairly sophisticated radio hardware.<br>
Zhu and Corson (C. Zhu, M.S. Corson," A Five-Phase Reservation Protocol (FPRP) for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks," Proc. IEEE INFOCOM 98) and Tang and Garcia-Luna Aceves (Z. Tang and J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "A Protocol for Topology-Dependent Transmission Scheduling," Proc. IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference 1999 (WCNC 99), New Orleans, Louisiana, September 21-24,1999; Z. Tang and J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "Hop-Reservation Multiple Access (HRMA) for Multichannel Packet Radio Networks", Proc. IEEE IC3N 98: Seventh International Conference on Computer Communications and Networks, Lafayette, Louisiana, October 12-15,1998) have developed topology-dependent scheduling protocols, such that a node acquires a transmission schedule that allows the node to transmit without interfering with nodes one and two hops away from itself, and such that channel reuse is increased as the number of neighbors per node decreases. These protocols require nodes to contend in order to reserve collision-free time slots, and the contention is done on each mini-slot. Furthermore, they rely on dividing each slot into several mini-slots. All this limits the minimum duration that slots may have. The present invention does not require slots to be subdivided, and does not require nodes to reply to neighbors in less than a frame time.<br>
Several approaches have been proposed that are based on TDMA and require an initial, topology-independent schedule, followed by communication among the network nodes to negotiate a final schedule. Chlamtac (I. Chlamtac, "Fair Algorithms for Maximal Link Activation in Multihop Radio Networks," IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. COM-35, no, 7, July, 1987) proposed an<br><br>
algorithm based on a repeating link schedule that can adapt \o traffic demands after some number of iterations of the algorithm. The algorithm starts with a "single-slot-per-link" schedule, such as provided by assigning each node a transmission slot according to its node ID. At each iteration, schedule information and a scheduling "token" are routed up and down a routing tree (established by means of pre-existing algorithms), to assign additional slots to nodes or links according to their degree of unmet traffic demands. Ephremides and Truong (A. Ephremides, T. Tiuong, "Scheduling Broadcasts in Multihop Radio Networks," IEEE Transactions on Communications, Vol. COM-38, No. 4, April, 1990) proposed a similar algorithm in which each node is initially assigned a slot corresponding to its node ID, and then each node uses their assignment to pass "skeleton" schedules to their neighbors. During the next two frames (two iterations of communicating schedules), and in accordance with fixed node priorities, nodes are able to grab available slots until all available slots are taken (i.e., no more slots can be assigned without causing collisions). Because of the need for schedules that are fixed, requiring a few iterations to converge, and of scheduling-frame size equal to the maximum size of the network, these approaches have limited scalability and robustness to mobility or other dynamics. The approach proposed by Young (C. D. Young, "USAP: A Unifying Dynamic Distributed Multichannel TDMA Slot Assignment Protocol," Proc. IEEE MILCOM 96 OCTOBER 1996) also requires initial assignment of one slot per node, and then negotiation of scheduling packets for assignment of the other slots. However, the initially assigned slot is limited to the first slot in each "frame." Thus, each node's assigned slot occurs every N frames, where N is the maximum network size. Because of this, the approach does not scale. Also, the approach is relatively slow in adapting to dynamic traffic conditions, because a node needs to wait up to N frames before a proposed schedule addition is confirmed by a neighbor.<br>
The majority of the limitations described above for the MAC protocols in the prior art are eliminated with the Robust Environmentally Adaptive Link/MAC (REALM) protocol (D. Beyer, J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, and C. Fullmer, "Adpative Communication Protocol for Wireless Networks," US Patent Application, 10 February 1999, Docket No. 003867K&gt;01) in combination with the Neighborhood<br><br>
Established Transmission Scheduling (NETS) protocol (J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, D. Beyer and C. Fullmer, "A Protocol for Neighborhood Established Transmission Scheduling," Docket No. 003867.P005,15 October 1999).<br>
REALM is a MAC protocol that achieves collision avoidance without the need for handshakes between senders and receivers. REALM assumes a synchronous network organized into time frames divided into slots. The amount of synchronization assumed in REALM is the same type of synchronization required in any network operating with frequency hopping radios, such as those designed to operate in ISM bands and commercially available today. A node running REALM must know the identities of its one-hop and two-hop neighbors and the present time in the network (e.g., the number of the current frame). Based on this information, and auxiliary information, each node evaluates a function (e.g., a hash function) that specifies deterministically which node should transmit in which time slot of a frame. REALM achieves fairness by changing in each frame the priority with which a given node can transmit in a time slot of the frame. Once all the nodes in the two-hop neighborhood of a node have consistent information regarding their neighborhood, collisions are avoided because all the nodes use the same deterministic algorithm to select a winner for a given time slot.<br>
Bao and Garcia-Luna-Aceves (L. Bao and J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "A New Approach to Channel Access Scheduling for Ad Hoc Networks," Proc. ACM MobiCom 2001 -Seventh Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and networking, July 16-21,2001, Rome, Italy; L. Bao and J J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, "Channel Access Scheduling in Ad Hoc Networks with Unidirectional Links," Proc. ACM DialM 2001-Fifth International Workshop on Discrete Algorithms and Methods for Mobile Computing and Communications, July 21,2001 Rome, Italy; L. Bao and J J. GarciaLuna-Aceves, "A New Collision-Free Medium Access Control Protocol" Proc. IEEE MILCOM 2000, Los Angeles, California, October 22-25,2000.) have proposed channel access algorithms that achieve collision avoidance without the need for a specific handshake between sender and receiver in a way similar to REALM. These algorithms require each node to have the identifiers of all the nodes within two hops, and assign a transmission<br>
mo and Uarcia-Luna-Aceves is that these approaches are based on all the nodes in a twohop neighborhood competing for transmission in each time slot of a frame<br><br>
priority to a node during a given time slot based on this neighbor information. An unspecified algorithm is assumed to disseminate neighbor information.<br>
A limitation of u$ing REALM by itself or the algorithms proposed by Bao and Garcia-Luna-Aceves is that these approaches are based on all the nodes in a twohop neighborhood competing for transmission in each time slot of a frame designated for such type of collision-free access. A more efficient use of he channel can be achieved if those nodes that were able to transmit during a prior frame notify their neighborhoods that they will not be competing for transmission slots for a period of time, which effectively reduces competition among nodes and the delay experienced by a given node in accessing the channel.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention is directed at addressing the above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems, and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.<br>
The present invention includes a medium access control (MAC) protocol for the collision-free transmission of packets into a channel, such that nodes are assigned time slots for collision-free transmission based on information they acquire regarding the constituency of their local neighborhoods and the advertisements of the time slots when nodes in local neighborhoods will attempt to transmit again.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, the scheduling procedure may utilize an age of the network together with unique identifiers associated with the nodes.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the candidate transmission times for each node are determined using a list of the subsequent transmission times advertised by other nodes. The node discards the advertised transmission times from the list of potential transmission times, and computes its candidate transmission times using a function that provides a varying (pseudorandom) distribution of outputs for a varying sample of inputs. This function may be a hash function, an encryption function, or a table-lookup function. The<br><br>
computation of candidate transmission times uses the identifiers of those nodes for which no advertised transmission time has been obtained.<br>

Referring to the drawings, like numbers indicate like parts throughout the views. Additionally, a reference to the singular includes a reference to the plural unless otherwise stated or is inconsistent with the disclosure herein.<br>
A system and method for the scheduling of transmissions in ad hoc networks will now be described. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention.

Briefly described, the present invention is directed at providing a medium access control (MAC) protocol for the collision-free transmission of packets into a channel, such that nodes are assigned time slots for collision-free transmission based on information they acquire regarding the constituency of their local neighborhoods and the advertisements of the time slots when nodes in local neighborhoods will attempt to transmit again.<br>
I. Definitions, Basic Service and Assumptions<br>
For purposes of the description, the radios used in the network are half-duplex and tune to one channel at a time, although the radios can switch to any of the available channels. Like previous MAC protocols based on transmission scheduling, the present invention assumes that time is slotted and that slots are grouped into frames. Frames are further organized into epochs. Note, however, that even protocols based on collision avoidance (e.g., IEEE 802,11) may require that time be slotted and organized into frames, depending on the radios used in the network. Such is the case for frequency hopping radios, because all radios must agree on the start times of frequency hops and the length of the hopping sequence.<br>
The present invention focuses on the allocation of time slots for broadcast transmissions over a common channel, so that nodes can transmit control packets used for establishing transmission schedules over multiple data channels, or<br><br>
data packets. The present invention assumes bi-directional physical links among neighboring nodes; this is also true of collision-avoidance MAC protocols.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, time slots are identified using a unique identifier specifying the position of the time slot in a frame and the position of a frame in an epoch. An epoch can be identified using the current time agreed upon among nodes by means of a time synchronization algorithm. In the description of the present invention, the term slot ID denotes the identifier of a time slot based on the "network age" of the network. Each epoch has a fixed number of frames and each frame has a fixed number of time slots.<br>
The nodes executing the method described in the present invention are referred to as Internet Radios (IR). In the description of the invention, "node" and "Internet Radio" are used interchangeably.<br>
In an embodiment of this invention, each neighbor of a node is identified by the node using a transmitter-assigned local link identifier, which we denote by XLID- In another embodiment of this invention, nodes can be identified by their MAC addresses. In the description of the present invention presented herein, we simply use the term node identifier to denote either XLIDs or MAC addresses of nodes. ATOM works correctly with both types of node identifiers. Each node can have up to a maximum of active one-hop neighbors. Each active one-hop neighbor is assigned a node identifier; and it is assumed that a node assigns consecutive node identifiers to active neighbors. The assignment of a node identifier to a neighbor is accomplished by means of a method that is outside the scope of the present invention.<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates an exemplary Ad hoc network in which the invention may operate, in accordance with aspects of the invention. The ad hoc network consists of a number of subnetworks 20,30,40, and 50, which provide an extension of the Internet through a number of IRs (100,110,120,130,140,150, 160,170, and 180). Each IR, 100-180, is a wireless router with an IP address and a MAC address. Ad hoc network 20 attaches to the Internet 900 via access point IR 110. IR 110 is coupled to an Internet router 200 through local area network 40.<br><br>
After a finite amount of time, the IRs (100-180) in ad hoc network 20 have the same list of IRs that are present in the network. In other words, the IRs are aware of its neighbors.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, each IR learns the unique node IDs of the IRs within a predetermined number of hops away from it, which constitute its neighborhood. For example, IRs may leam of its neighbors that are one, two, three, or more hops away from it. According to one embodiment of the invention, an IR learns about the presence of its direct (1-hop) neighbors by means of a neighbor discovery and management protocol, possibly in combination with control packets. Two-hop neighbors and nodes beyond two hops from the node are learned by means of control packets.<br>
Different protocols may be used for the communication of routing information throughout the ad hoc network.<br>
II. Information Exchanged and Maintained<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates an exemplary frame of time slots allocated for IRs A-E, in accordance with aspects of the invention. As illustrated, time slots 220 (sO-sl 1) are shown within frame 230. An IR is allocated to each time slot (See 220). For illustration purposes, IRs A-F have been placed in order under slots sO-sl 1. IRs A-F are assigned a time slot such that collisions are avoided. The IRs in the network are synchronized and agree on the periods, referred to as "frames," within which packets (e.g., control packets) will be scheduled. Each Frame is associated with a "Network Age" (NetAge) which changes from frame to frame, and is known throughout the network. For example, the network may be synchronized by epochs, frames, and slots, with a constant integer number (S) of slots per frame, and a constant integer number (F) of frames per epoch. Within each epoch, frames are numbered consecutively from 1 to F (the "Frame Number"). Epochs are also numbered consecutively, eventually wrapping back to Epoch Number 1 after E epochs. The above Network Age can either be the Frame Number concatenated with the epoch number, or simply just the Frame Number if die number of frames in an epoch is sufficiently large.<br><br>
For the purposes of description, the control packets exchanged among nodes in the present invention are referred to as "network configuration packets."<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, each node maintains<br>
a physical neighborhood list with each entry containing the following fields:<br>
Address	32-bit MAC address<br>
Distance        Indicates distance in hops of this neighbor from the present node. If a packet has been successfully received from this neighbor recently (defined farther below), it is considered to be 1 hop away.<br>
Node Identifier	Number (or set of numbers) used to identify<br>
this node in a more efficient way in Network configuration packets.<br>
For direct (1-hop) neighbors:<br>
Nbr ID - Number indicating the neighbor number which this node has assigned to this neighbor. For indirect, 2-hop neighbors:<br>
Rep ID - Number indicating the neighbor that is reporting this 2-hop neighbor.<br>
Rep Nbr ID    The Nbr ID used by the direct (reporting) neighbor to identify this 2-hop neighbor node. For indirect, 3-hop neighbors (if maintained):<br>
Rep ID	Number indicating the neighbor that is<br>
reporting this 3-hop neighbor.<br>
Rep Rep ID	The Nbr ID used by the reporting<br>
neighbor to identify its reporting neighbor for this 3-hop neighbor node.<br>
Rep Rep Nbr ID        The Nbr ID used by the direct neighbor to identify this 3-hop neighbor.<br>
Xmt Holdoff Time    The minimum number of frames between Network configuration packet transmissions by this node. A node can increase this holdoff time, and start reporting the increased number. To decrease its holdoff time, it must first advertise the new holdoff time for a given number of frames while using the old holdoff time before switching to the decreased time.<br>
Next Xmt Time	The frame &amp; slot number before which this<br>
node is guaranteed not to transmit a Network configuration packet. This is initialized<br><br>
to NEXT_XMTJTIME_NOW. As part of the Aging procedure, and to avoid roll-over problems, this Next Xmt Time is also reset to this value whenever this Next Xmt Time plus the node's Xmt Holdoff Time is equal to or less than the current time.<br>
Reported Flag	Set to TRUE if this Next Xmt Time has been<br>
reported by this node in a Network configuration packet, otherwise set to FALSE.<br>
Contents of Network configuration Packet<br>
FIGURE 9 illustrates the contents of a network configuration packet, according to one embodiment of the invention.<br>
Management Message Type 901 indicates the type of the message.<br>
NumNbrEntries 902 is the number of neighbors reported on in the message. The number of neighbors reported on may be a fraction of the whole set of neighbors known to this node. A node can report on subsequent subsets of neighbors in its subsequent network configuration transmissions,<br>
NumBSEntries 903 is the number of mesh BS neighbors reported on in this message.<br>
Embedded Packet Flag 904 indicates whether there is an embedded packet within the network configuration packet.<br>
Xmt Power 905 is in 2 dBm steps, starting from 8dBm, (i.e. 1111 indicates 38 dBm).<br>
Xmt Antenna 906 is the logical antenna used for transmission of this message. This allows for Adaptive Antenna Systems (AAS) support for up to 8 antenna directions,<br>
NetEntry MAC Address Flag 907 indicates whether this entry is present or not.<br>
Network base channel 908 is the base channel being used in this node's network, which is the logical number of the physical channel, which is used to broadcast schedule control information. A subset of the possible physical channel numbers is mapped to logical channels in the Network Descriptor.<br>
Reserved field 909 is reserved.<br><br>
Netconfig count 910 is the counter of network configuration packets transmitted by this node.<br>
Timestamp 911 is used by neighbors to detect missed transmissions. This count is incremented by 1 for every network configuration transmission by this node. A synchronization hop count is used to determine superiority between nodes when synchronizing the network. Nodes can be assigned as master time keepers, which are synchronized externally (for example using GPS). These nodes transmit a Synchronization hop count of 0. Nodes synchronize to nodes with lower synchronization hop count, or if counts are the same, to the node with the lower Node ID.<br>
Netconfig schedule info 912 is used to store the Next Xmt Mx and the Xmt Holdoff Exponent. The Xmt Holdoff Time is the number of network configuration transmit opportunities after Next Xmt Time (there are network configuration -1 opportunities per network control subframe that this node is not eligible not transmit network configuration packets.<br>
Xmt Holdoff Time =2<xmthowoffexpone the next xmt mx includes time which is network configuration eligibility interval for this neighbor and computed as range exponcnt mx-h></xmthowoffexpone>
For example, if Next Xmt Mx =6 and Xmt Holdoff Exponent =4, then the node shall be considered eligible for its next network configuration transmission between 49 and 64 (due to the granularity) transmission opportunities away and ineligible before that time. If the Next Xmt Mx field is set to Ox IF (all ones), then the neighbor should be considered to be eligible to transmit from the time indicated by this value and every network configuration opportunity thereafter (i.e. treat Xmt Holdoff Time =0).<br>
NetEntry MAC Address 913 indicates presence or sponsorship of new node. The BS node ID is the Node ID of the mesh BS node reported on.<br>
Number of hops 914 is the number of hops between the reporting node and the reported mesh BS node.<br>
Xmt energy/bit 915 factor is the indication of energy/bit needed to reach mesh BS through this node. Xmt energy/bit is computed as Ej =min/J e N, *<br><br>
[Ej.* -f-EJ mW * ^is, in which N is the set of neighbors reporting the mesh BS and E*. &gt;j =PTx/R«.&gt;j in which PTx is the transmission power in mW from node i to node j and Ri.&gt;j is the datarate in Mbps from node i to node j. Ej is the Xmt energy /bit reported by neighbor j. The reported Xmt energy/bit factor is the computed Xmt energy/bit divided by 2(XmtEncrgyUllitExponCTt -4). XmtEnergyUnitExponent is a 4-bit field reported in the Networic Descriptor. Nbr node ID 916 is the Node ID of the neighbor node reported on.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, a network configuration packet contains the following information:<br>
My MAC Adr	32-bit MAC address (as part of TSync header)<br>
Next Xmt Time	My Next Xmt Time<br>
Xmt Holdoff Time     My Xmt Holdoff Time<br>
Each Network configuration packet also contains a list (length Y, TBD) of entries with the following fields. According to one embodiment of the invention, the list is selected in a round-robin manner from the node Is 1-hop neighbors (and also among the 2-hop neighbors if in 3-hop-scheduling mode) neighbors. The list may be selected in other manners.<br>
Nbr MAC Adr	32-bit MAC address<br>
Distance	1-hop (direct) neighbor or 2-hop neighbor<br>
Node Identifier	Either (Nbr ID) or (Nbr ID and Rep ID)<br>
Next Xmt Time<br>
Xmt Holdoff Time<br>
Also, each Network configuration packet contains a list (length Z, TBD) of entries with the following compressed fields.<br>
Distance        1-hop (direct) neighbor or 2-hop neighbor<br>
Node Identifier	Either (Nbr ID) or (Nbr ID and Rep ID)<br>
Next Xmt Time<br>
Xmt Holdoff Time<br>
FIGURE 3 illustrates a procedure used to select the list of physical neighbors to report in a compressed neighbor section of the Network configuration packet. After a start block, the logic flows to block 310 where neighbors reported in the round-robin list discussed above are excluded. Rowing to block 320, when<br><br>
operating in 2-hop-scheduIing mode, all 3-hop neighbor entries are excluded. Next, at block 330, all neighbor entries with the "Reported Flag1 set are excluded. Transitioning to block 340, the remaining neighbor entries are ordered by the Next Xmt Time, and the Z entries with the Next Xmt Time the furthest in the future are reported in this Network configuration packet. In general, learning of nodes with Next Xmt Times furthest into the future is more valuable than learning of nodes with Next Xmt Times approaching soon, since the neighbors will have more time to use this information before it's stale. Moving to block 350, the "Reported Rag" for all neighbors in either of the above lists is set to TRUE upon transmission of this Network configuration packet. The process then moves to an end block and returns to processing other actions.<br>
III. Transmission Scheduling<br>
FIGURE 4 illustrates a procedure for transmit scheduling, in accordance with aspects of the invention. During the current transmit ("Xmt") Time of a node (i.e., the time slot when a node transmits its Network configuration packet), the node uses the following procedure to determine its Next Xmt Time.<br>
After a start block, the logic flows to block 410, where the physical neighbor table is ordered in relation to the next transmit time. Moving to block 420, for each entry of the neighbor table, the node's Next Xmt Time is added to the node's Transmit Holdoff Time to arrive at the node's Earliest Subsequent transmit Xmt Time. Transitioning to block 430, the process sets the TempXmtTime equal to the node's advertised Xmt Holdoff Time added to the current Xmt Time. At block 440, the success flag is set equal to false. At decision block 450, a determination is made as to when the success flag equals false. When it does, the process moves to block 455 where if TempXmtTime equals the Next Xmt Time of any node in the Physical Neighbor List, then the process sets the TempXmtTime equal to next Network configuration frame/slot. Otherwise, the process moves to block 460, where the process determines the eligible competing nodes, which is the set of all nodes in the physical neighbor list with an Earliest Subsequent Xmt Time equal to or smaller than TempXmtTime. A neighborhood election is held among this set of eligible competing nodes using TempXmtTime as the seed and the MAC addresses of all<br><br>
eligible competing nodes at block 465. Rowing to decision block 470, a determination is made as to whether the node wins the election. If this node does not win the neighborhood election then the process moves to block 475, where TempXmtTime is set equal to next Network configuration frame/slot. Otherwise, the process sets success equal to true at block 480 and the process moves to block 485 where the node's Next Xmt Time is set equal to TempXmtTime.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the neighborhood election carried in the above procedure is the same as the election carried out in the REALM protocol (co-pending Application No. 09/248,738, entitled "Adaptive Communication Protocol for wireless Networks," filed February 10,1999),<br>
FIGURE 5 shows a process for Basic Neighborhood Election, in accordance with aspects of the invention. After a start block, the process moves to block 510 where, in each frame, each node (i) computes it's candidate-transmission-slot (CS(i)) by using a globally-known function (SlotFunc) that accepts the Network Age and a node's ID as inputs. This can be expressed as: CS(i) =SlotFunc (ID(i), NetAge).<br>
Transitioning to block 520, each node computes the candidate-transmission-slot of each of the nodes (j) in it's 2-hop neighborhood, using their node IDs, the globally known Network Age, and the same SlotFunc function (CS(j) =SlotFunc (ID(j), NetAge)).<br>
Of course, CS(k) for each node will give the same result, independent of which node is doing the computation (the local node, or one of the nodes in its 2-hop neighborhood). Therefore, each node is able to determine which, if any, of the nodes in its 2-hop neighborhood share the same candidate transmission slot. The IDs of these nodes are placed into node i's Contender Group (CG(i)) for this frame, according to: CG(i) =(j: CS(i) =CS(j)).<br>
Flowing to block 530, each node (i) computes the priority PR(j) of each node in it's contender group to determine which node has priority for this frame among these contenders, using the node ID, scheduling frame number, and optionally, the node's priority bias, as inputs into a globally known Priority Function (PriorityFunc). This may be expressed by: PR(j) =PriorityFunc (ID(j), NetAge) +<br><br>
PB(j). The PriorityFunc(a, b) results in a number that is unique for each possible input "a". If priority bias's are not used, then PB(j) is set to 0.<br>
Next, at block 540, node (i) will consider itself the winner of the contention if PR(i) is greater than any PR(j) in the contender group, or if PR(i) is tied for greatest, and would be the greatest is all priority bias's were 0.<br>
Node (i) can transmit in its candidate-transmission-slot CS(i) in the current frame if it is the winner in its contender group, and if its PR(i) is equal to or greater than a PriorityThreshold.<br>
The process then flows to an end block and returns to processing other actions.<br>
FIGURE 6 illustrates a Network configuration Transmission Procedure, in accordance with aspects of the invention. When the Next Xmt Time of the present node has been reached, the system performs the procedure as illustrated by FIGURE 6.<br>
After a start block, the process moves to block 610, where the process determines the Next Xmt Time of the node using the Xmit_Scheduling Procedure. Moving to block 615, the process determines its Next Holdoff Time (function based on the size of its Physical Neighbor Table, with some restrictions on how decreases are handled as described above). Flowing to block 620, a determination is made as to whether the "SKIP THIS NETWORK CONFIGURATION TRANSMIT" flag is set. When the flag is set, then the process skips the remaining steps and moves to an end block where the process returns to processing other actions. Moving to block 625, the process creates (as described above) the Network configuration packet. Next, at block 630, the process sets the "Reported Flag" to TRUE for all neighbor entries being reported in either the round-robin list or the compressed list. At block 635, the network configuration packet is transmitted at appropriate frame/slot boundary.<br>
FIGURE 7 illustrates a process when a Network configuration packet is received from a neighbor, in accordance with aspects of the invention. After a start block, the process moves to block 710 where the distance of the transmitting node is updated to 1-hop (direct) if necessary. Moving to block 720, for each reported node reached over a minimum number of hops through the neighbor, the<br><br>
distance to the reported nodes is updated to 1 plus what is reported. Transitioning to block 730, the Next Xmt Time and Xmt Holdoff Time of the transmitting node and all reported nodes are updated. Flowing to block 740, if any reported neighbor is found with a Next Xmt Time equal to the present node's Next Xmt Time, then a "SKIP THIS NETWORK CONFIGURATION TRANSMIT" flag is set (used above). This could occur as a transient condition with topology changes due to channel dynamics or mobility. Next, at block 750, if the Node Identifier for any reported node in the compressed neighbor list cannot be resolved to a neighbor entry (with MAC address) using the information in the Physical Neighbor Table, then skip this entry.<br>
FIGURE 8 illustrates a process for Physical Neighbor Aging, in accordance with aspects of the present invention. Periodically, this procedure is run on the Physical Neighbor List. After a start block, the process moves to block 810 where for any neighbors with a Next Xmt Time plus its Xmt Holdoff Time which is equal to or less than the current time, the Next Xmt Time is set to NEXT__XMT TIME NOW. Moving to block 820, the entry's Aging Time is reset to now. Flowing to block 830, for any neighbors with a NEXT XMT TIME NOW and an Aging Time equal to some (TBD) time in the past, the distance to that neighbor is increased by one. Transitioning to block 840, if this increase makes the distance 3-hops (or 4-hops if in 3-hop scheduling mode), then the neighbor entry is removed. Otherwise, the process moves to block 850 where the neighbor entry's Aging Time is again reset to now.<br>
Compression Methods<br>
Next Xmt Time may be compressed in Network configuration packets to 3-4 bits giving the Next Xmt Time rounded down to some overall block boundary (with each block containing a number of Network configuration transmission opportunities), Xmt Holdoff Time may be quantized to perhaps 3 bits with a range of 16 to 2048 frames/slots using the formula: Xmt Holdoff Time =2(x+<br>
