				<td>BACKRGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter (RTBC) and, more particularly, to a radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter for the treatment of cardiovascular disease.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
Therapeutic methods using a inflatable balloon, and an electrode placed in the balloon, and capable of creating a radiofrequency electric field by supplying radiofrequency energy to the electrode to heat the tissues in contact with the balloon for therapy are disclosed in, for example, Japanese Patent Nos. 2538375, 2510428 and 2574119 granted to the applicant of the present invention. The tissues in contact with the balloon must be uniformly or homogeneously heated to achieve the therapy satisfactorily. However, electrode lines forming the electrode cannot be uniformly arranged in the balloon. If the lines of the electrode are irregularly arranged, a liquid contained in the balloon is irregularly or inhomogeneously heated. The local temperature difference of the liquid contained in the balloon also increases due to convection and the temperature of the upper part in the balloon becomes higher. Consequently, the temperature is distributed unavoidably irregularly or inhomogeneously in the balloon. Therefore, the tissues in contact with the balloon cannot be uniformly heated.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an.object of the present invention to solve those problems in the prior art and to provide a radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter capable of uniform heating of the tissues in contact with the balloon to achieve thermotherapy such as ablation or hyperthermia safely and properly for a diseased part.<br><br>
Accordingly, there is provided a radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter<br>
comprising: a catheter consisting of an outer shaft and an inner shaft extended<br>
through the outer shaft so as to be slidable relative to the outer shaft; an<br>
inflatable balloon capable of being inflated so as to be in contact with a target<br>
lesion and placed between respective front end parts of the outer and the inner<br>
shaft; a radiofrequency electrode to be used for radiofrequency energy supply in<br>
combination with a counter electrode, inside the balloon, said counter electrode<br>
being disposed at a predetermined position;	a       lead       wire       electrically<br>
connected to the radiofrequency electrode; a temperature sensor capable of sensing temperature of a liquid contained in the balloon; and a temperature distribution uniformizing means for uniformizing temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon wherein the temperature distribution uniformizing means is a stirring means for stirring the liquid contained in the balloon, and wherein the balloon is formed of an antithrombotic, heat-resistant, and elastic resin.<br>
Accordingly       to        the        present       invention,        a       radiofrequency<br><br>
thermal balloon catheter comprises: a catheter consisting of an outer shaft and an inner shaft extended through the outer shaft so as to be slidable relative to the outer shaft; an inflatable balloon capable of being inflated so as to be in contact with a target lesion and equipped between respective front end parts of the outer and the inner shaft; a radiof requency electrode to be used for radiof requency energy supply in combination with a counter electrode, extended in a wall of the balloon or inside the balloon, the counter electrode being disposed at a predetermined position; a lead wire electrically connected to the radiofrequency electrode; a temperature sensor capable of sens ing temperature of a liquid contained in the balloon; and a temperature distribution uniformizing means for uniformizing temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon.<br>
The temperature distribution uniformizing means uniformizes the temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon to prevent the irregular temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon due to convection or the like, so that the target lesion in contact with the balloon can be uniformly heated by radiofrequency heating. Since the temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon can be uniformized, temperature of the liquid measured by the temperature sensor can be made to coincide accurately with the temperature of the target lesion , and hence the temperature of the target lesion can be accurately controlled.<br>
The temperature distribution uniformizing means may be a stirring means for stirring the liquid contained in the balloon. The stirring means stirs the liquid to make temperature distribution in the liquid uniform.<br>
The radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter may further comprise: a turning front sleeve put on a front end part of the inner shaft for turning about an axis of the catheter; a turning rear sleeve put on a front end part of the outer shaft for turning about the axis of the catheter; and a turning base sleeve holding the lead wire so that radiofrequency energy<br><br>
can be supplied to the lead wire and the lead wire can be turned; wherein the radiofrequency electrode includes a plurality of electrode lines extended in parallel to each other between the turning front sleeve and the turning rear sleeve, and the stirring means includes a rotative driving means for driving the radiofrequency electrode, the turning front sleeve, the turning rear sleeve, the lead wire and the turning base sleeve for turning.<br>
The rotative driving means of the stirring means drives the radiofrequency electrode, the turning front sleeve, the turning rear sleeve, the lead wire and the turning base sleeve for turning to turn the radiofrequency electrode during radiofrequency energy supply. Thus, uniform radiofrequency energy supply can be achieved and the temperature distribution in the liquid can be uniformized by the stirring effect of the turning radiofrequency electrode.<br>
The radiofrequency electrode may include a plurality of electrode lines connected to the turning front sleeve and the turning rear sleeve in parallel to each other. Thus the radiofrequency electrode can be easily formed and can be uniformly distributed in the balloon.<br>
Preferably, the linearly extended electrode lines forming the radiofrequency electrode can be warped in an arcuate shape so as to extend along the inner surface of the balloon when the outer shaft and the inner shaft are moved axially relative to each other to inflate the balloon.<br>
The liquid contained in the balloon can be efficiently stirred by turning the electrode lines of the radiofrequency electrode warped in the arcuate shape and a uniform radiofrequency electric field can be created.<br>
The lead wire may be wound helically, and the rotative driving means may turn the lead wire to turn the radiofrequency electrode.<br>
When the helically wound lead wire is turned in one direction, the helically wound lead wire is able to turn in the opposite direction by its own resilience to restore its natural shape when the rotative driving means stops turning<br><br>
the helically wound lead wire.<br>
The rotative driving means may drive the turning front sleeve, the turning rear sleeve, the lead wire and the turning base sleeve for turning alternately in opposite directions and may change the direction of turning of the turning front sleeve, the turning rear sleeve, the lead wire and the turning base sleeve after turning the same by a predetermined number turns in each of the opposite directions. Thus, the radiofrequency electrode can be simply turned alternately in opposite directions to stir the liquid contained in the balloon with the radiofrequency electrode.<br>
The stirring means may include a connecting pipe connected to the outer shaft, communicating with the balloon by means of a passage defined by the outer shaft and the inner shaft; and a vibration generating means for applying vibrations to a liquid filling up the connecting pipe and the passage.<br>
The vibration generating means applies vibrations to the liquid filling up the connecting pipe and the passage, and the vibrations are propagated to the liquid contained in the balloon and stir the liquid contained in the balloon to unif ormize temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon.<br>
The vibration generating means may apply vibrations to the liquid filling up the connecting pipe and the passage such that eddies are produced in the liquid contained in the balloon.<br>
Eddies produced in the liquid contained in the balloon enables the efficient uniformization of temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon.<br>
The temperature distribution uniformizing means is a circulating means for circulating the liquid in the balloon so that temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon is uniformized.<br>
Temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon can be uniformized by circulating the liquid of a fixed temperature by the circulating means.<br><br>
A part of the inner shaft extending in the balloon may be provided with a plurality of small nozzles, and the circulating means may include a liquid supply means capable of supplying the liquid into the inner shaft to jet the liquid through the small nozzles and of sucking the liquid jetted into the balloon through the passage defined by the outer and the inner shaft.<br>
The liquid supply means is capable of jetting the liquid through the small nozzles of the inner shaft and of recovering the liquid through the passage defined by the outer and the inner shaft.<br>
The radiofrequency electrode may be wound helically around a part of the inner shaft, extending in the balloon. Thus, the radiofrequency electrode can be easily disposed in the balloon for highly efficient radiofrequency heating.<br>
The balloon may be formed of an antithrombogenic, heat-resistant, and elastic resin. The balloon meets all characteristics required of the balloon satisfactorily.<br>
The predetermined position may be a position on a patient's body, and the counter electrode is attached to the pat ient's body.<br>
The predetermined position may be a position in the wall of the balloon or inside the balloon.<br>
The predetermined pos it ion may be a pos it ion neighboring the balloon.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS A radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter in a first embodiment according to the present invention will be described with reference to Figs. 1 to 4. Referring to Figs. 1 and 2, a radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 includes a catheter 4 consisting of an outer shaft 2 and an inner shaft 3 extended in the outer shaft 2 so as to be slidable relative to the outer shaft 2, an inflatable balloon 6 capable of being inflated so as to be in contact with a target lesion and extended between respective end parts of the outer shaft 2 and the inner shaft 3, a radiofrequency electrode 8 disposed in the balloon 6, a lead wire 10 electrically connected to the radiofrequency electrode 8, a thermocouple 12 placed in the balloon 6 and capable of sensing temperature in the balloon<br><br>
6, and a stirring device 14, i.e., a temperature distribution uniformizing means, for uniformizing temperature distribution in a liquid contained in the balloon 6. A guide wire 16 is extended through the inner shaft 3 substantially coaxially with the catheter 4. The guide wire 16 guides the catheter 4.<br>
A turning front sleeve 20 is put on a front end part of the inner shaft 3 extending in the balloon 6 for turning about the axis of the catheter 4. A turning rear sleeve 21 is put on a front end part of the outer shaft 2 for turning about the axis of the catheter 4 . The radiof requency electrode 8 includes a plurality of electrode lines 8a extended in parallel to each other between the turning front sleeve 20 and the turning rear sleeve 21. The electrode lines 8a of the radiof requency electrode 8 extend substantially linearly while the balloon 6 is deflated. When the balloon 6 is inflated by sliding the outer shaft 2 relative to the inner shaft 3, the electrode lines 8a are warped in an arcuate shape so as to extend along the inner surface of the balloon 6 as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
A turning base sleeve 23 is put on the inner shaft 3 for turning about the axis of the catheter 4 at a position near the rear end of the outer shaft 2 . The turning base sleeve 23 has a front end part provided with a ring 24, a rear end part provided with a contact ring 2 5, and a middle part provided with a gear 26. A brush 29 supported on a pantograph is kept in contact with the contact ring 25.<br>
An external thread 31 is formed in a rear end part of the outer shaft 2 . A nut 32 is engaged with the external thread 31. 0 rings 2 7 are put on the turning base sleeve 23 to seal the gap between the inner surface of the outer shaft 2 and the outer surface of the turning base sleeve 23 in a liquid-tight fashion. Thus the gap between the turning base sleeve 23 and the outer shaft 2, and the gap between the turning base sleeve 23 and the inner shaft 3 are sealed in a liquid-tight fashion. The inner shaft 3 extends through the turning front sleeve 20, the turning rear sleeve 21 and the turning base sleeve<br><br>
23. An external thread 33 is formed in a rear end part of the turning base sleeve 23, and a nut 34 is engaged with the external thread 33. An 0 ring 2 8 is held between the rear end of the turning base sleeve 23 and the nut 34. The 0 ring 28 seals the gap between the outer surface of the inner shaft 3 and the inner surface of the turning base sleeve 23 in a liquid-tight fashion.<br>
The lead wire 10 is coiled helically. The lead wire 10 has one end connected to the turning rear sleeve 21 and the other end connected to the contact ring 25. The brush<br>
2	9 kept in contact with the contact ring 25 is connected electrically to a radiofrequency generator 40. Radiofrequency energy generated by the radiofrequency generator 40 is supplied through the lead ire 10 to the radiofrequency electrode 8. The radiofrequency generator applies a radiofrequency current of 13.56 MHz betweemn the radiofrequency electrode 8 and a counter electrode 53 (Fig.<br>
3	) attached to the surface of the patient' s body. For example, radiofrequency energy with an output of 100 to 200 W is supplied to the radiofrequency electrode 8 when the diameter of the balloon 6 is about 2.5 cm. When the radiofrequency current is applied between the radiofrequency electrode 8 and the counter electrode 53 attached to the surface of the patient's body, tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 are cauterized by capacitive type heating accompanying radiofrequency dielectric heating. The dielectric heating is generated around the electrode 8 inside the balloon 6 in proportion to the various dielectric constants. Consequently, the tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 are cauterized according to the principle of radiofrequency heating that heat is generated in touching parts of dielectric members respectively having different dielectric constants.<br>
A reduction gear 3 5 having gears 36 and 37 and a motor 38 are disposed near the gear 26. The rotation of the output shaft of the motor 38 is transmitted through the gears 3 7 and 3 6 at a reduced speed to the gear 26. The motor 38 may be controlled such that the output shaft thereof rotates by<br><br>
a predetermined number of turns in one direction or may be controlled such that the output shaft thereof rotates alternately by two full turns in a clockwise direction and by two full turns in a counterclockwise direction.<br>
The lead wire 10 is formed of a somewhat rigid material. When the motor 3 8 drives the turning base sleeve 23 fastened to the gear 26, the lead wire 10 connected to the ring 24 is turned and, consequently, the turning rear sleeve 21, the radiofrequency electrode 8 and the turning front sleeve 2 0 are turned.<br>
When the motor 3 8 is controlled so as to turn the lead wire 10 by a predetermined number of turns in one direction, the lead wire 10 is turned in a direction opposite to a direction in which the lead wire 10 is wound helically. When the motor 38 is stopped after turning the lead wire 10 by a predetermined number of turns, the lead wire 10 turns automatically in the opposite direction to restore its original shape. The radiofrequency electrode 8 can be turned alternately in opposite directions by alternately starting and stopping the motor 38. When the motor 38 is controlled such that the output shaft thereof rotates alternately by two full turns in a clockwise direction and by two full turns in a counterclockwise direction, the lead wire 10 is formed of a resilient material in a straight shape to turn the radiofrequency electrode 8 alternately in opposite directions.<br>
The stirring device 14, i.e., a temperature distribution uniformizing means, includes the turning front sleeve 20, the turning rear sleeve 21, the turning base sleeve 23 and the motor 3 8 to turn the radiofrequency electrode 8. The lead wire 10 transmits the rotative driving motion of the motor 3 8 to the radiofrequency electrode 8, and transmits the radiofrequency energy generated by the radiofrequency generator 40 to the radiofrequency electrode 8. The stirring device 14 acts for eliminating the local temperature differences generated in the balloon 6 and the stirring device 14it makes uniform the temperature distribution in the liquid inside the balloon 6.<br><br>
A branch pipe 51 is connected to a rear end part of the outer shaft 2. The branch pipe 51 is provided with an air vent pipe and a contrast medium supply pipe. The air vent pipe of the branch pipe 51 is opened to evacuate the balloon 6, and then the contrast medium supply pipe of the same is opened to supply a liquid, such as a physiological saline solution, is supplied into the balloon 6 to inflate the balloon 6.<br>
The inner shaft 3 is provided with two lumens, i.e., first and second lumens. The first lumen is used as a space for extending the guide wire 16 and as a passage for the liquid. The second lumen is used as a space for extending conductors for transmitting a signal provided by the thermocouple 12 attached to a middle part of an exposed segment of the inner shaft 3.<br>
The temperature of the liquid contained in the balloon 6 is measured by the thermocouple 12 attached to the inner shaft 3. The conductors of the thermocouple 12 are extended through the second lumen of the inner shaft 3 and are connected to a thermometer 42. The thermometer 42 indicates the temperature of the liquid contained in the balloon 6.<br>
The balloon 6 is formed of a heat-resistant, elastic, antithrombogenic resin. In an inflated state, the balloon 6 has a shape resembling an onion as shown in Fig. 1.<br>
The radiofrequency electrode 8 includes the plurality of electrode lines 8a. The number of the electrode lines 8a is in the range of several to several tens. When the inner shaft 3 is moved axially relative to the outer shaft 2 to reduce the interval between the turning front sleeve 20 and the turning rear sleeve 21, the substantially linear electrode lines 8a are warped in an arcuate shape, so that the radiofrequency electrode 8 assumes a shape generally resembling a basket or an onion. If the electrode lines 8a are formed of a shape memory alloy, the electrode lines 8a are able to change their shape accurately between the substantially linear shape and the arcuate shape. Front and rear end parts of the electrode lines 8a are coated with a<br><br>
resin to prevent the excessive radiofrequency heating of the front and rear end parts of the electrode lines 8a.<br>
The radiofrequency generator 4 0 supplies power of a radiof requency on the order of megahertz, such as 13.56 MHz, to the radiofrequency electrode 8. Thus, heat is generated by capacitive radiof requency heating in a part of the patient' s body between the radiofrequency electrode 8 and the counter electrode 53 attached to the surface of the patient's backr as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
The radiofrequency electrode 8 is connected to the contact ring 25 of the turning base sleeve 23 by the helical lead wire 10. The brush 2 9 supported on the pantograph and connected to the radiofrequency generator 40 is kept in contact with the contact ring 25 to supply radiofrequency energy to the radiofrequency electrode 8. The radiofrequency electrode 8 is turned to create a further uniform radiofrequency electric field around the radiofrequency electrode 8.<br>
The reduction gear 35 reduces an input speed, i.e., the rotating speed of the output shaft of the motor 38, to a lower output speed. The rotative force of the motor 38 is transmitted through the reduction gear 35, the gear 26 to the turning base sleeve 23. The rotation of the turning base sleeve 23 is transmitted to the turning rear sleeve 21 by the lead wire 10 to turn the electrode lines 8a in the balloon 6. Consequently, the liquid filling up the inflated balloon 6 is stirred by the electrode lines 8a to prevent irregular temperature distribution due to convection and to uniformize temperature distribution in the liquid filling up the balloon 6. Thus, the temperature of the liquid in a central region in the balloon 6, the temperature of the liquid in the vicinity of the wall of the balloon 6 and the temperature of the tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 can be equalized. Therefore, the temperature of the liquid in the central region in the balloon 6 measured by the thermocouple 12 and indicated by the thermometer 42 represents the temperature of the tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 accurately.<br>
The temperature of the liquid is measured by the<br><br>
thermocouple 12 disposed in the middle part of exposed segment of the inner shaft 3 while the radiofrequency energy is supplied to the radiofrequency electrode 8, and the output of the radiofrequency generator 40 is controlled in a feedbackr control mode so that the liquid filling up the balloon 6 is heated at an optimum temperature. Consequently, the tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 can be heated at an optimum temperature.<br>
The turning basketlike radiofrequency electrode 8 creates a more uniform radiofrequency electric field, and stirs the liquid filling up the balloon 6. Thus, temperature distribution in the liquid is uniformized and the tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 can be heated accurately at a desired temperature.<br>
The operation of the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 as applied to the electrical isolation of the pulmonary vein for the treatment of the atrial fibrillation will be described.<br>
Fig. 3 is a view of assistance in explaining an operation for cauterizing the tissues 18 of the atrium 19 around the ostium 17a of the pulmonary vein 17. A cycle of supplying a physiological saline solution through the branch pipe 51 of the outer shaft 2 into the balloon 6 and sucking the physiological saline solution out of the balloon 6 is repeated several times to purge the balloon 6 of air. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the balloon 6 is deflated and the inner shaft 3 is fully projected from the outer shaft 2 such that the distance between the turning front sleeve 2 0 and the turning rear sleeve 21 is increased to a limit and the electrode lines 8a of the radiofrequency electrode 8 extend substantially linearly before inserting the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 in the pulmonary vein 17. In this state, the diameter of the balloon 6 is reduced to its minimum. Then, the balloon 6 is inserted in the pulmonary vein 17. The radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 is operated to locate the balloon 6 near the target tissues 18. Then, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the inner shaft 3 is retracted, supplying the contrast medium<br><br>
and the physiological saline solution through the branch pipe 51 into the balloon 6 to inflate the balloon 6. Since the turning front sleeve 20 is moved toward the turning rear sleeve 21, the electrode lines 8a are warped in an arcuate shape. Thus, the radiofrequency electrode 8 is expanded in the shape of a basket in the balloon 6. The radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 is operated minutely to bring the balloon 6 into contact with the target tissues 18.<br>
Then, the motor 3 8 is started to drive the turning base sleeve 23 for turning through the reduction gear 35. The turning motion of the turning base sleeve 23 is transmitted to the turning rear sleeve 21 by the helical lead wire 10 extended through the catheter 4. Consequently, the radiofrequency electrode 8 expanded in the shape of a basket in the balloon 6 is turned to stir the liquid filling up the balloon 6.<br>
Subsequently, the radiofrequency generator 40 applies a radiofrequency current of, for example, 13.56 MHz between the counter electrode 53 attached to the patient's back, and the contact ring 25 connected to the radiofrequency electrode 8 expanded in the shape of a basket of the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1. A radiofrequency current flows through the brush 29 in contact with the contact ring 25. Consequently, the balloon 6 and the tissues 18 in contact with the balloon 6 are heated by radiofrequency capacitive type heating accompanying radiofrequency dielectric heating. Although the temperature of an upper region in the balloon 6 is higher than that of a lower region in the balloon 6 due to convection if the liquid contained in the balloon 6 is not stirred, the temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon 6 is uniform because the liquid is stirred by the turning radiofrequency electrode 8 expanded in the shape of a basket. The tissues 18 are heated irregularly if the radiofrequency electrode 8 is misaligned with the balloon 6 and is fixedly held in the balloon 6. Since the radiofrequency electrode 8 is turned, a uniform radiofrequency electric field is created around the radiofrequency electrode<br><br>
8, and the balloon 6 and the tissues 18 are heated uniformly by radiofrequency heating.<br>
Parts of the balloon 6 near the turning sleeves 20 and 21 around which the electrode lines 8a are gathered have a tendency to be overheated. Such overheating can be avoided by forming the turning sleeves 20 and 21 of a material having a small dielectric constant, such as a resin or a ceramic material, by coating parts of the electrode lines 8a with a resin and/or by circulating cooling water through the inner shaft 3.<br>
Thus, the pulmonary vein 17 can be electrically isolated by cauterizing the tissues 18 of an annular part of the atrium 19 around the pulmonary vein 17 to safely treat the patient with atrial fibrillation.<br>
A radiof requency thermal balloon catheter 1 in a second embodiment according to the present invention will be described hereinafter. The radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 includes a circulating system 60 for circulating a liquid contained in a balloon 6 to uniformize temperature distribution in the liquid. A part of an inner shaft 3 extending in the balloon 6 is provided with a plurality of small nozzles 64. The circulating system 60 includes a temperature controller 66 for keeping a liquid to be supplied into the inner shaft 3 at, for example, 37 °C, and a liquid supply device 62 capable of supplying the liquid of a predetermined temperature controlled by the temperature controller 66 into the inner shaft 3 and of sucking the liquid jetted through the small nozzles 64 into the balloon 6 through an annular space between the inner shaft 3 and an outer shaft 2. When inflated, the balloon 6 has an ellipsoidal shape. A radiofrequency electrode 8 is wound helically around the part of the inner shaft 3 extending in the balloon 6. The radiofrequency electrode 8 is connected to a radiofrequency generator 40 by a lead wire 10. The temperature of the liquid contained in the balloon 6 is measured with a thermocouple 12 and is monitored by a method similar to that mentioned in the description of the first embodiment, and radiofrequency<br><br>
energy to be supplied to the radiofrequency electrode 8 is controlled according to the measured temperature.<br>
As shown in Fig. 5, a circulating liquid 70 controlled at, for example, 37 °C by the temperature controller 66 is heated at 44 °C while the same is flowing through the part of the inner shaft 3 extending in the balloon 6 and is jetted through the small nozzles 64 into the balloon 6. The temperature of the circulating liquid 70 jetted into the<br>
balloon 6 drops to 43.5 °C and drops further to 43 °C when the circulating liquid 7 0 reaches the front end of the outer shaft 2. The circulating liquid 7 0 is thus circulated by the circulating system 60 to keep the liquid contained in the<br>
balloon 6 uniformly at about 43.5 °C.<br>
The radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 shown in Fig. 5 will be described as applied to the medical treatment of an arteriosclerotic part as shown in Fig. 7.<br>
The balloon 6 of the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 is deflated and the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 is inserted through the femoral artery in a diseased part 68 of the carotid artery as shown in Fig. 6(a). Then, a contrast medium and a physiological saline solution are supplied through a branch pipe 51 attached to the outer shaft 2 into the balloon 6 . Consequently, the balloon 6 is inflated to expand a stricture in the diseased part 68 as shown in Fig. 6(b). In this state, the application of a radiofrequency voltage of 13.56 MHz across the radiofrequency electrode 8 and a counter electrode 53 attached to the patient's backr is started.<br>
The circulating system 60 supplies the circulating liquid 70 of, for example 37 °C by pressure into the lumen of the inner shaft 3. The circulating liquid 70 heated by radiofrequency heating is jetted through the small nozzles 64 into the balloon 6 . The circulating liquid 7 0 flows through the balloon 6, uniformizing temperature distribution in the balloon 6 and is discharged through the lumen of the outer<br>
shaft 2. When the balloon 6 is maintained at 43.5 °C for 20 minor longer, the inflammatory cells or the proliferous smooth<br><br><br>
muscle cells in the atherosclerotic lesion part 68 of the carotid artery undergo apotos is and the atherosclerotic lesion part 68 of the carotid artery stabilizes. Then, the balloon 6 is deflated and the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 is extracted from the femoral artery.<br>
The radiof requency thermal balloon catheter 1 is capable of uniformly heating the tissues of the diseased part 6 8 at an optimum temperature. Thus, the atherosclerotic lesion part 68 of the carotid artery can be stabilized through the apotosis of the inflammatory cells or the proliferous smooth muscle cells macrophages, i.e., labile factors, by heating the atherosclerotic lesion part 68 of the carotid artery at<br>
43.5 °C for 20 min or longer without affecting normal tissues, such as endothelia.<br>
The radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 can be applied to hyperthermia for cancer. It is proved that cancer cells can be controlled or eradicated by heating the same<br>
at 43.5 °C for 2 0 min or longer.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8 showing a radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 in a third embodiment according to the present invention, the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter 1 includes a balloon 6 and a stirring device 80 for stirring a liquid contained in the balloon 6 to uniformize temperature distribution in the liquid.<br>
The stirring device 80 includes a connecting pipe 82 connected to an outer shaft 2 so as to open into an annular passage 83 defined by the outer shaft 2 and an inner shaft 3 extended through the outer shaft 2, and a vibration generator 81, such as a vibration-generating diaphragmatic pump, to apply vibrations to a liquid filling up the annular passage 83. The connecting pipe 82 communicates with the balloon 6 by means of the annular passage 83. Vibrations 86 of, for example, about 1 Hz generated by the vibration generator 81 propagate through the liquid filling up the connecting pipe 82 and the annular passage 83. Consequently, eddies 85 are produced in the liquid contained in the balloon 6 due to the interaction between the oscillated liquid and the gravity.<br><br>
The eddies stir the liquid through going indefinite directions , so that temperature distribution in the liquid contained in the balloon 6 is uniformized. Thus, atheroma formed in the tissues 68 can be heated homogeneously at an optimum temperature.<br>
A radiofrequency electrode 8 helically wound around the inner shaft 3 similarly to the radiofrequency electrode 8 shown in Fig. 5 is used for radiofrequency heating.<br>
Satisfactory eddies can be produced in the liquid contained in the balloon 6 by the vibrations 86 generated by the vibration generator 81 when the balloon 6 is formed of a properly elastic material.<br>
As apparent from the foregoing description, the radiofrequency thermal balloon catheter of the present invention is capable of uniformly heating tissues in contact with the balloon at an optimum temperature by radiofrequency heating and of safely forming a penetrating three-dimensional necrotic layer without causing ulceration due to the thrombus formation or the charring of tissues. Therefore, it is possible to achieve safely and surely the treatment of the arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation triggered by an extrasystole from the pulmonary vein and its ostium through isolation of the pulmonary veins.<br>
Since the tissues can be uniformly heated at an optimum temperature, an arteriosclerotic part can be stabilized by heating the arteriosclerotic part at a predetermined temperature to make the inflammatory cells or the proliferative smooth muscle cells which are the factors of instability, undergo apotosis without affecting normal tissues, such as endothelium.<br>
Although the invention has been described in its preferred embodiment with a certain degree of particularity, obviously many changes and variations are possible therein.<br>
For example, it is described in its preferred embodiment that the counter electrode 53 is attached to the surface of the patient's body. However, the position, where the counter electrode 53 is disposed, is not limited to the surface of<br><br>
the patient's body. The counter electrode 53 may be disposed at a position in the wall of the balloon or inside the balloon, or the counter electrode 53 may be disposed at a position neighboring the balloon.<br>
It is therefore to be understood that the present invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein without departing from the scope and spirit thereof.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
