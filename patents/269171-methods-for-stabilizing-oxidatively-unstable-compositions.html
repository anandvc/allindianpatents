				<td>METHODS FOR STABILIZING OXIDATIVELY UNSTABLE COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention related to compositions of oxidatively unstable ophthalmic<br>
ingredients and methods for preparing such compositions<br>
RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims priority from a non-provisional filing, U.S. App.<br>
Pat. No. U.S. App. Pat. No. 60/783,557 entitled "Methods for Stabilizing<br>
Oxidatively Unstable Pharmaceutical Compositions," which was filed on, March<br>
17, 2006.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Therapeutic agents for topical administration to the eye are generally<br>
formulated in either a liquid or gel form and must be kept sterile until<br>
administration. Accordingly, ophthalmic therapeutic agents are either<br>
i<br>
packaged asceptically, which is cumbersome and expensive or are heat<br>
sterilized. Unfortunately, many therapeutic agents are not oxidatively stable,<br>
especially at elevated temperatures.<br>
EDTA, Dequest, and Desferal have been used to improve the stability of<br>
certain therapeutic agents during autoclaving. However, there remains a need<br>
for other compounds capable of stabilizing unstable therapeutic agents that are<br>
susceptible to oxidative degradation. This need is met by the following<br>
invention.<br>

required to inhibit the oxidative degradation of the pharmaceutical ingredient.<br>
In most circumstances it is preferred that there is a 1:1 molar ration of metal<br>
present in the ophthalmic composition to chelant, is more preferably about 1 of<br>
metal to greater than about 1 of chelant compositions, most preferably about 1<br>

The advantages of the compositions and methods of this invention are<br>
numerous. First ketotifen is known as a oxidatively unstable pharmaceutical<br>
i<br>
ingredient. Compositions containing ketotifen fumarate are known. These<br><br>
compositions contain EDTA and the pH of those compositions is about 5.5.<br>
These EDTA solutions stabilize the ketotifen fumarate against oxidative degradation, the pH of these solutions is below the threshold for ocular<br>
awareness and it is likely that some patient who use this solution will be<br>
uncomfortable due to low pH value of the solution. See Tang, I., Wong, D.M.,<br>
Yee, D.J. and Harris, M.G. 1996 The pH of multi-purpose soft contact lens<br>
solutions. Optom. Vis. Sci. 73:746-749. Adler, F.H. 1959 Physiology of the<br>
Eye. Third edition, p.40. Brawner, L.W. and Jessop, D.G. 1962. A review of<br>
contact lens solutions. Contacto 6:49-51. It has been discovered that the<br>
stabilizing agents of the invention will reduce the degradation of ketotifen<br>
fumarate at higher pH values that those of ketotifen fumarate solutions<br>
containing EDTA. The pH of ophthalmic compositions of the invention is<br>
preferably between about pH 6.6 and about pH 7.2, more preferably between<br>
about pH 6.8 and about pH 7.0.<br>
Second it has been shown that the shelf life of ketotifen fumarate<br>
i<br>
solutions containing DTPA are superior to the shelf life of ketotifen fumarate<br>
solutions containing either EDTA or PAA. Third, it is known that the application<br>
of heat increases the rate of degradation of many pharmaceutical ingredients.<br>
i<br>
It has been shown that the stabilizing agents of this invention are useful in<br>
reducing degradation associated with higher temperature, such as sterilization<br>
temperatures.<br>
In order to illustrate the invention the following examples are included.<br>
These examples do not limit the invention. They are meant only to suggest a<br>
i<br>
method of practicing the invention. Those knowledgeable in contact lenses as<br>
well as other specialties may find other methods of practicing the invention.<br>
However, those methods are deemed to be within the scope of this invention.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The following abbreviations are used below<br>
PAA<br>
Polyacrylic Acid, sodium salt having an average molecular weight<br>
of 200,000<br>
EDTA<br>
Ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid.<br><br>
Solution A<br>
Deionized water containing the following ingredients by weight: NaCI<br>
(0.83%), Boric Acid (0.91%), Sodium tetraborate decahydrate (0.1%)<br>
Initial Testing to Determine Suitability of Ingredients<br>
It is known that excessive quantities of certain transition metals and their<br>
salts will degrade ketotifen fumarate. The amount of metals and salts<br>
contained within commercially available ingredients varies, so test<br>
batches of Solution A were evaluated as follows. 200 g Solution A was<br>
mixed at ambient temperature and ketotifen fumarate (5 mg + 2 mg) was<br>
added and mixed until homogenous. Six glass vials were filled with 3ml_<br>
of this solution. The vials were stopped with poly tetrafluoroethylene<br>
("PTFE ") and three of the vials were heated for eighteen minutes at<br>
124 °C. Samples of each treated vial (1.0-1.5 mL) were analyzed by<br>
HPLC and compared to the untreated controls. If the amount of<br>
ketotifen in the treated vials reduced by less than or equal to five percent<br>
(≤5%) the ingredients were determined to be suitable for further studies<br>
and larger batches of Solution A were prepared from these ingredients.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Ketotifen Fumarate Solutions with PAA. EDTA<br>
PAA (2000 μg/mL) was added to Solution A, and 50 μg/ml_ of ketotifen<br>
fumarate (approximately 36 μg/mL of ketotifen) was dissolved in the system.<br>
EDTA (100 μg/mL) was added to another batch of Solution A, and 50 μg/mL of<br>
ketotifen fumarate was dissolved in the system. Negative One and negative<br>
twelve (-1.0 and 12.0) diopter etafilcon A contact lenses were added to vials<br>
containing 3mL of each of the above solutions. The vials were sealed with<br>
PTFE coated rubber stoppers, sterilized at 124 °C for 18 minutes, and stored at<br>
ambient temperature for one year. Samples were harvested throughout the<br>
year and analyzed for the presence of ketotifen by HPLC. The results are<br>
presented in Figures 1 and 2. These results show that there is substantial<br>
degradation of the ketotifen over time with PAA and with EDTA.<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Preparation of Ketotifen Fumarate Solutions with PAA. DTPA ;<br>
To separate batches of Solution A, Ca2DTPA (100 μg/mL and 300<br>
μg/mL, 213 and 640 μmoles/L respectively) and 2000 μg/mL (0.2%,<br>
approximately 18.51 mmole/L methacrylate content) of PAA were added, and<br>
approximately 25 μg/mL of ketotifen fumarate (approximately 18 μg/mL of<br>
ketotifen) was dissolved in each of the systems. Three mL samples of each<br>
solution were added to individual vials containing contact lenses. Each set of<br>
vials was closed with PTFE stoppers, sterilized at 124 °C for 18 minutes, and<br>
stored at 80°C for a period of two weeks. Samples were harvested at various<br>
intervals and analyzed for the presence of ketotifen by HPLC. The results are<br>
presented in Figure 3. These results show that there is substantial degradation<br>
of the ketotifen over time with PAA but not with the calcium salt of DTPA<br>
Example 3<br>
Ketotifen Fumarate Solutions with oxidation catalysts<br>
Ketotifen fumarate (50μg/ml_, approximately 36μg/mL of ketotifen) was<br>
dissolved in Solution A containing approximately 500 μg/mL of either DTPA<br>
(approximately 1272 μmoles/L of DTPA) or the sodium salt of EDTA<br>
(Na2C10H1408N2•2 H2O, 1344 μmoles/L of EDTA). Approximately 50 μg/mL of<br>
the salts listed in Table 1 were dissolved in each of the solutions and about<br>
3ml_ of each solution was dosed into several vials The vials were sealed With<br>
PTFE coated rubber stoppers and were subjected to zero, one, two or three<br>
sterilization cycles as indicated in Table 1. One sterilization cycle is eighteen<br>
minutes of heating at 124 °C. Samples were analyzed by HPLC for the<br>
concentration of ketotifen at the intervals indicated in Table 2. This data<br>
shows that in the presence of oxidative catalysts, DTPA reduces the amount of<br>
oxidative degradation as compared to EDTA.<br><br><br><br>
