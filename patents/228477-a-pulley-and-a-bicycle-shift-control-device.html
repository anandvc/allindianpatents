				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention is directed to a pulley and a bicycle shift control device and, more particularly, to a shift control device having a compact design to facilitate mounting the shift control device in close proximity to other structures.<br>
Twist-grip shift control devices are sometimes used to control various types of bicycle transmissions. Examples of such devices are disclosed in USP 3,633,437 and USP 5,197,927. Each device disclosed in those patents includes a rotatable handgrip mounted around the handlebar coaxially with the handlebar axis, a pulley inclined relative to the rotatable hand grip for winding a transmission cable, and a motion transmitting structure for transmitting motion of the rotatable handgrip to the pulley. In the device disclosed in USP 3,633,437, the motion transmitting member is a pair of bevel gears formed by the peripheral surfaces of the rotatable handgrip and the pulley. The device disclosed in USP 5,197,927 also employs a pair of bevel gears formed by the peripheral surfaces of the rotatable handgrip and the pulley. Alternatively, that device may employ a connecting cable connected between the rotatable hand grip and the pulley.<br>
When a connecting cable is used to transmit motion between the rotatable hand grip and the pulley, the pulley typically must have two winding grooves - one for the cable controlling the bicycle transmission and another one for the cable coupling the pulley to the rotatable handgrip. The winding grooves usually are located on an outer peripheral surface of the pulley. The end of each cable is fitted with a terminating nipple that is fitted within a recess formed in the pulley. The pulley ordinarily has a thickness sufficient to accommodate two nipples aligned end to end, even though the two nipples are not always positioned adjacent to each other, in order to provide sufficient support and rigidity for the two cable nipples. However, such a thickness increases the size of the shift control device, thus making the shift control device aesthetically unappealing, and it makes it difficult to mount the shift<br><br>
control device in close proximity to other devices, such as a brake lever assembly.<br>
Another problem with conventional twist-grip shifting devices is that the overall structure of such devices does not allow other control devices to be efficient mounted adjacent to them because the housing of the shifting device usually extends perpendicular to the handlebar, and the pulley is located almost immediately adjacent to the handlebar. As a result, the other control device must be located laterally of the pulley, far away from the rider's hand, which makes the control device difficult if not impossible to operate. Some devices may be mounted adjacent to the housing, but this, too, tends to locate the other control device further from the rider's hand than is desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a bicycle shift control device which has a rotatable handgrip mounted around the handlebar coaxially with the handlebar axis, a pulley inclined relative to the rotatable handgrip for winding a transmission cable, and a motion transmitting structure for transmitting motion of the rotatable handgrip to the pulley. In a twist-grip shifting device constructed according to the present invention the pulley is thinner than conventional pulleys, and the shifting device has a clamping apparatus which clamps the shift control device to the bicycle handlebar in a manner which allows other control devices to be mounted adjacent to the shifting device very efficiently.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention directed to the pulley, the pulley includes a pulley body having an outer peripheral surface, a first winding groove formed on the outer peripheral surface for winding a first transmission element, and a second winding groove formed on the outer peripheral surface for winding a second transmission element. The first winding groove is inclined relative to the second winding groove. In a more specific embodiment, the pulley has a mounting portion so that the pulley rotates around a rotational axis, wherein the first winding groove is inclined relative to the second winding groove in the direction of the rotational axis. In an even more specific embodiment, the first winding groove includes a first groove segment that is inclined relative to the second winding groove<br><br>
and a second groove segment that is parallel to the second winding groove. This structure<br>
allows any terminating nipple on the first transmission element to be placed closer to the second winding groove, thus decreasing the thickness of the pulley over prior art structures.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention directed to a clamping apparatus which clamps the shift control device to the bicycle handlebar in a manner which allows other control devices to be mounted adjacent to the shifting device very efficiently, the clamping apparatus includes a clamping unit and a housing attached to the clamping unit. In a specific embodiment of the clamping unit, the clamping unit includes a clamp member structured to mount to a handlebar around a first axis coaxial with the handlebar, a clamp arm member coupled to the clamp member and extending in a radial direction from the clamping member, and a housing mounting member disposed on the clamp arm member and spaced apart from the clamp member. The housing includes a base member structured to mount to the handlebar around the first axis, a housing arm member coupled to the base member and extending in the direction of the clamp arm member, and a pulley coupling member disposed on the housing arm member and spaced apart from the base member, wherein the pulley coupling member is fixed to the housing mounting member. A pulley is coupled to the pulley coupling member for rotation around a second axis that usually is oriented differently from the first axis.<br>
In a more specific embodiment of the clamping unit, the housing mounting member is laterally offset from a lateral edge of the clamp arm member, and the housing mounting member defines a housing fastener opening offset from the lateral edge of the arm member for receiving a housing fastener therethrough. The fastener is used to mount the housing to<br>
the housing mounting member. The offset positioning of the housing mounting member allows other bicycle control devices to be mounted in the recess formed by the offset housing mounting member and the lateral edge of the clamp arm member. This, in turn, provides for a more ergonomic relationship between the shift control device and the other control device. To make the structure even more ergonomic and compact, the base member of the housing may surround at least a portion of the clamp member, and the housing arm member may extend along the clamp arm member.<br><br>
Accordingly tne present invention provides a pulley comprising a pulley body having an outer peripheral surface; a first winding groove formed on the outer peripheral surface for winding a first transmission element thereon; a second winding groove formed on the outer peripheral surface for winding a second transmission element thereon; and characterized in that the first winding groove is inclined relative to the second winding groove.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention also provides a bicycle shift control device comprising a rotatable handgrip structured for rotation around a first axis coaxial with a handlebar; a pulley operatively coupled to the handgrip, for rotation in a rotation plane around a rotational axis in response to rotation of the handgrip, wherein the pulley comprises an outer peripheral surface; and a first winding groove formed on the outer peripheral surface characterized in that said first winding groove inclined relative to the rotation plane.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
Figure 1 is a side view of a bicycle 1 equipped with a particular embodiment of a shift control device 10 according to the present invention. Bicycle 1 is a typical bicycle that includes a front wheel 2, a rear wheel 3, pedals 4 for driving a chain 5, and a derailleur 6 that guides chain 5 laterally along a plurality of sprockets 7 mounted to rear wheel 3. Derailleur 6 is controlled by a twist-grip shift control device 10 mounted around a handlebar 8 through a transmission control cable 11. In this embodiment, a brake lever assembly 9 also is mounted around handlebar 8 in close proximity to shift control device 10.<br>
Figure 2 is an oblique view of shift control device 10 mounted together with brake lever assembly 9. As shown in Figure 2, shift control device 10 includes a housine 12<br><br>
mounted around tfte handlebar 8, a rotatable handgrip 16 structured for rotation around an axis X coaxial with handlebar 8, a pulley 21 for pulling and releasing an inner wire 1 la of control cable 11, and a pulley retaining member 28 for retaining pulley 21 to housing 12. Pulley retaining-member 28 may include a framed opening 28a for selectively displaying a numeral disposed on pulley 21 indicating the currently selected gear.<br>
Brake lever assembly 9 includes a brake lever 9a pivotably mounted to a brake lever bracket 9b which, in turn, is mounted around handlebar 8 in close proximity to (e.g., adjacent) housing 12 of shift control device 10. Brake lever 9a is connected to a brake control cable 9c for controlling a brake device in a conventional manner.<br>
Figure 3 is an exploded view of a portion of shift control device 10 illustrating housing 12, a clamping unit 13 used to fasten shift control'device 10 to handlebar 8, pulley 21, and pulley retaining member 28 in more detail. As shown, in Figure 3, clamping unit 13 comprises a collar-shaped clamp member 13a structured to mount around handlebar 8, a clamp arm member 13b coupled to clamp member 13a and extending in a radial direction from clamp member 13a, and a housing mounting member 13c disposed on clamp arm member 13b and spaced apart from clamp member 13a for mounting a portion of housing 12 to clamping unit 13. In this embodiment, housing mounting member 13c is laterally offset from a lateral edge 13h of clamp arm member 13b. This allows brake bracket 9b to be mounted more economically and compactly adjacent to shift control device 10 by fitting brake bracket 9b in the recess formed by the offset housing mounting member 13c and the lateral edge 13h of clamp arm member 13b.<br>
Clamp member 13a includes a fastening flange 13f defining a first fastener opening 13g for receiving a clamping fastener 25 therethrough, and clamp arm member 13b includes a second fastener opening 13d aligned with first fastener opening 13g for receiving clamping fastener 25 therethrough. When housing 12 is assembled to clamping unit 13, clamping fastener 25 also extends through an opening 12f in housing 12, and a threaded portion 25a of clamping fastener 25 engages a threaded nut 12g. Tightening clamping fastener 25 with nut 12g causes fastening flange 13f to move toward clamp arm member 13b, thus tightening<br><br>
clamp member 13a to handlebar 8.<br>
Housing 12 includes a generally annular base member 12a structured to mount around handlebar 8, a housing arm member 12j coupled to base member 12a and extending in the direction of the clamp arm member 13b (e.g., extending along clamp arm member 13b), and a pulley coupling member 12b having a generally flat surface 12k disposed on housing arm member 12j and spaced apart from base member 12a. A pulley shaft 12c having a shaft opening 12h extends from surface 12k, and pulley 21, which has a central opening 21c, is rotatably mounted around pulley shaft 12c for rotation around an axis Y that is oriented differently (e.g., perpendicular) relative to the handlebar axis X.<br>
Pulley retaining member 28 has an opening 28c that is shaped to nonrotatably mount pulley retaining member around pulley shaft 12c. Pulley 21 and pulley retaining member 28 are retained on pulley shaft 12c by a pulley fastener 22 and washer 22a. Pulley fastener 22 extends through shaft opening 12h into a threaded opening 13k defined by housing mounting member 13c so that pulley fastener 22 also fastens pulley coupling member 12b to housing mounting member 13c. Threaded opening 13k is located in the offset portion of housing mounting member 13c so that brake lever bracket 9b may be positioned approximately below opening 13k.<br>
A cable interface member 12e abuts against a cable mounting flange 12d formed on pulley coupling member 12b, and a cable adjusting barrel 12m for receiving outer casing 1 lb of transmission control cable 11 passes through cable interface member 12e and screws into cable mounting flange 12d. A resistance enhancing spring 12p is disposed between cable adjusting barrel 12m and cable interface member 12e to press cable interface member 12e against cable mounting flange 12d and prevent inadvertent movement of cable adjusting barrel 12m. Cable adjusting barrel 12m operates in a well known manner to adjust the tension on inner cable 11a.<br>
Figures 4A-4E illustrate the structure of pulley 21 in more detail. Pulley 21 includes a pulley body 21k having an outer peripheral surface 21m and a central opening 21c for<br><br>
receiving pulley shaft 12c therethrough. A first winding groove 21e is formed on the outer peripheral surface 21m for winding a first transmission element in the form of a connecting cable 23 (Figure 3), and a second winding groove 21d is formed on the outer peripheral surface 21m for winding a second transmission element in the form of inner wire 1 la of transmission control cable 11. As seen more specifically in Figure 4C, first winding groove 21e is inclined relative to second winding groove 21d in the direction of the rotational axis Y. More specifically, first winding groove 21 e includes a first groove segment 21 x that is inclined relative to second winding groove 21d and a second groove segment 21 y that is parallel to the second winding groove 2Id. In this embodiment, first winding groove 21 e has a varying radius of curvature L2 as shown in Figure 4E, whereas second winding groove 21d has a constant radius of curvature LI as shown in Figure 4d. Alternatively, second winding groove 21 d may have a varying radius of curvature as shown in Figure 4F. Of course, first winding groove 21 e may have a constant radius of curvature if desired in some applications. Second winding groove 21d lies completely within a rotation plane P perpendicular to axis Y (in which case first winding groove 21 e is inclined relative to rotation plane P), but of course that is not necessary.<br>
Pulley 21 further includes a first transmission element fixing portion in the form of a generally cylindrical opening 21b for seating a terminating nipple 23b attached to the end of cable 23, and a second transmission element fixing portion in the form of a generally cylindrical opening 21a for seating a terminating nipple 1 lb attached to the end of inner wire 1 la. In this embodiment, cylindrical openings 21a and 21b are located in close proximity to outer peripheral surface 21m, and they are spaced apart from each other in the peripheral direction of the pulley body 21k. A cable passage 21b' extends from opening 21b through a side of pulley body 21k to facilitate placement of termination nipple 23b in opening 21b. Opening 21a has a longitudinal opening axis R that is generally tangent to groove 2Id, and opening 21b has a longitudinal axis S that extends generally parallel to rotational axis Y. These structures combine to provide a pulley that is thinner than prior art pulleys.<br>
Figure 5 is an exploded view of a particular embodiment of the indexing mechanism used in shift control device 10. As shown in Figure 5, shift control device 10 further includes<br><br>
a fixed member 15 for attaching to handlebar 8 in such a way that it cannot rotate in relation to handlebar 8; rotatable handgrip 16, with gripping protrusions 16h' capable of rotating around the handlebar axis X on fixed member 15; an intermediate element 17 (called "an idler") that meshes with both the fixed member 15 and the rotatable handgrip 16, that can rotate around the handlebar axis X, and that can move along the handlebar axis X; and a takeup member 18 that remains in constant gear engagement with the intermediate element 17, and can thus rotate integrally with intermediate element 17. The general theory of operation (and numbering) of these components is the same as the indexing mechanism described in U.S. patent application number 08/854,520 filed May 12, 1997 entitled "Bicycle Shift Control Device" by Takuro Yamane and incorporated herein by reference. This embodiment of an indexing mechanism differs from the embodiment shown in that patent application in that a terminating nipple 23a attached to the opposite end of connecting cable 23 is fitted within a generally cylindrical opening 182 in takeup member 18, there are fewer serrations 172 and teeth 181, and there is a coupling hole 15d in fixed member 15 for coupling to a coupling abutment 12k in base member 12. Otherwise the components are structured and operate the same, so a further description of these components is omitted.<br>
While the above is a description of various embodiments of the present invention, further modifications may be employed without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.
