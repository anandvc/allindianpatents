"POLYSILOXANE COMPOUND"<br>
GE BAYER SILICONES GMBH 8&amp; CO. KG. of Falkenberg 1, 40699 Erkrath, Germany<br>
GRANTED<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
10-10-2006<br>
ORIGINAL                       31 JUL 2006<br><br>
The invention concerns polysiloxane compounds, methods for manufacturing them and their use.<br>
Tertiary amino groups containing polysiloxanes have been disclosed as textile softeners in EP-A-0 441 530. The additional introduction of ethylene oxide/propylene oxide units as hydrophilizing components leads to an improvement of the effect as described in US 5,591,880 and US 5,650,529. There it was proposed to position alkylene oxide units and tertiary amino groups in side chains which are connected with the siloxane main chain -    through ester structures. The disadvantage with this concept is the complicated esterification in the presence of tertiary amino groups. An alternative to this of bringing polyalkylene oxides having a,<o-epoxy-modified siloxanes with secondary amino functions is known from us also></o-epoxy-modified>
Likewise, the reaction of a,co-epoxy-modified siloxanes with piperazine has been described which leads to oligomer to polymer structures with tertiary amino functions in the main chain depending upon the amount of piperazine used as described in US 4,847,154.<br>
a,co-diquaternary polysiloxanes are known from US 4,891,166. The synthesis takes place by reaction of a,co-diepoxides with tertiary amines in the presence of acids. US 4,833,225 discloses linear polyquatemary polysiloxanes which are synthesized through the J reaction of <x with di-tertiary amines in the presence of acids. alternatively a alkyl-modified siloxanes are converted into polymer polyquatemary compounds accordance us></x><br><br>
The substances in accordance with US 4,891,166, US 4,833,225 and US 4,587,321 possess a marked tendency to shrink on solid surfaces.<br>
US 5,196,499 describes polysiloxane compounds with terminal quaternary ammonium groups. Polysiloxane compounds with inside place, bivalent or trivalent bridging quaternary ammonium groups are nonetheless not mentioned there.<br>
Alkylene oxide-modified quaternary polysiloxanes have been synthesized from a,G&gt;-<br><br><br><br>
OH terminated polysiloxanes and trialkoxy silanes by condensation. The quaternary ammonium structure is introduced through silane whereby the quaternary nitrogen atom has been substituted by alkylene oxide units, as already described in US 5,625,024.<br>
Strictly comb-like alkylene oxide-modified quaternary polysiloxanes are already known from US 5,098,979. The hydroxyl groups of comb-like substituted polyether siloxanes are converted into the corresponding chlorohydrin derivatives with epichlorohydrin. Quaternization with tertiary amines is joined to this. The disadvantage with this synthesis is the necessity of dealing with epichlorohydrin and the relatively low reactivity of the chlorohydrin grouping during quaternization.<br>
For this reason, the hydroxyl groups of comb-like substituted polyether siloxanes have been alternatively esterified with chloroacetic acid. The subsequent quaternization can be completed facilitated by carbonyl activation as disclosed in US 5,153,294 and US 5,166,297.<br>
Linear polyammonium structures which contain siloxane, alkylene oxide and bridging ammonium units are not accessible through the described processes.<br>
In DE-OS 3236466, the transformation of OH-terminated siloxanes with alkoxy siloxanes containing quaternary ammonium structures furnishes reactive intermediate products which should cross-link into wash-resistant surfaces on the fiber surface with suitable cross-linking agents such as trialkylsiloxanes. A basic disadvantage of this approach is that the stability of an aqueous finishing bath cannot be guaranteed over hours and unforeseen cross-linking reactions can occur in the bath already before textile finishing. An improvement of the properties of the polysiloxane compounds is also desirable.<br>
Consequently, it is the objective of the invention to describe polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds, their manufacture and use as wash-resistant hydrophile softeners, whereby the polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds bestow a soft touch typical of silicones upon the textiles following suitable application, and this property image is not lost even after the action of detergent formulations during repeated washing processes at if need be increased temperature. It is a further an objective of the invention<br><br><br><br>
to describe the use of these polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds as separate softeners according to or as softeners in formulations for washing fibers and textiles based upon non-ionogenic or anionic/non-ionogenic surfactants as well as as substances for preventing or reversing textile crumpling.<br>
It is furthermore an objective of the invention to furnish polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds for use as wash-resistant, hydrophile softeners for textiles which can resist the attack of concentrated surfactant solutions with high fat and dirt loosening capacity. Furthermore, the polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds should resist the strongly alkaline complex formers, oxidatively acting bleaching agents and complex enzyme systems contained in modern washing agents, even if the fibers are often exposed to the action through such washing agents for hours at high temperature.<br>
A further objective of the invention consists in furnishing treatment compounds for hair which are subject to a low ability to wash out in the presence of surfactants. Correspondingly, cosmetic formulations should also be furnished through the present invention which contain the polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds.<br>
For this reason, it is the objective of the present invention to make available polyammonium structures which contain siloxane, alkylene oxide and bridging ammonium units which do not have the disadvantages of the state of the art.<br>
The objective is accomplished in accordance with the invention by polysiloxane compounds in which siloxane and alkylene oxide substructures are joined with each other through ammonium structures.<br>
The invention concerns polysiloxane compounds containing: a)        At least one polyalkylene oxide structural unit with the general formula: -A-E-, -E-A-, -A-E-A'- and/or -A'-E-A-wherein<br>
A =     -CH2C(0)0-, -CH2CH2C(0)0-, -CH2CH2CH2C(0)0-, -OC(0)CH2-, OC(0)CH2-, -OC(0)CH2CH2- and/or -OC(0)CH2CH2CH2 A' =    -CH2C(0)-, -CH2CH2C(0)-, CH2CH2CH2C(0)-, -C(0)CH2-,<br><br><br><br>
-C(0)CH2-, -C(0)CH2CH2- and/or -C(0)CH2CH2CH2-E =     a polyalkylene oxide group of the general formulae: -[CH2CH20]q-[CH2CH(CH3)0]r- and/or -[OCH(CH3)CH2]r-[OCH2CH2]q-With<br>
q =      1 to 200, r =       0 to 200, whereby the terminal position oxygen atom of Group A binds to the terminal position -CH2-group of Group E, and the terminal position carbonyl carbon atom of Group A' binds to the terminal position oxygen atom of Group E forming ester groups in each case, and/or at least one terminal position polyalkylene oxide structural unit of the formula<br>
-A-E-R2 wherein A and E have the aforementioned meaning, and R =    is H, straight chain, cyclical or branched Ci-C2o-hydrocarbon radical, which is interrupted by -0-, or -C(O)- and substituted with -OH and can be acetylenic, olefinic or aromatic<br>
a)	at least one bivalent or trivalent organic radical which contains at least one ammonium group,<br>
b)	at least one polysiloxane structural unit with the general formula:<br>
-K-S-K-, with<br>
S =<br><br>
Rl<br>
k<br><br><br>
wherein	R1 =    Ci-C22-alkyl, Ci-C22-fluoralkyl or aryl,<br>
n =      0 to 100, and these can be identical or<br>
different if several S Groups are present in the polysiloxane compound, K =     a bivalent or trivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C2-C40 hydrocarbon residue which is interrupted by -0-, -NH-<br>
-NR1-,-C(O)-,-C(S)-, ._„	and substituted with -<br>
OH, wherein<br>
R1       is defined as above, or if need be represents a bond to<br>
a bivalent radical R3 R3       represents a monovalent or bivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C1-C20 hydrocarbon radical which is interrupted by -0-, -NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and can be substituted with -OH, or -A-E-R2, wherein A, E and R are defined as above, whereby the residues K can be identical or different from each other, and in the event that K represents a trivalent radical, the saturation of the third valence takes place through a bonding to the above mentioned organic radical which contains at least one ammonium group,<br>
d)        at least one organic or inorganic acid radical for neutralization of the<br>
charges resulting from the ammonium group(s). The polysiloxane compounds of the invention are characterized in that they have the components a) to d) defined above.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds are moreover formed by binding the structural units<br><br><br>
. or radicals a) to c) mentioned to one another. The component d) serves for neutralization of the positive charges resulting from the b) components.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the invention can be oligomer or polymer compounds. Oligomer compounds moreover also include the case described below in which the polysiloxane compound only has one repetition unit.<br>
Polymer polysiloxane compounds of the invention furthermore naturally arise by alternating linkage of bivalent radicals.<br>
In the case of polymer polysiloxane compounds of the invention, the terminal position groupings result from the terminal position atom groupings of the starting materials used. This is inherently known to the specialist.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polymer polysiloxane compounds of the invention<br>
are linear polyammonium-polysiloxane compounds which are composed of the structural<br>
components a) to c). The linear polymer polysiloxane compounds of the invention,<br>
especially their linear polymer main chain formed from the repetition units, can be built up<br>
alternating stringing together of polyalkylene oxide structural units a), organic radicals<br>
which contain at least one, preferably quaternary ammonium group b) and polysiloxane<br>
structural units c). That is, the free valences which are if need be present in addition in the<br>
structural components (as they can occur with trivalent radicals as components b) or with<br>
trivalent radicals K) preferably do not serve for the buildup of polymer side chains or<br>
polymer branches.<br>
In a further embodiment, the main chain of the linear polymer polysiloxane<br>
compounds of the invention of the organic radicals which contain at least one ammonium<br>
group b) and which build up the polysiloxane structural units c) and the polyalkylene oxide<br>
structural units a) can bind to the trivalent organic ammonium group radicals as side<br>
chains.<br>
Thus, for example, the following structures result:<br>
-(Polyalkylene oxide structural unit-polysiloxane structural unit-polyalkylene oxide<br>
structural unit-preferably quaternary ammonium group radical)x-<br>
-(Polysiloxane structural unit-preferably quaternary ammonium group residue)x-<br>
Polyalkylene oxide structural unit)x-<br><br><br><br>
-(Polysiloxane structural unit-preferably quaternary ammonium groups radical)x-*Polyalkylene oxide structural unit<br>
Polysiloxane compounds of the invention which have only one repetition unit according to the molar proportion of monomer starting compounds. This is inherently known to the specialist. This case leads, for example, to the polysiloxane compounds of the invention of the structure:<br>
(terminal position polyalkylene oxide structural unit-quaternary ammonium group radical-polysiloxane structural unit-quaternary ammonium group radical-terminal position polyalkylene oxide structural unit).<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the invention preferably basically consist of the components a) to d), whereby the polymer polysiloxane compounds of the invention naturally have the terminal groups resulting from the transformation of the monomer starting materials. But monofunctional chain breaking agents can also be used.<br>
With the polyalkylene oxide structural units a), it can also be a matter of bivalent radicals of the general formula:<br>
-A-E-, -E-A-, -A-E-A'- and/or -A'-E-A-. The radicals A or A' here mean: A =     -CH2C(0)0-, -CH2CH2C(0)0-5 -CH2CH2CH2C(0)0-, -OC(0)CH2-, 0C(0)CH2-,<br>
-OC(0)CH2CH2- and/or -OC(0)CH2CH2CH2-<br>
A' =    -CH2C(0)-, -CH2CH2C(0)-, CH2CH2CH2C(0)-, -C(0)CH2-5 -C(0)CH2-, |<br>
-C(0)CH2CH2- and/or -C(0)CH2CH2CH2-<br>
The polyalkylene oxide Group E of the general formulae: -[CH2CH20]q-[CH2CH(CH3)0]r and/or -[OCH(CH3)CH2]r[OCH2CH2]q- with q = 1 or 2 to 200, r = 0 to 200, moreover include all possible ethylene oxide/propylene oxide groupings. Thus, it can be a matter of statistical ethylene oxide/propylene oxide copolymer groups or ethylene oxide/propylene oxide block copolymer groups with any desired arrangement of one or more ethylene oxide or propylene oxide blocks.<br>
The binding of the radicals A or A' to Group E moreover takes place such that the<br><br><br>
terminal position oxygen atom of Group A binds to the terminal position -CH2- group of<br>
»<br>
Group E, and the terminal position carbonyl carbon atom of Group A' binds to the terminal position oxygen atom of Group E while forming ester groups in each case.<br>
With the polyalkylene oxide structural units a), it can continue to be a monovalent, that is terminal position polyalkylene oxide structural unit of the formula<br>
-A-E-R2-, wherein A and E have the aforementioned meaning and R2 is H, a straight chain, cyclical or branched C1-C20 hydrocarbon radical which can be interrupted by -0-, or -C(O)- and be substituted with -OH, and which can be acetylenic, olefinic or aromatic.<br>
The component b) from which the polysiloxane compounds of the invention are composed is at least a bivalent or trivalent organic radical which contains at least one ammonium group. The bonding of the radical to the remaining components of the polysiloxane compounds of the invention preferably takes place through the nitrogen atom of one or more ammonium groups in the organic radical. The concept of "bivalent" or "trivalent" means that the organic ammonium radical has two or three free valences for forming bondings, especially to the remaining components of the polysiloxane compounds of the invention. The ammonium radical is appropriately represented by an N£U+ group in which at least two hydrogen atoms are<br>
substituted by organic groups. Preferably it is a matter of secondary or quaternary, especially preferably a quaternary ammonium group. A quaternary ammonium group is generally (see, for example, Rompp, Chemical Lexicon) defined as a group in which all four hydrogen atoms of an NH/ group have been replaced by organic radicals.<br>
The component c) of the polysiloxane compounds of the invention is at least one polysiloxane structural unit of the general formula:<br><br>
-K-S-K-, S is therein a polysiloxane group of the general formula:<br><br><br><br>
'wherein R1 = C1-C22 alkyl, C1-C22 fluoroalkyl or aryl, preferably phenyl, n = 0 to 1000, and if several Groups S are present in the polysiloxane compound, these can be identical or different.<br>
R1 is preferably C1-C18 alkyl, C1-C18 fluoroalkyl and aryl. Furthermore, R1 is preferably C1-C18 alkyl, C1-C6 fluoroalkyl and aryl. Furthermore, R1 is preferably C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 fluoroalkyl, more preferably C1-C4 fluoroalkyl, and phenyl. Even more preferably, R1 is methyl, ethyl, trifluoropropyl and phenyl.<br>
In the framework of the present invention, the term "C1-C22 alkyl" means that the aliphatic hydrocarbon groups possess from 1 to 22 carbon atoms which can be straight chain or branched. Methyl, ethyl, propyl, n-butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, iso-propyl, neopentyl and 1,2,3-trimethyl hexyl serve as examples.<br>
In the framework of the present invention, the concept "C1-C22 fluoroalkyl" means aliphatic hydrocarbon compounds with 1 to 22 carbon atoms which can be straight chain or branched and are substituted with at least one fluorine atom. Monofluormethyl, monofluoroethyl, 1,1,1-trifluorethyl, perfluoroethyl, 1,1,1-trifluoropropyl, 1,2,2-trifluorobutyl are presented as examples.<br>
In the framework of the present invention, "aryl" means unsubstituted or phenyl<br>
substituted once or several times with OH, F, Cl CF3, C1-C6 alkyl, C1-C6 alkoxy, C3-C7<br>
cycloalkyl, C2-C6 alkenyl or phenyl. The expression can also mean naphthyl if need be.<br>
K represents a bivalent or trivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C2-C40<br>
hydrocarbon radical which can be interrupted by -0-, -NH-,     1    , -NR -, -C(O)-, -C(S)-,<br>
and     R*   and be substituted with -OH. Here "interrupted" means that in the event of the bivalent radical, a -CH2- grouping is replaced, in the case of a trivalent radical, a [paste in trivalent CH] is replaced by the aforementioned groups. This also applies for the remaining part of the description if this designation is used.<br>
Group K bonds to the silicon atom of Group S through a carbon atom.<br>
Group K can, as can be seen above, likewise preferably have quaternary ammonium groups so that ammonium groups result in the polysiloxane compounds of the<br><br><br><br>
invention in addition to the ammonium groups in the component b) mentioned.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the invention can, as for example in radical K, have amino groups. The transformation of the polysiloxane groups of the invention with acids leads to their protonation. Such polysiloxane compounds having protonated amino groups are contained in the scope of the present invention.<br>
The binding of the component c), the polysiloxane structural unit -K-S-K-, to the remaining structural components through radical K preferably does not take place through a nitrogen atom of radical K.<br>
R is as defined above or if need represents a bonding to a bivalent radical R so that a cycle results.<br>
R3 represents a monovalent or bivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C1-C20 hydrocarbon radical which is interrupted by -0-, -NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and can be substituted with -OH, or -A-E-R2, wherein A, E and R2 are defined as above.<br>
The residues K can be identical or different from each other, and in the event that K represents a trivalent radical, the saturation of the third valence takes place through a bonding to the above mentioned organic radical which contains at least one ammonium group.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the invention furthermore contain the components d), at least one organic or inorganic acid radical for neutralization of the charges resulting from the ammonium group. Organic or inorganic acid radicals are radicals which formally result from the cleavage of one or more proteins from organic or inorganic acids and include, for example, a halogenide, such as fluorides, chlorides, bromides, sulfates, nitrates, phosphates, carboxylates, such as formiate, acetate, propionate, etc., sulfonates, sulfates, polyether carboxylates and polyether sulfates. Chloride is preferred. The organic or inorganic anionic acid radicals can be identical or different from one another as component d) of the polysiloxane compounds of the invention. Hence preferably halogenide ions result from the transformation of amines with alkyl halogenides, while, for example, carboxylates result from carboxylic acids which can be added during the<br><br><br>
^conversion of bis epoxides with amines.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the polysiloxane compounds of the invention, K represents a bivalent or trivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C2-C40 hydrocarbons<br>
which are interrupted by -O-, -NH-,	, -NR1 -, C(O)-, -C(S)- and can be substituted<br>
with -OH, wherein R1 is defined as above, and whereby the radicals K can be identical or different from each other.<br>
The previously mentioned organic radical which contains at least one, preferably quaternary ammonium group, is preferably a radical of the general formula:<br>
-N'-F-N1-<br>
wherein N1 is a quaternary ammonium group of the general formula<br><br>
wherein R4 represents a monovalent or bivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C1-C20 hydrocarbon residue, which is interrupted by -0-, -NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and can be substituted with -OH, and R5 represents a monovalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C1-C20 hydrocarbon residue which can be interrupted by -0-, -NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)- and substituted with -OH, or a single bond to a bivalent radical R4 or a quadrivalent radical F, and the radicals R4 and R5 within the group -N'F-N1- as well as in the polysiloxane compound can be identical or different from one another.<br>
F is a bivalent or quadrivalent straight chain, cyclical or branched C2-C30<br>

, -C(O), -C(S)-, a siloxane chain S (in which the above references apply to S) and can be substituted by -OH.<br>

 groups that can be traced hydroxylated carboxylic acids, preferably saccharide carboxylic acids.<br>
in the so-called first embodiment of the invention, R14 further preferably represents hydroxylated groups from the group comprised of<br><br>
In the so-called first embodiment of the invention, m is 2 to 100, preferably 2 to 50.<br>
In the so-called first embodiment of the invention, n is 0 to 1,000, preferably 0 to 100, more preferably 0 to 80, and especially preferably 10 to 80.<br>
In the so-called first embodiment of the invention, q is 1 to 200, preferably 1 to 50, more preferably 2 to 20, and especially preferably 2 to 10.<br>
In the so-called first embodiment of the invention, r is 0 to 200, preferably 0 to 100, more preferably 0 to 50, and even more preferably 0 to 20.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the so-called first embodiment as specified in the invention can be expediently produced by causing a,co-hydrogen polysiloxanes of the general formula<br><br>
to react via hydrosilylation with 1.0 to 1.5 mol (in relation to SiH groups) of a carboxylic haloacid ester, which derives from low-molecular, oligomeric and polymeric alkenyl- or alkinyl-modified alkylene oxides of the general composition<br>
HO[CH2CH20]q-[CH2CH(CH3)0]rR15<br>
wherein q and r are defined as above, and then converting the haloacylated siloxane-alkylene oxide intermediate stages that form into polyquaternary polysiloxane derivatives using di-tertiary amines, whereby the stoichiometry of the haloacyl groups to the tertiary amino groups preferably  <br>
To the extent the a,<o si-h functionalized siloxanes of the general structure></o><br><br>
are not commercially available, these siloxanes can be produced via known methods, e.g. via equilibration (Silicone, Chemie und Technologie [Silicones, Chemistry and Technology], Vulkan Publishers, Essen 1989, pp 82-84).<br>
The introduction of the alkylene oxide blocks occurs over the corresponding carboxylic haloacid esters of the alkylene oxides. Preferred starting materials for their synthesis are the above-named low-molecular, oligomeric and polymeric alkylene oxides of the general composition<br>
HO[CH2CH20]q-[CH2CH(CH3)0]rR15<br>
wherein the meanings for q and r are as defined above. The group R15 expediently represents alkenyl and alkinyl structures, which are converted to K via the inherently familiar addition of sSiH. Examples for R15 are allyl- butenyl-, hexenyl-, propinyl- and allylglycidyl structures. Preferred representatives with reference to the alkylene oxide block are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, the oligoethylene glycols having molar weights of 300 to 1,000 g/mol, preferably molar weights of approximately 400, 600, and 800 g/mol (400 to 800 g/mol) are used, and dipropylene glycol. The production of the alkenyl- or alkinyl-modified alkylene oxides is accomplished via the acid- or alkaline-catalyzed addition of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide to the corresponding alcohols, as described in US 5 625 024, and in Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum [Organic Chemistry Basic Practical Course], 17* Edition, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1988, p 259.<br>
The esterification of the alkenyl- or alkinyl-modified alkylene oxides takes place in a known manner (Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 17th Edition, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1988, pp 402-408) via reaction with the C2-C4 halogen carboxylic acids, their anhydrides, or acid chlorides. Chloroacetic acid and 3-chloropropionic acid are preferably used as the acid chlorides. The reaction is carried out in the absence of solvents. Details of the reaction may be taken from the examples.<br><br><br><br>
In the subsequent step, the a-alkenyl/alkinyl-, ©-haloacyl-alkylene oxides are brought to react with the a,co Si-H-functionalized siloxanes. The general implementation of hydrosilylations using unsaturated carboxylic haloacid esters is known (B. Marciniec, Comprehensive Handbook on Hydrosilylation, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1992, pp 134-137,151-155).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the above-described process, first a,co-OH-terminated reactive intermediate products are produced via hydrosilylation of the alkenyl- or alkinyl-modified alkylene oxides; in a subsequent esterification stage these intermediate products can then be converted to the corresponding a,co-haloacyl compounds. These a,co-haloacylated siloxane-alkylene oxide intermediate stages can be converted into polyquatemary polymers with the proper amines.<br>
It is generally possible to use secondary amines, which, with a stoichiometric ratio of 2 : 1 haloacyl groups to secondary amines, supply the corresponding polyquatemary compounds. In a further preferred embodiment, the use of amines that are equipped with two tertiary amino functions is desirable, in which the stoichiometric ratio of haloacyl groups to tertiary amino groups preferably is 1 : 1.<br>
These amines can be molecules with straight-chain spacers between the tertiary amino functions, such as N,N,N',N'-tetramethylethylene diamine and the corresponding higher alkene derivatives. It is also possible to use cyclical amines. N,N'-dimethylpiperazine and triethylene diamine are examples of these.<br>
In a further embodiment of the above-described method for producing the polysiloxane compound of the first embodiment of the invention, amines having more than two tertiary amino functions are preferably used, as long as two tertiary amino functions have a sufficient reactivity advantage over the other tertiary amino functions.<br>
N,N,N',N",N"-pentamethyldipropylene triamine is an example of this. Molecules of this type are then viewed as difunctional.<br>
It is further possible to position functional structures between the tertiary amino structures. Thus,<br><br><br>
 t is within the scope of the invention to use a.co-tertiary amino-modified siloxanes, which may be produced, for example, via the reaction of a,co-SiH functionalized siloxanes with N,N-dialkylallyl amines, preferably N,N-dimethylallylamine (B. Marciniec, Comprehensive Handbook on Hydrosilylation, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1992, pp 122-124). Alternatively, for the synthesis of the a,a)-tertiary amino-modified siloxanes, corresponding a,co-epoxy-functionalized siloxanes may be caused to react with secondary amines from the group of dialkyl amines, e.g. dimethylamine, or the cyclical amines, such as morpholine or piperidine, or secondary-tertiary diamines, such as N-methylpiperazine. Surprisingly, with this variation, it was found that in the hydrosilylation stage of allylamine derivatives, epoxide derivatives, which generally are easier to handle, such as those from the group of allylglycide ethers, can be used. In a further preferred embodiment of the above-described method, siloxanes having more than two tertiary amino groups may be used, as long as their reactivity is sufficiently differentiated, as stated above. One example of this is the aminosiloxanes, which can be synthesized in a two-stage reaction of cc,a&gt;-SiH functionalized siloxanes with allylglycide ether, and a subsequent alkylation with N-methylpiperazine.<br>
If the secondary amines or the molecules that contain at least two tertiary amino structures are brought to react with the a,ro-haloacylated siloxane-alkylene oxide intermediate stages in the above-discussed stoichiometrics, then linear products are created, in which siloxane-alkylene oxide blocks are bonded to one another via quaternary ammonium functions. With the purposeful use of amines that have more than two tertiary amino functions it is possible to synthesize regioselective products having tertiary and quaternary nitrogen atoms in their polymer structures.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the above-described first embodiment of the invention, several a,a&gt;-haloacylated siloxane-alkylene oxide intermediate stages may be used, which may differ in terms of the chain length of the siloxane components and/or the alkylene oxide components. In a further embodiment it is also possible to replace a portion of the a,co-haloacylated siloxane-alkylene oxide intermediate stages with a,to-haloacylated alkylene oxide derivatives without a siloxane component.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the above-described first embodiment of the invention, the a,co-haloacylated siloxane-alkylene oxide intermediate stages can be bonded to various amines. The prerequisite for these advantageous forms, however, is the retention of the desired overall stoichiometry of the reaction.<br><br><br><br>
'Preferred anions are especially the halogenide ions, preferably chloride ions that form during quaternation. However, other anions may also be introduced via ion exchange. Anions such as carboxylates, sulfonates, sulfates, polyether carboxylates, and polyether sulfates are presented as examples.<br>
The quaternization reactions are preferably run in polar organic solvents. Suitable solvents include, for example, alcohols from the group comprised of methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, and n-butanol; glycols from the group comprised of ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, the methyl-, ethyl-, and butylethers of the glycols mentioned, 1,2-propylene glycol and 1,3-propylene glycol; ketones, such as acetone and methylethyl ketone, esters, such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and 2-ethyl-hexyl acetate, ethers, such as tetrahydrofurane, and nitro compounds, such as nitromethane. The choice of solvent is based essentially upon the solubility of the reaction partners and the desired reaction temperature.<br>
The reactions are run within a range of 20° C to 130° C, preferably 4° C to 100° C. The reaction times are based upon the temperature and the nature of the groups reacting with one another. In general, the reactions can be conducted within a span of one to 10 hours.<br>

More preferred embodiments of this so-called second embodiment of the invention and methods for producing the disclosed polysiloxane compounds of the formulas (II) and (II') will be described below.<br>
The possibility of a trivalent substructure for K means here that K can be branched, in which case it participates in the quaternization of N2 with two bonds. The possibility of a divalent substructure for R8 means that these cases involve a structure that forms cyclical systems, wherein R9 then is a single bond at R2.<br>
R8 is preferably -CH3, -CH2CH3, -(CH2)2CH3, -(CH2)3CH3, -(CH2)5CH3,<br><br>
wherein R17 is a straight-chain, cyclical or branched CrCi8 hydrocarbon radical, which can be interrupted by -0-, -NH-, -C(O)-, -C(S)-, and can be substituted by -OH.<br>
As mentioned above, R8 and R9 together can also form a cyclical structure of the formulas<br><br><br><br>
For the preferred meanings for R1 in the so-called second embodiment of the invention, please refer to the preceding exposition.<br>
In the so-called second embodiment of the invention, K is preferably a divalent or trivalent, straight-chain, cyclical or branched C3-Ci6 hydrocarbon radical, which can be interrupted by -O-, -<br>
NH-,<br>
—N— -NR1-,     I     . -C(O)-, -C(S)-, and can be substituted by -OH, wherein R1 is defined as above.<br>
Preferred for K, for example, are groups of the following structures:<br><br>

R17 preferably represents unsubstituted C5-C17 hydrocarbon radicals, which derive from the corresponding fatty acids, or hydroxylated C3-C,7 groups, which can be traced to hydroxylated carboxylic acids, preferably to saccharide carboxylic acids.<br>
R17 is especially preferably chosen from the group comprised of<br><br><br><br><br>
In the so-called second embodiment of the invention, n is preferably 0 to 200, more preferably 0 to 80, especially preferably 10 to 80.<br>
In the so-called second embodiment of the invention, q is preferably 1 to 50, more preferably 2 to 20, and especially preferably 2 to 10.<br>
In the so-called second embodiment of the invention, r is preferably 0 to 100, and more preferably 0 to 50.<br>
In the so-called second embodiment of the invention, r is preferably 0 to 20 and more preferably 0 to 10.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds of the so-called second embodiment of the invention can be appropriately produced in that the siloxane derivatives that contain tertiary amino groups in the a,co position are produced via the hydrosilylation of unsaturated structures that bear tertiary amino groups with a,co Si-H functionalized siloxanes of the general structure<br><br>
wherein R and n have the meanings indicated above.<br>
The starting materials for the process are cc,« Si-H functionalized siloxanes of the general<br>
structure<br><br><br>
wherein R1 and n have the meanings indicated above. If they are not commercially available, these siloxanes can be produced via known methods, e.g. via equilibration (Silicone, Chemie und Technologie, Vulkan-Verlag, Essen 1989, pp 82-84). The subsequent introduction of tertiary amino functions can be achieved in two ways. First, it is possible to bind unsaturated structures that bear tertiary amino functions, such as N,N-dimethylallylamine, directly to the siloxane via hydrosilylation. This process is generally known (B. Marciniec, Comprehensive Handbook on Hydrosilylation, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1992, pp 122-124).<br>
Second, the siloxane derivatives that have tertiary amino groups in the a,co position, and the carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives of the alkylene oxides can be caused to react in a molar ratio of siloxane to carboxylic haloacid esters of 1 : 2.<br>
Preferably, the siloxane derivatives that have tertiary amino groups in the a,« position are converted in a two-stage process via the hydrosilylation of halogenated alkenes, unsaturated carboxylic haloacid esters, and epoxy-functional alkenes, with a,co Si-H functionalized siloxanes of the general structure<br><br>
wherein R1 and n have the meanings indicated above, and a subsequent alkylation of secondary compounds that bear amino functions from the group comprised of N,N-dialkylamines, cyclical secondary amines, amino amides that bear secondary amino functions, and secondary-tertiary diamines.<br>
Preferably, allyl chloride and allyl bromide are used as the halogenated alkenes.<br>
Those from the group comprised of chloroacetic allyl esters, chloroacetic acid propargyl esters, 3-chloropropionic acid allyl esters, and 3-chloropropionic acid propargyl esters are preferably used as the unsaturated carboxylic haloacid esters.<br><br><br>
-•Vinyl cyclohexene oxide and allyl glycide ether are preferably used as epoxy functional alkenes. Dimethylamine,   diethylamine,   dibutylamine,   diethanolamine,   and   N-methylglucamine   are preferably used as N, N-dialkyl amines.<br>
Morpholine and piperidine are preferably used as cyclical secondary amines.<br>
Conversion products from diethylene triamine or dipropylene triamine with lactones, preferably y-butyrolactone, gluconic acid-5-lactone, and glucopyranosylarabonic acid lactone are preferably used as amino amides bearing secondary amino functions.<br>
In other words, it is preferable to first generate reactive intermediate products via hydrosilylation, which can then be converted to tertiary amino structures in a subsequent step. Suitable starting materials for generating reactive intermediate stages include, for example, halogenated alkenes, preferably allyl chloride and allyl bromide, unsaturated carboxylic haloacid esters, preferably chloroacetic acid allyl ester, chloroacetic acid propargyl ester, 3-chloropropionic acid allyl ester, and 3-chloroproprionic acid propargyl ester, and epoxy-functional alkenes, such as vinylcyclohexene oxide and allylglycide ether. The general implementation of hydrosilylations using examples from the above-named groups of substances is also known (B. Marciniec, Comprehensive Handbook on Hydrosilylation, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1992, pp 116-121, 127-130,134-137, 151-155).<br>
In a subsequent step, the reactive intermediate stages can then be caused to react with compounds bearing secondary amino functions. Suitable representatives include N,N-dialkylamines, such as dimethylamine, diethylamine, dibutylamine, diethanolamine, and N-methylglucamine; cyclical secondary amines, such as morpholine and piperidine; amino amides that bear secondary amino functions, such as the conversion products of diethylene triamine or dipropylene triamine with lactones, such as y-butyrolactone, gluconic acid-5-lactone, and glucopyranosylarabonic acid lactone (DE-OS 4318536, Examples 11a, 12a, 13a) and secondary-tertiary diamines, such as N-methylpiperazine.<br>
When using secondary-tertiary diamines, then epoxide derivatives should preferably be used as partners in the reaction, as in this manner alkylations of the tertiary amino function can be excluded at no additional expense.<br><br><br><br>

The subsequent synthesis of the carboxylic haloacid esters is accomplished using known methods (Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 17th Edition, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1988, pp 402-408) via reaction with the C2-C4 halogen carboxylic acids, their anhydrides or acid chlorides. The selective synthesis of hydroxyl-functional carboxylic<br><br><br>
 aloacid esters, in which R4 stands for hydrogen, is accomplished via the addition of ethylene oxide and/or propylene oxide to the corresponding halogen carboxylic acids under acid conditions.<br>
The siloxane derivatives that have tertiary amino groups in the a,co position and the carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives of the alkylene oxides are preferably caused to react in a molar ratio of siloxane to the carboxylic haloacid ester of 1: 2. With this method, products in which the siloxane and alkylene oxide blocks are bonded to one another via quaternary ammonium functions are synthesized.<br>
With the purposeful introduction e.g. of adequately substituted piperazine rings, the synthesis regioselective products having one tertiary and one quaternary nitrogen atom in their polymeric structure can succeed. A surplus of carboxylic haloacid esters in this case leads to the start of quaternization of the remaining tertiary amino functions.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, a number of siloxane components and/or alkylene oxide derivatives, each of different chain lengths, can be caused to react with one another while retaining the desired overall stoichiometry. This results in the possibility of establishing a desired siloxane chain length by using a single siloxane component, or via a selective mixture of several siloxane components. Similarly, it is also possible to present an advantageous, average alkylene oxide block length in the form of a monomodal, bimodal, or polymodal distribution.<br>
Potential anions are the halogenide ions, preferably chloride ions that are formed during quaternization. However, other anions may also be introduced via ion exchange. Suitable examples for this include anions such as carboxylates, sulfonates, sulfates, polyether carboxylates, and polyether sulfates.<br>
The quaternization reactions are preferably run in polar organic solvents. Suitable solvents are, e.g. alcohols, especially methanol, ethanol, i-propanol, and n-butanol; glycols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, the methyl-, ethyl-, and butylethers of the above-named glycols, 1,2-propylene glycol, and 1,3-propylene glycol; ketones, such as acetone and methylethylketone; esters, such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and 2-ethyl-hexyl acetate; ethers, such as tetrahydrofurane; and nitro compounds, such as nitromethane.  The choice of solvent is<br><br><br>
 based essentially upon the solubility of the reaction partners and the desired reaction temperature.<br>
The reactions are conducted under temperatures ranging from 20° C to 130° C, preferably 40° C to 100° C.<br>

Thus for the syntheses of the compounds specified in the fourth embodiment of the invention, a,o&gt; Si-H functionalized siloxanes of the general structure<br><br>
are used, wherein R1 and n have the meanings indicated above. If they are not commercially available, these siloxanes can be produced via known methods, e.g. via equilibration (Silicone, Chemie und Technologie, Vulkan Verlag, Essen 1989, pp 82-84).<br>
The subsequent introduction of tertiary amino functions can, for example, be accomplished in two ways. On the one hand, it is possible to bind unsaturated structures containing tertiary amino functions, such as N,N-dimethylallylamine, directly to the siloxane via hydrosilylation. This process is generally known in the art and is described in B. Marciniec, Comprehensive Handbook on Hydrosilylation, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1992, pp 122-124.<br>
On the other hand, it is preferable to first generate reactive intermediate products via hydrosilylation, which can then be converted in a subsequent step into amino structures. Suitable starting materials for the generation of reactive intermediate stages include halogenated alkenes, preferably those from the group comprised of allyl chloride and allyl bromide; unsaturated carboxylic haloacid esters, preferably those from the group comprised of chloroacetic acid allylester, chloroacetic acid propargylester, 3-chloropropionic acid allylester, and 3-chloropropionic acid propargylester; and epoxy-functional alkenes, for example vinylcyclohexene oxide and allylglycide ether. The general process of hydrosilylation using representatives from the above-named groups of materials is also known in the art (B. Marciniec, Comprehensive Handbook on Hydrosilylation, Pergamon Press, Oxford 1992, pp 116-121, 127-130, 134-137, 151-155).<br>
In a subsequent step, the reactive intermediate stages can then be caused to react with compounds<br><br>
that contain secondary amino functions. Suitable representatives are N,N-dialkylamines, ^preferably those from the group comprised of dimethylamine, diethylamine, dibutylamine, diethanolamine, and N-methylglucamine, or cyclical secondary amines, such as morpholine and piperidine; amino amides that contain secondary amino functions, for example conversion products from diethylene triamine or dipropylene triamine with lactones, such as y-butyrolactone, gluconic acid-6-lactone, and glycopyranosylarabonic acid lactone (as described in DE-OS 4318536, in Examples 11a, 12a, and 13a) and secondary-tertiary diamines, such as N-methylpiperazine.<br>
When using secondary-tertiary diamines, epoxide derivatives should preferably be used as reaction partners, as in this manner alkylations of the tertiary amino functions can be excluded with no additional expenditure.<br>
The introduction of the alkylene oxide blocks is accomplished via the corresponding a,(o-carboxylic haloacid esters of the alkylene oxides. Preferred starting materials are low-molecular, oligomeric and polymeric alkylene oxides of the general composition<br>
HO[CH2CH20]q-[CH2CH(CH3)0]rH<br>
wherein q and r have the meanings indicated above. Preferred representatives are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, tetraethylene glycol, the oligoethylene glycols having molar weights of 300 to 1,000 g/mol, preferably having molar weights of approximately 400, 600, and 800 g/mol (400 to 800 g/mol), as well as dipropylene glycol.<br>
The esterification is accomplished in a known-in-the-art manner (Organikum, Organisch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 17th Edition, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1988, pp 402-408) via reaction with the C2 to C4 halogen carboxylic acids, their anhydrides, or acid chlorides.<br>
The siloxane derivatives that have tertiary amino groups in the a,co position and the a,o&gt; carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives of the alkylene oxides are preferably allowed to react in equimolar quantities. In this method, products can be synthesized in which the siloxane and alkylene oxide blocks are bonded to one another via quaternary ammonium functions.<br>
With the selective introduction, for example, of adequately substituted piperazine rings,<br><br><br>
rregioselective products that have one tertiary and one quaternary nitrogen atom in their polymer structure can be synthesized.<br>
A surplus of a,to carboxylic haloacid esters results in cross-linkage with a corresponding increase in viscosity, resulting from an initial quaternation of the remaining tertiary amino function,. A small surplus of a,<o-amino siloxane leads to a decrease in the degree of polymerization and thus corresponding viscosity.></o-amino>
It is within the scope of the invention to cause several siloxane components and/or alkylene oxide derivatives of varying chain lengths to react with one another, while at the same time maintaining the desired overall stoichiometric ratio. Hence the possibility exists, e.g., of establishing a desired siloxane chain length using a single siloxane component, or by purposefully mixing several siloxane<br>
components. Similarly, it is also possible to produce an advantageous, average alkylene oxide block length in the form of a monomodal, bimodal, or polymodal dispersion.<br>
As anions, the halogenide ions, especially chloride ions, formed during quatemization are preferably used. However, with ion exchange other anions may also be used. Possible examples of anions include those from include those from the group comprised of carboxylates, sulfonates, sulfates, polyether carboxylates and polyether sulfates.<br>
The quatemization reactions are preferably run in polar organic solvents. Suitable solvents are those from the group comprised of alcohols, glycols, ketones, esters, ethers, and nitro compounds. The choice of solvent is based essentially upon the solubility of the reaction partners and the desired reaction temperature.<br>
For the group of alcohols, methanol, ethanol, i-propanol and n-butanol are examples. For the group of glycols, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, the methyl-, ethyl-, and butylethers of the above-named glycols, 1,2-propylene glycol, and 1,3-propylene glycol are possible examples. The group of ketones includes e.g. acetone or methylethylketone. For the group of esters, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate and 2-ethyl-hexylacetate are adduced examples. The group of ethers includes tetrahydrofurane and other similar ethers. The group of nitromethanes includes those from the group of nitromethane or nitroethane.<br><br><br>
The reactions are run within a range of 20° C to 130° C, preferably 40° to 100° C.<br>

In a further preferred embodiment of the method for producing the polysiloxane compounds of the frfifth embodiment of the invention, the a,co carboxylic haloacid esters can be partially replaced by monofunctional carboxylic haloacid esters, while maintaining the overall stoichiometric ratio.<br>

Although the use of corresponding diamino derivatives is preferred, analogous trifunctional or monofunctional structures can also be partially used if a proportional cross-linking or even chain termination is intended. The portion of trifunctional, cross-linking or monofunctional, chain terminating amino derivatives amounts to a molar maximum of 10%, preferably 5%, and especially 1% of the content of the difunctional derivative. It is also within the scope of the above-described embodiment to replace the di-tertiary amine proportionally with monofunctional tertiary amines. The portion of amines also amounts to a molar maximum of 10%, preferably 5%, and especially 1% of the content of the di-tertiary amine. It is also within the scope of the invention to replace the a,© carboxylic haloacid esters with monofunctional carboxylic haloacid esters. The proportion of amines also amounts to a molar maximum of 10%, preferably 5%, especially preferably 1% of the content of a,co carboxylic haloacid esters.<br>
With respect to the reaction, it is within the scope of the invention to add the acids, which are used in producing the polysiloxane compounds, to the batches, above the amount needed for the quaternization of the tertiary amino groups, to the point of molar equivalence with all the remaining amino groups, following the removal of the amino groups that have been alkylated by the carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives. This means that the polysiloxane compounds specified in the invention may be present as free amines or as amine salts with respect to the structure of the amino groups.<br>
As described above, in a preferred variation of the embodiment, the species that contain the various amino groups may be added to the batch together with the carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives, if necessary with the simultaneous addition of equimolar quantities of acid. It is also<br><br><br>
within the scope of the invention, however, to cause first the epoxy derivatives, the carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives, and the di-tertiary amines to react in the presence of a quantity of acid that is equivalent to that of the epoxy groups, and then, if necessary, to add alkylene oxide derivatives that contain primary or secondary amino groups, if necessary with the addition of acids to the point of equivalence with the amino groups.<br>
It is likewise possible to bring the carboxylic haloacid ester derivatives and the di-tertiary amines to react, forming hydrophilic blocks, and afterwards to add the epoxy derivatives, if necessary adding alkylene oxide derivatives that contain primary or secondary amino groups, in the presence of a quantity of acid that is equivalent to that of the epoxy groups to the reaction mixture.<br>
During the time in which the individual components are being added, the sequential distribution in the polymers being formed can be influenced.<br>
It is further within the scope of the invention to cause several siloxane components and/or alkylene oxide derivatives of various chain lengths to react, while maintaining the desired overall stoichiometry. From this, there follows, e.g., the possibility of creating a desired siloxane chain length by using a single siloxane component or by the purposeful mixture of several siloxane components. Analogously, it is possible to prepare an advantageous average alkylene oxide block length in the form of a monomodal, bimodal, or polymodal dispersion. Further, a desired share of alkylene oxides can be distributed variably between the carboxylic haloacid ester components and the amino components.<br>
The quaternization and alkylation reactions are preferably run in polar organic solvents. Suitable solvents are, e.g., alcohols, especially methanol, ethanol, i-propanol and n-butanol; glycols, such as ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, the methyl-, ethyl- and butyl ethers of the above-named glycols, 1,2-propylene glycol and 1,3-propylene glycol; ketones, such as acetone and methylethylketone; esters, such as ethylacetate, butylacetate and 2-ethyl-hexylacetate; ethers, such as tetrahydrofurane; and nitro compounds, such as nitromethane. The choice of solvents is based essentially upon the solubility of the reaction partners and the desired reaction temperature.<br>
The reactions are preferably run within a range of 20° C to 150° C, especially 40° C to 100° C.<br>
The invention further relates to the use of the above-described polysiloxane compounds in cosmetic formulations for skin and hair care, in polishing agents for treating and coating hard surfaces, in formulations for drying automobiles and other hard surfaces, for example following automatic washing, for finishing textiles and textile fibers, as separate softeners for use after textiles have been washed with non-ionogenic or anionic/non-ionogenic detergent formulations, as<br><br><br>
sorteners in formulations for washing textiles that are based upon non-ionic or anionic/non-ionic  eurfactants, and as means for preventing or removing wrinkles in textiles.<br>

Polysiloxane Compound Examples:<br>
The following examples are intended to describe the present invention in greater detail, without limiting its scope.<br>
Example 1 (First Embodiment of the Invention)<br>
la) 205.3 g (0.5 mol) of a molar-mass distributed polyether having the average structure CH2=CHCH2(OCH2CH2)80H were placed under nitrogen at room temperature. Within 30 minutes, 63.4 g (0.55 mol) chloroacetic acid chloride were added dropwise, under intense stirring. During the dropwise addition, the temperature increased to 67° C, and an intensive formation of HC1 set in. Upon completion of the dropwise addition, the batch was heated to 120° C for 40 minutes. Finally all constituents boiling at up to 120° C and 20 hPa were then removed via distillation. 243.6 g of a yellow, viscous liquid of the composition<br>
CH2=CHCH2(OCH2CH2)8OC(0)CH2Cl<br>
were obtained. It was determined using gas chromatography that neither chloroacetic acid chloride, chloroacetic acid, nor the OH-terminated oligoethylene glycols are present in the reaction product.<br>
lb) 58.4 g (6*102 mol) of the chloroacetic acid ester from la) and 0.43 g of a solution of hexachloroplatinic acid containing 2.63 % platinum in 2-propanol were heated to 130° under<br><br>
PCT/EPO1/08699<br>
nitrogen.  Within 1.5 hours, 155.3 g (1.2*10 ' mol) of a a,o-SiH functionalized siloxane of the 'average composition<br><br><br><br>
were added dropwise. After another 8 hours at 130° C, the reaction was terminated and a reaction conversion of 97% was established using SiH-determination. Over the course of the hydrosilylation reaction, a clear solution of 186 g of a yellow oil having the structure<br><br><br><br>
was obtained from the initially cloudy, two-phase system.<br>
lc) 57 g (1.6*10"2 mol) of the chloroacetic acid ester derivative from lb) were dissolved in 100 ml 2-propanol at room temperature. 1.86 g (1.6*102 mol) dimethylpiperazine was then added. The batch was heated to reflux temperature for 6 hours, after which all constituents boiling at up to 90° C and 1.2 hPa were removed via distillation. The reaction yielded 54 g of a gray product having the structure<br><br><br><br>
which was present first as a syrupy mass, which then crystallized over the course of 24 hours. Immediately upon termination of the reaction, and prior to the removal of the evaporable constituents., gas chromatography showed no more dimethylpiperazine.<br><br>

Example 12 (Fifth Embodiment of the Invention) and Comparison Example<br>
To test for suitability as a wash-resistant, hydrophilic softener, white cotton jersey was subjected to the treatment described below with a formulation based upon the quaternary ammonium salt from Example 11. For purposes of comparison, a commercially available hydrophilic softener was used. First, the following base formulations were established:<br><br><br><br>
20 g of these base formulations were dissolved in 980 g distilled water. Then, with these formulations that effectively contain 0.35% or 0.4% siloxane agent, pieces of cotton jersey measuring 60 cm x 90 cm and weighing 87 g were treated using the Foulard process. The cotton material is dipped completely in the given formulation for 5 seconds, and following the single application, the pieces are dried at 120° C for 3 minutes.<br>
The pieces of cloth are then separated, with one half being subjected to five machine washing cycles in the presence of a light-duty detergent (1.7 g detergent/liter of wash water). Each wash cycle lasts 25 minutes, the wash temperature is 40° C.<br>
The hydrophilism (ability to absorb a drop of water in seconds) of the unwashed and washed textile pieces was determined, after which 5 test subjects evaluate the feel of the cloth to the touch.<br><br><br><br>
The results show that the textile treated as specified in the invention retains the desired property combination of hydrophilism, expressed by a very short drop absorption time, and the feel to the touch that is typical of silicone.<br>
Example 13 (Fifth Embodiment of the Invention)<br>
To test for softening properties as an internal softener during the washing process, bleached strips of cotton, the surface of which was not treated in any other way, were subjected to a washing process in the presence of Ariel Futur®, Dash 2 in 1® containing bentonite, and the silicone quaternary compound described in Example 11. The following boundary conditions were maintained.<br><br>
The water is heated to 60° C, the detergents, and in the case of cotton strip 1 the silicone quaternary compound from Example 1, are dissolved in the water. The cotton strips are then washed in these solutions for 30 minutes. Afterward, the strips are rinsed in 5x600 ml water, and dried for 30 minutes at 120° C.<br>
16 test subjects evaluated the three cotton strips for softness to the touch, and assigned each a rating, with 1 indicating the softest strip and 3 indicating the roughest strip.<br>
The results of the evaluation gave cotton strip 1 an average rating of 1.4. The cotton strip 2 was given an average rating of 2.8, and the strip 3, which was treated with bentonite, received an average rating of 1.8.<br>
The polysiloxane compounds specified in the invention exhibit excellent wash-resistance and substantivity.<br><br><br>
  EP-A-282720, for example, the use of polyquatemary polysiloxanes in cosmetic formulations, especially for hair care, is described, and improved combability, a good shine, high antistatic effectiveness, and improved rinsability are generally named as the advantages.<br>
The last mentioned characteristic, however, cannot be equated with wash resistance. While the rinsability of hair is based upon a brief onslaught main of water and very mild surfactants that will not irritate the skin, wash-resistant, hydrophilic softeners for textiles must withstand the effects of concentrated surfactant solutions having high fat and dirt dissolving power. In modern detergents, highly alkaline complexing agents, oxidative bleaching agents, and complex enzyme systems are added to these surfactant systems. The exposure frequently takes place over a period of hours at increased temperatures. For these reasons, a transfer of observations from the field of cosmetics to the field of wash-resistant fabric softeners is not possible. DE-OS 3236466, cited in the state of the art, points out that to create a wash-resistant fabric treatment, the orientation should be toward cross-linkable systems.<br>
Similarly, it was not expected that the compounds specified in the invention would be effective as softeners in formulations for washing fibers and textiles based upon non-ionic or anionic/non-ionic surfactants. In these cases as well, the effect of the aggressive detergent formulations takes place over long periods of time at increased temperatures. This is aggravated by the fact that the original modification of the fiber surface with softening substances is eliminated.<br><br>
