				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to multilayer materials comprising a solid support and at least two superposed solid layers which contain particles of an electrochemically active material. These multilayer materials are characterized in particular by a low interpenetration between adjacent solid layers.<br>
The present invention also relates to processes for forming the multilayer materials of the invention, especially those which include a step of coating a mixture comprising particles of electrochemically active materials.<br>
The present invention also relates to the multilayer electrodes obtained by the process of the invention, these having remarkable mechanical and electrochemical properties.<br>
Finally, the present invention relates to the electrochemical generators that incorporate at least one electrode based on a multilayer material of the invention and are characterized by exceptional safety. These generators are particularly suitable for use in portable electronic systems and in hybrid vehicles, especially thanks to a high resistance in the presence of an overcharge.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The advantage of double-layer electrodes has recently been indicated by Naoki Imachi et al., during the 46th symposium on batteries that was held from 16 to 18 November 2005 in Nagoya, Japan, summary on pages 168 to 169, published in the Proceedings, mentioning that a double-layer cathode, the first layer of which is based on LiFePO4, the second layer of which is based on<br>
LiCoO2 acting as active material and the collector of which consists of an aluminum foil, has an effect on the overcharge tolerance based on the change in resistance of Li1-xFePO4 with respect to x. This LiFePO4/LiCoO2-based double-layer cathode, although having achieved a certain progress, was shown to be of limited interest.<br>
There therefore was a need to develop electrode materials devoid of at least one of the drawbacks of the known materials and offering in particular a good overcharge resistance.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the term "multilayer electrode" is likened to an electrode characterized by a superposition of at least two layers on its surface.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the "thickness constancy of a layer" was measured using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) method. In the case of the present invention, the SEM used was a HITACHI S-3500N with an integrated computer. The apparatus was provided with a program giving the thickness measurement for each linear millimeter of the specimen. The values obtained were exploited using the Excel® program, these being presented in the form of two-dimensional curves: length of the specimen and thicknesses measured over each millimeter of the segment. The constancy was determined by measuring the deviations between the average value of the specimen thickness and the extreme values measured. Thus, an average specimen thickness of 40 microns constant to 95% means that the average thickness varied between 38 and 42 microns.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the "average depth of penetration of a layer into another" was measured using the scanning electron microscope (SEM) method, and represents the statistical average of the penetrations measured every linear millimeter of the specimen.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the term "coating" represents a method of overlaying a support with an electrode.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the function of a binder is to chemically bind the particles of an electrochemically active material that are present in a solution and also when they are present in the solid layer.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the function of a thickener is to increase the viscosity of the solution of the mixture to be coated, said solution containing particles of an electrochemically active material, the binder and the solvent.<br>
All kinds of binders can be used. Those described in international application PCT/CA03/01739 and in the corresponding European application bearing the number   EP   1,573,834   (HYDRO-QUEBEC),   the   contents   of   which   are<br>
incorporated by reference in the present application, are particularly advantageous within the context of the formation of multilayer structures of the invention, and more particularly within the context of the techniques for forming solid layers by coating using at least one aqueous mixture of an electrochemically active material.<br>
Preferably, the binder and the thickener used are generally soluble to at least 20% in water when they are introduced, at room temperature, in an amount of 20 grams in 100 grams of water. Preferably, they are soluble to at least 50% and more advantageously still to at least 90%.<br>
Even more advantageously, the thickener is soluble in water and may be chosen from the group formed by natural celluloses, physically and/or chemically modified celluloses, natural polysaccharides and chemically and/or physically modified polysaccharides, these having a molecular weight of between 27 000 and 250 000.<br>

According to a preferred embodiment, the thickener is chosen from the group consisting of the carboxymethylcelluloses of Cellogen® type that are sold by the company Dai-lchi Kogyo Seiaku Co. Ltd in Japan, especially under the brand names EP, 7A, WSC, BS-H and 3H.<br>
The soluble binder is advantageously selected from the group formed by natural and/or synthetic rubbers.<br>
The binder is of the nonfluorinated type or weakly fluorinated type. To give an example, since LiF is insoluble in water, it cannot be used within the context of the invention.<br>
Among rubbers, those of synthetic type, and more particularly those chosen from the group formed by SBR (Styrene Butadiene Rubber), NBR (butadiene-acrylonitrile rubber), HNBR (hydrogenated NBR), CHR (epichlorohydrin rubber) and ACM (acrylate rubber), are particularly advantageous.<br>
The soluble rubbers used, and especially those of the SBR family, are preferably in the form of a paste.<br>
To give an example, mention may be made of the SBR sold by the company NIPPON ZEON'S BINDER BATTERY GRADE under the brand name {BM-400B) or equivalent, and the thickeners of the Cellogen® type known by the abbreviations EP and/or 3H.<br>
Usually, the thickener/binder ratio varies from 10 to 70%, preferably from 30 to 50%. The binder content is advantageously between 1 and 70% and that of the thickener between 1 and 10%, in an aqueous solution.<br>
If PVDF is used as binder, its content is 3 to 40% and that of the active material is 60 to 97%.<br>
An aqueous solution particularly suitable for coating on an anode support may be formulated as follows, the percentages being by weight:<br>
-	at least 64% graphite; and<br>
-	at least 3% water-soluble binder;<br>
-	0.1 to 2% thickener; and<br>

-	at least 3% water-soluble binder;<br>
-	0.1 to 2% thickener; and<br>
-	at most 27% water.<br>
When implementing the process, the electrode is dried by removing, preferably to at least 95%, the water present in the solution used to carry out the coating step.<br>
Various techniques known to those skilled in the art in question can be used to remove the traces of H2O present on the surface of the electrode, after the latter has been covered with the aqueous solution. These traces are in particular removed thermally, in line with the EXT, DBH and/or DB process or by infrared at a temperature of advantageously between 80 and 130°C for a time of between 1 and 12 hours.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the term "collector" is likened to an electrode support that is electrochemically inactive but electronically conductive.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the term "doctor blade" represents a coating method in vertical mode.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the term "extrusion" represents a particular coating method in which the mixture to be coated is passed under pressure through a die so as to speed up the coating process.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the term "calendering" represents the pressing of the electrodes so as to obtain an optimum electrode density, which is expressed in grams per cm3.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, as regards the pH of the particles of electrochemically active materials (EAM), the pH of an EAM represents the measured value, using a conventional glass electrode, in a solution of the EAM<br>
obtained by dissolving, under standard temperature and pressure conditions, 0.15 grams of the EAM in 10 cc of water. The solution is left for one week under standard temperature conditions and then stirred just before taking the measurement with an OAKTON Series 2100 apparatus, sold by the company OAKTON. Within the context of the present invention, any specimen having a pH below 7 is referred to as an acid EAM while any specimen having a pH above 7 is referred to as a basic EAM.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the "physical techniques" comprise techniques such as plasma deposition deposition, evaporation, sputtering and all similar techniques well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Within the context of this disclosure, the "chemical techniques" comprise those such as CVD (Chemical Vapor Deposition) and spin coating.<br>
The formation of a multilayer material of the (PVDF/WSB) or (WSB/PVDF) type, where WSE3 stands for Water-Soluble Binder, and the use of a hybrid binder in a multilayer cathode or anode will be explained below.<br>
One particularly advantageous method of implementing the invention lies in a multilayer coating process using two binders having different chemistries: one being based on a nonaqueous system and the other based on an aqueous system.<br>
Cathode - The cathode consists of a minimum of two layers of active materials, A and B respectively, as described in figure 1.<br>
In case I, the layer A is of the LiFePCv type with a water-soluble binder. The thickness of the layer A may be greater or less than that of the layer B. The coating to form the cathode A is 100% water-based. The cathode B consists of LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiNi02, LiMn-1/3Co1/3Ni1/3O2 or of a mixture of at least two of the latter. The binder used for the layer B is based on PVDF or PTFE. The<br>
thickness of this layer B may be greater or less than the layer A. The solvent used for the coating to form the layer B is organic, preferably of the NMP or cyclopentanone type.<br>
Because different coating solvents are used in the layers A and B, the binder of the inner layer A is not dissolved by the solvent for the outer layer B. In addition, it provides the layer A with mechanical and chemical stability (figure 1), particularly owing to the fact that the binder is not soluble in the solvent used for forming the second layer.<br>
In case II, the layer A' is of the LiFePO4 type, and a binder of the PVDF or PTFE type soluble in a solvent of the NMP or cyclopentanone type is used. The thickness of the layer A' may be greater or less than that of the layer B'. The layer B' consists of LiCoO2, LiMn2O4, LiNiO2, LiMn1/3Co1/3Ni1/3O2 or of a mixture thereof. The binder used for the coating to form the layer B is based on water and the solvent used consists of 100% water. The thickness of this layer B' may be greater or less than the layer A' (figure 2).<br>
The manufacturing process is carried out using the doctor blade technique or by extrusion on an aluminum collector. The first layer is coated onto the aluminum collector, while the second layer is coated onto the first layer without significant dissolution or deformation of the inner layer A or A'.<br>
Other coating processes may be used, such as vertical coating on an aluminum (expanded metal) mesh. The first layer A or A' is coated onto the aluminum mesh and the second layer B or B' is extended over the first layer A or A' without significant dissolution or deformation of the inner layer A or A'.<br>
In case III, in another advantageous embodiment of the invention, the two layers are formed from the same binder and the same solvent. The first layer A is coated onto the aluminum collector. The layer B is coated onto a polypropylene (PP). Immediately afterwards, the layer B is transferred onto the<br>
layer A by lamination. The two layers are formed from PVDF or PTFE dissolved in NMP or in cyclopentanone.<br>
In a second case, the two layers are formed from a water-soluble binder and the solvent used consists of 100% water (figure 3).<br>
In both configurations, the thickness of the layer A may be greater or less than that of the layer B.<br>
Other coating processes may be used, such as vertical coating on a copper (expanded metal) mesh. The first layer A is coated onto a copper film. The second layer B is extended over a PP film. The latter layer B is then transferred onto the first layer A by lamination without any deformation of the inner layer A.<br>
Anode<br>
In case I, the first layer A is of the natural or artificial graphite type and the binder is of the water-soluble type. The solvent used for the coating to form the layer A consists of 100% water. The thickness of this layer A may be greater or less than the layer B. The layer B is composed of hard carbon, Li4Ti5Oi2, Sn, Al, Ag, Si, SiOx, SiOx-graphite or SiOx-carbon, with x greater than 0 but not exceeding 2. The binder used in this layer B is of the PVDF or PTFE type and the solvent used is of the NMP or cyclopentanone type (figure 1).<br>
In case II, the layer A' is of the natural or artificial graphite type used with a binder of the PVDF or PTFE type soluble in a solvent of the NMP or cyclopentanone type. The thickness of the layer A' may be greater or less than that of the layer B'.<br>
The layer B' is composed of hard carbon, Li4Ti5Oi2, Sn, Al, Ag, Si, SiOx, SiOx-graphite or SiOx-carbon or the like, with x greater than 0 but not exceeding 2. The binder used in this layer B' is water-based and the solvent used consists of<br>
100% water. The thickness of this layer B' may be greater or less than the layer A'.<br>
The multilayer anode is manufactured using the doctor blade technique or by extrusion on a copper collector. The first layer is coated onto the copper collector and the second layer B or B' is coated onto the first layer without any dissolution or deformation of the inner layer A or A'.<br>
Other coating processes may advantageously be used, namely vertical coating on a copper (expanded metal) mesh. The first layer A or A' is coated onto the copper mesh and the second layer B or B' is extended over the first layer A or A' without any significant dissolution or deformation of the inner layer A or A'.<br>
In case III, in another preferred embodiment of the invention, the two layers are formed from the same binder and the same solvent. The first layer A is coated onto the copper collector. The layer B is coated onto a polypropylene (PP). Immediately afterwards, the layer B is transferred onto the layer A by lamination. The two layers are formed from PVDF or PTFE dissolved in NMP or in cyclopentanone.<br>
In a second case, both layers are formed from the water-soluble binder and the solvent used is 100% water.<br>
In both configurations, the thickness of the layer A may be greater or less than that of the layer B.<br>
Other coating processes may be used, such as vertical coating on a copper (expanded metal) mesh. The first layer A is coated onto a copper film. The second layer B is extended over a PP film. The latter layer B is then transferred onto the first layer A by lamination, without any deformation of the inner layer A.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment, at least one of the layers of<br>
the anode or cathode is deposited by physical techniques such as plasma deposition, evaporation or sputtering, or by chemical techniques such as CVD or spin coating, or any other technique (figure 5).<br>
According to another preferred variant of the invention, the particles of the cathode multilayer material (LiGoO2, LiMn2O4) LiMn1/3Co1/3Ni1/3O2) are coated with the LiFePO4 material using techniques of the mechanofusion, plasma deposition, evaporation or sputtering type, or chemical techniques such as CVD, spin coating or other equivalent techniques.<br>
Likewise, the anode material (natural or artificial graphite or carbon) is advantageously coated with one of the components: Li4Ti5Oi2, Sn, Al, Ag, or Si or a mixture of at least two of the latter.<br>
These coated materials are used to manufacture the cathode or the anode with a binder either of the PVDF or PTFE type or with a water-soluble binder.<br>

One of the key advantages of the multilayer materials of the invention lies in the improved overcharge resistance that they give generators into which they are incorporated as constituent electrode element.<br>
In the presence of overcharging caused by external agents, the cathode of the generator becomes very acidic and reacts with the electrolyte, in particles with the salt, to form acids of the HF(LiPF6) or HCI(LiCIO4) type. These formation reactions are exothermic, generate oxygen from LiCoO2 and contribute to raising the temperature of the generator considerably. The acids vaporize and react with the battery components, up to the point of starting a fire inside the generator.<br>
Using cathodes of the LiFePO4 type, or very basic pH cathodes, makes the battery considerably safer, in particular by avoiding acid formation and preventing oxygen generation.<br>
Another option for further optimizing the overcharge-resistance capability lies in coating the particles of electrochemically active material with a layer of a highly basic material, such as LiO4 or the like. In particular, this prevents acid from the cathode coming into contact with the electrolyte during the charge.<br>
It is particularly advantageous to use, as particles of electrochemically active material, those having a pH greater than 7, such as LiFePO4 particles having a pH of 9.9 and LiCoO2 particles having a pH of 8.6.<br>
The two possible mechanisms for minimizing or even inhibiting the undesirable<br>
overcharge phenomenon are shown in figures 1 to 4 and 6 and 7.<br>
