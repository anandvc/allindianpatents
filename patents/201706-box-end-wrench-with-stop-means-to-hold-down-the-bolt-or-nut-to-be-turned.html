				<td>BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to box end wrenches, and more particularly to such a box end wrench which has stop means adapted for holding down the bolt or nut to be turned.<br>
Box end wrenches of the prior art have been described hereinafter.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a box end wrench with stop means to hold down the bolt or nut to be turned, comprising a first box end at one end, said first box end defining a box and a plurality of internal angles within said box, wherein an annular groove is formed internally around said box, and split binding ring is mounted in said annular groove and disposed at said internal angles, and is adapted for securing said first box end to the bolt or nut to be turned with said first box end, and for preventing said first box end from escaping out of the bolt or nut to be turned.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view showing a box end of a box end wrench mounted on a bolt according to the prior art.<br>
-2-<br><br>

Figure 3  is a top view of a part of a wrench with a stop ball according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 4 is a top view of a part of a wrench with a sliding stop plate according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 5 is a side view of Figure 3. Figure 6 is a side view of Figure 4.<br>
Figure 7 is an exploded view of a box end of a wrench according to the present invention, showing the relationship between the split binding ring and the box.<br>
Figure 8 is a sectional view showing a split binding ring mounted in an annular groove inside a box of a box end of a wrench according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 9 is an elevational view of a wrench according to one    embodiment   of   the   present   invention,   showing   smoothly<br>
3<br><br>
curved raised portions disposed at internal angles of the box of the box end of the wrench.<br>
Figure 10 is a sectional view in an enlarged scale of the box end of the wrench shown in Figure 9.<br>
Figure 11 is a top plain view showing the split binding ring of box end forced into engagement with the bolt according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 12 is a top plain view showing the smoothed curved raised portions of the box end forced into engagement with the bolt according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 13 is an elevational view of a wrench according to another embodiment of the present invention, showing a split binding ring mounted in the box of the box end of the wrench.<br>
Figure 14 is an elevational view of a ratchet box end wrench according to still another embodiment of the present invention, showing a split binding ring mounted in one box end of the wrench, and smoothly curved raised portions formed on the other box end of the wrench at its internal angles.<br>
4<br><br>
Figure   15   is   an   elevational   view  of a   box  end   wrench according  to  still   another  embodiment  of the  present  invention, showing a split binding ring mounted in one box end of the wrench, and smoothly curved raised portions formed on the other box end of the wrench at its internal angles.<br>
Figure 16 is a sectional view of a socket for socket wrench according to the present invention, showing a split binding ring mounted inside the socket.<br>
5<br><br>
A box end of a box end wrench or ratchet box end wrench or a socket for socket wrench, has  a plurality of internal  angles (the number of the internal angles can be 4, 6, 8, 12, 16 or 20) by which the box end can be positively attached to the bolt or nut to be turned (see Figures  1  and 2)..     However, when the wrench  is turned, the box end of the wrench may slip from the bolt or nut, causing   the   bolt   or   the   nut   unable   to   be   turned   positively. Figures 3 and 5 show a wrench having a spring-supported stop ball suspended above the box of the box end and adapted for stopping the  wrench   from   escaping   out  of the  bolt  or  nut  to  be  turned. However,   this   arrangement   is   still   not   satisfactory   in   function, because the stop ball wears quickly with use, and the spring force of the spring which supports the stop ball tends to be surpassed by the turning force applied to the wrench.     Figure 4 and 6 show a wrench having a sliding stop plate retractably suspended above the box  of the  box  end  and  adapted  for  stopping  the  wrench   from escaping   out   of the   bolt   or   nut   to   be   turned.      However,   the arrangement of the sliding stop plate limits the maximum turning angle of each turning step of the wrench.<br>
6<br><br>
Referring to Figures 7, 8, 11 and 13, a box 5 I of a box end of a wrench 5 comprises an annular groove 510 around the inside wall, and a split binding ring 52 mounted in the annular groove 510 and disposed at internal angles thereof. When the box 51 of the wrench 5 is attached to the bolt (nut) to be turned, the split binding ring 52 is forced into engagement with the bolt (nut) to stop the box end of the wrench 5 from escaping out of the bolt (nut).<br>
Referring to figures 9, 10 and 12, the box 51  comprises a plurality   of   smoothly   curved   raised   portions   53    respectively<br>
7<br><br>
disposed at the internal angles thereof adapted for stopping the box from escaping out of the bolt (nut) to be turned. The raised portions 53 are made on the box 51 of the wrench 5 in integrity by stamping.<br>
The present invention can be employed to a ratchet box end wrench 6 (see Figure 14), a box end wrench 7 (see Figure 15), or a socket for socket wrench 8. The number of the internal angles of the box of the box end wrench or the socket for socket wrench can be 4, 6, 8, 16 or 20.<br>
In Figures 14 and 15, the box wrench 6 or 7 has one box mounted with a split binding ring 52, and the other box made with smoothly curved raised portions 53. In Figure 13, the wrench has one end terminating in a box end mounted with a split binding ring 52, and an opposite end terminating in an open end.<br>
8<br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
9<br>
1. A box end wrench (5) with stop means to hold down the bolt or nut to be<br>
turned, comprising a first box end at one end, said first box end defining a box (51) and a<br>
plurality of internal angles within said box (51). wherein an annular groove (510) is<br>
formed internally around said box (51), and split   binding ring (52) is mounted in said<br>
annular groove (510) and disposed at said internal angles, and is adapted for securing<br>
said first box end to the bolt or nut to be turned with said first box end, and for<br>
preventing said first box end from escaping out of the bolt or nut to be turned.<br>
2. A box end wrench as claimed in claim 1, wherein a second box end is<br>
formed at an opposite end of the wrench, said second box end having a plurality of<br>
smoothly curved raised portions (53) respectively disposed at internal angles thereof and<br>
adapted for securing said second box end to the bolt or nut to be turned with said second<br>
box end, and for preventing said second box end from escaping out of the bolt or nut to<br>
be turned.<br>
3. A box end wrench with stop means to hold down the bolt or nut to be<br>
turned, substantially as herein described, particularly with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
"BOX END WRENCH WITH STOP MEANS TO HOLD DOWN THE BOLT OR NUT TO BE TURNED"<br>
There is disclosed a box end wrench with stop means to hold down the bolt or nut to be turned, comprising a first box end at one end, said first box end defining a box and a plurality of internal angles within said box, wherein an annular groove is formed internally around said box, and split binding ring is mounted in said annular groove and disposed at said internal angles, and is adapted for securing said first box end to the bolt or nut to be turned with said first box end, and for preventing said first box end from escaping out of the bolt or nut to be turned.<br></td>
