C-14 OXIDATION OF MORPHINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The invention relates to a process for the production of 14-hydroxynormorphinone derivatives, to a new synthetic route for producing noroxymorphone, as well as to new intermediates in said route.<br>
Noroxymorphone is a key intermediate for the production of important medicinal opioids, such as naltrexone and naloxone. The common starting material for the production of these opioids is thebaine from which they are readily synthesized. However, thebaine has only a low natural abundance in poppy heads and opium. As the supply of thebaine is limited and the demand is increasing, many alternative approaches have been made for the preparation of 14-hydroxymorphine derivatives. See for example EP 0,158,476, US 5,922,876, and the references cited therein.<br>
Further, in an attempt to remove the requirement for (the preparation of) thebaine, Coop et al. (Tetrahedron 55 (1999), 11429-11436; WO 00/66588) recently described an oxidative method for the production of 14-hydroxycodeinone in a yield of 51% from codeinone, using Co(OAc)3 as the metallic oxidant in acetic acid at room temperature. Other oxidative conditions with metallic oxidants, such as Co(OAc)3 under other conditions, FeCfe, Co(OAc)2 in combination with several cooxidants, R.UO4, Mn(OAc)3, Cu(OAc)2, and others, proved to be not very useful according to Coop.<br>
Surprisingly, and in spite of the findings of Coop, it has now been found that in the production of 14-hydroxynormorphinone derivatives of formula IV from compounds of formula III cobalt (II) salts can be used as efficient oxidants when the reaction is performed in the presence of a mild " base and oxygen or air is used as cooxidant. Therefore, the invention relates to a process for the preparation of a 14-hydroxynormorphinone derivative of formula IV<br><br><br><br>
with a cobalt (II) oxidant in the presence of a mild base and air or oxygen as the cooxidant; wherein R1 is (l-7C)alkyl optionally substituted with one or more chlorines (such as 1,1,1-trichloroethyl), butenyl, vinyl, benzyl, phenyl or naphthyl;<br>
and R2 is benzyl or benzyl substituted with one or more (l-6C)alkoxy group or benzyl substituted with one or more halogen.<br>
The oxidation process of the present invention is an efficient process with good yields, which are significantly improved when compared to the process described by Coop et al..<br>
The cobalt (II) oxidant according to the present invention may be selected from a range of cobalt<br>
(II)   salts,   such   as   CoF2,   COCI2,   CoBr2s   Co(II)sulfete,   Co(H)nitrate,   Co(n)acetate,<br>
Co(II)propionate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The preferred oxidant in the process of this<br>
invention is Co(OAc)2 and the preferred cooxidant is air. The reaction mixture of this oxidation<br>
process is a heterogeneous system; the oxidant dissolves only in minor amounts in the organic   .<br>
solvent that is used. The amount of cobalt (II) salts used is not very critical, as long as the<br>
system is heterogeneous, and a skilled person will know to choose sufficient amounts thereof.<br>
The cooxidant is introduced into the reaction mixture by bubbling it through the solution, while<br>
stirring.<br>
A person skilled in the art is aware what type of base are meant with the term mild bases,<br>
however preferred bases are sodium acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate and<br>
potassium phosphate. Most preferred is sodium acetate.<br>
Preferably R1 is (l-7C)alkyl, and most preferred is ethyl. For R2 benzyl is most preferred.<br>
The oxidation process according to the present invention is performed in an organic solvent<br>
well-suited for dissolution of this type of compounds, preferably (l-4C)alcohols or mixtures<br>
thereof. Preferred is ethanol.<br><br>
The reaction temperature is usually higher than room temperature, and may be chosen dependent on the boiling point of the solvent used. However, the temperature may not be higher than about 100 °C in order to keep the oxygen sufficiently in solution.<br>
In the terms (l-7C)alkyl, (l-6C)alkoxy and (l-4C)alcohols the alkyl group is a branched or unbranched alkyl group having 1 to 7, 1 to 6 or 1 to 4 carbon atoms, respectively, such as methyl, ethyl, isopropyl, t-butyl, heptyl and the like.<br>
The compound of formula III may suitably prepared by methods well known in the art. Preferably, the process for the preparation of a compound of formula HI comprises reactively contacting a morphine derivative of formula II<br><br>
with an oxidizing agent effective for oxidizing allylic hydroxy groups to form keto groups, where a morphinone compound of the formula III is prepared. Preferably, the oxidizing agent is sodium dichromate. Preferably R1 is ethyl. For R2 benzyl is most preferred.<br>
The new process of this invention may conveniently be used in the production of noroxymorphone. Therefore, another aspect of this invention is a process for the production of noroxymorphone, comprising a reaction step wherein a morphinone compound of formula III is oxidized into the 14-hydroxynormorphinone derivative of formula IV. In particular preferred is the process further comprising the oxidation of a morphine derivative of formula II into the compound of formula III as described above.<br>
Especially preferred is a process for the production of noroxymorphone comprising the steps: (a) converting morphine having the formula I<br><br><br>
by reaction with a haloformate ester of the formula X-C(-O)OR1, wherein R1 is as previously defined and X is a halogen (F, CI, Br or I, preferably Cl)9<br>
followed by a reaction with R2-X, wherein X (preferably CI) and R2 are as previously defined, to form a morphine derivative of formula II;<br>
(b)	oxidizing the morphine of formula II to form a morphinone derivative of formula III according to the previously described process;<br>
(c)	oxidizing the morphinone derivative of formula HI to form a 14-hydroxynormorphinone derivative of formula IV according to the previously described process;<br>
(d)	deprotecting the 3-position and (at the same time) reducing the double bond at the 7,8-position of the 14-hydroxynormorphinone derivative of formula IV to form a 3,14-hydroxynormorphinone derivative of formula V, using methods well known in the art for such type of reaction, e.g. using hydrogen and palladium-carbon as a catalyst,<br><br>
(e)	and hydrolyzing the 3,14-hydroxynormorphinone derivative of formula V into<br>
noroxymorphone of formula VI, using methods well known in the art for such type of<br>
hydrolysis, e.g. using sulfuric acid,<br><br>
In the process for the production of noroxymorphone, the novel intermediates of formula II, in and IV form each another aspect of the present invention. The intermediates of formula II, III<br><br>
and IV are in particular preferred wherein R1 is ethyl. Also preferred are intermediates of formula II, in and IV wherein R2 is benzyl. Most preferred are the intermediates of formula II, III and IV wherein Ri is ethyl and R2 is benzyl.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following example.<br>
