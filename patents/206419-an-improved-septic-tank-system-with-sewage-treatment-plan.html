				<td>This invention relates to a manufacturing, installation of septic tank and more particularly to an improved septic tank system with sewage treatment plan.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Louis Mouras of Vesoul, France, was given a patent in 1881 and credited with the invention! Baffles, which regulate the flow, were added in 1905 to make the septic tank more efficient. The first baffles were made of oak boards.<br>
At the turn of the century, there were some very large community septic tanks. In 1903, four community tanks were constructed in Saratoga, New York, with a total capacity of one million gallons.<br>
By 1920, septic tanks began to be a common feature. After World War II, septic tanks became important to housing developments in unsewered areas.<br>
Raw waste water from the bathroom, kitchen and laundry room flows into the tank where the solids separate from the liquid. Light solids, such as soap suds and fat, float to the top and form a scum layer. This layer remains on top and gradually thickens until you have the tank cleaned. The liquid waste goes into the drainfield, while the heavier solids settle to the bottom of the tank where they are gradually decomposed by bacteria. But some non-decomposed solids remain, forming a sludge layer that eventually must be pumped out.<br>
Septic tanks may have one or two compartments. Two-compartment tanks do a better job of settling solids and are required in some areas for new installations. Households not served by public sewers usually depend on a septic system to dispose of wastewater. There are many different types of septic systems designed to fit a wide range of soil and site conditions. These include mound systems, sand filter systems and pressure distribution systems.<br>
A conventional septic system consists of two main parts: the septic tank and the soil drainfield (absorption bed or absorption field). At the head of the drainfield a distribution box or a manifold distributes wastewater to several absorption trenches. The newly developed drainfields include a designated replacement area, should the existing septic system need an addition, repair or replacement, the replacement area can then be used.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sanitation: dignity and protection for all, was the dream of our father of nation, Mahatma Gandhi.<br>
Keeping in pace with the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) started by the Department of Drinking Water Supply, Ministry of Rural Development, Govt. of India, dated 08th August, 2004 for approach to total sanitation under a slogan "The right to Dignity and Privacy", the inventor proposes a low cost sanitation<br>
2<br><br>
solution for people to practice home and hygiene, which is affordable to individual and the community.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided an Improved Septic tank system with sewage treatment plan comprising of:<br>
a septic chamber; an effluent chamber; said septic chamber and the effluent chamber are connected by the connection means; outlet means located at the top of said effluent tank operable to flow liquids out of the septic tank system; the septic chamber having an inlet, an outlet; and at least one chamber and/or both therein operable to allow particular matter in effluents received in said septic system to settle to the bottom thereof; and pipe means connecting said inlet of the septic chamber to the outlet of sewage/ refusal outlet of the area whereby solid and semi-solid particulate wastes in raw sewage effluents entering said septic chamber will be trapped in where the said wastes will undergo aerobic digestion / decomposition and liquid effluents aggressing from said septic chamber will enter said effluent chamber and thereby either being soaked by the ground or goes out by the outlet means to distant drainfield.<br>
A method is disclosed for treatment of raw sewage effluents containing solid and semi-solid wastes comprising the steps of:<br>
settling down the sludge heavier particles in the septic and effluent chamber; floating scum on the top of the waste water level is drained out of the septic tank system; providing air circulation about said perforated pipe means to cause said wastes to undergo aerobic digestion; collecting all liquids and small particles of the wastes beneath chambers including liquids released by the aerobic digestion action; placing all the resulting collected matter in a septic tank system having a settling chamber where organic material in such matter will undergo further anaerobic digestion; and disposing of the resulting liquids from the septic system in a leach field or the like.<br>
A septic tank is a large, underground, watertight container, typically about 9 feet long, 4-5 feet wide and 5 feet tall that is connected to the home's sewer line. While typically designed with a 1,000-gallon liquid capacity, the size of the tank is proportionate to the number of bedrooms in the home or the number of persons in the house. Septic tanks may be rectangular or cylindrical and may be made of concrete, fiberglass or polyethylene.<br>
The septic chamber is essentially a watertight storage container into which raw sewage is discharged and retained for 24 hours or more. Its purpose is primarily to allow solids in the sewage to settle out (sludge) or to float (scum) thereby permitting the liquid portion of the sewage to leave the chamber comparatively free of settleable and floating solids.<br>
Sewage, which has emerged from a septic chamber, is termed " Effluent." The subject of sewage treatment and disposal falls into two distinct stages:<br>
3<br><br>
(a)	the retention and digestion of floating and settleable solids in the septic<br>
chamber; and<br>
(b)	the safe treatment and disposal of the effluent.<br>
Effluent Line<br>
An effluent line is a pump discharge line. This line carries effluent from a pump chamber to an effluent disposal system component and may be polyethylene pipe or rigid plastic piping certified for a pressure application. Pipe size may vary in diameter from 18 mm (3/4 inch) to 50 mm (2 inch) depending on it's application. Piping used for this application must be certified for the pressure it carries and usually has at least a 500 kpa (75 psi) rating. All fittings used with polyethylene pipe should be durable and rated for the operating pressure of the line. Fittings most often used are nylon or stainless steel and clamps should be of all stainless steel construction.<br>
Types of Septic Tanks<br>
Numerous prefabricated septic tanks are available in various types and sizes suitable for domestic use: A septic tank usually includes three components, the septic tank, a drainfield and the soil beneath the drainfield.<br>
a.	Single chamber trickle tanks, Note: Single chamber trickle tanks<br>
may not be used alone, but may be used in conjunction with other septic<br>
tanks.<br>
b.	Double chamber, pump (a septic chamber and an effluent chamber<br>
that accommodates a pump),<br>
c.	Double  chamber,   siphon   (a  septic  chamber  and   an  effluent<br>
chamber that contains a siphon).<br>
The principle object of the invention is to provide upgraded degree of sewage treatment as obtained in the conventional septic tank disposal systems<br>
The second object of the present invention is to provide a simple reliable and low cost septic tank.<br>
The third object of the present invention is to provide a septic tank having very low maintenance requirements.<br>
The fourth object of the present invention is to provide arrangements so that the nutrients in the waste can be utilized by returning it to the soil<br>
The fifth object of the present invention is to install and design the septic tank in a way so that it can last long, (around 60 years)<br>
4<br><br>
The sixth object of the present invention is to provide to overcome the limitations of the septic systems which includes natural soil type, permeability, bedrock and groundwater elevations and the site topography<br>
The seventh objective of the present invention is to provide a water- tight septic tank, which is also resistive to corrosion or decay.<br>
The eighth objective of the present invention is to provide a septic tank, which prohibits and restricts nitrogen, phosphorus, organic matter and bacteria! and viral pathogens into the surrounding area and groundwater and thus preventing pollution hazards.<br>
The ninth objective of the present invention is to provide the system equipped with unpleasant odour free attachments<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The term "septic tank" is a generic term. Modern "septic tanks" may be manufactured in a number of different configurations. All "septic tanks'* must have one or more septic chambers and may have an integral or external effluent chamber to accommodate a syphon or pump included in their design<br>
A septic tank system (1) as described herein comprises a double chamber, siphon (effluent chamber containing a siphon) as shown in Fig 2 &amp; 3. The chambers are septic chamber (2) and an effluent chamber (3). The septic chamber or settling chamber must hold not less than 1800 litres (400 gallons) of sewage. This is referred to as the "working capacity" of the septic tank. The second chamber in a septic tank system is referred to as the "effluent chamber." An effluent chamber may be constructed as an integral part of the septic tank, or as a separate external chamber. However in the present case they are shown separate chambers. The effluent chamber receives effluent from a septic chamber of a septic tank system or packaged sewage treatment plant. An effluent chamber is a desirable component of a private sewage system and depending on the other private sewage system components, may be expected to perform a number of functions.<br>
The septic chamber and the effluent chamber are connected by the connection means (5). The connection means includes a one-way check valve (6) operable to prevent reverse flow from the effluent chamber to the septic chamber. The outlet means (8) located at the top of said effluent chamber, operable to flow liquids out of the septic tank system to a drainfield. The specification of the drainfield is explained in the later part of the description. The outlet means also consists of one-way check valve to prevent the reverse flow. The pipe means (9) connected with the outlet means is so leveled such that that the flow of waste water and scum can be made uninterrupted without pumping. However pumping outlets are provided in the case of emergency.<br>
The septic tank system (1) have an inlet (4), an outlet (8); and at least one chamber and/or both therein operable to allow particular matter in effluents received in said septic tank system to settle to the bottom thereof; and pipe means connecting to said inlet of the septic chamber to the outlet of sewage/ refusal outlet of the area whereby solid and semi-solid participate wastes in raw sewage effluents entering said septic chamber means will be trapped in, wherein the said wastes will undergo aerobic digestion/ decomposition and liquid effluents aggressing from said septic chamber will enter the said effluent chamber and<br>
6<br><br>
thereby either being soaked by the ground or goes out by the outlet means of the effluent chamber.<br>
The pipe means (10) connected with inlet (4) of the septic chamber contains a tee fitting (12) as shown in Fig 5 for emergency purposes. One of the outlet of the Tee is sealed and can be operationalized whenever needed for cleaning the said system.<br>
The septic chamber and the effluent chamber of the said system comprises essentially a gas outlet pipe (12 &amp; 13) which are connected to each chambers for release of the gas accumulated due to the decomposition of the wastes which can be collected in gas holders for utilization. The gas outlet pipes also contains charcoal sieves for removing the unpleasant odour when the gas is not used and released in the atmosphere.<br>
The shapes of the chambers as described in the present invention are cylindrical (vertical). However, they may be a horizontal cylinder, or a sphere or a rectangular box. They are manufactured from durable materials such as concrete, fiberglass, polyethylene, steel and like materials.<br>
Septic chambers are sized to accommodate the estimated sewage flow. Where a large chamber is not available, several smaller chambers may be installed in series to provide the working capacity required.<br>
Generally a single chamber septic tank system may not be used to trickle effluent directly into an effluent disposal system. The distribution of effluent is very difficult and the system will be subjected to freezing with trickle tanks. Therefore the single chamber septic tanks are not in common uses.<br>
In conjunction with a standard septic tank system and disposal field, the effluent chamber, by storing the effluent and then discharging it rapidly and intermittently provides:<br>
a.	a more even distribution of effluent throughout the disposal field,<br>
b.	the important rest period for aeration of the disposal field, and<br>
c.	some protection against freezing.<br>
Septic chamber Capacity<br>
Septic tanks must provide at least 24-hour retention time or at least 3,410 litres (750 gallons) for a one- or two- bedroom house, 4,050 litres (900 gallons) for a three-bedroom house and 4,500 litres (1,000 gallons) for a four-bedroom house. Add 1,100 litres (250 gallons) for each bedroom exceeding four. Septic tank systems must have access openings over inlet and outlet baffles.<br>
7<br><br>
Capacity of Effluent Chambers<br>
The volume of discharge from the effluent chamber varies in size with the capacity of the effluent chamber, and whether the effluent chamber is provided with a syphon or a pump as shown in Fig 4.<br>
It is not always possible to obtain a septic tank with the ideal size of effluent chamber or volume per flush. The volume per flush from the effluent chamber should be adequate to flush between 6 L and 12 L per square meters (0.07 to 0.25 gal. per square foot) of weeping lateral trench in a disposal field served with a septic tank with no other pretreatment.<br>
Over the past 25 yrs on working in the field of the septic tank system and more particularly the designing and the results obtained over cylindrical chambers it has been found out experimentally by the inventor over number of statistical data available the most suitable chamber sizes (septic and effluent) against the number of persons using can be drawn from the following table: -<br><br>
In siphon type septic tank system or pump type septic tank system having small effluent chambers, to consider the installation of a clrainfield for better match, the volume per flush with the square metres (square feet) of weeping lateral trench should be considered.<br>
For larger installations like multistoried buildings, markets etc, it is necessary to install another chamber(s) after the said septic chamber, to act as a separate effluent chamber(s) and provide a sufficient volume of effluent per flush into the effluent disposal ground.<br>
8<br><br>
In more advanced and large treatment systems, the effluent chamber may be required to be of a size capable of storing the equivalent of the expected volume of sewage per day. A timer may be required to control a pump, which may discharge smaller volumes of effluent to an effluent treatment component in equal timed doses, many times a day.<br>
The effluent line or the outlet means is also a pump discharge line (9). This line carries effluent from a pump chamber to an effluent disposal system component and may be polyethylene pipe or rigid plastic piping certified for a pressure application. Pipe size may vary in diameter from 18 mm (3/4 inch) to 50 mm (2 inch) depending on its application. Piping used for this application must be certified for the pressure it carries and usually has at least a 500kpa (75psi) rating. All fittings used with polyethylene pipe should be durable and rated for the operating pressure of the line. Fittings most often used are nylon or stainless steel and damps should be of all stainless steel construction. All sewer piping must be graded and watertight. Laying pipe on a firm trench bottom, and carefully compact the backfill on the sides of the piping to prevent the piping from becoming oval shaped or breaking under the weight of the backfill above it as shown in Fig 8. Maintain an even and constant rate of fall, it may be noted that the sags cause blockages in the pipe<br>
In the excavation for the septic tank system, sewage holding tank, or other tanks to ensure the excavation has a flat, undisturbed base to support the weight of the tank and it's contents. If the excavation is dug too deep and the tank is installed on un-compacted fill, the tank will settle and damage to the connecting pipings. If a siphon type septic tank system is used, the operation of the siphon may also be severely impaired because of the outlet piping being graded the wrong way.<br>
Ground preparation for septic, effluent chamber and drainfield<br>
Good soil facilitates, treatment and disposal of septic wastewater is required for a successful septic tank system. Soil profiles are made of sand, silt and clay work best. If there is too much clay in the soil, the waste may percolate poorly. If the soil contains too much sand and large particles, wastewater may pass through to the groundwater without being treated by soil microbes, which is harmful for the locality.<br>
Soil treatment occurs best when it is above the water table and the soil is relatively dry with oxygen present therein. Water at greater depths allows wastewater to remain in the unsaturated soil, where it can be treated most effectively before reaching groundwater.<br>
Septic systems need space. Only part of the microorganisms and chemicals are removed from wastewater as it moves downward. Even properly operating systems can discharge some phosphates, nitrates and bacteria or viruses into the groundwater. To reduce loading of groundwater with effluent, it is necessary to install the said systems on lots of adequate space.<br>
9<br><br>
Proper design and use is important. Septic tank systems are designed to treat and dispose off a specific volume and type of wastewater in the conditions found at the site. The system must not be overloaded. It may be noted that hazardous chemicals or large amounts of grease should not be disposed in septic tank systems. Kitchen grease should be placed in the garbage, not in the septic tank system. Water conservation extends the life of the system.<br>
Routine maintenance of a septic tank system is essential. Septic tanks/chambers must eventually be pumped at regular intervals. Sludge and scum accumulate and, if allowed to remain, will eventually cause the tank to overflow and clog the drainfield. Good judgment in planning and design and diligent maintenance are the most important aspects of an effective septic tank system management program.<br>
Sewage or untreated household waste quickly clogs all the surrounding ground remaining the most porous gravel formations. The septic tank conditions sewage to allow percolation of the liquid portion into the subsoil. The most important function of septic tanks is to protect the absorption ability of the subsoil and in doing this; the septic tank does the following three functions.<br>
a)	Removal of solids from liquid:- As sewage enters the tank, the rate of<br>
flow is reduced and heavy solids settle, forming sludge. Grease and other light<br>
solids rise to the surface, forming a scum. The sludge and scum are retained and<br>
break down while the clarified effluent (liquid) is discharged to the drainfield for<br>
soil absorption.<br>
b)	Providing biological treatment:- Natural processes break down the<br>
solids and liquids by bacterial action. The breakdown occurs in the absence of<br>
oxygen (anaerobic conditions). The anaerobic conditions are referred to as<br>
"septic," giving the tank its name.<br>
c)	Storing scum and sludge:- The solids accumulate in the bottom of the<br>
tank to form sludge. The scum is a partially submerged mat of floating solids and<br>
grease. Scum and sludge are digested over time and compacted into a small<br>
volume. Areas with warm climates, allow more complete breakdown of solids and<br>
scum than in the cooler climates. For this reason, tanks in warm climates do not<br>
usually need to be pumped or cleaned out nearly as often as those in cold<br>
climates. Regardless of climate, a nonvolatile residue of material remains in the<br>
tank. Sufficient volume for the solids must be provided in the tank between<br>
pumping and cleanings. If the solids fill the tank and enter the drainfield, the<br>
solids can clog the soil in the drainfield.<br>
Grease from the kitchen is detrimental to septic tank functions. Effluent from grease traps must go through septic tanks before being discharged to drainfields to prevent soil plugging. The best approach is to put kitchen grease in old milk jugs and place in the garbage rather than into the drain. Small amounts of kitchen grease can go into the septic tank without damaging the system.<br>
10<br><br>
The liquid faction that leaves the septic tank and enters the drainfield is called the effluent. The bacterial level of the effluent is quite high. The effluent also contains nitrates (among other nutrients), which move downward. To reduce potential for groundwater contamination by the effluent, many areas restrict building lot sizes. Larger tots reduce loading rates and help protect groundwater. Some areas with porous or sandy soils are located in groundwater recharge areas. These areas may be unsuited for septic tanks or require building lot sizes 50 to 100 percent larger than lots not in the recharge areas.- Pathogens break down with soil contact and pathogen levels are reduced as the effluent percolates through the soil. Bacteria eventually die and are removed by the filtering effect of the soil, further purifying the effluent.<br>
The ground surface, also commonly called a biomat or biocrust, is an organic layer, typically 0.6-3 cm thick. It is normally less permeable than the surrounding soil. Thus, the biomat often significantly determines the long-term steady state infiltration capacity of a leach field. The biomat also serves as a filter for bacteria and some suspended solids. In a properly functioning system, the surrounding soil remains desirably unsaturated and aerobic, thus enabling antibiotic attack of any pathogenic bacteria, and more Importantly, chemical reactions involving free oxygen. Biomat is an aid in filtering things, which enter the influence zone. Nitrogen, discharged in human waste, is characteristically passed through any biomat, predominantly as ammonium (N*), which is to be denitrified, or converted to nitrate (N03) form, in the aerobic environment of the influence zone and adjacent soil. Foreign constituents in the wastewater may also absorb and or react with soil constituents; or they may ultimately be only diluted upon return to the ground water.<br>
It has been found out experimentally that the use of peat (Sphagnum spp) for treatment of effluent; particularly to enhance denttrification, have a beneficial treatment potential.<br>
The soil below the teach fields in conventional septic systems provides for aeration oxidizing pollutants and resulting in their removal, transformation or die-off. This results in pollution of ground and surface waters particularly in areas with high septic tank densities.<br>
On considering the above facts the soil below the septic and effluent chambers are prepared in such a way that all the discrepancies / drawbacks and hazards can be minimized.<br>
The figure 8 illustrates the soil structure, which is made porous and the chemical bacterial actions can take place easily with sufficient supply of air / oxygen. The bottom layer Is made up of pebbles around 2.5 - 3.0 cms dia for around 25-30 cms (10-12 inches), thereby filling with porous sand of grain dia of around 1.5 to 3 mm for around 12-25 cms (5-10 inches). This porosity is maintained so that the water logging in the septic and the effluent chamber is minimized. The next layer formed is made up of a mixture of peat fibres with sand used mainly for the denttrification of the sludge. The width of the layer is made around 12-25 cms (5-<br>
11<br><br>
10 inches). The next layer is a leach field which is around 25-30 cms (10-12 inches) width and above that a bed of 12-25 cms (5-10 inches) of porous sand of grain size around 0.5 to 1 cm is poured. The Top of the artificial made ground can have a perforated pipe fitted, which can provide an oxygen / air if necessary for enhancing the decomposition rates. The perforated pipe can also used to drain out sludge in case of emergency. The perforated pipe can also be used as means to inject chemical and biological additives or agents, which can provide enhancement in decomposition rate and thereby increases the efficiency of the septic system. The chemical additives may be strong acids; alkalis or organic solvents and the biological additives are cultures of harmless bacteria plus some waste digesting enzymes. They may be some useful yeast cultures also.<br>
It is seen experimentally that the sludge undergo complete decomposition process in around 21 days in the septic chamber and are then lighter as compared to the sludge and comes out along with the flow of waste water / scum to the effluent chamber. The traces of sludge, which are present in the effluent chamber, are similarly disposed off in 9 days from the septic tank system and thus the wastewater coming out of the said system is free from harmful pollutants and free from unpleasant odour.<br>
Drainfield /disposal around<br>
The drainfield pipe is placed on the contour and perforated to allow the effluent to percolate into the soil. Drainfields should be at least 30 m (100 feet) from the closest well or spring, at least 3 m (10 feet) from water supply lines, and not closer than 15 m (50 feet) to a pond or stream.<br>
Drainfield trenches should normally be level and not less than 64 cms (25 inches) or more than 91 cms (36 inches) in depth. In rare cases, trenches will be deeper and filled with several feet of gravel to obtain acceptable percolation. The tile drain must have at least 30 cms (12 inches) of soil over the tile. The aggregate should be a minimum of 15 cms (6 inches) deep under the drain tile. The drainfield trenches should not exceed 91 cms (36 inches) in width.<br>
Drainfields consist of two or more trenches not more than 30 m (100 feet) in length. Each trench contains sections of open-jointed 10 cms (4-inch) drain tile or perforated non-corrosive drainpipe laid with the holes down. The pipe is tevef to disperse effluent evenly over the soil area. The percolation rate indicates how fast water will penetrate the soil and sizes the drainfield.<br>
Absorption lines or drainfield lines of equal lengths are connected to the distribution box outlets by independent watertight sewers. The absorption or drainfield trenches may be installed at the same elevation or at different elevations. All the watertight sewers leading from the distribution box outlet to the drainfield lines must be at the same elevation at the distribution box and the watertight sewers must be level for the first 60 cms (2 feet) as they lead away from the distribution box.<br>
12<br><br>
If drainfield trenches are at different elevations, some special requirements should be met. After extending 60 cms (2 feet) from the box, the watertight sewers must have a slope of at least 1/8-inch per foot down to the individual dra infield trenches. The dra infield lines should also be installed on a uniform grade of not less than 2 inches nor more than 10 cms (4 inches) per 30 m (100 feet) [5 cms/2 inches is preferred]. An increased number of shorter trenches are preferable to fewer longer trenches in this situation.<br>
The septic chamber and effluent chamber are watertight containers having lids over the top. These lids are sealed permanently so that any kind of leaks over the surface is prohibited. The chambers have airtight containers so the gas generated in the chambers due to the bacterial processes inside can be collected over the top and can be utilized gainfully. The septic tank systems used in the freezing temperature zones can use these gases to heat up or warm the sludge so that the chemical / bacterial processes inside the chambers can be continued. The tank systems where the gas evolved is not used, the gas pipes contains charcoal sieves so that the gas is made odour free.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with respect to particular embodiments, it is not thus limited. Numerous modifications changes and improvements within the scope of the invention will occur to the reader.<br>
