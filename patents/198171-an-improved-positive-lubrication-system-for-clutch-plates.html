■ &gt; • <br>
2 7 MAR 2000<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
This invention relates to an improved positive lubrication system for clutch plates used in clutch of two wheeled vehicles. This invention particularly relates to an improved lubrication system for use in a two wheeled vehicles having engine and transmission unit located substantially on one side of the vehicle with reference to longitudinal medial plane of the vehicle.<br>
Clutch assembly is an essential part of motor vehicles which is employed to transmit engine power to gear box whenever the driver intends to connect the power to gearbox. The clutch assembly used in above class of vehicles, has multiple number of clutch plates having clutch lining material bonded on the faces which act as driven plates. Such faces with clutch lining material are in contact with faces of driving plates of the clutch and are retained under pressure with the help of clutch springs. Such multiple plate clutch assemblies are normally immersed in oil which helps in avoiding wear of clutch lining material due to friction at the insant of engagement / disengagement and also carries away heat generated during such instants.<br>
2<br><br>
The clutch assemblies located in some of the engines employed for driving two wheelers, particularly of the class mentioned above are at disadvantageous position where supply of oil by conventional splash lubrication is scanty. This leads to inadequate lubrication of clutch plates and thereby problems of premature wear of clutch plates and burning of clutch plates, are encountered.<br>
In order to avoid the above problems, it had been our endeavour to design a positive lubrication system for lubricating clutch plates.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to develop a positive lubrication system for lubrication of clutch plates which is more effective than any conventional splash lubrication system.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to have a more efficient positive lubrication system wherein the oil pump is employed on the crankcase and is driven by a suitable driving arrangment from the main shaft.<br>
  3  <br><br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a lubrication system wherein the outlet is taken to the clutch housing cover and through holes provided on clutch lever and clutch bush.<br>
A still further object of the invention is to provide a lubrication system wherein the oil is lead from the clutch housing cavity to clutch plates through centrifugal action.<br>
The present invention provides an improved positive lubrication system for clutch plates used in engine and transmission unit of a two wheeled vehicle comprising a main shaft adapted to drive an oil pump provided with an inlet and an outlet, an inlet tubing and an outlet tubing , a clutch housing cover fitted with a tube, a clutch operating lever, a clutch bush, a clutch housing having a second tube, wherein said tubing being adopted for connecting cavity in the transmission unit to said inlet and outlet of said pump being connected to said clutch housing cover through said tubing, each of said clutch housing cover, said clutch bush, said clutch housing cover being provided with holes to form a continuous passage for oil to pass from said cavity in the transmission to said tube of clutch housing cover; wherein said inlet of oil pump being connected to said outlet for the flow of oil.<br>
In the above-mentioned positive lubrication system both the engine and the transmission unit are located on one side of the vehicle with reference to longitudinal median plane of the vehicle.<br>
    4<br><br>
In the improved positive lubrication system of the present invention both engine and transmission unit are located on one side or at the centre of the vehicle with reference to longitudinal median plane of said vehicle. In the new lubrication system the oil pump is adapted to be driven by a helical gear provided on main shaft through a pinion.<br>
An improved positive lubrication system as stated hereinabove wherein the oil pump is adapted to be electrically operated.<br>
In the lubrication system of the present invention the oil pump is used to connect it from reservoir and is being provided with an inlet. The said lubrication system is provided with an oil pump, an inlet and outlet. It is further provided with a clutch housing cover, a clutch operating lever, a clutch bush, a clutch housing and a clutch box cavity.<br>
Further description of the positive lubrication system of the present invention will be clear from the description stated hereinbelow.<br>
5<br><br>
In the lubrication system as per our invention, oil pump is employed on the crankcase, the inlet of which is taken from the reservoir- The oil pump is driven by suitable driving arrangement from the main shaft. The outlet is taken to the clutch housing cover and through the holes provided on clutch lever and clutch bush, the oil is lead to clutch housing cavity and through centrifugal action, the faces of the clutch driving plates are lubricated.<br>
The above device will now be expalined in detail with reference to drawings accompanying the complete specification wherein:<br>
Fig.l illustrates sectional view of part of the engine showing the clutch of prior art.<br>
Figs.2A and 2B illustrate sectional view of engine illustrating oil passages and oil pump of the present invention.<br>
Fig.3 illustrates sectional view of the part of the engine showing oil passage in the clutch of the present invention.<br>
  6  <br><br>
In the prior art, with refernece to Fig.l, the clutch assembly is mounted on the crank shaft (1) and when the clutch operating lever (2) presses the clutch bush (3) and subsequently clutch housing (4) comprises the springs (5), the clutch plates (6) are free to revolve alongwith crank shaft (l) do not transmit motion to driving gear (7). When the clutch operating lever (2) is released the clutch operating lever (2), clutch bush (3), clutch housing (4) are in an engaged position as shown in the Figure 1. The clutch driving plates (6) are pressed in an contact with the driven plate (23) to transmit motion to driving gear (7).<br>
In the known system, the oil is located in the crankcase cavity which gets splashed due to rotation of various parts in the gearbox and some portion of oil goes to clutch driving plate faces.<br>
In the invented system, unlike the prior art as explained hereinabove, the clutch operating lever (8), clutch bush (9), clutch housing cover (13) and clutch housing (21) are provided with holes to have passage for oil flow.<br>
   7   <br><br>
Figures 2A, 2B and 3 illustrate the location of main components, that is oil pump (10), inlet (11) and outlet (12), a clutch housing cover (13), a clutch operating lever (8), a clutch bush (9), a clutch housing (21) and also clutch box cavity ( 15) .<br>
The oil in the crankcase is located in cavity of<br>
the transmission unit (16)  from where it is sucked to the<br>
inlet of oil pump through metallic oil pipes or rubber/PVC   inlet tubings (17). The oil pump is driven by helical gear member<br>
(18) provided on the main shaft (19) through a pinion (20).<br>
The  outlet  (12)  of  the  oil  pump with pressurized oil is<br>
 delivered  through metallic oil pipes or rubber/PVC outlet tubings<br>
(14) to clutch housing cover (13) which is having a matching<br>
hole (24). This hole, on assembly aligns with the holes in<br>
clutch operating lever (8), clutch bush (9) and clutch housing<br>
(21) wherein a tube (25) is fixed to lead the oil into the<br>
clutch box cavity (15).<br>
   8<br><br>
The pressurized oil from the oil pump (10) flows the holes in the clutch housing cover (13), clutch operating lever (8), clutch bush (9), and tube (25) into the clutch box cavity (15) and through centrifugal force thereafter, it is thrown out of the clutch housing gear (22) lubricating the faces of clutch driving plates (6) and going back to the cavity in transmission unit (16).<br>
As explained above, the provision of oil pump and adequate oil circulation for lubrication of faces of driving plates of the clutch, improves availability of oil at the required location on the clutch plates, thus avoiding failures of clutch plates.<br>
  9   <br><br>
In order to avoid the above problems, we have designed a positive lubrication system for lubricating clutch plates.<br>
In the lubrication system as per our invention, oil pump is employed on the crankcase, the inlet of which is taken from the reservoir. The oil pump is driven by suitable driving arrangement from the main shaft. The outlet is taken to the clutch housing cover and through the holes provided on clutch lever and clutch bush, the oil is lead to clutch housing cavity and through centrifugal action, the faces of the clutch driving plates are lubricated.<br>
The above device will now be explained in detail with reference to accompanying drawings, wherein,<br>
Fig.1 illustrates sectional view of part of the engine showing the clutch of prior art.<br>
Fig.2A and 2B illustrates sectional view of engine illustrating oil passages and oil pump of the present invention.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates sectional view of the part of the engine showing oil passage in the clutch of the present invention.<br>
 3  <br><br>
The oil in the crankcase is located in cavity of the transmission unit (16) from where it is taken to the inlet of oil pump through metallic oil pipes or rubber/PVC tubings (17). The oil pump is driven by a helical gear member (18) provided on the main shaft (19) through a pinion (20). The outlet (12) of the oil pump with pressurized oil is taken through metallic oil pipes or rubber/PVC tubings (14) to clutch housing cover (13) which is having a central hole (24) This hole, on assembly, aligns with the holes in clutch operating lever (8), clutch bush (9) and clutch housing (21).<br>
The pressurized oil from the oil pump (10) flows through the holes in the clutch housing cover (13), clutch operating lever (8), and clutch bush (9) into the clutch box cavity (15) and through centrifugal force thereafter, it is thrown out of the clutch housing gear (22) lubricating the faces of clutch driving plates (6) and going back to the cavity in transmission unit (16).<br>
 5  <br><br>
In the prior art, with reference to Fig.1, the clutch assembly is mounted on the crank shaft (1) and when the clutch operating lever (2) presses the clutch bush (3) and subsequently clutch housing (4) against the compression pressure of springs (5), the clutch driving plates (6) are free to revolve along with crank shaft (1) and do not transmit motion to driving gear (7), when the clutch is released the clutch operating lever (2), clutch bush (3), clutch housing (4) are in a position as shown in figure 1. The clutch driving plates (6) are under pressure and in contact with the driven plate (23) and transmit motion to driving gear (7).<br>
In this system, the oil is located in the crankcase cavity which gets splashed due to rotation of various parts in the gearbox and some portion of oil goes to clutch driving platefaces.<br>
In the invented system, unlike the prior art as explained hereinabove, the clutch operating lever (2) and clutch bush (3) have a central hole.<br>
Figs.2A, 2B &amp; 3 illustrate the location of main components i.e. an oil pump (10), inlet (11) and outlet (12), a clutch housing cover (13), a clutch operating lever (8), a clutch bush (9), a clutch housing (21) and also a clutch box cavity (15).<br>

This invention relates to positive lubrication system for clutch plates used in clutch of two wheeled vehicles. This invention relates particularly to two wheeled vehicles having engine and transmission unit located substantially on one side of the vehicle with reference to longitudinal median plane of the vehicle.<br>
Clutch assembly is an essential part of motor vehicle which is employed to transmit engine power to gear box whenever the clutch is engaged by the driver. The clutch can be disconnected by depressing the clutch lever whenever the driver intends to disconnect the power to gear box. The clutch assembly used in above class of vehicles, has multiple number of clutch plates having clutch lining material bonded on the faces which act as driven plates. Such faces with clutch lining material are in contact with faces of driving plates of the clutch and are retained under pressure with the help of clutch springs. Such multiple plate clutch assemblies are normally immersed in oil which helps in avoiding wear of clutch facing due to friction at the instance of engagement / disengagement and also carries away heat generated during such moments.<br>
The clutch assemblies located in some of the engines employed for driving two wheelers, particularly of the class mentioned above, are at disadvantageous position where supply of oil by conventional splash lubrication is scanty. This leads to inadequate lubrication of clutch plates and thereby problems of premature wear of clutch plates and burning of clutch plates, are encountered.<br>
