				<td>serious environmental pollution unless strict methods of exhaust emission<br>
control are used. A clean burning synthetic diesel fuel can help reduce the<br>
emissions from diesel engines.<br><br>
The production of clean-burning transportation fuels requires either the<br>
reformulation of existing petroleum-based fuels or the discovery of new<br>
methods for power production or fuel synthesis from unused materials. There<br>
are many sources available, derived from either renewable organic or waste<br>
carbonaceous materials. Utilizing carbonaceous waste to produce synthetic<br>
fuels is an economically viable method since the input feed stock is already<br>
considered of little value, discarded as wastte, and disposal is often polluting.<br><br>
Liquid transportation fuels have inherent advantages over gaseous<br>
fuels, having higher energy densities than gaseous fuels at the same pressure<br>
and temperature. Liquid fuels can be stored at atmospheric or low pressures<br>
whereas to achieve liquid fuel energy densities, a gaseous fuel would have to<br>
be stored in a tank on a vehicle at high pressures that canbe a safety<br>
concern in the case of leaks or sudden rupiture. The distribution of liquid fuels<br>
is much easier than gaseous fuels, using simple pumps and pipelines. The<br>
liquid fueling infrastructure of the existing transportation sector ensures easy<br>
integration into the existing market of any production of clean-burning<br>
synthetic liquid transportation fuels.<br><br>
The availability of clean-burning liquid transportation fuels is a national<br>
priority. Producing synthesis gases cleanly and efficiently from carbonaceous<br>
sources, that can be subjected to a Fischer-Tropsch process to produce clean<br>
and valuable synthetic gasoline and diesel fuels, will benefit both the<br>
transportation sector and the health of society. Such a process allows for the<br>
application of current state-of-art engine esxhaust after-treatment methods for<br>
NOx reduction, removal of toxic particulates present in diesel engine<br>
exhaust, and the reduction of normal combustion product pollutants, currently<br>
accomplished by catalysts that sire poisoned quickly by any sulfur present, as<br>
is the case in ordinary stocks of petroleum derived diesel fuel, reducing the<br><br>
catalyst efficiency. Typically, Fischer-Tropsch liquid fuels, produced from<br>
biomass derived synthesis gases, ere sulfur-free, aromatic free, and in the<br>
case of synthetic diesel fuel have an ultrahigh cetane value.<br><br>
Biomass material is the most commonly processed carbonaceous<br>
waste feed stock used to produce renewable fuels. Waste plastic, rubber,<br>
manure, crop residues, forestry, tree and grass cuttings and biosolids from<br>
waster water (sewage) treatment are also candidate feed stocks for<br>
conversion processes. Biomass feted stocks can be converted to produce<br>
electricity, heat, valuable chemicals or fuels. California tops the nation in the<br>
use and development of several bomass utilization technologies. Each year<br>
in California, more than 45 million tons of municipal solid waste is discarded<br>
for treatment by waste management facilities. Approximately half this waste<br>
ends up in landfills. . For example, in just the Riverside County , California<br>
area, it is estimated that about 4000 tons of waste wood are disposed of per<br>
day. According to other estimates; over 100,000 tons of biomass per day are<br>
dumped into landfills in the Riverside County collection area. This municipal<br>
waste comprises about 30% waste paper or cardboard, 40/o organic (green<br>
and food) waste, and 30% combinations of wood, paper, plastic and metal<br>
waste. The carbonaceous components of this waste material have chemical<br>
energy that could be used to red  uce the need for other energy sources if it<br>
can be converted into a clean-burning fuel. These waste sources of<br>
carbonaceous material are not the only sources available. While many<br>
existing carbonaceous waste materials, such as paper, can be sorted, reused<br>
and recycled, for other materials, the waste producer would not need to pay a<br>
tipping fee, if the waste were to be delivered directly to a conversion facility. A<br>
tipping fee, presently at $30-$35 per ton, is usually charged by the waste<br>
management agency to offset disposal costs. Consequently not only can<br>
disposal costs be reduced by transporting the waste to a waste-to-synthetic<br>
fuels processing plant, but additional waste would be made available because<br>
of the lowered cost of disposal.<br><br>
The burning of wood in a wood stove is an example of using biomass<br>
to produce heat energy. Unfortunately, the open burning the biomass waste<br>
to obtain energy and heat is not a clean and efficient method to utilize the<br>
calorific value. Today, many new ways of utilizing carbonaceous waste are<br>
being discovered. For example, one way is to produce synthetic liquid<br>
transportation fuels, and another way is to produce energetic gases for<br>
conversion into electricity.<br><br>
Using fuels from renewable biomass sources can actually decrease the<br>
net accumulation of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, while<br>
providing clean, efficient energy for transportation. One of the principal<br>
benefits of co-production of synthetic liquid fuels from biomass sources is that<br>
it can provide a storable transportation fuel while reducing the effects of<br>
greenhouse gases contributing to global warming. In the future, these<br>
co-production processes could provide clean-burning fuels for a renewable<br>
fuel economy that could be sustained continuously.<br><br>
A number of processes exist to convert coal and other carbonaceous<br>
materials to clean-burning transportation fuels, but they tend to be too<br>
expensive to compete on the market with petroleum-based fuels, or they<br>
produce volatile fuels, such as methanol and ethanol that have vapor<br>
pressure values too high for use in high pollution areas, such as the Southern<br>
California air-basin, without legislative exemption from clean air regulations.<br>
An example of the latter process s the Hynol Methanol Process, which uses<br>
hydro-gasification and steam reformer reactors to synthesize methanol using<br>
a co-feed of solid carbonaceous materials and natural gas, and which has a<br>
demonstrated carbon conversion efficiency of &gt;85% in bench-scale<br>
demonstrations.<br><br>
The need to identify new resources and methods for the production of<br>
transportation fuels requires not only investigating improvements in ways to<br>
produce current petroleum-based fuels but also research into new methods<br>
for the synthesis of functionally equivalent alternative fuels obtained using<br><br>
resources and methods that are not in use today. The production of synthetic<br>
liquid fuels from carbonaceous materials such as waste organic materials is<br>
one way to solve these problems. The utilization of carbonaceous waste<br>
materials to produce synthetic fuels can be considered a feasible method of<br>
obtaining new resources for fuel production since the material feed stock is<br>
already considered a waste, without value and often it's disposal creates<br>
additional sources of environmental pollution.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present invention makes use of steam pyrolysis, hydro-gasification<br>
and steam reformer reactors to produce a synthesis gas that can be<br>
converted into a synthetic paraffinic fuel, preferably a diesel fuel, although<br>
synthetic gasolines and jet propuision fuels can also be made, using a<br>
Fischer-Tropsch paraffin fuel synthesis reactor. Alternatively, the synthesis<br><br>
r<br><br>
gas may be used in a co-generated power conversion and process heat<br>
system. The present invention provides comprehensive equilibrium thermo-<br>
chemical analyses for a general class of co-production processes for the<br>
synthesis of clean-burning liquid transportation fuels, thermal process energy<br>
and electric power generation from feeds of coal, or other carbonaceous<br>
materials, and liquid water. It enables a unique design, efficiency of operation<br>
and comprehensive analysis of coal, or any other carbonaceous feed<br>
materials to co-produced fuel, power and heat systems.<br><br>
The invention provides a process and apparatus for producing a<br>
synthesis gas for use as a gaseous fuel or as feed into a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
reactor to produce a liquid parajffinicjuel, recycled water and sensible heat, in<br>
a substantially self-sustaining process. A slurry of particles of carbonaceous<br>
material suspended in liquid water, and hydrogen from an internal source, are<br>
fed into a steam generator for pyrolysis and hydro-gasification reactor under<br>
conditions whereby super-heated steam, methane, carbon dioxide and carbon<br>
monoxide are generated and :ed into a steam reformer under conditions<br>
whereby synthesis gas comprising primarily of hydrogen and carbon<br><br>
monoxide are generated. Using a hydrogen separation filter for purification, a<br>
portion of the hydrogen generated by the steam reformer is fed into the hydro-<br>
gasification reactor as the hydrogen from an internal source. The remaining<br>
synthesis gas generated by the steam refonmer is either used as fuel for a<br>
gaseous fueled engine or gas turbir e to produce electricity and process heat,<br>
or is fed into a Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis reactor under conditions to<br>
produce a liquid fuel, and recycled water. The correct stoichiometric ratio of<br>
hydrogen to carbon monoxide molecules fed into the Fischer-Tropsch fuel<br>
synthesis reactor, is controlled by the water to carbon ratio in the feed stocks.<br>
Molten salt loops are used to transfer heat from the exothermic hydro-<br>
gasification reactor (and from the exothermic Fischer-Tropsch reactor if liquid<br>
fuel is produced) to the endothermic steam generator for pyrolysis and the<br>
steam reformer reactor vessels.<br><br>
In particular, the present invention provides the following features.<br><br>
1)       A general purpose solid carbonaceous material feed system that<br>
can accept arbitrary combinations of coal, urban and agricultural biomass,<br>
and municipal solid waste for hydro-gasification.<br><br>
2)       A first stage, steam generator for pyrolysis and hydro-<br>
gasification unit.<br><br>
3)       A steam reformer as a second stage reactor to produce<br>
hydrogen rich synthesis gas from the output of the first stage steam generator<br>
for pyrolysis and hydro-gasification unit. The molal steam to carbon ratio is<br>
maintained as necessary to bring the chemical reactions close to equilibrium;<br><br>
4)       Either (a) a Fischer-Tropsch (synthesis gas-to-liquid) fuel<br>
synthesizer as a third and final stage reactor to conyert the synthesis gas from<br>
the steajj reformer into a sulfur-free clean-burning liquid transportation fuel,<br>
and recycled water or (b) use of uenerated synthesis gas as fuel for process<br>
heat and/or in a fuel engine or g£,3.turbine that,can generate electricity;<br><br>
5)      Three thermo-chemical process reactors are operated to<br>
produce nearly pure paraffinic hydrocarbon liquids (similar to petroleum<br>
derived diesel fuels) and wax-like compounds (similar to petroleum derived<br>
USP paraffinic jellies, which can be further refined into more diesel-like fuels<br>
using conventional methods) from carbonaceous feed stocks (such as waste<br>
wood) in a continuous self-sustainable fashion without the need for additional<br>
fuels or external energy sources. The reactor configurations can also be<br>
optimized for the production of other synthetic fuels, such as dimethyl ether (a<br>
fuel similar to propane, that can be used as; a transportation fuel in diesel<br>
engines and gas turbines) and gaseous fuel grade hydrogen (a fuel that can<br>
be used in engines and turbines, and if purified to remove carbon monoxide,<br>
as an electrochemical fuel in a fuel cell), as well as energetic synthesis gases<br>
for combined cycle power conversion and electric power production.<br><br>
The fundamental advantages of this invention, over what was<br>
achievable with the prior art, are (a) energy efficient (&gt;85%) methane<br>
production from the available carbon in the carbonaceous feed stock using<br>
steam pyrolysis to activate the carbon and hydrogen gas as the sole initiating<br>
reactant, in contradistinction to partial oxidative gasification usually requiring<br>
an additional energy intensive air separation system to provide the necessary<br>
oxygen; (b) chemically self-sustained operation of the first stage hydro-<br>
gasification reactor by feeding-back surplus hydrogen gas produced in the<br>
second stage methane steam reformer reactor; (c) energy efficient synthesis<br>
of clean-burning transportation fuels using the effluent gases from the steam<br>
reformer, such as: (i) paraffinic compounds using a third stage Fischer-<br>
Tropsch fuel synthesis reactor, (ii) dimethyl ether synthesis using a third stage<br>
synthesis reactor, and (iii) hydrogen production using a hydrogen separation<br>
and/or purification filter without the need for a third stage fuel synthesis<br>
reactor; (d) thermally self-sustained operation of all reactors by effective<br>
management of thermal and chemical energy using combinations of molten<br>
salt or water/steam heat transfer fluids, combustion of product energetic<br>
gases to start and maintain process temperatures, recovered process heat for<br><br>
the generation of electric power, without the need for additional fuels and<br>
external energy sources; (e) significantly reduced airborne emissions from all<br>
enclosed processes reactors and/or synthesis gas combustors when<br>
compared to direct naturally aspirated combustion (usually known as open<br>
incineration) of the carbonaceous 1eed materials; and f) the ability to capture<br>
all gaseous carbon dioxide effluen t from process reactors or intra-process<br>
synthesis gas combustors for sequestration and/or chemical conversion into<br>
condensed phase compounds using conventional technologies.<br><br>
These novel configurations of the process reactors have the capability<br>
to improve the overall efficiency cf energy utilization for carbonaceous<br>
material conversion in a co-prodiction plant for synthetic fuels, chemicals and<br>
energy.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION <br><br>
A steam generator for pyro ysis, hydro-gasification reactor (HGR) and<br>
steam pyrolytic reformer (SPR) (a so called a steam pyrolytic reactor, steam<br>
reformer or steam reactor) such as used in a Hynol process, may be utilized<br>
to produce the synthesis gas (syn gas) through steam pyrolysis of the feed<br>
stock, hydro-gasification and steam reforming reactions. The reactions start<br>
in the HGR to convert carbon in the carbonaceous matter into a methane rich<br>
producer gas and continue through the SPR to produce synthesis gas with the<br>
correct hydrogen and carbon monoxide stiochiometry for efficient operation of<br>
the Rscher-Tropsch process. With the Fischer-Tropsch process as the final<br>
step in processing, products such as synthetic gasoline, synthetic diesel fuel<br>
and recycled water can be produced.<br><br>
The feedstock requirement is highly flexible. Many feeds that consist<br>
of different carbonaceous materials can be wet milled to form a water slurry<br>
that can be fed at high pressure into a steam pyroiyzer, hydro-gasifier and<br>
steam reformer reactors for synthesis gas production. The feed to water<br>
mass ratio can even vary during tie running of the process, with a knowledge<br>
of the chemical content of the feed, to maintain the carbon-hydrogen<br>
stiochiometry required for an opt mized fuel synthesis process. Appropriate<br>
carbonaceous materials include biomass, natural gas, oil, petroleum coke,<br>
coal, petrochemical and refinery by-products and wastes, plastics, tires,<br>
sewage sludge and other organic wastes. For example, wood is an example<br>
of waste biomass material that it; readily available in Riverside County,<br>
California. This particular waste stream could be augmented with other<br>
carbonaceous materials, such as green waste and biosolids from water<br>
treatment that are available in Riverside County, and would otherwise go to<br>
landfill.<br><br>
When used to make a transportation fuel, such as diesel fuel, the<br>
process is designed so that the feedstock makes the maximum amount of<br>
Fischer-Tropsch paraffinic prod act required. The desired output consists of a<br><br>
liquid hydrocarbon, such as cetane, C16H34, within the carbon number range,<br>
12 to 20, suitable as a diesel fuel. Excess synthesis gas output from the SPR,<br>
i.e., "leftover" chemical energy from the Fischer Tropsch synthetic fuel<br>
producing process, can be used as an energetic fuel to run a gas turbine for<br>
electricity production. The synthesis gas output after recycling enough<br>
hydrogen to sustain the hydro-gasifier, may be used for this purpose also,<br>
depending on the needs of the user. The following provides a method for<br>
maximizing the economic potential from the present invention in the<br>
conversion of carbonaceous materials to a usable transportation fuels and<br>
inclusive of the possibility for direct electric power production through a gas<br>
turbine combined cycle.<br><br>
1)        Find approximate data on available carbonaceous wastes, their<br>
chemical composition and perform further analysis on the practical need for<br>
the process.<br><br>
2)        Model the important reactions within the process consisting of<br>
the steam generator for pyrolysis, lydro-gasifier, steam reformer, and the<br>
Fischer-Tropsch (or other fuel synthesis) reactor on a continuous flow-through<br>
basis. This may be done by optimizing the Fischer-Tropsch (or other fuel<br>
synthesizer) feedstock for the optimum stoichiometric hydrogen to carbon<br>
monoxide mole ratio for fuel to be synthesized.<br><br>
3)        Perform an economic analysis on the costs to obtain and<br>
prepare the input material required, capital costs, operating and maintenance,<br>
and product yield and costs.<br><br>
Specific implementations are given below in conjunction with flow<br>
charts provided in the Figures, demonstrating the conversion of waste wood,<br>
as the candidate carbonaceous material, to a liquid diesel transportation fuel,<br>
recycled water and an alternative power source, via a Fischer-Tropsch<br>
process linked to a gas turbine combined cycle.<br><br>
The thermo-chemical conversion of carbonaceous materials occurs by<br>
two main processes: hydro-gasification and steam reformation, with steam<br>
pyrolysis of the feedstock occurring within the steam generator to pre-treat<br>
feedstock and activate the carbon contained therein. The hydro-gasifier<br>
requires an input of the pyrolyzed carbonaceous waste, hydrogen, steam,<br>
reacting in a vessel at high temperature and pressure, which in a specific<br>
implementation is approximately 30 atmospheres and 1000 degrees Celsius.<br>
Steam reforming of the methane rich effluent gas from the HGR also requires<br>
an approximate pressure of 30 atmospheres and 1000 degrees Celsius.<br>
More generally, each process can be conducted over a temperature range of<br>
about 700 to 1200 degrees Celsius and a pressure of about 20 to 50<br>
atmospheres. Lower temperatures and pressures can produce useful reaction<br>
rates with the use of appropriate reaction catalysts.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 1, which is an overall flow diagram, the order of<br>
general processes that carry out these main reaction processes is shown<br>
(specific amounts for a particular embodiment are in the flow diagrams shown<br>
in Figures 14 through 38). Piping is used to convey the materials through the<br>
process. The feed 11 is chopped milled or ground in a grinder 10 into small<br>
particles, mixed with the recycled water 12 and placed in a receptacle or tank<br>
14 as a liquid, suspension slurry 16 that is transportable as a compressed<br>
fluid by a pump 18 to a steam generator 20 where the slurry 16 is<br>
superheated and pyrolyzed, followed by either separation of the steam in a<br>
steam separator 22 so that stearr goes through piping 24 that is separate<br>
from piping that delivers the pumped, dense slurry paste 26, or a direct steam<br>
pyrolysis feed through piping 27.<br><br>
The dense slurry paste feed 26, or the direct steam pyrolysis feed 27,<br>
enters the HGR 28. Hydrogen from an internal source (from the steam<br>
reformer via a hydrogen separation filter described below) and a fraction of<br>
the previously produced steam flow into the HGR 28 for the desired output.<br>
The output gases consists largely of methane, hydrogen, carbon monoxide,<br>
and super-heated steam. The gases produced by the HGR 28 leaves the<br><br>
chamber and is pumped over to tie SPR 30. The un-reacted residue (or ash)<br>
from the HGR, is periodically removed from the bottom of the reactor vessel<br>
using a double buffered lock-hopper arrangement, that is commonly used in<br>
comparable high pressure gasific ation systems. The ash is expected to be<br>
comprised of sand, Si02, and alumina, Al203, with trace amounts of metals.<br>
The input to the SPR 30 is delivered from either the steam separator 22 by<br>
piping 32 through a heater 34 anc further piping 36, or via the HGR 28 output<br>
piping, to provide greater-than-theoretical steam to carbon ratio into the SPR<br>
30, to mitigate coking in the reactor. The output is a higher amount of<br>
hydrogen, and CO, with the appropriate stiochiometry for the desired<br>
hydrocarbon fuel synthesis process described below.<br><br>
The output of the SPR 30 is directed via piping 38 through heat<br>
exchangers 40 and 42. Condensed water 44 is separated and removed from<br>
the SPR output, via a heat exchanger and liquid water expander 47. The non-<br>
condensable gaseous output of SPR 30 is then conveyed to a hydrogen<br>
separation filter 46. A portion of tie hydrogen from the SPR output, about<br>
one-half in this embodiment, is carried from the filter 46, passed through the<br>
heat exchanger 40 with a resultar t rise in its temperature (in the embodiment<br>
from 220 degrees centigrade to 970 degrees Centigrade) and delivered to the<br>
HGR 28 as its hydrogen input. The hot effluent from the SPR output is cooled<br>
by passing through heat exchangers 40 and 42, used to heat the recycled<br>
hydrogen, and make steam respectively. The condensed water 44 leaving the<br>
heat exchanger 47 is recycled back to make the water supply 12 for the slurry<br>
feed. By such means, a self-sustaining process is obtained.<br><br>
The fuel synthesis gas is then used for one of two options. Based on<br>
the calorific value, the synthesis gas may go through a gas turbine combined<br>
cycle for direct energy production or through a fuel synthesis reactor (in this<br>
embodiment, a Fischer-Tropsch process to produce a clean diesel fuel and<br>
recycled water). In accordance with a specific embodiment of the invention,<br>
the synthesis gas is directed through an expansion turbine 48, to recover<br>
mechanical energy by lowering the pressure of the gaseous feed into the<br><br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactor 50. The mechanical power produced by the liquid<br>
state turbine, the Brayton and Rankine cycle turbines can be used to provide<br>
power for internal slurry, water feed pumps, iair compressor, with the surplus<br>
exported via electricity generation, see Tables 1 through 7.<br><br>
Efficiency may be maximized by adjusting input and process<br>
parameters. The biomass/ coal vaiying-mixture feed is synthesized into a<br>
slurry by adding water whereby after steam separation the carbon to<br>
hydrogen ratio will be appropriate for the process. A slurry feed needs<br>
enough water to run the hydro-gas fier, the steam reformer, and to keep the<br>
feed in a viable slurry after steam separation. Prior art attempts at biomass<br>
conversion using solid dry feed had many mechanical problems of feeding a<br>
solid into the high pressure, and high temperature HGR reaction chamber.<br>
This method of slurry feed has already been demonstrated and studied,<br>
according to the results for the "Hydrothermal Treatment of Municipal Solid<br>
Waste to Form High Solids Slurries in a Pilot Scale System", by C. B.<br>
Thorsness et al., UCRL-ID 119686, published by Lawrence Livermore Nation<br>
Laboratory, Livermore, CA in 1995. In addition, there is related art published<br>
on the making and operating of coal water slurry feeds. For example, see Z.<br>
Aktas et al., Fuel Processing Technology 62 2000 1-15.The principle<br>
reactions of the two main processes, hydro-gasification and steam reforming,<br>
are shown here. The HGR independent reactions can be expressed as:<br><br><br><br>
Reactions 2 and 3 are enc othermic. Reaction 1 is sufficiently<br>
exothermic to provide the heat of reaction for reactions 2 and 3. Some<br>
preheating of the HGR will be needed to tiring the reactor up to its operating<br>
temperature. Thus, the HGR is intended to be self-sustaining once the<br>
reactions have started and achieve steady state.<br><br>
The main purpose of the HGR process is to maximize the carbon<br>
conversion from the feed stock into the energetic gases CH4 and CO. After<br>
this process, hydrogen is produced by reacting superheated steam with CH4<br>
and CO within the SPR. In the SPR, half the hydrogen is obtained from the<br>
superheated steam and the remainder from the CH4. The principle reactions<br>
in the SPR are considered to be:<br><br><br><br>
The steam reforming reactior s (4 and 5) are often run with steam<br>
concentrations higher than required for the stiochiometry shown above. This<br>
is done to avoid coke formation and to improve conversion efficiency. The<br>
required steam concentration is usually specified in the form of the<br>
steam-to-carbon mole ratio (S:C), the ratio of water steam molecules per<br>
carbon atom in the HGR feed. The preferred (S:C) ratio for the SPR<br>
operation is greater than 3. This steam rich condition favors the water-gas<br>
shift reaction. This reaction is only slightly exothermic (AH°= -41 kJ/mole<br>
CO); however, it produces additional hydrogen gas and converts carbon<br>
monoxide into carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, an additional unwanted<br>
secondary reaction can occur, the methanation reaction, which consumes<br>
hydrogen:<br><br><br><br>
The resulting effluent after the two main reactors is a synthesis of<br>
gases rich in hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and steam. Approximately half the<br>
hydrogen produced in the SPR is recycled back to the HGR. Consequently,<br>
no outside source of hydrogen is needed to maintain steady state operation.<br>
The HGR and SPR processes, therefore, may be considered to be chemically<br>
self-sustaining. The remaining syntnesis gas is then available for the<br>
production of fuels and process heat.<br><br>
The present invention using the Fischer-Tropsch process can produce<br>
a zero-sulfur, ultrahigh cetane value diesel-like fuel and valuable paraffin wax<br>
products. The absence of sulfur enables low pollutant and particle emitting<br>
diesel fuels to be realized.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a source of by-products. One<br>
useful by-product is purified water, which can be re-cycled to create the slurry<br>
feed into the process. In a report by Rentech titled "Fischer-Tropsch<br>
technology" dated 1998 see Rentech web publications at<br>
http://www.rentechinc.com. Rentech states that the Fischer-Tropsch process<br>
with an iron catalyst makes about 7/1 Oths of a barrel of water per barrel of<br>
Fischer-Tropsch products. A cobalt catalyzed Fischer-Tropsch process<br>
makes about 1.1 to 1.3 barrels of water for each barrel of Fischer-Tropsch<br>
products, a greater amount than iron. Part of the water may be recycled to<br>
make steam in the steam reformer unit and for cooling in both the synthesis<br>
gas and Fischer-Tropsch step of the overall process.<br><br>
The Fischer-Tropsch reactions also produce tail gas that contains<br>
hydrogen, CO, CO2, and some light hydrocarbon gases. Hydrogen can be<br>
stripped out of the tail gas and recycled either to the HGR or the Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor. Any small amounts of other gases such as CO and C02<br>
may be flared off.<br><br>
Two main products of Fischer-Tropsch may be characterized as<br>
synthetic oil and petroleum wax. According to Rentech, in the above report<br>
for their particular implementation of the Fischer-Tropsch process, the mix of<br>
solid wax to liquid ratio is about 50/50. Fischer-Tropsch products are totally<br>
free of sulfur, nitrogen, nickel, vanadium, asphaltenes, and aromatics that are<br>
typically found in crude oil. The products are almost exclusively paraffins and<br>
olefins with very few, or no, complex cyclic hydrocarbons or oxygenates that<br>
would otherwise require further separation and/or processing in order to be<br>
usable end-products. The absence of sulfur, nitrogen, and aromatics<br>
substantially reduces harmful emissions.<br><br>
California's Air Resources Board (CARB) specifications for diesel fuel<br>
require a minimum cetane value of 48 and reduced sulfur content. The above<br>
Rentech study with Shell diesel fue produced from a Fischer-Tropsch process<br>
has a cetane value of 76. The CARB standard for sulfur in diesel fuel placed<br>
in the vehicle tank is 500 ppm by weight, and Shell's Fischer-Tropsch process<br>
diesel fuel has no detectable amount in the ppm range. The CARB standard<br>
for aromatic content is no more than 10% by volume (20% for small<br>
refineries). The Shell Fischer-Tropsch process diesel fuel had no detectable<br>
aromatics.<br><br>
Rentech further affirmed through studies that the diesel fuel may need<br>
no further processing because of the purity and olefin products that may even<br>
be advantageous over crude oil diesel. The Fischer-Tropsch diesel process is<br>
clean and the product is cleaner, has a higher cetane value, and most likely<br>
does not need further processing, when compared to a crude oil diesel.<br><br>
A gas turbine combined cycle for electric power production is an option.<br>
If the Fischer-Tropsch product is unexpectedly too costly, the use of the<br>
synthesis gas heating value can be a viable option, based on an overall<br>
efficiency of 65% of the synthesis gas energy converting to electric energy.<br>
This number is reasonable since the synthesis gas starts at a high<br>
temperature as opposed to taking natural gas in from a pipeline.<br><br>
Process modeling can be used to reasonably produce a synthesis gas<br>
maximized for a yield high in CO and stoichiometric hydrogen. First, the unit<br>
operation reactions of the hydro-gasifier, steam reformer, and<br>
Fischer-Tropsch reactors are modeled. This may be accomplished by using<br>
Stanjan, a DOS-based computer program that uses equilibrium modeling. By<br>
varying the parameters of temperature, pressure, original feedstock and gas<br>
flows, a parameterization study was carried out based on costs and output<br>
benefit. The hydro-gasifier variables were modified for the maximum practical<br>
carbon conversion efficiency. The steam reformer variables were modified for<br>
maximum practical CO output, er ough hydrogen for recycling output, and<br><br>
minimum CO2 production. The study looked at the various parameters<br>
whereby two different values varied for one constant, resulting in 3-D<br>
parameterization studies. The following discusses the results from the<br>
computer modeling of the main reactions using Stanjan programming.<br><br>
Referring to Figure 2, the effect of varying the water or steam and<br>
hydrogen ratios on the conversion efficiency of carbon in feedstock in the<br>
HGR is shown at 800°C and 30 atm. As the hydrogen and water input to the<br>
HGR increases, the conversion efficiency of carbon in feedstock increases<br>
until it reaches 100%. The condition that fails in the area of 100% conversion<br>
efficiency achieves one of the modeling objectives, and these conditions were<br>
used. In order to avoid the cost of recycling of H2, the minimum amount of H2<br>
recycled to the HGR must be chosen. Figure 3 shows the effect of H2 and<br>
H20 on CH4 in the HGR at 800°C and 30 atm. Figure 4 shows the effect of H2<br>
and H20 on C02 in the HGR at 800°C and 30 atm. At a high amount of H2<br>
and low amount of H2O input, the amount of CO2 is low. Although the<br>
objective is to minimize the amount of C02 in the synthesis gas, it is not<br>
necessary to minimize C02 in the HGR because C02 is gauged in the SPR<br>
reactions through the water-gas-shift reaction to obtain a proper ratio of H2<br>
and CO for a maximum Fischer-Tropsch diesel fraction. Figure 5 shows the<br>
effect of H2 and H20 on CO in the HGR at 800°C and 30 atm.<br><br>
Figures 6,7,8 and 9 show the effects of varying temperature and<br>
pressure on the chemical composition of the effluent gases from the HGR at<br>
feed of 2.76 mol H2 and 0.066 mol H20 per mole C in the feed stock. At these<br>
conditions of H2 and H20 input to the HGR, the carbon conversion efficiency<br>
is estimated to close to 100% in a temperature range of 800 to 1000°C and a<br>
pressure range of 30 atm. to 50 atm, for equilibrium chemistry.<br><br>
Figure 10 shows the ratio of H2 and CO available for feed into the<br>
Fischer-Tropsch fuel synthesis reactor, against the steam content added to<br>
the SPR at 800°C and 30atm. This ratio increases with the increasing amount<br>
of steam added to the SPR and reaches 2.1 at about 3.94 mol steam (or<br><br>
water) added per mol C in feedstock. With this amount of steam added, the<br>
system will achieve chemical and thermal self-sustainability and provide a<br>
proper ratio of H2 and CO for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis of cetane.  Figure 11<br>
shows the effect of H20 added to the SPR at 800°C and 30atm. Figures 12<br>
and 13 show the effect of temperature and pressure on the H2 and CO ratio<br>
and the conversion of CH4 in the SPR. At higher temperature and lower<br>
pressure, this ratio is higher. In a smilar trend with the H2 and CO ratio, the<br>
conversion of CH4 increases with increasing temperature and with decreasing<br>
pressure. It is thus high temperature and low pressure favored in the SPR.<br><br>
The products of Fischer-Tropsch paraffinic liquid fuels are in a wide<br>
range of carbon number. According to the above Rentech report, about half<br>
of the products are diesel fuel. Also about half of the products come in the<br>
form of wax, with minor amounts of gases such as un-reacted reactants and<br>
hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, propane and so forth). To exemplify<br>
the present invention, cetane, whici is in middle position of diesel range (Cn<br>
to C2o ), was chosen as diesel fuel.<br><br>
The results of thermo-chemical and thermodynamic modeling of the<br>
hydro-gasified conversion of waste wood (biomass), as a prototypical<br>
carbonaceous feed material, were used to examine the details and illustrate<br>
the features of this invention. These simulations of the novel sequence of<br>
process reactors were undertaken to discover the thermo-chemical conditions<br>
needed to achieve the production of synthetic fuels. For example, in the<br>
production of synthetic diesel fuel, the objectives were to attain self-sustained<br>
operation of the first stage hydro-gasifier. In a particular embodiment, this is<br>
accomplished at an equilibrium temperature! of 1000°C (738°Cwhen<br>
adiabatic) and 30 atmospheres pressure with a total hydrogen to carbon feed<br>
mole ratio of at least 3.48:1 (1.67: when adiabatic), and water to carbon feed<br>
ratio of at least 0.07:1 (0.43 when adiabatic), a water steam to carbon feed<br>
mole ratio of at least 3.91:1 (1.67:1 when adiabatic) into the second stage<br>
steam reforming reactor also operating at an equilibrium temperature of<br>
1000°C (900°C when adiabatic) and 30 atmospheres pressure, to obtain<br><br>
conditions for simultaneous optimal quantities of product hydrogen for self-<br>
sustained operation of the first stage hydro-gasification reactor and an<br>
adequate hydrogen to carbon mole ratio of at least 2.1:1 in the residual<br>
synthesis gas stream to feed the third stage Fischer-Tropsch reactor,<br>
operating at 200°C and 10 atmospheres pressure, and adiabatic self-<br>
sustained operation of a special HGR and SPR combination reactor, followed<br>
by a conventionally operated SPR and Fischer-Tropsch reactors, with full<br>
thermal and chemical potential energy management.<br><br>
Tables 1 through 5 show the overall energy transfer rates into and out<br>
from each heat exchanger and power conversion component for each<br>
operating mode of the conversion process. The mass flow, molal flow, thermal<br>
energy management, water/steam and molten salt schematic diagrams for<br>
each of the five operating modes of the conversion process are also shown as<br>
Figs14-18,19-23, 24-28, 29-33 and 34-38 respectively. Tables 6 and 7<br>
summarize the results of the performance studies and process configuration<br>
parameters for each of the five operating modes of the conversion process.<br><br>
The carbonaceous material feed process initially described above uses<br>
a water slurry suspension feed technology, originally developed by Texaco for<br>
use in its partial-oxidation gasifiers, that can accept a wide variety of<br>
carbonaceous materials, and can be metered by controlled pumping into the<br>
first stage hydrogen gasification reactor (HGR) to produce a methane rich<br>
gas with high conversion efficiency (measured to have at least 85% carbon<br>
feed chemical utilization efficiency). Enough heat is available to be able to<br>
generate super-heated steam from the biomass-water slurry feed to supply<br>
and operate the second stage steam-methane reformer. The reformer product<br>
gas is fed into a hydrogen membrane filter that allows almost pure hydrogen<br>
to pass back into the first stage reactor to sustain the hydro-gasification of the<br>
biomass. The remaining second stage product gas, not passing through the<br>
hydrogen filter, is cooled to condense and re-cycle any water vapor present<br>
back into the slurry carbonaceous feed sys;tem. The unfiltered gas is fed into<br>
the fuel synthesis reactors, which comprise a Fischer-Tropsch paraffin hydro-<br><br>
carbon synthesis reactor, which operates at 200°C and 10 atmospheres<br>
pressure. Process modeling reveals that the hydrogen/carbon molecular feed<br>
ratio must be at least 2.1:1 to optimize production of chemically pure and<br>
clean-burning [sulfur-free] diesel-like liquid fuels and high value chemically<br>
pure paraffin-like waxes, without additional fuel or energy. (Figs. 14-18 and<br>
Tables 1, 6 and 7 or Figs. 34-38 and Tables 5, 6 and 7 for adiabatic first stage<br>
reactor operation), or a dimethyl ether synthesis reactor, which operates at<br>
200C and 70 atmospheres pressure. This reactor produces approximately<br>
92.4% DME and 7.1% methanol. The methanol is combusted to co-generate<br>
about 30 MW of electricity and 20fv1W of process heat for exchange with the<br>
molten salt and water/steam heat transfer loops (see Figs. 19-23 and Tables<br>
2, 6 and 7), hydrogen gaseous fuel synthesis (see Figs. 24-28 and Tables 3, 6<br>
and 7), and all electric power production without fuel synthesis (see Figs. 29-<br>
33 and Table 4, 6 and 7).<br><br>
Net export of electric power is possible in all five modes of operation of<br>
the simulated biomass hydro-gasification process plant. The results of these<br>
simulations are summarized in Table 6 and 7. The overall energy utilization<br>
goes from 50.7% (71.2% when adi abatic) for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis to<br>
67.2% for hydrogen production. Optimized electric power production utilizes<br>
about 38.2% of the chemical potential energy in the biomass feed stock for<br>
clean-burning power conversion. In general the process modes could be<br>
switched using an appropriate proportional valve to distribute the synthesis<br>
gas production after separation of enough pure hydrogen gas for the first<br>
stage hydro-gasification reactor.<br><br>
The results of the overall modeling shown in Figure 1 are summarized<br>
as follows.<br><br>
