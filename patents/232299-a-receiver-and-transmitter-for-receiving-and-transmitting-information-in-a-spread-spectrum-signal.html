				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a receiver and transmitter for receiving information in a spread spectrum signal in a data communication system and generally to communication systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Modern data communication systems are evolving to higher bandwidths as the need for information throughput increases. A common manner of achieving higher bandwidth is to utilize parallel channels for transmitting the information. In a system using spread spectrum techniques, for example, more than one pseudonoise (PN) sequence can be generated and used for modulating more than one information data stream, thereby creating multiple parallel channels for the information transmitted via a single radio transmitter.<br>
Prior art receivers for spread spectrum signals transmitted in multiple parallel channels have required corresponding multiple acquisition and tracking loops for despreading the multiple PN sequences to decode the information. The multiple acquisition and tracking loops have added significantly to the cost of the prior art receivers.<br>
Thus, what is needed is a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving information in a multi-channel spread spectrum signal which does not require the expensive multiple acquisition and tracking loops. A method and apparatus is needed that can decode multiple parallel channels by utilizing only a single acquisition and tracking loop.<br>
Accordingly,  there is provided a receiver for receiving information in a spread spectrum signal in a data communication system, the receiver comprising: an   acquisition   and   tracking  element  for  acquiring  and   tracking  a predetermined one of a plurality of transmit pseudonoise sequences that are time-synchronized with one another;<br>
a processor coupled to the acquisition and tracking element for predicting and tracking one of a plurality of predetermined initial states and for adjusting a first pseudonoise sequence generator to generate a selected pseudonoise sequence corresponding to one of the plurality of transmit pseudonoise sequences other than the predetermined one and time-synchronized with the predetermined one; and<br>
the first pseudonoise sequence generator coupled to the processor for<br>
despreading   the   corresponding   one   of   the   plurality   of   transmit<br>
pseudonoise sequences by utilizing the selected pseudonoise sequence<br>
to decode the information.<br>
Accordingly,    there    is    also    provided    a   transmitter    for   transmitting<br>
information as a spread spectrum signal in a data communication system, the<br>
transmitter comprising:<br>
an input interface for receiving a message including the information to be transmit;<br>
a processor coupled to the input interface for processing the information;<br>
a plurality of pseudonoise sequence generators coupled to the processor for being initialized thereby to a plurality of predetermined initial states, wherein the processor controls the plurality of pseudonoise sequence generators to generate a plurality of transmit pseudonoise sequences that are time-synchronized with one another; and<br>
at least one radio frequency (RF) modulator for transmitting the spread spectrum signal after the plurality of transmit pseudonoise sequences are utilized to encode the information.<br>

Described herein below is a cost effective implementation for the transmission and reception of multiple time-synchronized pseudonoise (PN) sequences in a spread spectrum communication system. Two receiver implementations are described that can be used to receive the multiple time-synchronized PN sequences. Prior art spread spectrum receivers have required a dedicated channel to despread each spread spectrum signal. Each spread spectrum signal had to be acquired and tracked separately to successfully despread the signal. The approach described below in accordance with the present invention only requires the acquisition and tracking of a single one of the time-synchronized PN sequences to despread the remaining PN sequences. This approach reduces the complexity of the receiver required to receive two or more spread spectrum signals simultaneously and therefore provides a cost effective implementation.<br>
FIG. 1 is an electrical block diagram of a modular shift register 100 in accordance with the present invention. To simplify the diagram, clock and other control signals well known to one of ordinary skill in the art have been omitted. The modular shift register 100 preferably comprises a plurality of conventional one-bit shift registers 102, coupled to one another through conventional exclusive-OR (XOR) logic circuits 106. A second input of each of the XOR logic circuits 106 is coupled to the output of one of a plurality of conventional two-input AND gates 104. A first input of each of the plurality of AND gates 104 is coupled to the output 108 of the modular shift register 100. A second input of each of the plurality of AND gates 104 is coupled to a value stored in a conventional register (not shown) that represents a tap (discussed further below), which controls the feedback configuration of the modular shift register 100. The modular shift register 100 is configured for generating maximal length linear shift register sequences (or more simply, m-sequences) in a manner well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. It will be appreciated that, alternatively, a simple, continuous shift register type of implementation can also be used to generate m-sequences for this invention. However, since the latter implementation is less time efficient, the modular approach is preferred. Further information on the generation and utilization of m-sequences for<br>
spread spectrum communications is available, for example, in Modern Communications and Spread Spectrum by George R. Cooper and Clare D. McGillem, pp. 289-305 and 326-331, McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1986.<br>
The parameters t  , t j0,..,tjm are referred to as taps and represent the<br>
feedback configuration for the generator.   At time k, the contents of the m<br>
shift  registers  are  denoted   cj0(k),cjI(k),...,cjm    .(k)   from   right   to   left,<br>
respectively. At the next time k +1, the shift register contents are given by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
for j=0,l,...,N-l and k=l,2,..., given the initial conditions c11(0), i=o,i,...,m-i. (N represents the maximum possible number of m-sequences for a given generator size, and will be defined herein below.) By defining cjm = 0, the above expression can be written more compactly as<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
For simplicity, the following unsigned integers are defined<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
period of the m-sequence is given by<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
denote the jth m-sequence of the system.<br>
A sequence with order m has period L = 2m -1 and is said to be an m -sequence with the conditions that the m bit integer cJ(0) is nonzero and that the bits of the m + 1 bit integer t' correspond to an irreducible mth-degree polynomial having coefficients of either zero or one. There are N such integers where N = 1/m{2m -l) and (k) is the number of integers less<br>
than k and relatively prime to k. For a given set of taps, t1, different initial conditions will produce shifted versions of the same m-sequence .<br>
FIG. 2 is a condensed representation of the modular shift register 100. A terminal (CLK) for inputting a clock signal is depicted in FIG. 2 for use in time synchronizing a plurality of the modular shift registers 100 with one another.<br>
FIG. 3 is an electrical block diagram of a spread spectrum transmitter back end 300 in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention. The transmitter back end 300 comprises a 0th m-sequence generator 302 having a 0th initialization bus 328 for initializing the contents of the shift registers 102 with a 0th set of initial values. The 0th m-sequence generator 302 also includes a 0th tap bus 330 for receiving a 0th set of tap values for defining the m-sequence to be generated by the generator 302, and a clock bus 332 for receiving a clock signal. The generator 302 is coupled to a first input of an XOR logic circuit 303, a second input of which is coupled to a 0th data stream bus 311. The output of the XOR logic circuit 303 is coupled to a conventional radio frequency (RF) modulator 304 for generating a spread spectrum radio signal. Alternatively, as an option the transmitter back end 300 can omit the XOR logic circuit 303 and the 0th data stream. This option allows the transmitter back end 300 to send the 0th m-sequence without modulation by any data stream, thereby facilitating acquisition and tracking of the 0th m-sequence in a receiver, as discussed further herein below.<br>
The transmitter back end 300 further comprises a 1st m-sequence generator 306 having a 1st initialization bus 338 for initializing the contents of the shift registers 102 with a 1st set of initial values. The 1st m-sequence generator 306 also includes a 1st tap bus 334 for receiving a 1st set of tap values for defining the m-sequence to be generated by the generator 306, and the clock bus 332 for receiving the clock signal. The generator 306 is coupled to a first input of an XOR logic circuit 308, a second input of which is coupled to a 1st data stream bus 312. The output of the XOR logic circuit 308 is coupled to a conventional RF modulator 310 for generating a spread spectrum radio signal comprising the first data stream spread by the 1st m-sequence .<br>
In addition, the transmitter back end 300 can further comprise additional generators and modulators, up to an (N-l)th m-sequence generator 320 having an (N-l)th initialization bus 340 for initializing the contents of the shift registers 102 with an (N-l)th set of initial values. The (N-l)th m-sequence generator 320 also includes an (N-l)th tap bus 336 for receiving an (N-l)th set of tap values for defining the m-sequence to be generated by the generator 320, and the clock bus 332 for receiving the clock signal. The generator 320 is coupled to a first input of an XOR logic circuit 322, a second input of which is coupled to an (N-l)th data stream bus 326. The output of the XOR logic circuit 322 is coupled to a conventional RF modulator 324 for generating a spread spectrum radio signal comprising the (N-l)th data stream spread by the (N-l)th m-sequence .<br>
The outputs of the RF modulators 304, 310, 324 are summed in a conventional summer 314, which is coupled to a conventional power amplifier 316 and antenna 318 for transmitting the spread spectrum signals. The spread spectrum transmitter back end 300 satisfies the preferred embodiment of this invention with the condition that all of the m -sequences have the m bit integer c;(0) in common, i.e., c°(0)=c1(0)=...=cN_1(0). Subsequently, by the properties of m-sequences, c°(hL)=c1(hL)=...=cN_1(hL) for h=0,l,-, (i.e., the value of cj(h-L) is independent of ;'). The spread spectrum transmitter back end 300 thus transmits multiple time-synchronized spread spectrum signals.<br>
In an alternative embodiment in accordance with the present invention, all of the m-sequences of the transmitter back end 300 do not have the m bit integer cj(0) in common.   At a cost of slightly increased<br>
complexity, some or all of the m bit integers cj(0) can differ from one another. In the alternative embodiment, the initial conditions for each of the m-sequence generators 302, 306, 320 are known by the receiver, so that the relative positions of the m-sequences can be replicated in the receiver. Possible advantages and disadvantages of the alternative embodiment will be discussed further below.<br>
In the spread spectrum transmitter back end 300, the 0tn m-sequence preferably is not modulated with data. This absence of data is not absolutely required, but acquisition of an m-sequence when no data is present is less complex, and thus advantageously faster. In addition, a selection of the value of the m bit integer c°(0) can be made (e.g., through computer simulations) to minimize the magnitude of the cross correlation averaged over every pair of m-sequences. There are N(N-l)/2 of these pairs of m-sequences. The above described selection is preferred, but is not absolutely required in. accordance with the present invention.<br>
To decode multiple spread spectrum signals, a conventional receiver must acquire and track each PN sequence to decode the corresponding data. A prior art serial spread spectrum receiver 400, as shown in FIG. 4 comprises an antenna 402 for intercepting the multiple spread spectrum signals. The antenna 402 is coupled to an RF demodulator 404 for demodulating the multiple spread spectrum signals. The demodulator 404 is coupled to an acquisition and tracking element 406 coupled through a control bus 414 to a jth m-sequence generator 408 for cooperating therewith to acquire and track one of the multiple spread spectrum signals. The receiver 400 cannot decode more than one data stream at a time. Furthermore, in order to decode a different data stream, the receiver 400 must acquire and track the corresponding m-sequence , which takes time.<br>
A prior art parallel spread spectrum receiver 500, as depicted in FIG. 5, can decode multiple spread spectrum signals simultaneously, but requires multiple acquisition and tracking elements 406 and multiple m-sequence generators 408. The additional hardware required by a parallel implementation will significantly increase the cost of the receiver 500.<br>
FIG. 6 is an electrical block diagram of a first embodiment of a spread spectrum communication receiver 600 in accordance with the present invention. The receiver 600 comprises a conventional antenna 602 coupled  to a conventional RF demodulator 604 for intercepting and<br>
demodulating the multiple spread spectrum signals. The demodulator 604 is coupled to a conventional acquisition and tracking element 606, which is coupled by a control bus 614 to a processor 616 for controlling the pseudonoise (PN) sequences generated by a jth m-sequence generator 608 in accordance with the present invention. The generator 608 is coupled to the acquisition and tracking element 606 for providing an m-sequence to compare to the demodulated signals. The processor 616 cooperates with the acquisition and tracking element 606 and the jth m-sequence generator 608 to acquire and track any one of the multiple spread spectrum signals. This is accomplished by acquiring and tracking a predetermined one of the m- sequences and then, coincident with the occurrence of the predetermined initial state of the generator 608, adjusting the taps of the generator 608 to generate any desired PN sequence. The generator 608 is further coupled to a first input of an XOR logic element 610, the second input of which is coupled to the RF demodulator for receiving the multiple spread spectrum signals. The XOR logic element 610 despreads the encoded data stream that corresponds to the m-sequence generated by the generator 608 to produce the corresponding data stream at an output 612.<br>
In the alternative embodiment in accordance with the present invention, in which all of the m-sequences of the transmitter back end 300 do not have the m bit integer c7(0) in common, some m-sequence arrangements require adjusting not only the taps of the generator 608 coincident with the occurrence of the predetermined initial state, but also reloading the initial conditions corresponding to the m-sequence to be generated next. Alternatively, by judiciously picking the initial conditions for the transmitted m sequences, it is possible to arrange for any two m-sequences to have a common set of states in the generator 608 at one or more identical points in the sequence, even though the initial conditions of the two m-sequences are different. In the latter case, only the taps of the generator 608 need be adjusted if the adjustment is made coincident with the point at which the two m-sequences have the common set of states. In addition, the ability to change the m-sequences more frequently than once per period of the 0th m-sequence (without additional calculations) can be advantageous in, for example, a secure system that transmits data in short bursts encoded with different m-sequences.   Various arrangements of the<br>
m -sequences in accordance with the alternative embodiment will be further discussed in conjunction with FIGs. 11-13.<br>
FIG. 7 is an electrical block diagram of a second embodiment of a spread spectrum communication receiver 700 in accordance with the present invention. The receiver 700 has the simplicity of the prior art serial approach along with the speed of the prior art parallel approach. The receiver 700 comprises an antenna 702 and a conventional demodulator 704 for intercepting and demodulating the multiple time-synchronized spread spectrum signals. The demodulator output 706 is coupled to a conventional acquisition and tracking element 710 for acquiring and tracking preferably the 0th m-sequence . The acquisition and tracking element 710 is coupled by a control bus 742 to a processor 712 for controlling the PN sequences generated by a plurality of m-sequence generators 714, 722, 730. The m-sequences are time-synchronized with one another via a common clock signal (CLK) provided by the processor 712.<br>
Preferably, the output 716 of the 0th m-sequence generator 714 is coupled to the acquisition and tracking element 710 for providing the 0th m-sequence to compare to the demodulated signals. First inputs of a plurality of XOR logic elements 718, 726, 734 are coupled to the outputs 716, 724, 732 of the generators 714, 722, 730, respectively. Second inputs of the plurality of XOR logic elements 718, 726, 734 are coupled to the demodulator output 706. The outputs 720, 728, 736 of the plurality of XOR logic elements 718, 726, 734 simultaneously produce the multiple despread data streams. It should be noted that for systems which do not modulate the 0th m-sequence with a data stream, the XOR logic element 718 and the output 720 for the 0th data stream can be omitted. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that, alternatively, elements of the data stream decoder 738 (depicted in the dashed box) can be realized either in a digital signal processor such as the model DSP56100 processor, manufactured by Motorola, Inc. of Schaumburg IL, or as an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). While the receiver 700 is depicted as having all N possible m-sequence generators 714, 722, 730, it will be appreciated that the number of m-sequence generators 714, 722, 730 in the receiver 700 can be less than N if it is not desired to despread all N possible m-sequences simultaneously.<br>
In somewhat more operational detail, the receivers 600, 700 preferably first acquire (co(k)}, that is, the m-sequence with no data, by choosing the feedback configuration corresponding to t°. Alternatively, in the more general setting where data modulates all of the m-sequences, the receivers 600, 700 can acquire whichever sequence is designated to be first.<br>
Once this initial acquisition is complete, data can be demodulated from any of the m-sequences by changing the feedback configuration of the locally generated replica of the m-sequence. Acquisition of subsequent m-sequences is not necessary due to the constraint at the transmitter back end 300 that requires all of the m-sequences to have the same initial condition.<br>
Initially, the locally generated m-sequence has the feedback configuration corresponding to tJ = t° in order to acquire {c00(k)}. As soon as (co(£)} is acquired, cJ(k) is monitored until cj(k) = c°(0) (i.e., until the shift register states represent the initial condition). Once cJ(k) = c°(0), the taps t' can be changed to tj for some ji e{l,2,...,N-l}. The parameter j, corresponds to the m-sequence that the receiver 600, 700 should despread next. The data retrieved from this m-sequence can contain any information including the next value of j„ to use when cJ(k) = c°(0) again. The feedback configuration, of course, does not have to change every period.<br>
In a practical system, monitoring cJ(k)  until  cj(k) = c°(0)   may not<br>
leave enough time to change t' and properly decode the desired data stream. This problem is easily solved by monitoring cJ(k) until ci(k) = c°(hL-a) where a and h are positive integers. The parameter a represents a sufficient length of time to allow tj to take on its next value by the time cJ(k) = c°(hL) = c°(0).<br>
In general, consider the case where the taps are set to t1 = tJn implying that data stream jn is being decoded (jn≠0). Assume the next desired data stream is jn+l. The taps tJ should be changed to t1 =tJ"*[ when cJ(k) = c°(0), With prediction, when c' (k) = cJn (hL - a), it is known that at time a later, ci(k) = ci"(k) = cin(hL) = c0(0). Given a, the value cin(hL-a) depends on tu and c°(0), and is not in general equal to c°(hL-a).<br>
Alternatively, in a system where waiting until c;(k) = c°(hL) = c°(0) to change data streams is an unacceptable delay, the taps t' = tJ" can be changed to tj =tin+1 at any time hL + b, where b and h are positive integers, as long as the contents of the shift registers, cJ(hL + b) = cJn(hL + b), are<br>
changed to cJ(hL + b) = cJn+1 (hL + b) at the same time.  The values cJn+1(hL + b) can be found recursively by using the fact that c0i  n+1 (hL) = c01(0) and<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
If b&gt;\, it takes less computation to use the fact that cj1n+l(hL + L) = c01(0)<br>
and<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
More generally, in the embodiment in which the m -sequences are not required to have the same initial condition, the calculations shown above can still be used with the fact that<br>
It will be appreciated that if the receiver 700 comprises N generators 714, 722, 730 for generating all possible m -sequences, once the taps have been adjusted to synchronize the generators 714, 722, 730, no further adjustment will be necessary. It will be further appreciated that, alternatively, if the receiver 700 has N generators, the taps can be pre-programmed, and the generator clocks for all except the 0th generator 714 held disabled until detection of the predetermined initial condition, to synchronize the generators 714, 722, 730.<br>
It will be further appreciated that in the alternative embodiment in which all of the m -sequences of the transmitter back end 300 do not have the m bit integer cj(0) in common, with some m-sequence arrangements it is required to adjust not only the taps of the generators 714, 722, 730 coincident with the occurrence of the predetermined initial state, but also to reload the initial conditions corresponding to the m-sequence to be generated next. Alternatively, by judiciously picking the initial conditions for the transmitted m-sequences, it is possible to arrange for any two m-sequences to have a common set of states in the generators 714, 722, 730 at one or more identical points in the sequence, even though the initial conditions of the two m-sequences are different. In the latter case, only the taps of the generators 714, 722, 730 need be adjusted if the adjustment is made coincident with the point at which the two m-sequences have the common set of states.<br>
FIG. 8 is an electrical block diagram of a spread spectrum transmitter 800 in accordance with the present invention. The transmitter 800 comprises an input interface 804 coupled, for example, to a public switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN) for receiving messages comprising information to be communicated by the transmitter 800. The transmitter 800 further comprises a conventional processor 802 coupled to the input interface for processing the information. The transmitter 800 further comprises the transmitter back end 300 for transmitting the information as multiple time-synchronized spread spectrum signals in accordance with the present invention. The processor 802 is programmed to control the transmitter back end 300 in accordance with the present invention. The transmitter back end 300 is coupled to the processor 802 by buses 311, 312, and 326-340 for controlling the transmitter back end. It will be appreciated that, alternatively, the buses 311, 312, and 326-340, can be replaced by fewer buses or a single bus by utilizing techniques well known in the art.<br>
FIG. 9 is a flow chart of a method for transmitting information in a spread spectrum signal in accordance with the present invention. The flow chart begins with the processor 802 selecting 902 a plurality of predetermined initial states for the m-sequence generators 302, 306, 320 of the transmitter 800. The plurality of predetermined initial states preferably are ones that minimizes a cross-correlation value averaged over every pair of the plurality of transmitted PN sequences (preferably, m-sequences) to be generated by the m-sequence generators 302, 306, 320. Then the processor 802 initializes 904 the m-sequence generators 302, 306, 320 to the plurality of predetermined initial states. The processor 802 then generates 906 the plurality of transmitted PN sequences in a time-synchronized manner by supplying a common clock signal to the m-sequence generators 302, 306, 320. The transmitter back end 300 then transmits 908 a spread spectrum signal by utilizing the plurality of transmitted PN sequences to encode information. Preferably, one of the plurality of transmitted PN sequences is sent without modulation by the information in order to facilitate acquisition and tracking of the PN sequences.<br>
FIG. 10 is a flow chart of a method for receiving information in a spread spectrum signal in accordance with the present invention. The flow chart begins with the receiver 600, 700 acquiring and tracking 1002. a predetermined PN sequence of the plurality of transmitted PN sequences (preferably, m-sequences). Then the processor 616, 712 predicts and tracks 1004 one of the plurality of predetermined initial states as described herein above.   Then, coincident with an occurrence of the one of the plurality of<br>
predetermined initial states, the processor 616, 712 adjusts 1006 the feedback configuration of a FN sequence generator to generate a selected PN sequence corresponding to one of the plurality of transmitted PN sequences and time-synchronized with the predetermined PN sequence. Depending upon the arrangement of the m-sequences selected for the system, as will be discussed further below, the processor 616, 712 can also load new contents into the modular shift register 100 of the PN sequence generator. The receiver 600, 700 then despreads 1008 the corresponding one of the plurality of transmitted PN sequences by utilizing the selected PN sequence to decode information carried in the selected PN sequence.<br>
Alternatively, following step 1004, at a time different from an occurrence of the one of the plurality of predetermined initial states, the processor 616, 712 can determine a new state for a PN sequence generator 608, 714, 722, 730, the new state corresponding to that of a selected PN sequence at the time. The processor 616, 712 then loads 1012 the PN sequence generator 608, 714, 722, 730 with the new state. The processor also adjusts 1014 feedback configuration of the PN sequence generator 608, 714, 722, 730 to generate the selected PN sequence in time synchronization with the predetermined PN sequence. Flow then proceeds to step 1008 to despread the signal.<br>
FIG. 11 is a table that depicts a first arrangement of the m-sequences in accordance with the present invention. In this arrangement all of the m sequences are constrained to have the same initial conditions. In this example, a PN code of length 31 is used for illustrative purposes. Here the binary contents, O(k), of six five-bit shift registers is given in octal notation. The initial conditions are arbitrarily set to 37 wherein the shift registers are initialized with all one's at time k=0.<br>
If the transmitter 800 is constrained such that all m-sequences have the same initial condition, then transitions from one m-sequence to another require additional calculations to change the m-sequence at other than the beginning of the sequence, i.e. when k=0, as described above.<br>
Additionally, when the shift registers are constrained to have the same initial conditions, the cross correlation performance of the m-sequences is limited to levels achieved by the restricted subset of possible initial conditions.   More flexibility in choosing the initial conditions can<br>
help in achieving the best cross correlation performance possible over a set including all possible initial conditions of the m-sequences.<br>
With slight modifications, the restriction that all m-sequences have the same initial condition need not be applied. What is required is that the relative position of the m-sequences of the transmitter 800 be known so that it can be replicated in the receiver 600, 700. Each m-sequence in the transmitter 800 can have a different initial condition as long as that initial condition is known to the receiver 600, 700. Since the m-sequences are deterministic, then more generally, the locally generated m-sequence shift register can be monitored until a predetermined state is detected, at which time the feedback taps can be changed to generate a different m-sequence , concurrent with a replication of the appropriate initial condition in the receiver 600, 700 which is predetermined from the known relative position of the m-sequences in the transmitter 800.<br>
FIG. 12 depicts another arrangement of the contents of the transmitter shift registers 100 for the same m-sequences as previously shown in FIG. 11. FIG. 12 differs from FIG. 11 in that the restriction that the initial conditions be the same is not imposed. Again, the example code length is 31 and the binary contents, Cjk), of the six shift registers is given in octal notation. The initial conditions are set to C°(0)=23, C1(0)=21, C2(0)=1, C3(0)=17 C4(0)=10, and C5(0)=4.<br>
Given that the initial conditions, Cj(0), are known, consider the m-sequence corresponding to j=0, for example, as applied to the shift register of the m-sequence generator 608 of FIG. 6. If it is desired to switch to the m-sequence corresponding to j=2, then the contents of the shift register are monitored until the contents equal 23, at which time the taps are changed from t° to t and concurrently, the contents of the shift register are changed from 23 to 1. Later, if the m-sequence is to be changed to that corresponding to j=5 so as to despread data stream 5, then the contents of<br>
the shift register are monitored until the contents equal 1, at which time<br>
2      5 the taps are changed from t   to t   and concurrently, the contents of the shift<br>
register are changed from 1 to 4.  In this example, as in the example of FIG.<br>
11, the changes occur at the beginning of the code sequence. The difference<br>
is that the initial conditions of the m-sequences in the transmitter 800 are<br>
not constrained to be equal, and that the contents of the shift registers must<br>
be changed in addition to changing the taps. An advantage achieved by not<br>
constraining the initial conditions to be equal is full freedom to select any initial conditions possible to optimize some system performance parameter such as cross correlation.<br>
As a second example in connection with FIG. 12, it is assumed that the contents of the transmitter shift registers 100 are known for k= 8, k=16, and k=24, in addition to the initial conditions at time k=0. Now consider the m-sequence corresponding to j=0, for example. If it is desired to switch to the m-sequence corresponding to j=2, then the contents of the shift register are monitored until the contents equal 23, 10, 27, or 3, whichever occurs first. Assuming for example that a content equal to 10 is first detected, then the taps are changed from t° to t and concurrently, the contents of the shift register are changed from 10 to 23. Later, if the m-sequence is to be changed to that corresponding to j=5 so as to despread data stream 5, then the contents of the shift register are monitored until the contents equal 1, 23,<br>
16, or 13 whichever occurs first.   Assuming for example that the contents<br>
2      5 reach 16 first, then the taps are changed from t   to t   and concurrently, the<br>
contents of the shift register are changed from 16 to 24.  In like manner, the<br>
taps can be changed during any of the times at which the shift register<br>
contents are known.<br>
This second example advantageously reduces the calculations required to change the m-sequence by making use of a lookup table. It should be apparent that the time taken to change the m-sequence can be reduced further if the receiver 600, 700 stores more information of the transmitter generator contents. At one extreme, the receiver 600, 700 can have knowledge of the contents of the shift registers 100 for all values of k, thereby allowing changing the m-sequence at any time.<br>
FIG. 13 is presented to illustrate a third example arrangement of m-sequences in which the initial conditions are not required to be equal and in which the contents of the shift registers need not be changed to change the m-sequence. This third example is not as flexible as that of the second example in which the shift register contents are also changed, but the receiver 600, 700 hardware advantageously can be made somewhat less complex. The same initial conditions as shown in FIG. 12 are shown in FIG. 13. FIG. 13, however, highlights regions in which the contents of the shift registers for different values of j are the same at the same given values of k.  For this example, the contents of the shift registers for j=l and j=2 are<br>
both equal to 3 at time k=l. Consequently, the feedback taps can be changed from t1 to t2 upon detection of a shift register content equal to 3 without changing the contents of the shift register. As an example, a single channel in the receiver 600, 700 can despread data streams ... 0,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 0,1,... in cyclic order in the following manner. Beginning with the m-sequence for j=0, the shift register is monitored until the contents equal 7, at which time the tap feedback configuration is changed from t0 to t1 . At a later time, the shift register is monitored until the contents equal 6, for example, at which time the tap feedback configuration is changed from t1 to t2. Still later, the taps are changed from t2 to t3 when the shift register contents equal 23, and then later from t3 to t4 when the shift register contents equal 1. In like manner, the taps change from t4 to t5 when the shift register contents equal 17, and from t5 back to t0 when the shift register contents equal 25. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that many other variations in the arrangement of the m-sequences can be made in accordance with the present invention, depending upon desired system objectives.<br>
Thus, it should be apparent by now that the present invention provides a method and apparatus for transmitting and receiving information in a multi-channel spread spectrum signal which does not require expensive multiple acquisition and tracking loops. The method and apparatus advantageously can simultaneously decode multiple parallel time-synchronized PN sequences by utilizing only a single acquisition and tracking loop.<br><br><br><br><br>
