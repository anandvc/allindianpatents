				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>In recognition of the need to develop novel therapeutic agents, the present invention provides novel histone deacetylase inhibitors. These compounds include an ester bond making them sensitive to deactivation by esterases. Therefore, these compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of skin disorders. When the compounds reaches the bloodstream, an esterase or an enzyme with esterase activity cleaves the compound into biologically inactive fragments or fragments with greatly reduced activity Ideally these degradation products exhibit a short serum and/or systemic half-life and are eliminated rapidly. These compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are particularly useful in treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, neurofibromatosis , psoriasis, hair loss, skin pigmentation, and dermatitis, for example. The present invention also provides methods for preparing compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto.</td>

[0001] The present invention claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119(e) to U.S. provisional<br>
patent application, USSN 60/773,172, filed February 14, 2006, which is incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] The identification of small organic molecules that affect specific biological<br>
functions is an endeavor that impacts both biology and medicine. Such molecules are useful<br>
as therapeutic agents and as probes of biological function. In but one example from the<br>
emerging field of chemical genetics, in which small molecules can be used to alter the<br>
function of biological molecules to which they bind, these molecules have been useful at<br>
elucidating signal transduction pathways by acting as chemical protein knockouts, thereby<br>
causing a loss of protein function (Schreiber et al, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1990,112, 5583;<br>
Mitchison, Chem. and Biol., 1994,1,3). Additionally, due to the interaction of these small<br>
molecules with particular biological targets and their ability to affect specific biological<br>
function, they may also serve as candidates for the development of therapeutics. One<br>
important class of small molecules, natural products, which are small molecules obtained<br>
from nature, clearly have played an important role in the development of biology and<br>
medicine, serving as pharmaceutical leads, drugs (Newman et al., Nat. Prod. Rep. 2000,17,<br>
215-234), and powerful reagents for studying cell biology (Schreiber, S.L. Chem. and Eng.<br>
News 1992 (October 26), 22-32).<br>
[0003] Because it is difficult to predict which small molecules will interact with a<br>
biological target, and it is oftent difficult to obtain and synthesize efficiently small molecules<br>
found in nature, intense efforts have been directed towards the generation of large numbers,<br>
or libraries, of small organic compounds, often "natural product-like" libraries. These<br>
libraries can then be linked to sensitive screens for a particular biological target of interest to<br>
identify the active molecules.<br>
[0004] One biological target of recent interest is histone deacetylase (see, for example, a<br>
discussion of the use of inhibitors of histone deacetylases for the treatment of cancer: Marks<br>
et al. Nature Reviews Cancer 2001,1,194; Johnstone et al. Nature Reviews Drug Discovery<br>
2002, /, 287). Post-translational modification of proteins through acetylarion and<br><br>
deacetylation of lysine residues has a critical role in regulating their cellular functions.<br>
HDACs are zinc hydrolases that modulate gene expression through deacetylation of the N-<br>
acetyl-lysine residues of histone proteins and other transcriptional regulators (Hassig et al.<br>
Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol 1997,1, 300-308). HDACs participate in cellular pathways that<br>
control cell shape and differentiation, and an HDAC inhibitor has been shown effective in<br>
treating an otherwise recalcitrant cancer (Warrell et al. J. Nail. Cancer Inst. 1998, 90, 1621 -<br>
1625). Eleven human HDACs, which use Zn as a cofactor, have been characterized (Taunton<br>
et al. Science 1996, 272, 408-411; Yang et al J. Biol. Chem. 1997,272, 28001-28007;<br>
Grozinger et al. Proc. Natl. Acad Sd. U.S.A. 1999,96,4868-4873; Kao et al. Genes Dev.<br>
2000,14, 55-66; Hu et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2000, 275, 15254-15264;; Zhou et al. Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Set U.S.A. 2001,98, 10572-10577; Venter et al. Science 2001, 291,1304-1351).<br>
These members fall into three related classes (class I, II, and ID). An additional seven<br>
HDACs have been identified which use NAD as a confactor. To date, no small molecules are<br>
known that selectively target either the two classes or individual members of this family ((for<br>
example ortholog-selective HDAC inhibitors have been reported: (a) Meinke et al. J. Med.<br>
Chem. 2000,14, 4919-4922; (b) Meinke, et al. Curr. Med Chem. 2001, 8, 211-235).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0005] The present invention provides novel histone deacetylase inhibitors and methods<br>
of preparing and using these compounds. The inventive HDAC inhibitors comprise an<br>
esterase-senshive ester linakge, thereby when the compound is exposed to an esterase such as<br>
in the bloodstream the compound is inactivated. The compounds are particularly useful in<br>
the treatment of skin disorders such as cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, neurofibromatosis,<br>
psoriasis, hair loss, dermatitis, baldness, and skin pigmentation. The inventive compound is<br>
adminitered topically to the skin of the patient where it is clinically active. Once the<br>
compound is absoRBed into the body, it is quickly inactivated by esterases which cleave the<br>
compound into two or more biologically inactive fragments. Thus, allowing for high local<br>
concentrations (e.g., in the skin) and reduced systemic toxicity. In certain embodiments, the<br>
compound is fully cleaved upon exposure to serum in less than 5 min., preferably less than 1<br>
mm.<br>
[0006] The present invention provides novel compounds of general formula (I),<br><br><br>
and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, as described generally and in subclasses herein,<br>
which compounds are useful as inhibitors of histone deacetylases or other deacetylases, and<br>
thus are useful for the treatment of proliferative diseases. The inventive compounds are<br>
additionally useful as tools to probe biological function. In certain embodiments, the<br>
compounds of the ivention are particularly useful in the treatment of skin disorders. The ester<br>
linkage is susceptible to esterase cleavage, particularly esterases found in the blood.<br>
Therefore, these compounds may be administered topically to treat skin disorders, such as<br>
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, psoriasis, hair loss, dermatitis, etc., without the risk of systemic<br>
effects. Once the compound enters the bloodstream it is quickly degraded by serum<br>
esterases. Preferably, the compound is degraded into non-toxic, biologically inactive by products.<br>
[0007] In another aspect, the present invention provides methods for inhibiting histone<br>
deacetylase activity or other deacetylase activity in a patient or a biological sample,<br>
comprising administering to said patient, or contacting said biological sample with an<br>
effective inhibitory amount of a compound of the invention. In certain embodiments, the<br>
compounds specifically inhibit a particular HDAC (e.g., HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3,<br>
HDAC4, HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC6, HDAC7, HDAC8, HDAC9, HDAC10, HDAC11) or<br>
class of HDACs (e.g., Class I, IE, or HE). In certain embodiments, the compounds specifically<br>
inhibit HDAC6. In still another aspect, the present invention provides methods for treating<br>
skin disorders involving histone deacetylase activity, comprising administering to a subject in<br>
need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of the invention. The<br>
compounds may be administered by any method known in the art. In certain embodiments,<br>
the compounds are administered topically (e.g., in a cream, lotion, ointment, spray, gel,<br>
powder, etc.). In certain embodiments, the compound is administered to skin. In other<br>
certain embodiments, the compound is administered to hair. The compounds may also be<br>
administered intravenously or orally. The invention also provides pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the compounds wherein the compound is combined with a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable excipient.<br>
[0008] In yet another aspect, the present invention provides methods for preparing<br>
compounds of the invention and intermediates thereof.<br>
Definitions<br>
[0009] Certain compounds of the present invention, and definitions of specific functional<br>
groups are also described in more detail below. For purposes of 1his invention, the chemical<br><br>
elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table of the Elements, CAS version,<br>
Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed., inside cover, and Specific functional groups<br>
are generally defined as described therein. Additionally, general principles of organic<br>
chemistry, as well as specific functional moieties and reactivity, are described in Organic<br>
Chemistry, Thomas Sorrell, University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, the entire contents of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, it will be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that the synthetic methods, as described herein, utilize a variety of<br>
protecting groups. By the term "protecting group," has used herein, it is meant that a<br>
particular functional moiety, e.g., C, O, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so that a reaction can<br>
be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a multifunctional compound. In preferred<br>
embodiments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate<br>
that is stable to the projected reactions; the protecting group must be selectively removed in<br>
good yield by readily available, preferably nontoxic reagents that do not attack the other<br>
functional groups; the protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably<br>
without the generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum<br>
of additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction. As detailed herein, oxygen,<br>
sulfur, nitrogen and caRBon protecting groups may be utilized. Exemplary protecting groups<br>
are detailed herein, however, it will be appreciated that the present invention is not intended<br>
to be limited to these protecting groups; rather, a variety of additional equivalent protecting<br>
groups can be readily identified using the above criteria and utilized in the method of the<br>
present invention. Additionally, a variety of protecting groups ares described in Protective<br>
Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Ed. Greene, T.W. and Wuts, P.G., Eds., John Wiley &amp;<br>
Sons, New York: 1999, the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Furthermore, a variety of caRBon protecting groups are described in Myers, A.; Rung, D. W.;<br>
Zhong, B.; Movassaghi, M.; Kwon, S. J. Am Chem. Soc. 1999,121, 8401-8402, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>

For purposes of this invention, heteroatoms such as nitrogen may liave hydrogen substituents<br>
and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described herein which satisfy the<br>
valencies of the heteroatoms. Furthermore, this invention is not intended to be limited in any<br>
manner by the permissible substituents of organic compounds. Combinations of substituents<br>

satisfying the Huckel rale where the number of pi electrons in the ling is (4n+2) wherein n is<br>
an integer. A mono- or polycyclic, unsaturated moiety that does not satisfy one or all of these<br>
criteria for aromaticity is defined herein as "non-aromatic", and is encompassed by the term<br>
"alicyclic".<br>
[0019] In general, the term "heteroaromatic moiety", as used herein, refers to a stable<br>
mono- or polycyclic, unsaturated moiety having preferably 3-14 caRBon atoms, each of which<br>
may be substituted or unsubstituted; and comprising at least one heteroatom selected from O,<br>
S and N within the ring (i.e., in place of a ring caRBon atom). In certain embodiments, the<br>
term "heteroaromatic moiety" refers to a planar ring comprising at least on heteroatom,<br>
having p-oRBitals perpendicular to the plane of the ring at each ring atom, and satisfying the<br>

[0020] It will also be appreciated that aromatic and heteroaromatic moieties, as defined<br>
herein may be attached via an alkyl or heteroalkyl moiety and thus also include -<br>
(a]kyl)aromatic, -(heteroalkyl)aromatic, -(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic, and -<br>
(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic moieties. Thus, as used herein, the plirases "aromatic or<br>
heteroaromatic moieties" and "aromatic, heteroaromatic, -(alkyl)airomatic, -<br>
(heteroalkyl)aromatic, -(heteroalkyl)heteroarornatic, and -(heteroalkyl)heteroaromatic" are<br>
interchangeable. Substitueuts include, but are not limited to, any of the previously mentioned<br>

meaning of the term in the art, and refers to an unsaturated cyclic moiety comprising at least<br>
one aromatic ring. In certain embodiments, "aryl" refers to a mono- or bicyclic caRBocyclic<br>
ring system having one or two aromatic rings including, but not limited to, phenyl, naphthyl,<br>
tetrahydronaphthyl, indanyl, indenyl and the like.<br>

common meaning of the term in the art, and refers to a cyclic aromatic radical having from<br>
five to ten ring atoms of which one ring atom is selected from S, C) and N; zero, one or two<br>
ring atoms are additional heteroatoms independently selected from S, O and N; and the<br>
remaining ring atoms are caRBon, the radical being joined to the rest of the molecule via any<br>
of the ring atoms, such as, for example, pyridyl, pyrazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl,<br>

compounds, and materials and methods for derivatizing the parent compounds to create the<br>
pro-drugs, are known and may be adapted to the present invention. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives also include "reverse pro-drugs." Reverse pro-drugs, rather than being<br>
activated, are inactivated upon absorption. For example, as discussed herein, many of the<br>
ester-containing compounds of the invention are biologically active but are inactivated upon<br>
exposure to certain physiological environments such as a blood, lymph, serum, extracellular<br>
fluid, etc. which contain esterase activity. The biological activity of reverse pro-drugs and<br>
pro-drugs may also be altered by appending a functionality onto the compound, which may<br>
be catalyzed by an enzyme. Also, included are oxidation and reduction reactions, including<br>

[0037] Unless indicated otherwise, the terms defined below have the following meanings:<br>
[0038] "Compound": The term "compound" or "chemical compound" as used herein can<br>
include organometallic compounds, organic compounds, metals, transitional metal<br>
complexes, and small molecules. In certain preferred embodiments, polynucleotides are<br>
excluded from the definition of compounds. In other preferred embodiments,<br>
polynucleotides and peptides are excluded from the definition of compounds. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, the term compounds refers to small molecules (e.g.,<br>
preferably, non-peptidic and non-oligomeric) and excludes peptides, polynucleotides,<br>
transition metal complexes, metals, and organometallic compounds.<br>
[0039] "Small Molecule": As used herein, the term "small molecule" refers to a non-<br>
peptidic, non-oligomeric organic compound either synthesized in the laboratory or found in<br>
nature. Small molecules, as used herein, can refer to compounds that are "natural product-<br>
like", however, the term "small molecule" is not limited to "natural product-like"<br>
compounds. Rather, a small molecule is typically characterized in that it contains several<br>
caRBon-caRBon bonds, and has a molecular weight of less than 2000 g/mol, preferably less<br>
than 1500 g/mol, although this characterization is not intended to be limiting for the purposes<br>
of the present invention. Examples of "small molecules" that occur in nature include, but are<br>
not limited to, taxol, dynemicin, and rapamycin. Examples of "small molecules" mat are<br>
synthesized in the laboratory include, but are not limited to, compounds described in Tan et<br><br>
al,, ("Stereoselective Synthesis of over Two Million Compounds Having Structural Features<br>
Both Reminiscent of Natural Products and Compatible with Miniaturized Cell-Based Assays"<br>
J. Am. Chem. Soc. 120:8565, 1998; incorporated herein by reference). In certain other<br>
preferred embodiments, natural-product-like small molecules are utilized.<br>
[0040] "Natural Product-Like Compound": As used herein, the term "natural product-<br>
like compound" refers to compounds that are similar to complex natural products which<br>
nature has selected through evolution. Typically, these compounds contain one or more<br>
stereocenters, a high density and diversity of functionality, and a diverse selection of atoms<br>
within one structure. In this context, diversity of functionality can. be defined as varying the<br>
topology, charge, size, hydrophilicity, hydrophobicity, and reactivity to name a few, of the<br>
functional groups present in the compounds. The term, "high density of functionality", as<br>
used herein, can preferably be used to define any molecule that contains preferably three or<br>
more latent or active divers ifiable functional moieties. These structural characteristics may<br>
additionally render the inventive compounds functionally reminiscent of complex natural<br>
products, in that they may interact specifically with a particular biological receptor, and thus<br>
may also be functionally natural product-like.<br>
[0041] "Metal chelator": As used herein, the term "metal chelator" refers to any<br>
molecule or moiety that is is capable of forming a complex (i.e., "chelates") with a metal ion.<br>
In certain exemplary embodiments, a metal chelator refers to to any molecule or moiety that<br>
"binds" to a metal ion, in solution, making it unavailable for use in chemical/enzymatic<br>
reactions. In certain embodiments, the solution comprises aqueous environments under<br>
physiological conditions. Examples of metal ions include, but are not limited to, Ca2+, Fe3+,<br>
Zn2+, Na+, etc. In certain embodiments, the metal chelator binds Zr,n2+. In certain<br>
embodiments, molecules of moieties that precipitate metal ions are not considered to be metal<br>
chelators.<br>
[0042] As used herein the term "biological sample" includes, without limitation, cell<br>
cultures or extracts thereof; biopsied material obtained from an animal (e.g., mammal) or<br>
extracts thereof; and blood, saliva, urine, feces, semen, tears, or other body fluids or extracts<br>
thereof. For example, the term "biological sample" refers to any solid or fluid sample<br>
obtained from, excreted by or secreted by any living organism, including single-celled micro-<br>
organisms (such as bacteria and yeasts) and multicellutar organisms (such as plants and<br>
animals, for instance a vertebrate or a mammal, and in particular a. healthy or apparently<br>
healthy human subject or a human patient affected by a condition or disease to be diagnosed<br>
or investigated). The biological sample can be in any form, including a solid material such as<br><br>
a tissue, cells, a cell pellet, a cell extract, cell homogenates, or cell fractions; or a biopsy, or a<br>
biological fluid. The biological fluid may be obtained from any site (e.g., blood, saliva (or a<br>
mouth wash containing buccal cells), tears, plasma, serum, urine, bile, cerebrospinal fluid,<br>
amniotic fluid, peritoneal fluid, andpleural fluid, or cells therefrom, aqueous or vitreous<br>
humor, or any bodily secretion), atransudate, an exudate {e.g. fluid obtained from an abscess<br>
or any other site of infection or inflammation), or fluid obtained from a joint (e.g. a normal<br>
joint or a joint affected by disease such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, gout or septic<br>
arthritis). The biological sample can be obtained from any organ or tissue (including a biopsy<br>
or autopsy specimen) or may comprise cells (whether primary cells or cultured cells) or<br>
medium conditioned by any cell, tissue or organ. Biological samples may also include<br>
sections of tissues such as frozen sections taken for histological purposes. Biological samples<br>
also include mixtures of biological molecules including proteins, lipids, caRBohydrates and<br>
nucleic acids generated by partial or complete fractionation of cell or tissue homogenates.<br>
Although the sample is preferably taken from a human subject, biological samples may be<br>
from any animal, plant, bacteria, virus, yeast, etc. The term animal, as used herein, refers to<br>
humans as well as non-human animals, at any stage of development, including, for example,<br>
mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, worms and single cells. Cell cultures and live<br>
tissue samples are considered to be pluralities of animals. In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
the non-human animal is a mammal (e.g., a rodent, a mouse, a rat, a rabbit, a monkey, a dog,<br>
a cat, a sheep, cattle, a primate, or a pig). An animal may be a transgenic animal or a human<br>
clone. If desired, the biological sample may be subjected to preliminary processing,<br>
including preliminary separation techniques.<br>

the gamma-delta subset Transgenic mice overexpressing IL-7 in keratinocytes were<br>
developed by the laboratories of Thomas Kupper and Benjamin Rich, using a tissue-specific<br>
keratin-14 promoter element These mice have been reported to develop a characteristic<br>
lymphoproliferative skin disease grossly and histologically similar to human cutaneous T-cell<br>
lymphoma (CTCL). Transformed lymphocytes derived from involved skin were passaged ex<br>
vivo and injected into syngeneic (non-transgenic) mice. After fourteen days, these mice<br>
develop a homogeneous lymphoproliferative disease. Two cohorts of five mice were<br>
included in a prospective study of topical, daily suberoyl hydroxamic acid phenyl ester<br>
(SAHP, also known as SHAPE) versus vehicle control. After fourteen days of therapy, mice<br>
were sacrificed and the treated region was dissected for histopathologic examination. In<br>

hyperacetylation.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0058] As discussed above, there remains a need for the development of novel histone<br>
deacetylase inhibitors. The present invention provides novel compounds of general formula<br>

the inventive compounds comprise an ester linkage. The ester linkage is preferably sensitive<br>
to esterase cleavage; therefore, when the compound is contacted •with an esterase it is<br>
deactivated.<br>

infections.<br>
[00126] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can<br>
exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of<br>
such esters, or a pro-drug or other adduct or derivative of a compound of this invention which<br>
upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[00127] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts<br>
which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the<br>
tissues of humans and lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response and<br>
the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts of amines, caRBoxylic acids, and other types of compounds, are well known<br>
in the art. For example, S.M. Berge, et al. describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in<br>
detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66: 1-19(1977), incorporated herein by reference. The<br>
salts can be prepared in situ during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of<br>
the invention, or separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable<br>
reagent, as described generally below. For example, a free base function can be reacted with a<br>
suitable acid. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic moiety,<br>
suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, include metal salts such as alkali<br>
metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal salts, e.g. calcium or<br>
magnesium salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, nontoxic acid addition salts are<br>
salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic<br>
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic<br>
acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by<br>
using other methods used in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
salts include adipate, alginate, ascoRBate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate,<br>
borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate,<br>

naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate, oxalate, pahnitate, pamoate, pectinate,<br>
persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate, picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate,<br>
sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-toluenesulfonate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.<br>
Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium,<br>
calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include, when<br>
appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations formed using<br><br>
ccranterions such as halide, hydroxide, caRBoxylate, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, loweralkyl<br>
sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
[00128] Additionally, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable ester" refers<br>
to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily in the human body<br>
to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester groups include, for example,<br>
those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic caRBoxylic acids, particularly<br>
alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids, in which each alkyl or alkenyl<br>
moeity advantageously has not more than 6 caRBon atoms. Examples of particular esters<br>
include formates, acetates, propionates, butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.<br>
[00129] Furthermore, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used herein<br>
refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are, within the<br>
scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the issues of humans and<br>
lower animals with, undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response, and the like, commensurate<br>
with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their intended use, as well as the<br>
zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of the invention. The term "prodrug"<br>
refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of the<br>
above formula, for example by hydrolysis in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T.<br>

oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils),<br>
glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of soRBitan,<br>
and mixtures thereof. Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants<br>
such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and<br>
perfuming agents.<br>
[00132] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous<br>
suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or<br>
wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation may also be a sterile<br>
injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic parenterally acceptable diluent or<br>
solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and<br>
solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium<br>
chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or<br>
suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including<br>
synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the<br>
preparation of injectables.<br>
[00133] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a<br>
bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid<br><br>
compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable<br>
medium prior to use.<br>
[00134] In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption<br>
of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be accomplished by the<br>
use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility.<br>
The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of dissolution that, in turn, may<br>
depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, delayed absorption of a<br>
parenterally administered drug form is accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drag in<br>
an oil vehicle. Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the<br>
drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio<br>
of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release<br>
can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include (poly(orthoesters) and<br>
poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the drag in<br>
liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
[00135] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories<br>
which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating<br>
excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which<br>
are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the<br>
rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
[00136] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills,<br>
powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is mixed with at<br>
least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as sodium citrate or<br>
dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches, lactose, sucrose, glucose,<br>
mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example, caRBoxymethylcelklose, alginates,<br>
gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d)<br>
disintegrating agents such as agar-agar, calcium caRBonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic<br>
acid, certain silicates, and sodium caRBonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f)<br>
absorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as,<br>
for example, cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absoRBents such as kaolin and<br>
bentonite clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid<br>
polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[00137] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and<br>
hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as well as high<br><br>
molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage forms of tablets,<br>
dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art They may<br>
optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the<br>
active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally,<br>
in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include<br>
polymeric substances and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed<br>
as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar<br>
as well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[00138] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with one or more<br>
excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and<br>
granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings, release controlling<br>
coatings and other coatings well known in the pharmaceutical formulating art In such solid<br>
dosage forms the active compound may be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as<br>
sucrose, lactose and starch. Such dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice,<br>
additional substances other than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting<br>
aids such as magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules,<br>
tablets and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally<br>
contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active<br>
ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a<br>
delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used include polymeric<br>
substances and waxes.<br>
[00139] The present invention encompasses pharmaceutically acceptable topical<br>
formulations of inventive compounds. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable topical<br>
formulation", as used herein, means any formulation which is pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
for intradermal administration of a compound of the invention by application of the<br>
formulation to the epidermis. In certain embodiments of the invention, the topical<br>
formulation comprises a carrier system. Pharmaceutically effective carriers include, but are<br>
not limited to, solvents (eg., alcohols, poly alcohols, water), creams, lotions, ointments, oils,<br>
plasters, liposomes, powders, emulsions, microemulsions, and buffered solutions (e.g.,<br>
liypotonic or buffered saline) or any other carrier known in the ait for topically administering<br>
Pharmaceuticals. A more complete listing of art-known carriers is provided by reference<br>
texts that are standard in the art, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 16th<br>
Edition, 1980 and 17th Edition, 1985, both published by Mack Publishing Company, Easton,<br><br>
Pennsylvania, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in theix entireties.<br>
In certain other embodiments, the topical formulations of the invention may comprise<br>
excipients. Any pharmaceutically acceptable excipient known in the art may be used to<br>
prepare the inventive pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations. Examples of<br>
excipients that can be included in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, preservatives, antioxidants, moisturizers, emollients, buffering agents,<br>
solubilizing agents, other penetration agents, skin protectants, surfactants, and propellants,<br>
and/or additional therapeutic agents used in combination to the inventive compound. Suitable<br>
preservatives include, but are not limited to, alcohols, quaternary amines, organic acids,<br>
parabens, and phenols. Suitable antioxidants include, but are not limited to, ascoRBic acid and<br>
its esters, sodium bisulfite, butylated hydroxytoluene, butylated hydroxyanisole, tocopherols,<br>
and chelating agents like EDTA and citric acid. Suitable moisturizers include, but are not<br>
limited to, glycerine, soRBitol, polyethylene glycols, urea, and propylene glycol. Suitable<br>
buffering agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, citric, hydrochloric,<br>
and lactic acid buffers. Suitable solubilizing agents include, but are not limited to, quaternary<br>
ammonium chlorides, cyclodextrins, benzyl benzoate, lecithin, and polysoRBates. Suitable<br>
skin protectants that can be used in the topical formulations of the invention include, but are<br>
not limited to, vitamin E oil, allatoin, dimethicone, glycerin, petrolatum, and zinc oxide.<br>
[00140] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutically acceptable topical formulations of<br>
the invention comprise at least a compound of the invention and a penetration enhancing<br>
agent. The choice of topical formulation will depend or several factors, including the<br>
condition to be treated, the physicochemical characteristics of the inventive compound and<br>
other excipients present, their stability in the formulation, available manufacturing<br>
equipment, and costs constraints. As used herein the term "penetration enhancing agent"<br>
means an agent capable of transporting a pharmacologically active compound through the<br>
stratum corneum and into the epidermis or dermis, preferably, with little or no systemic<br>
absorption. A wide variety of compounds have been evaluated as to their effectiveness in<br>
enhancing the rate of penetration of drugs through the skin. See, for example, Percutaneous<br>
Penetration Enhancers, Maibach H. I. and Smith H. E. (eds.), CB.C Press, Inc., Boca Raton,<br>
Fla. (1995), which surveys the use and testing of various skin penetration enhancers, and<br>
Buyuktiinkin et ai, Chemical Means of Transdermal Drug Permeation Enhancement in<br>
Transdermal and Topical Drug Delivery Systems, Gosh T. K., Pf ister W. R., Yum S. I.<br>
(Eds.), tnterpharm Press Inc., Buffalo Grove, 111. (1997). In certain exemplary embodiments,<br>
penetration agents for use with the invention include, but are not limited to, triglycerides<br><br>
(e.g., soybean oil), aloe compositions (e.g., aloe-vera gel), ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
octolyphenylpolyethylene glycol, oleic acid, polyethylene glycol '100, propylene glycol, N-<br>
decylmethylsulfoxide, fatty acid esters (e.g., isopropyl myristate, methyl laurate, glycerol<br>
monooleate, and propylene glycol monooleate), and N-methyl pyrrolidone.<br>
[00141] In certain embodiments, the compositions may be in the form of ointments, pastes,<br>
creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions, sprays, inhalants or patches. In certain exemplary<br>
embodiments, formulations of the compositions according to the invention are creams, which<br>
may further contain saturated or unsaturated fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid,<br>
oleic acid, palmito-oleic acid, cetyl or oleyl alcohols, stearic acid being particularly preferred.<br>
Creams of the invention may also contain a non-ionic surfactant, for example, polyoxy-40-<br>
stearate. In certain embodiments, the active component is admixed under sterile conditions<br>
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or buffers as may be<br>
required. Ophthalmic formulation, eardrops, and eye drops are also contemplated as being<br>
within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the present invention contemplates the use<br>
of transdermal patches, which have the added advantage of providing controlled delivery of a<br>
compound to the body. Such dosage forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the<br>
compound in the proper medium. As discussed above, penetration enhancing agents can also<br>
be used to increase the flux of the compound across the skin. The rate can be controlled by<br>
either providing a rate controlling membrane or by dispersing the compound in a polymer<br>
matrix or gel.<br>
[00142] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
of the present invention can be formulated and employed in combination therapies, that is, the<br>
compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated with or administered<br>
concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one or more other desired therapeutics or<br>
medical procedures. The particular combination of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to<br>
employ in a combination regimen will take into account compatibility of the desired<br>
therapeutics and/or procedures and the desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also<br>
be appreciated that the therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder<br>
(for example, an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another<br>
immunotnodulatory agent, anticancer agent or agent useful for the treatment of psoriasis), or<br>
they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects).<br>
[00143] For example, other therapies or anticancer agents that may be used in combination<br>
with the inventive compounds of the present invention include surgery, radiotherapy (in but a<br><br>
few examples, y-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam radiotherapy, proton<br>
therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes, to name a few), endocrine therapy,<br>
biologic response modifiers (interferons, interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to<br>
name a few), hyperthermia and cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g.,<br>
antiemetics), and other approved chemotherapeutic drugs, including, but not limited to,<br>
alkylating drugs (mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Melphalan,<br>
Ifosfamide), antimetabolites (Methotrexate), purine antagonists and pyrimidine antagonists<br>
(6-Mercaptopurine, 5-Fhiorouracil, Cytarabile, Gemcitabine), spindle poisons (Vinblastine,<br>
Vincristine, Vinorelbine, Paclitaxel), podophyllotoxins (Etoposide, Irinotecan, Topotecan),<br>
antibiotics (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Mitomycin), nitrosoureas (Carmustine, Lomustine),<br>
inorganic ions (Cisplatin, CaRBoplatin), enzymes (Asparaginase), and hormones (Tamoxifen,<br>
Leuprolide, Flutamide, and Megestrol), to name a few. For a more comprehensive discussion<br>
of updated cancer therapies see, The Merck Manual, Seventeenth Ed, 1999, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. See also the National Cancer<br>
Institute (CNI) website (www.nci.nih.gov) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)<br>
website for a list of the FDA approved oncology drugs<br>
(www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/druglistframe).<br>
[00144] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention<br>
further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active ingredients (e.g.,<br>
chemotherapeutic and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention, the term "palliative"<br>
refers to treatment that is focused on the relief of symptoms of a disease and/or side effects of<br>
a therapeutic regimen, but is not curative. For example, palliative treatment encompasses<br>
painkillers, antinausea medications and anti-sickness drugs. In addition, chemotherapy,<br>
radiotherapy and surgery can all be used palliatively (that is, to reduce symptoms without<br>
going for cure; e.g., for shrinking tumors and reducing pressure, bleeding, pain and other<br>
symptoms of cancer).<br>
[00145] Additionally, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives of the inventive compounds, and methods of treating a subject using these<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, or either of these in combination with one<br>
or more additional therapeutic agents.<br>
[00146] It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds of present invention can<br>
exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
derivative includes, but is not limited to, pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of<br>
such esters, or a prodrug or other adduct or derivative of a compoxind of this invention which<br>
upon administration to a patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a<br>
compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>

Phannaceutical Uses and Methods of Treatment<br>
[00150] In general, methods of using the compounds of the present invention comprise<br>
administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br>
of the present invention. The compounds of the invention are generally inhibitors of<br>
deacetyalse activity. As discussed above, the compounds of the invention are typically<br>
inhibitors of histone deacetylases and, as such, are useful in the treatment of disorders<br>
modulated by histone deacetylases. Other deacetylase such as tubulin deacetylases may also<br>
be inhibited by the inventive compounds.<br>
[00151] In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention are useful in the treatment of<br>
proliferative diseases {e.g., cancer, benign neoplasms, inflammatory disease, autoimmune<br>
diseases). In certain embodiments, given the esterase sensitive ester linkage in the<br>
compounds of the invention, they are particularly useful in treating skin disorders modulated<br>
by histone deacetyalses where systemic effects of the drug are to be avoided or at least<br>
minimized. This feature of the inventive compounds may allow the use of compounds<br>
normally too toxic for administration to a subject systemically. In certain embodiments,<br>
these skin disorders are proliferative disorders. For example, the inventive compounds are<br>
particularly useful in the treatment of skin cancer and benign skin tumors. In certain<br>
embodiments, the compounds are useful in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. In<br>
certain embodiments, the compounds are useful in the treatment of neurofibromatosis.<br>
Accordingly, in yet another aspect, according to the methods of treatment of the present<br>
invention, tumor cells are killed, or their growth is inhibited by contacting said tumor cells<br>
with an inventive compound or composition, as described herein. In other embodiments, the<br>
compounds are useful in treating inflammatory diseases of the skin such as psoriasis or<br>
dermatitis. In other embodiments, the compounds are useful in the treatment or prevention of<br>
hair loss. In certain embodiments, the compounds are useful in the treatment of diseases<br>
associated with skin pigmentation. For example, the compounds may be used to prevent the<br>
hyperpigmentation of skin.<br>
[00152] Thus, in another aspect of the invention, methods for the treatment of cancer are<br>
provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an inventive<br><br>
compound, as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain embodiments, a<br>
method for the treatment of cancer is provided comprising administering atherapeutically<br>
effective amount of an inventive compound, or a pharmaceutical composition comprising an<br>
inventive compound to a subject in need thereof, in such amounts and for such time as is<br>
necessary to achieve the desired result. Preferably, the inventive compounds is administered<br>
topically. In certain embodiments of the present invention a "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition is that amount effective<br>
for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. The compound!? and compositions,<br>
according to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and<br>
any route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the growth of tumor cells. Thus,<br>
the expression "amount effective to kill or inhibit the growth of tumor cells," as used herein,<br>
refers to a sufficient amount of agent to Mil or inhibit the growth of tumor cells. The exact<br>
amount required will vary from subject to subject, depending on the species, age, and general<br>
condition of the subject, the severity of the infection, the particular anticancer agent, its mode<br>
of administration, and the like. In certain embodiments of the present invention a<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition<br>
is that amount effective for inhibiting deacetylase activity (in particular, HDAC activity) in<br>
skin cells. In certain embodiments of the present invention a "therapeutically effective<br>
amount" of the inventive compound or pharmaceutical composition is that amount effective<br>
to kill or inhibit the grwoth of skin cells.<br>
[00153] In certain embodiments, the method involves the administration of a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the compound or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative<br>
thereof to a subject (including, but not limited to a human or animal) in need of it In certain<br>
embodiments, the inventive compounds as useful for the treatment of cancer (including, but<br>
not limited to, glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal<br>
cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer (including, but not limited to small cell lung<br>
cancer), melanoma and/or skin cancer, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian<br>
cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer, bladder cancer, uterine cancer,<br>
kidney cancer, testicular cancer, stomach cancer, brain cancer, liver cancer, or esophageal<br>
cancer).<br>
[00154] In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are useful in the treatment<br>
of cancers and other proliferative disorders, including, but not limited to breast cancer,<br>
cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer, leukemia, lung cancer, melanoma, multiple<br>
myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and<br><br>
gastric cancer, to name a few. In certain embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are<br>
active against leukemia cells and melanoma cells, and thus are useful for the treatment of<br>
leukemias {e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic Ieukemias) and<br>
malignant melanomas. In still other embodiments, the inventive anticancer agents are active<br>
against solid tumors.<br>
[00155] In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds also find use in the prevention<br>
of restenosis of blood vessels subject to traumas such as angioplasry and stenting. For<br>
example, it is contemplated that the compounds of the invention will be useful as a coating<br>
for implanted medical devices, such as tubings, shunts, catheters, artificial implants, pins,<br>
electrical implants such as pacemakers, and especially for arterial or venous stents, including<br>
balloon-expandable stents. In certain embodiments inventive compounds may be bound to an<br>
implantable medical device, or alternatively, may be passively adsoRBed to the surface of the<br>
implantable device. In certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds may be<br>
formulated to be contained within, or, adapted to release by a surgical or medical device or<br>
implant, such as, for example, stents, sutures, indwelling catheters, prosthesis, and the like.<br>
For example, drugs having antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities have been<br>
evaluated as stent coatings, and have shown promise in preventing retenosis (See, for<br>
example, Presbitero P. et al, "Drug eluting stents do they make the difference?", Minerva<br>
Cardioangiol, 2002, 50(5):431-442; RuygrokP.N. et al, "Rapamycin in cardiovascular<br>
medicine", Intern. Med. J., 2003, 33(3):103-109; and MaRX S.O. et al, "Bench to bedside: the<br>
development of rapamycin and its application to stent restenosis", Circulation, 2001,<br>
104(8):852-855, each of these references is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
Accordingly, without wishing to be bound to any particular theory, Applicant proposes that<br>
inventive compounds having antiproliferative effects can be used as stent coatings and/or in<br>
stent drug delivery devices, inter alia for the prevention of restenosis or reduction of<br>
restenosis rate. Suitable coatings and the general preparation of coated implantable devices<br>
are described in US Patents 6,099,562; 5,886,026; and 5,304,121. The coatings are typically<br>
biocompatible polymeric materials such as a hydrogel polymer, polymethyldisiloxane,<br>
polycaprolactone, polyethylene glycol, polylactic acid, ethylene vinyl acetate, and mixtures<br>
thereof. The coatings may optionally be further covered by a suitable topcoat of<br>
fluorosilicone, polysaccarides, polyethylene glycol, phospholipids or combinations thereof to<br>
impart controlled release characteristics in the composition. A variety of compositions and<br>
methods related to stent coating and/or local stent drug delivery for preventing restenosis are<br>
known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,517,889; 6,273,913; 6,258,121;<br><br>
6,251,136; 6,248,127; 6,231,600; 6,203,551; 6,153,252; 6,071,305; 5,891,507; 5,837,313 and<br>
published U.S. patent application No.: US2001/0027340, each of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety). For example, stents may be coated with polymer-drug<br>
conjugates by dipping the stent in polymer-drug solution or spraying the stent with such a<br>
solution. In certain embodiment, suitable materials for the implantable device include<br>
biocompatible and nontoxic materials, and may be chosen from the metals such as nickel-<br>
titanium alloys, steel, or biocompatible polymers, hydrogels, polyurethanes, polyethylenes,<br>
ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers, etc. In certain embodiments, the inventive compound is<br>
coated onto a stent for insertion into an artery or vein following balloon angioplasty.<br>
[00156] The compounds of this invention or pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
thereof may also be incorporated into compositions for coating implantable medical devices,<br>
such as prostheses, artificial valves, vascular grafts, stents and catheters. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention, in another aspect, includes a composition for coating an implantable device<br>
comprising a compound of the present invention as described generally above, and in classes<br>
and subclasses herein, and a carrier suitable for coating said implantable device. In still<br>
another aspect, the present invention includes an implantable device coated with a<br>

Synthesis of Exemplary Compounds<br>
[00176] Unless otherwise indicated, starting materials are either commercially available or<br>
readily accessibly through laboratory synthesis by anyone reasonably familiar with the art.<br>
Described generally below, are procedures and general guidance for the synthesis of<br>
compounds as described generally and in subclasses and species herein.<br><br><br>
[00177] Described below is the synthesis of a SAHP, an ester-containing analog of S AHA<br>
(as shown in Figure 12).<br>
[00178] 3.86g (24.2mmol) O-benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride and 13mL (75mmol)<br>
diisopropylethylamine were dissolved in 100mL methylene chloride and cooled to 0 °C.<br>
5.00g (24.2mmol) methyl 8-chloro-8-oxooctanoate were dissolved in lOmL methylene<br>
chloride and slowly added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1 h at<br>
0 °C and warmed to room temperature. After stirring for additional 12 h, 300mL 0.5N HC1<br>
were added. The organic layer was separated and washed with brine and sat. bicaRB. After<br>
drying over sodium sulfate, the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure and the<br>
crude product was purified on silica (methylene chloride/ methanol 12:1, rf=0.7) to yield the<br>
desired compound 1 as white solid (6.3g, 89%).<br>
[00179] 6.3g (21.5mmol) methyl ester 1 were dissolved in 200mL methanol, followed by<br>
the addition of 50mL 2N LIOH. The reaction mixture was heated to reflux for lh and cooled<br>
to room temperature. After addition of 100mL IN HC1 and 200mL water, the reaction<br>
mixture was extracted three times with 150mL ethyl acetate. The combined organic layers<br>
were dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent was removed under reduced pressure to afford<br>
the caRBoxylic acid 2 pure and in quantitative yields as white solid<br>
[00180] 140mg caRBoxylic acid 2 (5mmol), 56.5mg phenol (6mmol) and 113mg<br>
dicyclohexylcaRBodiimide (5.5mmol) are mixed followed by the addition of lOmL methylene<br>
chloride and 30mg 4-Dimethylaminopyridine. The reaction mixture was stirred for 2h and<br>
applied crude on a silica column followed by elution with haxanes/ethyl acetate (10-100%<br>
ethyl acetate). The desired phenol ester 3 was obtained as a white solid in 87% yield<br>
(155mg).<br>
[00181] 80 mg phenol ester 3 (0.225mmol) are dissolved in methanol. A catalytical<br>
amount of palladium on charcoal (10%) was as added and hydrogen was bubbled through the<br>
reaction mixture. After lh hour no starting material was detectable by TLC. The reaction<br>
mixture was filtered through Celite and the solvent was removed tinder reduced pressure to<br><br>
yield the free hydroxamte SAHP as brownish solid in quantitative yields (59mg). The crude<br>
product did not show any impurities as judged by LCMS and NMR.<br>
Example 2: Biological Assay Procedures<br>
[00182] Cell culture and Transfections. TAg-Jurkat cells were transfected by<br>
electroporation with 5 u.g of FLAG-epitope-tagged pBJ5 constructs for expression of<br>
recombinant proteins. Cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection.<br>
[00183] HDAC assays. [3H]Acetate-incorporated Mstones were isolated from butyrate-<br>
treated HeLa cells by hydroxyapatite chromatography (as described in Tong, et al. Nature<br>
1997, 395, 917-921.) Immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1.4 g (10,000 dpm) histones<br>
for 3 h at 37° C. HDAC activity was determined by scintillation counting of the ethyl<br>
acetate-soluble [3H]acetic acid (as described in Taunton, et al, Science 1996,272,408-411).<br>
Compounds were added in DMSO such that final assay concentrations were 1% DMSO.<br>
IC50s were calculated using Prism 3.0 software. Curve fitting was done without constraints<br>
using lie program's Sigmoidal-Dose Response parameters. All data points were acquired in<br>
duplicate and IC50s are calculated from the composite results of at least two separate<br>
experiments.<br>
Example 3: In vivo activity<br>
[00184] Although a variety of methods can be utilized, one exemplary method by which<br>
the in vivo activity of the inventive compounds is determined is by subcutaneously<br>
transplanting a desired tumor mass in mice. Drug treatment is then initiated when tumor<br>
mass reaches approximately 100 mm3 after transplantation of the tumor mass. A suitable<br>
composition, as described in more detail above, is then administered to the mice, preferably<br>
in saline and also preferably administered once a day at doses of 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg,<br>
although it will be appreciated that other doses can also be administered. Body weight and<br>
tumor size are then measured daily and changes in percent ratio to initial values are plotted.<br>
In cases where the transplanted tumor ulcerates, the weight loss exceeds 25-30% of control<br>
weight loss, the tumor weight reaches 10% of the body weight of the cancer-bearing mouse,<br>
or the cancer-bearing mouse is dying, the animal is sacrificed in accordance with guidelines<br>
for animal welfare.<br>

In recognition of the need to develop novel<br>
therapeutic agents, the present invention provides novel histone deacetylase inhibitors. These compounds include an ester bond making them sensitive to deactivation by esterases.<br>
Therefore, these compounds are particularly useful in the treatment of skin disorders.<br>
When the compounds reaches the bloodstream, an esterase or an enzyme with esterase activity<br>
cleaves the compound into biologically inactive fragments or fragments with greatly reduced<br>
activity Ideally these degradation products exhibit a short serum and/or systemic half-life and are eliminated rapidly. These compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof are<br>
particularly useful in treating cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, neurofibromatosis, psoriasis, hair<br>
loss, skin pigmentation, and dermatitis, for exmaple. The present invention also provides methods for preparing compounds of the invention and intermediates thereto.</td>
