TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention generally relates to digital communication systems that supports multiple<br>
modulation and channel coding schemes and more particularly to a base station arranged to<br>
communicate over uplink and downlink RF links with a mobile station of a communication<br>
system<br>
The present application is divided out from Patent Application No.2538/DEL/98.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
In wireless digital communication systems, standardized air interfaces specify most of system<br>
parameters, including modulation scheme, channel coding scheme, burst format,<br>
communication protocol, symbol rate, etc. For example. European Telecommunication<br>
Standard Institute (LTSI) has specified a Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)<br>
standard that uses time division multiple access (TDMA) to communicate control, voice and<br>
data information over radio frequency (RF) physical channels or links using Gaussian<br>
Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK) modulation scheme at a symbol rate of 271 ksps. In the<br>
U.S., Telecommunication Industry Association (TIA) has published a number of Interim<br>
Standards, such as IS-54 and IS-136, that define various versions of digital advanced mobile<br>
phone service (D-AMPS). a IDMA system that uses a Differential QPSK (DQPSK)<br>
modulation scheme for communicating data over RF links.<br>
Digital communication systems use a variety of linear and non-linear modulation schemes to<br>
communicate voice or data information in bursts. These modulation schemes include. GMSK,<br>
Quadrature Phase Shift Keying (QPSK), Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM), etc.<br>
GMSK modulation scheme is a non-linear low level modulation (LLM) scheme with a<br>
symbol rate that supports a specified user bit rate. In order to increase user bit rate, high-level<br>
modulation (HLM) schemes can be used. Linear modulation schemes, such as QAM scheme,<br>
may have different level of modulation. For example, 16QAM scheme is used to represent the<br><br>
sixteen variations of 4 bits of data. On the other hand, a QPSK modulation scheme is used to<br>
represent the four variations of 2 bits of data.<br>
In addition to various modulation schemes, digital communication systems can support<br>
various channel coding schemes, which are used to increase communication reliability. For<br>
example, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), which is a GSM extension for providing<br>
packet data service, supports four channel coding schemes. A Convolutional Half-Rate Code<br>
scheme, CS1 coding scheme, which is the "mother" channel coding scheme of GPRS. The<br>
CS1 scheme is punctured to obtain approximately two-third rate and three-fourth rate code<br>
schemes, CS2 and CSS coding schemes. GPRS also supports an uncoded scheme, known as<br>
CS4 coding scheme.<br>
Generally, channel coding schemes code and interleave data bits of a burst or a sequence of<br>
bursts to prevent their loss under degraded RF link conditions, for example, when RF links arc<br>
exposed to fading. The number of coding bits used for channel coding of data bits<br>
corresponds to error detection accuracy, with higher number of coding bits providing higher<br>
bit error detection accuracy. For a given gross bit rate, a high number of coding bits, however,<br>
reduces user bit rate, since coding bits reduce the number of user data bits that can be<br>
transmitted in a burst.<br>
The communication channel typically introduces errors in sequence. In order to improve<br>
coding efficiency, the coded bits are interleaved, before transmission. The purpose of<br>
interleaving is to distribute the errors over several code words. The term perfect interleaving<br>
is used when the sequence of the received data bit errors are uncorrected. The more less<br>
uncoirclated the received data bits are at the receiver, the easier it is to recover lost data bits.<br>
On the other hand, if interleaving is not effective, large portions or blocks of transmitted data<br>
bits may be lost under degraded RF link conditions. Consequently, error correction algorithms<br>
may not be able to recover the lost data.<br>
TDMA systems subdivide the available frequency band into one or several RF channels. The<br>
RF channels are divided into a number of physical channels corresponding to time slots in<br>
TDMA frames. Logical channels are mapped onto one or more physical channels, where<br>
modulation and channel coding schemes are specified. An RF link includes one or more<br>
3<br><br>
physical channels that support the logical channels. In these systems, the mobile stations<br>
communicate with a plurality of scattered base stations by transmitting and receiving bursts of<br>
digital information over uplink and downlink RF channels.<br>
The growing number of mobile stations in use today has generated the need for more voice<br>
and data channels within cellular telecommunication systems. As a result, base stations have<br>
become more closely spaced, with an increase in interference between mobile stations<br>
operating on the same frequency in neighboring or closely spaced cells. Although digital<br>
techniques gain more useful channels from a given frequency spectrum, there still remains a<br>
need to reduce interference, or more specifically to increase the ratio of the carrier signal<br>
strength to interference, (i.e., carrier-to-interference (C/I)) ratio. RF links that can handle<br>
lower C/1 ratios are considered to be more robust than those that only can handle higher C/1<br>
ratios.<br>
Depending on the modulation and channel coding schemes, grade of service deteriorates more<br>
rapidly as link quality decreases. In other words, the data throughput or grade of service of<br>
more robust RF links deteriorates less rapidly than those of less robust RF links. Higher level<br>
modulation schemes arc more susceptible to link quality degradation than lower level<br>
modulation schemes. If a FILM scheme is used, the data throughput drops very rapidly with a<br>
drop in link quality. On the other hand, if a LLM scheme is used, data throughput and grade<br>
of service does not deteriorate as rapidly under the same interference conditions.<br>
Therefore, link adaptation methods, which provide the ability to dynamically change<br>
modulation scheme, channel coding, and/or the number of used time slots, based on channel<br>
conditions, arc used to balance the user bit rate against link quality. Generally, these methods<br>
dynamically adapt a system's combination of channel coding, modulation, and number of<br>
assignable time slots to achieve optimum performance over a broad range of (71 conditions.<br>
One evolutionary path for next generation of cellular systems is to use high-level modulation<br>
(HFM), e.g., 16QAM modulation scheme, to provide increased user bit rates compared to the<br>
existing standards. These cellular systems include enhanced GSM systems with GPRS<br>
extension, enhanced D-AMPS systems, International Mobile Telecommunication 2000 (IMT-<br>
2000), etc. A high level linear modulation, such as 16QAM modulation scheme, has the<br><br><br>
potential to be more spectrum efficient than, for example, GMSK, which is a low-level<br>
modulation (LLM) scheme. Because higher level modulation schemes require a higher<br>
minimum C/1 ratio for acceptable performance, their availability in the system becomes<br>
limited to certain coverage areas of the system or certain parts of the cells, where more robust<br>
links can be maintained.<br>
In order to provide various communication services, a corresponding minimum user bit rate is<br>
required. In voice and/or data services, user bit rate corresponds to voice quality and/or data<br>
throughput, with a higher user bit rate producing better voice quality and/or higher data<br>
throughput. The total user bit rate is determined by a selected combination of techniques for<br>
speech coding, channel coding, modulation scheme, and for a TDMA system, the number of<br>
assignable time slots per call.<br>
Data services include transparent services and non-transparent services. Transparent services,<br>
which have a minimum link quality requirement, provide target user bit rates. A system that<br>
provides transparent communication services varies the gross bit rate to maintain a constant<br>
user bit rate with the required quality. Conversely, in non-transparent services, for example,<br>
GPRS, the user bit rate may vary, because erroneously received data bits are retransmitted.<br>
Unlike non-transparent services, transparent services do not retransmit erroneously received<br>
data bits. Therefore, transparent services have a constant point-to-point transmission delay,<br>
and non-transparent services have a non-constant point-to-point transmission delay.<br>
A communication system may provide a data service through a number of RI; links<br>
supporting different combinations of channel coding, speech coding, and/or modulation<br>
schemes, for example, the system may provide a multimedia service using two or more<br>
separate RL links that separately provide audio and video signals. Under this scenario, one of<br>
the two RL links may use HLM scheme and the other link may use LLM scheme. In order to<br>
provide a constant user bit rate in a TDMA system, lower level modulation schemes may use<br>
a higher number of time slots than higher level modulation schemes.<br>
Moreover, digital communication systems must also select a suitable combination of channel<br>
coding and modulation schemes based on link quality. Lor example, for a high quality link,<br>
higher level modulation or less channel coding results in higher user bit rate, which may be<br><br><br>
used advantageously by different communication services, for example, in a non-transparent<br>
data service, user data throughput is increased. For a speech service, the increased user bit rate<br>
may be used for deploying an alternative speech coder with higher quality. Therefore, a<br>
system thai supports multiple modulation and channel coding schemes should provide<br>
sufficient flexibility for selecting an optimum combination of modulation and channel coding<br>
schemes.<br>
Conventional method for selecting an optimum combination of modulation and channel<br>
coding schemes assume that the link quality parameters are perfectly known at a given instant.<br>
Usually, these methods determine link quality parameters by measuring, at predefined<br>
instances, one or more of received signal strength (RSS) or bit error rate (BHR), etc. Using<br>
these instantaneous measurements, these methods also assume that user quality as a function<br>
of link quality parameters is perfectly known for all combinations of modulation and channel<br>
coding schemes.<br>
Because these parameters vary continuously, the mean measurement of link quality<br>
parameters do not give an accurate indication of user quality, especially after a link with a<br>
different combination of modulation and channel coding schemes is selected. One method<br>
dynamically adapts user bit rate of a TDMA system to achieve optimum voice quality over a<br>
broad range of channel conditions. This system continuously monitors link quality by making<br>
instantaneous measurements of a RF link's C/1 ratio. The system dynamically adapts its<br>
combination of modulation and channel coding schemes and the number of assignable time<br>
slots to optimize voice quality for the measured conditions. In addition, the system determines<br>
cost functions to derive at a cost of using RF links with different modulation and coding<br>
schemes to improve voice quality.<br>
 User quality, however, varies considerably with variations in link quality parameters. FIG. 1<br>
shows link performance of two modulation schemes, i.e., QPSK and 16QAM schemes, which<br>
arE exposed to three channel conditions: an Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel<br>
condition, a fast Rayleigh Fading channel condition, and a slow Rayleigh fading channel<br>
condition. In FIG. 1, link performance is expressed in terms of BHR. For a given C/I ratio, the<br>
AWGN channel provides the best performance, due to the lack of fading dips. In fast<br>
Rayleigh fading channel, where fading varies fast enough to make effective use of<br><br><br>
interleaving, link performance is degraded compared to the AWGN channel. In slow<br>
Rayleigh fading channel, where fading varies slowly such that interleaving is not effective,<br>
the worst link performance is obtained. Conventional methods use mean C/1 ratio to<br>
determine the channel condition. As shown in FIG. 1. however, mean C/I ratio for different<br>
channel conditions may be the same, when link performance may be quiet different<br>
Therefore, more information is needed to accurately estimate link performance, if different<br>
combinations of modulation and channel coding is used.<br>
An additional factor affecting user quality is time dispersion. Receiver equalizers can not<br>
effectively handle large time dispersions. As a result, link performance degrades, even when<br>
(71 ratio distribution remains the same. Accordingly, mean measurements of C/I ratio, BHR or<br>
time dispersion alone are not sufficient for estimating performance of a selected link.<br>
Therefore, there exists a need for an effective link selection method in systems that support<br>
various modulation and channel coding schemes.<br>
In the parent application addresses this need is exemplified in a selection method that<br>
statistically characterizes combinations of available modulation and channel coding schemes<br>
using measured link quality parameters to determine which combination provides the best<br>
user quality. The method of the invention measures at least one link quality parameter of at<br>
least one RF link, for example, C/I ratio, BFR, received signal strength, or time dispersion.<br>
Then, at least one channel characteristic measure is calculated based on the measured link<br>
quality parameter by computing both its mean value and variance. By introducing the<br>
variance of for example C/I ratio, it is possible to estimate the type of channel conditions a<br>
transmission is susceptible to. Consequently, it is possible to estimate how a change of<br>
modulation and/or channel coding scheme would effect the link quality. In an exemplary<br>
embodiment, the channel characteristic measure may be calculated for each one of available<br>
combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes of an RF link. Thereafter, a user<br>
quality estimator estimates user quality values, for example, user data throughput or speech<br>
quality values, based on the calculated channel characteristic measure. Finally, the present<br>
invention selects a combination of modulation and channel coding schemes on an RF link that<br>
provides the best user quality.<br>
According to some of its more detailed features, the invention in the parent case maps the<br><br><br>
calculated channel characteristic measure with estimated user quality values of the supported<br>
combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes. The mapping function may use<br>
simulation results, laboratory results, or results derived during normal operation of a<br>
communication system.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention in the parent case , the selection method determines an<br>
optimal transmit power for each combination of modulation and channel coding schemes based on the<br>
measured link quality parameter. Thereafter, the user quality values are estimated based on the optimal<br>
transmit power. Also, data bursts are transmitted on the selected RF link at the optimal transmit power.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a communication system 10 according to an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention supports multiple modulation schemes. In an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the invention, the system 10 supports three modulation schemes: a first LLM (LLM1) scheme,<br>
a second LLM (LLM2) scheme, and a HLM scheme. LLM1 scheme is a non-linear<br>
modulation scheme, such as GMSK modulation scheme used in GSM systems. LLM2 scheme<br>
is a linear modulation scheme, such as QPSK. Finally, IILM scheme is a higher level linear<br>
modulation schemes, for example, 16QAM scheme, that could be supported by the second<br>
generation of enhanced GSM systems, which as of yet are not standardized.<br>
The communication system 10 also supports the channel coding schemes of GSM's GPRS<br>
extension. The system 10, therefore, supports CS1, CS2, CS3, and CS4 channel coding<br>
schemes. The system 10 supports various combinations of modulation and channel coding<br>
schemes on a plurality of RF links. Although, the system 10 is described with reference to the<br>
above specified exemplary modulation and channel coding schemes, it should be noted that a<br>
wide range of modulation and coding schemes may be used to implement the present<br>
invention.<br>
The mode of operation of GSM communication systems is described in European<br>
Telecommunication Standard Institute (ETSI) documents LTS 300 573, LTS 300 574 and<br><br>
ETS 300 578, which are hereby incorporated by reference. Therefore, the operation of the<br>
GSM system is described to the extent necessary for understanding of the present invention.<br>
Although, the present invention is described as embodied in a GSM system, those skilled in<br>
the art would appreciate that the present invention could be used in a wide variety of other<br>
digital communication systems, such as those based on PDC or D-AMPS standards and<br>
enhancements thereof. The present invention may also be used in CDMA or a hybrid of<br>
CDMA and TDMA communication systems.<br>
The communication system 10 covers a geographical area that is subdivided into<br>
communication cells, which together provide communication coverage to a service area, for<br>
example, an entire city. Preferably, the communication cells are patterned according to a cell<br>
pattern that allows some of the spaced apart cells to use the same uplink and downlink RF<br>
channels. In this way, the cell pattern of the system 10 reduces the number of RF channels<br>
needed to cover the service area. The system 10 may also employ frequency hopping<br>
techniques, for example, to avoid "dcadspots."<br>
Initial selection of modulation scheme would preferably depend on either measured or<br>
predicted link quality parameters of a new RF" link. Alternatively, the initial selection may be<br>
based on a predefined cell parameter. Due to a possible difference in link robustness for<br>
FFM1, LLM2, and HLM schemes, a mobile station 12 continues to use FFM1 scheme until<br>
the channel characteristic allows the use of other schemes, in which case a link adaptation<br>
procedure is initiated to switch modulation scheme from LLM1 scheme to LLM2, or HLM<br>
scheme.<br>
When no information is transferred to or from a mobile station 12. for example, during idle<br>
states or wait states of GPRS, the mobile station 12 preferably measures link quality<br>
parameters of different RF links. For instance, the mobile station 12 measures the interference<br>
on RF links that are candidates for use in the future as well as the received signal strength of<br>
its current link. The measurement results are used to determine a distribution of channel<br>
characteristic measures. These measurements serve as the basis for deciding which<br>
combination of modulation and channel coding schemes to use subsequently.<br>
According to the present invention, during an ongoing communication, user quality values are<br><br><br>
estimated based on channel characteristics, which are expressed in terms of variations and<br>
mean values of link quality parameters. The channel characteristics are derived based on<br>
measurements of link quality parameters over a predefined period. In this way, the system 10<br>
estimates user quality values provided by available combinations of modulation and channel<br>
coding schemes of one or more RF links. By comparing the estimated user quality values of<br>
these combinations, the present invention selects a modulation and channel coding<br>
combination on an RF link that provides the best user quality value.<br>
For example, for providing a non-transparent service, the system 10 estimates user quality<br>
values of available combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes on the one or<br>
more RF links in terms of data throughput S. For a predefined time period, the system 10<br>
continuously measures link quality parameters and calculates their mean values and variances.<br>
The present invention relics on statistical measures to characterize an RF link. Although the<br>
exemplary embodiment uses mean values and variances, other statistical measures may also<br>
be used, for example, standard deviation, median, etc. The system 10 calculates the mean<br>
values of such link quality parameters as C/1 ratio or BER values that arc obtained over the<br>
predefined time period. Based on measured link quality parameters over the predefined time<br>
period, the system 10 also determines the variances of one or more of the link quality<br>
parameters. Based on the variances, the system 10 estimates the data throughputs S for all<br>
combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes over one or more RF links. The<br>
system then selects a new combination of modulation and channel coding schemes on a RF<br>
link, if switching to the new combination on that RF link provides a higher data throughput S<br>
than that provided by a current combination.<br>
For a speech service, the system 10 may use a different user quality value measure than the<br>
data throughput S used for a non-transparent data service. Preferably, the user quality value in<br>
speech service is expressed in terms of a voice quality value Q, which may be based on<br>
estimated frame erasure rate (FER) and/or residual user bit error rate (RBER) originated from<br>
the use of various speech coding schemes. Under this arrangement, the present invention<br>
estimates voice quality values Q for different combinations of modulation and channel coding<br>
schemes. Then, the system 10 selects a combination that provides the best estimated voice<br>
quality value.<br><br><br>
The system 10 is designed as a hierarchical network with multiple levels for managing calls.<br>
Using an allocated set of uplink and downlink RF links a number of mobile stations 12<br>
operating within the system 10 participate in calls using allocated time slots. At a high<br>
hierarchical level, a group of Mobile Service Switching Centers (MSCs) 14 are responsible<br>
for the routing of calls from an originator to a destination. In particular, they are responsible<br>
for setup, control and termination of calls. One of the MSCs 14, known as the gateway MSC,<br>
handles communication with a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) 18, or other<br>
public and private networks.<br>
Different operators support different communication standards with different modulation and<br>
channel coding schemes. The same operator may also support different modulation and<br>
channel coding schemes in different cells. For example, one operator may support LLM1<br>
modulation scheme and CS4 channel coding scheme only, whereas, another operator may<br>
support all of the modulation and channel coding schemes. The communication system 10<br>
uses the present invention to select a combination of modulation and channel coding schemes<br>
that provide the best user quality value.<br>
At a lower hierarchical level, each one of the MSCs 14 are connected to a group of base<br>
station controllers (BSCs) 16. The primary function of a BSC 16 is radio resource<br>
management, for example, based on reported received signal strength at the mobile stations<br>
12. the BSC 16 determines whether to initiate a hand over. Under the GSM standard, the BSC<br>
16 communicates with a MSC 14 under a standard interface known as the A-interface. which<br>
is based on the Mobile Application Part of CCITT Signaling System No. 7.<br>
At a still lower hierarchical level each one of the BSCs 16 controls, a group of base<br>
transceiver stations (BTSs) 20. Each BTS 20 includes a number of TRXs that use the uplink<br>
and downlink RF channels to serve a particular common geographical area. The BTSs 20<br>
primarily provide the RF links for the transmission and reception of data bursts to and from<br>
the mobile stations 12 within their designated cell. In an exemplary embodiment, a number of<br>
BTSs 20 are incorporated into a radio base station (RBS) 22. The RBS 22 may be configured<br>
according to a family of RBS-2000 products, which is offered by Fricsson, the assignee of the<br>
present invention.<br><br><br>
With reference to FIG. 3, an RF channel 26 (uplink or downlink) is divided into repetitive<br>
time frames 27 during which information are communicated. Each frame 27 is further divided<br>
into time slots 28 that carry packets of information. Speech or data is transmitted during time<br>
slots designated as traffic channels (TCH1, . . . , TCHn). All signaling functions pertaining to<br>
call management in the system, including initiations, hand overs, and termination are handled<br>
via control information transmitted over control channels.<br>
The mobile stations 12 use slow associated control channels (SACCHs) to transmit associated<br>
control signals, such as an RX-LKV signal, which corresponds to the received signal strength<br>
at the mobile station and RX-QUAL signal, which is a measure of various levels of bit error<br>
rate at the mobile station 12, as defined by the GSM standard. Fast associated control<br>
channels (FACCHs) perform control functions, such as hand-overs, by stealing time slots<br>
allocated for TCHs.<br>
The BSC 16 instructs the RBS 22 based on measures of channel characteristics of RF links<br>
between mobile stations 12 to the RBS 22. As described later in detail, the channel<br>
characteristics may be measured based on a number of parameters, including received signal<br>
strength, bit error rate, the multipath propagation property of the uplink RF channel, for<br>
example, time dispersion, or a combination of them.<br>
The system 10 carries out the transmission of information during a time slot in a burst that<br>
contain a predefined number of coded bits. The GSM specification defines various types of<br>
bursts: normal burst (NB), frequency correction burst (FB), synchronization burst (SB).<br>
access burst (AB), and dummy burst. The normal burst, which has a duration of 576 .m.u.s. is<br>
used both during the traffic and some control signalling channels. The remaining bursts arc<br>
primarily used for access and maintaining signal and frequency synchronization within the<br>
system.<br>
As shown in FIG. 4, a normal burst 29 includes two separate data portions 30 during which<br>
digital data bits arc communicated. The normal burst also includes tail and guard sections 31<br>
and 32 as shown. Among other things, the guard section 32 is used to allow for up-ramping of<br>
the burst and for down-ramping of the bursts. The tail section 31 is used for demodulation<br><br><br>
purposes. All burst transmissions, except dummy burst transmissions, include training<br>
sequences. The training sequences are patterned with predefined autocorrelation<br>
characteristics. During demodulation process, the auto correlation characteristic of the<br>
training sequence helps in the synchronization of the received bit sequences over an RF<br>
channel. In the normal burst 29, a training sequence 33 is positioned in the middle of the burst<br>
between its data portions.<br>
In order to compensate for propagation delays over RF links, the communication system 10<br>
uses a time alignment process by which the mobile stations 12 align their burst transmissions<br>
to arrive at the BTSs 20 in proper time relationship relative to other bursts transmissions. As<br>
described later, the mobile station 12 and the RBS 22 incorporate equalizers, which correlate<br>
received baseband bit sequences over the uplink or downlink RF channels with the training<br>
sequences, to provide correlator responses that correspond to the properties of multipath<br>
propagation. Based on the correlator responses, the receiver section of the BTS 20 generates a<br>
timing advance (TA) parameter. The mobile station 12 uses the TA parameter, which is<br>
transmitted from the RBS 22, for advancing or retarding its burst transmissions relative to a<br>
lime reference.<br>
With reference to FIG. 5, the block diagram of a mobile station 12 is shown. The mobile<br>
station 12 includes a receiver section 34 and a transmitter section 36, which arc coupled to an<br>
antenna 38 through a duplexer 39. The antenna 38 is used for receiving and transmitting RF<br>
signals to and from the BTS 20 over allocated uplink and downlink RF channels. The receiver<br>
section 34 includes an RF receiver 40, which includes a local oscillator 41, a mixer 42, and<br>
selectivity filters 43 arranged in a well known manner, for down-converting and demodulating<br>
received signals to a baseband level. The RF receiver 40, which is tuned by the local oscillator<br>
41 to the downlink channel, also provides an RX-LEV signal on line 44 that corresponds to<br>
the received signal strength at the mobile station 12.<br>
The RF receiver provides a baseband signal to a demodulator 46 that demodulates coded data<br>
bits representing the received speech, data and signaling information. Depending on the type<br>
of mobile station 12, the demodulator 46 can support one or more demodulation schemes<br>
corresponding to LLM1, LLM2, and HLM schemes. For example, the demodulator of a<br>
mobile station 12 subscribed to an operator that supports LLM1 scheme may be capable of<br><br><br>
demodulating LLM1 modulated signals only. On the other hand, the demodulator of a<br>
mobile station 12 subscribed to an operator that supports all of the three modulation schemes<br>
is preferably capable of demodulating LLM1, LLM2, and HLM schemes.<br>
As described above, the demodulator 46 includes an equalizer (not shown) that processes the<br>
coded bit pattern disposed on the training sequences, to provide correlator response that arc<br>
used for predictive demodulation of the baseband signal. The equalizer uses the correlator<br>
responses to determine the most probable bit sequence for demodulation. As defined by the<br>
GSM specification, a channel decoder/de-interleaver 50 also provides an RX-QUAL signal on<br>
line 48, which is a measure of various levels of bit error rate at the mobile station 12. The<br>
mobile station 12 reports the RX-QUAL signal and the RX-LLV signal to the BSC 16 on a<br>
SACCH	channel.<br>
The channel decoder/dc-interleaver 50 decodes and de-intcrlcaves the demodulated signal.<br>
The channel dccodcr/dc-interleavcr 50 may use a wide variety of channel decoding schemes,<br>
including CS1-CS4 decoding schemes. The speech data bits are applied to a speech decoder<br>
52 that decodes the speech pattern using one of a variety of supported speech decoding<br>
schemes. After decoding, the speech decoder 52 applies an analog speech signal to a output<br>
device 53. e.g., a speaker, via an audio amplifier 54. The channel decoder 50 provides the<br>
decoded data and signalling information to a microprocessor 56 for further processing, for<br>
example, displaying the data to a user.<br>
The transmitter section 36 includes an input device 57, e.g., a microphone and/or keypad, for<br>
inputting voice or data information. According to a specified speech/data coding techniques, a<br>
speech coder 58 digitizes and codes the voice signals according to a variety of supported<br>
speech coding schemes. A channel coder/interleaver 62 codes the uplink data according to a<br>
specified coding/interleaving algorithms, including CS1-CS4 coding schemes. The channel<br>
codcr/intcrlcaver 62 provides an uplink baseband signal to a modulator 64. The modulator 64<br>
modulates the uplink baseband signal according to one or more of supported modulation<br>
schemes. Similar to the demodulator 46, the modulator 64 of the mobile station 12 may<br>
support one or more of LLM1, LLM2, and HLM schemes.<br>
The modulator 64 applies the coded signal to an up-converter 67, which receives a carrier<br><br><br>
signal from the up-converted signal local oscillator 41. An RF amplifier 65 amplifies the up-<br>
converted signal for transmission trough the antenna 38. A well known frequency synthesizer<br>
66. under the control of the microprocessor 56. supplies the operating frequency information<br>
to the local oscillator 41. The microprocessor 56 causes the mobile station 12 to transmit the<br>
RX-QUAI.. and RX-FFV parameters to the RBS 22 over the SACCH.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, an exemplary block diagram of the RBS 22 is shown to include a<br>
plurality of BTSs 20 that serve different geographical areas. Through a timing bus 72. the<br>
BTSs 20 are synchronized with each other. Voice and data information arc provided to and<br>
from the RBS 22 through a traffic bus 74 that may be coupled, through the A-bis interface, to<br>
a public or private voice and data transmission line, such as a T1 line (not shown). Fach BTS<br>
20 includes TRXs 75 and 76 that communicate with the mobile station 12. As shown, two<br>
antennas designated as 24A and 24B are spaced accordingly to cover cells 77 and 78. The<br>
TRXs 76 arc coupled to the antennas 24 through combiner/duplcxers 80 that combine<br>
downlink transmission signals from the TRXs 76 and distribute the uplink received signals<br>
from the mobile station 12. The RBS 22 also includes a base station common function (BCF)<br>
block 68 that controls the operation and maintenance of the RBS 22.<br>
Referring to FIG. 7, a block diagram of a TRX 76 is shown. The TRX 76 includes a<br>
transmitter section 86, a receiver section 87, a baseband processor 88 and a TRX controller<br>
90. Through a corresponding antenna 24 (shown in FIG. 6), the receiver section 87 receives<br>
uplink signals from the mobile station 12. A down-conversion block 91 down-converts the<br>
received signal. After down-converting the received signals, the receiver section 87 samples<br>
its phase and magnitude, via a sampler block 92, to provide received bit sequence to the<br>
baseband processor 88. An RSSl estimator 94 provides an RSSl signal on line 95, which is a<br>
measure of the received signal strength. The RSSl estimator 94 may also measure noise<br>
disturbance levels during idle channels. The TRX controller 90, which is coupled to the traffic-<br>
bus 74, processes the commands received from the BSC 16 and transmits TRX related<br>
information, such as various TRX measurements, to the BSC 16. Under this arrangement, the<br>
TRX 76 periodically reports the RSSI signal and noise disturbance levels to the BSC 16.<br>
The baseband processor 88 includes a demodulator 96 that receives uplink baseband data<br>
from the receiver section 87. The demodulator 96 generates correlator responses that are<br><br><br>
processed in a well known manner to retrieve the uplink baseband data. Similar to the mobile<br>
station 12. the demodulator may support demodulation of signals that are modulated using<br>
one or more of LLM1, LLM2 or HLM schemes. The uplink baseband data is applied to a<br>
channel decoder 97 that decodes the baseband signal according to one or more supported<br>
channel decoding scheme, including CS1-CS4 decoding schemes. The channel decoder 97<br>
places the decoded baseband signal on the traffic bus 78, for further processing by the BSC<br>
16.<br>
When transmitting downlink baseband data, the baseband processor 88 receives properly<br>
coded data or digitized speech information from the BSC 16 over the traffic bus 74 and<br>
applies them to a channel coder 102 that codes and inter-leaves speech and data according to<br>
one or more of supported channel coding schemes, including CS1-CS4 channel coding<br>
schemes. The transmitter section includes a modulator 104 that modulates the supplied data<br>
bits according to one or more of LLM1, LLM2, and HLM schemes. The modulator 104<br>
provides downlink baseband signals to an up-conversion block 106 for up-conversion. A<br>
power amplifier 108 amplifies the up-converted signal for transmission through a<br>
corresponding antenna.<br>
The system 10, for example, uses one or a combination of the RX-QUAL, RX-LLV, or time<br>
dispersion parameters, which arc measures of link quality parameters of an RF link, to select<br>
an optimum combination of modulation and channel coding on an RF link. The system 10<br>
also uses these parameters to decide whether a link adaptation procedure should be initiated or<br>
not. The BSC 16 compares the channel characteristic parameter to corresponding thresholds<br>
to determine whether to initiate a link adaptation procedure within coverage areas that support<br>
L1.M1, LLM2, and HLM schemes.<br>
Referring to FIG. 8, a flow chart of a method for selecting a combination of modulation and<br>
channel coding schemes on an RF link according to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention is shown. In this exemplary embodiment, it is assumed that system 10 provides a<br>
non-transparent data service, for example, a packet data service under GPRS, in which data<br>
blocks, the smallest retransmittable units, are transmitted and erroneously received blocks are<br>
re-transmitted according to an Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ) scheme.<br><br><br>
The selection method starts by measuring link quality parameters of an RF link at a receiver<br>
that may be in the mobile station 12 or a BTS 20, block 801. If more than one RF links arc<br>
available, the selection method may measure link quality parameters of all available links as<br>
well. Examples of link quality parameter measurements include C/I ratio, received signal<br>
strength, time dispersion on burst level, and raw BHR on block level. The measurements arc<br>
processed to determine the distribution of the channel characteristic measures. For example,<br>
the distribution of the channel characteristic measures may be calculated statically in terms of<br>
mean values and variances of link quality parameters, block 803. The processed measurement<br>
results are reported to a link quality estimator, block 805,<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the link quality estimator performs a mapping function fi. which<br>
maps the channel characteristic measures with estimated user quality values of each one of the<br>
supported combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes i, block 807. For<br>
example, mapping function calculates the mean value and variance of raw BHR, based on<br>
measurement results, and then, based on the mean and variance value estimates BLUR,. The<br>
mapping functions may be implemented using a table that is initially constructed based on<br>
empirical results, such as simulation results, or experimental results, such as laboratory<br>
results, of the various combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes.<br>
Alternatively, the table may include results tuned based on actual measurements during the<br>
normal operation of the system 10.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, BLHR estimates are used for calculating user quality values in<br>
terms of data throughputs S, for each one of the combinations of modulation and coding<br>
schemes, block 809. The user quality values arc used for selecting an optimum combination<br>
of modulation and channel coding schemes on an RF link by comparing the data throughputs<br>
Si, block 811. If the data throughput of a new combination, other than the one currently used<br>
is significantly higher, a link adaptation procedure is initiated to switch to the new<br>
combination.<br>
For selecting the combination of modulation and channel coding scheme on an uplink RF<br>
link, the present invention performs all of the above specified steps at the RBS 22. For<br>
selecting the combination of modulation and channel coding scheme on a downlink RF link,<br><br><br>
the mobile station 12 performs the steps of measuring link quality parameters and calculating<br>
mean values and variances and reporting the channel characteristic measures to the RBS 22.<br>
The RBS 22 then performs the link quality estimation function and decides whether a new<br>
combination of modulation and channel coding schemes on an RF link should be selected or<br>
not. For the downline, the link quality estimation may of course also be performed in the<br>
mobile station.<br>
FIG. 9 shows an exemplary block diagram of a means for estimating data throughput for N<br>
combinations of modulation and coding schemes. A channel characteristic estimator block<br>
112 receives the link quality parameter measurements, e.g. C/I ratio, received signal strength,<br>
raw BER, and time dispersion parameter. Based on the measured link quality parameters, the<br>
channel characteristic estimator block 112 provides their mean values and variances. A user<br>
quality value estimator block 114, which operates based on previously obtained statistical link<br>
performance results or actual system measurements, provides estimate of BLHRi through<br>
BLHRN. Based on nominal data bit rates R,, a converter block 116 converts estimates of<br>
BLHRi through BLHRN to estimates of S1 through SN by using liquation (1):<br>
(1)S, R, (1 -BLHRi).<br>
Based on the data throughputs S,, a selector block 118 selects an optimum combination of<br>
modulation and channel coding schemes on an RF link.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a power control scheme is used in combination<br>
with the above described link selection method. Assuming that a transmitter has a power<br>
dynamic range between Pmin and Pmax, this aspect of the invention selects an optimum power<br>
level, Popt .epsilon. (Pmm,Pmax) for each combination of modulation and channel coding<br>
schemes. The optimal power is based on a C/I target (C/des) for each combination, which may<br>
be based on a target user quality value, such as BLHR target (BLERdes).<br>
Referring to FIG. 10, a flow chart of the power control scheme of this aspect of the invention<br>
is shown. The system 10 measures the mean value of C/I ratio (or other link quality<br>
parameters), for example using the measure obtained from step 803 of FIG. 8, block 101.<br><br><br>
Based on the mean C/I ratio, the system 10 calculates an optimal power | Popt| using liquation<br>
(2):<br><br>
where P is transmit power at a time t and C/Ides (i) ratio is a target C/I ratio for achieving a<br>
desired user quality value for a combination of modulation and channel coding schemes i.<br>
block 103. For example. C/Ides (i) ratio may be a ratio that provides the target BLeRdes (i) for<br>
different combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes. Then, the optimal power<br>
Popt, is truncated for each combination of modulation and channel coding scheme using<br>
liquation (3):<br><br>
The truncation step, block 105, allows for selection of a combination of modulation and<br>
channel coding scheme that provides the best user quality value, provided that the transmitter<br>
can produce the selected Popt without exceeding its Pmax. If the calculated Popt is higher than<br>
the Pmax, the system 10 sets the power of the transmitter at Pmax. On the other hand, if the<br>
calculated Popt is less than the Pmm, the system 10 sets the power of the transmitter at Pmm.<br>
Then, for all combinations of modulation and channel coding schemes, the system 10<br>
calculates, block 107, the mean C/I , ratio using liquation 4 :<br><br>
This step estimates a corresponding mean C/I , for each combination of modulation and<br>
channel coding scheme by taking into account the dynamic range of the transmit power<br>
between Pmax and Pmin. Once an optimum combination of modulation and channel coding<br>
schemes is selected, using for example, the steps described in blocks 805-811, the system 10<br>
transmits on a selected RF link using the optimum combination at the optimal power Popt,<br>
blocks 109 and 11.<br>
Referring to FIG. 11, a graph of link performances of two combinations of modulation and<br>
channel coding schemes is shown to describe an exemplary power control scheme according<br><br>
to the above described aspect of the invention. At a given time t, the transmit power of the<br>
transmitter, which, for example, has a dynamic range between Pmin 5 dBm and Pmax 33<br>
dBm. is assumed to be at P, 20 dBm. The measured C/I, ratio is assumed to be 8 dB. The<br>
target C/Ides ratio is determined that gives a desired user quality. For example, C/Ides ratio is 12<br>
dB for the first combination (shown with Graph 1), and it is 27 dB for the second combination<br>
(shown with Graph 2). Jn order to achieve the C/Ides ratio for the first and second<br>
combinations, the transmit power must be increased by 4 dB and 19 dB, respectively. Hence,<br>
for the first combination, Popt is equal to 24 dBm, and for the second combination Popt is 39<br>
dbm, which is beyond Pmax. In this case, the system 10 sets the transmit power to Pmax of 33<br>
dBm and calculates the C/I ratio according to liquation (4). Based on the measured C/I ratio at<br>
Pmax, a link providing the best user quality value is selected.<br>
From the foregoing it would be appreciated that the present invention significantly facilitates<br>
RF link selection process in systems that supports multiple modulation and coding schemes.<br>
By statistically characterizing RF links in terms of distribution and variances of link quality<br>
parameters, the present invention provides a more effective link selection process. In this way,<br>
the present invention improves communication quality of systems that support multiple<br>
combinations of modulation and coding schemes.<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail with reference only to a preferred<br>
embodiment, those skilled in the art will appreciate that various modifications can be made<br>
without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the invention is defined only by the<br>
following claims which are intended to embrace all equivalents thereof.<br><br>
