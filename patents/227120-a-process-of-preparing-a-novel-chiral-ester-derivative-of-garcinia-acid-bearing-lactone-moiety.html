				<td>Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to novel chiral derivatives bearing lactone moiety of Garcinia acid and a process for preparing the same.<br>
Background of the invention:<br>
Garcinia acid [(-)-Hydroxycitric acid lactone or (2S,3S)-Tetrahydro-3-hydroxy-5-oxo-2,3-furandicarb6xylic acid] is isolated from the fruits of Garcinia cambogia,Garcinia indica and Garcinia atroviridis. Garcinaia acid for formula la is widely used as an important ingredient in many pharmaceuticai formulations 1-10.<br>
The non-availability of la in the market, in the pure form, has resulted in the limited use of these compounds in the area of organic synthesis and pharmaceutical front . This is due to the lack of any commercially viable large-sca.le manufacturing process. In US patent application No. 09/365,301,1999 an economic, commercially viable, cost effective process for the large- scale isolation of la has been described11 .<br>
Also during the past two decades there has been a great deal of interest to find cheap and potential chiral molecules from chiral pool to accomplish synthetic pathways with a high degree of asymmetric induction 12-25.<br>
Added to this, substituted -butyrolactones are known to be potent antagonists or agonists depending upon the substitution pattern of the -aminobutyric acid receptor, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system 26.<br>
The known methods for obtaining diversity functionalised chiral -lactones are either by the cyclisation of acyclic starting materials such as the sterioselective iodolactonisation of unsaturated 3-hydroxy acids27 or from sugars such as D-ribofuranose or D-glucosamine or carbohydrates such as D-ribose, D-glucose etc28. These chemical modifications involving carbohydrates require tedious protocols.<br>
The object of this invention therefore is to prepare novel chiral derivatives of Garcinia acid and the process of preparing the same.<br>
To achieve the objective this invention provides a process of preparing novel chiral ester derivatives of Garcinia acid bearing lactone ring moiety of formula I-<br>

Dried rinds of the fruits of Garcinia cambogia (2.0 Kg) were cut into small pieces and soaked in hot water. The extract was collected after 20 hours and the process was repeated (4-5 times). The combined extract was concentrated to get a thick mass to which methanol was added. The precipitated pectin was filtered off and the filtrate was further concentrated to a syrup. The syrup was made alkaline by adding sufficient quantity of aqueous sodium; hydroxide solution followed by the addition of methanol till two layers separated. The separated sodium salt of la (lower layer) was washed several times with aqueous methanol. The pure sodium salt was dissolved in sufficient quantity' of 2N hydrochloric acid. To the concentrated solution acetone was added to remove insoluble impurities. The filtrate on concentration yielded crude erystals of Garcinia acid. Upon recrystallisation from acetone-chloroform mixture yielded crystals of la in high purity.<br>
Melting point -.1780 C. Yield : 135.0g<br>
Example2: Disodium(2S,3S)-tetrahydro-3-hydroxy-5-oxo-2,3-furandicarboxylate (Ib) :<br>
To an aqueous solution of Ia (2.0 g, 10.5 mmol, in 10 ml water) saturated sodium bicarbonate solution was added till the pH of the solution is neutral. The residue obtained after evaporation was washed with dry acetone (5 x 20 ml). The product Ib was finally dried under vacuum.<br>

It was extracted with chloroform (3 x 125 ml) and the combined chloroform extracts was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (100 ml) followed by water (2 x 50 ml). The chloroform extract was dried (sodium sulphate) and evaporated to get crude Id (1.5 g).
