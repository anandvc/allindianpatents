The term "pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts" embraces salts with inorganic and organic acids, such as hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methane-sulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid and the like.<br>
It has been found that the compounds of general formulas IA and IB are y-secretase inhibitors and the related compounds maybe useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in later life. Pathologically AD is characterized by the deposition in the brain of amyloid in extracellular plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid plaques are<br>
mainly composed of amyloid peptides (Abeta peptides) which originate from the {3-Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by a series of proteolytic cleavage steps. Several forms of APP have been identified of which the most abundant are proteins of 695, 751 and 770 amino acids length. They all arise from a single gene through differential splicing. The Abeta peptides are derived from the same domain of the APP but differ at their N- and C-termini, the main species are of 40 and 42 amino-acid length.<br>
Abeta peptides are produced from APP through the sequential action of 2 proteolytic enzymes termed (3- and y-secretase. P-Secretase cleaves first in the extracellular domain of APP just outside of the trans-membrane domain (TM) to produce a C-terminal fragment of APP containing the TM- and cytoplasmatic domain<br>
(CTFp). CTFp is the substrate for y-secretase which cleaves at several adjacent positions<br>
within the TM to produce the Aβ peptides and the cytoplasmic fragment The majority of<br>
Abeta peptides is of 40 amino acids length (Aβ40), a minor species carries 2 additional amino acids at its C-terminus. Latter is supposed to be the more pathogenic amyloid peptide.<br><br>
The β-secretase is a typical aspartyl protease. The y-secretase is a proteolytic activity consisting of several proteins, its exact composition is incompletely understood. However, the presenilins are essential components of this activity and may represent a new group of atypical aspartyl proteases which cleave within the TM of their substates and which are themselves polytopic membrane proteins. Other essential components of<br>
y-secretase may be nicastrin and the products of the aph 1 and pen-2 genes. Proven<br>
substrates for y-secretase are the APP and the proteins of the Notch receptor family,<br>
however, y-secretase has a loose substrate specificity and may cleave further membrane proteins unrelated to APP and Notch.<br>
The y-secretase activity is absolutely required for the production of Abeta peptides. This has been shown both by genetic means, i.e., ablation of the presenilin genes and by low-molecular-weight inhibitory compounds. Since according to the amyloid hypothesis or AD the production and deposition of Abeta is the ultimate cause for the disease, it is<br>
thought that selective and potent inhibitors of y-secretase will be useful for the prevention and treatment of AD.<br>
Thus, the compounds of this invention will be useful treating AD by blocking the activity of y-secretase and reducing or preventing the formation of the various amyloidogenic Abeta peptides.<br>

The detailed description can be found below and in Examples 1 - 150 and 159.<br><br>
To a solution of potassium or sodium hydroxide in a solvent, such as ethanol, a methyl-malonate of formula II is added and the mixture is refluxed for about 4 hours. After cooling the reaction mixture is concentrated and dried in conventinal manner and used without further purification in the next step. To a solution of the obtained methylmalonic acid monoethyl ester (III) in tetrahydrofuran, a compound of formula IV, for<br><br>
added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 18 h. After concentration in vacuo HC1 is added and the mixture is extracted, dried and purified as usual. To the obtained solution of a compound of formula V water and lithium hydroxide are added and the mixture is refluxed for about 5 hours. After purification a compound of formula IA may be obtained as follows: To a solution of a compound of formula VI, for example<br><br>
stirred at room temperature for about 18 h. After concentrating, drying and purifying a compound of formula IA is obtained. A compound of formula IB maybe obtained under the same conditions as described above, using a compound of formula VIII.<br><br>
The compounds of formula IB-1 maybe prepared as described in scheme 1 for the last step (VI with VII or VIII-&gt; IA or IB).<br>
The compounds of formula IB-1 are identical with those of formula IB, wherein R , R ,<br>
R2 and R3 are described as above and wherein R4 is -NR R ,<br>
R15 is hydrogen or lower alkyl and<br>
R16is lower alkyl, -(CH2)1,2-CsCH or-(CH2)0,1,2-mono-, di or tricyclic group,<br>
unsubstituted or substituted by R5 to R10 as described above.<br><br><br>
hydrochloride, 1-hydroxybenzotrizole and N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine are added. The mixture is stirred at room temperature for about 12 h. After purification, a compound of formula X is obtained which is treated with an acid, for instance TFA, in a suitable solvent, for instance dichloromethane, to give a compound of formula XI. Using compounds of formula XI and IV, compounds of formula IA can be obtained following the amide coupling procedure described above.<br>
Some compounds of formula IA or IB maybe converted to a corresponding acid addition salt, for example compounds, containing an amine group.<br>
The conversion is accomplished by treatment with at least a stoichiometric amount of an appropriate acid, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids suchas acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyR11vic acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. Typically, the free base is dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as diethyl ether, ethyl acetate, chloroform, ethanol or methanol and the like, and the acid added in a similar solvent. The temperature is maintained between 0 °C and 50 °C. The resulting salt precipitates spontaneously or maybe brought out of solution with a less polar solvent.<br>
The acid addition salts of compounds of formula IA or IB maybe converted to the corresponding free bases by treatment with at least a stoichiometric equivalent of a<br><br>
suitable base such as sodium or potassium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, ammonia, and the like.<br>
The compounds of formulas IA and IB and their pharmaceutically usable addition salts possess valuable pharmacological properties. Specifically, it has been found that the compounds of the present invention may inhibit the y-secretase.<br>
The compounds were investigated in accoR5ance with the test given hereinafter.<br>
Description of y-secretase assay<br>
The activity of test compounds can be evaluated in assays which measure the<br>
proteolytic cleavage of suitable substrates by y-secretase activity. These can be cellular<br>
assays where e.g., a substrate of the y-secretase is fused in its cytoplasmic domain to a transcription factor. Cells are transfected with this fusion gene and a reporter gene, e.g., firefly luciferase, which expression is enhanced by the transcription factor. Cleavage of<br>
the fused substrate by y-secretase will lead to expression of the reporter gene which can<br>
be monitored in appropriate assays. The y-secretase activity can also be determined in<br>
cell-free in vitro asays where e.g., a cell lysate containing the y-secretase complex is incubated with a suitable APP-derived substrate which is cleaved to the Abeta peptides. The amount of produced peptides can be determined with specific ELISA assays. Cell lines of neuronal origin secrete Abeta peptides which can be measured with the specific<br>
ELISA assay. Treatment with compounds which inhibit y-secretase leads to a reduction of secreted Abeta thus providing a measure of inhibition.<br>
The in vitro assay of y-secretase activity uses a HEK293 membrane fraction as a<br>
source of y-secretase and a recombinant APP substrate. Latter consist of the C-terminal 100 amino acids of human APP fused to a 6xHistidin tail for purification which is expressed in E.coli in a regulatable expression vector, e.g. pEtl5. This recombinant<br>
protein corresponds to the tR11ncated APP fragment which results after β-secretase<br>
cleavage of the extracellular domain and which constitutes the y-secretase substrate. The assay principle is described in Li YM et al, PNAS 97(11), 6138-6143 (2000). Hek293 cells are mechanically disR11pted and the microsomal fraction is isolated by differential centrifugation The membranes are solubilized in detergent (0.25 % CHAPSO) and<br>
incubated with the APP substrate. The Abeta peptides which are produced by y-secretase cleavage of the substrate are detected by specific ELISA assays as described (Brockhaus M et al, Neuroreport 9(7), 1481-1486 (1998).<br><br>
The preferred compounds show a IC5o <l.0 in the list below are described some data to y-secretase inhibition:></l.0><br><br>
The compounds of formula IA or IB and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula IA or IB can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. The administration can, however, also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula IA or IB can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, coR11 starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acids or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hardgelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like. Depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oil and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or haR5ened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations can, moreover, contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They can also contain still other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
Medicaments containing a compound of formula IA and IB or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof and a therapeutically inert carrier are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for their production, which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula IA and IB and/or pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical administration form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
In accoR5ance with the invention compounds of formula IA and IB as well as their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are useful in the control or prevention of illnesses based<br>
on the inhibition of the y-secretase, such as of Alzheimer's disease.<br>
The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, have to be adjusted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In the case of oral administration the dosage for adults can vary from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg per day of a compound of general formula I or of the corresponding amount of a pharmaceutically acceptable<br><br>
salt thereof. The daily dosage may be administered as single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper limit can also be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br>
