				<td>Field of Application<br>
The invention relates to the field of Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW), used for<br>
joining two or more pieces of metals together in general and to a method of<br>
producing copper free electrode wire for GMAW, in particular.<br>
Background of the Invention &amp; Prior Art<br>
Reference is made to the following publication:<br>
1.	D.B.Holliday, "Gas Metal Arc Welding," ASM Handbook, p.180-185.<br>
2.	M.Suban and J.Tusek, "Dependence of Melting Rate in MIG/MAG Welding on<br>
the Type of Shielding Gas Used," Journal of Materials Processing Technology,<br>
119,(2000),p. 185-192.<br>
This GMAW process is widely used in the field of general fabrication, automobile,<br>
ship building and construction.<br>
Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) is an arc welding process widely used for joining<br>
at least two pieces of metals together. Required heat of welding is generated<br>
from an electric arc that is established in between a consumable electrode (wire)<br>
and the work piece. An externally supplied gas or gas mixtures act to shield the<br>
arc and the molten weld pool. In this process Ar or CO2 or mixture of it are used<br>
as shielding gas. Schematically GMAW process is shown in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
For the purpose of satisfying quality requirements for a welding electrode wire,<br>
conductive metal such as copper is conventionally plated on wire surface for<br>
smooth welding operation. However, nevertheless several advantage the copper<br>
plated wire, it also has following drawbacks:<br><br>
(A)	Sometime copper is deposited in the form of copper dust in the dents of the<br>
wire surface. During welding process this dust falls from the wire surface and<br>
clogging the welding torch, and therefore, causing welding instability.<br>
(B)	The copper plating is softer than the steel wire surface and thus inevitably<br>
peels off from the surface due to the friction between wire and the welding torch<br>
and thereby causing welding instability due to clogging of torch.<br>
(C)	Copper coating gives barrier protection to the steel wire. However, by any<br>
means if the copper coating peels off or damage, the steel wire corrodes at<br>
much faster rate as compare to bare steel wire.<br>
(D)	The melting point of copper is 1083Â°C and it is easily vaporized at ultra high<br>
temperature during welding operation, generates copper fume which is<br>
detrimental to environment.<br>
(E)	The density of copper is higher than the iron; as a result the surface tension<br>
of copper is higher than the iron. During metal transfer in copper plated wire the<br>
droplet is not in spherical form but is in the form of ellipsoid which is elongated<br>
along the droplet transfer direction. This cause instantaneous short circuit<br>
between droplet and molten pool and facilitates the spatter generation. But in<br>
copper plating free wire, no such kind of instantaneous short circuit phenomenon<br>
is observed resulting less spatter generation.<br>
(F)	During copper plating hazardous chemicals such as H2SO4 and CuSO4 are<br>
used.<br><br>
Object of invention<br>
Copper plated GMAW electrode wire is not only produces hazardous copper fume<br>
but also causes spatter loss and clogging of nozzle during welding. A new<br>
environmental friendly copper free alternate coating has been proposed to<br>
develop which gives higher corrosion resistance, smooth arc, better feedability,<br>
less fume generation, less spatter and improved yield.<br>
The present invention proposes to produce a new coating, free from copper to<br>
overcome the above drawbacks of the copper coating.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Grooves or pits are produced on the; surface of the drawn wire by means of<br>
pickling and other mechanical process. These pits are the potential site of the<br>
deposition of the arc stabilizing compound. Compounds of alkali metal such as<br>
potassium are used as arc stabilizer, It is mainly due to the lower ionization<br>
potential of the potassium which is readily releases electrons and forms ions<br>
which stabilize the arc. Potassium can be used in the form of potassium<br>
carbonate or potassium stearate. Silicone free conductive grease is applied on<br>
the wire surface, which not only enhance the electrical conductivity of the wire<br>
but also helps in smooth feeding during welding and gives barrier protection<br>
against the corrosion of the bare wire.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention will now be described with help of the accompanying drawings<br>
which depict an exemplary embodiments of the invention. However, there can be<br>
several other embodiments, all of which are covered by the description.<br>
The 5-5.5 mm diameter wire rod is pickled using standard hydrochloric acid<br>
solution to remove the oxide layer present on the surface. After boraxing and<br>
phosphating this wire rod is drawn upto 2-3mm diameter by dry drawing<br>
process. The 2-3 mm diameter wire is again pickled using hydrochloric acid to<br>
produce sufficient amount of pits or groves on the drawn surface. After pickling,<br>
dry drawing followed by wet drawing of the wire is carried out upto the 0.8-1.2<br>
mm diameter wire. During the drawing operation potassium based compound<br>
like potassium carbonate and potassium stearate followed by Silicone free<br>
conductive grease are used.<br>
Figure 3(a-d) shows schematically the surface of the wire at different stages of<br>
processing. As shown in Figure 3(b) by pickling operation pits or grooves are<br>
formed on the surface of the wire. Arc stabilizing compounds fills in these pits on<br>
the wire surface, shown in Figure 3(c). After drawing these pits are deformed<br>
and the arc stabilizing compounds are trapped effectively within these pits, as<br>
shown schematically in Figure 3(d).<br>
