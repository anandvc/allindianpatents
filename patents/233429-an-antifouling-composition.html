				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to antifouling agents, to methods of producing and using them, and to antifouling coatings produced therefrom. Antifouling coatings serve for the protection of objects from fouling, particularly ship's hulls, screens, nets, buildings, canal installations, and signaling installations which come into contact with seawater or brackish water.<br>
The occurrence of fouling is a serious problem, particularly for ships, since the frictional resistance is thereby increased and operating costs are considerably increased as a result of increased energy consumption and frequent dry dock maintenance. For this reason, antifouling coatings have long been used to prevent fouling by algae, barnacles, sedentaria, mussels, or other organisms.<br>
A distinction can be made in principle between antifouling coatings that contain biocides and antifouling coatings that do not contain biocides.<br>
Antifouling coatings that contain biocides constitute the state of the art. Organisms that result in fouling are killed off by the biocides. The usual antifouling biocides are organic tin compounds or copper, antimony, and bismuth compounds. The disadvantage of these biocides is their restricted environmental compatibility. Heavy metal biocides are particularly problematical, since these cause contamination of seawater and of the sea bed, particularly in the region of harbors.<br>
Biocide-free antifouling coatings possess anti-adhesion properties intended to physically prevent the attachment of marine organisms. For example, the prior art comprises antifouling coatings based on liquid organosilicone, liquid paraffins, or fluorinated  oils  in combination with  organopolysilicone polymers,  particularly<br><br>
silicone elastomers (see U.S Patent 5,298,060 and DE-A 2,601,928). However, the effectiveness of antifouling coatings such as these is limited. A further disadvantage is their low mechanical loading capacity, which is frequently accompanied by unsatisfactory adhesion to anti-corrosion coatings, due to which the application of an additional primer coat may become necessary.<br>
Copolymers of organic polymers and silicone polymers are also known from the prior art. US-A 4 910 252 and WO 93 13179 describe biocide-free antifouling coatings which contain trialkoxysilane-group-containing polymers, preferably acrylates and linear siloxane polymers. EP 329 375 claims a coating composition of silicone polymers and polyurethane and/or polyurea. WO 98 38251 describes organic/inorganic hybrid materials produced from at least one organic polymer, inorganic (nano)particles and polyfunctional organosilanes.<br>
The mode of action of the abovementioned antifouling coatings is based on the low surface tension of silicone-containing coatings and/or the more or less controlled release of slip additives which are intended to prevent the attachment of marine organisms.<br>
The underlying object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide improved anti-fouling agents, which do not have the afore-mentioned disadvantages of known antifouling agents and the antifouling properties of which can be achieved even without biocides.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that this spectrum of requirements is fulfilled by antifouling agents that contain at least one multifunctional carbosilane and/or carbosiloxane (A), and which also optionally contain at least one additional alkoxysilane (B), a solvent (C) catalyst (D), and/or inorganic nanoparticles (E), and optionally other additives (F).<br><br>
The antifouling agents according to the invention cure at room temperature and are characterized by good adhesion to anti-corrosion coatings and by a high mechanical loading capacity. An additional primer coat is thus not necessary. The antifouling agents according to the invention exhibit a fouling-inhibiting effect and effectively protect objects from fouling, particularly ships' hulls, screens, nets, buildings, canal installations, and signaling installations that come into contact with seawater or brackish water.<br>

with the proviso that the sum of components (A) to (F) amounts to 100% by weight.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to the production of the agent according to the invention, wherein the individual components (A) to (F) are stirred with each other. The individual components can be stirred with each other in any desired sequence using the stirring and dispersion methods known in the lacquer industry until a homogeneous solution or dispersion is formed. It is advantageous for component (D) to be added as the final component and for the agent to be stirred at 15 to 20°C for 30 to 90 minutes prior to application. In a preferred embodiment of the invention a hydrolyzate/condensate which is stable on storage is produced from components (B) to (D) with the addition of water. For the preparation of the hydrolyzate/condensate it is preferable for 0.2 to 0.7, preferably 0.4 to 0.6, moles of water to be added per mole of hydrolyzable group X of the silanes (B) of the general formula (IX). Details of the sol-gel process are for example provided by C. J. Brinker and W. Scherer in "Sol-Gel Science: The Physics and Chemistry of Sol-Gel Processing", Academic Press, New York (1990). After the reaction is complete, the solvent (C) used for the production of the hydrolyzate and the alcohol formed in the reaction of the alkoxysilane (B) can be partially distilled off and/or replaced by a different solvent. In this case the hydrolyzate of (B) to (D) is homogeneously mixed with components (A) and optionally components (E) and (F). The agent can be applied immediately.<br>
The present inventibn further relates to the use of the antifouling agents according to the invention as an antifouling coating, and also relates to such antifouling coatings and to the production thereof.<br>
Antifouling coatings produced using the agents according to the invention can be applied to the marine surface to be protected as a single fouling-preventing coating or brushed coating. The marine surfaces to be protected can also be provided with a primer coat comprising corrosion-preventing paints before the antifouling coating produced using the agent according to the invention is applied.<br><br>

Use examples<br>
The antifouling agents according to the invention are applied by brushing or pneumatic spraying at a spraying pressure of 4 bars through 2 crossed conduits to test plates measuring 650 x 250 mm and coated with a zinc-containing epoxy anti-corrosion ground coat (obtainable for example under the trade name Oldopox® 377-0066 from Relius Coatings) in a dry layer thickness of 50 urn and dried at room temperature for 7 days. The test plates were aged on a raft in Wilhelmshaven. After 3 months almost no fouling was detected on the panels. Fouling in the form of algae or barnacles was removable by rubbing lightly with a cloth.<br>
The antifouling coatings according to the invention have high mechanical stability, high hardness (pencil hardness 3 H to 7 H) and adhere very firmly to the anti-cor¬rosion ground coat employed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
