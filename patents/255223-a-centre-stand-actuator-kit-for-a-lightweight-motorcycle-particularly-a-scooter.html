DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a centre stand and actuator kit for lightweight motorcycles, particularly scooters.<br>
In parking a motorcycle, a centre stand is of primary importance since it offers a more stable two-point surface contact than a side stand, but can be difficult to operate. The rider has press the centre stand against the ground while rocking the motorcycle backwardly, using the stand as a fulcrum. This involves strength not possessed by all riders, especially women and elderly people. Also, the rider must get off the motorcycle in order to engage the centre stand. In view of these drawbacks, many riders prefer using the easily engaged, less stable side stand. Also, when using the side stand instead of the centre stand, more space is occupied by the scooter because of its tilting. It is therefore possible to park more scooters using a centre stand.<br>
EP 1 254 829 Al discloses a hydraulic actuator device for the centre stand of a motorcycle.<br>
It is a general object of this invention to provide a reliable and safe motorcycle stand actuator being particularly adapted for a lightweight motorcycle, particularly a scooter. Another object is to provide a light and compact stand actuator kit.<br>
These and other objects and advantages, which will be better understood hereinafter, are achieved according to the present invention by the provision of a  kit  as  defined  in the appended claims. In order that the present invention may be well understood<br><br>
there will now be described a preferred embodiment thereof, given by way of example, reference being made to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 is a side view of a scooter fitted with a centre stand<br>
actuator kit according to the present invention; FIG. 2 is an enlarged bottom view as indicated by arrows II-<br>
II in FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a view, to an enlarged scale, of a detail of the<br>
kit of this invention shown in FIG. 1; and FIGs. 4 and 5 are perspective views of the kit of FIG. 3 in<br>
two different arrangements.<br>
With reference to the drawings, a preferred embodiment of a centre stand and actuator kit 10 in accordance with the invention is mounted to a lightweight motorcycle M, particularly a scooter. The kit 10 includes an electromechanical actuator 2 0 applied to a centre stand 2 8 rotatable about a transversal horizontal axis. The actuator 20 is driven by an associated reversible DC electric motor 21 powered directly by the motorcycle battery (not shown). The actuator comprises a cylinder 22 and a piston (not shown) with a stem 2 4. Cylinder 22 is pivotally attached to an axis on the motorcycle frame by means of a plain bearing or, in the preferred embodiment, a spherical joint 23.<br>
By means of a threaded peg 26, the stem 24 is pivotally attached to a lug 25 of a bracket 29 fixed as a crossbar to the two legs 27 of the centre stand 28. The stand is rotatably mounted to the main frame of the motorcycle. Ground-contacting feet 30 are mounted at the lower ends of the legs 27 by threaded couplings, so as to adjust the overall  length  of  the  stand  according  to  the  rider7 s<br><br>
requirement. As used herein, terms and expressions indicating positions and orientations, such as "upper", "lower", will be construed with respect to the actuator as it would appear when mounted under a motorcycle. Such terms are used merely for convenience, and are not intended in a limiting sense.<br>
For lowering and raising the stand between a raised, travelling position and a ground contactable position, the driver needs to press corresponding controls 32 (FIG.l) located on the dashboard or elsewhere near the handlebar of the motorcycle. Extension of stem 24 will raise the stand from ground surface contact to a retracted, travelling position. Conversely, retraction of the stem will lower the stand by rotating it forwardly, bringing the feet 30 in contact with the ground. As shown in phantom in FIG.3, continued actuation of actuator 20 towards the fully retracted position of the stem will raise the rear wheel of the motorcycle off the ground. Microswitches (not shown) are provided to cut-off the current to motor 21 upon detecting full retraction or extension of the piston of actuator 2 0.<br>
Should a failure occur in the electrical supply, the stand can be operated manually, by removing the threaded peg 26 from its normal position (shown in FIG. 4) so as to disconnect the stand from the actuator, and placing the same pin in a threaded seat 31 formed on a side surface of the stand in such manner that the pin will project sideways (FIG. 5) in order to be engaged by the rider's foot to rotate the stand between the retracted position and the ground contacting position. Preferably the threaded seat 31 is provided either on one or both the right and left ground-contacting feet 30.<br><br>
Operation of the actuator is controlled by the position of the ignition key or switch. A safety factor is provided in assuring that the actuator cannot be operated while the scooter is still travelling, whereby the stand will remain in the retracted state the scooter has come to a stop. Additionally, the actuator and/or the stand is connected to engine power take-off means so that the engine cannot be switched on until the stand is in its raised position. A warning light on the dashboard informs the rider about the raised position of the stand. Furthermore, the scooter may comprise linkage means connecting the stand or the actuator to engine power take-off means. Particularly, the electric circuitry . may allow electric motor energization while the scooter transmission is in the "neutral" position. Safety interlocks can be provided to disable the circuit if the motorcycle gears are engaged.<br>
Finally, it will be appreciated that with a lightweight motorcycle such as a scooter, an electromechanical actuator is advantageous being light, cheap and simpler as compared to a hydraulic actuator, since it does not require a hydraulic<br>
circuit.<br>
While a specific embodiment of the invention has been disclosed, it is to be understood that such disclosure has been merely for the purpose of illustration and that the invention is not to be limited in any manner thereby. Various modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art in view of the foregoing example. The scope of the invention is to be limited only by the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
1.	A centre stand actuator kit for a lightweight<br>
motorcycle, particularly a scooter, the kit comprising:<br>
a bracket member rigidly fixable to a centre stand unit, the stand unit having a first end adapted to be pivotally attached to an axis on a frame of a motorcycle, the stand unit being rotatable thereabout between a lifted travelling position and a lowered ground contacting position,<br>
actuator means for rotating the stand unit between said lifted and lowered positions, the actuator means including a first actuator member adapted to be pivotally attached to the motorcycle frame and a second actuator member slidingly coupled to the first actuator member and pivotally attachable to the bracket member;<br>
wherein the second actuator member is removably attachable to the bracket member by a peg having a coupling portion for coupling alternatively<br>
either  to  the  second  actuator member  and  the<br>
bracket, to ensure connection therebetween in order to<br>
actuate the stand through said actuator means,<br>
or to a corresponding seat for the peg, the seat<br>
being securable or secured on a side of the centre stand<br>
unit in order to actuate the stand by foot with the peg<br>
projecting sideways from the stand.<br>
2.	A kit according to claim 1, wherein the stand unit comprises ground engaging feet, and the said seat is located on at least one ground engaging foot,<br>
3.	A kit according to claim 1, wherein the stand unit comprises ground engaging feet adjustably mounted at the<br><br>
lower ends of the stand by threaded couplings, so as to adjust the overall length of the stand.<br>
4,	A kit according to claim 1, wherein the actuator means<br>
include an electromechanical actuator.<br>
5.	A kit according to claim 1, wherein the coupling portion<br>
of the peg is a threaded portion, and said seat is a<br>
