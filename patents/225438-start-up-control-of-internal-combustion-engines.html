				<td>START-UP CONTROL OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
The present invention relates to internal combustion engines, and more<br>
particularly, but not exclusively, is directed to techniques to control start-up of a<br>
diesel-fueled, intermittent combustion type of engine driving an electrical power<br>
generator.<br>
The ease with which an engine may be started frequently depends on a<br>
number of factors. By way of nonlimiting example, temperature is one such factor,<br>
with warm engines typically requiring less fuel to start than cold engines.<br>
Depending on the particular parameters involved, the amount of fuel used to start<br>
an engine can vary, which can impact the rate at which the engine accelerates to a<br>
target rotational engine speed. The amount of time it takes to reach this target<br>
engine speed from the initiation of engine start and/or the character of the attendant<br>
acceleration profile is often of particular interest in electrical power generation<br>
applications. Correspondingly, the fuel usage profile is frequently of interest —<br>
especially in the case of diesel-fueled engines for which the level of smoke<br>
generated upon start-up can vary significantly with fueling. Existing schemes<br>
typically attempt to reach a.desired speed in a manner that does not adequately<br>
account for initial fueling fluctuation, often involves many different parameters,<br>
may significantly overshoot the target speed, and can result in excessive smoke<br>
production. Thus, there is a need for further contributions to this technology.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
One embodiment of the present invention is a unique internal combustion<br>
engine system. Other embodiments include unique methods, systems, apparatus,<br>
and devices to regulate engine operation.<br>
A further embodiment includes providing fuel to start an internal<br>
combustion engine, determining the engine has started, controlling acceleration of<br>
the engine in response to this determination to reach a target engine speed, and<br>
driving an electric power generator with the engine at least while operating at the<br>
target engine speed. In one form, the engine includes a number of combustion<br>
chambers and corresponding reciprocating pistons, and the amount of fuel to start<br>
the engine is provided as a function of engine temperature. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, the initial start-up of the engine can be determined as a function of<br>
rotational engine speed and/or a speed governor may be utilized once the target<br>
engine speed is reached.<br>
Another embodiment of the present invention includes a system,<br>
comprising: an internal combustion engine with a number of fuel injectors each<br>
operable to fuel a corresponding one of a number of combustion chambers, and a<br>
controller operatively coupled to the injectors to provide a desired amount of fuel<br>
to start the engine, detect initial engine start-up, and regulate engine acceleration<br>
from the initial engine start-up to a target engine speed. In one form, the engine<br>
operates as a prime mover for an electric power generator. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, an engine temperature sensor and engine rotation sensor can be<br>
included, with the engine temperature being utilized to determine the desired<br>
amount of fuel for starting the engine and the engine rotation sensor being utilized<br>
to determine when the engine has initially started and to regulate engine<br>
acceleration. The engine rotation sensor may further be utilized to provide speed<br>
governing of the engine once the target engine speed is reached.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, an internal combustion<br>
engine includes a crank-shaft and a number of fuel injectors each operable to fuel a<br>
corresponding one of a number of combustion chambers. This embodiment further<br>
includes an electrical power generator, means for sensing engine temperature,<br>
means for sensing rotational engine speed, means for providing an amount of fuel<br>
to start the engine as a function of engine temperature, means for determining<br>
initial self-sustained operation of the engine as a function of the rotational engine<br>
speed, means for controlling engine acceleration from the initial operation to reach<br>
a target engine speed at a target time, and means for driving the electric power<br>
generator with the engine system.<br>
Accordingly, it is one object of the present invention to provide a unique<br>
internal combustion engine system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a unique method,<br>
system, apparatus, or device to regulate engine operation.<br>
Further embodiments, forms, features, objects, advantages, benefits, and<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SELECTED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the purposes of promoting an understanding of the principles of the<br>
invention, reference will now be made to the embodiments illustrated in the<br>
drawings and specific language will be used to describe the same. It will<br>
nevertheless be understood that no limitation of the scope of the invention is<br>
thereby intended. Any alterations and further modifications in the described<br>
embodiments, and any further applications of the principles of the invention as<br>
described herein are contemplated as would normally occur to one skilled in the art<br>
to which the invention relates.<br>
Fig. 1 depicts eJectric power generation system 20 of one embodiment of<br>
the present invention. System 20 includes electric power generator 22. Preferably,<br>
generator 22 is of a conventional electromagnetic type which converts the input<br>
mechanical energy from rotation of shaft 24 into a generally sinusoidal Alternating<br>
Current (A.C.) electric output on generator bus Gl. Generator bus Gl is input to<br>
power routing switch 25. Similarly, utility power bus Ul is input to switch 25.<br>
Switch 25 is configured to select between buses Gl and Ul as a source of power<br>
for bus LD1. Bus LD1 is operatively coupled to load 26 to supply electric power<br>
thereto. Generator 22 may be configured for single phase or multiphase operation,<br>
as appropriate for load 26. Also, an electric power output other than a sinusoidal<br>
waveform or A.C. type may be utilized as would occur to those skilled in the art.<br>
System 20 also includes engine 30. Engine 30 is a prime mover for<br>
generator 22. Engine 30 is of a reciprocating piston variety. Shaft 24 of generator<br>
22 is coupled to engine 30 by shaft coupling 28. Shaft coupling 28 may include a<br>
gear box, clutch, or other mechanical arrangement to suitably couple crankshaft 34<br>
of engine 30 to shaft 24 of generator 22. In one embodiment, coupling 28 includes<br>
a clutch to selectively couple and decouple shafts 24 and 34. Additionally,<br>
coupling 28 may include intermeshing gears to change the rotational speed of shaft<br>
24 relative to shaft 34 and may also include a number of selectable gears to change<br>
the gear ratio. In still other embodiments, shaft 34 and shaft 24 may be directly<br>
coupled to provide a one-to-one turning ratio.<br>
In addition to crankshaft 34, engine 30 includes a number of cylinders Cl-<br>
C6 each having a corresponding reciprocating piston P1-P6 that is rotatably<br>
coupled to crankshaft 34 by a connecting rod in a conventional manner. Each pair<br>
of cylinders C1-C6 and pistons P1-P6 in turn corresponds to one of a respective<br>
number of combustion chambers 35 of engine 30. Engine 30 also includes fuel<br>
injectors 11-16 each shown in fluid communication with one of chambers 35.<br>
System 20 further includes engine starting device (S.D.) 36 coupled to<br>
engine 30. Starting device 36 may be of a conventional starter motor powered by a<br>
battery. In other embodiments, starting device 36 can be of a different type or may<br>
be absent, with engine start-up assistance being provided in a different manner.<br>
System 20 also includes fueling subsystem 40. Subsystem 40 includes fuel<br>
source 42 operatively coupled to fueling conduit 44. Fueling conduit 44 is in fluid<br>
communication with fuel rail 46. Fuel injectors 11-16 receive fuel from fuel rail 46<br>
to selectively inject fuel into each cylinder C1-C6. Fueling with injectors 11-16<br>
may be by port injection, direct injection, or using such other injection techniques<br>
as would occur to those skilled in the art. Preferably, fuel injectors 11-16 are of a<br>
conventional electromagnetic variety responsive to an input electronic signal IS1-<br>
IS6 (collectively designated signals IS). Engine 30 is of the multicycle type with<br>
intermittent combustion in each cylinder C1-C6 intermittently contributing power<br>
in accordance with a timed sequence of fueling and ignition operations. Engine 30<br>
is of a conventional four-stroke, reciprocating piston variety. However, in lieu of a<br>
reciprocating piston-based engine, a rotor-based engine may be utilized in an<br>
alternative embodiment of the present invention. Also, in other embodiments, an<br>
engine with a different number of operating cycles, such as a two-cycle sequence,<br>
may be utilized. Engine 30 is configured to operate with a diesel fuel supplied<br>
from fuel source 42 that is injected with injectors 11-16, and is of the Compression<br>
Ignition (CI) variety. As such, it may include glow plugs (not shown) to control<br>
combustion temperature. Alternatively, engine 30 could be configured for other<br>
fuel types used such as gasoline, alcohol, a gaseous fuel (a "gaseous fuel" refers to<br>
a fuel which is in the gaseous state when contained at standard temperature and<br>
pressure), a different fuel as would occur to those skilled in the art, or a<br>
combination of these; and correspondingly be of a different ignition type, such as a<br>
Spark Ignition (SI) variety.<br>
Air is supplied to cylinders C1-C6 via air intake path 50. Air intake path<br>
50 includes throttle valve 52 positioned therealong to control air flow through<br>
conduit 54 to intake manifold 56. Air from intake manifold 56 is mixed with fuel<br>
from injectors 11-16 to selectively provide a combustible charge in each of<br>
cylinders C1-C6. Engine 30 also includes exhaust pathway 60. Exhaust from<br>
engine 30 exits along pathway 60 through conduit 64. A controllable wastegate<br>
valve 62 is included to selectively vent exhaust gases through wastegate outlet 66.<br>
The intake air pathway 50 and exhaust pathway 60 include components of<br>
turbocharger 70. Turbocharger 70 includes compressor 72 which draws air<br>
through inlet 74 into conduit 54 of pathway 50. The intake air pressurized by<br>
compressor 72 is cooled by aftercooler 58 before passing through throttle valve 52.<br>
Throttle valve 52 and aftercooler 58 may be of conventional variety commonly<br>
used in internal combustion engines. Compressor 72 is driven by turbine 78 via<br>
coupling 76. Coupling 76 may include a rotatable shaft, pulley and belt<br>
arrangement, intermeshing gears, or such other arrangement to drive compressor<br>
72 with turbine 78 as would occur to those skilled in the art. In still other<br>
embodiments, multistage compressors, multistage turbines, variable geometry<br>
turbines and/or compressors, or a combination of these are envisioned. In yet<br>
another embodiment, turbocharger 70 is absent.<br>
Turbine 78 is driven by exhaust gasses passing through conduit 64 along<br>
exhaust pathway 60. To control the pressure and flow rate through pathways 60<br>
and 50, wastegate valve 62 may be selectively opened in response to a control<br>
signal WG. By reducing the flow of exhaust gasses to turbine 78, the rotation of<br>
both compressor 72 and turbine 78 typically decreases. As a result, the pressure of<br>
air supplied along pathway 50 also decreases. Also, the rotation of turbine 78<br>
varies with temperature of the exhaust gases driving it.<br>
System 20 further includes controller 90. Preferably, controller 90 is of a<br>
programmable microprocessor variety known to those skilled in the art. Controller<br>
90 is operatively coupled to throttle valve 52 and wastegate 62 supplying<br>
corresponding adjustment signals TLT, WG; respectively, as required. Controller<br>
90 is also coupled to rotation sensor 91 which is configured to supply signal R<br>
indicative of rotation of shaft 34. Preferably, signal R provides conventional crank<br>
angle information about engine 30 which may be utilized for timing operation of<br>
engine 30. Rotational engine speed, designated as signal n, is determined from<br>
signal R in a conventional manner. In one embodiment, signal R corresponds to a<br>
pulse train, the frequency of which is directly proportional to the rotational speed<br>
of engine 30. Signal n may then be provided by monitoring the pulse train<br>
frequency. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,165,271 to Stepper et al.; 5,460,134 to Ott et al.; and<br>
5,469,823 to Ott et al. are representative of an arrangement suitable for providing<br>
signals R and n. Controller 90 is further coupled to starting device 36 to regulate<br>
operation thereof.<br>
Controller 90 is also coupled to temperature sensor 92 to provide engine<br>
temperature as signal ET. Controller 90 is operatively coupled to pressure sensor<br>
93 to provide intake manifold pressure signal IMP. Controller 90 is also<br>
operatively coupled to torque sensor 94. Sensor 94 is associated with a flywheel<br>
along shaft 34 to determine brake torque or "shaft torque" of engine 30 which is<br>
designated as signal Tb. Controller 90 is operatively coupled to an exhaust gas<br>
oxygen sensor 95 to monitor oxygen content of the exhaust stream exiling conduit<br>
84. Signal EGO corresponds to the detected oxygen level in the exhaust stream.<br>
Controller 90 is also configured to generate a signal READY which is provided to<br>
an indicator 96 to indicate that engine 30 is ready to accept block loading from<br>
generator 22. Signal READY is sent to switch 25 to control operation thereof.<br>
Fig. 2 is a flow chart of start-up routine 120 for system 20 that is executed<br>
in accordance with programming or other logic of controller 90. Start-up routine<br>
120 begins with conditional 122 which tests whether or not to initiate engine start-<br>
up. If so, routine 120 proceeds to operation 124. In operation 124, an initial<br>
fueling amount to be provided to the engine is determined based on engine<br>
temperature. In the case of engine 30, this fueling amount can be determined in<br>
accordance with temperature detected with engine temperature sensor 92. A<br>
schedule, table, and/or mathematical function can be used by controller 90 to<br>
determine initial start-up fueling for engine 30, and generate corresponding fueling<br>
signals for injectors 11-16. Likewise, controller 90 can activate starting device 36<br>
to crank engine 30 during supply of the initial fuel amount, as part of operation<br>
124. Typically, when the engine is relatively warm, a minimal amount of fuel is<br>
needed and the engine fires quickly with little or no fuel accumulation. On the<br>
other hand, in the case of a relatively cold engine, excess fuel sometimes<br>
accumulates in the combustion chambers before the engine fires. As this excess<br>
fuel bums, there can be a sudden increase in engine acceleration.<br>
Once cranking of the engine with this initial amount of fuel begins, routine<br>
120 proceeds to a series of conditionals 130 and 132 to determine if the engine has<br>
attained an initial operating state. This operating state can be reflective of initial<br>
self-sustained operation -- such that assistance by starting device 36 is no longer<br>
needed. Conditional 130 tests if the engine speed n is greater than threshold nCAL<br>
(n &gt; nCAL). If the test of conditional 130 is affirmative, routine continues with<br>
operation 134. If the test of conditional 130 is negative, routine 120 continues<br>
with conditional 132, which tests if the rotational engine acceleration n'is grcjiler<br>
than threshold nXDAL (n' &gt; nCAL). If the test of conditional 132 is also negative,<br>
operation 128 is next encountered in which the amount of fuel supplied to the<br>
engine is increased by a predetermined increment up to a maximum value. With<br>
this ramped-up amount, the test of conditional 130 is again performed which, if<br>
negative, results in performing the test of conditional 132. If both conditional 130<br>
and 132 remain negative again, operation 128 is again encountered to provide a<br>
further increment in the fueling. In this manner as long as the tests of both<br>
conditionals 130 and 132 are negative, operation 128 is repeated, gradually<br>
increasing the amount of fuel supplied to the engine up to a predefined limit. In<br>
contrast, if the test of either of conditionals 130 or 132 is affirmative, routine 120<br>
continues with operation 134 and cranking assistance with starting device 36 is no<br>
longer needed.<br>
Conditionals 130 and 132, and operation 128 cooperate to detect if the<br>
initial operating state of the engine has been attained. The engine speed n for<br>
conditional 130 can be determined with rotation sensor 91, and engine acceleration<br>
n' for conditional 132 can be determined from engine speed n. Comparisons to<br>
thresholds nCAL and n'CAL can be performed with logic of controller 90. In one<br>
embodiment, thresholds nCAL and n'CAL are calibration parameters stored in<br>
memory accessed by controller 90. The incremental fueling can be determined by<br>
controller logic by accessing a schedule, table, corresponding mathematical<br>
function, or the like; and implemented by sending appropriate fueling signals to the<br>
fuel injectors.<br>
Referring additionally to Fig. 3, conditionals and operations 124-132<br>
correspond to an initial fueling mode 320 of engine 30. As routine proceeds from<br>
conditional 130 or 132 to operation 134, initial fueling mode 320 is exited and an<br>
acceleration control mode 330 is initiated. Both modes 320 and 330 are shown in<br>
Fig. 3 under crank control 335.<br>
In operation 134 of mode 330, engine acceleration is determined with a<br>
Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) control based on the current engine speed n<br>
and available time to reach a target rotational engine speed TS. In other words,<br>
engine acceleration n' determined from engine speed n becomes a closed-loop<br>
feedback variable for PID compensation, where the target acceleration necessary to<br>
reach a target rotational engine speed TS is calculated based on a target time<br>
interval TT. Target time interval TT typically begins with engine start-up<br>
initiation. Operation 134 of mode 330 is initiated at time tl, which represents the<br>
varying time interval during which the initial fueling mode 320 of routine 120 was<br>
performed. From the initiation of operation 134, the available performance time<br>
PT to reach target rotational engine speed TS is also variable, being the target time<br>
interval TT less tl (PT=TT-tl). Accordingly, a target acceleration from time tl to<br>
provide TS by time TT could be the engine speed difference obtained by<br>
subtracting the engine speed when mode 330 begins (ES) from TS divided by PT<br>
((TS-ES)/PT).<br>
Conditional 136 of routine 120 represents the corresponding comparison to<br>
determine if the target engine rotational speed TS has been reached. If the test of<br>
conditional 136 is negative, routine 120 returns to continue operation 134. If the<br>
test of conditional 136 is positive, routine 120 continues with operation 138 in<br>
which a third mode corresponding to an engine speed governor control mode 340<br>
is initiated. The PID control of operation 134 and corresponding comparison of<br>
conditional 136 can be implemented in part or in total with logic executed by<br>
controller 90. Typically, controller 90 is configured to activate switch 25 such that<br>
it begins to transmit power from generator 22 once the target speed TS is reached<br>
with the engine being subject to engine speed governor control mode 340. This<br>
speed governing can also be executed with logic of controller 90.<br>
Referring specifically to Fig. 3, the irregular polygon-shaped region 325<br>
represents the typical operating ranges of fueling and engine speed for one<br>
embodiment. It should be further understood that fueling percentage Fl is the<br>
initial fueling percentage used by operation 124 of routine 120. If this percentage<br>
ramps up through execution of operation 128, it is incrementally increased towards<br>
the fueling percentage limit F2 shown in Fig. 3. F2 serves as the maximum fuel<br>
amount during the operation of initial fueling mode 320. As further shown in Fig.<br>
3, nCAL corresponds to the value used in the test of conditional 130 and TS<br>
corresponds to the target speed tested with conditional 136. Between the values of<br>
nCAL and TS is the range in which the acceleration control mode 330 operates. It<br>
should be appreciated that initial fueling mode 320 and acceleration control mode<br>
330 are both components of a crank control 335 which corresponds to conditionals<br>
and operations 122-136 of routine 120. Speed governor control mode 340 operates<br>
once the target speed TS is reached as presented in the graph of Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 4 is a comparative graph of speed and smoke opacity curves.<br>
Specifically, nl and S01 correspond to a speed versus time curve and a smoke<br>
opacity versus time curve for a standard type of diesel engine start-up. In contrast,<br>
n2 and S02 correspond to a speed versus time curve and a smoke opacity versus<br>
time curve for an engine operated in accordance with routine 120. Notably, curve<br>
n2 reaches a steady state target time of about five seconds with less variation,<br>
ringing, and overshoot than speed curve n 1. Likewise, the degree of smoke<br>
indicated by smoke opacity curve S02 is substantially less than that of smoke<br>
opacity curve SOI.<br>
Controller 90 may be comprised of digital circuitry, analog circuitry, or<br>
both. Also, controller 90 may be programmable, a dedicated state machine, or a<br>
hybrid combination of programmable and dedicated hardware. Controller 90 can<br>
be an electronic circuit comprised of one or more components that are assembled<br>
as a common unit. Alternatively, for a multiple component embodiment, one or<br>
more of these components may be distributed throughout the relevant system. In<br>
one embodiment, controller 90 includes an integrated processing unit operatively<br>
coupled to one or more solid-state memory devices that contains programming to<br>
be executed by the processing unit in accordance with the principals of the present<br>
invention. The memory may be either volatile or nonvolatile and may additionally<br>
or alternatively be of the magnetic, optical, or such other variety as would occur to<br>
one skilled in the art. Besides the memory and processing unit, controller 90 can<br>
include any control clocks, interfaces, signal conditioners, filters, Analog-to-<br>
Digitai (A/D) converters, Digital-to-Analog (D/A) converters, communication<br>
ports, or other types of operators as would occur to those skilled in the art to<br>
implement the principles of the present invention. In a further form, an integrated<br>
circuit processing unit of controller 90 may be provided with corresponding<br>
memory and any associated circuitry as part of a control panel coupled to engine<br>
30. For this form, the panel can include a key-switch for operator<br>
activation/deactivation of system 20. Alternatively or additionally, this panel can<br>
include one or more hardwired and/or wireless connections to one or more remote<br>
control devices to start, stop, or adjust engine parameters such as target engine<br>
speed. Sensors of the present invention may provide a signal in either a digital or<br>
analog format compatible with associated equipment. Correspondingly, equipment<br>
coupled to each sensor is configured to condition and convert sensor signals to the<br>
appropriate format, as required.<br>
As further described in connection with Figs. 3 and 4, routine 120 of Fig. 2<br>
provides a procedure to reach a target rotational engine speed within a target time<br>
range via mode 330 even though initial fueling may vary considerably during<br>
mode 320. Moreover, the level of smoke generated is typically reduced through<br>
this procedure compared to a generalized procedure that ramps to a target<br>
rotational engine speed through an open-loop process without control over<br>
acceleration, with fewer parameters to tune and less risk of overshoot. Unlike<br>
other arrangements, mode 330 utilizes all the available time to reach the target<br>
speed. Accordingly, in the case of a quick-start, the relatively greater amount of<br>
time to reach rated speed can be used to strive for smoke reduction — such as by<br>
reducing acceleration. Alternatively, when a greater amount of time is used during<br>
mode 320, a greater acceleration is used during mode 330, at the possible sacrifice<br>
of greater smoke production, to assure target speed within the target time.<br>
Naturally, in other embodiments, smoke level, target speed, and/or target time to<br>
reach target speed can be prioritized differently; and/or one or more may not be of<br>
concern.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph of engine fueling versus time depicting a further<br>
embodiment of an initial fueling mode 420 that can be implemented instead of<br>
mode 320 during execution of routine 120. For mode 420, engine fueling begins at<br>
an initial fueling percentage Fl. At time Tl, a transition from Fl to F2 is initiated<br>
to transfer from an initial fueling state to an acceleration control state in<br>
accordance with the indicated envelope. At time T2, this transition is complete,<br>
and mode 420 terminates with an initial fueling exit envelope corresponding to the<br>
duration from time T2 to T3.<br>
In other embodiments, engine 30, controller 90, and routine 120 (or<br>
corresponding variations thereof) can be used to drive a device different than<br>
generator 22. For example, a pump or other machine where a generally constant<br>
rotational speed of a driving member is desired. In another example, off-road<br>
vehicles, such as earth-moving equipment, may be configured to utilize routine<br>
120. Other forms of the present invention can include an engine that uses<br>
carburction fueling with or without injection fueling. Alternatively or additionally,<br>
a non-diesel fuel could be used and/or a different ignition type, such as the SI<br>
variety.<br>
As used herein, it should be appreciated that: variable, criterion,<br>
characteristic, quantity, amount, value, constant, flag, data, record, threshold, limit,<br>
input, output, matrix, command, and look-up table, each generally correspond to<br>
one or more signals within processing equipment of the present invention. It is<br>
contemplated that various functional blocks, operators, operations, stages,<br>
conditionals, procedures, thresholds, and processes described in connection with<br>
the present invention could be altered, rearranged, substituted, deleted, duplicated,<br>
combined, or added as would occur to those skilled in the art without departing<br>
from the spirit of the present invention.<br>
All publications, patent, and patent applications cited in this specification<br>
