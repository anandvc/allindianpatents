				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to a connector for stringing beads into a<br>
strand and, more particularly, to a connector for a strand of pearls or similar beads<br>
which does not require the use of a continuous string.<br>
It is well known and very common to form a strand of beads, each of<br>
which has been through-bored, on a string to form a necklace, bracelet or the like.<br>
String material of braided silk is commonly used, but other flexible string materials<br>
have also been used. String-like materials may have to be replaced from time to time,<br>
and are subject to breakage mat often results in the loss of beads. However, suitable<br>
substitutes for siring materials have not been found. It is known in the art to utilize<br>
metal strand connectors that extend through the bores in a string of beads, are provided<br>
with end eyelets to connect with the eyelets of adjacent beads and form an<br>
interconnected strand. However, such connectors have been of complex construction,<br>
difficult to assemble, and/or result in a strand of beads mat is much too stiff as<br>
compared, for example, to a string-like material that it is intended to replace.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a connector and related method for<br>
interconnecting through-bored beads to provide a strand without the use of a continuous<br>
string but in a manner mat retains significant flexibility in the strand. The connector of<br>
the present invention, in its basic embodiment, comprises a loop member that is made<br>
from a first metal strand that is formed to define a pair of legs interconnected by a first<br>
eyelet The legs define an attachment slot and are sized to fit in one end of the bore in<br>
the bead. At least one of the legs is provided with a first tooth that is positioned in the<br>
slot A cooperating pin member is made from a second metal strand and is formed with<br>
a straight shank that is curled on one end to form a second eyelet The shank is sized to<br>
fit into me omer end of the bore and has formed on me omer end a second tooth. The<br>
second tooth is adapted to override the first tooth of the loop member in response to<br>
insertion of the toothed end of the shank into me attachment slot to lock the members<br>
together in the bore.<br><br>
In accordance with the corresponding method of the present invention, the<br>
method comprises the steps of (1) forming a loop member from a first metal strand<br>
having a pair of legs connected by a first eyelet, and providing one of said legs with a<br>
first tooth extending toward the other leg, (2) framing a pin member from a second<br>
metal strand having a straight shank that is curled on one end to form a second eyelet<br>
and provided on the other end with a second tooth, (3) inserting me legs of the loop<br>
member and the toothed end of the pin member shank into opposite ends of the through<br>
bore in a bead, and (4) causing the second tooth to pass between the legs and into<br>
locking engagement with the first tooth, leaving the first and second eyelets positioned<br>
outside and immediately adjacent the opposite ends of the bore. The method also<br>
includes, prior to the inserting step, the step of connecting the first eyelet of a second<br>
loop member to said second eyelet and connecting the second eyelet of a second pin<br>
member to said first eyelet, thereby providing connection for the next adjacent beads in<br>
the strand.<br>
Preferably, the first tooth is formed to be positioned on the leg of the loop<br>
member adjacent the transition of the leg into the first eyelet. The first tooth on the leg<br>
of the loop member preferably defines a laterally extending locking edge, and the<br>
second tooth on the pin member similarly defines a laterally extending locking edge<br>
which overrides the locking edge of the first tooth in response to insertion of the pin<br>
member shank into the slot in the loop member. In an alternate embodiment, both legs<br>
of the loop member may be provided with opposed teeth, either one of which may be<br>
engaged by the second tooth on the pin member, depending on its rotational orientation<br>
upon insertion.	<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Referring first to Figs. 1-3, the stringless connector for a strand 10 of<br>
beads 11 comprises a two-piece assembly that includes a pin member 12 (Fig. 2) and a<br>
loop member 13 (Fig. 3). The members 12 and 13 are adapted to be inserted into<br>
opposite ends of a through bore 14 in a bead 11 (see Fig. S) where they engage and lock<br>
to one another. Both the pin member 12 and the loop member 13 are made from metal<br>
strands, preferably a metal mat exhibits both malleability and some resilience, such as a<br>
gold alloy commonly used in me manufacture of jewelry.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the pin member 12 includes a straight shank 15, one<br>
end of which is curled or bent back on itself to form an eyelet 16. The opposite end of<br>
the shank IS is formed to define a locking tooth 17. The locking tooth has a laterally<br>
extending lead edge 18 and a laterally extending locking edge 20, between which edges<br>
is a generally flat ramp surface 21. A portion of me shank 15 immediately adjacent the<br>
tooth 17 is provided with aflat surface 22 that terminates at the tooth to define a<br>
locking surface 23 on me back side of the tooth 17.<br>
In Fig. 3, the cooperating loop member 13 is also formed from a metal<br>
strand which is formed by bending to define a pair of generally parallel legs 24 that are<br>
interconnected by an integral eyelet 25. On one of the legs 24, immediately adjacent<br>
the transition of the leg to the eyelet 25, a locking tooth 26 is formed. The tooth 26 has<br>
a laterally extending locking edge 27 which defines with the adjacent inside surface of<br>
the eyelet 25 a locking surface 28. As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the legs 24 on the loop<br><br>
member 13 are sized to allow them to be inserted into one end of the through, bore 14 in<br>
a bead 11. Preferably, the legs are received in the bore with a loose contact fit as shown<br>
in Fig. 5. When positioned in the bore 14, the legs 24 of 1he loop member 13 define an<br>
attachment slot 30 therebetween. The legs are preferably tapered toward their ends 29<br>
to provide a lead-in for the pin member 12. The pin member 12 is then inserted into the<br>
opposite end of the bore 14 until the lead edge 18 of me tooth 17 enters the slot 30 and,<br>
with the pin member 12 oriented such that the ramp surface 21 on the tooth 17 engages<br>
the inside of the loop member leg 24 on which the tooth 26 is formed, the tooth 17 on<br>
the pin member 12 will override the locking tooth 26 on me loop member 13, spreading<br>
the legs 24 apart slightly (Fig. 6) and locking the teeth together with their respective<br>
locking surfaces 23 and 28 in engagement (Fig. 4). The malleability and resilience of<br>
the preferred gold alloy material from which the members 12 and 13 are formed permits<br>
locking engagement of the members in a manner which secures the interlock in a<br>
surprisingly strong interengagement Tensile loads applied to the connection along the<br>
axis of the through bore 14 result in uncurling of the eyelet 16 on the pin member 12<br>
without breaking the engagement between the interengaging teeth 17 and 26. The<br>
connection between the pin member 12 and the loop member 13 may be enhanced by<br>
providing a slight curve in the legs 24 of the loop member 13 as shown in Figs. 4,5 and<br>
7. The outer surfaces of the legs are slightly concave so that, when the legs of the loop<br>
member are inserted into the bore 14 in the bead, the ends 29 of the legs will bear<br>
against the surface of the bore. When the pin member 12 is inserted into the slot 30<br>
between the legs 24, the legs will flatten slightly as they are deflected by passage of the<br>
tooth 17 on the pin member 12 (see Fig. 6). After the tooth 17 rides over the locking<br>
tooth 26 on the loop member 13, the legs may return somewhat to the Fig. 5 position.<br>
As indicated above and with reference to Fig. 5, connection of the<br>
members 12 and 13 of the preferred embodiment requires mat the members be properly<br>
oriented when inserted into the bore 14 so that the locking teeth 17 and 26 will properly<br>
engage. This requires not only that the members be oriented with their respective<br>
eyelets 16 and 25 lying generally in the same plane, but with the pin oriented<br>
rotationally so that the terminal end of the eyelet 16 is on the same side as the toothed<br>
leg 24 of the loop member 13. To alleviate somewhat the requirement of careful<br><br>
orientation, Fig. 8 shows an alternate embodiment in which a modified loop member 31<br>
is provided with legs 32, each of which has a locking tooth 33. The pin member 12 is<br>
unchanged from the preferred embodiment With the Fig. 8 embodiment, as long as the<br>
eyelet 16 of the pin member and the eyelet 34 of the modified loop member 13 are<br>
oriented in the same plane, rotational orientation of the members need not be a concern<br>
since me tooth 17 on the pin member will engage one or the other of the locking teeth<br>
33 on the legs 32 of the modified loop member. The pin member 12 could also be<br>
modified to provide a pair of opposed teeth and used with the loop member 13 of the<br>
preferred embodiment, but it is believed that the reduced section at the end of the pin<br>
member shank formed with two teeth would result in a significant loss of strength in the<br>
interconnection of the members.<br>
In the actual assembly of strand 10 of beads 11, and referring also to Fig.<br>
4, prior to assembly of the pin member 12 to the loop member 13, the eyelet 25 of a<br>
second loop member 13 is connected to the eyelet 16 of the pin member 12. Similarly,<br>
the eyelet 16 of a second pin member 12 is connected to the eyelet 25 of the first loop<br>
member 13. Each of the final connections may also be strengthened by soldering the<br>
terminal end 19 of the eyelet 16 to the shank 15 of the pin member 12. It is<br>
contemplated that both the pin member 12 and the loop member 13 may be formed<br>
from a continuous metal strand using rolling or stamping techniques. Strands 10 of<br>
beads 11 which are formed utilizing the connector of the present invention may utilize<br>
the detachable connector disclosed in my co-pending U.S. Application No. 09/592,318,<br>
