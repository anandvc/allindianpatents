				<td>The present invention relates to a  process for<br>
maKing a polyolefin composition.   In one ———-	<br>
aspect, the invention relates to crosslinkable polyolefin compositions, particularly polyethylene compositions, that possess both good processability and fast cure rates.  In another aspect, the invention relates to crosslinkable, bi-disperse polyolefin compositions of the same family differing in number average molecular weight that are useful in a wide range of fabrication technologies, for example, wire and cable extrusion, rotomolding, profile extrusion, injection molding, extrusion blow molding, injection blow molding, thermoforming, top forming, press blowing, slot die extrusion, sheet die extrusion, blown film extrusion, and powder coating.  In yet another aspect, the invention relates to a process of enhancing the processability of a polyolefin composition while maintaining a relatively fast cure rate".  In still another aspect, the invention relates to various articles of manufacture, for example, wire and cable coatings, weather-stripping and seals, gaskets, articles made from foamed and/or sponge-like crosslinked polyolefin of either closed or open ceil structure and/or combinations thereof, hollow containers, hollow tanks, medical appliances, drapes and coverings, items of health and personal care, fibres, tapes, tubes, pipes and hoses, bellows, boots, gaiters, footwear, made from crosslinkable polyolefin compositions.<br>
Polyolefin compositions can  be processed into shaped articles using various techniques.  For many end uses the articles should be crosslinked.  Crosslinking usually takes place during or following the processing step.<br><br>
Generally, such poiyolefin compositions should process relatively easily and should crosslink or cure relatively fast.  The rate of cure,  that is, the time required co attain a desired or optimum state of cure, is generally considered to be dependent on a number of factors.<br>
It is generally accepted that the higher the temperature of curing or the greater the molecular weight, the higher the cure rate.<br>
Short cure times are desired as they enhance productivity and reduce "work-in-progress inventory".  On the other hand, less severe (for example, lower temperature) curing conditions are desirable in order, for example, to reduce energy consumption or to facilitate handling of fabricated and semi-finished parts.<br>
Another important aspect is the processability of the composition.  Various indices have been proposed as a measure of the processability of a polymeric composition. Among the best known are the Melt Index, also called I2 , as measured according to ASTM D-1238 (Condition 190/2.16, formerly Condition E].  Melt Index is a useful processability indicator when comparing polymers within the same family.  Generally the lower the value of the Kelt Index the harder the polymer is to process. Higher molecular weight polyolefins generally have a Melt Index which is lower, and, therefore, higher molecular weight polyolefins are more difficult to process.  For example, during injection molding, low values of Melt Index result in higher pressure requirements in order to fill mold cavities, and in the case of excessively low values of Melt Index, it may be impossible to completely fill the mold cavity, in addition to consuming unnecessary amounts of energy to make the polymer flow.<br><br>
Another measure of processability is the shear rate [or the shear stress) at which the polyolefin composition shows melt fracture during processing.  It is preferable for the shear rate (or shear stress) at which the onset of melt fracture occurs to be as high as possible so as to allow high rates of fabrication of finished and semi-finished articles.  It is generally considered that, for a given molecular weight distribution, the shear rate corresponding to the onset of surface melt fracture is reduced as the average molecular weight of a polyolefin composition is increased.<br>
John Dealy in "Melt Rheology and Its Role in Plastics Processing", published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. in 1990, discloses on page 597 that the measurement of Melt Index according to ASTM D-1238, employing different loads will give an estimate of the shear rate dependence of melt viscosity, which is sensitive to the weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the number average molecular weight (Mn).  Most commonly, the ratio of the<br>
Melt Index at 190°C measured under 10 kg to that measured under 2.16 kg is used as a measure of sensitivity to shear thinning. This ratio is commonly referred to as ll0 / I2.<br>
Stehling et al., teach in U.S. Patents 5,387,630 and 5,382,631 (corresponding to WO 90/03414) that specific blends of narrow molecular weight distribution linear low density polyethylenes, essentially characterized by a polydispersity index (Mw/Mn) of the blend exceeding a value of three, provided that the value of M^/Mn for each of the blend components is less than three, offer enhanced tear resistance and reduced "extractability" compared with prior art compositions.  This publication does not teach cross!inking these compositions.<br><br>
A polyolefin composition chat possesses both high cure rate and excellent processability has been identified by the industry as a desirable product and, in the race of the contradictory requirements of low molecular weight (to enhance processability) and high molecular weight (to enhance the cure rate), much effort has been expended by those skilled in the art to attempt to find a balance between the two opposing requirements, or to optimize processing machinery and operating conditions so as to minimize the disadvantages, or to attempt to discover alternative methods of overcoming the problem.<br>
Processors of crosslinkable polyolefin compositions expend great efforts, for example, in choosing precise dimensions of tooling so as to minimize the severity of pressure drops as polymer is forced to flow through the shaping dies, thereby allowing for the use of higher molecular weight polyolefins and providing for the benefits of shorter cure times as a result. However, the optimum shaping tool and die design for one polyolefin composition is not necessarily advantageous for another polyolefin composition, and it therefore becomes necessary to change the flow path and shaping die design with each change of production, and in any case the benefits to be obtained are small if the initial design conforms to good industrial practice.<br>
Various forms of "processing aid" have been proposed.  Among such processing aids include for example, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, magnesium stearate, mineral oils of various viscosity (typically from 50 to 150 centistokes), microcrystalline paraffin wax, and polyethylene glycols either alone or in combination. Varrall et al., in MO 91/08262 teach the addition of up to 10 percent polyethylene wax to LLDPE for the purpose of<br><br>
improving the processabiiity of silane crosslinkable LLDPE intended for the manufacture of wire and cable insulation and coverings.  Generally the intention is to reduce the friction between the polymeric melt and the internal surfaces of the shaping die and associated flow passages. "Typically the additive migrates at least partially from the molten polymer composition to the interface with the die, thereby lubricating the said interface.  It is in the nature of such lubricants that they are eroded away from the polymer/metal interface in the course of their use, and thus they must be regularly replenished by a continual addition of the active process aid additive.  This adds considerably to the cost of the processing operation. Since the eroded process aid not uncommonly remains included in the mass or attached to the surface of the processed polymer, this causes a lack of purity which poses potential problems in the use and longevity of the fabricated article, such as inferior sealing properties, greater difficulty to print on the surface, poorer and electrical properties.<br>
A method to improve the processability of narrow molecular weight distribution polyethylenes such as LLDPE is suggested by Varrall et al., in WO 91/08262.  Varrall et al., suggest using blends of LDPE with LLDPE for silane crosslinkable polyethylene compositions intended for wire and cable insulation and covering, in order to improve the extrudability of LLDPE compositions.<br>
An alternative approach has been to employ mixtures of polyethylene of high molecular weight with polyethylene of low molecular weight.  For example, Varrall et al., mention in WO 91/08262 that a blend of a first LLDPE having a Melt Index from 0.2 to 10 and a second LLDPE having a Melt Index 20 to 50, most preferably in the proportions of 30 to 70 percent of the first<br><br>
component to 7u to 30 percent of the second component will provide a good balance of cure speed and processability for silane crosslinking systems for the manufacture of wire ana cable coatings and insulation.  However, they fail to give ar. example of such a composition.<br>
Yet another example of an attempt to define optimum blend proportions and composition is provided by Wong et al. in EP 584927 in which they teach that addition of a small quantity of an "auxiliary" polymer component which is co-crystallizabie with a "main" polymer component which is derived from ethylene and optionally at least one higher alpha-olefin, will reduce the time necessary to attain optimum cure without significantly worsening the processability.  However, they also teach that it is preferable to add a polymeric processing aid in the form of a fluorinated polymer and/or a polymer derived from ethylene and optionally at least one olefinically unsaturated co-monomer having a Melt Index at least 5 grams/10 minutes greater than that of the "main" component.<br>
Despite the previous attempts, there is a desire to provide crosslinkable polyethylene compositions which have both good processability and good cure rate.<br>
The present invention provides compositions having an improved combination of processability and enhanced curing rate.  The polyolefin compositions of the invention comprise at least one olefin polymer, preferably ethylene polymer, said composition satisfying the following conditions:<br>
^1^2 &gt; 1<br>
Mn2 &gt; 3000 and<br><br><br>
using a nonlinear regression technique to obtain values<br>

wherein<br>

RR[i] = Normalized Height [i]/flog (MW[i-1]) - log (MW[i])) in which the Normalised Height [i] is the GPC output for<br>
the corresponding MW(i);<br>
2 ui and G±        represent the mean and standard<br>
deviation of the first log normal distribution;   U2 and<br>

Mni = 10 Wl exp (-0.5 (ln(10) x ai)2) and Mn2 = 10 U2 exP (-0.5 (ln(10) x (72)21■<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for making a polyolefm composition comprising: (a) preparing a first olefin polymer and a second olefin polymer; (b) blending the first and second olefin polymers such that the first and second olefin polymers are homogeneously mixed to provide a polyolefin composition<br><br>
MW is the GPC molecular weight value,<br>
RR is the relative response which for an individual RR/MW data set is<br>

Mn2 = lC2 exp (-0.5 (ln(10) x o2)2), said composition having an overall density of less than 0.907 g/cm3.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention is an article comprising a crosslinked polyolefin composition obtainable by curing a crosslinkable oolyolefin composition of the present invention.<br>
A further aspect of the invention is a process for crosslinking said crosslinkable composition.<br>

The bi-disperse nature of the molecular weight distribution is clearly evident.<br>

Figure 9 shows the influence of Mn on time to 175 percent hot set target cure for a series of silane crosslinkable polyethylene compositions when cured in water at 60aC as shown in Table VIII.  The datapoints representing the present invention are pointed out with arrows.<br>
Figure 10 graphically illustrates the distinction between the prior art compositions and the present invention based on the deconvolution parameters Mnl. Mn2, Ai, and A2 presented in Table IX.<br>
Where in the application the terms Mn and Mw or the terms overall Mn and overall Mw are used, these refer to the number average molecular weight and weight average molecular weight, respectively, of the overall polyolefin composition, as opposed to Mni and Mn2 which represent characteristics of the polyolefin composition obtained by the specified deconvolution method.<br>
According to the present invention it is surprisingly established that the inventive compositions<br><br>
exhibit an improved combination of processabiiicy and cure rate compared co prior art compositions of a similar overall number average molecular weight, Mn, and of a similar density.  The present inventors have found that such improved properties are related to specific molecular weight parameters as explained in more detail hereinafter.<br>
The parameters Ai, A2, Mni, and Mn2 used to describe the present polyolefin compositions are derived from GPC analysis of samples of these compositions.<br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2 are representative GPC curves of prior art polyolefin compositions.  Figure 3 and Figure 4 are representative GPC curves of polyolefin compositions according to the present invention.<br>
The samples are analyzed by gel permeation chromatography on a Waters 150°C high temperature chromatographic unit equipped with three pl-gel 10 urn mixed percent columns operating at a system temperature of 140°C.  The solvent is 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene from which 0.2 percent by weight solutions of the samples are prepared for injection.  The flow rate is 1.0 milliliters/minute and the injection size is 200 microliters.<br>
The molecular weight determination is deduced by using narrow molecular weight distribution polystyrene standards (from Polymer Laboratories) in conjunction with their elution volumes.  The equivalent polyethylene molecular weights are determined by using appropriate Mark-Houwink coefficients for polyethylene and polystyrene (as described by Williams and Ward in Journal of Polymer Science, Polymer Letters, Vol. 6, (621) 1968} to derive the following equation:<br>
^polyethylene = a * (^polystyrene" ■<br><br>
In this equation, a = 0.4316 and b = 1.0. Weight average molecular weight, Mw, is calculated in the<br>
usual manner according to the following formula:  Mw = £ wi* Mi, where wx and Mi are the weight fraction and<br>
molecular weight, respectively, of the i   fraction eiuting from the GPC column.<br>
By subjecting the GPC curves to deconvolution by non-linear regression based on the dual log-normal distribution function set forth above, the values of Ai,<br>
A2# ai, 02,   HI and u2 can be calculated for each gel<br>
permeation chromatogram.  The values of  m and ai,<br>
respectively u2 and 02 are used to calculate the values of<br>
Mni and Mn2■<br>
The above deconvolution method provides two log-normal distributions, each of which is characterized by the values of Mni, o"i, and uj_.  The benefits of the present invention were found to occur when Mni and Mn2 satisfied the relationship specified above.  Mni can be considered to represent the number average molecular weight of the log normal distribution corresponding to the higher molecular weight fractions, as obtained by the specified deconvolution method.  Analogously, Mn2 can be considered to represent the number average molecular weight of the log normal distribution corresponding to the lower molecular weight fractions, as calculated by the specified method.<br>
The greater the Mnl to Mn2 ratio, the greater the processability of the poLyolefin composition. However, to maintain the desired cure rate of the composition the value of Mni / Mn2  must be greater than<br>
1 .<br><br>
5, preferably greater than 6.5 and more preferably greater than 7.0.  If the ratio of Mnl / Mn2 is less than 5, the benefit of the improvement in cure rate will not be obtained.<br>
According to the present invention, it is preferred that the composition comprises a blend of components chosen from the families of a homogeneous linear PE, or from the family of substantially linear ethylene polymers.  Most preferred are compositions obtained from two SLEPs.<br>
The value Mn2 is greater than 3,000 and is preferably greater than 4,000.<br>
Furthermore the ratio Ai / (Ai + A2), which can be regarded as the relative contribution of the first log normal distribution (which is characterized by pi and <j></j>
to the weighted sum of the first and second log normal distributions obtained by applying the dual log normal deconvolution function described above to the gel permeation chromatagram of the composition, must fall within certain limits.  The ratio of Ai to (Ai +■ Ag) must be greater than or equal to 0.15, and preferably greater than or equal to 0.2 and more preferably greater than or equal to 0.25.  Also the ratio of Ai r_o (Ai + A2) must be less than or equal to 0.7, preferably less than or equal to 0.55, and more preferably less than or equal to 0.6. If the ratio of Ai to (A1+A2) is not in the range from 0.7 to 0.15, the rate of cure will be lower than desirable, and also the shear thinning effect associated with bi-modal molecular weight distribution polymers will be diminished, resulting in a worsening of processability.<br>
The values for A\, A2, Mni, and Mn2 result from the application of non-linear least squares analysis of a series of data points generated by GPC expressed in the<br><br>
form   of   log MW versus   relative   response.      The   actual<br>
incremental   relative   response,    {Relative	Response   [i]}(<br>
corresponding   to   a  particular   log  MW[i],	is   expressed by<br>
the   formula:<br>
Normalized  Height   [i] Relative   Respor.se   (ij    =<br>
log   (1-M   U-1J1    -   iog    U-M   li])<br>
where the Normalized Height (i) and MW [i-1] and MW [i] are obtained from the GPC data.<br>
For i equal co 1, the relative response is zero. The sum of all the Normalized Heights [i] equals 1.<br>
The numerical method used for curve fitting is the method of Choleski decomposition with numerically determined first derivatives with errors in all variables as taught in Technical University of Eindhoven (The Netherlands) PP-5.3, Non-linear Regression Without Limits, 1989 TUE-RC 68438 and in "An Introduction to Numerical Analysis" by K.E. Atkinson, published by John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. in 197 8 .  This numerical analysis can be carried out using commercially available software, such as RRGraph™ from Reactor Research Foundation, which is registered at the Chamber of Commerce of Delft, The Netherlands, under registration no. S1459S0 .  Such non¬linear least squares analysis applies the dual log normal distribution function to the series of datapoints represented by log (MW [i]) versus Relative Response [i]<br>
to determine the values of Ai, A2, (Ti, CJ2, m and u2 which provide the best fit to the log (MW [i]) versus Relative Response [i] datapoints.  Initial starting values for the<br>
parameters Ai, A2 (equals 1 - Ai) , ui, U2 &gt;   °"1 and 0"2 are based on knowledge of the composition and/or shape of the GPC curve.  Starting values which have proven to give successful deconvoiutions are as follows:  Ai - 0.4 to<br><br>
0.6; m of about. 5,- u2 of   about 4; a\   and Q2  each of about 0.35.  if the deconvolution is not successful, the starting values may be adjusted in view of the shape of the GPC curve.<br>
The values Ai, A2, Mni and Mn2 calculated as explained above are obtained from the composition and may not coincide, in the case of an actual blend, with the respective actual blend ratios and number average molecular weights of the blend components.  Thus, the ratio of Ai to (A1+A2) does not necessarily correspond to che actual blend ratios in the case that the composition is made by blending of two or more polymer components. Nor do the values of Mnl or Mn2 necessarily correspond to the actual values of Mn which would have been obtained by gel permeation chromatography of the separate blend components prior to blending.  The present compositions may comprise more than two olefin polymer components especially when prepared via blending, provided the overall composition satisfies the conditions specified above.<br>
The poiyolefin compositions of this invention generally may be obtained by blending two or more polyolefins preferably selected from the same family.  As such, poiyolefin compositions of this invention include blends of two or more linear PEs, or blends of two or more LDPEs, or of two or more SLEPs, but not blends of linear PE and LDPE.<br>
Low density polyethylene ("LDPE") is generally prepared at high pressure using free radical initiators and typically has a density in the range of 915 to 940<br>
kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m }.  LDPE is also known as "branched" polyethylene because of the relatively large number of long-chain branches extending from the main<br><br>
polymer backbone.  LDPE comprises ethylene and may comprise, optionally, small quantities (for example, up to about 5 weight percent) of comonomers such as propylene, butene-1, vinyl acetate, and butyl aerylate.<br>
Ethylene polymers and copolymers prepared by the use of a coordination catalyst, such as a Ziegler or Phillips catalyst, are generally known as linear polyethylene ("linear PE") because of the substantial absence of branch-chains of polymerized monomer units pendant from the backbone.  Linear PE includes HDPE and LLDPE, which latter term for the present purposes includes ULDPE and VLDPE.  High density polyethylene ("HDPE"),<br>
generally having a density of 941 to 967 kg/m , is typically a linear homopolymer of ethylene or an interpolymer of ethylene and a small quantity of Ot-olefin, and it contains relatively few branch chains relative to the various linear interpolymers of ethylene and an cc-olef in.  As used herein, "interpolymer" means a polymer of two or more comonomers, for example, a copolymer, or terpolymer.<br>
Linear low density polyethylene ("LLDPE") is<br>
typically an interpolymer of ethylene and an ot-olefin of 3 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 4 to 8 carbon atoms (for example, 1-buter.e, or 1-octene), that has sufficient ot-olefin content to reduce the density of the interpolymer to that of LDPE.  LLDPE is a member of the family of linear ?E" s .  When the interpolymer contains even more ot-olefin, the density will drop below about 910 kg/ra and these interpolymers are known as ultra low density oolyethylene ("ULDPE") or very low density polyethylene ("VLDPE").  The densities of these linear polymers<br>
4<br><br>
generally range from 865 to 910 kg/m".  VLDPE and ULDPE are boch members of the family of linear PE"s.<br>
Linear ethylene interpolymers comprise homogeneously-branched and heterogeneously-branched LLDPE"s.  Heterogeneous LLDPEs generally have a very broad, non-uniform distribution of comonomer content, that is, some polymer molecules have a relatively high ra-olefin comonomer content while others have a relatively low content.  Generally, the polymer molecules of low comonomer content are relatively more crystalline and have a high melting temperature, whereas the high comonomer content polymer molecules are more amorphous and melt at a lower temperature.<br>
Homogeneously-branched linear polyethylenes that can be used in the practice of this invention (also called "homogeneous linear polyethylene" or "homogeneous linear PE" or "homogeneous LLDPE") are known, and their method of preparation is described in U.S. Patent 3,645,992. Examples of homogeneous LLDPE"s are Tafmer™ polymers (trademark of Mitsui), and Exact™ polymers (trademark of Exxon).<br>
A different family of olefin polymers is that of the substantially linear olefin polymers.  The substantially linear olefin polymers, and more in particular substantially linear ethylene polymers {SLEP"s), and their method of preparation are described in U.S. Patents  5,272,236, 5,278,272 and 5,380,810.  SLEP"s are available from DuPont Dow Elastomers L.L.C. as Engage® polyolefin elastomers, and from The Dow Chemical Company as Affinity® polyolefin plastomers.<br>
As used herein, "substantially linear" means that the bulk polymer has an average of 0.01 long-chain branches/1000 carbons to 3 long-chain branches/1000 carbons, preferaoly from 0.01 long-chain branches/1000<br><br>
carbons to 1 long-chain branch/1000 carbons, and more preferably from 0.05 long-chain branches/1000 carbons to I long-chain branch/1000 carbons.  In contrast, simply "linear" means that the polymer backbone is substituted with less than 0.01 long chain branches/1000 carbons.<br>
The term "bulk polymer" as used herein, means the polymer which results from the polymerization process and, for the substantially linear polymers, includes molecules without long-chain branching, as well as molecules with long-chain branching.  Thus a "bulk polymer" includes all molecules formed during polymerization.  It is understood that, for the substantially linear polymers, not all molecules have long-chain branching, but a sufficient amount do, such that the average long-chain branching content of the bulk polymer positively affects the melt rheology {that is, the melt fracture properties).<br>
Long-chain branching (LCB) is defined herein as a chain length of at least 1 carbon less than the number of carbons in the comonomer, whereas short-chain branching (SCB) is defined herein as a chain length of the same number of carbons in the residue of the comonomer after it is incorporated into the polymer molecule backbone.  For example, an ethylene/1-octene substantially linear polymer has backbones with long-chain branches of at least V carbons in length, but it also has short-chain branches of only 6 carbons in length.<br>
Long-chain branching can be distinguished from<br>
short-chain branching by using   C nuclear magnetic resonance (MMR) spectroscopy and to a limited extent, for example, for ethylene homopolymers, it can be quantified using the method of Randall (Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys. , C29 (2&amp;3), p.285-297).  However as a practical matter,<br>
4<br><br>
current ~   C KMR spectroscopy cannot determine che length of a long-chain branch in excess of about 6 carbon atoms and as such, this analytical technique cannot distinguish between a 7-carbon branch and a 70-carbon branch.  The long-chain branch can be as long, or about the same length as, the length of the polymer back-bone.<br>
U.S. Patent 4,500,648, teaches that long-chain branching frequency (LCB) can be represented by the equation LCB = b/Mw wherein b is the weight average number of long-chain branches per molecule, and Mw is the weight average molecular weight.  The molecular weight averages and the long-chain branches characteristics are determined by gel permeation chromatography and intrinsic viscosity methods.<br>
As used herein, "homogeneously-branched" means that the comonomer is randomly distributed within a given molecule and that substantially all of the copolymer molecules have the same ethylene/comonomer ratio.  The distribution or homogeneity of comonomer branches for the substantially linear ethylene interpolyrners and homopolymers is characterised by its SCBDI (Short-Chain Branch Distribution Index) or CDBI (Composition Distribution Branch Index), and it is defined as the weight percent of the polymer molecules having a comonomer content within 50 percent of the median total molar comonomer content.  The CDBI of a polymer is readily calculated from data obtained from techniques known in the art, such as, for example, temperature rising elution fractionation {abbreviated herein as "TREF") as described, for example, by Wild et al., Journal of Polymer Science, Poly. Phys. Ed., Vol. 20, p. 441 (1982), or in U.S. Patent 4,798,081.  The SCBDI or CDBI for the substantially linear homogeneously-branched interpolyrners in the preferred polymer compositions according to the present invention is<br><br>
generally greater than 3 0 percent, preferably greater than 50 percent, and especially greater than 80 percent.<br>
Both the linear homogeneously-branched polymers and the SLEPs used in this invention have a single melting peak, as measured using differential scanning caiorimetry (DSC), in contrast to heterogeneously branched linear ethylene polymers, which have two or more melting peaks due to their broad branching distribution.<br>
The unique characteristic of the SLEPs is a highly unexpected flow property where the IIQ/I2 value of the polymer is essentially independent of the polydispersity index (that is, Mw/Mn&gt; of the polymer. This is contrasted with conventional linear homogeneously branched and linear heterogeneously branched polyethylene resins having rheological properties such that to increase the Iio/l2 value the polydispersity index must also be increased.  Preferably, the melt flow ratio, measured as 110/12 fASTM D-1238), is greater than or equal to 5.63, and is preferably at least 6.5, more preferably at least 7 and may be as high as 20, preferably up to 15, and more preferably up to 10.<br>
These unique SLEPs are prepared by using constrained geometry catalysts (CGC), and are characterized by a narrow molecular weight distribution, and if an interpolymer, by a narrow or homogeneous comonomer distribution.  The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn), measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), is preferably defined by the equation:<br>
Mw / Mn 1 (110 / 12) ~ 4.63,<br>
and is generally less than 5, preferably between 1.5 and 2.5, and especially from 1.7 to 2.3.<br>
The preferred melt index, measured as I2 (ASTM<br>
D-1238, condition 190/2.16 (formerly condition E)}, is<br><br>
from 0.1 g/10 minutes to 100 g/10 minutes, more preferably 1 to 20 g/10 minutes.  Typically, the preferred substantially linear ethylene polymers used in the practice of this invention are homogeneously branched and do not have any measurable high density fraction, [that is, as measured by Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation), for example, they do not contain any polymer fraction that has a degree of branching less than or equal to 2 methyl/1000 carbons.<br>
Other basic characteristics of these substantially linear ethylene polymers include a low residuals content (that is, low concentrations in the substantially linear ethylene polymer of the catalyst used to prepare the polymer, unreacted comonomers, if any, and low molecular weight oligomers made during the course of the polymerization), and a controlled molecular architecture which provides good processability even though the molecular weight distribution may be narrow relative to conventional olefin polymers.<br>
The substantially linear olefin polymers used to make the polymer compositions of this invention preferably include substantially linear ethylene polymers, both homo-and interpolymers.  The substantially linear ethylene polymers preferably comprise between 95 and 50 weight percent ethylene, and 5 and 5 0 weight percent of at least<br>
one a-olefin comonomer, more preferably 10 to 25 weight percent of at least one a-olefin comonomer.  Percent comonomer is measured by infrared spectroscopy according to A.STM D-2238 Method B.  Typically, these substantially linear ethylene polymers, as well as the homogeneous linear polyethylenes, are copolymers of ethylene and an a-olefin comonomer of 3 to 2 0 carbon atoms (for example, propylene, 1-butene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-l-pentene, 1-leptene, 1-octene and styrene) with a density of 850 to<br><br>
967 kg/"m^ , preferably of S65 no 960 kg/m"" .  Preferably, the comonomer is an a-olefin of 4 to 10 carbon atoms, more preferably of from 5 to 10 carbon atoms.  Especially preferred are 4-methyl-pentene-1, 1-hexene and i-octene.<br>
For the substantially linear ethylene polymers, the IIQ/12 ratios indicate the degree of long-chain branching, that is, the greater I10/I2 ratio, the more long-chain branching in the polymer.<br>
The "rheological processing index" (PI) is the apparent viscosity (in kpoise) of a polymer measured by a gas extrusion rheometer (GER).  The gas extrusion rheometer is described by M. Shida, R.N. Shroff and L.V. Cancio in Polymer Engineering Science, Vol. 17, No. 11, p. 770 (1977), and in "Rheometers for Molten Plastics" by John Dealy, published by Van Nostrand Reinhold Co. (1982) on pp. 97 to 99.  GER experiments are performed at a temperature of 190°C, at nitrogen pressures between 250 to 5500 psig using about a 7.54 cm diameter, 20:1 L/D die with an entrance angle of 180°.  For the preferred substantially linear ethylene polymers described herein for the polymer compositions of the present invention, the PI is the apparent viscosity (in kpoise) of a material<br>
measured by GER at an apparent shear stress of 2.15 x 10<br>
2 dyne/cm .  These substantially linear ethylene<br>
interpolymers and homopolymers preferably have a PI in the<br>
range of 0.Q1 kpoise to 50 kpoise, preferably 15 kpoise or<br>
less, which is less than or equal to 70 percent of the PI<br>
of a comparative linear ethylene polyner (either a Ziegler<br>
polymerized polymer or a linear uniformly branched polymer<br>
as described by Elston in U.S. Patent 3,645,992) at about<br>
the same I2 and Mw/Mn.<br>
An apparent shear stress versus apparent shear<br>
rate plot is used to identify the melt fracture phenomena<br><br>
According to Ramamurthy in the Journal of Rheology, 30(2), 337-357, 1986, above a certain critical flow rate, the observed extrudate irregularities may be broadly classified into two main types: surface melt fracture and i  gross melt fracture.<br>
Surface melt fracture occurs under apparently steady flow conditions and ranges in detail from loss of specular film gloss to the more severe form of "sharkskin." In this disclosure, the onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) is characterized by the visual appearance of the surface roughness of an extrudate from a capillary rheometer.  The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture for the preferred substantially linear ethylene interpolymers and homopolymers for use in this invention is at least 50 percent greater than the critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture of a comparative linear ethylene polymer having about the same 12 and Mw/Mn-<br>
Gross melt fracture occurs at unsteady extrusion flow conditions and ranges in detail from regular (for example, alternating rough and smooth, or helical) to random distortions.  For commercial acceptability, (for example, in blown films and bags therefrom), surface defects should be minimal, if not absent, for good film quality and properties.  The critical shear stress at the onset of gross me.it fracture for the substantially linear ethylene interpolymers and homopolymers used for making the preferred polymer compositions of the present<br>
invention is greater than about 4 x 10  dynes/cm".  The critical shear rate at the onset of surface melt fracture (OSMF) and the onset of gross melt fracture (OGMF) will be used herein based on the changes of surface roughness and configurations of the extrudates extruded by a GER.<br><br>
The rheological behavior of substantially linear ethylene polymers can also be characterized by the Dow Rheology Index ("DRI"), which expresses the "normalized relaxation time as the result of long chain branching" of a polymer.  (See, S. Lai and G.W. Knight ANTEC "93 Proceedings: "INSITE Technology Polyolefins (ITP) - New Rules in the Structure/Rheology Relationship of Ethylene a-Olefin Copolymers", New Orleans, La., May 1993).  DRI values range from 0 for polymers which do not have measurable long-chain branching (for example, TafmerTH products available from Mitsui Petrochemical Industries and Exact™ products available from Exxon Chemical Company) to 15 and is independent of melt index.  In general, for low to medium pressure ethylene polymers (particularly at lower densities) DRI provides improved correlations to melt elasticity and high shear flowability relative to correlations of the same attempted with melt flow ratios. For the substantially linear ethylene polymers useful in this invention, DRI is preferably at least 0.1, and more preferably at least 0.5, and most preferably at least 0.8. DRI can be calculated from Equation 1:<br>
Equation 1 :-       DRI = (3652879 X,1-^^/T\,-l)    /   10<br>
in which T0 is the characteristic relaxation time of the material and T)0 is the zero shear viscosity of the material.  Both T0 and Ti0 are the "best fit" values<br>
determined by a non-linear  regression of the experimental data to the cross equation {see Equation 2), that is,<br>
Equation 2 :- iyr|0 = 1/(1+(Y x t0)r")<br>
where n is the power law index of the material, and r\   and y  are the measured viscosity and shear rate (rad<br><br>
sec  }, respectively.  Baseline determination of viscosity and shear rate data are obtained using a Rheometrics Mechanical Spectrometer (RMS-8 00) under dynamic sweep mode from 0.1 to 100 radians/second at 190°C and a Gas Extrusion Rheometer (GER) at extrusion pressures from 1,000 psi to 5,000 psi (6.89 to 34.5 MPa), which corresponds to shear stress from 0.086 to 0.43 MPa, using a 0.754 mm diameter, 20:1 L/D die at 190°C.  Specific material determinations can be performed from 14 0°C to 190°C as required to accommodate melt index variations.<br>
The blends can be prepared through the physical admixture of two or more like polyolefins, or through in-reactor blending.  Preparing the present compositions by physical admixture includes dry blending, melt blending and solution blending, that is, dissolving one or both of the components in a suitable solvent, such as, for example, a hydrocarbon, and combining the components followed by removing the solvent or solvents.  In-reactor blending typically involves blending the components in a polymerization reactor, during or after the preparation of one or both of the components.  Both types of blending, that is, physical and in-reactor blending, are well known. Preferably, the present compositions are prepared by in-reactor blending using two reactors operated in series or in parallel, or using two or more catalysts in a single reactor or combinations of multiple catalysts and multiple reactors.  The general principle of making polymer blends by in-reactor blending using two or more catalysts in a single reactor or combinations of multiple catalysts and multiple reactors is described in WO 93/13143, EP-A-619827, and U.S. Patent 3,914,342.  The present polyolefin compositions can be prepared by selecting appropriate<br><br>
catalyse and process conditions with a view to the final composition characteristics .<br>
The polyolefin composition of this invention may be crosslinked or cured according to any method known to crosslink saturated polyolefin compositions.  Suitable techniques for introducing crosslinks between different molecular chains of an essentially saturated polymer such as polyethylene, include a number of mechanisms such as, by the reaction with the polyethylene of a peroxide or other free radical generator, and optionally a suitable coagent and/or catalyst and/or activator mixed and/or accelerator and/or promoter such as triallyl cyanurate or elemental sulphur.  The reaction is usually initiated by heating the shaped article.<br>
Generally, the desired Melt Index will depend on the intended end use of the article fabricated from the composition and the method of manufacturing the article from the crosslinkable composition and may be from 0.01 to 100 grains/10 minutes.  For example, a value of Melt Index of between 0.2 to 5 grams/10 minutes is preferred for articles to be fabricated by extrusion processes such as the blown film technique.  Generally, a lower value of Melt Index will oe associated with articles requiring higher abuse resistance or those subject to environmental stress crack resistance demands.  Articles to be fabricated by injection molding will typically be fabricated from inventive compositions of Melt Index 4 to 100 grams/10 minutes and most preferably about 5 to 25 grams/10 minutes.  Those skilled in the art will apply the usual rules to determine the most appropriate value of desirable Melt Index for the intended use of the composition.<br>
The compositions of the present invention preferably have an overall density of at least 0.850<br><br>
g/cm , preferably at least 0.855 g/cnT, more preferably at<br>
least 0.860 g/cm .  The overall densities are generally<br>
less than 0.907 g/cm , preferably less than 0.900 g/cm3,<br>
more preferably less than 0.890 g/cm", most preferably<br>
■  less than 0.885 g/cm .  Compositions having densities of<br>
less than 0.900 g/cm  are very suitable for use as coating or insulation for wires and cables, especially for flexible coatings and insulations.<br>
Scott teaches in British Patent 1,286,460 (corresponding to U.S. Patent 3,646,155) that chemically reactive compounds may be grafted to che polymer backbone in such a way that subsequent reactions may take place between the thus grafted compounds attached to different polymeric molecular chains so as to result in crosslinks being formed between the said polymeric molecular chains. Exemplary of such a method is the so-called "silane crosslinking process" wherein unsaturated silanes are grafted onto a polymer, which grafted silanes can subsequently react with moisture in the presence of a catalyst to form crosslinks between polymer chains. Unsaturated silanes suitable for grafting on to a base polymer include silanes of the general formula:<br><br>
wherein: R" represents a hydrogen atom or methyl group; x and y are 0 or 1 with the proviso that when x is 1, y equals 1; n is an integer from 1 to 12 inclusive, preferably 1 to 4; and each R independently represents a hydrolyzable organic group such as an alkoxy group having from 1 to 12 carbon atoms (for example, methoxy, ethoxy, or butoxy), aryloxy group (for example, phenoxy), araloxy (for example, benzyloxy), aliphatic acyloxy group having<br><br>
from 1 to 12 carbon atoms (for example, formyloxy, acetyioxy, or propanoyloxy), oximo or substituted amino groups (alkylamino or arylamino), or a lower alkyl group having 1 to 6 carbon atoms inclusive, with the proviso that not more than one of the three R groups is an alkyl. Such silanes may be grafted to the polyolefin compositions either before or during a shaping or molding operation. The silane may be grafted to the polymer by any conventional method, typically in the presence of a free radical initiator for example, an organic initiator or ionizing radiation.  Organic initiators are preferred, such as organic peroxides, for example, dicumyl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoate, benzoyl peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, t-butyl peroctoate, or methyl ethyl ketone peroxide.  The amount of initiator can vary, but it is typically present in an amount of at least 0.04 parts per hundred based on the polyolefin composition (phr), preferably at least 0.06 phr.  Typically the amount of initiator does not exceed 0.15 phr and preferably it does not exceed about 0.10 phr.  The ratio of silane to initiator can also vary widely, but the typical silane:initiator ratio is between 10:1 to 30:1, preferably between 18:1 and 24:1.<br>
Crosslinking of the silane-grafted composition is effected by contacting the silane grafted composition with water or another hydrogen active compound.  The said water or compound is allowed to permeate into the polymer from the atmosphere or from a water bath or "sauna"/ or by the incorporation of a substance into the polymer which is able to release water under appropriate conditions, for example, the heating of a polymer containing a hydrated filler such as aluminum trihydroxide.  The crosslinKing reaction usually requires a crosslinking catalyst, which may include a crosslinking agent, activator, promoter,<br><br>
and/or accelerator, and combinations thereof.  These catalysts generally include organic bases, carboxylic acids, and organometallic compounds including organic titanates and complexes or carboxylates of lead, cobalt, iron, nickel, zinc and tin; dibutyltin dilaurate, dioctyltin maleate, dibutyltin diacetate, dibutyltin dioctoate, stannous acetate, stannous octoate, lead naphthenate, zinc caprylate, and cobalt naphthenate.  Tin carboxylate, especially dibutyltin dilaurate and dioctyitin maleate, are particularly effective for this invention.  The catalyst (or mixture of  catalysts) is present in a catalytic amount, typically from about 0.01 to l.Q, preferably from 0.015 to 0.10 parts by weight per 100 parts by weight resin, that is, parts per hundred resin.<br>
Yet other methods of crosslinking the present polyolefin compositions may be used.  For example, use may be made of a combination of an electron beam and a crosslinking activator or multifunctional monomer such as ethylene glycol dimethacrylate, tetraethylene glycol dimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane trimethacrylate, trimethylolpropane triacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, diallyl phthalate, triallyl cyanurate, or pentaerythritol r.ecraacrylate, in order to successfully crosslink the products of this invention.  "Radiation Processing of Polymers" published by Hanser Publishers of Munich, Vienna, New York and Barcelona and edited by A. Singh and J. Silverman provides further details of radiation crosslinking technology.<br>
The above-mentioned methods of achieving crosslinking in polyethylene should be considered as illustrative and not limitative. The phase of the process during which crosslinks are created between different polymeric molecular chains is also commonly referred to as<br><br>
the "cure phase" and the process icseif is also commonly called "curing".<br>
The present olefin composition may contain further additives, such as for example, heat stabilizers, radiation stabilizers such as UV stabilizers, pigments, colorants, extenders, fillers or  processing aids.  These are advantageously incorporated prior to the crosslinking step.<br>
The compositions of this invention can be used in a wide variety of applications, and are particularly useful in those applications in which short cure times are either required or desired.  Illustrative applications include films, extrusion-coated and laminated foils, extruded and calendered sheet and foils, wire and cable coatings, weather-stripping and seals, gaskets, articles made from foamed and/or sponge-like crosslinked polyolefin of either closed or open cell structure and/or combinations thereof, hollow containers, hollow tanks, medical appliances, molded cups, drapes and coverings, items of health and personal care, fibers, tapes, tubes, pipes and hoses, bellows, boots, gaiters, footwear, shoe soles and uppers, made from crosslinkable polyolefin compositions.  The compositions of this invention may be converted into finished articles or component parts intended for incorporation into the fabrication of other articles by well-known polymer processing methods such as wire and cable extrusion, rotomolding, profile extrusion, injection molding, compression molding, transfer molding, overmolding extrusion, blow molding, inj ection blow molding, thermoforming, top forming, press blowing, slot die extrusion, sheet die extrusion, foam extrusion, blown film extrusion, moiiotape and monofilament extrusion, and powder coating.<br><br>
Examples<br>
The following examples are illustrative of certain specific embodiments of this invention.  Unless indicated to the contrary, all parts and percentages are by weight.<br>
A series of SLEPs were manufactured in a solution process miniplant having two reactors, referred to herein as the "primary reactor" and "secondary reactor," connected in series.  The primary reactor was used to continuously polymerize a feed mixture comprising an ethylene/1-octene/solvent mixture and hydrogen gas in the presence of a metallocene catalyst such as described in U.S. Patents 5,272,236, 5,278,272 and 5,380,810.  The partially reacted product of the primary reactor was fed continuously to the secondary reactor through the in-series connection between these reactors where that product was made to react with additional ethylene, again in the presence of the same metallocene catalyst, under reaction conditions which produced a polymer having a different Mn, generally a lower Mn, than the Mn of the polymer produced under the primary reactor conditions. Such conditions generally included operating the secondary reactor at a higher temperature than the primary reactor. Polymer blends corresponding to Examples 1 to 4 were made by manipulating the reaction parameters of the primary and secondary reactors.<br>
Example 1, for instance, is prepared by introducing into the primary reactor a mixture comprising ethylene (C2)/ 1-octene (Cs) and hydrogen gas (H2) at the following rates:<br><br><br>
3CMH = standard cubic meters per hour (that is, rate in cubic meters at standard temperature and pressure)<br>
The primary reactor was maintained at a temperature of 70°C and a product stream was transferred from the primary reactor to the secondary reactor at a rate of 23.6 kg/hr. along with 7.71 kg/hr ethylene, while<br>
maintaining the secondary reactor at a temperature of 12 0°C to produce a final product at a rate of 36.5 kg/hr.<br>

Additionally, Comparative Examples DR-A to DR-M were made by tumble mixing pairs of SLEPs and extruding the mixture.

The time to optimum cure for the peroxide crosslinkable formulations was determined at 160CC using a Zwick Oscillating Disk Rheometer 4308 (1° rotor angle and<br>
a frequency of 100 min  ).  The time to optimum cure, expressed as Tgo&gt; was calculated directly by the Zwick ODR software model 7049 3-2, version 06.07.89/07.07.89 according to the procedure described in DIN 53 52 9/T2. Table VI tabulates the dependency of time to optimum cure as determined by the oscillating disk rheometer using the method described above as a function of overall Mn  for a series  of  peroxide  crosslinkable  SLEP  compositions  as described in Recipe 1.   The samples are identified by reference to the raw polymer from which the crosslinkable compositions  were  made.    Figure  7  illustrates  this dependency and clearly shows the higher than expected cure speed of  the  inventive  compositions  relative  to  their overall number average molecular weights.   For example, Example  2  cures  in  46.2  minutes  at  160°C  versus  an expected time of approximately 54 minutes based on its number  average  molecular weight.  Similarly,  Example  3 cured in 47.3 minutes at the same temperature versus an expected cure time of more than 60 minutes, and Example 1 cured in 48 minutes versus an expected time of 5 6 minutes at 160°C.  The expected cure times were estimated based on an  extrapolation  of  the  data  for  the  prior  art compositions, that is, based on extrapolation of cure time versus overall Mn relations of prior art compositions.<br><br><br><br>
sample in a closed drum.  The contents were tumble-mixed for one hour and then fed to a single-screw 16 mm extruder of L/D = 28/1, which was equipped with a 2.5:1 compression ratio screw fitted with a "Cavity Transfer Mixer" feeding a strand die.  Said equipment had been manufactured by Extrusion Centre, Plasticisers Engineering Ltd.(UK).  it is also possible to meter the premixed<br>
silane/peroxide/catalyst mixture directly to the extruder hopper throat, although this method was not used for the purposes of the study.  Extruder rpms were such that the residence time was between 3 and 7 minutes and the resin melt temperature was around 220°C. Using this procedure, all resins were grafted to an equal extent.  The extruded strands were cut by an air knife using a blast of dry compressed air to avoid premature curing from contact with moisture.  Compression molded plaques of the extrudates were produced by taking the dry granules and placing them in a mold of nominal dimensions 160 mm x 160 mm x 2 mm thick at a temperature of 180°C, heating the mold to 190°C, pressurizing the mold to 15 bars for 6 minutes, then increased the pressure to 150 bars for 3 minutes and then allowing the temperature to decrease to 20°C at a cooling rate of 15°C/minute, using a hydraulic press, type Platen Presse 200 manufactured by Collins.  The molded plaques were then cured at 23°C in air containing 80 percent relative humidity or were cured by placing them in a thermostated water bath heated to 60°C.<br>
The rate of crosslinking was followed by periodically removing the plaque and taking a dog-bone shaped sample for hot-set analysis.  This analysis involved placing the dog-bone of ASTM dimensions in an oven at 200°C and attaching weights equivalent to a stress<br>
2<br>
of 20 N/cm  to the sample.  The resulting elongation of<br><br>
the sample is recorded.  As the state of cure of the sample increased, the measured elongation decreased.  The rate of the elongation decrease is therefore a measure of the rate of cure.  The method is described fully in Publication 811-2-1 of the International Electrotechnical Commision Standard published 1986.  This industry standard considers that a satisfactory state of cure has been achieved if the hot-set (elongation at specified temperature) of the sample does not exceed 17 5 percent<br>
_2 after 15 minutes under a load of 2 0 Ncm  .  In order to<br>
determine the cure time corresponding to this hot-set<br>
value of  175 percent after 15 minutes under a load of 20<br>
_2 Ncm   at 200°C, the hot-set is measured using a different<br>
dog-bone sample at each of a number of cure times and<br>
plotting the resulting hot-set versus time on log graph<br>
paper.  At very short cure times, the hot-set value may be<br>
very high and the sample may break before 15 minutes has<br>
elapsed.  In this case, the elongation under load was<br>
measured just before the sample broke.  A best line was<br>
drawn through the data points and the intersection with<br>
the 175 percent hot-set value giving the target cure time<br>
for the purposes of the evaluation.<br>
Table VII tabulates the dependency of time for<br>
target cure for a series of prior art LLDPE"s (including<br>
VLDPE"s and ULDPE"s), and comparative SLEP"s as a function<br>
of number average molecular weight when crosslinked in air<br>
containing 80 percent relative humidity at 23°C according<br>
to the procedure given above.  Figure 8 illustrates this<br>
dependency and clearly showed that the target cure time<br>
increased dramatically as Mn became less for both LLDPE<br>
and SLEP.  Similar curves may be obtained for other<br>
classes of polyolefin.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table VIII also tabulates the dependency of cure time for the inventive samples of this disclosure as a function of number average molecular weight, and hence processability, compared with the cure time of corresponding formulations of the prior art.  Figure 9 shows the inventive examples as boxes highlighted with arrows.  The scale of the "Time to Target Cure" axis is logarithmic so as to more clearly illustrate the surprising and significant improvement in cure rate performance which may be obtained without loss of processability by application of this invention.  For example, the inventive composition based on Example 1 cured in 2.79 hours versus 31.35 hours for the comparative example DR-B and 104.3 hours for the comparative example C-14, of similar number average molecular weights, Example 2 cured in water at 60°C in 3.67 hours versus a cure time of 9.82 hours under the same conditions for comparative composition DR-C of similar number average molecular weight.  Example 3 cured under the same conditions in 17.43 hours versus an expected cure time in excess of 1000 hours, and Example 4 cured in 31.16 hours versus an expected time again in excess of 1000 hours.<br>
Inventive composition Example 1, which cured in 2.79 hours may be compared with comparative compositions DR-F and DR-E which cured in 3.67 and 2.40 hours, respectively.  Example 1 had a polymer melt viscosity at<br>
1800 sec-1 at 220°C of 112 Pa«s versus 163 Pa-s for DR-F and 185 Pa»s for DR-E.  Likewise, the processability of inventive composition Example 4, which cured in 31.16 hours may be compared with the processability of comparative composition DR-B which also cured in 31.35<br>
hours.  The polymer melt viscosity at 1800 sec   at 220°C<br><br>
for Example 4 was 44 Pa»s versus 72 Pa»s for DR-B, and hence considerably better for the inventive composition.<br>
Table IX shows a summary of Mni/Mn2 and Ai/ (A1+A2) for the comparative and inventive compositions. Figure 11 depicts the same data graphically and illustrates the combinations of Mni/Mn2 and Ai/ (A1+A2) parameters which provide the benefits of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
