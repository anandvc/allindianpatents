Background of Invention<br>
Atherosclerosis    and other peripheral vascular diseases are the major causes effecting the quality of life of millions of people.  Therefore, considerable attention has been directed towards understanding the etiology of hypercholesterolemia and hyper-     lipidemia and development of effective therapeutic strategies.<br>
Hypercholesterolemia has been defined as plasma cholesterol level that exceeds arbitrarily defined value called "normal" level. Recently, it has been accepted that "ideal" plasma levels of cholesterol are much below the "normal" level of cholesterol in the general population and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) increases as cholesterol level rises above the "optimum" (or "ideal") value. There is clearly a definite cause and effect-relationship between hypercholesterolemia and CAD, particularly for individuals with multiple risk factors. Most of trie cholesterol is present in the esterified forms with various lipoproteins such as Low density lipo-protein (LDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), High density lipoprotein (HDL) and partially as Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Studies clearly indicate that there is an inverse correlationship between CAD and athero-sclerosis with serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations. ( Stampfer et al, N. Engl. J. Med., 325 (1991), 373-381) and the risk of CAD increases with increasing levels of LDL and VLDL.<br>
In CAD, generally "fatty streaks" in carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries, are found which are primarily free and esterified cholesterol. Miller et al, {Br. Med. J., 282 (1981), 1741 - 1744) have shown that increase in HDL-particles may decrease the number of sites of stenosis in coronary arteries of human, and high level of HDL-cholcstcrol may protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. Picardo et al, {Arteriosclerosis 6 (1986) 434 - 441) have shown by in vitro experiment that HDL is capable of removing cholesterol from cells.   They suggest that HDL may deplete tissues<br><br>
of excess free cholesterol and transfer them to liver (Macikinnon et ai, J. Biol, client. 261 (1986), 2548 - 2552). Therefore, agents that increase HDL cholesterol would have therapeutic significance for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart diseases (CHD).<br>
,	Obesity is a disease highly prevalent in affluent societies and in the developing<br>
world and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is a state of excess body fat accumulation. The causes of obesity are unclear. It is believed to be of genetic origin or promoted by an interaction between the genotype and environment. Irrespective of the cause, the result is fat deposition due to imbalance between the energy intake versus energy expenditure. Dieting, exercise and appetite suppression have been a part of obesity treatment. There is a need for efficient therapy to fight this disease since it may lead to coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia, gout, osteo-arthritis, reduced fertility and many other psychological and social problems.<br>
Diabetes and insulin resistance is yet another disease which severely effects the quality of a large population in the world. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably rises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia (J. Clin. Invest., (1985) 75 : 809 - 817; N. Engl. J. Med. (1987) 317: 350-357; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., (1988) 66 : 580 - 583; J. Clin. Invest., (1975) 68 : 957 -969) and other renal complications (See Patent Application No. WO 95/21608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulinemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the central pathogenic link-Syndrome-X.<br>
Hyperlipidemia is the primary cause for cardiovascular (CVD) and other peripheral vascular diseases. High risk of CVD is related to the higher LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein) seen in hyper-lipidemia. Patients having glucose intolerance/insulin resistance in addition to hyper-lipidemia have higher risk of CVD.  Numerous studies in the past have shown that lowering of plasma<br><br>
triglycerides and total cholesterol, in particular LDL and VLDL and increasing *HDL cholesterol help in preventing cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) are members of the nuclear receptor super family. The gamma (y) isoform of PPAR (PPARy) has been implicated in - regulating differentiation of adipocytes (Endo-crinology, (1994) 135: 798-800) and energy homeostasis (Cell, (1995) 83: 803-812), whereas the alpha (a) isoform of PPAR (PPARa) mediates fatty acid oxidation (Trend. Endocrin. Metab., (1993) 4: 291-296) thereby resulting in reduction of circulating free fatty acid in plasma (Current Biol. (1995) 5: 618 -621). PPARa agonists have been found useful for the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579). It has been recently disclosed that there exists synergism for the molecules, which are agonists for both PPARa and PPARy and suggested to be useful for the treatment of syndrome X (WO 97/25042). Similar synergism between the insulin sensitizer (PPARy agonist) and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor has been observed which »      may be useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma. (EP 0 753 298).<br>
It is known that PPARy plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation (Cell, (1996) 87, 377-389). Ligand activation of PPAR is sufficient to cause complete terminal differentiation (Cell, (1994) 79, 1147-1156) including cell cycle withdrawal. PPARy is consistently expressed in certain cells and activation of this nuclear receptor with PPARy agonists would stimulate the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors and cause morphological and molecular changes characteristics of a more differentiated, less malignant state (Molecular Cell, (1998), 465-470; Carcinogenesis, (1998), 1949-53; Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., (1997) 94, 237-241) and inhibition of expression of prostate cancer tissue (Cancer Research (1998) 58:3344-3352) This would be useful in the treatment of certain types of cancer, which express PPARy and could lead to a quite nontoxic chemotherapy.<br>
Leptin resistance is a condition wherein the target cells are unable to respond to leptin signal. This may give rise to obesity due to excess food intake and reduced energy expenditure and cause impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, cardio-vascular diseases and such other interrelated complications. Kallen et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (1996) 93, 5793-5796) have reported that insulin sensitizers which perhaps due to the PPAR agonist expression and therefore lower plasma leptin concentrations. However, it has been recently disclosed that compounds having insulin sensitizing property also<br><br>
possess leptin sensitization activity. They lower the circulating plasma leptin concentrations by improving the target cell response to leptin (WO/98/02159).<br>

The pharmaccutically acceptable salts arc prepared by reacting the compound of formula (I) with 1 to 4 equivalents of a base such as sodium hydroxide, sodium methoxide, sodium hydride, potassium t-butoxidc, calcium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide and the like, in solvents like ether, THF, methanol, t-butanol, dioxane, isopropanol, ethanol etc. Mixtures of solvents may be used. Organic bases like lysine, argininc, diethanolamine, choline, guanidine and their derivatives etc. may also be used. Alternatively, acid addition salts wherever applicable are prepared by treatment with acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid, methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, citric acid, maleic acid, salicylic acid, hydroxynaphthoic acid, ascorbic acid, palmitic acid, succinic acid, benzoic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, tartaric acid and the like in solvents like ethyl acetate, ether, alcohols, acetone, THF, dioxane etc. Mixtures of solvents may also be used.<br>
The stereoisomers of the compounds forming part of this invention may be prepared by using reactants in their single enantiomeric form in the process wherever possible or by conducting the reaction in the presence of reagents or catalysts in their single enantiomer form or by resolving the mixture of stereoisomers by conventional methods. Some of the preferred methods include use of microbial resolution, resolving the diastercomeric salts formed with chiral acids such as mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, and the like wherever applicable or chiral bases such as brucinc, cinchona alkaloids and their derivatives and the like. Commonly used methods are compiled by Jaques et al in "Enanfiomers, Racemates and Resolution" (Wiley Interscience, 1981). More specifically the compound of formula (I) where YR"" represents OF! may be converted to a l.i mixture of diastercomeric amides by treating with chiral amines, aminoacids, aminoalcohols derived from aminoacids; conventional reaction conditions may be employed to convert acid into an amide; the diastercomers may be separated either by fractional crystallization or chromatography and the slcrcoi.somcrs of compound of formula (I) may be prepared by hydrolyzing the pure diastercomeric amide.<br>
Various polymorphs of a compound of general formula (1) forming part of this invention may be prepared by crystallization of compound of fonnula (I) under different conditions. For example, using different solvents commonly used or their mixtures for rccrystalliz?. ion; crystallizations at different temperatures; various modes of cooling,<br><br>
ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallizations. Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound followed by gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid probe nmr spectroscopy, ir spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder X-ray diffraction or such other techniques.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) are useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of insulin resistance (type II diabetes), leptin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, disorders related to syndrome X such as hypertension, obesity, insulin resistance, coronary heart disease, and other cardiovascular disorders. These compounds may also be useful as aldose reductase inhibitors, for improving cognitive functions in dementia, treating diabetic complications, disorders related to endothelial cell activation, psoriasis, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), inflammatory bowel diseases, osteoporosis and for the treatment of cancer. The compounds of the present inventions are useful in the treatment and/or prophylaxis of arteriosclerosis and/or xanthoma in combination with one or more HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, hyupolipidcmic/ hypolipoproteinemic agents such as fibric acid derivatives, nicotinic acid, cholestyramine, colestipol or probucol. The compounds of the present invention in combination with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors and/or hypolipidcmic/liypolipoprotein agents can be administered together or within such a period to act synergistically. The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may be selected from those used for the treatment or prevention of hyperlipidemia such as lovastatin, provastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, ccrivastatin and their analogs thereof. Suitable fibric acid derivative may gemfibrozil, clofibrate, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate, benzafibrate and their anologs.<br>
The present invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions, containing the compounds of the general formula (I), as defined above, their tautomeric forms, their stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, or their pharmaceutically acceptable solvates in combination with the usual pharmaceutically employed carriers, diluents and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may be in the forms normally employed, such as tablets, capsules, powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like, may contain flavorants, sweeteners etc. in suitable solid or liquid carriers or diluents, or in suitable sterile media to form injectable solutions or suspensions. Such compositions typically contain from 1 to 20 %, preferably 1 to 10 % by weight of active compound, the<br><br>
remainder of the composition being pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, diluents or solvents.<br>
The compound of the formula (I) as defined above are clinically administered to mammals, including man, via either oral or parenteral routes. Administration by the oral" route is preferred, being more convenient and avoiding the possible pain and irritation of " injection. However, in circumstances where the patient cannot swallow the medication, or absorption following oral administration is impaired, as by disease or other abnormality, it is essential that the drug be administered parentcrally. By cither route, the dosage is in the range of about 0.01 to about 50 mg / kg body weight of the subject per day or preferably about 0.01 to about 30 mg / kg body weight per day administered singly or as a divided dose. However, the optimum dosage for the individual subject being treated will be determined by the person responsible for treatment, generally smaller doses being administered initially and thereafter increments made to determine the most suitable dosage.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable carriers include solid fillers or diluents and<br>
sterile aqueous or organic solutions.   The active compound will be present in such<br>
pharmaceutical compositions in the amounts sufficient to provide the desired dosage in<br>
the range as described above.   Thus, for oral administration, the compounds can   be<br>
combined with a suitable solid, liquid carrier or diluent to form capsules; tablets,<br>
powders, syrups, solutions, suspensions and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions,<br>
may, if desired, contain additional components such as flavorants, sweeteners, excipients<br>
and the like. For parenteral administration, the compounds can be combined with sterile<br>
aqueous or organic media to form   injectable solutions or suspensions.   For example,<br>
solutions in sesame or peanut oil, aqueous propylene glycol and the like can be used, as<br>
well as aqueous solutions of water-soluble pharmaceutically-acceptable acid addition<br>
salts or salts with base of the compounds. The injectable solutions prepared in this<br>
fBianner can then be administered intravenously, intrapentoneally, subcutaneously, or<br>
intramuscularly, with intramuscular administration being preferred m humans.<br>

A)        In vitro :<br>
a)	Determination of hPPARa activity<br>
Ligand binding domain of hPPARa was fused to DNA binding domain of Yeast transcription factor GAL4 in eucaryotic expression vector. Using superfect (Qiagen, Germany) as transfecting reagent HEK-293 cells were transfected with this plasmid and a reporter plasmid harboring (he luciferase gene driven by a GAL4 specific promoter. Compound was added at different concentrations after 42 hrs of transfection and incubated overnight. Luciferase activity as a function of compound binding/activation capacity of PPARa was measured using Packard Luclite kit (Packard, USA) in Top Count (Ivan Sadowski, Brendan Bell, Peter Broag and Melvyn Hollis. Gene. 1992. 118: 137 -141; Superfect Transfection Reagent Handbook. February, 1997. Qiagen, Gennany).<br>
b)	Determination of hPPARy activity<br>
Ligand binding domain of hPPARyl was fused to DNA binding domain of Yeast transcription factor GAL4 in eucaryotic expression vector. Using lipofectamine (Gibco BRL, USA) as transfecting reagent HEK-293 cells were transfected with this plasmid and a reporter plasmid harboring the luciferase gene driven by a GAL4 specific promoter. Compound was added at 1 ^M concentration after 48 hrs of transfection and incubated overnight. Luciferase activity as a function of drug binding/activation capacity of PPARyl was measured using Packard Luclite kit (Packard, USA) in Packard Top Count (Ivan Sadowski, Brendan Bell, Peter Broag and Melvyn Hollis. Gene. 1992. 118 : 137 -141; Guide to Eukaryotic Transfections with Cationic Lipid Reagents. Life Technologies, GIBCO BRL, USA).<br><br>
c)        Determination of HMG CoA reductase inhibition activity<br>
Liver microsome bound reductase was prepared from 2% cholestyramine fed rats at mid-dark cycle. Spectrophotometric assays were carried out in 100 mM KH2PO4, 4 mM DTT, 0.2 mM NADPH, 0.3 mM HMG CoA and 125 ^g of liver microsomal enzyme. Total reaction mixture volume was kept as 1 ml. Reaction was started by addition of HMG CoA. Reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded. Reaction mixture without substrate was used as . blank (Goldstein, J. L and Brown, M. S. Progress in understanding the LDL receptor and HMG CoA reductase, two membrane proteins that regulate the plasma cholesterol. J. Lipid Res. 1984, 25: 1450 - 1461). The test compounds inhibited the HMG CoA reductase enzyme.<br>
B)       In vivo<br>
a)  Efficacy in genetic models<br>
Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes and hyijcrlipidemia associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob (Diabetes, (1982) 31(1) : 1-6) mice and zucker fa/fa rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the efficacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838 ; Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. (1994). 46 : 1-57). The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, arc obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 : 962-967), whereas heterozygous arc lean and normoglycemic. In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in""late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models. Since this model resembles that of type II diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention were tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, bred at Dr. Reddy"s Research Foundation (DRF) animal house, were used in the experiment. The mice were provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum. The animals having<br><br>
m6re than 350 mg / dl blood sugar were used for testing. The number of animals in each group was 4.<br>
Test compounds were suspended on 0.25 % carboxymethyl celhilosc and administered to test group at a dose of 0.1 mg to 30 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group received vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). On 6th day the blood samples were collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels were measured by collecting blood (100 |il) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglyceride levels were measured spectrometrically, by glucose oxidase and gIycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase enzyme (Dr. Reddy"s Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively.<br>
The blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities of the test compound was calculated according to the formula.<br>
No adverse effects were observed for any of the mentioned compounds of invention in the above test.<br><br>
The ob/ob mice were obtained at 5 weeks of age from Bomholtgard, Demark and were used at 8 weeks of age. Zucker fji/fa fatty rats were obtained from IffaCredo, France at 10 weeks of age and were used at 13 weeks of age. The animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 + 1 "C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum (Fujiwara, T., Yoshioka, S., Yoshioka, T., Ushiyama, I and Horikoshi, H. Characterization of new oral antidiabetic agent CS-045. Studies in KK and ob/ob mice and Zucker (\itty rats. Diabetes. 1988. 37 : 1549 - 1558).<br><br>
• The test compounds were administered at O.l to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 9 days. The control animals received the vehicle (0.25 % earboxymcthylcclose, dose 10 ml/kg) through oral gavage.<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 9 day of treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through hcpariniscd capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride, glucose, free fatty acid, total cholesterol and insulin estimations. Measurement of plasma triglyceride, glucose, total cholesterol were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy"s Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). The plasma free fatty acid was measured using a commercial kit from Boehringer Mannheim, Gcnnany. The plasma insulin was measured using a RIA kit (BARC, India). The rcduction of various parameters examined arc calculated according to the formula given below.<br>
In ob/ob mice oral glucose tolerance lest was performed after 9 days treatment. Mice were fasted for 5 hrs and challenged with 3 gm/kg of glucose orally. The blood samples were collected at 0, 15, 30. 60 and 120 min for estimation of plasma glucose levels.<br>
The experimental results from the db/db mice, ob/ob mice, Zucker fa/fa rats suggest that the novel compounds of the present invention also possess therapeutic utility as a prophylactic or regular treatment for diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disorders such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and other diseases; as it is known from the literature that such diseases are interrelated to each other.<br>
Blood glucose level and triglycerides are also lowered at doses greater than 10 mg/kg. Normally, the quantum of reduction is dose dependent and plateaus at certain dose.<br>
b)	Plasma  triglyceride and  Cholesterol lowering  activity in<br>
hypercholesterolemic rat models<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (NIN stock) were bred in DRF animal house. Animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 ± 1 "C. Rats of 180 - 200 gram body weight range were used for the experiment. Animals were made hypercholesterolemic by feeding 2% cholesterol and 1% sodium cholate mixed with standard laboratory chow [National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India] for 6 days. Throughout the experimental period the animals were maintained on the same diet<br><br>

The test compounds were administered orally at a dose 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25 % Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 3 day of compound treatment. The blood was collected from the retro-orbital sinus through hcpariniscd capillary in EDTA containing lubes. After ccntrifugation, plasma sample was separated for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride estimations. Measurement of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL were done using commercial kits (Dr. Rcddy"s Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). LDL and VLDL cholesterol were calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride. The reduction of various parameters examined are calculated according to (he formula.<br><br>

Swiss albino mice and Guinea pigs<br>
Male Swiss albino mice (SAM) and male Guinea pigs were obtained from NIN and housed in DRF animal house. All these animals were maintained under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 ± 1 °C. Animals were given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum. SAM of 20 - 25 g body weight range and Guinea pigs of 500 - 700 g body weight range were used (Oliver, P., Plancke, M. O., Marzin, D., Clavcy, V., Sauzieres, J and Fnichart, J. C. Effects of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal and hyperlipidemic mice. Atherosclerosis. 1988. 70 : 107 - 114).<br><br>
 The test compounds were administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control mice were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxynicthylccllulosc; dose 10 ml/kg). The test compounds were administered orally to Guinea pigs at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control animals were treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 5 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples were collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of treatment. The blood was collected from the rclro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride and total cholesterol (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bcrgermeyer, H. O., Ed., 1963. 211 - 214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6 : 24 - 27). Measurement of plasma triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy"s Diagnostic Division, Hyderabad, India).<br><br>
c)	Body weight reducing effect in cholesterol fed hamsters :<br>
Male Syrian Hamsters were procured from NIN, Hyderabad, India. Animals were housed at DRF animal house under 12 hour light and dark cycle at 25 ± 1 "C with free access to food and water. Animals were maintained with 1 % cholesterol containing standard laboratory chow (NTN) from the day of treatment.<br>
The test compounds were administered orally at 1 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 15 days. Control group animals were treated with vehicle (Mill Q water, dose 10 ml/kg/day).<br>
