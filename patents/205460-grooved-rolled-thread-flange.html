COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10)<br><br><br>
GROOVED ROLLED THREAD FLANGE<br><br>
SUDERSHAN MADHOPRASAD SARAF of  30,  RAZAT APARTMENT MOUNT PLESANT ROAD, MUMBAI - 400 006, India, INDIAN national<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br><br>
GROOVED ROLLED THREAI FLANGE<br>
The invention relates to an improved Grooved Rolled Thread Flange fitted on the drum top as a closer.<br>
Conventional drum top closer are having flat flange member with or without gasket which are leak proof but when drum is damaged same are not sufficiently leakproof. During transportation, the liquid contained in the drum are leak through the drum top due to a sudden accidental impact and consequent damage.<br>
The prior art flat rolled threaded flanges are provided with a flat flange bottom (1) which supports and press the inner gasket (2) in between flat flange bottom and the drum top. Due to the sudden impact Drum Sheet mould leave gasket surface thus releasing pressure on the gasket then from gap through which the liquid contained in the drum will flow.<br>
The inventor with constant research has found effective solution. To obviate such drawbacks he made a grooved rolled threaded flange which is leakproof.<br>
Accordingly there isprovided a groove provided in rolled threaded flange (101) consisting of a grooved flange outwardly extended within this Groove a gaskets (102) is housed which is placed between the drum top (103) and the grooved flange the gaps  (104)  towards the top of neck is<br><br><br>
filled up by the gaskets as it moves upward while curling and then in case of any jurk thereby not loosen or keep pressed between the flange with the drum top.<br>
The principle object of this invention therefore is to provide a grooved rolled threaded flange for preventing a leakage of liquid contained in a container due to sudden impact.<br>
Further object of this invention is to provide a better threading with cost effective and strong, easy to handle.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to provide a leakproof flange which can be adopted to existing drums with out even slight modifications.<br>
The invention will now describe with reference to figure 1 to 4 with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a sectional view of the drum in a prior art systmes having a flat flange showing the gap between the gasket and drum top which is developed due to the impact and thereby leakage takes place.<br>
Figure 2 is a sectional view of grooved rolled thread flange which shows the leakproofness due to the climbing of gasket while insertion.<br>
Figure 3 is a sectional view of the original fitting with the grooved rolled thread flange on the drum top.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a sectional view of the grooved rolled thread flange showing the mounting of the gasket on the grooved flanges without drum top.<br>
Referring to figure 1 to *f the prior art system shown in figure 1 consisting of the flat flange (1) which is placed at right angle outwardly having a gasket made of elastbmeric material which is overlapped by a drum top (3) . When there is a impact the drump top will be away from the original position giving passage between the gasket and the drum top for leakage of liquid contained in the container which is due to release of pressure on gasket which kaS horizontal movement of the gasket outwardly.<br>
Referring to figure 2 to 4 which pertains to this invention grooved rolled thread flange wherein the flange (101) is a grooved base on which a elongatated gasket (102) is mounted with a outer enclosure drum top (103) which allows the gasket to climb upward (104) thereby filling the gap between the flange and the drum top thereby preventing leakage.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention several modifications are possible which may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since any modification, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described<br><br>
embodiment it is intended that all matters	described in the<br>
foregoing description and illustration in	the accompanying<br>
drawing may be considered within the	spirit  of  this<br>
invention.<br>
PRESENT SYSTEM :<br>
I)	Conventional flanges have flat surface on octagonal face, toward cylindrical wall of the flange, the flange gasket is fittign on this side.<br>
II)	Conventional flange which has a radius, which is formed during press operation (cupping); has a characteristic or effect to shift (slide) the gasket upward;<br>
III)	When flange is inserted by pressing the flange in drum top this gasket can flow in both directions, i.e. horizontally towards octagonal edge and or upward along the cylindrical wall i.e. neck of drum.<br>
IV)	Portion of the gasket which flows in the horizontal direction has a little contribution towards preventing leakage.<br>
V)	The portion of gasket going upward alon the cylindrical portion is desired to climb upto portion where neck of drum top and flange neck i.e. cylindrical portion which does not curl are straight and nearly touching each other.<br><br>
VI)	While drop testing the drum is hold such that the chime portion which is near flange is facing downward, and by impact drum top it tries to bend and the flat octagonal portion of the flange and drum top sheet try to go away from each other since drum top gets bend inward; this creates a situation where flange gasket loose pressure and its sealability as it is no more filling the space between flange and drum top.<br>
VII)	This can be achieved only if gasket is prevented from expanding horizontally and thereby forcing the seal to move upwards along the cylindrical portion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A grooved roller threaded flange (101) having a straight verticle height portion and angular base portion extended outwardly which accommodates a elongated gasket (102) within the groove which is sandwitch between the height of the grooved flange and other covering of the drum top (103) which is projected inwardly to press against the gasket to allow the gasket to climb upward in the gap (104) in case of any jerk and there is form a flange angle which is a accute angle between 0 to 15 make tightining of the flange with the drum top.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A grooved rolled threaded flange (101) consisting of a grooved flange outwardly extended within this Groove a gaskets (102) is housed which is placed between the drum top (103) and the grooved flange the gaps (104) towards the top is filled up by the gaskets while it moves upward in case of any jerk thereby tightening the flange with the drum top. A threaded flange having a straight vertical/height portion and angular base portion extended outwardly which accomodates a elongatated gasket which is sandwich between the height of the flange and the outer covering of the drum top. The drum top is projected inwardly to press against the gasket. The flange angle is an acute angle after insertion. The acute angle is from 0 to 15 inside under the use. The gasket climb upward while insertion instead of going horizontally which makes assembly leakproof. The flange and the drum top made from material particularly of metals and non-metals. The gasket is made from elastomer material, resins material or type of material which elongates due to pressure force.<br>
The inventor has tried to provide a groove on the flange base as shown in figure 2; this design will reduce probability of -<br>
1)	Drum top which touches the elevated portion of the grt flange base ahead of octagonal edge;<br>
2)	Due to the above action there is no space for gasket of grt flange to spread along the flat portion of octagonal face;<br>
3)	The groove makes it difficult for flange gasket to flow towards octagonal edge and the grt flange gasket under pressure now can only flow out in the upward direction along the cylindrical wall toward the neck of drum top and bend portion of grt flange, which clamps the neck of drum top;<br><br><br>
ADDITIONAL BENEFITS -<br>
4)	GRT Flange is manufactured by technique of rolling threads which makes it stronger;<br>
5)	The bend of the base makes grt flange acceptance to those drum manufacturers, who are using thick base. These manufacturers can switch over to grt flange without much modification in insertion tooling, particularly chutes.<br>
6)	The leakproofness avoids use of extra gasket thereby making grt flange more competitive;<br>
7)	Use of smaller gauge of steel going in the manufacture in grt flange helps in weight reduction andhigher utilisation o£ steel thereby global benefits in conserving steel resource.<br>
8)	Special shape also adds to rigidity and stiffness of base .<br>
Rolled Thread Grooved Flange as per sketch A. is specially developed by TECHNOCRAFT INDUSTRIES (INDIA) LTD. To enhance safety and is particularly useful when hazardous chemicals are to be transported.<br>
Special base Geometry not only imparts additional stiffnessbut drives gasket upwards when flange is inserted iri a containex top. Ttiis cabases gasket to get lodged between<br><br><br>
I CLAIM :<br>
1.	A grooved roller threaded flange (101) having a straight verticle height portion and angular base portion extended outwardly which accommodates a elongated gasket (102) within the groove which is sandwitch between the height of the grooved flange and other covering of the drum top (103) which is projected inwardly to press against the gasket to allow the gasket to climb upward in the gap (104) in case of any jerk and there is form a flange angle which is a accute angle between 0 to 15 make tightining of the flange with the drum top.<br>
