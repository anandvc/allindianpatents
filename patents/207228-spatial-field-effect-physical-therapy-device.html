The spatial field effect physical therapy device according to the present invention used as a medical instrument can achieve curative effects on many diseases in human body, e.g. trauma, acute and chronic soft tissue injury, sequela of cerebrovascular lesion, pelvic inflammation, periarthritis of shoulder, and urinary system infection, etc, especially has prominent effect on the pains of cervical vertebra and lumbar vertebra diseases, rheumatic and rheumatoid diseases. The studies for the functions and effects of the spatial field effect physical therapy device<br>
The experiments of studying for the functions of the device are as follows:<br>
I. the energy density distribution of the radiation field formed by the Yijing columns array is measured by infrared thermal image device.<br>
Apparatus for testing: Thermal Image System, model TVS-5500<br>
Samples for testing: two sets of copper Yijing columns, one is long columns array, and the other is short columns array.<br>
Testing methods: the long Yijing columns are arrayed in different styles, which are then tested respectively. While, the short Yijing columns are arrayed in one style for testing twice.<br>
Results of testing: as shown in Tab. 1<br>
Tab. 1 image data of the radiation field formed by the Yijing columns array measured by thermal image device<br>
3<br><br><br>
Analysis of the testing results D Infrared radiation energy is expressed by radiation temperature. The temperature value of each point of the thermal image is radiation temperature TY, which reflects the radiation energy density EY of the region containing the point. The relationship is:<br>
Ey=OTY4<br>
wherein,  is Stcfan-Boltamann Constant 5.68x 10-8Wm2K-4<br>
TYis the sum of the temperature t showed on the image and 273, i.e..<br>
TY=t+273(K)<br>
The value of the temperature showed on the thermal image reflects the amount of radiation energy density.<br>
To compare the radiations formed by the Yijing columns arrays in different styles of arrangement, the data of infrared thermal images are processed with computer software. Fig. 4 is the interface of the software for processing infrared thermal image, in which image of No. 11254 is being processed. The dialog box on the left upper part is the set value of emissivity. The gray value and the maximal or minimal temperature can be read directly from the thermal image. Fig. 5 shows the processed result for image of No. 11258. In order to test the effects of radiation field formed by the Yijing columns array, it is needed to obtain the temperature field which is a region with higher temperature formed by the Yijing columns array. Next, evaluate the energy of the radiation field<br>
4<br><br>
5<br>
formed by the Yijing columns array based on the average radiation temperature and the maximal radiation temperature of this region. For this purpose, the emissivity of all the regions for testing are set as !. A rectangle pane is selected in the region with higher temperature for each thermal image obtained from the test. The pane is a circumscribed rectangle of 4x2 copper columns with the scope of 136x109 in the image. Calculating the average radiation temperature and the maximal radiation temperature of each rectangle, and then comparing the processed data of the infrared thermal images corresponding to the different styles of arrangement. The results are shown in Tab. 2. Tab. 2 shows the processed data of image No. 11258.<br><br><br>
It is concluded from the above table that the data of images No. 11254 and 11258 is obviously different with each other. Both of them are copper long columns arrayed by 8x8, temperature ranging 20~24°C, with 0.8 °C difference of room temperatures, 1.2 °C difference of average temperature of the rectangle region, 1.65 °C difference of maximal temperature when testing. It can be observed from the thermal images that the root mean square differences of temperature are caused by the lower radiation temperature of the copper columns and higher radiation temperature of the interspacing region. The root mean square difference of No. 1 1258 image is higher than that of No. 11254 image, which indicates that the temperature of the interspacing region of No. 11258 image increases comparing with that of No. 11254 image. It can be concluded from the above test that the radiation field formed by the regularly arrayed columns has higher energy than that of the randomly arrayed columns.<br>
II.	Experiments for the influence of the Yijing columns on the growth of bacteria and<br>
moulds<br>
a.	First add culture medium into culture plates, and then put the plates as samples over<br>
the Yijing columns array, and the plates as controls in the normal conditions. After several days,<br>
it was observed that moulds grew in the sample plates, while no moulds grew in the control<br>
plates.<br>
b.	First inoculate Escherichia coli onto the inclined plane of the test tubes, and then put<br>
the test tubes as samples over the Yijing columns array, and the test tubes as controls in the<br>
normal conditions. After several days, it was observed that bacteria on the inclined plane of<br>
samples 1, 3 grew much better than those of controls 2, 4.<br>
III.	Experiment for enhancing hypoxia tolerance of mice by the Yijing columns array<br>
Experiment  methods:   in  conformity  with  the examination  method  for the  function  of<br>
hypoxic tolerance prescribed by "Examination Method and Evaluation Procedure for Functionology of Health Food" issued in 1996 by the Ministry of Health.<br>
Experimental animals: male Kunming mice, grade 2, about 6 weeks old, with the body weight of 20~24g (22.7±l .86g), purchased from the Breeding Group in Institute of experimental animal. Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, with the Certificate No. 01-3001.<br>
Grouping and feeding for animals: after two days of adaptation in the animal laboratory, 60 experimental animals were randomly divided into 2 control groups and 2 experimental groups<br><br>
according to their body weights, 15 animals per group. Animals in each group were fed with normal animal feeds and drink freely.<br>
Experiment procedures<br>
The experimental animals were placed on the experimental frame. The Yijing columns were put right under the experimental frame. The control groups were placed on the experimental frame with the same height which was put in the normal conditions. Furthermore, the distance between experimental groups and control groups is more than 3 meters.<br>
The experiment of hypoxic tolerance under normal pressure proceeded at two stages. The mice were bred for 14 days at the first stage, and 30 days at the second stage. Then the experiment of hypoxic tolerance under normal pressure was conducted respectively on the above mice.<br>
Put mice of each group into 250ml jars with 15g soda-lime per jar, and the jar mouths were smeared with Vaseline, only one mouse in each jar. Immediately cover the lids to make the jar airtight as soon as the mice were put in. Subsequently record the duration time till the mice's breath cease.<br>
Statistical analysis: H analysis (Kruskal-Wallis One Way Analysis of Variance on Ranks) being used for statistical analysis.<br>
Results: results in the following table are the duration time of the control and experimental groups under the normal pressure hypoxia conditions. For the mice at first stage of treating for 14 days, the duration time of experimental group I has the tendency of prolonging by comparison with control group 1. For the mice at the second stage of treating for 30 days, the duration time of experimental group 2 increases averagely 3-2 minutes in comparison with control group 2, existing significant difference by statistical analysis.<br>
Conclusions: the Yijing columns have The effects of enforcing hypoxic tolerance on mice.<br>

19<br><br>
2. curative effect on symptoms of rheumatic and rheumatoid arthritis diseases: shown in Tab.<br><br>
3. The average onset time of taking effect on the pain in cervical vertebra, lumbar vertebra diseases and rheumatic and rheumatoid diseases are 3.15 days and 4.92 days, respectively.<br>
Adverse reactions:<br>
The field intensity of the spatial field effect physical therapy device used at this stage of clinical trial is stronger than that of the above two stages (the following is for the detail). It is cautious to be treated for the patients who are aged, weak in health, or with heart diseases.<br>
Three patients with adverse reactions were observed during this stage of clinical trials: hemicrania appeared in one 73-year-old female patient after the first treatment; headache and dizzy appeared in one 47-year-old female patient after twice treatments; neither of the two patients finished 20 times of treatments, and therefore they were not included in the observation cases. We know that all the symptoms disappeared after ceasing the treatment for 2 days during the follow-up visit with the two patients. Another case with adverse reactions was a 54-year-old female patient with' heart-flustration appeared after twice treatments, but disappeared after ceasing treating for two days. The patient continued to be treated without any adverse reactions, but obvious curative effects instead.<br>
Discussion:<br>
From the results of the abo\e three stages of treatments, it can be concluded that: I. the effects of solid columns is stronger than hollow columns; II. the effects of heating is stronger than non-heating; and III. the effects of short-distance field is stronger than long-distance field. It is because of the continuous improvement of the technology and usage that the improvement of curative effects can be observed in the third stage in comparison with the first and second stage of treatment. The patients are willing to be treated by this device. Furthermore, the delightful effects of the present device are the outstanding effects for relief of pains and amelioration of dysfunction.<br>
20<br><br>
It is cautious to be treated for the patients who are aged, weak in health, or with heart-flustration symptoms under high field intensity. The preventive measures are: I. shorten the treating time from the normal 30-40 minutes to 20 minutes per time; II. reduce the two short-distance cushion-shaped fields into one. According to the total cases observed, the percentage of the adverse reactions is about 6%. The symptoms of the adverse reactions will disappear quickly after ceasing the treatment, and no sequelae observed.<br>
According to the three stages of clinical trials, we believe that the spatial field effect physical therapy device is an instrument with favorable curative effects, especially has preferable curative effects on cervical vertebra diseases, lumbar vertebra diseases, rheumatic and rheumatoid diseases.<br>
