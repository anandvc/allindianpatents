				<td>MULTIFOCAL CONTACT LENS DESIGNS UTILIZING PUPIL APODIZATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to multifocal ophthalmic lenses. In particular, the<br>
invention provides contact lenses that provide correction for presbyopia using<br>
multifocal designs that are scaled to an individual, or group of individuals, based on<br>
both pupil size and the Stiles-Crawf 3rd effect.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
As an individual ages, the eye is less able to accommodate, or bend the<br>
natural lens, to focus on objects that are relatively near to the observer. This<br>
condition is known as presbyopia. Similarly, for persons who have had their natural<br>
lens removed and an intraocular lens; inserted as a replacement, the ability to<br>
accommodate is absent.<br>
Among the methods used to correct for the eye's failure to accommodate are<br>
lenses that have more than one optical power. In particular, multifocal contact and<br>
intraocular lenses have been developed in which zones of distance and near, and in<br>
some cases intermediate, power are provided.<br>
It is known that an individual's pupil size varies with age, luminance and<br>
distance from the eye to the object being viewed. For example, as luminance<br>
increases, pupil size decreases while, as a person ages, the pupil's response to<br>
changes in illumination diminishes. However, some conventional multifocal contact<br>
lenses typically do not account for pupil size and, thus, are less efficient in<br>
distributing light to the lens wearer in all viewing conditions. Even in those lenses<br>
that account for pupil size, the lenses do not account for the fact that the cones of the<br>
eye are more sensitive to light rays that strike perpendicular to the cones' surface<br>
than other rays. Thus, the intensity of the response to light peaks at or near the<br>
center of the pupillary aperture and decreases towards the edges, a phenomenon<br>
 <br>
known as the Stiles-Crawford effect of the first kind ("Stiles Crawford Effect" or<br>
"SCE"). Therefore, the best visual result for a lens cannot be obtained by merely<br>
matching the size of the optical zones of a multifocal lens by taking into account<br>
only pupil size. Rather, the design must take into account both the pupil size and the<br>
Stiles-Crawford Effect.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 depicts a multifocal lens design.<br>
Figure 2 depicts the design of Figure 1 scaled to account for pupil<br>
size.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides a contact lens, and methods for producing the lens,<br>
which lens corrects for the wearer's refractive prescription by taking into account<br>
pupil size along with the SCE. The method of the invention is useful in designing<br>
both multifocal contact and intraocular lenses, but may find its greatest utility in<br>
providing multifocal contact lens designs.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for designing a contact<br>
lens, comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the steps of: a.)<br>
providing an optical design; and b.) scaling the optical design based on pupil size<br>
and SCE.<br>
In the first step of the invention, a multifocal optical design is provided. The<br>
design may be any desired multifocal design, but preferably the design contains at<br>
least two, radially symmetric zones: a first zone that is a central zone and a second<br>
zone that is an annular zone that surrounds the central zone. Preferably, the central<br>
zone is a distance vision zone, meaning a zone that provides the power required to<br>
substantially correct the lens wearer's distance vision acuity to the degree desired.<br>
 <br>
The annular zone preferably is a near vision zone, meaning a zone that provides the<br>
power required to substantially correct the lens wearer's near vision acuity to the<br>
degree desired. Alternatively, the near vision zone may be biased up to about 0.5<br>
diopters to provide intermediate vision correction.<br>
More preferably, the design includes a second annular zone that provides<br>
distance vision correction. Any number of additional zones may be included in the<br>
design, which zones may provide ore or more of distance or near vision correction<br>
or intermediate power, meaning corrective power between that of the near and<br>
distance power. For illustrative purposes, a multifocal design 10 is depicted in<br>
Figure 1. The design is composed of a central distance vision zone 15, a first<br>
annular zone of near vision power 16 and a second annular zone of distance vision<br>
power. The radii of the central zone ("r1"), the first annular zone ("r2"), and the<br>
second annular zone ("r3") is 1, 2, and 4 mm, respectively, measured from point A,<br>
the geometric center point of the lens surface.<br>
In the method of the invention, the design is scaled based on pupil size and a<br>
consideration of the SCE. In scaling based on pupil size, either pupil size<br>
measurements of a population of individuals or a pupil size of one individual may be<br>
used. For example, Table 1 lists pupil size data based on thirteen individuals<br>
between 35 to 42 years of age.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The data may be used to calculate a best fit using the following equation:<br>
y = 4.8997x-0.1448	(I)<br>
wherein x is the luminance level in candela per millimeter; and<br>
y is the pupil diameter in millimeters. The results of such calculation are listed in<br>
the "Best Fit, All Data" column of Table 1.<br>
Alternatively, the following power law fit equation may be used for<br>
calculating based on pupil size data of an individual:<br>
y = 5.9297x-0.1692 (II)<br>
wherein x is the luminance level in candela per millimeter; and<br>
y is the pupil diameter in millimeters. The results of such calculation are listed in<br>
the "Extrapolation for 1 Individual" column of Table 1.<br>
As an example, the three zone, multifocal design of Figure 1 is scaled based<br>
on an individual's pupil size. Table 2 below lists typical light levels measured in a<br>
variety of lighting environments.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Based on the data in Table 2. a representative luminance level for outdoor,<br>
daytime viewing of far objects is about 1000 cd/m2, for viewing near and<br>
intermediate objects indoors is about 15 cd/m2, and for viewing far objects outdoors<br>
in the evening is about 0.30 cd/m2. When the data in Table 3 is extrapolated<br>
according to Equation II, the pupil size diameter of the individual is 2.0 mm at 1000<br>
cd/m2, 4.0 mm at 10 cd/m2, and 7.2 mm at 0.30 cd/m2.<br>
The foregoing extrapolation is used to scale the design of Figure 1. The<br>
resultant scaled design 20 is shown in Figure 2 with the radius of the central zone<br>
("r4"), the first annular zone ("r5"), and the second annular zone ("r6") being 1, 2,<br>
 <br>
and 3.65 mm, respectively. Thus, the outer diameter of central distance vision zone<br>
25 is 2 mm, the inner diameter and outer diameter of annular near vision zone 26 is<br>
2 mm and 4 mm, respectively, and the inner and outer diameters of outer distance<br>
vision zone 27 is 4 mm and 7.3 mm, respectively. The ratio of the areas of the<br>
central, near and outer distance vision zone is 1.3.0:8.96.<br>
In the method of the invention, the SCE is used to scale the design. Due to<br>
the SCE, the efficiency of the conversion of light into a visual photo-potential<br>
decreases away from the center of the pupil, or the point of peak efficiency. This<br>
drop off of efficiency may be represented by a parabolic function given by the<br>
Equation:<br>
 <br>
wherein η is the efficiency of visualization of effectiveness;<br>
x is the distance of any point on the pupil from the point of peak efficiency; and<br>
p is a constant that is about 0.05 in healthy subjects.<br>
Equation III is useful for determining the decrease in efficiency up to<br>
pupillary diameters of 6mm. Beyond 6 mm, a Gaussian fit is used.<br>
To determine the effective pupillary diameter that corrects for the SCE,<br>
Equation III is rewritten as:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
putting Η as y, and xmax as 0.<br>
Equation IV is then integrated to obtain the area under the curve to the<br>
pupillary edge, as for example x = 3 for a 6 mm pupil, and equated to a rectangle of<br>
the same area. For a measured papillary radius of X0, the effective radius is:<br>
 <br>
Effective pupillary diameters computed for certain representative measured<br>
values of pupillary diameters are listed on Table 3 below.<br>
 <br>
Table 3 shows that, for large pupil sizes, the effective pupil size is smaller than the<br>
actual pupil size.<br>
 <br>
In the design shown in Figure 1, the area ratio for Figure 1 is 1:3.0:8.96 with<br>
pupil radii of 1, 2, and 3.65 mm. Considering just pupil area, which correlates with<br>
how much light energy is focused onto the retina from each zone, it can be<br>
concluded that the outer zone is too large and will negatively bias performance of<br>
the design.<br>
In more detail, the area of the center ring is pi*r12, the area of the first<br>
annular ring is pi*(r22 - r12), and that of the outer ring is pi*(r32 - r22). The ratio of<br>
the areas of the central to the near to the outer zone may be calculated as follows:<br>
 <br>
This may be simplified to:<br>
 <br>
wherein each of r1, r2 and r3 are the effective radii calculated using Equation V.<br>
Calculating an effective pupil diameter using Equation V and then comparing the<br>
areas of each ring gives a ratio of 1:2.23:2.94 demonstrating that there is a<br>
significant decrease in the effectiveness of the outer distance vision zone.<br>
Further, taking into account studies indicating that there is little loss of visual<br>
acuity as the level of luminance falls from 75 cd/m2 to 7.5 cd/m2, but that there is a<br>
pronounced loss of acuity as the luminance decreases from 7.5 cd/m2 to 0.75 cd/m2<br>
to 0.075 cd/m2, the impact of defocus induced image blur is more deleterious to<br>
visual acuity in low luminance conditions. Therefore, once the individual's near<br>
vision acuity needs are met, there is a need to provide as large an area of distance<br>
vision correcting optic as the individual's pupil will allow. Thus, a better<br>
distribution for this design will be obtained by decreasing the outer diameter of the<br>
 <br>
near vision zone from 4 mm to 3.6 mm and increasing the outer diameter of the zone<br>
to 8.0 mm providing a distribution of area ratio that is 1:1.76:3.8<br>
The foregoing illustrates scaling the design based on the pupil size of an<br>
individual. As an alternative, the design may be scaled based on the averages of<br>
pupil size information for a population of individuals as, for example, the full group<br>
represented by the data shown in the last two columns of Table 1. As yet another<br>
alternative, subgroups of a population may be defined, each of which subgroups<br>
contains individuals with similar pupil diameters as a function of luminance level.<br>
In the designs of the invention, the best results will be obtained in cases in<br>
which the pupil size of the lens wearer dilates to a size that can use most or all of the<br>
multifocal zone. In the three-zone design, as the contribution of the outer distance<br>
vision zone diminishes due to insufficient pupil dilation, the amount of light entering<br>
the pupil decreases and there will be a drop in visual acuity. Thus, the three zone<br>
design may not be the optimal for individuals whose pupil does not dilate to 6.0 mm.<br>
In those cases, a two zone bifocal design, with a central near vision zone and an<br>
annular distance vision zone may be preferable. In this two zone design, if the<br>
central one diameter is 2.0 mm, a satisfactory image intensity for near objects will<br>
be obtained and the outer distance zone will provide satisfactory correction for those<br>
instances in which the pupil dilates in low luminance environments.<br>
In the lenses of the invention, the central zone and additional zones may be<br>
on the front surface, or object side surface, the back surface, or eye side surface of<br>
the lens, or split between the front and back surfaces. Cylinder power may be<br>
provided on the back, or concave surface of the lens in order to correct the wearer's<br>
astigmatism. Alternatively, the cylinder power may be combined with either or both<br>
of the distance and near vision powers on the front surface or back surface. In all of<br>
 <br>
the lenses of the invention, the distance, intermediate and near optical powers may<br>
be spherical or aspheric powers.<br>
Contact lenses useful in the invention preferably are soft contact lenses. Soft<br>
contact lenses, made of any material suitable for producing such lenses, preferably<br>
are used. Illustrative materials for formation of soft contact lenses include, without<br>
limitation silicone elastomers, silicone-containing macromers including, without<br>
limitation, those disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,371,147, 5,314,960, and<br>
5,057,578 incorporated in their entireties herein by reference, hydrogels, silicone-<br>
containing hydrogels, and the like and combinations thereof. More preferably, the<br>
surface is a siloxane, or contains a siloxane functionality, including, without<br>
limitation, polydimethyl siloxane macromers, methacryloxypropyl polyalkyl<br>
siloxanes, and mixtures thereof, silicone hydrogel or a hydrogel, such as etafilcon A.<br>
A preferred lens-forming material is a poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate<br>
polymers, meaning, having a peak molecular weight between about 25,000 and<br>
about 80,000 and a polydispersity of less than about 1.5 to less than about 3.5<br>
respectively and covalently bonded thereon, at least one cross-linkable functional<br>
group. This material is described in Attorney Docket Number VTN 588, United<br>
States Serial No. 60/363,630 incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.<br>
Suitable materials for forming intraocular lenses include, without limitation,<br>
polymethyl methacrylate, hydroxyethyl methacrylate, inert clear plastics, silicone-<br>
based polymers, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Curing of the lens forming material may be carried out by any means known<br>
including, without limitation, thermal, irradiation, chemical, electromagnetic<br>
radiation curing and the like and combinations thereof. Preferably, the lens is<br>
molded which is carried out using ultraviolet light or using the full spectrum of<br>
 <br>
visible light. More specifically, the precise conditions suitable for curing the lens<br>
material will depend on the material selected and the lens to be formed.<br>
Polymerization processes for ophthalmic lenses including, without limitation,<br>
contact lenses are well known. Suitable processes are disclosed in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,540,410 incorporated herein in its entirely by reference.<br>
The contact lenses of the invention may be formed by any conventional<br>
method. For example, the optic zone may be produced by diamond-turning or<br>
diamond-turned into the molds that are used to form the lens of the invention.<br>
Subsequently, a suitable liquid resin is placed between the molds followed by<br>
compression and curing of the resin to form the lenses of the invention<br>
Alternatively, the zone may be diamond-turned into lens buttons.<br>
