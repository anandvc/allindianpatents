COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"A SYSTEM FOR HANDLING BANKNOTES WITHIN A GEOGRAPHICALLY LIMITED AREA"<br>
NYBOHOV DEVELOPMENT AB, a Swedish company, of P O Box 47041, S-100 74 Stockholm, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system for handling banknotes within a geographically limited area. Despite many predictions of the imminence of a "moneyless society", the sum represented nominally by circulating banknotes has not decreased, even though the number of banknotes in percentage of BNP is now diminishing as a result of the introduction of new electronic technologies, .such as smart cards, for instance. Investigations carried out in 1995 showed that the value in USD of the number of banknotes circulating per capita was 528 in England, 662 in Canada, 891 in France, 1,082 in Italy, 1,312 in Sweden, 2,025 in Germany and 3,873 in Japan.<br>
Handling of banknotes is extremely costly and still involves much manual work and many transport runs to and from consumers, businesses, banks and also to the National Central<br>
r<br>
Bank for quality sorting purposes and for the purpose of tracing forged banknotes.<br>
The banknotes are counted on a number of different occasions during this circulation and security problems are significant. The cost of handling banknotes in Sweden alone is estimated at 1.3 billion U.S. dollars. When this number is converted to correspond to the number of people in the European Union, there is reached a handling cost of about 45 billion U.S. dollars.<br><br>
Large savings can be made by introducing a more rational and decentralised banknote handling system. The transition to a common currency provides a splendid opportunity of advancing with wide strides towards the introduction of an effective banknote handling system within the European Union, with a potential  saving   in  billions   of   euros.<br>
BACKGROUND  OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
Various types of automatic telling machines for the deposit and withdrawal of banknotes are known to the art. These automatic telling machines may be equipped with banknote counting means and also with means for establishing the quality of banknotes and/or means for searching for forged banknotes. Although such automatic telling machines function satisfactorily, they do not eliminate the aforesaid costly banknote handling operations in society, which include repeated counting of bundles of banknotes during their general circulation.<br>
SUMMARY   OF  THE   INVENTION<br><br>
With the intention of eliminating the aforesaid high costs involved with traditional banknote handling operations, there is provided a novel system for handling banknotes within a geographically limited area. The system includes a plurality of banknote handling machines which are distributed over said area for the deposit and withdrawal of banknotes and which are constructed to bundle, package surplus banknotes of accepted quality and banknotes of non-accepted quality, and possibly also forged banknotes . The system also includes an information    centre    which     is     common    to    said    plurality    of<br><br>
machines and which receives information and data from said machines and sends information, data and control signals to said machines, said information including data concerning the presence of stored banknotes, packaged banknotes, banknotes of a non-accepted quality, and also banknotes that are possibly forged.<br>
The system also includes a plurality of transport means for transporting packaged banknotes to and from said machines in response to commands from the information centre, in accordance with information sent from the machines to the information centre.<br>
This system eliminates the need of regularly transporting banknotes to respective National Central Banks for quality sorting and searching for possibly forged banknotes. Because<br>
the machines count and seal surplus banknote packages in so-called disposable cassettes, the need to make a number of subsequent check counts is eliminated. The banknotes are stored in the sealed cassettes during transportation. The cassettes containing surplus banknotes are not opened until the banknotes are required for use. Cassettes that contain forged banknotes or low quality banknotes are transported to the banknote centre of the National Central Bank for treatment. Each cassette is accompanied with a receipt that identifies the machine from which respective banknote cassettes originate, while specifying the contents of the cassette. The cassette may be cf a disposable kind and reveals any attempt t.o open the cassette unlawfully.<br>
One or more information centres is/are set up for each geographically  limited  area,  e.g.  a country,  and  is/are<br><br>
responsible for statistics concerning banknote requirements and banknote routes, and has/have a two-way on-line connection with the automatic telling machines and the transport vehicles. These latter vehicles are equipped for servicing the machines, delivering spare parts, plastic cassette-packaging materials, etc.<br>
The machines inform the information centre of the number of banknotes deposited and withdrawn, the number of banknotes and their values located in respective machines, the number of forged banknotes that may have been discovered, the number of poor quality banknotes that have been discovered, and the number of available cassettes. The information centre is also informed when a machine needs to be emptied of banknotes or replenished with banknotes. If appropriate, this information can also be sent to the National Central Bank and therewith enable the bank owning the machine to regulate its account with the National Central Bank immediately and continuously.<br>
The information centre informs the National Central Bank of the number of banknotes magazined in the machines at each<br><br>
point in time, the number of poor quality banknotes that should be destroyed by the National Central bank, and also immediately of any	forged banknotes that	may have	been<br>
discovered.<br>
Each machine can be programmed with respect to its banknote requirement for a particular day or part cf a day over a full year, thereby enabling future banknote requirements to be planned ahead and consequently more effective use of the transport vehicles.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawing.<br>
A plurality of banknote handling machines 11, 12, 13, 14, ... In are positioned over a geographically limited area 1 for the deposit and withdrawal of banknotes. These machines are adapted to bundle and cassette-package surplus banknotes of accepted quality on the one hand, banknotes of non-acceptable quality on the other hand, and any forged banknotes that may have been discovered on the third hand.<br>
Connected to respective machines is an information centre 10 which is common to said machine and which receives information from said machines and delivers information and controls signals thereto. This information includes factual data pertaining to the presence of stored banknotes and cassette-packaged banknotes on the one hand, and banknotes of non-acceptable quality on the other hand, and any false banknotes that may have been discovered on the third hand.<br>
f<br>
The system also includes a plurality of transport vehicles 18, 19, 20, 21 for transporting cassette-packaged banknotes to and from said machines 11, 12, 13, 14, ... In in response to orders issued by the information centre 10 on the basis of information sent from the  machines to the information centre.<br>
Shown in the drawing are two banks 16, 17 which may be machine owners and which are responsible for these machines in their particular regions of the geographically limited area 1. The main responsibility for handling banknotes in the<br><br>
community concerned lies with the National Central Bank 15. Communication connections between the various units (banknote handling machines/information centre, transport vehicles/information centre, banks/information centre, banks/National Central Bank) are indicated in broken lines.<br>
Because each machine, each transport vehicle, each security bag used in conjunction with the transportation of cassettes/banknotes between the various units and each person active in the system can be given an individual identity (code), the information centre will have control over the location of banknotes/cassettes and over their destination at each moment in time. This provides a highly secure, simplified and cost-reducing system for modern handling of banknotes.<br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
A system for handling banknotes within a geographically limited area, characterised by a plurality of banknote handling machines (11, 12, 13, ... In) positioned over the geographically limited area (1) for depositing and withdrawing banknotes, said machines being adapted to bundle and cassette-package surplus banknotes of accepted quality on the one hand, banknotes of non-accepted quality on the other hand, and any false banknotes that may have been discovered on the third hand;<br>
an information centre (10) which is common to said plurality of machines for receiving information from and sending information and control signals to said machines (11, 12, 13, ... In), said information including factual data relating to the presence of stored banknotes and cassette-packaged banknotes on the one hand, banknotes of a non-acceptable quality on the other hand, and any forged banknotes that may have been discovered;   and<br>
a plurality of transport means (18, 19, 20, 21) for transporting cassette-packaged banknotes to and from said machines (11, 12, 13, ... In) in response to orders from the information centre (10) issued on the basis of information sent  from the machines   to   said   information  centre.<br>
