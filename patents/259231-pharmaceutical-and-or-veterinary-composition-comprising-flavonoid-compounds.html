				<td>CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
The present application claims priority from Australian Provisional Patent<br>
Application No. 2005901214 filed on 11 March 2005, the content of which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds, compositions containing these<br>
compounds, methods for their synthesis, and uses of these compounds. In particular, the<br>
present invention relates to flavonoid compounds, methods of synthesizing the flavonoid<br>
compounds, compositions containing the flavonoid compounds and methods of their use.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prompt reperfusion of ischemic tissue is critical for restoring normal function.<br>
However, this return of blood flow can paradoxically produce a progressive destruction of<br>
reversibly damaged cells, thereby leading to tissue dysfunction and infarction. This<br>
"reperfusion injury" has multifactorial causes of disease but appears to be strongly<br>
associated with an inflammatory response; with the return of blood flow, several<br>
inflammatory processes may occur to potentiate ischemic injury, including leukocyte<br>
adhesion and infiltration and the release of reactive oxidative species (ROS) such as<br>
oxygen free radical species and peroxides, for example H2O2.<br>
Much of this inflammatory response appears to be mediated by interleukins (ILs), a<br>
multifunctional subclass of cytokines. Leukocytes (white blood cells) also appear to play<br>
a critical role in reperfusion injury. In addition to injuring endothelium and neurons,<br>
leukocytes can obstruct the microcirculation directly. This leukocyte capillary plugging<br>
also may be the major mechanism of the "no-reflow phenomenon." Thus areas of<br>
parenchyma that are still viable when blood flow returns are not reperfused adequately and<br>
ultimately die. Myocardial ischaemia in particular causes extensive capillary plugging.<br>
Ischaemia, and particularly reperfusion, tend to promote an increased release of<br>
ROS's from leukocytes which leads to further tissue damage. One of the most damaging<br>
types of free radicals is superoxide anions which act to impair endothelial function and the<br>
activity of nitric oxide (NO). This further worsens the capillary plugging process because<br><br>
NO has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation and to prevent leukocyte adherence to<br>
the endothelium.<br>
The degree of tissue recovery achieved after ischaemia and reperfusion depends on<br>
the nature of the tissue and the severity of the damage.<br>
Ischaemia can be caused by a variety of conditions. For example, acute incidents<br>
such as stroke, myocardial infarction or mechanical trauma, and chronic conditions such<br>
as atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease and diabetes can cause ischaemia.<br>
Hypertension is another type of disorder that can lead to ischaemia.<br>
Following an acute incident such as a heart attack caused by a blocked coronary<br>
artery, various drugs are delivered intravenously to the heart attack victim to assist in<br>
removing any blood vessel obstruction thus re-establishing blood flow leading to<br>
reperfusion of tissues. However, this type of treatment is not directed to preventing or<br>
ameliorating the tissue damage associated with reperfusion. Creating an environment for<br>
reperfusion to occur and re-establish the supply of oxygen to tissue can lead to increased<br>
tissue damage by increasing free radical production.<br>
In this respect the conventional treatments for subjects exhibiting ischaemia or at<br>
risk of ischaemia are inadequate.<br>
It has been suggested that various substances improve vascular health and function,<br>
and that in populations with a diet high in fruits and vegetables there is a lower incidence<br>
of coronary arterial disease. This effect has been linked to the beneficial effects of<br>
flavonoids, which are polyphenols compounds that are found in both fruits and<br>
vegetables.<br>
Flavonoids are a very large and widespread group of plant derived compounds<br>
which are thought to exhibit a number of biological effects including reducing plasma<br>
levels of low density lipoproteins, inhibiting platelet aggregation, scavenging free radicals<br>
and reducing cell proliferation as well as modulating vascular tone.<br>
A vast number of flavonoids have been identified and differ from one another in<br>
the orientation of the hydroxylation or methylation, the position of the benzenoid<br>
substituent, the degree of unsaturation and the types of substituents attached. The general<br>
three ring structure (A, B and C rings) of many flavonoids are based on the structure of<br>
2-phenyl-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one.<br><br><br>
For example, the synthetic flavonoid, 3',4'-dihydroxy flavonol (DiOHF) has a<br>
hydroxyl group at the 3,3'- and 4' positions and has been demonstrated to reduce infarct<br>
and injury associated with myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion during in vitro studies<br>
(Shen Wang, Gregory Dusting, Clive May and Owen Woodman, British Journal of<br>
Pharmacology (2004) 142,443-452).<br>
However, the pharmacokinetics of many flavonoids has severely limited their<br>
therapeutic usefulness. Synthetic flavonoids tend to be highly lipid soluble molecules and<br>
therefore tend to have poor water solubility leading to a difficulty in administration as a<br>
therapeutic agent. These characteristics limit their applicability to therapies where acute<br>
parenteral administration is desirable, for example in vasodilation therapies.<br>
Given the above identified problems, there remains a need for the development of<br>
synthetic flavonoid derivatives with improved aqueous solubility and pharmacokinetics<br>
when compared to known flavonoids.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention provides flavonoid derivatives and compositions containing<br>
flavonoid derivatives, and methods of using same.<br>
The presence of reactive oxidative species (ROS) in living tissue has been shown to<br>
be associated with many disorders in animals. Reactive oxidative species can contain both<br>
nitrogen and oxygen, or only oxygen atoms. Some examples of ROS molecules include<br>
singlet O2, H2O2, free radicals such as OH-, O2-, NO-, and ROO'. Many of these species<br>
are formed during normal metabolic activity, but their concentration levels can be elevated<br>
under conditions of oxidative stress associated with chronic inflammation, infections and<br>
other diseases.<br>
Many ROS molecules are the result of naturally occurring processes such as<br>
oxygen metabolism and inflammatory processes. For example, when cells use oxygen to<br>
generate energy, free radicals are created as a consequence of ATP production by the<br>
mitochondria. Exercise can increase the levels of free radicals as can environmental<br>
stimuli such as ionizing radiation (from industry, sun exposure, cosmic rays, and medical<br>
X-rays), environmental toxins, altered atmospheric conditions (e.g. hypoxia and<br>
hyperoxia), ozone and nitrogen oxide (primarily from automobile exhaust, therapeutics).<br>
Lifestyle stressors such as cigarette smoking and excessive alcohol consumption are also<br>
known to affect levels of free radicals. Radical species may combine to form other more<br>
damaging or toxic species such as peroxynitrite ONOO-, a product of superoxide and nitric<br>
oxide radical reaction.<br>
Another source of ROS species is some therapeutic agents, such as anti-cancer<br>
drugs. Anthracycline derivatives are highly useful anti-cancer agents in the treatment of<br>
neoplastic diseases such as acute leukemia, malignant lymphoma, etc. However, an<br>
undesirable feature of their administration can be oxidative damage to tissue, which can<br>
lead to cardiomyopathy and possible heart failure. The presence of the therapeutic agent<br>
can therefore cause the development of congestive heart failure (CHF). This feature of<br>
some therapeutic agents can limit their effectiveness and it would be useful to develop an<br>
appropriate co-administration regime.<br><br>
Thus in one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of<br>
preventing and/or at least ameliorating damage to a subject caused by the administration of<br>
a therapeutic agent, the method comprising co-administering to a subject:<br>
i) a therapeutic agent; and<br>
ii) an effective amount of at least one compound in accordance with Formula I,<br>
Formula II, Formula III or Formula IV, wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R8, U, Q,<br>
W, X, Y, Z, n have the same meaning as above, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or<br>
solvates thereof.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing and/or at<br>
least ameliorating UV damage to the skin of a subject, comprising administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the invention. With this aspect,<br>
preferably the composition is formulated into a sunscreen. The composition may be<br>
topically applied to the skin. The composition may contain emollients and moisturisers.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of preventing and/or<br>
reversing the effects of ageing, of reducing apparent wrinkling and or/or treating or<br>
preventing dry skin.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a method of treating a subject<br>
having a disease or disorder involving oxidative damage, comprising administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of the composition of the invention.<br>
Preferably, the disease or disorder involving oxidative damage is selected from the<br>
group consisting of cancer, heart disease, neurological disorders, auto-immune disorders,<br>
ischaemia-reperfusion injury, diabetic complications, septic shock, hepatitis,<br>
atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and complications arising from HIV or Hepatitis,<br>
including Hepatitis B.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a<br>
In a particular embodiment, the subject is an animal. The animal may be selected<br>
from the group consisting of humans, non-human primates, cattle, horses, pigs, sheep,<br>
goats, dogs, cats, birds, chickens or other poultry, ducks, geese, pheasants, turkeys, quails,<br>
guinea pigs, rabbits, hamsters, rats and mice.<br>
In some aspects of the invention, the one or more flavonoid derivatives are<br>
administered simultaneously, separately or sequentially with the one or more therapeutic<br>
agent(s).<br>
When used in such a combination the one or more therapeutic agent(s) and the one<br>
or more flavonoid derivative(s) according to the present invention can be administered as<br>
separate agents at the same or different times or they can be formulated as a single<br>
composition comprising both compounds.<br><br>
Free radicals react with key organic substrates in cells such as lipids, proteins, and<br>
DNA. Oxidation of these biomolecules can damage them, disturbing normal functions and<br>
may contribute to a variety of disease states. It has been noted that certain organ systems<br>
are predisposed to greater levels of oxidative stress or nitrosative stress. Those organ<br>
systems most susceptible to damage are the pulmonary system (exposed to high levels of<br>
oxygen), the brain (exhibits intense metabolic activity yet has lower levels of endogenous<br>
antioxidants), the eye (constantly exposed to damaging UV light), circulatory system<br>
(victim to fluctuating oxygen and nitric oxide levels) and reproductive systems (at risk<br>
from the intense metabolic activity of sperm cells).<br>
Examples of relevant acute disorders causing the production of ROS include<br>
ischaemia reperfusion, stroke, myocardial infarction or mechanical trauma, such as a crush<br>
injury or surgery. Some forms of surgery such as heart bypass or transplant surgery<br>
necessarily cause ischaemia and reperfusion of tissue. Typically one or more flavonoid<br>
derivatives according to the present invention are administered to the subject before and/or<br>
during surgery.<br>
Chronic disorders may be chosen from the group including cancer, cerebrovascular<br>
disease, atherosclerosis, artery disease including coronary disease, peripheral vascular<br>
disease (including damage caused by diseases such as diabetes), hypertension, pulmonary<br>
hypertension, chronic obstructive airways disease, emphysema, neurological disorders,<br>
auto-immune disorders, diabetic complications, septic and hypovolemic shock, burns,<br>
hepatitis, and complications arising from hepatitis and HIV. Another chronic disorder may<br>
be chosen from the complications resulting from administration of hyperbaric or high<br>
oxygen tension atmospheres, often applied to assist breathing particularly in a premature<br>
infant human, including retinal or other eye damage. Subjects at risk of relevant chronic<br>
disorders may be diagnosed by analysis of symptoms, diagnostic testing, enzymatic<br>
markers, or by genetic testing to identify a genetic predisposition. Predisposition to certain<br>
acute disorders such as heart attack or stroke may also be identified by genetic testing and<br>
may prompt the prophylactic application of one or more flavonoid derivatives to the<br>
subject at risk. Drug-induced disorders due to ROS eg drug induced congestive heart<br>
disease.<br>
If the disease or disorder is stroke or risk or stroke, the composition described<br>
above is preferably administered before the stroke occurs as a prophylactic to reduce the<br>
risk of stroke occurrence, or within twelve hours (preferably within four hours) of stroke<br>
occuance.<br>
An example of an ROS involved pathological condition is ischaemia where a<br>
deficiency of blood flow to part of a body results in inadequate tissue perfusion with<br><br>
oxygen. Ischaemia causes tissue damage, the severity of the damage depending on the<br>
length of time the tissue is deprived of oxygen and whether adequate reperfusion of<br>
oxygen occurs after the ischaemic event.<br>
At least one compound in accordance with the present invention may be<br>
administered via a number of different routes, for example, topically, orally, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intra-arterially and/or intravenously.<br>
Compound Synthesis<br>
The present invention provides flavonoid compounds according to Formula I, II, III<br>
or IV, V and methods of synthesizing such compounds.<br>
Derivatives of Flavonoids<br>
Flavonoid phosphate derivatives are produced by a selective protection /<br>
deprotection synthetic strategy.<br>
3-Hvdroxvflavone-3-phosphate disodium salt (5)<br>
With reference to Figure 1 the approach to the synthesis of 3-hydroxyfiavone-3-<br>
phosphate disodium salt is shown. 3-Hydroxyflavone (1) underwent phosphitylation when<br>
treated with dibenzyl N,N-diisopropylphosphoramidite and the intermediate phosphate<br>
was directly oxidised by m-chloroperbenzoic acid (mCPBA) to its corresponding protected<br>
phosphate. The phosphate ester was purified by flash chromatography followed by<br>
recrystallization, yield 45%.<br>
The phosphate ester underwent hydrogenolysis in ethanol with palladium<br>
hydroxide to form the phosphate, which was immediately converted to its disodium salt by<br>
addition of a slight excess of 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution. Deprotection by<br>
hydrogenolysis provided a pure sample of 3-hydroxyflavone-3-phosphate disodium salt in<br>
a 73% yield.<br>
The corresponding diammonium salt was produced by ion exchange<br>
chromatography using a diethylaminoethyl column (DEAE) of (5).<br>
3',4'-Dihvdroxyflavone-3-phosphate fas disodium salt) (10)<br>
An identical procedure was implemented for the synthesis of the trihydroxyflavone<br>
analogue as shown in Figure 2.<br>
Thus 3',4'-dibenzyloxy-3-hydroxyflavone (6) underwent phosphitylation by<br>
diisopropyl N,N-dibenzyloxyphosphoramidite in the presence of 1H-tetrazole to form the<br>
3,4-dibenzyloxy-flavone-3-phosphite dibenzyloxy ester (7), which was oxidized by<br><br>
mCPBA to the protected phosphate ester, 3',4'-dibenzyloxy-flavone-3-phosphate<br>
dibenzyloxy ester (8) . These two steps produced the desired compound in a 40% yield<br>
after recrystallisation.<br>
The phosphate ester was then subjected to hydrogenolysis in ethanol with<br>
palladium to form the desired 3',3'-dihydroxyl-flavone-3-phosphate (9) which was<br>
converted to the corresponding disodium salt, 3',4'-dihydroxyl-flavone-3-phosphate<br>
disodium salt (10) by addition of NaOH.<br>
Ester Derivatives of Flavonoids<br>
3-Hvdroxyflavone-3-hemisuccinate (15)<br>
3-Hydroxyflavone-3-hemisuccinate (15) was produced according to the reaction<br>
outlined in Figure 3. Reaction of succinic anhydride (11) and benzyl alcohol (12) in the<br>
presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) and pyridine in dichloromethane produced<br>
the succinic acid monobenzyl ester (13) as white crystalline flakes in 77% yield. This<br>
protected succinic acid derivative was coupled to 3-hydroxyflavone (1) in the presence of<br>
DCC and DMAP, forming flavone-3-hemisuccinate monobenzyl ester (14) as yellow or<br>
brown oil that solidified upon standing, with yields of up to 96% produced.<br>
The deprotection of the monobenzyl ester to form the corresponding hemisuccinate<br>
using a Pd(OAc)2 in the THF:EtOH:acetic acid solvent system, a larger scale reaction was<br>
undertaken to yield the required 3-hydroxyflavone-3-hemisuccinate (15).<br>
3-Hydroxvflavone-3-hemiadivate (19)<br>
3-Hydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (19) was synthesized following a similar<br>
procedure to that discussed above for the hemisuccinate, as shown in Figure 4.<br>
Adipic acid monobenzyl ester (17) was produced from adipic acid and benzyl<br>
alcohol in the presence of p-TsOH to yield the desired product as a colourless oil in 34%<br>
yield.<br>
The protected adipic acid then underwent a DCC coupling with 3-hydroxyflavone<br>
(1) to form flavone-3-hemiadipate monobenzyl ester as a yellow/brown gum in 59% yield.<br>
Hydrogenation of this compound in the presence of Pd(OH)2 catalyst, using a THF-based<br>
solvent system (9:1 THF:EtOH + 0.05% acetic acid) resulted in hydrogenolysis of the<br>
monobenzyl ester, forming flavone-3-hemiadipate as a yellow solid in 89% yield.<br>
3', 4 '-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (21)<br>
The scheme for the synthesis of 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone-3- hemiadipate (21) is<br>
illustrated in Figure 5. Following the methodology established above, 3',4'-dibenzyloxy-<br><br>
3-hydroxyflavone (6) and adipic acid monbenzyl ester (17) underwent a DCC coupling to<br>
produce the hemiadipate monobenzyl ester as a brown gum in 59% yield.<br>
Deprotection by hydrogenolysis on a small scale (100-500 mg) proceeded smoothly<br>
to completion in 3-5 hours to give the 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (21) in 33%<br>
yield.<br>
III	Compositions and Methods<br>
The compounds of this invention can be formulated in a variety of carriers and<br>
delivery systems. The amount of the therapeutic compound to be administered and the<br>
compound's concentration is dependent on the vehicle or device selected, the clinical<br>
condition of the patient, the side effects and the stability of the compound in the<br>
formulation. Thus, the physician employs the appropriate preparation containing the<br>
appropriate concentration of the therapeutic compound and selects the amount of<br>
formulation administered, depending upon clinical experience with the patient in question<br>
or with similar patients.<br>
Furthermore, excipients can be included in the formulation. Examples include co-<br>
solvents, surfactants, oils, humectants, emollients, preservatives, stabilizers and<br>
antioxidants. Any pharmacologically acceptable buffer may be used, e.g., Tris or<br>
phosphate buffers. Effective amounts of diluents, additives and excipients are those<br>
amounts which are effective to obtain a pharmaceutically acceptable formulation in terms<br>
of solubility, biological activity, etc.<br>
Thus, a composition of the invention includes a therapeutic compound which can<br>
be formulated with conventiona1, pharmaceutically acceptable, vehicles for topica1, oral or<br>
parenteral administration. Formulations can also include small amounts of adjuvants such<br>
as buffers and preservatives to maintain isotonicity, physiological and pH stability.<br>

formulated with stabilizing agents, for example metal chelator reducing agents such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) or a reducing agent such as sodium metabisufite.<br>
Appropriate formulations for parenteral use are apparent to the practitioner of<br>
ordinary skill. Usually, the therapeutic compound is prepared in an aqueous solution in a<br>
concentration of from about 1 to about 100 mg/mL. More typically, the concentration is<br>
from about 10 to 60 mg/mL or about 20 mg/mL. Concentrations below 1 mg/mL may be<br>
necessary in some cases depending on the solubility and potency of the compound selected<br>
for use. The formulation, which is sterile, is suitable for various parenteral routes<br>
including intra-derma1, intra-articular, intramuscular, intravascular, intravenous, inhalation<br>
and subcutaneous.<br>
Compositions according to the present invention may be formulated into<br>
sunscreens, skin care compositions, emollient of moisturizers.<br>
Slow or extended-release delivery systems, including any of a number of<br>
biopolymers (biological-based systems), systems employing liposomes, and polymeric<br>
delivery systems, for example dendrimers, can be utilized with the compositions described<br>
herein to provide a continuous or long term source of therapeutic compound. Such slow<br>
release systems are applicable to formulations for topica1, ophthalmic, ora1, and parenteral<br>
use.<br>
The synthetic flavonoid compound(s) of the present invention may also be<br>
formulated as a nutrapharmaceutical or a nutraceutical. For example, the synthetic<br>
flavonoid compound(s) may be formulated into a food, such as a cerea1, beverages such as<br>
fruit juice, alcoholic drinks, bread, etc, for oral consumption.<br><br>
V	Vasorelaxant and Antioxidant Activity of Flavonoid Derivatives<br>
The effects of vehicle, flavone-3-hemiadipate (10"8 to 10-4 M) and DiOHF (10-4 M)<br>
on the level of superoxide anions generated in rat aorta in the presence of NADPH were<br>
determined and expressed as a percentage of control. The presence of the flavone-3 -<br>
hemiadipate appeared to have no effect on the superoxide production at any concentration.<br>
With reference to Figure 6, the effects of vehicle, Flavone-3-hemiadipate (F3HA),<br>
in the presence and absence of butyryl cholinesterase (BuCHE, 1000 U/L) and DiOHF<br>
(10-4 M) on the level of superoxide anions generated in rat aorta in the presence of<br>
NADPH expressed as a percentage of control is illustrated. In the absence of the esterase<br>
there appears to be no effect on the superoxide production. The presence of cholinesterase<br>
reveals a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect of flavone-3-hemiadipate. This is<br>
consistent with the hemiadipate group being removed in vitro to form the free hydroxyl<br>
derivative, 3-hydroxy flavone. The suppression of superoxide production by inclusion of<br>
both the flavone-3-hemiadipate (19) and esterase compares favourably to the activity of<br>
DiOHF (3',4'-dihydroxy flavonol). A reduction in the superoxide and other ROS<br>
concentrations has been linked to a possible reduction in myocardial damage induced by<br>
the presence of these radicals.<br>
The concentration response curves to Ca2+ in the presence of vehicle or increasing<br>
concentrations of flavone-3-hemiadipate (15) (F3HA, 10-8 M - 10-4 M) in endothelium<br>
intact aortic rings isolated from rats was determined. At the lower concentrations (10" to<br>
10"5 M), the flavone-3-hemiadipate did not effect Ca2+ contraction of the aortic ring. At<br>
the higher level tested, 10-4 M, the flavone-3-hemiadipate has some inhibitory effect, most<br>
likely due to the presence of an esterase in the aortic tissue of the rat.<br>
The effects of vehicle (dH2O), 3,,4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (21)<br>
(DiOHF3HA, 10-8M - 10-4 M) and DiOHF (10-4 M) on the level of superoxide anions<br>
generated in rat aorta in the presence of NADPH expressed as a percentage of control.<br>
The superoxide concentration remained constant throughout the DiOHF3HA<br>
concentration range studied, thus DiOHF3HA had no effect on superoxide generation.<br>
Referring to Figure 7, the effects of vehicle, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate<br>
(21) (DiOHF3HA, 10-6 M - 10-4 M) in the presence and absence of butyryl cholinesterase<br>
(BuCHE, 1000 U/L) on the level of superoxide anions generated in rat aorta in the<br>
presence of NADPH expressed as a percentage of control is illustrated. For comparison<br>
the results using DiOHF (10-4 M) on the level of superoxide anions generated in rat aorta<br>
in the presence of NADPH expressed as a percentage of control are also shown. The<br><br>
presence of the cholinesterase revealed a concentration dependent inhibition of superoxide<br>
levels.<br>
The concentration response curves to Ca2+ in the presence of vehicle or increasing<br>
concentrations of 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (21) (DiOHF3HA, 10"6 M - 10-4<br>
M) in endothelium intact aortic rings isolated from rats. The contractions are expressed as<br>
a percentage of the initial response to Ca2+ (3x10-3 M) observed before treatment with<br>
DiOHF3HA. DiOHF3HA appears to have slight Ca2+ inhibitory action at 10-4 M. This<br>
effect is possibly due to the presence of some esterase in the aortic tissue of the rat.<br>
Turning to Figure 8, the concentration response curves to Ca2+ in the presence of<br>
vehicle or 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (21) (DiOHF3HA, 10-4 M), in the<br>
presence and absence of BuCHE was compared to DiOHF in endothelium intact aortic<br>
rings isolated from rats is illustrated. The contractions are expressed as a percentage of<br>
the initial response to Ca2+ (3x10-3 M) observed before treatment with DiOHF3HA. The<br>
presence of cholinesterase markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of DiOHF3HA.<br>
Referring to Figure 9, the effects of vehicle, flavone-3-phosphate (F3P, 10" M-10<br>
M) in the presence phosphatase (1000 U/L) and DiOHF (10-4 M) on the level of<br>
superoxide anions generated in rat aorta in the presence of NADPH expressed as a<br>
percentage of control. The presence of the flavone-3-phosphate caused a concentration<br>
dependent decrease in the levels of superoxide. This effect is contrary to previous studies<br>
that have shown that the presence of the 3',4'-dihydroxyl group in the B ring is<br>
determinative in decreasing the levels of superoxide.<br>
The concentration response curves to Ca2+ in the presence of vehicle or increasing<br>
concentrations of flavone-3-phosphate (F3P, 10"6 M - 10-4 M) in endothelium intact aortic<br>
rings isolated from rats was determined. Flavone-3-phosphate caused partial inhibition of<br>
the calcium-induced contraction at the highest concentration.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the concentration response curves to Ca2+ in the presence of<br>
vehicle or flavone-3-phosphate (F3P, 10-8 M-10-4 M) in the presence and absence of<br>
phosphatase (P, 1000 U/L) in endothelium intact aortic rings isolated from rats is shown.<br>
The contractions are expressed as a percentage of the initial response to Ca2+ (3xl0"3 M)<br>
observed before treatment with flavone-3-phosphate. The presence of phosphatase<br>
markedly enhanced the inhibitory effects of flavone-3-phosphate.<br>

Vasorelaxant and Antioxidant Activity of Flavonoid Derivatives<br>
Effect ofFlavonoid Derivatives on Ca2-Induced Contraction<br>
To determine the effect of flavonoids on responses to the influx of extracellular<br>
Ca2+, contractile responses to exogenous application of Ca2+ were examined in the<br>
presence of flavonoids in Ca2+-free high-K+ solution (60 mM, KPSS). Aortic rings were<br>
initially equilibrated at a resting tension of 1 g in normal Ca2+-free PSS for 45 minutes.<br>
The bath medium was then replaced with Ca2+-free KPSS for 45 minutes to determine a<br>
reference contraction to Ca2+ (3 x 10'3 M). Following a 30 minute re-equilibration period<br>
with Ca2+-free PSS, the cumulative contractile responses to Ca2+ (10"5 — 3 x 10"3 M) were<br>
determined in KPSS in the presence of a range of concentrations (10" - 10 M) of<br>
vehicle, 3',4'-dihydroxyflavono1, 3-hydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate, 3',4'-dihydroxy-3-<br>
hemiadipate, 3 -hydroxyflavone-3 -phosphate. A 20 minute incubation period was allowed<br>
for the flavonoids before examining the responses to Ca2+.<br>
Relaxation by Flavonoid Derivatives<br>
Following testing of endothelial integrity, rings were repeatedly washed and re-<br>
equilibrated for 30 minutes before the addition of PE (10 - 2 x 10" M) and 9,11-dideoxy-<br>
9a, 1 la-epoxymethano-prostaglandin F2a (U46619, 10"9 - 10"8 M) to produce an active<br>
force in the range of 40-60% of KPSS-induced contraction. The level of precontraction<br>
was matched between the various groups by adjusting the concentrations of PE and<br>
U46619. Cumulative concentration-response curves in the range 10"° - 1(T M were<br>
conducted for 3',4'-dihydroxyflavono1, 3-hydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate, 3',4'-dihydroxy-<br>
3-hemiadipate, 3-hydroxyflavone-3-phosphate.<br><br>
Experiments were conducted in the presence of an esterase, butyryl cholinesterase<br>
(BuCHE, 1000 U/L) for the hemiadipate derivates and a phosphatase (1000 U/L) in the<br>
case of the phosphate derivatives.<br>
Effects ofFlavonoid Derivatives on Superoxide Levels in an In Vitro Assay<br>
Superoxide anion production in rat isolated aortic segments was determined using<br>
lucigenin chemiluminescence. Aortic rings were prepared as described above and then<br>
placed in ice-cold Krebs-(N-[2-Hydroxyethyl]piperazine-N'-[2-ethanesulfonic acid]<br>
(HEPES buffer) (composition (mM); NaCl 99.0, KC1 4.7, KH2P04 1.0, MgSO4.7H20 1.2,<br>
D-glucose 11.0, NaHCO3 25.0, CaCl2.2H20 2.5, Na-HEPES 20.0).<br>
Aortic rings were pre-incubated for 45 minutes at 37°C with a pH 7.4, in Krebs-HEPES<br>
buffer containing diethylthiocarbamic acid (DETCA, 10" M) to inactivate superoxide<br>
dismutase and p-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH, 10-4 M) as a<br>
substrate for NADPH oxidase and either 3',4'-dihydroxyflavonol (10-4 M) as a positive<br>
contro1, vehicle, 3-hydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate, 3',4'-dihydroxy-3-hemiadipate, 3-<br>
hydroxyflavone-3-phosphate (10"8 - 10-4 M). Background photon emission was measured<br>
for 12 cycles in a 96-well Optiplate containing o.3 ml per well of Krebs-HEPES buffer<br>
together with lucigenin (5 x 10"5 M) and vehicle or flavonoid (10"8 - 10-4 M). Each cycle<br>
was counted every one minute. After background reading was completed the incubated<br>
aortic rings were transferred to the appropriate wells and photon emission was recounted<br>
as described above. The tissue was then placed in a 65 °C oven for 48 hours to allow<br>
superoxide production to be normalised to dry tissue weight.<br>
Effects ofFlavonoid Derivatives on Superoxide Levels in an In Vitro Assay in the presence<br>
or absence of an Esterase<br>
The effects of vehicle, 3,,4"-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (21) (DiOHF3HA, 10"<br>
8 M - 10-4 M) and DiOHF (10-4 M) in the presence and absence of Butyryl cholinesterase<br>
(BuCHE), 100, 300 and 1000 U/L) on the level of superoxide anions generated in rat<br>
isolated aortic segments in the presence of NADPH was expressed as a percentage of<br>
control. The method used was as described above except for the addition of the butyryl<br>
cholinesterase.<br>
Effects of Flavonoid Derivatives on Superoxide Levels in an In Vitro Assay in the presence<br>
or absence of a phosphatase<br>
The effect of vehicle, 3-hydroxyflavone-3-phosphate (10"8 to 10-4 M) in the<br>
presence or absence of phosphatase (1000 U/L) on the level of superoxide anions<br>
generated in rat aorta in the presence of NADPH expressed as a percentage of control was<br>
determined as described above for the 3',4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate. A<br><br>
measurable effect on the superoxide anion generation was observed using the<br>
3-hydroxyflavone-3-phosphate in the absence of the phosphatase. This was thought to<br>
occur due to the presence of natural phosphatases in the isolated rat tissue.<br>
In vivo study of the Effects of Flavonoid Derivatives on the vascular function of a rat<br>
A unit dosage of an aqueous solution of 3-hydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate (15) was<br>
administered to a group of male anesthetized Sprague Dawley rats intravenously and the<br>
blood pressure monitored over a period of time.<br>
A significant reduction in the blood pressure of rats was observed which is<br>
indicative of the in vivo vasorelaxation caused by the flavonoid derivative. No effect was<br>
observed when an aqueous solution was administered to a second group of rats.<br>
The experiment was repeated with aqueous solutions of the other synthesized<br>
flavonoid derivatives which also resulted in distinct reductions in the blood pressures of<br>
the rats.<br>
Screening for Activity and Pharmacokinetics<br>
Preparation of rat aorta<br>
The descending thoracic aorta from rats was rapidly dissected and placed in Krebs-<br>
bicarbonate solution. Superficial connective tissue and fat surrounding the aorta was<br>
removed and the aorta was cut into segments of 2-3 mm length and mounted in organ<br>
baths.<br>
Effect ofFlavonoids on ACh and SNP relaxation<br>
After wash out and re-equilibration for 30 min, the aortic rings were then<br>
submaximally precontracted with PE and U46619, which were used to produce an active<br>
tension of 45-60% of the KPSS-induced maximum contraction. When investigating the<br>
effects of the flavonoids, flavono1, flavone-3-hemiadipate (F3HA), 3', 4'-<br>
dihydroxyflavone, 3', 4'-dihydroxyflavono1, 3', 4'-dihydroxyflavone-3-hemiadipate<br>
(DiOHF3HA), and flavone-3- phosphate (F3P) on vasorelaxant responses, rings were<br>
incubated with one of the compounds for 20 mins before they were precontracted<br>
submaximally, followed by a cumulative-concentration response curve to ACh (100 nM -<br>
10 uM) or SNP (10 pM -1 uM). In experiments using F3P 1000U/L phosphatase was used<br>
in some experiments to cleave the phosphate. Some experiments were conducted in the<br>
presence and absence of butyryl cholinesterase (BuCHE, 1000U/L) to cleave the adipate in<br>
DiOHF3HA and F3HA.<br><br>
Effect ofFlavonols and Flavones on PE-Induced Contraction<br>
Rings were incubated for 20 minutes with DiOHF3HA at a range of concentrations<br>
(10"7- 10-4M) or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulphoxide, DMSO). A concentration response<br>
curve to PE (10'9 -10'5 M) in endothelium-intact (EI) aortic rings was then performed.<br>
Experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of BuCHE (1000U/L) to cleave<br>
the adipate in DiOHF3HA.<br>
Effect ofFlavonols on Ca -Induced Contraction<br>
To determine the effect of flavonoids on responses to the influx of extracellular<br>
Ca , contractile responses to exogenous application of Ca were examined in the<br>
presence of flavonoids in Ca2+ - free high-K+ solution (60 mM, K+-PSS). Aortic rings<br>
were initially equilibrated at a resting tension of 1 g in Ca -free PSS for 45 minutes. The<br>
bath medium was then replaced with Ca2+- free K+-PSS for 45 minutes to determine a<br>
reference contraction to added Ca2+ (3 mM). Following a 30 minute re-equilibration<br>
period with Ca2+-free PSS, the cumulative contractile responses to Ca2+ (10"5 - 3 x 10"3 M)<br>
were determined in K+ PSS in the presence of vehicle (0.1% DMSO), or a range of<br>
concentrations (10"7 - 10-4 M) of 3'-hydroxyflavono1, F3HA, DiOHF3HA or F3P. A 20<br>
minute incubation period was allowed for the flavonoids before examining the responses<br>
to Ca . Experiments were conducted in the presence and absence of BuCHE (1000U/L) to<br>
cleave the adipate in F3HA and DiOHF3HA. In experiments using F3P, phosphatase<br>
(1000U/L) was used in some experiments to cleave the phosphate.<br>
Relaxation by Flavonoids<br>
Following testing of endothelial integrity, rings were repeatedly washed and re-<br>
equilibrated for 30 minutes before the addition of PE (10"8 - 2 x 10"7 M) and 9,11-dideoxy-<br>
9a, 1 la- epoxymethano-prostaglandin F2a (U46619,10"9 - 10"8 M) to produce an active<br>
force in the range of 40 - 60% of KPSS-induced contraction. Cumulative concentration-<br>
response curves in the range 10'7 - 10*4 M were conducted for vehicle, 3'-<br>
hydroxyflavono1, F3HA, DiOHF3HA, F3P. Experiments were conducted in the presence<br>
and absence of 1000U/L BuCHE to cleave the adipate in F3HA and DiOHF3HA. In<br>
experiments using F3P 1000U/L phosphatase was used in some experiments to cleave the<br>
phosphate.<br><br>
Effect ofFlavonols and Flavones on Vasorelaxation to ACh in the Presence of Oxidative<br>
Stress<br>
Control cumulative relaxation responses to ACh were compared with those obtained<br>
from endothelium-intact aortic rings treated with pyrogallol (2 x 10"5 M). The effects of<br>
vehicle (0.1% DMSO), phosphatase (1000U/L) or F3P (lO^-lO-4 M) on responses to ACh<br>
in the rat isolated aortic rings exposed to pyrogallol (2 x 10"5 M) were also determined.<br>
Pyrogallol was added when the aortic rings had reached a stable level of contraction with<br>
PE and U44619 at a level between 50 and 70% of KPSS-induced tension and 10 minutes<br>
was allowed before determining the cumulative concentration-response curves to ACh. In<br>
some experiments using F3P 1000U/L phosphatase was used to cleave the phosphate.<br>
Effect of DiOHF3HA and F3P in anesthetized rats<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-350 g) were anaesthetised with pentobarbitone<br>
sodium (60 mg kg"1, ip). The trachea was isolated and cannulated with polyethylene<br>
tracheal tube (I.D. 2.0 mm), and the rat was allowed to breathe spontaneously.<br>
Measurements of arterial pressure and heart rate<br>
The right carotid artery was cannulated and connected with a heparinised saline<br>
filled cannula (O.D. 0.75, I.D. 0.58 mm) and connected to a pressure transducer. Mean and<br>
phasic arterial pressure were continuously measured and recorded on a polygraph. The<br>
heart rate was derived from the phasic arterial pressure using a tachometer.<br>
Antioxidant and vascular effects of flavonol and dihydroxyflavone<br>
Flavonol and dihydroxyflavone (DiOHFne) caused concentration dependent<br>
decreases in superoxide levels generated by rat aortic rings. At the highest concentration<br>
tested (0.1 mM) flavonol and DiOHFne both reduced the superoxide levels to 36±3% of<br>
control. Flavonol did not affect the relaxant effects of ACh or SNP. DiOHFne caused<br>
concentration-dependent relaxation of rat aorta which was weaker than the effect of<br>
DiOHF. Flavonol caused concentration dependent decreases in calcium-induced<br>
contraction of rat aortic rings which were relatively weak in comparison to previous<br>
observations with DiOHF.<br><br>
Antioxidant and vascular effects offlavone-3-hemiadipate (F3HA)<br>
F3HA (10"7 M-10-4 M) had no inhibitory effect on superoxide generation by rat aorta<br>
but the presence of butyryl cholinesterase (BuCHE, 100-1000 U/ml) caused a<br>
concentration dependent increase in the inhibitory effect of F3HA (Figure 6). F3HA only<br>
inhibited contractile responses to increasing concentrations of extracellular calcium at the<br>
highest concentration tested (0.1 mM).<br>
Antioxidant and vascular effects ofdihydroxy flavone-3-hemiadipate (DiOHF3HA)<br>
DiOHF3HA (10-4M-10-4M) had no inhibitory effect on superoxide generation by rat<br>
aorta but the presence of butyryl cholinesterase (BuCHE, 1000 U/ml) revealed a<br>
concentration dependent inhibitory effect. DiOHF3HA alone had no effect on relaxant<br>
responses to ACh or SNP. In contrast, in the presence of BuCHE (1000 U/ml) DiOHF3HA<br>
significantly increased the sensitivity of the relaxant response to SNP. Similarly<br>
DiOHF3HA alone had little effect on calcium-induced contraction of rat aorta, but in the<br>
presence of BuCHE (1000 U/ml) DiOHF3HA (0.1 mM) had an equivalent inhibitory<br>
effect to DiOHF. This suggests that when the adipate was removed by the esterase the<br>
hemiadipate was equally active to the parent DiOHF. DiOHF3HA was also found to cause<br>
direct relaxation of pre-contracted rat aortic rings only in the presence of the esterase<br>
(Figure 11).<br>
DiOHF3HA (0.1, 0.3,1,3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously, allowing at least 30<br>
min between injections, and the peak changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate<br>
measured. DiOHF3HA caused dose-dependent decreases in arterial pressure (Figure 12a)<br>
and heart rate (Figure 12b). In a separate group of experiments ACh (0.3 mg/kg iv) and<br>
phenylephrine (PE, 30 mg/kg iv) were injected before and 30 minutes after DiOHF3HA (3<br>
mg/kg iv), a time when arterial pressure and heart rate had returned to control levels.<br>
DiOHF3HA significantly enhanced the depressor response to ACh and attenuated the PE-<br>
induced increase in arterial pressure (Figure 13).<br>
In rat aortic rings DiOHF3HA (0.1 mM), in the absence or presence of<br>
cholinesterase, had no effect on endothelium-dependent relaxation in response to the<br>
calcium ionophore A23187 or to isoprenaline. DiOHF3HA (0.1 mM) given alone had no<br>
effect on PE-induced contraction but caused marked inhibition in the presence of esterase.<br><br>
The level of inhibition was similar to that observed in response to the presence of the same<br>
concentration (0.1 mM) of DiOHF.<br>
Antioxidant and vascular effects of flavone-3-phosphate (F3P)<br>
F3P or phosphatase (1000 U/l) had no effect on superoxide generation by rat aortic<br>
segments whereas F3P caused a concentration -dependent inhibition of superoxide levels<br>
in the presence of phosphatase. F3P, in the presence of phosphatase, increased the<br>
sensitivity of rat aortic rings to relaxation by ACh but not SNP. Oxidant stress, caused by<br>
the presence of pyrogallol (2xl0"5 M), significantly reduced the maximum response to<br>
ACh but the response was restored by the presence of F3P plus phosphatase. Responses to<br>
SNP were unaffected by any of those treatments. F3P caused a small inhibition of<br>
calcium-induced contraction but the effect was significantly enhanced by the presence of<br>
phosphatase.<br>
F3P (0.1, 0.3, 1,3, 10 mg/kg) was injected intravenously, allowing at least 30<br>
minutes between injections, and the peak changes in mean arterial pressure and heart rate<br>
measured (Figure 16a). DiOHF3HA caused dose-dependent decreases in arterial pressure<br>
and heart rate (Figure 12 a and 12b) but the depressor response was small compared to<br>
DiOHF (1 mg/kg iv).<br>
Summary<br>
These studies involved an assessment of the vascular and antioxidant activity of<br>
flavonols, 3', 4'-dihydroxyflavone (DiOHFne), 3', 4'-dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF),<br>
flavone-3- hemiadipate (F3HA), 3', 4'-dihydroxy flavone-3-hemiadipate (DiOHF3HA)<br>
and flavone-3-phosphate.<br>
Flavone-3-hemiadipate (F3HA) alone had no antioxidant or vascular activity when<br>
applied alone but the presence of a cholinesterase to cleave the adipate substitution<br>
revealed the ability of F3HA to inhibit calcium-induced contraction.<br>
Dihydroxy flavone-3-hemiadipate (DiOHF3HA) had no antioxidant or vascular<br>
activity when applied alone but the presence of a cholinesterase to cleave the adipate<br>
substitution revealed the ability of DiOHF3HA to inhibit superoxide levels produced by<br>
rat aorta, to inhibit calcium-induced contraction and to cause direct relaxation of rat aortic<br>
rings. In the presence of the esterase the level of activity of DiOHF3HA was similar to<br>
DiOHF. In the anaesthetized rat DiOHF3HA caused concentration dependent decreases in<br>
arterial pressure and heart rate.<br><br>
Flavone-3-phosphate (F3P) alone had no antioxidant or vascular activity but the<br>
presence of a phosphatase to cleave the phosphate substitution revealed the ability of F3P<br>
to inhibit superoxide levels produced by rat aorta, to inhibit calcium-induced contraction<br>
and to enhance endothelium-dependent relaxation in the presence of oxidant stress. In the<br>
presence of the phosphatase the level of activity of F3P was similar to DiOHF. In the<br>
anaesthetized rat F3P caused only small concentration dependent decreases in arterial<br>
pressure and heart rate. The effects were much smaller than seen with DiOHF.<br>
Cardioprotective of 3\4'-dihydroxy flavonol adipate (DiOHF3HA) following<br>
myocardial ischaemia reperfusion<br>
The ability of the synthetic flavono1, 3',4' dihydroxy flavonol adipate<br>
(DiOHF3HA) to prevent myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion injury in anaesthetised<br>
sheep was assessed. Unlike the parent compound DiOHF, the adipate derivative was<br>
soluble in aqueous solution, particularly water.<br>
DiOHF3HA administered in aqueous solution caused a dose-related reduction in<br>
infarct size, which was similar to that caused by a similar molar dose of DiOHF when<br>
dissolved in DMSO.<br>
Intravenous DiOHF3HA infusion did not alter haemodynamic indices (arterial<br>
blood pressure, heart rate, left ventricular-end diastolic pressure (LV-EDP).<br>
Since DiOHF3HA caused an equivalent degree of cardioprotection to the parent<br>
compound following cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion injury in anaesthetised sheep, these<br>
data support the hypothesis that this novel derivative compound is effectively converted to<br>
the parent compound in vivo.<br>
Surgical Preparation<br>
Five groups of anaesthetised adult merino sheep (35-45 kg wethers) were<br>
examined:<br>
(1)	Control (n=5)<br>
(2)	DiOHF (2 mg/kg, n=2)<br>
(3)	DiOHF3HA (2.7 mg/kg, n=3)<br>
(4)	DiOHF (5 mg/kg, n=3)<br>
(5)	DiOHF3HA (6.6 mg/kg, n=4).<br>
Anaesthesia was induced by intravenous thiopentone sodium (15 mg/kg) and<br>
following tracheal intubation was maintained by isoflurane (1.5-2%). A catheter was<br>
inserted in the right facial artery for arterial blood sampling and monitoring arterial<br>
pressure. Intravenous infusions were made via a catheter inserted into the jugular vein.<br><br>
The heart was exposed through a left thoracotomy performed at the fourth intercostal<br>
space. A 4F catheter-tipped manometer was inserted through the left atrium into the left<br>
ventricle to measure left ventricular pressure (LVP). An additional silastic cannula was<br>
inserted into the left atrial appendage for the injection of lignocaine and for infusion of<br>
Evans Blue. The left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was dissected from the<br>
epicardium immediately distal to its second diagonal branch, and a transit-time 2 mm flow<br>
probe was placed around it to monitor the LAD blood flow. A silk suture was passed<br>
under the LAD proximal to the probe and both ends of the silk were threaded through a<br>
plastic tube to form a vascular snare.<br>
Experimental Design<br>
The animals were allowed to stabilise for 10-15 minutes after the completion of the<br>
surgical procedure. Sheep were then randomly divided into different treatment groups. All<br>
sheep had 30 minute baseline recording followed by 1 hour ischaemia and 3 hours<br>
reperfusion.<br>
During the course of the experiment, haemodynamic measurements were recorded<br>
at 5 minute intervals and blood samples were taken at designated time-points. After 30<br>
minutes of ischaemia, flavonol treatment was administered. DiOHF was dissolved in 2 ml<br>
DMSO plus 14 ml polyethylene glycol:water (1:1). DiOHF3HA was dissolved in 20 ml<br>
0.1M Na2CO3. The drugs were given at 1 ml/min i.v.. The two doses of DiOHF3HA (2.7<br>
mg/kg and 6.6 mg/kg) were chosen to achieve equivalent molar doses to the parent DiOHF<br>
compound (at 2 mg/kg and 5 mg/kg, respectively). Control animals did not receive any<br>
intravenous solutions. Lignocaine was used, as required, to ameliorate arrhythmias.<br>
Determination of the area at risk and infarct size<br>
The area of myocardium at risk and infarct size were delineated by Evan's blue and<br>
triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. After 3 hours of reperfusion, the LAD was<br>
re-occluded at the original occlusion site. Immediately after intravenous injection of<br>
pentobarbitone (100 mg kg'1) to arrest the heart, Evan's blue dye (1.5%, 40 ml) was<br>
injected into the left atrium to define the myocardium at risk. The heart was rapidly<br>
removed and the left ventricle was sliced into transverse sections about 1 cm thick. The<br>
unstained risk area was traced onto the same transparencies. The sections were then<br>
incubated in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer containing 1% TTC for 20 min (37°C, pH<br>
7.4). The infarcted area was traced onto transparencies. The area of myocardium at risk,<br>
and infarct size, were measured by computerised planimetry. The former was expressed as<br>
a percentage of total left ventricular volume (AR/LV%) and infarct size was expressed as<br>
a percentage of the area of myocardium at risk (IS/AR%).<br><br>
Plasma markers for myocardial infarction<br>
Arterial blood samples (5 ml) were collected into chilled heparinised tubes at<br>
baseline, during ischaemia and at three time points during the reperfusion period (1 hour, 2<br>
hour and 3 hour). Following centrifugation at 4°C, plasma samples were stored at -20°C<br>
until measurement to determine levels of lactate dehydrogenase and creatinine kinase.<br>
Results<br>
In the following summary of results, myocardial infarct size in the 5 different<br>
treatment groups is reported. Given the effectiveness of the highest dose of DiOHF3HA,<br>
changes in all other parameters are only reported with respect to the Control group of<br>
animals versus the DiOHF3HA (6.6 mg/kg) group of animals.<br>
In the Control group, one of the sheep died due to ventricular fibrillation in the first<br>
10 minutes of reperfusion. Thus, control data are based on n=4 sheep.<br>
Myocardial infarct size<br>
In this study, the area of left ventricle subjected to ischaemia (AR) among the 5<br>
different treatment groups of sheep was similar, (ll%-20%, Figure 17, left panel). In<br>
contrast, the infarct size, normalised to the AR, was smaller in the DiOHF and<br>
DiOHF3HA treated groups compared to control animals (Figure 17, right panel).<br>
Specifically, the infarct size normalized to the area at risk (IS/AR) was reduced from<br>
83±4% in controls to 49±8% by DiOHF3HA (6.7 mg/kg) and to 47±8% by DiOHF (5<br>
mg/kg). With the lower doses of DiOHF3HA (2.7 mg/kg) and DiOHF (2 mg/kg) IS/AR<br>
was 64% and 73%, respectively.<br>
LAD flow<br>
Baseline LAD flow was similar in the Control and DiOHF3HA (6.6 mg/kg) groups<br>
of sheep (7-9 ml/min). During ischaemia, LAD flow fell to zero in all animals. During the<br>
early stage of reperfusion, coronary hyperperfusion occurred in all sheep. Generally, this<br>
transient increase in LAD flow returned to baseline levels after 30-60 mins of reperfusion.<br>
The regression of flow appeared to be more rapid in the DiOHF3HA group.<br>
Haemodynamic response to ischaemia/reperfusion<br>
Baseline arterial pressure was not different between the two groups of sheep<br>
(average over 30 mins, ~80 mmHg). In contrast, resting HR was lower (PO.05) in the<br>
control sheep (90±4 bpm) compared to the DiOHF3HA -treated sheep (105±3 bpm). This<br>
difference remained throughout the course of the experiment. Both MAP and HR were<br>
unchanged during the 20-min infusion period of DiOHF3HA administration. Moreover, no<br><br>
marked change in arterial pressure or HR was observed in either group of sheep during<br>
myocardial ischaemia and reperfusion.<br>
Resting LV-EDP was not different between the two groups of sheep (~11 mmHg)<br>
but the maximal positive value of the first derivative of LVP (dP/dtmax) was lower<br>
(PO.05) in the control sheep (1454±62 mmHg/s) compared to DiOHF3HA-treated sheep<br>
(1967±103 mmHg/s). This difference remained throughout the course of the experiment.<br>
Both LV-EDP and dP/dtmax were unchanged during the 20-min infusion period of<br>
DiOHF3HA administration. Moreover, no marked change in LV-EDP and dP/dtmax was<br>
observed in either group of sheep during myocardial ischaemia reperfusion.<br>
Haemodynamic benefits of the drug showed up more clearly after 24 hours of reperfusion.<br>
In anaesthetized sheep, following 1 hour ischaemia and 3 hours reperfusion, plasma<br>
lactate dehydrogenase increased by 227 ±141 U/L in the control group (n=3) and by 67 ±<br>
32 U/L in the group treated with DiOHF3HA (n=4). In these sheep plasma creatine kinase<br>
increased by 2411 ± 958 U/L in the control group and by 1579 ± 936 U/L in the group<br>
treated with DiOHF3HA.<br>
Recovery from ischaemic stroke in rats using synthetic flavonoids<br>
Plasma markers for myocardial infarction<br>
Ischaemic stroke was studied in conscious rats, with daily monitoring of<br>
neurological function and post mortem morphological assessment of cerebral infarcts at 72<br>
hours after stroke. Unilatera1, transient cerebral ischaemia and reperfusion was induced in<br>
conscious rats by injection of the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 outside but close to<br>
the right middle cerebral artery MCA, (via a pre-implanted guide tube). The ensuing<br>
stroke was graded on a scale of 0 to 5 by immediate behaviour, and potential<br>
neuroprotective compounds were injected intravenously 3 h after the stroke, and at 24<br>
hour intervals thereafter.<br>
Surgical Preparation<br>
Male Hooded Wistar rats (280-340 g) were anaesthetised with pentobarbitone<br>
sodium in a volume of 0.6 ml (60 mg/kg i.p.) for insertion of an intravenous (i.v.) catheter<br>
into the jugular vein for acute drug administration. A 23-gauge stainless steel guide<br>
cannula was then stereotaxically implanted into the piriform cortex 2 mm dorsal to the<br>
right MCA (0.2 mm anterior, -5.2 mm lateral and -5.9 mm ventral). The cannula was<br>
secured with dental acrylate cement and two small screws inserted into the skull. The scalp<br>
was closed with sutures. Rats were housed individually on a 12h day/night cycle at a<br>
temperature of 18-22°C and allowed to recover for 5 days before induction of stroke.<br><br>
Stroke Induction<br>
Vaso constriction of the right middle cerebral artery (MCA) was induced in<br>
conscious rats by administration of the potent vasoconstrictor agent endothelin-1 (ET-1)<br>
(60 pmol in 3 ul of saline over 10 min) via a 30-gauge injector that protruded 2mm beyond<br>
the end of the previously implanted stereotaxic guide cannula. The injector was held in<br>
place by a poly-tubing cuff and the rat was placed in a clear Plexiglass box for observation<br>
during ET-1 injection. During stroke induction we observed counter-clockwise circling,<br>
clenching and dragging of the contralateral forepaw, validating the correct placement of<br>
the cannula. These behavioural changes occurred within 2 to 10 minutes of the<br>
commencement of the ET-1 injection and similar behaviours have been reported by other<br>
researchers employing this model. We have assigned a rating scale of stroke severity<br>
based on these behavioural changes during stroke and have shown that vehicle-treated rats<br>
assigned with higher stroke ratings have greater infarct volumes and neurological deficits.<br>
Rats that did not display any behavioural change were deemed not have had a stroke and<br>
were excluded from the study. Sham-injected rats underwent cannula implantation but did<br>
not receive any ET-1 injection. Rectal temperatures were taken with a thermistor probe,<br>
prior to stroke and at 30- or 60-minute intervals for 3 hours after stroke.<br>
Assessment of Functional Outcome<br>
All behavioural tests were conducted prior to any procedures (pre-surgery, day 1),<br>
immediately prior to ET-1-induced MCA occlusion (pre-ischemia, day 6) and 24, 48 and<br>
72 hours after ET-1-induced MCA occlusion. The behaviour of each rat was compared to<br>
pre-stroke, thus each rat acted as its own control. All rats were coded so that the<br>
investigator was blinded to treatment condition. Neurological abnormalities were<br>
evaluated with the use of a neurological deficit score based on detection of abnormal<br>
posture and hemiplegia. Abnormal postures were assessed by suspending rats by the tail<br>
and scoring twisting of the thorax and extension of the forelimbs. Hemiplegia was<br>
evaluated when rats were placed on a raised platform. Deficits were deemed to be present<br>
when the hind limb contralateral to the infarcted hemisphere slipped off the edge of the<br>
platform and/or when the contralateral forelimb slipped off when the snout and whiskers<br>
were not in contact with the surface. All behaviours were scored on the following scale: 0<br>
= no deficit; 1 = slight; 2 = moderate; and 3 = severe. Thus, when scores were totalled the<br>
maximum neurological deficit score was 12. A score of 0 was considered normal.<br>
Sensory hemi-neglect was evaluated using a test consisting of placing adhesive<br>
tapes (Avery adhesive labe1, 100 mm diameter circles) on the distal-radial region of each<br>
wrist. Placement of the first tape was randomised between contralateral and ipsilateral<br><br>
limbs. The tape on both forepaws was touched simultaneously prior to placing the animal<br>
in a plexiglass cage and measuring with a stopwatch, both the latency to touch and the<br>
latency to remove each stimulus from the contralateral and ipsilateral forepaws were<br>
recorded. The test was terminated at 180 seconds if tapes had not already been removed.<br>
Drue treatment<br>
All compounds were given intravenously as a single bolus dose 3 hours post-stroke<br>
at a concentration which yielded 37 umol/kg. Vehicle controls were also used and were<br>
specific for each compound. After the first dose 3 hours post-stroke, the animals were<br>
injected once daily with either drug, or vehicle at 24 and 48 h. The total injection volume<br>
for each compound was approximately 300 ul for a 300 g rat, with a 200 (j.1 straight saline<br>
flush to ensure full drug administration.<br>
Quantification of Ischemic Damage<br>
Rats were decapitated 72h after ischemia and their brains were removed and frozen<br>
in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. Coronal cryostat sections (16 um) were cut at eight<br>
pre-determined coronal planes throughout the brain from -3.2 to 6.8 mm relative to<br>
Bregma. Infarct was measured in triplicate unstained sections based on the observation<br>
that damaged areas in unstained slide-mounted brain sections are visible to the naked eye<br>
as clearly defined frosted or dark areas, while normal tissue is essentially translucent. By<br>
applying the principle of ballistic light propagation and using a simple apparatus combined<br>
with a computerised image analysis system, the unstained slide mounted section showing<br>
damaged areas was clearly visible on the monitor. Light passes directly through the<br>
transparent, undamaged tissue to the camera, whereas light rays are diffracted by the<br>
damaged tissue. The areas of damage can then easily be outlined, selected and recorded<br>
using the image analysis system. Total infarct volume was calculated by integrating the<br>
cross-sectional area of damage at each stereotaxic level with the distances between levels.<br>
The influence of edema on the infarct area was corrected by applying the following<br>
formula: (area of normal hemisphere/area of infarcted hemisphere) x area of infarct. Slides<br>
were also coded so that the investigator was blinded to treatment condition.<br>
Stroke Rating<br>
Rats showed neurological behavioural deficits indicative of stroke within 2-10<br>
minutes of ET-1 injection but not after an equal volume of saline alone. These deficits<br>
included specific behavioural responses such as clenching and failure to extend the<br>
contralateral forepaw, and circling in the direction contralateral to the occlusion.<br>
Grooming behaviour preceded circling and was observed in almost all rats. Grooming<br><br>
occurred in a stereotypical manner with facial grooming being followed by full body<br>
grooming in one continuous movement. Other behaviours such as teeth chattering, biting<br>
of the cage and bedding or tongue poking, were observed less frequently. These<br>
behavioural responses observed at the time of stroke could be ranked based on their degree<br>
and severity. We have also shown that there is a positive correlation between stroke rating<br>
and neurological deficit score and stroke rating and infarct volume, in vehicle treated rats<br>
(n=40). Following ranking, stroke rats were paired based on equal stroke rating so that<br>
stroke ratings were evenly distributed between vehicle and Drug treatment groups. These<br>
rats were then coded so that the remaining assessments could be performed blind to<br>
treatment.<br>
Stratifying Drue treatment<br>
Prognostic models are used to predict functional outcome and survivability in<br>
human stroke patients in order to support clinical management of stroke patients and to<br>
correctly stratify treatment groups in clinical trials. The use of similar models in<br>
experimental stroke animals has not previously been attempted. In the ET-1 model of<br>
MCA occlusion it is possible to observe behavioural responses during stroke induction and<br>
assign a rating scale of stroke severity based on these responses. Therefore it is possible to<br>
predict which animals will have severe strokes and which animals will have mild to<br>
moderate strokes. This process also allows for some predication of the area of risk, which<br>
is potentially salvageable by neuroprotective agents after stroke. Severe strokes leave little<br>
area of risk for neuroprotection given that the infarct occupies greater the 70% of total<br>
hemisphere volume. Mild to moderate strokes however reveal a greater area of risk for<br>
salvage, and therefore present a greater opportunity for neuroprotection. Indeed clinical<br>
MRI studies in patients are now being used to stratify patients in a similar manner in order<br>
to determine who is more likely to benefit from future drug treatment. For this reason we<br>
removed animals that had severe stroke ratings of 4 or 5 at the end of drug treatment<br>
analysis, and re-analysed data in mild to moderate stroke groups (ratings 1-3) for all future<br>
compounds tested.<br>
3',4'-Dihvdroxvflavonol (DiOHF)<br>
Initial experiments conducted in our laboratory assessed the delayed<br>
neuroprotective potential of DiOHF (10 mg/kg) given intravenously 3 hours post-stroke<br>
onset. Each rat received 3 bolus doses of DiOHF dissolved in 20% DMSO, 40%<br>
Polyethylglycol and 40% sterile water for injection. 3',4'-Dihydroxyflavonol (DiOHF)<br>
administration in rats with modest strokes (scores 2-3, n=6 and 5, compound and vehicle,<br>
respectively) reduced the neurological deficits at 48 and 72h, and abolished the increase in<br><br>
hemineglect scores ("sticky tape test") after stroke, that were observed in the control rats<br>
given endothelin plus drug vehicle alone. Importantly, DiOHF reduced the volume of<br>
infarct produced in the cerebral cortex, and completely prevented an infarct developing in<br>
the striatum of the brain.<br>
DiOHF (10 mg/kg) treatment in mild to moderate stroke rats significantly reduced<br>
the area of infarct throughout the cortex and the striatum compared with vehicle treatment.<br>
DiOHF treatment also significantly improved neurological outcome in mild to moderate<br>
stroke rats, in comparison to vehicle treated rats.<br>
3\4'-Dihvdroxvflavone-3-hemiadipate (DiOHF3HA) for treatment of Stroke<br>
Each rat received 3 bolus doses of DiOHF3HA (15mg/kg/day i.v.) dissolved in a<br>
Na2CO3 buffered saline (0.1M, pH 7.8) for injection.<br>
	Vehicle	DJOHF3HA	<br>
Grade #2 (n=3)	#2 (n=l)<br>
Grade #3 (n=4)	# 3 (n=4)<br>
Grade #4 (n=7)	#4 (n=6)<br>
Following stroke, there was no significant weight loss in either treatment group.<br>
Core temperature prior to stroke in both treatment groups was within normal physiological<br>
limits. Following stroke there was a significant increase in temperature at 30 minutes in<br>
both treatment groups, however temperature returned to within normal levels after this<br>
time. Following intravenous injection of vehicle or DiOHF3HA, temperature appeared to<br>
increase in both treatment groups but this was not significantly different from pre-stroke<br>
temperature.<br>
Following stroke rats in both treatment groups exhibited significantly higher<br>
neurological deficit scores 24, 48 and 72 hours post-stroke when compared to pre-stroke<br>
scores. Treatment with DiOHF3HA (15 mg/kg/day) measurably improved neurological<br>
deficit scores at 24, 48 or 72 hours post-stroke when compared with vehicle treated rats.<br>
Vehicle treated rats showed increased latency to remove sticky labels from the stroke<br>
affected contralateral forepaw when compared with the ipsilateral side (P
RM-ANOVA with 2-factor repetition, hours after stroke and side). This effect was<br>
abolished after treatment with DiOHF3HA (15 mg/kg/day).<br>
Infarct area through the cortex was significantly reduced following treatment with<br>
DiOHF3HA (15 mg/kg i.v.) when compared with vehicle.<br>
In summary, DiOHF3HA (15mg/kg) treatment significantly improved neurological<br>
function in the hemineglect test, and also reduced the area of damage in the striatum<br>
following stroke compared with vehicle treatment.<br><br>
Effect ofDiOHF3HA in mild to moderate strokes<br>
A selected group of rats were studied with mild to moderate strokes.<br>
	Vehicle	DJOHF3HA	<br>
Grade #3 (n=4)	#2 (n=l)<br>
Grade #4 (n=3)	# 3 (n=4)<br>
Rats did not lose weight following mild to moderate stroke in either treatment<br>
group. Core temperature prior to stroke in both treatment groups was within normal<br>
physiological limits. Following mild to moderate stroke there was a significant increase in<br>
temperature at 30 minutes in both treatment groups, but temperature returned to within<br>
normal levels after this time.<br>
Following mild to moderate strokes, rats in both treatment groups exhibited<br>
significantly higher neurological deficit scores pre-stroke and 24, 48 and 72h post-stroke<br>
when compared to pre-surgery scores. Treatment with DiOHF3HA (15 mg/kg/day) had no<br>
effect on neurological deficit scores when compared with vehicle treated rats. Vehicle<br>
treated rats with mild to moderate strokes showed an increased latency to touch sticky<br>
labels from the stroke affected contralateral forepaw when compared with the ipsilateral<br>
side, at 24 and 48 hours (P
stroke and side). Vehicle treated rats also showed an increased latency to remove sticky<br>
labels at 24 hr (PO.05, two-way RM-ANOVA with 2-factor repetition, hours after stroke<br>
and side). These effects were abolished following treatment with DiOHF3HA (15<br>
mg/kg/day) (Figure 18).<br>
Infarct area in mild to moderate stroke rats through the cortex was significantly<br>
reduced following treatment with DiOHF3HA (15 mg/kg i.v. per day) when compared<br>
with vehicle (Figure 19). DiOHF3HA treatment also significantly reduced the area of<br>
infarct through the striatum.<br>
In summary, DiOHF3HA (15 mg/kg) treatment in mild to moderate stroke rats<br>
significantly reduced the area of infarct through the cortex and the striatum compared with<br>
vehicle treatment. DiOHF3HA treatment also significantly restored neurological function<br>
in the hemineglect test.<br>
