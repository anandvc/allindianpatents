[Detailed Description of the Invention]<br>
[0001] [Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle including"an" engine having an air cleaner, a battery, and a fuse box accommodating a fuse provided on the wiring between the battery and electrical components. [0002]<br><br><br><br>
2<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
[Description of the Related Art]<br>
Hitherto, there is a vehicle including an engine, a battery, and a fuse box accommodating a fuse provided on the wiring between the battery and electrical components as disclosed in JP-U-2538698. This scooter type vehicle is provided with a swing type engine, and the battery and the fuse box are stored in the battery box disposed below the step board that constitutes a floor step on which the rider places his/her legs. More specifically, the battery is stored in one of the spaces in the battery box which is divided into two spaces by an partition integrally formed with the battery box, and the fuse box is stored in the other space in such a manner that the fuse box is inserted into a fuse retainer formed integrally with the partition in the shape of a letter C so that the fuse box is clamped between the ends of the C. The battery or the fuse box is taken out from or stored in the battery box by removing the removable cap for hermetically closing the battery box.<br>
[0003] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the related art described above, the fuse retainer for retaining the fuse box is formed in the battery box provided in a dead space below the floor step. However, depending on the construction of the vehicle body, it is difficult to secure a space for installing the battery box which is upsized by<br>
3<br><br>
providing a storage space for the fuse box therein. Therefore, it has been desired that there be a means to retain the fuse box without storing it within the battery box and thus eliminating the need for the retaining section for the fuse box in the battery box. Further, when the battery box is required, the number of components increases and hence the number of steps for building those components to the vehicle body increases as well, and as a consequence, the number of steps for vehicle assembly increases, thereby disadvantageously increasing the costs of the vehicle.<br>
[0004]<br>
With such circumstances in view, it is an object of the present invention according to Claim 1 and Claim 2 to provide a vehicle capable of forming a fuse box retaining section irrespective of the battery box and the vehicle body structure. It is another object of the present invention according to Claim 2 is to improve installation of battery to the vehicle body and thus reduce the number of steps for vehicle assembly, and so reducing the costs, and retaining the fuse box more stably.<br>
[0005] [Means for Solving the Problems and Effects of the Invention]<br>
The invention according to Claim 1 is a vehicle provided with an engine having an air cleaner, a battery, and a fuse box accommodating a fuse provided on the wiring between the battery and electrical components, characterized in that a<br>
 4<br><br>
retaining section for retaining the aforementioned fuse box is formed integrally with the outer surface of an air cleaner case of the aforementioned air cleaner.<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, the fuse box retaining section is formed utilizing the air cleaner case of the vehicle engine, and, what is more, the fuse box does not reduce the capacity of the air cleaner case because the fuse box is held outside the air cleaner.<br>
[0007]<br>
As a consequence, according to the invention as set forth in Claim 1, the following effects are obtained. Since the retaining section for retaining the fuse box is formed integrally with the air cleaner case on the outer surface of the air cleaner case utilizing the air cleaner case of the vehicle engine, a vehicle capable of forming the fuse box retaining section irrespective of the battery box or the vehicle body structure may be provided. In addition, since the retaining section retains the fuse box outside the air cleaner case, the capacity of the air cleaner case is not reduced by the provision of the fuse box, and thus the air cleaner case may be reduced in size and weight while maintaining a required capacity.<br>
[0008]<br>
The invention according to Claim 2 is a vehicle according<br>
5<br><br>
to Claim 1, characterized in that a storage section for storing the aforementioned battery is formed on the outer surface of the aforementioned air cleaner case, and the fixing member for fixing the aforementioned battery on the aforementioned air cleaner case is formed to also have a holding portion for preventing the aforementioned fuse box from coming out of the aforementioned retaining section.<br>
[0009]<br>
Accordingly, the battery is stored in the storage section formed utilizing the air cleaner case on its outer surface. Furthermore, the fuse box is prevented from coming out of the retaining section utilizing the fixing member for fixing the battery store in the storage section.<br>
[0010]<br>
As a consequence, according to the invention as set forth in Claim 2, the following effects are exercised in addition to the effects of the invention according to Claim 1. In other words, since the battery storage section is formed on the outer surface of the air cleaner case, and the holding portion for preventing the fuse box from coming out of the retaining section is formed on the fixing member for fixing the battery on the air cleaner case, the battery is stored in the air cleaner case and thus a whole battery box for storing the battery is not necessary. Therefore, the number of components and the number<br>
6<br><br>
If steps "for installing these components to the vehicle are reduced and thus the number of steps for assembling the vehicle body decreases, thereby reducing the costs of the vehicle. In addition, since the fuse box is prevented from coming out of •the retaining section by utilizing the fixing member for fixing the battery stored in the storage section, it is not necessary, to provide an additional member for preventing the fuse box from coming out, which also contributes to reduction of the number of components and to more stable retention of the fuse box  in the  fuse box retaining  section.<br>
The present invention relates to a vehicle comprising an engine having an air cleaner (20), a battery (26), and a fuse box (40) accommodating a fuse provided on the wiring (37) between the battery (26) and electrical components, characterized in that a retaining section for retaining said fuse box (40) is formed integrally with the outer surface of an air cleaner (20) case of said air cleaner (20) wherein a retaining section is formed the corner part where two outer surfaces cross and a retaining section retains a fuse box (40) like a major axis of fuse box (40) complies with said corner.<br><br><br><br>

the internal combustion engine E, the space defined by the rear section 3b of the mainframe 3 and both of the rear frames 5 and both of the seat rails 6. Air taken from the atmosphere through the air cleaner 2 0 is mixed with fuel in a carburetor 21 and caused to flow into the aforementioned combustion chamber, and then after burning exhaust gas passes through an exhaust pipe 22 and is discharged into the muffler (not shown) disposed on the right side of the vehicle body.<br>
[0016]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 5, the air cleaner 20 is provided with an air cleaner case 23, an inlet duct 24, and an outlet duct 25, all of which are formed of synthetic resin. The inlet duct 24 is connected to the rear surface 23a of the air cleaner case 23 having a filter element therein 23n (See Fig. 4 and Fig. 6), and the outlet duct 25 extending forward on the right side of the mainframe 3 into the carburetor 21 (See Fig. 1) is connected to the right surface 23b thereof.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the air cleaner case 23, a storage section 27 for storing a battery 26 which is a substantially rectangular solid is formed on the left surface 23c which is the outer surface of the air cleaner case 23 opposite from the surface to which the outlet duct 25 is connected. The storage section 27 is defined by an inner wall 27a, and a rectangular portion<br>
12<br><br>
surrounded by a peripheral wall having an opening 27b opening toward the front. The aforementioned peripheral wall includes a lower wall 27c, an upper wall 27d, and a rear wall 27e. The battery 26 stored in the storage section 27 abuts on the inner wall 27a, the lower wall 27c, the upper wall 27c and the rear wall 27e. Because of this abutment, the movement of the battery 26 is controlled, while the front portion of the battery 2 6 projects forwardly through the opening 27b beyond the air cleaner case 23 (See Fig. 2). As described above, since the storage section 27 is provided with the opening 27b, freedom of the direction of attachment and detachment of the battery 26 with respect to the storage section 27 increases, and air from the front can easily be introduced onto the battery 26 during travel of the motorcycle V.<br>
[0018]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 4, the battery 26 stored in the storing section 27 is placed on the lower wall 27c and then clamped between an inner band 2 8 fitted into a horizontally extending band-shaped storage groove 2 7f formed on the inner wall 27a and the rear wall 27e and an outer band 29 formed with a retaining section 29h bent along the contour of the battery 26 and which is connected with the inner band 28 to the left and right of the battery and is fixed on the air cleaner case 23 by fixing both of the bands 28, 29 to the air cleaner case 23.  Therefore, the inner band 28 and the outer band 29<br>
13<br><br>
constitute a fixing member for fixing the battery 26 on the air cleaner case 23. The retaining section 29h of the outer band 29 is provided with two resilient members 30a abutting to the battery 26 for pressing the battery 26 toward the inner wall 27a and the inner band 28, and a resilient member 30b for pressing the battery 26 toward the rear wall 27e and the inner band 28.<br>
[0019]<br>
The inner band 28 and the outer band 29 are formed by bending band-shaped metal plates and are fastened on the air cleaner case 23 by bolts Bl screwed into holes formed on metallic inserts 31 embedded into the air cleaner case 23.<br>
[0020]<br>
In other words, the inner band 28 is fitted into the storage groove 27f, and then secured on the air cleaner case 23 by the bolts Bl inserted into an insertion holes H1 at connecting portions 28c, 28d formed at two positions between ends 28a, 28b of the storage section 27. After the battery 26 is put into the storage section 27, an end 29a of the outer band 29 is secured on the air cleaner case 23 together with the inner band 28 onto the left surface 23c of the air cleaner case 23 by the bolt Bl inserted into the insertion hole Hi at one end 29a of the storage section 27 and the insertion hole HI at one end 28a of the inner band 28 so that the battery 26 is fitted into the retaining section 29h of the outer band 29.<br><br>
14<br><br>
On the other hand, the other end 29b of the outer band 29 is connected with the inner band 28 by a bolt B2 inserted into the insertion hole Hi and engaged with a nut 32 welded on the other end 2 8b of the inner band 28. To dismount the battery 26, the bolt Bl and the bolt B2 fastening one end 29a of the outer band 29 to the air cleaner case 23 and the inner band 2 8 must simply be removed. The outer band 29 is provided with a mounting section 29c on which a holder 33 for securing a plurality of spare fuses is mounted formed by a pair of strips cut and bent outward from the retaining section 29h.<br>
[0021]<br>
A toolbox T including a box body 34 disposed below the air cleaner case 23 for storing tools and a lid 35 is mounted on the lower surface of the air cleaner case 23 . In other words, an engaging section 27cl formed on the lower wall 27c in the shape of a restraining groove opening downward and an engaging section 34a formed on the upper surface of the box body 34 in the shape of an restraining projection are formed into a dove tail configuration, so that the box 34 is connected to the air cleaner case 23 by inserting the box body 34 from the left side of the air cleaner case 23 so that the engaging sections 27cl, 34a engage with each other. The lid 35 for closing an opening 34b of the box body 34 hermetically is fixed on the tool box<br>
34	by bolts B3 inserted into the insertion holes H2 on the lid<br>
35	and into the insertion holes H2 on the upper edge 34c formed<br>
15<br><br>
as the openings 34b and screwed into the screw holes on the inserts 31 embedded in the lower wall 27c at the position where the upper edge 34c abuts. As a consequent, the air cleaner case 23 and the toolbox T are integrally connected with each other so as not to move with respect to each other. To take out the tool stored in the toolbox T, the bolt B3 is removed and the lid 35 is removed.<br>
[0022]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the lower surface of the box body 34 is formed with a stud-shaped projection 34d of non-circular lateral cross section for being fitted into a fitting hole 3 6a formed on a stay 36 fixed on the mainframe 3 and the right rear frame 5 and serving as a positioning member to install the air cleaner 20 at a predetermined position of the vehicle body frame F. Therefore, the air cleaner 20 is installed at the aforementioned predetermined position by fitting the projection 34d into the fitting hole 36a having a shape that corresponds to the aforementioned lateral cross section of the projection 34d and placing the air cleaner 20 on the stay 36.<br>
[0023]<br>
Referring now to Fig. 2 and Fig. 5, a retaining section 41 for retaining a fuse box 40 for accommodating a fuse provided on a wiring 3 7 between the electrical components such as a lamp, a starting motor, or an ignition unit and the battery 26, is formed integrally with the rear outer surface 23a of the air<br>
16<br><br>
cleaner case 23, at an inclined portion facing rearward and downward in the vicinity of the left surface 23c having the storage section 27 of the buttery 26 thereon.<br>
[0024]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 6, the retaining section 41 includes a supporting wall 41a having a recessed surface that matches the outer peripheral surface of the cylindrical fuse box 40, two holding tabs 41b projecting from the supporting wall 41a for partially surrounding and gripping the circumferential surface of the fuse box 40 together with the holding wall 41a, and a corner section 41c positioned at the lower end of the retaining portion 41. The retaining section 41 is formed with an opening 4 Id opening toward the left by the holding tabs 41b and the supporting wall 41a. When the fuse box 4 0 is inserted into the retaining section 41 from the opening 4Id, the outer surface of the fuse box 4 0 comes into contact with the inner surfaces of the holding tabs 41b and presses the holding tabs 41b slightly outwardly, and then it is held by the reaction force generated by the above resilient deformation. In this case, the bottom of the fuse box 40 abuts the shouldered section 41c constituting the bottom of the retaining section 41 so that the downward movement of the fuse box 4 0 is prevented. [0025]<br>
In addition, the fuse box 40 retained in the retaining<br>
17<br><br>
section 41 is prevented from coming out of the retaining section 41 by the holding portion 29d formed integrally with the outer band 29. In other words, as shown in Fig. 6, the outer band 29 is formed with a holding portion 29d at one end 29a thereof, which is an extension extending so as to cover the opening 4Id of the holding tabs 41b when the outer band 29 is secured on the air cleaner case 23. The holding portion 2 9d comes into contact with the fuse box 40 retained in the retaining section 41 and presses the fuse box 40 against the supporting wall 41a before the outer band 29 is secured on the air cleaner case 23. When dismounting the fuse box 40 from the retaining section 41 for replacing the fuse, the outer band 29 is removed and the fuse box 40 is pulled out through the opening 41d.<br>
[0026]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 5, an insertion guiding section 42 having a recessed wall surface that is hollowed out on a slightly larger scale than the wall surface of the supporting wall 41a (See also Fig. 4) is formed at the upper extension of the retaining section 41 in the direction of the axis of the fuse box 40, and thus the fuse box 40 can be pulled out from and put into the retaining section 41 through the guiding section 42.<br>
[0027]<br>
The joint structure of the air cleaner 20 provided with the battery 26, the fuse box 40n and the toolbox 34 mounted<br>
18<br><br>
thereon with respect to the vehicle body frame F will now be described.<br>
The air cleaner 20 is, as shown in Fig. 2, connected to the stay 36, a stay 50 fixed on the bent section 3c of the mainframe 3, and a plate cross member 51 fixed on both of the seat rails 6 so as to be laid between them. More specifically, the air cleaner 20 is connected to the stay 36 by fitting a projection 34d into the fitting hole 36a as described above. Referring also Fig. 7, the air cleaner 20 is connected to the stay 50 via a bush 53 of rubber material to be fitted into a hole H3 on the other end 28b of the inner band 28 and fastened to the stay 50 by a bolt B4 to be inserted into the collar 52. Accordingly, the air cleaner 20 is resiliently supported on the mainframe 3.<br>

On the other hand, the air cleaner 2 0 and the cross member 51 are connected as follows. Referring to Fig. 2 and Fig. 8, a mount member 55 formed of rubber material including cylindrical portions 55a inserted into two holes 51a formed on the cross member 51 and into which are press-fitted two columnar projections 54 formed integrally on the upper surface 23d of the air cleaner case 23 in such a manner that the mount member 55 is placed on the upper surface of the cross member 51. Subsequently, the flange 19a at the rear end of the fuel tank 19 and a supporting plate welded on the flange 19a are<br>
19<br><br>
superimposed on the mount member 55 in such a manner that the annular projections 55c in the periphery of the hole 55b of the mount member 55 are inserted into holes 19al and 56a. The mount member 55 and the fuel tank 19 are connected to the cross member 51 by fastening the bolt B5 inserted into holes 55b, 51b of the cross member 51 into the nut 57 welded on the lower surface of the cross member 51. As a consequence, the air cleaner 20 and the fuel tank 19 are resiliently supported by both of the seat rails 6.<br>
[0029]<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, a stay (not shown) welded on the lower portion of the fuel tank and a vehicle body cover C to be fixed on the stay 58 are provided on the left side of the air cleaner 20, and the vehicle body cover C covers the entire battery 26 and fuse box 40 and almost the entire air cleaner 20 so that the battery 26 and the fuse box 40 are shielded from water.<br>
[0030]<br>
The operation and effects of the embodiment constructed as described above will now be described.<br>
Since the fuse box retaining section 41 is formed on the back surface 23a of the air cleaner case 23 by forming the retaining section 41 for retaining the fuse box 4 0 while utilizing the air cleaner case 23 of the internal combustion engine E for the motorcycle V, the motorcycle V that is capable of forming the retaining section 41 for the fuse box 4 0 may<br>
20<br><br>
be provided irrespective of the vehicle body structure or the battery box in the related art. In addition, since the retaining section 41 retains the fuse box 40 outside the air cleaner case 23, the capacity of the air cleaner case 23 is not reduced by the installation of the fuse box 40, and thus the air cleaner case 23 may be reduced in size and weight while maintaining a required capacity.<br>
[0031]<br>
Since the storage section 27 for the battery 26 is formed on the left surface 23c of the air cleaner case 23, and the holding portion 2 9d for preventing the fuse box 4 0 from coming out of the retaining section 41 is formed on the outer band 29 for fixing the battery 26 on the air cleaner case 23, the battery 26 is stored by the air cleaner case 23 and thus a whole battery box for storing the battery 26 is not necessary. In addition, since the battery 26 can be mounted on the vehicle body frame F by mounting the air cleaner 2 0 on the vehicle body frame F, the number of components and the number of steps for installation on the vehicle body frame F are reduced, and thus the number of steps for assembling the motorcycle V is reduced, thereby reducing the costs of manufacturing the motorcycle V. Furthermore, since the fuse box 4 0 may be prevented from coming out of the retaining section 41 by utilizing the outer band 29 for fixing the battery 26 stored in the storage section 27, it is not necessary to provide an additional member for<br>
21<br><br>
preventing the fuse box 4 0 from coming out, which also contributes to reduction of the number of components and to more stable retention of the fuse box 40 in the fuse box retaining section 41.<br>
[0032]<br>
Since the insertion guiding section 42 extending from the retaining section 41 is formed, in order to pull out the fuse box 40 from the retaining section 41 for replacing the fuse for example, the fuse box 40 may be pulled out of and inserted into the retaining section 41 through the guiding section 42 by slightly loosening the bolt Bl fastening the outer band 29 onto the air cleaner case 23 and releasing the pressure applied by the holding portion 29d on the fuse box 40 without dismounting the outer band 29 from the air cleaner case 23, thereby facilitating the access to the fuse for replacement.<br>
[0033]<br>
Since the storage section 27 is formed with the opening 2 7b, the freedom of the direction of attachment and detachment of the battery 26 to and from the storage section 27 increases, the battery 26 may be taken out from and put in the storage section 27 easily. In addition, since air from the front can easily introduced onto the battery 26 during travel of the motorcycle V, this air from the front prevents excessive increase in temperature of the battery 26.<br>
[0034]<br>
22<br><br>
Since the projection 34d and the fitting hole 36a serving as a positioning member when the air cleaner 20 is assembled on the vehicle body frame F, the air cleaner 20 is installed at the aforementioned predetermined position in a state in which the projection 34d is fitted into the fitting hole 36a and the air cleaner 2 0 is placed on a stay, thereby facilitating the joining operation between the air cleaner 20 and the vehicle body frame F.<br>
[0035]<br>
Another embodiment in which a part of the construction in the above-described embodiment is modified will be described focussing on the modifications.<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the fuse box 40 is prevented from coming out from the retaining section 41 by the holding portion 29d of the outer band 29. However, it is also possible to prevent the fuse box 4 0 from coming out of the opening 4Id by reducing the width of the opening 4Id by increasing the extension of the holding tabs 41b surrounding the circumferential surface of the fuse box 40, without providing the holding portion 29d. In this case, attachment and detachment of the fuse box 40 with respect to the retaining section 41 is made through the guiding section 42, the fuse box 4 0 may be attached and detached irrespective of attachment and detachment of the battery 2 6 to and from the storage section 27 of the air cleaner 20.<br>
23<br><br>
[0036]<br>
In the above-described embodiment, the fuse box 4 0 is pressed by the holding portion. However, it is also possible to provide some clearance between the fuse box 4 0 and the holding portion 29d. In addition, though the holding portion is formed at the outer band 29, it may be formed at the inner band 28. The number of hold-ing tabs-4-be-may be one or three, or even more, instead of two. Furthermore, though the vehicle in the above-described embodiment is a motorcycle, it may be a vehicle other than the motorcycle.<br>
