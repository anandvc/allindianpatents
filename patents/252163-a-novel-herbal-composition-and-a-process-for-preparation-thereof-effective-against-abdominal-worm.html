				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against abdominal worm.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A large number of helminthic parasites affect man. Man is the definitive host in most instances and the several phase of life cycle takes place in human host.    <br>
Infection is spread by indigestion of contaminated material or by penetration of skin.<br>
(i)      Ascaris Lumbricoides:-<br>
Infection is spread by pollution of soil. The eggs are swallowed in contaminated food or drink. After developing in intestinal ascaris causes abdominal obstruction and discomfort intestinal vomiting. The adult worm may pass to other parts of the body<br><br>
and may cause complications.<br>
(ii)      Hook worm:-<br>
Infection is caused by Ancylostoma duodenale or Necator americanus. Anaemia is the main feature of adult infections.<br><br>
(iii)    Whip worm:-<br>
Infection is caused by Trichuris trichiura. It is very common in rural polpulation. Worms produce anorexia, diarrhoea, anemia and weight loss.<br>
(iv)     Enterobiasis (Pin worm infection) :-<br>
It is also very common infection. Main symptoms of this infection are Intense pruritus ani.<br>
(v)      Thread worm infections :-<br>
It is also very common infection and causes gastric disorder.<br>
(vi)    Cestodes intestinal:-<br>
This infection is also very common which are caused by Taenia saginata and Taenia solium.<br>
In modern medicine there are many drugs available against helminthic infection but there is no any specific therapy on preventive aspect and body immune system to stop these infections.<br><br>
There are a number of formulations	for Intestinal worm infestation<br>
available in the market. These are being manufactured and marketed by<br>
different pharmaceuticals.<br>

OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to propose a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against abdominal worm which is cheaper, more effective and free from side effects.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against abdominal worm which is derived from a number of herbs and minerals of indigenous origin growing abundantly all over India.<br>
Further object' of the present invention is to propose a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against<br>
Abdominal worm which has no toxicity or untoward effect after prolonged administration in children and also in pregnant women.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against abdominal worm which is prepared entirely from herbal commonly available drugs.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against abdominal worm which is superior than the drugs available in the market as it is more effective, easy to administer and cheaper. Its effect also lasts for long. Further, it is easier to take as compared to other drugs available in the market.<br>
Still another further object of the present invention is to propose a novel herbal composition and a process for preparation thereof effective against abdominal worm which is well tolerated and free from side effects.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a novel herbal composition effective against abdominal worm comprising of 65-80 mg seeds of Maghz-e-Karanjwa (Caesalpinia bonduc (Tinn.) 65-80 mg seed of Habb-ul-Neel (Ipomoea headeralea), 60-72 mg seed Tukhm-e-Hanzal (Citrullus colocynthis), 60-80 mg of Turbud (Ipomoea turpethum), 65-75 mg of Kamela (Malletus philippinesis Muell), 65-75 mg roof Afsanteen (Artemisia absinthium Linn.) and 60-80 mg of Plaspapra (Butea monosperma).<br><br>
Further there is provided a novel herbal composition effective against abdominal worm as claimed in claim 1, wherein the process for preparation of a novel herbal composition comprising steps of:<br>
-	Pulverization of Karanjwa and Hanzal seeds separately,<br>
-	Extraction   of Habb-ul-neel   and  Turbud,   Afsanteen   and   Plaspara followed by evaporation separately,<br>
-	Extraction of Kamela which is subjected to concentration,<br>
-	Mixing of powders and extracts thus obtained followed by drying.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The herbal composition of the present invention comprising the following ingredients with specified amounts, which may be taken as an example without restricting the scope of the invention to the same.<br>
i.   Maghz-e-Karanjwa(Caesalpinia bonduc (Tinn.)	65-80 mg.<br>
ii. Habb-ul-Neel (Ipomoea headeralea)	65-80 mg.<br>
iii. Tukhm-e-Hanzal (Citrullus colocynthis)	60-72 mg.<br>
iv. Turbud (Ipomoea turpethum)	60-80 mg.<br>
v.  Kamela (Malletus philippinesis Muell).	65-75 mg.<br>
vi. Afsanteen (Artemisia absinthium Linn.)	65-75 mg.<br>
ii.       Plaspapra (Butea monosperma)	60-80 mg.<br>
The process for preparation of the herbal composition comprising deshelling of K'aranjwa seeds followed by pulverization to fine powder of for example 100 mesh (A). Habb-ul-neel is crushed and subjected to hot extraction using a mixture of Alcohol such as ethanol, methanol and water wherein the ratio between alcohol and water is 30:70-50:50. Hot extraction is carried out by boiling the coarse powder of Habb-ul-Neel, in the quantity as per composition of formulation, taking. the solvent mixture in the quantity just sufficient to dip the total mass. After 15-20 min. of boiling, it is filtered through filter sheet. Residue thus obtained is again boiled with the solvent mixture as above and filtered. The said process is repeated three to four times. Thereafter, total filtrates are pooled together and processed further. Said boiling is carried out at 100-105°C. The process is repeated till the completion of extraction. The total extracts are pooled together and evaporated under reduced pressure (B) of 280-320 mg of Hg wherein the evaporation is carried out in closed steam jacketed pans at 60-75°C.<br>
Thereafter, pulverized Hanzal seeds are sieved through for example 100 mesh sieve (C).<br>
Turbud, Afsanteen and Palaspapra are coarsely powdered and extracted with the solution and evaporated to dryness (D). The coarseness of powder is such as 40-60 mesh.<br><br>
This is followed by extraction of Kamila with the solution till the filtrates become almost colourless. Now, total filtrates are pooled together and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure (E).<br>
Fine powder of Karanjawa seeds (A), cone, extract of Habb-ul-Neel (B), fine powder of Hanzal seeds (C), (D) 8B (E) are mixed with suitable preservative and diluents. The preservative is for example: sodium<br>
Benzoate in an amount of 0.1-0.15% and diluent is for example light kaolin. The total mass thus obtained is transferred to mass mixer. Then the kneaded semi solid mass is paissed through granulator. Thereafter, granules are dried in hot air oven.<br>
The dried granules are then encapsulated in hard gelatin empty capsules to get the capsules of weight for example 500 mg.<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, adaptations and changes by those skilled in the art. Such variant embodiments employing the concepts and features of this invention are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
