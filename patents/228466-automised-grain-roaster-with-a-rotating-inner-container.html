				<td>This invention relates to an AUTOMISED GRAIN ROASTER WITH A RORARING INNER CONTAINER<br><br>
The sole aim of the invention AUTOMISED GRAIN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER is to provide a process for uniform and effective heating of all types of grains, which process is automised in order to be less dependent on manual labour, which is the order of the day, owing to various reasons. Another added advantage of this system is that the said machine conceals the roasting process and the non-exposure to the atmosphere has consequented in hygienic operations. All modem temperature and voltage controlling gadgets have been provided in the system, which itself makes the entire system self-reliant.<br>
This AUTOMATIC GRAIN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER basically consists of a Main Body (2), which in turn carries a Rotating Inner Container (3), which is well insulated by Insulation Material (5), such as Fire Bricks, Wool, etc., in a manner to contain the flame around the Inner Container. A Heating System (7) is positioned external to the Main Body (2), as shown in the accompanying Drawing. (6) of Figure (A) shows the flame way, which heats the Rotating Inner Container (3) and in turn roasts the grains. The Main Body (2) carries an Inlet Funnel (1) on the top of it, through which the grains to be roasted are fed. A door (8) is provided at the bottom of the Inner Container, mounted on a Bearing (25), through which the roasted grains exit. A handle (9) is provided to open and close the exit door.<br>
Stirrer Blades (4) alongwith the Stirrer Pipe (11) is mounted alongwith the stirrer housing (15) above the Inner Container. Stirrer Shaft (14) is inserted<br><br>
into the Stirrer Pipe (11) and a Slot (17) on this Stirrer Pipe helps to rotate the pipe with the shaft and also facilitates upward and downward movements. The Stirrer pipe and the Door Handle (9) are linked through a Connecting Rod (16). This provision helps in opening the door automatically as and when the rotating stirrer moves upwards and vice - versa. A Control Panel (10) is provided with automatic time and temperature control gadgets alongwith a stabilizer, a contactor and motor switches. A Motor (13) is provided at the top, which drives the stirrer rod to the required rpm through a suitably pulley. A Flue Gas Outlet<br>
pipe (12) ensured the safe exit of the flue gases.<br>
The Inner Container (3), which is of arotatable type, derives power for its rotary motion from the stirrer shaft through a Worm-Worm Wheel-Gear Box arrangement (18, 19 &amp; 20) of the accompanying drawing, the gear ratio determining the speed and rpm of the Inner Container.   The idea of giving a<br>
rotary motion to the Inner Container is to ensure proper mixing and thereby uniform and effective heating of the grains. The Inner Container is mounted between two channels, Top Channel (21) housing the Container Top Bering (23) and the Bottom Channel (22) housing the Container Bottom Bearing (24), provided for supporting and smoothening the rotary motion of the Inner Container in which the grains are roasted. This provision supplements the efforts of the stirring mechanism provided for this purpose. Another Cost-effective method would be to do away with the stirrer mechanism as the rotating Inner Container itself provides for the mixing of the grains to some extent; in which event the Inner Container shall derive power directly from the Motor-Pulley arrangement.<br><br>
The grains to be roasted are fed to the Inner Container through the Inlet Funnel (1). Owing to the force exerted by the stirrer, the grains are made to strike against the Inner Wall of the Inner Container. The flame from the Heating System (7) passes through the flame way and surrounds the outer of the Inner Container, heating the container and consequently the grains. The temperature and the time controlling gadgets provided on the Control Panel (10) take care of the prescribed parameters. Once the required temperature is reached and the grains have been roasted to suffice the requirement, the movement of the stirrer in the upward direction facilitates the gathering of the roasted grains at the bottom of the Inner Container, ready for exit, once the Bottom Door (8) gives way. The Door (8) is mounted on a bearing (25) to ensure that the door also rotates smoothly alongwith the Inner Container. A Voltage Stabilizer is provided in the Control Panel to take care of the Voltage Fluctuations. As the arrangement is the said AUTOMISED GRAIN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER is for roasting without intermediate material, roasting with intermediate material is also possible by providing a perforated assembly to separate grains from the intermediate material, at the outlet end.<br>
In the conventional pan roasting method, after the roasting of the grains md the intermediate material, the operation has to be stopped to separate the roasted grains from the intermediate material by using a mesh, manually, which does not result in uniform heating of the grains. This has been overcome to a great extent in this ATOMISED GRAIN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER.    Further, in this AUTOMISED GRAIN ROASTER<br><br>
WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER, we can vary the roasting time<br>
depending upon the moisture content in the grain. In the Conventional Systems, roasting depends upon the performance of the operators and many a times there are chances of the grains getting over roasted, in case of negligence. This draw back has been overcome to a great extent in this AUTOMISED GRAIN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER.<br>
A significant draw-back in the Continuous type Roaster is that the exit of all the roasted grains from the heating zone is not simultaneous as in the case of batch-type roster and is in the form of a queue. Consequently, there is a time lag, when taken to the crushing section, between the first grain that exits would have collected at the bottom of the collecting container and the last grain that exits at the top of the collecting container. This gestation period owing to the non-simultaneous exit of the roasted grains adversely affects the crushing quality, which has been adequately overcome in this 'AUTOMISED GRIAN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER'. However, inspite of these draw-backs in the continuous type roasters, the option of converting this system into a continuous type AUTOMISED GRAIN ROASTER WITH A ROTATING INNER CONTAINER is open, which could be achieved by changing the configuration and the position of the Inner Container, as well as the Stirrer.<br><br><br><br>
