BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to therapeutic compositions that can be used to prevent and<br>
treat infection of human and animal subjects by a pathogen, and specifically to proteinbased<br>
therapeutic compositions that can be used for the prevention and treatment of viral<br>
or bacterial infections. The invention also relates to therapeutic protein-based<br>
compositions that can be used to prevent or ameliorate allergic and inflammatory<br>
responses. The invention also relates to protein-based compositions for increasing<br>
transduction efficiency of a recombinant virus, such as a recombinant virus used for gene<br>
therapy.<br>
Influenza is a highly infectious acute respiratory disease that has plagued the<br>
human race since ancient times. It is characterized by recurrent annual epidemics and<br>
periodic major worldwide pandemics. Because of the high disease-related morbidity and<br>
mortality, direct and indirect social economic impacts of influenza are enormous. Yearly<br>
epidemics cause approximately 300,000 hospitalizations and 25,000 deaths in the United<br>
States alone. Four pandemics occurred in the last century; together they caused tens of<br>
millions of deaths. Mathematical models based on earlier pandemic experiences have<br>
estimated that 89,000-207,000 deaths, 18-42 million outpatient visits and 20-47 million<br>
additional illnesses will occur during the next pandemic (Meltzer, MI, Cox, NJ and<br>
Fukuda, K. (1999) Emerg Infect Dis 5:659-671).<br>
Influenza is typically caused by infection of two types of viruses, Influenza virus<br>
A and Influenza virus B (the third type Influenza virus C only causes minor common cold<br>
like symptoms). They belong to the orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses. Both type<br>
A and type B viruses have 8 segmented negative-strand RNA genomes enclosed in a lipid<br>
envelope derived from the host cell. The viral envelope is covered with spikes that are<br>
composed of three types of proteins: hemagglutinin (HA) which attaches virus to host<br>
cell receptors and mediates fusion of viral and cellular membranes; neuraminidase (NA)<br>
which facilitates the release of the new viruses from host cells; and a small number of M2<br>
proteins which serve as ion channels.<br>
Infections by influenza type A and B viruses are typically initiated at the mucosal<br>
surface of the upper respiratory tract. Viral replication is primarily limited to the upper<br>
respiratory tract but can extend to the lower respiratory tract and cause<br>
bronchopneumonia that can be fatal.<br>
Influenza viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) is the major viral envelope protein. It<br>
plays an essential role in viral infection. The importance of HA is evidenced by the fact<br>
that it is the major target for protective neutralizing antibodies produced by the host<br>
immune response (Hayden, FG. (1996) In Antiviral drug resistance (ed. D. D.<br>
Richman), pp. 59-77. Chichester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.). It is now clear that HA<br>
has two different functions in viral infection. First, HA is responsible for the attachment<br>
of the virus to sialic acid cell receptors. Second, HA mediates viral entry into target cells<br>
by triggering fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes.<br>
HA is synthesized as a precursor protein, HAO, which is transferred through the<br>
Golgi apparatus to the cell surface as a trimeric molecular complex. HAO is further<br>
cleaved to generate the C terminus HA1 (residue 328 of HAO) and the N terminus of<br>
HA2. It is generally believed that the cleavage occurs at the cell surface or on released<br>
viruses. The cleavage of HAO into HA1/HA2 is not required for HA binding to sialic<br>
acid receptor; however, it is believed to be necessary for viral infectivity (Klenk, HD and<br>
Rott, R. (1988) Adv Vir Res. 34:247-281; Kido, H, Niwa, Y, Beppu, Y and Towatari, T.<br>
(1996) Advan Enzyme Regul 36:325-347; Skehel, JJ and Wiley, DC. (2000) Annu Rev<br>
Biochem 69:531-569; Zambon, M. (2001; Rev Med Virol 11:227-241.)<br>
Currently, influenza is controlled by vaccination and anti-viral compounds.<br>
Inactivated influenza vaccines are now in worldwide use, especially in high-risk groups.<br>
The vaccine viruses are grown in fertile hen's eggs, inactivated by chemical means and<br>
purified. The vaccines are usually trivalent, containing representative influenza A viruses<br>
(H1N1 and H3N2) and influenza B strains. The vaccine strains need to be regularly<br>
updated in order to maintain efficacy; this effort is coordinated by the World Health<br>
Organization (WHO). During inter-pandemic periods, it usually takes 8 months before<br>
the updated influenza vaccines are ready for the market (Wood, J. (2001) Phil Trans R<br>
Soc LondB 356:1953-1960). However, historically, pandemics spread to most continents<br>
within 6 months, and future pandemics are expected to spread even faster with increased<br>
international travel (Gust, ID, Hampson, AW., and Lavanchy, D. (2001) Rev Med Virol<br>
11:59-70). Therefore it is inevitable that an effective vaccine will be unavailable or in<br>
very short supply during the first waves of future pandemics.<br>
Anti-viral compounds have become the mainstay for treating inter-pandemic<br>
diseases. Currently, they are also the only potential alternative for controlling pandemics<br>
during the initial period when vaccines are not available. Two classes of antiviral<br>
compounds are currently on the market: the M2 inhibitors, such as amantadine and<br>
rimantadine; and the NA inhibitors, which include oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir<br>
(Relenza). Both classes of molecules have proven efficacy in prevention and treatment of<br>
influenza. However, side effects and the risk of generating drug-resistant viruses remain<br>
the top two concerns for using them widely as chemoprophylaxis (Hayden, FG. (1996) In<br>
Antiviral drug resistance (ed. D. D. Richman), pp. 59-77. Chichester, UK: John Wiley<br>
&amp; Sons Ltd.). Most importantly, future pandemic strains, either evolved naturally or<br>
artificially created by genetic engineering in bio-warfare, may be resistant to all the<br>
available anti-viral compounds, and this will have devastating consequences globally.<br>
In summary, currently available vaccination and anti-viral compounds are limited<br>
by some fundamental shortcomings. Novel therapeutic and prophylactic modalities are<br>
needed to address future influenza pandemics.<br>
Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common, and potentially<br>
most severe, types of infectious diseases. Clinically, RTIs include sinusitis, otitis,<br>
laryngitis, bronchitis and pneumonia. Based on numerous etiology and epidemiology<br>
studies, it is clear that although many microorganisms have the potential to cause RTIs,<br>
only a handful of pathogens are responsible for vast majority of the cases. Such<br>
pathogens include S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis,<br>
influenza A &amp; B, and parainfluenza virus. Besides causing CAP and AECB, several of<br>
the bacterial pathogens, such as S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, are also the common<br>
cause of acute sinusitis, otitis media, as well as invasive infections leading to sepsis,<br>
meningitis, etc. Therefore these microorganisms are of the highest clinical importance.<br>
One common feature of all respiratory pathogenic bacteria is that they establish<br>
commensal colonization on the mucosal surface of the upper airway; such colonization<br>
precedes an infection and is prerequisite for infections. The bacterial colonization in a<br>
neonate occurs shortly after birth. During lifetime, the upper airway, specifically the<br>
nasopharynx and oropharynx, remains a dynamic ecological reservoir of microbial<br>
species with bacteria being acquired, eliminated and re-acquired continually. In most<br>
cases the bacterial flora in the pharynx is harmless. However, when the condition of the<br>
host is altered, some microorganisms may invade adjacent tissues or bloodstream to<br>
cause diseases. In addition to serving as the port of entry for mucosal and invasive<br>
infections by both bacteria and viruses, the nasopharynx is also the major source of<br>
spreading the pathogenic microorganisms between individuals, as well as the reservoir<br>
where antibiotic-resistant bacteria are selected (Garcia-Rodriguez and Martinez, J<br>
Antimicrob Chemother, (2002) 50(Suppl S2), 59-73; Soriano and Rodriguez-Cerrato, J<br>
Antimicrob Chemother, (2002) 50 Suppl S2, 51-58). It is well established clinically<br>
that individuals who are prone to RTIs tend to be persistent and recurrent carriers of the<br>
pathogenic bacteria (Garcia-Rodriguez and Martinez, J Antimicrob Chemother, (2002)<br>
50(Suppl S2), 59-73; Mbaki et al.,Tohoku J Exp. Med., (1987) 153(2), 111-121).<br>
Helicobacter pylori is a human pathogen implicated in gastritis and peptic ulcer. The<br>
bacterium resides in the human stomach and binds to epithelial cells of the gastric antrum. It has<br>
been demonstrated that the bacterial adhesion is mediated by binding of Helicobacter pylori<br>
adhesin I and II to sialic acids on the epithelial surface.<br>
Siglecs (sialic acid binding Ig-like lectins) are members of the immunoglobulin<br>
(Ig) superfamily that bind to sialic acid and are mainly expressed by cells of the<br>
hematopoietic system. At least 11 siglecs have been discovered and they seem to<br>
exclusively recognize cell surface sialic acid as the ligand. It is believed that the binding<br>
of siglecs to sialic acid mediates cell-cell adhesion and interactions (Crocker and Varki,<br>
Trends Immunol., (2001) 22(6), 337-342; Angata and Brinkman-Van der Linden,<br>
BiOChim. Biophys. Acta, (2002) 1572(2-3), 294-316). Siglec-8 (SAF-2) is an adhesion<br>
molecule that is highly restricted to the surface of eosinophils, basophils, and mast cells,<br>
which are the central effector cells in allergic conditions including allergic rhinitis,<br>
asthma and eczema. Siglec-8 is considered to be responsible for mediating the<br>
recruitment of the three allergic cell types to the airway, the lungs and other sites of<br>
allergy. Siglec-1 (sialoadhesion) and siglec-2 (CD22) are the adhesion molecules on<br>
macrophages and B cells, both types of cells play central roles in immune reactions that<br>
lead to inflammation.<br>
Recombinant viruses, in particular adeno-associated virus (AAV), can be used to<br>
transfer the wild type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene<br>
into the epithelial cells to correct the genetic defect that causes cystic fibrosis (Flotte and<br>
Carter, Methods Enzymol., (1998) 292, 717-732). Clinical trials with AAV vectors have<br>
shown efficient and safe delivery of the CFTR gene into epithelial cells with low levels<br>
of gene transfer (Wagner et al., Lancet, (1998) 351(9117), 1702-1703). Compared to<br>
adenoviral vectors, AAV offers more stable gene expression and diminished cellular<br>
immunity. However, the transduction efficiency of AAV in vivo is rather low in the lung<br>
(Wagner et al., Lancet, (1998) 351(9117), 1702-1703). A method that can improve<br>
transduction efficiency of AAV in vivo is needed to achieve full therapeutic potential of<br>
gene therapy for cystic fibrosis. It has been shown that negatively charged<br>
carbohydrates, such as sialic acid, inhibit the transduction efficiency of AAV vector to<br>
the well-differentiated airway epithelium, and treatment of the airway epithelium by<br>
glycosidases, including a neuraminidase, and endoglycosidase H, enhances transduction<br>
efficiency of the AAV vector (Bals et al., J Virol., (1999) 73(7), 6085-6088).<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTON<br>
The present invention recognizes that current therapeutics for preventing and<br>
treating infection by pathogens are often difficult to provide in a timely manner, can have<br>
undesirable side effects, and can lead to drug-resistant pathogen strains. The present<br>
invention also recognizes that the current approach to treat allergy and inflammation has<br>
limited efficacy and is associated with side effects. In addition, the present invention also<br>
recognizes that the current approach to administer recombinant viruses yield low<br>
transduction efficiency and unsatisfactory efficacy of the gene therapy.<br>
The present invention provides new compositions and methods for preventing and<br>
treating pathogen infection. In particular, the present invention provides compounds that<br>
can act extracellularly to prevent infection of a cell by a pathogen. Some preferred<br>

IV Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The present invention includes compounds of the present invention<br>
formulated as pharmaceutical compositions. The pharmaceutical compositions<br>
comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier prepared for storage and<br>
preferably subsequent administration, which have a pharmaceutically effective<br>
amount of the compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent.<br>
Acceptable carriers or diluents for therapeutic use are well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical art, and are described, for example, in Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA (1990)).<br>
Preservatives, stabilizers, dyes and even flavoring agents can be provided in the<br>
pharmaceutical composition. For example, sodium benzoate, sorbic acid and<br>
esters of p-hydroxybenzoic acid can be added as preservatives. In addition,<br>
antioxidants and suspending agents can be used.<br>
Depending on the target cell, the compounds of the present invention can<br>
be formulated and used as tablets, capsules or elixirs for oral administration;<br>
salves or ointments for topical application; suppositories for rectal administration;<br>
sterile solutions, suspensions, and the like for use as inhalants or nasal sprays.<br>
Injectables can also be prepared in conventional forms either as liquid solutions or<br>
suspensions, solid forms suitable for solution or suspension in liquid prior to<br>
injection, or as emulsions. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline,<br>
dextrose, mannitol, lactose, lecithin, albumin, sodium glutamate, cysteine<br>
hydrochloride and the like. In addition, if desired, the injectable pharmaceutical<br>
compositions can contain minor amounts of nontoxic auxiliary substances, such<br>
as wetting agents, pH buffering agents and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutically effective amount of a test compound required as a<br>
dose will depend on the route of administration, the type of animal or patient<br>
being treated, and the physical characteristics of the specific animal under<br>
consideration. The dose can be tailored to achieve a desired effect, but will<br>
depend on such factors as weight, diet, concurrent medication and other factors<br>
which those skilled in the medical arts will recognize. In practicing the methods<br>
of the present invention, the pharmaceutical compositions can be used alone or in<br>
combination with one another, or in combination with other therapeutic or<br>
diagnostic agents. These products can be utilized in vivo, preferably in a<br>
mammalian patient, preferably in a human, or in vitro. In employing them in<br>
vivo, the pharmaceutical compositions can be administered to the patient in a<br>
variety of ways, including topically, parenterally, intravenously, subcutaneously,<br>
intramuscularly, colonically, rectally, nasally or intraperiotoneally, employing a<br>
variety of dosage forms. Such methods can also be used in testing the activity of<br>
test compounds in vivo.<br>
In preferred embodiments, these pharmaceutical compositions may be in<br>
the form of orally-administrable suspensions, solutions, tablets or lozenges; nasal<br>
sprays; inhalants; injectables, topical sprays, ointments, powders, or gels.<br>
When administered orally as a suspension, compositions of the present<br>
invention are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of<br>
36<br>
pharmaceutical formulation and may contain microcrystalline cellulose for<br>
imparting bulk, alginic acid or sodium alginate as a suspending agent,<br>
methylcellulose as a viscosity enhancer, and sweeteners/flavoring agents known<br>
in the art. As immediate release tablets, these compositions may contain<br>
microcrystalline cellulose, dicalcium phosphate, starch, magnesium stearate and<br>
lactose and/or other excipients, binders, extenders, disintegrants, diluents and<br>
lubricants known in the art. Components in the formulation of a mouthwash or<br>
rinse include antimicrobials, surfactants, cosurfactants, oils, water and other<br>
additives such as sweeteners/flavoring agents known in the art.<br>
When administered by a drinking solution, the composition comprises one<br>
or more of the compounds of the present invention, dissolved in water, with<br>
appropriate pH adjustment, and with carrier. The compound may be dissolved in<br>
distilled water, tap water, spring water, and the like. The pH can preferably be<br>
adjusted to between about 3.5 and about 8.5. Sweeteners may be added, e.g., 1%<br>
(w/v) sucrose.<br>
Lozenges can be prepared according to U.S. Patent No. 3,439,089, herein<br>
incorporated by reference for these purposes.<br>
When administered by nasal aerosol or inhalation, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of<br>
pharmaceutical formulation and may be prepared as solutions in saline,<br>
employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to<br>
enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing<br>
agents known in the art. See, for example, Ansel, H. C. et al., Pharmaceutical<br>
Dosage Forms and Drug Delivery Systems, Sixth Ed. (1995). Preferably these<br>
compositions and formulations are prepared with suitable nontoxic<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable ingredients. These ingredients are known to those<br>
skilled in the preparation of nasal dosage forms and some of these can be found in<br>
Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed., Mack Publishing Co., Easton,<br>
PA (1990, a standard reference in the field. The choice of suitable carriers is<br>
highly dependent upon the exact nature of the nasal dosage form desired, e.g.,<br>
solutions, suspensions, ointments, or gels. Nasal dosage forms generally contain<br>
large amounts of water in addition to the active ingredient. Minor amounts of<br>
other ingredients such as pH adjusters, emulsifiers or dispersing agents,<br>
preservatives, surfactants, jelling agents, or buffering and other stabilizing and<br>
solubilizing agents may also be present. Preferably, the nasal dosage form should<br>
be isotonic with nasal secretions.<br>
Nasal formulations can be administers as drops, sprays, aerosols or by any<br>
other intranasal dosage form. Optionally, the delivery system can be a unit dose<br>
delivery system. The volume of solution or suspension delivered per dose can<br>
preferably be anywhere from about 5 to about 2000 microliters, more preferably<br>
from about 10 to about 1000 microliters, and yet more preferably from about 50<br>
to about 500 microliters. Delivery systems for these various dosage forms can be<br>
dropper bottles, plastic squeeze units, atomizers, nebulizers or pharmaceutical<br>
aerosols in either unit dose or multiple dose packages.<br>
The formulations of this invention may be varied to include; (1) other<br>
acids and bases to adjust the pH; (2) other tonicity imparting agents such as<br>
sorbitol, glycerin and dextrose; (3) other antimicrobial preservatives such as other<br>
parahydroxy benzoic acid esters, sorbate, benzoate, propionate, chlorbutanol,<br>
phenylethyl alcohol, benzalkonium chloride, and mercurials; (4) other viscosity<br>
imparting agents such as sodium carboxymethylcellulose, microcrystalline<br>
cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol and other gums; (5) suitable<br>
absorption enhancers; (6) stabilizing agents such as antioxidants, like bisulfite and<br>
ascorbate, metal chelating agents such as sodium edetate and drug solubility<br>
enhancers such as polyethylene glycols.<br>
V. Method of preventing or treating infection by a pathogen<br>
The present invention also includes methods of preventing or treating infection by<br>
a pathogen. In one aspect, the method includes: treating a subject that is infected with a<br>
pathogen or at risk of being infected with a pathogen with a pharmaceutical composition<br>
of the present invention that comprises a compound that comprises at least one anchoring<br>
domain that can anchor the compound at or near the surface of a target cell and at least<br>
one therapeutic domain comprising a peptide or protein that has at least one extracellular<br>
activity that can prevent the infection of a target cell by a pathogen. In some preferred<br>
embodiments, the method includes applying a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to epithelial cells of a subject. The<br>
subject to be treated can be an animal or human subject.<br>
In another aspect, the method includes: treating a subject that is infected with a<br>
pathogen or at risk of being infected with a pathogen with a pharmaceutical composition<br>
of the present invention that comprises a protein-based compound that comprises a<br>
sialidase activity. In some preferred embodiments, the method includes applying a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention<br>
to epithelial cells of a subject. The sialidase activity can be an isolated naturally occurring<br>
sialidase protein, or a recombinant protein substantially homologous to at least a portion<br>
of a naturally occurring sialidase. A preferred pharmaceutical composition comprises a<br>
sialidase with substantial homology to the A. viscosus sialidase (SEQ ID NO:12). The<br>
subject to be treated can be an animal or human subject.<br>
In yet another aspect, the method includes: treating a subject that is infected with<br>
a pathogen or at risk of being infected with a pathogen with a pharmaceutical<br>
composition of the present invention that comprises a protein-based compound that<br>
comprises a sialidase catalytic domain. In some preferred embodiments, the method<br>
includes applying a therapeutically effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the present invention to epithelial cells of a subject. The sialidase catalytic domain is<br>
preferably can substantially homologous to the catalytic domain of a naturally occurring<br>
sialidase. A preferred pharmaceutical composition comprises a sialidase catalytic domain<br>
with substantial homology to amino acids 274-666 the A. viscosus sialidase (SEQ ID<br>
NO:12). The subject to be treated can be an animal or human subject.<br>
A pathogen can be a viral, bacterial, or protozoan pathogen. In some embodiments,<br>
the pathogen is one of the following: influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, respiratory<br>
syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, rotavirus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma<br>
pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>
and Helicobacter pylori. In one preferred embodiment, the pathogen is influenza virus.<br>
Compounds of the present invention can be designed for human use or animal<br>
use. In some aspects of the present invention, a compound of the present invention can be<br>
used to prevent pathogen infection in a class of animals, such as mammals. In some<br>
aspects of the present invention, a composition can be used for human and animal use<br>
(although the formulation may differ). In these aspects, the active domains of a<br>
compound can be effective against more than one pathogen species, type, subtype, or<br>
strain and can be active in more than one host species. For example, some preferred<br>
compounds of the present invention that comprise, for example, active domains such as<br>
protease inhibitors that prevent processing of the HA protein of influenza virus, or<br>
sialidases that remove sialic acid receptors from target cells, or anchoring domains such<br>
as domains that bind heparin or heparan sulfate, can be used in birds, mammals, or<br>
humans. Such compounds that can be effective against a range of pathogens with the<br>
capacity to infect different host species can also be used in humans to combat infection<br>
by pathogens that are naturally hosted in other species.<br>
In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, the pharmaceutical<br>
composition prevents infection by influenza, and a therapeutically effective amount of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is applied to the respiratory epithelial cells of a subject. This<br>
can be done by the use of an inhaler, or by the use of a nasal spray. Preferably, the inhaler<br>
or nasal spray is used from one to four times a day.<br>
Because influenza viruses primarily infect the upper respiratory tract, removing the<br>
receptor sialic acid locally in the nasal cavity, pharynx, trachea and bronchi can prevent<br>
infections or interrupt early infections. The sialidase can be delivered to the upper<br>
respiratory tract as a nasal spray or as an inhalant, and it can be used either in therapeutic<br>
mode during early stage of influenza (or other infection) or in prophylactic mode before<br>
the infection occurs. Alternatively, it can be delivered to the lower respiratory tract as an<br>
inhalant to treat influenza and to prevent influenza complications, such as<br>
bronchopneumonia. Similarly, the sialidase can be delivered as nasal spray or inhalant to<br>
prevent or reduce infection by parainfluenza virus and coronavirus. It can also be<br>
delivered as an inhalant or nasal spray to prevent or reduce airway colonization by<br>
pathogenic bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,<br>
Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The<br>
therapeutic compounds can optionally be adapted, by genetic or chemical engineering, or<br>
by pharmaceutical formulation, to improve their half-life or retention at the respiratory<br>
epithelium. Additionally, it can be delivered topically to the eyes or to surgical wounds in<br>
the form of drops, sprays or ointments to prevent and treat bacterial infection including<br>
infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It can also be administered orally to treat infection<br>
by Helicobacter pylori.<br>
Dosage<br>
As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the useful in vivo<br>
dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary<br>
depending upon the age, weight and type of patient being treated, the particular<br>
pharmaceutical composition employed, and the specific use for which the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is employed. The determination of effective dosage<br>
levels, that is the dose levels necessary to achieve the desired result, can be<br>
accomplished by one skilled in the art using routine methods as discussed above.<br>
In non-human animal studies, applications of the pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
commenced at higher dose levels, with the dosage being decreased until the<br>
desired effect is no longer achieved or adverse side effects are reduced or<br>
disappear. The dosage for a compound of the present invention can range broadly<br>
depending upon the desired affects, the therapeutic indication, route of<br>
administration and purity and activity of the compound. Typically, human clinical<br>
applications of products are commenced at lower dosage levels, with dosage level<br>
being increased until the desired effect is achieved. Alternatively, acceptable in<br>
vitro studies can be used to establish useful doses and routes of administration of<br>
the test compound. Typically, dosages can be between about 1 ng/kg and about 10<br>
mg/kg, preferably between about 10 ng/kg and about 1 mg/kg, and more<br>
preferably between about 100 ng/kg and about 100 micrograms/kg.<br>
The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen<br>
by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see, Fingle et al., in<br>
The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (1975)). It should be noted that the<br>
attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt or adjust<br>
administration due to toxicity, organ dysfunction or other adverse effects.<br>
Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher<br>
levels if the clinical response were not adequate. The magnitude of an<br>
administrated does in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with<br>
the severity of the condition to be treated and to the route of administration. The<br>
severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard<br>
prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency,<br>
will also vary according to the age, body weight and response of the individual<br>
patient, including those for veterinary applications.<br>
Thus, in accordance with the present invention, there is further provided a method<br>
of treating and a pharmaceutical composition for treating influenza virus infection and<br>
prevention of influenza virus infection. The treatment involves administering to a patient<br>
in need of such treatment a pharmaceutical carrier and a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of any composition of the present invention, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt<br>
thereof.<br>
In one preferred regimen, appropriate dosages are administered to each patient by<br>
either inhaler, nasal spray, or by oral lozenge. It will be understood, however, that the<br>
specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be varied and<br>
will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific salt or other<br>
form employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound, the age,<br>
body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of excretion,<br>
drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host undergoing<br>
therapy.<br>
VI. Method of reducing, preventing, or treating allergic and inflammatory responses<br>
The present invention also includes methods of reducing, preventing, or treating<br>
an allergic or inflammatory response of a subject.<br>
In one aspect, the method includes: preventing or treating an allergic or<br>
inflammatory response of a subject with a pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention that comprises a protein-based compound that comprises a sialidase activity. In<br>
some preferred embodiments, the method includes applying a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to epithelial cells of a<br>
subject. The sialidase activity can be an isolated naturally occurring sialidase protein, or a<br>
recombinant protein substantially homologous to at least a portion of a naturally<br>
occurring sialidase. A preferred pharmaceutical composition comprises a sialidase with<br>
substantial homology to the ,4. viscosus sialidase (SEQ ID NO:12). The subject to be<br>
treated can be an animal or human subject.<br>
In yet another aspect, the method includes: preventing or treating an allergic or<br>
inflammatory response of a subject with a pharmaceutical composition of the present<br>
invention that comprises a protein-based compound that comprises a sialidase catalytic<br>
domain. In some preferred embodiments, the method includes applying a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a pharmaceutical composition of the present invention to epithelial<br>
cells of a subject. The sialidase catalytic domain is preferably can substantially<br>
homologous to the catalytic domain of a naturally occurring sialidase. A preferred<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprises a sialidase catalytic domain with substantial<br>
homology to amino acids 274-666 the A. viscosus sialidase (SEQ ID NO:12). The<br>
subject to be treated can be an animal or human subject.<br>
The allergic or inflammatory response can be and acute or chronic condition, and<br>
can include, as nonlimiting examples, asthma, other allergic responses causing<br>
respiratory distress, allergic rhinitis, eczema, psoriasis, reactions to plant or animal<br>
toxins, or autoimmune conditions.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, compounds of the present invention can be<br>
delivered as an inhalant or nasal spray to prevent or treat inflammation in the airway<br>
including, but not limited to, asthma and allergic rhinitis. Compounds of the present<br>
invention comprising sialidase activity (including sialidase catalytic domain proteins and<br>
sialidase fusion proteins) can also be administered as eye drops, ear drops, or sprays,<br>
ointments, lotions, or gels to be applied to the skin. In another aspect, the method includes<br>
treating a patient who has inflammatory diseases with the present invention that comprises<br>
a sialidase activity that is administered intravenously or as a local injection.<br>
Dosage<br>
As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the useful in vivo<br>
dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary<br>
depending upon the age, weight and type of patient being treated, the particular<br>
pharmaceutical composition employed, and the specific use for which the<br>
pharmaceutical composition is employed. The determination of effective dosage<br>
levels, that is the dose levels necessary to achieve the desired result, can be<br>
accomplished by one skilled in the art using routine methods as discussed above.<br>
In non-human animal studies, applications of the pharmaceutical compositions are<br>
commenced at higher dose levels, with the dosage being decreased until the<br>
desired effect is no longer achieved or adverse side effects are reduced or<br>
disappear. The dosage for a compound of the present invention can range broadly<br>
depending upon the desired affects, the therapeutic indication, route of<br>
administration and purity and activity of the compound. Typically, human clinical<br>
applications of products are commenced at lower dosage levels, with dosage level<br>
being increased until the desired effect is achieved. Alternatively, acceptable in<br>
vitro studies can be used to establish useful doses and routes of administration of<br>
the test compound. Typically, dosages can be between about 1 ng/kg and about 10<br>
mg/kg, preferably between about 10 ng/kg and about 1 mg/kg, and more<br>
preferably between about 100 ng/kg and about 100 micrograms/kg.<br>
The exact formulation, route of administration and dosage can be chosen<br>
by the individual physician in view of the patient's condition (see, Fingle et al., in<br>
The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (1975)). It should be noted that the<br>
attending physician would know how to and when to terminate, interrupt or adjust<br>
administration due to toxicity, organ dysfunction or other adverse effects.<br>
Conversely, the attending physician would also know to adjust treatment to higher<br>
levels if the clinical response were not adequate. The magnitude of an<br>
administrated does in the management of the disorder of interest will vary with<br>
the severity of the condition to be treated and to the route of administration. The<br>
severity of the condition may, for example, be evaluated, in part, by standard<br>
prognostic evaluation methods. Further, the dose and perhaps dose frequency,<br>
will also vary according to the age, body weight and response of the individual<br>
patient, including those for veterinary applications.<br>
In some preferred regimens, appropriate dosages are administered to each patient<br>
by either inhaler, nasal spray, or by topical application. It will be understood, however,<br>
that the specific dose level and frequency of dosage for any particular patient may be<br>
varied and will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific salt<br>
or other form employed, the metabolic stability and length of action of that compound,<br>
the age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, mode and time of administration, rate of<br>
excretion, drug combination, the severity of the particular condition, and the host<br>
undergoing therapy.<br>
VI. Method of enhancing gene delivery by a recombinant viral vector<br>
The present invention also includes methods of gene delivery by a recombinant<br>
viral vector. In one aspect, the method includes: administering an effective amount of a<br>
compound of the present invention that comprises a protein having sialidase activity to at<br>
least one cell prior to or concomitant with the administration of at least one recombinant<br>
viral vector. A composition of the present invention can be provided in the same<br>
formulation as at least one recombinant viral vector, or in a separate formulation.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the method includes applying a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a composition of the present invention and a recombinant viral vector<br>
to cells of a subject. The subject to be treated can be an animal or human subject. In a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment, a recombinant viral vector is used to transduce<br>
epithelial target cells of a subject for gene therapy. For example, a recombinant viral<br>
vector can be used to transduce airway epithelial cells of a subject with cystic fibrosis. hi<br>
this case, a compound of the present invention can be administered by use of an inhaler.<br>
A recombinant virus comprising a therapeutic gene can be administered concurrently or<br>
separately.<br>
In other embodiments, cells can be treated with a compound of the present<br>
invention and a recombinant viral vector in vitro or "ex vivo" (that is, cells removed from<br>
a subject to be transplanted into a subject after transduction).<br>
The sialidase activity can be an isolated naturally occurring sialidase protein, or a<br>
recombinant protein substantially homologous to at least a portion of a naturally<br>
occurring sialidase, including a sialidase catalytic domain. A preferred pharmaceutical<br>
composition comprises a sialidase with substantial homology to the A. viscosus sialidase<br>
(SEQIDNO:12).<br>
A compound of the present invention can be administered to target cells from one<br>
day before to two hours subsequent to the administration of the recombinant virus.<br>
Preferably a compound of the present invention is administered to target cells from four<br>
hours to ten minutes before administration of the recombinant virus. Administration can<br>
be<br>
A recombinant virus is preferably a recombinant virus that can be used to transfer<br>
genes to mammalian cells, such as, preferably human cells. For example, a recombinant<br>
virus can be a retrovirus (including lentivirus), adeno-virus, adeno-associated virus<br>
(AAV) or herpes simplex virus type 1. The recombinant virus comprises at least one<br>
exogenous gene that is to be transferred to a target cell. The gene is preferably a<br>
therapeutic gene, but this need not be the case. For example, the gene can be a gene used<br>
to mark cells or confer drug resistance.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the present invention includes methods of improving<br>
efficacy of a gene therapy vector. The method includes treating a patient with a<br>
compound of the present invention that comprises a sialidase activity and, in the same or a<br>
separate formation, with a recombinant virus. The compound of the present invention<br>
having sialidase activity can be administered to the patient prior to, concomitant to, or<br>
even subsequent to the administration of a recombinant virus. In one embodiment, the<br>
sialidase is substantially homologous to the Actinomyces viscosus sialidase (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 12) or a portion thereof. In one preferred embodiment, the sialidase comprises the<br>
catalytic domain of the Actinomyces viscosus sialidase. In another embodiment, the<br>
recombinant virus is AAV. In yet another embodiment, the disease is cystic fibrosis. In<br>
yet another embodiment, the recombinant virus comprises the cystic fibrosis<br>
transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.<br>

As will be readily apparent to one skilled in the art, the useful in vivo<br>
dosage to be administered and the particular mode of administration will vary<br>
depending upon the age, weight and type of patient being treated, the particular<br>

preferably between about 100 ng/kg and about 100 micrograms/kg.<br>

undergoing therapy.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Synthesizing aprotinin genes, purifying and testing aprotinin fusion proteins.<br>
Introduction<br>
Influenza viral protein hemagglutinin (HA) is the major influenza envelope<br>
protein. It plays an essential role in viral infection. The importance of HA is evidenced<br>
by the fact that it is the major target for protective neutralizing antibodies produced by<br>
the host immune response (Hayden, FG. (1996) In Antiviral drug resistance (ed. D. D.<br>
Richman), pp. 59-77. Chichester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.). It is now clear that HA<br>
has two different functions in viral infection. First, HA is responsible for the attachment<br>
of the virus to sialic acid cell receptors. Second, HA mediates viral entry into target cells<br>
by triggering fusion of the viral envelope with cellular membranes.<br>
HA is synthesized as a precursor protein, HAO, which is transferred through the<br>
Golgi apparatus to the cell surface as a trimeric molecular complex. HAO is further<br>
cleaved to generate the C terminus HA1 (residue 328 of HAO) and the N terminus of<br>
HA2. It is generally believed that the cleavage occurs at the cell surface or on released<br>
viruses. The cleavage of HAO into HA1/HA2 is not required for HA binding to a sialic<br>
acid receptor; however, it is essential for viral infectivity (Klenk, HD and Rott, R. (1988)<br>
48<br>
Adv VirRes. 34:247-281; Kido, H, Niwa, Y, Beppu, Y and Towatari, T. (1996) Advan<br>
Enzyme Regul 36:325-347; Skehel, JJ and Wiley, DC. (2000) Annu Rev Biochem 69:531-<br>
569).<br>
Sensitivity of HAO to host proteases is determined by the proteolytic site in the<br>
external loop of HAO molecule. The proteolytic site may contain either a single Arg or<br>
Lys residue (monobasic cleavage site) or several Lys and/or Arg residues in R-X-K/R-R<br>
motif (multibasic cleavage site). Only the influenza A virus subtypes H5 and H7 have<br>
HA proteins carrying the multibasic cleavage site. All other influenza A, B and C viruses<br>
contain HA proteins having the monobasic cleavage site. Influenza A viruses having<br>
multibasic cleavage sites are more virulent and induce systemic infection in hosts<br>
whereas viruses with a monobasic HA site initiate infection only in the respiratory tract in<br>
mammals or in the respiratory and enteric tracts in avian species (Klenk, HD and Garten<br>
W. 1994. Trend Micro 2:39-43 for review). Fortunately, human infection by the highly<br>
virulent avian influenza A H5 and H7 subtypes, which carry the multibasic cleavage site,<br>
has so far only occurred in a handful of cases discovered mostly in Hong Kong. The vast<br>
majority of influenza infections are caused by viruses with HA proteins are cleaved at the<br>
monobasic cleavage site.<br>
Influenza virus HA subtypes 5 and 7 that contain multibasic cleavage sites are<br>
activated by furin, a member of the subtilisin-like endoproteases, or the pre-protein<br>
convertase family. Furin cleaves the virus intracellularly and is ubiquitously present in<br>
many cell types, allowing the virulent, systemic infection seen with such viruses (Klenk,<br>
HD and Garten W. 1994. Trend Micro 2:39-43; Nakayama, K. 1997. Biochem 327:625-<br>
635). All other influenza viruses, which have HAs with monobasic cleavage sites, are<br>
activated by secreted, trypsin-like serine proteases. Enzymes that have been implicated<br>
in influenza virus activation include: plasmin (Lazarowitz SG, Goldberg AR and Choppin<br>
PW. 1973. Virology 56:172-180), mini-plasmin (Murakami M, Towatari T, Ohuchi M,<br>
Shiota M, Akao M, Okumura Y, Parry MA and Kido H. (2001) Eur JBiochem 268:<br>
2847-2855), tryptase Clara (Kido H, Chen Y and Murakami M. (1999) In B.Dunn (ed.),<br>
Proteases of infectious agents, p.205-217, Academic Press, New York, N.Y), kallikrein,<br>
urokinase, thrombin (Scheiblauer H, Reinacher M, Tashiro M and Rott R. (1992) JInfec<br>
Dis 166:783-791), blood clotting factor Xa (Gotoh B, Ogasawara T, Toyoda T, Inocencio<br>
N, Hamaguchi M and Nagai Y. (1990) EMBOJ 9:4189-4195), acrosin (Garten W, Bosch<br>
FX, Linder D, Rott R and Klenk HD. (1981) Virology 115:361-374.), proteases from<br>
human respiratory lavage (Barbey-Morel CL, Oeltmann TN, Edwards KM and Wright<br>
PF. (1987) JInfect Dis 155:667-672) and bacterial proteases from Staphylococcus<br>
aureus (Tashiro M, Ciborowski P, Reinacher M, Pulverer G, Klenk HD and Rott R.<br>
(1987) Virology 157:421-430) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Callan RJ, Hartmann FA,<br>
West SE and Hinshaw VS. (1997) J Virol 71:7579-7585). Activation of influenza<br>
viruses by host serine proteases is generally considered to occur extracellularly either at<br>
the plasma membrane or after virus release from the cell.<br>
Aprotinin, also called Trasylol, or bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) is a<br>
polypeptide having 58 amino acids. It belongs to the family of Kunitz-type inhibitors and<br>
competitively inhibits a wide spectrum of serine proteases, including trypsin,<br>
chymotrypsin, plasmin and plasma kallikrein. Aprotinin has long been used as a human<br>
therapeutics, such as treatment of pancreatitis, various states of shock syndrome,<br>
hyperfibrinolytic haemorrhage and myocardial infarction. It is also used in open-heart<br>
surgery, including cardiopulmonary bypass operations, to reduce blood loss (Fritz H and<br>
Wunderer G. (1983; Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494).<br>
The safety of aprotinin in human has been well documented through years of<br>
clinical applications. In addition, aprotinin is apparently a very weak immunogen as<br>
aprotinin-specific antibodies have not been observed in human sera so far (Fritz H and<br>
Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494). Another desired feature of aprotinin<br>
as a drug candidate is its superb stability. It can be kept at room temperature for at least<br>
18 months without any loss of activity (Fritz H and Wunderer G. (1983,) Arzneim-Forsch<br>
33:479-494).<br>
To achieve significant viral inhibition in animal studies that have been performed,<br>
aprotinin was administered at high doses. For example, 280 micrograms to 840<br>
micrograms per day of aprotinin was injected intraperitoneally into each mouse for 6<br>
days (Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV and Bukrinskaya AG. (1984) J Gen Virol 65:191-<br>
196); a lower dosage was required for aerosol inhalation, still, each mouse was given 63 -<br>
126 micrograms per day for 6 days (Ovcharenko AV and Zhirnov OP. (1994) Antiviral<br>
Res 23:107-118). A very high dose of aprotinin would be required in human based on<br>
extrapolation from the mouse data. Therefore to achieve better efficacy in human, the<br>
potency of aprotinin molecule needs to be significantly improved.<br>
Aprotinin functions by competitively inhibiting serine proteases that are mostly<br>
on the surface of host respiratory epithelial cells. Local concentration of aprotinin in the<br>
vicinity of host proteases is therefore the key factor determining competitive advantage of<br>
aprotinin. We use two approaches that work synergistically to boost competitive<br>
advantage of aprotinin on the surface of respiratory epithelium.<br>
First, the avidity (functional affinity) of aprotinin is increased by making<br>
multivalent aprotinin fusion proteins consisting of two, three, or more aprotinin proteins<br>
connected via linkers. Such a molecule is able to bind to membrane proteases in a<br>
multivalent fashion, which has significant kinetic advantage over the aprotinin monomer.<br>
Monomeric aprotinin binds to bovine trypsin very tightly with dissociation constant (Ki)<br>
being 6.0 x 10~14 mol/1. However, its affinity compared to other proteases, such as<br>
chymotrypsin, plasmin and Kallikrein, which have been implicated in activation of<br>
influenza viruses, is much lower with Ki being at the level of 10~8 to 10~9 mol/1 (Fritz H<br>
and Wunderer G. (1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494). Multimerization can increase<br>
aprotinin's affinity to these proteases exponentially.<br>
Second, we fuse aprotinin with a respiratory epithelium-anchoring domain. The<br>
anchoring domain localizes aprotinin to the proximity of host membrane-associated<br>
proteases and maintains a high local concentration of aprotinin on epithelial surface. The<br>
anchoring domain also increases retention time of the drug on the respiratory epithelium.<br>
Cloning<br>
Aprotinin is a single chain polypeptide having 58 amino acid residues and 3 intrachain<br>
disulfide bonds (SEQ ID NO:1). The amino acid sequence of aprotinin is shown<br>
in Figure 1. Genes encoding aprotinin and aprotinin fusion proteins are synthesized by<br>
PCR using overlapping oligonucleotides with codons optimized for E. Coli expression as<br>
templates. The PCR products are cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). After<br>
sequencing, the genes are subcloned into an expression vector pQE (Qiagen). The vector<br>
carries a purification tag, Hisx6, to allow easy purification of the recombinant proteins.<br>
The constructs are used to transform E. Coli. The transformed cells grown in LB-<br>
ampicillin medium to mid-log phase are induced by IPTG according to standard<br>
protocols. Cells are pelleted and lysed in phosphate-buffered-saline (PBS) by sonication.<br>
The enzymes, which have Hise purification tag, are purified using a nickel column<br>
(Qiagen).<br>
The following aprotinin fusion proteins are made:<br>
1. Dimeric and trimeric aprotinin. Two or three aprotinin genes are linked via a flexible<br>
linker as the following constructs:<br>
Aprotinin—(GGGGS (SEQ ID NO:10))n (n=3, 4 or 5)—Aprotinin;<br>
and<br>
Aprotinin—(GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10))n (n=3, 4 or 5)—Aprotinin—<br>
(GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10))n (n=3, 4 or 5)—Aprotinin<br>
The length of the linker sequence may determine three-dimensional flexibility of the<br>
multimeric aprotinin and thereby influence functional affinity of the molecule. Therefore<br>
constructs having linkers with various lengths are made.<br>
Fully functional recombinant monomeric aprotinin has been produced in E. Coli<br>
(Auerswald EA, Horlein D, Reinhardt G, Schroder W and Schnabel E. (19SS).Biol Chem<br>
Hoppe-Seyler Vol 369, Suppl., pp27-35). We therefore expect proper folding of<br>
multivalent aprotinin proteins in E. coli cells. Besides expressing protein in various<br>
common E, Coli cell strains, such as BL21, JM83, etc, the multivalent aprotinin proteins<br>
are also expressed in Origami™ cells (Novagen, Bad Soden, Germany). The Origami™<br>
cell strain does not have thioredoxin and glutathione reductase and thus has an oxidizing<br>
cytoplasm. This cell strain has been used to successfully express a number of proteins<br>
that contain disulflde bonds (Bessette PH, Aslund F, Beckwith J and Georgiou G. (1999)<br>
Pro NatlAcad Sci USA 96:13703-13708; Venturi M, Seifert C and Hunte C. (2001) J<br>
Mol 5/0/315:1-8.).<br>
2. The epithelium cell-anchoring aprotinin. An epithelium cell-anchoring sequence is<br>
fused with aprotinin. The epithelium-anchoring sequence can be any peptide or<br>
polypeptide sequence that has affinity towards the surface of epithelial cells. We have<br>
selected three human GAG-binding sequences: PF4 (aa 47-70; SEQ ID NO: 2), IL-8<br>
(aa 46-72; SEQ ID NO: 3), and AT III (aa 118-151; SEQ ID NO: 4) (Figure 2).<br>
These sequences bind to heparin/heparan sulfate with nanomolar-level affinities<br>
(Table 1). Heparin/Heparan Sulfate are ubiquitously present on the respiratory<br>
epithelium. In separate constructs, the GAG-binding sequences are fused with the<br>
aprotinin gene on the N terminus and on the C terminus via a generic linker sequence<br>
GGGGS as the following constructs:<br>
(GAG domain—GGGGS(SEQ ID NO: 10)—Aprotinin); and<br>
(Aprotinin—GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10&gt;—GAG domain)<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Photometric trypsin inhibition assay<br>
The trypsin inhibition activity of aprotinin and aprotinin fusion proteins is<br>
measured by a photometric assay described previously in detail (Fritz H and Wunderer G.<br>
(1983) Arzneim-Forsch 33:479-494). Briefly, in this assay aprotinin inhibits the trypsincatalyzed<br>
hydrolysis of Na-benzoyl-L-arginine-p-nitroanilide (BzArgpNA or L-BAPA)<br>
 (Sigma), which is followed photometrically at 405 run. One trypsin unit (UBAPA)<br>
corresponds to the hydrolysis of 1 micromole substrate per min. One inhibitor unit<br>
(!UBAPA) decreases the activity of two trypsin units by 50%, which corresponds<br>
arithmetically to the inhibition of 1 UBAPA of trypsin. The specific activity of aprotinin is<br>
given in IUBAPA/mg polypeptide.<br>
Surface plasmon resonance assay<br>
The affinities of dimeric and trimeric aprotinin with various linkers are compared<br>
against the monomeric aprotinin using surface plasmon resonance assay, or BIAcore<br>
analysis (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ) with human plasmin as the target. Similarly,<br>
BIAcore assay with heparin as the target is used to analyze affinity between GAG<br>
binding aprotinin fusion proteins and heparin.<br>
When plasmin is used as the target, purified human plasmin (Sigma) is<br>
immobilized on the CMS chip according manufacturer's instructions (BIAcore,<br>
Piscataway, NJ). When heparin is the target, biotinylated albumin and albumin-heparin<br>
(Sigma) are captured on a streptavidin-coated BIAcore SA chip as described previously<br>
(Xiang Y and Moss B. (2003) J Virol 77:2623-2630).<br>
Example 2: Establishing improved tissue culture models for studies on influenza<br>
virus infection.<br>
Stocks of Influenza Viruses<br>
Influenza viral strains are obtained from ATCC and the repository at St. Jude<br>
Children's Research Hospital. All experiments involving influenza viruses are conducted<br>
at Bio-safety level II.<br>
Viruses are propagated by injection into the allantoic cavity of nine-day-old<br>
chicken embryos as described (Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV and Bukrinskaya AG.<br>
(1985) J Gen Virol 66:1633-1638). Alternatively, viral stocks are grown on Madin-<br>
Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented<br>
with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.5 micrograms of trypsin per ml. After<br>
54<br>
incubating for 48 to 72 hours, the culture medium is clarified by low speed<br>
centrifugation. Viral particles are pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose<br>
cushion. Purified viruses are suspended in 50% glycerol-O.lM Tris buffer (pH 7.3) and<br>
stored at -20°C.<br>
Plaque Assays<br>
Infectivity and titer of the viral stocks are determined by two kinds of plaque<br>
assays, a conventional one and a modified one (Tobita, K, Sugiura, A, Enomoto, C and<br>
Furuyama, M. (1975) Med Microbiol Immnuol 162:9-14; Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV<br>
and Bukrinskaya AG. (1982) Arch Virol 71:177-183). The conventional plaque assay is<br>
routinely used as a virus titration method. It requires exogenous trypsin in agar overlay<br>
added immediately after virus infection to MDCK monolayers (Tobita, K, Sugiura, A,<br>
Enomoto, C and Furuyama, M. (1975) Med Microbiol Immnuol 162:9-14). This method<br>
artificially increases infectivity of the viral stocks being tested by activating all the viral<br>
particles that have uncleaved HA.<br>
Zhirnov et. al. designed a modified plaque assay consisting of a double agar<br>
overlay, with trypsin being included in the second layer which is added 24 hours after<br>
infection (Zhirnov OP, Ovcharenko AV and Bukrinskaya AG. (1982) Arch Virol 71:177-<br>
183). Three days after infection, cells are fixed with a 10% formaldehyde solution,<br>
agarose layers are removed, fixed cells are stained with hematoxylin-eosin solution and<br>
plaques are counted. The modified plaque assay allows accurate determination of the real<br>
infectivity of viral stocks that contain both cleaved and uncleaved HA. Combining<br>
results from both conventional and modified plaque assays, one can distinguish viruses<br>
containing cleaved or uncleaved HA and correlate infectivity of viral stocks with the<br>
status of HA cleavage.<br>
Human Cell Culture Models<br>
1. Short-term culture of primary human epithelial cells. Conventional in vitro influenza<br>
virus infection is mostly carried out in MDCK cells with exogenous trypsin added to the<br>
culture medium. This is far from being physiological and is inappropriate for the work<br>
proposed here because trypsin is not the protease that activate influenza viruses in vivo.<br>
Very limited numbers of in vitro tissue culture models that are able to support the growth<br>
of influenza virus without an exogenous protease have been reported so far, those being<br>
primary cultures with primate cells of renal origin, cells lining the allantoic and aminiotic<br>
cavities of embryonated eggs, fetal tracheal ring organ cultures and primary human<br>
adenoid epithelial cells (Endo Y, Carroll KN, Ikizler MR and Wright PF. (1996) J Virol<br>
70:2055-2058). Among these, the latest work with primary human adenoid epithelial<br>
cells is the closest mimic of human conditions. In this case, Endo et. al. (Endo Y, Carroll<br>
KN, Ikizler MR and Wright PF. (1996) J Virol 70:2055-2058) isolated epithelial cells<br>
from surgical samples of human adenoids, and cultured the epithelial cells on a collagen<br>
matrix (Vitrogen 100, Celtrix Laboratories, Palo Alto, California) in Transwell inserts<br>
(Costar, Cambridge, Mass). Cells were maintained in 50% Ham's F12 and 50% Eagles<br>
minimal essential media with supplements of growth factors and trace elements. The cells<br>
reached confiuency in 10 to 14 days, remaining largely as a monolayer but with discrete<br>
patches of ciliated cells, which maintained regular ciliary activity for 1 to 3 weeks after<br>
reaching confluency. In this system, influenza A virus grew to a titer of 106 PFU/ml with<br>
a multiplicity of infection of 0.001 (Endo Y, Carroll KN, Ikizler MR and Wright PF.<br>
(1996) J Virol 70:2055-2058). Progressive cytopathogenic effects were also present<br>
during infection. The biggest drawback of this system is that it requires fresh human<br>
adenoid tissue.<br>
To solve this problem, primary human adenoid epithelial cells are replaced with<br>
primary human airway epithelial cells that are commercially available (Cambrex), and the<br>
cells are grown under the same conditions. Such short-term culture of primary human<br>
airway epithelial cells is relatively quick to establish and is useful as the first-line<br>
experimental model for most of the in vitro infection and antiviral experiments.<br>
2. Well-differentiated human airway epithelium (WD-HAE). In order to best mimic the<br>
in vivo condition of human airway, the model of well-differentiated human airway<br>
epithelium (WD-HAE) is used. WD-HAE is stratified epithelium that has all the<br>
differentiated cells of the normal human airway epithelium, including functional ciliated<br>
cells and mucus secreting cells. Therefore, in this model system influenza viruses are<br>
most likely to be activated by host proteases that are physiologically relevant. Although<br>
WD-HAE has been widely used to study respiratory viral infections, such as respiratory<br>
syncytial virus (RSV) Zhang L, Peeples ME, Boucher RC, Collins PL and Pickles RJ.<br>
(2002) J Virol 76:5654-5666) measles virus (Sinn PL, Williams G, Vongpunsawad S,<br>
Cattaneo R and McCray PB. (2002) J Virol 76:2403-2409, or human rhinovirus, it has<br>
not previously been used to study influenza viruses.<br>
A detailed protocol of WD-HAE has been described previously (Krunkosky TM,<br>
Fischer BM, Martin LD, Jones N, Akley NJ and Adler KB. (2000) Am JRespir Cell Mol<br>
Biol 22:685-692). Briefly, commercial primary human bronchial epithelial cells<br>
(Cambrex) are cultured on Transwell-clear culture inserts (Costar) that are thin-coated<br>
with rat-tail collagen I. Cells are cultured submerged for the first 5 to 7 days in medium<br>
containing a 1:1 mixture of bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM) (Cambrex)<br>
and DMEM with high glucose with supplement of growth factors (Krunkosky TM,<br>
Fischer BM, Martin LD, Jones N, Akley NJ and Adler KB. (2000) Am JRespir Cell Mol<br>
Biol 22:685-692). When cultures are 70% confluent (days 5 to 7), the air-liquid interface<br>
is created by removing the apical medium and exposing cells only to medium on their<br>
basal surface. Cells are cultured for additional 14 days in air-liquid interphase, for a total<br>
of 21 days in culture, and are then ready for experiments. The differentiated epithelium<br>
can be maintained in vitro for weeks.<br>
Epithelial morphology and degree of differentiation is documented by routine<br>
histology (Endo Y, Carroll KN, Ikizler MR and Wright PF. (1996) J Virol 70:2055-<br>
2058). Briefly, following fixation with 10% buffered formalin, the epithelial cells are<br>
embedded in paraffin, sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and with<br>
periodic acid-Schiff stain for mucus secreting cells.<br>
Influenza infection is carried out in the above two model systems by adding 0.001<br>
to 1 MOI of viruses to the differentiated cells. The titer and infectivity of viruses in the<br>
supernatant are followed over a period of 3 to 7 days. The level of influenza viral<br>
amplification and the infectivity of influenza viruses are evaluated using conventional<br>
and modified plaque assays.<br>
Example 3: Comparing functions of the aprotinin fusion proteins in vitro<br>
Anti-Viral Effects of Aprotinin Fusion Proteins<br>
1. Pre-infection treatment. Aprotinin fusion proteins are added to primary human<br>
cell cultures at various concentrations and allowed to incubate with the cells for 1 hour.<br>
The cells are washed with fresh medium and immediately inoculated with influenza<br>
viruses at MOI 0.01 to 1. Cells are washed again after 1 hour and cultured for 3 to 5<br>
days. Titer and infectivity of viruses in the supernatant are measured at various time<br>
points by two plaque assays. The cytopathic effect caused by viral infection is evaluated<br>
by staining viable cells with crystal violet and quantifying by measuring absorption at<br>
570 run at the end of the experiment. The percentage of cell protection by aprotinin<br>
fusion proteins is calculated by 100x{(aprotinin treated sample-untreated infected<br>
sample)/(uninfected control-untreated infected sample)}. The drug efficacy for cell<br>
protection is described by its Effective Concentration that achieves 50% of the cell<br>
protection (ECso). Since HA activation only occurs to newly released viral particles, the<br>
first round of viral infection occurs normally and viral titer rises in the first 24 hours after<br>
infection. However, starting from the second round, infectivity of viruses drops and viral<br>
titer gradually decreases as result of aprotinin treatment. Results from this experiment<br>
differentiate various types of different aprotinin fusion proteins by their efficacies in a<br>
single prophylactic treatment.<br>
Alternatively, timing of initial viral inoculation is altered from immediately after<br>
aprotinin treatment to 2-24 hours post treatment. Viral titer, infectivity and cytopathic<br>
effect are measured for 3 to 5 day after infection as described above. Results from these<br>
experiments distinguish various aprotinin fusion proteins by the lengths of the effective<br>
window after a single prophylactic treatment.<br>
2. Post-infection Treatment. For multi-dose treatment, cells are first infected by viral<br>
inoculations at 0.001 to 0.1 MOI for 1 hour. Various concentrations of aprotinin fusion<br>
proteins are added immediately afterwards, additional treatments are applied at 8-hour<br>
intervals during the first 48 hours post infection. Cells are cultured until day 7 post<br>
infection. Viral titer and infectivity in the media are followed during the whole process.<br>
Cytopathic effect is evaluated at the end of the experiment.<br>
For single dose treatment, cells are first infected by viral inoculations at 0.001 to<br>
0.1 MOI for 1 hour. Treatments of aprotinin fusion proteins at various concentrations are<br>
applied at different time points during the first 48 hours after infection, but each cell<br>
sample only receives one treatment during the whole experiment. Cells are cultured until<br>
day 7 post infection. Viral titer and infectivity in the media are followed during the<br>
whole process. Cytopathic effect is evaluated at the end of the experiment. Results from<br>
these experiments distinguish different types of aprotinin fusion proteins for their<br>
therapeutic potency.<br>
Inhibition of HA Cleavage by Aprotinin Fusion Proteins<br>
To demonstrate that aprotinin fusion proteins inhibit influenza viral infection by<br>
inhibiting cleavage of influenza HA protein, a human primary epithelial cell culture is<br>
infected with influenza virus at MOI of 1. Aprotinin fusion proteins are added to the<br>
culture either right before viral inoculation or immediately after the viral infection. At<br>
6.5 hour post infection, the culture is incubated for 1 hour in MEM lacking cold<br>
methionine and containing 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham) at a concentration of 100<br>
microCi/ml (pulse). Thereafter, the cells are washed twice with MEM containing a 10-<br>
fold concentration of cold methionine and incubated in MEM for additional 3 hours<br>
(chase). After labeling, cells are dissolved in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA)<br>
buffer, HA is precipitated by anti-serum against the particular strain of virus used for<br>
infection (anti-influenza sera can be obtained from ATCC and Center of Disease Control<br>
and Prevention), and immunocomplex is then purified by protein G-Sepharose<br>
(Amersham). Samples are fractionated by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. In<br>
samples untreated by aprotinin fusion proteins, HA1 and HA2 are expected to be the<br>
predominant HA species; while in aprotinin treated samples, HAO is expected to be the<br>
major type of HA present.<br>

sialidase proteins.<br>
Introduction<br>
Influenza viruses belong to the orthomyxoviridae family of RNA viruses. Both<br>
type A and type B viruses have 8 segmented negative-strand RNA genomes enclosed in a<br>
lipid envelope derived from the host cell. The viral envelope is covered with spikes that<br>
are composed of three proteins: hemagglutinin (HA), that attaches virus to host cell<br>
receptors and mediates fusion of viral and cellular membranes; neuraminidase (NA),<br>
which facilitates the release of the new viruses from the host cell; and a small number of<br>
M2 proteins that serve as ion channels. For Influenza A virus, HA and NA both undergo<br>
antigenic drift and antigenic shift, the viral subtypes are distinguished by serologic<br>
differences between their HA and NA proteins. There are total 15 types of HA (HI-HI 5)<br>
and 9 types of NA (N1-N9), but only three HA (H1-H3) and two NA (Nl and N2) have<br>
been found in human Influenza A virus so far (Granoff, A. &amp; Webster, R. G., ed.<br>
Encyclopedia of Virology, 2nd Edition, Vol 2). In contrast to Influenza A virus, no distinct<br>
antigenic subtypes are recognized for Influenza virus B.<br>
While Influenza B virus circulates only in humans, Influenza A virus can be<br>
isolated from a whole host of animals, such as pigs, horses, chickens, ducks and other<br>
kinds of birds, which accounts for genetic reassortment of Influenza A virus that results in<br>
antigenic shift. Wild aquatic birds are considered to be the primordial reservoir of all<br>
influenza viruses for avian and mammalian species. There is extensive evidence for<br>
transmission of the virus between aquatic birds and other species including pigs and<br>
horses and indirect transmission to humans through pigs. Direct transmission from pigs<br>
or chickens to humans has also been documented (Ito, T. (2000) Microbiol Immunol<br>
44(6):423-430).<br>
The host cell receptor for influenza viruses is the cell surface sialic acid. Sialic<br>
acids are a-keto acids with 9-carbon backbones that are usually found at the outermost<br>
positions of the oligosaccharide chains that are attached to glycoproteins and glycolipids.<br>
One of the major types of sialic acids is N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuSAc), which is the<br>
biosynthetic precursor for most of the other types. Two major linkages between NeuSAc<br>
and the penultimate galactose residues of carbohydrate side chains are found in nature,<br>
NeuSAc a(2,3)-Gal and NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gal. Both NeuSAc a(2,3)-Gal and NeuSAc<br>
a(2,6)-Gal molecules can be recognized by Influenza A virus as the receptor (Schauer, R.<br>
(1982) Adv. Carbohydrate Chem &amp; Biochem 40:131-235), while human viruses seem to<br>
prefer NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gal, avian and equine viruses predominantly recognize NeuSAc<br>
a(2,3)-Gal (Ito, T. (2000) Microbiol Immunol 44(6):423-430).<br>
Infections by influenza type A and B viruses are typically initiated at the mucosal<br>
surface of the upper respiratory tract. Viral replication is primarily limited to the upper<br>
respiratory tract but can extend to the lower respiratory tract and causes<br>
bronchopneumonia that can be fatal. The risk of death is one per 10,000 infections, but is<br>
significantly greater for high-risk groups with pre-existing cardiopulmonary conditions<br>
and for immunologically nai've individuals during a pandemic.<br>
A therapeutic compound comprising a sialidase that can effectively degrade both<br>
receptor sialic acids, NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gal and NeuSAc a(2,3)-Gal, can confer protection<br>
against the broadest range of influenza viruses, including animal viruses. It can also<br>
remain effective as the viral strains change yearly. Because sialidase targets the host cell<br>
rather than virus and acts at the "choking point" in a viral life cycle, generation of<br>
resistant virus is improbable. Protein-bound sialic acid rums over homogeneously on cell<br>
surface with half-life of 33 hours (Kreisel, W, Volk, BA, Buchsel, R. and Reutter, W.<br>
(1980) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 77:1828-1831). Therefore we estimate that once-a-day or<br>
twice-a-day administration of a sialidase would confer sufficient protection against<br>
influenza.<br>
Sialidases are found in higher eukaryotes, as well as in some mostly pathogenic<br>
microbes, including viruses, bacteria and protozoans. Viral and bacterial sialidases have<br>
been well characterized, and the three-dimensional structures of some of them have been<br>
determined (Crennell, SJ, Garman, E, Laver, G, Vimr, E and Taylor, G. (1994) Structure<br>
2:535-544; Janakiraman, MN, White, CL, Laver, WG, Air, GM and Luo, M. (1994)<br>

S, Elsliger, M, Qu, J, Leclerc, D, Gravel, R, Dallaire, L and Potier, M. (1997) Nature<br>
Genet 15: 316-320). Several human sialidases have also been cloned in the recent years<br>
(Milner, CM, Smith, SV, Carrillo MB, Taylor, GL, Hollinshead, M and Campbell, RD.<br>
 (1997) JBio Chem 272:4549-4558; Monti, E, Preti, A, Nesti, C, Ballabio, A and Borsani<br>
G. 1999. Glycobiol 9:1313-1321; Wada, T, Yoshikawa, Y, Tokuyama, S, Kuwabara, M,<br>
Akita, H and Miyagi, T. (1999) Biochem Biophy Res Communi 261:21-27; Monti, E,<br>

Ballabio, A, Tettamanti, G and Borsani, G. (2000) Bichem J 349:343-351). All the<br>
sialidases characterized share a four amino acid motif in the amino terminal portion<br>
followed by the Asp box motif which is repeated three to five times depending on the<br>
protein. (Monti, E, Bassi, MT, Papini, N, Riboni, M, Manzoni, M, Veneranodo, B, Croci,<br>
G, Preti, A, Ballabio, A, Tettamanti, G and Borsani, G. (2000) Bichem 7349:343-351;<br>
Copley, RR, Russell, RB and Ponting, CP. (2001) Protein Sci 10:285-292). While the<br>
overall amino acid identity of the sialidase superfamily is relatively low at about 20-30%,<br>
the overall fold of the molecules, especially the catalytic amino acids, are remarkably<br>
similar (Wada, T, Yoshikawa, Y, Tokuyama, S, Kuwabara, M, Akita, H and Miyagi, T.<br>
(1999) Biochem Biophy Res Communi 261:21-27; Monti, E, Bassi, MT, Papini, N,<br>
Riboni, M, Manzoni, M, Veneranodo, B, Croci, G, Preti, A, Ballabio, A, Tettamanti, G<br>
and Borsani, G. (2000) Bichem J 349:343-351; Copley, RR, Russell, RB and Ponting,<br>
CP. (2001) Protein Sci 10:285-292).<br>
The sialidases are generally divided into two families: "small" sialidases have<br>
molecular weight of about 42 kDa and do not require divalent metal ion for maximal<br>
activity; "large" sialidases have molecular weight above 65 kDa and may require divalent<br>
metal ion for activity (Wada, T, Yoshikawa, Y, Tokuyama, S, Kuwabara, M, Akita, H<br>
and Miyagi, T. (1999) Biochem Biophy Res Communi 261:21-27; Monti, E, Bassi, MT,<br>
Papini, N, Riboni, M, Manzoni, M, Veneranodo, B, Croci, G, Preti, A, Ballabio, A,<br>
Tettamanti, G and Borsani, G. (2000) Bichem J349:343-351; Copley, RR, Russell, RB<br>
and Ponting, CP. (2001) Protein Sci 10:285-292).<br>
Over fifteen sialidase proteins have been purified and they vary greatly from one<br>
another in substrate specificities and enzymatic kinetics. To confer a broad-spectrum<br>
protection against influenza viruses, a sialidase needs to effectively degrade sialic acid in<br>
both a(2,6)-Gal and a(2,3)-Gal linkages and in the context of glycoproteins and some<br>
glycolipids. Viral sialidases, such as those from influenza A virus, fowl plague virus and<br>
Newcastle disease virus, are generally specific for NeuSAc a(2,3)-Gal and only degrade<br>
NeuSAc a(2,6)-Gal very inefficiently. Small bacterial sialidases generally react poorly to<br>
sialic acid in the context of glycoproteins and glycolipids. By contrast, large bacterial<br>
sialidases can effectively cleave sialic acid in both (a,2-6) linkage and (a,2-3) linkage in<br>
the context of most natural substrates (Figure 4; Vimr, DR. (1994) Trends Microbiol 2:<br>
271-277; Drzeniek, R. (1973) HistochemJ5:271-290; Roggentin, P, Kleineidam, RG and<br>
Schauer, R. (1995) Biol Chem Hoppe-Seyler 376:569-575; Roggentin, P, Schauer, R,<br>
Hoyer, LL and Vimr, ER. (1993) Mol Microb 9:915-921). Because of their broad<br>
substrate specificities, large bacterial sialidases are better candidates.<br>
Among the large bacterial sialidases with known substrate specificity shown in<br>
Figure 4, Vibrio cholerae sialidase requires Ca2+ for activity making it less preferred.<br>
More preferred sialidases include the 71 kDa enzyme from Clostridiumperfringens, the<br>
113 kDa enzyme from Actinomyces viscosus and sialidase of Arthrobacter ureafaciens.<br>
A third sialidase, the 68 kDa enzyme from Micromonospora viridifaciens, has been<br>
known to destroy influenza viral receptor (Air, GM and Laver, WG. (1995) Virology<br>
211:278-284), and is also a candidate.<br>
These enzymes have high specific activity (600 U/mg protein for C. perfringens<br>
(Corfield, AP, Veh, RW, Wember, M, Michalski, JC and Schauer, R. (1981) Bichem J<br>
197:293-299) and 680 U/mg protein for A. viscosus (Teufel, M, Roggentin, P. and<br>
Schauer, R. (1989) Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler 370:435-443)), are fully active without<br>
divalent metal iron, and have been cloned and purified as recombinant proteins from E.<br>
coli (Roggentin, P, Kleineidam, RG and Schauer, R. (1995) Biol Chem Hoppe-Seyler<br>
376:569-575, Teufel, M, Roggentin, P. and Schauer, R. (1989) Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler<br>
370:435-443 , Sakurada, K, Ohta, T and Hasegawa, M. (1992) J Bacterial 174: 6896-<br>
6903). In addition, C. perfringens is stable in solution at 2-8°C for several weeks, and at<br>
4°C in the presence of albumin for more than two years (Wang, FZ, Akula, SM, Pramod,<br>
NP, Zeng, L and Chandran, B. (2001) J Virol 75:7517-27). A. viscosus is labile towards<br>
freezing and thawing, but is stable at 4°C in 0.1 M acetate buffer, pH 5 (Teufel, M,<br>
Roggentin, P. and Schauer, R. (1989) Biol Chem Hoppe Seyler 370:435-443).<br>
Although the chances of inducing immune reactions using bacterial sialidases is<br>
very low because the proteins will be used topically in the upper respiratory tract and will<br>
not be absorbed systemically a human enzyme would be more desirable for long-term use<br>
in human subjects.<br>
Four sialidase genes have been cloned from human so far: NEUl/G9/lysosomal<br>
sialidase (Pshezhetsky, A, Richard, C, Michaud, L, Igdoura, S, Wang, S, Elsliger, M, Qu,<br>
J, Leclerc, D, Gravel, R, Dallaire, L and Potier, M. (1997) Nature Genet 15: 316-320.<br>
, Milner, CM, Smith, SV, Carrillo MB, Taylor, GL, Hollinshead, M and Campbell, RD.<br>
(1997). JBio Chem 272:4549-4558); NEU3, a membrane-associated sialidase isolated<br>
from human brain (Wada, T, Yoshikawa, Y, Tokuyama, S, Kuwabara, M, Akita, H and<br>
Miyagi, T. (1999) Biochem Biophy Res Communi 261:21-27, Monti, E, Bassi, MT,<br>
Papini, N, Riboni, M, Manzoni, M, Veneranodo, B, Croci, G, Preti, A, Ballabio, A,<br>
Tettamanti, G and Borsani, G. (2000) Bichem J349:343-351), NEU2 a 42 kDa sialidase<br>
expressed in human skeletal muscle at a very low level (Monti, E, Preti, A, Nesti, C,<br>
Ballabio, A and Borsani G. (1999) Glycobiol 9:1313-1321), and NEU4 a 497 amino acid<br>
protein (Genbank NM080741) expressed in all human tissues examined (Monti, E, Preti,<br>
A, Venerando, B and Borsani, G. (2002) Neurochem Res 27:646-663).<br>
Amino acid sequence comparison reveals NEU2 (SEQ ID NO:8) and NEU4<br>
(SEQ ID NO:9) are both cytosolic sialidases. 9 out of 12 of the amino acid residues<br>
which form the catalytic site of S. typhimurium sialidase are conserved in both NEU2 and<br>
NEU4 (Monti, E, Preti, A, Nesti, C, Ballabio, A and Borsani G. (1999) Glycobiol 9:1313-<br>
1321, Figure 3). In addition, NEU4 also shows a stretch of about 80 amino acid residues<br>
(aa 294-373) that appears unique among known mammalian sialidases (Monti, E, Preti,<br>
A, Venerando, B and Borsani, G. (2002) Neurochem Res 27:646-663). Unlike the<br>
selected large bacterial sialidases, the substrate specificity of NEU2 and NEU4 is<br>
unknown. It will need to be tested if NEU2 and NEU4 can effectively degrade the<br>
influenza virus receptors.<br>
Sialidase assay<br>
NEU2, NEU4 and M. viridifaciens enzymes will be stored in PBS and 50%<br>
glycerol at -20°C. C. perfringens and A. viscosus enzymes are stored in lOmM acetate<br>
buffer (pH5) at 4°C. Protein preps are characterized by HPLC and SDS-PAGE<br>
electrophoresis. Specific activities and stability of the enzymes will be monitored by<br>
sialidase assay.<br>
The enzymatic activity of sialidases are determined by fluorimetric 2'-(4-<br>
methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid) (4Mu-NANA) (Sigma) as the<br>
substrate. Specifically, reactions are set up in duplicate in 0.1 M Na citrate/phosphate<br>
buffer pH5.6, in the presence of 400 micrograms bovine serum albumin, with 0.2 mM<br>
4MU-NANA in a final volume of 100 microliters, and incubated at 37°C for 5-10min.<br>
Reactions are stopped by addition of 1 ml of 0.2 M glycines/NaOH pH10.2. Fluorescence<br>
emission is measured on a fluorometer with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 445 nm,<br>
using 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to obtain a calibration curve.<br>

1. Stocks of Influenza Viruses<br>
Influenza viral strains are obtained from the ATCC and the repository at St. Jude<br>
Children's Research Hospital.Viral stocks are grown on Madin-Darby canine kidney<br>
(MDCK) cells in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.3% bovine<br>
serum albumin and 0.5 micrograms of trypsin per ml. After incubating for 48 to 72<br>
hours, the culture medium is clearified by low speed centrifugation. Viral particles are<br>
pelleted by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion. Purified viruses are<br>
suspended in 50% glycerol-O.lM Tris buffer (pH 7.3) and stored at -20°C. Viral titer is<br>
determined by plaque assay (Tobita, K, Sugiura, A, Enomoto, C and Furuyama, M.<br>
(1975) Med Microbiol Immnuol 162: 9-14), or TCIDso, which is the dose of virus<br>
required to infect 50% of the MDCK cells.<br>
Selected human and animal influenza A strains with specificity towards NeuSAc<br>
alpha(2,6)-Gal or NeuSAc alpha(2,3)-Gal and have high affinity to the receptors<br>
(measured by high hemagglutination activity) are chosen for in vitro tests:<br>
1. Strains that recognize receptor NeuSAc alpha(2,6)-Gal include human isolates<br>
A/aichi/2/68, A/Udorn/307/72, A/Prot Chaimers/1/73 and A/Victoria/3/75, etc.<br>
 (Connor, RJ, Kawaoka, Y, Webster, RG and Paulson JC. (1994) Virology 205:17-<br>
23).<br>
2. Strains that have NeuSAc alpha(2,3)-Gal specificity include animal isolates<br>
A/duckUkraine/1/63, A/duckMemphis/928/74, A/duckhokk/5/77,<br>
A/Eq/Miami/1/63, A/Eq/Ur/1/63, A/Eq/Tokyo/71, A/Eq/Prague/71, etc (Connor,<br>
RJ, Kawaoka, Y, Webster, RG and Paulson JC. (1994) Virology 205:17-23).<br>
2; Hemagglutination Assay<br>
This assay is used to rapidly determine the efficiency of each enzyme to destroy<br>
receptors NeuSAc alpha(2,6)-Gal and NeuSAc alpha(2,3)-Gal.<br>
Specifically, 6 ml of Chicken red blood cells (SPAFAS Inc., Norwich, CT) are<br>
diluted in two times the volume of PBS, centrifuge for 5 min at 500 x g and re-suspended<br>
in PBS of original volume. Sialidases are added to the chicken erythrocytes at various<br>
concentrations and allowed to incubate at room temperature for 30 min. The cells are<br>
then washed three times to remove sialidase proteins, and then are resuspended in PBS to<br>
6 ml. Control cells are incubated with BSA and washed. Various strains of influenza<br>
virus, which recognize either NeuSAc alpha(2,6)-Gal or NeuSAc salpha(2,3)-Gal as the<br>
receptor as listed above, are prepared in microtiter plates as serial dilutions in PBS (100<br>
microliters) of the original viral stocks. Sialidase-treated or control chicken red blood cell<br>
suspensions (100 microliters of the 0.5% solution prepared above) are added to each well<br>
at 4°C. The plates are read after 2 h. The lowest concentration of virus that causes the<br>
blood cell to agglutinate is defined as one hemagglutination unit. We will be looking for<br>
enzymes that effectively abolish hemagglutination by all viral strains.<br>
3. Viral Inhibition Assay<br>
Confluent monolayers of MDCK cells are treated with various concentrations of<br>
sialidases for 1 h, washed twice with buffer, then infected with various strains of<br>
influenza virus. After incubation for 1 hr, the cells are washed again to remove unbound<br>
virus. To estimate the decrease in viral binding sites on cell surface, the cells are overlaid<br>
with agar and incubated at 37°C. The number of plaques in the sialidase treated cells will<br>
be compared against those in control cells. Alternatively, the cells will be cultured in<br>
regular medium at 37°C, and viral titers in the culture media are measured at various time<br>
during culture as TCID5o.<br>
To demonstrate that sialidase treatment can inhibit a pre-existing infection,<br>
MDCK monolayers are first infected with a low titer of virus. After washing off the<br>
unbound virus, the cells are then cultured in the presence of a sialidase. Fresh sialidase is<br>
added to cell culture very 24 h. Viral titer in the cultured medium is measured over a 72-<br>
hour period.<br>
4. Cytotoxicity assay<br>
Primary human bronchial epithelial cells are purchased (Clonetics) and cultured in<br>
supplemented minimal medium following manufacture's instruction. Sialidases are added<br>
to the culture medium at various concentrations. Cell growth over a period of 7-10 days<br>
will be measured. Cells will also be observed regularly for microscopic cytopathic<br>
effects.<br>
Example 6: Constructing and testing sialidase fusion proteins.<br>
1. Choosing a GAG-binding sequence as the anchoring domain.<br>
One sialidase is selected for its best overall properties, including anti-viral<br>
activity, toxicity, stability, ease of production, etc. We will then genetically link it to a<br>
GAG-binding sequence, sub-clone the fusion genes into pQE vector, express and purify<br>
the fusion proteins from E. coli.<br>
We have selected six possible human GAG-binding sequences: PF4 (aa 47-70)<br>
(SEQ ID NO:2), IL-8 (aa 46-72) (SEQ ID NO:3), AT III (aa 118-151) (SEQ ID NO:4),<br>
ApoE (aa 132-165) (SEQ ID NO:5), amphiregulin (aa 25-45) (SEQ ID NO:6), and<br>
human angio-associated migratory cell protein (AAMP) (aa 14-25) (SEQ ID NO:7)<br>
(Figure 2). These sequences generally bind to heparin with nanomolar-level affinities;<br>
however, their affinities may vary from one another by an order of magnitude (Table 1).<br>
Since it is not clear which anchoring domain will enable the most effective functioning of<br>
the sialidase, all four GAG-binding sequences are fused with the sialidase gene either on<br>
the N terminus or the C terminus via a generic linker sequence GGGGS as the following<br>
constructs:<br>
(GAG binding domain— GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10) —Sialidase); or<br>
(Sialidase—GGGGS(SEQ ID NO: 10)—GAG binding domain)<br>
Different fusion proteins are compared by a modified viral inhibition assay.<br>
Specifically, confluent monolayers of MDCK cells are treated with same amount of each<br>
fusion protein for a limited duration, such as 30 min. The cells are then washed twice<br>
with buffer to remove unbound sialidase fusion proteins, and incubated in culture<br>
medium for an additional 1 hour. Afterwards, strains of influenza virus are added to the<br>
cells for 1 hr and then cells are washed again to remove unbound virus. Viral titers in the<br>
culture media are measured during 72-h cultures as TCIDjo. The un-fused sialidase<br>
protein will be used to compare against the fusion proteins in this assay. If the results are<br>
too close to rank all fusion proteins, we will make the assay more stringent by shortening<br>
treatment window for the fusion proteins, lowering protein concentrations and increasing<br>
the level of viral challenge.<br>
2. Optimizing the fusion protein construct<br>
After selecting the best fusion protein from the earlier experiments, the construct<br>
is further optimized by testing different linker length. In this regard, the following<br>
constructs are made:<br>
(Sialidase— (GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10))n (n=0, 1, 2, 3, or 4) —GAG binding domain)<br>
The proteins are expressed and purified and compared in the modified viral protection<br>
assay as described above.<br>
In addition, if earlier data indicate that higher affinity of the fusion protein<br>
towards heparan sulfate brings better potency, we also plan to test if the potency can be<br>
further improved by increasing the GAG-binding affinity. This can be achieved by<br>
creating a multivalent GAG binding mechanism in the fusion protein in constructs like<br>
these:<br>
 (Sialidase—(GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10))n—HS binding domain—GAG binding domain);<br>
or:<br>
(GAG binding domain—(GGGGS(SEQ ID NO :10))n—Sialidase—<br>
(GGGGS(SEQ ID NO:10))n—GAG binding domain)<br>
The purified fusion proteins are ranked based on their activities in the modified<br>
viral protection assay as described above.<br>
3. Cytotoxicity assay<br>
The effects of the fusion proteins on normal cell growth and morphology are<br>
monitored by culturing primary human bronchial epithelial cells with various<br>
concentrations of the fusion proteins and following growth curve of the cells and<br>
observing any microscopic cytopathic effects.<br>
Example 7: Fusion Proteins against Other Infectious Microbes<br>
Fusion proteins composed of a functional domain and an anchorage domain are<br>
designed for many more different applications. For example, a sialidase fusion protein as<br>
proposed here can also be used as a therapeutic/prophylatictic agent against infections by<br>
other viruses and bacteria besides influenza viruses, because many other infectious<br>
microbes, such as paramyxoviruses (Wassilewa, L. (1977) Arch Virol 54:299-305),<br>
coronaviruses (Vlasak, R., Luytjes, W., Spaan, W. and Palese, P. (1988) ProcNatl Acad<br>
Sci USA 85:4526-4529), rotaviruses (Fukudome, K., Yoshie, O. and Konno, T. (1989)<br>
Virology 172:196-205) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ramphal, R. and Pyle, M. (1983)<br>
Infect Immun 41:339-44) etc, are also known to use sialic acid as cellular receptors. For<br>
example, aprotinin fused with a heparin-binding domain can make a fusion protein that<br>
be used to prevent/treat infection of other viruses besides influenza that require host<br>
serine proteases for activation, such as parainfluenza virus.<br>
Example 8: Cloning Sialidase Catalytic Domain Fusion Proteins<br>
According to the published literature on the large bacterial sialidases, the 51 kDa<br>
Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase, the 71 kDa sialidase from Clostridium perfringens and<br>
the 113 kDa sialidase from Actinomyces viscosus seem to have similar specific activities<br>
and broad substrate specificity toward various sialic acid conjugates (Biology of the Sialic<br>
Acids (1995) , 270-273; Corfield et al., Biochem. 1,(1981) 197(2), 293-299; Roggentin<br>
et al., Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler, (1995) 376(9), 569-575; Teufel et al., Biol. Chem.<br>
Hoppe Seyler, (1989) 370(5), 435-443). A third sialidase, the 68 kDa enzyme from<br>
Micromonospora viridifaciens, was also known to destroy the influenza viral receptor (Air<br>
and Laver, Virology, (1995) 211(1), 278-284; (1995) , 270-273).<br>
A. viscosus is part of the normal flora of human oral cavity and gastrointestinal<br>
tract (Sutler, Rev. Infect. Dis., (1984) 6 Suppl 1, S62-S66). Since the sialidase from A.<br>
viscosus is normally secreted by the bacterium hosted on human mucosal surface, it<br>
should be tolerated by the human mucosal immune system. Therefore, it is unlikely that<br>
A. viscosus sialidase will be immunogenic when delivered topically to the human airway<br>
surface. We think that this feature makes A. viscosus sialidase a good candidate for a<br>
therapeutic agent.<br>
We determined that a fragment of the A. viscosus sialidase, extending from amino<br>
acid 274 to amino acid 667, should contain the catalytic domain (referred to as AvCD) of<br>
the sialidase and should be fully active on it own. We later cloned the AvCD fragment<br>
and demonstrated that this AvCD fragment and other A. viscosus sialidase fragments<br>
comprising at least amino acids 290-666 of the A. viscosus sialidase protein sequence<br>
(SEQ ID NO:12), such as the fragment extending from amino acid 274 to amino acid<br>
681, the fragment extending from amino acid 274 to amino acid 666, the fragment<br>
extending from amino acid 290 to amino acid 666, and the fragment extending from<br>
amino acid 290 to amino acid 681, have sialidase activity.<br>
The complete sequence of A. viscosus sialidase protein and gene were obtained<br>
from GenBank (A49227 and L06898). Based on homology with sialidases with known<br>
3D structures (M. viridifaciens and S. typhimurium), we assigned the catalytic domain<br>
(CD) sequence to be located between amino acids 274-667 (SEQ ID NO:16). To clone<br>
the catalytic domain of A. viscosus sialidase (AvCD), this region of the A. viscosus<br>
sialidase gene was engineered with codons optimized for expression in E.coli (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 15). The codon-optimized AvCD nucleotide sequence encoding amino acids 274-667<br>
of the A. viscosus sialidase (SEQ ID NO: 15) was produced by chemical synthesis of<br>
overlapping oligonucleotides which were annealed, amplified by PCR and cloned into the<br>
expression vector pTrc99a (Amersham, New Jersey, USA).<br>
Sialidase fusion constructs were made using standard molecular cloning methods.<br>
The Hise-AR construct was made by fusing six histidines (Hisg) to the N-terminal residue<br>
of the AvCD sequence. The Hise-AvCD construct has the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 17 and translated amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 18. These sequences are<br>
depicted in Figure 7.<br>
To make the AR-AvCD construct, an anchoring domain was directly fused with<br>
the N-terminal residue of the AvCD sequence. The anchoring domain, referred to as AR,<br>
was derived from the GAG binding sequence of human amphiregulin precursor (GenBank<br>
# AAH09799). Nucleotide sequences encoding amino acids 125 to 145 (Figure 2, SEQ<br>
ID NO:7) of the human amphiregulin precursor were synthesized chemically as two<br>
overlapping oligonucleotides. The AR-AvCD construct has the nucleotide sequence of<br>
SEQ ID NO:19 and translated amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:20.<br>
Another construct, AR-G4S-AvCD, was made by fusing the same AR-encoding<br>
sequence used in the AR-AvCD construct with a sequence encoding a five-amino-acid<br>
linker (GGGGS; SEQ ID NO: 10) which then was fused with the AvCD sequence such<br>
that in a translation product, the linker was fused to N-terminus of the catalytic domain of<br>
the A. viscosus sialidase. The nucleotide sequence (SEQ ID NO:34) and translated amino<br>
acid sequence (SEQ ID NO:35) of this construct are depicted in Figure 9. All constructs<br>
were cloned into the pTrc99a expression vector.<br>
In addition, four constructs were made in which the catalytic domain of the A.<br>
viscosus sialidase was fused to the N-terminus of the AR (GAG-binding domain of human<br>
amphiregulin; SEQ ID NO:7). In Construct #4 (SEQ ID NO:27), the catalytic domain of<br>
the A. viscosus sialidase consisted of amino acids 274-666 of SEQ ID NO:12 fused to the<br>
GAG-binding domain of amphiregulin (SEQ ID NO:7). In Construct #5 (SEQ ID<br>
NO:29), the catalytic domain of the A. viscosus sialidase consisted of amino acids 274-<br>
681 of SEQ ID NO: 12 fused to the GAG-binding domain of amphiregulin (SEQ ID<br>
NO:7). In Construct #6 (SEQ ID NO:31), the catalytic domain of the A. viscosus<br>
sialidase consisted of amino acids 290-666 of SEQ ID NO:12 fused to the GAG-binding<br>
domain of amphiregulin (SEQ ID NO:7). In Construct #7 (SEQ ID NO:33), the catalytic<br>
domain of the A. viscosus sialidase consisted of amino acids 290-681 of SEQ ID NO:12<br>
fused to the GAG-binding domain of amphiregulin (SEQ ID NO:7). All of these<br>
constructs displayed comparable sialidase activity in assays.<br>
Example 9: Production of Sialidase Catalytic Domain Fusion Proteins<br>
To produce the sialidase fusion proteins, the expression constructs were<br>
transformed into E.coli BL21. A single colony was inoculated into 2.5 ml of LB broth<br>
and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking. In the morning 2 ml of overnight culture was<br>
inoculated into 500 ml of TB medium in a 2 liter shake flask and the culture was allowed<br>
to grow to OD6oo=4.0 (2-4 hours) at 37°C with shaking. Protein expression was induced<br>
by addition of IPTG to a final concentration of 1 mM and continued for 3 hr with<br>
shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000xg for 10 min. Cell were washed<br>
once (resuspended in PBS and recentrifuged) and resuspended in 15 ml of Lysis buffer.<br>

20 ml of 20% glucose (filter sterilized)<br>
Lysis buffer<br>
50 mM phosphate, pH 8.0<br>
10% glycerol<br>
300 mM NaCl<br>
Bacterial cells suspended in lysis buffer were lysed by sonication and cell debris<br>
was removed by centrifugation. Clarified lysate was passed through an SP-Sepharose<br>
column (bed volume 15 ml, flow rate 120 cm/hour). The column was reconditioned to<br>
lower pH and salt with one volume of PBS to ensure good retention of Fludase during<br>
endotoxin removal. Endotoxin was removed by washing the column with 5 volumes of<br>
PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Sodium Deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS. The<br>
detergents were washed away with 3 volumes of PBS and 3 volumes of lysis buffer.<br>
Proteins were eluted from the column with lysis buffer that contained 0.8 M NaCl. The<br>
fraction eluted from SP-Sepharose was adjusted to 1.9 M (NH^SC^ (most contaminating<br>
proteins are salted out at this step) and clarified by centrifugation. The supernatant was<br>
loaded onto Butyl-Sepharose column (flow rate 120 cm/hour). The column was washed<br>
with 2 volumes of 1.3 M (NH4)2SO4 and the fusion was eluted with 0.65 M (NH4)2SO4.<br>
For the final step, size exclusion chromatography was performed on Sephacryl S-200<br>
equilibrated with PBS buffer at a flow rate of 25 cm/hour. Sialidase activity was<br>
determined against 4-MU-NANA as described in the following paragraph. Protein<br>
concentration was determined using Bio-Rad's Bradford kit. Protein purity was assessed<br>
by SDS-PAGE and estimated to be &gt;98%. Specific activity of the enzyme was about 937<br>
U/mg. Endotoxin in final preparations was measured using LAL test (Cambrex) and<br>
estimated to be 
For purification of His6 containing fusion protein, cation exchange on SPSepharose<br>
was replaced with Metal Chelate Affinity Chromatography on Ni-NTA. All<br>
buffers remained the same with the exception that elution from Ni-NTA was performed<br>
by 0.25 M imidazole in lysis buffer.<br>
Example 10: Sialidase Assay to Measure Activity of Sialidase Catalytic Domain<br>
Fusion Proteins<br>
The sialidase activity of the AR-AvCD protein encoded by Construct #2 was<br>
assayed and compared with that of native sialidases purfied from C. perfringens (Sigma,<br>
St. Louis, MO) and A. ureafaciens (Prozyme, San Leandro, CA). In addition, a fusion<br>
protein produced from a construct in which the amphiregulin GAG sequence (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 7) was fused to the Neu 2 human sialidase (SEQ ID NO:8) was also assayed for<br>
sialidase activity.<br>
The sialidase activity expressed as units per mg sialidase was measured by the<br>
sialidase assay using the artificial fluorogenic substrate 4-MU-NANA (Sigma). One unit<br>
of sialidase is defined as the amount of enzyme that releases 10 nmol of MU from 4-MUNANA<br>
in 10 min at 37°C (50 mM CH3COOH - NaOH buffer, pH 5.5) in reaction that<br>
contains 20 nmol of 4-MU-NANA in a 0.2 ml volume. Reactions are stopped by addition<br>
of 1 ml of 0.2 M glycine/NaOH pH 10.2. Fluorescence emission is measured on a<br>
fluorometer with excitation at 365 nm and emission at 445 nm, using 4-<br>
methylumbelliferone (4-MU) to obtain a calibration curve (Potier et al., Anal. Biochem.,<br>
(1979) 94(2), 287-296).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Our results show that the AvCD fusion protein (AR-AvCD) has the highest<br>
specific activity among all the tested sialidases (Table 2). The specific activity of ARAvCD<br>
is over 100 times higher than that of a human sialidase fusion (AR-NEU2), and<br>
over two times higher than that of C. perfringens sialidase. Experimental results<br>
comparing the stability of the sialidases indicate very high stability of AR-AvCD: No<br>
loss of activity for AR-AvCD was detected after 20 weeks at 25°C or 4°C in solution. By<br>
comparison, AR-NEU2 solution exhibited a half-life of 5 and 2 weeks when stored at<br>
25°C and 37°C, respectively.<br>
Example 11: Optimization of the N-terminus ofSialidase Catalytic Domain Fusion<br>
Proteins<br>
The N-terminus of the AR-AvCD fusion protein was partially cleaved under<br>
certain conditions that resulted in small degrees of protein heterogeneity in the purified<br>
AR-AvCD prep. To solve this problem, we designed an approach to optimize the Nterminus<br>
of the sialidase fusion construct. A library containing AR-AvCD with random<br>
amino acids at the N-terminus was constructed as follows. AR-AvCD was amplified by<br>
PCR using a primer pair in which the primer annealing on 5'-end of the gene contained a<br>
randomized sequence in positions corresponding to amino acids 2 and 3. The nucleotide<br>
sequence of the primer and the encoded amino acid sequence are shown below.<br>
ttttcgtctcccatgvnnvnnaagcgcaaaaaaaaaggcggca (SEQ ID NO:21)<br>
MetXxxXxxLysArgLysLysLysGlyGly (SEQ ID NO:22)<br>
In SEQ ID NO:21, "n" stands for any nucleotide (a, c, g, or t) and "v" stands for<br>
nucleotides a, g or c. By designing the sequence in such a way (disallowing the<br>
nucleotide t in the first position of codons) we avoided introduction of stop codons as<br>
well as aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp) and Cys. The Espll restriction endonuclease<br>
site (shown in bold) was introduced to allow generation of Ncol compatible overhang.<br>
The primer annealing to 3'-end of the gene carried Hindlll site following the stop codon.<br>
The PCR product was digested with Esp3l - Hindlll was ligated into pTrc99a expression<br>
vector digested with Ncol - Hindlll. The ligation mix was transformed into E.coli and the<br>
cells were grown overnight in liquid culture containing Ampicillin.<br>
The next day the culture was diluted with fresh medium, grown to ODeoo-O.S and<br>
induced with IPTG for 2 hours. Cells were harvested, homogenized and the fusions were<br>
subjected to two-step purification by liquid chromatography. Clarified lysate was loaded<br>
onto SP-Sepharose equilibrated with lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.3 M NaCl,<br>
10% glycerol). The column was washed with 0.45 M NaCl and the fusions were eluted<br>
with 0.9 M NaCl. The eluate was diluted with 10% glycerol to bring the concentration of<br>
NaCl to 0.2 M and loaded onto Heparin-Sepharose column. The column was developed<br>
with a linear gradient of NaCl. The fractions that contained sialidase activity were<br>
resolved on SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto PVDF membrane and the 43 kDa band was<br>
subjected to amino-terminal sequencing.<br>
The predominant N-terminal residues of the isolated sialidase fusion protein were<br>
either Val or Gly followed by the N-terminal residues of the AR tag. We then<br>
synthesized new sialidase fusion constructs, Constructs #2 and #3, by introducing a Val<br>
in front of the AR sequence such that the first six amino acids encoded by Constructs #2<br>
and #3 were (Met-Val-Lys-Arg-Lys-Lys (SEQ ID NO:23)). N-terminal sequencing of<br>
proteins made from these new fusion constructs showed 100% homogeneity with the<br>
initiation Met being completely removed (which is desirable for therapeutic proteins) and<br>
Val being the first N-terminal residue followed by the AR tag sequence. These data are<br>
consistent with earlier publications that reported the common rules of N-terminal<br>
processing and protein stability as function of protein's N-terminal amino acid residue<br>
(Hirel et al., PfOC. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A, (1989) 86(21), 8247-8251; Varshavsky,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A, (1996) 93(22), 12142-12149).<br>
The nucleotide sequences of new fusion Construct #2 (AR-AvCD with optimized<br>
N-terminus) (SEQ ID NO:24) and its amino acid sequence translation (SEQ ID NO:25)<br>
is depicted in Figure 10. The nucleotide sequences of new fusion Construct #3 (ARG4S-<br>
AvCD with optimized N-terminus) (SEQ ID NO:36) and its amino acid sequence<br>
translation (SEQ ID NO:37) is depicted in Figure 11. The amino acid sequence of<br>
processed proteins isolated from E. coli infected with Construct #2 is provided herein as<br>
SEQ ID NO:38 and the amino acid sequence of processed proteins isolated from E. coli<br>
infected with Construct #3 is provided herein as SEQ ID NO:39.<br>
Example 12: Comparing Activities of Sialidase Constructs with or without an<br>
Anchoring Domain<br>
To evaluate if the AR sequence indeed improves the cell-surface activity of a<br>
sialidase fusion protein, we incubated proteins purified from E. coli that were<br>
transformed with Construct #2; SEQ ID NO:24, depicted in Figure 7) or Construct #1<br>
(Hise-AvCD; SEQ ID NO: 17, depicted in Figure 5) with primary human bronchial<br>
epithelial cells and measured cell-bound sialidase activity after extensive washing. For<br>
cells incubated with Construct #2 protein (SEQ ID NO:25), up to 10% of the sialidase<br>
was found to be cell-bound, and the cell-bound sialidase activity increased in a dosedependent<br>
manner with the input concentration of Construct #2 protein. However,<br>
Construct #1 protein (SEQ ID NO: 18) incubated cells only exhibited background level<br>
of sialidase activity. Furthermore, we treated MDCK cells with either Construct #2<br>
protein or Construct #1 protein and measured the level of residual a( 2,6)-linked sialic<br>
acid on the surface of the cells (Figure 8). At equal levels of enzymatic activity below<br>
100 mU per well, Construct #2 protein demonstrated significantly higher potency than<br>
Construct #1 protein. These results indicate that the AR domain indeed enhances the<br>
function of sialidase.<br>
Example 13: In vitro Activities of Sialidase Fusion Proteins<br>
Stocks of Influenza Viruses<br>
Influenza viral strains are obtained from ATCC and the repository at St. Jude<br>
Children's Research Hospital. All experiments involving influenza viruses are conducted<br>
at Bio-safety level II.<br>
Viruses are propagated on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells in minimal<br>
essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.3% bovine serum albumin and 0.5<br>
micrograms of trypsin per ml. After incubating for 48 to 72 hours, the culture medium is<br>
clarified by low speed centrifugation. Viral particles are pelleted by ultracentrifugation<br>
through a 25% sucrose cushion. Purified viruses are suspended in 50% glycerol-O.lM<br>
Tris buffer (pH 7.3) and stored at -20°C.<br>
Cell protection assay<br>
To evaluate the ability of the Construct #2 AR-AvCD protein to protect cells<br>
against influenza viruses, we first treated MDCK cells with AR-AvCD made from<br>
Construct #2 or a broad-spectrum bacterial sialidase isolated from A. ureofaciens, and<br>
challenged the cells with a broad selection of human influenza viruses (IFV), including<br>
human IFV A of HI, H2 and H3 subtypes, human IFV B as well as an avian IFV strain.<br>
As shown in Figure 9, the fusion protein made from Construct #2 demonstrated 80 to<br>
100% of cell protection that was comparable to the effect of A. ureafaciens sialidase.<br>
To perform the assay, MDCK cells were treated with 10 mU of AR-AvCD protein<br>
(made using Construct #2) or the isolated sialidase of A. ureafaciens at 37°C for 2 hrs.<br>
The cells were subsequently challenged with influenza viruses at MOI 0.1 for 1 hr. The<br>
cells were washed and incubated in fresh DMDM:F12 supplemented with 0.2% ITS<br>
(GIBCO) and 0.6 ug/ml acetylated trypsin (Sigma). The cells were stained with 0.5%<br>
crystal violet and 20% methanol for 5 min and rinsed with tap water. The level of viable<br>
cells in each well was quantitated by extracting crystal violet by 70% ethanol and reading<br>
at 570 nM. Cell protection was calculated by 100 x {(sialidase treated sample - virus<br>
only)/(uninfected sample-virus only)}.<br>
IFV inhibition assay<br>
We evaluated inhibition of IFV amplification by AR-AvCD protein (made using<br>
Construct #2) and AR-G4S-AvCD protein (made using Construct #3) using a cell-based<br>
ELISA method (Belshe et al., J Virol., (1988) 62(5), 1508-1512).<br>
To perform the assay, MDCK monolayers in 96 well plates were treated with 16<br>
mU of the sialidases AR-AvCD made from Construct #2 or AR-G4S-AvCD made from<br>
Construct #3 in EDB/BSA buffer (10 mM Sodium Acetate, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM<br>
CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5% BSA) for 2 hrs at 37 °C. Both the sialidase treated and<br>
the untreated control cells (treated with only EDB/BSA buffer) were infected with 0.1<br>
MOI of virus. After 1 hour, the cells were washed two times with PBS and incubated in<br>
DMEM:F12 supplemented with 0.2% ITS (Gibco) and 0.6 ug/ml acetylated trypsin<br>
(Sigma). Forty to 48 hours post-infection, the levels of cell-bound virus were determined<br>
by using a cell-based ELISA assay. Specifically, cells were fixed in 0.05%<br>
glutaraldehyde in PBS and were incubated with 50 |ol of 103 dilution of either antiinfluenza<br>
A NP antiserum or anti-influenza B (Fitzgerald Inc.) in 0.5% BSA and PBS at<br>
37°C for 1 hr. After washing, each well was incubated with HRP-protein G in 0.5% BSA<br>
and PBS for 1 hr. After final washes, 50ul of 25 mM sodium citrate (pH 4.5) containing<br>
0.02% 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine dihydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.01% hydrogen<br>
peroxide was allowed to react with the cells at room temperature for 5 min. The<br>
reactions were stopped by adding 50 ul of 1M t^SO^ and quantitated by measuring<br>
optical densities at 450 nM. Percentage viral replication inhibition is calculated by 100%<br>
x {(virus only samples - sialidase treated samples)/(virus only samples - uninfected<br>
samples)}.<br>
Data on inhibition of viral replication and cell protection ECSO's and selective<br>
indexes for recombinant sialidase fusion proteins AR-AvCD made from Construct #2 and<br>
AR-G4S-AvCD made from Construct #3 for a variety of human influenza A and<br>
influenza B viruses, as well as equine viruses are shown in Figure 12.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, sialidase fusion proteins strongly inhibited amplification<br>
of a broad selection of influenza viruses. Notably, 80-100% viral inhibition (Figure 10)<br>
as well as cell protection (Figure 9) was achieved although a maximum of 70-80% of<br>
cell surface sialic acid was removed by the sialidase treatment (Figure 8). This finding<br>
demonstrates that it is unnecessary to completely eliminate cell surface sialic acid in<br>
order to achieve the desired therapeutic effect of treating with the sialidase fusion<br>
proteins of the present invention. The residual 20-30% of the surface sialic acid, while<br>
being inaccessible for the sialidase fusion proteins, is probably inaccessible for influenza<br>
viruses as well.<br>
Cvtotoxicity of sialidase fusion proteins<br>
To evaluate the cytotoxicity of AR-AvCD or AR-G4S-AvCD proteins (made from<br>
Constructs #2 and #3), MDCK cells were seeded at low density in 96-well plates and<br>
cultured for 5 days in DMEM containing 10% FBS and up to 20 U of AR-AvCD protein<br>
or AR-G4S-AvCD protein per well (both sialidases remained fully active during the entire<br>
experiment). Cell density in AR-AvCD or AR-G4S-AvCD treated or control wells were<br>
determined every day by staining the cells with crystal violet and measuring absorption at<br>
570 nM. No inhibition of cell growth was observed even at the highest concentration of<br>
AR-AvCD or AR-G4S-AvCD (100 U/ ml) in the culture. Therefore IC50, which is the<br>
drug concentration that inhibits cell growth by 50%, for AR-AvCD or AR-G4S-AvCD is<br>
above 100 U/ml.<br>
Example 14: In vivo Activities ofSialidase Catalytic Domain Fusion Protein<br>
Ferrets can be infected with human unadapted influenza viruses and produce signs<br>
of disease comparable to those of humans, which can be treated by antiviral compounds,<br>
such as zanamivir (Relenza). (Mendel et al., Antimicrob Agents Chemother, (1998)<br>
42(3), 640-646; Smith and Sweet, Rev. Infect. DiS., (1988) 10(1), 56-75; Reuman et al.,<br>
1 Virol. Methods, (1989) 24(1-2), 27-34). To evaluate in vivo efficacy of our<br>
compounds, we tested AR-AvCD protein (made from Construct #2) in the ferret model.<br>
Specifically, 24 young female ferrets (0.5-0.8 kg) (Marshall Farms, North Rose, NY) that<br>
tested negative for the presence of anti-hemagglutinin antibodies in sera were included in<br>
the study. Two animals were placed in each cage and allowed to acclimate for 3 days<br>
before the experiment. The animals were randomly divided into three groups: 8 animals<br>
were treated with drug dilution buffer and viral challenge, 12 animals were treated with<br>
AR-AvCD and viral challenge, and 4 animals were treated with AR-AvCD only. A<br>
preparation of AR-AvCD dissolved in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) that contains 500<br>
U/ml in sialidase activity and 0.7 mg/ml in protein concentration was used in the study.<br>
Animals in the drug treatment groups received 1 ml of AR-AvCD at each dose, which<br>
amounts to about 1 mg/kg in dosage level.<br>
Ferrets were anesthetized and inoculated intranasally (0.5 ml into each nostril)<br>
with AR-AvCD or PBS twice (8 am and 6pm) and daily for a total of 7 days (2 days prior<br>
to the viral challenge and 5 days post virus inoculation). The ferrets were observed<br>
following the drug application for signs of intolerance. Viral inoculation was carried out<br>
on day 3 between 10-11 am. The viral challenge was done with human A/Bayern/7/95<br>
(HlNl)-like virus at dose 105 TCIDso (&gt;104 ferret IDso). The nasal washes were collected<br>
from all animals starting day 2 post AR-AvCD treatment and continued until day 7. To<br>
collect nasal washes, 1 ml of sterile PBS was administered intranasally, the sneezed<br>
liquid was harvested and its volume was recorded. The nasal washes were centrifuged.<br>
The pelleted cells were re-suspended and counted in a hemacytometer under a<br>
microscope. The supernatants were collected, aliquoted and stored at -80°C. The protein<br>
concentration in cell-free nasal washes was determined by using the Bio-Rad protein<br>
reagent according to manufacturer's protocol (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For virus<br>
titration of the nasal washes, inoculated MDCK cells were incubated for 3 days at 36°C<br>
in a CO2 incubator. The monolayers were inspected visually for cytopathic effect (CPE)<br>
and aliquots of the cell culture supernatants from each well were tested for the virus<br>
presence by a standard hemagglutination assay with guinea pig red blood cells. Viral<br>
liter was determined by the Spearman Karber method ( (1996) ).<br>
In uninfected animals given intranasal AR-AvCD (n=4), no apparent effect on the<br>
inflammatory cell counts and protein concentrations in the nasal washes was observed<br>
(Figure 15 A and B). Nasal washes from these animals were followed for 7 days and<br>
were all negative for viral shedding. No signs of drug-related toxicity were detected in<br>
these animals at the drug dose used in this study. In the vehicle-treated group, virus<br>
replicated in the nasal epithelium of all 8 ferrets. Viral shedding reached peak values of<br>
4.4 to 5.9 logioTCIDso (mean peak titer of 4.9) on day 1 or 2 post challenge, diminished<br>
over time and became negative by day 5 (Figure 13). By contrast, only 3 of 12 ARAvCD-<br>
treated ferrets were positive for viral shedding on day 1 post challenge (Figure<br>
13), and their nasal viral titers were about 100 times lower than those in the vehicletreated<br>
animals (mean 2.4+0.3 vs. 4.4+0.4 logi0TCID50) (Figure 13). After day 1, the<br>
response to the AR-AvCD treatment varied substantially. Three animals were completely<br>
protected against infection, signs of illness, and inflammatory response (Figure 13),<br>
ferret tag # 803, 805, 806). The protection was also confirmed by a lack of<br>
seroconversion on day-14 post challenge. One ferret (tag #780) did not shed virus during<br>
the first three days post challenge, but it died on day 4 post infection from an unrelated<br>
injury. The shedding in the remaining 8 ferrets varied during the course of infection,<br>
ranging from ferret #812 that shed virus for a day only, to the ferret #791 that shed virus<br>
for 5 days.<br>
Infection in the ferrets that shed virus for at least one day was confirmed by more<br>
than a 16-fold rise in the post-challenge anti-HA antibody titer (seroconversion). There<br>
was no apparent effect of AR-AvCD treatment on the anti-HA titers in post-challenge<br>
sera (320-1280, vs. 160-1280, vehicle- and drug-treated group, respectively).<br>
In ferrets that shed the virus despite the AR-AvCD treatment (n=8), the<br>
inflammatory response was reduced and animals appeared to be more alert and active<br>
compared to the untreated ferrets that were invariably lethargic and feverish. For this<br>
group of 8 infected, AR-AvCD-treated animals, the mean AUC (area under the curve)<br>
81<br>
value calculated for the nasal protein concentrations was reduced by approximately 40%<br>
(2.68 vs. 4.48, arbitrary units) compared to the vehicle-treated infected animals (Figure<br>
11B). In vehicle-treated infected animals, the number of inflammatory cells in nasal<br>
washes was increased to approximately 100-fold above those in uninfected animals on<br>
day 2 post challenge. These levels were sustained for 4 additional days. The AR-AvCDtreated<br>
animals exhibited a significant reduction in the number of inflammatory cells in<br>
the nasal washes. Specifically, the AUC value for cell counts was reduced by<br>
approximately 3-fold in the AR-AvCD-treated animals compared to the vehicle-treated<br>
infected animals (1965 vs. 674, arbitrary units, Figure 11 A). The observed reduction in<br>
the inflammatory response indicates the importance of inhibiting viral replication at the<br>
early stage of infection.<br>
Example 15. Inhibition of Bacterial Cell Adhesion bySialidase Fusion Proteins<br>
Bacteria<br>
S. pneumoniae: 10 encapsulated strains of different serotypes are selected from the<br>
clinical isolates deposited at ATCC. Bacteria are maintained as frozen stocks and<br>
passaged on tryptic soy agar plates containing 3% sheep blood (Difco &amp; Micropure<br>
Medical Inc.) for 18 hr at 37°C in 5% CC&gt;2. To label pneumococci with radioisotope, an<br>
inoculum is taken from a 1- to 2-day plate culture, added to lysine-deficient tryptic soy<br>
broth containing 70 uCi of [3H] lysine per ml and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. The<br>
growth of each culture is monitored by light absorbance at 595 nm. At late logarithmic<br>
phase, the bacteria are harvested, washed twice by centrifugation (13,000rpm x 3min),<br>
and resuspended in L-15 medium (without phenol red) plus 0.1% BSA (L-15-BSA)<br>
(Cundell and Tuomanen, Microb. Pathog., (1994) 17(6), 361-374) (Barthelson et al.,<br>
Infect. Immun., (1998) 66(4), 1439-1444).<br>
H. influenzae: 5 strains of type b (Hib) and 10 nontypable strains (NTHi) are obtained<br>
from the clinical isolates deposited at ATCC. All strains are stocked in brain heart<br>
infusion (BHI, Difco) containing hemin (ICN) and NAD (Sigma) and kept frozen until<br>
use; then they are cultured on BHI agar supplemented with hemin and NAD and grown<br>
for 14 hr at 37°C with 5% CO2. (Kawakami et al., Microbiol. Immunol., (1998) 42(10),<br>
697-702). To label the bacteria with [3H], H. influenzae cells are inoculated in BHI broth<br>
containing hemin, NAD and [3H]leucine at 250 uCi/ml and allowed to grow until late<br>
logarithmic phase and then harvested, washed and resuspended in L-15-BSA (Barthelson<br>
et al., Infect. Immun., (1998) 66(4), 1439-1444).<br>
Cell Adhesion Assay<br>
All [3H]-labeled bacteria are suspended in L-15-BSA after washing, the bacterial<br>
concentration is determined by visual counting with a Petroff-Hausser chamber,<br>
radioactivity is determined by scintillation counting, and the specific activity of the [3H]-<br>
labeled cells is calculated. Preparations of bacteria with 7cpm/1000 cells or greater are<br>
used. The bacteria are diluted to 5x 108 cells/ml. BEAS-2B cell monolayers are<br>
incubated with [3H]-labeled bacterial suspension containing 5 x 107 bacteria at 37°C in<br>
5% CO2. After 30 min, unbound bacteria are removed by washing with L-15-BSA for 5<br>
times. Bacteria attached to the WD-HAE tissue samples are quantitated by scintillation<br>
counting.<br>
Desialylation of BEAS-2B cells by sialidase fusion proteins and effects on cell adhesion<br>
by H. influenzae and S. pneumoniae.<br>
BEAS-2B cells are incubated with 1-50 mU of AR-AvCD for 2 hours. Cell<br>
adhesion assay will be carried out using H. influenzae and 5. pneumoniae strains as<br>
described above. Mock treated cells are used as positive control. Efficacy of AR-AvCD<br>
is quantitated as the ECso, which is the amount of enzyme to achieve 50% inhibition on<br>
bacterial adhesion.<br>
Example 16. Improving Transduction Efficiency of AAV Vector using Sialidase<br>
Fusion Proteins<br>
In vitro Experiments<br>
An experiment demonstrating effect of AR-AvCD is performed in a way similar<br>
to the procedure published (Bals et al., J Virol., (1999) 73(7), 6085-6088). A monolayer<br>
of Well-Differentiated Airway Epithelium (WDAE) cells is maintained in transwells<br>
(Karp et al., Methods Mol. Biol., (2002) 188, 115-137; Wang et al., J Virol., (1998)<br>
72(12), 9818-9826). In order to eliminate sialic acid from the cell surface the culture<br>
medium is replaced with serum free medium in which 0.5-10 units of AR-AvCD are<br>
dissolved. The cells are treated for 30 min to 6 hours. The cell monolayers are washed,<br>
transduced with AAV, and transduction efficiency is estimated using standard<br>
procedures. Several transwells are treated with medium only (without AR-AvCD) to<br>
serve the purpose of control (basal transduction efficiency). Additional controls may<br>
include the transwells treated with AR-AvCD only to assess cytotoxic effect of<br>
desialylation. A reporter virus is used for facile detection of transduced cells. Examples<br>
of reporter AAV and their use have been described in literature and include AAV-CMVeGFP,<br>
AAV2LacZ (Bals et al., J Virol., (1999) 73(7), 6085-6088; Wang et al., Hum.<br>
Gene Ther., (2004) 15(4), 405-413) and alkaline phosphatase (Halbert et al., Nat.<br>
Biotechnol., (2002) 20(7), 697-701). The efficiency is estimated by light microscopy of<br>
the cells that were fixed and treated with appropriate substrate (if lacZ or AP containing<br>
virus is used) or fluorescent microscopy of live cells (if GFP is used). According to the<br>
experiments conducted at NexBio with NHBE primary epithelial cells (Cambrex,<br>
Walkersville, MD) the maximum amount of removal of sialic acid is achieved in less<br>
than one hour when 10 units of AR-AvCD per transwell are used. Other cell lines used<br>
(e.g. MDCK) become desialylated with much less AR-AvCD administered (0.1 U for 1<br>
hour). It is therefore our estimate that a treatment of WDAE with 10 U of AR-AvCD for<br>
2 hours will be sufficient to remove accessible sialic acid and provide significant<br>
enhancement of transduction of WDAE cells with AAV.<br>
Testing Effect of AR-AvCD Treatment on AAV Transduction in an Animal Model.<br>
To demonstrate effect of AR-AvCD treatment in animal model an experiment<br>
similar to previously described is conducted (Flotte et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.<br>
A, (1993) 90(22), 10613-10617; Halbert et al., Nat. Biotechnol., (2002) 20(7), 697-701).<br>
Several hours (1-6) prior to administration of AAV AR-AvCD is delivered to mice lungs<br>
by nasal aspiration of aerosole or lyophilized AR-AvCD powder according to previously<br>
published protocol (Flotte et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A, (1993) 90(22), 10613-<br>
10617). AAV carrying reporter gene (alkaline phosphatase) is delivered by nasal<br>
aspiration, mice are euthanized 4 weeks later and transduced cells are detected in fixed<br>
lungs as previously described (Halbert et al., J ViroL, (1998) 72(12), 9795-9805).<br>
Example 17. Sialidase Treatment Inhibits Mast Cell Functions and Smooth Muscle<br>
Contraction in the Trachea.<br>
Using experimental methods described previously (Cocchiara et al., J<br>
Neuroimmunol., (1997) 75(1-2), 9-18), it will be demonstrated that treatment by<br>
compounds of the present invention prevents substance P (SP) induced histamine release<br>
by mast cells. Using another set of experiments (Stenton et al., J Pharmacol. Exp.<br>
Ther., (2002) 302(2), 466-474), treatment by compounds of the present invention will<br>
inhibit p-hexosaminidase release by mast cells stimulated by two PAR-activating<br>
peptides (PAR stands for proteinase-activated receptors).<br>
Compounds of the present invention will be administered intratracheally in guinea<br>
pigs and the airway reactivity will be assessed in the animals as described previously<br>
(Jarreau et al., Am. Rev. Respir. Dis., (1992) 145(4 Pt 1), 906-910; Stenton et al., J<br>
Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., (2002) 302(2), 466-474). Sialidase treatment should not induce<br>
nonspecific airway hyperreactivity judged by the reaction to multiple inducers. In<br>
addition, sialidase treatment should reduce substance P-induced bronchoconstriction.<br>
Similarly, compounds of the present invention will be used to treated the isolated guinea<br>
pig and rat trachea and lung (Kai et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol., (1992) 220(2-3), 181-185;<br>
Stenton et al., J Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., (2002) 302(2), 466-474). Again recombinant<br>
sialidase treatment will have no effect on smooth muscle contractions induced by<br>
acetylcholine, histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamme. In addition, it will inhibit tracheal<br>
contraction induced by antigen (ovalbumin) or compound 48/80.<br>
