				<td>ELECTRODE FOR ELECTROCHEMICAL/ELECTROCONTROLLABLE<br>
DEVICES<br>
The present invention relates to an electrochemical<br>
and/or electrocontrollable device of the glazing type<br>
which has variable optical and/or energetic properties,<br>
or a photovoltaic device, or alternatively an<br>
electroluminescent device.<br>
Specifically, there is nowadays an increased demand for<br>
so-called "intelligent" glazing which can adapt to the<br>
users' requirements.<br>
There is also an increased demand for photovoltaic<br>
glazing, which makes it possible to convert solar<br>
energy into electrical energy, as well as for<br>
electroluminescent glazing which has advantageous<br>
applications in display equipment and as surfaces for<br>
illumination.<br>
As regards "intelligent" glazing, this may involve<br>
controlling the delivery of sunlight through glazing<br>
fitted on the exterior of buildings or vehicles such as<br>
automobiles, trains or aircraft. The purpose is to be<br>
able to limit excessive heating inside the<br>
cockpits/rooms, but only in case of strong sunshine.<br>
It may also involve controlling the degree of vision<br>
through glazing, particularly in order to darken it,<br>
render it diffusing or prevent any vision when so<br>
desired. This may relate to glazing fitted in rooms,<br>
trains, aircraft or fitted as automobile side windows.<br>
It also relates to the mirrors used as wing mirrors in<br>
order to avoid the driver being suddenly dazzled, or<br>
signaling panels so that messages appear when this is<br>
necessary or intermittently in order to attract more<br>
attention. Glazing which can be rendered diffusing at<br>
will may be used when so desired, for instance in<br>
projection screens.<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
As a variant, it may involve generating light by the<br>
glazing in order to control the level of luminosity or<br>
the color generated.<br>
There are various electrocontrollable systems allowing<br>
these types of aspect/thermal property modifications.<br>
In order to modulate the light transmission or light<br>
absorption by glazing, there are so-called viologen<br>
systems such as those described in Patents US-5 239 406<br>
and EP-612 826.<br>
In order to modulate the light transmission and/or<br>
thermal transmission of glazing, there are also so-<br>
called electrochromic systems. As is known, these<br>
generally comprise two electrochromic material layers<br>
separated by an electrolyte layer and framed by .two<br>
electrically conductive layers. Each of these<br>
electrochromic material layers can reversibly insert<br>
cations and electrons, the modification of their<br>
oxidation state due to these insertions/deinsertions<br>
leading to a change in its optical and/or thermal<br>
properties. In particular, their absorption and/or<br>
their reflection at visible and/or infrared wavelengths<br>
can be modified.<br>
It is customary to divide electrochromic systems into<br>
three categories:<br>
that in which the electrolyte is in the form of a<br>
polymer or a gel; for example, a polymer with protonic<br>
conduction such as those described in Patents<br>
EP-253 713 or EP-670 346, or a polymer with lithium ion<br>
conduction such as those described in Patents<br>
EP-382 623, EP-518 754 and EP-532 408; the other layers<br>
of the system are generally of inorganic nature,<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
that in which the electrolyte is an essentially<br>
inorganic layer. This category is often referred to by<br>
the term "all solid" system, and examples of it can be<br>
found in Patents EP-867 752, EP-831 360, Patents<br>
WO.00/57243 and WO.00/71777,<br>
that in which all the layers are based on polymers,<br>
which category is often referred to by the term "all<br>
polymer" system.<br>
There are also systems referred to as "optical valves".<br>
These are films comprising a polymer matrix, generally<br>
crosslinked, in which micro-droplets are dispersed<br>
containing particles which are capable of being placed<br>
along a privileged direction under the action of a<br>
magnetic or electric field. For instance, Patent<br>
WO.93/09460 discloses an optical valve comprising a<br>
polyorganosilane matrix and particles of the polyiodide<br>
type which intercept the light much less when a voltage<br>
is applied to the film.<br>
So-called liquid crystal systems with a functionality<br>
similar to the previous ones may also be mentioned.<br>
These are based on the use of a film placed between two<br>
conductive layers and based on a polymer in which<br>
droplets of liquid crystals are arranged, in particular<br>
nematic liquid crystals with a positive dielectric<br>
anisotropy. When a voltage is applied to the film, the<br>
liquid crystals become oriented along a privileged<br>
axis, which allows vision. When there is no voltage,<br>
without alignment of the crystals, the film becomes<br>
diffusing and prevents vision. Examples of such films<br>
are described particularly in European Patent<br>
EP-0 238 164 and American Patents US-4 435 047,<br>
US-4 806 922, US-4 732 456. When laminated and<br>
incorporated between two glass substrates, this type of<br>
film is marketed by Saint-Gobain Vitrage under the<br>
brand name "Priva-Lite".<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
It is moreover possible to use all the liquid crystal<br>
devices known by the terms "NCAP" (Nematic<br>
Curvilinearly Aligned Phases) or "PDLC" (Polymer<br>
Dispersed Liquid Crystal) .<br>
It is also possible to use cholesteric liquid crystal<br>
polymers, such as those described in . Patent<br>
WO.92/19695.<br>
As regards electroluminescent systems, these comprise<br>
an organic or inorganic electroluminescent materia], or<br>
material stack supplied with electricity by electrodes.<br>
A common feature of all these systems together is the<br>
need to be equipped with current feeds, which supply<br>
electrodes generally in the form of two electrically<br>
conductive layers on either side of the layer or<br>
various active layer (s) of the system.<br>
These electrically conductive layers (which may in fact<br>
be a stack of layers) commonly comprise a layer based<br>
on indium oxide, generally tin-doped indium oxide<br>
better known by the abbreviation ITO. They may also be<br>
layers based on tin oxide doped for example with<br>
antimony, or based on zinc oxide doped for example with<br>
aluminum (or a mixture based on at least two of these<br>
oxides).<br>
Document WO93/05438, for example, discloses an<br>
electrically conductive layer consisting of a thin<br>
metal layer based in particular on silver, copper,<br>
aluminum, which is associated with a layer based on a<br>
metallic blocker such as, for example, iron, zirconium,<br>
titanium, tungsten. This stack of the TCO type<br>
(transparent conductive oxide) is intended to be<br>
integrated in an electrochemical device of the<br>
electrochromic type, inside which the metallic blocker<br>
layer constitutes a barrier to diffusion of the Li+<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
ions between one of the active layers and the metal<br>
layer.<br>
Furthermore, W094/15247 discloses an electrically<br>
conductive layer with a structure similar to that<br>
previously described, which is supplemented with a<br>
layer based on a transparent conductive oxide such as,<br>
for example, zinc oxide or tin-doped indium oxide.<br>
US5510173 and US5763063 moreover disclose a stack<br>
structure with energetic control incorporating a layer<br>
of silver or copper advantageously alloyed with a noble<br>
metal, for which protection in respect of corrosion is<br>
obtained by coating with a bilayer based on In2O3 and<br>
ITO or ZnO2/In2O3 and ITO. In the case of using ZnO2,<br>
application as an electrode is impossible owing to the<br>
insulating character of this oxide.<br>
Furthermore, Patent US6870656 describes a reflective<br>
electrode structure incorporating a layer based on an<br>
electrochemically stable alloy of silver and gold.<br>
For every electrically conductive layer structure<br>
described above, its electrochemical stability is<br>
obtained only when this electrically conductive layer<br>
is alloyed.<br>
ITO layers have been studied in particular. They can be<br>
easily deposited by magnetic field assisted cathodic<br>
sputtering, either from an oxide target (unreactive<br>
sputtering) or from a target based on indium and tin<br>
(reactive sputtering in the presence of an oxidizing<br>
agent such as oxygen). In order to present a sufficient<br>
electrical conductivity for the application and in<br>
order to be electrochemically robust, however, they<br>
require the application of a heat treatment step in<br>
situ or for finishing (often above 300°C).<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
It is an object of the invention to be able to obtain<br>
an electrochemically robust assembly of electrically<br>
conductive layers for constituting the electrodes of<br>
electrochemical/electrocontrollable systems of the<br>
types previously described (electrochromic,<br>
photovoltaic, electroluminescent, etc.) it is a<br>
further aim to achieve this object with less cost and<br>
by avoiding the heat treatment steps, and without<br>
radically changing the known configurations of<br>
electrochromic systems which concern the invention. A<br>
more general object is to develop superior electrodes<br>
on an essentially transparent substrate (glass or<br>
polymeric material).<br>
The invention relates to an electrochemical/<br>
electrocontrollable device having variable optical<br>
and/or energetic properties, comprising at least one<br>
carrier substrate provided with an electroactive layer<br>
or an electraactiye layer stack arranged between a so-<br>
called "lower" electrode and a so-called "upper"<br>
electrode. According to the invention, at least one of<br>
the lower or upper electrodes comprises at least four<br>
layers including at least one metal functional, layer<br>
having intrinsic electrical conductivity properties,<br>
said functional layer being associated with an<br>
electrochemical barrier layer of an electrically<br>
conductive material which is transparent in the visible<br>
range, said electrochemical barrier layer being<br>
associated with a humidity protection layer of an<br>
electrically conductive material which is transparent<br>
in the visible range and said functional layer being<br>
associated with a first sublayer of electrically<br>
conductive material which is transparent in the visible<br>
range.<br>
Owing to this particular stack structure, a transparent<br>
electrode exhibiting an electrochemical stability<br>
compatible with electrocontrollable systems while<br>
having properties of high electrical conductivity can<br><br>
- 7 -<br>
be obtained with less cost, and without resorting to a<br>
thermal finishing treatment. It is moreover to be noted<br>
that electrochemical systems with this type of stack<br>
structure have similar characteristics on the lower<br>
electrode and optionally on the upper electrode, in<br>
terms of coloration speed and homogeneity, as those<br>
using conventional electrodes of the prior art (main.'l y<br>
based on indium oxide, optionally doped). It is<br>
furthermore to be noted that the electrode obtained in<br>
this way is electrically conductive both in its<br>
thickness and over its surface.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, one and/or<br>
other of the following provisions may optionally be<br>
furthermore employed:<br>
-	the first sublayer is identical in nature to the<br>
electrochemical barrier layer,<br>
-	the electrochemical barrier layer is based on zinc<br>
oxide or a mixed oxide of zinc doped with another<br>
metal selected from the following family of<br>
metals: Al, Ga, B, Sc,<br>
-	the zinc oxide is of the ZnOx type with x less<br>
than 1, preferably lying between 0.88 and 0.98, in<br>
particular between 0.90 and 0.95,<br>
-	the functional layer is based on a pure material<br>
selected from silver or Cu or Zn or Al or Au or<br>
based on an alloy of this material containing in<br>
particular Al, Pt, Cu, Zn, Cd, In, Bo, Si, Zr, Mo,<br>
Ni, Li, Cr, Ga, Ge, Mg, Mn, Co, Sn, the humidity<br>
barrier layer being based on indium oxide doped in<br>
particular with tin, or tin oxide doped in<br>
particular with antimony,<br>
-	the first sublayer is associated with a second<br>
sublayer similar to the humidity barrier layer.<br><br>
- 8 -<br>
In the context of the invention, the term "lower"<br>
electrode is intended to mean the electrode which lies<br>
closer to the carrier substrate taken as a reference,<br>
on which at least some of the active layers are<br>
deposited (for example all the active layers in an "all<br>
solid" electrochromic system). The "upper" electrode is<br>
the one deposited on the other side, with respect to<br>
the same reference substrate.<br>
Advantageously, the upper and/or lower electrode<br>
according to the invention has an electrical<br>
resistivity of between 10.10-4 and 9.10-5 ohm. cm, which<br>
makes its use as an electrode perfectly satisfactory.<br>
Preferably, in particular in order to achieve this<br>
level of resistivity, it has a total thickness of<br>
between 160 and 320 nm.<br>
The electrode remains transparent in these thickness<br>
ranges, that is to say it exhibits low absorption of<br>
light in the visible range. Nevertheless, it is not<br>
unfeasible to have much thicker layers (particularly in<br>
the case when the electroactive system of the<br>
electrochromic type functions in reflection rather than<br>
in transmission) or thinner layers (particularly when<br>
they are associated with another type of conductive<br>
layer, for example metallic, in the electrode).<br>
As mentioned above, the invention may be applied to<br>
various types of electrochemical or electrocontrollable<br>
systems. It more particularly concerns electrochromic<br>
systems, particularly "all solid" or "all solid on<br>
polymer" or "all polymer" systems, or alternatively<br>
liquid crystal or viologen systems, or even<br>
electroluminescent systems.<br>
The electrochromic systems or glazing to which the<br>
invention may be applied are described in the patents<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
cited above. They may comprise at least one carrier<br>
substrate and a stack of functional layers successively<br>
comprising at least a first electrically conductive<br>
layer, an electrochemically active layer capable of<br>
reversibly inserting ions such as H+, Li+, OH<br>
respectively of the anodic or cathodic electrochromic<br>
material type, an electrolyte layer, a second<br>
electrochemically active layer capable of reversibly<br>
inserting ions such as H+, Li+, OH" respectively of.the<br>
cathodic or anodic electrochromic material type, and a<br>
second electrically conductive layer (the term "layer"<br>
is to be understood as meaning a single layer or a<br>
stack of a plurality of continuous or discontinuous<br>
layers).<br>
The invention also relates to the incorporation of the<br>
electrochemical devices described in the preamble of<br>
the present application in glazing, which functions in<br>
reflection (mirror) or in transmission. The term<br>
"glazing" is to be understood in the broad sense, and<br>
covers any essentially transparent material made of<br>
glass and/or polymeric material (such as polycarbonate<br>
PC or polymethyl methacrylate PMMA). The carrier<br>
substrates and/or counter-substrates, that is to say<br>
the substrates framing the active system, may be rigid,<br>
flexible or semi-flexible.<br>
If the glazing functions in reflection, it may in<br>
particular be used as an interior mirror or as a wing<br>
mirror.<br>
The invention also relates to the various applications<br>
which may be found for these devices, glazing or<br>
mirrors: this may involve making glazing for buildings,<br>
particularly exterior glazing, interior partitions or<br>
glazed doors. It may also involve windows, roofs or<br>
interior partitions for means of transport such as<br>
trains, aircraft, automobiles, boats. It may also<br>
involve visualization or display screens such as<br><br>
- 10 -<br>
projection screens, television or computer screens,<br>
touch-sensitive screens. They may also be used to make<br>
spectacles or camera lenses, or alternatively to<br>
protect solar panels. They may also be used as energy<br>
storage devices of the battery, fuel cell type,<br>
batteries and cells themselves.<br>
The invention will now be described in more detail with<br>
the aid of nonlimiting examples and figures:<br>
- Figure 1: a schematic view in section of an<br>
electrochromic cell using an electrode according<br>
to the invention,<br>
-	Figure 2 illustrates for various configurations of<br>
electrodes according to the invention their<br>
electrochemical protection.<br>
Figure 1 is deliberately very schematic and is not<br>
necessarily to scale, in order to make it easier to<br>
read: it represents a section of an "all • solid"<br>
electrochromic device according to the teachings of the<br>
invention, successively comprising:<br>
-	a substrate of clear silica-soda-lime glass 1 with<br>
a thickness of 2.1 mm,<br>
-	a lower electrode 2 comprising a layer stack of<br>
the ITO/ZnO:Al/Ag/ZnO:Al/ITO type with respective<br>
thicknesses 15 to 20 nm for ITO/60 to 80 nm for<br>
ZnO:Al/3 to 15 nm for silver/60 to 80- nm for<br>
ZnO:Al/15 to 20 nm for ITO,<br><br>
-	an upper electrode 4 based on ITO or SnC&gt;2:F,<br>
-	an electrochromic system 3 whose structure is<br>
described below,<br><br>
- 11 -<br>
-	a PU sheet 7 making it possible to laminate the<br>
glass 1 with another glass 8 having the same<br>
characteristics as the glass 1. Optionally, the<br>
face of the glass 8 turned toward the PU sheet 7<br>
is provided with a stack of thin layers having a<br>
solar protection function. This stack may in<br>
particular comprise two silver layers intercalated<br>
with dielectric layers, in .a manner which is<br>
known.<br>
The electrochromic system 3 comprises:<br>
-	a first anodic electrochromic material layer EC1<br>
of (hydrated) iridium oxide measuring 40 to 100 nm<br>
or hydrated nickel oxide measuring 40 to 400 nm,<br>
optionally alloyed with other metals (as a<br>
variant, this layer may be replaced by an anodic<br>
electrochromic material layer of nickel oxide<br>
measuring 100 to 300 nm, optionally alloyed with<br>
other metals),<br>
-	a layer of tungsten oxide measuring 100 nm,<br>
-	a second layer of hydrated tantalum oxide or<br>
hydrated silicon oxide or hydrated zirconium oxide<br>
measuring 100 nm, these last two layers forming a<br>
layer with an electrolyte function EL,<br>
-	a second layer of cathodic electrochromic material<br>
EC2 based on tungsten oxide WO3 measuring 370 nm.<br>
All these layers were deposited by magnetic field<br>
assisted cathodic sputtering.<br>
The electrochromic device described above constitutes<br>
Example 1.<br><br>
- 12 -<br>
Example 2 is given below; it is a structure known from<br>
the prior art and for which both the lower and upper<br>
electrodes are based on ITO or Sn02:F.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 (comparative = standard EC)<br>
The electrochromic glazing EC has an identical<br>
composition to Example 1, except that<br>
- the lower electrode 2 is based on ITO (tin-doped<br>
indium oxide) measuring 500 nm, deposited hot<br>
(350°C).<br>
As a variant, the upper electrode comprises other<br>
conductive elements: this may in particular involve<br>
associating the electrode with a layer more conductive<br>
than it, and/or with a plurality of conductive strips<br>
or wires. Reference will be made to the cited Patent<br>
WO00/57243 for more details about the implementation of<br>
such multi-component electrodes. A preferred embodiment<br>
of this type of electrode consists in a network of<br>
conductive wires, encrusted on the surface of a polymer<br>
sheet (which may then protect the active system and/or<br>
allow lamination of the glass-type carrier substrate<br>
with another glass in the case of fabricating<br>
electroactive glazing, for example of the<br>
electrochromic type), being applied onto the ITO layer.<br>
Comparative tests were then carried out on the two<br>
electrochromic cells of Examples 1 and 2.<br>
The most reliable validation of the TCOs consists .in<br>
carrying out a durability test of the electrochromic<br>
cells by exposure to 80°C in the colored state. In this<br>
context, the parameters representative of the<br>
degradation of the glazing EC are the change in the<br>
switching time (Vcom) and the contrast<br>
(TLuncolored/TLuncolored).<br><br>
- 13 -<br><br>
	Time (h)	V com (s)	Contrast<br>
Example 2 (std EC)	0	6	6.5<br><br>
	1500	12	4.6<br>
Example 1	0	5	7.1<br><br>
	1500	15	5<br>
The table above indicates that the switching time<br>
(Vcom) and the contrast experience a similar change on<br>
the standard sample (with the 500 nm lower electrode of<br>
hot ITO) and on the sample incorporating the multilayer<br>
TCO. The use of the multilayer TCO is therefore<br>
perfectly compatible with use in electrochromic<br>
glazing.<br>

Example 1	32.5	29.4	-7.1	8.5	4.6	2 6.6	-9.5	-11.8<br>
The optical results show (for a TCO incorporating an Ag<br>
layer with a thickness of 12 nm) a- loss of TL as well<br>
as an increase in the reflection. This greater light<br>
absorption is perfectly acceptable for the automobile<br>
roof application, where the TL level expected by the<br>
customer is at most 40%.<br>
Other examples illustrating other embodiments of the<br>
invention are given below.<br>
Example 3<br>
According to a variant of the invention forming the<br>
subject matter of Example 3, it substantially repeats<br>
the structure of the stack in Figure 1 except as<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
regards the nature of the lower electrode 2 and upper<br>
electrode 4. Specifically, both of them comprise a<br>
layer stack of the ITO/ZnO:Al/Ag/ZnO:Al/ITO type with<br>
respective thicknesses 15 to 20 nm for ITO/60 to 80 nm<br>
for ZnO:Al/3 to 15 nm for silver/60 to 80 nm for<br>
ZnO:Al/15 to 20 nm for ITO. This configuration makes it<br>
possible to obviate the wire network, the conduction of<br>
the TCO being equivalent to that of the ITO + wire<br>
assembly.<br>
Other exemplary embodiments of the invention are given<br>
below. The following table collates the electrical and<br>
optical characteristics of different multilayer TCOs<br>
complying with various applications.<br><br>
Multiple layer	Rsq	Ttot<br>
(nm)	p(Q.cm)	TL	RL	Abs<br>
IT02o/ZnO:Al6o/Ag12/ZnO:Al6o/IT020	4.6	172	7.91 E-05	49.6	39.9	10.5<br>
IT015/ZnO:Al6o/Ag12/ZnO:Al6o/IT015	5.3	162	8.58 E-05	54	31.9	14 .1<br>
ITO20/ZnO:Al60/Ag6/ZnO:Al60/ITO20	14	168	2.3 E-04	65.3	25.4	9.3<br>
IT020/ZnO:Al60/Ag3/ZnO:Al6o/IT02o	60	165	9.9 E-04	65.1	12.6	22.3<br>
IT020/ZnO:Al13o/Ag3/ZnO:Al13o/IT02o	25	303	7.57 E-04	57.5	14.8	27.7<br>
In the table above: Ttot: total thickness, p: effective<br>
resistivity of the stack and Rsq. = p/Ttot in Q/square.<br>
Furthermore, TL: light transmission in %, RL: light<br>
reflection, Abs = 100-RL-TL.<br>
The inventors have found that the electrochemical<br>
protection of the barrier layer is determined by the<br>
thickness of the electrochemical barrier layer. The<br>
inventors have thus been able to determine that a<br>
minimum thickness of 60 nm ZnO:Al is necessary in order<br>
to protect the Ag. This is illustrated in Figure 2<br>
where a TCO comprising 12 nm of Ag experiences an<br>
oxidation cycle with the aid of a so-called "three<br>
electrode" setup having a working electrode (TCO<br>
studied), a reference electrode (saturated calomel<br><br>
- 15 -<br>
electrode) and a counter-electrode (glass -! 500 nm I TO)<br>
which are immersed in an H3P04 liquid electrolyte<br>
(orthophosphoric acid).<br>
According to another alternative embodiment intended<br>
particularly for use with an electrocontrollable system<br>
of the electroluminescent type:<br>
Distinction is made between a first family, in which<br>
the organic electroluminescent material of the thin<br>
layer consists of evaporated molecules (ODELs) such as,<br>
for example, A1Q3 (tris(8-hydroxyquinone) aluminum),<br>
DPVBi (4,4'-(diphenyl vinylene biphenyl)), DMQA<br>
(dimethyl quinacridone) or DCM (4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-<br>
methyl-6-(4-dimethylaminostyryl)-4H-pyran). In this<br>
case, additional layers promoting the transport of<br>
electrical carriers (holes and electrons) are<br>
associated on each of the faces of the thin layer,<br>
these additional layers respectively being referred to<br>
as "HTL" and "ETL" for "hole transporting layer" and<br>
"electron transporting layer". In order to improve the<br>
injection of the holes into the HTL layer, it is<br>
furthermore associated with a layer referred to as<br>
"HIL" for "hole injection layer" consisting, for<br>
example, of copper or zinc phthalocyanine,<br>
A second family, in which the organic<br>
electroluminescent material of the thin layer consists<br>
of polymers (pLEDs) such as, for example, PPV for<br>
poly(para-phenylene vinylene), PPP (poly(para-<br>
phenylene)), DO-PPP (poly(2-decyloxy-l,4-phenylene)),<br>
MEH-PPV (poly [2- (2'-ethylhexyloxy)-5-methoxy-l, 4-<br>
phenylene vinylene]), CN-PPV (po1y[2,5-bis(hexyloxy)-<br>
1, 4-phenylene-(1-cyanovinylene)]) or PDAFs<br>
(poly(dialkylfluorenes)), the polymer layer likewise<br>
being associated with a layer which promotes the<br>
injection of holes (HIL), consisting for example of<br>
PEDT/PSS (poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)/poly (4-<br>
styrene sulfonate)),<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
A third family, in which the inorganic electro-<br>
luminescent material of the thin layer consists of a<br>
thin layer of a luminophore, for example sulfides such<br>
as for example ZnS:Mn or SrS:Ce or oxides such as<br>
Zn2Si04:Mn, Zn2Ge04:Mn or Zn2Ga204:Mn. In this case, an<br>
insulating layer made from a dielectric materia] ,<br>
conventionally for example Si3N4, BaTi03 or Al203/Ti02,<br>
is associated with each of the faces of the<br>
electroluminescent thin layer,<br>
A fourth family, in which the inorganic<br>
electroluminescent layer consists of a thick layer of a<br>
luminophore such as, for example, ZnS:Mn or ZnS:Cu,<br>
this layer being associated with an insulating layer of<br>
dielectric material, for example BaTi03, these layers<br>
generally being produced by screen printing.<br>
Whatever the type of electroluminescent system, organic<br>
or inorganic, in thin or thick layers, the layer stack<br>
comprising in particular the electroluminescent layer<br>
is associated on either side of the insulating layers<br>
HTL, ETL, HIL with two electrodes (a cathode and an<br>
anode in the case of organic systems).<br>
These electrodes are similar to those already envisaged<br>
for electrocontrollable systems of the electrochromic<br>
type as described above.<br>
It may nevertheless be necessary to. render one of these<br>
electrodes reflective and, to this end, the thickness<br>
of the functional layer with electrical conductivity<br>
properties is'increased. The thicknesses of each- of the<br>
layers forming the stack for the two types of electrode<br>
are given below:<br>
Electrode El: 15 to 20 nm for ITO/60 to 80 nm for<br>
ZnO:Al/6 to 12 nm for silver/60 to 80 nm for ZnO:Al/15<br>
to 20 nm for ITO.<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
Electrode E2: 15 to 20 nm for ITO/60 to 80 nm for<br>
ZnO:Al/40 nm minimum for silver/60 to 80 nm for<br>
ZnO:Al/15 to 20 nm for ITO.<br>
This electrode structure according to the invention is<br>
integrated within a stack of the electroluminescent<br>
type according to the following configuration:<br>
El/(Si3N4 (300nm)/luminophore (500nm)/Si3N4 (300nm))/E2<br>
The invention- also relates to the substrate provided<br>
with at least one electrode of the type described<br>
above, independently of the electrical/electrochemical<br>
device in which it is incorporated or intended to be<br>
incorporated, as well as the lower or upper electrode<br>
per se.<br><br>
