QUINAZOLINONE COMPOUNDS WITH REDUCED BIOACCUMULATION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates to melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R)<br>
agonists and methods of their preparation. More specifically, the invention<br>
relates to quinazolinone compounds that exhibit reduced bioaccumulation<br>
properties when administered to a subject.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]	Melanocortins are peptide products resulting from post-<br>
translational processing of pro-opiomelanocortin and are known to have, a<br>
broad array of physiological activities. The natural melanocortins include the<br>
different types of melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH, p-MSH, y-MSH)<br>
and ACTH. Of these, a-MSH and ACTH are considered to be the main<br>
endogenous melanocortins.<br>
[0003]	The melanocortins mediate their effects through melanocortin<br>
receptors (MC-Rs), a subfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. There are at<br>
least five different receptor subtypes (MC1-R to MC5-R). MC1-R mediates<br>
pigmentation of the hair and skin. MC2-R mediates the effects of ACTH on<br>
steroidogenesis in the adrenal gland. MC3-R and MC4-R are predominantly expressed in the brain. MC5-R is considered to have a role in the exocrine<br>
gland system.<br>
[0004]	The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R) is a seven-<br>
transmembrane receptor. MC4-R may participate in modulating the flow of<br>
visual and sensory information, coordinate aspects of somatomotor control,<br>
and/or participate in the modulation of autonomic outflow to the heart. K. G.<br>
Mountjoy et al., Science, 257:1248-125 (1992). Significantly, inactivation of<br>
this receptor by gene targeting has resulted in mice that develop a maturity<br>
onset obesity syndrome associated with hyperphagia, hyperinsulinemia, and<br>
hyperglycemia. D. Husznar et al„ Cell, 88(1): 131-41 (1997). MC4-Rhas.<br><br>
also been implicated in other disease states including erectile disorders,<br>
cardiovascular disorders, neuronal injuries or disorders, inflammation, fever,<br>
cognitive disorders, and sexual behavior disorders. M. E. Hadley and C.<br>
Haskell-Luevano, The proopiomelanocortin system. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci.,<br>
885:1 (1999).<br>
[0005]	Furthermore, observations in connection with endogenous MC4-<br>
R antagonists indicate that MC4-R is implicated in endogenous energy<br>
regulation. For example, an agouti protein is normally expressed in the skin<br>
and is an antagonist of the cutaneous MC receptor involved in pigmentation,<br>
MC1-R. M. M. Ollmann et al., Science, 278:135-138 (1997). However,<br>
overexpression of agouti protein in mice leads to a yellow coat color due to<br>
antagonism of MC1-R and increased food intake and body weight due to<br>
antagonism of MC4-R. L. L. Kiefer et al., Biochemistry, 36: 2084-2090 (1997);<br>
D. S. Lu et a/., Nature, 371:799-802 (1994). Agouti related protein (AGRP),<br>
an agouti protein homologue, antagonizes MC4-R but not MC1-R. T. M. Fong<br>
et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 237:629-631 (1997). Administration<br>
of AGRP in mice increases food intake and causes obesity but does not alter<br>
pigmentation. M. Rossi et al., Endocrinology, 739:4428-4431 (1998).<br>
Together, this research indicates that MC4-R participates in energy<br>
regulation, and therefore, identifies this receptor as a target for a rational drug<br>
design for the treatment of obesity.<br>
[0006]	In connection with MC4-R and its uncovered role in the etiology<br>
of obesity and food intake, the prior art includes reports of compounds and<br>
compositions that act as agonists or antagonists of MC4-R. As examples,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,060,589 describes polypeptides that are capable of<br>
modulating signaling activity of melanocortin receptors. Also, U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,054,556 and 5,731,408 describe families of agonists and antagonists<br>
for MC4-R receptors that are lactam heptapeptides having a cyclic structure.<br>
WO 01/10842 discloses MC4-R binding compounds having a multitude of<br>
structures and methods of using such compounds to treat MC4-R associated<br><br>
disorders. Some of the compounds described include amidino- and guanidino-<br>
containing arenes and heteroarenes.<br>
[0007]	Various other classes of compounds have been disclosed as<br>
having MC4-R agonist activity. For example, WO 01/70708 and WO<br>
00/74679 disclose MC4-R agonists that are piperidine compounds and<br>
derivatives, while WO 01/70337 and WO 99/64002 disclose MC-R agonists<br>
that are spiropiperidine derivatives. Other known melanocortin receptor<br>
agonists include aromatic amine compounds containing amino acid residues,<br>
particularly tryptophan residues, as disclosed in WO 01/55106. Similar<br>
agonists are disclosed in WO 01/055107 which comprise aromatic amine<br>
compounds containing tertiary amide or tertiary amine groups. Finally, WO<br>
01/055109 discloses melanocortin receptor agonists comprising aromatic<br>
amines which are generally bisamides separated by a nitrogen-containing<br>
alkyl linker.<br>
[0008]	Guanidine-containing compounds having a variety of biological<br>
activities are also known in the prior art. For example, U.S. patent No.<br>
4,732,916 issued to Satoh et al. discloses guanidine compounds useful as<br>
antiulcer agents; U.S. Patent No. 4,874,864, U.S. Patent No. 4,949,891, and<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,948,901 issued to Schnur et al. and EP 0343 894 disclose<br>
guanidino compounds useful as protease inhibitors and as anti-plasmin and<br>
anti-thrombin agents; and U.S. Patent No. 5,352,704 issued to Okuyama et al.<br>
discloses a guanidino compound useful as an antiviral agent.^jjanjdjne-<br>
containing compounds are also disclosed in other references. For example,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,030,985 issuedto Gentile et al. discloses guanidine<br>
compounds useful for treating and preventing conditions in which inhibition of<br>
nitric oxide synthetase is beneficial such as stroke, schizophrenia, anxiety,<br>
and pain. U.S. Patent No. 5,952,381 issued to Chen al discloses certain<br>
guanidine compounds for use in selectively inhibiting or antagonizing αvβ3<br>
integrins. <br><br>
[0009]	Various 5-, 6-, and 7- membered fully saturated 1-<br>
azacarbocyclic-2-ylidene derivatives of guanidine are disclosed as having<br>
anti-secretory and hypoglycemic activities by U.S. Patent No. 4,211,867<br>
issued to Rasmussen. Such compounds are also taught as useful for the<br>
treatment of cardiovascular disease. Other guanidine derivatives are<br>
disclosed by U.S. Patent No. 5,885,985 issued to Macdonald et al. as useful<br>
in therapy to treat inflammation. Various guanidinobenzamide compounds<br>
are disclosed in WO 02/18327. The guanidinobenzamides are disclosed as<br>
useful for treating obesity and type II diabetes.<br>
[0010]	The synthesis of various quinazolinone compounds is set forth<br>
in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/444,495, published on January 29, 2004 as<br>
US 2004/0019049, international application number PCT/US03/16442,<br>
published on December 4, 2003 as WO 03/099818, U.S. Patent Application<br>
No. 10/850,967, filed on May 21, 2004; international application no.<br>
PCT/US04/15959; and U.S. Provisional Application Nos. 60/382,762,<br>
60/441,019, 60/473,317, 60/523,336, and 60/524,492 each of which is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety and for all purposes as if fully set forth<br>
herein.<br>
[0011]	Despite the recent disclosure of various compounds that exhibit<br>
MC4-R agonist activity, a need remains for new compounds and<br>
pharmaceutical compositions that may be used to treat MC4-R mediated<br>
diseases and disease states. A need also remains for compounds that exhibit<br>
desirable pharmacological properties such as compounds that have reduced<br>
bioaccumulation properties in subjects to which they are administered.<br>

[0033]	Alkenyl groups are straight chain, branched or cyclic lower alkyl<br>
groups having 2 to about 8 carbon atoms, and further including at least one<br>
double bond, as exemplified, for instance, by vinyl, propenyl, 2-butenyl, 3-<br>
butenyl, isobutenyl, cyclohexenyl, cyclopentenyl, cyclohexadienyl, butadienyl,<br>
pentadienyl, and hexadienyl groups among others.<br>
[0034]	Alkynyl groups are straight chain or branched lower alkyl groups<br>
having 2 to about 8 carbon atoms, and further including at least one triple<br>
bond, as exemplified by groups, including, but not limited to, ethynyl, propynyl,<br>

[0035]	Aryl groups are cyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that do not contain<br>
heteroatoms. Thus aryl groups include, but are not limited to, phenyl,<br>
azulene, heptalene, biphenylene, indacene, fluorene, phenanthrene,<br>
triphenylene, pyrene, naphthacene, chrysene, biphenyl, anthracenyl, and<br>
naphthenyl groups. Although the phrase "aryl groups" includes groups<br>
containing fused rings, such as fused aromatic-aliphatic ring systems, it does<br>
not include aryl groups that have other groups, such as alkyl or halo groups,<br>
bonded to one of the ring members. Rather, groups such as tolyl are referred<br>
to as substituted aryl groups. Representative substituted aryl groups may be<br>
mono-substituted or substituted more than once, such as, but not limited to, 2-<br>
, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-substituted phenyl or benzyl groups, which may be substituted<br>
with groups including, but not limited to, amino, alkoxy, alkyl, cyano, or halo.<br><br>
In some embodiments, aryl groups have from 6 to 14 ring member carbon<br>
atoms.<br>
[0036]	Cycloalkylalkyl groups are alkyl groups as defined above in<br>
which a hydrogen or carbon bond of an alkyl group is replaced with a bond to<br>
a cycloaikyl group as defined above.<br>

hydrogen or carbon bond of an alkyl group is replaced with a bond to an aryl<br>
group as defined above.<br>
[0038]	Heterocyclyl groups are nonaromatic ring compounds containing<br>
3 or more ring members, of which, one or more is a heteroatom such as, but<br>
not limited to, N, O, and S. The phrase "heterocyclyl group" includes fused<br>
ring species including those comprising fused aromatic and nonaromatic<br>
groups. The phrase also includes polycyclic ring systems containing a<br>
heteroatom such as, but not limited to, quinuclidyl. However, the phrase does<br>
not include heterocyclyl groups that have other groups, such as alkyl or halo<br>
groups, bonded to one of the ring members. Rather, these are referred to as<br>
"substituted heterocyclyl groups". Heterocyclyl groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, piperazino, morpholino, thiomorpholino, pyrrolidino, piperidino and<br>
homopiperazino groups. Representative substituted heterocyclyl groups may<br>
be mono-substituted or substituted more than once, such as, but not limited<br>
to, morpholino or piperazino groups, which are 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 6-substituted,<br>
or disubstituted with groups including, but not limited to, amino, alkoxy, alkyl,<br>
cyano, or halo.<br>

oxathiazine, azepin, oxepin, thiepin, diazepine, benzofuran, and<br>
isobenzofuran. Although the phrase "heteroaryl groups" inclu'des fused ring<br>
compounds, the phrase does not include heteroaryl groups that have other<br>
groups bonded to one of the ring members, such as alkyl groups. Rather,<br>
heteroaryl groups with such substitution are referred to as "substituted<br>
heteroaryl groups". Representative substituted heteroaryl groups may be<br>
substituted one or more times with groups including, but not limited to, amino,<br>
alkoxy, alkyl, cyano, or halo. In some embodiments, heteroaryl groups<br>
include from 5 to 14 ring members.<br>
[0040]	Heterocyclylalkyl groups are alkyl groups as defined above in<br>
which a hydrogen or carbon bond of an alkyl group is replaced with a bond to<br>
a heterocyclyl group as defined above.<br>
[0041]	Heteroarylalkyl groups are alkyl groups as defined above in<br>
which a hydrogen or carbon bond of an alkyl group is replaced with a bond to<br>
a heteroaryl group as defined above.<br>
[0042]	Aminocarbonyl groups are groups of the formula RR'NC(O)-,<br>
wherein R or R' may be the same or different, and each is independently<br>
selected from H, or substituted or unsubstituted alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl,<br>
heterocyclyl or heteroaryl groups, as defined above.<br>
[0043]	In general, "substituted" refers to a group as defined above in<br>
which one or more bonds to a hydrogen atom contained therein are replaced<br>
by a bond to non-hydrogen or non-carbon atoms such as, but not limited to, a<br>
halogen atom such as F, CI, Br, and I; an oxygen atom in groups such as<br>
hydroxyl groups, alkoxy groups, aryloxy groups, and ester groups; a sulfur<br>
atom in groups such as thiol groups, alkyl and aryl sulfide groups, sulfone<br>
groups, sulfonyl groups, and sulfoxide groups; a nitrogen atom in groups such<br>
as amines, amides, alkylamines, diaikylamines, arylamines, alkylarylamines,<br>
diarylamines, N-oxides, imides, and enamines; a silicon atom in groups such<br><br>
as in trialkylsilyl groups, dialkylarylsilyl groups, alkyldiarylsilyl groups, and<br>
triarylsilyl groups; and other heteroatoms in various other groups. Substituted<br>
alkyl groups and also substituted cycloalkyl groups and others also include<br>
groups in which one or more bonds to a carbon(s) or hydrogen(s) atom is<br>
replaced by a bond to a heteroatom such as oxygen in carbonyl, carboxyl,<br>
and ester groups; nitrogen in groups such as imines, oximes, hydrazones,<br>
and nitriles.<br>
[0044]	Substituted cycloalkyl, substituted aryl, substituted heterocyclyl<br>
and substituted heteroaryl also include rings and fused ring systems in which<br>
a bond to a hydrogen atom is replaced with a bond to a carbon atom.<br>
Therefore, substituted cycloalkyl, substituted aryl, substituted heterocyclyl and<br>
substituted heteroaryl groups may also be substituted with alkyl groups as<br>
defined above.<br>

suspending agents, emulsifying agents, may be added for oral or parenteral<br>
administration.<br>
[0062]	As noted above, suspensions may include oils. Such oils<br>
include, but are not limited to, peanut oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, corn oil<br>
and olive oil. Suspension preparation may also contain esters of fatty acids<br>
such as ethyl oleate, isopropyl myristate, fatty acid glycerides and acetylated<br>
fatty acid glycerides. Suspension formulations may include alcohols, such as,<br>
but not limited to, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, hexadecyl alcohol, glycerol and<br>
propylene glycol. Ethers, such as but not limited to, poly(ethyleneglycol),<br>
petroleum hydrocarbons such as mineral oil and petrolatum; and water may<br>
also be used in suspension formulations.<br>
[0063]	For intranasal.administration (e.g., to deliver compounds to the<br>
brain), or administration by inhalation (e.g., to deliver compounds through the<br>
lungs), the pharmaceutical formulations may be a solution, a spray, a dry<br>
powder, or aerosol containing any appropriate solvents and optionally other<br>
compounds such as, but not limited to, stabilizers, antimicrobial agents,<br>
antioxidants, pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and<br>
combinations of these. Examples of intranasal formulations and methods of<br>
administration can be found in WO 01/41782, WO 00/33813, WO 91/97947,<br>
U.S. Patent No. 6,180,603, U.S. Patent No. 5,624,898; Published U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. 2003/0229025 (U.S. Serial No." 10/374,507); and WO<br>
03/072056 each of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety<br>
and for all purposes as if fully set forth herein. A propellant for an aerosol<br>
formulation may include compressed air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, or a<br>
hydrocarbon based low boiling solvent. The compound or compounds of the<br>
instant invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray<br>
presentation from a nebulizer or the like.<br><br>
[0064]	Injectable dosage forms generally include aqueous suspensions<br>
or oil suspensions which may be prepared using a suitable dispersant or<br>
wetting agent and a suspending agent. Injectable forms may be in solution<br>
phase or in the form of a suspension, which is prepared with a solvent or<br>
diluent. Acceptable solvents or vehicles include sterilized water, Ringer's<br>
solution, or an isotonic aqueous saline solution. Alternatively, sterile oils may<br>
be employed as solvents or suspending agents. Preferably, the oil or fatty<br>
acid is non-volatile, including natural or synthetic oils, fatty acids, mono-, di- or<br>
tri-glycerides.<br>
[0065]	For injection, the pharmaceutical formulation may be a powder<br>
suitable for reconstitution with an appropriate solution as described above.<br>
Examples of these include, but are not limited to, freeze dried, rotary dried or<br>
spray dried powders, amorphous powders, granules, precipitates, or<br>
particulates. For injection, the formulations may optionally contain stabilizers,<br>
pH modifiers, surfactants, bioavailability modifiers and combinations of these.<br>
The compounds may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection<br>
such as by bolus injection or continuous infusion. A unit dosage form for<br>
injection may be in ampoules or in multi-dose containers.<br>
10066]	For rectal administration, the pharmaceutical formulations may<br>
be in the form of a suppository, an ointment, an enema, a tablet or a cream for<br>
release of compound in the intestines, sigmoid flexure and/or rectum. Rectal<br>
suppositories are prepared by mixing one or more compounds of the instant<br>
invention, or pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts or tautomers of the compound,<br>
with acceptable vehicles, for example, cocoa butter or polyethylene glycol,<br>
which is present in a solid phase at normal storing temperatures, and present<br>
in a liquid phase at those temperatures suitable to release a drug inside the<br>
body, such as in the rectum. Oils may also be employed in the preparation of<br>
formulations of the soft gelatin type and suppositories. Water, saline,<br>
aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycerols may be<br>
employed in the preparation of suspension formulations which may also<br>
contain suspending agents such as pectins, carbomers, methyl cellulose,<br><br>
hydroxypropyl cellulose or carboxymethyl cellulose, as well as buffers and<br>
preservatives.<br>
[0067]	Besides those representative dosage forms described above,<br>
pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients and carriers are generally known to<br>
those skilled in the art and are thus included in the instant invention. Such<br>
excipients and carriers are described, for example, in "Remingtons<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences" Mack Pub. Co., New Jersey (1991), which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0068]	The formulations of the invention may be designed for to be<br>
short-acting, fast-releasing, iong-acting, and sustained-releasing as described<br>
below. Thus, the pharmaceutical formulations may also be formulated for<br>
controlled release or for slow release.<br>
[0069]	The instant compositions may also comprise, for example,<br>
micelles or liposomes, or some other encapsulated form, or may be<br>
administered in an extended release form to provide a prolonged storage<br>
and/or delivery effect. Therefore, the pharmaceutical formulations may be<br>
compressed into pellets or cylinders and implanted intramuscularly or<br>
subcutaneously as depot injections or as implants such as stents. Such<br>
implants may employ known inert materials such as silicones and<br>
biodegradable polymers.<br>
[0070]	A therapeutically effective dose refers to that amount of the<br>
compound that results in amelioration of symptoms. Specific dosages may be<br>
adjusted depending on conditions of disease, the age, body weight, general<br>
health conditions, sex, diet of the subject, dose intervals, administration<br>
routes, excretion rate, and combinations of drugs. Any of the above dosage<br>
forms containing effective-amounts are well within the bounds of routine<br>
experimentation and therefore, well within the scope of the instant invention.<br>
A therapeutically effective dose may vary depending upon the route of<br>
administration and dosage form. The preferred compound or compounds of<br><br>
the instant invention is a formulation that exhibits a high therapeutic index.<br>
The therapeutic index is the dose ratio between toxic and therapeutic effects<br>
which can be expressed as the ratio between LD50 and ED50. The LD50 is the<br>
dose lethal to 50% of the population and the ED50 is the dose therapeutically<br>
effective'in 50% of the population. The LD50 and ED50 are determined by<br>
standard pharmaceutical procedures in animal cell cultures or experimental<br>
animals.<br>
[0071]	The present invention also provides methods of enhancing<br>
MC4-R activity in a human or non-human animal. The method comprises<br>
administering an effective amount of a compound, or composition, of the<br>
instant invention to said mammal or non-human animal. Effective amounts of<br>
the compounds of the instant invention include those amounts-that activate<br>
MC4-R which are detectable, for example, by an assay described below in the<br>
illustrative Examples, or any other assay known by those skilled in the art that<br>
a detect signal transduction, in a biochemical pathway, through activation of<br>
G-protein coupled receptors, for example, by measuring an elevated cAMP<br>
level as compared to a control model. Accordingly, "activating" means the<br>
ability of a compound to initiate a detectable signal. Effective amounts may<br>
also include those amounts which alleviate symptoms of a MC4-R disorder<br>
treatable by activating MC4-R.<br>
[0072]	An MC4-R disorder, or MC4-R-mediated disease, which may be<br>
treated by those methods provided, include any biological disorder or disease<br>
in which MC4-R is implicated, or which inhibition of MC4-R potentiates a<br>
biochemical pathway that is defective in the disorder or disease state.<br>
Examples of such diseases are obesity, erectile disorders, cardiovascular<br>
disorders, neuronal injuries or disorders, inflammation, fever, cognitive<br>
disorders, type II diabetes, polycystic ovary disease, Syndrome X,<br>
complications from obesity and diabetes, and sexual behavior disorders. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the instant invention provides compounds,<br>
compositions, and methods effective for reducing energy intake and body<br>
weight; reducing serum insulin and glucose levels; alleviating insulin<br><br>
resistance; and reducing serum levels of free fatty acids. Accordingly, the<br>
instant invention is particularly effective in treating those disorders or diseases<br>
associated with obesity or type II diabetes.<br>
[0073]	"Treating" within the context of the instant invention, therefore,<br>
means an alleviation of symptoms associated with a disorder or disease, or<br>
halt of further progression or worsening of those symptoms, or prevention or<br>
prophylaxis of the disease or disorder. For example, within the context of<br>
obesity, successful treatment may include an alleviation of symptoms or<br>
halting the progression of the disease, as measured by reduction in body<br>
weight, or a reduction in amount of food or energy intake. In this same vein,<br>
successful treatment of type I or type II diabetes may include an alleviation of<br>
symptoms or halting the progression of the disease, as measured by a<br>
decrease in serum glucose or insulin levels in, for example, hyperinsulinemic<br>
or hyperglycemic patients.<br>
[0074]	Scheme 1a illustrates a general synthetic route that may be<br>
used to synthesize various guanidinyl-substituted quinazolinone compounds.<br>
As shown in Scheme 1a, nitro and amino quinazolinone compounds such as<br>
(d) and (e) may be readily converted into a plethora of guanidinyl<br>
quinazolinones by converting the amino functionality to an isothiocyanate<br>
functionality such as possessed by compound (f). This may be accomplished<br>
reacting the amine group with thiophosgene. Isothiocyanate compounds such<br>
as (0 may then be readily converted into a thiourea such as compound (g) by<br>
reaction with a suitable amine compound such as (1S,2S,3S,5R)-(+)-<br>
isopinocampheylamine. Preparation of the desired guanidinylamine such as<br>
compound (h) may then be accomplished by reacting the thiourea with a<br>
compound such as 1-[3-(dimethyIamino)-propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide<br>
hydrochloride and then with a suitable amine such as cis-2,6-<br>
dimethylpiperazine, (S)-2-(fluoromethyl)piperazine, or the like. Various<br>
fluorine-substituted compounds may be prepared using the methodology<br>
shown in Scheme 1a using an appropriately substituted 4-nitroanthranilic acid.<br><br>
Other compounds may be prepared by using 5-nitroanthranilic acid in place of<br>
4-nitroanthranilic acid.<br><br>
[0075]	Scheme 1b illustrates another generally applicable method that<br>
may be employed to synthesize a large number of guanidinyl-substituted<br>
quinazolinones and heterocyclic derivatives of such compounds where a<br>
carbon of the benzene ring of the quinazolinone is replaced with a nitrogen<br>
atom. As shown in Scheme 1b, conversion of compound (d) to (e) may be<br>
accomplished by initially adding trimethylphosphine to form a reactive<br>
iminophosphorane intermediate, adding a substituted isocyanate such as a<br><br>
cycloalkyl isocyanate for example, a polycyclic isocyanate to produce a<br>
carbodiimide, and finally forming (e) by addition of and reaction with an amine<br>
such as, but not limited to a substituted piperazine.<br>

used to prepare a wide variety of guanidinyl-substituted quinazolinone<br>
compounds.<br>

compounds of the invention is depicted in Scheme 2c.<br>

SYNTHESIS OF 6-METHYLPIPERAZIN-2-ONE<br><br>
Step 1:	Synthesis of N-Boc-alanine-N'-benzyl glycine methyl ester<br>
(D<br>
[0081]	To a stirred solution of N-Boc-L-alanine (1 equivalent) and N-<br>
benzyl glycine methyl ester (1 equivalent) in dichioromethane was added TEA<br>
(1 equivalent) and HOBt (1 equivalent)', followed by EDCI (1 equivalent). The<br>
solution was allowed to stir at room temperature under N2 for 48 hours. The<br>
reaction was diluted with 10% HCI, and the organic layer was separated and<br>
dried over MgS04. Crude product was chromatographed on silica (30%<br>
EtOAc/hexanes) giving the desired product (1) as a clear oil (75%).<br>
Step 2.	Synthesis of [benzyI-(2-tertbutoxycarbonylamino-propyl)-<br>
amino]-acetic acid methyl ester (2)<br>
[0082]	To a stirred solution of BH3 in THF (1 M, 2 equivalents), was<br>
added dropwise a solution of dipeptide (1) in THF. The reaction was then<br>
maintained at room temperature for 24 hours and then diluted with methylene<br>
chloride, washed with NaHC03, and dried over MgS04. Crude product was<br><br>
chromatographed on silica eluting with 20% EtOAc/hexanes giving the<br>
desired product (2) a colorless oil (40%).<br>
Step 3.	Synthesis of 1-benzyl-5-(S)-methyI-3-oxo-piperazine (3)<br>
[0083]	Ester (2) was stirred in a 50:50 solution of TFA:CH2CI2 for 1<br>
hour. The solvent was then removed, and the residue was redissolved in<br>
methylene chloride and washed with a saturated solution of Na2C03. The<br>
organic layer was then separated and dried over MgS04 giving desired<br>
piperazine compound (3) as a white solid (87%).<br>
Step 4.	Synthesis of 6-(S)-methylpiperazin-2-one (4)<br>
[0084]	To a dichloroethane solution of 3 at room temperature was<br>
added 3 equivalents of chloroethylchloroformate and Hunig's base (3<br>
equivalents). The solution was stirred overnight, and the reaction was then<br>
directly loaded onto a silica gel column and chromatographed eluting with<br>
EtOAc/hexanes (4:6). The isolated carbamate intermediate was dissolved in<br>
methanol and heated at reflux for 2 hours. Removal of methanol provided the<br>
.. desired piperazin-2-one (4) as an off white solid (yield was not optimized, but<br>
was approximately 60% for the 2 steps). 6(S)-methyl piperazin-2-one<br>
compounds of the invention were made according to the following methods by<br>
EDC activation of the thiourea intermediate to the carbodiimide followed by<br>
coupling with 6(S)-methyl piperazin-2-one.<br>
Synthesis of 6-(S)-methylpiperazin-2-one guanidine<br>
compounds<br>
[0085]	6(S)-Methyl piperazin-2-one guanidine compounds of the<br>
invention were prepared according to the methods described herein by EDC<br>
activation of the thiourea intermediate to provide the carbodiimide followed by<br>
coupling with 6(S)-Methyl piperazin-2-one.<br><br>
SYNTHESIS OF 2-(R)-FLUOROMETHYLPIPERAZINE AND<br>
2-(R)-DIFLUOROIWETHYLPIPERAZINE<br>
Synthesis of 2-(R)-Fiuoromethylpiperazine<br><br><br><br>
Step 1.	Synthesis of N-benzyl serine methyl ester<br>
[0086]	To a stirred solution of serine methyl ester hydrochloride (3.0 g,<br>
19.28 mmol) and triethylamine (2.7 mL, 19.28 mmol) in methylene chloride<br>
(30 mL) was added benzaldehyde (1 equivalent), followed by 2 g anhydrous<br>
MgS04. The mixture was stirred at room temperature in a sealed flask for 20<br>
hours, and then the solids were filtered away, and the filtrate was evaporated.<br>
The residue was redissolved in methanol (50 mL), and sodium borohydride (1<br>
equivalent) was carefully added. The mixture was stirred for 30 minutes, was<br><br>
diluted with methylene chloride, was washed with NaHC03, and was then<br>
dried over magnesium sulfate. The desired title product was obtained as a<br>
yellow oil and was used crude. N-4-methoxybenzyl serine methyl ester was<br>
made in a similar fashion using anisaldehyde in place of benzaldehyde.<br>
Step 2.	Synthesis of N-benzyl-N-chloroacetyl serine methyl ester<br>
[0087]	To an ice cooled solution of the crude benzyl amino acid<br>
prepared as described in Step 1 and triethylamine (1 equivalent) in methylene<br>
chloride, was added chloroacetyl chloride (1 equivalent) dropwise. After 1<br>
hour, the reaction was washed with 10% HCI, and the organic layer was<br>
separated and dried over sodium sulfate. Crude product was<br>
chromatographed on silica gel eluting with 60% EtOAc/hexanes (Rf = 0.3)<br>
giving the desired title compound as a colorless oil (67%).<br>
Step 3.	Synthesis of df-N-benzyl cyclo serine glycine<br>
[0088]	The chloride prepared in Step 2 was dissolved in acetonitrile,<br>
and benzyl amine was added (3 equivalents). The solution was heated at<br>
reflux for 20 hours, during which time a solid formed in the flask. The reaction<br>
was cooled, and the solvent was removed. The residue was dissolved in<br>
methylene chloride, was washed with 10% HCI, and was dried over MgS04.<br>
Crude product was passed through a silica gel plug (100% EtOAc, Rf = 0.5)<br>
giving a white solid (80%). Di-N-4-methoxybenzyl cyclo serine glycine was<br>
made in a similar fashion using p-methoxybenzyl amine and the p-<br>
methoxybenzyl derivative of the starting material.<br>
Step 4.	Synthesis of 1,4-dibenzyl-2-(R)-piperazinemethanol<br>
[0089]	To an ice cooled mixture of LiAIH4 (10 equivalents) in anhydrous<br>
THF under N2 was added the cyclic dipeptide produced in Step 3 in THF<br>
dropwise. The resulting grey mixture was heated to reflux for 16 hours. The<br>
reaction was carefully quenched with HaO, NaOH, H2O (1:1:3), and the<br><br>
resulting white mixture was filtered through celite. The filtrate was dried over<br>
MgS04 and concentrated, giving the desired product as a colorless oil (93%).<br>
Step 5.	Synthesis of 1,4-dibenzyF-2-(R)-fluoromethylpiperazine<br>
[0090]	To an ice cooled solution of DAST (2 equivalents) in methylene<br>
chloride under N2 was added the alcohol prepared in Step 4 in methylene -<br>
chloride dropwise. The yellow solution was stirred at 0°C to room<br>
temperature for 20 hours. The reaction was diluted with NaHC03, and the<br>
organic layer was separated and dried over sodium sulfate. The crude<br>
product was chromatographed on silica gel eluting with 10-50%<br>
EtOAc/hexanes giving the desired title compound as a yellow oil (40%).<br>
Step 6	Synthesis of 2-(R)-fluoromethylpiperazine<br>
[0091]	1,4-DibenzyIfluoromethylpiperazine from Step 5 was dissolved<br>
in dichloroethane, and oc-chloroethyl chloroformate (3 equivalents) was added.<br>
The resulting solution was heated to reflux for 16 hours. The reaction was<br>
directly loaded onto a silica gel column and chromatographed eluting with 10-<br>
20% EtOAc/hexanes. The intermediate dicarbamate was isolated as a clear<br>
oil. The intermediate dicarbamate oil was dissolved in methanol and heated<br>
at reflux for 2 hours. The solvent was then thoroughly removed giving the<br>
desired deprotected piperazine as a white solid (90% for 2 steps).<br>
Synthesis of 1,4-di-p-methoxybenzyl-2-(R)-piperazine-<br>
carboxaidehyde 1,4-di-p-methoxybenzyl-2-(R)-<br>
difluoromethylpiperazine<br>
[0092]	To a dry flask containing a solution of oxalyl chloride in<br>
methylene chloride (2.0 M, 1.2 equivalents) at -78°C was added DMSO (2.4<br>
equivalents) dropwise under a stream of nitrogen. After stirring for 15<br>
minutes, a solution of 1,4-di-p-methoxybenzyl-2-(R)-piperazinemethanol (1<br>
equivalent) in methylene chloride was added dropwise, and the resulting<br>
solution was stirred for 1 hour. TEA (5 equivalents) was added, and the<br><br>
mixture was added to NaHCOs(aq), separated, and dried over MgS04. After<br>
filtering, the filtrate was cooled to -78°C, and DAST was added dropwise (1.2<br>
equivalents). The resulting orange solution was stirred for 12 hours. The<br>
reaction was then diluted with aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and the organic<br>
layer was separated and chromatographed in silica (10% EtOAc/hexanes)<br>
giving the desired title difluoro compound as a light brown oil (33%).<br>
Deprotection of the difluoride was carried out in the same manner as<br>
described in Step 6 using a-chloroethyl chloroformate giving a white solid<br>
(85%).<br>
Synthesis of 2-(R)-fluoromethyIpiperazine and 2-(R)-<br>
difluoromethylpiperazine guanidine compounds<br>
[0093]	2-(R)-Fluoromethylpiperazine and 2-(R)-<br>
difluoromethylpiperazine guanidine compounds of the invention were<br>
prepared according to the methods described herein by EDC activation of the<br>
thiourea intermediate to provide the carbodiimide followed by coupling with 2-<br>
(R)-fluoromethylpiperazine or 2-(R)-difluoromethylpiperazine.<br>
SYNTHESIS OF (6S)-6-METHYLP!PERAZIN-2-ONE)<br><br>
Step 1.	Synthesis of S-ethyl (2R)-2-{[(benzyloxy)carbonyi]-<br>
amino}propanethioate<br><br>
[0094]	A 250 mL round bottom flask was charged with benzyloxy-<br>
carbonyl-L alanine (15.0 g, 67.2 mmol) and 67.2 mL of dichloromethane. To<br><br>
this mixture was added DMAP (0.82 g, 6.72 mmol) and chilled EtSH (0°C,<br>
5.46 mL, 73.9 mmol) followed by the addition of DCC (15.2 g, 73.9 mmol) in<br>
one portion. The addition of the DCC is highly exothermic so the reaction will<br>
bubble upon addition, and the reaction should be kept well vented. The<br>
resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 22°C. The resulting white solid<br>
was then removed by vacuum filtration, and the filtrate was concentrated.<br>
Silica Gel chromatography using hexanes with polarization to 8:1<br>
hexanes/ethyl acetate afforded 93% yield (18.0g, 62.5 mmol) of the desired<br>
product as a colorless oil.<br>
Step 2.	Synthesis of Benzyl (1R)-1-methyI-2-oxoethylcarbamate<br><br>
[0095J	To a stirred solution containing S-ethyl (2R)-2-<br>
{[(benzyloxy)carbonyljamino}- propanethioate (18.9 g, 62.5 mmol), wet 10%<br>
Pd/C (1.89 g), and acetone (347 mL) at 0°C was added triethylsilane (29.9<br>
mL, 187.5 mmol). The resulting mixture was stirred for 30 minutes at 0°C and<br>
then filtered through celite using ethyl acetate to wash the celite thoroughly.<br>
The filtrate was concentrated and partitioned between acetonitrile (500 mL)<br>
and hexanes (150 mL). The layers were separated, and the acetonitrile<br>
phase was washed once with hexane (150 mL) and then concentrated to<br>
provide the desired product (59.4 mmol, 95%) which was used in the next<br>
step without further purification.<br>
Step 3.	Synthesis of Methyl N-((2R)-2-{[(benzyloxy)carbonyl]-<br>
amino}propyl)glycinate<br><br><br>
[0096J	,'A 1000 mL round bottom flask was charged with benzyl (1 R)-1-<br>
methyl-2-oxoethylcarbamate (59.4 mmol) and 347 mL of anhydrous methanol.<br>
The resulting mixture was cooled to 0°C and glycine methyl ester<br>
hydrochloride (29.3 g, 237.6 mmol) was added. After 10 minutes, 1.0 M<br>
NaCNBH4 in THF (95 mL, 95.0 mmol)was added and the reaction was<br>
allowed to warm'to 22"C overnight. The reaction mixture was then<br>
concentrated, redissolved in diethyl ether (200 mL) and placed in a separatory<br>
funnel. The organic phase was washed with saturated NaHC03 (200 mL)<br>
and separated. The basic aqueous layer was washed twice with diethyl ether<br>
(2 x 200 mL), and the combined organic layers were washed with brine (2 x<br>
200 mL), dried with Na2SC&gt;4 and concentrated. Silica gel chromatography<br>
using 2:1 hexanes/ethyl acetate with gradual polarization to 1:1 hexanes/ethyl<br>
acetate provided the desired product as a clear oil in 75% yield (12.5 g, 44.6<br>
mmol).<br>
Step 4.	Synthesis of (6S)-6-Methylpiperazin-2-one)<br><br>
[0097]	To a solution of methyl N-((2R)-2-{[(benzyloxy)carbonyi]-<br>
amino}propyl)glycinate (12.5 g, 44.6 mmol) in anhydrous methanol (446 mL)<br>
under an atmosphere of N2 was added 10% Pd/C (1.25 g). The flask was<br>
then placed on a Buchi hydrogenator and purged three times with N2 followed<br>
by 3 times with H2. The reaction was allowed to stir under hydrogen (2.2 L,<br>
98.12 mmol) until no more hydrogen was consumed. Once complete (24<br>
hours), the reaction mixture was poured through Celite and the filtrate was<br>
concentrated. Ethyl acetate(5-10 mL) was added causing a white solid to<br>
crash out. This white solid was dried and collected to provide the desired<br>
product in 95% yield (4.8 g, 42.37 mmol). (The filtrate can be concentrated<br>
and more of the product can be crashed out by addition of ethyl acetate. If<br>
any starting material remains, it will be in the filtrate.<br><br>
SYNTHESIS OF (3R,4R)-3,4-PYRROLIDINEDIOL HYDROCHLORIDE<br><br>
[0098]	(3R,4R)-1-(Phenylmethyl)-3,4-pyrrolidinedio! (250 mg, 1.30<br>
mmo!) was dissolved in ethyl acetate and added to a suspension of 10% Pd<br>

[0178]	3-(2-Fluoro-4-methoxy-phenyl)-N-methyl-propionamide was<br>
synthesized using an EDCI mediated coupling of 3-(2-fluoro-4-methoxy-<br>
phenyl)-N-methyl-propionic acid and methylamine (2M solution in THF). The<br>
amide was then taken up in POCb in a microwave vessel and the mixture was<br>
stirred about 3 minutes. To the stirred solution was added about 1 equivalent<br>
of 4-nitroanthranilic acid. The unsealed vial was stirred for 10 minutes until<br>
there was a color change from red to yellow. The vial was then sealed and<br>
reacted in a microwave unit at 165°C for 600 seconds. Reaction completion<br>
was checked with LC/MS. 2-[2-(2-Fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-methyl-7-<br>
nitro-3-hydroquinazo!in-4-one was then purified by column chromatography,<br>
eluting with EtOAc in hexanes. 2-[2-(2-Fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]-3-<br>
methyl-7-nitro-3-hydroquinazolin-4-one was then converted to Example 90<br>
using the procedures described above through the corresponding thiourea<br>

(C)<br><br>
[0179]	The synthesis of nitrile A was first conducted as described in J.<br>
Heterocyclic Chem., 35, 659 (1998)). Nitrile A was heated in an excess of N-<br>
methylpiperazine to 110°C in a microwave for 600 seconds and analyzed by<br>
LC/MS to provide B and C. Products B and C were separated by column<br>
chromatography on silica gel eluting with 10% MeOH in CH2CI2. Compound B<br>
was the first to come off the column. Compounds B and C were then<br>
respectively converted to Examples 99 and 71 using the procedures<br>
described herein.<br>
Method 4 Synthesis of 3-[2-(2-fluoror4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]-7-nitro-2-<br>

[0180]	Nitrile 1 shown above (0.9 g, 2.4 mmoles) was dissolved in dry<br>
DMF (5 mL). Sodium azide (0.8 g, 12.2 mmoles) was added and the mixture<br>
was heated at 125°C for 1 hour. The reaction was cooled, diluted with water<br>
(25 mL), and filtered. The collected solid was redissolved in THF/EtOAc 1:1<br>
(25 mL), washed with water (25 mL), and dried over MgSCU. Filtration and<br>
solvent removal afforded 650 mg of a brown solid. The 1H NMR (DMSO-D6,<br>
300 MHz) was consistent with desired product formation. The product was<br>
converted to Example 78 using the procedures described herein.<br>
Method 5 Synthesis of 3-[2-(4-fIuorophenyI)ethyl]-2-[(4-<br>
methylpiperazinyl)-methyl]-7-nitro-3-hydroquinazoIin-4-one<br>
(3)<br>
Step 1	Synthesis of 2-chloro-N-[2-(4-fluoro-phenyI)-ethyl]-<br>
acetamide (1)<br><br>
[0181]	To a solution of 4-fluorophenylethylamine (1.0 equivalent) in<br>
dried THF was added Hunig's base (DIEA)(1 equivalent). The mixture was<br>
then stirred for 3 minutes at 0°C. Thereafter, a solution of<br>
chloroacetylchloride (1.0 equivalent) in THF was added via a syringe over a<br>
period of 7 minutes. The reaction mixture was then stirred at room<br>
temperature for 1 hour after which time the reaction mixture was condensed in<br>
vacuo, quenched with water, extracted with ethyl acetate (3X) and dried over<br>
Na2S04. After concentration in vacuo, compound 1 shown above was<br>
obtained, which was carried on further without further purification. LC/MS=<br>
M+H 216.1 at 2.18 minutes.<br><br>
Step 2	Synthesis of 2-chloromethyl-3-[2-(4-fluoro-phenyI)-ethyl]-7-<br>
nitro-3H-quinazolin-4-one (2)<br><br>
[0182]	Compound 1 (1.2 equivalents) was dissolved in neat POCU and<br>
allowed to stir under N2 for 5 minutes. Solid 4-nitroanthranilic acid (1.0<br>
equivalent) was then added, and the mixture was allowed to stir at room<br>
temperature for 10 minutes until the color changed to yellow from red.<br>
Thereafter, the reaction mixture was refluxed at 100°C for 2 hours, followed<br>
by removal of POCI3 in vacuo (addition of triethylamine to the rotovap<br>
condenser). The crude product so obtained was neutralized with a saturated<br>
solution of NaHCC-3, extracted with ethyl acetate (3 times), dried over Na2S04,<br>
and condensed in vacuo. Purification of the crude product was carried out<br>
with column chromatography in several batches using a gradient of EtOAc in<br>
hexanes. LC/MS = M+H 3.62 at 3.5 minutes.<br>
Step 3	Synthesis of 3-[2-(4-fluorophenyl)ethyl]-2-[(4-<br>
methyIpiperazinyl)-methyl]-7-nitro-3-hydroquinazolin-4-one<br>
(3)<br><br>
[0183]	A solution of 2 (1 equivalent) and 4-methylpiperazine (3<br>
equivalents) in 2 mL NMP were heated at 80°C. After stirring for 18 hours,<br>
the dark brown solution was diluted with ethyl acetate and washed twice with<br>
water. The organic phase was then dried with sodium sulfate, filtered and<br>
concentrated in vacuo, and taken on to the next step without further<br>
purification. Compound 3 was then converted to Example 69 using the<br><br>
procedures described herein. This procedure yielded a dark oil, and small<br>
amounts of NMP may remain in the product. Formation of some analogous<br>
compounds required the addition of three equivalents of diisopropyl ethyl<br>
amine. Similar chemistry was used to prepare Examples 67, 70, 72, 74, 75,<br>
79, and 81 as identified in the following tables.<br>

nitro-3-hydroquinazolin-4-one<br><br>
[0184]	2,4-Difluorophenol (2.5 equivalents) was added to 2-<br>
(ch!oromethyl)-3-methyl-7-nitro-3-hydroquinazolin-4-one (2a) in acetone and<br>
refluxed for 8 hours. The solution was then cooled to room temperature,<br>
washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate, dried and filtered over sodium<br>
sulfate and concentrated in vacuo to afford 2-[(2,4-difluorophenoxy)methyl]-3-<br>
methyl-7-nitro-3-hydroquinazolin-4-one in quantitative yields. Compound 3a<br>
was then converted to Example 88 using the procedures described herein.<br>
Similar chemistry was used to prepare Examples 68, 89, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96,<br>
97, 98, and 100 as identified in the following tables.<br>
METHOD 6	Synthesis of 3-[2-(2-fIuoro-4-methoxyphenyI)ethyl]-7-<br>
nitrobenzo[d]1,2,3-triazin-4-one<br><br><br>
[0185]	A mixture of benzamide (1) (3.42 mmol), water (40 mL), and<br>
concentrated HCI (12 mL) was cooled in an ice bath', and a solution of NaNC&gt;2<br>
(3.6 mmol) in water (5 mL) was added drop wise. The mixture was stirred for<br>
1 hour, and 20 mL 10 N NaOH was added. The stirring was continued for<br>
another hour, and the reaction was neutralized with AcOH, extracted with<br>
methylene chloride, and dried over MgS04. The crude product was<br>
chromatographed on silica (30%) EtOAc/hexanes) yielding the desired<br>
product as a yellow solid. The purified compound was then converted to<br>
Example 102 using the procedures described herein.<br>
Method 7 Synthesis of 6-amino-2-[2-(2-fluoro-4-methoxyphenyl)ethyl]-<br>
2-hydroisoquinoIin-1-one<br>
Step 1<br><br>
[0186]	The diacid A (1 equivalent) was added to a flask equipped with a<br>
reflux condenser and dean stark trap and charged with dry toluene. The<br>
mixture was heated to reflux and then 2-(2-fluoro-4-methoxy-phenyl)-<br>
ethylamine B (1 equivalent) was added. The reaction was kept at reflux<br>
overnight, and then the toluene was removed by rotary evaporation.<br>
Purification by flash chromatography using ethyl acetate/hexanes provided<br>
the product C in 30% yield.<br><br>
Step 2<br><br>
[0187]	The imide (C) was dissolved in CH2CI2 and cooled to -78°C. 3<br>
equivalents of D1BAL (1M in CH2CI2) were added, and the reaction was stirred<br>
at -78°C for 1 hour when LC/MS indicated completion of the reaction. The<br>
solution was then diluted with ether and 10 equivalents of NaF and 4<br>
equivalents water were added. The reaction was then stirred for an hour.<br>
The reaction was then filtered through Celite® to yield the crude pyridone<br>
amine (D). Compound D was then converted to Example 103 using the<br>
procedures described herein. Similar chemistry was used to prepare<br>
Example 104 as identified in the final table.<br><br>

In Vivo Studies of MC4-R Agonists on Energy Intake, Body Weight,<br>
Hyperinsulinemia, and Glucose Levels<br>
[0199]	In vivo studies are conducted to observe the effect of MCR-4<br>
agonists on energy intake, body weight, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose levels.<br>
All studies are conducted with male 9-10 week old ob/ob mice which display<br>
early onset of obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes due to leptin deficiency.<br>
Mice are acclimated in the facility for 1 week before studies and are caged<br>
individually. Vehicle-treated (control) and drug treated mice studies are<br>
always run in parallel. In multi-day studies, mice (8-15 per group) are<br>
monitored for baseline body weight, fasting levels of glucose, insulin, blood<br>
lipids and energy expenditure and then injected twice daily (9 a.m. and 5 p.m.)<br>
with 3 mg/kg of a MC4-R agonist of the present invention for 4 weeks. Body<br>
weight as well as food and water intake are monitored daily. Animals are<br>
fasted overnight for measurements of fasting levels of glucose, insulin, and<br><br>
lipids once a week until the end of the study. Energy expenditure (resting<br>
metabolic rate, i.e., 02 consumption and C02 production) are monitored in air<br>
tight chambers at the end of the study on fed animals. 02 consumption and<br>
C02 production are measured using Oxymax systems (Columbus<br>
Instruments). Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTJ - a routine test for diabetes<br>
and glucose intolerance) is performed on overnight fasted mice at the end of<br>
the study. Blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance are measured using a<br>
glucose monitor (Onetouch sold by Lifescan). Free fatty acids are measured<br>
using an non-esterified free fatty acids enzymatic assay (Waco Chemicals).<br>
Serum insulin levels are measured by immunoassay (Alpco).<br>
Results<br>
[0200]	The effect of the compounds of the present invention on food<br>
intake is determined by measuring grams/mouse/day throughout a 4 week<br>
study. Food is monitored every morning. Cumulative food intake represents<br>
the total amount of grams the mice consume during the study. A significant<br>
reduction in food intake is demonstrated in those mice treated IP with the<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br>
[0201]	The effect of the compounds of the present invention on body<br>
weight is determined by measuring grams/mouse throughout a 4 week study.<br>
Mice are weighed every morning. A significant body weight reduction is<br>
demonstrated in those mice treated IP with the compounds of the present<br>
invention.<br>
[0202]	The effect of the compounds of the present invention on blood<br>
glucose levels is determined by measuring blood glucose levels as<br>
represented as mg of glucose/dL of blood. Mice are fasted overnight and<br>
glucose levels are measured the following morning. Vehicle treated mice<br>
show an increase in blood glucose consistent with the rapid progression of<br>
diabetes in this mouse strain whereas, diabetes is slowed down considerably<br><br>
in drug treated mice. A significant reduction in fasting glucose levels is<br>
demonstrated in those mice treated IP with the compounds of this invention.<br>
[0203]	The effect of the compounds of the present invention on glucose<br>
levels during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is determined by measuring<br>
blood glucose in overnight fasted mice. Blood glucose is represented as mg<br>
of glucose/dL of blood. Glucose levels are measured the following morning.<br>
Orally administered glucose quickly elevates blood glucose, similar to a meal,<br>
and the response to this exogenous glucose gives a measure of how well the<br>
body regulated glucose homeostasis. Vehicle treated mice show an elevated<br>
response to glucose consistent with their diabetic state, whereas drug treated<br>
mice show a very much improved glucose disposal.<br>
[0204]	The effect of the compounds of the present invention on free<br>
fatty acid (FFA) levels is determined by measuring mmoles of FFA/L of serum.<br>
Mice are fasted overnight and free fatty acid levels are measured the following<br>
morning. Vehicle treated mice show elevated levels of FFA throughout the<br>
study consistent with their obese state, whereas the drug treated mice<br>
diabetes show a dramatic decrease.<br>
[0205]	The effect of the compounds of the present invention on serum<br>
insulin levels is determined by measuring serum insulin levels one hour after<br>
single IP dosing of 1 and 3 mg/kg in overnight fasted ob/ob mice. .Serum<br>
insulin levels are represented as ng of insulin/mL of serum. Drug treated mice<br>
. show a dose dependent decrease relative to vehicle.<br>
Determination of tm, Cmax, Fl, Bioavailability, CI, Vss, and<br>
Nocturnal Efficacy<br>
[0206]	In vivo studies were conducted to observe the effect of the<br>
compounds of the invention in the subject animal. Male CD-1 mice, body<br>
weight of 20 grams at arrival, were used in these studies. Mice were given 30<br>
mg/kg of compound in HPMC/Tween solution or suspension via oral gavage.<br><br>
Plasma, brain, and liver samples were collected at time periods of 1, 2, 4, 8,<br>
and 24 hours post dosing. One mouse was used per time point. Thus, a total<br>
of 5 mice were used for each compound tested. For sample collection, mice<br>
were euthanized with C02. Blood samples were taken by cardiac puncture<br>
and kept on ice. Brain and liver samples were collected immediately after<br>
bleeding and the samples were kept on dry ice. For calculation of tissue half-<br>
lives (U12S), the terminal rate constant k was estimated by the absolute value<br>
of the slope of a log-linear regression of the terminal phase of the tissue<br>
concentration-time profile. The tissue half-life ty2 is ln(2)//c.<br>
[0207]	Male C57BL/6J mice of 6-9 weeks age were used in these<br>
studies. The mice were singly housed at least 5 days prior to the study. Two<br>
and a half hours before the onset of the dark cycle, food was removed from<br>
the cage top. Mice were dosed with a compound of the invention (in<br>
HPMC/Tween, as vehicle) or vehicle via oral gavage two hours before the .<br>
onset of the dark cycle. Immediately before the onset of the dark cycle, pre-<br>
weighed food was given to each mouse. Food was weighed at 16 and 24<br>
hours after the introduction of food to obtain cumulative food intake values.<br>
Mice were then euthanized with C02 followed by cervical dislocation.<br>
