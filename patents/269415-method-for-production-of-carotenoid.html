METHOD FOR PRODUCTION OF CAROTENOID<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing carotenoid, and in particular to an industrially suitable method for producing astaxanthin usable as a component of food, pharmaceutical compositions and cosmetic products. Specifically, the present invention relates to a method of treating a microorganism culture with extraction using a lower alcohol at 80°C at the lowest or a combination of water and a lower alcohol at 80°C at the lowest, and is characterized in, after the extraction, washing a precipitate obtained from the extract solution with a combination of a lower alcohol and water. The present invention also relates to a method for producing a composition containing little contaminants derived from organisms and comprising at least 80% of carotenoid containing astaxanthin, the method not using an organic solvent other than a lower alcohol. The present invention further relates to a carotenoid-containing composition obtained by the method; and food, a pharmaceutical composition or a cosmetic product, comprising the carotenoid-containing composition.<br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
Carotenoid is a natural pigment widely existent in the natural world, and is a polyene pigment having a color in the range of yellow to red or purple. Astaxanthin is one type of naturally-occurring carotenoid and exists in a free state or as an ester, or exists as various types of pigment proteins as a result of being bonded with proteins.<br><br>
Astaxanthin is widely used as a coloring agent for fishes and chicken's eggs. Astaxanthin is also permitted to be used as a food additive and is widely used in fat and oil processed foods, protein foods, aqueous liquid foods and the like. Astaxanthin further has an anti-oxidation activity against peroxidation of lipid excited by a free radical, a singlet oxygen erasing action which can be several hundred times stronger<br>
 than that of a-tocopherol or the hke, and therefore is expected to be used in functional foods, cosmetic products, or medicines by utilizing the strong anti-oxidation activity thereof.<br><br>
Astaxanthin is distributed widely in the natural world in, for example, fishes such as salmon, trout and red sea bream, etc.; and crustaceans such as crab, shrimp, krill, etc. Astaxanthin is also produced by bacteria belonging to Agrobacterium, Brevibacterium and Paracoccus; and microorganisms including Haematococcus, Phaffia yeast and the like. Carotenoid such as astaxanthin, zeaxanthin or the like is industrially produced by a chemical synthesis method, but naturally-derived carotenoid is desired from the aspect of safety.<br><br>
[0003]<br>
With such a background, many methods for producing carotenoids containing astaxanthin especially derived from algae or microorganisms which are considered to be suitable to mass production have been reported<br><br>
For example, the following method for producing carotenoid from a Haematococcus alga has been reported (patent document I). A cyst cell of a post-culture alga is treated with heated acetone to elute chlorophyll, which is a contaminant, then, the cyst cell is spray-dried, and carotenoid is extracted from the resultant dry cells with ethanol. However, a composition obtained by such a method still contains many contaminants derived from organisms, and is not satisfactory in terms of 1) the carotenoid content, 2) the astaxanthin content, and the like.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
In order to obtain a composition containing astaxanthin at a high content, the following method, for example, has been reported (patent document 2). A crude xanthophyll obtained in conformity with the above-described method is acted on by lipase in the presence of water to decompose a neutral lipid, which is one contaminant. The lipase enzyme-treated liquid is decomposed into oil and water. From the separated oil layer, free fatty acid is separated from astaxanthin by distillation, and the astaxanthin is concentrated and purified. However, even after such complicated treating steps, a composition containing astaxanthin at a ratio exceeding 30% has not been obtained.<br><br>
[0005]<br>
A method of obtaining astaxanthin contained at a ratio of 0.5 to 60% using a supercritical fluid extraction method (patent document 3) has been reported. However, an astaxanthin fraction of a content less than the targeted content is produced as a sub-product while carrying out this method. In order to discard, or increase the astaxanthin content of, such a fraction, another concentration operation is required. Therefore, this production method is not satisfactory, in terms of the simplicity and cost, as an industrial method for producing highly pure carotenoid containing a high content of astaxanthin with little contaminants derived from organisms.<br><br>
[0006]<br>
As a method using Phaffia yeast, the following method has been reported (patent document 4). A crushed bacterial cell of the yeast is treated with extraction using an organic solvent, and the oil-like crude extraction obtained by concentrating the extract solution is purified by ion exchange chromatography, adsorption chromatography or the like to obtain astaxanthin. However, this method is performed by purifying the crude solution of low concentration astaxanthin through a plurality types of column chromatography, and so it is difficult to carry out this method in an industrial manner.<br><br>
[0007]<br>
As another method, the following method has also been reported (patent document 5). A bacterial cell after the culturing of Phaffia yeast is treated with extraction using acetone, and the resultant extract solution is concentrated to obtain a crude extract. A hydrocarbon-based solvent is added to this crude extract to obtain crystals. This method is highly simple, but the obtained composition contains carotenoid at a content of merely about 70 to 73% (the content of astaxanthin is merely 36 to 42%).   Due to such a low content, this method is not satisfactory as a method for producing highly pure carotenoid with little contaminants derived from organisms. This method is not satisfactory also for the reason that there is a concern that acetone and the hydrocarbon-based solvent may remain in carotenoid.<br><br>
As methods using E-396 strain (PERM BP-4283: deposited on April 27, 1993 (date of original deposition), International Patent Organism Depositary, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (Central 6, Higashi 1-1-1, Tsukuba-shi, Ibaraki-ken, Japan)), which is a bacterial for producing astaxanthin, adonixanthin and the like, the following methods have been reported: a method of extracting by contacting the bacterial cell to a cyclic hydrophilic organic compound, which invokes a safety concern regarding the use in food production (patent document 6); a method of using supercritical fluid extraction like patent document 3 (patent document 7); and a method of contacting E-396 strain to a water-soluble organic solvent, a non-polar solvent and water to perform liquid-liquid extraction (patent document 8).<br><br>
Under these circumstances, a simpler, lower-cost method which does not require any special facilities is strongly desired to be established.<br><br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0008]<br>
The present invention has an object of providing a composition comprising<br><br>

MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0009]<br>
In order to solve the above-described problems, the present inventors conducted a research mainly on microorganism cultures and newly found the following. According to a method for industrially producing highly pure carotenoid, containing a high content of astaxanthin, with a solvent safe for food production in a simple manner without requiring special facilities or complicated operations, a microorganism culture is treated with extraction using a lower alcohol at a temperature which is equal to or lower than the boiling point of the solvent. This method requires a large amount of solvent in order to extract carotenoid from the bacterial cell, which causes a problem that a process construction cannot be done at low cost. As a result of further accumulating active studies to solve the problems including this one, the present inventors found that a highly pure carotenoid composition is obtained with a very small amount of solvent by treating a microorganism culture with extraction using a lower alcohol at 80°C at the lowest or a combination of water and a lower alcohol at 80°C at the lowest and then washing the precipitate, obtained by optionally concentrating the extract solution, with a combination of a lower alcohol and water.

The mutation may be performed in one stage, or two or more stages. In the latter case, for example, a mutant of an astaxanthin-producing microorganism is obtained by the above mutation process, and then the obtained mutant is further subjected to another mutation process.<br><br>
[0012]<br>
A microorganism culture, etc. usable for the present invention may be any culture, without specific limitation, which is obtained by a method capable of culturing the above-described microorganism efficiently, for example, by a method of using liquid culture, solid culture or a combination thereof using any of the following mediums.<br><br>
A nutrition medium usable for culturing a microorganism used for the present invention may be any nutrition medium containing a carbon source, a nitrogen source and an inorganic salt necessary for growing a production bacterium. It may be more preferable to add a vitamin. It may be preferable to further add amino acid, nucleic acid base or the like. Other substances which may be optionally added include yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, dry yeast, soybean cake and the like.<br><br>
Usable carbon sources include sugars such as glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, trehalose, mannose, mannitol, mahose and the like; organic acids such as acetic acid, flimaric acid, citric acid, propionic acid, malic acid, malonic acid, pyruvic acid and the like; alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, isobutanol, glycerol and the like; fats and oils such as soybean oil, rice bran oil, olive oil, corn oil, sesame oil, linseed oil and the like; etc. These carbon sources may be used independently or in a combination of two or more. The ratio thereof depends on the type of the carbon source and may be appropriately adjusted, but usually is 1 to 100 g, preferably 2 to 50 g, per 1 L of the medium.<br><br>
Usable nitrogen sources include, for example, potassium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, ammonia, urea and the like. These nitrogen sources may be used independently or in a combination of two or more. The ratio thereof depends on the type of the nitrogen source and may be appropriately adjusted, but usually is 0.1 to 30 g, preferably 1 to 10 g, per 1 L of the medium.<br><br>
Usable inorganic salts include potassium dihydrogen phosphate, dipotassium<br>
 hydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium chloride, iron sulfate, iron chloride, manganese sulfate, manganese chloride, zinc sulfate, lead chloride, copper sulfate, calcium chloride, calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, and the like. These inorganic salts may be used independently or in a combination of two or more. The  ratio thereof depends on the type of the inorganic salt and may be appropriately adjusted, but usually is 0.001 to 10 g, per 1 L of the medium.<br><br>
When a vitamin is added, the amount thereof depends on the type of the vitamin and may be appropriately adjusted, but usually is 0.l to 1000 mg, preferably 1 to 100 mg, per I L of the medium.<br><br>
The amount of each of amino acid, nucleic acid base, yeast extract, peptone, meat extract, malt extract, corn steep liquor, dry yeast, soybean cake and the like depends on the type of the substance and may be appropriately adjusted, but usually is 0.2 g to 200 g, preferably 3 to 100 g, per 1 L of the medium.<br><br>
The pH of the medium is adjusted to 2 to 12, preferably 6 to 9. The culturing is performed at a temperature of 15 to 80°C, preferably 20 to 35°C, for 1 to 20 days, preferably 2 to 8 days, under an aerobic condition. The aerobic condition is, for example, shaking culture, aeration and stirring culture, or the like.<br><br>
[0013]<br>
According to a preferable method for extracting astaxanthin produced by a cultured microorganism used for the present invention, the culture solution, or a bacterial cell concentrated solution, a wet bacterial cell or a dry bacterial cell obtained from the culture solution is treated with extraction as follows after the culturing. The bacterial cell concentrated solution can be obtained by treating the culture solution with, for example, concentration by membrane filtration. The wet bacterial cell can be obtained by treating the culture solution with centrifugation, pressurization, filtration at reduced pressure, or any other generally known filtration method. The dry bacterial cell can be obtained by drying the wet bacterial cell using atomization drying, fluidized drying, rotating drum drying, lyophilization or any other generally known drying<br>
 method. It is also recommended that before performing the following extraction, the culture solution, the bacterial cell concentrated solution, the wet bacterial cell or the dry bacterial cell is treated with one, or at least two, of a chemical treatment using an alkaline reagent, a surfactant or the like; a biochemical treatment using a bacteriolytic enzyme, a lipid decomposing enzyme, a proteolytic enzyme or the like; and a physical treatment using ultrasonic waves, pulverization or the like. The dry bacterial cell is usually considered to contain astaxanthin at a ratio of about 20 mg/g.<br><br>
[0014]<br>
Examples of the solvent usable for extraction and washing in the present invention include lower alcohols, for example, lower alcohols having a carbon number of I to 6, preferably 1 to 3. Specifically, ethanol, methanol, lsopropanol and the like are preferable; and ethanol is especially preferable. A mixture of two or more of these lower alcohols may be used. The temperature of a lower alcohol at the time of extraction is 80°C at the lowest, preferably 80°C or higher, more preferably 85°C or higher, still more preferably 90°C or higher, and especially preferably 93°C higher.<br><br>
Herein, the expression "at the lowest" refers to the lowest temperature at which the lower alcohol should be kept at the time of extraction.<br><br>
The temperature at the time of extraction is related with an increase of the solubility of astaxanthin-containing carotenoid in ethanol, and so is an important factor for increasing the extraction efficiency. The upper limit on the temperature of the lower alcohol at the time of extraction is preferably 150°C or lower, more preferably 130°C or lower, still more preferably 120°C or lower, especially preferably 110°C or lower, and most preferably 100°C or lower. The upper limit on the temperature is important to suppress the thermal decomposition of carotenoid containing astaxanthin. Accordingly, the range of the temperature of the lower alcohol used in the present invention at the time of extraction is, for example, 80°C to 150°C, preferably 85°C to 120°C, more preferably 90°C to 110°C, and especially preferably around 95°C.<br><br>
For the above, a temperature of the boiling point or higher, or around the<br>
boiling point, of the solvent is necessary. Therefore, the treatment needs to be performed in a sealed pressure vessel. The gauge pressure at this point is 0.8 MPa at the maximum, preferably 0.4 MPa or lower, and more preferably 0,2 MPa or lower.<br><br>
The amount of the lower alcohol, which is defined by the temperature at the time of extraction, may be any amount with which the amount of astaxanthin contained in the bacterial cell can be dissolved. In the case of extraction from a dry bacterial cell with a lower alcohol, the amount is 300 to 3,000 g, preferably 500 to 2,000 g, and more preferably 800 to 1,600 g, per 1 g of astaxanthin contained in the bacterial cell.<br><br>
For example, when extraction is performed with ethanol at 95°C from 1 g of dry bacterial cell containing about 20 mg of astaxanthin, the amount of ethanol may be about 5 g to 100 g, preferably 8 g to 60 g, and more preferably about 10 g to 35 g.<br><br>
During the extraction, the pigment in the bacterial cell is made easier to be extracted by adding water Therefore, water may be added to the lower alcohol for extraction. In the case where water is added to the lower alcohol, the ratio of the water is about 1/400 to 1/5, preferably about 1/300 to 1/10, and more preferably 1/200 to 1/15, of the volume of the lower alcohol.<br><br>
By adding water before adding the lower alcohol, the surface of the dry bacteria cell is wetted and thus the lower alcohol added later is made easier to be incorporated into the bacterial cell. This raises the extraction efficiency of carotenoid by about 5 to 10%. Therefore, when water is added, it is desirable to add water before the lower alcohol is added to the bacterial cell. In addition, a mixture of the lower alcohol and water may be used for the extraction. There is no specific limitation on the mixing ratio, but is 1:10 to 1:100, preferably 1:20 to 1:40.<br><br>
When a dry material is used, it is desirable to add water. However, in the case where the pigment is extracted from a sample having a high water content, such as a viable cell, a live sample or the like, the concentration of the lower alcohol is decreased by adding water, and the extraction efficiency is lowered.    For this reason, it is<br>
 necessary to check the water content of the material from which extraction is to be performed and determine whether or not to add water.<br><br>
[0015]<br>
When it is desired to suppress oxidation of carotenoid during the extraction operation to a minimum possible level, the extraction may be performed under an atmosphere of an inert gas such as nitrogen gas, or an antioxidant used for medicines or foods may be appropriately selected and added to the extraction solvent. These treatments may be combined.<br><br>
It is desirable that the antioxidant is removed from the carotenoid composition in the end, but removal may not be necessary depending on the type of the antioxidant used (for example, when vitamin C is used).<br><br>
In order to suppress the decomposition of carotenoid caused by light to a minimum possible level, the extraction may be performed under conditions with no light radiation.<br>
There is no specific limitation on the extraction time. For suppressing the reduction of the yield caused by thermal decomposition, it is preferable to complete the treatment within a short time. The extraction time is preferably within 120 minutes, more preferably within 60 minutes, and most preferably within 30 minutes.<br><br>
[0016]<br>
Any method is usable to separate the extract solution from the microorganism after the extraction operation. Membrane filtration, centrifligation, decantation and the like are usable. For an industrial use, centrifugation is preferable. For an industrial use, there is no specific limitation on the temperature for separation. The carotenoid pigment which is extracted at high temperature of 80°C or higher and dissolved in a lower alcohol is in a supercooled state, and so is not easily deposited within a short time even when being cooled to -20°C to 70°C. Therefore, the extract solution can be separated stably even at low temperature.<br><br>
[0017]<br>
In general, methods for obtaining a precipitate from an extract solution obtained by treating a microorganism culture with extraction using a lower alcohol include heating and/or concentration at reduced pressure and precipitation. Alternatively, the carotenoid pigment may be separated, without being concentrated, by deposition of the carotenoid pigment at low temperature or deposition using an acid or alkaline agent or any of various salts. In this operation, the carotenoid pigment is recovered from the supercooled state when being left at room temperature for 1 hour or longer and thus can be deposited. The recovery from the supercooled state can be expedited by stirring or vibrating the carotenoid pigment. However, the supercooled state is varied in accordance with the extraction temperature, and so a condition for recovery from the supercooled state, which is suitable to the extraction temperature, needs to be selected.<br><br>
By performing the operations described above, free trans  carotenoid can be obtained. When being recovered from the supercooled state by the above-described operation, the free trans  astaxanthin is not highly soluble in ethanol at room temperature. Even where ethanol is added, the  trans  astaxanthin is not dissolved and is suspended.<br><br>
As to concentrating the carotenoid pigment, the degree of concentration may be appropriately determined in consideration of the amount and the purity of the precipitate to be obtained. For example, the extract solution may be concentrated 10- to 1000-fold, preferably 30- to 500-fold, more preferably 50- to 400-fold, and especially preferably 100- to 200-fold, with respect to the weight thereof Most preferably, the solvent in the extract solution is completely removed by distillation and the carotenoid pigment is dried.<br><br>
The solution removed by concentrating the extract solution may be reused for extraction from a cultured microorganism with no further treatment.<br><br>
For an industrial use, precipitation is desirable.    This can be realized by, for<br>
 example, cooling the solution, adding a new solvent which decreases the solubility of the solute, or changing the pH.<br><br>
[0018]<br>
A dried precipitate, a concentrated precipitate, or a deposited precipitate is optionally suspended and stirred using a small amount of lower alcohol for washing. Regarding an amount of the lower alcohol used for suspending the precipitate recovered from the supercooled state, it is desirable to select an industrially durable amount in consideration of the purity of the precipitate, For example, the amount may be as small as about twice, but may be greater than that, preferably 4 times or greater, more preferably 8 times or greater, still more preferably 16 times or greater, and even 32 times or greater when necessary, per I g of the dried precipitate. When a concentrated precipitate is used, a weight in the dry state should be used, which is calculated using a conversion coefficient that can be set by checking, before drying, the correlation between the volume or weight of the undried precipitate and that of the dried precipitate.<br><br>
In order to raise the purity of the precipitate, the precipitate may be put into smaller pieces by use of physical treatment such as ultrasonic waves or pulverization, before being suspended in a lower alcohol. Detailed conditions for this operation may be appropriately determined in accordance with the purity of the obtained precipitate.<br><br>
[0019]<br>
There is no specific limitation on the washing method. Practically preferable methods include, for example, a method of performing filtration after the precipitate is suspended and stirred, a method of passing the solution from above the precipitate, and the like. The temperature at the time of washing is preferably in the range of TC to 30°C in general, but may be lower than TC or higher than 30°C depending on the situation. The upper limit on the temperature may be around the boiling point of the lower alcohol, at which the solubility in the lower alcohol is increased, and is preferably the boiling point or lower.<br><br>
When the precipitate is washed with a lower alcohol, free trans astaxanthin is not highly soluble, but free cis astaxanthin which becomes cis because of the high temperature is highly soluble in ethanol. Therefore, as a result of filtration and washing, only the free trans astaxanthin is left as a solid and can be distinguished from the cis astaxanthin. As used herein, term "free astaxanthin" refers to astaxanthin which is not ester-linked with fatty acid and is in a state where two hydroxyl groups are bonded to a basic structure.<br><br>
[0020]<br>
It is possible to recover the used lower alcohol from the waste fluid which is generated during the washing performed to obtain highly pure carotenoid from the precipitate, using a method of distillation or of removal by distillation at reduced pressure, so that the recovered lower alcohol can be reused for another washing step as a solvent.<br><br>
[0021]<br>
In order to reduce the amount of the solvent remaining in the carotenoid-containing composition according to the present invention after the washing and drying, a step of washing with water to be substituted for the solvent may be added at the end of the washing.<br><br>
This operation of washing with water can remove the water-soluble fraction, and so the purity of carotenoid can be improved by about 2 to 10%.<br><br>
[0022]<br>
In order to maximize the contents of carotenoid and the main components such as astaxanthin and the like in the carotenoid-containing composition obtained by the above-described method, the conditions of the above-described purifrcation steps may be appropriately adjusted. The content of carotenoid in the carotenoid-containing composition according to the present invention is defined by the amount of astaxanthin in the carotenoid in the bacterial cell. The content of carotenoid in the carotenoid-containing composition obtained according to the present invention is at<br>
 least 80%, for example, 80% or greater, preferably 85% or greater, more preferably 88% or greater, and most preferably 90% or greater The content of astaxanthin in the carotenoid is at least 40%, for example, 40% or greater, preferably 43% or greater, more preferably 44% or greater, and most preferably 48% or greater.<br><br>
As used herein, the expression "at least" refers to the lowest content at which carotenoid should be contained in the composition. The same is applied to astaxanthin .<br>
Where E-396 strain or a mutant thereof is used as the bacterial cell, a carotenoid-containing composition containing astaxanthin at 40% or greater with respect to the entire carotenoid in the composition can be obtained.<br><br>
[0023]<br>
As described above, the method according to the present invention is characterized in treating a microorganism culture with extraction using a lower alcohol at 80°C at the lowest or a combination of water and a lower alcohol at 80°C at the lowest and then washing, with a combination of a lower alcohol and water, the precipitate which is obtained by, for example, concentrating, drying and solidifying the extract solution. Carotenoid can be obtained at a high level of purity merely by these very simple operations. By performing extraction at high temperature, the amount of the solvent to be used can be significantly decreased.<br><br>
The method according to the present invention is significantly industrially advantageous over the conventional art on the points of 1) not requiring a complicated operation; 2) not requiring an inefficient purification operation such as increasing the purity of a low concentration solution; and 3) not using a large amount of solvent for extraction. The present invention has a meritorious effect of realizing a superior industrial production method on the points of 4) providing a highly pure carotenoid composition containing astaxanthin at a high content, at low cost and 5) allowing the solvent used in each step to be easily recovered and reused.<br><br>

EXAMPLES<br>
[0030]<br>
The present invention will be described based on examples, reference examples, formulation examples and test examples. The scope of the present invention is not limited to the following examples.<br><br>
In the examples and comparative examples, astaxanthin and carotenoid were quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).    Two columns of<br>
 Wakosil-II SIL-100 ((1)4.6 - 250 mm) (produced by Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) were connected to each other to be used as a column. Elution was performed by flowing an n-hexane-tetrahydrofuran-methanol mixed solution (40:20:1), which was a mobile phase, at a flow rate of l.0ml/min, at a constant temperature around room temperature. The measurement was performed as follows. The sample was dissolved in tetrahydrofuran, and the resultant substance was diluted 100-fold with the mobile phase. 20 µL of the resultant solution was injected. The column elution solution was detected at a wavelength of 470 nm. As the reference product for quantification, astaxanthin produced by Sigma (Cat. No. A9335) was used. The astaxanthin concentration of the reference solution was set using the following expression after measuring the absorbance of the reference solution of 477 nm (A) and the area percentage % (B) of the astaxanthin peak at the time of HPLC analysis under the above-described conditions.<br><br>
Astaxanthin concentration (mg/L) = A÷2150xBxl00<br><br>
