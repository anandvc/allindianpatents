INDUSTRIAL SULFAT10N Daniel Sicdman Connor Thomas Anthony Cripe R. Craig Jacobs Mike C. Jansen FIF.T.D OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods for producing longer chain length • alkyl sulfatc and/or alkyl alkoxylated sulfate surfactant compositions. This method utilizes the presence of a significant amount of mid-chain branched alcohol and/or mid-chain branched polyoxyalkylcne alcohol in the sulfation reaction to significantly reduce the reaction temperature, thereby improving product quality and" saving energy,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Sulfpnution/sulfatkm of nnionie surfactants worldwide is done on a very large scale, on the order of millions of tons each year. Such processes are well defined and are thoroughly characterized in the art. [Sec for example, Everett E. Gilbert, "Sulfation aiul Related Reactions", copyright 1965 by John Willcy and Son, Inc., pages 345-354; and "Sulfonation Technology in the Detergent Industry", by W. Herman dc Ciroot, copyright 1991 by Kluwer Academic Publishers, especially pages 213-215.]<br>
The art recognizes that for lower chain length alcohols, such as lauryl alcohol, the feed temperature for the reaction can be kept low, in the 25-3Q°C range. However, longer chain length alcohols, like the C]6-18 tallow alcohol, require feed temperatures in the 55-60° jnnpc. At such higher temperatures, in addition to the added energy needed to run in the process, there is a need to carefully control the reaction conditions, (e.g., to control the flow rates and reactor temperature dissipation) to avoid producing products with poor physical chnrncteristics, such ns off-odor and/or color. [See for example, pages 213-214 of "Sulfonation Technology in the Detergent Industry", ibid]<br>
More specifically, side reactions that may occur, at least In part owing to conventional temperatures and the vigor of the sulfating agent include: dehydration of alkyl sulfatc to form olefin; elimination of water between two molecules to form<br>
an ether; oxidation to the aldehyde followed by further oxidation to the acid; and esterification of the acid with fatly alcohol [see: David D. Whyte, J.A.O.C.S., Vol. 32, pp313-316, (1955)].<br>
Thus, milder conditions for such longer chain alcohols is highly sought after<br>
in the industry. It has been discovered by the present invention that inclusion of at least 10% of a mid-chain branched, longer chain alcohol mixture into the longer chain length (at least about C]^ 5 average) alcohol mixture to be sulfatcd permits avoidance of high peak instantaneous reaction temperatures of the sulfation reaction, sufficiently <o greatly improves the physical characteristics of longer chain alcohol sulfate thereby produced. similar benefits can also be obtained for production alkyl alkoxylated surfactant compositions.></o>
Objects of the present invention therefore include one or more of the following: better economy by virtue of lower energy input in preparing tlv? alcohol for the sulfation process and the ability to avoid having to melt out and control the feed alcohol temperature; faster reaction times; the ability to provide a more mass-effective product, by avoiding the need to include diluents and viscosity reducers; better color compared with high-temperature processing, such as required for tallow alcohols, and thereby avoiding the need for a subsequent bleaching operation; lower viscosity of the "acid mix" (the term used to describe the product of sulfation prior to being neutralized), which in turn impiovcs the case and quality of the neutralization step; lower viscosity of the finished surfactant paste at identical temperature compared to the process required for the tallow alcohol analog, which thereby permits the manufacture of more concentrated paste for use in so called "compact" or "ultra" determent products, the ability to reduce or eliminate alcohol or similar1 materials which are frequently used to thin the final paste; the ability to manufacture new alkyl sulfate products which are completely linear alkyl benzene sulfonatc- free (typical current practice is to co-react tallow alcohol nnd linear alky) benzene to make a mixed tallow alcohol sulfate and linear alkyl benzene sulfonatc product); (lie ability to more easily pump and handle all materials in the sulfation process from starting material to final product; the ability to avoid or eliminate hot storage steps, and the associated costs and potential discoloration of product that may thereby be produced; the ability to use relatively low-cost sulfonation plants which under normal circumstances would be intoleranl of, or could not handle, neat C16-18 alcohols; and the ability to limit side-reactions during sulfation, thereby giving a cleaner product. These and other objects of the present invention will he apparent from the detailed description hereinafter.<br>

PETAILEP DESCRIPTION OF THEJNVBNT10N The present invention sulfation process may start with alcohols arid/or polyoxyalkylenc alcohols essentially comprising at least about 10% (preferably at least about 25%, more preferably at least about 50%, still more preferably at least about 75%, and most preferably at least about 95%) by weight of the following mid-chain branched materials, (a) .Mid-chain branchedhiliphntic alcohols:<br>
Mid-chain branched aliphatic alcohols useful in the present invention .';iilf;ition process hnve the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The alcohol mixtures useful in the present invention comprise molecules having a linear primary alkyl chain backbone (i.e., the longest linear carbon chain which includes the hydroxylated carbon atom). These alkyl chain backbones comprise from 12 to 19 carbon atoms; and further the molecules comprise a branched primary alkyl moiety having at least a total of 14, but not more than 20, carbon atoms. In addition, the alcohol mixture has an average total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alkyl moieties within the range of from greater than M.5 to about 17.5. Thus, the present invention mixtures comprise at least one branched primary alkyl alcohol compound having a longest linear carbon chain of not less than 12 carbon moms or more than J9 carbon atoms, and the total<br>
k<br>
number of carbon atoms including branching must be al least 14, and further the avciagc total number of carbon atoms for the branched primary alky] chains is williin the ninye of j'.ieatrr than H.5 (o about 17.5.<br>
For example, a C16 total carbon primary alkyl alcohol having 13 carbon<br>
atoms in the backbone must have ) , 2, or 3 branching units (i.e., R, R1 and/or R3) whereby total number of carbon atom?; in the molecule is ot least 16. In this example, the C16 total carbon requirement may be satisfied equally by having, for example, one propyl branching unit or three methyl branching units.<br>
R, R1, and R^ arc each independently selected from hydrogen and C)-C3 alkyl (preferably hydrogen or Cj-C2 alkyl, more preferably hydrogen or methyl, and most preferably methyl), provided R, R' , and R^ are not all hydrogen. Further, when * is 1 , at least R or R' is not hydiogen,<br>
Although for the purposes of the present invention alcohol compositions having the above formula do not include molecules wherein the units R, R1 , and R^ are all hydrogen (i.e., linear non-branched primary alkyl sulfates), it is to be recognized that the present invention compositions may still further comprise some amount of linear, non-brtmched primary alkyl nlcohol. Further, this linear non-branched primary alkyl alcohol surfactant may be present as the result of the process used to manufacture the alcohol mixture having the requisite one or more mid-chain branched primary alkyl sulfates according to the present invention, or for purposes of formulating detergent compositions some amount of linear non-branched primary alkyl alcohol may be admixed into the alcohol mixture.<br>
Further regarding the above formula, vv is an integer from 0 to 13; x is an integer from 0 to 13; y is an integer from 0 to 13; z is an integer of at hast 1 ; and w I x •! y i '/. is an integer from 8 to I A.<br>
Certain points of branching (i.e., the location along the chain of the R, Rl, and/or R^ moieties it) the above foimulu) arc preferred over other points of branching along the backbone of the alcohol. The formula below illustrates the mid-chain branching range (i.e., where points of branching occur), preferred mid-chain branching range, and more preferred mid-chain branching range for mono-methyl substituted linear alkyl alcohols (the same applies to the polyoxyalkylenc alcohols described in detail herein after) of the present invention.<br>

alcohol mixtures comprising two or more of R, R1, or R^, alkyl branching at the 2-carbon atom is within the scope of the present invention. Alcohols having chains longer than ethyl (i.e. €3 alky) substitutents) on the 2-carbon atom, however, are less preferred,<br>

Preparation of JV( id-chain Branched Alcohols and Poivoxvalkvlcnc Alcohols<br>
The following reaction scheme outlines a general approach to the preparation<br>
of the mid-chain branched primary alcohols useful for the present invention process,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
An alkyl halidc is converted to a Grignard reagent and the Grignard is reacted with a haloketone. After conventional acid hydrolysis, acetylation and thermal elimination of acetic acid, an intermediate olefin is produced (not shown in the scheme) which is hydrogenatcd forthwith using any convenient hydrogenation catalyst such as Pd/C.<br>
This route is favorable over others in that the branch, in this illustration a 5-mcthyl branch, is introduced early in the reaction sequence.<br>
Fonnylalion of the alkyl halidc resulting from Ihc first hydrogenation step yields alcohol product, as shown in the scheme. This may be alkoxylatud using standard tcclmiqucs to yield a mid-chain branched primary alkyl polyoxyalkylene alcohol. There is flexibility to extend the branching one additional carbon beyond thai which is achieved by a single fonnylation. Such extension can, for example, be accomplished by reaction with ethylene oxide. See "Grignard Reactions of Nonmctallic Substances", M.S. Kharasch and O. Reinmulh, Prentice-Hall, N.Y., 1954; J. Org. Chem., J. Cason and W. R. Winans, Vol. 15 (1950), pp 139-147; J. Org Chem., J. Cason et al, Vol. 13 (1948), pp 239-248;,/. Org Chem., J. Cason et al., Vol. 14 (1949), pp 147-154; and J. Org Chem., J. Cason ct al., Vol. 15 (1950), pp 135- 138 all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In variations of the above procedure, alternate haloketoncs or Grignard reagents may be used. PHr3 halogenation of the alcohol from formylation or cthoxylation can be used to accomplish an iterative chain extension.<br>
The preferred mid-chained branched primary alkyl alcohols and therefrom the preferred polyoxyalkylene alcohols useful in the present invention can also be readily prepared as follows:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
A conventional bromoalcohol is reacted with triphenylphosphine followed by sodium hydride, suitably in dimcthylsulibxide/tetrahydrofuran, to form a Wittig adduct. The Wittig adduct is reacted with an alpha methyl ketone, forming an internally unsaturatcd methyl-branched alcoholate. Hydrogcnation, optionally followed by alkoxylation, yields tlie desired mid-chain branched primary alkyl alcohols. Although the Wittig approach does nol allow the practitioner to extend the hydrocarbon chain, ns in the Grignard sequence, the Wiltig typically affords higher yields. Sec Agricultural and Biological Chemistiy, M. Horiike et al., vol. 42 (1978), pp 1963-1965 included herein by reference.<br>
Any alternative synthetic procedure in accordance with the invention may be used to prepare the branched primary alkyl alcohols. Tlie mid-chain branched primary nlky! alcohols may, in addition be synthcsi/.cd or formulated in the presence of the conventional homologs, for example any of those which may be formed in an industrial process which produces 2-alkyl branching as a result of hydroformylation.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the alcohol mixtures of the present invention, especially those derived from fossil fuel sources involving commercial processes, comprise at least 1 mid-chain branched primary alkyl alcohol, preferably at least 2, more preferably at least 5, most preferably at least 8.<br>
Particularly suitable for preparation of certain alcohol mixtures for the present invention are "oxo" reaction?; wherein a branched chain olefin is subjected to catalytic isomerization and hydroformylation. The preferred processes resulting in such mixtures utilize fossil fuels as the starting material feedstock. PiefeMod processes utilize Oxo reaction on linear olcfins (alpha or internal) with a limited amount of branching. Suitable olefins may be made by dimerization of linear alpha or internal olcfins, by controlled oligomcrization of low molecular weight linear olefins, by skeletal rearrangement of detergent range olefins, by dchydrogenalion/skeletal rearrangement of detergent range paraffins, or by Fischer-Tropsch reaction. These reactions will in general be controlled to:<br>
1)	give a large proportion of olefins in the desired detergent range (while allowing<br>
for the addition of a carbon atom in the subsequent Oxo reaction),<br>
2)	produce a limited number of branches, preferably mid-chain,<br>
3)	produce Cj-C^ branches, more preferably ethyl, most preferably methyl.<br>
The process described herein above gives the more preferred 5-melhyl-hexadccyl alcohols in higher yield than the le.ss preferred 2/l-dimcthylpcntadecyJ alcohols. This mixture is desirable under the metes and bounds of the present invention in that each product comprises at total of 17 carbon atoms witii linear alkyl chains having at least 13 carbon atoms.<br>

The alcohol of F.xnmple 111 (90 parts) is mixed with n-hcxadecanol (10 pails). The starting alcohol mixture has a total carbonyl impurity level of no more than about 5ppm, by wcight.The mixture is sulfated in a falling film reactor using the following conditions: mole ratios: conventional, i.e., slight excess of S03 over fatty alcohol; typical 803 concentrations: 4-5% , v/v in air, though no-aif processes can also be used; typical fatty alcohol feed temperature: 10-25 deg. C (compare 55-60 which would be essential for tallow); cooling jacket water: 20-30 deg. C (compare 45 and above which would be needed for tallow alcohol, stearyl alcohol and the like); neutralisation: 25-35 deg. C (compare 40-45 deg C for tallow alcohol); acid feed to ncutralizer: 35-45 deg. C (compare tallow alcohol at 55 deg C). Final paste concentrations above 30% by weight are possible (compare tallow which typically sets up solid almost independently of paste concentration when there is no LAB orethanol used).<br>
The following two analytical methods for characterizing branching in the present invention surfactant compositions are useful:<br>
1)	Separation and Identification of Components in Fatty Alcohols prior to<br>
alkoxylation. The position and length of branching found in the precursor fatty<br>
alcohol materials is determined by GC/MS techniques [see: D. J. Harvey, Biomed,<br>
linviron. Mass Spectrom (1989). 18(9), 719-23; D. J. Harvey, J. M. Tiffany, J.<br>
Chromatogr. (1984), 301(1), 173-87; K. A. Karlsson, B. E. Samuelsson, G. O.<br>
Stccn, Chcin. Phys. Lipids (1973), 11 (1), 17-38].<br>
2)	Identification of Separated Fatty Alcohol Components prior to<br>
alkoxylation by MS/MS techniques. The position and length of branching is also<br>
dctcrminable by Ion Spray-MS/MS or FAB-MS/MS techniques on previously<br>
isolated fatty alcohol components.<br>
Having identified isolated alcohol components, alkoxylation of the isolated alcohols yields sUuulaids useful for calibrating and interpreting GC cliromatograms of mid-chain branched primary alkyl polyoxyalkylene surfactants.<br>
The uvcinge tolal carbon atoms of the bianchcd primary alkyl polyoxyalkylenes herein can be calculated from the hydroxyl value of the precursor fatty alcohol mix according to common procedures, such as outlined in "Bailey's Industrial Oil and Fat Products", Volume 2, Fourth Ikiition, edited by Daniel Swcrn,<br><br><br><br><br>
