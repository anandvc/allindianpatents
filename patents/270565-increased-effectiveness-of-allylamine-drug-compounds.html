A PCT PATENT APPLICATION<br>
BY<br>
PICHIT SUVANPRAKORN, PANIDA VAYUMHASUWAN AND NARDO ZAIAS<br>
CROSS REFERENCE<br>
This application claims the benefit of US Provisional Patent Application Number 60/899,433 filed on February 5,2007.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The invention is an increased effectiveness of allylamine drug compounds for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. One embodiment of the invention is the use of terbinafine as the active ingredient for treating various diseases, such as onychomycosis. For the first time the penetration of the nail bed comeocytes, either through or around the nail plate, is achieved by topical application of the present invention.<br>
The increased effectiveness for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages uses an allylamine as the active ingredient. One novel feature of the invention is that the positively charged allylamine drug compounds and penetrating enhancers used in the invention make it effective for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. The active ingredient is prepared in an acidic environment; the acidic environment altering the physiochemical properties of the active ingredient resulting in the active ingredient having a positive charge. It is this positive charge and the enhancers used in the formula that allow for increased effectiveness for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. The positively charged active ingredients are either dissolved in a delivery vehicle directly or dissolved in a plurality of beads suspended in the vehicle.   The preferred delivery vehicle is<br>
transparent, but alternative delivery vehicles with various degrees of transparency may be used. The bead structure minimizes the molecular diffusion of the positively charged active ingredient and a catalytic species through the bead structure, thus stabilizes the positively charged active ingredient inside the bead by impeding the interaction of the positively charged active ingredient and the catalytic species, and thereby extending the shelf life of the positively charged active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A major goal of the pharmaceutical and cosmcceutical industry is the development of effective products. Topical products are of interest since they are not invasive, they can be applied directly to the target area, and thus have fewer side effects. The development of effective topical products needs a multidisciplinary approach since the active ingredients must have optimum solubility, adequate stability and optimum concentration at the target area. The skin and skin appendages have different structures and compositions, so what is needed is an invention that can overcome their hard to penetrate barriers.<br>
Therefore, it is an objective of the present invention to make products that are effective for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
The invention is an increased effectiveness of allylamine drug compounds for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. Various allylamines can be used as the active ingredient. A novel feature of the invention is that the positively charged allylamine drug compounds and penetrating enhancers used in the invention make it effective for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. The active ingredient is prepared in an acidic environment; the acidic environment altering the physiochemical properties of the active ingredient resulting in the active ingredient having a positive charge. It is this positive charge and the enhancers used in the formula that allow for increased effectiveness of allylamine drug compounds for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. The positively charged active ingredients are dissolved in a delivery vehicle directly or may be dissolved in a plurality of beads suspended in the vehicle. The bead structure minimizes the molecular diffusion of the positively charged active ingredient and a catalytic species through the bead structure, thus stabilizes the positively charged active ingredient inside the bead by impeding<br><br>
the interaction of the positively charged active ingredient and the catalytic species, and thereby extending the shelf life of the positively charged active ingredient.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the active ingredient is an allylamine selected from the group consisting of terbinafine hydrochloride or naftifine hydrochloride. The active ingredient is dissolved in at least one solubilizer and the pH of the resulting mixture is adjusted to less than 7.5 using a buffer. The active ingredient is deemed to be completely dissolved in the allylamine/buffer/solubilizer mixture. The active ingredient can be added to the buffer first then the solubilizer(s) is added to completely dissolve the active ingredient or vice versa. In this embodiment, terbinafine hydrochloride is added to the buffer such that the final concentration of terbinafine hydrochloride in the bead structure is 0.001 to 6% (weight/weight). The preferred acidic buffer is a citrate buffer with a pH of less than 7.5. The preferred pH range of the acidic buffer is 3.5 to 6. The preferred citrate buffer is prepared by mixing citric acid and sodium citrate, however other commonly known acidic buffers may be used. An ultrasonic probe or other similar means may be used to assist the dissolution process.<br>
In order to completely dissolve the allylamine of the preferred embodiment, at least one solubilizer is used to dissolve the allylamine. In the preferred embodiment, the addition of ethanol was used as the solubilizer, however other known solubilizers may be used. The active ingredient is deemed to be completely dissolved in the allylamine/buffer/solubilizer mixture.<br>
At least one enhancer is then added to the mixture. The enhancers used in the preferred embodiment were ethanol, polysorbate 80, phospholipids, propylene glycol and/or 1,3-butanediol. However, other known enhancers such as other alcohols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, polyols, amides, pyrrolidone derivatives, surfactants, phospholipids and terpenes may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
Antioxidants are then added to the above mixture and stirred until dissolved. The antioxidants in the preferred embodiment were used to protect the active ingredients. The use of antioxidants for stabilizing preparations is common knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry. The antioxidants of the present invention are not specifically chosen for their antioxidant effect on skin. In the preferred embodiment, alpha-tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxylanisole are used as the antioxidants. However, other known antioxidants may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
Preservatives are then added to the mixture. In the preferred embodiment, methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate are dissolved in 1,3-butanediol. The preservative<br>
mixture is then added to the allylamine mixture above. In alternative embodiments, other types of preservatives may be used.<br>
A humectant is then added to the mixture. The humectants used in the preferred embodiments are 1,3-butanediol or propylene glycol. However, other known humectants such as glycerin, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
A viscosity increasing agent(s) is then added to the mixture. In the preferred embodiment carbopol 940 and/or hydroxyethyl cellulose dispersed in 1,3-butanediol or propylene glycol is used as the viscosity increasing agent(s). However, other known gelling agents or viscosity increasing agents such as other acrylic polymers, cellulose derivatives, natural gums and poloxamers may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
If needed, other acids or bases commonly used in pharmaceutical preparations such as hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide may be used to adjust the final pH to less than 7.5, preferably 3.5 to 6.0.<br>
A delivery vehicle is added and the resulting mixture placed in a storage container for future use or transferred into a dispenser for application to skin, skin appendages, and nails.<br>
In a preferred alternate embodiment, a vehicle containing a plurality of beads is used. In this embodiment, the invention is prepared as previously discussed but sodium alginate is used to increase the mixture viscosity instead of carbopol 940 and/or hydroxyethyl cellulose. Also, instead of placing the mixture in a storage container or a dispenser, the resulting mixture is then passed through a dispensing tip into a hardening agent. The effect of the interaction between the aliquoted solution and the hardening agent is to harden the outer most exposed area of each aliquot to form a bead. In the preferred embodiment, the mixture is passed through a dispensing tip having an orifice diameter of 0.2-5 millimeters. A plurality of beads is produced by the aliquoted mixture. Although a dispensing tip was used for the preferred embodiment, other commonly known dispensing methods may be used.<br>
Although 0.1-20% calcium chloride solution was used as the hardening agent in the preferred embodiment other types of hardening agents may be used. The type of hardening agent selected will depend on the polymer used to form the beads. For example, in alginate beads, a divalent cation is usually used, such as calcium ion or barium ion, especially calcium chloride and barium chloride.<br>
Each bead preferably measures 2-2.5 millimeters in size. However, the beads may range from 0.2 to 10 millimeters in size. The bead may be negatively charged due to the negative nature of alginate, although some of the alginate would cross-link with the calcium ions.<br>
The plurality of beads are then sieved and washed with an aqueous buffer solution. In the preferred embodiment, citrate buffer was used to wash the plurality of beads; however, other types of buffer solutions may be used. It is preferable that the citrate buffer has a pH of less than 7.5, and preferably has a pH of 3.5 to 6.0. In the alternate preferred embodiment, the plurality of beads is then delivered to a fluidized bed dryer by a motor-driven sieve belt. The plurality of beads is dried by vertically blowing them through the fluidized bed dryer or another type of mechanical delivery and drying method.<br>
The plurality of beads is then transferred to an agitator containing a gel base and mixed by a propeller until homogenous. Other gelling agents may be used to form the gel base, such as cellulose derivatives and xanthan gum. The resulting bead/gel mixture is then placed in a storage container for future use or placed into a dispensing container for application.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the gel is prepared by dispersing a gelling agent in a humectant. A buffer with a pH of less than 7.5, preferably 3.5 to 6.0, is added to the dispersion and stirred until homogeneous. Preservatives are dissolved in the humectant and added to the mixture and stirred until homogenous.<br>
In the preferred alternate embodiment, the gelling agent(s) used was carbopol 940 and/or hydroxylethyl cellulose. However, other known gelling agents or viscosity increasing agents such as other acrylic polymers, cellulose derivatives, natural gums and poloxamers may be used in alternative embodiments. The pH of the final gel is preferably 3.5 to 6.0 and may be adjusted using other commonly known pH adjusting solutions such as hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
In the preferred and alternate preferred embodiments, the gel acts as a delivery vehicle or base for the beads. The gel also acts as a storage medium. The base is not critical in the delivery of the active ingredient to the target location. In some embodiments the delivery vehicle may be transparent while in other embodiments the delivery vehicle may be opaque or colored. Transparency, opaqueness and color are characteristic of the type of vehicle used in the formulation. For example, if waxes are used as the vehicle, the vehicle would be white in color.<br>
Due to the fact that so many beads in the alternate preferred embodiment are contained in the base, the beads are in contact with one another and it is very hard to observe any changes in the base. In fact, the only way to determine if active ingredient is diffusing through the bead wall is to analyze the gel using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>

A viscosity increasing agent dissolved<br>
in a solvent is added to the mixture. The resulting mixture is then passed through dispensing tips into a hardening agent. As each aliquot of the dispensed mixture encounters the hardening agent a bead is formed. The dispensing step produces a plurality of beads. The plurality of beads are then sieved and washed with an aqueous buffer solution. The plurality of beads is then delivered to a fluidized bed dryer using a motor driven sieve belt. The plurality of beads is then dried by vertically blowing them through the fluidized bed dryer. The plurality of beads then are transferred to an agitator containing a gel base and mixed by a propeller until homogenous. The resulting bead/gel mixture is then placed in a storage container for future use or placed into a dispensing container for application.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the active ingredient is an allylamine selected from the group consisting of terbinafme hydrochloride or naftifine hydrochloride. However, in other embodiments, the active ingredient may be selected from any class of compound that is commercially available. Terbinafme is a white to off-white fine crystalline powder and has very limited solubility in water (7.5).<br>
In one of the preferred embodiments, the terbinafine hydrochloride is the allylamine used to make the invention. In this embodiment, terbinafine hydrochloride is added to an acidic buffer such that the final concentration of terbinafine hydrochloride in the bead structure is 0.001 to 6% (weight/weight). The preferred acidic buffer is a citrate buffer with a pH of less than 7.5. The preferred pH range of the acidic buffer is 3.5 to 6. The preferred citrate buffer is prepared by mixing citric acid and sodium citrate. Although citrate buffer was used in the preferred embodiment, other commonly known acidic buffer solutions may be used, such as phosphate buffer or acetate buffer.<br>
In order to completely dissolve the allylamine of the preferred embodiment, at least one solubilizer is used to dissolve the allylamine. In the preferred embodiment, the addition of ethanol was used as the solubilizer. An ultrasonic probe was used to assist the dissolution of the terbinafine hydrochloride. The active ingredient is deemed to be completely dissolved in the allylamine/buffer/solubilizer mixture. Although ethanol was used in the preferred embodiment, other known solubilizers such as other alcohols, glycols, surfactants and complexing agents may be used in alternative embodiments. Furthermore, other commercially available mechanism may be used to assist the dissolution of the allylamine.<br>
At least one enhancer is then added to the mixture. The enhancers used in the preferred embodiment were ethanol, polysorbate 80, phospholipids, propylene glycol and/or 1,3-butanediol. However, other known enhancers such as other alcohols, fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid esters, polyols, amides, pyrrolidone derivatives, surfactants, phospholipids and terpenes may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
Antioxidants are then added to the above mixture and stirred until dissolved. The antioxidants in the preferred embodiment were used to protect the active ingredients. The use of antioxidants for stabilizing preparations is common knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry. The antioxidants of the present invention are not specifically chosen for their antioxidant effect on skin.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, alpha-tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoluene and butylated hydroxylanisole are used as the antioxidants. However, other known antioxidants may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
Preservatives are then added to the mixture. In the preferred embodiment, methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate are dissolved in 1,3-butanediol. The preservative mixture is then added to the allylamine mixture above. In alternative embodiments, other types of preservatives may be used.<br>
A humectant is then added to the mixture. The humectants used in the preferred embodiments are 1,3-butanediol or propylene glycol. However, other known humectants such as glycerin, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol may be used in alternative embodiments. The humectant promotes the retention of moisture in the invention.<br>
A viscosity increasing agent(s) is then added to the mixture. In the preferred embodiment carbopol 940 and/or hydroxyethyl cellulose dispersed in 1,3-butanediol or propylene glycol was used as the viscosity increasing agent(s). However, other known gelling agents or viscosity increasing agents such as acrylic polymers, cellulose derivatives, natural gums and poloxamers may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
If needed, other acids or bases commonly used in pharmaceutical preparations such as hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide may be used to adjust the final pH to less than 7.5, preferably 3.5 to 6.0.<br>
The procedure for making one embodiment of the invention would be as follows:<br>

hi a fifth preferred embodiment, the following ingredients were used:<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The citrate buffer is used to make pH of less than 7.5 (preferably 3.5-6.0).<br>
In an alternate embodiment of the preferred invention, a vehicle containing a plurality of beads is used to make the invention. In this preferred embodiment, the bead structure is prepared by dissolving the active ingredient in a solubilizer and the pH of resulting mixture is adjusted to<br><br>
less than 7.5 using a buffer. An ultrasonic probe or other similar means may be used to assist the dissolution process. Antioxidants, enhancers, preservatives and humectants are then added to the mixture using the same procedure as the preferred embodiments previously described. A viscosity increasing agent is then added to the mixture. The viscosity increasing agent used in the this embodiment was sodium alginate dispersed in 1,3-butanediol. However, other known ^viscosity increasing agents may be used in alternative embodiments.<br>
The resulting mixture is then passed through a dispensing tip into a hardening agent. The effect of the interaction between the aliquoted solution and the hardening agent is to harden the outer most exposed area of each aliquot to form a bead. In the preferred embodiment, the mixture is passed through a dispensing tip having an orifice diameter of 0.2-5 millimeters. A plurality of beads is produced by the aliquoted mixture. Although a dispensing tip was used for the preferred embodiment, other commonly known dispensing methods may be used.<br>
In the preferred alternate embodiment, a 0.1-20% calcium chloride solution was used as the hardening agent. Other types of hardening agents may be used. The type of hardening agent selected will depend on the polymer used to form the beads. For example, in alginate beads, a divalent cation is usually used, such as calcium ion or barium ion, especially calcium chloride and barium chloride.<br>
In the alternate preferred embodiment, each bead measures 2-2.5 millimeters in size. However, the beads may range from 0.2 to 10 millimeters in size. The bead may be negatively charged due to the negative nature of alginate, although some of the alginate would cross-link with the calcium ions. The applicants have not yet performed any experiments to determine cross-linking density and drug release rates through the bead shell.<br>
The plurality of beads are then sieved and washed with an aqueous buffer solution. In the preferred embodiment, citrate buffer was used to wash the plurality of beads. It is preferable that the citrate buffer has a pH of less than 7.5, and preferably has a pH of 3.5 to 6.0. In alternative embodiments, other types of buffer solutions may be used. In the alternate preferred embodiment, the plurality of beads is then delivered to a fluidized bed dryer by a motor-driven sieve belt. The plurality of beads is dried by vertically blowing them through the fluidized bed dryer. Although a motor-driven sieve belt and a fluidized bed dryer were used in the preferred embodiment, other types of mechanical delivery and drying methods may be used.<br>
The plurality of beads is then transferred to an agitator containing a gel base and mixed by a propeller until homogenous.   Other gelling agents may be used to form the gel base, such as<br><br>
cellulose derivatives and xanthan gum. The resulting bead/gel mixture is then placed in a storage container for future use or placed into a dispensing container for application.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the gel is prepared by dispersing a gelling agent in a humectant. A buffer with a pH of less than 7.5, preferably 3.5 to 6.0, is added to the dispersion and stirred until homogeneous. Preservatives are dissolved in the humectant and added to the mixture and stirred until homogenous.<br>
In the preferred alternate embodiment, the gelling agent(s) used was carbopol 940 and/or hydroxylethyl cellulose. However, other known gelling agents or viscosity increasing agents such as acrylic polymers, cellulose derivatives, natural gums and poloxamers may be used in alternative embodiments. The pH of the final gel is preferably 3.5 to 6.0 and may be adjusted using other commonly known pH adjusting solutions such as hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide.<br>
In the preferred and alternate embodiments, the gel acts as a delivery vehicle or base for the beads. The gel also acts as a storage medium. The base is not critical in the delivery of the active ingredient to the target location. In some embodiments the delivery vehicle may be transparent while in other embodiments the delivery vehicle may be opaque or colored. Transparency, opaqueness and color are characteristic of the type of vehicle used in the formulation. For example, if waxes are used as the vehicle, the vehicle would be white in color.<br>
Due to the fact that so many beads in the alternate preferred embodiment are contained in the base, the beads are in contact with one another and it is very hard to observe any changes in the base. In fact, the only way to determine if active ingredient is diffusing through the bead wall is to analyze the gel using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
The procedure for making one alternate embodiment of the invention's beads would be as follows:<br>
1.	Dissolve terbinafine HC1 in 5-50% ethanol in a closed system to completely dissolve terbinafine HC1.<br>
2.	Add 18.6 -92.3% citrate buffer with a pH of less than 7.5 (preferably 3.5-6.0) in step 1 using an ultrasonic probe.<br><br>
3.	Add 0.001-0.2% alpha-tocopherol, butylated hydroxytoluene, and butylated hydroxylanisole to the mixture and stir until dissolved.<br>
4.	Dissolve 0.1-0.2% methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.01-0.1% propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in 0.5-2% 1,3-butanediol and add to the mixture.<br>
5.	Disperse 0.5 to 2.0% sodium alginate in 2-10% 1,3-butanediol and add to the mixture.<br>
6.	Pass the mixture through tips with a diameter of 0.2-5 mm to 0.1-20% calcium chloride solution and beads are formed.<br>
7.	Sieve the beads and wash them using citrate buffer with a pH of less than 7.5 (preferably 3.5-6.0).<br>
8.	Deliver the beads using a sieve belt driven by a motor to a fluidized bed dryer and dry them by vertically blowing them through the fluidized bed dryer.<br>
9.	Transfer the beads to an agitator containing carbopol gel and mix them using a propeller until homogeneous.<br>
A step by step procedure of making one embodiment of the invention's gel base is as follows:<br>
1.	Disperse 0.1-2.5% of carbomer 940 in 2.00-20% of 1,3-butanediol.<br>
2.	Add citrate buffer with a pH of less than 7.5 (preferably 3.5-6.0) to the carbomer dispersion and stir until homogeneous.<br>
3.	Dissolve 0.1-0.2% methyl 4-hydroxybenzoate and 0.01-0.1% propyl 4-hydroxybenzoate in 0.5-2% 1,3-butanediol and add to the mixture.<br>
4.	Adjust pH of the mixture to less than 7.5 (preferably 3.5-6.0) using hydrochloric acid or potassium hydroxide solution if needed, and stir until homogeneous.<br>
The following data, obtained during development of the invention, shows terbinafine hydrchloride amount (mg) in each bead normalized to a weight of 0.0073 grams per bead (average weight of 10 beads). The average amount of terbinafine HC1 per bead is 0.095±0.004 mg.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Each bead is a protective envelop which is designed to extend the shelf life of the positively charged active ingredient contained within each individual bead. In the preferred alternate embodiment, the bead structure is more like a solid than an aqueous gel base. Therefore it is difficult for the molecules inside the beads to diffuse and react. Thus the bead structure helps stabilize the ingredients inside.<br>
As long as the bead is in the delivery vehicle, the bead retains and limits the active ingredient to enter the delivery vehicle. This allows the use of a bead and the delivery vehicle to form combinations desirable for other ingredients which may be interactive in regular vehicles.<br>
Analysis of one preferred embodiment shows the bead structure helps stabilize the ingredients inside. When using terbinafine hydrochloride as the active ingredient, it has been shown that the predicted shelf-life of terbinafine hydrochlorie as used in the present invention is greater when compared to terbinafine hydrochloride in gel alone (without the bead structure of the present invention).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
By extrapolating the zero order kinetics of the data above (Terbinafine concentration (g%) = - 0.000195 time (days) + 1.0158), the predicted shelf-life of terbinafine in gel is 532 days, while the zero order kinetics of terbinafine beads in gel (Terbinafine concentration (g%) = - 0.000091 time (days) + 1.0111) gives the predicted shelf-life of 1134 days.<br>
In prototype development, the composition of each bead was so protective, that the allylamine terbinafine hydrochloride was retained in bead.   Analysis of prototype samples was<br>
conducted during development found the amount of terbinafine HCl leaking from the beads to be 0.27%, 4.25%, and 6.37% of terbinafine HCl in gel base after 1,46, and 84 days, respectively.<br>

In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the active ingredient is prepared in an acidic environment which alters the physicochemical properties of the active ingredient resulting in a positive charge. This positive charge and the enhancers used provide the increased effectiveness of active ingredient for topical treatment of fungal infections of the skin and skin appendages. In one preferred embodiment using terbinafine, prototype development revealed positive charge.<br>
The positive charge can be determined by examining the pKa of the active ingredient. For example, the pKa of terbinafine is 7.10. Theoretically at a pH of 7.10, there are 50% positively charged terbinafine molecules and 50% unionized terbinafine molecules. At pH  pKa the positively charged terbinafine is less than 50%. At pH of 5.10, there should be about 99% positively charged terbinafine and about 1% unionized terbinafine. On the other hand, at pH of 9.10, there should be about 99% unionized terbinafine and about 1% positively charged terbinafine.<br>
Prototype measurements of zeta potential of the 0.02 g/ml terbinafine hydrochloride solution and the result is positive at pH of below 5.11. However, there are other anions in the solution, e.g., chloride ion and hydroxide ion (sodium hydroxide was used to adjust the solution pH) that make negative values of zeta potential.<br><br>
