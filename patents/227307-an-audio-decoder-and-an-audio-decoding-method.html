				<td>AN AUDIO DECODER AND AN AUDIO DECODING<br>
METHOD<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an audio decoder and an audio decoding method and. generally pertains to audio signal processing and pertains more particularly to techniques for decoding multichannel signals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The music industary has used two-channel stereo for half a century Typically, the main vocal signais (or other centrally located signals) are mixed equally into the left and right channels to create a center "phantom" image for listeners situated equidistant from the left- and right-channel loudspeakers.<br>
A well recognized shortcoming of two-channel stereo listening is the collapse of the sound field as one moves away from the ideal central "sweet spot". Central signals appear to come from the loudspeaker closest to the listener rather than from a point between the loudspeakers of the two channels. One known way of avoiding or reducing this problem is to use a third center channel; however, three-channel source material has not been very common.<br>
Another known way to reduce this problem is to apply a logic matrix decoder to a two-channel source to derive one or more additional signals including a center channel signal. A Dolby Pro Logic decoder, for example, accepts two input signals and derives left (L), center (C), right (R) and surround (S) output signals. The Pro Logic IT decoder derives L, C, R, left-surround (Ls) and right-surround (Rs) output signals from a two-channel source and is intended to work with either Dolby Surround encoded material or conventional stereo recordings.<br>
It is well established that a key benefit of Pro Logic surround decoding is the center-channel output that improves the stability of central signal images for listeners seated off the central axis of the loudspeaker system. This benefit is equally available in the simpler 3-channel (L, C, R) matrix decoding system known as Dolby 3 Stereo. Applications tor all the above decodeis include both home and car audio systems<br><br>
A similar benefit may be obtained for surround channel signals by applying logic matrix decoders in multichannel systems such as those systems providing conventional 5 or 5.1-channel discrete source signals. In this application, which is called Surround EX, a logic matrix decoder is fed with the Ls and Rs signals of a 5-channel soundtrack to derive three surround channels (Ls, Bs, Rs) from the original two. Fig. 1 provides a block diagram of this application. Listeners seated off center are better able to sense the directional cues intended to come from between the Ls and Rs channel loudspeakers.<br>
With the advent of DVD audio, 5.1-channel audio programs are becoming more commonplace. One might expect the problem with sound field collapse will be easily avoided with 5.1-channel systems because they provide a discrete center channel. Unfortunately, the problem will not be avoided because these systems afford additional flexibility in how vocal signals are mixed among the three front channels. In some cases, vocal signals are mixed as before, exclusively in the L/R channels, to create a phantom center image. In other cases, vocal signals are mixed into only the center channel. In yet other cases, vocal signals are mixed into all three front channels in varying proportions. While these mixing choices may affect the integration or clarity of the vocal signals, in most cases the vocals are intended to be perceived as emanating from the center of the soundstage. For those mixes that place vocal and other central signals into the L/R channels rather than the center channel, sound field collapse will still occur for listeners that are not situated in or near a central listening location.<br>
For listeners seated off-center, a mix with vocal signals only in the center loudspeaker will impart an aural image of the vocal signals closest to center of the soundstage independent of listener location. As the center channel is used proportionally less, the vocal image shifts towards the listener's location. This is similar to the problem already described for two-channel sources; however, the solution to the problem is complicated by the presence of the center-channel signal. A 5.1 channel program with vocal signals in only the center channel can preserve a central aural image despite listener location and does not need any further modification. A program that uses only the L and R channels has the same limitations as standard two-channel recordings, and programs that place vocal signals into the L, C and R channels will produce central aural images having locational stability<br><br>
somewhere between that provided by these two extremes. The end result is that current mixing techniques do not assure consistent vocal imaging results for all listener locations. This is sometimes a problem for listeners at home, but it is almost always a problem for listeners in cars because typically no listener is centrally located relative to the loudspeakers.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
More particular mention is made of "vocal signals" and "vocal images" in this disclosure because musical programs of two or more channels typically are designed to present these types of signals at the center of the sound stage. The present invention may be applied to any type of signal and is not limited to vocal signals. References herein to vocal signals and the like should be understood to refer to any type of aural signal that is intended to be presented at or near the center of the soundstage.<br>
One implementation of a system that can provide a stable central aural image is illustrated in Fig. 2. In this implementation, the C channel signal is distributed or mixed into the L and R channels to provide a two-channel signal. The vocal signals pre-existing in the C channel are mixed into both L and R channels at the same level. The resulting two-channel signal is then processed to derive three channels (L, C and<br><br>
R) with a dominant portion of the vocal signals in the C channel, which provides a consistent central aural image using three front loudspeakers.<br>
Another implementation of a system that can provide a stable central image is illustrated in Fig. 3. Unlike the first implementation, this second implementation does not mix the C channel signal into the L and R channel signals. Instead, it extracts the vocal signals that are in the L and R channel signals and adds the extracted vocal signals to the C channel signal. As a result, the stability of the vocal image presented by the signal pre-existing in the C channel is not adversely affected and leakage or coupling of the C channel signal into other channels is avoided. This generally provides a cleaner and more stable sound image and better lateral separation of the images produced by the L and R channel signals. If a multi-channel program has no significant signal present in the C channel, this second implementation provides a result that is essentially the same as that provided by the first implementation shown in Fig. 2.<br>
Principles of the present invention may also be applied to other channels. For example, as shown in Fig. 4, a 5-channel decoder derives a C channel signal as discussed above in connection with Fig. 3 and also derives a pair of surround channel signals that are added to the original Ls and Rs channel signals. This technique can be used to enhance the spatial effect of a program without causing any leakage of the original surround channel signals into the front channel signals.<br>
The several figures and associated text omit various aspects that may be important in a practical implementation but are not needed to describe the present invention. For example, an implementation of the decoder component shown in the figures may introduce a phase shift or time delay in the signals that it processes. In such cases, a preferred implementation includes delay elements or other processing components in direct signal paths so that phase shifts and time delays for all channels are identical or substantially identical. Referring to Fig. 4, for example, components that provide an appropriate phase shift or time delay may be inserted into the signal paths for the C, Ls and Rs channels at a point prior to or "upstream" from the summing components.<br><br>
