PROVISIONAL / COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See section 10 and rule 13)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF MAGGOT CONTROL FORMULATION OF BEAUVARIA BASSIANA AND FORMULATION OBTAINED THEREFROM."<br>
2. APPLICANT<br>
(a)	NAME	: SUDARSHAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY: An Indian Company registered under the provisions of<br>
the Companies Act, 1956.<br><br>
(c) ADDRESS<br><br>
:  162, Wellesley Road, PUNE- 411001, Maharashtra State, India.<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
Present invention relates to a process for the preparation of maggot control formulation of Beauvaria bassiana. More particularly present invention relates to the process for the preparation of maggot control formulation of Beauvaria bassiana and chemical insecticide Imidachlopride.<br>
Background&amp; Prior Art:<br>
As per literature, there are several kinds of flies common in and around caged layer houses. The most common flies are housefly and little housefly. Other flies associated are black garbage fly, blowfly, soldier fly and small dung fly, fruit fly and rattailed maggots. These mentioned flies pass through the stages of life as<br>
!-   Egg<br>
2.	larvae<br>
3.	pupa and<br>
4.	Adult.<br>
Adult flies deposit small white oval eggs on the breeding media and creamy white larvae (maggots) develop in this wet material. Mature maggots crawl out of this material and move to a drier place for pupation. The brown seed like pupa finally yields adult flies. Development from egg to adult fly may take a period of 7 to 10 days under ideal conditions. Adult females lay about 75 to 200 eggs in 3 to 4 days interval. It is observed that flies in the poultry house can be present the year around provided favorable microclimate is present.<br>
There are in existence number of chemicals such as dichlovos, diazinon which are used for destroying maggot population in poultry industry. Use of feed additive like larvex, which is an enzyme, based product containing Cyromazine enzyme. This is an insect growth regulator that breaks the fly life cycle at larval stage.<br>
?<br><br>
It is to be noted that the use of chemicals, normally due to its inherent properties results in several of the following :-<br>
1.	Although a new chemical gives effective maggot control initially, the flies soon develop resistance to these chemicals.<br>
2.	The smell of chemicals is known to develop stress in the birds leading to lesser productivity in poultry industry.<br>
3.	The chemicals are also highly toxic.<br>
As per literature, it is also mentioned that an entomopathogenic fungus Beauvaria bassiana can be used for control of insects like mites in agriculture and other insects. But it is worthwhile to note that there is no report or literature on use of Beauvaria bassiana commercially or otherwise for the control of maggots in poultry industry. There are certain inherent limitations on use of bio-control agents like<br>
1.	No immediate kill takes place by using biological agent.<br>
2.	The effect of product is seen only after 6-8 days of application.<br>
3.	Due  to slow  action  of biological control agent maggot population keep increasing.<br>
These limitations can be explained with the following example. Example 1<br>
Area selected -5 x 100 ft.<br>
Duration of the application - one spray after every 10-15 days Dosage 20 gm/ L ( Tank mix)<br>
Product combination Beauvaria wettable powder product only. Pretreatment observations<br>
1.	population count - Average. 5000-6000 maggots/sqm<br>
2.	Below dry litter surface there were plenty of maggots seen.<br><br>
Post treatment observations -<br>
1.	Population count -Average. 2500-3000 maggots/ sqm<br>
2.	Below dry litter surface the maggot population is almost zero.<br>
Immediate kill of maggots was not observed. The control effect of treatment was observed only after 6-7 days.<br>
It is object of the present invention aims at developing the process for the preparation of maggot control formulation of Beauvaria bassiana with Imidachlopride.<br>
It is also the object of the present invention to provide a product for controlling the maggots population in poultry industry leading to reduction in number of flies.<br>
It is one more object of the present invention to form a product for the immediate killing of the maggots.<br>
A process for the formation of maggot control formulation of Beauvaria<br>
bassiana in poultry industry comprising the following<br>
(a) growing Beauvaria bassiana by preparing a biomass growth medium such as comprising sugar, potato, starch, sodium chloride and yeast extracts dissolved in water and filling in number of bottles at the rate of approx. 50-200ml volume in 1 litre bottle, plugging the open mouth of each bottle by cotton ; and then sterilizing by    autoclaving i.e - exposing of the bottles to 121° C temperature and 15 pounds per square inch pressure for 15-20 min; the pure culture so obtained is then inoculated in each of the bottle and the said process of inoculation being done in the laminar air flow unit i.e bacteria free Zero contamination air; the inoculated bottles are further incubated under ambient temperature; the fungal growth (biomass) which is obtained after 6-8 days is then harvested, blended and mixed with inert carrier talc material, the ratio of biomass carrier being maintained 1:1 and then mixture is<br>
4<br><br>
dried in shed till the moisture level reaches in the range of 6-8%, material and is then sieved to have uniform powder, thereafter<br>
(b)	forming a chemical wettable powder of 20-80% active imidachloprid as per<br>
following conditions the technical grade imidachloprid in powder which<br>
contains 99%-100% active  ingredient is weighed and mixed with china clay<br>
and other inert carrier materials, the quantity of technical material and<br>
carriers is so maintained that it will give 20-80%   active contents in the<br>
prepared formulation and thus formulated material is sieved, if required,<br>
and then<br>
(c)	mixing the chemical formulation of step (b) in the biological formulation of<br>
step (a) in the range of lto 50% by weight to form the maggot control<br>
formulation of Beauvaria bassiana resulting in the concentration in the range<br>
of 0.1% to 0.5% of chemical wettable powder in the 20 gm/ltr mixture to get<br>
the maggot control formulation.<br>
If desired other insecticides like Dichlorovas can also be added. The present invention also relates to a formulation obtained by the above process of invention.<br>
Present Invention:<br>
According to this invention therefore, a process for the formation of maggot control formulation of Beauvaria bassiana in poultry industry comprising the steps of; a.   growing  Beauveria  bassiana  in  laboratory  as  per  the  conditions  herein<br>
described and subsequently forming the biological wettable powder product;<br>

b.	forming the chemical wettable powder of 30-80% active Imidachloprid as per<br>
the conditions herein described;<br>
c.	mixing the chemical formulation of step ( b) in the biological formulation of<br>
step (a) in the range of 1 to 50 % by weight to form the maggot control<br>
formulation of Beauveria bassiana.<br>
The process to form the wettable powder of Beauvaria Bassiana is as follows A] Beauvaria bassiana was grown in lab as per following procedure. The process involves the following stages -<br>
The biomass growth medium is prepared, it contains sugar, potato starch, and yeast extracts all dissolved in water. It is further filled in the bottles at the rate of approx. 100-200ml volume in 1 Lit. bottle. To the open mouth of the bottle cotton plugging is done. This way number of bottles were prepared, they are then sterilized by autoclaving, (autoclaving - expose of the bottles to 121 o C temperature &amp;: 15 pounds pressure for 15-20 min). The pure culture is inoculated in each of the bottle. The process of inoculation is done in the *laminar air flow unit ('[bacteria free Zero contamination air). The inoculated bottles are further incubated under ambient temperature. The fungal growth (biomass) is obtained after 6-8 days. The biomass is then harvested, blended &amp; mixed with inert carrier talc material. The 1:1 ratio of biomass ; carrier is maintained. The mixture is dried in shed till the moisture level reaches in the range of 6-8%. The material is then sieved to have uniform powder.<br>
B] Imidachloprid WP<br>
The process of preparation of Imidachloprid WP involves the following stages -<br>
The technical grade Imidachloprid is taken. The material is in powder form &amp; contains 99% - 100% active ingredient. This material is weighed &amp; mixed with china clay &amp; other inert carrier materials. The quantity of Technical material &amp;<br>
6<br><br>
carriers is so adjusted that it will give 20 -60 % active contents in the prepared formulation. Formulated material is sieved if required. This material is termed as Imidachloprid wp.<br>
