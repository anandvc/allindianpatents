This invention relates t© vector expression of heterologous protein and a method of purifying isolated recombinant insulin.<br>
The present invention relates to a multi-purpose vector. The vector can be for expressing at least one heterologous protein in a suitable cell such as E.coli or other gram negative bacteria. More specifically, the present invention relates to: a vector for expression of heterologous proteins comprising nucleic acid molecules for: an origin of replication region, optionally but preferably a selection marker (which can be a coding nucleic acid molecule inserted in a restriction site), a promoter, an initiation region e.g. a translation initiation regicm and/or a riboscme binding site, at least one restriction site and preferaly multiple restriction sites, and a transcription terminator, a method for extracting recombinant protein without lysing tiie cell, e.g., bacteria; and a method for purifying isolated recombinant protein. The vector can facilitate the termo-regulated production of a heterologous protein or proteins, e.g., pro-insulin.<br>
Several publications are referenced in this application. Full citation to<br>
these pubhcations is found at the end of the specification, immediately<br>
preceding the claims, or where the publication is mentioned; and each of<br>
these publications is hereby incorporated by reference. These	<br><br>
publications relate to the state of the art to which the invention pertains; however, there is no admission that any of these publications is indeed prior art. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recombinant DNA technology has enabled the expression of foreign (heterologous) proteins in microbial and other host cells.  A vector containing genetic material directing the host cell to produce a protein encoded by a portion of the heterologous DNA sequence is introduced into the host, and the transformant host cells can be fermented and subjected to conditions which facilitate the expression of the heterologous DNA, leading to the formation of large quantities of the desired protein.<br>
The advantages of using a recombinantly produced protein in lieu of isolation from a natural source include:  the ready availability of raw material; high expression levels, which is especially useful for proteins of low natural abundance; the ease with which a normally intracellular protein can be excreted into the expression medium, facilitating the purification process; and the relative ease with which modified (fusion) proteins can be created to further simplify the purification of the resultant protein.<br>
However, the aforementioned benefits of recombinant DNA technology are also accompanied by several disadvantages, namely: the required elements of the active protein which result from<br><br>
post-translational modification (i.e., glycosylation) may not be carried out in the expression medium; proteolytic degradation of newly formed protein may result upon expression in host cells; and the formation of high molecular weight aggregates, often referred to as "inclusion bodies" or "refractile bodies", which result from the inability of the expressed proteins to fold correctly in an unnatural cellular environment.  The recombinant protein cannot be excreted into the culture media upon formation of inclusion bodies.<br>
Inclusion bodies contain protein in a stable non-native conformation; or, the protein aggregates may be amorphous, comprised of partially and completely denatured proteins, in addition to aberrant proteins synthesized as a result of inaccurate translation.  Such inclusion bodies constitute a large portion of the total cell protein.<br>
Inclusion bodies present significant problems during the purification of recombinant proteins, as they are relatively insoluble in aqueous buffers.  Denaturants and detergents, i.e., guanidine hydrochloride, urea, sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and Triton X-100, may be necessary to isolate the proteins from the inclusion bodies, often at the expense of the biological activity of the protein itself, resulting from incorrect folding and modification of the amino acid residues in the sequence.<br>
Additionally, a result of the expression of recombinant DNA in B. coli  is the accumulation of high concentrations of<br><br>
acetate in the media, mainly during the induction phase.  The deleterious effect of acetate accumulation (greater than 5g/L) on cell growth and recombinant protein expression has been well documented in the literature.<br>
Further, the recovery of the desired protein from inclusion bodies is often complicated by the need to separate the desired protein from other host cellular materials, in addition to separating the desired protein from inclusion body heterologous protein contaminants.  The latter problem results from the strong attraction that inclusion body proteins have for one another, due to strong ionic and hydrophobic interactions.<br>
Consequently, most established protocols for the isolation of recombinant proteins from inclusion bodies result in large quantities of biologically inactive material, and very low yields of active protein, uncontaminated by extraneous heterologous protein.<br>
Researchers have focused on the manipulation of phage in order to stimulate protein synthesis by a variety of methods.<br>
strong promoters that are negatively controlled by the repr coded by the gene cl.     The mutation cl857 rendered the reprei<br>
J	__j_J	i__       ■     1     		1	    _1__   __    -^r-iO&gt;-«        ii-il _    _.      i_1_       _     __     _._'_.<br>
The promoters of the Lambda phage (Pl and PR) are strong promoters that are negatively controlled by the repressor<br>
issor inactivate at temperatures above 3 7°C.  Thus, the expression of a sequence controlled by these promoters and by the repressor cl857 can be activated by a simple change in temperature.  These promoters are often used in E.   coli  expression vectors, because<br><br>
they are strong and efficiently repressed (Denhardt &amp; Colasanti, 1987).<br>
Remaut et al. (1981) constructed a set of plasmids containing the promoter PL-  The promoter and the trp region of the gene were taken from a family of phages (trp44) and inserted in the plasmid pBR322, creating the first plasmid of a series, plasmid pPLa2.  After several manipulations, other plasmids were obtained.  The plasmids pPLa2 and pPLa8 contained the promoter PL fragment, the origin of replication, the ampicillin resistance gene from the plasmid pBR322, and a kanamycin resistance gene from the plasmid pMK20,  The promoter region contained the promoter/operator and the nuth  site (antitermination), but it was lacking the beginning of the gene N.<br>
The plasmids pPLc236, pPLc28 and pPLc24 are different from the previously identified plasmids, with respect to the direction of transcription from the promoter PL in relation to the orientation of the origin of replication, as found in pBR322 (a = anticlockwise, c = clockwise).  The kanamycin resistance gene is absent in these three vectors.  The difference between pPLc236 and pPLc8 is the presence or absence of a region (present in the former and absent in the latter), which affects the region of unique cloning sites.  pPLc24 was derived from pPLc28 by insertion of a region containing the ribosome binding site of the gene for replicase from the phage MS2, enabling the expression of eukaryotic genes.<br><br>
These plasmids were tested with the expression of different genes, e.g., the gene trpA from Salmonella   typhimurium, cloned in the plasmid pPLc23 (predecessor of pPLc236), which showed 40% induction of product in relation to the total cellular protein.  pLc236 programmed in B. coli  resulted in a expression of the gene ROP  as 20% of the total protein (Muesing et al., 1984).  The proteins p4 and p3 of the phage 29 of Bacillus subtilis,   were also produced from pPLci and reached 30% and 6%, respectively, of the total cellular protein induced in E.   coli, after thermal induction (Mellado &amp; Salas, 1982).<br>
In 1983, Remault et al. (1983a) built a plasmid pPLc245, derived from pPLc24, in which the initial coding region of replicase was deleted and a region with several unique cloning-sites was added, permitting direct expression.  The gene for human a-interferon was cloned into this plasmid, resulting in induction of protein of approximately 2% to 4% of the total cellular protein.  For a-interferon, the levels of expression varied from 3% to 25% of the cellular protein, depending on the plasmids used, e.g., pPLc245, pPLc28 and pCP40, and on the presence of a transcription-terminator from phage T4 (Simons et al., 1984).  The plasmid pCP40, derived from pPL, was built by Remaut et al. (1983b).  The promoter-region was transferred to a plasmid derived from pKN402 with temperature dependent 'runaway' replication.  When the cultures are heated to 42°C, the repressor cl587 is deactivated and the promoter PL is liberated, resulting<br><br>
in an increase in the number of copies of the plasmid pCP40, by approximately ten fold.<br>
Growl et al. (1985) relates to four plasmids containing the promoter PL.  The plasmid pRC2 3 was built containing the promoter PL and a synthetic Shine-Dalgarno region, without the codon ATG, cloned in the plasmid pRC2 (derived from pBR322).  To build the other three plasmids, pEV-vrfl, pEV-vrf2 and pEV-vrf3, a region with unique cloning sites was inserted, adding the initial ATG codon, such that in each one the reading frames are on phase.  The plasmid pRC23 was used for the expression of interleucine-2 and of-interferon, with a level of 10% to 20% of the total cellular protein.<br>
Lautenberg et al. (1983) built the plasmid pJL6, containing the promoter PL, which codes for initiation of translation of the gene cll  of the phage, with unique Clal and Hindlll cloning sites, located at 50 bp from the initial ATG site.  Genes, adequately cloned in these sites are induced, producing fusion proteins with the protein CII.  Seth et al. (1986) modified this vector so that the induction of proteins could occur without fusion.  Three plasmids were constructed, containing a Kpnl   site in pANK-12, an Hpal site in pANH-1, and an Wdel site in pPL2 of the initial codon ATG of the gene CII  of pJL6.  In pANH-1, the amino acid 'valine' occurred more frequently in the amino-end of the induced protein.  Production of oncogenes was obtained from these vectors.<br><br>
Chang and Peterson (1992) also modified the plasmid pJL6 and built a line of plasmids, pXC, in which the region for initiation of translation of the gene CII  was substituted by a synthetic one.  Additionally, a region was inserted having several unique cloning sites.  The region CII affects the efficiency of the translation if the expression is required without fusion.  With the synthetic region, the efficiency rose between 10 and 20 times, depending on the spacing region between SD and ATG.  The expression reached 48% of the total cellular protein for the protein 14-3-3 of cow brain, of which the DNA had been amplified by PCR.<br>
Schauder et al. (1987) built a line of plasmids derived from pJL6, containing the promoters P^ and PL in tandem, the region SD of the gene atpE   (for subunit of ATPase) , with the transcription terminator of the bacteriophage fd and with the gene of the repressor cl857  These plasmids were named pJLA501 to -05 and differ in the regions of the multiple cloning sites.  On testing the expression of the gene atpA (for a subunit of ATPase), an induction of 50% of the total cellular protein was found.  The genes sucC  and sucD, respectively, showed 3 0% and 15% induced protein in relation to the total cellular protein.<br>
Rosenberg et al. (1983) built the plasmid pKC30 and its derivatives-  The vector pKC30 is used for the expression of bacterial genes containing their proper translation-regulation regions.  This vector contains a unique cloning Hpal site.<br><br>
located 321 bp downstream from the promoter PL, within the coding region of the gene N.     The expression of the activator CII and eight mutants in just one amino acid was achieved in the vector pKC30.  Because CII is quickly recycled in E.   coli  and deleterious for cell growth, with insertion and expression of its gene in pKC30, levels of 3% to 5% of the total cellular protein were reached.  The production of the protein CII rose when the protein N (anti-terminator) was provided by the host-cell, because of the presence of the 'upstream' sequences of the gene CII  of the sites nuth,   nutR   (for anti-termination) and t^i (for termination).  Other proteins were expressed from pKC30, such as the protein B of the phage Mu (Chaconas et al., 1985) and the protein UvrA of E. coli  expressed at levels of 15% and 7% of the total cellular protein respectively.<br>
For the expression of eukaryotic genes the plasmid pASl, derived from pKC3 0, was built with the cloned gene CII. The complete coding region of CII was deleted and a BairHl   site was added immediately 'downstream' of the ATG initiation codon. In this manner, the regulating regions for translation were maintained in the vector and a eukaryotic or synthetic gene can be expressed if cloned correctly to the BairHI  site.  Expression of the gene for the antigen t of the virus SV40 resulted in this vector in levels of 10% of the total cellular proteins, after one hour of thermal induction (Rosenberg et al., 1983) .<br><br>
Lowman et al. (1988) modified the plasmid pASl, introducing a ncoI site in the initial ATG, creating the plasmid named pASl-N.  Expression of the gene CAT  and fusion with proteins of the virus SV4 0 were obtained.  Later, Lowman &amp; Bina (1990) used these products to study the effect of temperature in thermal induction.<br>
Mott et al. (1985) used pKC30 and pASl to express the bacterial gene rho  and verified that the thermal induction did not result in high levels of expression of the protein Rho. Induction with nalidixic acid and mitomicina C was tested in the host cl, which provoked the induction of the syntheses of Rec a, resulting in an inactivation of the repressor cl.  In this manner, levels of expression varying from 5% to 40% of the cellular protein were reached.<br>
Hence, the manipulation of plasmids for expression of a protein or peptide of interest is a developing area and a method for the induction of complex proteins such as pro-insulin via manipulation of a plasmid and a plasmid therefrom, have not heretofore been developed or suggested.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 4,734,362, to Hung et al., is directed to a method of isolating polypeptides produced recombinantly in inclusion bodies.  The disclosed method includes the cell lysis, and recovery of inclusion bodies comprising the desired recombinant protein, solubilization with denaturant, protection of the sulfhydryl groups of the recombinant protein,<br><br>
derivatization of cationic amino groups of the protein, and recovery of the derivatized recombinant protein.<br>
Olson, U.S. Patent No. 4,518,526 relates to a method of releasing active proteins from inclusion bodies by cell lysis, centrifugation, denaturation and renaturation.  The patent teaches the necessity of the disruption of the cell to separate the soluble and insoluble protein, followed by treatment of the insoluble fraction with a strong denaturant, and recovery of the renatured heterologous protein.<br>
Rausch, U.S. Patent No. 4,766,224 is directed to a method of purification and solubilization of proteins produced in transformed microorganisms as inclusion bodies.  The purification is effected by solubilization of the inclusion bodies in detergent, treatment with a strong denaturant, followed by chromatographic separation to obtain renatured active protein.<br>
Builder et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,620,948 is concerned with a process for isolating and purifying inclusion bodies by lysing the cell culture, precipitation of protein, denaturation of the insoluble fraction, and renaturation to isolate the refractile protein.<br>
Similarly, U.S. Patent Nos. 4,734,368, 4,659,568, 4,902,783, 5,215,896, and EP 337,243 and WO 87/02673 are each directed to methods of purifying proteins entrapped in inclusion bodies.  These methods use of the following techniques (alone or in combination): cell lysis, denaturation, chromatographic<br><br>
separation, centrifugation, manipulation of the<br>
denaturation/renaturation of the protein, and the attachment of leader peptides which facilitate the separation of the proteins from the inclusion bodies.<br>
Each of the aforementioned prior art processes utilize methods which disrupt the cell to release the inclusion bodies from the cellular material.  There is no teaching or suggestion of a means for isolating inclusion bodies from cellular material without the disruption of the cell, nor is there a motivation to derive such a method from the teachings of the prior art. However, the lysis or disruption of cells is disadvantageous as it allows contaminants to be present with the desired protein, such as lipopolysaccharides, which are very difficult to separate from the desired protein.<br>

Human insulin, a proteolytic digestion product of pro-insulin, is a polypeptide hormone produced by beta cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas.  Its purpose is to decrease the amount of glucose in the blood by promoting glucose uptake by cells, and increasing the capacity of the liver to synthesize glycogen.  The action of insulin is antagonistic to glucagon.<br><br>
adrenal glucocorticoids and adrenaline, and its deficiency or reduced activity produces diabetes with a raised blood sugar level.<br>
Human insulin has been prepared from several sources, including: isolation from human pancreas, peptide synthesis, the semisynthetic conversion from porcine insulin and fermentation of E,   coli  bacteria or Saccharomyces  cerevisiae  yeast, suitably encoded by DNA recombinant methods.  These methods suffer from poor yield and cost efficiency, and the development of a high yielding, cost effective method of producing human insulin for the treatment of diabetes has been the subject of much research efforts in recent years.<br>
Hence, a method for the induction of human pro-insulin via recombinant techniques has not heretofore been realized, wherein the protein may be isolated in substantial quantities from inclusion bodies, especially such a method wherein cell lysis or cell disruption is avoided. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Objects of the present invention may include providing at least one of: a vector comprising at least one nucleic acid such as DNA for cloning of a nucleic acid or for expression of at least one heterologous protein by a cell such as Gram negative bacteria (the vector can comprise a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., DNA, encoding: an origin of replication region, optionally and preferably a selection marker (which can be a coding nucleic acid<br><br>
in a restriction site), a promoter, an initiation region e.g. a translation initiation region and/or a ribosome binding site, at least one restriction site for insertion of heterologous nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, encoding the heterologous protein, and a transcription terminator); a method for extracting a recombinant protein from within a cell such as a recombinant Gram negative bacteria having a cell membrane; and, a method for purifying an isolated recombinant human insulin.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a vector comprising at least one nucleic acid molecule such as DNA for cloning of a nucleic acid molecule, or more preferably, for expression of at least one heterologous protein by cell such as a Gram negative bacteria.  The vector can comprise DNA encoding the following: an origin of replication region, optionally and preferably a selection marker (which can be coding DNA in a restriction site), a promoter, an initiation region e.g. a translation initiation region and/or a ribosome binding site, at least one restriction site for insertion of heterologous DNA encoding the heterologous protein, and a transcription terminator.<br>
The Gram negative bacteria can be E,   coli.     The origin of replication region can be from plasmid pUC8.  The initiation region can be a translation initiation region and can be synthetic, e.g., synthetic Shine-Dalgarno regions from gene 10 of phage T7.  The selection marker can be a tetracycline resistance<br><br>
marker.  Alternatively or additionally, selection of transformed cells containing the vector can be on the basis of a product expressed by the heterologous DNA encoding the heterologous protein.  The promoter can be a PL promoter.  And, the transcription terminator can be a Rho-independent one.<br>
Thus, the invention can provide a vector comprising DNA for expression of a heterologous protein by a Gram negative bacteria.  The vector can comprise at least one nucleic acid molecule, e.g., DNA, encoding the following: an origin of replication region, a selection marker, a promoter, a translation initiation region or a ribosome binding site, at least one restriction site for insertion of heterologous DNA encoding the heterologous protein, and a transcription terminator.<br>
The DNA encoding the at least one restriction site preferably encodes multiple restriction sites; and, the multiple restriction sites are preferably Ncol,   EcoRl,   StuI, PstI, BainHI, and BspEI.<br>
The present invention further provides a vector for expression of a pro-insulin by a Gram negative bacteria.  That is, in the inventive vector, at the at least one restriction site for insertion of heterologous DNA (or a heterologous nucleic acid sequence) there can be inserted a nucleic acid molecule such as DNA encoding pro-insulin, e.g., human pro-insulin.  The protein expressed by the inserted nucleic acid molecule, e.g., pro-insulin such as human pro-insulin, can contain tag or a marker.<br><br>
for instance, a His tag (which is useful for separating, isolating and/or purifying the protein).<br>
And therefore, more generally, inventive vectors can include at least one exogenous coding nucleic acid molecule at the at least one restriction site for insertion of a heterologous nucleic acid molecule, e.g., exogenous coding DNA can be at the at least one restriction site for insertion of heterologous DNA. Further, the exogenous coding DNA can encode, in addition to the heterologous protein, a marker or tag, for instance a His tag.<br>
Still further, the invention provides a method for extracting a recombinant protein such as pro-insulin, e.g., human pro-insulin, from within a cell such as a recombinant Gram negative bacteria having a cell membrane, without lysing the bacteria.  The method can comprises the steps of:<br>
(a)	permeabilizing the cell membrane by contacting the bacteria with a detergent under conditions which facilitate the extraction of native cell proteins from the cell membrane without extracting the recombinant protein from the cell membrane;<br>
(b)	solubilizing the recombinant protein and cell membrane; and<br>
(c)	separating the recombinant protein from the cell membrane.<br><br>
The invention also provides a method for purifying an isolated recombinant protein such as pro-insulin, e.g., human insulin, comprising:<br>
(a)	subjecting the isolated recombinant human insulin<br>
to sulfitolysis and separating a liquid product<br>
therefrom,<br>
(b)	subjecting the liquid product from (a) to a Ni-chelating column and obtaining an eluate,<br>
(c)	renaturing the eluate from (b),<br>

The present invention provides various embodiments, including at least one of: a vector comprising at least one nucleic acid such as DNA for cloning of a nucleic acid or for expression of at least one heterologous protein by a cell such as gram negative bacteria (the vector can comprise a nucleic acid molecule, e.g., DNA, encoding: an origin of replication region.<br><br>
optionally and preferably a selection marker (wnicn can De  a coding nucleic acid in a restriction site), a promoter, an initiation region e.g. a translation initiation region and/or a ribosome binding site, at least one restriction site for insertion of heterologous nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, encoding the heterologous protein, and a transcription terminator); a method for extracting a recombinant protein from within a cell such as a recombinant Gram negative bacteria having a cell membrane; and, a method for purifying an isolated recombinant human insulin. Without limiting the general nature of the foregoing, the following provides a discussion of various embodiments, in detail.<br>
In an embodiment, the present invention relates to a method for permeabilization of a cell membrane of a cell such as a recombinant Gram negative bacteria, to extract a protein such as a recombinant protein, from within the cell membrane.<br>
Heterologous proteins are proteins which are normally either not produced by a host cell, or those which are normally produced only in limited amounts.  The advent of recombinant DNA technology and other standard genetic manipulations, such as point mutagenesis, has enabled the production of heterologous proteins in copious amounts from transfected host cell cultures.<br>
In practice, these heterologous proteins are frequently produced by genetic expression in quantities that involve<br><br>
precipitation under conditions which maintain the solubility of host cellular proteins.<br>
The present invention is directed to procedures for producing heterologous proteins and to methods of isolating and purifying heterologous proteins having minimal contamination by endotoxins.<br>
The present invention further relates to a method of producing proteins by recombinant DNA technology.  The invention relates to: a multi-purpose vector for expressing at least one heterologous protein in cells such as E. coli  or other gram negative bacteria; methods for producing such vectors; a method for extracting protein from a cell, such as a recombinant protein from bacteria, without lysing the cell or bacteria; and a method for purifying isolated recombinant protein.<br>
Recombinant DNA technology has enabled the expression of foreign (heterologous) proteins in microbial and other host cells.  In this process, a vector containing genetic material directing a host cell to produce a protein encoded by a portion of a heterologous DNA sequence is introduced into the host, and the transformed host cells can be fermented and subjected to conditions which facilitate the expression of the heterologous DNA, leading to the formation of large quantities of the desired protein.<br>
Plasmids are extensively used as vectors to clone DNA molecules.  Most plasmid vectors are made by taking DNA from a<br><br>
variety of replicons (plasmids, bacteriophage chromosomes and bacterial chromosomes) and joining the DNA together (using restriction enzymes and DNA ligase) to form a plasmid which has an origin of replication, a selection marker (usually an antibiotic-resistance gene) and a promoter for expressing genes of interest in the required host cell.<br>
In the present invention, DNA encoding a protein such as a precursor protein is inserted into a vector.  The coding sequence to be expressed is inserted in the correct relationship to a host-specific promoter and other transcriptional regulatory sequences and in the correct reading frame, so that the heterologous protein is produced.  The vector also contains sequences for efficient translation (e.g., the Shine-Dalgarno Region  for expression in bacterial cells).  Expression vectors usually contain a transcription termination site 3' to the inserted gene to ensure the mRNA produced to avoid run on through the plasmid.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the expression vector of the present invention, denoted pLMT8.5, contains the following:<br>
i.   Origin of replication, preferably of pUC8 (which insures a high copy number of the plasmid in the E.   coli recipient cells) ;<br>
ii.  A marker, preferably a tetracycline resistance marker from plasmid pRP4;<br><br>
iii.  A promoter, preferably a PL promoter isolated from bacteriophage lambda;<br>
iv.  Shine-Dalgarno regions, preferably synthetic Shine-Dalgarno regions, and preferably such synthetic regions from T7 phage gene 10;<br>
V.  A transcription terminator such as synthetic efficient transcription terminator which is Rho-independent; and<br>
vi. At least one restriction site, and preferably a region of multiple restriction sites to facilitate the cloning of the genes to be expressed.<br>
The construction of the plasmid pLMT8.5 is illustrated in Figs. 1-5, and Figs. lOA-M and llA-F show the nucleotide sequence and restriction sites in pLMTS.5.<br>
Into the at least one restriction site can be cloned at least one nucleotide sequence which can be exogenous, e.g., encoding an epitope of interest, a biological response modulator, a growth factor, a recognition sequence, a therapeutic gene, a fusion protein or other protein of interest (e.g., proinsulin) or combinations thereof.  With respect to these terms, reference is made to the following discussion, and generally to Kendrew, THE ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (Blackwell Science Ltd., 1995) and Sambrook, Fritsch and Maniatis, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1982.<br><br>
An epitope of interest is an immunologically relevant region of an antigen or immunogen or immunologically active fragment thereof, e.g., from a pathogen or toxin of veterinary or human interest.<br>
An epitope of interest can be prepared from an antigen of a pathogen or toxin, e.g., an antigen of a human pathogen or toxin, or from another antigen or toxin which elicits a response with respect to the pathogen, or from another antigen or toxin which elicits a response with respect to the pathogen, such as, for instance: a Morbillivirus antigen, e.g., a canine distemper virus or measles or rinderpest antigen such as HA or F; a rabies glycoprotein, e.g., rabies glycoprotein G; influenza antigen, e.g., influenza virus HA or N or an avian influenza antigen, e.g., turkey influenza HA, Chicken/Pennsylvania/l/83 influenza antigen such as a nudeoprotein (NP); a bovine leukemia virus antigen, e.g., gp51,30 envelope; a Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) antigen, e.g., HN or F; a feline leukemia virus antigen (FeLV), e.g., FeLV envelope protein; RAV-1 env; matrix and/or preplomer of infectious bronchitis virus; a Herpesvirus glycoprotein, e.g., a glycoprotein from feline herpesvirus, equine herpesvirus, bovine herpesvirus, pseudorabies virus, canine herpesvirus, HSV, Marek's Disease Virus, Epstein-Barr or cytomegalovirus; a flavivirus antigen, e.g., a Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) antigen, a Yellow Fever antigen, or a Dengue virus antigen; a malaria (Plasmodium)   antigen, an immunodeficiency virus antigen.<br><br>
e.g., a feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antigen or a simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) antigen or a human immunodeficiency virus antigen (HIV); a parvovirus antigen, e.g., canine parvovirus; an equine influenza antigen; an poxvirus antigen, e.g., an ectromelia antigen, a canarypox virus antigen or a fowlpox virus antigen; an infectious bursal disease virus antigen, e.g., VP2, VP3, VP4; a Hepatitis virus antigen, e.g., HBsAg; a Hantaan virus antigen; a C. tetani antigen; a mumps antigen; a pneumococcal antigen, e.g., PspA; a Borrelia  antigen, e.g., OspA, OspB, OspC of Borrelia  associated with Lyme disease such as Borrelia burgdorferi,   Borrelia afzelli  and Borrelia garinii;   or a chicken pox (varicella zoster) antigen.<br>
Of course, the foregoing list is intended as exemplary, as the epitope of interest can be derived from any antigen of any veterinary or human pathogen; and, to obtain an epitope of interest, one can express an antigen of any veterinary or human pathogen.  Nucleic acid molecules encoding epitopes of interest such as those listed can be found in the patent and scientific literature such that no undue experimentation is required to practice the claimed invention with respect to any exogenous DNA encoding at least one epitope of interest.<br>
Since the heterologous DNA can be for a growth factor or therapeutic gene, reference is made to U.S. Patent No. 5,252,479, which is incorporated herein by reference, together with the documents cited in it and on its face, and to WO<br><br>
94/16716, each of which is also incorporated herein by reference, together with the documents cited therein (see Kendrew, supra, especially at page 455 et seg.) .  The growth factor or therapeutic gene, for example, can encode a disease-fighting protein, a molecule for treating cancer, a tumor suppressor, a cytokine, a tumor associated antigen, or interferon; and, the growth factor or therapeutic gene can, for example, be selected from the group consisting of a gene encoding alpha-globin, beta-globin, gamma-globin, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, tumor necrosis factor, an interleukin, macrophage colony stimulating factor, granulocyte colony stimulating factor, erythropoietin, mast cell growth factor, tumor suppressor p53, retinoblastoma, interferon, melanoma associated antigen or B7. U.S. Patent No. 5,252,479 provides a list of proteins which can be expressed in an adenovirus system for gene therapy, and the skilled artisan is directed to that disclosure.  WO 94/16716 provide genes for cytokines and tumor associated antigens and the skilled artisan is directed to that disclosure.<br>
As to epitopes of interest, one skilled in the art can determine an epitope or immunodominant region of a peptide or polypeptide and ergo the coding DNA therefor from the knowledge of the amino acid and corresponding DNA sequences of the peptide or polypeptide, as well as from the nature of particular amino acids (e.g., size, charge, etc.) and the codon dictionary, without undue experimentation.

With respect to expression of fusion proteins by inventive vectors, reference is made to Sambrook, Fritsch, Maniatis, Molecular Cloning,   A LABORATORY MANUAL   (2d Edition, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989) (especially Volume 3), and Kendrew, supra,   incorporated herein by reference.  The teachings of Sambrook et al., can be suitably modified, without undue experimentation, from this disclosure, for the skilled<br><br>
artisan to generate recombinants or vectors expressing fusion proteins.<br>
ThuS/ one skilled in the art can create recombinants or vectors expressing a growth factor or therapeutic gene and use the recombinants or vectors, from this disclosure and the knowledge in the art, without undue experimentation.<br>
Moreover, from the foregoing and the knowledge in the art, no undue experimentation is required for the skilled artisan to construct an inventive vector which expresses an epitope of interest, a biological response modulator, a growth factor, a recognition sequence, a therapeutic gene, or a fusion protein or any protein of interest such as pro-insulin; or for the skilled artisan to use an expression product from an inventive vector.<br>
Further preferred embodiments of the invention include plasmid vectors containing a nucleic acid molecule (inserted into a restriction site) encoding pro-insulin and pro-insulin with a His tag, e.g., plasmids pPTAl and pHIS (which are akin to pLMT8.5, but contain DNA encoding pro-insulin and pro-insulin with a His tag in a restriction site; see Figs. 12 and 13).  The pro-insulin with a His tag is useful for isolation of the pro-insulin (see Example 7).<br>
The stability of the protein can be a limiting factor in the expression of its gene in E,   coli,   which is affected by many factors, including the presence or absence of proteolytic<br><br>
enzymes in the medium, as well as the sequence of the protein itself.<br>
The formation of inclusion bodies of the produced recombinant protein can facilitate protection against proteolysis.  The inclusion bodies are produced depending on the protein, and can have certain advantages if one wants to induce proteins which are insoluble or which are toxic for E. coli (Schein, 1989; Kane &amp; Hartley, 1988; Hellebust at al.,   1989), Generally, they are formed as cytoplasmatic aggregates which can be purified after lesion of the cell followed by centrifugation and mixing the proteins with a strong denaturant, e.g. urea or guanidine.<br>
With regard to the stability of the induced protein as it is affected by the protein sequence, the half-life of a protein should also be considered in relation to its amino-terminal residue, also known as N-end rule.  Tobias et al. (1991) confirm the existence of this rule in £. coli.     The residues arginine, lysine, leucine, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan at the amino terminus, tend to decrease the half-life of the protein, i.e., the half life can be on the order of two minutes, whereas other residues provide proteins having a half-life of more than ten hours for the same protein.  The amino acids arginine and leucine act as secondary destabilizing residues because their activity depends on conjugation with the primary destabilizing residues, leucine and phenylalanine, through the<br><br>
transference protein-tRNA-phenylalanine/leucine (transferase L/F).  This enzyme, which is present in Gram-negative bacteria and absent in eukaryotes, catalyzes the conjugation of leucine and phenylalanine in N-arginine ends and lysine sterically accessible in proteins or peptides.  The protease Clp(Ti), one of the two known ATP dependent proteases in E.   coli   (the other one is La), is needed for degradation in vivo  of N-end rule substrates.  Clp (750 kd) is a protein containing two subunits, ClpA (21 Kda) and ClpP (21 Kda), being comparable to the 20 S proteasomes of the eukaryotes.  Even though the mutations clpA" of E.   coli  lose the standard of the N-end rule, they grow at the rate of the wild E. coli,   showing normal phenotypes and not stablizing various short-life proteins of E. coli   (Varshavsky, 1992) .<br>
Another way to form a more stable, heterologous protein in B. coli   is by producing it as a protein that fuses with a part of native/natural protein of the bacteria.  Some of the heterologous proteins are rapidly degenerated by the protease of the host and genetic fusion stabilizes the produced protein within the cell, also providing a strategy for later purification (Sherwood, 1991).  One example of this method is the addition of a region, rich in arginine at the carboxyl-end of urogastrone, that aids in the protection against proteolysis and in the purification of the protein in an ion-exchange column (Smith at al., 1984).<br><br>
The present invention provides an alternative method for the development of stable, isolatable, heterologous proteins, which method overcomes the above-identified problems associated with the stability of the induced protein.<br>
The present invention provides a method to improve the expression of the heterologous proteins, by employing a vector for expression, the plasmid pLMTS.5 and derivatives thereof, e.g., pPTAl and pHIS, which are strong enough to result in a rate of protein production higher than the degradation rate.<br>
The present invention provides a process for constructing a vector for expression of heterologous proteins, preferably low molecular weight proteins, e.g., less than 10 Kda, in E.   coll.<br>
The present invention provides a highly efficient process for thermo-regulated production of heterologous proteins in E.   coli  and in other Gram-negative bacteria, preferably for the production of human pro-insulin.<br>
The method of the present invention for thermo-regulated highly efficient production of heterologous proteins in E. coli  and other Gram-negative bacteria, includes thermal induction of a culture of bacteria containing the plasmid pLMT8.5 and the gene for cloning, in which the plasmid pLMT8.5 is prepared according to the process described herein and the cloning is achieved without genetic fusion.  In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the heterologous protein is human pro-insulin from the synthetic gene for pro-insulin.<br>
Recombinant E.   coli  cells almost always express the heterologous protein in the form of insoluble cytoplasmic inclusion bodies.  In other words, the recombinant protein is not excreted into the culture media.  An additional characteristic of recombinant E,   coli  is the accumulation of high amounts of acetate in the media, mainly during the induction phase.  The deleterious effect of acetate accumulation (&gt;5g/L) on cell growth and recombinant protein expression is well documented in the literature.<br>
Additionally, with regard to the accumulation of high concentrations of acetate in the media, which is a general consequence of working with E. coli,   the present invention facilitates the development of fermentation conditions, wherein both high biomass accumulation (&gt;70 g/dry weight/L) and maintenance of low acetate concentration (
With regard to the method outlined herein for the purification of protein isolated from inclusion bodies, it will be understood that minor modifications in the purification protocol may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention, i.e., specifically in regard to the choice of solvents, buffers, detergents, denaturants, proteolytic enzymes,<br><br>
separation methods and chromatographic media.  It will be understood from the disclosure that while the preferred detergent for use in the method of the present invention is Triton X-100, one of ordinary skill in the art may employ any such nonionic detergent in practicing the instant invention.  Similarly, with regard to the choice of proteolytic enzymes, while trypsin and carboxypeptidase B are preferred, one may substitute any appropriate proteolytic enzyme, e.g., the substitution of Endoproteinase Lys-C for trypsin, in order to convert pro-insulin to insulin, and such a substitution is well within the gambit of knowledge of the skilled artisan acquainted with available proteolytic enzyme preparations and their respective specificities.<br>
A better understanding of the present invention and of its many advantages will be had from the following non-limiting Examples, given by way of illustration,<br>
EXAMPLES Example 1 - Vector Preparation<br>
The inventive process for the construction of a vector for use in thermo-regulated production of heterologous proteins in E coli,   and the construction of an inventive vector of the invention was comprised of the following stages:<br>
i. Construction of plasmid pULTDK7.1 (Figure 1)<br>
The construction of pULTDKV.1 was initiated by the isolation of the fragment containing the promoter P^ of the phage<br><br>
lambda.  This fragment extends from the hindlll site to the Hpal site of the phage and was cloned into the Hindlll and Smal  sites of the polylinker of pUC19, forming the recombinant plasmid pUCPL2.7.  Oligonucleotides 011929 and 011930, which contain the Shine-Dalgarno region of the gene 10 of the phage T7, were annealed and ligated to the EcoRI site of pUCPL2.7, forming plasmid pULT7.2.4.  Plasmid pULT7.2.4 was cleaved at the BspEI and Xbal sites, treated with DNA polymerase I fragment Klenow and relegated, resulting in a deletion of the coding region of the gene N of the phage lambda and formation of plasmid pULTDK7.1.<br>

'* ii. Construction of Plasmid pUTC6 (Figure 2)<br>
The construction of pUTC6 began by the isolation of the gene for resistance to tetracycline (Tc), by means of digestion of the plasmid pRP4 with Bg-III and StuI, which liberated a fragment of 1.4 kb, which was cloned in the BanUl and Smal   sites of plasmid pUC8, forming plasmid pUTl.  A 0.9 kb pUC8 fragment was liberated by digestion with Dral  and PvuII and ligated to pUTl after digestion with PstI, treatment with SI nuclease, digested with BcoRI and treated with Klenow, to obtain<br><br>
the plasmid pUTC6, which maintains the site .BcoRI and contains the origin of replication and the gene for resistance to Tc. iii. Construction of Plasmid pLMCS,1 (Figure 3) Annealed oligonucleotides 1 and 2 were ligated to the EcoRI site of pUTC6 to form the plasmid pMC8, containing a region of restriction sites for molecular cloning. Subsequently, pULTDKV.1 was liberated by digestion with the Hindlll and BcoRI and ligated to pMC8, also digested with HindiII and EcoRI, to yield the recombinant plasmid pLMCS.l, containing the gene for resistance to Tc, the origin of replication, the promoter PL/ the Shine-Dalgarno region and a polylinker for molecular cloning.<br>
iv.  Construction of Plasmid pLMTS.5 (Figure 4) An efficient transcription-terminator was inserted from oligonucleotides 12 and 13 which were annealed and ligated to the JBamHI site of the plasmid pLMCS.l, preserving the site at the 5' end of the oligonucleotides and creating a Hindlll site at the 3' end, yielding the expression vector pLMT8-5 for E. coli  and other gram-negative bacteria.<br><br>

Hence, pLMT8.5, prepared according to the method<br>
described hereinabove, contains:  (1) origin of replication of<br>
pUC8; (2) the gene for resistance to tetracycline of pRP4; (3)<br>
the promoter Pi of the Lambda phage; (4) the SD-region of the<br>
gene 10 of the phage T7; (5) multiple cloning sites for cloning<br>
without fusion; and (6) Rho-independent terminator of<br>
transcription (See Figs. 1-5, lOA-M, llA-F).<br>
To obtain a vector expressing pro-insulin, coding DNA<br>
therefor was inserted into a restriction site of the multiple<br>
cloning sites of vector plasmid pLMTB.5.  In particular, the<br>
synthetic gene for proinsulin was cloned on a polylinker<br>
yielding vector plasmid pPTAl (pLMTB.5 + proinsulin).  The<br>
vector was then inserted into E.   coli  and cultures thereof were<br><br>
grown for expression of pro-insulin (e.g., N4830-1 (cl®^"^) strains-see Examples below),<br>
V.   Construction of plasmids pLA7 and pHIS A fragment from pLA7 containing the pro-insulin sequence and a histidine tag was inserted into the restriction site of the multiple cloning sites of vector plasmid pLMT8.5 yielding vector plasmid pHIS.  The cloning strategy is depicted in Figures 12 and 13.  The vector was then inserted into E.   coli and cultures thereof were grown for expression of pro-insulin (e.g., N4830-1 (cl^^*^) strain; see Examples below).  pHIS contains the pro-insulin gene with the oligo encoding a (HIS)6 insertion (Met-Ala-His-His-His-His-His-His-Met-Gly-Arg).<br>
(The synthetic gene for proinsulin, constructed by inventors, using oligonucleotides was, cloned into the Ncol  and BaniRl  sites in the polylinker region of pLMT8.5 vector to make the pPTAl and pHIS proinsulin expression vector, see Example 8.) Example 2 - High Biomass Formation with Low Acetate Accmnulation<br>
Experimental results showed that programmed additions of yeast extract were necessary for high biomass formation.  To maintain the acetate concentration at low levels, the pH of the fermentation was controlled automatically via a glucose loop. Under these conditions not only could the pH be controlled at any desirable value (e.g. 6.8 or lower), but also the glucose level in the fermentation broth could be maintained at very low<br><br>
levels (
accumulation of acetate.<br>
' Under these conditions dry cell weights of up to 95g/L<br>
and expression of 194mg of fusion protein per gram of dry cell<br>
weight were obtained.<br>
Example 3 -    Permeabilizatlon and Solubilization o£ Inclusion<br>
Bodies Containing Pro-Insulin	<br>
As a rule, inclusion bodies are recovered from the host organism by two procedures: (a) Mechanical or physical rupture of the cell envelope by passing the cell paste through a Manton-Gaulin press or by grinding the cell suspension in a colloidal mill such as a Dyno-Mill; and (b) Digestion of the cell envelope by treatment with lysozyme.  However, both of the above-identified techniques are costly, and potentially detrimental to the overall yield of the desired protein.<br>
Hence, the method of the present invention employs alternative methods for the purification and direct solubilization of inclusion bodies.<br>
E.   coli  cells (K-12 strain N 4830-1 containing the pro-insulin gene under the control of the PL promoter; plasmids pPTAl and pHIS, see Example 1) were grown in 10 liters of medium containing yeast extract (20 g/L), peptone (6.0 g/L), NaCl (5.0 g/L), glucose (10.0 g/L), Antifoam A (2.0 g/L), and ampicillin (100 ug/ml), pH 6.8 (after sterilization).  The medium was inoculated at 10% volume with a pre-culture prepared from an<br><br>
isolated colony grown overnight in the same medium.  At an optical density of approximately 6.0 at 540 nm, synthesis of pro-insulin was induced by raising the temperature from 30 to 38°C.  Induction could also be initiated at temperatures of 40 to 42°C.  Cells were harvested after 2 to 5 hours of induction. Inclusion body formation was monitored by phase contrast microscopy.<br>
The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended twice in deionized water, and recovered by centrifugation.  Known amounts of wet cell cake were resuspended in 0.IM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.5, and appropriate amounts of permeabilization compounds, alone, or in combination, were added to a concentration of up to ten times the volume of the weight of the wet cell cake, as shown in Table 1.  After overnight agitation at room temperature, the cells were recovered by centrifugation, wet weight of the cell cakes and the wet pellet were homogenized in 10 times their weight of 0.IM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.5 containing 8M urea, and agitation was continued at room temperature for up to 24 hours.  Supernatants were recovered by centrifugation, and cell pellets were washed by centrifugation. Fusion protein concentrations were determined by SDS-PAGE analysis using both the supernatant and pellets after the washing step.  Weight determinations made on the wet pellets prior to the pretreatment step, after pretreatment, and after 8M<br><br>
urea treatment showed that a substantial weight loss took place, as shown in Table 1.<br>

Example 4 -<br><br>
Concomitant Perzneabilization and Solubilization<br>
of Inclusion Bodies Containing Pro-Insulin	<br><br>
In preliminary experiments, the pre-treated cells were cleaned of the cytoplasmic proteins and other contaminating material extracted from the cells (grown as in Example 3), by centrifugation, followed by resuspension of the pre-treated and washed cells in buffer containing 8M urea.<br>
One liter aliquots of a fermentation broth, prepared as in Example 3, were concentrated to 100 ml by cross flow<br><br>
filtration.  Aliquots of the concentrated cell suspension were<br>
diafiltered with 10 volumes of 0.IM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.5 buffer<br>
containing either 5 Mm EDTA, 1% toluene, or deionized water.<br>
Solid urea was added to a final concentration of 8M, and the<br>
volume was brought to 2 0 0ml with buffer.  Samples taken at<br>
different time intervals, up to 24 hours, were analyzed by SDS-<br>
PAGE.  A highly effective purification and solubilization of the<br>
inclusion bodies was obtained in as little as 6 hours of urea<br>
treatment, as shown in Figure 6.<br>
Example 5 -    Cell permeabilization procedure<br>
using 20% Triton X-100	<br>
Cell cultures grown as in Example 4 were harvested by<br>
centrifugation, resuspended twice in deionized water and<br>
recovered by centrifugation.  Known amounts of the wet cell cake<br>
were resuspended in 0.IM Tris-Hcl, pH 8.5, containing 20% Triton<br>
X-100, and the solutions were agitated overnight at room<br>
temperature.  Fusion protein concentrations were determined by<br>
SDS-PAGE analysis, and it was found that under these conditions,<br>
a substantial amount of cytoplasmic material diffuses out of the<br>
cell, leaving an empty shell containing essentially the inclusion<br>
body with few contaminating cellular proteins.<br>
Example 6 -   Purification and Concentration of the Solubilized<br>
Inclusion Bodies by pH Precipitation	<br>
Cell cultures are grown and pre-treated, and the<br>
inclusion bodies solubilized as in Examples 3 or 4.  The solution<br>
of solubilized inclusion bodies was dialyzed, or ultrafiltered,<br><br>
eliminate urea.  A fractional pH precipitation step resulted the enhanced purity of the solubilized protein.  The pH of the<br>
to eliminate urea.  A fractional pH precipitation step resulted in<br>
protein solution was lowered, either by the addition of mineral acids, i.e., hydrochloride or sulfuric acids, or by organic acids, i.e., acetic acid.  The pH was lowered to 6.0 by this method, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation.  The fusion protein was precipitated from the solution by lowering the pH to 5.0 by the same method.  A complete recovery of the fusion protein was achieved.  The precipitated fusion protein was dissolved in alkaline buffer at pH 8.5.  The purification of protein by fractional pH precipitation is shown in Figure 7. Example 7 -    Purification and Isolation of Insulin<br>
The isolated inclusion bodies or whole pre-treated cells from cells containing and expressing plasmid pHIS were washed twice with 50 Mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.0 and centrifuged.  The precipitate was dissolved in 5 0 Mm ammonium acetate buffer, pH 9.0, containing 8M urea, and sodium sulphite (1.25 g/g of sample) and sodium tetrathioate (0.55 g/g of sample) were added-  The sample was stirred, at room temperature.  The sulfitolysis reaction was monitored by analysis of aliquots on a Mono-Q column.  After 24 to 48 hours, the sample was diluted 3 times with deionized water, centrifuged, and the supernatant was filtered to give a clear solution.<br>
The filtered supernatant was applied to a Ni-chelating sepharose FF column (Pharmacia Biotech, Upsala Sweden),<br><br>
equilibrated with O.IM sodium phosphate, 50mM NaCl, pH 7.3,  The sample was eluted in a stepwise gradient, with the equilibration buffer containing 8M urea and 0.08M imidazole, followed by-washing with the equilibration buffer containing 8M urea and 0.3M imidazole.  The chromatographic separation was monitored by absorbance measurement at 280 nm.  The buffer of the solution containing pure S-sulfonated protein isolated by metal affinity chromatography was changed to 10 Mm glycine, pH 10.0, by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-25.<br>
The pure sulfonated protein was renatured (0.5mg protein/ml) by the addition of 0.5mM cystine and 0.5mM beta-mercaptoethanol, with agitation for 18 to 24 hours at 4 to 8oC, and the reaction was monitored by injection of aliquots of the reaction mixture on  HPLC equipped with an Aquapore RP-300 column. The renatured samples were concentrated and the buffer was changed by diafiltration.<br>
To 1.0 ml of renatured sample (8 mg/ml) in O.IM Tris-Hcl, pH 7.5, containing O.OIM EDTA, was added 35 ug of trypsin and 0.6ug of carboxypeptidase B.  The reaction was monitored by HPLC analysis on an Aquapore RP-3 00 column, and the reaction was complete after 1 hour at 37oc.  The reaction mixture was diluted 3 times with water, and purified by ion-exchange chromatography and reversed-phase HPLC.<br><br>
Example 8 - Test of Efficiency of the Vector of Expression<br>
A synthetic gene for proinsulin, constructed by inventors, using oligonucleotides was cloned into the i\^coI and BarnRl  sites in the polylinker region of pLMT8.5 vector to make the pPTAl and pHIS proinsulin expression vectors (see Example 1). In tests it was found that, after thermal induction of a culture of E.   coli  N4830-1 (cl®^^) strain, containing the plasmid pPTAl (pLMT8.5 + proinsulin), there was induction of the recombinant protein of approximately 10 Kda, in a fraction of 20% of the total proteins of the bacteria over a period of 90 minutes, and that it loses the capacity to multiply during the thermal shock, leaving it only to the production of the recombinant protein, as shown in Figure 4. The plasmid pPLT4 was also used in this test. This plasmid is a derivative of the plasmid pPLc28 (Remaut et al., 1981), modified by inventors, in which the same synthetic Shine Dalgarno site and the proinsulin gene of the plasmids pLMT8.5 and pPTAl were cloned.  By comparison with this plasmid, showing an induction of the protein of 11% and cell-growth during the thermal shock, it was found that, over a period of 90 minutes, pLMTS.5 was 100% more efficient (See Fig, 9).<br>
In this manner a hyper-expression-vector for E.   coli, denoted pLMT8.5, was obtained.  When tested on the production of human proinsulin from the synthetic gene, high levels of protein expression were found to be induced from this gene.<br><br>
Plasmids pLMTS.B, pPLT4, pHIS, and pPTAl were deposited on June 24, 1997 with the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), 12301 Parklawn Drive, Rockville, Maryland, 20852, USA, under ATCC accession numbers 98474, 98475, 98476 and 98473. Example 9 - Additional Expression Vectors<br>
A gene for any of: an epitope of interest, a biological response modulator, a growth factor, a recognition sequence, a therapeutic gene, a fusion protein or another protein of interest or combinations thereof (as discussed in the Detailed Description) cloned on a polylinker and inserted into plasmid of Example 1, e.g., pLMT8.5, pHlS, and pPTAl; and, plasmids resulting therefrom are inserted into E. coli,   e.g., N4830-1 (cl857) strain (containing the plasmid pLMT8.5 + gene).  After thermal induction there is induction of the recombinant protein akin to that observed in Example 8 showing that pLMT8.5 is extremely efficient.<br>
In this manner a hyper-expression-vector for E.   coli, denoted pLMT8.5, is obtained.  When tested on the production of human proinsulin from the synthetic gene, high levels of protein expression were found to be induced from this gene; and, high levels of expression are obtainable from using vector plasmid pLMT8.5 and other exogenous genes.  As discussed herein, the selection marker can be omitted from pLMTS.5 or derivatives thereof, e.g., pHIS, and pPTAl, and selection can be based on expression of a gene product, e.g., of insulin or of insulin with<br><br>
a His tag.  Methods for selection based on expression of an<br>
exogenous coding sequence are known in the art and can include<br>
immunoprecipitation or other antibody-based screening methods<br>
which employ antibodies which bind to the expression product, or<br>
selective media with respect to the expression product (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 4,769,330, 4,603,112, 5,110,587 regarding<br>
selection using selective media with respect to an expression<br>
product; U.S. Patent No. 5,494,807 regarding selection using<br>
antibody-based screening methods).<br>
Example 10 -   Manipulation of fermentation conditions to enhance<br>
protein expression	<br>
Productivity of the fermenter could be increased substantially (
Thus, alternating 5 hours of fermentation at 30oc with 5 hours of induction at 42oc, resulted in a higher percentage of recombinant protein expression than when starting the induction after prolonged fermentation (approximately 17 hours) at 30oC.<br>
Heat inactivation was found to negatively influence the inclusion body purification steps due to considerable coagulation<br><br>
of cytoplasmic proteins, at the heat inactivation temperature (80oC).<br>
Cell inactivation and permeabilization was performed concomitantly by overnight treatment of the harvested cells with 1% Toluene and 50 Mm EDTA.  Further purification was achieved by resuspending the recovered biomass in Tris O.IM, pH 8.5 buffer, containing 1.0% Triton X-100, and agitating for five hours or overnight.  Cells pre-treated in this manner, after centrifugation, can be used directly in the ensuing purification steps.<br>
Additionally, by further lysozyme treatment, a suspension of isolated inclusion bodies can be obtained which can be separated from the cell debris by centrifugation, in a highly purified state.<br>
Having thus described in detail preferred embodiments of the present invention, it is to be understood that the invention defined by the appended claims is not to be limited to particular details set forth in the above description as many apparent variations thereof are possible without departing from the spirit or scope of the present invention.<br><br><br>
