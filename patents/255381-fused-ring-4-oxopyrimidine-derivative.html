FUSED-RING 4-OXOPYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVE TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to fused ring 4-oxopyrimidine derivatives. BACKGROUD ART<br>
In living creatures including mammals, histamine, an endogenous factor with<br>
physiological activity, functions as a neurotransmitter and has far-reaching pharmacological effects (e.g., Life science, Vol. 17, p. 503 (1975)).<br>
From immunohistochemical research, it has become clear that histaminergic (production) soma are present in the tubercle mammillary nuclei of the posterior hypothalmic region, and histaminergic nerve fibers extend over a very large area within the brain, which suggests that histamine has many different pharmacological actions (e.g., Journal of Comprehensive Neurology, Vol. 273, p. 283).<br>
The presence of a histaminergic nerve in the tubercle mammillary nuclei of the posterior hypothalamic region suggests that histamine plays a particularly important role in cerebral function in controlling the physiology of the hypothalmus, i.e., in waking rhythms, internal secretions, food/water intake and sexual behavior (e.g., Progress in Neurobiology, Vol. 63, p. 637 (2001)).<br>
The fact that there are projections of histaminergic nerve fibers to regions of the brain related to maintenance of the waking state (e.g., the cerebral cortex) suggests that histamine has a role in maintaining the waking state or the waking-sleep cycle. Also, the fact that there are projections of histaminergic nerve fibers to many peripheral structures such as the hippocampus or tonsil-like complex suggest that it has a role in regulating the autonomic nervous system and emotions, control of motivation, learning and memory.<br>
After histamine is released from cells producing histamine, it interacts with specific polymers called receptors on the cell membrane surface or in target cells, which account for its pharmacological effects and regulation of body functions. Four types of histamine receptors have so far been discovered. Histamine H3 receptors have been shown by various pharmacological and physiological studies to participate in the function of central and peripheral nerves (e.g., Trends in Pharmacological Science, Vol. 8, p. 24 (1986)), and in recent years, man and rodent histamine H3 receptor genes have been identified (e.g., Molecular Pharmacology, Vol. 55, p. 1101 (1999)).<br>
It has been shown that histamine H3 receptors are present in the center or the presynaptic membrane of peripheral nerve cells, functioning as autoreceptors, controlling the release of histamine and also controlling the release of other neurotransmitters. Specifically, it has been reported that histamine H3 receptor agonists, antagonists or inverse-agonists regulate the release of histamine, noradrenalm, serotonine, acetylcholine or dopamme from synaptic endings. For example, release of neurotransmitters such as (R)-(a)-methylhistamine is suppressed by agonists, and is promoted by<br>
antagonists or inverse-agonists like thioperamide (e.g., Trends in Pharmacological Science, Vol. 19, p.<br>
177(1998)).<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel substances which have histamine H3 receptor antagonism (action of inhibiting the binding of histamine to histamine H3 receptors) or inverse agonism (action of suppressing the constant activity of histamine H3 receptors), i.e. novel substances which act as histamine H3 receptor antagonists or inverse-agonists in living body.<br>
The inventors discovered that specific fused ring 4-oxopyrimidine derivatives act as histamine H3 receptor antagonists or inverse-agonists, and on the basis of the discoveries, they arrived at the present invention.<br>

The compound or salt according to any one of (1) to (45) acts as a histamine H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist. In other words, the present invention also provides a histamine H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist consisting of the compound according to any one of (1) to (45), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
According to the most recent research, histamine H3 receptors are very active in receptor cells and tissues, or the membrane fractions derived from receptor cells and tissues, and in the living body, they are constantly active (endogenous factors, e.g., the activity observed when histamine is absent) (e.g., Nature, Vol.408, p.860). It has been reported that this constant activity is suppressed by inverse-agonists. For example, constant autoreceptor activity is suppressed by thioperamide or ciproxifan and, as a result, release of neurotransmitters from synaptic endings, e.g., release and separation of histamine, is promoted.<br>
In the rat, from the fact that a high-level selective inhibitor of histamine synthetic enzyme (histidine decarboxylase) interferes with waking, it was shown that histamine functions to regulate motivated waking. In the cat, administration of (R)-(a)-methylhistamine which is a histamine H3 receptor agonist increases deep slow wave sleep (e.g., Brain Research, Vol.523, p.325 (1990)).<br>
On the other hand, thioperamide which is a histamine H3 receptor antagonist or inverse-agonist increases wakefulness in a dose-dependent manner. Also, thioperamide decreases slow wave and REM sleep (e.g., Life Science, Vol.48, p.2397 (1991)). In addition, thioperamide or GT-2331, which is a histamine H3 antagonist or inverse agonist, decreases emotive cataplexy and sleep in the narcolepsy dog (e.g., Brain Research, Vol.793, p.279 (1998)).<br>
These findings suggest that H3 receptors participates in waking-sleep adjustment and sleep disorders, and suggest that selective histamine H3 agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful for prevention or treatment of sleep disorders and conditions accompanied by sleep disorders (e.g., idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia, genuine hypersomnia, narcolepsy, periodic limb motor deficits at sleep time, sleep apnea syndrome, circadian rhythm barrier, chronic fatigue syndrome, REM sleep disorder, sleeplessness in the elderly, lack of sleep in night shift workers, idiopathic insomnia, repeatability insomnia, inborn character insomnia, depression and integration dysfunction syndrome).<br>
Therefore, the compound or salt according to any one of (1) to (45) which acts as a histamine H3 receptor antagonist or inverse agonist is presumably useful in the prophylaxis or therapy of sleep disorders, and conditions accompanied by sleep disorders.<br>
In the rat, administration of thioperamide or GT-2331, which is histamine H3 antagonists or an inverse agonist, improves learning disability (LD) attention defecit hyperkinesia disorder (ADHD) (e.g., Life Science, Vol.69, p.469 (2001)). In the rat, administration of (R)-(a)-methylhistamine, which is a histamine H3 receptor agonist, decreases recognition ability and learning in an object recognition test and passive obstacle test.<br>
On the other hand, thioperamide, which is a histamine H3 antagonist or inverse agonist, improves poor memory induced by the drug scopolamine in an amnesia induction test in a dose-dependent manner (e.g., Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, Vol.68, p.735 (2001)).<br>
These findings suggest that histamine H3 receptor antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful in the prevention and therapy of memory/learning disability and diseases accompanied by<br>
memory/learning disability, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease or attention defect/ hyperkinesia disorder.<br>
Therefore, the compound or salt according to any one of (1) to (45) is presumably useful in the prophylaxis or therapy of memory/learning disability and diseases accompanied by memory/learning disability<br>
In the rat, mtraventricular administration of histamine suppresses feeding behavior, which suggests that histamine participates in feeding behavior adjustment (e.g., Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology Vol.49, p. 191 (1998)). Actually, thioperamide, which is a histamine 113 antagonist or inverse agonist, suppresses feeding behavior in a dose-dependent manner, and also promotes release of mtracerebral histamine (e.g., Behavioral Brain Research, Vol.104, p.147 (1999)).<br>
These findings suggests that histamine H3 receptors participates in feeding behavior adjustment, and that histamine H3 antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful for prevention or treatment of metabolic diseases such as eating disorder, obesity, diabetes mellitus, emaciation and hyperlipemia.<br>
Therefore, the compound or salt according to any one of (1) to (45) is presumably useful in the prophylaxis or therapy of such metabolic diseases.<br>
In the rat, administration of (R)-(a)-methylhistamine, which is a histamine H3 receptor agonist, decreases basics diastolic pressure in a dose-dependent manner. These effects are antagonized by thioperamide, which is a histamine H3 antagonist or inverse agonist (e.g., European Journal of Pharmacology, Vol.234, p. 129 (1993)).<br>
These findings suggest that histamine H3 receptors participate in adjustment of blood pressure, heartbeat and cardiovascular output, and that histamine H3 receptor agonists, antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful in prevention or therapy of circulatory diseases such as hypertension and various heart troubles.<br>
Therefore, the compound or salt according to any one of (1) to (45) is presumably useful in the prophylaxis or therapy of such circulatory diseases.<br>
In the mouse, thioperamide, which is a histamine H3 antagonist or inverse agonist, suppressed convulsion uided induced by electric shock stimuli or epileptoid strokes induced by pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in a dose-dependent manner, (e.g., European Journal of Pharmacology, Vol.234, p. 129 (1993), and Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Behavior, Vol.68, p.735 (2001)).<br>
These findings suggest that histamine H3 antagonists or inverse agonists may be useful lor the prevention or treatment of epilepsy or central convulsions.<br>
Therefore, the compound or salt according to any one of (1) to (45) is presumably useful in the prophylaxis or therapy of such epilepsy or central convulsions.<br>
In other words, the present invention further provides a prophylactic or therapeutic agent for a metabolic disease, a circulatory disease or a nervous system disease containing as an active<br>

A cDNA sequence [International Patent Publication WOOO/39164 Specification] which encodes human histamine H3 receptor was cloned using the expression vectors pCR2.1, pEFlx (product of Invitrogen), and pCI-nco (product of Promega Inc.). The expression vector obtained was transfected to the host cells, HHK293 and CHO-K1 (American type culture collection), using the cationic lipid method [Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol.84, p.7413 (1987), and histamine H3 receptor expression cells were thus obtained.<br>
A membrane preparation made from the cells which represented the histamine H3 receptor, the test compound (the compound of Exaple 1) and 20,000cpm of [3H]N-a-methylhistamine (product of NEN) were incubated in an assay buffer solution (50mM Tris buffer solution, pH 7.4) at 25°C for 2 hours, and filtered on a glass filter GF/C. After washing by 50mM Tris buffer solution, pH7.4, the radioactivity on the glass filter was found. Non-specific linkages were measured in the presence of lOmicroM thioperamide (product of SIGAM), and the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50 value) of the test compound with respect to specific N-a-methylhistamine linkages was found (Molecular Pharmacology, Vol.55, p. 1101 (1999)). As a result, the IC50 value of the test compound was 15nM. As described above, the compound of Exaple 1 strongly prevented binding of N-o methylhistamine to the histamine H3 receptor (histamine analog).<br>

Under ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia (74mg/kg and 11 mg/kg intraperitoneal single-dose administration), a chronic guide cannula (26 gauge, length 11mm) was inserted in the ventnculus tertius of a male SD rat (7-10 weeks old, 200-300g) using a brain stereotaxis apparatus, and fixed by dental resin. The position of the tip of the guide cannula was 2.2mm back from the bregma, and at a depth of 8 mm from the skull surface on the median line. After about 1 week convalescence, R-omethylhistamine (0.3/ig/l/^L/hcad, 30% propylene glycol solution) was administered to the ventriculus tertius. The test compound (the compound of Exaple 1) suspended in 0.5% methylcellulose aqueous solution was administered orally 2 hours before the R-a-methylhistamine administration, and the drinking water amount was measured 1 hour after R-cv-methylhistamine administration. As a result, the test compound<br>
(lOmg/kg) significantly suppressed the increase in drinking water amount due to R-a-methylhistamine administered to the ventriculus tertius. (Pharmacological test example 3: in vivo kinetic test)<br>
The test compound (the compound of Exaple 1) was administered orally or intravenously to SD type male rats (7-10 weeks old, 200-400g) which had abstained from food overnight, and about 100/iL of blood was collected from a caudal vein using a hepannized capillary tube at a predetermined time. The blood was centnfuged (4°C, 6000rpm, 10 minutes), and plasma was obtained. Three times the amount of ethanol (containing an internal reference) was added to the plasma, stirred, left for 20 minutes at -2()°r, and centrifuged (4°C, 10,000rpm, 10 minutes). The supernatant liquid was analyzed by l.C/MS/MS, and the plasma concentration was measured by the relative calibration curve method. As a result, the test compound had 60% bioavailability, and a half-life of 6.3 hours in blood. (Pharmacological test example 4: brain/cerebrospmal fluid activity test)<br>
The test compound (the compound of Exaple 1) was administered orally or intravenously to SD type male rats (7-10 weeks old, 200-400g), and exsanguination was performed from the abdominal aorta under ether anesthesia using a hepann treatment syringe at a predetermined time. The skin at the back of the head was cut open, pierced with a 30G dental needle between the cervical vertebrae, and inserted into the subarachnoid space. 50-100/iL of cerebrospinal fluid was extracted by a ImL syringe via a tube connected to the 30G needle, and the brain was extracted. A blood sample was centnfuged (4°C, 6000rpm, 10 minutes), and three times the amount of ethanol (containing an internal reference) was added to the plasma and stirred. 2mL of water was added to a brain sample, homogenized, a part was removed, and three times the amount of ethanol (containing an internal reference) was added and stirred. The cerebrospinal fluid was taken, three times the amount of ethanol (containing an internal reference) was added, and stirred. The above sample was left at -20°C for 20 minutes, centrifuged (4°C, 12,000g, 10 minutes), the supernatant liquid was analyzed by LC/MS/MS, and the concentration in plasma, brain and cerebrospinal fluid was measured by the relative calibration curve method. As a result, the test compound had an intracerebral concentration of 3.16nmol/g, cerebrospinal fluid concentration of 0.142/uM, and plasma concentration of 2.32^iM at 2 hours after oral administration (lOmg/kg).
