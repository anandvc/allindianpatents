				<td>1,4-HYDROGENATION OF DIENES WITH RU COMPLEXES<br>
Technical field<br>
The present invention relates to the field of catalytic hydrogenation and, more<br>
particularly to the use of specific Ru complexes with cyclopentadienyl derivatives, as one<br>
of the ligands, in 1,4-hydrogenation processes for the reduction of dienes into the<br>
corresponding "cis "-alkene as major product, i.e. wherein the two substituents in position<br>
2,3 of the diene are in a cis configuration in the corresponding alkene.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Selective 1,4-hydrogenation of conjugated dienes into their corresponding "cis"-<br>
alkene is a very interesting reaction in organic chemistry, since it renders accessible a<br>
number of compounds which are obtained in general with a poor selectivity.<br>
One of the mandatory and characterizing elements of such processes is the catalyst<br>
or the catalytic system. The development of useful catalysts or catalytic systems for the<br>
1,4-hydrogenation of diene into the corresponding "cis "-alkene is still an important,<br>
difficult and unpredictable task in chemistry, in particular because the chemical industry<br>
is always eager for higher selectivity, as well as to maintain a high conversion or yield.<br>
From the prior art, it is known that sorbic acid can be hydrogenated into the<br>
corresponding "cis "-alkene in the presence of [(Cp*)RuCO(phosphine)](anion) or<br>
[(Cp*)RuCO(sorbic acid)](anion) complexes, (see Driessen et al, in Chem.Commun.,<br>
2000, 217 or in J.Organomet.Chem, 1998, 141), however the yields (conversions x<br>
selectivity) are quite low.<br>
Furthermore, in EP 1394170, it is reported the cisoid hydrogenation of dienes<br>
using as catalytic systems the complex [(Dienyl)Ru(acyclic diene)](anion) (in particular<br>
[(Cp*)Ru(sorbic acid)](anion) or [(Cp*)Ru(sorbol)](anion). In this document it is<br>
expressively shown that the use of cyclic diene, instead of acyclic diene, is highly<br>
detrimental to the overall yield. The only conditions displayed as providing good yields<br>
require nitromethane as solvent, the latter being relatively toxic and hazardous for<br>
industrial applications. Finally, Table 4 of said document shows that the addition of Lewis<br>
acids is highly detrimental to the yields.<br>
Therefore, there is a need for processes using alternative catalytic systems<br>
possibly providing high selectivity and/or conversions.<br><br>
Description of the invention<br>
In order to overcome the problems aforementioned, the present invention relates to<br>
processes for the catalytic reduction by 1,4-hydrogenation, using molecular H2, of a<br>
conjugated diene (I) into the corresponding "cis "-alkene (II), characterized in that said<br>
process is carried out in the presence of at least an acidic additive of the type specified<br>
further below, the catalyst or pre-catalyst being a ruthenium complex comprising as<br>
ligand a cyclopentadienyl derivative.<br>
The invention's process is shown in Scheme 1:<br>
Scheme 1<br><br>
wherein the R1 to R6 are the substituents of the diene and of the alkene and wherein in<br>
compound (II) the R1 and R2 groups are in a cis configuration.<br>
A particular embodiment of the invention is a process for the catalytic reduction<br>
by 1,4-hydrogenation, using molecular H2, of a C5-C22 conjugated diene of formula<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 represent, simultaneously or independently from<br>
each other, a hydrogen atom or a C1-C12 alkyl or alkenyl group optionally substituted;<br>
one of R2 or R6 may also represent a C1-C12 alkoxy or acyloxy group optionally<br>
substituted; and<br>
R1 and R3, or R3 and R4, or R2 and R6, or R6 and R5, or R4 and R5, taken together,<br>
may form a C2-16 alkanediyl or de-conjugated alkenediyl group, optionally<br>
substituted;<br>
into the corresponding alkene, of formula<br><br>
  )<br>
wherein R1 to R6 have the same meaning as for the compound of formula (I), and<br>
wherein the isomer having the R1 and R2 groups in a cis configuration is predominant<br>
(i.e. the "cis "-alkene);<br>
said process being characterized in that it is carried out in the presence of<br>
-	at least one ruthenium catalyst or pre-catalyst of formula<br><br>
wherein L represents a C5-C25 derivative of cyclopentadienyl ligand (Cp), Diene<br>
represents a C4-C22 diene and X represents a non coordinated anion, n represent 2, 1<br>
or 0 and L' represents a solvent; and<br>
-	at least an acidic additive of the type described further below, preferably in a total<br>
amount of about 0.1, or even 0.2, to 100 molar equivalents, relative to the<br>
compound (III).<br>
Possible substituents of R1 to R6, when taken alone or together, are one or two<br>
groups which do no stop the reduction of the substrate by the catalyst. Non-limiting<br>
typical examples of such substituents are OR7, COR7, OCOR7 or COOR8, R7 representing<br>
a hydrogen atom or a C1-C12 alkyl or alkenyl group, if one of the R1 to R6 is substituted<br>
with two geminal OR7 groups, said two R7 can be bound together to form a C2-C4<br>
alkanediyl group, R8 representing a C1-C12 alkyl or alkenyl group.<br>
According to a particular embodiment of the invention, possible substituents of R1<br>
to R6, when taken alone or together, are OR7, OCOR7 or COOR8, R7 representing a<br>
hydrogen atom or a C1-C6 alkyl or alkenyl group, if one of the R1 to R6 is substituted with<br>
two geminal OR7 groups, said two R7 can be bound together to form a C2-C4 alkanediyl<br>
group, R8 representing a C1-C6 alkyl or alkenyl group. Said R7 or R8 can even be C1-C6<br>
alkyl group.<br>
When any of R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 or R6 represent an alkenyl group, then said group<br>
can be a de-conjugated or conjugated alkenyl group. It is understood that by<br><br>
"de-conjugated alkenyl" it is meant that the carbon carbon double bond of said group is<br>
not conjugated with the diene moiety, i.e. does not form a conjugated triene system.<br>
It is understood that by "alkyl or de-conjugated alkenyl group" it is meant that said<br>
R to R can be in the form of, e.g., a linear, branched or (poly)cyclic group or can also be<br>
in the form of a mixture of said type of groups, e.g. a specific group may comprise a<br>
linear alkyl and a (poly)cyclic alkyl moiety, unless a specific limitation to only one type is<br>
mentioned.<br>
Concerning compound (II), since it is an olefin, it can be obtained in the form of a<br>
mixture of two isomers, i.e. the one wherein the groups R1 and R2 are in a cis<br>
configuration ("cis "-alkene (II)) or wherein the groups R1 and R2 are in a trans<br>
configuration ("trans "-alkene (II'))<br><br>
It is understood that according to the invention the alkene obtained is in the form<br>
of a mixture "cis "-alkene and "trans "-alkene, wherein the ratio "cis "-alkene / "trans "-<br>
alkene (cis/trans) is above 1. According to a particular embodiment, said ratio is above 4<br>
or even above 10. In another particular embodiment, said cis/trans ratio can be above 19<br>
or even above 30, and in some cases ratio of above 45 or more can be obtained. In any<br>
case the presence of the acidic additive in the prescribed concentration range allows to<br>
improve said ratio.<br>
The substrate (I), due to the fact that it is a diene, can be in the form of a mixture<br>
of its three configuration isomers, i.e. the (Z,Z), (E,Z) and (E,E) isomers.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, the substrate is a diene<br>
comprising at least one ester or an alcohol functional group. Said diene can<br>
advantageously provide an unsaturated ester or alcohol useful in the pharmaceutical,<br>
agrochemical or perfumery industry as final product or as an intermediate. Particularly<br>
preferred substrate is a diene comprising at least one ester or an alcohol functional group,<br>
and said diene will provide an unsaturated ester or alcohol useful in the perfumery<br>
industry as final product or as an intermediate.<br><br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the substrate is a compound of<br>
formula (I) wherein<br>
R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 and R6 represent, simultaneously or independently from each other, a<br>

and<br>
R1 and R3, or R3 and R4, or R2 and R6, or R6 and R5, or R4 and R5, taken together, may<br>
form a C3-10 alkanediyl or de-conjugated alkenediyl group, optionally substituted.<br>
According to another embodiment of the invention, the substrate is a compound of<br>
formula (I) wherein<br>
R1, R4 and R5 represent each a hydrogen atom; and<br>
R2, R3 and R6 represent, simultaneously or independently from each other, a hydrogen<br>
atom or a C1-C8 alkyl or de-conjugated alkenyl group, optionally substituted.<br>
Possible substituents of R1 to R6, when taken alone or together, are as described<br>
above.<br>
Particular examples of substrate (I) are those of formula<br><br>
wherein Ra represents a linear, branched or cyclic C1-C8 alkyl or alkenyl group, preferably<br>
a linear or branched alkyl one; and<br>
Rb represents a (CH2)mX group, m representing 0, 1, 2 or 3, X representing a CHO, OH,<br>

More specific examples are the compounds of formula (I') wherein Ra represents a<br>
methyl, ethyl or propyl group, and Rb a (CH2)mX group, m representing 0, 1, or 2, X<br>
being as defiend above. According to a particular embodiment the substrate can be sorbol,<br>
a C1-8 alkyl sorbate, or a sorbol esters of C1-8 carboxylates.<br>
Furthermore, said substrate (I') can be essentially in the form of its (Z,Z) isomer<br>
(e.g. comprising at least 99% w/w of the isomer (Z,Z)).<br>
Other particular examples of substrate (I) are those of formula<br><br><br>
wherein Rd and Re represent a hydrogen atom or a C1-C8 alkyl or alkenyle group,<br>
optionally substituted by a OH, OCORf, ORf or COORf group, Rf being a C1-C8 alkyl or<br>
alkenyl group, provided that Rd and Re do not represent each a hydrogen atom.<br>
More specific examples of the compounds of formula (I") can be the ocimene,<br>
myrcene, myrcenol or its C1-8 carboxylates.<br>

The cyclopentadiene precursor CpH of the cyclopentadienyl ligand Cp (L)<br>
mentioned above can be obtained by applying standard general methods which are well<br>
known in the state of the art and by the person skilled in the art (see for example<br>
WO 2006/051503). Some of said ligands are even commercially available.<br>
The Diene can be a C4-C22 non-aromatic hydrocarbon group comprising two<br>
carbon-carbon double bonds, said carbon-carbon double bonds can be conjugated or non-<br>

[Ru(C5Me5)(dimethylbutadiene)(C3H6O)]BF4.<br>
In a general way, the complexes of formula (III) can be prepared and isolated prior<br>
to their use in the process according to some methods described in the literature for<br>
example by P.J. Fagan et al. (Organometallics, 1990, 9, pg 1843-1852), F. Bouachir et al.<br>
(Organometallics, 1991, 10, pg 455-462) or P. Alvarez et al. (Organometallics, 1991, 20,<br>
pg 3762-3771), the one choosen depending on the nature of cyclopentadienyl and diene<br>
ligands and also of the non-coordinating anion.<br>
It is also understood that the complex of formula (III) can also be obtained in situ<br><br>
from complexes which have a similar formula and are cationic or anionic according to the<br>
standard knowledge of a person skilled in the art. For example, reaction can be run using<br>
[Ru(Cp*)(COD)Y] (Y being F, Cl, Br or I and method for preparation having been<br>
described by P.J. Fagan et al. in Organometallics, 1990, 9, pg 1843-1852) as precursors in<br>
the presence of the substrate and silver or tallium salts).<br>
From the present invention, it is preferably excluded the case wherein the substrate<br>
is sorbol and the catalysts is [(Cp*)Ru(COD)]X.<br>
Many of the above-mentioned complexes of formula (III) are new and therefore<br>
represent also another aspect of the present invention.<br>
In particular said new complexes (III) can be the ones wherein L is a C6-C25<br>
compound of formula<br><br>
wherein each R9 represents, simultaneously or independently from each other, a hydrogen<br>
atom, a phenyl group optionally substituted, or a C1-C10 alkyl or alkenyl group optionally<br>
substituted; and<br>
one or two of said groups R9 is a OSiR113 or OCOR10 group, R11 representing a C1-C6<br>
alkyl group, R10 representing a R11 or CF3 group or a phenyl group optionally substituted;<br>
and<br>
at least one R9 is an alkyl group; two adjacent R9 can be bound together to form a C2-C10<br>
alkanediyl group.<br>
Possible substituents of R9, when representing a alkyl or alkenyl group, include<br>
one or two methyl, ethyl, methoxy or ethoxy groups. Possible substituents of R9 , when<br>
representing a phenyl group, or of R10, include one or two methyl, ethyl, methoxy, ethoxy<br>
or nitro groups or CF3, F, Cl, Br groups.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, four R9 represent, simultaneously or<br>
independently from each other, a hydrogen atom or a C1-C4 alkyl group (such as methyl<br>
or ethyl) and one R9 represents OSiR113, R11 representing a C1-C4 alkyl group (such as<br>
methyl or ethyl), and at least one R9 is an alkyl group.<br><br>
To carry out the processes of the invention, it is required also to use at least an<br>
acidic additive. By "acidic additive" it is meant a compound capable of providing at least<br>
one proton to the catalytic cycle. Said acidic additive is preferably an organic or inorganic<br>
compound having a pKa comprised between 0.8 and 7, but in the case of phenols or boron<br>
derivatives said pKa can range up to 10.<br>
Furthermore, said acidic additive can be selected from the group consisting of:<br>
-	compound of formula R14(3-x)MO(OH)x, wherein R14 is a R14 or R14 O group wherein<br>
R14 is a C1-C10 group, M is P or As and x is 1 or 2;<br>
-	a boron derivative of formula R14B(OH)2, wherein R14 is as defined above; and<br>
-	phenol or a phenol substituted by up to three C1-C4 alkyl, alkoxy or carboxylic groups,<br>
nitro groups or halogen atoms;<br>
-	a C1-C12 mono-carboxylic non-amino acid;<br>
-	a HOOCCH=CHCOOH di-acide, or the tetronic acid.<br>
By "mono-carboxylic non-amino acid" it is meant here a mono-carboxylic acid<br>

As previously mentioned, the processes of the invention consist in the<br>
hydrogenation of a substrate using a ruthenium complex and an acidic additive. A typical<br>
process implies the mixture of the substrate with the ruthenium complex, at least one<br>
acidic additive and optionally a solvent, and then treating such a mixture with molecular<br>
hydrogen at a chosen pressure and temperature.<br>
The complexes of the invention, an essential parameter of the process, can be<br>
added to the reaction medium in a large range of concentrations. As non-limiting<br>
examples, one can cite as complex concentration values those ranging from 0.01 mol% to<br>
5 mol%, the molar percentage being relative to the amount of substrate. Preferably, the<br>
complex concentration will be comprised between 0.03 mol% to 2 mol%. It goes without<br>
saying that the optimum concentration of complex will depend, as the person skilled in<br>
the art knows, on the nature of the latter, on the nature of the substrate, on the nature of<br>
the solvent and on the pressure of H2 used during the process, as well as the desired time<br>
of reaction.<br>
Useful quantities of acidic additive, added to the reaction mixture, may be<br>
comprised in a relatively large range. Apart from the one above cited, one can cite, as<br>
non-limiting examples, total amounts ranging between 0.5 to 50 molar equivalents,<br><br>
relative to the complex, preferably 0.8 to 20, and even more preferably between about 2<br>
and about 10 molar equivalents.<br>
The hydrogenation reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of a<br>
solvent. When a solvent is required or used for practical reasons, then any solvent current<br>
in hydrogenation reactions can be used for the purposes of the invention. Non-limiting<br>
examples include non-aromatic solvents such as C1-C12 non aromatic ketones, esters,<br>
alkanes ethers, chlorinated alkanes and alcohols or mixtures thereof. According to an<br>
embodiment of the invention, the solvent is advantageously selected amongst the C1-C12<br>
alkyl ketones, esters, ethers or chlorinated alkanes. In particular and as non-limiting<br>
examples one may cite the following: acetone ethyl acetate, MTBE, THF, iso-propyl<br>
acetate, Et2O, dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloethane, EtoH, MeOH, pentane, hexane. The<br>
choice of the solvent can be done as a function of the nature of the complex and the<br>
person skilled in the art is well able to select the solvent most convenient in each case to<br>
optimize the hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In the hydrogenation process of the invention, the reaction can be carried out at a<br>
H2 pressure comprised between 105 Pa and 80x105 Pa (1 to 80 bars) or even more if<br>
desired. Again, a person skilled in the art is well able to adjust the pressure as a function<br>
of the catalyst load and of the dilution of the substrate in the solvent. As examples, one<br>
can cite typical pressures of 1 to 30xl05 Pa (1 to 30 bar).<br>
The temperature at which the hydrogenation can be carried out is comprised<br>
between 0°C and 120°C, more preferably in the range of between 40°C and 100°C. Of<br>
course, a person skilled in the art is also able to select the preferred temperature as a<br>
function of the melting and boiling point of the starting and final products as well as the<br>
desired time of reaction or conversion.<br>
Examples<br>
The invention will now be described in further detail by way of the following<br>
examples, wherein the temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade and the<br>
abbreviations have the usual meaning in the art.<br>
All the procedures described hereafter have been carried out under an inert<br>
atmosphere unless stated otherwise. Hydrogenations were carried out in open glass tubes<br>
placed inside a stainless steel autoclave. H2 gas (99.99990%) was used as received. All<br>
substrates and solvents were distilled from appropriate drying agents under Ar. NMR<br><br>
spectra were recorded on a Bruker AM-400 (400 MHz) spectrometer and normally<br>
measured at 300 K, in CD2Cl2 unless indicated otherwise. Chemical shifts are listed in<br>
ppm and coupling constant J are in Hz.<br>
Example 1<br>
A) Synthesis of cyclopentadienes<br>
Cyclopentadienes were synthesized starting from substituted cyclopentenones prepared<br>
according to procedure previously described in patent WO 2006051503.<br><br>
Cyclopentadienes were generally obtained in high molar yields (&gt;80%) and purity<br>
(&gt; 95%).<br>
Rn is an alkyl or alkenyl group<br>
A solution of cyclopentenone (1 equivalents) in THF (1.6 M) was added at 0°C under<br>
inert atmosphere to a solution of RnMgCl (1.2 equivalents). Reaction mixture was then<br>
allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 3 hours. Acetic acid 10% was then<br>
added to the reaction mixture and the organic phase was extracted with Et20. HCl (20% in<br>
water) was added to the organic phase and allowed to stir for 30 minutes. The organic<br>
phase was then neutralized with NaHCO3 (5% in water). Washing with water, drying and<br>
evaporation of solvent gave a crude product, which was purified by distillation.<br>
R"=H<br>
Cyclopentenenones were reduced by NaBH4 (0.5 equivalents) in EtOH under inert<br>
atmosphere. After work-up, the crude products were purified by fractionated distillation.<br>
Rn= alkoxy or siloxy<br>
A solution of Li(NiPr)2 (1.2 equivalents) in THF (2M) was added to a solution of<br>
cyclopentanone (1 equivalent) in THF (0.1 M) at -78°C. After 1 hour stirring the alkyl<br><br>
halide Rn-halide or the siloxy halide (R11)3Si-halide (1.5 equivalents) was added to the<br>
reaction mixture.<br>
Reaction mixture was then allowed to warm to room temperature and stirred for 5hours.<br>
Reaction mixture was evaporated to dryness and n-hexane was added. The solid salts<br>
were eliminated by filtration and the solution was then evaporated to dryness. The crude<br>
product was purified by distillation.<br>
Ligand C5(1,2,4-tBu3)H2 was synthesized according to the literature (E. V. Dehmlow,<br>
C. Bollmann, Z.Naturforsch., 1993, 48b, 457-460).<br>
B) Catalyst synthesis<br>
Ruthenium catalysts were synthesized according to three different ways depending on the<br>
nature of cyclopentadienyle and diene ligands but also of the counter-ion. All the solvent<br>
used were dried and stored under inert atmosphere.<br>
Method 1:<br>
[Ru(L)(l,3-COD]BF4 complexes with L being a cyclopentadienyl ligand bearing no<br>
aromatic groups were obtained in two steps starting from [Ru(COD)(COT)], via<br>
[(CODyl)2RuH][BF4], both obtained according to a procedure previously described by<br>
F.Bouachir, B. Chaudret, F. Dahan, F. Agbossou, I. Tkatchenko, Organometallics, 1991,<br>
10,455-462.<br>
To [Ru(CODyl)2H]BF4 in solution in CH2Cl2 (0.05 M) under inert atmosphere was added<br>
a stoechiometric amount of the desired substituted cyclopentadiene derivative L<br>
(1 equivalent / Ru) and reaction mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 hours. It<br>
was then concentrated to dryness. [(L)Ru(l,3-COD][BF4] complexes were crystallized<br>
from a CH2Cl2/Et2O mixture. It was obtained in more than 80% molar yield after filtration<br>
and drying under vacuum.<br>
