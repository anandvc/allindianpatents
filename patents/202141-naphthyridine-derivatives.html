				<td>NAPHTHYRIDINE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to novel 8-aryl-l,7-naphthyridines, processes for their production, their use as pharmaceuticals and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them.<br>
The present invention provides 8-aryl-l ,7-naphthyridines, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form. By "aryl" is meant a mono or bicyclic aromatic or heteroaromatic moiety having up to 10 aromatic non-hydrogen atoms and being linked to the 1,7-naphthyridine either directly (e.g., phenyl, pyridyl, tetrazolyl, benzofurazanyl, or benzothiofurazanyl) or via a methylene bridge {e.g., benzyl or pyridylmethyl); preferably a monocyclic aromatic moiety having up to six aromatic carbon atoms, up to two of which may be replaced with nitrogen, for example phenyl, benzyl, 4-pyridyl, or 4-pyridylmethyl, optionally bearing a carboxy, carboxy ester or hydroxy group. The 8-aryl moiety may optionally be further substituted, especially with an electron withdrawing substituent, e.g., nitro, nitrilo, imino, halogen or a halogen-containing substituent (e.g. irifluoromethyl). or cyano, preferably in the meta-position. For example, the 8-aryl moiety may be cyanophenyl, nitrophenyl, tetrazolylphenyl (e.g. tetrazol-1-ylphenyl), or chlorophenyl. Optionally, the double ring of the naphthyridine portion of the molecule may also be further substituted or disubstituted, especially 6-substituted, with hydroxy, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, alyl, alyloxy, amino, arylamino, diarylamino, alkamino, dialkamino, arylamido, or akamido, wherein "alk" refers to an aliphatic moiety of up to eight carbon atoms, optionally bearing a carboxy, or carboxy ester or hydroxy group and/or optionally containing an ether linkage and/or ester linkage.<br>
In particular, the invention provides novel 8-phenyl- and 8-benzyl-l,7-naphthyridines, wherein the J ,7-naphthyridine double ring is optionally 6-substituted, e.g., as exemplified below, and the phenyl ring is optionally substituted by an electron withdrawing substituent such as nitro; e.g., compounds of Formula I:<br><br><br>
Ri is phenyl, benzyl, 3-nitrophenyl, 3-chlorophenyl, 3-cyanophenyl. 3-(tetrazolyl)phenyI,<br>
benzohirazanyl, or benzothiofurazanyl;<br>
R2 is hydroxy, amino, trifluoromethanesulphonyl, allyl, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, aryl,<br>
aralkyl, aryloxy, amino, arylamino, diarylamino, alkamino, dialkamino, alkaryl, arylamido, or<br>
alkamido,<br>
and esters and amides thereof;<br>
in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form.<br>
In formula I and elsewhere in the present description "alk" and "aryl" have the meanings as given above in relation to the 8-aryl-l,7-naphthyridines of the invention.<br>
Preferably, R2 is selected from hydroxy, amino, arylamino (e.g., phenylamino), aryl (e.g., phenyl), alkaryl (e.g. lower alkylphenyl), alkenyl (e.g., vinyl), alkynyl (e.g., ethynyl), alkoxy containing an ether linkage and/or ester linkage (e.g., methoxycarbonylmethoxy), and alkamido (e.g., acetamido).<br>
In particular it has been surprisingly discovered that a wholly new class of 6,8-aiyl-l,' naphthyridines are useful as pharmaceuticals, in particular as orally active PDE 4 inhibitors, e.g. for the treatment of asthma.<br>
Thus in a preferred embodiment the invention provides 6-(carboxyphenyl or carboxymethylphenyl)-8-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiadiazolyl orbenzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphthyridines, and esters and amides thereof, in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt fon<br>
More preferably, the invention provides 6-(4-carboxyphenyl or 4-<br><br>
carboxymethylphenyl)-8-(phenyl, 4-benzo[c]thiadiazoIyl or 4-benzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphihyridines, and esters and amides thereof, in free or phannaceutically acceptable salt form.<br><br>
and either<br>
R3 is H and R4 is nitre, halo (e.g. chloro), cyano, or tetrazolyl (e.g. l-tetrazolyl), and R5 and<br>
Re together form an additional bond, or<br>
Rj, R4, R5 and R together are =N-0-N= or =N-S-N=;<br>
and esters and amides thereof;<br>
in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salt forms of the 8-aryl-l,7-naphthyridines, e.g..<br><br>
of Formula I or E, for pharmaceutical use are prepared by conventional means. For example, compounds having a free carboxylic acid group, e.g. compounds of formula II in which R? is OH, may be contacted with a suitable base, e.g. an amino sugar such as an N-methyl-glucamine, to provide a corresponding base addition salt. Conveniently such base addition salts may be water soluble.<br>
The 8-aryl-I,7-naphthyridinesof the invention, e.g., of formula!, may be prepared by reacting 2-cyano-3-pyridylacetonitrile<br>
a) with an acid, e.g., H-A, wherein A is a halogen, e.g., bromine, to obtain the compound of Formula III:<br><br>
which can then be further derivatized to obtain compounds of the invention, e.g., with a cross-coupling reaction using metal reagents in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst to form a carbon-carbon bond, for example a Stille, Suzuki, or Heck reaction, i.e., reacting a compound of formula IH with a compound Y-Rg wherein Y is a metallic leaving group, e.g., B(0H)2-, {CH2)3Sn- (CH3(CH2)3)3Sn-, and Rs is an 8-aryl moiety as defined above, e.g., benzyl or 3-nitrophenyl, to obtain the corresponding compound of formula IV<br><br><br><br>
wherein Q is either a halogen A as defined above, or an 8-aiyl moiety Rg as defined above, which is a novel and highly useful intermediate for the preparation of compounds of the invention, e.g., when R2 in Formula I is joined to the rest of the molecule via a carbon-carbon bond, the substitution can be accomplished, e.g., with a cross-coupling reaction using metal reagents in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst to form a carbon-carbon bond, for example a Stille, Suzuki, or Heck reaction, e.g., reacting a compound of Formula V wherein Q is Rg with a compound of formula Y-R2 wherein Y is a metallic leaving group as defined above and R2 is the desired carbon substituent, e.g., alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, aryl or alkaryl as defined above for formula I, optionally in protected form, followed by deprotection if required; or<br>
(ii) alkyl or aryl substitution (e.g., by reaction with a corresponding alkyl halide or organometal) to give the desired secondary or tertiary amine; or<br>
(iii) acylation (e.g., by reaction with a carboxylic acid or an acid anhydride) to give the corresponding amide, using conventional procedures; or<br>
(iv) conversion to hydroxy, e.g., by reaction with NaN02 in the presence of a dilute acid, e.g., sulfuric acid, and optionally further derivalized, e.g., 0-alkylated, for example by<br><br>
reaction with an alkyl halide under suitable reaction conditions.<br>
The preferred 6-(carboxy-, or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphthyridines, or esters or amides thereof, e.g. of formula H, are conveniently prepared by the following method<br>
(A)	for preparation of a 6-{carboxy- or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-{phenyl, benzo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]fiira2anyl)-l ,7-naphthyridines, or esters or amides thereof, reacting a 6-X-8-{phenyl, benzo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphthyridine with an X'-(carboxy-, or carboxymethyl- -phenyl) or ester or amide thereof, or reacting a 6-(carboxy-or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-X-l,7-naphthyridine or ester or amide thereof with an X'-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiadazolyl orbenzo[c]furazanyl), wherein X and X' are leaving groups capable of participating in a cross-coupling reaction; for example, wherein X is trifluoromethanesulfonyl or halogen, e.g. bromine or chlorine, and X' is a metallic l*=aving group, e.g. substituted boron (e.g. -B{0H)2, -B(0Alk)2 or -Balk: where Alk is alkyl, e.g. methyl or ethyl) or trialkylstannyl (e.g. (CH3(CH2)3)3Sn- or (CH3)3Sn-) or a Grignard n-dical (e.g. MgBr; and/or<br>
(B)	optionally reacting a 6-(carboxy- or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiada2olyl or benzo[c]fiirazanyl)-l ,7-naphthyridine with a suitable amine, e.g. ammonia or (Ci)alkylamine, to obtain the corresponding amide; and/or<br>
(C)	optionally reacting a 6-(carboxy- or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphthyridine with a suitable alcohol, e.g. a {C|. 4)alcohol, to obtain the corresponding ester; and<br>
recovering the resulting 6-(carboxy- or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphthyridine, or ester or amide thereof, in free or salt form.<br>
Reaction conditions for step (A) are as known in the art for cross-coupling reactions using metal reagents, e.g. in the presence of a palladium or nickel catalyst, to form a carbon-carbon bond; for example, as in a Stille, Suzuki, or Heck reaction. Reaction conditions for steps (B) and (C) are as known in the art for preparation of amides from reaction of carboxylic<br><br>
acids and amines and for preparation of esters from carboxylic acids and alcohols, e.g. under acidic or basic conditions. Recovery and purification are by usual methods, e.g. by chromatography or crystallisation.<br><br>
6-X-8-(pheny!, benzo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]ftirazanyl)-l,7-nhthyridines and 6-(carboxy- or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-X-1,7-naphthyridines or esters or amides thereof for use in the above reactions are suitably prepared by reacting 2-cyano-3-pyridylacetonitrile with an acid, e.g. H-A, where A is a halogen, e.g. bromine, to obtain a compound of formula IE, and thereafter further derivatised as required, as described above.<br>
The above described processes for the preparation of the 8-aryl-1,7-naphthyridines of the invention, in particular the preferred 6-(carboxy-, or carboxymethyl- -phenyl)-8-(phenyl, benzo[c]thiada2olyl or benzo[c]furazanyl) ,7-naphthyridines and esters and amides thereof, are new as are the intermediates of formulae IV, V and VI, and these novel processes and<br><br>
intermediates are included within tiie scope of the present invention. It will be appreciated that compounds of formula V in which Q is Rg and compounds of formula IV are encompassed by the 8-aryl-l,7-naphthyridines of the invention.<br><br><br>

By repeating the procedure described in the appropriate example above and using appropriate starting materials the following compounds of formula I are obtained as identified<br><br><br><br><br><br>
preferred 6-(carboxy-, or carboxymethyl- -ph6nyl)-8-{phenyl, beiizo[c]thiadazolyl or benzo[c]furazanyl)-l,7-naphthyridines, and esters and amides thereof, in free or salt form (hereinafter referred to as AGENTS OF THE INVENTION) exhibit pharmacological activity and are useful as pharmaceuticals, e.g. for therapy, in the treatment of diseases and conditions<br>
as hereinafter set forth.<br>
In particular AGENTS OF THE INVENTION exhibit cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) isoenzyme inhibiting activity, selective for type 4 isoenzyme.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION possess anti-inflammatory, anti-airways hyperreactivity and bronchodilator properties. They further possess immunosuppressive, TNFa secretion inhibitory and other pharmacological activities as may be demonstrated in standard test methods for example as follows:<br>
A. PDE4 inhibition: Recombinant PDE4A, PDE4B. PDE4C and PDE4D isoenzyme inhibition assays-Cloning and expression: PDE4 cDNA coding for the four isoenzymes, human PDE4A (as described by Sullivan et al.. Cell Signal 1994; 6:793-812), rat PDE4B (as described by Colicelli et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1989; 86:3599-3903), human PDE4C (as described by Engels et al., FEBS Lett. 1995; 358:305-310), and human PDE4D (as described by Baecker et al.. Gene 1994; 138:253-256) is cloned either into an extrachromosomal yeast expression vector (PDE4C, PDE4D) or integrated (PDE4A, PDE4B; single copy) at the pep4 locus of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking both of the wild-type yeast PDE genes. Yeast strains expressing PDE4 isoenzymes are grown in 11 cultures at 30'C, pelleted and frozen until homogenization.<br>
Homogenization: Pelleted yeast (5 mL) is suspended in 50 mL of buffer (10 mM tris-hydroxymethylaminomethane, 1 mM ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid, 1 mg/mL each of leupeptin and pepstatin A, 175 mg/mL phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride, 1 mM dithiothreitol, pH 7.4 with HCl). After centrifugation, 15 g of glass beads (425-600 mm, acid washed, Sigma<br><br>
Chemical Co.) washed with buffer are added to the pellet. To this slurry, 1 mL of buffer and 60 mg of cholamidopropane sulphonic acid are added and the slurry is vigorously agitated for 4 h at 4°C. The yeast cells are disintegrated, as observed microscopically (phase-contfast optics) as dark cells and is &gt;30% (usually 50%). The slurry is transferred to a coarse glass funnel and the homogenate collected by suction and washing of the glass beads with a total of 15 mL buffer. Cell fragments are separated from cytosol by centrifiigation (2000xg, 10 min, 4°C). The pellet is resuspended in 15 mL of buffer and assayed for PDE activity together with the cytosol.<br>
Otherwise isoenzyme preparations are derived from human sources. Type 3 and 4 preparations are obtained taking advantage of the predominance of type 3 isoenzymes in platelets and of type 4 isoenzymes in neutrophils applying the following techniques:<br>
Cells and tissues are homogenized on ice in tris-HCl 10 mM pH 7.4 containing: Sucrose (250 mM), EDTA 1 mM, dithiothreitol (1 mM), leupeptin and pepstatin A (1 fxg/ml each), and phenyl-methyl-sulphonyl fluoride (PMSF, 0.17 rag/ml added just before the homogenization). Neutrophils (type 4) and platelets (types 2 and 3) are obtained from human blood and sonicated (Branson probe, 4x15 sec). Human lung (types 1 and 5) is obtained from patients undergoing surgery and homogenized using a Polytron horaogenizer (two bursts of 30 sec).<br>
Isoenzyme preparations: PDE 3 and 4 (substrate cAMP 1 M) preparations consist of low-speed supemates of the platelet and neutrophil homogenates, respectively. Types 1 (substrate cAMP 1 M, Ca* 0.5 mM, calmodulin 125 nM), 2 (cAMP 100 iM) and 5 (cGMP liM) are separated by anion-exchange chromatography (Q-Sepharose) using a gradient of NaCl in homogenization buffer without sucrose and PMSF (0 to O.I M NaCl in 2.5 column volumes, 0.1 to 0.45 M in 24 column volumes). PDE 1: fractions where hydrolysis of cAMP 1 \iM can be stimulated by Ca + calmodulin (0.5 mM and 125 nM, respectively); eluting at 0.17-0.18 M NaCl. PDE 2: fractions showing substantial cAMP hydrolytic activity at 100M but not at \\iM; eluting at 0.31-0.32 M NaCl. PDE 5: fractions selectively hydrolysing cGMP 1 M over cAMP 1|XM; eluting at 0.20-0.24 M NaCl.<br><br>
PDE assay: The assay protocol is based upon the two-step method described by Thompson et al. (Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1979; 10:69-92), modified for 96-well microtitre plates. Briefly, enzyme is diluted with homogenization buffer (see above) in order to obtain between 10% and 30% total substrate hydrolysis during the assay. To start the reaction, 25 mL of diluted enzyme is added to 25 mL of substrate ([3H]-cAMP, 1.25 mM, 740 Bq) and 75 mL of inhibitor solution (see below). After 30 minutes at 37°C, the reaction is stopped in a hot water bath (65°C, 5 minutes). Plates are cooled on ice and incubated for 10 minutes at 37°C with 25 mL of 5'-nucleotidase (Snake venom, from oiophaghus hannah, Sigma Chemical Co., 0.1 mg/mL in water). The unreacted substrate is separated from [3H]-adenosine by sequentially adding aliquots (100+50+50 mL, at 5 min intervals) of 30% (v/v) Dowex 1x2 slurry (acetate form) in 0.2% (v/v) acetic acid. The Dowex is pelleted by centrifugation (150xg, 5 min). Aliquots of the supemates are transferred onto 96-well, solid-phase scintillation plates (LumaPlate, Canberra Packard) using an automated pipetting device (Hamilton MicroLab 2200), dried (at least 4 h at 50°C) and counted (Canberra Packard TopCount).<br>
Inhibitors: Inhibitor stock solutions are prepared in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) and diluted with water/DMSO to achieve 7 concentrations selected to cover the range of 30% to 70% inhibition. The concentration of DMSO is kept constant at 50 mL/mL throughout the assay.<br>
Determination of inhibition parameters: The concentration at which half-maximal inhibition occurs (IC50) and the steepness of the dose-response curve (Hill's coefficient) are determined from concentration-inhibition curves by non-linear least-squares fitting to the two-parameter logistic equation. Results are expressed as the negative decimal logarithm of inhibitor concentration at which half-maximal inhibition is observed (IC50) (in mol/L; pICjo). 95% confidence intervals were estimated and expressed as pL and pU (negative decimal logarithms of the tower and upper confidence limits, respectively). Concentrations which cause a visible precipitation in the assay are excluded from the analysis.<br><br>
In this test method AGENTS OF THE INVENTION predominantly inhibit PDE isoenzymes of type 4 having relatively little effect in relation to types 1, 2, 3 and?. Within the PDE type 4 isoenzyme group (i.e. PDE types 4 A to D) AGENTS OF THE INVENTION generally exhibit selectivity for inhibition of PDE type 4 D isoenzyme in comparison with the PDE type 4 A, 4B and 4C isoenzymes.<br>
Anti-inflammatory activity: Inhibition of eosinophil activation by formyl-MetLeuPhe (fMLP)<br>
Purified human eosinophils (lOVwell in 0.2ml HBSS) are stimulated with fMLP (Ip-M) in the presence of lucigenin (25|iM). Inhibition of the oxidative burst (measured as changes in chemiluminescence) is determined from dose response curves using the logistic equation.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are active in the above test method at concentrations of the order of from 0.001 to 5 M, generally in the low nM range. The compound of example 2 for instance has an IC50 in this assay of 0.006 M.<br>

Dosages employed in practicing the present invention will of course vary depending, e.g. on the particular disease or condition to be treated, the particular AGENT OF THE<br><br>
INVENTION used, the mode of administration and the therapy desired. In general, however, satisfactory results, e.g. for the treatment of diseases as hereinbefore set forth are indicated to be obtained on oral administration at dosages of the order from about 0.01 to2.0mgykg. In larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage for oral administration will accordingly be in the range of from about 0.75 to 150 mg, conveniently administered I x or in divided doses 2 to 4x daily or in sustained release form. Unit dosage forms for oral administration thus suitably comprise from about 0.2 to 75 or 150, e.g. from about 0.2 or 2.0 to 50,75 or 100 mg AGENT OF THE INVENTION, together with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent or carrier therefor.<br>
For use in the treatment of chronic or obstructive airways disease, e.g. asthma AGENTS OF THE INVENTION may also be administered by the inhaled route. Again dosages employed will vary, e.g. depending on the particular disease or condition, the particular AGENT OF THE INVENTION employed, the particular mode of administration (e.g. whether by dry powder inhalation or otherwise) and the effect desired. In general, however, an indicated inhaledaily dosage will be ofthe order offrom about 2.5 to about 130.0 |xg/kg/day e.g. from about 13.0 to about 60.0 |ig/kg/day. For larger mammals, for example humans, an indicated daily dosage for administration by inhalation, e.g. in the treatment of asthma, will be in the range of from about 0.2 to about 10.0 mg, e.g. from about 1 to about 5 mg, conveniently given in one single administration or 2 or 3 separate administrations throughout the day. An appropriate dosage per administration will thus be of the order of from about 200 ig to about 3.3 mg, with administration up to 3 times daily, suitably administered from a dry powder inhalation delivery device in a series of 2 to 8 puffs at each administration.<br>
AGENTS OF THE INVENTION may also be administered by any other appropriate route, e.g. by infusion, for example for the treatment of endotoxin shock; nasally, for example for the treatment of rhinitis; ocularly, for example for the treatmen of autoimmune diseases of (he eye; dermally, i.e. topically to the skin, for example for the treatment of dermatoses or psoriasis; or rectally, e.g. via enemation or suppository, for example for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. Suitable dosages for application by such routes will generally be<br><br>
of the order of 10 to 100x less than those required for oral administration.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising AGENTS OF THE INVENTION may be prepared using conventional diluents or excipients and techniques known in the galenic art. Thus oral dosage forms may include tablets, capsules and the like. Formulations for dermal administration may take the form of creams, ointments, gels, or transdermal delivery systems, e.g. patches and, in addition to inert diluents or carriers, may suitably contain skin penetration enhancing agents, again as known in the art.<br>
Compositions for inhalation may comprise aerosol or other atomizable formulations as well as inhalable dry powder formulations, with or without diluent, for administration by any appropriate dry powder inhalation system as known in the art. For the preparation of dry powder forms for inhalation, AGENTS OF THE INVENTION are suitably employed in pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt form. The said salt form is suitably milled, e.g. using an air-jet or ceramic mill to provide a finely divided inhalable powder, e.g. having an average particle diameter of ca. 2-3p.. Appropriately at least 90% of the material will have an average particle diameter of less than 7.8fi, more preferably of less than 4.8fi. In order to ensure obtention of an appropriate and consistent particulate product suitable for administration by inhalation in dry powder from, it may be preferable to effect milling of the active ingredient premixed with an appropriate inhalable carrier medium, e.g. lactose, under conditions of reduced temperamre.<br>
