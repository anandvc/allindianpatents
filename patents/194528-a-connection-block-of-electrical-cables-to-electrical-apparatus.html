				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This  invention  relates  to  a  connection  block  of   electrical apparatus  comprising at least one connector composed of a cage and a mobile wire clamp slide under the action of a clamping screw, inside a compartment in a box housing said connector.<br>
There is a type of connector used to connect cables to electrical equipment consisting of a cage and a wire clamp slide moved by a clamping screw, in the electrical appliance box. The disadvantage of these connectors is that access to the clamping screw is difficult.<br>
The purpose of this invention is to supply a connection block in which a tool can more easily access clamping screws, while improving the protection. The solution adopted is to prevent wiring errors and zc protect persons from touching parts conducting electricity, regardless of the diameter of the cables to be connected and to protect connection parts against dust and impurities.<br>
The connection block according to the invention is characterized in that the slide is U-shaped, with one flange of the U at the same level as the screw head and this flange supports a mobile protective insulating cover on the front, which protects the front of the slide, follows the movements and allows access to the screw head.<br><br>
According to one feature, the front cover covers the top of a wire clamp slide to partially or completely open or close a box compartment used for passing cables.<br>
According to one feature, there is an insulating cover at the back of the block which covers the back of the cage and follows its movements so as to open or close a compartment in the box used for passing cables.<br>
According to one feature, each of the connectors comprises a fixed electrical conductor connected to the apparatus and fitting between the bottom of the cage and the slide, and used for clamping two separate cables.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a connection block of electrical cables to electrical apparatus comprising at least one connector consisting of a cage and a wire clamp slide moved by a clamping screw under a compartment in a box in which said connector is placed, characterized in that the slide whidh is U-shaped has outside the cage, a flange and in the cage a second flange in order to clamp that at least an electrical cable, a mobile insulathig protective cover covaing the said slide so as to protect the front of the slide, follows its movements and provides access to the screw head.<br><br>
The invention will now be described in more detail, with reference to an embodiment given as an example shown on the/drawings in the appendix in which:<br>
-	figure 1 is a perspective view of equipment<br>
(contactor  type)  fitted  wi'th  two  connection<br>
blocks according to the invention;<br>
-figures 2, 3 and 4 are perspective views of a block shown with two cables, one cable and no cables respectively;<br>
-	figure 5 â–  is a section through a connector<br>
along the center line cf its clamping screw.<br>
Reference 2 shows an elecrrical equipment 2 (contactor type) on which two connection blocks 1 are mounted used to connect electrical cables mark 5 and 6. These blocks 1 are assembled to equipment 2 by assembly means known in existing technology.<br>
Each block 1 comprises a box 31 in which chambers 3 2 are formed (one for each pole on the equipment) which open up towards the front through openings 3 3 and each contains a connector 4 that can be used to connect electrical cables 5 and 6 to the equipment.<br>
The outside of box 31 is cut out above each connector 4 by two compartments 3 7 and 38, which can be used to insert the ends of two cables 5 and 6 into said connector.<br><br>
Each connector consists of a cage 42 and a mobile wire clamp slide 43, each under compartments 37, 38 into which the ends of cables 5, 6 to be connected are inserted. The general shape of cage 42 is prismatic, and it is composed of a stirrup 421 assembled to a nut crossing 422 through which a thread is drilled for a recessed head clamping screw 44. The cage can move freely inside the chamber in which it is located, as a function of the diameters of cables 5 and 6 to-be connected. In the embodiment shown, screw 44 shows a hexagonal setscrew.<br>
Each connector 4 also includes a fixed electrical conductor 45 that passes through a slot in the box, the extended end of which is fitted with a fixed contact of the contactor. This conductcr 45 separates the two compartments 3 7 and 3 8 which cpen up on each side of this conductor 45. The cage 42 is mounted in the associated chamber 32 such that the conductor 45- is located between the bottom of stirrup 421 and the nut crossing 422.<br>
The wire clamp slide 43 is moved in translation by screw 44 which screws inro cage 42. This slide is in a U-shape. Flange 431 of slide 43 clamps cable 6 and fits into cage 42, whereas flange 43.2 of the same slide fits outside the cage at the same height as the screw head. A hole is formed in this flange 432 to contain the screw head and through which a screwdriver can be inserted to turn the screw in or put. Screw 44 and slide 43 are kept together in translation in one direction by thrust from the end of the screw, and in the zzher direction by a collar on the screw head.<br>
By rotation of screw 44, the screw-nut system 42-44 can clamp firstly a cable 5 between the bottom of stirrup 421 and conductor 45, and secondly a cable 6 between conductor 45 and the wire clamp slide 43.<br>
At the front, the block comprises a mobile insulating cover 35 (plastic) that covers the front (on the screw head<br><br>
side) and the top of the wire clamp slide 43, and follows its movements so as to partially or fully open or close compartment 38. This insulating cover 35 is fixed in translation to the associated wire clamp slide 43 through a mechanical link using known technology. In the embodim.ent shown in figure 5, this link is made by a pin 3 54 on the cover which is housed in a hole in the slide 43.<br>
The front of the cover 3 5 contains a hole 3 53 that can be used to turn screw 44 in and out, and a part in relief 351 (V-shape) used as a screwdriver guide. Since the screwdriver guide 351 follows the screw translation movements, it facilitates access to the screw without forcing the wiring fitter to be in a specific position with respect to the block.<br>
At the back, the block contains an insulating cover 3 6 (plastic) supported by the back of cage 42, and which follows its movements so as to partially or fully cpen or close compartment 37. This mobile insulating cover 3 6 covers the back of the coupling over stirrup 421. The mechanical link between this rear cover 36 and the cage 42 is provided by appropriate means using known technology (for example clipping cover 3 6 on the cage).<br>
Clearances 34 are provided on the top of box 31 to facilitate access to the clamping screw heads 44. Note that a bridge 311 on the box separates compartments 3 7 and 38. It is positioned above conductor 45 and thus protects users from contact with this conductor.<br>
The back edge 3 52 of the front insulating cover 3 5 acts as a wire guide for a cable such as 6. Similarly, the front edge 3 61 of the rear insulating cover 3 6 acts as a wire guide for a cable such as 5.<br>
Between connectors 4, box 31 includes grooves 3S to facilitate access to terminals, for example such as coil terminals, without increasing the size. They can be used to contain add-on parts 7.<br><br>
We will now explain operation of the device.<br>
The front insulating cover 35 follows the movement of the clamping screw 44 and the wire clamp slide 43 and releases a wiring space corresponding to the diameter of cable 6. The rear insulating cover 36 also follows the movements of cage 42 and releases a wiring space corresponding to the diameter of cable 5.<br>
If the rear of the connector only contains one cable 5, the front compartment 3 8 is then completely closed by cover 35 (figure 3) which protects it from being touched, prevents impurities from entering and prevents a cable from being inserted outside the required area. The front of the front cover 351 follows the screw head which gives maximum screw visibility and accessibility.<br>
If the connector only contains one cable 6 in its front part, the rear compartment 3 7 is then completely closed by cover 36,  which also protects it from being touched, prevents impurities from entering and prevents a cable from being inserted outside the required area.<br>
If there are no cables in the connector (figure 4) , then covers 3 5 and 3 6 completely close compartments 3 7 and 3 8.<br>
Obviously, many alternatives and detailed improvements could be imagined within the framework of the invention, and equivalent means could also be used. The block can hold as many connectors as necessary.<br>
Connectors operate with the cage fixed in position (simple wiring) or free (double wiring).<br><br><br>
