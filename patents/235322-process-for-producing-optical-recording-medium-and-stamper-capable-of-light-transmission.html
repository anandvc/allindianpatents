				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM AND<br>
STAMPER CAPABLE OF LIGHT TRANSMISSION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing an optical recording medium and the like.<br>
Particularly, it relates to a process for producing an<br>
optical recording medium with improved production<br>
efficiency, and the like.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
In recent years, it has been desired to develop an<br>
optical recording medium on which information can be<br>
recorded at a higher density as compared with a<br>
conventional one to record and retrieve, a large quantity<br>
of data such as a long and high quality animation. Such<br>
an optical recording medium on which information can be<br>
recorded at a high density may, for example, be DVD-ROM<br>
having a laminated structure wherein two recording layers<br>
(dual layer) are formed on one medium. Employing such<br>
multilayer technology of forming two or more recording<br>
layers, it is possible to increase the capacity without<br>
changing the recording density per layer.<br>
Such a laminated multilayer optical recording medium<br>
is produced usually by a production process called photo<br>
polymerization process (hereinafter sometimes referred to<br>
as "2P process"). By the 2P process, a two-layer<br>
structure optical recording medium is produced, for<br>
example, by forming on a transparent first substrate<br>
having concaves and convexes for recording track formed<br>
thereon, a first recording layer, a first reflective<br>
layer, an interlayer having concaves and convexes for<br>
record track formed thereon, a second recording layer and<br>
a second reflective layer in this order, and finally<br>
bonding a second substrate.<br>
In the 2P process, the interlayer is produced<br>
usually as follows. First, a light-curing resin material<br>
or the like is applied to the first reflective layer, and<br>
then a light transmitting stamper having a concavo-convex<br>
shape is disposed thereon. Then, the light-curing resin<br>
material or the like is cured and then the stamper is<br>
separated. In such a manner, the concavo-convex shape is<br>
transcribed on the surface of the light-curing resin to<br>
form the interlayer. Accordingly, in the 2P process, it<br>
is required that the stamper after the light-curing resin<br>
is cured is smoothly separated. Namely, if problems in<br>
production arise in formation of the interlayer having a<br>
concavo-convex shape for record track by the 2P process,<br>
such that the light-curing resin for the interlayer is<br>
cured while the stamper adhered thereto, that the stamper<br>
is hardly separated from the light-curing resin, or that<br>
uniformity on the surface of the interlayer decreases<br>
even if the stamper is separated therefrom, optical<br>
information can not stably be recorded and retrieved on<br>
the optical recording medium. In order that the light-<br>
curing resin and the stamper are easily separated, for<br>
example, a method of preliminarily coating the surface of<br>
the stamper with a transparent inorganic material such as<br>
SiO2 has been proposed in JP-A-2002-279707.<br>
JP2003-85839 A seems to be the closest prior art.<br>
JP2003-85839 A discloses a stamper made of a cyclic<br>
polyolefin, but does not mention anything about MFR at all,<br>
much less significance of the use of polyolefin having a MFR<br>
higher than a certain level.<br>
Further, none of the resin stampers Nos.1-7 formed in<br>
Examples of JP2003-85839 A are made of a polyolefin having a<br>
MFR of at least 40 g/10 min.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS THAT THE INVENTION IS TO SOLVE<br>
To preliminarily coat the surface of a stamper used<br>
in the 2P process with a transparent inorganic material<br>
as in the method disclosed in Patent Document 1, the<br>
following step is required. That is, it is required to<br>
form a dielectric film made of an inorganic material such<br>
as SiO2 in a predetermined thickness on<br>
grooves/information pits formed on the surface of a resin<br>
stamper by e.g. a vacuum sputtering apparatus. This step<br>
makes the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium complicated, and is one cause of the increase in<br>
production cost.<br>
The present invention is to solve such technical<br>
problems which appeared in production of a laminated<br>
multilayer optical recording medium by the 2P process.<br>
Namely, the object of the present invention is to<br>
provide a process for producing a laminated multilayer<br>
optical recording medium with improved production<br>
efficiency.<br>
Further, another object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a light transmitting stamper to be used for<br>
production of a laminated multilayer optical recording<br>
medium by the 2P process.<br>
MEANS OF SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
To solve such problems, in the present invention, a<br>
light transmitting stamper made of a nonpolar member is<br>
used in a process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium by the 2P process. Namely, the process for<br>
producing an optical recording medium to which the<br>
present invention is applied comprises a step of forming<br>
on a substrate a recording layer on which information is<br>
to be recorded by applied light directly or via another<br>
layer, a step of forming a resin material layer on the<br>
formed recording layer directly or via another layer, and<br>
a step of disposing a light transmitting stamper<br>
comprising a nonpolar member having a concavo-convex<br>
shape on the formed resin material layer and separating<br>
the light transmitting stamper so that the concavo-convex<br>
shape is transcribed on the resin material layer to form<br>
an interlayer.<br>
In the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present invention is applied, the<br>
nonpolar member is a polymer material having no polar<br>
group in its molecule. This makes it possible that a<br>
resin layer to be formed from e.g. an ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin of the optical recording medium and the light<br>
transmitting stamper can easily be separated without<br>
applying a constrained load. Resultingly, deformation of<br>
the recording layer or the like can be prevented, and<br>
signal waveform for recording/retrieving optical<br>
information can be stabilized. Further, the residue of<br>
the ultraviolet-curing resin hardly adheres to the light<br>
transmitting stamper, whereby the light transmitting<br>
stamper can be recycled.<br>
The nonpolar member is preferably a polyolefin, and<br>
among polyolefins, it is preferably a crystalline<br>
polyolefin. Further, among crystalline polyolefins, it<br>
is preferably a polypropylene. When the above material<br>
is employed, the effects of the present invention will<br>
favorably be obtained.<br>
In the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present invention is applied, the<br>
light transmitting stamper is preferably made of a<br>
nonpolar polymer material having a melt flow rate (MFR)<br>
in a molten state of at least 20 g/10 min. When MFR of<br>
the nonpolar polymer material is within this range, the<br>
light transmitting stamper is likely to be easily formed<br>
by e.g. injection molding.<br>
In the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present invention is applied, the<br>
outer diameter of the light transmitting stamper is<br>
preferably larger than the outer diameter of the<br>
substrate. In this case, the outer diameter of the light<br>
transmitting stamper is larger than the outer diameter of<br>
the substrate preferably by a range of at least 1 mm and<br>
at most 15 mm. When the outer diameter of the light<br>
transmitting stamper is larger than the outer diameter of<br>
the substrate, even when an outer burr is generated in<br>
production of the interlayer, the outer burr will easily<br>
be removed.<br>
Further, in the process for producing an optical<br>
recording medium to which the present invention is<br>
applied, it is preferred that another resin material<br>
layer different from the resin material layer formed on<br>
the recording layer directly or via another layer, is<br>
formed on the surface having the concavo-convex shape of<br>
the light transmitting stamper, and the light<br>
transmitting stamper is disposed so that said another<br>
resin material layer and the resin material layer formed<br>
on the recording layer directly or via another layer face<br>
each other. By employing the above production process,<br>
the outer burr which may be generated in production of<br>
the interlayer will more easily be removed. Further, by<br>
employing the above production process, an interlayer<br>
having a favorable edge shape will easily be obtained.<br>
Further, in the process for producing an optical<br>
recording medium to which the present invention is<br>
applied, the resin material layer is preferably made of a<br>
radiation-curing resin. By employing the radiation-<br>
curing resin, the concavo-convex shape of the light<br>
transmitting stamper will easily be transcribed.<br>
Further, it is preferred that before the light<br>
transmitting stamper is separated, light is applied to<br>
the resin material layer to cure the radiation-curing<br>
resin in the resin material layer to form the interlayer.<br>
In the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present invention is applied, if the<br>
interlayer extends beyond the outer diameter of the<br>
substrate, the interlayer portion extending beyond the<br>
outer diameter of the substrate is preferably removed.<br>
By removing such an interlayer portion, the edge shape of<br>
the interlayer can be made favorable. Further, the<br>
interlayer portion extending beyond the outer diameter of<br>
the substrate is removed preferably by application of a<br>
laser beam. By use of a laser beam, accuracy of the edge<br>
shape of the interlayer will be more improved.<br>
In the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present invention is applied, it is<br>
preferred that a knife edge is inserted between the<br>
substrate and the light transmitting stamper to separate<br>
the light transmitting stamper. Further, when the<br>
substrate and the light transmitting stamper have a<br>
planer circular shape, the knife edge is inserted<br>
preferably from the inner diameter side of the substrate<br>
and the light transmitting stamper. By use of a knife<br>
edge, the light transmitting stamper will easily be<br>
separated. Further, it is preferred that the thickness<br>
of the light transmitting stamper is made thin at a<br>
portion where the knife edge is inserted. This makes it<br>
easy to insert the knife edge.<br>
The process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present invention is applied<br>
preferably further comprises a step of forming another<br>
recording layer on which information is to be recorded by<br>
applied light, on the interlayer having the concavo-<br>
convex shape transcribed thereon directly or via another<br>
layer. This makes it possible to produce a laminated<br>
multilayer optical recording medium efficiently.<br>
Further, the present invention provides a light<br>
transmitting stamper to be used for a process for<br>
producing an optical recording medium comprising a step<br>
of forming an interlayer by a photo polymerization<br>
process, which is formed from a nonpolar member having a<br>
transmittance of a light having a wavelength of from 3 00<br>
run to 400 run of at least 10%. The light transmitting<br>
stamper has a thickness of preferably from 0.3 mm to 5<br>
mm. When the thickness of the light transmitting stamper<br>
is within the above range, the ultraviolet-curing resin<br>
or the like can efficiently be cured, and the<br>
productivity will improve. Further, the outer diameter<br>
of the light transmitting stapmer is larger than the<br>
outer diameter of the optical recording medium. When the<br>
outer diameter of the light transmitting stamper is<br>
larger than the outer diameter of the optical recording<br>
medium, even if an outer burr is generated in production<br>
of the interlayer, it will easily be removed.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, the production<br>
efficiency of a laminated multilayer optical recording<br>
medium by a 2P process will improve.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, best mode of carrying out the invention<br>
(hereinafter referred to as embodiment of the invention)<br>
will be explained in detail below. However, needless to<br>
say, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
following embodiment, and various modifications are<br>
possible within a range of the gist.<br>
PREFERRED MODE OF THE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM TO WHICH THE PRESENT MODE IS<br>
APPLIED<br>
Fig. 1 is drawings illustrating one preferred<br>
example of the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present embodiment is applied. Fig.<br>
1 illustrates, as an example of a process for producing a<br>
laminated multilayer optical recording medium, a process<br>
for producing a dual layer type one-side incident type<br>
optical recording medium (dual DVD-R or dual DVD<br>
recordable disk) having two recording layers containing<br>
an organic pigment.<br>
A dual optical recording medium 10 0 as represented<br>
by a dual DVD-R as shown in Fig. 1(f) comprises a disk-<br>
shape light transmitting first substrate 101, and a first<br>
recording layer 102 containing a dye, a translucent first<br>
reflective layer 103, a light transmitting interlayer 104<br>
made of an ultraviolet-curing resin, a second recording<br>
layer 105 containing a dye, a second reflective layer<br>
106, an adhesive layer 107 and a second substrate 108<br>
forming an outermost layer, laminated in this order on<br>
the first substrate 101. On each of the first substrate<br>
101 and the interlayer 104, concaves and convexes are<br>
formed and constitute recording trucks.<br>
Recording/retrieving of optical information on the<br>
optical recording medium 10 0 as a dual DVD-R is carried<br>
out by a laser beam 109 applied to the first recording<br>
layer 102 and the second recording layer 105 from the<br>
first substrate 101 side.<br>
In the process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present embodiment is applied, "light<br>
transmitting (or transparent)" means a light<br>
transmittance at a wavelength of light applied to<br>
record/retrieve optical information on the first<br>
recording layer 102 and the second recording layer 105<br>
containing a dye. Specifically, it means a transmittance<br>
of usually at least 3 0%, preferably at least 50%, more<br>
preferably at least 60%, at a wavelength of light for<br>
recording/retrieving. On the other hand, the<br>
transmittance at a wavelength of light for<br>
recording/retrieving is ideally 100%, but is usually a<br>
value of 99.9% or below.<br>
As shown in Fig. 1(a), a first substrate 101 having<br>
grooves, lands or prepits formed on the surface by<br>
concaves and convexes is prepared by e.g. injection<br>
molding using e.g. a nickel stamper. Then, a coating<br>
liquid containing an organic dye is applied to the<br>
surface having concaves and convexes of the first<br>
substrate 101 by spin coating or the like. Then, heating<br>
or the like is carried out to remove a solvent used for<br>
the coating liquid, to form a first recording layer 102.<br>
After the first recording layer 102 is formed, a first<br>
reflective layer 103 is formed on the first recording<br>
layer 102 by sputtering or deposition of a Ag alloy or<br>
the like. Such a product prepared by laminating the<br>
first recording layer 102 and the first reflective layer<br>
103 laminated in this order on the first substrate 101 is<br>
referred to as a data substrate 111. In this case, the<br>
data substrate 111 is transparent.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 1(b), a precursor of an<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin which is one of radiation-curing<br>
resins, for example, is applied to the entire surface of<br>
the first reflective layer 103 by spin coating or the<br>
like, to form a resin material layer (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "ultraviolet-curing resin material layer"<br>
for convenience of explanation) 104a. In the present<br>
invention, "radiation" includes electron radiation,<br>
ultraviolet radiation, visible radiation and infrared<br>
radiation.<br>
In this case, the precursor of an ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin is applied directly to the data substrate 111, but<br>
the process is not limited thereto. For example, another<br>
layer may be formed on the data substrate 111. The<br>
number of revolutions for spin coating is usually at a<br>
level of from 500 to 6,000 rpm.<br>
In the present embodiment, an ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin is used as an example of a material of the resin<br>
material layer. However, the material of the resin<br>
material layer is not limited to an ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin, and a thermosetting resin may, for example, be<br>
also used.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 1(c), a light transmitting<br>
stamper 110 having a concavo-convex shape is disposed on<br>
the ultraviolet-curing resin material layer 104a. In<br>
such a state, ultraviolet rays are applied from the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 side via the light transmitting<br>
stamper 110 to cure the ultraviolet-curing resin. After<br>
the ultraviolet-curing resin is sufficiently cured, the<br>
light transmitting stamper 110 is separated. By the<br>
above operation, an interlayer 104 (Fig. 1(d)) on which<br>
concaves and convexes of the light transmitting stamper<br>
110 are transcribed is formed on the surface of the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin. Disposition of the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 is adjusted so that the<br>
thickness of the ultraviolet-curing resin material layer<br>
104a will be within a predetermined range. Application<br>
of ultraviolet rays to cure the ultraviolet-curing resin<br>
material layer 104a is not limited to application from<br>
the light transmitting stamper 110 side. For example,<br>
application from the side surface of the ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin material layer 104a may, for example, be<br>
mentioned.<br>
The light transmitting stamper 110 used in the<br>
present embodiment comprises a nonpolar member having a<br>
concavo-convex shape on the surface. By using the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 comprising a nonpolar member,<br>
the interlayer 104 and the light transmitting stamper 110<br>
can easily be separated without applying a constrained<br>
load. Resultingly, a possibility of deformation of the<br>
first recording layer 102 and the first reflective layer<br>
103 reduces. Further, the uniformity on the surface of<br>
the interlayer 104 tends to be maintained, whereby signal<br>
waveform for recording/retrieving of optical information<br>
will be stabilized. Further, a residue of the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin hardly adheres to the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 side, whereby the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 is likely to be recycled.<br>
Here, "polar" means a state where electrons are<br>
locally present in a molecule and there is unevenness of<br>
charge. Further, "nonpolar" means a state where there is<br>
not such unevenness of charge.<br>
The nonpolar member constituting the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 may, for example, be an<br>
inorganic material or an organic material. The inorganic<br>
material may, for example, be inorganic glass. The<br>
organic material may, for example, be a polymer material<br>
having no polar group in its molecule. Particularly,<br>
when the light transmitting stamper 110 is formed by<br>
using a polymer material having no polar group in its<br>
molecule, it can be prepared by using a metal stamper<br>
(such as a nickel stamper) having a negative concavo-<br>
convex pattern by injection molding or the like.<br>
Such a polar group may, for example, be a polar<br>
group containing an oxygen atom, a polar group containing<br>
a nitrogen atom, a polar group containing a sulfur atom<br>
or a polar group containing a halogen atom.<br>
Specifically, the polar group containing an oxygen atom<br>
may, for example, be a hydroxyl group, an ether group, an<br>
aldehyde group, a carbonyl group, an acetyl group, a<br>
carboxyl group or an ester group. The polar group<br>
containing a nitrogen group may, for example, be an amino<br>
group, an imino group, an ammonium group, an amide group,<br>
an imide group, a nitro group, a nitroso group, a diazo<br>
group or an acrylonitro group. The polar group<br>
containing a sulfur atom may, for example, be a thiol<br>
group, a sulfide group or a sulfonic group. The polar<br>
group containing a halogen atom may, for example, be a<br>
chloro group, a chloromethyl group, a chlorosyl group, a<br>
chloryl group, a perchloryl group, a bromo group, an iodo<br>
group, an iodosyl group or a fluoro group. In the<br>
present invention, it is preferred to use a polymer<br>
material having no such polar group in its molecule.<br>
Further, the polymer material having no polar group in<br>
its molecule preferably has no unsaturated bond such as a<br>
carbon-carbon double bond, an aromatic monocyclic<br>
hydrocarbon group such as a phenyl group nor a condensed<br>
polycyclic hydrocarbon group such as a naphthyl group in<br>
its molecule.<br>
Usually, a Coulomb force (electrostatic force) works<br>
and the Van der Waals force (intermolecular attraction)<br>
is significant between molecules of a polymer material<br>
having a polar group in its molecule, since there is<br>
unevenness of charge in the polar group. Further,<br>
usually, a material to be used for a resin material layer<br>
such as an ultraviolet-curing resin has such a structure<br>
that a polar group is bonded to the molecule in many<br>
cases. In such a case, if a stamper formed from such a<br>
polymer material having a polar group in its molecule is<br>
used, the Van der Waals force between the stamper and the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin tends to be significant, and the<br>
stamper and the ultraviolet-curing resin tend to be<br>
hardly separated. Accordingly, by use of a stamper made<br>
of a polymer material having no polar group in its<br>
molecule, the Van der Waals force tends to reduce, and<br>
the adhesion with the ultraviolet-curing resin tends to<br>
be weak. It is considered that the stamper and the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin will easily be separated<br>
resultingly.<br>
Here, the "polymer material having no polar group in<br>
its molecule" ideally means a polymer having no polar<br>
group at all in the basic structure of the polymer.<br>
The polymer material having no polar group in its<br>
molecule may, for example, be a polyolefin. The<br>
polyolefin has a simple structure consisting of carbon<br>
and hydrogen and thereby shows nonpolar characteristics.<br>
Accordingly, the polyolefin is easily separated from a<br>
radiation-curing resin such as an ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin or a thermosetting resin. Further, the polyolefin<br>
has such an advantage that it has a high light<br>
transmittance of a light having a short wavelength<br>
required for curing the radiation-curing resin. Further,<br>
the polyolefin also has such an advantage that no harmful<br>
gas or the like is discharged even if it is burned at the<br>
time of disposal after use, whereby it puts less burden<br>
on the environment.<br>
The polyolefin can be classified into a crystalline<br>
polyolefin and an amorphous polyolefin.<br>
More specifically, the polyolefin may, for example,<br>
be a polymer of an a-olefin or a polymer of a cyclic<br>
olefin. The polymer of an a-olefin may, for example, be<br>
a polyethylene, a polypropylene, an ethylene/propylene<br>
copolymer, or a copolymer of ethylene and an a-olefin<br>
having from 4 to 20 carbon atoms. Such an a-olefin<br>
having from 4 to 2 0 carbon atoms may, for example, be 1-<br>
butene, 1-pentene, 1-hexene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-<br>
heptene, 1-octene, 1-nonene, 1-decene, 1-undecene, 1-<br>
dodecene, 9-methyl-1-decene, 11-methyl-l-dodecene, 1-<br>
tetradecene, 1-hexadecene, 1-octadecene or 1-eicocene.<br>
The polymer of a cyclic olefin may, for example, be an<br>
amorphous polyolefin which is a hydrogenated product of a<br>
ring-opening polymer of a tetracyclododecene and a<br>
dicyclopenatadiene.<br>
Among the polyolefins, a polyethylene, a<br>
polypropylene, an ethylene/propylene copolymer or an<br>
amorphous polyolefin is preferred. A polyethylene, a<br>
polypropylene and an ethylene/propylene copolymer are<br>
slightly poor in transparency since they are highly<br>
crystalline, but they can be formed at a low cost.<br>
Particularly, a polypropylene and an ethylene/propylene<br>
copolymer, which are excellent also in heat resistance<br>
and fatigue resistance (hinge properties), are preferred.<br>
Most preferred is a polypropylene.<br>
Further, the amorphous polyolefin is excellent in<br>
transparency and precision moldability due to its<br>
amorphous properties. The amorphous polyolefin is<br>
preferably commercial products by the tradenames of<br>
ZEONEX and ZEONOR (manufactured by ZEON CORPORATION), for<br>
example.<br>
The crystalline polyolefin such as a polyethylene, a<br>
polypropylene or an ethylene/propylene copolymer is<br>
widely used as a general molding material. Accordingly,<br>
the crystalline polyolefin can be available at a lower<br>
cost than the amorphous polyolefin. Accordingly, by use<br>
of the crystalline polyolefin, the cost for production of<br>
a laminated multilayer optical recording medium can be<br>
reduced.<br>
Further, such a crystalline polyolefin is excellent<br>
in fatigue resistance (hinge properties) as compared with<br>
an amorphous polyolefin. The following advantages will<br>
be obtained due to excellence in fatigue resistance<br>
(hinge properties) of a crystalline polyolefin. That is,<br>
the light transmitting stamper is partially deformed in a<br>
step of separating the light transmitting stamper. Thus,<br>
when the light transmitting stamper is used repeatedly,<br>
the light transmitting stamper is deformed repeatedly. A<br>
light transmitting stamper prepared from a crystalline<br>
polyolefin is excellent in fatigue resistance (hinge<br>
properties) as compared with a light transmitting stamper<br>
prepared from an amorphous polyolefin, and is less likely<br>
to be cracked even if it is repeatedly used and<br>
repeatedly deformed.<br>
Among the above crystalline polyolefins, a<br>
polypropylene or an ethylene/propylene copolymer, which<br>
is particularly excellent in fatigue resistance (hinge<br>
properties) and heat resistance, is preferred.<br>
With respect to the fluidity of the nonpolar member,<br>
the melt flow rate (MFR) in a molten state is at least 20<br>
g/10 min., preferably at least 30 g/10 min., more<br>
preferably at least 40 g/10 min. However, it is usually<br>
at most 100 g/10 min. When the fluidity of the nonpolar<br>
member is within this range, excellent transcribability<br>
of the concavo-convex shape will be obtained. That is,<br>
when MFR is within the above range, a stamper can easily<br>
be formed by injection molding or the like.<br>
Here, MFR represents a value measured within a<br>
temperature range of at least the melting point and at<br>
most the decomposition temperature of the nonpolar member<br>
at a load of 21.18 N in accordance with IS01133.<br>
Particularly with respect to a polypropylene and an<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymer, it is a value measured at a<br>
temperature of 23 0°C in accordance with JIS K6921-1.<br>
Further, with respect to the light transmittance of<br>
the nonpolar member, the transmittance of a test specimen<br>
with a thickness of 0.6 mm of a light having a wavelength<br>
of from 300 to 400 nm is usually at least 10%, preferably<br>
at least 30%, more preferably at least 50%. On the other<br>
hand, the transmittance of the nonpolar member is<br>
preferably as high as possible, but is usually 99.9% or<br>
below.<br>
Further, when the polymer material is used as the<br>
nonpolar member, the light transmitting stamper may<br>
contain, in addition to the nonpolar polymer material, a<br>
small amount of a releasing agent, an antistatic agent or<br>
impurities. In such a case, the proportion of the<br>
nonpolar polymer material in the light transmitting<br>
stamper is preferably at least 95 wt%, more preferably at<br>
least 98 wt%, most preferably at least 99 wt%. However,<br>
when a material other than the nonpolar polymer material<br>
is used, the upper limit of the content of the nonpolar<br>
polymer material is usually 99.999 wt%.<br>
The light transmitting stamper 110 used in the<br>
present embodiment preferably has a thickness of usually<br>
at least 0.3 mm in view of form stability and easiness of<br>
handling. However, the thickness is usually at most 5<br>
mm. When the thickness of the light transmitting stamper<br>
110 is within this range, the stamper has sufficient<br>
light transmittance, whereby the ultraviolet-curing resin<br>
or the like can be efficiently cured even when<br>
ultraviolet rays are applied via the light transmitting<br>
stamper 110, and the productivity will improve.<br>
The outer diameter of the light transmitting stamper<br>
110 is preferably larger than the outer diameter of the<br>
first substrate 101 (outer diameter of the optical<br>
recording medium 100). When the outer diameter of the<br>
light transmitting stamper 110 is preliminarily designed<br>
to be larger than the outer diameter of the first<br>
substrate 101, the concavo-convex shape can be formed<br>
even on the peripheral portion of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 110 extending beyond the outer diameter of the<br>
first substrate 101 with a good margin at the time of<br>
injection molding, whereby the concavo-convex shape can<br>
be favorably formed over the entire surface of the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110. Further, when the outer<br>
diameter of the light transmitting stamper 110 is larger<br>
than the outer diameter of the first substrate 101, the<br>
outer diameter of the light transmitting stamper 110<br>
becomes larger than the outer diameter of the interlayer<br>
104 (ultraviolet-curing resin material layer 104a). This<br>
makes it possible that the shape of the edge surface of<br>
the interlayer 104 is favorable. That is, when the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 is disposed on the ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin material layer 104a, a resin of the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin material layer 104a may adhere<br>
to the outer peripheral portion of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 110. This resin may form a burr when the light<br>
transmitting stamper is separated. Accordingly, when the<br>
outer diameter of the light transmitting stamper 110 is<br>
larger than the outer diameter of the interlayer 104<br>
(ultraviolet-curing resin material layer 104a), the resin<br>
present at the edge of the ultraviolet-curing resin<br>
material layer 104a which is likely to form a burr is<br>
present beyond the outer diameter of the interlayer 104.<br>
As a result, even if a burr is generated, a portion where<br>
the burr is generated can be removed so as to obtain a<br>
favorable shape of the edge of the interlayer 104.<br>
Specifically, the outer diameter of the light<br>
transmitting stamper 110 is larger than the outer<br>
diameter of the first substrate 101 by usually at least 1<br>
mm, preferably at least 2 mm by diameter. However, it is<br>
usually at most 15 mm, preferably at most 10 mm by<br>
diameter.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 1(d), a coating liquid<br>
containing an organic dye is applied to the surface of<br>
the interlayer 104 by spin coating or the like. Then,<br>
heating or the like is carried out to remove a solvent<br>
used for the coating liquid to form a second recording<br>
layer 105. In such a case, the heating temperature is<br>
preferably at least the glass transition temperature of<br>
the resin constituting the interlayer 104. By heating at<br>
the above temperature, it is possible to suppress warpage<br>
of the first substrate 101 considered to be due to<br>
shrinkage of the interlayer 104. In the present<br>
embodiment, the second recording layer 105 is formed<br>
directly on the interlayer 104. However, needless to<br>
say, the second recording layer 10 5 may be formed via<br>
another layer (such as a protective layer or a buffer<br>
layer) . By the above step, a laminated multilayer<br>
optical recording medium can be efficiently produced.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 1(e), a second reflective<br>
layer 106 is formed on the second recording layer 105 by<br>
depositing a Ag alloy or the like by sputtering. Then,<br>
as shown in Fig. 1(f), a second substrate 108 as a mirror<br>
substrate obtained by injection molding of a<br>
polycarbonate is bonded to the second reflective layer<br>
106 via an adhesive layer 107 to complete production of<br>
the optical recording medium 100.<br>
The adhesive layer 107 may be translucent or may<br>
have a slightly rough surface, and further, a delayed<br>
curing adhesive may also be used without any problem.<br>
For example, the adhesive layer 107 can be formed by<br>
applying an adhesive to the second reflective layer 106<br>
by screen printing or the like, applying ultraviolet rays<br>
thereto, and then disposing the second substrate 108,<br>
followed by pressing. Further, the adhesive layer 107<br>
may be formed also by interposing a pressure sensitive<br>
double coated adhesive tape between the second reflective<br>
layer 106 and the second substrate 108, followed by<br>
pressing.<br>
The layer structure shown in Fig. 1(f) illustrates<br>
one example of an optical recording medium having two<br>
recording layers as mentioned above. Accordingly,<br>
needless to say, another layer not shown in Fig. 1(f) may<br>
be used (for example, a primary layer is inserted between<br>
the first substrate 101 and the first recording layer<br>
102) .<br>
MORE PREFERRED MODE OF THE PROCESS FOR PRODUCING AN<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM TO WHICH THE PRESENT MODE IS<br>
APPLIED<br>
In the present mode, the outer diameter of the light<br>
transmitting stamper is preferably larger than the outer<br>
diameter of the first substrate. This will be explained<br>
in further detail below with reference to the disposition<br>
and separation of the light transmitting stamper.<br>
Fig. 3 is drawings illustrating one example of<br>
disposition and separation of a light transmitting<br>
stamper. Fig. 3 illustrates one example of disposition<br>
of a light transmitting stamper 310 and a state after<br>
separation of the light transmitting stamper 310 in a<br>
case where the outer diameter of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 310 is the same as the outer diameter of the<br>
first substrate 101 and thus the outer diameter of a data<br>
substrate 111. The data substrate 111 has such a<br>
structure that on a first substrate 101, a first<br>
recording layer 102 and a first reflective layer 103 are<br>
laminated in this order.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3(a), when the light transmitting<br>
stamper 310 is disposed on a resin material layer 304a,<br>
the resin material layer 3 04a may protrude toward the<br>
light transmitting stamper side to form an outer burr<br>
resin material layer 3 01a. This happens because the<br>
resin material layer 3 04a (usually formed from an<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin) has not been cured yet but has<br>
fluidity. Then, as shown in Fig. 3(b), the resin<br>
material layer 304a (Fig. 3(a)) and the outer burr resin<br>
material layer 301a (Fig. 3(a)) are cured and then the<br>
light transmitting stamper 310 is separated, whereby an<br>
outer burr 301 is formed on the interlayer 304. This<br>
outer burr 3 01 is formed in a region very close to the<br>
outer diameter of the data substrate 111 since the outer<br>
diameter of the light transmitting stamper 310 and the<br>
outer diameter of the data substrate 111 are the same.<br>
Further, the outer burr 3 01 is very small as compared<br>
with the size of the interlayer 304. For example, the<br>
diameter of the interlayer 3 04 is 12 0 mm, whereas the<br>
size of the outer burr 3 01 is at a level of several tens<br>
urn. Accordingly, it may be industrially difficult to<br>
remove only the outer burr 3 01 to obtain a favorable edge<br>
shape of the interlayer 3 04 in some cases.<br>
In a case where such an outer burr 3 01 is generated,<br>
the outer diameter of the light transmitting stamper 310<br>
is preferably larger than the outer diameter of the first<br>
substrate 101 and thus the outer diameter of the data<br>
substrate 111. This will be explained below with<br>
reference to Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4 is drawings illustrating another example of<br>
disposition and separation of a light transmitting<br>
stamper. Fig. 4 illustrates one example of disposition<br>
of a light transmitting stamper 410 and a state after<br>
separation of the light transmitting stamper 410 in a<br>
case where the outer diameter of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 410 is larger than the outer diameter of a first<br>
substrate 101 and thus the outer diameter of a data<br>
substrate 111. The data substrate 111 has such a<br>
structure that on the first substrate 101, a first<br>
recording layer 102 and a first reflective layer 103 are<br>
laminated in this order.<br>
In Fig. 4(a), the outer diameter of the light<br>
transmitting stamper 410 is larger than the first<br>
substrate 101 and thus the data substrate 111.<br>
Accordingly, when the light transmitting stamper 410 is<br>
disposed on a resin material layer 404a, the edge of the<br>
resin material 404a extends and protrudes toward the<br>
outer peripheral direction of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 410 to form an outer burr resin material layer<br>
401a. This happens because the resin material layer 404a<br>
(usually formed from an ultraviolet-curing resin) has not<br>
been cured yet but has fluidity.<br>
Since the outer diameter of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 410 is larger than the data substrate 111, the<br>
outer burr resin material layer 401a largely extends<br>
beyond the outer diameter of the data substrate 111.<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 4(b), the resin material layer<br>
404a (Fig. 4(a)) and the outer burr resin material layer<br>
401a (Fig. 4(a)) are cured and then the light<br>
transmitting stamper 410 is separated, whereby an outer<br>
burr 401 is formed on the interlayer 404. This outer<br>
burr 4 01 largely extends beyond the outer diameter of the<br>
data substrate 111 (outer diameter of the interlayer 404)<br>
similarly to the outer burr resin material layer 401a<br>
(Fig. 4(a)). Accordingly, it tends to be easy to remove<br>
the outer burr 401 present in a region outside arrows<br>
42 0a and 42 0b to obtain a favorable edge shape of the<br>
interlayer 404.<br>
Specific examples wherein a favorable edge shape of<br>
the interlayer 404 tends to be easily obtained in a case<br>
where the outer diameter of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 410 is larger than the outer diameter of the<br>
first substrate 101 and thus the outer diameter of the<br>
data substrate 111, will be further explained below.<br>
Fig. 5 is drawings illustrating still another<br>
example of disposition and separation of a light<br>
transmitting stamper. Fig. 5 illustrates one example of<br>
disposition of a light transmitting stamper 510 and a<br>
state after separation of the light transmitting stamper<br>
510 in a case where the outer diameter of the light<br>
transmitting stamper 510 is larger than the outer<br>
diameter of a first substrate 101 and thus the outer<br>
diameter of a data substrate 111. The data substrate 111<br>
has such a structure that on the first substrate 101, a<br>
first recording layer 102 and a first reflective layer<br>
103 are laminated in this order.<br>
In Fig. 5(a), another resin material layer 504a2 is<br>
formed on the surface having a concavo-convex shape of<br>
the light transmitting stamper 510. The light<br>
transmitting stamper 510 is disposed so that the resin<br>
material layer 504a2 and a resin material layer 504al<br>
formed on the data substrate 111 face each other. The<br>
resin material layer 504a2 formed on the light<br>
transmitting stamper 510 has an outer diameter larger<br>
than the outer diameter of the data substrate 111 (first<br>
substrate 101) by the dimension of an outer resin<br>
material layer 505a. Accordingly, the resin material<br>
layer 5 04a2 largely extends beyond the outer diameter of<br>
the data substrate 111. Therefore, an outer burr resin<br>
material layer 501a is formed outside the resin material<br>
layer 504a2 (outside the outer resin material layer<br>
505a).<br>
Then, as shown in Fig. 5(a), the resin material<br>
layer 504al (Fig. 5(a)), the resin material layer 504a2<br>
(Fig. 5(a)) and the outer burr resin material layer 501a<br>
(Fig. 5(a)) are cured and then the light transmitting<br>
stamper 510 is separated, whereby an outer burr 501 is<br>
formed on the interlayer 504. The outer burr 501 is<br>
formed further outside an outer interlayer 505 largely<br>
extending beyond the outer diameter of the data substrate<br>
111. Accordingly, the outer interlayer 505 present<br>
outside the outer diameter of the data substrate 111 is<br>
likely to be removed from the positions shown by arrows<br>
520a and 520b. As a result, as shown in Fig. 5, an<br>
interlayer 5044 having a favorable edge shape is likely<br>
to be obtained in view of industrial production.<br>
In Figs. 4 and 5, the interlayer (the outer burr 401<br>
in Fig. 4(b) or the outer interlayer 505 and the outer<br>
burr 501 in Fig. 5(b)) formed beyond the outer diameter<br>
of the first substrate 101 and thus the data substrate<br>
111, usually has to be cut off from the interlayer 404<br>
(Fig. 4(b)) or 5044 (Fig. 5(b)) having an outer diameter<br>
substantially the same as the outer diameter of the first<br>
substrate 101 and thus the data substrate 111, as<br>
described above.<br>
Removal of the outer burr 401 (Fig. 4(b)), or the<br>
outer interlayer 505 and the outer burr 501 (Fig. 5(b)),<br>
formed beyond the outer diameter, may be carried out<br>
either before or after separation of the light<br>
transmitting stamper 410 or 510. In view of production<br>
efficiency and with a view to improving dimensional<br>
accuracy of the outer diameter of the interlayer 404<br>
(Fig. 4(b)) or 5044 (Fig. 5(b)), the interlayer formed<br>
beyond the outer diameter is removed preferably before<br>
separation of the light transmitting stamper 410 or 510.<br>
That is, since the interlayer 404 (Fig. 4(b)) or 5044<br>
(Fig. 5(b)) is usually thin (usually at a level of<br>
several tens µm) , it may be industrially difficult to<br>
remove the interlayer with high accuracy in some cases.<br>
Further, if the outer burr 401 (Fig. 4(b)) or the outer<br>
interlayer 505 and the outer burr 501 (Fig. 5(b)) are<br>
removed after separation of the light transmitting<br>
stamper 410 or 510, the removed portion is likely to<br>
adhere to the optical recording medium as a foreign<br>
matter (dust).<br>
The method of removing the interlayer formed beyond<br>
the outer diameter of the data substrate 111 or the first<br>
substrate 101 (it means the outer burr 401 in Fig. 4(b),<br>
or the outer interlayer 505 and the outer burr 501 in<br>
Fig. 5(b), and hereinafter both will be referred to as<br>
"protruding interlayer" in some cases) is not<br>
particularly limited. Such a method may, for example, be<br>
a method of dissolving the protruding interlayer with a<br>
solvent, a method of mechanically polishing the<br>
protruding interlayer, a method of mechanically cutting<br>
the protruding interlayer or a method of optically<br>
removing the protruding interlayer. Among these methods,<br>
preferred is an optical removal method in view of<br>
favorable accuracy of the edge shape and industrial<br>
usability. The optical removal method is preferably a<br>
method of removing the protruding interlayer by<br>
application of a laser beam.<br>
That is, for example, a method may be mentioned<br>
wherein a laser beam is applied to a space between the<br>
protruding interlayer and the outer diameter of the<br>
interlayer 404 (Fig. 4(b)) or 5044 (Fig. 5(b)) (the outer<br>
diameter substantially the same as the outer diameter of<br>
the data substrate 111 or the first substrate 101) to cut<br>
off the protruding interlayer and separating it together<br>
with the light transmitting stamper 410 or 510<br>
(hereinafter this method will be referred to as "laser<br>
trimming" in some cases). The laser used is not<br>
particularly limited so long as it can be used in<br>
industrial production. Preferred as a laser having a<br>
power which will not impair the edge shape of the<br>
interlayer 404 (Fig. 4(b)) or 5044 (Fig. 5(b)) and the<br>
light transmitting stamper 410 or 510, is a CO2 laser<br>
(wavelength: 10.6 urn). A CO2 laser output apparatus is<br>
not particularly limited so long as it is industrially<br>
commonly used. The power of the CO2 laser is also not<br>
particularly limited so long as the protruding portion of<br>
the interlayer 404 (Fig. 4(b)) or 5044 (Fig. 5(b)) can be<br>
removed, and suitably adjusted.<br>
Further, the laser trimming may be carried out<br>
either by rotating the laser with the data substrate 111<br>
on which the interlayer 404 (Fig. 4(b)) or 5044 (Fig.<br>
5(b)) laminated thereon fixed, or by rotating the data<br>
substrate 111 on which the interlayer 404 (Fig. 4(b)) or<br>
5044 (Fig. 5(b)) is laminated, with the laser application<br>
position fixed. The latter method is industrially simple<br>
(the apparatus is likely to be simplified).<br>
Now, one specific example of the laser trimming will<br>
be explained below.<br>
Fig. 6 is drawings illustrating one example of laser<br>
trimming and separation of a light transmitting stamper.<br>
Fig. 6(a) is a drawing illustrating such a state that a<br>
light transmitting stamper 610 is disposed on a resin<br>
material layer (not shown in Fig. 6(a)) as shown in Fig.<br>
4(a), and then the resin material layer (not shown in<br>
Fig. 6(a)) is cured to form an interlayer 604, and then<br>
the protruding interlayer (outer burr 601) is removed by<br>
laser trimming. Fig. 6(b) illustrates a state where the<br>
light transmitting stamper 610 is separated after the<br>
laser trimming. A data substrate 111 has such a<br>
structure that on a first substrate 101, a recording<br>
layer 102 and a first recording layer 103 are laminated<br>
in this order.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6(a), a laser is applied from a<br>
laser application apparatus (not shown in Fig. 6(a))<br>
along the outer diameter of the interlayer 604 (the outer<br>
diameter substantially the same as a data substrate 111<br>
or a substrate 101) to form the outer diameter of the<br>
interlayer 604. In this case, the outer periphery of the<br>
interlayer 604 can be formed, for example, by rotating<br>
the data substrate 111. Then, as shown in Fig. 6(b), the<br>
light transmitting stamper 610 is separated.<br>
Fig. 7 is drawings illustrating another example of<br>
laser trimming and separation of a light transmitting<br>
stamper. Fig. 7(a) is a drawing illustrating a state<br>
where a light transmitting stamper 710 is disposed on a<br>
resin material layer (not shown in Fig. 7(a)) as shown in<br>
Fig. 5(a), and then the resin material layer (not shown<br>
in Fig. 7(a)) is cured to form an interlayer 704, and<br>
then the protruding interlayer (an outer interlayer 7 05<br>
and an outer burr 7 01) is removed by laser trimming.<br>
Fig. 7(b) illustrates a state where the light<br>
transmitting stamper 710 is separated after the laser<br>
trimming.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7(a), a laser is applied from a<br>
laser application apparatus (not. shown in Fig. 7(a))<br>
along the outer diameter of the interlayer 7 04 (the outer<br>
diameter substantially the same as the data substrate 111<br>
or a first substrate 101) to form the outer diameter of<br>
the interlayer 704. In this case, the outer periphery of<br>
the interlayer 704 can be formed, for example, by<br>
rotating the data substrate 111. Then, as shown in Fig.<br>
7(b), the light transmitting stamper 710 is separated.<br>
In Fig. 7, the outer interlayer 7 05 is made large,<br>
whereby the protruding interlayer (the outer interlayer<br>
705 and the outer burr 701) is easily removed.<br>
Now, the method of separating the light transmitting<br>
stamper will be explained in detail below. The method of<br>
separating the light transmitting stamper is not<br>
particularly limited, but preferred is a method of<br>
inserting a jig such as a knife edge between the<br>
substrate and the light transmitting stamper to separate<br>
the light transmitting stamper. By use of a jig such as<br>
a knife edge, the light transmitting stamper can be<br>
industrially easily separated.<br>
A method of separating the light transmitting<br>
stamper by inserting a knife edge, as one example, will<br>
be explained with reference to Figs. 8 and 9 below.<br>
Fig. 8 is a perspective view and a cross-sectional<br>
view illustrating one example of a state where a light<br>
transmitting stamper is disposed. Fig. 8(a) is a<br>
perspective view illustrating a state where a light<br>
transmitting stamper 810 having a planer circular shape<br>
is disposed on a data substrate 111 having a planer<br>
circular shape. Fig. 8(b) is a cross-sectional view at<br>
A-A' in Fig. 8(a). Further, Fig. 9 is drawings<br>
illustrating one example of a method of separating a<br>
light transmitting stamper and a data substrate. Fig. 9<br>
illustrates the separation of a light transmitting<br>
stamper using a knife edge shown in Fig. 8. In Figs. 8<br>
and 9, no recording layer nor reflective layer are shown<br>
for understandability of figures.<br>
In Fig. 8(a), on the data substrate 111 having a<br>
planer circular shape, an interlayer 8 04 having an inner<br>
diameter larger than the inner diameter of the substrate<br>
111 is formed. Further, the light transmitting stamper<br>
810 having a planer circular shape, having an inner<br>
diameter smaller than the inner diameter of the<br>
interlayer 804 and having an outer diameter larger than<br>
the outer diameter of the data substrate 111 (interlayer<br>
804) is disposed on the interlayer 804. The planer<br>
circular shape means a disk shape having a hole with a<br>
predetermined length from the center of the circle, such<br>
as CD or DVD (see Fig. 8(a)).<br>
Separation of the light transmitting stamper 810 is<br>
carried out by inserting a knife edge between the data<br>
substrate 111 and the light transmitting stamper 810<br>
(shown by arrows 811 in Fig. 8(b)) from the inner<br>
diameter side of the data substrate 111 and the light<br>
transmitting stamper 810. The method of inserting a<br>
knife edge from the inner diameter side is a method which<br>
is advantageous also in industrial production.<br>
More specifically, as shown in Figs. 9(a) and 9(b),<br>
a knife edge 92 0 is inserted between the data substrate<br>
111 and the light transmitting stamper 910 to partially<br>
separate the light transmitting stamper 910. Then, as<br>
shown in Fig. 9(c), the data substrate 111 and the light<br>
transmitting stamper 910 are gradually detached while<br>
compressed air is injected, to completely separate the<br>
light transmitting stamper 910.<br>
Fig. 10 is a drawing illustrating another example of<br>
the method of separating the light transmitting stamper<br>
and the data substrate. Fig. 10 is an enlarged cross-<br>
sectional view illustrating a laminate comprising a light<br>
transmitting stamper 1010, an interlayer 1004 and a data<br>
substrate 111 when a knife edge 1020 is inserted. In<br>
Fig. 10, no recording layer nor reflective layer is shown<br>
for understandability of the figure. As shown in Fig.<br>
10, the light transmitting stamper 1010 at a portion<br>
where the knife edge 1020 is inserted is made thin,<br>
whereby the knife edge 1020 is favorably inserted.<br>
OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM TO WHICH THE PRESENT<br>
EMBODIMENT IS APPLIED<br>
In the present embodiment, the process for producing<br>
a laminated multilayer optical recording medium has been<br>
explained with reference to a dual layer type dual DVD-R<br>
having two recording layers containing an organic dye as<br>
an example, but is not limited thereto. Namely, effects<br>
of the present invention will be favorably obtained so<br>
long as the optical recording medium is an optical<br>
recording medium or a laminate for an optical recording<br>
medium produced by a production process comprising a step<br>
of applying a resin material layer on a data substrate<br>
directly or via another layer, attaching a light<br>
transmitting stamper having a concavo-convex shape<br>
thereto and then separating it so that the concavo-convex<br>
shape of the light transmitting stamper is transcribed on<br>
the resin to form a resin layer. Namely, by use of a<br>
light transmitting stamper comprising a nonpolar member,<br>
the production process of the present embodiment can be<br>
applied to an optical recording medium having another<br>
structure.<br>
For example, the production process of the present<br>
embodiment can be applied to an optical recording medium<br>
having only one recording layer. Further, it can be<br>
applied to an optical recording medium having three or<br>
more recording layers and having two or more interlayers.<br>
In such a case, the production process of the present<br>
embodiment can be applied to formation of each of the two<br>
or more interlayers. Further, in the above-described<br>
embodiment, the process for producing a so-called<br>
substrate face incident type optical recording medium has<br>
been explained. However, needless to say, it can be<br>
applied to a process for producing a so-called film face<br>
incident type optical recording medium.<br>
Now, layers constituting a dual optical recording<br>
medium 10 0 as represented by a dual DVD-R as shown in<br>
Fig. 1(f) will be briefly explained below.<br>
FIRST SUBSTRATE<br>
The first substrate 101 is preferably excellent in<br>
optical characteristics such that it has optical<br>
transmittance, it has a small birefringence, etc.<br>
Further, the first substrate 101 is preferably excellent<br>
in moldability such that it can easily be formed by<br>
injection molding. Further, the first substrate 101<br>
preferably has small moisture absorption properties.<br>
Still further, the first substrate 101 preferably has<br>
form stability so that the optical recording medium has a<br>
certain level of rigidity. A material constituting the<br>
first substrate 101 is not particularly limited, and an<br>
acrylic resin, a methacrylic resin, a polycarbonate<br>
resin, a polyolefin resin (particularly amorphous<br>
polyolefin), a polyester resin, a polystyrene resin, an<br>
epoxy resin or glass may, for example, be mentioned. The<br>
thickness of the first substrate 101 is usually at most 2<br>
mm, preferably at most 1 mm. When the distance between<br>
an objective lens and a recording layer is smaller and<br>
the substrate is thinner, coma aberration tends to be<br>
small, and the recording density tends to be high.<br>
However, the thickness is usually at least 10 µm,<br>
preferably at least 30 urn, so as to obtain sufficient<br>
optical characteristics, low moisture absorption<br>
properties, moldability and form stability.<br>
FIRST RECORDING LAYER<br>
The first recording layer 102 is usually required to<br>
have a higher sensitivity as compared with a recording<br>
layer used in an optical recording medium to be used for<br>
CD-R, dual DVD-R, etc. In the optical recording medium<br>
100 to which the present embodiment is applied, the power<br>
of an applied laser beam 109 reduces to half by e.g.<br>
presence of a first reflective layer 103 as described<br>
hereinafter and recording is carried out at an about half<br>
power, and accordingly a particularly high sensitivity is<br>
required. Further, as a dye to be used for the first<br>
recording layer 102, preferred is a dye compound having a<br>
maximum absorption wavelength ?max in a region of visible<br>
light at a level of from 3 50 to 9 00 nm to an infrared<br>
ray, suitable for recording by a blue to near microwave<br>
laser. Usually, preferred as the dye compound is, for<br>
example, a dye suitable for recording with a near<br>
infrared laser having a wavelength at a level of from 77 0<br>
to 83 0 nm such as one used for CD-R, a dye suitable for<br>
recording with a red laser having a wavelength at a level<br>
of from 62 0 to 69 0 nm such as one used for DVD-R, or a<br>
dye suitable for recording with a so-called blue laser<br>
having a wavelength of 410 nm, 515 nm, or the like.<br>
The dye used for the first recording layer 102 is<br>
not particularly limited, and usually an organic dye<br>
material is used. The organic dye material may, for<br>
example, be a macrocyclic azaanulene dye (such as<br>
phthalocyanine dye, naphthalocyanine dye or porphyrin<br>
dye), a pyrromethene dye, a polymethine dye (such as<br>
cyanine dye, merocyanine dye or squarilium dye), an<br>
anthraquinone dye, an azulenium dye, a metal-containing<br>
azo dye or a metal-containing indoaniline dye. Such dyes<br>
may be used alone or as a mixture of two or more of them.<br>
The thickness of the first recording layer 102 is not<br>
particularly limited since a suitable film thickness<br>
varies depending upon the recording method or the like.<br>
However, it is usually at least 5 nm, preferably at least<br>
10 nm, particularly preferably at least 20 nm, so as to<br>
obtain a sufficient degree of modulation. However, it is<br>
usually at most 3 µm, preferably at most 1 urn, more<br>
preferably at most 200 nm so that light is transmitted.<br>
The method of forming the first recording layer 102 is<br>
not particularly limited, and usually, a thin film<br>
formation method which is commonly carried out, such as a<br>
vacuum deposition method, a sputtering method, a doctor<br>
blade method, a casting method, a spin coating method or<br>
a dipping method may be mentioned. The film formation<br>
method is preferably a wet film formation method such as<br>
a spin coating method in view of mass productivity and<br>
cost. Further, it is preferably a vacuum deposition<br>
method with a view to obtaining a uniform recording<br>
layer.<br>
FIRST REFLECTIVE LAYER<br>
The first reflective layer 103 is required to absorb<br>
a small amount of recording and retrieving light, to have<br>
a light transmittance of usually at least 40% and to have<br>
an appropriate reflectivity. For example, an appropriate<br>
transmittance can be obtained by thinly forming a metal<br>
having a high reflectivity. Further, it preferably has a<br>
certain level of corrosion resistance. Further, it<br>
preferably has barrier properties such that the first<br>
recording layer 102 is not influenced by bleeding of<br>
another component from the upper layer of the first<br>
reflective layer 103 (interlayer 104 in this case).<br>
The thickness of the first reflective layer 103 is<br>
usually at most 50 run, preferably at most 30 run, more<br>
preferably at most 2 0 run. Within the above range, a<br>
light transmittance of at least 40% tends to be easily<br>
achieved. However, the thickness of the first reflective<br>
layer 103 is usually at least 3 run, preferably at least 5<br>
run, so that the first recording layer 102 will not be<br>
influenced by the layer present on the first reflective<br>
layer 103.<br>
The material constituting the first reflective layer<br>
103 is not particularly limited, and is preferably one<br>
having an appropriately high reflectivity at a wavelength<br>
of retrieving light. For the first reflective layer 103,<br>
for example, a metal or a metalloid such as Au, Al, Ag,<br>
Cu, Ti, Cr, Ni, Pt, Ta, Pd, Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn,<br>
Re, Fe, Co, Rh, Ir, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po,<br>
Sn, Bi or a rare earth metal may be used alone or as an<br>
alloy.<br>
As a method of forming the first reflective layer<br>
103, a sputtering method, an ion plating method, a<br>
chemical deposition method or a vacuum deposition method<br>
may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
INTERLAYER<br>
The interlayer 104 is made of a transparent resin on<br>
which a concavo-convex shape such as grooves or pits can<br>
be formed and which has a high adhesive force. Further,<br>
a resin having a small shrinkage ratio at the time of<br>
curing for adhesion is preferred, with which the medium<br>
tends to have a high form stability. Further, the<br>
interlayer 104 is preferably made of a material which<br>
will not do damages to a second recording layer 105. The<br>
interlayer 104 is usually easily compatible with the<br>
second recording layer 105 in many cases. Accordingly,<br>
in order to prevent compatibilization of the interlayer<br>
104 with the second recording layer 105 to suppress<br>
damages to the second recording layer 105, it is<br>
preferred to form a proper buffer layer between these<br>
layers. Further, a buffer layer may be formed between<br>
the interlayer 104 and the first reflective layer 103.<br>
The thickness of the interlayer 104 is preferably<br>
controlled accurately, and a thickness of usually at<br>
least 5 µm, preferably at least 10 urn is required.<br>
However, the thickness is usually at most 100 urn,<br>
preferably at most 70 µm.<br>
On the interlayer 104, a concavo-convex shape is<br>
spirally or concentrically formed, and the concavo-convex<br>
shape forms grooves and lands. Usually, employing such<br>
grooves and/or lands as record tracks, information is<br>
recorded and retrieved on the second recording layer 105.<br>
The groove width is usually at a level of from 200 to 500<br>
µm, and the groove depth is at a level of from 120 to 250<br>
run. In a case where the record tracks are in a spiral<br>
form, the track pitch is preferably at a level of from<br>
0.1 to 2.0 µm.<br>
As a material constituting the interlayer 104, a<br>
thermoplastic resin, a thermosetting resin or a<br>
radiation-curing resin may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
An interlayer 104 made of a thermoplastic resin, a<br>
thermosetting resin or the like is formed in such a<br>
manner that a thermoplastic resin or the like is<br>
dissolved in a proper solvent to prepare a coating<br>
liquid, which was applied and dried (heated) to form the<br>
interlayer 104. An interlayer 104 made of a radiation-<br>
curing resin is formed in such a manner that the resin as<br>
it is or a coating liquid prepared by dissolving the<br>
resin in a proper solvent is applied and cured by<br>
application of a proper radiation. Such materials may be<br>
used alone or as mixed. Further, the interlayer 104 may<br>
be formed into a multilayer film. As a coating method, a<br>
coating method such as a spin coating method or a casting<br>
method may be employed, and among them, a spin coating<br>
method is preferred. An interlayer 104 made of a high<br>
viscous resin may be formed also by coating by means of a<br>
screen printing or the like. The radiation-curable resin<br>
is preferably one in a liquid form at from 20 to 40°C.<br>
Use of the radiation-curing resin improves productivity<br>
since it can be applied without using a solvent.<br>
Further, it is preferably prepared to have a viscosity of<br>
from 2 0 to 4,000 mPa•s.<br>
Among the materials of the interlayer 104, a<br>
radiation-curing resin is preferred, and among them, an<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin is preferred. When such a resin<br>
is employed, the concavo-convex shape of the light<br>
transmitting stamper is easily transcribed. The<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin may be a radical ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin (radical polymerizable ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin) and a cation ultraviolet-curing resin (cation<br>
polymerizable ultraviolet-curing resin), and both may be<br>
used. As the radical ultraviolet-curing resin, a<br>
composition containing an ultraviolet-curing compound and<br>
a photo polymerization initiator as essential components<br>
is used. As the radical ultraviolet-curing compound, a<br>
monofunctional (meth)acrylate and a polyfunctional<br>
(meth)acrylate may be used as polymerizable monomer<br>
components. These may be used alone or as a mixture of<br>
two or more of them in combination, respectively. Here,<br>
an acrylate and a methacrylate will generically be<br>
referred to as a (meth) acrylate. As the photo<br>
polymerization initiator, a molecular cleavage type or a<br>
hydrogen abstraction type is preferred. In the present<br>
invention, it is preferred that an uncured ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin precursor composed mainly of a radical<br>
polymerizable acrylate is cured to obtain an interlayer.<br>
The cationic ultraviolet-curing resin may, for<br>
example, be an epoxy resin containing a cation<br>
polymerizable photo polymerization initiator. The epoxy<br>
resin may, for example, be a bisphenol A-epichlorohydrin<br>
type, an alicyclic epoxy, a long chain aliphatic type, a<br>
brominated epoxy resin, a glycidyl ester type, a glycidyl<br>
ether type or a heterocyclic type. It is preferred to<br>
use as the epoxy resin one having small contents of free<br>
chlorine and chlorine ions. The amount of chlorine is<br>
preferably at most 1 wt%, more preferably at most 0.5<br>
wt%. The cation polymerizable photoinitiator may, for<br>
example, be a sulfonium salt, an iodonium salt or a<br>
diazonium salt.<br>
SECOND RECORDING LAYER<br>
The second recording layer 105 is, similar to the<br>
above-described first recording layer 102, usually<br>
required to have a higher sensitivity than a recording<br>
layer used for an optical recording medium such as CD-R<br>
or dual DVD-R. Further, the second recording layer 105<br>
is preferably made of a dye generating small heat and<br>
having a high refractivity so as to realize favorable<br>
recording and retrieving characteristics. Further, it is<br>
preferred that reflection and absorption of light are<br>
within proper ranges in combination of the second<br>
recording layer 105 and a second reflective layer 106.<br>
The material constituting the second recording layer 105,<br>
its formation method and the like may be the same as for<br>
the first recording layer 102. The method of forming the<br>
second recording layer 105 is preferably a wet film<br>
formation method. The thickness of the second recording<br>
layer 105 is not particularly limited since a suitable<br>
thickness varies depending upon the recording method and<br>
the like, and is usually at least 10 run, preferably at<br>
least 30 nm, particularly preferably at least 50 nm.<br>
However, in order to obtain a moderate reflectivity, the<br>
thickness of the second recording layer 105 is usually at<br>
most 3 urn, preferably at most 1 urn, more preferably at<br>
most 2 00 nm. The materials used for the first recording<br>
layer 102 and the second recording layer 105 may be the<br>
same or different.<br>
SECOND REFLECTIVE LAYER<br>
The second reflective layer 106 preferably has a<br>
high reflectivity and is highly durable. In order to<br>
secure a high reflectivity, the thickness of the second<br>
reflective layer 10 6 is usually at least 2 0 nm,<br>
preferably at least 30 nm, more preferably at least 50<br>
nm. However, in order to increase the recording<br>
sensitivity, it is usually at most 400 nm, preferably at<br>
most 300 nm.<br>
A material constituting the second reflective layer<br>
106 is preferably one having a sufficiently high<br>
reflectivity at the wavelength of the retrieving light.<br>
As the material constituting the second reflective layer<br>
106, for example, a metal such as Au, A1, Ag, Cu, Ti, Cr,<br>
Ni, Pt, Ta or Pd may be used alone or as an alloy. Among<br>
them, Au, Al and Ag which have a high reflectivity, are<br>
suitable as the material for the second reflective layer<br>
106. Further, in addition to such a metal as the main<br>
component, another component may be contained. Said<br>
another component may, for example, be a metal or a<br>
metalloid such as Mg, Se, Hf, V, Nb, Ru, W, Mn, Re, Fe,<br>
Co, Rh, Ir, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ga, In, Si, Ge, Te, Pb, Po, Sn,<br>
Bi or a rare earth metal. As a method of forming the<br>
second reflective layer 106, a sputtering method, an ion<br>
plating method, a chemical deposition method or a vacuum<br>
deposition method may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Further, a known inorganic or organic interlayer or<br>
adhesive layer may be formed on or under the second<br>
reflective layer 106 for the purpose of improving the<br>
reflectivity, improving recording characteristics,<br>
improving adhesion, etc.<br>
ADHESIVE LAYER<br>
The adhesive layer 107 preferably has a high<br>
adhesion force and a small shrinkage ratio when it is<br>
cured for adhesion, whereby the medium tends to have a<br>
high form stability. Further, the adhesive layer 107 is<br>
preferably made of a material doing no damage to the<br>
second reflective layer 106. Further, in order to<br>
suppress the damage, a known inorganic or organic<br>
protective layer may be formed between these layers. The<br>
thickness of the adhesive layer 107 is usually at least 2<br>
µm, preferably at least 5 µm. However, the thickness of<br>
the adhesive layer 107 is usually at most 100 µm so as to<br>
make the optical recording medium as thin as possible,<br>
and to overcome such a problem that curing takes long,<br>
thus decreasing the productivity. The material of the<br>
adhesive layer 107 may be the same as the material of the<br>
interlayer 104. Further, as the adhesive layer 107, a<br>
pressure sensitive double coated adhesive tape or the<br>
like may also be used. The adhesive layer 107 can be<br>
formed by sandwiching the pressure sensitive double<br>
coated adhesive tape between the second reflective layer<br>
106 and the second substrate 108, followed by pressing.<br>
SECOND SUBSTRATE<br>
The second substrate 10 8 preferably has high<br>
mechanical stability and has high rigidity. Further, it<br>
preferably has high adhesion with the adhesive layer 107.<br>
As such a material, the same material as one which can be<br>
used for the first substrate 101 may be used. Further,<br>
as the above material, an A1 alloy substrate of e.g. an<br>
A1-Mg alloy containing A1 as the main component, a Mg<br>
alloy substrate of e.g. a Mg-Zn alloy containing Mg as<br>
the main component, a substrate made of one of silicon,<br>
titanium and ceramics, or a substrate comprising a<br>
combination thereof may, for example, be also used. The<br>
material of the second substrate 108 is preferably a<br>
polycarbonate in view of high productivity such as<br>
moldability, cost, low moisture absorption properties,<br>
form stability, etc. The material of the second<br>
substrate 108 is preferably an amorphous polyolefin in<br>
view of chemical resistance, low moisture absorption<br>
properties, etc. Further, the material of the second<br>
substrate 108 is preferably a glass substrate in view of<br>
high responsibility, etc. In order that the optical<br>
recording medium 10 0 has sufficient rigidity, the second<br>
substrate 108 is preferably thick to a certain extent,<br>
and the thickness of the second substrate 108 is<br>
preferably at least 0.3 mm. However, it is at most 3 mm,<br>
preferably at most 1.5 mm.<br>
OTHER LAYERS<br>
The optical recording medium 100 may have another<br>
optional layer sandwiched between layers as the case<br>
requires, in the above laminated structure. Otherwise,<br>
another optional layer may be formed on the outermost<br>
layer of the medium. Further, the optical recording<br>
medium 100 may have a print-receiving layer on which<br>
writing (printing) is possible by a printer such as an<br>
ink jet printer or a thermal transfer printer or by any<br>
writing instrument, on the side which is not a side where<br>
the recording light or retrieving light enters, as the<br>
case requires. Further, two optical recording mediums<br>
may be bonded so that the first substrates 101 face<br>
outside. By bonding two optical recording mediums 100, a<br>
large capacity medium having four recording layers can be<br>
obtained.<br>
The process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium to which the present embodiment is applied can be<br>
applied to a phase change type rewritable compact disk<br>
(CD-RW, CD-Rewritable) or a phase change type rewritable<br>
DVD (tradename, DVD-RW, DVD+RW). In the phase change<br>
type CD-RW or DVD-RW, the difference in reflectivity and<br>
the change in phase difference generated by the<br>
difference in refractivity between the amorphous state<br>
and the crystalline state of the recording layer made of<br>
a phase-change type recording material are utilized to<br>
detect recording information signals. Specifically, the<br>
phase change type recording material may, for example, be<br>
a SbTe, GeTe, GeSbTe, InSbTe, AgSbTe, AgInSbTe, GeSb,<br>
GeSbSn, InGeSbTe or InGeSbSnTe type material. Among<br>
them, it is preferred to use a composition containing Sb<br>
as the main component for the recording layer so as to<br>
increase the crystallization rate.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present embodiment will be described in<br>
further detail with reference to the following Examples.<br>
However, the present embodiment is by no means restricted<br>
to the following Examples within a range not to exceed<br>
the gist.<br>
LIGHT TRANSMITTING STAMPERS<br>
Disk shape light transmitting stampers each having a<br>
center hole with an inner diameter of 15 mm and having an<br>
outer diameter of 12 0 mm and a thickness of 0.6 mm were<br>
formed by an injection molding method using as a material<br>
a polypropylene (NOVATEC (registered trademark) PPMG05BS,<br>
manufactured by Japan Polychem Corporation), an amorphous<br>
polyolefin (ZEONOR (registered trademark) 1060R,<br>
manufactured by ZEON CORPORATION) or a polycarbonate<br>
(NOVAREX (registered trademark) 7020AD2, manufactured by<br>
Mitsubishi Engineering-Plastics Corporation). The<br>
injection molding was carried out by means of an<br>
injection molding machine (MO40D3H, manufactured by<br>
NISSEI CORPORATION) using a nickel master having guide<br>
grooves with a track pitch of 0.74 urn, a width of about<br>
0.37 urn and a depth of about 160 nm. Principal molding<br>
conditions of each resin material are shown in Table 1.<br>
As a result of measurement by an atomic force microscope<br>
(AFM), each of the light transmitting stampers obtained<br>
by injection molding was confirmed to have guide grooves<br>
precisely transcribed from the nickel master.<br>
Further, Fig. 2 is a graph illustrating the result<br>
of measuring the light transmittance of the polypropylene<br>
light transmitting stamper at a wavelength of from 200 nm<br>
to 500 nm. The light transmittance was measured by means<br>
of an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (V-560,<br>
manufactured by JASCO Corporation).<br>
PEEL TEST OF LIGHT TRANSMITTING STAMPER<br>
In a process for producing an optical recording<br>
medium by a 2P process, each of the above-described light<br>
transmitting stampers was disposed on an ultraviolet-<br>
curing resin material layer, and ultraviolet rays were<br>
applied to cure the ultraviolet-curing resin. Then, a<br>
knife edge was inserted at a non-coated portion of an<br>
interlayer from the center hole portion (inner diameter<br>
side) of the light transmitting stamper. Then, a force<br>
was applied to separate the light transmitting stamper<br>
and the ultraviolet-curing resin material layer. At this<br>
occasion, separation characteristics were evaluated on<br>
the basis of the following standards.<br>
They are easily separated.<br>
O: They are separated with a certain level of<br>
force.<br>
X: They are hardly separated.<br>
Further, the same light transmitting stamper was<br>
repeatedly used to determine the number of times it can<br>
be used. The number of time it can be used is to<br>
evaluate the number of times the light transmitting<br>
stamper can be repeatedly used in view of separation<br>
characteristics (number of repeated use).<br>
EXAMPLES 1 and 2<br>
An interlayer was formed on a reflective layer<br>
formed by a sputtering method on a disk shape substrate<br>
having a center hole with an inner diameter of 15 mm and<br>
having an outer diameter of 12 0 mm. The interlayer was<br>
formed as follows.<br>
On the reflective layer, 2.5 g of an uncured<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin precursor (viscosity: 1,2 00<br>
mPa•s) composed mainly of a radical polymerizable<br>
acrylate was dropped on a position corresponding to an<br>
inner diameter of 25 mm in a circular shape, and then<br>
stretched by rotation at a number of revolutions of 3,500<br>
rpm for 15 seconds to form an ultraviolet-curing resin<br>
material layer.<br>
Then, using the above-described polypropylene light<br>
transmitting stamper (Example 1) or amorphous polyolefin<br>
light transmitting stamper (Example 2), the light<br>
transmitting stamper and the substrate were bonded under<br>
evacuation so that the guide grooves of the light<br>
transmitting stamper and the surface having the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin material layer formed thereon<br>
faced each other. Then, in a nitrogen atmosphere, a<br>
metal halide lamp was applied from the light transmitting<br>
stamper side to cure the ultraviolet-curing resin thereby<br>
to form an interlayer. The illuminance and the<br>
integrated amount of light of the ultraviolet rays were<br>
216 mW/cm2 and 1,092 mJ/cm2, respectively, as measured at<br>
a wavelength of 365 nm.<br>
Then, in accordance with the above-described method,<br>
the peel test of the light transmitting stamper was<br>
carried out to measure the separation characteristics and<br>
the number of repeated use of the polypropylene light<br>
transmitting stamper and the amorphous polyolefin light<br>
transmitting stamper. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
It is found from the results shown in Table 1 that<br>
the light transmitting stamper and the ultraviolet-curing<br>
resin can easily be separated when the interlayer is<br>
formed by a 2P process by using the polypropylene light<br>
transmitting stamper (Example 1) or the amorphous<br>
polyolefin light transmitting stamper (Example 2).<br>
Further, it is found that these light transmitting<br>
stampers can be repeatedly used. When the surface of the<br>
interlayer formed from the ultraviolet-curing resin was<br>
observed by an AFM, it was confirmed that the guide<br>
grooves were precisely transcribed from the light<br>
transmitting stamper.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE<br>
Using the above-described polycarbonate light<br>
transmitting stamper, the ultraviolet-curing resin was<br>
cured and the peel test of the light transmitting stamper<br>
was carried out in the same manner as in Example 1.<br>
As evident from the results shown in Table 1, the<br>
polycarbonate light transmitting stamper and the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin could hardly be separated, and<br>
they were not separated even when a great force was<br>
applied by a knife edge, and the polycarbonate light<br>
transmitting stamper was cracked and broken.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
On a disk-shape substrate having a center hole with<br>
an inner diameter of 15 mm and having an outer diameter<br>
of 12 0 mm, a recording layer and a reflective layer were<br>
formed by a spin coating method and a sputtering method,<br>
respectively. Then, on the reflective layer, 2.3 g of an<br>
uncured ultraviolet-curing resin precursor (viscosity:<br>
260 mPa•s) composed mainly of a radical polymerizable<br>
acrylate was dropped on a position corresponding to an<br>
inner diameter of 25 mm in a circular shape and stretched<br>
by rotation at a number of revolutions of 4,000 rpm for 6<br>
seconds to form an ultraviolet-curing resin material<br>
layer.<br>
Then, using a disk-shape amorphous polyolefin light<br>
transmitting stamper having a center hole with an inner<br>
diameter of 15 mm and having an outer diameter of 120 mm<br>
(a light transmitting stamper similar to one used in<br>
Example 2), the light transmitting stamper and the<br>
substrate were bonded under evacuation so that the guide<br>
grooves of the light transmitting stamper and the surface<br>
having the ultraviolet-curing resin material layer formed<br>
thereon faced each other. Then, in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere, a high pressure mercury lamp was applied from<br>
the light transmitting stamper side to cure the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin thereby to form an interlayer.<br>
The illuminance of the ultraviolet rays was 85 mW/cm2 as<br>
measured at a wavelength of 365 nm.<br>
After formation of the interlayer, an outer burr (a<br>
burr in a perpendicular direction at the edge of the<br>
ultraviolet-curing resin) was generated, and it was<br>
attempted to remove this portion by laser trimming by<br>
means of a CO2 gas laser manufactured by KEYENCE<br>
CORPORATION. However, it was given up since the outer<br>
burr was very small. Then, as shown in Fig. 9, the peel<br>
test of the light transmitting stamper was carried out,<br>
whereupon the light transmitting stamper could be<br>
favorably separated. After separation of the light<br>
transmitting stamper, adhesion of the outer burr was<br>
observed on the light transmitting stamper side. As a<br>
result of measurement of the size of the outer burr, it<br>
was so large as 80 µm. The size of the outer burr was<br>
measured by means of TENCOR profiler manufactured by KLA-<br>
Tencor Corporation.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
An interlayer was formed in the same manner as in<br>
Example 3 except that the shape of the light transmitting<br>
stamper was a disk shape having a center hole with an<br>
inner diameter of 15 mm and having an outer diameter of<br>
124 mm.<br>
After formation of the interlayer, a CO2 laser was<br>
applied along the outer diameter of the interlayer at a<br>
position corresponding to an outer diameter of 120 mm by<br>
means of a CO2 gas laser manufactured by KEYENCE<br>
CORPORATION to carry out laser trimming.<br>
Then, the peel test of the light transmitting<br>
stamper was carried out, whereupon the light transmitting<br>
stamper could be favorably separated. Further, the size<br>
of an outer burr (a burr in a vertical direction at the<br>
edge of the ultraviolet-curing resin) adhering to the<br>
light transmitting stamper was measured. As a result, a<br>
very small burr of 4 urn was observed. Further, the edge<br>
of the interlayer was kept favorable.<br>
