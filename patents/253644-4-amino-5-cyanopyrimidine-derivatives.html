				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a useful medicine as an agonist of adenosine A2a receptor comprising a 4-amino-5-cyanopyrimidine derivative or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and a pharmaceutical formulation including these compounds. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Adenosine is a substance that may exhibit various physiological actions when it binds to a receptor on a cell surface. The adenosine receptor on the cell surface belongs to G-protein-coupled receptor family, and it is classified into Al, A2a, A2b and A3. Among them, the adenosine Al and adenosine A3 receptors are coupled with Gi-protein and the activation thereof results in lowering of the intracellular c-AMP level. In addition, adenosine A2a and adenosine A2b receptors are coupled with Gs-protein and the activation thereof results in heightening of the intracellular c-AMP level. These 4 kinds of adenosine receptor subtypes each have been cloned.<br>
A variety of studies about agonists and antagonists which may work on each of the above adenosine receptor subtypes have been already reported. It has been disclosed that these agonists and antagonists could be used as medicaments for treating cardiovascular disorder, ischemic reperfusion injury, inflammation, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and so on. In particular, a lot of adenosine<br>
derivatives have been reported as an active compound of an adenosine A2a receptor agonist (see WO 01/027131 Al, WO 00/077018 Al, WO 00/078776 Al, WO 00/078777 Al, WO 00/078778 Al, WO 00/078779 Al, WO 00/072799 Al, WO 00/023457 Al, WO 99/67266 Al, WO 99/67265 Al, WO 99/67264 Al, WO 99/67263 Al, WO 99/41267 Al, WO 99/38877 Al, WO 98/28319 Al, US Patent No. 5877180, WO 00/044763 Al, WO 93/22328 Al, JP-B-1-33477, JP-B-2774169, US Patent No.4968697, JP-A-63-201196, JP-A-2003-055395 and JP-A-2002-173427).<br>
In addition, compounds which are structurally different from the above adenosine derivatives and have not any adenine structure have been also reported as an active compound of an adenosine Al or A2 receptor agonist. The examples of the compounds include dicyanopyridine derivatives (see WO 00/125210 Al, WO 02/070484 Al, WO 02/070485 Al, WO 02/070520 Al, WO 02/079195 Al, WO 02/079196 Al, WO 03/008384 Al and WO 03/053441 Al) . However, cyanopyrimidine derivatives having an action which can activate an adenosine A2a receptor have been not known.<br>
On the other hand, glaucoma is an intractable ophthalmopathy which most species of mammals including primates may suffer. The observed . symptoms are blurred vision and ophthalmic pain or loss of vision, and field of vision may be affected through the disorder of optic nerve, in some case, leading to blindness. The glaucoma can be classified into two types: ocular hypertensive glaucoma which is characterized in an increase of intraocular pressure (a facilitation of intraocular pressure) and normal tension glaucoma without any facilitation of intraocular pressure. The facilitation of intraocular pressure in glaucoma may be<br>
induced by the loss of the balance between a flow rate of aqueous humor which is secreted from ciliary epithelium into posterior chamber and an outflow rate of aqueous humor which is excreted from anterior chamber mainly via Schlemm's canal. This loss of the balance is considered to be induced from the enhanced flow resistance of aqueous humor due to mainly blocking the outflow pathway of aqueous humor. The glaucoma is an important disease whose patients have been increasing year by year in each advanced country with the advance of aging of society, and so the social requirement regarding the development of the treatment medicament is supposed to increase more and more.<br>
At present, in treating glaucoma, the control of the intraocular pressure which is related with the most critical factor is the most important problem, and the medicaments used in the treatment thereof include (3 blockers such as carteolol and timolol, prostaglandin derivatives such as latanoprost and isopropyl unoprostone, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as dorzolamide. These medicaments may modulate the formation or outflow of aqueous humor to lower an intraocular pressure.<br>
The adenosine A2a receptor agonists have been reported not only to exhibit the potent antihypertensive action and to be useful as above-mentioned drugs such as an antihypertensive drug, a medicament for treating/preventing cardiac or cerebral ischemic disease and antiarteriosclerotic drug, but also to exhibit an ocular hypotensive action (see J. Pharmcol. Exp. Ther. 320-326, 273 (1995) and Eur. J. Pharmacol. 307-316, 486 (2004)).<br>
In addition,  with respect to adenosine derivatives<br>
having the intraocular pressure lowering action it has already progressed partly the research and development thereof (see JP-A-2003-055395 and JP-A-2002-173427):<br>
However, these adenosine derivatives might be feared to accompany with some side effect for central nerve and cardiovascular system when these compounds are used as a medicament for treating glaucoma.<br>
As mentioned above, the adenosine derivatives having the adenine structure are expected to exhibit the effect as an adenosine A2a receptor agonist, especially as a medicament for treating glaucoma and the like due to the intraocular pressure lowering action thereof, but the intraocular pressure lowering action is not enough, furthermore these compounds have a critical demerit to accompany with the side effect for central nerve and cardiovascular system, for example, the potent antihypertensive action generated from the potential adenosine A2a receptor agonistic activity arising from an adenine structure thereof. Therefore, in the related field, it is required to develop a compound that can exhibit the desired reduction of intraocular pressure as an adenosine A2a receptor agonist, especially a medicament for treating glaucoma and the like, and used more safely instead of the above compounds.

Then the compound (2b) from the above reaction may be transformed to the compound (2c) or the compound (2d) or the mixture thereof by reaction with the thiourea (12). This reaction may be carried out according to the method of the reference (see, for. example, Daboun, H. A.; El-Reedy, A. M.; Z. Naturforsch., 1983, 38 (12), 1686). To mention above in detail, the reaction can be carried out with an equimolecular to an excess molecular amount of the thiourea (12) to one mole of the compound (2b), without solvent or in an inert solvent such as water, DMF, DMSO, diethyl ether, THF, dioxane, acetone, MEK, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, and chloroform.

In this way, the compounds of the invention (1) can be prepared. Among the above conditions, especially the reaction using ethanol as the reaction solvent<br>
and in the presence of NBS, or using dioxane as the reaction solvent and in the presence of DDQ is preferred. The temperature condition of the above reaction may be room temperature to enhanced temperature, preferably reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>

Accordingly, the compound (1) of the invention may be obtained as the mixture with the compound (2e) via the compound (2e) (the dihydropyrimidine compound)<br>
by the above reaction.<br>
The compound (13) used herein as the starting compound includes both of a known compound and a novel compound as mentioned in above Scheme 1. Such novel compounds will be mentioned below.<br>

In the method shown in Scheme 2, first of all, an equimolecular to an excess molecular amount of the compound (13) to one mole of the thiourea (12) is reacted without solvent or in an inert solvent such as water, DMF, DMSO, diethyl ether, THF, dioxane, acetone, MEK, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, and chloroform. This reaction can be carried out according to the synthetic method of S-alkyl isothioureas described in the reference such as Urquhart, G. G.; Gates, J. W. Jr; Connor, R.; Org. Synth., 1941, 21, 36. In the reaction medium, some base such as potassium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, and triethylamine or some mineral acid such as hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, or some organic acid such as acetic acid may be optionally added. Preferably, the reaction solvent is ethanol. The reaction may be carried out at room temperature to enhanced temperature, preferably at enhanced temperature (especially, about 60CC). In this way, the compound (3a) can be obtained as a free form or a salt form.<br>
Then, to the obtained compound (3a) (it may be as a free<br>
form or a salt form), an equimolecular to an excess molecular amount of the compound (2b) is added without solvent or in an inert solvent such as DMF, DMSO, diethyl ether, THF, dioxane, acetone, MEK, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, methylene chloride, dichloroethane, and chloroform, and optionally added an equimolecular to an excess molecular amount of some base such as potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate, sodium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, triethylamine, and diisopropylethylamine to the reaction medium to proceed to the reaction. This reaction may be carried out according to the method of the reference (El-Sharabsy, S. A.; Abdel Gawad, S. M.; Hussain, S. M.; J. Prakt. Chem., 1989, 331 (2), 207). In this reaction, ethanol can be exemplified as a preferable solvent. In addition, it is also preferable to added sodium bicarbonate in the reaction medium. The reaction may be carried out at room temperature to enhanced temperature, preferably reflux temperature of the solvent. In this way, the compound (1) of the invention or the dihydro compound (2e) or the mixture thereof can be given.<br>
The dihydro compound (2e) of the invention obtained above may be transformed to the compounds (1) of the invention by the oxidation reaction shown in above Scheme 1.<br>
In the preparation of Scheme 2, the compound (3a) is prepared from the thiourea (12), and said compound is isolated and then this compound is reacted with the compound (2b) . However, without isolating the compound (3a), the reaction wherein the compound (2b) is added to the reaction medium under the same condition can be also led to the compound (1) of the invention or the dihydro compound (2e) thereof or the mixture thereof.<br>

Hereinafter, the examples of the pharmacological tests using the compounds of the invention are described.<br>
(1) c-AMP Generating Action in Cell Expressing Adenosine A2a Receptor<br>
The test was carried out as mentioned below with reference to the method disclosed in the reference (Klotz k.N. et al., Naunyn- Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol., (1998) 357,<br>
1-9-; Shryock J.C. et al., Molecular Pharmacology, (1998) 53, 886-893}.<br>
As to the cell, HEK293 cell expressing adenosine A2a receptor (Human) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Code No. RBHA2AC) was used.<br>
As to the culture medium, Dulbecco's modified Eagles medium (DMEM) including 10% FBS (Fetal bovine serum) and 1 mM of sodium pyruvate was used.<br>
The cell was placed on 96 well plate (1 x 105 /well), and cultured overnight. After removing off the supernatant, to each well, 0.1 ml of DMEM (without FBS) containing 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM of IBMX (3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine ) and 2 unit/mL adenosine deaminase was added, and they were incubated at 37°C for 30 minutes. To each well, 0.1 ml of the culture medium including the DMSO solution of the test compound in an appropriate concentration was added and they were incubated for additional 30 minutes. After removing off the supernatant, the cytolytic solution was added to quench the reaction. The amount of c-AMP in each well was measured by using the c-AMP enzyme immunoassay (EIA) system (Amersham Biosciences, Code NO.RPN225).<br>
The same assay was repeated .using CGS-21680 (2-p-carboxyethyl) phenethylamino-5' -N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine hydrochloride, (Sigma, code C141) as reference compound. The amount of resultant c-AMP in the medium, caused by 1 uM of reference compound, was defined to be 100%. A concentration of assayed compound in the medium, producing 50% c-AMP amounts, was calculated to be ECao value.<br>
The above test results obtained using the following compounds of the invention prepared in the above-mentioned<br>
examples are shown in the following Table 12.  In addition, in the Table, the results of the same test using the compound described in Example 6 of WO 03/053441 Al (referred to the Comparative Compound A) and the compound described in Example 1 of WO 03/008384 Al (referred to the Comparative Compound B) having the following structures are also shown together. <comparative compound a><br>

From the results shown in Table 12, it is obvious that all of the compounds of the invention have a potent A2a receptor stimulating activity.<br>
(2) Adenosine Al agonistic Action<br>
The test was carried out as mentioned below with reference to the method disclosed in the literature (Shryock J.C. et al., Molecular Pharmacology, (1998) 53, 886-893; Ito H. et al., European Journal of Pharmacology, {1999") 365, 309-315). That is, cerebral cortex of male Wistar rats (Charles River Japan, Inc) was extirpated, thereto Tris buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl: pH 7.4) was added, it was homogenized, and then centrifuged (1000 x g, 10 min). The supernatant was taken, and centrifuged (20,000 x g, 20 min). After removing off the supernatant, the precipitate was suspended in Tris buffer, and recentrifuged (20,000 x g, 20 min). After removing off the supernatant, the precipitate was suspended in Tris buffer including 2 units/mL ADA (adenosine deaminase) and reserved at -80°C until used as a liquid preparation of cell membrane<br>
for the following tests.<br>
The above liquid preparation of cell membrane in an amount corresponding to 10 ug of cell membrane was added to Tris-buffer comprising 5 mM of MgCl2, 1 mM of EDTA, 1 mM of dithiothreitol, 100 mM of NaCl, 0.01 mM of GDP (guanosine diphosphate), 5 mg/mL of BSA and 2 units/mL of ADA and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 minutes. Additionally, [35S]GTPvS (Guanosine 5 '-[y-thio]triphosphate) (the final concentration: 0.4 nM) and the test compound of the given concentration (which was calculated based on the final concentration of the test compound) were added to the mixture and the resulting mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 45 minutes. The reaction mixture was filtrated through a glass fiber filter (unifilter-96 GF/B, Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) to quench reaction. The filter was washed 5 times with ice-cooled Tris-buffer including 5 mM MgCla- The radioactivity of the filter was measured with Top count NXT (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences). The nonspecific binding was shown as the binding activity of [35S]GTPvS in the presence of 0.01 mM GTPyS.<br>
The activity (%, Al agonistic action) of each test compound was calculated on the basis of the test result ([35S]GTPvS binding activity) derived with 1 uM of• CPA (N6-Cyclopentyladenosine, Sigma, code C-8031) in control which was counted as 100%.<br>
The following Table 13 shows the results in 1 uM, 100 nM and 10 nM of the test compounds of the invention (including the salts thereof) of above-mentioned examples. Also, Table 13 shows the results of Control Compounds A and B which are the same as used in the pharmacological test (1).<br>
Table 13<br><br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
As is seen from the result shown in Table 13,. the Al receptor activating action (Al agonistic action) of the compounds of the invention is still lower than those of the control compounds. This finding indicates that the compounds of the invention may selectively act on the adenosine A2a receptor.<br>
On testing the compounds of the invention of. all other examples than the compounds used in above Table 13, it was observed that all of the compounds exhibited almost the same Al agonistic action as the compounds of the invention shown in Table 13.<br>
(3) Measuring Test for Intraocular Pressure in Rabbit<br>
The test compounds were dissolved in 10 mM of phosphate buffer (pH 7.5&gt; (hereinafter, referred to as "vehicle of<br>
ophthalmic preparation"), and they were instilled in a given concentration. In addition, the compounds insoluble in that concentration was used as a suspension. Female New Zealand white rabbits (KITAYAMA LABES Co.,Ltd.) whose weights were 2.0-4.0 kg were used.<br>
The measurement of the intraocular pressure was carried out using Pneumatonometer (Model 30 Classic, Mentor company) without anesthesia. In addition, before the measurement of the intraocular pressure, the surface anesthesia with 0.4% oxybuprocaine hydrochloride ("Benoxil" 0.4% ophthalmic solution, Santen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) was carried out.<br>
The animals whose intraocular pressure was stable before instillation were selected, and these animals were divided to every 4 animal in each one group, 50 uL of eye drops including each the test compound was administered to onesided eye and vehicle was administered to contralateral eye as the control eye. The measurement of intraocular pressure was carried out before instillation and after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours from instillation. The effect on the intraocular pressure was shown as the difference from pre-instillation (AIOP, mmHg, mean ± standard error). The following Tables 14 and 15 show the results of Control Compounds A and B used as 1% suspensions which are the same as in the pharmacological test (1) .<br>

Table 15.   Control Compound B,  1% Suspended Ophthalmic Preparation (n=4)<br><br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The animals were pretreated as mentioned above, and among them animals whose intraocular pressure was stable before instillation were selected, and these animals were divided to every 5 to 8 animal in each one group. Every two group was used for each of the test compounds. The test compound was administered unilaterally to the eye of the test group rabbit and the intraocular pressure was measured. The vehicle was administered unilaterally to the eye of the control group rabbit and the intraocular pressure was measured. As mentioned above, the measurement of intraocular pressure was carried out before instillation and after 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours from instillation, and the effect on the intraocular pressure was shown as the difference from pre-<br>
instillation (AIOP, mmHg, mean ± standard error).<br>

On testing the compounds of the invention derived from each of the above Examples 1-84 except the compounds of the invention described in above Tables 16-32 in the same way mentioned above, it was observed that all of the compounds exhibited almost the same result shown in Tables 16-32.<br>
From the result shown in Tables 14-32, the following is obvious. That is, as shown in Tables 14 and 15, Control Compounds A and B did not exhibit any significant intraocular pressure lowering action even in 1% suspension which was a relatively high concentration.<br>
As shown in Tables 17-32, all of the tested compounds of the invention exhibited the intraocular pressure lowering action. In particular, the compounds of the invention shownin Tables 19-32 in a lower concentration than that of CGS-21680 exhibited the same level of the intraocular pressure lowering action of CGS-21680 which was already reported to have an intraocular hypotensive action (see Table 16). In addition, the compounds of the invention shown in Tables 20 to 32 were soluble in a high concentration (0.3% - 1%) beyond the concentrations- used in said measuring test (0.01% -0.03%) without a solubilizing agent, hence it appeared that they were useful as ophthalmic solution.<br><br><br><br><br>
