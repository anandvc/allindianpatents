				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved continuous circular cutting device useful for lemon and other similar fruits. The improved machine of the present invention is particularly useful for cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces of different geometrical shapes. Geometrical shapes so obtained by using the device of the present invention are of uniform dimension, size and are obtained in a continuous manner. The cut lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces will have application in pickle and other similar fruit processing industry. The improved machine of the present invention is therefore useful as an improved device for cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces. Based on stationery multi edged cutter and a rotating centralizing/locating flats concept, an improved device for cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces, untouched by hand is proposed for the first time according to this invention. As an important improved device, different varieties and sizes of lemon and other similar fruits can be cut in to four pieces by using this improved device. Pickle is popular in India and is considered as an important ingredient of the daily meal.<br>
Different types of pickles are produced in the country by different industries in various brands. Lemon, mango, tamarind, tomato are the common types of fruits used in preparing pickles in the country. Presently pickles are produced at cottage industry level, small scale level as well as in large scale by very few industry. Some of the main problems in producing them in cottage scale, small scale, large scale is the tedious operation of cutting the large quantities of fruits to the required shape and size continuously, particularly lemon.<br>
Attempt to produce continuous compact machines for cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces, is the first of its kind. The pickle manufacturers are deprived of a suitable machine for lemon cutting and depend on the skill of the operators. Many a times the operators are in the risk of cutting their fingers as well. In case a device is made available for continuous cutting of lemon and other &gt; similar fruits which is one of the ingredients of the pickle, would result in reduction in accident, labor and drudgery on the part of laborers, help in hygienic operations, and enhance uniformity in quality and quantities. Traditionally cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces is done by using a sharp knife manually. Most of the production centers are cottage and tiny industries, the processing is done manually there is a scope for accident, non-uniformity in size, cut shape, geometry and unhygienic handling of the fruits. The cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces is done carefully for pickle processing industry. In order to overcome these difficulties, if a cost effective machine for cutting of lemon and other similar fruits is made available, it would mechanize large-scale production of different types of pickles by small and cottage scale manufacturers hygienically.<br>
Hitherto the process of cutting of lemon and other similar fruits is based on manual cutting. The operator uses a stainless steel knife for cutting the lemon in to four pieces. The lemon is spread on the cutting table and the operator picks one at a time and cuts them in to four pieces. The knife and the table are to be kept clean during the process of cutting. The cut lemon is transferred in to a stainless steel tray or a vessel for further processing.<br>
The drawbacks of manual cutting of lemon are:<br>
&gt;	There is a variation in the size of the cut pieces.<br>
&gt;	Manual cutting will lead to non-uniform product sizes.<br>
&gt;	The operators cut their fingers, leading to unhygiene.<br>
&gt;	The table and the knife are prone for microbial contamination.<br>
&gt;	The process is labor intensive and human drudgery is very high.<br>
&gt;	The final geometry of the product would depend on the skill of the labor.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, figure 1 represents an embodiment of the continuous circular cutting machine for lemon and other similar fruits, designed and developed at Central Food Technological Research Institute, Mysore against copending patent No. 226043 (313/DEL/02), Dated 26.03.02<br>
The continuous circular cutting machine for lemon and other similar fruits has the following drawbacks.<br>
1.	The size variations of the fruit can only be accommodated in only one<br>
direction.<br>
2.	The locating /centralizing is done separately for different cuts.<br>
3.	Two sets of centralizing discs are needed for cutting the lemon and other<br>
similar fruits in to four pieces.<br>
4.	Two sets of knives are needed for cutting the lemon and other similar fruits in<br>
to four pieces.<br>
5.	Due to size variations the transfer of the first cut lemon and other similar fruits<br>
in to the second disc is difficult<br>
6.	Transferring of the lemon and other similar fruits after the first cut in to the<br>
second centralizing disc with specific orientation is not uniform.<br>
7.	The machine cannot be operated by hand incase of electric power failure.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved continuous circular cutting device useful for lemon and other similar fruits.<br>
Another object is to provide hygienic conditions through mechanized operation.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to cut the lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces in a single stage of operation.<br>
Yet another object is to use only one stage for cutting the lemons and other similar fruits.<br>
Still another object is to reduce cost by using one centralizing/locating disc and also by using one stationery multi edged cutter.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Yet another object is to increase productivity.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device capable of working with a wide range of<br>
sizes of lemon and other similar fruits.<br>
The device of the present invention overcomes most of the drawbacks of the<br>
copending patent patent No. 226043 (313/DEL/02), Dated 26.03.02.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, figure 2 represents an embodiment<br>
of the improved continuous circular cutting machine for lemon and other similar<br>
fruits in to four pieces.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides an improved continuous circular cutting machine useful for cutting lemon and other similar fruits characterized by a main frame (16) which is provide with the inlet chute (17) for feeding the uncut/whole lemon in to a centralizing disc (18) , a stationery multi edged cutter (19) being provided on top of the said centralizing disc (18) for cutting the lemon in to four pieces , an outlet chute (20) being provided below the said centralizing disc (18) which discharges the cut lemon for further processing, a geared motor connected a set of sprocket (not shown in the drawings) one is connected to motor and another is fixed with said centralizing disc (18), the said motor the said centralizing disc (18) being connected by means of a chain (not shown in the drawings), the said driving mechanism being provided inside the said frame (16) so as to transmit the motion from the said geared motor to the said centralizing disc(18), an AC drive/inverter (21) being provided so as to control &amp; vary speed of the said geared motor, the device being covered all round using stainless steel sheet (24) and has a tray (25) for collecting the cut fruit.<br>
The material of construction of the centralizing disc, stationery multi edged<br>
cutter, main frame, chutes and the cover can be of any material and preferably of<br>
stainless steel for hygiene and good aesthetic look. The centralizing disc may<br>
preferably be in circular shape and made of stainless steel. This however,does not   restrict the invention as any alternate shape    or material can be used.<br>
In an another embodiment of the device there is a provisoion of a geared motor (15) for driving the centralizing disc (18).<br>
In an another embodiment of the device an inlet chute (17) is for feeding the uncut /whole fruit to the centralizing disc.<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the device an outlet chute (20) is for discharging the cut lemon for further processing.<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the device an electronic speed variator (21) is varying the speed of the centralizing disc (18).<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the device a set of sprocket (22) and chain (23) is for transmitting the motion to the centralizing disc.<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the device a cover (24) is all round.<br>
In yet an another embodiment of the device a tray (25) is for holding the inlet feed material.<br>
We propose an improved continuous circular cutting machine useful for cutting lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces, for the first time according to this invention. The invention is based on our finding that cutting of lemon and other similar fruits in to four pieces under hygienic conditions using this device.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. The working of the continuous circular cutting machine is explained below with particular reference to lemon.<br>
Example<br>
The washed lemon is transferred in to the tray of the, improved continuous circular cutting machine for lemon and other similar fruits. The lemon flows in to the pockets of the centralizing disc due to the gradient of the inlet chute. The centralizing disc carry/move the lemon against the stationery multi edged cutter<br><br>
provided between the set of centralizing disc. The whole lemon is cut in to four pieces when the centralizing disc carrying the whole lemon moves against the stationery multi edged cutter. The lemons cut to four pieces are dropped on to the outlet chute, when the centralizing disc moves away from the multi edged cutter. The outlet chute will discharge the cut lemon in to the tray/vessel. A geared motor drives the centralizing disc and a set of sprocket and chain transfers the motion from the geared motor to the centralizing disc. The speed of the geared motor can be varied with the help of the AC drive/inverter to fine-tune the process of cutting of the lemon.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
&gt;	Only one set of centralizing disc and one multi edged cutter is needed.<br>
&gt;	The un graded lemons are picked from the chute one after the other.<br>
&gt;	The lemon can be automatically cut to four segments/pieces.<br>
&gt;	Uniformity in cut size can be controlled easily.<br>
&gt;	The device is versatile and can efficiently handle different sizes of lemon and<br>
other fruits with out grading.<br>
&gt;	Operation and maintenance is easy and cost effective too.<br>
&gt;	The complete operation of cutting lemon and other fruits is done hygienically.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
