DESCRIPTION<br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURING TOOTHBRUSH WITH<br>
NEEDLE-SHAPED BRISTLES AND TOOTHBRUSH<br>
MANUFACTURED BY THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to methods<br>
of manufacturing toothbrushes with needle-shaped bristles<br>
and toothbrushes manufactured using the methods and, more<br>
particularly, to a method of manufacturing a toothbrush<br>
with needle-shaped bristles which, enhances the workability<br>
thereof, and a toothbrush with needle-shaped bristles<br>
having improved penetration ability and flexibility.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, needle-shaped bristles, which have sharp<br>
ends and are set in a toothbrush, have superior flexibility<br>
and ability to penetrate into gaps between teeth or into<br>
periodontal pockets, compared to normal bristles, end<br>
points of which are round. Thus, recently, needle-shaped<br>
bristles have been set in almost all high quality<br>
toothbrushes.<br>
In methods of manufacturing such needle-shaped<br>
bristles, there are a method (D) in which end points of<br>
bristles are dissolved using a strong alkali chemical or<br>
strong acid chemical, a method (D) in which bristles are<br>
1<br><br>
PCT7KR2004/003253<br>
ground using a grinder after a bristle setting process has<br>
been conducted, and a method (D) in which bristles are<br>
partially tapered using the method (D) and are then<br>
additionally grounded using the method (□) .<br>
High quality needle-shaped bristles, which are tapered<br>
such that the length of the tapered portions of the bristles<br>
are relatively long, that is, 5mm or longer, and the<br>
thickness of end points of the bristles are approximately<br>
0.01mm, can be produced through the method (□) . Because the<br>
tapered portions of these needle-shaped bristles are<br>
relatively long, the flexibility thereof increases.<br>
Furthermore, the end points of the bristles are relatively<br>
thin, so that the penetration ability is superior. However,<br>
it is very difficult to adjust the precise time required to<br>
dissolve the bristles. As well, there is a problem of an<br>
increase in the number of defective products.<br>
In the case of the method (D), the workability is<br>
increased, but because tapered portions of produced needle-<br>
shaped bristles are relatively short, that is, 2mm, the<br>
flexibility is poor. As a result, there is a problem of<br>
damage to the gums of a user.<br>
The method (□) is advantageous in that it solves some<br>
problems of the methods (D) and (D) . This method (D) was<br>
proposed in Korean Patent No. 261658 and No. 421454 which<br>
were filed by the inventor of the present invention. Korean<br>
Patent No. 261658 proposes a method, in which bristles are<br>
immersed and dissolved in strong acid chemical or strong<br>
2<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/003253<br>
alkali chemical until just before the length of the bristles<br>
is reduced and, thereafter, the partially tapered bristles<br>
are washed in water and dried, and then set in a head part of<br>
a toothbrush after being ground using a grinder. The needle-<br>
shaped bristles produced by this method are relatively long,<br>
that is, approximately 5mm, so that the flexibility thereof<br>
is superior. However, because the thickness of the end<br>
points of the bristles ranges from 0.04 to 0.08mm, that is,<br>
because the thickness of the end points is relatively large,<br>
the penetration ability is poor. If the grinding process is<br>
further conducted to reduce the thickness of the end points<br>
of the bristles, the length of the tapered portions of the<br>
bristles is reduced, thus resulting in poor flexibility.<br>
Korean Patent No. 42154 is similar to Korean Patent<br>
No. 261658. In this case, bristles are ground such that the<br>
thickness of end points of bristles is 0.02mm or less in<br>
order to enhance the penetration ability. However, this<br>
case is problematic in that, because the length of tapered<br>
portions of the bristles ranges from 2.8 to 3. 5mm, the<br>
flexibility is poor. Furthermore, there is a problem in<br>
that the number of defective products increases in a<br>
manufacturing process.<br>
That is, it has been very difficult to produce<br>
needle-shaped bristles having both increased penetration<br>
ability and flexibility through the conventional immersion<br>
and grinding processes.<br>

Disclosure<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made<br>
keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior<br>
art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
toothbrush with needle-shape bristles having improved<br>
penetration ability and flexibility. Another object of the<br>
present invention is to provide a method of manufacturing<br>
toothbrush with needle-shaped bristles in which a<br>
manufacturing process is simplified and the defective<br>
proportion is markedly reduced.<br>
4<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/003253<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In an aspect, the present invention provides a method<br>
of manufacturing a toothbrush, including: setting needle-<br>
shaped bristles, partially tapered by immersing end points<br>
of the bristles in a chemical, in a head part of a<br>
toothbrush body/ and grinding the needle-shape bristles<br>
using a drum grinder having protrusions. In another aspect,<br>
the present invention provides a method of manufacturing a<br>
toothbrush including: grinding a bundle of partially<br>
tapered needle-shaped bristles using a drum grinder having<br>
protrusions; and setting the bristles in a head part of a<br>
toothbrush body. The needle-shaped bristles of the<br>
toothbrush manufactured using the method of the present<br>
invention have end points ranging from 0.01 to 0.03mm in<br>
thickness and tapered portions ranging from 3.5 to 8mm in<br>
length.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
As described above, the present invention provides a<br>
method of manufacturing a toothbrush with needle-shaped<br>
bristles which have end points ranging from 0.01 to 0.03mm in<br>
thickness and tapered portions ranging from 3.5 to 8mm in<br>
length. In the method of the present invention, because the<br>
manufacturing process is simplified, the production time and<br>
the defective proportion are markedly reduced.<br>
5<br><br>
PCT7KR2004/003253<br>
Best Mode<br>
Hereafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail.<br>
A typical grinder has a structure shown in FIG. 1.<br>
The surface of the grinder is coated with grind stones such<br>
as diamonds. This drum grinder has a planar surface and<br>
grinds an object by rotating. The patents, which were filed<br>
by the inventor of the present invention, disclose the same<br>
kind of grinders, and these grinders grind bristles which<br>
are previously partially tapered. However, it is very<br>
difficult to produce bristles, end points of which have a<br>
thickness of 0.03mm and tapered portions of which have a<br>
length of 3.5mm, using the above-mentioned grinders. The<br>
reason is that, if bristles are heavily ground by a grinder<br>
in order to reduce the thickness of the end points of the<br>
bristles, the length of tapered portions of the bristles is<br>
excessively reduced, and, conversely, if the bristles are<br>
ground such that the length of tapered portions is<br>
maintained within a desired range, the thickness of the end<br>
points is increased.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a grinder used in a manufacturing<br>
method of the present invention has a plurality of<br>
protrusions 10 thereon. The height of each protrusion may<br>
be appropriately adjusted within a range from 2 to 10mm.<br>
Intervals between protrusions 10 are not limited to a<br>
particular range, but a range from approximately 2 to<br>
approximately  5mm  is  appropriate.    Preferably,  each<br>
6<br><br>
PCT7KR2004/003253<br>
protrusion 10 has a mountain top shape, a lower portion of<br>
which has a larger cross sectional area and an upper<br>
portion of which has a smaller cross sectional area.<br>
Alternatively, each protrusion 10 may have a cylindrical<br>
shape. In the case that each protrusion 10 has a mountain<br>
top shape, an end thereof is preferably rounded. The reason<br>
is that bristles to be machined may be undesirably cut by<br>
sharp end points of the protrusions.<br>
Overall, each protrusion 10 has a mountain top shape<br>
but, more preferably, each protrusion 10 may have a slender<br>
base 11, as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
The slender bases 11 of the protrusions 10 serve to<br>
prevent ends of bristles from being excessively ground. The<br>
surface of each protrusion 10 is coated with grind stones<br>
in the same manner as that of the conventional grinder. The<br>
grinder may be constructed such that the grind stones are<br>
embedded in the surface of the grinder.<br>
If the above-mentioned drum grinder having<br>
protrusions 10 is used, the thickness of end points of<br>
bristles can be reduced to a desired range despite<br>
maintenance of the length of tapered portions of the<br>
bristles. The reason is that the grinder having protrusions<br>
10 can evenly grind end points of bristles to a length<br>
corresponding to the height of the protrusions 10, unlike a<br>
conventional drum grinder, which grinds only end points of<br>
bristles due to its planar surface. Furthermore, if the<br>
grinder having protrusions 10 rotates for a predetermined<br>
7<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/003253<br>
time and then rotates in reverse, relatively satisfactory<br>
bristles can be obtained.<br>
However, to obtain more satisfactory bristles, a<br>
grinder, which is able to rotate even in a transverse<br>
direction, is required. A grinder having this structure is<br>
shown in FIG. 4. In this drawing, the drum grinder, having<br>
protrusions 10, is coupled to a rotating shaft 20 of a<br>
rotor 30. The rotor 30 rotates in a transverse direction<br>
while the grinder rotates in a longitudinal direction. In<br>
the case of the grinder which is able to rotate in both<br>
longitudinal and transverse directions, the whole grinder<br>
is evenly involved in a grinding operation, compared to a<br>
grinder which is able to rotate in only one direction. As a<br>
result, the grinder is prevented from being unevenly worn,<br>
so that its expected life span is extended. Furthermore,<br>
because the grinder can evenly grind bristles, the time<br>
required to finish a tapering process is reduced. Moreover,<br>
the grinder can grind bristles, such that the thickness of<br>
the end points of the bristles becomes approximately 0.01mm<br>
despite the length of the tapered portions of the bristles<br>
being maintained.<br>
In a manufacturing method according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention, a bundle of needle-<br>
shaped bristles, which were previously partially tapered,<br>
is ground by a drum grinder having protrusions 10 before<br>
being set in a head part of a toothbrush. "A bundle of<br>
needle-shaped bristles which were previously partially<br>
8<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/003253<br>
tapered" means a bundle of bristles made by partially<br>
dissolving end points of the needle-shaped bristles, each<br>
of which has a length ranging from 32 to 33mm, using a<br>
chemical and by tying it in a cylindrical shape having a<br>
diameter ranging from 30 to 50mm. Such a bundle of needle-<br>
shaped bristles is ground by the drum grinder having<br>
protrusions 10 and is then set in the head part of the<br>
toothbrush. This manufacturing method has the advantage of<br>
a reduction in the time required to grind the bristles.<br>
Particularly, the method is effective in manufacturing a<br>
toothbrush in which needle-shaped bristles, each of which<br>
is tapered, are set.<br>
Several examples according to the present invention<br>
are as follows.<br>
(Example 1)<br>
Partially tapered needle-shaped bristles were<br>
manufactured by immersing and dissolving end points of<br>
bristles in a chemical, such that the partially tapered<br>
needle-shaped bristles had end points ranging from 0.03 to<br>
0.04mm in thickness and tapered portions of 7mm in length.<br>
Thereafter, the partially tapered needle-shaped bristles<br>
were set in a head part of a toothbrush. Subsequently, the<br>
bristles, which were set in the toothbrush, were tapered by<br>
grinding them at 2000rpm for four seconds using eight drum<br>
grinders, each of which has a structure of FIG. 2, in which<br>
protrusions, each having a height of 5mm, are provided on<br>
the surface of the grinder and are spaced apart from each<br>
9<br><br>
PCT/KR2004/003253<br>
other at intervals of 3mm. As a result, the thicknesses of<br>
the end points of the manufactured needle-shaped bristles<br>
range from 0.01 to 0.03mm. The lengths of the tapered<br>
portions of the needle-shaped bristles range from 4 to 5mm.<br>
(Example 2)<br>
The second example was conducted in the same method<br>
as the first example, but using a grinder of FIG. 4 which<br>
is able to rotate in both longitudinal and transverse<br>
directions. Here, a transversely rotating speed was 300rpm,<br>
and the time required to grind bristles was two seconds. In<br>
this case, the thicknesses of the end points of the<br>
manufactured needle-shaped bristles range from 0.01 to<br>
0.02mm. The lengths of the tapered portions of the needle-<br>
shaped bristles range from 6 to 7mm.<br>
(Comparative Example)<br>
This example was conducted in the same method as the<br>
first example, but using a typical drum grinder having no<br>
protrusions. In this case, the thicknesses of the end<br>
points of the manufactured needle-shaped bristles range<br>
from 0.015 to 0.02mm. The lengths of the tapered portions<br>
of the needle-shaped bristles range from 2.7 to 3.2mm.<br>
(Example 3)<br>
A bundle of partially tapered needle-shaped bristles,<br>
each of which has a length of 33mm, (the diameter of the<br>
bundle is 35mm) was ground in the same manner as the second<br>
example, for 56 seconds (28 seconds for each end of the<br>
bundle),  such that the partially tapered needle-shaped<br>
10<br><br>
PCT7KR2004/003253<br>
bristles have end points ranging from 0.01 to 0.02mm in<br>
thickness and tapered portions ranging from 6 to 7mm in<br>
length. Thereafter, the manufactured bundle of partially<br>
tapered needle-shaped bristles was set in a head part of a<br>
toothbrush, thus obtaining a toothbrush having the same<br>
shape as that of the second example.<br>
However, in this example, one bundle of needle-shaped<br>
bristles can be set in fifty-eight toothbrushes. Therefore,<br>
the grinding time of the bristles is markedly reduced, to<br>
0.97 seconds per toothbrush, compared to the second<br>
example, in which the grinding time of the bristles is 2<br>
seconds per toothbrush.<br><br>
