				<td>"METHOD FOR PRODUCING CYLINDRICAL VACUUM PANELS AND PANELS<br>
THEREBY OBTAINED"<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing cylindrical vacuum<br>
panels and to the panels thereby obtained.<br>
Vacuum panels, and particularly those made with plastic materials, are being<br>
increasingly used in all the fields wherein a thermo-insulation at temperatures lower than<br>
about 100°C is required. As examples of applications can be mentioned the walls of<br>
domestic and industrial refrigerators, of the beverages dispensing machines (wherein<br>
thermo-insulation is required mainly in order to separate the portion of the hot drinks,<br>
generally at about 70°C, from that of the cold drinks), or of the containers for isothermal<br>
transportation, for example of drugs or cold or frozen food. Applications of these panels<br>
are being studied also in the building field and in the car industry.<br>
As known, a vacuum panel is formed of an envelope inside which a filling<br>
material is present.<br>
The envelope has the function of preventing (or reducing as much as possible)<br>
the inlet of atmospheric gases inside the panel, so as to keep a vacuum grade<br>
compatible with the thermo-insulation level required by the application. To this purpose,<br>
the envelope is made with so-called "barrier" sheets, of thickness generally not greater<br>
than 100 urn, characterized by a gas permeability being as low as possible. These<br>
sheets can be formed of a single component, but more frequently are multi-layers of<br>
different components; in the case of multi layers the barrier effect is conferred by one of<br>
the component layers (generally metallic and commonly of aluminium), whereas the<br>
other layers generally have functions of mechanical support and protection of the barrier<br>
layer.<br>
The filling material has the function of spacing apart the two opposite<br>
faces of the envelope when vacuum is created in the panel. This filling material<br>
can be inorganic, such as silica powder, glass fibers, aerogels, diatomaceous<br>
earth, etc., or organic, such as rigid foams of polyurethane or polystyrene, both<br>
in the form of boards and of powders. Materials more commonly used are open cells<br><br>
polyurethane foams (open cells are necessary to allow their evacuation through<br>
mechanical pumping) and, in the case of panels which must resist to temperatures<br>
higher than about 150 °C, silica powder (generally of submicronic dimensions).<br>
The filling material must be anyway porous or discontinuous, so that the pores or<br>
the interstices can be evacuated. Since the permeation of traces of atmospheric<br>
gases into the panel is practically unavoidable, these panels contain in most cases<br>
also one or more materials (generally referred to as getter materials) capable of<br>
sorbing these gases so as to maintain the pressure inside the panel at the desired<br>
values.<br>
Vacuum panels generally have a planar configuration and can hence be used<br>
to insulate substantially parallelepiped bodies, having planar surfaces, but they are<br>
not suitable for bodies having substantially cylindrical walls, such as for example<br>
bath-heaters or the pipings used for oil transport in the arctic regions.<br>
One of the methods used so far to obtain the thermo-insulation of bodies<br>
having non-planar surfaces consists in connecting to each other several flat panels<br>
in the shape of bands, for example by gluing together their edges, thus obtaining a<br>
composite structure which can be bent along the junction lines so as to adapt it to<br>
the shape of the body which has to be insulated. However, in this kind of<br>
structures heat transfers take place at the junctions, and therefore the quality of the<br>
heat insulation at these zones is poor; furthermore, a structure made up of planar<br>
parts can only approximate a curved surface, hence there are areas of scarce<br>
contact between the panel and the body to be insulated with formation of air<br>
chambers and, again, decreasing of the efficiency of the insulation.<br>
International patent application WO96/32605 in the name of the British<br>
company ICI describes rigid vacuum panels having a non-planar shape and a<br>
method for the manufacture thereof, which consists in making in the filling<br>
material grooves arranged in a desired direction and having suitable width and<br>
depth. Subsequently, the filling material is inserted into an envelope and the<br>
assembly is subjected to the evacuating step. Finally, the evacuated panel is<br>
sealed. A thus produced panel, at its first exposure to the atmosphere,<br>
spontaneously bends along the grooves formed in the filling material.<br><br>
This production method has however some drawbacks. First of all, it has<br>
been observed that in the course of said evacuation the envelope adheres to the<br>
filling material and becomes at least partially inserted into said grooves so that,<br>
when the evacuation is completed, the thickness of the panel is not uniform in all<br>
the parts thereof, but is lower at the bending lines with respect to the planar<br>
portions of the same panel. Consequently, also the thermo-insulation properties<br>
are not uniform, but are reduced along these bending lines. Moreover, another<br>
drawback consists in the risk of cracks formation in the envelope, which is<br>
pressed inside the grooves, thus enabling the passage of atmospheric gases<br>
towards the inside of the panel which compromises permanently the properties of<br>
thermo-insulation of the panel itself. Finally, as the bending of these panels occurs<br>
spontaneously during the first exposure to air, the panels occupy a notable volume<br>
soon after production, which makes it economically very onerous their storage<br>
and transportation. Another inconvenience of the method of the above mentioned<br>
international application is that it can be used only when the filling material is a<br>
board, for example of a polymeric foam, but not in the case of discontinuous<br>
materials such as powders or fibres.<br>
Therefore, object of the present invention is to provide a method for<br>
producing thermo-insulating cylindrical vacuum panels, as well as to provide the<br>
resulting panels which are free from the drawbacks of the prior art.<br>
Said objects are achieved according to the present invention, which in a<br>
first aspect thereof relates to a method for producing thermo-insulating cylindrical<br>
vacuum panels comprising the steps of:<br>
- manufacturing a planar vacuum panel according to any known procedure;<br>
and<br>
- curving the panel through calendering.<br>
The operation of calendering is well known and applied in the mechanical<br>
field for curving metallic plates, that is, plates of materials having features of<br>
plastic deformation. Inventors however have found that this operation can be<br>
successfully applied also in the case of vacuum panels. This possibility was not<br>
foreseeable because of the discontinuity of the filling materials of the panels,<br><br>
characteristic which does not allow to evaluate previously the mechanical properties<br>
(particularly the deformation behavior under mechanical stress) ; furthermore, in case of<br>
panels filled with polymeric foams, these are generally fragile, and the breaking of the<br>
foam board could have been expected.<br>
The term cylinder and the derived terms as used in the present invention have a<br>
broad meaning, that is, they may be referred to cylindrical surfaces having a base with<br>
constant curving radius (that is with circular base, according to the more common use of<br>
the term) but also with variable curving radius (for example, ellipsoidal or irregularly<br>
shaped).<br>
The invention will be described in the following with reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings wherein :<br>
- fig. 1 shows a sectional view of the calendering operation of a originally planar<br>
panel;<br>
- fig. 2 shows a finished cylindrical panel.<br>
Panels to be subjected to calendering can be of any known type, obtained<br>
through any combination of kind of envelope and filling material, with or without getter<br>
material. The production of planar vacuum panels is well known ; for a description of<br>
these panels and of methods for the production thereof it is to be referred to a broadly<br>
available literature, among which for example patents US 4,726,974 and US 5,943,876,<br>
and patent applications WO96/32605, EP-A-437930 and JP-A-7-195385.<br>
Lateral dimensions of planar panels to be used can be anyone, while the<br>
thickness has generally a maximum value depending on the filling material ; obviously<br>
there is no lower thickness limit required by the possibility of carrying out the<br>
calendering operation, but the thickness of the panel must be such as to ensure good<br>
thermo-insulation properties, which would require the use of relatively high thickness<br>
values. The thickness values really used are derived from the compromise between<br>
these two opposite needs ; for example, in the case of polyurethane foam boards, the<br>
thickness is generally lower than 20 mm, preferably comprised between 8 and 15 mm ;<br>
in the case of panels with filling of silica powder thickness can vary between about 5 and<br>
20 mm.<br><br>
The calendering operation is carried out according to the procedures known<br>
in the mechanical field, by passing the planar vacuum panel between at least two<br>
rollers and a third element of length equal at least to that of the rollers and placed<br>
parallel to the "nip" between the first two rollers; this third element is, generally, a<br>
third roller. As already known, by properly adjusting the position of the third<br>
element, and in particular its distance with respect to the nip between the two<br>
rollers and its height from the geometrical plane containing the still flat portion of<br>
the body to be curved, it is possible to determine the curving radius of the final<br>
product.<br>
The operation is schematically shown in section in figure 1: vacuum panel 1<br>
is moved forward from right to left by the co-ordinate moving of rollers 2 and 3<br>
(whose direction of rotation is indicated by arrows), and forced to slide on the<br>
third roller 4, which curves it upwardly giving a curving of radius R. The curving<br>
radius decreases when roller 4 is moved toward right (getting it nearer to the nip<br>
between rollers 2 and 3) or upwardly in the drawing, and on the contrary it<br>
increases with opposite movements. Cylindrical panels having a non circular base<br>
can thus be obtained by modifying continuously during the calendering operation<br>
the position of roller 4 as described above.<br>
The calendering operation can even be carried out simultaneously on the<br>
planar panel and on another element, such as for example a layer of an adhesive<br>
polymeric foam placed on one face of the panel (or on both of them). In this case<br>
it is obtained a cylindrical panel which has already, on one of its external or<br>
internal surfaces (or both) a layer of adhesive material, useful for fixing the same<br>
panel to a wall of the interspace intended to contain it. This interspace can be for<br>
example that of a concentric double tube piping for isothermal transportation of<br>
petroleum, to prevent its heavy fraction from condensing in cold areas obstructing<br>
the piping; or interspaces of boilers, for example of water-heaters for domestic<br>
use, to reduce the thermal dissipation for energetic saving purposes. To help the<br>
fixing of the panel to a wall of the interspace, it is preferable that it has a curving<br>
radius slightly different from the one of said wall, and in particular slightly lower<br>
if the surface of the cylindrical panel to be put in contact with the wall is the<br><br>
internal one, and vice versa.<br>
The method of the invention has in particular the advantage that the panels<br>
can be bent, with a simple and cheap equipment, just before they are fixed in the<br>
final utilization place; hence the transportation or the storage of big volume<br>
products at the store of the manufacturer or of the final user, is not required.<br>
Figure 2 shows a vacuum panel, 5, bent according to the method described<br>
up to this point. This is different from the panels of the international patent<br>
application WO96/32605 especially because it has not grooves on the internal<br>
surface, and thus has more uniform properties of thermo-insulation.<br><br><br>
