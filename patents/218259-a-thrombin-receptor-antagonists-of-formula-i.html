BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Thrombin is known to have a variety of activities in different cell types and thrombin receptors are known to be present in such cell types as human platelets, vascular smooth muscle cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. It is therefore expected that thrombin receptor antagonists will be useful in the treatment of thrombotic, inflammatory, atherosclerotic and fibroproiiferative disorders, as.well as other disorders in which thrombin and its receptor play a pathological role.<br>
Thrombin receptor antagonist peptides have been identified based on structure-activity studies involving substitutions of amino acids on thrombin receptors. In Bernatowicz et al, J. Med. Chem., 39 (1996), p. 4879-4887, tetra- and pentapeptides are disclosed as being potent thrombin receptor antagonists, for example N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fIuoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-NH2 and N-trans-cinnamoyl-p-fluoroPhe-p-guanidinoPhe-Leu-Arg-Arg-NH2. Peptide thrombin receptor anatgonists are also disclosed in WO 94/03479, published February 17, 1994.<br>
Cannabinoid receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors. They are classified into the predominantly neuronal CB1 receptors and the predominantly peripheral CB2 receptors. These receptors exert their biological actions by modulating adenylate cyclase and Ca+2  and K+ currents. While the effects of CB1 receptors are principally associated with the central nervous system, CB2 receptors are believed to have peripheral effects related to bronchial constriction, immunomodulation and inflammation. As such, a selective CB2 receptor binding agent is expected to have therapeutic utility in the control of diseases associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, osteoporosis, renal ischemia, cerebral stroke, cerebral ischemia, nephritis,<br><br>
Inflammatory disorders of the lungs and gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory tract disorders such as reversible airway obstruction, chronic asthma and bronchitis (R. G. Pertwee. Gun-. Med, Chem. 6(8), (1999), 635).<br><br>
has been identified as a muscarinic receptor antagonist. The total synthesis of (+)-himbacine is disclosed in Chackalamannil et al, J, Am. Chem Soc. 118 (1996), p. 9812-9813.<br>

Similarly, "alkynyl" means straight or branched carbon chains of^ to 6 carbon atoms having one or more triple bonds in the chain. Where an alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl chain joins two other variables and is therefore bivalent, the terms alkylene, alkenylene and alkynylene are used. Haloalkenyl means an alkenyl chain substituted by 1 to 3 halo atoms.<br>
"Cycloalky!" means a saturated carbon ring of 3 to 6 carbon atoms, while "cycloalkylene" refers to a con-esponding bivalent ring, wherein the points of<br><br>

All positional isomers are contemplated, e.g., 1-pyridyl. 2-pyridyl, 3-pyridyl and 4-pyridyl. W-substituted heteroaryl refers to such groups wherein substitutable ring carbon atoms have a substituent as defined above, or where adjacent carbon atoms form a ring with an    ' alkylene group or a methylenedioxy group.<br><br>
The term "Het" is exemplified by the single ring, bicyclic and benzofused heteroaryl groups as defined immediately above, as well as tricyclic groups such as benzoquinolinyl (e.g., 1,4 or 7,8)orphenanthrolinyl (e.g., 1,7; 1,10; or 4,7).

The above statements, wherein, for example, R4 and R5 are said to be independently selected from a group of substituents, means that R4 and R5 are independently selected, but also that where an R4 or R5 variable occurs more than once in a molecule, those occurrences are independently selected. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the size and nature of the substituent(s) will affect the number of substituents which can be present.<br>

Examples of suitable acids for salt formation are hydrochloric, sulfuric, phosphoric, acetic, citric, oxalic, malonic. salicylic, malic, fumaric, succinic, ascorbic, maleic, methanesulfonic and other mineral and carboxyiic acids well known to those in the art. The salt is prepared by contacting the free base form with a sufficient amount of the desired acid to produce a salt. The free base form may be regenerated by treating the salt with a suitable dilute aqueous base solution such as dilute aqueous sodium bicarbonate. The free base form differs from its respective salt form somewhat in certain physical properties, such as solubility in polar solvents, but the salt is otherwise equivalent to its respective free base forms for purposes of the invention.<br>
Certain compounds of the invention are acidic (e.g., those compounds which possess a carboxyl group). These compounds form pharmaceutically acceptable salts with inorganic and organic bases. Examples of such salts are the sodium, potassium, calcium, aluminum, lithium, gold and silver salts. Also included are salts formed with pharmaceutically acceptable amines such as ammonia, alkyl amines, hydroxyalkylamines, N-methylglucamine and the like.<br><br>

The aldehyde 1 was converted to the dienoic acid 2 by a two step transformation. The acid was converted to its acid chloride using oxalyf chloride, which was then coupled with alcohol 3 to provide ester 4. The alkyne was selectively reduced to the cis-alkene 5, which upon thermal cyclization gave product 6. Debenzylation, followed by double bond reduction, gave the tricyclic acid 7. The acid was converi:ed to aldehyde I IB via its acid chloride, which was coupled with phosphonate III to provide l-A.<br>
In compounds of formula l-A, the ethylcarbamate group can be cleaved to provide the amine IA-1, which can be treated with a wide range of electrophiles such as acid chlorides, suifonyl chlorides, isocyanates. chloroformates etc. to provide amides, sulfonamides, ureas and carbamates etc. as shown in Scheme 2.<br><br><br>
The aldehyde of formula IIB can also be coupled with phosphonate 8 to provide NA3, which can be transformed into carbamate I-A4 as shown in Scheme 3. Both I-A3 and I-A4 can be converted into diverse analogs using methodologies such as Suzuki coupling, Stille coupling, Buchwald amination etc (Scheme 4).<br><br>
The arylbromide I-A3 can also be converted to aniline I-A5, which can be treated with many readily accessible electrophiles such as acid chlorides, sulfonamides, isocyanates etc. to provide the corresponding derivatives I-A6 as shown in Scheme 5.<br><br><br>

Those skilled in the art will also recognize that the processes are equally applicable to preparing optically active or racemic compounds.<br>
Compounds of formula I wherein R1 is hydrogen can be converted to the corresponding compound wherein R® is hydroxy by heating with an oxidizing agent such as SeO2.<br>
Phosphonates of formula III wherein W is aryl or R21-aryl can be prepared by a process similar to that described immediately below for preparing the trifluoromethyl-phenyl-substituted compound, Ilia.<br><br>
Commercially available hydroxypyridine derivative is converted to the corresponding triflate using triflic anhydride, which is then coupled with commercially available boronic acid in the presence of Pd(0) under Suzuki conditions. The resulting product is converted to the phosphonate by treatment with n-butyllithium followed by quenching with diethylchlorophosphate.<br><br>
starting materials for the above processes are either commercially available, known in the art, or prepared by procedures well known in the art.<br>

In Vitro Testing Procedure for Thrombin Receptor Antagonists:<br>
Preparation of [3H]haTRAP<br>
A(pF-F)R(ChA)(hR)(l2-Y)-NH2 (1.O3 mg) and 10% Pd/C (5.07 mg) were suspended in DMF (250 pi) and diisopropylethylamine (10 μl). The vessel was attached to the tritiunn line, frozen in liquid nitrogen and evacuated. Tritium gas (342 mCi) was then added to the flask, which was stirred at room temperature for 2 hours. At the completion of the reaction, the excess tritium was removed and the reacted peptide solution was diluted with DMF (0.5 ml) and filtered to remove the catalyst. The collected DMF solution of the crude peptide was diluted with water and freeze dried to remove the labile tritium. The solid peptide was redissolved in water and the<br>
freeze drying process repeated. The tritiated peptide ([^HJhaTRAP) was dissolved in 0.5 ml of 0.1% aqueous TFA and purified by HPLC using the following conditions: column. Vydac C18, 25 cm x 9.4 mm I.D.; mobile phase, (A) 0.1% TFA in water, (B) 0.1% TFA in CH3CN; gradient, (A/B) from 100/0 to 40/60 over 30 min; flow rate, 5 ml<br>
/min; detection, UV at 215 nm. The radiochemical purity of [3H]haTRAP was 99% as<br>
analyzed by HPLC. A batch of 14.9 mCi at a specific activity of 18.4 Ci/mmol was<br>
obtained.<br>
Preparation of platelet membranes<br>
Platelet membranes were prepared using a modification of the method of Natarajan et al (Natarajan et at, Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 45:145-151 (1995)) from    . 20 units of platelet concentrates obtained from the North Jersey Blood Center (East<br>
Orange, NJ) within 48 hours of collection. All steps were carried out at 4° C under approved biohazard safety conditions. Platelets were centrifuged at 100 x g for 20<br>
minutes at 4° C to remove red cells. The supernatants were decanted and centrifuged at 3000 X g for 15 minutes to pellet platelets. Platelets were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5,150 mM NaCI, 5 mM EDTA, to a total volume of 200 ml and centrifuged at 4400 x g for 10 minutes. This step was repeated two additional times. Platelets were resuspended in.5 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA to a final volume of approximately 30 ml and were homogenized with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizes Membranes were pelleted at 41,000 x g, resuspended in 40-50 ml 20 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA. 0.1 mM dithiothreltol, and 10 ml aliquots were<br><br>
frozen in liquid N2 and stored at -80° C. To complete membrane preparation, aliquots<br>
were thawed, pooled, and homogenized with 5 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer. Membranes were pelleted and washed 3 times in 10 mM triethanolamine-HCI, pH 7.4 5 mM EDTA, and resuspended in 20-25 ml 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5,10 mM MgCi2,1<br>
mM EGTA. and 1% DMSO. Aliquots of membranes were frozen in liquid N2 and<br>
stored at -80° C. Membranes were stable for at least 3 months. 20 units of platelet concentrates typically yielded 250 mg of membrane protein. Protein concentration was determined by a Lowry assay (Lowry et al. J. Biol. Chem., 193:265-275 (1951)). High Throughput Thrombin Receptor Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
Thrombin receptor antagonists were screened using a modification of the thrombin receptor radioligand binding assay of Ahn et al, (Ahn et al, Mol. Pharmacol.. 51:350-356 (1997)). The assay was performed in 96 well Nunc plates (Cat. No.<br>
269620) at a final assay volume of 200 pi. Platelet membranes and [^HjhaTRAP were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml and 22.2 nM, respectively, in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5. 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EGTA, 0.1% BSA). Stock solutions (10 mM in<br>
100% DMSO) of test compounds were further diluted in 100% DMSO. Unless otherwise indicated, 10 pi of diluted compound solutions and 90 pi of radioligand (a final concentration of 10 nM in 5% DMSO) were added to each well, and the reaction was started by the addition of 100 pi of membranes (40 pg protein/well). The binding was not significantly inhibited by 5% DMSO. Compounds were tested at three concentrations (0.1,1 and 10 pM). The plates were covered and vortex-mixed gently on a Lab-Line Titer Plate Shaker for 1 hour at room temperature. Packard UniFilter GF/C filter plates were soaked for at least 1 hour in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The incubated membranes were harvested using a Packard FilterMate Universal Harvester and were rapidly washed four times with 300 pi ice coW 50 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5. 10 mM MgCl2,1 mM EGTA. MicroScint 20 scintillation cocktail (25 pl) was<br>
added to each well, and the plates were counted in a Packard TopCount Microplate Scintillation Counter. The specific binding was defined as the total binding minus the nonspecific binding observed in the presence of excess (50 pM) unlabeled haTRAP.<br>
The % inhibition by a compound of [3H]haTRAP binding to thrombin receptors was. calculated from the following reiationsh'—<br><br>
% Inhibition =<br>
Total binding-Binding in the presence of a test compound x 100 Total binding-Nonspecific binding Materials<br>
A(pF-F)R(ChA)(hR)Y-NH2 and A(pF-F)R(ChA)(hR){l2-Y)-NH2, were custom synthesized by AnaSpec Inc. (San Jose, CA). The purity of these peptides was &gt;95%. Tritium gas (97%) was purchased from EG&amp;G Mound, Miamisburg Ohio. The gas was subsequently loaded and stored on an IN/US Systems Inc. Trisorber, MicroScint 20 scintillation cocktail was obtained from Packard Instrument Co. Protocol For Ex-Vivo Platelet Aggregation In Cynomolgus Whole Blood Drug administration and blood collection:<br>
Conscious chaired cynomolgus monkeys are allowed to equilibrate for 30 min, A needle catheter is inserted into a brachial vein for infusion of test drugs. Another needle catheter is inserted into the other brachial or saphenous vein and used for blood sampling. In those experiments where the compound is administered orally only one catheter is used. A baseline blood sample (1-2 ml) is collected in vacutainer tubes containing a thrombin inhibitor CVS 2139 (100 μg/0.1 ml saline) as an anticoaculant. The drug is then infused intravenously over a period of 30 min. Blood samples (1 ml) are collected at 5, 10, 20, 30 min during and 30, 60, 90 min after termination of the drug infusion. In PC experiments the animals are dosed with the drug using a gavage cannula. Blood samples are collected at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120,180, 240, 300, 360 min after dosing. 0.5 ml of the blood is used for whole blood aggregation and the other 0.5 ml is used for determining the plasma concentration.of the drug or its metabolites. Aggregation is performed immediately after collection of the blood sample as described below. Whole Blood Aggregation:<br>
A 0.5 ml blood sample is added to 0.5 ml of saline and warmed to 37°C in a Chronolog whole blood aggregometer. Simultaneously, the impedance electrode is warmed in saline to 37°C. The blood sample with a stir bar is place in the heating block well, the impedance electrode is placed in the blood sample and the collection software is started. The software is allowed to run until the baseline is stabilized and<br><br>
then a 20 Ω calibration check is performed. 20 Ω is equal to 4 blocks on the graphic produced by the computer software. The agonist (haTRAP) is added by an adjustable volume pipette (5-25 μl) and the aggregation curve is recorded for 10 minutes. Maximum aggregation in 6 minutes following agonist is the value recorded. In vitro Platelet Aggregation Procedure:<br>
Platelet aggregation studies were performed according to the method of Bednar et al. (Bednar, B., Condra, C, Gould, R.J., and Connolly, T.M., Throm. Res,, 77:453-463 (1995)). Blood was obtained from healthy human subjects who were aspirin free for at least 7 days by venipuncture using ACD as anticoagulant. Platelet rich plasma was prepared by centrifugation at 100Xg for 15 minutes at 15 deg C. Platelets were pelleted at 3000xg and washed twice in buffered saline containing 1 mM EGTA and 20 μg/ml apyrase to inhibit aggregation. Aggregation was performed at room temperature in buffered saline supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml human fibrinogen. Test compound and platelets were preincubated in 96-well flat-bottom plates for 60 minutes. Aggregation was initiated by adding 0.3 pM haTRAP or 0.1 U/ml thrombin and rapidly vortexing the mixture using a Lab Line Titer Plate Shaker (speed 7). Percent aggregation was monitored as increasing light transmittance at 405 nm in a Spectromax Plate Reader. In vivo Antitumor Procedure:<br>
Tests in the human breast carcinoma model in nude mouse are conducted according to the procedure reported in S. Even-Ram et al., Nature Medicine, 4, 8 (1988), p. 909-914.<br>
Using the test procedures described above, in the in vitro thrombin receptor antagonist assay, compounds of the invention were found to have IC50 values (i.e.,<br>
the concentration at which a 50% inhibition of thrombin receptor was observed) in the range of about 1 to about 2000 nM, with preferred compounds fiaving IC50 values in<br>
the range of about 1 to about 100 nM.<br>
