				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to some improved and novel features of construction for non-air-conditioned road vehicles and rail coaches for passengers. More particularly, the invention provides means for reducing the daytime heat and substantially increasing ventilation in the interior in unique and comparatively low-cost manner; for more passenger comfort from heat and humidity than otherwise possible in stich conventional vehicles, particularly in tropical summer season.<br>
Hitherto it is known that most of the vehicles which are not air-conditioned, become like hot ovens in summer due to the roof becoming very hot, direct sun entering through the windows half covered with transparent glass panes - thus reducing air ventilation, combined with body heat and sweat of passengers, often in crowded condition, causing extreme discomfort and distress. Otherwise air-conditioning in vehicles is mostly too expensive for owners/passengers/transport authorities. Enhanced ventilation and heat insulation is also more healthy than air-conditioning. The present invention provides for the minimising of direct heat and sunlight and maximising the flow of air, to reduce substantially the stuffy heat and humidity in the interior of passenger road vehicles /railway coaches.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides novel features in the desiga and construction of both passenger vehicles / coaches for road as well as railway use respectively. II comprises of but not limited to the features described below:<br>
-2-<br><br>
A DOUBLE ROOF construction, the top/upper roof and the bottom/lower roof below the said upper roof is provided with of a gap between them, the said gap is open in the front of the vehicle / coach and closed on the other three sides; the said upper roof when exposed to the sun covers and casts a shadow on the lower roof, thus offering an air gap insulation to the lower roof against direct radiation and conduction of heat and thus keeps it cooler; secondly, fresh air enters through the said front opening due to vehicle/coach movement and flows through the said air gap and escapes through louvre openings in the lower roof into the vehicle / coach interior and thus ventilates the interior very effectively and uniformly; thirdly, the said upper roof has a sloping down construction from front to rear (in case of road vehicles) and consequently acts like a natural air-compressor, further increasing the volumetric flow of air intake into the gap between the roofs and then into the vehicle interior; forthly, the rear window of the vehicle has fully collapsible glass panel or Venetian blind / shutter type openings, to further improve the rate of direct flow of air thirough the vehicle interior and then out through the rear window, as well as reduce air resistance / drag to vehicle motion resulting in fuel conservation; fifthly, the side windows of the vehicle have adjustable Venetian type blinds/shutters of suitable opaque material like wood / FRP / PVC for minimizing direct entry of midday solar heat and yet allowing more open area for fresh air to enter the interior and retain through-visibility of the outside; sixthly, the front opening between the two roofs as described above is provided with a flap gate or<br>
3-<br><br>
Venetian type blinds/shutters which is manually operated by the driver for stopping air flow into the vehicle interior in chilly winds or rough / rainy weather; seventhly, &amp; down slope is provided in the front portion of the lower roof for draining out any rain water; eighthly, the said front opening is optionally provided with fan(s) of 'air curtain7 or other suitable type (when economically viable) for forced air draft into the interior when the vehicle is in slow motion or stationary.<br>
The invention is described herein below more clearly in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings: Sheet 1 and Sheet 2, in which:-<br>
Figure 1. Sheet 1 is a sectional view along the length of a typical road vehicle, showing the sloping upper roof 1, the lower roof 2 with louvre openings 3; the entry of air is shown in the front gap between the roofs (by arrows in the drawing), percolating through the louver openings in the lower roof, ventilating the interior and exiting through the rear window (this, in addition to a high degree of natural ventilation, may also reduce air-resistance / drag due to vehicle motion and thus result in fuel conservation; the sloping upper roof naturally compresses the air entering for a uniform distribution of air in the interior; the said upper roof is also shown with a double line with hatch lines, indicating provision of heat insulation linings of asbestos / glass wool or similar for further lowering the temperature of air between the two roofs; the front opening is fitted with a flap gate 4 or Venetian blind type shutters for<br>
-4-<br><br>
closing in case of rain, chilly wind or rough weather; the lower roof in the front slopes down to prevent any ingress of rain water; further, in addition to the improved natural ventilation described above, suitable fan(s) 5 is/are fitted near the front opening for forced ventilation during slow motion and stoppages of the vehicle (these can be powered by fractional horsepower motors running from the vehicle batteries and switched on automatically, activated from the vehicle speedometer or power transmission suitably - thus conserving on battery charge);<br>
Section 'XX' Sheet. 1 is a cross sectional view, referred on the Fig. 1, showing the entry of air from the lower roof and side windows through their louvre openings 6 into the interior, indicating that the middle of the vehicle (away from the windows) gets about the same air-flow as the sides near the windows, which does not happen in conventional vehicles;<br>
Fig. 2, Sheet. 1 is an enlarged view of the Venetian folding type blinds used on the rear and the side windows ,. shown in open and closed conditions. The vanes of the blinds / shutters 6 are made of opaque material like wood / aluminium / PVC / FRP and in the open condition shows their effectiveness as a barrier to direct sunlight and shades the interior, still allowing ventilation and through visibility. The vanes of individual windows can be adjusted to the passengers' preference by a lever 7 in conventional manner (as in domestic window shutters), and can be closed in case of rain, cold<br>
-5-<br><br>
wind or rough weather. One or two of the vanes in each window can be of suitable transparent material to allow visibility even in closed condition.<br>
Fig. 3, Sheet. 2 is a sectional view along the length of a typical railway coach, showing the double roof construction with the corrugated type grill openings in the lower roof 8 allowing entry of air from the windward-end-opening 9 between the double roof (this construction allows ventilation through the lower roof for both directions of travel) while the flap gate / shutters of the leeward-end-opening 10 is kept closed; it also shows the large windows 11 at both ends of a coach for through ventilation; these windows can be closed by conventional shutters in winter, rain, for night security etc.<br>
Section ' YY' Sheet 2 is a cross sectional view, referred on the Fig. 3, showing the top opening 9 between the double roof and air entering through the lower roof grills for uniform ventilation, which is not offered by conventional coaches.<br>
-6-<br><br>
