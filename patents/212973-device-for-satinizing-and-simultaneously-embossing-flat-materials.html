				<td>"DEVICE FOR SATINIZING AND SIMULTANEOUSLY<br>
EMBOSSING FLAT MATERIALS"<br>
The present invention refers to a device for satinizing and simultaneously embossing<br>
flat materials, and more particularly to packaging foils, and to packaging foils produced<br>
with the device, whereby the embossed signs are produced simultaneously while<br>
satining the foil. A device of this kind is e.g. known from EP-925911 (corresponding<br>
Indian Patent Application No. 2172/CAL/98), to the applicant of the present<br>
invention. The device for satinizing a foil disclosed in this reference, which is based<br>
on the knowledge from earlier patents of the same applicant, comprises two<br>
embossing rolls that are arranged in a mutually displacable manner such that a self-<br>
stabilizing effect is obtained when the teeth of the embossing rolls interpenetrate,<br>
thereby providing a high processing speed, on one hand, and a high precision, on<br>
the other hand. First of all, this allows a uniform satinizing, and with a<br>
corresponding machining of the teeth, a highly precise embossing of foils is<br>
provided.<br>
EP-A2-0 194 042 discloses an embossed oject on the substrate of which first and<br>
second optically non-diffractive relief elements defining first and second patterns<br>
are embossed, the patterns having a uniform reflectivity and their appearance<br>
varying with the viewing angle. The specification discloses line patterns only, and<br>
no satinizing is intended.<br>
This advanced prior art with regard to the quality of the embossing and satinizing<br>
has led to the desire and the need and thus to the object of the present invention to<br>
provide an embossing device that allows to emboss the flat material with signs<br>
including optical effects depending on the viewing position and/or the light source,<br>
thereby also allowing to produce security features that are very difficult to copy. In<br>
addition to the sign, the packaging foil produced in the device should also be<br>
satinized.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a device<br>
for satinizing and simultaneously embossing flat materials, comprising<br>
at least two embossing rolls, whereby one. roll is connected to a driving system,<br>
said rolls being capable of being driven individually or in common and, being<br>
adapted to be resiliently applied against each other, and the pyramidal or conical<br>
teeth of the rolls having flattened tips, characterized in that the teeth of at least<br>
one roll are shaped such to produce embossed signs in the corresponding<br>
locations of the passing flat material whose appearance changes according to the<br>
viewing angle of the observer and/or the kind and/or the position of the lighting<br>
source.<br>
The   invention  will   be  explained   in   more  detail   hereinafter  with   reference  to<br>
accompanying drawings of exemplary embodiments.<br>
Fig. 1     schematically shows a developed view of a<br>
conventional toothing of a satinizing roll,<br>
Fig. 2     shows the stable position of engagement of<br>
conventional toothings of two satinizing rolls,<br>
Fig. 3     shows a conventional toothing on an enlarged<br>
scale,<br>
Fig. 4     shows a toothing of the invention on the same<br>
scale as in Fig. 3,<br>
Fig. 5     shows the stable position of engagement of the<br>
toothings of two satinizing rolls of the<br>
invention,<br>
Figs. 6A-6F show the effect of a special embossing of the<br>
invention by way of an exemplary sign, and<br>
Fig. 7     shows a possible disposition of several embossed<br>
signs.<br>
As to the fundamental structure of an embossing device,<br>
reference will be made to US-A-5 007 271 to the applicant of<br>
the present invention.  A foil band is passed between two<br>
toothed embossing rolls of which one is fixedly supported<br>
and driven while the other one is freely rotatably<br>
journalled on an axle and is capable of being resiliently<br>
pressed against the driven roll with an adjustable pressure<br>
by spring force or by pneumatic or other means.<br>
In the    device of the prior art, e.g. according    to the    aforesaid    Indian Patent<br>
Application No. 2172/CAL/98, both embossing rolls are provided with a superficial<br>
toothing of the same kind which is schematically shown in<br>
Fig. 1 in a developed view, and which comprises pyramidal<br>
teeth that are arranged in rows extending in the<br>
circumferential direction, i.e. in the direction of rotation<br>
indicated by the arrow, and perpendicularly thereto in the<br>
axial direction.  According to Fig. 2, the tips of the teeth<br>
are flattened, i.e. shortened in practice by at least 2%,<br>
preferably by up to 25% of the theoretical geometrical tooth<br>
height.  Furthermore, the edges of the pyramidal teeth resp.<br>
of the truncated pyramids are preferably chamfered.  Instead<br>
of pyramidal teeth, it is also possible to use conical resp.<br>
frustoconical teeth.<br>
In the preferred embodiment according to the above-mentioned<br>
reference, the rolls have a relative axial play of at least<br>
half the tooth pitch, preferably of three quarters of the<br>
tooth pitch, thereby allowing a mutual displacement of the<br>
rolls into a stable position.<br>
While these embossing rolls of the prior art are provided<br>
with toothings of the same kind, it has been found that<br>
providing at least one roll with teeth of a different<br>
design, more particularly with respect to the tooth height<br>
and the tooth surface, allows producing embossed structures<br>
that may be defined as shadow patterns, where the intensity<br>
of the signs embossed within the satinized background varies<br>
according to the viewing angle of the observer and/or the<br>
direction and the kind of the lighting, thereby producing a<br>
shadow-like effect.<br>
It is obvious that the geometrical center lines of the<br>
teeth, i.e. the grid, must be equidistant as a<br>
synchronization or self-synchronization is otherwise<br>
impossible.  For technical reasons, it is furthermore<br>
advantageous to use teeth having the same horizontal<br>
projection, so that the variations relate either to the<br>
tooth height or to the design of the tooth flanks and/or<br>
edges and/or to a surface design such as a roughened,<br>
corrugated, or patterned surface, or a combination of two or<br>
of all parameters.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 4, two teeth Tl are shown which<br>
are dislgnedas the teeth according to Figs. 1 to 3, and all<br>
of which have the same geometrical dimensions and produce a<br>
normal satinizing, as well as the teeth T2 on the left of<br>
Fig. 4, having e.g. a smaller tooth height, or alternatively<br>
different tooth flanks or surfaces.  In the known embossing<br>
process, the teeth are completely eroded in the locations<br>
where the signs are to be produced.<br>
In principle, the teeth T2 of different height, shape, or<br>
surface than teeth Tl may be arranged in any way, but the<br>
teeth T2 are advantageously arranged in a specific manner to<br>
produce patterns, letters, or other signs.  Fig. 4 shows a<br>
simple arrangement forming e.g. the letter L.  By arranging<br>
the teeth T2 in such a configuration, the letter is produced<br>
such that according to the viewing angle, a hiqher or lower<br>
contrast, resp. a higher or lower intensity is obtained;<br>
while it is assumed here that the lighting source is<br>
constant and stationary.  Alternatively, the position and/or<br>
the wavelength of the lighting source may be varied while<br>
the observer always sees the sign from the same angle, or<br>
both the viewing angle and the light source may change.  The<br>
result always remains the same, i.e. the appearance of the<br>
sign changes as one or both or all parameters vary.<br>
In Figs. 6A, B, C, the respective observer is designated by<br>
an "0", the arrow indicating the viewing angle and the<br>
observer looking at a satinized foil with a shadow-embossed<br>
L from the top right, from the top and from the left,<br>
respectively, in positions 6A, B, C, and the contrast being<br>
high according to 6D, low according to 6E and medium high<br>
according to 6F, while a constant lighting is assumed.<br>
Fig. 7 shows by way of example how it is possible to arrange<br>
groups of signs in order to combine different features or to<br>
produce certain codes.  Fig. 7 illustrates that from a given<br>
viewing angle and under an illumination LS from a given<br>
location, depending on its position, the letter "L" appears<br>
faint at the top and on the right (M), very faint at the top<br>
right (N) , medium strong at the bottom and on the left (P),<br>
and. very strong at the bottom left (Q).  As explained with<br>
reference to Fig. 6, the appearance of a sign changes as the<br>
viewing angle is varied, but also when the position, the<br>
illuminating mode, the brightness and the wavelength of the<br>
lighting source changes.<br>
For the sake of simplicity, the same letter "L" has also<br>
been used in Fig. 7, while it is understood that letters or<br>
numbers of any kind may be concerned.  This procedure is<br>
very useful in the production of codes resp. security<br>
features, and it is also possible to use a sequence of<br>
numbers that changes.<br>
Thus, these special effects on packaging bands, foils or<br>
boxes can be produced in a very large variety, and it is<br>
possible to produce them for any viewing angle and for a<br>
variation of the viewing angle and/or of the lighting<br>
source.  These effects, depending on the viewing angle resp.<br>
on the lighting conditions or on the wavelength of the<br>
light, are a result of the design of the teeth.  Thus, for<br>
example, variations in the arrangement resp. in the design<br>
of the tooth flanks and/or edges also produce effects<br>
depending on the viewing angle and the lighting conditions<br>
because the dimensions of the teeth are very small, so that<br>
variations in the shape or in the design of the surfaces of<br>
the teeth producing the signs will result in optical effects<br>
depending on the angular position due to different light<br>
reflections or diffractions on the embossed object.<br>
Such signs may be provided on packaging materials for<br>
tobacco products, cigarettes, foods, chocolates, drugs or<br>
the like.  such packaging bands or foils are preponderantly<br>
composed of aluminum or preponderantly of easily foldable<br>
paper.  Lately, for environmental reasons, the embossed<br>
materials have been modified in the sense that the embossed<br>
media such as metallized paper, amongst others, are highly<br>
fibrous while the thickness of the metallized layer has<br>
simultaneously been reduced, thereby substantially<br>
deteriorating the favorable folding behavior.  This may also<br>
be the case if a synthetic substrate is used instead of<br>
paper, or if the metallized layer is replaced by a synthetic<br>
coating having similar properties.  Today, multilayered<br>
foils with a paper substrate and a metal layer, and foils<br>
provided with a thin vapor-deposited metallic layer are<br>
distinguished.<br>
So far, the embossed structures with the mentioned optical<br>
effects have been discussed in the context of a roll system<br>
including two embossing rolls.  In order to take into<br>
account the above-described developments of the embossed<br>
materials, resp. their reduced metallization — thereby<br>
enlarging both the field of applications and the<br>
manufacturing possibilities of such embossed structures with<br>
optical effects — a device for the treatment of flat<br>
materials as described in previously unpublished<br>
International Patent Application PCT/00/023299 is<br>
advantageously used.  In this device, the second embossing<br>
roll is followed by at least another embossing roll<br>
cooperating with the first or preceding embossing roll in<br>
order to produce substantially the same pattern in a<br>
subsequent embossing.  This device may be modified such that<br>
instead of embossing the same pattern, the above-mentioned<br>
embossed structure with optical effects is produced in the<br>
subsequent embossing process by providing the additional<br>
roll, or one or several ones of the at least three embossing<br>
rolls, with teeth having different geometrical dimensions<br>
and/or differently designed surfaces.<br>
It is also mentioned in the cited reference that the<br>
embossing rolls may be synchronized to each other by<br>
synchronizing means.  Likewise, the present invention is not<br>
limited to embossing rolls of which one is journalled such<br>
as to be capable of an excursion in the longitudinal<br>
direction of the axis and/or in the direction of the contact<br>
pressure and/or in the passing direction of the embossed<br>
material in order to provide a self-synchronization.<br>
Furthermore, a respective tooth of one roll need not<br>
necessarily engage between four adjacent teeth of the other<br>
roll, as in Fig. 3, which illustrates the case of the so-<br>
called pinup-pinup configuration where the teeth of all<br>
rolls face outwards.  On the contrary, in the embossing<br>
procedures of the invention, it may by useful to positively<br>
synchronize,the embossing rolls, thereby also allowing to<br>
use a so-called pinup-pindown configuration where the teeth<br>
of one roll poin out outwards and the teeth of a cooperating<br>
roll point out inwards.<br>
The above devices allow to produce not only changing optical<br>
effects through embossing, but also security features that<br>
are highly forgery-proof and generally visible by the eye.<br>
Such security features may e.g. be used for expensive drugs,<br>
electronic goods or in the tobacco industry.<br>
