COMPLETE SPECIFICATION (See Section 10, rule 13)<br>
A BACKING-ROLL ON A WINDING HEAD HAVING A TRAVERSING DEVICE.<br>
SAURER GmbH &amp; CO., KG. of LANDGRAFENSTRASSE 45, D-41069, MONCHENGLADBACH, GERMANY, GERMAN Company<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed : -<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention relates to a backing roll	on a<br>
winding  head,  having  a  cross-winding  device,	for<br>
producing cross-wound bobbins from staple fiber,	yarn<br>
according to the preamble of Claim 1.<br>
Problems frequently arise in the conveyance qf high-speed threads. For example, in German Published Application 23 33 992, it is described that, in the production of chemical fibers, which may be spun from polyamides or polyesters, delivery speeds for fiber cables of more than 3000 m/min., for example, 6000 m/min., are used and the fiber cables, which comprise smooth individual filaments, lying essentially iparallel to one another, tend, at speeds this high, to jump apart at deflection points and form jams on rotating conveyor means. As may be inferred from German Patent Application 195 40 342 Al, at such thread speeds, difficulties arise due to the erratic runoff behavior of the threads running off of the conveyor surfaces, particularly if they are subjected to stretching methods which run at a high speed. To monitor the runoff behavior of the threads, the thread speed, which is to be as constant as possible, is measured using contact or backing rolls pressed against the bobbins. In this case, the contact rolls are not driven separately, but are set in rotation by the cross-wound bobbins through friction. For reasons of friction, the surfaces of the contact rollers are typically implemented completely smooth. Smooth contact rollers, however, tend toward jams. For filament threads, the tendency of the freshly spun thread to form jams also exists with very smooth rolls. This tendency  is  amplified  by  the  contirluous  clamping<br><br>
process which acts on the thread. In order to prevent<br>
the danger of jamming, it is suggested in German Patent<br>
Application 195 40 342 Al that the contact rolls be<br>
provided with dents distributed over the cylindrical<br>
surface  shell.  This  is  to  lead to  a  significant<br>
improvement of the running behavjior of the threads over<br>
the surface of contact rolls having a relatively small<br>
diameter.  In this case it has been shown that the<br>
desired  effect  does  strengthen  as  the  surface<br>
proportion of the depressions on the  contact  roll<br>
surface  increases,   however,   simultaneously,   the<br>
conveyor dffect on the threads is increasingly impaired<br>
as the surface proportion of the depressions increases.<br>
Therefore, to ensure the functionality of the contact<br>
rolls,  a I limit  of  the  surface  proportion  of  the<br>
I depressions is considered necessary. The rolls profiled<br>
i in this way are also used as drive rolls for driving<br>
■the bobbins in a spooling machine for chemical threads.<br>
The depressions on these driven rolls are implemented<br>
as flat lengthwise grooves running parallel •' to the<br>
axis. Thte grooves run practically transverse to the<br>
running direction of the threads. In this way, slip and<br>
oscillations  may  be  avoided.  Such  a  roll ■ may  be<br>
implemented as a high-gloss roll, a greater carreer<br>
effect being achievable due to the action of friction.<br><br>
Problems are not excluded even in spooling procedures<br>
which run at significantly lower thread speed,  for<br>
example at a thread speed below 2000 m/min.  German<br>
Patent Application 199 08  093 Al,  which forms the<br>
species,  describes  a  backing  and/or  pressure  roll<br>
having a smooth surface shell.  The requirements for<br>
jamming, as they are present in filament thread, do not<br>
exist  for staple  fiber yarn.  Therefore,  it  is  not<br>
advisable to use the measures described above in this<br>
regard in the processing of staple fiber yarn as well.<br>
During  the  production  of  cross-wound  bobbins  from<br><br>
staple fiber yarns, the twist of the thread is reduced (untwisting) and, in the opposite movement direction, amplified (twisting), by the back and forth movement of the thread during the traversing procedure, as a function of the rotation of the thread supplied (S or Z twist) . If there is only a slight twist in the thread supplied, completely or largely untwisted places in the thread quickly occur. This leads to broken threads or to extremely thin places, Since the thin  places only arise after the typical thread monitoring'devices, they are notj. recognized and are therefore also not repaired. Extremely thin places in spooled threads produce problems during furthe:: processing of the thread, which, far example, arise during unwinding of the thrpad and may lead to costly interruptions and faults in 'the final product. Together with untwisting of the thread, thiere is the danger of "interleaving", in which  the threads are laid as loops on the surface shell of the cross-wound bobbin, and this may also lead f:o the problems described above. The thread spooled using the device according to German Patent Application 199 08 093 Al frequently has an undesired pronounced hairiness.<br>
Neither the undesired hairiness nor the untwi'sting oL: the thread may be eliminated using the known rolls.<br>
t<br>
I ! The  present  invention] is  based  on  the  object  of<br>
improving known backing rolls for producing cross-wound<br>
bobbins from staple fiber yarn.<br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention by a backing roll having the features of Claim 1.<br>
Advantageous embodiments of the present invention are the objects of the subclaims.<br><br>
Using  a  backing  roll  according  to  the  present<br>
invention  the untwisting and the "interleaving" of the<br>
thread, with the disadvantageous effects such as thread<br>
breaks or thin places, is largely or even completely<br>
suppressed. Using transverse grooves, as they are known<br>
from the field of chemical fiber and/or if or filament<br>
i<br>
thread, it would not be possible to provide a remedy of<br>
this typi. The hairiness of the thread is. significantly<br>
reduced, a reduction of a magnitude of approximately<br>
20 percent or more being achievable.	 <br>
t<br>
The frequency of malfunctions may be reduced.  This<br>
leads to fewer idle times and reduces the number of<br><br>
necessary interventions by the operating personnel. Not only may the efficiency of the production procedure be elevated, but also the thread quality and the quality of the finished product produced from the thread. .<br>
In an embodiment of the backing roll which is simple, as well as easy and cost-effective to manufacture, the profiling comprises grooVes which each form an .angle a, which is at least 40 degrees, with a surface shell line parallel to the axis. This is preferably true for a backing roll in which angle a is equally large for all grooves.<br>
The disadvantages listed above may be overcome particularly well using the backing roll according to the present invention if the grooves each extend at least once around the entire circumference of the backing roll.<br>
t<br>
The hairiness is most effectively suppressed using a<br>
backing roll in which angle a is 90 degrees.<br>
i i<br>
If, according to Claim 6, a backing roll is divided into regions in the axial direction, the effect of the<br><br>
backing roll may be improved using an adjustment of respective angle a to the direction of the thread<br>
supplied from the traversing thread guide.<br>
  A corresponding effect may be achieved using a backing<br>
roll in which the grooves intersect on jthe surface<br>
shell.	|<br>
\	I<br>
t<br>
Using an  alternative embodiment of the backing roll, in which the  profiling comprises nubs distributed over the surface shell, the untwisting of the thread may also be reduced or avoided entirely.<br>
Using  a backing roll according to the present invention, the spooling process for threads may be improved in a simple way and an effect which increases quality and reduces costs may be achieved.<br>
Further characteristics of the present invention are described with reference to the exemplary embodiments illustrated in the figures.<br>

Fig. 2 shows a backing roll having profiling in the form of grooves,<br>
Fig. 3    shows the backing roll of Fig. 2 in view A-A,<br>
Figs. 4-6 show  embodiments  of  backing  rolls  having<br>
profiling  in  the  form  of  grooves  as<br>
alternatives to the backing roll of Fig. 2,<br>
i  <br>
Fig. 7    shows  a  backing  rpll  having  profiling<br>
comprising nubs on the surface shell.<br><br>
A cross-winding machine,  indicated as a  whole with<br>
reference number 1, is schematically shown in a side<br>
view in Fig. 1. These types of cross-winding machines<br>
typically  have  multiple  identical  winding  heads  2<br>
between their end sections, not shown here.! Spinning<br>
cops  3,  produced  on  a  ring  spinning  frame,  are<br>
respioled into large volume cross-wound bobbins 4 on<br>
these winding heads 2\    as is known and therefore not<br>
described in more detail. Spinning cops 3 supplied are<br>
positioned in unspooling head 5 and thread 6 is drawn<br>
off  for  respooling.  The  individual  winding  heads<br>
typical-ly have different devices which ensure orderly<br>
operation of these working heads. Fig. 1 shows a thread<br>
6, running from spinning top 3 to cross-wound bobbin 4,<br>
a suction nozzle 7, and a gripper tube 8. Winding head<br>
2  additionally has  a  splicing device  9,  a  thread<br>
tightener 10, a thread cleaner 11, a paraffining device<br>
  12, a thread cutter 13, a thread tension sensor 14, and<br>
an under-thread sensor 15. Spooling device 16 comprises<br>
a creel 17, which is mounted so it is movable around a<br>
pivot  axis  18.  During the  spooling procedure,  the<br>
surface of cross-wound bobbin 4 lies against a backing<br>
roll 19 implemented as a pressure roll and carries<br>
along this pressure roll,  which is not driven,  via<br>
friction. Cross-wound bobbin 4 is driven via the axis<br>
of the cross-wound bobbin using a drive device, whose<br>
speed may be regulated, positioned directly on creel 17<br>
and/or integrated into creel 17. A cross-winding device<br>
20 is provided for traversing thread 6 during the<br>
i spooling process. Threadi 6 slides back and forth on a<br>
guide (line 22 during its displacement by thread guide 21. After they are completed, cross-wound bobbins 4 are transferred using an automatically operating cross-wound bobbin changer! onto a cross-wound bobbin transport! device 23 and transported to a bobbin loading<br>
t<br>
station positioned at the end of the machine or the like.<br><br><br>
Fig.  2 shows a profiled backing roll 24,  seen from<br>
guide line 22, which is divided into two segments 25,<br>
26. Grooves 27 are introduced into the surface shell of<br>
backing roll 24 as the profiling. Grooves 27 are each<br>
implemented as a groove whose cross section remains<br>
uniform as it runs in a spiral around rotational axis<br>
28. Grooves 27 each form an angle a with a surface<br>
shell line running parallel to the axis. The absolute<br>
value of the deviation from the surface shell line<br>
quantified using angle a is constant over the entire<br>
i working width of backing roll .24.  In the transition<br>
from region 25 to region 26, however, the direction of<br>
i grooves 27 changes, so that V-shaped profiling results<br>
on the  surface shell of backing roll 24. Grooves 27 are<br>
distributed   uniformly  around  the  circumference  of<br>
backing roll 24 and have a uniform distance to one<br>
1<br>
another as may be seen in Fig. 3  which is not to<br>
i scaLe in all details. Width B of grooves 27 is 3 mm and<br>
depth T is 1.5 mm. The diameter of backing roll 24 is<br>
24 mm.     <br>
Backing roll 29 in Fig. 4 has two grooves 30, 31  which<br>
run in a spiral shape on the surface shell of backing<br>
roll 29, each angle a being 80 degrees. The direction<br>
of the deviation from the surface shell line  running<br>
parallel I to the axis is, however, different.  Due to<br>
this  course,  grooves  30,  31  intersect  at  regular<br>
intervals. The profiling is adjusted in this way  to the<br>
i direction of the thread supplied in the edge zones of<br>
the  traversing region   through which the effect of <br>
backing roll 29 is improved in the edge zones.<br><br>
Fig. 5 shows a backing roll 32 having grooves 33, which run in a plane transverse to rotational axis 34. Angle a is therefore, 90 degrees. The implementation of backing roll 32 is especially effective in the middle section of the traversing region.<br>
Fig. 6 shows a backing roll 35 divided into three regions 36, 37, and 38. The profiling of middle region 36 corresponds to the profiling of backing roll 32 of Fig. 5. The profiling of both other regions 37, 38 corresponds to the profiling of backing roll 29 of Fig. 4. The implementation of backing roll 35 combines an improved effect in the edge zones, as is made possible by backing roll 29 of Fig. 4, with the particularly effective profiling in the middle section, which backing roll 32 of Fig. 5 has. Backing roll 39 illustrated in Fig. 7 has profiling made of nubs 40. Nubs 40 are flattened on top. In an alternative embodiment of the backing roll, not shown, the nubs are implemented convex.<br>
The implementation of the backing roll according to the present invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiments illustrated. The backing roll may, for example, have a larger diameter. Although a smaller diameter of the backing roll advantageously allows the traversing device to be positioned close to the cross wound bobbin, spooling operation is also possible using an alternative backing roll of 50 mm diameter.<br><br>
