"UNIT FOR PREPARING BEVERAGES FROM SOLUBLE PRODUCTS"<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
'   The present invention concerns the preparation of beverages and in particular a unit for the preparation of beverages from soluble products 5     contained in disposable cartridges. BACKGROUND ART<br>
In known types of machines, the units for preparation and delivery of the beverage generally comprise a collecting device with a seat for receiving ' the disposable cartridge. Once the cartridge has been io inserted in the collecting device seat, pressurised water is introduced into the cartridge, via an inlet port, to form a beverage consisting of a solution or a dispersion in water of the soluble product which is delivered via an outlet port on the cartridge.<br>
As the disposable cartridges are originally sealed to prevent outflow is     of the soluble product during handling, the collecting device is generally' provided with a piercing member which opens one or more outlet ports on a wail of the cartridge, for example on the bottom of if, aiong a number of pre-formed breaking lines.<br>
in known types of machines, the particular shape of the cartridge<br>
20     promotes the formation of a turbulent flow inside the cartridge, thus<br>
permitting mixing of the soluble product in the water. The beverage thus<br>
formed is released via the ouffet ports defined by the above-mentioned<br>
breaking lines and/or by outlet ports in the piercing member.<br>
A-unit for the preparation of beverages of this type has a number of-<br>
25     disadvantages. It has been observed that the turbulence mixing which<br>
takes pface in the cartridge is not equally efficient and complete for<br>
different   granuiometries   of   soluble   products,   for   example   soluble<br>
products for coffee, cappuccino, tea and the like.<br>
\   In fact, the outlet ports that form on the bottom of the cartridge due<br><br>
WO 02/076270	PCT/ITO1/OO1-I7<br>
2<br>
to the piercing are too large and can cause the delivery of non-dissolved product and clots of it from the cartridge, for example at the beginning of delivery.<br>
The outflow of particles of non-dissolved soluble product not only<br>
5     lowers the quality of the beverage produced but can cause partial or<br>
total obstruction of the beverage outlet ports due to deposit of said<br>
particles on the walls of the outlet ports or channels downstream of the<br>
outlet ports with respect to the dispersion flow.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
JO	The object of the present invention is' to propose a unit for the<br>
preparation   of   beverages   that  solves  the   problems  of  the  known technique.<br>
In the context of this object, one object of the present invention is to propose a unit for the preparation of beverages which is particularly is     effective in dissolving the soluble product regardless of its granulometry.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a unit for the preparation of beverages able 1o prevent outflow from the cartridge of particles of non-dissolved product.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide a unit for the 20     preparation of beverages that combines an improved delivery system with a cartridge opening system.<br>
These objects are achieved by the present invention which concerns a unit for the preparation of a beverage from a soluble product, of the type comprising a'collecting device with a seat designed to receive a 25 disposable cartridge containing the soluble product, the cartridge comprising at least one inlet port for a suspension fluid introduced into the cartridge and at least one outlet port for delivery of the beverage consisting of the soluble product and the suspension fluid, characterised in that it comprises at least one throttling arrangement to give the<br><br>
WO 02/(17^,270	PCT/ITm/(HU47<br>
beverage a .aminar fiow as it is released from the carriage.<br>
This allows efficient mixing of the soluble product with the water during delivery of the beverage. In fact, along the *hro?tiing arrangement, i.e. a particularly narrow passage for the beverage as it s flows out, the particles o" soluble product are forced into solution and any clots are fragmented before delivery, thus releasing further particies of soluble orcduct which wiil dissolve more easily.<br>
A throttling arrangement according to a possible embodiment of the invention can be provided between the piercing member in the 10 collecting device and the outlet port of the beverage from the cartridge, providing in particular a piercing member with a portion engaging the cartridge having shape and dimensions substantially equal to those of the cartridge outlet port.<br>
The  engaging   portion   of   the  piercing   member  can   have,   for 15     example, a substantially cylindrical shape with circular section and the breaking line in the cartridge can also have a substantially circular shape.<br>
Preferably, tne engaging portion of the piercing member will have a diameter substantially equa! to or slightly larger than that of the outlet 2n     port in order to provide an interference fit berween the cartridge outlet port and the piercing member.<br>
This advantageously limits as far as possible the width of the oassaqe available for the soluble proauct ana the wafer used for mixing it, making even more effective 'he formation of a ianrvnar flow for the 25 beverage as it flows out of the cartridge. In add'tion, as the interference between cartridge outlet port and piercing member increases, the operating pressure msiae the cartridge increases. Said pressure rcrease allows the beverage TO emulsify more uniformly, creating (3 more ccrs'stent ard attractive cream on *he surface.<br><br>
4<br>
According to another possible embodiment of the invention, the Throft.'ing arrangement is provided be-ween a supposing element of *he cartridge and a wall of the same. The throttling arrangement can thus be provided by means of a rib protrjding from the supporting surface of the supporting element which abuts against the wall of the cartridge comprising the outlet port end which surrounds The outlet port. Alternatively the protruding rib can be provided on the cartridge so that if abuts aga;nst the supposing surface of the ring-shoped element.<br>
According to a further possible embodiment of the invention, the throttling arrangement can be created between the supporting surface of the supporting element and the part of the ca 'fridge wall abutting on the same.<br>
These 'urther embodiments o' Yne throttling arrangement can thus be adopted as an alternative to or in combination with !he throttling arrangement created between the outlet port and the piercng member.<br>
The invention furthermore concerns a cartridge for use in a urit for the preparation of beverages like the one described here, as well as a method for preparing beverages in which the beverage coming out or<br>
the cartndge is given a laminar flow.<br>
I<br><br>
-4A-<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides for a unit for the preparation of a beverage from a soluble product contained in a disposable cartridge, said unit comprising a collecting device with a seat designed to receive said cartridge and with means for supporting said cartridge fitted in said seat, said cartridge comprising at least one inlet port for a suspension fluid introduced into the cartridge and at least one outlet port for delivery of the beverage consisting of said soluble product and said suspension fluid; at least one throttling arrangement formed between said unit and said cartridge to give said beverage a laminar flow as it is released from the cartridge, characterised in that one or more passages are arranged between a supporting surface of said supporting means for the cartridge and the outer wall of said cartridge comprising said outlet port.<br>

15     MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a possible embodiment of a unit for the preparation of beverages according to the present invention.<br>
Unit 1 for the preparation of beverages comprises a collecting device 3 provided with a seat designed to contain a disposable 20 cartridge. 2. The latter can be made, for example, of plastic such as polypropylene for alimentary use able to withstand the operating temperatures of a machine for the preparation of beverages in which a preparation unit according to the present invention is used.<br>
Inside the collecting device 3 is a piercing member 4 comprising a 25     portion 6 which engages with an outlet port of the cartridge 2.<br>
In the embodiment illustrated herein, the piercing member 4 is a substantially cylindrical-shaped member with circular section which pierces the bottom of the cartridge 2 in a weakened area defined by a breaking line which is also circular. The breaking iine consists of a notch 5<br><br>
:2-'05-2003<br><br>

6<br>
(Fig. 2) which defines a portion 14 of the bottom of the cartridge 2.<br>
The piercing member A penetrates the cartridge 2 raising the portion 14 of the bottom of the cartridge 2 defined by the notch 5. forming a circular outlet port which matches with the engaging portion 6 of the 5     piercing member A.<br>
The piercing member 4, at least in the engaging portion 6, has a diameter substantially equal to or slightly/imalUyMhan the diameter of the cartridge outlet port, thus creating a throttling arrangement by means of interference fit between cartridge 2 and engaging portion 6. 10 This allows tUe beverage coming out of the cartridge to be given a substantially laminar flow.<br>
In  the  embodiment shown in Figure  1. the piercing member 4 is<br>
connected to the internal walls of the collecting device by means of<br>
connection fins 12, with an upper end 13 protruding from the fins 12 to<br>
15      resist insertion of the cartridge 2 in the collecting device 3 and allow<br>
raising of the edge 14 with consequent formation of an outlet port.<br>
In other words, when the cartridge 2 is inserted in the seat of the collecting device 3, the upper end 13 of the piercing member 4 exerts a pressure on the bottom portion of the cartridge 2 defined by the circular 20 breaking line 5. raising the bottom edge 14 of the cartridge 2 and permitting penetration of the piercing member 4 into the cartridge 2 until the outlet port defined in the cartridge reaches the engaging portion 6 of the piercing member 4.<br>
The bottom end 15 of the piercing member has a tapered profile 2?     which facilitates outflow of the solution towards the outlet channel 11 of the collecting device.<br>
The piercing member 4 can be produced in one single piece with the connection fins 12 and with the collecting device 3. or alternatively can be fixed in position by means of known methods.<br><br><br>
7<br>
The end portion 11 of the collecting device 3 is a cylindrical portion with circular internal section which connects the collecting device 3 to the beverage delivery channel (not shown).<br>
Once inserted in the collecting device 3, the cartridge 2 is positioned<br>
5     under  a   delivery   plate   (not   shown)   which   during   the   beverage<br>
preparation process is lowered onto the cartridge 2, creates a sealed<br>
connection and lets pressurised water into the cartridge via its inlet port<br>
(not shown).<br>
The pressure of the water let into the cartridge 2, above atmospheric<br>
IO     pressure, forces the beverage to flow out of the outlet port at the<br>
connection area with the engaging portion 6 of the piercing member 4,<br>
thus generating a laminar flow which provides an excellent quality<br>
product.<br>
In fact, as the operating pressure increases inside the cartridge, a 15     more uniform emulsion is obtained and a more consistent attractive foam forms on the surface.<br>
The narrow outlet port also prevents the outflow of larger particles or clots of soluble product not yet dissolved. These particles or clots, due to their size,  are fragmented and easily dissolved during  their passage 2o     through the narrow outlet port.<br>
Figures 3 to 5 show some alternative embodiments of the mixing unit 1 and cartridge 2 according to the present invention.<br>
The embodiments illustrated in Figures 3 and 4 feature in particular a supporting element 16 for the cartridge 2.<br>
as	The supporting element 16 is o ring-shaped element fitted around the<br>
piercing member 4 which abuts on the connection fins ) 2 of the piercing member to support the cartridge 2, limiting deformation of its bottom by the water pressure.<br>
The ring-shaped supporting element 16 thus offers the possibility of<br><br><br>
creating a throttling arrangement between the supporting surface of the same and the part of the bottom wall that abuts on it.<br>
This embodiment of the throttling arrangement can be used alternatively, to or in combination with the one created between the 5 engaging portion 6 and the outlet port of the cartridge 2. If adopted in combination, the effect of the pressure gradient produced between the inside of the cartridge and the outside environment can be further increased, consequently obtaining a high quality product and an even better appearance.<br>
10	According to another possible embodiment shown in Figure 3, one or<br>
more passages are provided between the supporting element 16 and the cartridge 2, for example, to prevent possible stagnation of product residuals.<br>
In the embodiment shown in Figure 3, the passages are provided by<br>
15     means of a series of grooves 17 arranged radially on the supporting<br>
element   16 corresponding 1o its interface with the bottom of the<br>
cartridge 2, thus ensuring correct evacuation of the beverage from the<br>
cartridge even if residuals of product have been left.<br>
Alternatively, as shown in Figure 5, the passages can be made by<br>
20     means of grooves 18 on the outer surface of the bottom of the cartridge<br>
2, arranged radialiy around the aperture defined by the notch 5. In this<br>
case,   the  ring-shaped supporting  element  can  be  advantageously<br>
. produced  with  a smooth interface surface,  as for example in the<br>
embodiment in Figure 4, thus permitting the use of cartridges with flat or<br>
25     grooved bottom in the same preparation unit.<br>
According to the characteristics of the different soluble products, cartridges with fiat or grooved bottom can be used in the same beverage preparation unit,<br>
Figures 6,  7, 8A and  8B show further embodiments of a  unit for<br><br>
WO 02/076270	PCT/IT01/00147<br>
9<br>
prepcring beverages according to the present invention.<br>
The supporting element 16 shown in Figures 6 and 7 features c protruding rib 19. made for example with a cusp-shaped profile on which the bottom wall of the cartridge aouts, thus creating a throttling 5 arrangement which can be adopted as an alternative to or in combination with the one created between the engaging portion 6 and outiei port of the cartridge 2.<br>
The rib  19 is arranged around the piercing member 4 in order to<br>
restrict the passage of the beverage as it flows out of the cartridge 2. The<br>
to     pressure  created   inside  the  cartridge  2  during   delivery  guarantees<br>
contact between the bottom of the cartridge 2 and the rib 19 for the<br>
entire duration of the delivery.<br>
A similar embodiment, adopted in combination with the throttling<br>
arrangement between the engaging portion 6 and outlet port of the<br>
15     cartridge 2. achieves laminar flow in both throttling a.Tangements, thus<br>
increasing the already cited effect determined by the pressure gradient<br>
between the inside of the cartridge and the outside environment.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 8A, the rib 19 on the supporting element 16 has a substantially continuous circular shape and surrounds  the piercing 20     member 4, thus circumscribing the outlet port of the cartridge 2 once the latter has been inserted on the piercing member 4.<br>
Alternatively,   interruptions  20  can   be   provided   as  illustrated   for<br>
example in Figure 8B. which allow limited passage of the beverage out<br>
of the cartridge. This embodiment can be adopted for example in<br>
25     combination with a throttling arrangement already created between<br>
ou'.e* port and piercing member.<br>
Vanous modifications car be1 made, oii falling within the present invention, -or example, -the rib 19 can be made -aenticaJy on the cartridge 2 in a position surrounding the outlet cart. ;n this case, tne<br><br>

contact surface ot the supporting element 16 can be smooth or can also be provided with rib or a seal with shape and dimensions complementary to those of the rib 19 on the cartridge 2.<br>
Furthermore, the number of ribs present on the supporting element 16 and/or on the cartridge 2 can also be varied, likewise other configurations of the rib 19 can be adopted as regards both shapes other than the circular one illustrated in the figures (e.g. elliptical or polygonal) and as regards the section of the rib 19, which can be produced, for example, with flat or rounded end instead of a cusp-shaped end.<br><br>
