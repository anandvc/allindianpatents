				<td>In an attFIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel primers for screening a pre-disposition to schizophrenia. More particularly, the primers of the present invention are useful for identifying and screening non-sense mutation with codon TGG coding for amino acid tryptophan substituted with TAG, a non-sense codon, at nucleotide No. 825 in exon 2 of synaptogyrin 1 gene of chromosome 22ql 1-13. thereby detecting pre-disposition to schizophrenia in a subset of patients and a method thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Schizophrenia is a common and devastating illness afflicting at least 1% of the population worldwide. The characteristic symptoms involve disturbances in perception and inference (hallucinations and delusions), abnormalities in language, behaviour and motor function (disorganized speech, bizarre behaviour and catatonia) and deficits in emotional capacity and drive (affective flattening, anhedonia and avolition).<br>
Abnormal neurotransmission affecting the dopamine, serotonin, glutamine, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and cholecystokinin systems have been reported in schizophrenia (Wolf et al, 1993). These abnormalities may affect genes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism, such as Catechol-o-methyl transferase (COMT) (Lachman et al, 1996) and Tyrosine hydroxylase (Ref); neurotransmitter receptors such as dopamine receptors (Seeman et al, 1993), N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor (Nudmamud et al, 2001) and serotonin receptors (Chiu et al, 2001); and neurotransmitter transporters such as dopamine transporter (Persico et al, 1997).<br>
Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are also strongly implicated in schizophrenia, with reports of defects in neuronal cytoskeleton (Arnold et al, 1991), neuronal cytoarchitecture (Arnold et al, 1997) and migration, cellular polarity, and synaptic pruning (Arnold, 1999). Thus, in schizophrenia, at least two processes appear to be aberrant: neurotransmission and neuronal development primarily affecting the later stages of synapse formation.<br>
Unfortunately, there is no objective laboratory test for schizophrenia, and the diagnosis is made by clinical interview. Since there is a continuing need for developing diagnostic methods and new therapies for such diseases, efforts have been devoted to the characterization and elucidation of the genes responsible for schizophrenia.<br>
empt to device a method for diagnosing schizophrenia, Meloni et al (USPT-<br>
6,210,879) used a microsatellite marker, HUMTH01 present in the first intron of<br>
tyrosine hydroxylase gene for finding association with schizophrenia. This marker<br>
consists of repeated tetrameric TCAT motifs. The most frequently encountered<br>
allele of the marker comprises 10 repeated motifs and a deletion of one base pair in<br>
the fifth repeated motif, which has the sequence CAT. However, while doing<br>
association analysis of this repeat with schizophrenia, they observed that the perfect<br>
repeat (without the deletion) was rare and only present in schizophrenic patients.<br>
Although, not much is known about the cause of schizophrenia, the disease has a<br>
strong genetic component. Research into the genetics of schizophrenia reveals that<br>
this disease is heterogeneous and is a "complex genetic" disease, that is, several genes<br>
may be involved in the etiology of this disease.<br>
Several genetic studies have reported significant linkage to several chromosomal<br>
regions, which include lq21-22, 6p24-22, 7q, 8p22-21, 10pl4-13, 13q32, 18p and<br>
22ql 1-13 (Riley and McGuffm, 2000).<br>
One of the most intensively studied regions amongst these includes several loci on<br>
chromosome 22. Initial genome wide scans for schizophrenia by different groups<br>
suggested possible linkage for markers on chromosome 22q although neither of the<br>
groups reported statistically significant results (Schwab et al, 1999; Coon et al, 1994;<br>
Pulveretal, 1994).<br>
A combined transmission disequlibrium and linkage analysis of D22S278 in 574<br>
families further strengthened the possibility of a susceptibility locus on chromosome<br>
22q (Schizophrenia Collaborative Linkage group for chromosome 22). A further line<br>
of evidence implicating chromosome 22 in schizophrenia has come from the study of<br>
patients with a congenital malformation called Velo Cardio Facial Syndrome (VCFS).<br>
VCFS is known to be caused by deletions in the region of 22qll.2-qll.23 and<br>
patients suffering from this disorder show a high prevalence of psychiatric illnesses<br>
including both bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Arnold, 2001). Taken together,<br>
these independent lines of evidence from cytogenetic studies and linkage analysis<br>
studies suggest that chromosome 22 might indeed harbour susceptibility loci for<br>
schizophrenia.<br>
Apart from linkage studies, an alternative approach which has evoked a great deal of<br>
interest in the recent years has been the study of trinucleotide repeat expansions in<br>
bipolar disorder and schizophrenia (Vincent et al, 2000). Studies of anonymous CAG<br>
repeats using the Repeat Expansion Detection (RED) technique have demonstrated<br>
expanded repeats in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with considerable overlap<br>
between patients and controls (O'Donovan et al, 1996; Morris et al, 1995).<br>
A great deal of effort has focused on the identification of loci containing trinucleotide<br>
repeats as candidate genes for these diseases. The candidate gene approach,<br>
however, has been unable to demonstrate large expansions of trinucleotide repeats in<br>
the range of those seen in the diseases caused by triplet repeat expansions in patients<br>
suffering from schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Vincent et al, 2000).<br>
The failure to observe large expansions has led to suggestions that it might be<br>
worthwhile studying moderate trinucleotide repeat expansions in patients suffering<br>
from these diseases (Petronis et al, 1996).<br>
Applicants have also proposed earlier that a difference in allele sizes or 'allele span'<br>
at such polymorphic trinucleotide repeat loci may also be implicated in bipolar<br>
disorder and schizophrenia (Saleem et al, 1998; Saleem et al, 2000).<br>
As chromosome 22 has been repeatedly implicated in bipolar disorder and<br>
schizophrenia, susceptibility loci on this chromosome might contain expanded CAG<br>
repeats involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. In order to identify such loci<br>
on chromosome 22, CAG repeats containing more than five repeats and mapping to<br>
schizophrenia susceptibility loci on chromosome 22 were identified and studied for<br>
the association with the disease. One of such CAG repeat markers, 22CH3, present on<br>
chromosome 22qll-13 was shown to be associated with schizophrenia in Indian<br>
population (Saleem et al, 2001). This locus is biallelic with 7 and 8 CAG repeats. The<br>
8 repeat allele at this locus was significantly over represented in schizophrenic<br>
patients when compared to ethnically matched controls. The applicants further<br>
identified genes in the vicinity of this locus .Out of these, Synaptogyrinl was chosen<br>
as a candidate gene for schizophrenia since it plays an integral role in<br>
neurotransmitter release, thus, mutations in this gene could explain many of the<br>
defects observed in schizophrenia.<br>
Two recent studies have reported mutations in two different genes in schizophrenic<br>
patients. One of them is a frameshift mutation in KCNN3 gene, located on<br>
chromosome lq21-22, found in only one schizophrenic patient (Bowen et al, 2001).<br>
The mutation found to be associated with schizophrenia is a missense mutation in<br>
WKL 1 gene, present on 22ql 1-13, and is shown to be segregating with schizophrenia<br>
in only one large family (Meyer et al, 2001). Since schizophrenia is a multigenic<br>
disorder, so it is quite possible that this region may harbour some other genes also,<br>
which when mutated might lead to schizophrenia.<br>
In a study involving microarray expression profiling of prefrontal cortex from<br>
matched pairs of patients with schizophrenia and control subjects, it was found that<br>
transcripts encoding proteins involved in the regulation of presynaptic function were<br>
decreased in all subjects with schizophrenia (Mimics, 2000).<br>
Further Double knockout mice for Synaptogyrin 1 and synaptophysin genes have<br>
shown deficits in long-term and short-term synaptic plasticity (Roger et al, 1999).<br>
These studies only suggest that Synaptogyrin 1 is a potential candidate gene for<br>
conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia.<br>
The applicants have consequently examined the role of Synaptogyrin 1 gene in<br>
conferring susceptibility to schizophrenia in Indian population. The human SYNGR1<br>
gene reveals three (SYNGRla, SYNGRlb, SYNGRlc) alternative transcript forms of<br>
4.5, 1.3 and 0.9 kb, respectively. The most abundant SYNGR1 a transcript, the 4.5-kb<br>
form, which corresponds to RATSYNGR1, is highly expressed in neurons of the<br>
central nervous system and at much lower levels in other tissues, as determined by in<br>
situ hybridization histochemistry. The levels of SYNGRlb and SYNGRlc transcripts<br>
are low and limited to heart, skeletal muscle, ovary and fetal liver (Kedra et al, 1997).<br>
Schizophrenia is a multigenic disorder, so the identification of more candidate genes<br>
in addition to those already known is required for predicting the pre-disposition to<br>
schizophrenia rather than diagnosis only when the symptoms have already set in.<br>
This would help in devising life style changes and to have suitable environs for the<br>
subjects predisposed to the disease, which would be helpful in alleviating the severity<br>
of schizophrenia.<br>
Present invention relates to a method of identification of mutation in Synaptogyrin 1<br>
gene for detection of pre-disposition to schizophrenia. Utility of the invention lies in<br>
the detection of mutation in Synaptogyrin 1 gene, which has been envisaged to be<br>
responsible for susceptibility to schizophrenia. The invention also has the utility for<br>
developing therapeutics for treatment of schizophrenia, as well as the constructions of<br>
transgenic animals expressing the mutant gene. A CAG repeat marker (22CH3) on<br>
chromosome 22qll-13 has been found to be associated with schizophrenia in the<br>
Indian population. In the vicinity of this region lies the Synaptogyrin 1 gene, which<br>
plays an integral role in neurotransmission. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to the method of identifying mutations in Synaptogyrin 1 gene. The present<br>
invention also provides the specific primers, which can be used for detecting mutation<br>
in Synaptogyrin 1 gene. The present invention also relates to methods for diagnosing<br>
and detecting carriers of the mutation in Synaptogyrin 1 gene.<br>

selected from the group of sequences - SEQ ID NO: 1 to 9.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention applicants carried out the PCR<br>
amplification of exon 2 of the human Synaptogyrin 1 gene using oligonucleotide<br>
primers. These primers were designed in accordance with the human Synaptogyrin 1<br>
sequence submitted by Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, CB10 ISA, and UK.<br>
(08-DEC-1999) (GenBank accession number- AL022326).<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the sequencing of the purified<br>
PCR product revealed nonsense mutation in exon 2 of human Synaptogyrin 1 gene in<br>
one schizophrenic family. It was apparent, therefore, that there is a hitherto<br>
unrecognized allele or subtype of the human Synaptogyrin 1 gene.<br>

accordance with the PCR Product Sequence obtained using primers (SEQ ID 1 and 2)<br>
flanking exon 2 of Synaptogyrin 1 gene<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the mutated site had either G or<br>
A. The substitution G-»A changes amino acid tryptophan to nonsense codon which<br>
consequently leads the nucleotide sequence of the allelic variant of human<br>
Synaptogyrin 1 gene containing the nonsense mutation -<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention PCR Product Sequence using<br>
primers (SEQ ID 1 and 2) flanking exon 2 of Synaptogyrin 1 gene.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention applicants carried out the PCR<br>
amplification of exon 2 of the human Synaptogyrin 1 gene using oligonucleotide<br>
primers. These primers were designed in accordance with the human Synaptogyrin 1<br>
sequence submitted by Sanger Centre, Hinxton, Cambridgeshire, CB10 ISA, and UK.<br>
(08-DEC-1999) (GenBank accession number- AL022326).<br>
The mutated site is at nucleotide position 825 in the said gene sequence.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention analysis of 20 densely affected<br>
schizophrenia families of South Indian origin as well as ethnically matched normal<br>
individuals revealed the presence of this non-sense mutation in one of the<br>
schizophrenic families. This family comprises of three schizophrenic patients and two<br>
normal individuals. Out of these, the nonsense mutation is present in heterozygous<br>
state in all three schizophrenic patients as well as in one of the normal individuals and<br>
it is absent in the other normal individual. The normal individual having the mutation<br>
may be asymptomatic at present as she is of younger age or this could be due to<br>
incomplete penetrance of the mutation. Further genotyping of 148 schizophrenic<br>
patients and 143 ethnically matched normal controls did not show this mutation.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention to demonstrate the expression of<br>
exon2 (containing the nonsense mutation) in human brain, the applicants designed the<br>
exon 2 and exon 4 specific primers, isolated RNA from human brain, made cDNA<br>
and amplified region spanning the nonsense mutation in human brain cDNA. The<br>
exon 2 containing the nonsense mutation was found to be expressed in brain.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the invention can further provide<br>
diagnostic kit comprising at least one or more allele-specific oligonucleotide as<br>
described in SEQ ID 1 to 9. Often, the kits contain one or more pairs of allele-specific<br>
oligonucleotides hybridizing to different forms of a polymorphism. In some kits, the<br>
allele-specific oligonucleotides are provided immobilized to a substrate, which can be<br>
used to detect mutation in Synaptogyrin 1 gene. Optional additional components of<br>
the kit include, for example, restriction enzymes, reverse-transcriptase or polymerase,<br>
the substrate nucleoside triphosphates, means used to label (for example, an avidin<br>
enzyme conjugate and enzyme substrate and chromogen if the label is biotin), and the<br>
appropriate buffers for reverse transcription, PCR, or hybridization reactions. Usually,<br>
the kit also contains instructions for carrying out the methods and also any other SNP<br>
detection reagent and method like Taqman.<br>

The following examples are given by way of illustration of the present invention and<br>
should construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
Identification of nonsense mutation in Synaptogvrin 1 gene:<br>
This example describes the identification of mutation in exon 2 of Synaptogyrin 1<br>
gene by PCR and sequencing, using certain oligonucleotide primers according to the<br>
invention.<br>
DNA was extracted from human peripheral blood leukocytes using a modification of<br>
the salting out procedure. The concentration of the DNA was determined by<br>
measuring the absorbance of the sample, at a wavelength of 260 nm. The DNA from<br>
schizophrenic probands was then amplified by polymerase chain reaction by using the<br>
oligonucleotide primer 1 and 2 (SEQ ID land 2). The samples were denatured at 94°C<br>
for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of denaturation 94°C, SOsec), annealing (67°C,<br>
SOsec), extension (72°C, 1 min) and a final extension of 7 min at 72°C in a Perkin<br>
Elmer Gene Amp PCR System 9600. This reaction produced a DNA fragment of<br>
1057 bp. The PCR product was purified from band excised from agarose gel using a<br>
DNA ISOLATION KIT (Biological Industries, Israel) and both the strands of the<br>
PCR product were directly sequenced using dye terminator chemistry on an ABI<br>
Prism 377 automated DNA sequencer. The PCR product was shown to be identical to<br>
the exon 2 of the Synaptogyrin 1 gene sequence in the database (accession number-<br>
AL022326), except for the previously mentioned mutation in one schizophrenic<br>
patient.<br>
Example 2<br>
Screening mutation in the population:<br>
This example describes a primer extension reaction used to screen single nucleotide<br>
variants. The DNA samples from 148 patients and 143 normal subjects were<br>
amplified by PCR and the PCR products were purified as described in example 1. The<br>
primer extension reaction was performed on the purified PCR products using<br>
oligonucleotide primer and SNaPshot ddNTP primer extension kit (PE Biosystems).<br>
The oligonucleotide primer was designed till the penultimate position of mutation and<br>
the primer is extended by one ddNTP, which is in accordance with the variant allele<br>
present. The reaction was performed for 25 cycles of denaturation (96°C, 10 sec),<br>
annealing (50°C, 5 sec) and extension (60°C, 30 sec) in a Perkin Elmer GeneAmp<br>
PCR System 9600. The primer extension products were treated with calf intestine<br>
alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs) for removing unincorporated<br>
dideoxynucleotides. The products were run on an ABI Prism 377 automated DNA<br>
sequencer. Depending on the colour of the fluoroscently labeled dideoxynucleotide<br>
incorporated, the wild-type and mutant alleles of the Synaptogyrin gene were<br>
detected.<br>
Example 3<br>
Nucleotide sequence of allelic variants of Synaptogyrin 1 gene:<br>
The nucleotide sequence of the allelic variant of Synaptogyrin 1 gene derived using<br>
the method as described in example 1<br>
Example 4<br>
The nonsense mutation is segregated along with disease in schizophrenic family:<br>
The nonsense mutation was found in the affected members of one schizophrenic<br>
family. This family comprises of three schizophrenic patients and two normal<br>
individuals. Out of these, the nonsense mutation is present in heterozygous state in all<br>
the three schizophrenic patients as well as in one normal individual and it is absent in<br>
other normal individual. The normal individual having the mutation may be<br>
asymptomatic at present as she is of younger age or this could be due to incomplete<br>
penetrance of the mutation.<br>
Example 5<br>
Studying the expression of exon 2 of Svnaptogvrin 1 gene in human brain:<br>
To demonstrate the expression of exon2 (containing nonsense mutation) in human<br>
brain, the exon 2 and exon 4 specific primers were designed. RNA was isolated from<br>
human brain using EZ RNA Isolation kit (Biological Industries). cDNA was<br>
synthesized using random primers and oligo dT primers (1st strand cDNA synthesis<br>
kit for RT-PCR, Boehringer Mannheim). The region spanning the nonsense mutation<br>
in human brain cDNA was amplified using the exon 2 and exon4 specific primers.<br>
The exon 2 containing the nonsense mutation was found to be expressed in brain.<br>
