				<td>The present invention relates to a mold core for a multi-stage intraocular lens.<br>
Background of the Invention I.        Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to molds and, more particularly, to a mold for a multi¬stage intraocular lens.<br>
2.        RelatedArt<br>
Multi-lens intraocular lenses have been disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,488,708 Bl issued December 3, 2002 ("the '708 patent")- Prior to the invention disclosed by the '708 patent, lenses were only single stage lenses with haptics going from the lens to muscle tissue. The '70S patent discloses multi-stage lenses that are stacked, with haptics traversing between each lens, connecting each lens together.<br>
While conceptually an excellent idea, there remains a need in the art to improve the manufacture of such intraocular lenses, such as providing a mold and molding method for making such multi-stage lenses.<br><br><br>
Sumtnary of the Invention<br>
li is in view of the above problems that the present invention was developed. The invention is a mold and molding method for maldng a multi-stage intraocular lens. Specifically, the mold has a core with lens cavities, haptic cavities, and a gate in direct fluid communication with one or more of the cavities. In addition, the mold is provîded with a gasket sun'ounding the core.<br>
In use, molding material is flowed through the gate and into the cavities. As the silicone flows into the cavities, a vacuum is drawn around the core and through the gasket. The vacuum evacuates air trapped in the rnold core and helps puii the molding material through the mold core.<br>
Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
BriefDescription of the Drawings<br>
The accompanying drawings, which are incoiporated in and form a part of the specification, illustrate the embodiments of the present invention and together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. In the drawings:<br>
Figure l is a perspective view of a multi-stage lens produced by the present invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view of the mold, mold core, material gate, and gasket of the present invention;<br>
Figures 3A and 3B are top views of the mold core, illustrating the placement of the gate;<br>
Figure 4 is a side view of the mold core;<br>
Figures 5A and 5B are perspective views of the mold core sections; and<br>
Figures 6A and 6B are pârtial cross-sectional views of the mold core illustrated in Figures 3A and 3 B, respectively.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
Referring to the accompanying drawings in which like reference numbers indicate like elements, Figure l illustrates a multi-stage intraocular lens, shown generally at 10, which is produced by the present invention. It is understood that lens 10 is shown with a pair of lenses, but that multi-stage lenses having more than two (2) lenses may be produced by the method of the present invention. The multi-stage lens 10 is provided with an anterior lens 12 and a posterior lens 14 that are connected by a first haptic 16, second haptic 18 and third haptic 20. The multi-stage lens 10 is preferably made from silicone. The haptics 16, 18, 20 are bendable, allowing the lenses 12, 14 to be adjusted relative to each other. The haptics 16, 18, 20 can connect the lenses 12, 14 at their periphery 22 or in their interior region 24.<br>
Turning now to Figure 2, a mold, shown generally at 26, has a mold core 28, a material flow gate 30, and a gasket 32. The mold core 28 has a pair of lens cavities 34, 36 that are in communication with each other through haptic cavities 38,40, 42. The gasket 32 surrounds the mold core 28, including the lens cavities 34, 36 and the haptic cavities 38, 40,42. The material flow gate 30 is in communication with any one of more of the cavities in the mold core 28. Preferably, as illustrated in Figure 3A, the material flow gate 30 is in communication with one mold core cavity, such as one of the lens cavities 34, 36, and spaced apart from the haptic cavities 38,40, 42. The material flow gate 30 can also be in communication with multiple mold core cavities, including the haptic cavities 38, 40, 42. For example, as illustrated in Figure 3B, the material flow gate 30 is in communication with one of the haptic cavities 38 as well as the lens cavity 36.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 4 and Figures 5A and 5B, the mold 26 can be formed by a pair of blocks 44, 46 that enclose a center block 48. Figure 4 illustrates a side view of the mold core 28 with the center block 48 in place between the pair of blocks 44, 46. Figure 5A illustrates the inner portion of the block 44 on one side of the mold 26, and Figure 5B illustrates the inner portion of the block 46 on the opposite side of the mold 26 together with the center block 48. The center block is preferably connected to a handle 50 that extends through the blocks 44, 46. The handle 50 is equipped with offset pins 52 that guarantee the proper installation of the center block 48 into the mold 26, preventing the accidental insertion in a backwards or upside down orientation.<br>
These views of the mold 26 in Figures 4, 5A and 5B show a particular embodiment of the mold core 28 in which exterior sides of the lens cavities 34, 36 are formed as recesses 54, 56 in the respective pair of blocks 44, 46. The interior sides of the lens cavities 34, 36 are enclosed by opposing sides 58, 60 of the center mold 48. Similarly the exterior sides of the haptic cavities 38, 40, 42 are formed by haptic recesses 62, 64, 66 in.the pair of blocks 44, 46 while their interior sides are enclosed by the circumference 68 of the center mold. It will be appreciated that each one of the haptic recesses 62, 64, 66 has complementary recessed portions 70, 70' in the respective blocics 44, 46. Accordingly, the haptic recesses 62, 64, 66 in each one of the blocks 44, 46 are formed from a pair of parţial haptic recesses in the blocks 44, 46 (i.e., complementary recessed portions 70, 70'). The interface between the complementary recessed portions 70, 70' should be identical in number, position and shape to reduce the potenţial for flashing and/or discontinuities in the haptics 16,18, 20 during the molding process. The blocks 44, 46 fit together snugly at their complementary faces 72, 72' through hardware elements 74 that puii the blocks 44, 46 together. As particularly illustrated in Figure 4, the material flow gate 30 is formed by a groove 76 in one of the blocics 44.<br>
Figures 6A and 6B illustrate parţial cross-sectional views of the mold core 28 according to Figures 3 A and 3B, respectively. The shape of the haptics 16, 18, 20 and connection to the lenses 12, 14 can be changed through tlie use of different mold shapes. For example, the haptic cavities 38, 40, 42 may be in communication with the periphery 78 of a lens cavity 34 or an interior region 80 of a lens cavity 36. Similarly, the haptic cavities 38, 40, 42 could have an accordion cross-sectional shape 82.<br>
In operation, the pair of blocks 44, 46 are locked in place while they enclose the center block 48. A molding material 84 is flowed through gate 30 into any one or more of the one mold core cavities. Then, a vacuum is applied to the mold core 28 through the gasket 42. The vacuum evacuates the air from the mold core cavities and assists the molding material 84 in flowing through aii oi the mold core cavities in the mold core 28.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, the molding material 84 is silicone and fîrst flows from the gate 30 into one lens cavity 34 and then flows into the other lens cavity 36 through the haptic cavities 38, 40, 42. It will be appreciated that, in an alternative embodiment, a lens 86 (see Fig 6B) could be made out of a different material and placed in one or both of the lens cavities 34, 36. The lens 86 would at least partially fiii one or both of the lens cavities 34, 36, and the molding material could flow around a portion of the lens 86. For example, the lens 86 could have attachment grooves or orifices where the molding material would lock into the lens 86. Such alternative lens materials could include polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), glass, and acrylics. Generally, the molding material can be any type of transparent, pliable material, like silicone and hydrogel. Other possible materials include hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA) and polydimethyl siloxanes.<br>
In view of the foregoing, it will be seen that the se-veral advantages of the invention are achieved and attained. The embodiments were chosen and described in order to best explain the<br>
principles of the invention and its practicai application to thereby enable others skilled in the art to best utilize the invention in various embodiments and with various modifications as are suited to the particular use contemplated.<br>
As various modifications could be made in the constructions and methods herein described and illustrated without departing from the scope of the invention, it is intended that all matter contained in the foregoing description or shown in the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted as illustrative rather than limiting. For example, a multi-stage lens having three stacked lenses separated by tbree haptics may also be manufactured by the present invention. In such a case, the gate 30 can be placed in direct fluid communication with one lens cavity 34. Then, material is flowed through gate 30 into the lens cavity 34. As the vacuum is applied through the gasket 32, material flows through each of the haptic cavities 38, 40, 42, and into the connected lens cavities. Thus, the breadth and scope of the present invention should not be limited by any of the above-described exemplary embodiments, but should be defined only in accordance with the fbllowing claims appended hereto and their equivalents.<br><br><br><br>
