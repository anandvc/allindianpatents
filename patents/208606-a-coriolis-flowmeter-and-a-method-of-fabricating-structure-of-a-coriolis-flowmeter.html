APPARATUS FOR AND A METHOD OF FABRICATING A CORIOLIS FLOWMETER FORMED PRIMARILY OF PLASTIC<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to apparatus for and a method of fabricating a Coriolis flowmeter and more particulariy a Coriolis flowmeter formed primarily of plastic.<br>
Problem<br>
Coriolis flowmeters are in widespread use in applications that require the generation of accurate information regarding material flow. This information includes mass flow rate and material density. Coriolis flowmeters range in size from meters having a flow tube .16 centimeters in diameter to those 15 centimeters in diameter. These flowmeters serve wide range of material flows ranging from approximately several drops per minute, such as for use in anesthesiology systems, to several tons a minute, such as for use in oil pipelines or the loading and unloading of oil tankers. Regardless of its size, most of the applications in which Coriolis flowmeters are used require the highest degree of accuracy such as. for example, a maximum error of 0.15 percent. Also, many of the applications in which Coriolis flowmeters are used involve the generation of flow information for material that is hazardous and for which great care must be taken to prevent material leaks into the environment.<br>
It is a problem that these stringent requirements have heretofore resulted in a high cost of manufacture of Coriolis flowmeters. This high cost of manufacture results from the expensive materials that must be used, such as stainless steel and titanium. This high cost of manufacture also results from the complexities of the manufacturing processes currently used to produce high quality Coriolis flowmeters meeting the above discussed requirements. These steps include extensive machining, welding, brazing, and assembly of parts. Another requirement is that flow tubes of curved flow tube meters must have a constant curvature and be free from kinks. These requirements increase the complexity of the machining and bending operations required to fabricate the flow tube.<br>
Another problem is with the brazing operations used to join the various flowmeter elements. Braze joints are typically used to affix the flow tube to the brace bar. Braze joints are also used to join other parts such as driver and pick off brackets and to affix a manifold to the ends of U shaped flow tubes. Considerable<br><br>
care must be taken in the brazing operations to produce braze joints that securely affixes elements to one another and that are free from microscopic cracks. Also, the brazing operation generates thermal stresses in which a brace bar can cool faster than the flow tube or the other elements to which the brace bar is connected. This rapid and uneven cooling generates a permanent stress in the elements to which the brace bar is connected.<br>
Another problem is that Corioiis flowmeters are not devices that are produced in volumes on an assembly line. They are low production quantity devices which are handcrafted and carefully inspected of each stage of the manufacturing process to ensure that each part meets its design specifications and is of the required accuracy before it is joined to another part. This high degree of care is required to ensure that the completed flowmeter meets its design specifications and is free from defects which could impair its output accuracy or cause its failure.<br>
Another problem of Corioiis flowmeters is that they are often required to process corrosive materials. This degrades the life expectancy and reliability of the flowmeters unless they are fabricated using exotic materials such as stainless steel or titanium. These materials are expensive to purchase and are difficult to fabricate. The use of these materials often results in a flowmeter having elements formed of dissimilar materials; such as a flowmeter that has some stainless steel elements that must be joined to a titanium flow tube to provide an all titanium material flow path that is highly resistant to corrosive process materials.<br>
Another problem of Corioiis flowmeters is that metal flow tubes of an acceptable thickness are relatively stiff and resistant to bending. The thicker the flow tube wall- the stiffer the flow tube. This stiffness opposes the Conolis forces generated by the material flow and reduces the Corioiis deflections of the vibrating flow tube with material flow. This, in turn, reduces the flowmeter sensitivity by reducing the phase difference of the output signals generated by the flow tube pick offs. This is a particular problem in Corioiis flowmeters which must use flow tubes having thick walls for the containment of high pressure materials. Thus, the use of any metal flow tube is a compromise between the wall thickness required by pressure containment requirements and the flow sensitivity required of the flowmeter. U.S. Patent 5.157.975 discloses a Corioiis flowmeter having a glass<br><br>
flow tube.  However, it is brittle and does not solve the above mentioned problems of Coriolis flowmeters having metal flow tubes.<br>
Solution<br>
In accordance with the present invention a Coriolis flowmeter is provided that achieves an advance in the art and solves the above problems including the problem of high material costs and difficulty of manufacturing. The flowmeter of the present invention solves these problems by the use of plastic for most of the elements embodying the flowmeter. The flowmeter of the invention solves the above problems using manufacturing techniques which "permit many embodiments of the invention to be formed by injection molding. All embodiments of the invention make extensive use of plastic and injection molding.  In particular, all embodiments have a dynamically active structure that is formed entirely of plastic by injection molding.<br>
In accordance with a first possible exemplary embodiment, a Coriolis flowmeter is provided having a single straight flow tube, a surrounding plastic balance bar concentric with the flow tube and a plastic brace bar that connects the ends of the balance bar with the flow tube. The entirety of the dynamically active structure (the flow tube, the balance bar and the brace bar) is formed of plastic by injection molding. The flow tube ends may be subsequently coupled to end flanges by appropriate bonding techniques.<br>
In accordance with a second possible embodiment of the invention, the elements of the dynamically active structure as well as the end flanges are formed of plastic by injection molding. This second embodiment provides a plastic wetted flow path that extends through the entirety of the length of the flowmeter with the material flow extending serially from an inlet flange, through the flow tube to an ouflet flange. This embodiment is advantageous in that the plastic wetted flow path eliminates problems of corrosion resulting from an interaction between the process material and metal flowmeter elements such as titanium, stainless steel and other metals. With the possible exception of a driver and pick offs, and case, the entirety of the flowmeter is formed of plastic by injection molding.<br>
-  The above embodiment is formed by an injection molding process that comprises a first step of forming" a flow path core mold having a cavity that defines the physical characteristics of the flow path within the flowmeter. The cavity within<br><br>
the flow path core moid is filled with a metal compound of fusible alloys containing bismuth, lead, tin, cadmium and indium. These alloys have a low melting point of approximately 47' Centigrade. The injected metal is then allowed to cool to its solid state at which time the split halves of the mold are separated and the formed metal is removed. This metal defines, with precision, the material flow path of the flowmeter.<br>
The second step of the process involves forming a wrapper mold having a cavity that defines the exterior of the flowmeter elements be formed. The formed •low temperature metal flow path core is inserted into the wrapper mold which is then injected with the plastic that is used to form the exterior of the flowmeter elements. The plastic in the wrapper mold is allowed to cool and solidify following which the split halves of the wrapper mold are separated and the formed plastic flowmeter element is removed. The exterior of the formed plastic defines the desired external characteristics of the flowmeter element. The metal flow path core defining the flow path remains contained with the plastic structure formed by the wrapper molding process. This plastic structure defining the flow path is then heated to the temperature required to melt the low temperature metal flow path core. The low temperature metal melts and flows out of the plastic flowmeter element so that the resulting structure is a flowmeter element having exterior physical characteristics defined by the void within the wrapper mold and having an inner flow path defined by the flow path metal core formed by the flow path core mold.<br>
The plastic flow elements formed by the above process are advantageous in that their extemal physical characteristics are formed with precision by the void within the wrapper mold. The flow element has an interior flow path formed with precision by the low temperature metal flow path core formed by the core mold. This process provides an idealized flow path having walls that are free from the defects and irregularities typical of the current casting processes associated with the fabrication of metal flow manifolds.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides a Coriolis meter having a single curved flow tube formed of plastic. This flowmeter can be fabricated by an injection molding process similar to that above described for single straight tube flowmeters.<br><br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides a Coriolis flowmeter having a pair of straight tubes connected between an inlet flange and an outlet flange. The pair of flow tubes comprises a dynamically balanced structure formed of plastic which may be fabricated by injection molding in a manner similar to that above described.<br>
Another embodiment of the invention provides a Corioiis flowmeter having a pair of curved flow tubes comprising a dynamically balanced structure and connected between an inlet flange and an outlet flange. This flowmeter may be formed of plastic and fabricated in an manner similar to th'at above described.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, all of the above described flowmeters have brace bars formed of plastic and fabricated by plastic injection molding so as to comprise an integral unit with associated flow tubes.<br>
in accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a single straight tube flowmeter includes an associated balance bar for dynamic balance. The balance bar may either be concentric with and surround its associated flow tube or. altematively, may be a separate member parallel to and spaced apart from its associated flow tube but coupled to the flow tube by means of an associated brace bar.<br>
All of the above described alternatives provide a Corioiis flowmeter that makes extensive use of plastic for its parts. Some of the embodiments use plastic only for the flow tube or tubes; others use plastic for the entirety of the dynamic structure comprising the flow tube or tubes, balance bar. and brace bar. Other . embodiments employ plastic for the end flanges so that the Corioiis flowmeter provides a wetted material flow path entirely of plastic. The plastic part or parts of the flowmeters are formed by injection molding so that the part or parts of the flowmeter that employ plastic comprise a single integral plastic element.<br>
The flowmeters of the present invention minimize corrosion problems by the use of plastic materials. These flowmeters are easier to manufacture and therefore have lower costs because of the use of plastic injection molding techniques. These flowmeters avoid the prior art problems of nonuniform wall thickness. These Corioiis flowmeters are further advantageous since the employment of the plastic injection molding provides a flow tube having a controlled wall thickness.  If desired, the side wall of the flow tube bar may have an<br><br>
axial change in thickness in order to accomplish modal tuning. Also, auxiliary elements such as side ribs may be placed on the flow tube or the balance bar to control lateral vibration. The flow tube and the balance bar and the brace bar comprise an integral structure. This integral structure may also include flanges or alternatively the flanges may be affixed at a later time by means of adhesive bonding or plastic solvent welding. The case, if provided, may be either metal or plastic and if plastic may be permanently affixed to the remainder of the plastic elements of the flowmeter to provide a single integral unit formed primarily of plastic except for necessary metal elements such as the electrical conductors needed to operate the flowmeter. Also, a plastic junction box may be glued to the plastic flowmeter after inserting wires through it.<br>
The molds are machined with precision to form flow paths having ideal bends with well controlled inner diameter and outer diameter measurements. Out of round problems of the flow tube flow path are avoided. Also avoided are the non smooth, rough or irregular inner walls of the flow tube. Corrosion problems are minimized by the use of plastic. Also avoided are the failure of brazed and welded joints typical of metal flowmeters together with the avoidance of the thermal problems associated with welding and brazing operations. Also, the meter has a low weight and is easily disposed of at the end of its useful life by recycling the plastic*. The plastic flow tubes are more flexible than are metal flow tubes of the same thickness. This increases flowmeter sensitivity by enabling the plastic flow tube to have a greater Coriolis response for a given flow rate.<br>

A material flow enters the flowmeter at inlet 106 of flange 104A and extends through flow channel 111 of neck 105 and case end 109A to diverter 114 which splits the material flow into two halves which are extended through flow tubes 101 and 102. Flow tubes 101 and 102 extend through brace bars 110A and 110B. Material flow exits the flow tubes at combiner 116 and extends through case end 109B and flow channel 112 of neck 115 and outlet 107 of flange 104B. Necks 105 and 115 couple flanges 104A and 104B to ends 109A and 109B of case 103. The end portions of the flow tubes are coupled to each other by brace bars 110A and 110B.<br>
A magnet and coil of driver D is coupled to flow tubes 101 and 102 to vibrate them transversely to their longitudinal axis in phase opposition.  Driver D is energized by signals received from meter electronics 121 over path 123. The material flow through the vibrating flow tubes generate Corioiis forces which are detected by left pick off LPO and right pick off RPO which generate signals indicative of the magnitude of the Corioiis forces. The output signals of the pick offs are extended over paths 122 and 124 to meter electronics 121 which processes these signals and applies output information over path 125 indicative of the material flow.<br>
In accordance with a first possible exemplary embodiment of the invention, flow tubes 101 and 102 as well as necks 105 and 115 may be formed of plastic by a injection molding process to provide a wetted flow path through the entirety of the flow meter between inlet 106 and outlet 107.<br><br>

The portion of flow tube 201 enclosed by balance bar 202 is defined as the dynamically active portion of the flow tube. This portion is vibrated by driver D to generate Coriolis forces which are detected by pick offs LPO and RPO which apply signal over conductors 122 and 124 to meter electronics 121 in the same manner as described in connection with FIG. 1, Meter electronics applies signals over conductor 122 to driver D to vibi'ate flow tube 201 and balance bar 202 in phase opposition.<br>
All or part of the structure shown on FIG. 2 may be formed of plastic by a molding process. If desired, only flow tube 201 and balance bar 202 may be formed of plastic. The remainder of the structure.of FIG. 2 could then be metal. Altematively, flanges 104A and 104B could be additionally formed of plastic. Alternatively, the case ends 109A and 1098 and easel03 could be formed of metal or plastic independently and affixed by adhesion after the remainder of the flowmeter is formed and calibrated.<br><br>
Description of FIG. 3<br>
FIG. 3 discloses a sectioned Conolis flowmeter 300 which is similar to the Coriolis flowmeter of FIG. 2 in that it has single flow tube 301 coupled by brace bars 310A and 310B to balance bar 302 which is concentnc with flow tube 301. Material flow extends through the flowmeter 300 from inlet 106 of flange 104A, flow channel 111 of neck 105. through case end 109A. through stub 317A and the active portion of flow tube 301 between brace bars 310A and 31 OB. through stub 3178 and case end 1098. through flow channel 112 of neck 115 to outlet 107 of flange 1048.<br>
The flowmeter 300 differs from flowmeter 200 only in that the dynamically active portion of flow tube 301 intermediate brace bars 310A and 310B has corrugations 305 which alter the vibrational charactenstics of the flow tube as described in detail in U.S. Patent 5.814:739. The entirety of the Coriolis flowmeter 300 is made of plastic by the use of a molding process as priorly described. This, of course, excludes the metallic conductors of coils of left pick off LPO, right pick off RPO. driver D, and their associated magnets.<br>
If desired, the case 103 may be fabricated independently and affixed to the remainder of the elements of the flowmeter by means of adhesive bonding. Also if desired, the case may be formed of metal. However, the dynamically active portion of the flowmeter including the entirety of flow tube 101 advantageously will be plastic formed by a molding operation. Description of FIG. 4<br>

Description of Plastic Injection Molding Process of Coriolis Flowmeters Description of FIGS. 7 and 8<br>
The first step in the injection molding process of the present invention is to fabricate a core mold which is used to form the flow path core required in the next step of the injection molding process.  FIG. 7 discloses a core mold 700 having an upper half 701, a lower half 702 and vent holes 703 and 704 which are used to inject plastic into the cavity which is designated generally as 706. Cavity segment 706 includes flow path core cavity segments 706A. 706B. 706C. 706D. 706E. and 706F. Cavity segment 706 further includes manifold cavity segments 707 and 708 and core locating segments 719 and 720. The flow path core shown on FIG. 8 is formed by the core path mold 700 of FIG. 7 when the upper half 701 is lowered so that its bottom surface contacts the upper surface 709 of lower half 702. Following this, a low temperature fusible alloy is injected into one of holes 703 or 704 with the other being used as an air vent.<br>
After the injected metal alloy solidifies, the two halves 701 and 702 of the mold are separated with the metal alloy within the cavity segments of FIG. 7 defining the flow path core of FIG. 8. These include flow path core segments 801 and 802 as well as manifold core segments 807. 808. 803. 804. 806 and 809. The<br><br>
core of FIG. 8 also includes locating protrusions 819 on the left and 820 on the<br>
right (not shown).<br>
Description of FIGS. 9. 10 and 11<br>
FIG. 9 discloses the wrapper mold 900 which is used to fabricate a completed flowmeter using the flow path cores of FIG. 8. Wrapper mold 900 comprise an upper half 901, and a lower half 902 which are shown separated but which are joined during the injection molding process.<br>
The process begins when the molded flow path core 800 of FIG, 8 is inserted into the cavity of lower half 902. This cavity on FIG. 9 has structure designated generally as 928 and 929 for the flow tube elements to be formed, and 904A and 906A for the manifolds of the flowmeter. The molded flow path core 800 shown on FIG. 8 is inserted into the cavity of the lower half 902. The rectangular protrusions 819 and 820 (not shown) on the core ends fit into rectangular cavity segments 919 and 920 in the mold to locate the flow path core within the cavity. The upper half 901 is then lowered so that it's bottom surface contacts the upper surface 911 of lower half 902 following which plastic is injected into either opening<br>
903	or 913 of upper half 901 with the other opening being used as an air vent. The<br>
injected plastic flows into the cavity segments of the wrapper mold and surrounds<br>
the metallic flow path molded core now positioned within cavity segments 928 and<br>
929 of lower half 902. FIG. 9 shows cavity segments 907A and 908A for brace<br>
bars 907 and 908 and pick offs and drive brackets which are formed during this<br>
molding process.     After the plastic has time to cure and solidify, the upper and<br>
lower halves 901, 902 of mold 900 are separated and the partially completed<br>
Coriolis plastic flowmeter shown on FIG. 10 is then removed from the cavity<br>
segments of lower half 902.<br>
Following its removal from the cavity of wrapper mold 900, the formed structure is heated to the level required to melt the metal flow path core 800 contained within the plastic structure. The metal melts, flows out and leaves the flowmeter structure 1100 shown on FIG. 11 which includes two flow tubes 1001 and 1002 having hollow centers formeriy occupied by the metal flow path core 800 shown on FIG. 8. The structure shown on FIG. 11 also includes input manifold 904 and output manifold 906 brace bars 907 and 908. Opening 803 of input manifold<br>
904	receives a material flow into the input of the flowmeter and diverts this flow into<br><br>
two parts which are extended through flow tubes 1001 and 1002 to output manifold 906 which combines the two flows into a single material flow.  Exit manifold 906 receives this dual flow and combines it into a single flow. Descnotion of FIG. 12<br>
FIG. 12 shows a completed Coriolis flowmeter 1200 formed by the injection molding process described for FIGS. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.  Flowmeter 1200 is assembled using the flowmeter structure 1100 of FIG. 11.  Pick offs LPO and RPO and dnver D including their coils and magnets (not shown) are fastened to structure 1100 and wires 1222, 1223, and 1224 are connected from pick offs LPO and RPO and driver D to electrical feed through 1221 in the case 1201. Case 1201 is then adhesive bonded to the exterior surfaces of manifolds 904 and 906.  Following that, flanges 1202 and 1203 are adhesive bonded to the axial end portions of case 1201 as well as to the radial exterior cylindrical surfaces of manifolds 904 and 906.<br>
Flanges 1202 and 1203 include elements 1212 which are the radial outer surfaces of each flange, an axial inner face 1206 and an axial outer face 1207, a beveled surface 1211. and a stub 1209 having an axially inner surface 1208 which is adhesively bonded to the outer axial extremities of case 1201.<br>
Also shown on FIG. 12 is meter electronics 1221 which over conductor 1223 applied signals required to energize driver D to vibrate flow tubes 1001 and 1002 in phase opposition. Conductors 1222 and 1224 receive the signals from pick offs LPO and RPO representing the Coriolis forces induced in vibrating flow tubes 1001 and 1002 with material flow. Meter electronics receive these signals over conductors 1222 and 1224, processes the signals and applied output information to path 1225 pertaining to the material flow. Descnotions of FIG. 13<br>
FIG. 13 discloses the lower portion 1301 of the wrapper mold 1300 used to fabricate the Coriolis flowmeter of FIG. 5 by injection molding to produce an all plastic flowmeter with the exception of metal conductors in driver D and pick offs LPO and RPO of FIG. 5. Wrapper mold 1300 includes a lower wrapper mold 1301 having cavity segments that define the exterior of the Coriolis flowmeter of FIG. 5. In order to facilitate an understanding of the correspondence between the elements on FIG. 5 and the cavity segments in the wrapper mold portion 1301, the last two digits of each reference number on the two drawings (excluding<br><br>
alphabetical characters) specifies the correspondence. Thus, flow tubes 552A and 552B on FIG. 5 are defined by cavity segments 1352A and 1352B on FIG. 13.<br>
In describing the function of wrapper mold 1300. it is assumed that the flow path core has been formed as phoriy described to form a metal structure representing the flow path of flow tubes 552A and 552B as well as the interior of the structural elements connected to the flow tubes such as flow path necks 570A and 570B. This formed flow path core is inserted into the cavity segments of the wrapper mold 1301.<br>
The cavity segments on FIG. 13 include segments 1352A and 1352B which define a pair of substantially U-shaped flow tubes; cavity segments 1354A and 1354B which define the right side legs of the flow tubes; cavity segments1320 and 1321 which define brace bars 520 and 521 of FIG. 5; cavity segments 1350A. B, C, and D which define flow channels 550A. B, C, and D of FIG. 5; cavity segments1302A and 1302B which define manifolds 502A and 502B; and cavity segments 1370A and 1370B which define flow path necks 570A and 570B.<br>
The flowmeter structure of FIG. 5 is formed when a flow path core of a low melting temperature alloy is inserted into the cavity of mold segment 1302. Then an upper mafing mold having cavity segments complementary to that of lower wrapper mold 1301 and having a recess for accommodating the center upwardly extending segment 1302 of wrapper mold 1301 is lowered onto wrapper mold 1301 to form an enclosed volume. The structure of FIG. 5 is formed when plastic is injected into the wrapper mold cavity segments . After the inserted and injected plastic has solidified, the upper and lower portions of wrapper mold 1300 are separated and the formed structure is removed from the cavity segments of wrapper mold 1301. The flow path core is then removed by melting. The remaining structure is identical to that shown on FIG. 5 with the exception of flanges 501A and 501B. They are' separately formed and affixed by adhesive bonding to the flow path necks 570A and 570B to form the completed all plastic flowmeter of FIG. 5. Description of FIG. 14<br>
FIG. 14 discloses the details of a wrapper mold 1400 used to fabricate the single straight tube Coriolis flowmeter of FIG. 2. The cavity segments on FIG. 14 are identified by reference numbers whose last two digits (not including<br><br>
alphabetical characters) are identical to the last two digits of the parts of the flowmeter of FIG. 2 to which the cavity elements of FIG. 14 correspond.<br>
Prior to the using wrapper moid 1400, a flow path core is formed by the priorly described techniques to define a metal element representing the flow path of flow tube 101 of FIG. 2. This core on FIG. 14 is the elongated cross hatched element 1401 extending the length of the cavity structure. Core 1401 extends the length of the flowmeter from cavity segment 1404A. defining flange 104A of FIG. 2. to output flange cavity segment defining flange 104A on FIG. 2. The use of wrapper mold 1400 also requires that a core be previously formed representing the space between inner wall of balance bar 202 and exterior of flow tube 201 on FIG. 2. This balance bar core is the cross hatch area designated as element 1403. Cavity element 1402 represents the cavity segment that will be filled with plastic during the injection molding operation to define balance bar 202. Element 1403 includes upwardly projecting stubs LPO, D, and RPO to define openings in the balance bar 202 for receiving driver D, and pick offs LPO and RPO. The mating downwardly projecting stubs on cross hatch element 1402 are used to define openings in the bottom portion of balance bar 202. These openings are used during the manufacturing process to permit adjustments of the flow tube and balance bar for vibration control and tuning. They afso locate the balance bar core in the wrapper mold cavity.<br>
Elements 1417A and 1417B are the segments of the cavity segment that defines flow tube stubs 217A and 217B. Cavity segments 1410A and 1410B -   define brace bars 21 DA and 2108, cavity segments 1409A and 1409B define case ends 109A and 109B. Cavity segments 1405A and 1415B define necks 105 and 115 of FIG. 2 connecting the case ends to the flanges. Cavity segments 1404A and 1404B define flanges 104A and 104B.<br>
The flowmeter of FIG. 2 is formed by wrapper mold 1400 by the steps of forming the flow path core 1401, forming the balance bar core 1403, inserting the balance bar core 1403 over the flow path core 1401. positioning cores 1401 and 1403 within the cavity segments of the wrapper mold 1400 on FIG. 14, lowering the upper half (not shown) of wrapper mold 1400 onto the lower half shown on FIG. 14 injecting plastic into the cavity segments of the wrapper mold of FIG. 14. allowing the injected plastic to cure and solidify, separating the two halves of the wrapper<br><br>
mold 1400. removing the formed solidified plastic matenal which then has a physical appearance of the Coriolis flowmeter of FIG. 2 with the exception of the meter electronics and conductors and driver D and pick offs LPO and RPO. The formed structure is then heated a sufficient amount to melt the core material which flows out of the interior of the formed structure leaving a completed all plastic flowmeter identical to that of FIG. 2 with the exception of the necessary metal elements including the conductors of the coils of driver D and the pick offs LPO and RPO as well as the conductors extending to meter electronics 121.

Description of FIG. 17<br>
FIG. 17 illustrates the process steps used to form the single straight tube Coriolis flowmeter 200 using the wrapper mold of FIG. 14.<br>
The process begins with step 1702 in which the material flow path core 1401 is formed of low temperature metai or soluble material using a core mold similar to that of core mold 700 but not otherwise shown.<br>
In step 1704. core 1403 is formed defining the space between the exterior of the molded full flow path core 1401 and the inner surface of balance bar 202.<br>
• In step 1706, the flow path core 1401 is inserted axiaJly into the open end of core 1403.<br>
in step 1708, cores 1401 and 1403 are inserted into the cavity of wrapper mold 1400 with the cavity having an inner surface defining the plastic Coriolis flowmeter structure 200.<br>
In step 1710, plastic is injected into the cavities of wrapper mold 1400 which contains the cores 1401 and 1403.<br>
In step 1712, the formed plastic Coriolis structure 200 is removed from wrapper moid 1400.<br>
In step 1714, cores 1401 and 1403 are removed from the formed plastic Coriolis flowmeter structure 200 by heating the low temperature metal comprising the cores or by dissolving the soluble material comprising the cores using hot water.<br>
It is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the described embodiment: but that it may be used with other types of Coriolis flowmeters including single tube flowmeters of irregular or curved configuration. For example, it has been described how a Coriolis plastic flowmeter can be formed by the use of injection molding. If desired, the entirety of the described Coriolis flowmeters can be formed by a single injection molding operation. Alternatively an all plastic flowmeter can be fomned by separate injection molding or other forming operations in which parts are formed separately and later joined together by means of adhesive bonding. This is particulariy true for certain embodiments in which it may be desirable to form the case as a separate element which is later bonded to elements prioriy formed by injection bonding. Alternatively, in some applications it: may be desirable to form the case of metal rather than plastic for applications in<br><br>
which increased physical protection of the dynamically active portions of the flowmeter is desired.  In this case, the metal case can be separately formed and applied by appropriate bonding techniques to the remaining portions of the flowmeter which may be priorly formed by appropriate injection molding techniques. It is to be understood that the use of the term plastic flowmeter does not include certain elements which of necessity must be formed of metal. These include the coils of the drivers and pick offs and the electrical conductors extending to the associated meter electronics and drive and pick off magnets.<br>
