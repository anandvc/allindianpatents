The preparation processes according to the invention are illustrated in detail hereinbelow.<br>
Process A1-hexarvlene:<br>
Step a) - Process A1-hexarvlene:<br><br>
In the inventive process A1 for preparing the hexarylenetetracarboximides te (het)aryloxy- and (het)arylthio-substituted on the reline ring, a diborane II is reacted in step a) with a1) a 9-bromoperylene-3,4-dicarboximide Ilia or a2) a 1,5-disubstituted naphthalene derivative lllb. The naphthalene derivative lllb bears an X radical (halogen atom or alkyl- or arylsulfonyl radical) which can react with the diborane II, and also a nitro group which enables the subsequent reactions of the terryiene-3,4-dicarboximide formed in step d).<br>
9-Bromoperylene-3,4-dicarboximide Ilia and naphthalene derivative lllb are referred to together hereinbelow as "reactant III".<br>

In process technology terms, the procedure is likewise appropriately analogous to step g1) or g2) of process A1-hexarylene.<br>
To purify the resulting pentarylenetetracarboximide lb, it is likewise possible to undertake a rapid filtration through silica gel with washing with a mixture of polar- and nonpolar-aprotic solvents, for example methylene chloride/hexane or pentane, and also column chromatography on silica gel with methylene chloride as an eiuant or repeated washing with hexane or pentane.<br>
The yield in step b1) is generally from 90 to 100%; the yield in step b2) is typically from 90 to 100%.<br>

Process A2-pentarvlene:<br>
In analogy to process A2-hexarylene, in the inventive process A2 for preparing pentarylenetetracarboximides lb which are (het)aryloxy" and (het)arylthio-substituted in the rylene ring, an 11-(dioxaborolan-2-yl)terrylene-3,4-dicarboximide Vld and a 9-bromoperylene-3,4-dicarboximide Ilia are subjected to a Suzuki coupling reaction, and the 11-(9-perylene-3,4-dicarboximide)terrylene-3,4-dicarboximide VIII formed is cyclodehydrogenated.<br>
Step a) - Process A2-pentarvlene:<br>
The Suzuki coupling reaction between the 11-(dioxaborolan-2-yl)terrylene-3,4-dicarboximide Vld, which should be prepared as described in step a) of process A2-hexarylene, and the 9-bromoperylene-3,4-dicarboximide Ilia in step a) is undertaken analogously to step b) of process A1-hexarylene in the presence of an organic solvent, if desired in a mixture with water, and also of a transition metal catalyst and of a base.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately likewise analogous to step b) of process Al-hexarylene. A further purification of the 11-(9-perylene"3,4-dicarboximide)terrylene-3,4-dicarboximide VIII which has been isolated by removing the organic phase and distilling off the solvent is typically again not required, but may likewise be effected by washing with a solvent which dissolves the impurities, such as<br><br>

Step a) - Process B-hexarylene:<br>
In step a) of this process, a diborane II is reacted with a1) a 9-bromoperylene-3,4" dicarboximide Ilia or a2) a 3,9- or 3,10-dihaloperylene IXa.<br>
The dihaloperylenes IXa are typically mixtures of the 3,9- and 3,10-isomer. Accordingly, the bis(dioxaborolan-2-yl)perylenes IXb prepared from them in step a) are also obtained as a mixture of 3,9- and 3,10-isomer. This applies correspondingly to the coupling products Xa and Xb formed in step b) from the disubstituted perylenes IXa or IXb. For the sake of simplicity, the particular isomers are listed in the description and the claims as separate species. However, the invention is also intended to comprise the isomer mixtures.<br>
The reaction is undertaken analogously to step a) of process A1-hexarylene in the presence of an aprotic organic solvent, of a transition metal catalyst and of a base.<br>
Since both halogen atoms of the dihaloperylene IXa are replaced by dioxaborolan-2-yl radicals, double the amount of diborane II is required here, i.e. typically from 2 to 4 mol, in particular from 2 to 3 mol, of diborane II are used per mole of dihaloperylene IXa.<br><br>
The amount of transition metal catalyst and base should likewise be doubled; the amount of solvent and the further reaction conditions correspond to step a) of process A1-hexarylene.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately likewise as described for step a) of process A1-hexarylene. A further purification of the 9-(dioxaborolan-2-yl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximide IVa and/or 3,9- or 3,10-bis(dioxaborolan-2-yl)perylene IXb which is isolated here too by filtering off the solid constituents and distilling off the solvent is typically again not required, but may likewise be effected by washing with a solvent which dissolves the impurities, such as water, or by column chromatography on silica gel with a mixture of methylene chloride and hexane or pentane or with toluene as an eluent.<br>

By virtue of use of two different 9-(dioxaborolan-2-yl)perylene-3,4-dicarboximides IVa or 9-bromoperylenedicarboximides Ilia, the possibility exists here too of preparing unsymmetrical hexarylenetetracarboximides la.<br>
The coupling is carried out analogously to step b) of process Al-hexarylene in the presence of an organic solvent, if desired in a mixture with water, and also of a transition metal catalyst and of a base.<br><br>
However, double the amounts again of transition metal catalyst and base are used. The amount of solvent and the further reaction conditions correspond to step b) of process Al-hexarylene.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately likewise as described for step b) of process Al-hexarylene. A further purification of the perylene-3,9-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xa and/or perylene"3,10-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xb which is isolated here too by removing the organic phase and distilling off the solvent is typically again not required, but may likewise be effected by washing with a solvent which dissolves the impurities, such as water, or by column chromatography on silica gel with a mixture of methylene chloride and hexane or pentane or with toluene as an eluent.<br>

In the one-stage procedure c1), the perylene-3,9-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xa and/or perylene-3,10-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xb is contacted with a strong Lewis acid in the presence of an inert organic solvent.<br>
Suitable solvents are in principle all organic solvents which are inert under the reaction conditions, preference being given to polar-aprotic solvents.<br>
Examples of particularly suitable solvents are halogenated and nitrated aromatic hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, di- andtrichiorobenzenes and nitrobenzene.<br>
The amount of solvent is generally from 10 to 100 ml, preferably from 20 to 40 ml, per g of perylene-3,9-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xa and/or perylene-3,10-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xb.<br>

The reaction temperature is generally from 20 to 120°C, preferably from 45 to 80'C.<br>
The reaction time is generally from 0.25 to 48 h, in particular from 0.25 to 8 h.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately to stir a mixture of perylene-3,9-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xa and/or perylene-3,10-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xb, solvent and Lewis acid at the desired reaction temperature for from 0.25 to 28 h, to distill off the solvent after cooling to room temperature and to wash the hexarylenetetracarboximide la formed first with dilute inorganic acid, for example dilute hydrochloric acid, and then with water, and to filter it off.<br>
For further purification, the (het)aryloxy- or (het)arylthio-substituted hexarylenetetracarboximides la may be washed repeatedly with hexane or pentane, and subjected to a rapid filtration through silica gel with washing with a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride, or column chromatography on silica gel with methylene chloride as an eluent. Unsubstituted hexarylenetetracarboximides la (R' = H) may be purified by washing with acetone and subsequently with methylene chloride.<br>
The yield in the one-stage cyclodehydrogenation c1) is generally from 20 to 30%.<br>
In the two-stage procedure c2), the perylene-3,9-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xa and/or perylene-3,10-bis(perylene*3,4-djcarboximide) Xb is contacted in a first step c2a) with a weak Lewis acid at room temperature in the presence of an inert organic solvent<br>
The 13-(9-peryiene-3,4-dicarboximide)quaterrylene-3,4-dicarboximideXI is then, after intermediate isolation, in a second step c2b) analogous to step g) of process A1-hexarylene, cyclodehydrogenated further to the hexarylenetetracarboximide la. The cyclodehydrogenation may be undertaken c2ba) in an organic reaction medium which has hydroxyl and amino functions and comprises a substantially undissolved base (analogously to step g1) of process A1-hexarylene) or c2b(3) in the presence of a base-stable, high-boiling organic solvent and also of an alkali metal- or alkaline earth metal-containing base and of a nitrogen-containing auxiliary base (analogously to step g2) of process A1-hexarylene). Here too, preference is given to process variant c2a).<br>
The two-stage procedure c2) has the advantage that, owing to the milder reaction conditions in the first cyclodehydrogenation step c2a), the risk of undesired elimination of alkyl substituents on the aromatic R or R' radicals is reduced.<br><br>
In step c2a), the same solvents may be used in the same amounts as in the one-stage procedure c1), the same preferences applying.<br>
Suitable weak Lewis acids are in particular iron(lll) halides such as iron(lll) chloride and iron(III) bromide, preference being given to iron(lll) chloride. The weak Lewis acids may be used in the same amounts as the strong Lewis acids in the one-stage procedure c1).<br>
However, the reaction is carried out in step c2a) at temperatures around room temperature, i.e. it is generally unnecessary to heat the reaction mixture.<br>
The reaction times are typically from about 4 to 48 h, in particular from 8 to 24 h.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately to heat perylene-3,9-bis(perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xa and/or perylene-3,10-bis{peryiene-3,4-dicarboximide) Xb, solvent and Lewis acid to the desired reaction temperature under protective gas for from 4 to 48 h and to isolate the 13-(9-perylene-3,4-dicarboximide) quaterrylene-3,4-dicarboximide XI formed by distilling off the solvent and subsequently washing first with dilute inorganic acid, for example dilute hydrochloric acid, and then with water.<br>
The purity of the thus prepared 13-(9-perylene-3,4-dicarboximide)quaterrylene-3,4-dicarboximide XI is generally sufficient for the second cyclodehydrogenation step c2b). If appropriate, the crude product can be purified further by column chromatography on silica gel with methylene chloride as an eluent.<br>

The second cyclodehydrogenation step c2b) to the hexarylenetetracarboximide la is undertaken analogously to step g1) of process Al-hexarylene, preferably in an organic reaction medium which has hydroxyl and amino functions and comprises a substantially undissolved base (step c2ba)), but may also be carried out analogously to step g2) of process A1-hexarylene in the presence of a base-stable, high-boiling organic solvent and also of an alkali metal- or alkaline earth metal-containing base and of a nitrogen-containing auxiliary base (step c2bp)).<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately likewise as described for step g) of process A1-hexarylene.<br>
The further purification of the resulting hexarylenetetracarboximide la may be undertaken as in the one-stage procedure c1).<br><br>
The yield in step c2ba) is generally from 80 to 100%; the yield in step c2bp) is typically from 80 to 95%.<br>
With the aid of the inventive process B-hexarylene, it is possible to obtain both symmetrical and unsymmetrical hexarylenetetracarboximides la (different R radicals on the two imide nitrogen atoms and/or different R' radicals in the two outer perylene units).<br>
Process B-pentarvlene:<br>

However, it will be appreciated that the process variant c2bp) analogous to step g1) of process Al-hexarylene may also be selected here.<br>
In process technology terms, the procedure is appropriately likewise analogous.<br>
The resulting pentarylenetetracarboximide lb may be purified as described for the one-stage process variant c1).<br>
The yield in step c2ba) is generally from 80 to 100%; the yield in c2bp) is typically from 80 to 95%.-<br>
With the aid of the inventive process B-pentarylene, it is possible to obtain both symmetrical and unsymmetrical pentarylenetetracarboximides lb (different R radicals on the two imide nitrogen atoms and/or different R' radicals in the two outer perylene units).<br>
The inventive rylenetetracarboximides I exhibit strong absorption in the near infrared region at wavelengths of from 830 to 975 nm and thus complement the spectral region accessible with the aid of the rylene compounds known to date in an advantageous manner.<br>
They are suitable for a multitude of applications, such as the coloring of high molecular weight organic and inorganic materials, for example of coatings, printing inks and plastics, for producing aqueous polymer dispersions which absorb in the near infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum, for producing markings and inscriptions which absorb infrared light and are invisible to the human eye, as infrared absorbers for heat management, as IR laser beam-absorbing materials in fusion treatment of plastics parts, and also as active components in photovoltaics.<br>
