				<td>2-ACYLAMINOTHIAZOLE DERIVATIVE OR SALT THEREOF<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a novel 2-acylaminothiazole derivative or a salt thereof, which is useful as a medicament particularly in the treatment of thrombocytopenia, and pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A platelet is anuclear blood cell playing an important role in physiological hemostasis and pathological thrombosis, and is continuously produced from megakaryocytes in a living organism. The platelet originates from pluripotent stem cells like other blood cells. Specifically, the pluripotent stem cell becomes a megakaryocytic progenitor cell, from which megakaryoblasts, promegakaryocytes, and megakaryocytes are formed. During the maturation of a megakaryocyte, premature megakaryocytes only carry out DNA synthesis without involving cell division to become a polyploid. Thereafter, cytoplasm begins to mature to form a platelet separation membrane, and a platelet is released by cytoplasm fragmentation.<br>
In addition, since decrease in the number of platelets due to various hematopoietic dysfunctions in aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, or chemotherapy or radiotherapy for malignant tumors and the like causes<br>
serious symptoms such as hemorrhagic tendencies, there have been many attempts at developing various technologies for increasing the number of platelets for the purpose of treating such dysfunctions. At present, although platelet transfusion is a powerful means for treating thrombocytopenia, a sufficient amount of platelets cannot be provided, and it is difficult to sufficiently improve thrombocytepenia because of a short life span of transfused platelets and the like. Additionally, platelet transfusions involve problems including viral infection, production of alloantibodies, Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD), and the like. Thus, there is a demand for the development of a medicament for mitigating hematopoietic suppression caused by various conditions or therapies to thereby promote the recovery of platelet number.<br>
Meanwhile, it has been reported that thrombopoietin (hereinafter referred to as "TPO"), which is a c-Mpl ligand playing an important role in differentiation into megakaryocytes, has been cloned, and that it stimulates differentiation and proliferation of megakaryocytes to promote production of platelets (Kaushansky K. et al., Nature, 369, 568-571, 1994: Non-patent Document l). Clinical tests on TPO as an agent for increasing the number of platelets have been carried out, and its availability and admissibility in humans have been confirmed. However, because a neutralizing antibody was confirmed in a clinic test of PEG-rHuMGDF, a kind of TPO (163 N-terminal amino acids of native TPO modified with polyethyleneglycol) (Li J. et. al., Blood, 98, 3241-3248, 2001: Non-patent Document 2, and Basser R. L. et. al., Blood, 99, 2599-2602, 2002: Non-patent Document 3), there is a concern<br>
about immunogenicity of TPO. And, because TPO is a protein, it is decomposed in the digestive tract, and thus is not practical as an agent for oral administration. For the same reason, it is considered that a low molecular peptide is also not practical as an agent for oral administration. Under these circumstances, the development of a nonpeptide c-Mpl ligand, which has low immunogenicity and can be orally administrated, for the purpose of treatment of thrombocytepenia, is under progress.<br>
As such compounds, benzazepine derivatives are disclosed in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 11-152276 (Patent Document 1), acylhydrazone derivatives in WO 99/11262 (Patent Document 2), diazonaphthalene derivatives in WO 00/35446 (Patent Document 3), pyrrolocarbazole derivatives in WO 98/09967 (Patent Document 4), pyrrolophenanthridine derivatives in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 10-212289, and pyrrolophthalimide derivatives in Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2000-44562.<br>
And, it is described in WO 01/07423 (Patent Document 7) that a compound represented by the following general Formula (VII) has an activity of increasing the number of platelets-"<br><br>
(wherein symbols are as defined in the above publication).<br>
In addition, the above publication discloses a compound wherein X1 is an optionally substituted thiazole, and Y1 comprises -NHCO-. However, Ar1 or Ar2 of the compound of the present invention is not substituted with a<br>

(wherein symbols are as denned in the publication).<br>
The above publication describes a compound wherein X1 is an optionally substituted thiazole, and Y1 comprises -NHCO. However, Ar1 or Ar2 of the compound of the present invention is not substituted with a substituent group having a W1 group. And, the above publication does not disclose concretely in the Examples and the other parts a compound wherein the 5-position of thiazole is directly substituted with a nitrogen atom.<br>
In addition to the Patent Documents 7 and 8, it is described in Japanese Patent Publication No. 3199451 (Patent Document 9) that a 2-acylaminothiazole compound has the effects of a cholecystokinin and gastrin receptor agonist, and it is described in Chemical and Pharmaceutical Bulletin, 25, 9, 2292-2299, 1977 (Non-patent Document 4) that a 2-acylaminothiazole compound has anti-inflammatory effects. However, there is no description about activity for increasing the number of platelets.<br>
Under these circumstances, there is a demand for the development of a nonpeptide c-Mpl ligand that has low immunogenicity and can be orally<br>
administrated, for the purpose of treatment of thrombocytepenia. [Patent Document 1] Japanese Laid-Open Patent Publication No. Hei 11-<br>

Examples of the functional group include hydroxyl, carboxy, and amino groups, and examples of the protection group include those described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis ", third edition, edited by Greene and Wuts. It is preferable to suitably use them depending on reaction conditions. (First Production Method)<br>
(wherein R1, R2, Ar1 are as defined in the foregoing)<br>
In this method, a compound of the general Formula (I) or (V) is prepared by the amidation of a compound (id) or its salt with a compound (le) or its reactive derivative by a general method, and then, if necessary, removing a protection group.<br>
As the reactive derivatives of the compound (le), a common ester such as methylester, ethylester, tert-butyl ester, and the like; an acid halide such as acid chloride, acid bromide, and the like; an acid azide; an active ester with N-hydroxybenzotriazole, p-nitrophenol, or N-hydroxysuccinimide, or the like; a symmetrical acid anhydride; an acid anhydride mixture with alkyl carbonate, p-toluenesulfonic acid, or the like can be exemplified.<br>
In case the compound (le) is reacted in its free acid form, or active ester or acid halide without isolation, and the like, it is preferable to carry out the reaction using a condensing agent such as dicylcohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, diphenylphosphorylazide, diethylphosphorylcyanide, or 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (WSC HC1), and phosphorous oxychloride in pyridine solvent.<br>
The reaction is, although it varies depending on the reactive derivatives or condensing agent, carried out in an inert organic solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon including dichloromethane, dichloroethane, chloroform and the like; an aromatic hydrocarbon including benzene, toluene, xylene and the like." ether including ether, tetrahydrofuran (THF) and the like; an ester including ethyl acetate," N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and the like, under cooling, cooling to room<br>
temperature, or room temperature to heating.<br>

And, a salt consisting of a strong acid and weak base such as pyridine hydrochloride, pyridine p-toluenesulfonate, N.N-dimethylaniline hydrochloride and the like can be used. Pyridine can also be used as a solvent.<br>
Particularly, it is advantageous to carry out the reaction in a solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF using a base such as pyridine or N,N-dimethylaniline, or using pyridine as a solvent.<br>
The starting material (1d) used in the reaction can be prepared by synthesizing a compound (lb) by halogenation of the 5-position of a compound (1a) and then reacting the compound (1b) with a compound (1c). The compound (1b) can also be used in subsequent reaction without isolation.<br>
As a halogenation agent, those commonly used for a halogen substitution reaction of hydrogen on an aromatic ring can be used. A halogen atom such as chlorine, bromine and the like, dioxanedibromide, phenyltrimethylammonium tribromide, a pyridine such as pyridinium hydrobromide perbromide, pyrrolidonehydrotribromide and the like, a perbromide such as crpyrrolidone, quaternary ammonium, dioxane and the like are appropriate. An imide-type halogenation agent such as N-bromosuccinimide, N-chlorosuccinimide and the like, a hydrogen halide such<br>
as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid and the like, a metal agent such as copper (II) halide including copper bromide (II), copper chloride (II), and the like can also be used.<br>

If necessary, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a small amount of a catalyst such as hydrogen halide. It is preferable to carry out the reaction at -30 oC to reflux temperature of the used solvent.<br>
In case a hydrogen halide is used as a halogenation agent, the compound (la) can be reacted therewith in an acid solution or a base solution such as sodium hydroxide aqueous solution, and the reaction is preferably carried out at 30 oC to reflux temperature of the used solvent. And, in case a metal agent is used as a halogenation agent, the compound (la) is generally dissolved in an inert organic solvent such as halogenated hydrocarbon, ether, alcohol, aromatic hydrocarbon, acetic acid, ester, and the like, or water, or a mixture thereof to react with the agent, and if necessary, it is advantageous to carry out the reaction in the presence of a small amount of a catalyst such as hydrogen halide, under room temperature to heating.<br>
The thus-obtained compound (1b) is reacted with the compound (1c) in a non-protonic polar solvent such as DMF, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, DMSO and the like, an inert organic solvent such as halogenated hydrocarbon, ether,<br>
aromatic hydrocarbon, or water, or a mixture thereof to prepare a compound (1d). The reaction is preferably carried out at room temperature to reflux temperature of the used solvent.<br>
In order to progress the reaction smoothly, it is advantageous in some cases to employ an excess amount of the compound (1e) or carry out the reaction in the presence of a base such as N-methylmorpholine, trie thy lamine, diethylisopropylamine, N,N-dime thy laniline, pyridine, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)pyridine, picoline, lutidine and the like. (Second Production Method)<br>
In this method, a compound (2a) is synthesized by the amidation of the compound (1b) synthesized by the first production method with a compound (1e) or its reactive derivative, and then reacted with a compound (1c), and if necessary a protection group is removed to prepare the compound (I) or (V) of the present invention.<br>
Any step can be carried out in accordance with the steps of the first production method.<br>
And, the thus-obtained compounds can be subjected to a process commonly used in the art such as alkylation, acylation, substitution, oxidation, reduction, hydrolysis, and the like to prepare some of the compounds of the general Formula (I) or (V).<br>
The thus-produced compound of the present invention is isolated and purified as its free form or as a salt thereof. A salt of the compound (I) can be produced by subjecting it to a usual salt formation reaction. The isolation and purification are carried out by usual chemical manipulations such as extraction, concentration, evaporation, crystallization, filtration, recrystallization, various types of chromatography and the like.<br>
Various types of isomers can be separated by usual method using the difference in physicochemical properties among isomers. For example, a racemic mixture can be separated by a general racemic mixture resolution method, e.g., a method in which racemic mixture is converted into diastereomer salts with an optically active acid such as tartaric acid and the like and then subjected to optical resolution. And, diastereomers can be separated by fraction crystallization or various types of chromatography or the like. Also, optically active compounds can be prepared using appropriate optically active starting materials.<br>

Pharmaceutical efficacy of the compound of the present invention was confirmed by the following tests, (i) Human c-mpl-Ba/F3 cell proliferation test<br>
In a 96 well microplate, 2 x 105 cells/ml of human c-mpl-Ba/F3 cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 hours with 10% fetal bovine serum containing a RPMI1640 medium (100 ul /well) to which varied concentrations of tested compounds were respectively added. After the culturing, 10 µl /well of WST-1/1-methoxy PMS (cell counting kit, Dojindo) were added. Immediately after the adding and after 2 hours, absorbance of A450/A650 was measured with a microplate reader (Model 3350:Bio-Rad), and the absorbance increase after 2 hours was regarded as proliferation activity of each tested compound. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Each term in the Table has the following meaning.<br>
pot.: Concentration of tested compound for promoting cell proliferation of the compound of Example 9 (compound of Example 9 and rhTPO in rhTPO) to 30% of maximum cell proliferation activity value.<br>
Efficacy: Maximum cell proliferation activity value of tested compound when the maximum cell proliferation activity value of the compound of<br>
Example 9 (compound of Example 9 and rhTPO in rhTPO) is set to 100%.<br><br>
As Control 1, the compound A-l of the Patent Document 7 was employed; as the Control 2, the compound A-14 of the Patent Document 8 was employed; and as Control 3, the compound J-14 of the Patent Document 8 was employed. The structures of the control compounds are shown below.<br><br>
From the above results, it has been verified that the compound of the present invention has an activity of proliferating human c-Mpl Ba/F3 cells, (ii) Test for measuring effects of promoting the formation of megakaryocytic<br>
colonies<br>
Human CD34+ cells were cultured at 37 oC for 10-14 days in the presence of tested materials in a 2 well chamber slide, using MegaCult™-C (Stem Cell Technologies). In accordance with the attached instructions, dehydration, fixing, and staining with antihuman glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antibody were carried out. A group of 3 or more stained megakaryocytes was regarded as 1 colony, and the number of colonies per well was measured with a microscope.
