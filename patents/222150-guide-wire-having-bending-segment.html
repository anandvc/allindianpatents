GUIDE WIRE HAVING BENDING SEGMENT<br>
[0001] This patent application incorporates by reference US Patent Application 10/409,270<br>
"Guide Wire Structure for Insertion into an Internal Space" filed April 8, 2003, and US<br>
Patent Application 10/406,020 "Medical Device with Track and Method for Use" filed<br>
April 3, 2003<br>
[0002] Field of the Invention<br>
[0003] The present invention is related generally to a guide wire structure. In one embodiment,<br>
the invention is directed to a guide wire structure which can be inserted into an interior<br>
space within a human or animal body, such as the gastrointestinal (GI) tract of a human<br>
patient.<br>
[0004] Background of the Invention<br>
[0005] A physician typically accesses and visualizes tissue within a patient's gastrointestinal<br>
(GI) tract with a long, flexible endoscope. For the upper GI, a physician may insert a<br>
gastroscope into the sedated patient's mouth to examine and treat tissue in the esophagus,<br>
stomach, and proximal duodenum. For the lower GI, a physician may insert a<br>
colonoscope through the sedated patient's anus to examine the rectum and colon. Some<br>
endoscopes have a working channel, typically about 2.5-3.5mm in diameter, extending<br>
from a port in the handpiece to the distal top of the flexible shaft. A physician may insert<br>
medical instruments into the working channel to help diagnose or treat tissues within the<br>
patient. Physicians commonly take tissue biopsies from the mucosal lining of the GI tract<br>
using a flexible, biopsy forceps through the working channel of the endoscope.<br>
[0006] Insertion of a flexible endoscope, especially into the colon, can be very time-consuming<br>
and uncomfortable procedure for the patient, even when sedated with drugs. A physician<br>
often needs several minutes to push a flexible endoscope through the convoluted sigmoid,<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-2-<br>
descending, transverse, and ascending portions of the colon. The physician may diagnose<br>
and/or treat tissues within the colon either during insertion or removal of the endoscope.<br>
The flexible endoscope may "loop" within the colon, such as at the sigmoid colon or at<br>
the splenic flexure of the colon, so that it becomes difficult to further advance the<br>
endoscope along the colon. When a loop is formed, the force exerted to push the scope<br>
stretches the mesentery and causes pain for the patient. Depending on the anatomy of the<br>
patient and the skill of the physician in manipulating the flexible endoscope, some<br>
portions of the colon may be unexamined, thus increasing the risk of undiagnosed<br>
disease.<br>
[0007] Guide wires have been used to aid the introduction of catheters and other instruments into<br>
many sites in the human body. Many medical applications and specific designs of guide<br>
wires have been for cardiovascular use. There are, however, specific challenges relates to<br>
the use of guide wires in the GI tract, as opposed to the vascular system. Thus, the bowel<br>
is more tortuous, softer and generally of larger diameter. Furthermore, in the case of the<br>
small intestine and the colon, these are longer than most arteries or veins.<br>
[0008] Summary of the Invention<br>
[0009] In one embodiment, the present invention provides a guide wire structure for use with a<br>
medical device for insertion into a body lumen, such as the GI tract. The guide wire<br>
structure comprises a continuous, unitary wire comprising at least a first segment, a<br>
second segment, and a third segment disposed intermediate the first and second segments.<br>
The third segment has a bending moment of inertia less than a bending moment of inertia<br>
of the first segment and less than a bending moment of inertia of the second segment.<br>
The third segment can provide a flexible hinge for bending of the unitary wire. By the<br>
phrase "continuous, unitary wire" it is meant the portion of the wire associated with the<br>
third segment and adjacent portions of the first and second segments do not include any<br>
joints, junctures, or other connections (such as for instance welds, braze joints, or solder<br>
joints ), although the ends of the wire may include a joint or connection for connecting<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-3-<br>
the wire to a handle or for other purposes. In one embodiment the wire is formed of a<br>
single material, such as a superelastic material. One suitable material from which the<br>
wire may be formed is Nitinol.<br>
[0010] In one embodiment, the third segment has a cross-sectional area less than the cross<br>
sectional areas of the first segment and the second segment. The reduced cross-sectonal<br>
area of the third segment can be formed by grinding the outer diameter of the wire to<br>
form a reduced cross-sectional area third segment between first and second segments<br>
having a generally constant cross sectional area. The wire can have a circular cross-<br>
section, or alternatively, non-circular cross-sections. A generally conical transistion<br>
segment can extend from each end of the third segment to connect the third segment to<br>
the first and second segments.<br>

[0028] Detailed Description<br>
[0029] Figures 1-9 illustrate guide wire structures disclosed in US Patent Application<br>
10/409,270, incorporated herein by reference. Figures 10-13 illustrate a guide wire<br>
structure according to the present invention.<br>
[0030] The structure of Figure la comprises a first guide wire 1 and a second guide wire 2, the<br>
wires 1 and 2 being connected to one another by a junction 3 formed at the leading ends<br>
of the wires 1 and 2. Although the junction 3 is shown as being at the Leading ends, it<br>
could alternatively be adjacent the leading ends. The length of the junction need be no<br>
more than is necessary to hold the leading ends securely together side by side.<br>
Depending on the nature of the junction, a length of as little as 5-10 mm may be<br>
sufficient, though a greater length may sometimes be preferable.<br>
[0031] The guide wires 2 and 3 can be made of the materials conventionally used for guide<br>
wires, for example straight stainless steel wire, coiled stainless steel wire, glass fiber, a<br>
plastics material, or nitinol. Conveniently, a guide wire has a floppy tip, i.e. a leading<br>
end portion, typically 4-5 cm in length, of greater flexibility than the remainder of the<br>
guide wire, in order to reduce the risk of the leading end of the guide wire causing<br>
damage to the wall of the lumen through which it is passing. Where two such<br>
conventional guide wires are joined together to produce the guide wire structure of Figure<br>
1, it can be these floppy tips, or parts thereof, which are joined together. The length of<br>
the junction can be less than the length of the floppy tips, so that some length of floppy<br>
material remains which is unaffected by the junction.<br>
[0032] The whole or part of each of the guide wires may be coated to reduce its coefficient of<br>
friction, as is done with conventional guide wires. For example, guide wires can be<br>
coated with a low friction material such as silicone, or with a hydrophilic material which<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-6-<br>
becomes slippery in use in a patient, or with both a low friction material such as silicone<br>
and hydrophilic material applied over the low friction material.<br>
[0033] The junction 3 can be formed in any desired manner, provided the resulting leading end<br>
of the guide wire structure is not such as to damage the wall of the GI tract or other body<br>
lumen, nor cause undue pain when in contact therewith. For example, the junction can be<br>
made by gluing or welding the leading end portions together and then covering those<br>
portions with heat shrink tubing. Alternatively, the end portions could be held together<br>
by having a metal band crimped on to them, optionally enclosed by a cover made of a<br>
softer material.<br>
[0034] It is not essential for all the guide wires, or both the guide wires, as the case may be, to be<br>
of material which would normally be regarded as guide wire material. For example, in<br>
the case of a guide wire structure consisting of just two guide wires, one of the guide<br>
wires may be made of a thread, which is joined to the other guide wire by being tied to it.<br>
[0035] Another possibility would be to start with a single guide wire of twice the required length<br>
and fold it sharply back on itself, for example by crimping the folded wire adjacent the<br>
fold, so that it became, in effect, a pair of guide wires joined at the fold. A guide wire<br>
structure having an even number n of guide wires greater than two could be formed by<br>
folding half that number of guide wires.<br>
[0036] The principle of operation of the guide wire structure can be seen by comparing Figures<br>
1b and 1c with Figure 1a. Figure 1b shows the result of advancing the guide wire 1<br>
rightwardly, as indicated by the arrow, whilst holding the guide wire 2 still. As indicated<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-7-<br>
in Figure 1b, this causes the distal region of the guide wire structure to curve in a<br>
direction so that the advanced guide wire 1 is on the outside of the curve and the still<br>
guide wire 2 is on the inside of the curve. Continued advancement of guide wire 1<br>
beyond the position illustrated in Figure lb, whilst continuing to hold guide wire 2<br>
steady, results in the formation of a loop in an end region of guide wire 1. This is<br>
illustrated in Figure 1c, where the loop is denoted by reference numeral 4.<br>
[0037] To enable the physician to easily advance one of the guide wires while keeping the other<br>
still, the guide wires can be received, at their ends remote from the junction 3, in a handle<br>
which can be moved up and down the guide wires as they are advanced and retracted.<br>
The handle should allow precise regulation of the relative lengths of the two guide wires.<br>
It should also allow the introduction of the various catheters, imagers and other<br>
accessories, discussed in more detail below, giving accurate information on their<br>
relationship to the junction 3. The handle may be provided with a reversible motor drive<br>
which enables both guide wires to be driven. The motor drive itself may provide data to<br>
enable the user to monitor the lengths of the guide wires which have been fed forward.<br>
[0038] An example of a handle is illustrated in Figure 4. The illustrated handle 40 comprises a<br>
pistol grip 41 within which is mounted a pair of electric motors 42 (of which one is<br>
shown) powered either by a battery 43 or a mains supply 44. The motors are controlled<br>
by respective finger controls 45, one for each motor, each control having forward, reverse<br>
and stop positions. Each motor provides drive, via a respective gear, shown<br>
diagrammatically at 46, to a respective belt or chain drive 47, each of which propels a<br>
respective guide wire 48 forwardly (or backwardly). A switch 47a is provided to cause<br>
the driving belts or chains to move away from the wires, to allow the wires to be released,<br>
for example at the conclusion of a procedure. A lock mechanism 49 is provided to attacn<br>
the handle 40 to a catheter or to an accepting channel of an endoscope, through which the<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-8-<br>
guide wire is to be driven. The guide wires are stored in a coiled plastics tube 50, either<br>
with both wires side by side in a single tube or each in its own tube. This has the benefit<br>
of keeping the guide wires clean, and avoiding the risk of their trailing on to the floor.<br>
Under some conditions this storage facility may be omitted.<br>
[0039] The combined effect of the forms of behaviour illustrated in Figures 1b and 1c enables<br>
the guide wire structure to perform in a highly advantageous manner. Thus, causing the<br>
structure to become curved, as shown in Figure lb, enables the physician to steer the<br>
leading end of the structure round bends in the lumen through which the structure is<br>
being advanced. The ability to form a loop, as illustrated in Figure lc, enables the guide<br>
wire structure to adopt as configuration in which it can be safely advanced along the<br>
lumen, without undue discomfort for the patient.<br>
[0040] Furthermore, the presence of a loop at the leading end of the structure rather than the tip<br>
of a single wire, makes the structure more likely to follow the main course of the lumen,<br>
and less likely to inadvertently enter branches off it. Thus, in the case of the gut, there<br>
will be a much reduced tendency to enter, for example, diverticulae or the orifice of the<br>
appendix. However, the fact that the loop is not permanently present, and can be<br>
eliminated by putting the structure into the configuration shown in Figure la, means that<br>
the structure can easily, and without damage to itself, be passed along a very narrow<br>
passageway. It can therefore be passed, for example, along a channel of an endoscope or<br>
down a catheter, as is described further below. Also, when the guide wire structure is not<br>
in an endoscope or catheter, but is advancing directly along a patient lumen, it is not<br>
always desirable to do so with a loop at the front (for example if it has to pass through a<br>
small opening). Under such circumstances the guide wire structure is allowed to revert to<br>
the straight form shown in Figure la with both guidewires being advanced aligned and in<br>
unison.<br>
[0041] Figures 3a to 3c show diagrammatically, and by way of example, successive stages in<br>
advancing the guide wire structure along a colon 30. It is shown being introduced in<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-9.<br>
conjunction with a catheter 31 within which the whole guide wire structure is slidably<br>
received. The individual guide wires are denoted as W1 and W2. Advancement takes<br>
place by alternately:<br>
[0042] (a) pushing one wire forward while holding the other still; and<br>
[0043] (b) pushing the catheter forwards as far as the position shows in Figure 3c, or even<br>
somewhat further.<br>
[0044] It is desirable in endoscopic procedures to avoid, or at least reduce, the use of X-ray<br>
imaging to monitor what is taking place. With this in mind, the guide wires are<br>
preferably each provided with a pattern of markings, distributed along their length, to<br>
indicate how far each individual guide wire has been inserted. One such pattern in shown<br>
in Figure 2. As shown there, a pattern of markings in a given colour, and similar in<br>
nature to a bar code, is spaced along a first length (L1), and then repeated along<br>
successive lengths (of which only L2 is shown) each time in a different colour. Each of<br>
the lengths could conveniently be of the order of 10cm. This provides a method by<br>
which the physician can easily see which of the guide wires is the further advanced, and<br>
by how much, and enable him, for example, to make the inserted lengths equal and thus<br>
eliminate any curve (Figure 1b) or loop (Figure 1c). Of course, many other patterns of<br>
marking, for example numerals or letters, could be used instead of that illustrated, which<br>
is given only as an example.<br>
[0045] Additionally, or instead, the guide wire structure can be provided with other forms of<br>
position indication. It is known to provide a conventional guide wire with a series of<br>
miniature electrically conductive coils which surrounded the guide wire and are spaced<br>
along its length, the coils being connected to a source of electrical current, whereby each<br>
coil becomes a miniature electromagnet. Such coils can be provided on the guide wires<br>
used to form the guide wire structure shown. A sensing device outside the patient is used<br>
to detect the position of the coils within the patient, and thereby determine the location of<br>
the guide wires.<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
--10-<br>
[0046] The path of the guide wire structure can be influenced by the use of a catheter, which can<br>
be passed over one or both of the two guide wires, when there are precisely two, or over<br>
one, some, or all of the guide wires, when there are more than two. In one embodiment<br>
the catheter has a curved tip, which allows the application of torque to bias the forward<br>
motion of the guide wire (or wires) over which it passes in any given direction. The use<br>
of a catheter in this way is illustrated in Figures 5a and 5b. Figures 5a and 5b show a pair<br>
of guide wires 51 and 52 joined at a junction 53. Guide wire 51 is received within a<br>
catheter 54, referred to herein as a bias tube, the leading end portion of which is so<br>
formed as to have a curvature in it. The guide wire 51 with the bias tube, and the guide<br>
wire 52, are both received within an outer catheter 55. The ends of the catheters 51 and<br>
52 remote from their tips emerge from the catheter 55 to allow them to selectively<br>
advance and retract. The end of the bias tube 54 remote from the curved end thereof<br>
emerges from the outer catheter 55 at the user's end. As can be seen by comparing the<br>
state shown in Figure 5a with the subsequent state shown in Figure 5b, in advancing both<br>
the guide wires, but advancing guide wire 51 more than guide wire 52, the bias tube helps<br>
to ensure that the combined guide wire structure curves in the desired direction. If it<br>
were desired to cause the structure to advance in some other direction, this could be<br>
achieved by twisting the catheter 55 about its longitudinal axis, thus altering the positions<br>
of the guide wires relative to the lumen in which they are being advanced.<br>
[0047] The purpose of the guide wire is, as its name indicates, to act as a guide for some other<br>
element. Accordingly, when the guide wire structure is in place some other element is<br>
then passed over it, or otherwise pushed or advanced along the guide wire.<br>
[0048] As in the case of a catheter used to influence the path of a guide wire structure during<br>
passage of the guide wire structure along a lumen, a catheter introduced subsequently can<br>
pass over one or both of the guide wires, when there are precisely two, or over one, some,<br>
or all of the guide wires, when there are more than two. When the catheter is passed over<br>
both, or all, the guide wires, as the case may be, the leading end of the catheter will be<br>
free to pass beyond the leading end of the guide wire structure once it reaches that point.<br>
END 5344<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
If the catheter is not passed over both, or all, the guide wires, for example if it is passed<br>
over only one of two interconnected guide wires, the leading end of the catheter will<br>
normally be unable to pass beyond the connection between the guide wires. That may be<br>
desirable, for the purpose of ensuring that the leading end of the catheter can be brought<br>
to a position previously defined by the leading end of the guide wire structure. It also has<br>
the result, however, that if the guide wire structure is withdrawn, the catheter must be<br>
withdrawn with it.<br>
[0049] If it is desired to enable the leading end of the catheter to pass beyond the end of the<br>
guide wire over which it is traveling, or to enable the catheter to remain in position after<br>
the guide wire has been withdrawn, this can be achieved by providing the leading end of<br>
the catheter with a cutting device. The use of such a catheter is illustrated in Figures 6a<br>
and 6b. Figures 6a and 6b show guide wires 61 and 62 connected by a junction 63 and<br>
extending within an outer catheter 65. A cutting catheter 64 surrounds one of the guide<br>
wires, in this case the guide wire 61. The catheter 64 has a cutting tip (not visible in<br>
Figure 6a) which, when the catheter 64 is advanced over the guide wire 61, severs the<br>
junction 63. Figure 6b shows the severing operation partly completed.<br>
[0050] The cutting catheter comprises a cylindrical cutting member 66 with a circular cutting<br>
edge 67 (visible in Figure 6b but not in Figure 6a) formed at its leading end. When not in<br>
use the cutting edge is shielded by a generally cylindrical sheath 68 which is biased to a<br>
forward protecting position by a compression spring 69 located between the rearward end<br>
of the sheath 68 and a stop 70 fixed to the end of the catheter. When the cutting catheter<br>
is pushed forwards, against the force of the spring 69, as it is in Figure 6b, the cutting<br>
edge 67 emerges from the sheath 68 and severs the junction 63. As soon as severing is<br>
completed the spring automatically causes the sheath 68 to move forwards, covering the<br>
cutting edge 67 and preventing it from harming the patient.<br>
[0051] Once a sufficiently large guide wire loop has been formed in, say, the gut, it becomes<br>
possible to pull the gut backwards to some extent, using the friction between the loop and<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-12-<br>
the wall of the gut. To do this, both guide wires are pulled backwards in synchronism.<br>
This provides a means for straightening the gut, and this in turn makes it easier to<br>
advance the guide wire structure further or, indeed, to advance other structures (e.g.<br>
endoscopes), and reduces the pain of the procedure, which is mainly caused by stretching<br>
nerve endings in the mesentery.<br>
[0052] The above described concept of using a guide wire loop to straighten a passageway, e.g.<br>
the gut, can employ two guide wire structures operating in parallel. An example of such<br>
an embodiment is shown in Figure 7. This comprises two parallel catheters 72a and 72b,<br>
which are preferably connected together side by side in such a way as to allow each to<br>
move longitudinally with respect to the other. In the illustrated embodiment the<br>
connection is provided by a T-shaped stud 73 formed on catheter 72a which is slidable in<br>
a correspondingly shaped passageway 74 formed in catheter 72b and running<br>
longitudinally along it. A single stud may be provided, or a plurality of studs spaced<br>
along the length of catheter 72a, or there may be a continuous stud running along all or<br>
part of the length of catheter 72a. Catheter 72a receives a first guide wire structure 75a,<br>
comprising a pair of wires w1 and W2 joined at a junction 76a. Catheter 72b receives a<br>
guide wire structure 75b, comprising a pair of wires W3 and W4 joined at a junction 76b.<br>
[0053] The embodiment shown in Figure 7 can be used in a procedure which employs the<br>
following steps:<br>
[0054] 1. Push the combination of catheters 72a and 72b into an appropriate orifice, e.g. the<br>
anus in the case of the colon, as far as they will go.<br>
[0055] 2. Advance wire W3 as far as the loop which it forms is able to travel (this is<br>
substantially the configuration shown in Figure 7).<br>
[0056] 3. Pull back on both catheters so that the loop in guide wire structure 75b straightens<br>
the gut.<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-13-<br>
[0057] 4. Advance guide wire structure 75a in its unlooped form, i.e. wires w1 and w2,<br>
through the catheter 72a as far as it will go (which should be past the loop in guide wire<br>
structure 75b).<br>
[0058] 5. Advance catheter 72a over w1 and w2 so that it is ahead of catheter 72b, while<br>
catheter 72a, and the loop extending from the catheter, hold the gut in position.<br>
[0059] 6. Advance guide wire w1 or guide wire W2 so that a loop is formed in guide wire<br>
structure 75a and advances in the gut.<br>
[0060] 7. Withdraw whichever of wires W3 and W4 is the more forward of the two, so as to<br>
eliminate the loop in guide wire structure 75b.<br>
[0061] 8. Advance catheter 72b so that it catches up with catheter 72a.<br>
[0062] The above cycle is then repeated until the desired degree of advancement has been<br>
achieved,<br>
[0063] A similar cycle of steps can be achieved by a modified form of the embodiment of Figure<br>
7, in which one or each of the two catheters 72a and 72b is replaced by a suction catheter.<br>
A suction catheter can be used to effect the above described straightening of the gut by<br>
pulling back on it while suction is being applied. The suction is only applied during the<br>
straightening step. Yet another modification is to replace one of the guide wire structures<br>
by a soft balloon, which can be inflated to engage the gut wall, and then pulled back to<br>
straighten the gut<br>
[0064] Many different devices can be passed over the guide wire structure, and some examples<br>
will now be given.<br>
[0065] (a) A small imager (for example a CCD or CMOS chip) on a catheter could be passed<br>
along the guide wire or guide wires to the tip. This could optionally be propelled along<br>
the guide wire by a water jet or some other means of tip propulsion to reduce the force<br>
that has to be exerted outside the patient A source of white or coloured light could be<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-14-<br>
also introduced by the same means. This source could be in the form of light emitting<br>
diodes or could use fibre-optics. One of the wires could be optionally formed out of a<br>
fiberoptic bundle. It would be easier to take the optical signal through a light-weight<br>
insulated wire which could be incorporated into the guide wire or via a separate wire in a<br>
catheter. The imager could then convert the optical information to radiowaves or<br>
microwaves, to send the information to an aerial attached to, or adjacent to, the exterior<br>
of the patient.<br>
[0066] (b) A separate soft catheter could be run over the guide wire to the tip and this could<br>
be used to introduce air from a controlled pump to inflate the viscus. Water for rinsing<br>
purposes could be passed through this catheter or through some other from a water pump.<br>
[0067] (c) A catheter could be passed over one of the guide wires, which would provide a<br>
channel through which biopsies could be performed. This is preferably done after the<br>
imager referred to in (a) above has been placed in position, so that the imager can be used<br>
to view the biopsy procedure. This catheter might have tip angulation properties.<br>
[0068] (d) A double lumen catheter could be passed over the double wire, which might allow<br>
the introduction of another wire of greater stiffness or with a curled tip to allow the<br>
movement of the device in a desired direction.<br>
[0069] Once the guide wire, and the imager referred to in (a) above, have reached the desired<br>
location, an overtube could be passed, for example to the cecum. The guide wire and the<br>
imager could then be withdrawn and a conventional endoscope could be passed through<br>
the overtube to deliver therapy, for example removing a polyp or cancer.<br>
[0070] A conventional endoscope could be introduced into a body lumen by passing it over the<br>
guide wire structure. However, a conventional endoscope may be too stiff for this to be<br>
possible, and the guide wire structure offers the possibility of, in effect, constructing an<br>
endoscope within a patient. To achieve this, a number of catheters, each providing one or<br>
more of the utilities normally provided a conventional endoscope, are successively passed<br>
over one or more of the guide wires, so that result is an assemblage of these various<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-15-<br>
elements within the patient. A particular advantage of proceeding in this way is that the<br>
force required to advance each of the individual catheters is substantially less than that<br>
required to advance a complete conventional endoscope (e.g. a colonoscope or an<br>
enteroscope), since the latter is much suffer and has much greater mass. It is therefore<br>
easier for the physician, and less uncomfortable for the patient, and is less likely to cause<br>
injury to the patient. Also, since the endoscope is then assembled element by element,<br>
the endoscope can have those facilities which are required for the particular patient, and,<br>
only those facilities, so that the endoscope is tailored to the requirements of the medical<br>
procedure being carried out. It will be understood that, for the purpose of allowing in<br>
situ assembly of a catheter, the guide wire structure should preferably comprise more<br>
than two guide wires, for example three or four guide wires.<br>
[0071] Although a structure having more than two guide wires is particularly useful for the<br>
purpose discussed above of assembling an endoscope in situ, it may also have value in<br>
relation to the procedure for introducing the guide wire structure into a lumen. This is<br>
because the two-guide wire structure shown in Figures la to 1c allows curvature in only<br>
one plane, so that steering the structure in three dimensions requires the user to twist the<br>
structure about its longitudinal axis, for example by using a catheter to which the<br>
necessary torque can be applied. However, if more than two guide wires are provided it<br>
is possible to curve the structure in any plane; three guide wires are sufficient for this<br>
purpose.<br>
[0072] Attention is now directed to Figures 8a to 8c, which illustrate the use of a guide wire<br>
structure 80 which comprises two guide wires 81 and 82 connected by a junction portion<br>
83.	As can be seen, the junction portion 83 is pivotal about an axis located at the<br>
proximal end of the portion 83, so that, as shown in Figure 8a, it can pivot to such an<br>
extent that it lies flat along the distal end portion of guide wire 81. This is advantageous<br>
in that it makes possible, or makes easier, movement of the portion 83 within a catheter<br>
84,	not only where there is no loop present (as in Figure 8c) but also when there is (as<br>
shown in Figure 8a). In this connection it is to be understood that the diameter of the<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-16-<br>
catheter 84 would actually be substantially greater than that shown in these Figures. It is<br>
also to be understood that instead of being joined by a junction portion 83 of significant<br>
length, as illustrated, the guide wires could alternatively be joined by a junction of<br>
substantially no length, i.e. the ends of the guide wires could be connected by a junction<br>
consisting, at least in substance of just a pivot point.<br>
[0073] Figure 9 shows yet another guide wire structure in which a similar pivoting action can be<br>
achieved. This comprises guide wires 91 and 92, having respective floppy tip portions<br>
91a and 92a connected to one another by a thread or highly flexible wire 93. This thread<br>
or wire can be inserted into the portions 91a and 92a, or attached to their surfaces.<br>
[0074] Figures 10-13 illustrate a guide wire structure according to the present invention. The<br>
guide wire structure includes a continuous, unitary wire having a segment (which can be<br>
positioned generally in the middle portion of the wire), which segment has a bending<br>
moment of inertia which is lower than the bending moment of inertia of the adjacent wire<br>
segments. For instance, the wire can change in cross sectional shape or dimension at a<br>
location that is not a terminal end, so as to provide a bending hinge.<br>
[0075] The bending moment of inertia for a circular cross-section can be calculated as ƒà r4/4,<br>
where r is the radius of the cross-section. The bending moment of inertia for a<br>
rectangular cross-section can be calculated as bh3/12, where b is the base of the rectangle<br>
and h is the height. "Mechanics of Materials", A.C. Ugural, 1991, McGraw Hill is<br>
incorporated herein by reference for its disclosure related to bending of cross-sections.<br>
[0076] Figure 10 shows an embodiment of guide wire structure of the present invention<br>
comprising a continuous, unitary wire 100 that has varying cross sectional area along a<br>
portion of its length. In this embodiment, the wire 100 can have a first segment 121<br>
having a generally circular cross section of nominal diameter D101 and a length L101, a<br>
second segment 122 having a generally circular cross-section of nominal diameter D102<br>
and a length L102, and a third segment 123 having a generally circular cross-section of<br>
nominal diameter D103 and length L103. The wire 100 can also include a tapered<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-17-<br>
transition segment 110 having a conical shape and a length L104 and extending between<br>
segment 121 and segment 123, and a tapered transition segment 112 having a length<br>
L105 and extending between segment 123 and segment 122.<br>
[0077] The reduced diameter D103 of the third segment 123 relative to the diameter D101 and<br>
the diameter D102 provides the third segment 123 with a bending moment of inertia<br>
which is lower than that of the segments 121 and 122. Accordingly, the wire 100 can<br>
bend at the third segment 123 to provide a hinge, which hinge can encompass the length<br>
L103 of third segment 123, as well as some or all of the lengths L104 and L105 of<br>
segments 110 and 112. In one embodiment, the hinge so formed can be an elastic hinge.<br>
[0078] The wire 100 with it's associated hinge can be used in the embodiment as described<br>
below, as well as in those methods disclosed with reference to Figures 1-9 above, without<br>
the need for attaching or otherwise joining two wires or using different materials.<br>
[0079] In one embodiment, the diameters D101 and D102 can be between about 0.010 inch to<br>
about 0.035 inch, and more particularly about 0.016 inch to about 0.020 inch. The third<br>
segment 123 can have a diameter D103 of between 0.005 inch and about 0.010 inch, and<br>
in one embodiment D103 can be about 0.007 inch.<br>
[0080] Each of L101 and L102 can be at least about 3 feet, and can be between about 6 feet and<br>
about 12 feet. The combined length lengths L101, L102, L103, L104, and L105 can be<br>
between about 7 feet and about 25 feet. In one embodiment, the lengths L101 and L102<br>
can be about equal, and their combined length can be at least about 20 feet. Length L103<br>
of the third segment can be between about 0.100 inch to about 0.500 inch, and in one<br>
embodiment can be about 0.300 inch. The length L104 and Length 105 can be about<br>
equal, and can each be about 2 inches. Modification of the cross section of the wire 100<br>
at a location intermediate the ends may be accomplished by any suitable process, such as<br>
by grinding, drawing, or stamping wire 100.<br>
[0081] In one embodiment, the reduced cross-section of the third segment 123 can be formed by<br>
centerless grinding. A reduced cross-section can be formed using a grinding machine<br><br>

such as a TF-9CPG System 2000 Guide Wire Profile Grinder available from Glebar<br>
Company of Franklin Lakes, NJ.<br>
[0082] The wire 100 can be enclosed in one or more low friction and/or lubricous sleeves. In<br>
Figure 11, the first wire segment 121 is enclosed in a sleeve 155, second wire segment<br>
122 is enclosed in a sleeve 159, and the third segment and the transition segments are<br>
enclosed in a sleeve 157. The sleeves 155,157, and 159 can be formed of a low friction<br>
material, such as PTFE or polyester. Indicators can be associated with the first and<br>
second wire segments 121 and 122 so that the wire segments can be distinguished when<br>
viewed through a camera or other optical device associated with an endoscope or other<br>
medical device. For instance, the indicators can be,visual, and can employ different<br>
colors. In one embodiment, the sleeves 155 and 159 can be provided in different colors<br>
and/or with different patterns of markings. In Figure 13, sleeve 155 has a pattern of<br>
heavy, diagonally slanted marks, while sleeve 159 has a pattern of lighter, non-slanted<br>
markings. The marking colors and/or the background color of the sleeves can be<br>
different to distinguish sleeve 155 from sleeve 159. Alternating stripes of different colors<br>
can also be used to distinguish sleeve 155 from sleeve 159, and thus segment 121 from<br>
122 as viewed through a visualization device. Sleeve 157 can have yet another color or<br>
pattern of colors to provide a visual indication of the location of the third segment 123.<br>
[0083] Figure 11 illustrates the wire 100 bent at the third segment 123 to form a narrow wire<br>
loop for introduction into a body cavity. In Figure 11, the wire 100 is illustrated with a<br>
generally U-shaped bend 150 witharadius R110 so that the wire does not kink upon<br>
placement through a colonoscope working channel, does not form a sharp point that can<br>
damage tissue upon placement in a body lumen, and preferably does not substantially<br>
plastically deform. In one embodiment, the radius R110 can be about 0.75mm to about<br>
1.5mm, and more particularly about 1mn.<br>
[0084] Suitable biocompatible materials from which such a wire can be constructed include<br>
those mentioned from which the wires of Figures 1-9 can be formed, including without<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
-19-<br>
limitation a superelastic material such as nitinol. Other materials, such as steel and alloys<br>
can also be used. One suitable material from which wire 100 can be formed is Nitinol<br>
NDC SE508 available from Nitinol Devices and Components, a Johnson &amp; Johnson<br>
Company of Fremont, CA.<br>
[0085] Figure 12 illustrates alternative embodiments in which the cross-section of the narrowed<br>
length 103 is not round. Different cross sectional shapes may be formed, such as<br>
changing a round wire to a flat rectangular cross section in Figure 12a, an oval cross<br>
section in Figure 12b, or a square cross section in Figure 12c. Other cross-sectional<br>
shapes, such as triangular, hexangonal, or other polygonal shapes may be employed.<br>
Preferential bending planes of certain cross sectional shapes can be used for the purposes<br>
of directing the U-loop of the wire. For instance, a rectangular, oval, or triangular cross-<br>
section can be employed to direct bending about a particular axis.<br>
[0086] The guide wire structure with wire 100 of the present invention can be used in place of<br>
the wire configurations shown in Figures 1-9, as well as with the device illustrated in US<br>
Patent Application 10/406,020 filed April 3, 2003, which application is incorporated by<br>
reference herein. Figure 13 is a schematic illustration of the guide wire structure with<br>
wire 100 in use with a medical device 300. Generally, medical device 300 can be a<br>
flexible endoscope, such as a flexible colonosocope, or a device such as is shown in the<br>
above referenced patent application.<br>
[0087] Medical device 300 can include a handle 310, which is positioned outside a patient, an<br>
elongate flexible body portion 330, and a distal end 320 which can be positioned in a<br>
patient, such as in a patient's GI tract, with distal end 320 sized and shaped to be<br>
advanced in the GI tract. The medical device can also include a working channel 350<br>
extending through the body portion 330 and opening at the distal end 320 of the device<br>
300, a camera 360, light source 370, a camera lens wash nozzle/irrigation nozzle 380, a<br>
light source 392, and a light source 394. Suction can be provided through working<br>
channel 350, if desired.<br><br>
WO 2004/089455	PCT/US2004/009966<br>
- 20 -<br>
[0088] The guide wire with wire 100 of the present invention can be positioned within the<br>
working channel 350 such that the U shaped bend in third segment 123 is positioned in<br>
the patient's body, and the ends of the guide wire extend through an access opening of<br>
the handle 310. In figure 13, the ends of the guide wire are indicated by numeral 221<br>
(associated with first segment 121) and numeral 222 (associated with second segment<br>
122).<br>
[0089] The guide wire with wire 100 can be used generally as shown in Figures 3A-3C to<br>
advance a device into a body lumen, such as the GI tract. In Figure 13, after the U<br>
shaped bend in the third segment 123 has been advanced through the working channel<br>
350, the first segment 121 is advanced through the working channel relative to second<br>
segment 122, so that the first segment 121 takes on a curvature having a radius of<br>
curvature greater than Radius of curvature R110, as shown in Figure 13. To advance the<br>
distal end 320 further into the patient, the operator can pull proximally on end 222 to<br>
move third segment 123 back into the working channel 350, thereby leaving the relatively<br>
large radius of curvature loop in first segment 121 in the body lumen and extending from<br>
the distal end of the device 300. End 222 can then be held fixed, and end 221 can be<br>
advanced distally toward handle 310 so that additional length of the first segment 121 is<br>
advanced distally out of working channel 350, thereby advancing the relatively large<br>
radius of curvature loop distally in the GI tract. Then, while holding end 222 stationary<br>
with respect to handle 310, end 221 can be pulled in tension (proximally) while<br>
simultaneously pushing (distally) the elongate body portion 330 distally along wire<br>
segments 121 and 122 in working channel 350, so that the distal end 350 moves forward<br>
(distally) into the GI tract. Accordingly, the wire segments 121 and 122 serve as a track<br>
upon which the distal end 350 of device 300 can be advanced.<br>
