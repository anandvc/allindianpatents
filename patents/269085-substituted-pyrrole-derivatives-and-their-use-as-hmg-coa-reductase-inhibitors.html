				<td>Field of the Invention The present invention relates to substituted pyrrole derivatives, which can be used as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors.<br>
Compounds disclosed herein can function as cholesterol lowering agents and can be used for the treatment of cholesterol-related diseases and related symptoms. Processes for the preparation of disclosed compounds are provided, as well as pharmaceutical compositions containing the disclosed compounds, and methods of treating cholesterol-related diseases and related symptoms.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Cardiovascular disease and its associated maladies, dysfunctions and complications are a principal cause of disability and the chief cause of death. One specific factor significantly contributing to this pathophysiologic process is atherosclerosis, which has been generally recognized as the leading health care problem both with respect to mortality and health care costs.<br>
Atherosclerosis is characterized by the deposition of fatty substances, primarily cholesterol, resulting in plaque formation on the inner surface of the arterial wall and degenerative change to the arteries.<br>
It is now well established that cardiovascular disorders including myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, hypertension and hypotension, cerebrovascular disorders including stroke, cerebral thrombosis and memory loss due to stroke; peripheral vascular disease and intestinal infarction are caused by blockage of arteries and arterioles by atherosclerotic plaque. Atherosclerotic plaque formation is multi-factorial in its production. Hypercholesterolemia, especially elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), is an important risk factor for atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis and associated diseases.<br>
The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been used in reducing blood levels of LDL cholesterol. Cholesterol is produced via the mevalonic acid pathway. Reducing the formation of mevalonic acid, a precursor to cholesterol, leads to a corresponding decrease in hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis with a reduction in the cellular pool of cholesterol.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 4,681,893 assigned to Warner-Lambert, discloses certain trans-6-[2-(3-,or 4-carbaoxamido-substituted pyrrole-l-yl)alkyI]-4-hydroxypyran-2-ones and the corresponding ring-opened hydroxy acids derived therefrom, including trans(±)-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-( 1 -methylethyl)-N,4-diphenyl-1 - [2-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2H-pyran-2-<br>
yl)ethyl]-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxamide, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-<br>
coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA), an important coenzyme catalyzing the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol.<br>
U. S. Patent No, 5,273,995 assigned to Warner Lambert, relates to the optically pure (R, R) form of the ring-opened acid of trans-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-(l-methylethyl-N,4-diphenyl-l-[2-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-6-oxo-2H-pyran-2-yl)ethyl]-lH-pyrrole-3-carboxamide that is [R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-P,8-dihydroxy-5-(l-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-1-heptanoic acid, pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, specifically its calcium salt (Atorvastatin, Lipitor®), which is currently being used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.<br>
U. S. Patent No. 5,385,929 discloses certain phenyl hydroxy derivatives of the compounds disclosed in U. S. 5,273,995, and that such phenyl hydroxy derivatives are also active as the inhibitors of the biosynthesis of cholesterol.<br>

SCHEME I<br>
The compound of Formula XII can be prepared according to Scheme I. Accordingly, a compound of Formula II is reacted with a compound of Formula III, wherein R3, R5 and R^ are<br>
as defined earlier, to give a compound of Formula IV which on reaction with a compound of Formula V (wherein R2 is as defined earlier) gives a compound of Formula VI, which on treatment with a compound of Formula VII (wherein R1is as defined earlier) yields a compound of Formula VIII, which on further reaction with a compound of Formula IX gives a compound of Formula X, which on hydrolysis gives a compound of Formula XI, which can then be further converted to hemicalcium salt.<br>

Pharmacological activity<br>
The compounds disclosed herein have activity as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutanyl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and thus are useful in inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis and/or in lowering triglycerides.<br>
The compounds described herein are screened in an in-vitro HMG-CoA reductase enzyme assay as described by Kubo et al., Endocrinology 120:214 (1987) and Hellar et al., Biochem and Biophys. Res. Comm. 50:859(1973).<br>
HMG-CoA reductase is a rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis, catalyzing the following reaction.<br>
[14C] HMG-CoA + 2NADPH +2H+ —► [14C] mevanolate + CoA +2NADP+ microsomes, utilizing 2.5 uM [14C] HMG-CoA as a substrate. The reaction is carried out in presence of 100 mM KH2P04, 20 raM G-6-P, 2.5 mM NADP, 10 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT and 1.4 G-6-P dehydrogenase, at 37 °C for 15 minutes and quantitating [14C] mevalonate as an end product. For IC50 determination, the compounds dissolved in 1% dimethylsulfoxide are preincubated with liver microsomes at 37°C for 30 minutes.<br>
The IC50 for HMG-CoA reductase inhibition in rat liver microsome ranged from 0.1 to 0.96 nM. The compounds disclosed herein ranged from being equipotent to 4 fold more potent than atorvastatin. Some of the compounds disclosed herein were potent than atorvastatin in inhibiting cholesterol synthesis in vivo rat model. Some of the compounds disclosed herein have intrinsic clearance in human liver microsome significantly less than atorvastatin and are not major substrate for CYP3A4 (cytochrome p450 3A4). Some of the compounds exhibit potency and selectivity greater than atorvastatin in inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in rat primary hepatocytes over inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in extra hepatic cells/cell lines [e.g. NRK-49F (Fibroblast) and L6 (Myoblast)].<br>
