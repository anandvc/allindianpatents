				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
 This invention pertains generally to control systems for electro-<br>
mechanical transmissions, and more specifically to monitoring operation of a<br>
hydraulic circuit thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Fuel/electric hybrid powertrain architectures comprise torque-<br>
generative devices, including internal combustion engines and electric<br>
machines, which transmit torque through a transmission device to a vehicle<br>
driveline. One such transmission includes a two-mode, compound-split,<br>
electro-mechanical transmission which utilizes an input member for receiving<br>
motive torque from an internal combustion engine, and an output member for<br>
delivering motive torque from the transmission to the vehicle driveline.<br>
Exemplary electro-mechanical transmissions are selectively operative in fixed<br>
gear modes and continuously variable modes through actuation of torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A fixed gear mode occurs when rotational speed of the<br>
transmission output member is a fixed ratio of rotational speed of the input<br>
member from the engine, typically due to actuation of one or more torque-<br>
transfer clutches. A continuously variable mode occurs when rotational speed<br>
of the transmission output member is variable based upon operating speeds of<br>
one or more electrical machines. The electrical machines can be connected to<br>
the output shaft via actuation of a clutch, or by direct connection. Clutch<br>
actuation and deactivation is typically effected through a hydraulic circuit,<br>
including electrically-actuated hydraulic flow management valves, pressure<br>
control solenoids, and pressure monitoring devices controlled by a control<br>
module.<br><br>
 Engineers implementing powertrain systems having electro-hydraulic<br>
transmissions are tasked with schemes to identify a fault in the hydraulic<br>
circuit, such as during execution of a shift.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
 There is provided a method and an apparatus to identify a fault in an<br>
electro-hydraulic circuit for a transmission device of an exemplary powertrain.<br>
The transmission comprises an electro-mechanical device operative to transmit<br>
torque input from a plurality of torque-generative devices. An electro-<br>
hydraulic control circuit comprising a plurality of controllable flow control<br>
devices is operative to selectively actuate a plurality of torque-transfer devices<br>
to effect operation in one of a plurality of operating modes comprising fixed<br>
gear ratio modes and two continuously variable modes. The method<br>
comprises controlling the flow control devices, and monitoring a plurality of<br>
pressure monitoring devices in the electro-hydraulic control circuit. A fault is<br>
identified in the electro-hydraulic control circuit when a monitored signal<br>
output from one of the pressure monitoring devices does not correspond to an<br>
expected signal output for the pressure monitoring device after an elapsed time<br>
period.<br>
 The invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon<br>
reading and understanding the following detailed description of the<br>
embodiments.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br><br>
 The invention may take physical form in certain parts and<br>
arrangement of parts, the preferred embodiment of which will be described in<br>
detail and illustrated in the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof,<br>
and wherein:<br><br>
 Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary powertrain, in<br>
accordance with the present invention;<br>
 Fig. 2 is a schematic diagram of an exemplary architecture for a<br>
control system and powertrain, in accordance with the present invention; and,<br>
 Fig. 3 is a schematic diagram of a hydraulic circuit, in accordance<br>
with the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Referring now to the drawings, wherein the showings are for the<br>
purpose of illustrating the invention only and not for the purpose of limiting<br>
the same, Figs. 1 and 2 depict a system comprising an engine 14, transmission<br>
10, control system, and driveline which has been constructed in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 Mechanical aspects of exemplary transmission 10 are disclosed in<br>
detail in commonly assigned U.S. Patent No. 6,953,409, entitled "Two-Mode,<br>
Compound-Split, Hybrid Electro-Mechanical Transmission having Four Fixed<br>
Ratios", which is incorporated herein by reference. The exemplary two-mode,<br>
compound-split, electro-mechanical hybrid transmission embodying the<br>
concepts of the present invention is depicted in Fig. 1, and is designated<br>
generally by the numeral 10. The transmission 10 has an input shaft 12 that is<br>
preferably directly driven by an internal combustion engine 14. The<br>
transmission 10 utilizes three planetary-gear sets 24, 26 and 28, and four<br>
torque-transmitting devices, i.e. clutches C1 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75. An<br>
electro-hydraulic control system 42, preferably controlled by transmission<br>
control module 17, is operative to control actuation and deactivation of the<br>
clutches. Clutches C2 and C4 preferably comprise hydraulically-actuated<br>
rotating friction clutches. Clutches C1 and C3 preferably comprise<br>
comprising hydraulically-actuated stationary devices grounded to the<br>
transmission case 68.<br><br>
 The three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 each comprise simple<br>
planetary gear sets. Furthermore, the first and second planetary gear sets 24<br>
and 26 are compounded in that the inner gear member of the first planetary<br>
gear set 24 is conjoined to an outer gear member of the second planetary gear<br>
set 26, and connected to a first electrical machine comprising a<br>
motor/generator 56, also referred to as "MG-A".<br>
 The planetary gear sets 24 and 26 are further compounded in that<br>
carrier 36 of the first planetary gear set 24 is conjoined through a shaft 60, to<br>
the carrier 44 of the second planetary gear set 26. As such, carriers 36 and 44<br>
of the first and second planetary gear sets 24 and 26, respectively, are<br>
conjoined. The shaft 60 is also selectively connected to the carrier 52 of the<br>
third planetary gear set 28, through clutch C2 62. The carrier 52 of the third<br>
planetary gear set 28 is connected directly to the transmission output member<br>
64. An inner gear member of the second planetary gear set 26 is connected to<br>
an inner gear member of the third planetary gear set 28 through a sleeve shaft<br>
66 that circumscribes shaft 60, and is connected to a second electrical machine<br>
comprising a motor/generator 72, referred to as MG-B.<br>
 All the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 as well as MG-A and MG-B<br>
56 and 72 are preferably coaxially oriented, as about the axially disposed shaft<br>
60. MG-A and MG-B 56 and 72 are both of an annular configuration which<br>
permits them to circumscribe the three planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 such<br>
that the planetary gear sets 24, 26 and 28 are disposed radially inwardly of the<br>
MG-A and MG-B 56 and 72. Transmission output member 64 is operably<br>
connected to a vehicle driveline 90 to provide motive torque. Each clutch is<br>
preferably hydraulically actuated, receiving pressurized hydraulic fluid from a<br>
pump, described below, via an electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 described<br>
hereinbelow with reference to Fig. 3.<br><br>
 The transmission 10 receives input motive torque from the torque-<br>
generative devices, including the engine 14 and the MG-A 56 and MG-B 72,<br>
as a result of energy conversion from fuel or electrical potential stored in an<br>
electrical energy storage device (ESD) 74. The ESD 74 typically comprises<br>
one or more electrochemical energy storage batteries. Other electrical energy<br>
and electrochemical energy storage devices that have the ability to store<br>
electric power and dispense electric power may be used in place of the<br>
batteries without altering the concepts of the present invention. The ESD 74<br>
is preferably sized based upon factors including regenerative requirements,<br>
application issues related to typical road grade and temperature, and<br>
propulsion requirements such as emissions, power assist and electric range.<br>
The ESD 74 is high voltage DC-coupled to transmission power inverter<br>
module (TPIM) 19 via DC transfer conductors 27. The TPIM 19 is an<br>
element of the control system described hereinafter with regard to Fig. 2.<br>
The TPIM 19 transmits electrical energy to and from MG-A 56 by transfer<br>
conductors 29, and the TPIM 19 similarly transmits electrical energy to and<br>
from MG-B 72 by transfer conductors 31. Electrical current is transmitted<br>
to and from the ESD 74 in accordance with whether the ESD 74 is being<br>
charged or discharged. TPIM 19 includes the pair of power inverters and<br>
respective motor control modules configured to receive motor control<br>
commands and control inverter states therefrom for providing motor drive or<br>
regeneration functionality.<br>
 In motoring control, the respective inverter receives current from<br>
the DC transmission lines and provides AC current to the respective<br>
electrical machine, i.e. MG-A and MG-B, over transfer conductors 29 and<br>
31. In regeneration control, the respective inverter receives AC current from<br>
the electrical machine over transfer conductors 29 and 31 and transmits<br>
current to the DC lines 27. The net DC current provided to or from the<br>
inverters determines the charge or discharge operating mode of the electrical<br><br>
energy storage device 74. Preferably, MG-A 56 and MG-B 72 are three-<br>
phase AC machines each having a rotor operable to rotate within a stator that<br>
is mounted on a case of the transmission. The inverters comprise known<br>
complementary three-phase power electronics devices.<br>
 Fig- 2, a schematic block diagram of the control<br>
system, comprising a distributed control module architecture, is depicted. The<br>
elements described hereinafter comprise a subset of an overall vehicle control<br>
architecture, and are operable to provide coordinated system control of the<br>
powertrain system described herein. The control system is operable to<br>
synthesize pertinent information and inputs, and execute algorithms to control<br>
various actuators to achieve control targets, including such parameters as fuel<br>
economy, emissions, performance, driveability, and protection of hardware,<br>
including batteries of ESD 74 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72. The distributed<br>
control module architecture includes engine control module ('ECM') 23,<br>
transmission control module ('TCM') 17, battery pack control module<br>
('BPCM') 21, and Transmission Power Inverter Module ('TPIM') 19. A<br>
hybrid control module ('HCP') 5 provides overarching control and<br>
coordination of the aforementioned control modules. There is a User Interface<br>
('UI') 13 operably connected to a plurality of devices through which a vehicle<br>
operator typically controls or directs operation of the powertrain including the<br>
transmission 10 through a request for a torque output. Exemplary vehicle<br>
operator inputs to the UI 13 include an accelerator pedal, a brake pedal, a<br>
transmission gear selector, and, vehicle speed cruise control. Each of the<br>
aforementioned control modules communicates with other control modules,<br>
sensors, and actuators via a local area network ('LAN') bus 6. The LAN bus 6<br>
allows for structured communication of control parameters and commands<br>
between the various control modules. The specific communication protocol<br>
utilized is application-specific. The LAN bus and appropriate protocols<br>
provide for robust messaging and multi-control module interfacing between<br><br>
the aforementioned control modules, and other control modules providing<br>
functionality such as antilock brakes, traction control, and vehicle stability.<br>
 The HCP 5 provides overarching control of the hybrid powertrain<br>
system, serving to coordinate operation of the ECM 23, TCM 17, TPIM 19,<br>
and BPCM 21. Based upon various input signals from the UI 13 and the<br>
powertrain, including the battery pack, the HCP 5 generates various<br>
commands, including: an operator torque request, an engine torque command,<br>
clutch torque commands for the various clutches CI, C2, C3, C4 of the<br>
transmission 10; and motor torque commands for MG-A and MG-B. The<br>
TCM is operatively connected to the electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 of<br>
Fig. 3, including monitoring various pressure sensing devices (not depicted)<br>
and generating and executing control signals for various solenoids to control<br>
pressure switches and control valves contained therein.<br>
 The ECM 23 is operably connected to the engine 14, and functions to<br>
acquire data from a variety of sensors and control a variety of actuators,<br>
respectively, of the engine 14 over a plurality of discrete lines collectively<br>
depicted as aggregate line 35. The ECM 23 receives the engine torque<br>
command from the HCP 5, and generates a desired axle torque, and an<br>
indication of actual engine torque input to the transmission, which is<br>
communicated to the HCP 5. For simplicity, ECM 23 is depicted generally<br>
having bi-directional interface with engine 14 via aggregate line 35. Various<br>
other parameters that may be sensed by ECM 23 include engine coolant<br>
temperature, engine input speed, N|, to shaft 12 leading to the transmission,<br>
manifold pressure, ambient air temperature, and ambient pressure. Various<br>
actuators that may be controlled by the ECM 23 include fuel injectors, ignition<br>
modules, and throttle control modules.<br>
 The TCM 17 is operably connected to the transmission 10 and<br>
functions to acquire data from a variety of sensors and provide command<br>
signals to the transmission. Inputs from the TCM 17 to the HCP 5 include<br>
estimated clutch torques for each of the clutches C1, C2, C3, and, C4 and<br><br>
rotational speed, N0, of the output shaft 64. Other actuators and sensors may<br>
be used to provide additional information from the TCM to the HCP for<br>
control purposes. The TCM 17 monitors inputs from pressure switches and<br>
selectively actuates pressure control solenoids and shift solenoids to actuate<br>
various clutches to achieve various transmission operating modes, as described<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
 The BPCM 21 is signally connected one or more sensors operable to<br>
monitor electrical current or voltage parameters of the ESD 74 to provide<br>
information about the state of the batteries to the HCP 5. Such information<br>
includes battery state-of-charge, battery voltage and available battery power.<br>
 The Transmission Power Inverter Module (TPIM) 19 includes<br>
previously referenced power inverters and motor control modules configured<br>
to receive motor control commands and control inverter states therefrom to<br>
provide motor drive or regeneration functionality. The TPIM 19 is operable<br>
to generate torque commands for MG-A 56 and MG-B 72, based upon input<br>
from the HCP 5, which is driven by operator input through UI 13 and<br>
system operating parameters. The motor torque commands for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are implemented by the control system, including the TPIM 19, to<br>
control MG-A and MG-B. Individual motor speed signals for MG-A and<br>
MG-B are derived by the TPIM 19 from the motor phase information or<br>
conventional rotation sensors. The TPIM 19 determines and communicates<br>
motor speeds to the HCP 5. The electrical energy storage device 74 is high-<br>
voltage DC-coupled to the TPIM 19 via DC lines 27. Electrical current is<br>
transferable to or from the TPIM 19 in accordance with whether the ESD 74<br>
is being charged or discharged.<br>
 Each of the aforementioned control modules is preferably a general-<br>
purpose digital computer generally comprising a microprocessor or central<br>
processing unit, storage mediums comprising read only memory (ROM),<br>
random access memory (RAM), electrically programmable read only memory<br><br><br>
(EPROM), high speed clock, analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog<br>
(D/A) circuitry, and input/output circuitry and devices (I/O) and appropriate<br>
signal conditioning and buffer circuitry. Each control module has a set of<br>
control algorithms, comprising resident program instructions and calibrations<br>
stored in ROM and executed to provide the respective functions of each<br>
computer. Information transfer between the various computers is preferably<br>
accomplished using the aforementioned LAN 6.<br>
 Algorithms for control and state estimation in each of the control<br>
modules are typically executed during preset loop cycles such that each<br>
algorithm is executed at least once each loop cycle. Algorithms stored in the<br>
non-volatile memory devices are executed by one of the central processing<br>
units and are operable to monitor inputs from the sensing devices and execute<br>
control and diagnostic routines to control operation of the respective device,<br>
using preset calibrations. Loop cycles are typically executed at regular<br>
intervals, for example each 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 100 milliseconds during<br>
ongoing engine and vehicle operation. Alternatively, algorithms may be<br>
executed in response to occurrence of an event.<br>
 In response to an operator's action, as captured by the UI 13, the<br>
supervisory HCP control module 5 and one or more of the other control<br>
modules determine requested output torque at shaft 64, also referred to as the<br>
operator torque request. Selectively operated components of the transmission<br>
10 are appropriately controlled and manipulated to respond to the operator<br>
demand. For example, in the exemplary embodiment depicted in Fig. 1 and 2,<br>
when the operator has selected a forward drive range and manipulates either<br>
the accelerator pedal or the brake pedal, the HCP 5 determines an output<br>
torque which affects how and when the vehicle accelerates or decelerates.<br>
Final vehicle acceleration is affected by other factors, including, e.g., road<br>
load, road grade, and vehicle mass. The HCP 5 monitors the parametric states<br>
of the torque-generative devices, and determines the output of the transmission<br>
required to arrive at the desired torque output. Under the direction of the HCP<br><br>
5, the transmission 10 operates over a range of output speeds from slow to fast<br>
in order to meet the operator demand.<br>
The exemplary two-mode, compound-split, electro-mechanical<br>
transmission operates in several fixed gear operating modes and continuously<br>
variable operating modes, described with reference to Fig. 1, and Table 1,<br>
below.<br><br>
 The various transmission operating modes described in the table<br>
indicate which of the specific clutches C1, C2, C3, and C4 are engaged or<br>
actuated for each operating mode. Additionally, in various transmission<br>
operating modes, MG-A and MG-B may each operate as electrical motors to<br>
generate motive torque, or as a generator to generate electrical energy. A first<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when clutch CI 70 is actuated in order to<br>
"ground" the outer gear member of the third planetary gear set 28. A second<br>
mode, or gear train, is selected when clutch CI 70 is released and clutch C2 62<br>
is actuated to connect the shaft 60 to the carrier of the third planetary gear set<br>
28. Other factors outside the scope of the invention affect when the electrical<br>
machines 56, 72 operate as motors and generators, and are not discussed<br>
herein.<br>
 The control system, depicted primarily in Fig. 2, is operable to<br>
provide a range of transmission output speeds at shaft 64 from relatively slow<br>
to relatively fast within each operating mode. The combination of two modes<br><br>
with a slow-to-fast output speed range in each mode allows the transmission<br>
10 to propel a vehicle from a stationary condition to highway speeds, and meet<br>
various other requirements as previously described. Additionally, the control<br>
system coordinates operation of the transmission 10 so as to allow<br>
synchronized shifts between the operating modes.<br>
 The first and second modes of operation refer to circumstances in<br>
which the transmission functions are controlled by one clutch, i.e. either clutch<br>
C1 62 or C2 70, and by the controlled speed and torque of the electrical<br>
machines 56 and 72, which can be referred to as a continuously variable<br>
transmission operating mode. Certain ranges of operation are described below<br>
in which fixed ratios are achieved by applying an additional clutch. This<br>
additional clutch may be clutch C3 73 or C4 75, as shown in the table, above.<br>
 When the additional clutch is applied, fixed ratio operation of input-<br>
to-output speed of the transmission, i.e. Ni/N0, is achieved. The rotations of<br>
machines MG-A and MG-B 56, 72 are dependent on internal rotation of the<br>
mechanism as defined by the clutching and proportional to the input speed<br>
measured at shaft 12. The machines MG-A and MG-B function as motors or<br>
generators. They are completely independent of engine to output power flow,<br>
thereby enabling both to be motors, both to function as generators, or any<br>
combination thereof. This allows, for instance, during operation in Fixed Ratio<br>
1 that motive power output from the transmission at shaft 64 is provided by<br>
power from the engine and power from MG-A and MG-B, through planetary<br>
gear set 28 by accepting power from BSD 74.<br>
 Referring to Fig. 3, a schematic diagram is depicted which provides a<br>
more detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic system for<br>
controlling flow of hydraulic fluid in the exemplary transmission. The main<br>
hydraulic pump 88, driven off the input shaft from the engine 10, and auxiliary<br>
pump 110, operatively electrically controlled by the TPIM 19, provide<br>
pressurized fluid to the hydraulic circuit 42 through valve 140. The auxiliary<br>
pump 110 preferably comprises an electrically-powered pump of an<br><br><br>
appropriate size and capacity to provide sufficient flow of pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid into the hydraulic system when operational. Pressurized<br>
hydraulic fluid flows into electro-hydraulic control circuit 42, which is<br>
operable to selectively distribute hydraulic pressure to a series of devices,<br>
including the torque-transfer clutches CI 70, C2 62, C3 73, and C4 75, cooling<br>
circuits for machines A and B, and a circuit for cooling and lubricating the<br>
transmission 10 via passages 142, 144 (not depicted in detail). As previously<br>
stated, the TCM 17 is preferably operable to actuate the various clutches to<br>
achieve various transmission operating modes through selective actuation of<br>
hydraulic circuit flow control devices comprising pressure control solenoids<br>
('PCS') PCS1 108, PCS2 112, PCS3 114, PCS4 116 and solenoid-controlled<br>
flow management valves X-valve 118 and Y-valve 120. The circuit is fluidly<br>
connected to pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 via passages 124, 122,<br>
126, and 128, respectively. The pressure control solenoid PCS1 108 has<br>
control positions of neutral and high and is operative to provide modulation of<br>
fluidic pressure in the hydraulic circuit through fluidic interaction with valve<br>
109. Pressure control solenoid PCS2 112 has control positions of neutral and<br>
low, and is fluidly connected to spool valve 113 and operative to effect flow<br>

solenoid PCS4 116 has control positions of neutral and low, and is fluidly<br>
connected to spool valve 117 and operative to effect flow therethrough when<br>
actuated. Spool valve 117 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS4 via<br>
passage 128.<br>
 The X-Valve 119 and Y-Valve 121 each comprise flow management<br>
valves controlled by solenoids 118, 120, respectively, in the exemplary<br>
system, and have control states of High (T) and Low ('0'). The control states<br><br>
reference positions of each valve effecting flow control to different devices in<br>
the hydraulic circuit 42 and the transmission 10. The X-valve 119 is operative<br>
to direct pressurized fluid to clutches C3 and C4 and cooling systems for<br>
stators of MG-A and MG-B via fluidic passages 136, 138, 144, 142<br>

121 is fluidly connected to pressure switch PS2 via passage 122. A more<br>
detailed description of the exemplary electro-hydraulic control circuit 42 is<br>
provided in commonly assigned U.S. Patent Application No. 11/263216<br>
Attorney Docket No. GP 306089, entitled "A Multiplexed Pressure Switch<br>
System for an Electrically Variable Hybrid Transmission", which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0033] An exemplary logic table to accomplish control of the electro-<br>
hydraulic control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 2, below.<br><br><br><br>
 Referring to Tables 1 and 2, the low range operating state includes<br>
selective actuation of clutches C2, C1, and C4, facilitating operation in any<br>
one of continuously variable Mode I, and fixed gears GR1, GR2, and GR3.<br>
The high range operating state includes selective actuation of clutches C2, C3,<br>
and C4, facilitating operation in any one of continuously variable Mode II and<br>
fixed gears GR3 and GR4. It should be recognized that ranges of continuously<br>
variable operation for Mode I and Mode II may overlap.<br>
 An exemplary table comprising expected signal output states of the<br>
pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4 in the exemplary electro-hydraulic<br>
control circuit 42 is provided with reference to Table 3, below, for various<br>
transmission operating modes. Each of the pressure switches PS1, PS2, PS3,<br>
PS4 have hydraulic output states of 0 = Off and 1 = On, wherein the state<br>
transition occurs at a threshold appropriate to the hydraulic circuit. In this<br>
embodiment, the state transition preferably occurs at about 140 kPa (50 psi),<br>
meaning that output state of each pressure switch is "0" or Off when the<br>
monitored hydraulic pressure is less than 140 kPa and the output state of each<br>
pressure switch is "1" or On when the monitored hydraulic pressure is greater<br>
than 140 kPa. 'LM' indicates the PCS1 is used for line pressure modulation.<br><br><br><br><br>
Selective control of the X- and Y-valves and actuation of the solenoids PCS2,<br>
PCS3, and PCS4 facilitate flow of hydraulic fluid to actuate clutches C1, C2,<br>
C3, and C4, and provide cooling for the stators of MG-A and MG-B.<br>
 In operation, a shift occurs in the exemplary transmission due to a<br>
variety of operating characteristics of the powertrain. There may be a change<br>
in demand for an operator demand for torque. Such demands are typically<br>
communicated through inputs to the UI 13 as previously described.<br>
Additionally, a change in demand for output torque may be predicated on a<br>
change in external conditions, including, e.g., changes in road grade, road<br>
surface conditions, or wind load. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in powertrain torque demand caused by a control module command to<br>
change one of the electrical machines between electrical energy generating<br>
mode and torque generating mode. A shift change may be predicated on a<br>
change in an optimization algorithm or routine operable to determine optimum<br>
system efficiency based upon operator demand for power, battery state of<br>
charge, and energy efficiencies of the engine 14 and MG-A and MG-B 56, 72.<br>
The control system manages torque inputs from the engine 14 and MG-A and<br>
MG-B 56, 72 based upon an outcome of the executed optimization routine,<br>
and there can be changes in system optimization that compel a shift change in<br>
order to optimize system efficiencies to improve fuel economy and manage<br><br>
battery charging. Furthermore, a shift change may be predicated upon a fault<br>
in a component or system. The distributed control module architecture acts in<br>
concert to determine a need for a change in the transmission operating mode,<br>
and executes the forgoing to effect the change in transmission operation. A<br>
shift change in the exemplary system comprises one of at least three possible<br>
situations. There can be a shift from one fixed gear to a second fixed gear.<br>
There can be a shift from a fixed gear to one of the continuously variable<br>
modes. There can be a shift from one of the continuously variable modes to a<br>
fixed gear.<br>
 The invention described herein is executed in the exemplary system<br>
described with reference to Figs 1 -- 3 wherein a preferred operating mode is<br>
determined by the control system and specific clutches are actuated in<br>
accordance with Table 1 to achieve the preferred operating mode. The<br>
electro-hydraulic circuit is controlled in accordance with Table 2 to actuate the<br>
specific clutches. The expected output states for the pressure switches PS1,<br>
PS2, PS3, and PS4 are monitored in accordance with Table 3. A fault is<br>
identified with one of the hydraulic circuit flow control devices when a signal<br>
output of one of the pressure monitoring devices does not correspond to an<br>
expected signal output for the pressure monitoring device, as determined after<br>
an elapsed period of time, as detailed in Table 3.<br>
 By way of example, when the exemplary transmission is operating in<br>
GR1, clutches C1 and C4 are actuated. In this instance, the X-valve 118 is<br>
commanded to High state, or "1", the Y-valve 120 is commanded to Low<br>
state, or "0", PCS2 solenoid 112 is commanded off, PCS3 solenoid 114 is<br>
commanded on, and PCS4 solenoid 116 is commanded on. The output states<br>
of the pressure switches are PS 1 = 1, PS2 = 0, PS3 = 0, and PS4 = 1. A fault<br>
is identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of the output states of the<br>
pressure switches does not match the expected state, i.e., when any one of the<br>
following is true: PS1 = 0, PS2 = 1, PS3 = 1, or PS4 = 0, after an elapsed time<br><br>
of one second, for this example. Other examples become apparent on reading<br>
Tables 1, 2, and 3.<br>
A fault can be identified in the electro-hydraulic control circuit<br>
related to a clutch actuation event, a clutch deactivation event, or a clutch<br>
slippage event during a shift or vehicle launch. During a clutch actuation<br>
event, a fault is preferably identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of<br>
the output states of the pressure switches does not match the expected state<br>
after an elapsed time of about 150 milliseconds. During a clutch deactivation<br>
event, a fault is preferably identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of<br>
the output states of the pressure switches does not match the expected state<br>
after an elapsed time of about one second. During a clutch slippage event, a<br>
fault is preferably identified in the hydraulic circuit when any one of the<br>
output states of the pressure switches does not match the expected state after<br>
an elapsed time of about two seconds.<br>
 A fault can comprise, for example, a fault in the control system, a<br>
fault in a wiring harness connecting the devices of the hydraulic circuit to the<br>
control system, a fault in one of the pressure switches, and a fault in one of the<br>
pressure control solenoids and flow management valves.<br>
 Identifying a fault in the electro-hydraulic control circuit preferably<br>
includes isolating location the fault to one of the hydraulic circuit devices<br>
when a signal output of one of the pressure monitoring devices does not<br>
correspond to an expected signal output. This facilitates root cause detection<br>
of the fault to permit effective continued operation and servicing of the<br>
system.<br>
 An example of a method to identify and isolate a fault includes a<br>
situation wherein the transmission is operating in a fixed gear mode, and a<br>
signal is sent to deactivate an off-going clutch by selectively deactivating one<br>
of the pressure control solenoids, e.g. from fixed gear GR1 to continuously<br>
variable Mode I . The hydraulic circuit elements are changed accordingly to<br>
deactivate clutch C4, and outputs of the pressure switches are monitored<br><br><br>
thereafter. In this example, the outputs of the pressure switches should change<br>
from PS1/ PS2/ PS3/ PS4 = 1/0/0/1 to PS1/ PS2/ PS3/ PS4 = 1/0/0/0. If the<br>
output of the pressure switches remains unchanged, the control system is<br>
operable to monitor slippage of the off-going clutch by comparing the input<br>
speed, N,, to the output speed multiplied by the fixed gear ratio, e.g. N0*GR1,<br>
when in the first fixed gear GR1. A fault related to the selectively deactivated<br>
pressure control solenoid, in this instance PCS4 for clutch C4, is identified<br>
when the slippage of the off-going clutch does not exceed a minimum<br>
threshold, e.g. about 300 RPM and based upon allowable measurement error,<br>
after an elapsed time of one second. A fault related to the pressure monitoring<br>
device is identified when the slippage of the off-going clutch exceeds the<br>
minimum threshold after the elapsed time.<br>
 When a fault is identified in the electro-hydraulic control circuit, the<br>
control system can command operation of the transmission into a restricted<br>
operating mode, including operating in one of the two continuously variable<br>
operating modes. The fault can be subsequently verified through further<br>
action. The control system then preferably notifies the vehicle operator of the<br>
fault, including illuminating the service lamp on the instrument panel in the<br>
vehicle.<br>
 It is understood that modifications in the transmission hardware are<br>
allowable within the scope of the invention. The invention has been described<br>
with specific reference to the preferred embodiments and modifications<br>
thereto. Further modifications and alterations may occur to others upon<br>
reading and understanding the specification. It is intended to include all such<br>
modifications and alterations insofar as they come within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br><br><br>
