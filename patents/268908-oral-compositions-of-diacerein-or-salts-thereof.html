COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10 and rule13)<br>
1. TITLE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
ORAL COMPOSITIONS OF DIACEREIN OR SALTS THEREOF<br>
2. APPLICANT (S)<br>
(a)	NAME: WOCKHARDT LTD.<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY: INDIAN<br>
(c)	ADDRESS: Wockhardt Limited, D-4, MIDC, Chikalthana,<br>
Aurangabad (M.S.) INDIA.<br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof having D90 particle size of 20 microns optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
4. Description<br>
The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof having D90 particle size of 20 microns optionally with one or more pharmaceutical^ acceptable excipients.<br>
Rhein, (Formula I), is chemically 9,10-dihydro-4, 5-dihydroxy-9, 10-dioxo-2-anthracene carboxylic acid and diacerein, (Formula II), is chemically 4,5-bis (acetyloxy) 9,10-dihydro-4, 5-dihydroxy-9, 10-dioxo-2-anthracenecarboxylic acid. Diacerein is used particularly in the treatment of osteoarthritis. Diacerein has a unique mode of action that differentiates it from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other conventional forms of drug therapy. It has a melting point of 217-218Â°C. It has a molecular weight of 368.29 and molecular formula is C19H12O8.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Diacerein is practically insoluble in the solvents compatible with a pharmaceutical use, such as water, alcohols, acetone, dichloromethane and chloroform. Further, diacerein can be administered by oral route but it cannot be completely absorbed by the digestive tract, and this incomplete absorption may result in undesirable side effects such as laxatives effects.<br>
In order to overcome these problems, various derivatives, pharmaceutical compositions and specific galenic forms have been proposed in the literature. For example, European patent EP 243,968 describes a diacerein potassium salt, which is water-soluble and can be used in the preparation of compositions for parenteral administration.<br>
Besides, it is known that the solubility and/or wettability of a substance can be improved by treatment with a surface-active agent, which results in promoting the bioavailability of the active principle.<br>
It is also known that the grinding of active principles in the presence of certain water-soluble polymers improves the solubility and the bioavailability of the product (Yamamoto et al., J. Pharm. Sci. (1976) 65, p. 1484-88).<br>
There are various patents/applications, which describe pharmaceutical compositions of diacerein. For example, EP243968B1 provides parenteral preparations of diacerein salts.<br>
US Patent No 6,124,358 and European Patent No EP904060B1 provides pharmaceutical composition comprising co-micronized rhein or diacerein, with sodium lauryl sulfate.<br>
Although it is possible to improve the bioavailability of diacerein by comicronization, as described in EP 904061B1; US 6,124,358, it is still desirable to develop new formulations or new compositions likely to further improve the<br><br><br>
bioavailability, and it might be possible to use the dissolution kinetics of diacerein.<br>
US Patent No 5,149,542 (EP263083B1), 4,861,599 (EP 264989B1) and 5,275,824 (EP 446753B1) provides controlled release or delayed release compositions.<br>
US Patent No 5,225,192 (EP 364944B1) and 5,569,469 describe different poorly soluble medicaments supported on polymer substances.<br>
US Patent No 5,952,383 and European Patent No EP 862423B1 provides pharmaceutical compositions of diacerein, rhein and their salts along with excipients.<br>
The present inventors while working on the diacerein formulation have surprisingly found when diacerein having D90 particle size of 20 microns is used; it leads to significant increase in solubility of diacerein leading to increased percent drug release of diacerein as compared to Art 50 (Marketed formulation of diacerein). Art 50 releases about 14% of diacerein in 60 minutes, whereas pharmaceutical composition of the present invention releases about 100% of diacerein in 30 minutes. This may lead to increased bioavailability. The increased bioavailability may further lead to reduction in side effects i.e. soft stools.<br>
The term "D90 particle size of 20 microns" as used herein refers to particle size distribution wherein at least 90% of particles have size less than 20 microns.<br>
One of the aspects of the present invention provides rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof having D90 particle size of 20 microns.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof having D90 particle size of 20 microns optionally with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br><br><br>
In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of making rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof having D90 particle size of 20 microns, which process comprises of dispersing rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof in liquid dispersion medium and wet grinding said rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof by suitable mechanical means.<br>
In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process of making rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof having D90 particle size of 20 microns, which process comprises of dispersing rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof in liquid dispersion medium in the presence of surfactant and wet grinding said rhein or diacerein, or salts thereof by suitable mechanical means.<br>
Suitable liquid dispersion medium are those known to the ordinary skill in the art and include but not limited to one or more of water, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, butanol, hexane, glycols, vegetable oils, mineral oils and the like.<br>
