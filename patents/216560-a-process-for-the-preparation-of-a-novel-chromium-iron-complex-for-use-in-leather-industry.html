				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of a novel chromium-iron complex for use in Leather industry. It has potential use predominantly as a self-tanning agent for hides and skins. The complex may also be used as a natural aid for developing various shades by adding external aids other than dyes during post tanning operations on leathers tanned with this complex.<br>
Conventional chrome tanning practices give rise to an uptake of only 50-60% of chromium offered. The poor uptake of chromium in tanning has resulted in wide scale ecological concerns and economic loss. As reported by Chandrasekaran {Leather Science, 34, 91, 1987) several methods have been evolved over the<br>
vh<br>
years for better management of chromium in leather industry. Among the several options considered, the chrome saver approach and the development of mineral alternatives to chromium have been gaining momentum.<br>
Many products based on metal ions like aluminium, titanium, zirconium and iron have been reported in the past by Covington (Chemical Society Reviews,26, 73, 1997), to have tanning potency. But these products lack the ability to withstand pH conditions above 5.5, as described by Heidemann (Fundamentals of Leather Manufacture, Eduard Roether KG publications 1st edition, Chapter 11, 1993). Though several efforts have been taken to overcome these drawbacks, universal<br>
availability and high cost have forced researchers to look for other alternatives as well.<br>
As reported by Percy et al (The Analyst, 123, 41, 1998), the subject of iron tanning has been of great academic interest in view of the existence of iron-protein combinations in nature and the ease with which iron forms complex ions. Knapp (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 16, 658, 1921) obtained a number of patents covering iron tanning, but all his attempts to manufacture iron-tanned leather failed because the resulting feather was not only brittle and thin but also found to deteriorate with ageing. When used as a tanning agent iron has a tendency to hydrolyze and precipitate as hydrated oxide or as a highly basic salt. Casaburi (Journal of Society of International Leather Trades<br>
,, t<br>
and Chemists, 3, 61, 1919) postulated that the poor results obtained in iron tannage were due to incomplete removal of uncombined ferric salts from the leather. Further iron tanned leathers have been reported to darken on ageing. Thorstensen and Theis (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 44(12), 841, 1942) reported that the addition of masking salts to an iron tannage reduced the hydrolysis of iron salt. Ruppenthal and Malik (Journal of American ^Leather Technologists and Chemists, 38, 148, 1943) have reported that a combination of chromium and iron tannage could be advantageous for obtaining leathers of good shrinkage temperature. They found that an iron pretannage followed by chrome tanning leaves very little iron in the effluent while a chrome<br>
pretannage followed by iron tanning leaves very little chromium in the effluent. This could be due to the fact that both iron and chromium follow the same tanning mechanism, and when separately offered for tanning, one hinders the fixation of the other.<br>
Recently Platon et al (Proceedings of the International Union of Leather Technologists and Chemists Society Congress, 405, 1993) have reported the development of heterocomplexes of chromium and iron with glucose as the reducing agent. As reported by Thorstensen and Theis (Journal of American Leather Chemists Association, 44(12), 841, 1942), mineral tanning agents containing iron without masking agents are known to deteriorate the leather on ageing. Thus the limitation of these complexes is that they are not stable against hydrolysis. Moreover, the absence of organic ligands leads to the offer of 2.2% metal oxide for tanning to produce leather of shrinkage temperature of maximum of 107°C. Under such conditions the amount of chromium in the effluent (as chromium) has been found to be 875 ppm. This high discharge of chromium in the environment certainly generates great ecological concerns.<br>
Dyeing improves the aesthetic value of leather. The increasing awareness of harmful effects of the conventional dyes has brought in a need for ecofriendly dyes throughout the world. The ban on arylamine based dyes has also motivated the leather dyers to look for better options, which include the use natural dyes.<br>
Although natural stuff like Log-wood, Fustic and hypernic have in the past been used in dyeing of leather, yet they are not free from certain limitations like limited availability as well as limited potential variation of shade. Thorstensen (Practical Leather Technology, Krieger publishing company, 4h edition, Florida, 1993). reported that in the presence of iron salts, the condensed tannins produce greenish black colour, while the hydrolysable tannins produce blue-violet colour.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of a novel chromium-iron complex for use in feather industry, which obviates the drawbacks stated above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to prepare a mineral tanning agent having an active ingredient capable of giving near zero wastage of metal salt.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to exploit the ability of chromium and iron to form mixed oxo complexes in the presence of organic ligands which when used would resist darkening/deterioration of leather on ageing.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to develop a tanning salt which when used in tanning gives an exhaustion of more than 90% of the metal salts employed.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to develop a tanning salt which can be used to produce leathers of various shades by treating with eco-friendly natural stuff other than dyes.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a novel chromium-iron complex for use in leather industry, which comprises<br>
i)        mixing a salt of iron with that of hexavalent chromium in water,<br>
ii)       treating the reaction mixture, as formed in step (i), with sulphuric acid,<br>
iii) adding reducing agent such as herein described and organic ligand to the reaction mixture as formed in step(ii), either simultaneously or in succession, in one or more installments, maintaining the temperature in the range of 85 to 105°C,<br>
iv) ageing the reaction mixture, as formed in step (iii), for 8-12 hrs, pH is maintained at 2.5 to 2.8,<br>
v) subjecting the resulting suspension,as formed in step (iv), to separation process by known method followed by conventional drying of the final liquor to form the chromium-iron complex.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the salt of hexavalent chromium used may be sodium dichromate, potassium dichromate, ammonium dichromate.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the iron salt used may be such as ferrous sulphate, ferrous ammonium sulphate, ferric s.ulphate.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of iron salt used may be such as 0.1 - 2.0 moles of iron per mole of chromium.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of water added to the reaction mixture may be such as 15-30 moles of water per mole of chromium.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of sulphuric acid used may be such as 1.3 -1.5 moles per mole of chromium.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the reducing agent used may be such as molasses, glucose, sodium sulphite, sodium bisulphite, either individually or in combination.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the amount of reducing agent may be in the range of 0.1 -0.2 moles per mole of chromium.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the organic ligand used may be such as citric acid, phthalic acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid, lactic acid, any alkali metal salt of these acids, either individually or in combination.<br>
In still another embodiment of -the present invention, the amount of organic ligand used may be 0.1 -1.0 mole per mole of chromium.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the temperature of the reaction mixture to be maintained, while adding the reducing agent and the organic ligands may be in the range of 85-105°C.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the pH of the slurry after ageing may be in the range of 2.5-2.8.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the process of separation of the suspension may be such as filtration, gravity precipitation, centrifugajion.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the process for drying of the final liquor may be such as drum drying, spray drying, air drying effected at 130-260°C over a period of 3-60 seconds.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a novel chromium-iron complex prepared by the process described above.<br>
0.1 - 2.0 moles of a salt of iron per mole of chromium is mixed with that of hexavalent chromium and 15-30 moles of water per mole of chromium is added to the reaction mixture with continuous stirring. Sulphuric acid calculated as 1.3-1.5 moles per mole of chromium is then added to the reaction mixture while continuing the stirring. 0.1-0.2 mole of a reducing agent per mole of chromium and 0.1-1.0 mole of organic ligand per mole of chromium are added to the above reaction mixture either simultaneously or in<br>
different successions, in one or more installments, with continuous stirring over a period of minimum 1 hr. Stirring is continued for minimum 1hr even after the complete addition of the above agents. The resultant mixture is then allowed to settle. After a period of 8-12 hrs, pH of the resulting suspension is checked to be in the range of 2.5-2.8. This suspension is then subjected to separation process by known method followed by conventional drying of the final liquor, obtained thereby, for 3-60 sec at a temperature in the range of 130-260°C to get the chromium-iron complex powder.<br>
The novelty of the present invention lies in selecting the starting materials and in providing a process to prepare a chrome-iron matrix in the form of an oxo bridged complex with additional complexing provided by organic ligands, thereby ensuring, unlike conventional iron based tanning agents, absence of any darkening/deterioration of the leathers on ageing, and facilitating higher uptake of both chromium and iron resulting not only in the reduction of pollution problem but also in raising the shrinkage temperature of leather above 105°C, with an additional option of developing various shades for leathers on treatment with non-dye external aids including eco-friendly vegetable tanning materials.<br>
