				<td>Even in the face of substantial government subsidies for development of new bus technologies, significant changes to conventional bus technology have been slow in coming. By and large, efforts to integrate new materials and power alternatives have been insufficient to address changing expectations of urban transportation managers and passengers, or to significantly reduce operating costs and initial purchase costs. However, dwindling petroleum reserves and an increasing concern about the greenhouse effect are creating a new sense of urgency. The prior art reveals many attempts to improve manufacturabilrty of buses, decrease curb weight, increase maneuverability and safety, Increase passenger comfort, and improve fuel efficiency.<br>
Thus, several urban transit vehicles that employ modular construction techniques are described. For example, V. Belik, B. Kurach, Y. Trach, Module element of city bus or like vehicle and bus assembled on the basis of such module elements, U.S. Patent No. 4,469,369 (September 4, 1984) describe a module element for a city bus that is itself fabricated from a chassis unit, a door section, and a window section. The modules may be left-handed or right-handed. Different versions of the chassis unit are provided according to whether it is to function as a drive unit or a steering unit. Modules are assembled with front and rear elements and varying numbers of center sections to provide buses of varying size and capacity.<br>
H. Forster, Universal vehicle system for the public local traffic, U.S. Patent Ho. 4,596,192 (June 24, 1986) describes a vehicle system for local public passenger transportation in which differing vehicle components are assembled to create vehicles of different size and capacity. Vehicles usable only on tracks, ones for use with or without tracks and ones for use only without tracks are possible.<br>
L. Bergstrom, H. Eklund, J. Pettersson, Chassis for a bus, PCT Application No. SE94/01108 (November 24, 1993) describe a bus chassis in which different versions of a front-end module are readily created by combining different front wheel modules and driver's compartment modules so that the height of the driver's compartment in relation to the rest of the bus varies.<br>
However, none of the examples above contemplate the use of unconventional suspension systems to enhance ride quality and reduce load requirements, permitting the use of composite building materials and lightweight parts. Nor do they consider improving vehicle mobility and maneuverability through the<br>
-2-<br><br>
provision of features such as all-wheel drive and all wheel-steering, or alternate power strategies such as hybrid power systems, or microprocessor control of the various vehicle subsystems.<br>
D. Quattrini, A. Carlo, Electrically powered urban public transport vehicle with a floor at a reduced height, European Patent Application No. 90202043 (August 11, 1989) describes an urban mass transit vehicle having a passenger compartment at a reduced height above the ground, with the wheels being located near the front and end regions. Each axle is provided with its own drive motor, providing all-wheel drive, allowing for optimal traction under adverse weather and road conditions. Additionally, all wheel steering is included to enhance maneuverability in confined spaces. Quadratttini, et a/., don't however envisage the use of hybrid power systems, or unconventional suspensions that allow reduction of load requirements, permitting construction of a vehicle with composite materials, and lightweight off-the shelf parts. Moreover, they do not think of cellular body construction.<br>
Municipality of Rotterdam, Manufacturing and implementation of a lightweight hybrid bus, www.eltis.org/data/101 e.htm. describes a bus incorporating a modular light body system that allows identical building systems for different sized vehicles, a substantial weight reduction, and hybrid traction. There is no mention of what features in the construction are responsible for the weight reduction, nor are features such as all-wheel drive, all-wheel steering, improved suspension systems, or microprocessor control of vehicle subsystems considered.<br>
L. Woods, J. Hamilton, Computer optimized adaptive suspension system having combined shock absorber/air spring unit, U.S. Patent No. 4,468,739 (August 28, 1984) and L Woods, J. Hamilton, Computer optimized adaptive suspension system, U.S. Patent No. 4,634,142 (January 6, 1987) describe a vehicle suspension system in which a computer controls damping and spring forces to optimize ride and handling characteristics under a wide range of driving conditions. While a variety of suspension characteristics are achievable by programming the controller, there is no evidence that the suspension system described incorporates features that reduce load bearing requirements for the vehicle frame, allowing the vehicle to be manufactured from lightweight, off-the-shelf automobile or light truck parts. Furthermore, the described suspension provides no means of adjusting vehicle height relative to the roadway. And there<br>
-3-<br><br>
is no suggestion that the suspension is appropriate for use in urban mass transit vehicles.<br>
P. Eisen, All-wheel steering for motor vehicles, U.S. Patent No. 5,137,292 (August 11,1992) describes an all-wheel steering arrangement having a coupler mechanism between the front and rear axles. There is no indication that the described arrangement is suitable for anything other than vehicles having two axles. What's more, the steering system is a simple, mechanical system. There is no provision for individual control of each axle a microprocessor or controller in a multi-axle vehicle.<br>
There exists, therefore a need for an urban transit vehicle that:<br>
o	is affordable and easily manufactured;<br>
o    is lightweight;<br>
o	is highly maneuverable;<br>
o	provides exceptional passenger comfort;<br>
o	is energy-efficient; and<br>
o	minimizes or eliminates air and noise pollution commonly associated with<br>
buses.<br>
It would be a significant technological advance to provide a cellular body construction, in which vehicles are constructed from identical components or cells, one cell including a passenger compartment, the associated floor, sidewalls, roof, an axle with drive train, wheels, suspension, steering and brakes. It would be advantageous to construct vehicles of varying size, simply by "bolting together" the required number of  cells, easily allowing the manufacture of vehicles having any number of evenly spaced axles. It would be desirable to provide a suspension system in which each wheel has its own independent suspension, thereby providing greatly improved ride quality. It would be an advantage to configure the suspension system to permit reduced load carrying requirements on the vehicle frame, allowing the vehicle to be fabricated from lightweight, off-the-shelf parts and lightweight materials, It would be a great benefit to equip the vehicle with an energy-efficient, hybrid fuel system, so that reliance on increasingly scarce and environmentally unfriendly fossil fuels is greatly reduced or eliminated. It would also be desirable to equip the vehicle with all-wheel steering, thus permitting a much-reduced steering radius and allowing the vehicle to be easily maneuvered in city traffic as well as on narrow, residential streets. It would be advantageous to provide an advanced control system that integrated control of the steering, suspension, braking and power systems.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In recognition of the needs enumerated above, the invention provides a lightweight, highly maneuverable urban mass transit vehicle incorporating a cellular body design in which the vehicle is constructed from a varvina number of substantially identical cells, fixedly assembled end-to-end to produce vehicles of varying size and capacity. Each cell includes the passenger compartment, an associated section of floor, sidewalls, roof; an axle with drive train, wheels, suspension, steering and brakes. The body portion of the cells is fabricated from durable, lightweight materials such as composites or advanced steel products, greatly reducing the weight of the finished vehicle, which allows substantially increased fuel economy, and greatly reduced wear and tear on roadways. The invented vehicle has a multi=axle configuration, each cell having an axle, so that a typical vehicle has at least three axles preferably evenly spaced. A novel multi-axle suspension system, in which independent suspensions couple wheels at each end of each axle, incorporates innovations that provide an exceptionally stable, smooth ride. Among these, novel features are:<br>
o	a height adjuster that allows the height of the vehicle over the roadway to<br>
be adjusted, providing passage over large bumps and dips in the road,<br>
facilitating passenger boarding, and allowing the passenger compartment<br>
of the vehicle to be made level in places where the roadway is not, such<br>
as on a crowned road;<br>
o	an active air spring system greatly reduces the bump force when a wheel<br>
is raised by going over a bump in the road; and<br>
o	a drop-stop active shock absorber that damps the downward motion of a<br>
wheel into depressions in the roadway, providing resistance for up to the<br>
full force of the compressed spring.<br>
Providing multiple pairs of suspensions, preferably closely and evenly spaced, reduces the load requirements for the body, allowing the use of lightweight stock parts, such as those for light trucks and SUV's, thus reducing further the necessary weight of the vehicle and substantially reducing manufacturing and repair costs.<br>
An all-wheel steering system provides the vehicle exceptional maneuverability, also allowing the vehicle to be maneuvered in ways previously unavailable such as crab mode, for parking in tight spots, or pivot mode. Along with the suspension, power and braking systems, control of the steering system is mediated through a microprocessor-based command and control system.<br>

A hybrid power system combines an alternative fueled engine to power electricity generation and all-wheel drive with main energy stored in a number of storage batteries.<br>

DETAILED  DESCRIPTION<br>
The current state of metropolitan transportation is problematic. As populations continue to grow, automobile transportation becomes increasingly difficult to sustain. The cost of building and maintaining highways, coupled with other problems such as long commute times, air pollution and dwindling petroleum reserves renders public transportation increasingly attractive. Unfortunately, because of land use decisions based on automobile transportation and its accompanying economics - typified by low-density suburban residential development,   diffuse   low-rise   commercial   development,    and   scattered<br>
-8-<br><br>
development not easily accommodated in public transportation planning -effective solutions have been difficult to identify. Partly because of social factors such as a disinclination to use public transportation and problems with the medium itself, buses and related transit systems have not significantly increased the portion of the population using public transportation.<br>
The invention provides a solution that radically changes both the economics of bus transportation and addresses many of the social factors that limit it. Referring now to Figures 1a- d, an urban mass transit vehicle is shown tnat incorporates a number of advantageous features:<br>
DETAILED  DESCRIPTION<br>
The current state of metropolitan transportation is problematic. As populations continue to grow, automobile transportation becomes increasingly difficult to sustain. The cost of building and maintaining highways, coupled with other problems such as long commute times, air pollution and dwindling petroleum reserves renders public transportation increasingly attractive. Unfortunately, because of land use decisions based on automobile transportation and its accompanying economics - typified by low-density suburban residential development, diffuse low-rise commercial development, and scattered development not easily accommodated in public transportation planning -effective solutions have been difficult to identify. Partly because of social factors such as a disinclination to use public transportation and problems with the medium itself, buses and related transit systems have not significantly increased the portion of the population using public transportation.<br>
The invention provides a solution that radically changes both the economics of bus transportation and addresses many of the social factors that limit it. Referring now to Figures 1a - d, an urban mass transit vehicle is shown that incorporates a number of advantageous features:<br>
o	Cellular body construction allowing vehicles of various sizes and<br>
capacities to be built using identical parts. Drive motors, suspensions,<br>
control systems engines and generators, virtually every component, are<br>
the same for small buses and large, reducing part inventories, mechanic<br>
and operator training and repair time.<br>
o	Multiple    independent    suspensions    reduce   the    load-carrying<br>
requirements of the frame so that the overall weight of the vehicle may be<br>
reduced; also reducing load requirements of each suspension, permitting<br>
-9-<br><br>
the vehicle to be fabricated from off-the-shelf auto or light truck parts; and greatly stabilizing handling characteristics of the vehicle.<br>
o	Computer control of braking and suspension systems, permitting<br>
limousine-quality ride without the porpoising and swaying of traditional<br>
buses.<br>
o	Hybrid power system that combines an alternative-fueled engine for<br>
electricity generation and all-wheel electric drive with main energy storage<br>
in advanced chemical batteries and regenerative braking to recover kinetic<br>
energy. Along with the substantial reduction in weight, the power system<br>
significantly improves fuel economy, also eliminating the need for a bulky<br>
transmission, and providing improved driving characteristics.<br>
o	Construction from lightweight materials, providing low maintenance<br>
and long vehicle life, and permitting use of advanced load-bearina<br>
designs   and   lower-cost  fabrication  techniques.   Materials  may   be<br>
composite, or they may be advanced, lightweight metal products.<br>
o	Weight/capacity   advances,   permitting   vehicle   configurations  that<br>
improve payioad to empty vehicle weight ratio of a 40 - 50 person bus<br>
from approximately 60% to approximately 150% at maximum payload,<br>
and providing extraordinary fuel efficiency.<br>
o	Computer-mediated all-wheel steering, permitting much reduced<br>
turning radius, as well as "crab" and "pivot" turning.<br>
o	Flexible seating configurations, allowing operators to increase or<br>
decrease the passenger seating capacity and configuration readily.<br>
o	Multiple doors with option for compartmented interiors , offering a<br>
European train compartment feel and rapid entry, seating and exit.<br>
o	Low floor with multiple door ingress/egress with curb-level walk-on<br>
access that exceeds ADA standards.<br>
o	Automobile quality interiors with options.<br>
As Figure 1 shows, vehicles of different sizes and capacities are provided. Figure 1a shows a vehicle having five axles; 1b, a four-axle vehicle; 1c a three-axle vehicle and finally, a vehicle having six axles is shown in Figure 1d. As mentioned above, the body of the vehicle is fabricated, at least in part, from composite materials, such as fiberglass, graphite/epoxy or metal matrix composites. By replacing conventional materials with lightweight alternatives, such as composites and advanced metal products, it is possible to save weight and energy, reduce part count and assembly cost and to meet structural requirements that cannot be fulfilled using conventional materials.<br>

Figure 2 provides an exploded view of the invention that illustrates the construction of the vehicle from substantially identical cells. A central feature of the invention is the composition of a bus of a given lenath from a specific number of cells. Accordingly, four compartments 201 are provided, corresponding to four cells. As shown, the end compartments are modified to provide front and end units. Four exterior units 202 are shown, and four floor sections 203. Five axles. 204 with wheels coupled at each end are shown. Thus, one cell has two axles, while all remaining cells have one. In general, the end cell 204 is equipped with two axles, although the front cell could just as easily have two axles. For purposes of illustration, the various components of a cell have been shown separately. However, in actual practice, one ceil includes a compartment, the associated section of floor, sidewalls, roof; one axle with drive train, wheels, suspension, steering and brake assemblies, all pre-assembled to form a single unit. Construction of a vehicle essentially involves fastening together the required number of cells to produce a Vehicle of the reauired lenath and capacitv as illustrated in Figure 5. Thus, Figure 5a shows a vehicle having three cells, while Figure 5b shows the addition of a cell to the three-celled vehicle, resulting in the four-celled vehicle shown in Figure 5c. The cells are fastened together using fasteners such as bolts or rivets or alternatively, using bonding materials. In the preferred embodiment of the invention, the cells are permanently fastened together to produce a rigid vehicle of a fixed size. However, an embodiment is possible in which the cells are removably fastened together, allowing vehicles to be alterably configured.<br>
Figure 3 provides a view of an assembled vehicle 300 minus axles and wheels, with a portion of the exterior cut away to reveal the frame. In the preferred embodiment of the invention," a lightweight frame is provided. The material for the frame may be a composite, or a lightweight metal product, such as aluminum. As described above, providing multiple independent suspensions, with a narrow span between axles, offers distributed support for the vehicle body, greatly reducing the load-carrying requirements of the frame and allowing it to be extremely lightweight. It should be remembered that the frame is incorporated into the Individual cells, so that the frame shown in Figure 3 was achieved by bolting four cells together.<br>
Figure 4 shows an assembled vehicle body with an exterior sunroof 401. Other embodiments having a solid roof with no sunroof are also possible. The vehicle 400 is also equipped with passenger seating 402. As previously described, the passenger seating is highly configurable, so that the seating capacity is readily<br>
-11-<br><br>
increased or decreased. The smallest buses can have 14-20 seats and larger ones can have 45 - 55 seats. Seating can be provided in a conventional center aisle configuration, or in compartmented sections combined with center aisle sections. As previously indicated, automobile quality interiors permit the provision of a high level of passenger comfort, including individual seats, sound-deadening body and frame and insulation, and a compartment seating option.<br>
SUSPENSION<br>
Referring now to Figure 6, Figure 6a shows a side elevation of a vehicle having five axles, in which each wheel 603 is coupled to its respective axle by means of an associated independent suspension. The multiple independent suspensions are positioned such that the span between two adjacent suspensions, indicated by arrow 602, is greatly reduced. Compared to conventional buses having two-axle or tandem-axle configurations, the current arrangement provides a number of important advantages. The narrowly- and evenly-spaced suspensions provide evenly-distributed support, indicated by arrows 601, to the vehicle body across the entire length of the vehicle, as opposed to only providing support at either end, as is usual in conventional bus vehicles. The distributed support is an important factor in providing exceptional ride stability. Thus, as the vehicle negotiates a dip 605 in the road, the evenly-spaced suspensions, coupled with the vehicle's rigid structure, transfers the load from the wheel 604 to the remaining wheels such that the vehicle stays level through the dip, eliminating the "porpoising" commonly experienced as buses traverse dips in roadways. Furthermore, novel active suspension elements, including height adjusters which move individual wheels up and down relative to the vehicle body, air springs with rapidly variable stiffness, and shock absorbers with capability to prevent dropping a wheel into chuckhole (for example) allow an exceptionally smooth ride as the vehicle encounters irregularities in the road surface. The distributed support provided by the multiple suspensions reduces the load carrying requirements of the vehicle structure, allowing the structure to be constructed with an extremely light design, using advanced material, as described above. Because load requirements of each suspension are greatly reduced, the vehicle suspension can be constructed from "off-the-shelf" automobile or light truck parts.<br>
Rgures 6b - 6d illustrate the beneficial effect provided by including a height adjuster, described in greater detail below, as a component of each suspension. Under computer control, the height adjuster adjusts the height of each wheel<br>
-12-<br><br>
relative to the body on a relatively slow time scale, maintaining all wheels in contact with the road and allowing the vehicle to negotiate large dips or large humps in the roadway. By adjusting the height of one side of the vehicle relative to the other, the passenger compartment can be made level in places where the road is not, thus preventing the vehicle from wallowing in a road depression as in Figure 6b, and allowing it to remain level on a crowned road, as in Figure 6c. Additionally, the height adjuster can allow the vehicle to lean into turns on the highway, as shown in Figure 6d.<br>
Figure 7 provides a schematic diagram of a single suspension and associated parts for one wheel vehicle suspension. The suspension includes:<br>
o	a ride bumper 701;<br>
o	rotating elements 702, including at least   a wheel,   a tire,   the rotating<br>
element of a wheel motor with bearing part, and the rotating element of a<br>
brake assembly;<br>
o	non-rotating elements 703, including at least a control arm, spring, shock<br>
absorber, stabilizer, steering actuator and linkage, the fixed elements of<br>
brake and brake actuator, parts to mate with height adjustor assembly that<br>
is fixedly attached to the body or frame of the vehicle, the fixed element -<br>
of the wheel motor with a bearing part, which also performs the function of<br>
an axle, mechanical structure and bearings/bushings as needed;<br>
o	a height adjustor assembly 704, including mating plates, guides, bearings,<br>
actuator, mechanical structure fixedly attached to vehicle body/frame; and<br>
o	vehicle body/frame structure 705 (integrating structure for floor, bulkhead,<br>
battery box and seat.<br>
The individual suspension components are described in greater detail further below.<br>
Referring now to Figure 8, a schematic diagram shows how the independent suspensions integrate with the vehicle body/frame. The components listed above are shown in relation to the vehicles structural components:<br>
o	ride bumper 801;<br>
o	rotating elements 802;<br>
o	non-rotating elements 803;<br>
o	height adjustor 804,<br>
o	body frame/structure 805.<br>
-13-<br><br>
The view provided in Figure 8 is that looking toward the front of the vehicle. Thus, the left suspension 806 is shown with the wheel in its highest position relative to the body, and the right suspension 807 is shown with the wheel in its lowest position relative to the body.<br>
Figure 9 provides a side elevation of a vehicle illustrating how the suspension system is integrated into the overall vehicle. As described in greated detail below, the suspension is processor-controllable, and accepts input from different sources. As described above, individual, independent suspensions 901 are provided for each wheel including:<br>
o	tire;<br>
o	wheel<br>
o	axle;<br>
o	height adjustor assembly;<br>
o	spring;.<br>
o	shock absorber;<br>
o	mechanical support;<br>
o	sensors for suspension configuration;<br>
o	sources of actuation force: hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical; and<br>
o	stabilizer and ride bumper.<br>
One or more units 903 provide the actuation forces described above to the individual suspensions. Cabling 902 is provided for signal and electrical current transmission. In its preferred embodiment, the invention incorporates a wheel motor as described above for each wheel the axle beipg integrated with the wheelmotor. An alternative embodiment of the invention provides a continuous axle as shown in Figure 18, with a single drive motor for each axle. In the case of a continuous axle, the wheel assembly also includes a drive shaft, described further below. Control of the suspension is mediated through a microprocessor or controller 905, in concert with a signal processor element. Inputs to the suspension control system include those from the sensors already described, plus a road control sensor 905 and an operator interface 906.<br>
HEIGHT ADJUSTER<br>
Figure 10 provides a detailed illustration of the height adjuster system 1000 mentioned above. An important requirement of the vehicle suspension system is that each wheel moves up and down independently of all other wheels. This need is satisfied by providing trailing four-bar linkages 1001, actuated by pistons 1002. As Figure 7 shows, the height adjuster linkage attaches to the floor of the<br>
-14-<br><br>
vehicle, allowing the axle to move up and down when actuated. The preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes hydraulic pistons; however, a pneumatic piston would also be suitable. The four-bar linkage keeps the axle and all that is attached to it vertical without any tilting.<br>
AIR SPRING<br>
As shown in Figure 7, the vehicle suspension includes an active air spring system. Figure 11 shows a side elevation of a vehicle 1100 that includes an active air spring system 1101 as a suspension component. As previously mentioned, the suspension for each wheel moves up and down in relation to the vehicle body, with the body essentially remaining level and stationary. The height adjusters previously described provide the bulk of this vertical motion, particularly for the relatively slow operations described above, e.g., negotiation of large humps and dips, operation on crowned roads, and tilting into turns. In addition, the air spring has a long-stroke to smoothly accommodate substantial vertical wheel at higher rates of vertical travel. Because the action of the air spring is based on flow control and does not involve lifting the vehicle or working against dynamic loads, the air spring system is highly energy-efficient. The essential operating principle of the air spring system is that the body of the air spring 1102 communicates with a plenum 1103 through one or more progressive, fast-acting valves 1104. As shown in Figure 11b, progressive valves 1104 are adjusted through the action of valve plates 1105 (Fig. 11b) rotated by a common shaft with cams at angular intervals. As more of the progressive valves are fully opened, the total volume of the air spring system is increased. Conversely, the more valves that are completely closed, the more the volume of the spring system is decreased. Spring stiffness Is Inversely related to the available volume within the system Accordingly, with all valves closed, the spring has its maximum stiffness. Changing the spring stiffness does not itself change the force exerted by the spring. Thus, the air spring may best be characterized as a variable-constant air spring. The effect of making the spring softer Is that as a wheel traverses a bump and the road lifts the wheel and compresses the spring, less added force (i.e., a smaller "bump") is felt where the spring pushes up on the body. In actual practice, the air spring system can reduce bump force by a factor of five to ten. Additionally, the design of the air spring system allows it to be exceptionally fast acting, thus responding very rapidly relative to the time scale on which a change in spring stiffness must be Implemented to respond to individual features of the road surface and optimize ride quality.<br>
ACTIVE SHOCK ABSORBER<br>
-15-<br><br>
As Figure 7 shows, the suspension further includes an energy-efficient, active shock absorber. The primary novel objective of the shock absorber is to slow or stop the violent vertical drop of a wheel into a sharp depression such as a chuckhole. As with the air spring just described, the shock absorber derives its energy-efficiency from the fact that its action does not involve doing work against the weight of the vehicle or dynamic loads, but instead involves control of fluid flow within the element by means of a fast-acting valve. Thus, the energy requirement is only that required to operate the valve.<br>
Figure 12 shows the shock absorber 1200 in greater detail. The shock absorber includes a hydraulic fluid canister 1201 mounted to the top bearing plate 1206 of the spring. The mount has sufficient strength to cage the force of the fully loaded spring. The first end of a shaft 1203 is attached 1207 to the lower bearing plate of the spring. The other end of the shaft is received by a central opening on the lower face 1208 of the canister 1201 and traverses the volume of the canister axially to be received by a vaive stem 1202 that concentrically surrounds the shaft 1203. A pusher plate 1204 is concentrically attached to the shaft such that the pusher plate is stationary and incapable of rotating. The pusher plate 1204 is enclosed within a valve plate assembly 1205, the vaive plate assembly being continuous with the valve stem 1202. The valve stem emerges from a central opening in the top surface of the canister 1201 to be received by an actuator (not shown). It should be noted that the openings on both faces of the hydraulic canister are provided with fluid-tight seals to prevent the escape of hydraulic fluid from the canister and an attendant loss of pressure within the canister. Enclosure of the pusher plate 1204 within the valve plate assembly 1205 is achieved by sandwiching the pusher plate between two valve plates, upper and lower. Both the valve plates and the pusher plate are provided with openings 1209 (Figure 12b). The valve plates are stationary with respect to each other, with the openings 1211 of each valve plate being aligned, and the two valve plates are stationary with respect to the valve stem 1203. The entire valve assembly, consisting of the valve stem 1202 and the valve plate assembly 1205, rotates freely with respect to the pusher plate 1204 and the shaft 1203, which remain stationary. Thus, the openings of the valve plates and the pusher plate may align 1210, either fully or partially, or they may be offset from each other 1211.<br>
It may be seen that the combined pusher plate 1204 and valve plate assembly 1205 divide the hydraulic canister into two compartments. When the openings of the valve plate assembly 1205 and the pusher plate 1204 are aligned, fluid flow between compartments is permitted, according to the degree of alignment of the<br>
-16-<br><br>
openings, and when the openings are offset, fluid flow between the compartments is prevented. Thus, by permitting fluid flow from one compartment to the other, the valve plates and pusher plates are allowed to move through the fluid In a piston-like fashion, as the associated spring is 5 compressed or elongates. When fluid flow is completely obstructed by completely offsetting the openings of the valve plate assembly and the pusher plate, the shock absorber is stoppered and movement of the plates prevented. Accordingly, a variable amount of shock absorption is provided, determined b y the degree of alignment of the openings.<br>
10<br>
As mentioned above, the valve stem is connected to an actuator. The actuator rotates the valve stem to set the alignment of the openings in the valve and pusher plates in response to input from the control system. It should be remembered that the suspension itself moves up and down in relation to the<br>
15 vehicle body, with the body remaining essentially motionless and level. The goal of providing the air spring and the shock absorber in the present configuration is to damp the upward and downward motion of each wheel, independent of all other wheels. Thus, closing the openings between the plates to retard fluid flow and restrict movement of the plates within the canister damps downward motion<br>
20 of the wheel in the following manner when the pusher plate and valve plate alignment stops fluid flow, the plates push on the captured volume of fluid, pushing on the bottom of the container, thus resisting the force of the spring and the force of gravity on the wheel assembly.<br>
25 The damping action of the shock absorber can be quickly optimized to best handle the particular features of the roadway surface, with shallow depressions invoking lesser responses in the damping action, and 'chuckholes invoking complete stoppering. Unlike the requirement of a two-axle vehicle to be supported at all times at all four ends of the two axles, the invented multi-axle<br>
30 suspension allows one wheel temporarily to not support its full share of the vehicle weight, and the vehicle remains stably supported by the remaining wheels. An important difference between the current shock absorber and other active shock absorbers is that the action of transiently holding a wheel back from full contact with the road involves the resistance of the full force of the<br>
35    compressed spring.<br>
RIDE BUMPER<br>
As shown in Figure 10, a ride bumper 1003 is provided that sits between the vehicle body and the axle during normal operation. The bumper is provided to<br>
-17-<br><br>
maintain the axle at its required height in the event that the height adjuster fails. Also, the bumper can reduce wear on the height adjuster by supporting the axle at times when the height adjuster is unnecessary.<br>
CONTROL<br>
Control of the height adjuster, the air spring and the active shock absorber is through a hierarchy of sensors with operator inputs involved only at the highest and lowest level. The active shock absorber activates via the computerized suspension control in response to a combination of information regarding rapid vertical acceleration of a wheel, rapid change of the vertical force on a wheel, and information from a road contour sensor. An optional operator input can alert the computerized suspension to an approaching road surface imperfection.<br>
STEERING<br>
As mentioned earlier, it is necessary for urban transit vehicles to be easily<br>
maneuvered in a variety of restrictive settings: heavy urban traffic, narrow<br>
residential streets, and sharp corners requiring a narrow turning radius. For this	<br>
reason, the invented vehicle is equipped with an all-wheel steering system that provides several steering modes. All-wheel steering allows the "vehicle an exceptionally small turning radius relative to the vehicle size renderina it hiqhly maneuverable in the restrictive environments likely to be encountered in urban settings. In addition, as shown in Figures 13a and 13b, other steering modes are provided: crab mode (Fig. 13a) and pivot mode (Fig. 13b). Crab mode is particularly useful for maneuvering the vehicle into and out of tight parking spaces and moving flush to a curb, a frequent maneuver for transit buses. While crab mode requires that the several wheels of the vehicle be controlled in unison, the invention allows individual control of each wheel or each pair of wheels, thus permitting a pivot mode, extremely useful for turning especially tight comers or for turning the vehicle completely around in extremely confined spaces.<br>
As described further below, multiple vehicles can be coupled to form trains, requiring a "rail" steering (Fig. 13c) mode in which successive units in the train tread in the same path as the first unit.<br>
Figure 14 illustrates schematically the components of the vehicle's all-wheel steering system. Similar to the suspension, there are wheel components, power sources, cabling, sensors, control elements, and and operator interface:<br>
-18-<br><br>
o	Wheel components 1401: steering actuator and linkages, shown in greater<br>
detail in Figure 18, required suspension, mechanical support, control arms,<br>
body/frame attachments, bearings/bushings, steering sensors;<br>
o	Sources for actuating forces 1403: hydraulic, pneumatic and electrical;<br>
o	cabling 1402;<br>
o	road contour sensor 1404;<br>
o	controller 1405<br>
o	a transducer for steering control inputs;<br>
o	an operator interface 1406; and<br>
o	a display.<br>
The first axle of the vehicle may also be controlled mechanically through the operator interface.<br>
Figure 15 provides an illustration of the vehicle's steering control interface. While steering could easily be controlled by way of a device such as a joystick, or even a computer pointing device such as a mouse, the preferred embodiment of the invention incorporates steering control functions into a modified steering column to minimize needs for special operator training. The simple interface allows the operator to engage different steering modes such as crab motion or tilting through simple manipulation of the wheel, without removing hands from the wheel to actuate switches or other controls. As Figure 15 shows, 'pivot mode' is selected by pulling up on the wheel and turning in the appropriate direction. 'Crab mode' is selected by pushing down and turning. Turning is achieved in the conventional fashion, simply by turning the wheel in the desired direction. The height adjusters, for raising and lowering either side of the vehicle, are actuated using 'lean left' and 'lean right.' The 'feel' of the control is speed sensitive: turn, pivot and crab input forces stiffen with increasing speed, and the lean response increases with speed. The operator pitch input coordinates with the road contour sensor: the suspension controller can be set to anticipate road contours; 'up/down front and 'up/down rear' anticipate entering humps and dips; and the control computer is informed by inputs from the actual suspension experience, the road contour sensor, and operator input. Control of individual axles or individual wheels is mediated through hydraulic or electric steering control actuators 1801 (Figure 18) attached to each axle or each wheel.<br>
As shown in Figure 16, the steering system includes a transducer to translate input from the operator interface to the signals required by the steering actuators. The transducer includes top 1603 and bottom halves 1604 (Fig. 6A) that move<br>
-19-<br><br>
relative to each other. Steering mode selection pins 1602 are selectively engaged to set the steering mode. As  shown in Figure 16b, the central pin is engaged, allowing the  top  and   bottom halves to twist relative to each other about the center pin, corresponding to 'pivot' mode. When none of the pins are engaged, corresponding to 'crab' mode, the top half moves sideways relative to   the bottom  half.  To steer from  the  front, the operator engages the bottom pin, so that the top half  of  the   transducer moves freely at the top. To steer the rear of the vehicle, the top pin is likewise  engaged.   Pushing the  halves together evenly lowers suspension height, while drawing them   apart   raises  the  suspension.   Either  side of the vehicle may be raised and lowered by applying uneven force to erther side of the transducer. Vehicle pitch is adjusted   by twisting   the top half of the transducer around a transverse axis relative to the bottom half. Roll is adjusted by twisting the top half of the transducer around a longitudinal axis relative to the bottom half   A transmitter  1603  emits  a  signal  that  drives the steering actuators through the mediation of the controller and the signal processor.<br>
Figure   17   provides  a   schematic  diagram  that   illustrates the manner in  which the operator interface is coupled to the transducer. The operator interface, in this case a steering wheel 1701 is coupled to the steering control transducer 1702 by means of a reduction gear  1704   and an arm 1703.   The reduction gearing allows the steering wheel to retain the conventional feel of turning a steering wheel, shortening training times and facilitating acceptance of the vehicle by operators.<br>
DRIVE SYSTEM<br>
As previously described, the vehicle derives its motive force from a hybrid power system that includes electric drive motors, translating members, a power plant for generating the electricity to drive the motors, and storage batteries.<br>
-20-<br><br>
ELECTRIC DRIVE MOTOR AND DRIVE SHAFT<br>
White the preferred embodiment of the invention employs separate wheel motors for each wheel, as described below, an embodiment incorporating a continuous axle has a single drive motor for each axle, as described immediately hereafter.<br>
The vehicle's drive system includes a high-efficiency electric motor 1803 mounted on each axle, as shown in Figure 18. Use of high-efficiency drive motors allows the contribution to overall  vehicle weight by the motors to be<br>
-20A-<br><br>
minimized, while maximizing energy efficiency. A differential allows the motor to be run at its most efficient speed while allowing different rotation speeds for the wheels. Additionally, each drive motor 1802 requires a drive motor controller 1803, essentially a collection of very large power transistors that drive each winding on the motor, each controller driven by control software and further provided with diagnostic software. As shown in Figure 18, the controller is mounted on the axle adjacent the drive motor.<br>
DRIVE SHAFT<br>
It will be remembered that the preferred embodiment of the invention utilizes wheelmotors, a separate one for each wheel, with the axle being integrated into the motor. Accordingly, the preferred embodiment has no need of a drive shaft. However, alternate embodiments employing a continuous axle require a drive shaft as described below. <br>
Power is transmitted to the wheels from the differential through a drive shaft. The drive shaft includes two shafts coming out of either side of the differential, each connected to a CV joint, which is, in turn, connected to a half shaft that is connected to the respective wheel through another CV joint<br><br>
POWER PLANT<br>
The major components of the vehicle's power plant 1900 are shown in Figure 19. The entire system is mounted in the rear section of the vehicle. The power system includes:<br>
o	an engine (1901) - The engine is the basic power source for the vehicle. The<br>
current embodiment of the invention includes an internal combustion engine.<br>
The vehicle preferably uses an environmentally friendly fuel such as natural<br>
gas or liquid propane. However, due to the high fuel economy ot the vehicle<br>
owing  in  part  to  the  hybrid-electric power  system,   even   an   internal<br>
combustion engine employing conventional petroleum fuels such as gasoline<br>
or Diesel fuel greatly minimizes the deleterious environmental effects caused<br>
by fuel emissions. Moreover, embodiments of the invention powered by<br>
alternative energy sources such as fuel cells or hydrogen are also possible;<br>
o	a fuel tank (1904);<br>
o	a generator (1902): power from the engine is converted to electricity via the<br>
generator. The generator is attached directly to the engine's drive shaft;<br>
-21-<br><br><br>
o	a generator controller (1903): the generator requires a control element to<br>
capture generated electricity properly and to control battery charging in concert<br>
with a corresponding controller in each battery pack;<br>
o	a cooling system for the engine (1908);<br>
o	a hydraulic unit (1906): a hydraulic pump and controller are connected directly<br>
to the drive shaft of the engine. This unit provides hydraulic power, at least for<br>
the height adjuster system, the steering and braking systems;<br>
o	a pneumatic unit (1909): an air compressor and controller are connected<br>
directly to the drive shaft of the engine. This unit provides compressed air, at<br>
least for the air spring system, and to a pneumatically powered height<br>
adjuster as an alternative to the hydraulic power system for the height adjuster<br>
system, and other ancillary vehicle subsystems.<br>
o	an engine box (1907); and<br>
o	a climate control unit for passenger areas (1905).<br>
BATTERY PACKS<br>
The power system requires a number of storage batteries positioned at regular intervals about the vehicle; in the preferred embodiment of the invention the battery packs are situated over the axles (i.e., in the body between pairs of opposing wheels on opposing sides of the vehicle), including the first and last axles. Figure 20 shows a battery pack 2000 having a number of batteries 2001. Four batteries are shown in Figure 20; however, this is merely for the sake of illustration. The actual number of batteries may vary according to battery capacity and vehicle power requirements. The batteries generate a significant amount of heat, requiring the provision of an inlet vent 2004 in the battery pack housing 2002 to cool the batteries. Because the batteries may create fumes that are potentially hazardous, the battery pack is vented to the outside environment by means of one or more outlet vents 2003. Each battery pack also contains an electronic controller that controls charging, monitors health of the battery pack, and communicates with the generator controller.<br>
-22-<br><br><br>
SYSTEM COMMAND &amp; CONTROL COMPUTER<br>
As previously mentioned, control of many of the vehicle's systems is processor-mediated: the suspension, the all-wheel steering system, and the hybrid power system. In some cases, control is by means of local controllers, the power plant for example. Some of the vehicle systems may accept a variety of inputs. The vehicle includes other control systems not previously described:<br>
o	a door system controller;<br>
o	a fare system;<br>
o	a security system;<br>
o	a climate control system; and<br>
o	a communication system.<br>
Thus, a central command and control system is required to control and mediate the interaction of the various system controllers.<br>
COUPLING SEVERAL VEHICLES TO FORM TRAINS<br>
As Figure 21 shows, several vehicles may be combined to form trains 2100. The train is made possible by the vehicle's control system, including controls for steering, suspension, propulsion, and passenger needs. Requiring primarily linkage of the control systems of individual units into coordinated units of a train (and not links to provide inter-unit towing or mechanical guiding forces), buses may be linked and de-linked very rapidly. The bus train provides the advantage of carrying as much passenger traffic as a train of light rail vehicles without requiring the infrastructure scale of a light rail system. The bus train requires essentially no infrastructure other than passable roadways such as principal streets or boulevards in major urban areas, i.e., roadways that lack extremely tight turns. A train of these bus units may pass wherever a single unit can since the vehicle's steering control allows successive units in a train to tread in the same track as the first unit over the road. A bus train is driven by one driver, thus, a single driver can transport at several times the number of passengers as in a single vehicle, enabling a significant reduction in labor cost.<br>
For operation as part of a train, the steering systems of successive units are set in 'rail mode,' (Fig. 13c) in which the wheels behave as if they were on rails, treading in the same path on the roadway as those of the first unit, instead of cutting 1301, as conventional trailing wheels do. The additional data required by the steering control system to operate in 'rail mode' are relatively minor - the distance from the first axle of the first unit to the first axle in the second unit, and so forth. In 'cattle car' mode,.common in current mass transit vehicles, multiple doors make it possible<br>
-23-<br><br>
to accommodate approximately 20 passengers per door, at least for short distances, or 80 passengers per 4-compartment bus and 240 passengers per 3-unit traia For high volume routes having straight streets, 5-unit trains are practical.<br>
