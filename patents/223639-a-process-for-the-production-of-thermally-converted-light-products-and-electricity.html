The present invention relates to a process for the production of thermally converted light products from residual feedstock and electricity from syngas obtained from thermal conversion residue. The process according to the present invention relates in particular to an integrated process for the production of thermally converted lights products from residual feedstock and electricity from syngas obtained from thermal conversion residue which as such is available from the thermal conversion of residual feedstock into light products.<br>
Thermal cracking is widely seen as one of the oldest and well-established processes in conventional refining. The object in conventional refining is to convert a hydrocarbonaceous feedstock into one or more useful products. Depending on feedstock availability and the desired product slate, many hydrocarbon conversion processes have been developed over time. Some processes are non-catalytic such as visbreaking and thermal cracking, .others like fluidised catalytic cracking (FCC), hydrocracking and reforming are examples of catalytic processes. The processes referred to herein above have in common that they are geared, and often optimised, to producing transportation fuels such as gasoline and gas oils.<br>
Thermal conversion processes are well known in industry. In particular the Shell Soaker Visbreaking Process is well known and practised since many years in many refineries all over the world. For instance, in EP-B-7656 a process for the continuous thermal cracking of hydrocarbon oils is described, which has been<br><br>
incorporated herein by way of reference. In this document reference is made to the use of soaker vessels^ in particular to soaker vessels containing one or more * internals. Preferred configurations comprise up to 20 plates, preferably perforated plates containing round holes having a diameter in the range from 5 to 200 mm. Residence times for the feedstock are suitably in the range from 5 to 60 minutes. Such processes can be carried out upflow or downflow; very good results are normally obtained when operating in upflow mode.<br>
In modern refineries there is a tendency to produce electricity for captive use, or, if appropriate, also for export. Gas turbines are well known units to provide for electricity. Such machines generally consist of an air compressor, one or more combustion chambers in which gas or liquid fuel is burnt under pressure and a turbine in which the hot gases under pressure are expanded to atmospheric pressure. Since the high temperatures of the combustion gases produced would result in serious damage to the turbine blades if they were directed exposed thereto, the combustion gases are normally cooled to an acceptable temperature by mixing them with a large amount of excess air delivered by the compressor. About 65% of the total available power is consumed by the compressor, leaving 35% as useable power, A slight decrease in compressor efficiency reduces the amount of useful power, and, consequently, the overall efficiency considerable. By compressing the air in two stages with an intercooler in between increases the thermal efficiency of the gas turbine. So, the fuel availability is aji important factor in optimising -any gas turbine efficiency.<br>
An additional constraint to be taken into account with respect to the use of gas turbines lies in the impracticability of using low-grade heavy fuels as feedstocks for gas turbines since turbine parts are<br><br>
easily corroded (even irrespective of the high temperature constraints described herein before) and fouled by sulphur compounds or ash (in particular vanadium compounds) and a very short life between overhauls can then be expected. Gaseous fuels or high-grade distillates seem to be the only practical fuels when continuous operation is necessary.<br>
It is understandable that many efforts have already been devoted -to the integration of various refinery operations in order to save costs. This has also been proposed for thermal conversion technology and electricity generation. Reference is made to the recent publication by F.A.M- Schrijvers, P.J.W.M. van den Bosch and B.A. Douwes in Proceedings NPRA, March 1999, San Antonio. In this publication, entitled "Thermal Conversion Technology in Modern Power Integrated Refinery Schemes" it is explained in detail how to integrate a so-called Thermal Gasoil unit with a gas turbine. One of the interesting aspects of such an integration is the use of a heat recovery unit downstream of the gas turbine which allows replacement of the conventional direct fired heater and soaker as well as the recycle heater for distillate.<br>
Although this approach has important advantages compared with the use of conventional equipment, in ■particular because of the very low average and peak heat fluxes obtainable, it has no impact on the product slate of the thermal cracking operation in which still a large amount of residual material, usually referred to as vacuum flashed cracked residue (VFCR) is produced. Typically a Thermal Gasoil unit will produce between 4 5 and 65%, especially about 55%, by weight on feed of VFCR.<br>
It would be desirable to use the residual material produced as feedstock for the gas turbine present in the integrated refinery operation. However, there are at<br><br>
least two major problems which prevent the direct use of VFCR as feedstock for the gas turbine. Firstly, VFCR type materials, like any heavy residue, are rich in unwanted sulphur compounds (which have, in essence, accumulated therein when compared v;ith the initial feedstocks) which render them impracticable for duty as gas turbine feed as described herein above. Secondly, in an integrated operation only a very small fraction of the VFCR material produced would be needed (assuming that it did not have other constraints) to run the gas turbine, e.g, in the order of 2-5% by weight on feed which means that the vast majority of residual material would not be required for this duty thus causing a serious mismatch between the two operations to be integrated.<br>
In view of the above it will be clear that there is an ongoing need not only to improve refinery operations from a product point of view but also from an energy integration point of view and, if possible also with optimal use of by-products and/or bottom streams from an economic point of view.<br>
A method has now been found which allows real integration of a thermal conversion process and a gas turbine delivering electricity by using at least part of the residual material obtained, which as such is unsuitable for duty in a gas turbine, to operate a gasification unit which provides syngas which at least in part: can be used directly for duty in the gas turbine thereby maintaining the advantages of the heat recovery system as described herein above whilst producing electricity, and, optionally additional syngas at the same time.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a process for the production of thermally converted light products from residual feedstock and electricity from syngas obtained from, thermal conversion residue, in which<br><br>
process flue gas exiting from the electricity producinq unit is fed through a heat recovery unit providing at least part of the hsat required in the thermal conversion process,<br>
The process according to the present invention relates in particular to an integrated process in which the thermal conversion residue used as feedstock for the production of syngas is obtained at least partially, buc preferably in toto, from the residual feedstock producing thermally converted light products.<br>
In addition to the residence time of ^the feed to be cracked (as described herein above with reference to the Shell Soaker Visbreaking Process), the temperature is an important process variable in thermal cracking. The desirable effect of thermal cracking, i.e. the decrease of molecular weight and viscosity of the feed, arises from the fact that the larger molecules have a higher cracking rate than.the smaller molecules. It is known from Sachanen, Conversion of Petroleum, 1948, Chapter 3, that at lower temperatures the difference in cracking rates between larger and smaller molecules increases and, hence, the resultant desirable effect will be greater. At very low temperatures the cracking rate decreases to uneconomically small values. To achieve best results the temperature in the conversion zone is suitably in the range of from 400 to 650 °C, preferably in the range between 400 to 550 'C, in particular in the range between 420 and 525 ^C.<br>
The residence time of the oil to be .cracked is also influenced by the pressure. Cracking at high pressures will lead to a lower vapour hold-up in the reaction zone thereby increasing the residence time. Cracking at low pressures has a decreasing effect on the residence time of the liquid feed. Suitable pressures are in the range<br><br>
between 2 and 100 bar, preferably in the range betv;een 2 and 65 bar.<br>
The conversion level in the thermal conversion process may be each conversion level which is desired by the overall process. Suitably the conversion to light products boiling below 165 °C may be as low as 2 %mass based on the mass of the feed, or as high as 70 %mass. The conversion is suitably between 5 and 50 %mass based on the mass of the feed, preferably between 10 and 30 %mass,-more preferably about 20 %mass.<br>
Suitable residual feedstocks are heavy hydrocarbonaceous feedstocks having a minimum boiling point of 320 °C, especially a minimum boiling point of 350 ""C, comprising at least 25% by weight of 520 °C+ hydrocarbons (i.e, hydrocarbons having a final boiling point above 520 ""C), preferably more than 40% by weight of 520 °C-f hydrocarbons, and even more preferably more than 75% by weight of 520 °C+ hydrocarbons. Feedstocks comprising more than 90% by weight of 520 °C+ hydrocarbons are most advantageously used. Suitable feedstocks thus include atmospheric residues and vacuum residues. If desired., the residual hydrocarbon oil may be blended with a heavy distillate fraction, such as e.g, a cycle oil obtained by catalytic cracking of a hydrocarbon oil fraction, or with a heavy hydrocarbon oil obtained by extr-action from a residual hydrocarbon oil.<br>
As regards the production of electricity, it is well known that electricity (as main product and in many cases as the only product) can be produced from a variety of organic feedstocks, ranging from coal and natural gas to oil or residual materials. When using such feedstocks, the aim is at producing electricity as efficiently as possible and hydrocarbonaceous products will not be produced. As described herein above, there are serious constraints when trying to use heavy, sulphur-containing<br><br>
feedstocks directly for duty in a gas turbine. There is no raethod available for direct conversion of a 'cheap dirty calorie' into a 'clean calorie'. Therefore, at least part of the residual material obtained in the thermal conversion step is to be used as feedstock in a gasification process to put the balance right.<br>
In a gasification process, a hydrocarbonaceous material (ranging from natural gas to coal) is oxidised^ in essence, to produce syngas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) which as such can serve as feedstock for many processes. As oxygen source air can be used, although it is preferred to use oxygen enriched air, and even more preferred to use pure oxygen, in view of the higher caloric value per volume unit of the synthesis gas prepared. One outlet for syngas is in processes which need hydrogen as (only) feedstock such as hydrogenation processes or fuel cells which also deliver electricity but which require the absence of carbon monoxide as it acts as a poison to the electrodes necessary in the operation of the fuel cell. When electricity is to be produced by gas turbines, syngas is a preferred feedstock and gasification of residual materials is a very good process to obtain syngas of sufficient quality for this purpose. The process conditions for gasification of residual materials are well known to those skilled in the art. The main steps in the gasification of residual materials are the gasification proper using air as the oxidant followed by cooling of the raw gaseous product, suitably by producing steam when water cooling is applied, a water wash of the cooled syngas product which separates soot from the syngas product and optionally a desulphurisation step to remove gaseous sulphur compounds present in the syngas product.<br>
Having produced electricity from at least part of the syngas provided, e.g. by means of a gas turbine, flue gas<br><br>
vjill exit from the electricity producing unit. Since the flue gas has a considerable intrinsic heat it is useful to recover as much  as possible from the flue gas prior to its release to the environment as process off gas v;hich will at least in part be used to provide at least part of the heat required in the thermal conversion process.<br>
It has been found that heat recoverable from the gas turbine exit can be used advantageously in the integrated thermal conve'rsion/gasification process to heat up the feedstock to be used in the thermal conversion process^ even to the extent that the direct heater and the soaker as well as the recycle heater for distillate conversion can be replaced by a heat recovery unit. Since the residue left over after the thermal conversion process is used at least in part and preferably in toto as feedstock for the gasification process to produce syngas a sophisticated heat integration can be achieved. By using a heat recovery unit as envisaged in the process according to the present invention rather than conventionally fired heaters in the thermal conversion process it has become possible to achieve very low average and peak heat fluxes which substantially increase the run lengths normally applicable in thermal conversion units.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the heat recovery unit comprises two recovery banks in series with duct burners installed for the distillate and residue stage sections. These banks are suitably high level heat recovery units for respectively the distillate stage and the residue stage. Optionally, a third heat recovery bank can be present in the heat recovery unit which is suitably a low level heat recovery unit capable of producing medium pressure or superheated steam.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the process according to the present invention at least 50% and preferably at<br><br>
least 90% of the heat required to sustain the thermal conversion is produced by means of the heat recovery unit. This heat is recovered in a heat recovery unit downstream of the gas turbine producing electricity.<br>
The process accoidiT\g to tVife present invention will<br>
now be illustra_ted by means of the following non limiting<br>
Figures tf the acctfflpanying drawings.<br>
In Figure 1 the integrated line-up for a heat recovery unit, thermal conversion unit, gasification unit and electricity producing unit is depicterd.<br>
In Figure 2 a further integrated process line-up-is depicted in which part of the produced thermally converted product is subjected to a vacuum flasher to produce more converted product and vacuum residue serving as feedstock for the gasification unit, whilst vacuum flashed material is returned to the combi-tower after transfer through the heat recovery unit.<br>
In Figure 3 a preferred .embodiment is depicted of the heat recovery unit which contains three conversion banks to recover high and low level heat.<br>
In Figure 1 a residual feedstock is sent via line 1 through heat recovery unit 30 which serves to heat the incoming feedstock thereby allowing some conversion to take place leading to thermally converted light products. The heat necessary to achieve this is provided via line 9. The partially converted feedstock is sent via line 2 to the remainder of the thermal conversion unit 35 (e.g. a soaker or a combi-tower) for further conversion. Depending on the heat supplied in unit 30 it is possible to omit use of unit 35, (i.e. all conve.rsion takes place during the transfer of the residual feedstock through the heat recovery unit 30) .<br>
Thermally converted light products are removed via line 3 (or line 2 in case of total conversion) and subjected to further treatment ?uch as distillation (not<br><br>
shcv;n) as appropriate. Therrrial residue is sent via line 4 (in the event that unit 35 is used) or as bottciri stream from the further processing unit (not shown) to gasification unit 40 which serves to convert thermal residue with the use of air, introduced via line 5 into syngas v;hich is sent via line 6,   optionally after removing some of it via line 7 for further uses (not shovm) to electricity producing unit 50 (suitably a gas turbine).<br>
Electricity produced in unit 50 is sent to the grid via line 8 and flue gas exiting the electxicity producing unit 50 is sent via line 9 to the heat recovery unit 30 to serve as heating medium for the incoming residual feedstock 1. Off gas from the heat recovery unit 30 is released via line 10. If desired;- (make-up) thermal conversion residue and/or any other gasifiable material may be sent to gasification unit 4 0 in addition to residue provided via line 4 (not shown).<br>
In Figure 2 a residual feedstock is sent via line 1 through heat recovery unit 30 which serves in part to heat the incoming feedstock thereby allowing some" conversion to take place leading to thermally converted light products. The partially converted feedstock is sent via line 12 to cyclone 60 to allow for separation of heavy material via the bottom of the cyclone which material is sent via lines 14, 19, 20 to vacuum flasher 80. The bulk of the partially converted feedstock is sent via line 13 to combi-tower 70 serving to allow further conversion of (partially converted) residual feedstock as well as allowing separation into a number of products.<br>
Gaseous material is removed from combi-tower 70 via line 15, gasoline via line 16, gas oil via line 17 and optionally a heavy fraction having a boiling range above that of gas oil and not being the bottom stream (which is<br><br>
sent via line 19, together with stream 14 to vacuur:. flasher 80) via line 18. The bottom stream is sent via lines 19 and 20 to vacuum flasher 80 in which it is separated in a waxy distillate which is recycled, optionally together with the heavy fraction recovered via line 18 to coitibi-tower 70 via lines 23 and 24 after having passed the heat recovery unit 30 in order to make use of available heat in that unit, thereby allowing some conversion to take place leading to thermally converted light products. The recycle stream 24 enters the combi-tower at a height above the bottom and below the draw off point of the heavy fraction via line 18.<br>
The vacuum residue is sent via line 22 to gasification unit 40 which serves to convert vacuum residue with the use of air, introduced via line 5, into syngas which is sent via line 6, optionally after removing some of it via line 7 for further uses (not shown) to electricity producing unit 50 (preferably a gas turbine) .<br>
Electricity produced in unit 50 is sent to the grid via line 8 and flue gas exiting the electricity producing unit 50 is sent via line 9 to heat recovery unit 30 to serve as heating medium for both the incoming thermal, residue feedstock to be converted and the waxy distillate to be recycled via lines 21 and 23, optionally together with the heavy fraction recovered from the combi-tower via line 18. Off gas froin the heat recovery unit 30 is released via line 10. If desired,- (make-up) thermal conversion residue and/or any other gasifiable material may be sent to gasification unit 40 in addition to vacuum residue provided via line 22 (not shown).<br>
In Figure 3 a heat recovery unit to be used in the process according to the present invention is shown schematically. It is described herein below using the reference numerals as given in the description of<br><br>
Figure 2 as appropriate. The heat retovery unit 30 contains three heat recovery banks serving to supply neat to the incoming residual feedstock via line 1 which is leaving via line 12; to the recycle stream 23 to the combi-tower 70 (not shown) which stream is leaving the unit 30 via line 24, and to a medium pressure steam coil indicated by 25. The first two banks provide high level heat which heats up and partially converts the streams coming in via lines 1 and 23 and the third bank provide low level heat to produce steam via steam coil 25.<br>
The present invention also relates t6 an integrated system for producing thermally converted light products and electricity comprising a thermal conversion unit to produce thermally converted light products, a gasification unit to produce syngas as feedstock for the production of electricity from thermal residue, an electricity producing unit using syngas as feedstock and a heat recovery unit which is capable of recovering heat from flue gas exiting the electricity producing unit, which heat is available for at least part of the thermal conversion process. Preferably, the heat recovery unit contains three recovery banks, two capable of providing high level heat for the partial conversion of residual feedstock and vacuum residue produced during the conversion process, and a low level recovery bank capable of producing medium pressure steam.<br><br><br><br>
