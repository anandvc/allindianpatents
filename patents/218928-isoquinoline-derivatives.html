Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics.The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes (A. W. Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1988,85,4934-4938) and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain (A.M. Cesura and A. Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 1992, 38, 171-297). Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging (C.J. Fowler et al., /. Neural Transm. 1980,49,1-20). Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (P. Dostert et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989,38, 555-561) and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques (Saura et al., Neuroscience 1994, 70, 755-774). In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NH3, aldehydes and H2O2, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopaminergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO activity and consequent increased formation of H2O2 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibitors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br><br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for example discussed by D. Bentue-Ferrer et al. in CNS Drugs 1996,5,217-236. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications (D. M. Gardner et al., /. Clin. Psychiatry 1996,57,99-104), these adverse events are of less concern with reversible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme.<br>

Also preferred are compounds of formula I, wherein R4 or R5 is C1-C6-alkyl. Especially preferred are those compounds, wherein R4 or R5 is methyl.<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1     is hydrogen; or is a group of formula<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Preferred compounds of formula I-B are those, wherein R' is a group of formula a and R3 is -(CH2)„-C0-NR6R7 -(CH2)n-COOR8 -CHR'-COOR8 -(CH2)n-CN, -(CH2)„-CF3, -(CH2)p-OR8 or -(CH2)n-tetrahydrofuranyl; and wherein R6 and R7 are independently from each other hydrogen or Ci-Ce-alkyl, R8is hydrogen or C1-C6-alkyl, n is 0,1 or 2 and p is 1 or 2.

The following are examples of such compounds: 2-[6-(3-fluoro-ben2yloxy)-3,4-dihydro-lH-isoquinolin-2-yl]-propionamide, 2-[6-(4-fluoro-benzyloxy)-3,4-dihydro-lH-isoquinolin-2-yl]-acetamide,<br><br><br><br><br>
More preferred are compounds of formula I-C, wherein R^ is a group of formula a and R^ is -(CH2)„-C0-NRV; -(CH2)„-C00R^ -(CH2)n-CN or -(CH2)P-OR^ and wherein R^ and R^ are independently from each other hydrogen or Ci-Cg-alkyl, R is hydrogen or Ci-Cg-allcyl, n is 0,1 or 2 and p is 1 or 2.

Examples therefore are the following compounds: 2-(R)- [6-(4-fluoro-benzyloxy)-1,3-dioxo-3,4-dihydro- lH-isoquinolin-2-yl] -propionamide, and<br>
2-{S)-[6-(4-fluoro-benzyloxy)-l,3-dioxo-3,4-dihydro-lH-isoquinolin-2-yl]-propionamide.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, compounds of general formula I-A can be manufactured by refluxing in hydrobromic acid 48% a derivative of formula X to afford compounds of type II. The 6-benzyloxy -3&gt;4-dihydro-2H-isoquinolin-l-one derivative of formula I-Ai, wherein R1 is hydrogen, is obtained by coupling with the appropriate benzylic bromide III in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate. The reaction is preferably carried out a temperature of 90 °C in a solvent like N,N'-dimethylformamide. Treatment with sodium hydride and an electrophile of formula iV in a solvent like N,N'-dimethyl-formamide affords compounds of formula I-A2 (scheme 1).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, compounds of general formula I-A2 can be manufactured by esterification of the 3-hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid XV with methanol and sulfuric acid and ether formation with the appropiate benzyl bromide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate. Regioselective iodination with iodine in acetic acid and reagents like silver acetate and reduction of the ester to the aldehyde with for example diisobutylaluminum hydride (DIBAH) leads to compounds of formula Xa. Reductive amination with the corresponding (X-aminoamide in a solvent like methanol and in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride gives the necessary intermediate Xlla for the carbonylation. The carbonylation-cyciization reaction is preferably carried out at I    about 106 °C in a solvent like ethylacetate in the presence of a base like triethylamine or sodium acetate and a Pd catalyst like bis( triphenylphosphine) palladium II chloride to afford compounds of formula I-A2 (scheme 7).<br>
Scheme 7<br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula I-Bi, wherein R1 is hydrogen can be manufactured by treating a derivative of formula I-A1 with lithium aluminium hydride to afford compounds of type I-B. The 6-ben2yloxy-3,4-dihydro-lH-isoquinoline derivative of formula I-B1, wherein R1 is hydrogen, is treated with sodium hydride and an electrophile of formula IV in a solvent like dimethylformamide to afford compounds of formula I-B2 (scheme 10):<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula I-C can be prepared by starting from a 1,3-isochromanone derivative of formula V. Scheme 12 describes the synthesis of a compound of formula V from an acid of formula IXX.<br><br>
The 6-benzyIoxy-l,3-isochromandione derivative of formula VI is then prepared by coupling with the appropriate benzylic bromide III in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate. Compounds of formula 1-C can be obtained by reacting a compound of formula VI with an amine of formula VII (or its hydrochloride salt) under basic conditions or heating in an appropriate solvent (scheme 13).<br><br><br>
Compounds of formula I-C1, can be prepared via saponification of the 5-(4-fluoro-benzylox7)-2-iodo-phenyl]-acetic acid methyl ester XVIII (see scheme 7) to the corresponding acid. The acid is activated with l,r-carbonyl-diimidazoIe (GDI) in N,N'-dimethylformamide (DMF) and the corresponding a-aminoamide is added. When the hydrochloride salt of the a-aminoamide is used one equivalent of a base like pyridine needs to be added to the reaction mixture. The compound XXVII obtained, is the adequate for a carbonylation-cydization reaction that is preferably carried out at a temperature of 106 °C in a solvent like ethylacetate in the presence of a base like triethylamine or sodium acetate and a Pd catalyst like bis( triphenylphosphine) palladium II chloride (scheme 14).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Yet another method of preparing compounds of formula 1-D is shovm in scheme 18. The 5-hydroxy-l-indanone was alkylated with the appropiate ben2yl bromide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate. The 5-benzyloxy-2-oximinoindan-l-one XXXIX was obtained by a modification of a reported procedure (Chakravarti and Swaminathan, J. Ind. Chem. Soc, 1934,11, 101) using isoamyl nitrite in methyl cellosolve and HCl. The diacid was obtained by refluxing the isonitroso compound with toluene-p-sulfonyl chloride and sodium hydroxide, addition of more sodium hydroxide and prolongated time of reactions gave directly the hydrolysis of the intermediate nitrile formed in the course of the reaction. Refluxing of the diacid with acetyl chloride gives the benzylic homophthalic anhydride VI. A suspension in absolute methanol was refluxed for 2 hours to get the regioselective formation of the desired mono-methyl ester XXXXI. Reduction of the acid to the alcohol with borane-dimethylsulfide complex in a solvent like THF and the alcohol oxidation with Mn02 in CHCI3 or preferably using Swern conditions gives the aldehyde XXXXII that is necessary for the reductive amination with the corresponding a-aminoamide in a solvent like methanol and in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride in order to get the precursor XXXXIII for the final cyclization step. The cylization can be obtained by heating XXXXIII in toluene and preferably with an Deam-stark in order to remove the methanol formed in the reaction (scheme 18)<br><br><br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease. Other indications include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indications maybe reward deficiency syndrome (G.M. Sullivan, International patent application No. WO 01/34172 A2), peripheral neuropathy caused by cancer chemotherapy (G. Bobotas, International Patent Application No. WO 97/33572 Al), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (R.Y. Harris, International patent application No. WO 96/40095 A1) and other neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially usefiil for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNA's encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by E.-J. Schlaeger and K. Christensen (Transient Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Grown in Serum-ft"ee Suspension Culture; Cytotechnology, 15:1-13,1998). After transfection, cells were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by<br><br>
centrifligation at 45,000 xgand, after two rinsing step with 20 mM ins rtU butter, phi 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, membranes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80 °C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectrophotometric assay adapted from the method described by M. Zhou and N. Panchuk-Voloshina (A One-Step Fluorometric Method for the Continuous Measurement of Monoamine Oxidase Activity, Analytical Biochemistry, 253:169-174, 1997). Briefly,'membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C wath or without various concentrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the IvlAO substrate tyramine together with 1 U/ml horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 μ M N-acetlyd-3,7,-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were ftirther incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 \d and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 nM clorgyline for MAO-A or 10 μ M L-deprenyl for MAO-B.<br>
IC50 values, that is, the concentration of a test compound of formula I required to inhibit the MAO-B enzyme activity by 50%, were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 10 μ M or less, typically of 1 μ M or less, ideally 0.03 μ M or less, and more preferably 0.1μ iM or less.<br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenteraliy, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within vnde limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br><br>
The following examples are provided for illustration of the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative thereof.<br>

It has now been found that the compounds of general formula I are selective monoamine oxidase B inhibitors.<br>
Monoamine oxidase (MAO, EC 1.4.3.4) is a flavin-containing enzyme responsible for the oxidative deamination of endogenous monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine, serotonin, adrenaline, or noradrenaline, and trace amines, e.g. phenylethyl-amine, as well as a number of amine xenobiotics.The enzyme exists in two forms, MAO-A and MAO-B, encoded by different genes (A. W. Bach et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1988,85,4934-4938) and differing in tissue distribution, structure and substrate specificity. MAO-A has higher affinity for serotonin, octopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline; whereas the natural substrates for MAO-B are phenylethylamine and tyramine. Dopamine is thought to be oxidised by both isoforms. MAO-B is widely distributed in several organs including brain (A.M. Cesura and A. Pletscher, Prog. Drug Research 1992, 38, 171-297). Brain MAO-B activity appears to increase with age. This increase has been attributed to the gliosis associated with aging (C.J. Fowler et al., /. Neural Transm. 1980,49,1-20). Additionally, MAO-B activity is significantly higher in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease (P. Dostert et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989,38, 555-561) and it has been found to be highly expressed in astrocytes around senile plaques (Saura et al., Neuroscience 1994, 70, 755-774). In this context, since oxidative deamination of primary monoamines by MAO produces NH3, aldehydes and H2O2, agents with established or potential toxicity, it is suggested that there is a rationale for the use of selective MAO-B inhibitors for the treatment of dementia and Parkinson's disease. Inhibition of MAO-B causes a reduction in the enzymatic inactivation of dopamine and thus prolongation of the availability of the neurotransmitter in dopaminergic neurons. The degeneration processes associated with age and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases may also be attributed to oxidative stress due to increased MAO activit)’ and consequent increased formation of H2O2 by MAO-B. Therefore, MAO-B inhibitors may act by both reducing the formation of oxygen radicals and elevating the levels of monoamines in the brain.<br><br>
Given the implication of MAO-B in the neurological disorders mentioned above, there is considerable interest to obtain potent and selective inhibitors that would permit control over this enzymatic activity. The pharmacology of some known MAO-B inhibitors is for example discussed by D. Bentue-Ferrer et al. in CNS Drugs 1996,5,217-236. Whereas a major limitation of irreversible and non-selective MAO inhibitor activity is the need to observe dietary precautions due to the risk of inducing a hypertensive crisis when dietary tyramine is ingested, as well as the potential for interactions with other medications (D. M. Gardner et al., /. Clin. Psychiatry 1996,57,99-104), these adverse events are of less concern with reversible and selective MAO inhibitors, in particular of MAO-B. Thus, there is a need for MAO-B inhibitors with a high selectivity and without the adverse side-effects typical of irreversible MAO inhibitors with low selectivity for the enzyme.<br>

Yet another method of preparing compounds of formula 1-D is shown in scheme 18. The 5-hydroxy-l-indanone was alkylated with the appropiate ben2yl bromide in the presence of a base like potassium carbonate. The 5-benzyloxy-2-oximinoindan-l-one XXXIX was obtained by a modification of a reported procedure (Chakravarti and Swaminathan, J. Ind. Chem. Soc, 1934,11, 101) using isoamyl nitrite in methyl cellosolve and HCl. The diacid was obtained by refluxing the isonitroso compound with toluene-p-sulfonyl chloride and sodium hydroxide, addition of more sodium hydroxide and prolongated time of reactions gave directly the hydrolysis of the intermediate nitrile formed in the course of the reaction. Refluxing of the diacid vsdth acetyl chloride gives the ben2ylic homophthalic anhydride VI. A suspension in absolute methanol was refluxed for 2 hours to get the regioselective formation of the desired mono-methyl ester XXXXI. Reduction of the acid to the alcohol with borane-dimethylsulfide complex in a solvent like THF and the alcohol oxidation with Mn02 in CHCI3 or preferably using Swern conditions gives the aldehyde XXXXII that is necessary for the reductive amination with the corresponding a-aminoamide in a solvent like methanol and in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride in order to get the precursor XXXXIII for the final cyclization step. The cylization can be obtained by heating XXXXIII in toluene and preferably with an Deam-stark in order to remove the methanol formed in the reaction (scheme 18)<br>

Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of formula I can be manufactured readily according to methods known per se and taking into consideration the nature of the compound to be converted into a salt. Inorganic or organic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid or citric acid, formic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, acetic acid, succinic acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, p-toluenesulphonic acid and the like are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of formula I. Compounds which contain the alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, for example sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or the like, basic amines or basic amino acids are suitable for the formation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts of acidic compounds.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are, as already mentioned above, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors and can be used for the treatment or prevention of diseases in which MAO-B inhibitors might be beneficial. These include acute and chronic neurological disorders, cognitive disorders and memory deficits. Treatable neurological disorders are for instance traumatic or chronic degenerative processes of the nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, other types of dementia, minimal cognitive impairment or Parkinson's disease. Other indications include psychiatric diseases such as depression, anxiety, panic attack, social phobia, schizophrenia, eating and metabolic disorders such as obesity as well as the prevention and treatment of withdrawal syndromes induced by abuse of alcohol, nicotine and other addictive drugs. Other treatable indications maybe reward deficiency syndrome (G.M. Sullivan, International patent application No. WO 01/34172 A2), peripheral neuropathy caused by cancer chemotherapy (G. Bobotas, International Patent Application No. WO 97/33572 Al), or the treatment of multiple sclerosis (R.Y. Harris, International patent application No. WO 96/40095 Al) and other neuroinflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are especially usefiil for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease and senile dementia.<br>
The pharmacological activity of the compounds was tested using the following method:<br>
The cDNA's encoding human MAO-A and MAO-B were transiently transfected into EBNA cells using the procedure described by E.-J. Schlaeger and K. Christensen (Transient Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells Grown in Serum-ft"ee Suspension Culture; Cytotechnology, 15:1-13,1998). After transfection, cells were homogenised by means of a Polytron homogenizer in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA and 0.5 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Cell membranes were obtained by<br><br>
centrifiigation at 45,000 xgand, after two rinsing step with 20 mM ins rtU butter, phi 8.0, containing 0.5 mM EGTA, membranes were eventually re-suspended in the above buffer and aliquots stored at -80 °C until use.<br>
MAO-A and MAO-B enzymatic activity was assayed in 96-well-plates using a spectrophotometric assay adapted from the method described by M. Zhou and N. Panchuk-Voloshina (A One-Step Fluorometric Method for the Continuous Measurement of Monoamine Oxidase Activity, Analytical Biochemistry, 253:169-174, 1997). Briefly,'membrane aliquots were incubated in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 37 °C vath or without various concentrations of the compounds. After this period, the enzymatic reaction was started by the addition of the 2vlA0 substrate tyramine together with 1 U/nnl horse-radish peroxidase (Roche Biochemicals) and 80 |iM N-acet)d-3,7,-dihydroxyphenoxazine (Amplex Red, Molecular Probes). The samples were further incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 200 \d and absorbance was then determined at a wavelength of 570 nm using a SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices). Background (non-specific) absorbance was determined in the presence of 10 nM clorgyline for MAO-A or 10 ‘iM L-deprenyl for MAO-B.<br>
ICso values, that is, the concentration of a test compound of formula I required to inhibit the MAO-B enzyme activity by 50%, were determined from inhibition curves obtained using nine inhibitor concentrations in duplicate, by fitting data to a four parameter logistic equation using a computer program.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are specific MAO-B inhibitors. The IC50 values of compounds of formula I as measured in the assay described above are in the range of 10 ‘iM or less, typically of 1 [iM or less, ideally 0.03 ‘iM or less, and more preferably 0.1 \iM or less.<br>

The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered orally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions. However, the administration can also be effected rectally, e.g. in the form of suppositories, or parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, inorganic or organic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-soUd and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active substance no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar, glucose and the like. Adjuvants, such as alcohols, polyols, glycerol, vegetable oils and the like, can be used for aqueous injection solutions of water-soluble salts of compounds of formula I, but as a rule are not necessary. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>
In addition, the pharmaceutical preparations can contain preservatives, solubilizers, stabilizers, wetting agents, emulsifiers, sweeteners, colorants, flavorants, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffers, masking agents or antioxidants. They may also contain other therapeutically valuable substances.<br>
As mentioned earlier, medicaments containing a compound of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and a therapeutically inert excipient are also an object of the present invention, as is a process for the production of such medicaments which comprises bringing one or more compounds of formula I or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof and, if desired, one or more other therapeutically valuable substances into a galenical dosage form together with one or more therapeutically inert carriers.<br>
The dosage can vary within vnde limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, the effective dosage for oral or parenteral administration is between 0.01-20 mg/kg/day, with a dosage of 0.1-10 mg/ kg/day being preferred for all of the indications described. The daily dosage for an adult human being weighing 70 kg accordingly lies between 0.7-1400 mg per day, preferably between 7 and 700 mg per day.<br><br>
The following examples are provided for illustration of the invention. They should not be considered as limiting the scope of the invention, but merely as being representative thereof.<br>
