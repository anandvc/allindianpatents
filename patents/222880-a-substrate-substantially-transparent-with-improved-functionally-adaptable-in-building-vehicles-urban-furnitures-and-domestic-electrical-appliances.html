				<td>SUBSTRATE WITH A SELF-CLEANING COATING<br>
The invention relates to various types of material that may be found in<br>
buildings, vehicles, urban furniture or in domestic electrical appliances, namely<br>
in particular:<br>
transparent substrates, made of glass or polymer, intended to serve as<br>
glazing, for example as a display screen;<br>
ceramic or glass-ceramic substrates that can be used for example in<br>
domestic electrical appliances;<br>
architectural materials, such as roof tiles, floor tiles, stone, cementitious<br>
compositions and metal surfaces; and<br>
fibrous mineral materials, such as glass insulation wool or textile glass<br>
yarns, that can be used as filtration material, for making false ceilings, etc.<br>
Recent studies have been carried out for the purpose of trying to improve<br>
the comfort of these materials when in use, especially to make them easier to<br>
clean, and two broad approaches have been studied in order to give these<br>
materials such a functionality.<br>
According to a first approach, functional coatings having the feature of<br>
being highly hydrophilic have been studied and developed. This is especially the<br>
case for coatings based on silicon oxide or oxycarbide that can be deposited on<br>
glazing according to the teaching of patent WO 01/32578. This type of coating<br>
has a pronounced antisoiling effect with respect to dust, most particularly with<br>
respect to mineral dust: simply running water over the surface of such a coating,<br>
which is highly "wetting", allows the dust to be carried away. Such running<br>
water may be natural (rain) if the substrate is used outdoors and exposed<br>
appropriately. It may also be induced: this becomes a washing operation, but<br>
one that is very easy since there is no need to rub the substrate nor is there any<br>
need to use detergents. The substrates thus treated become soiled to a lesser<br>
extent and less quickly. It is thus possible to space out more conventional<br>
washing operations with detergents (especially as regards windows). However,<br>
this hydrophilic coating has a less pronounced effect with regard to organic dust<br>
(for example that from motor vehicle exhaust gas residues, various hydrocarbon<br>
residues in the vicinity of airports, or more simply fingerprints). Such organic<br>
soiling tends to accumulate on the surface of the coating, progressively<br>
reducing, at least locally, its hydrophilicity. Its fouling delay function is<br>
therefore real, but could be improved depending on the type of soiling<br>
encountered and on the type of pollution to which the substrate is exposed.<br>
According to a second approach, functional coatings having<br>
photocatalytic properties have been developed. These are especially coatings<br>
comprising TiO2 at least partially crystallized especially in the anatase form,<br>
which have for example been described in patents WO 97/10185, WO 97/10186,<br>
WO 99/44954 and WO 01/66271. This type of semiconducting material, based on<br>
an optionally doped metal oxide (there are also other oxides that can be<br>
photocatalytic, such as ZnO, etc), is capable through the effect of radiation of<br>
suitable wavelength, of initiating radical reactions that cause organic compounds<br>
to oxidize: this type of coating, when sufficiently exposed to ad hoc radiation<br>
(generally ultraviolet, and possibly visible range), is therefore very effective for<br>
degrading organic soiling. Furthermore, it has been discovered that, especially<br>
when the coatings are based on titanium oxide, they also exhibit a certain<br>
hydrophilicity when exposed for a sufficiently long time to said radiation. This<br>
coating is therefore very effective in that it can degrade organic soiling and,<br>
through its hydrophilicity, remove mineral soiling. However, its activity is<br>
dependent on its exposure (for a long enough time) to radiation (of sufficient<br>
intensity) of ad hoc wavelength. The behavior of this type of coating therefore<br>
depends strongly on the environmental conditions in the case of outdoor<br>
exposure, especially the sunshine and rain conditions. Likewise, in the absence<br>
of suitable illumination, its activity at night tends to be less than its activity<br>
during the day.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to further improve the<br>
functionality imparted by these various types of "self-cleaning" or "fouling<br>
delay" coatings. The invention is aimed in particular at obtaining coatings that<br>
can be of enhanced efficiency and can be more "multipurpose" with regard to<br>
various aspects: firstly with regard to soiling of different chemical nature and<br>
then with regard to varied environmental conditions when the substrate is used<br>
outdoors. The object of the invention is more particularly to obtain coatings that<br>
can, even under mediocre irradiation conditions, and even at night, exhibit a<br>
certain antisoiling activity.<br>
The subject of the invention is firstly a substrate that may essentially be<br>
transparent, especially one based on glass or one or more polymers, or may be<br>
made of a ceramic or glass-ceramic, or may even be an architectural material<br>
(of the type comprising a wall render, a concrete slab or block, architectural<br>
concrete, roof tile, material of cementitious composition, terracotta, slate,<br>
stone, or may even be a fibrous substrate, based on glass of the mineral<br>
insulation wool type, or glass reinforcement yarns). This substrate is<br>
characterized in that it is provided on at least part of its surface with a first<br>
coating comprising a layer or several stacked layers preferably based on an at<br>
least partly oxidized derivative of silicon, chosen from silicon dioxide,<br>
substoichiometric silicon oxides and silicon oxycarbide, silicon oxynitride or<br>
silicon oxycarbonitride. This first coating is chosen so as to exhibit hydrophilicity<br>
and is surmounted by a second coating chosen so as to exhibit photocatalytic<br>
properties. This second coating preferably comprises at least partly crystallized<br>
titanium oxide, especially in anatase form. This second coating has a<br>
discontinuous/permeable structure. These terms are understood to mean that<br>
the second coating is sufficiently porous and sufficiently "noncovering" to allow<br>
access to a certain portion of the external surface of the subjacent first coating.<br>
It is advantageous to choose a distribution of the second (photocatalytic) coating<br>
on the first (hydrophilic) coating that is "regular", or as regular as possible, on<br>
the scale of 1 mm2 or 1 cm2 of substrate, and to have approximately the same<br>
amount and/or the same thickness of the second coating, which is preferably<br>
distributed approximately in the same way on this scale. Further details will be<br>
given later as regards the way in which the second coating is distributed on the<br>
first and how the structure of the second coating thus permits the subjacent<br>
coating to come into contact with the external atmosphere, but two cumulative<br>
or alternative situations are especially possible, namely the second coating may<br>
be chosen to have a thinness such that it is in fact in the form of islands<br>
distributed more or less randomly on the surface of the subjacent first coating.<br>
It may also have a porous structure, and an at least partly open porosity, that<br>
lets the water from the ambient atmosphere reach the first coating. Preferably,<br>
as regards the first coating and the second, the thicknesses remain within the<br>
interferential thickness range, for example of the order of at most one hundred<br>
nanometers in the case of the first coating. Especially in the case of coatings<br>
suitable for transparent substrates of the glazing type, these very small<br>
thicknesses guarantee that, even if the second coating is in fact only a collection<br>
of more or less separate islands, there is no inhomogeneity in the optical<br>
properties associated with the discontinuity of the second coating, especially no<br>
iridescence.<br>
It has therefore been discovered in the invention that there is a very<br>
considerable synergy between the two coatings with complementary properties:<br>
the hydrophilic first coating is effective more for mineral-type soiling, whatever<br>
the irradiation conditions. It can be active through the effect of rain or by water<br>
spray. The second coating is effective for organic soiling and even mineral soiling<br>
when it has a degree of hydrophilicity, its effectiveness being dependent on the<br>
conditions of exposure to the appropriate radiation (for most of the time<br>
ultraviolet and/or visible radiation). It is furthermore designed to leave (at least<br>
partly) the first, subjacent coating its antisoiling property, allowing water to<br>
pass through it (and the dust to be carried away therewith). Furthermore, the at<br>
least partly preserved hydrophilicity of the first coating retains its antifogging<br>
and anticondensation effects, which are also highly appreciated.<br>
This double coating is straightaway very multipurpose: in the presence of<br>
irradiation, the effectiveness in delaying fouling is very high, making use of the<br>
complementary properties of the two coatings. Even in the case of low<br>
irradiation (or at night), a certain effectiveness is retained, at least as regards<br>
mineral soiling, either thanks to natural rain or more simply by water spray. The<br>
subjacent (hydrophilic) first coating thus makes it possible to readily remove<br>
mineral soiling which is undesirable, as it is unattractive and also because its<br>
accumulation could end up deactivating/passivating the photocatalytic<br>
properties of the photocatalytic second coating. It is therefore truly a<br>
combination of effects that gives excellent results, whereas it might be<br>
expected that the photocatalytic second coating, owing to its<br>
discontinuous/porous character, would add nothing or almost nothing in terms of<br>
antisoiling properties to the subjacent hydrophilic coating, or, worse still, would<br>
remove the subjacent hydrophilic coating of its antisoiling, antifogging and<br>
anticondensation properties.<br>
Advantageously, the substrate according to the invention is essentially<br>
transparent, flat or curved, of the glazing type, impressed or not, as it is in this<br>
type of application that the accumulation of soiling that prevents visibility is the<br>
most irksome and that washing operations are really necessary in order to<br>
guarantee their transparency.<br>
Preferably, the first coating of hydrophilic character may be of the type<br>
described in the aforementioned patent WO 01/32578. Advantageously, it has a<br>
refractive index of between 1.45 and 1.80, especially between 1.50 and 1.75,<br>
for example between 1.55 and 1.68. Such a relatively low index, on a<br>
transparent substrate of the glass type, makes it possible to prevent a reflecting<br>
effect that may be deemed unattractive.<br>
This coating therefore advantageously comprises Si, 0, and possibly<br>
carbon and nitrogen. However, it may also include materials in a minor<br>
proportion compared with silicon, for example metals such as Al, Zn or Zr. This<br>
coating may be deposited by sol-gel or by pyrolysis, especially by CVD (chemical<br>
vapor deposition). The latter technique can be used to obtain SiOxCy or SiO2<br>
coatings quite easily, especially by deposition directly on the ribbon of float<br>
glass in the case of glass substrates. However, it is also possible to deposit such<br>
a coating by a vacuum technique, for example sputtering using an Si (optionally<br>
doped) target or a silicon suboxide target (for example in an oxidizing and/or<br>
nitriding reactive atmosphere).<br>
This first coating preferably has a thickness of at least 5 nm, especially a<br>
thickness between 10 and200 nm, for example between30 and120 nm.<br>
To enhance its hydrophilicity, it has been shown that it is advantageous<br>
for this coating to have a certain roughness. This may especially take the form of<br>
nanoscale protuberances and/or indentations. They may more particularly be<br>
protuberances, at least some of which are not touching: it is thus possible to<br>
have a coating whose external face has a relatively smooth profile from which<br>
emerge protuberances that may be overlapping or touching, but at least some of<br>
which are discrete. Such surface structuring is achieved most particularly with<br>
coatings obtained by pyrolysis. In general it is also possible using this type of<br>
technique to obtain quite dense coatings that adhere strongly to the carrier<br>
substrate, and are therefore durable, to the benefit of the invention of course.<br>
These protuberances/indentations vary in size, for example with a<br>
diameter distribution between 5 and 300 nm, especially 50 and 100 nm. The<br>
term "diameter" is understood here in the broad sense, by likening these<br>
protuberances/indentations to solid hemispheres (protuberances) or<br>
hemispherical voids (indentations). It goes without saying that this is an average<br>
size and that protuberances/indentations of more random shape, for example<br>
more elongated, are included.<br>
These protuberances and/or indentations may also have a height (in the<br>
case of protuberances) or a depth (in the case of indentations) of between 5 and<br>
100 nm, especially between 10 and 50 nm. This gives an indication of the<br>
maximum value for each protuberance/indentation whose size it is desired to<br>
determine.<br>
One way of measuring these dimensions consists in carrying out<br>
measurements based on photographs taken by scanning electron microscopy<br>
(SEM).<br>
Such photographs can also be used to determine the distribution of these<br>
indentations/protuberances per unit area of the substrate. It is thus possible to<br>
have a number of protuberances/indentations for this first coating of between5<br>
and300 per µm2, especially between20 and 200 per µm2, of coated substrate.<br>
One way of measuring these hydrophilicity-enhancing<br>
protuberances/indentations consists in measuring the rms roughness expressed<br>
in nm. This first coating may thus have an rms roughness of between 4 and<br>
12 nm, especially between 5 and 10 nm, and more particularly between 6 and<br>
9 nm.<br>
The second coating, that exhibiting photocatalytic properties, is<br>
preferably thin, that is to say it has a thickness of at most 10 nm, especially a<br>
thickness of at most 8 or 5 or 3 nm, in the regions where it actually overlaps the<br>
first coating. In fact, it may be so thin as to tend toward the detection limits of<br>
the machines normally used to evaluate interferential layer thicknesses. As<br>
mentioned above, the term "coating" is to be taken in its broadest sense insofar<br>
as this coating may be discontinuous, in the form of at least partly discrete<br>
islands, or so porous as to be considered as discontinuous. It is in fact just this<br>
point that is surprising in the invention, that such a coating, despite its very<br>
"tenuous" character, does provide a certain functionality.<br>
Its presence may, perhaps more justifiably, be quantified not so much by<br>
a thickness value but by the amount of material deposited per unit area of<br>
substrate (any discontinuity in the coating is thus taken into account). In the<br>
case here, this amount may advantageously be at most 10 micrograms per cm2,<br>
especially at most 5 or 3 micrograms per cm2. It is preferable for this to be<br>
within the range from about 0.5 to 3 micrograms per cm2, i.e. really very small<br>
amounts (compared with the amount of material per cm2 provided, for example,<br>
by an SiOC-based hydrophilic first coating with a thickness of around fifty<br>
nanometers, which is already about 10 micrograms per cm2 of substrate for an<br>
SiOC material, albeit less dense than bulk TiO2).<br>
Advantageously, this second coating will therefore be able to let the first<br>
coating "breathe" and allow at least part of the antisoiling activity associated<br>
with its hydrophilicity, that it would have in its absence, to be retained.<br>
The second coating is preferably deposited by sol-gel, or by CVD-type<br>
pyrolysis or by a vacuum technique of the sputtering type.<br>
From an industrial standpoint, it is most beneficial to produce this double<br>
coating continuously, by depositing the first coating and then the second by<br>
chemical vapor deposition on a ribbon of float glass, for example, when glass<br>
substrates are involved.<br>
Advantageously, the second coating is essentially based on optionally<br>
doped titanium oxide, consisting of grains or crystallites with a diameter of<br>
between 0.5 and 100 nm, especially between 2 and20 nm. Here again the term<br>
"diameter" is to be taken in the broad sense - it is more a determination of the<br>
size of the crystallites. The shape of the grains may approach that of a sphere or<br>
have an elongate shape of the rice grain type, or have a completely random<br>
shape. These grains/crystallites may be at least partly touching. They may also<br>
exhibit some cohesion owing to amorphous oxide that will incorporate/bind<br>
these crystallized grains.<br>
Preferably, the ratio of the diameter of the protuberances on the external<br>
surface of the first (hydrophilic) coating to that of the grains or crystallites of<br>
the second (photocatalytic) coating is at least 2, especially at least 4, 5 or even<br>
at least 10.<br>
Advantageously, the second coating will "follow" the roughness of the<br>
first, if there is any roughness, and even sometimes enhance it. Thus, the rms<br>
surface roughness in nm of the substrate coated with the hydrophilic first<br>
coating and with the photocatalytic second coating will be between 4 and<br>
15 nm, especially between 5 and 12 nm, more particularly between 7 and 10 nm.<br>
Taking an embodiment described above in which the external surface of<br>
the first coating is provided with indentations/protuberances and in which the<br>
second coating comprises grains/crystallites, these grains/crystallites may be<br>
placed between these indentations/protuberances and optionally cover, at least<br>
partly, these indentations/protuberances.<br>
Advantageously, the transparent, especially glass, substrate of the glazing<br>
type, which is provided with the double coating according to the invention, has a<br>
light reflection RL on the coating(s) side of at most 12%, especially at most11%,<br>
under illuminant D65. This thus amounts to a coating of very low reflectivity that<br>
therefore does not penalize the substrate optically, which remains quite<br>
"neutral" optically. Its colorimetric response in reflection may be very slight,<br>
and in neutral colors fairly perceptible (or almost imperceptible) to the eye, and<br>
preferably in the green-blues. This colorimetric response may for example be<br>
quantified by a* and b* values in the (L,a*,b*) colorimetry system, in which<br>
preferably b* is of negative sign. Preferably b* and a* are negative. In absolute<br>
values, a* and b* are preferably less than 5 or 4 or 3.<br>
Advantageously, the combination of the first and second coatings has a<br>
photocatalytic activity characterized by a rate of degradation of palmitic acid of<br>
at least 5 nm/h, especially at least 10 nm/h when exposed to appropriate<br>
radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation. The conditions for the test measuring<br>
this rate of degradation will be explained in detail during the subsequent<br>
description of the examples.<br>
Also advantageously, the combination of the two coatings exhibits<br>
hydrophilicity characterized by a water contact angle of at most 10° or 5°, with<br>
or without exposure to radiation in the ultraviolet or the visible.<br>
The subject of the invention is also the application of the substrates<br>
according to the invention, especially those that are essentially transparent, to<br>
the manufacture of "self-cleaning" glazing that can provide, simultaneously,<br>
antisoiling, antifogging and anticondensation behavior. This may be glazing for<br>
buildings of the double-glazing type, vehicle windows of the windshield, rear<br>
window, sunroof, side window or rear-window type. They may also be windows<br>
for trains, aircraft and ships. It may also be utilitarian glazing, such as aquarium<br>
glass, shop window glass or greenhouse glass, or else glazing used in interior<br>
furnishings or in urban furniture. It may also be glazing used as display screens of<br>
the television, computer or telephone screen type. This type of coating may also<br>
be applied to electrically controllable glazing, such as wire-type or layer-type<br>
heated windows, electrochromic glazing, glazing incorporating a liquid-crystal<br>
film, electroluminescent glazing or photovoltaic glazing.<br>
The substrate according to the invention, apart from its application as<br>
glazing, may be made of any architectural material that can be used for<br>
manufacturing partitions, wall claddings, roofing, flooring, either indoors or<br>
outdoors (metal, wood, stone, cement, concrete, terracotta, ceramic, wall<br>
render, etc.).<br>
The substrate, if instead based on a mineral fibrous material (glass, rock,<br>
silica, etc.), may serve as filtration material or else may be used for false<br>
ceilings, which are not easy to clean.<br>
The invention will be described below with the aid of nonlimiting<br>
examples and figures 1 to 3. All the figures are SEM micrographs of the<br>
examples. In all the examples, the substrate 1 is a silica-soda-lime clear glass<br>
4 mm in thickness (of the type of glass sold by Saint-Gobain Glass France under<br>
the name SGG Planilux).<br>
Example 1<br>
This example relates to the deposition, on the glass 1 again in the form of<br>
a ribbon of float glass, of a first coating 2 based on silicon oxycarbide, denoted<br>
for convenience by SiOC (without prejudging the actual amount of oxygen and<br>
carbon in the coating). This coating 2 was deposited by CVD using Si precursors,<br>
in particular using an SiH4/ethylene mixture diluted in nitrogen, with the aid of a<br>
nozzle placed above and transversely to the ribbon float glass 1 of a flat glass<br>
production line, in the float chamber, when the glass was still at a temperature<br>
of about 600 to 700°C. The coating obtained had a thickness of about 50 nm and<br>
a refractive index of about 1.55. Still on the float line in the float chamber, and<br>
at the same glass temperature, the titanium-oxide-based coating 3 was<br>
deposited, by means of a second nozzle, using titanium isopropylate diluted in<br>
nitrogen. This coating was very thin, probably "noncovering" with respect to the<br>
subjacent coating. Its thickness was determined to be less than 5 nm,<br>
corresponding to an amount of TiO2 of the order of 1 microgram per cm of<br>
substrate. The photographs shown in figures 1a, 1b and 1c relate to this example<br>
1, once the glass ribbon had been cut from the float line: they show, on two<br>
different scales, seen from above and, in the case of figure 1c, obliquely, the<br>
coating 2 that was seeded with pseudo-circular protuberances 4 in the plane of<br>
section, and having a diameter of about 30 to 70 nm. They also show traces of<br>
the coating 3, in the form of grains 5 much smaller in size than the<br>
protuberances 4. These grains lie between the protuberances 4 and perhaps also<br>
at least on these protuberances, but this is difficult to confirm just from these<br>
micrographs. These grains have a size of around 2 to 10 nm.<br>
The glass 1 was then subjected to two series of tests, one a natural aging<br>
test and the other an accelerated aging test.<br>
- Natural aging:<br>
The glass 1 provided with a double coating was exposed on the outside for 6<br>
months at the Charles de Gaulle airport near Paris, so as to be inclined and in<br>
direct contact with rain and sunshine. This is because the environment of an<br>
airport is a very good test environment as it is a highly polluted atmosphere,<br>
especially polluted with higher hydrocarbon contents in the air than elsewhere.<br>
After 6 months, it was found that the glass retained a clean and wetting<br>
appearance: the glass treated according to the invention therefore has actual<br>
"self-cleaning" properties, even under environmental conditions that are neither<br>
very sunny nor very rainy, as encountered in the Paris region. It is therefore<br>
capable of ridding itself of organic soiling, even with a very thin if not<br>
discontinuous photocatalytic coating 3. In addition, it remains hydrophilic. For<br>
comparison, the uncoated glass of untreated SGG Planilux type, subjected to<br>
exactly the same environmental conditions, loses its wetting character after 15<br>
days of exposure, with visible traces of droplets and dust.<br>
- Accelerated aging:<br>
The photocatalytic activity of the treated glass according to example 1<br>
was firstly measured by what is called the palmitic acid test. This test consists in<br>
depositing, on 15 cm2 of the surface of the treated glass, by spraying, a palmitic<br>
acid solution (8 grams of acid per 1 l of chloroform) with a glass/spray distance<br>
of 20 cm, on a vertical substrate in 3 to 4 successive passes. Next, the glass is<br>
weighed in order to determine the thickness in nanometers of palmitic acid<br>
deposited (by weighing the glass specimen before deposition of the palmitic<br>
acid). The glass was then exposed to UVA with an intensity of about 30 W/m2.<br>
The photocatalytic activity was then calculated as the rate of disappearance<br>
v (in nm/h) of palmitic acid, this rate being defined as follows:<br>
v(nm/h) = palmitic acid thickness (nm) / (2 x t ½ disappearance (h)).<br>
The value v for the treated surface of the treated glass was initially about<br>
10 nm/h. Its water contact angle was 5 - this surface was therefore strongly<br>
hydrophilic and also photocatalytic.<br>
• Variable environment test<br>
This test was carried out according to the NF P 78 451 standard. It<br>
involves subjecting the glass to 4 cycles per 24 hours, with hold periods of 2<br>
hours at 55°C and 95% relative humidity, then 1 hour at -15°C, with transitions<br>
lasting 1 hour 30 minutes. The water contact angle was measured every 10 days<br>
as follows: the glass was exposed for 20 minutes to UV and then stored in the<br>
dark for 72 hours. The measurement was then carried out, this being an average<br>
of three measurements on three different drops.<br>
After 10 days of testing, the water contact angle, which was 5° initially,<br>
increased to 10°. Then, after 20 days, the water contact angle dropped to 5°.<br>
This 5° value then remained approximately constant for up to 55 days. These<br>
measurements therefore merely prove that the hydrophilicity of the treated<br>
glass is indeed preserved over time, this hydrophilicity probably being a<br>
combination of the hydrophilicity of the first and of the second coating.<br>
• High humidity test<br>
This test was carried out according to the EN 1096-2 standard. It involves<br>
subjecting the glass to a temperature of 40°C in a chamber saturated with<br>
moisture, with a relative humidity of greater than 95%, with water having a<br>
conductivity of less than 30 µS and a pH of greater than 5 running over the<br>
treated face of the glass. The treated glass having undergone this test was then<br>
exposed for 10 and 20 days to UV and then stored for 72 hours in the dark, as in<br>
the previous test. The water contact angle measurement was also an average of<br>
three measurements. After 10 days, the water contact angle was 10° and after<br>
20 days it had dropped back down to 5°.<br>
• Neutral salt fog test<br>
This test was carried out according to the EN 1036 standard. It involves<br>
placing the glass in a chamber at 35°C with a fine spray of hot (35°C) neutral<br>
(5% NaCl in water) brine, the treated surface being exposed to this fog. The<br>
water contact angle of the treated surface was again measured under the same<br>
conditions as the previous two tests. The contact angle remained at 5° for 55<br>
days.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example is similar to example 1, but the coating 3 was "thicker", by<br>
sputtering a larger amount of titanium oxide precursor: in the case of<br>
example 2, the amount of TiO2 deposited on the coating 2 was about 2.3<br>
micrograms per cm2 of substrate. The SEM photographs of figures 2a, 2b and 2c<br>
show the treated surface seen from above and obliquely, on two different<br>
scales: they show a structure similar to that of example 1. The initial<br>
photocatalytic activity of the treated surface was 20 nm/h and its initial water<br>
contact angle was 5°. After 15 days of the variable environmental test, the<br>
water contact angle was 10°. It was even 18° after 15 days of high-humidity<br>
testing (same conditions as in example 1). Everything occurs as if the presence in<br>
larger quantity of the photocatalytic TiO2 increases the photocatalytic activity of<br>
the coating by a factor of 2, but there should be a reason (not yet explained)<br>
why the hydrophilicity decreases slightly after accelerated environmental aging.<br>
However, it should be noted that a hydrophilic coating is still present, within the<br>
meaning of the term "hydrophilic", with a water contact angle of at most 20°<br>
after having undergone the tests.<br>
For comparison, figure 3 shows an SEM photograph seen from above of a<br>
glass coated only with the SiOC coating 2: the protuberances may again be seen,<br>
but the TiO2 grains lying between these protuberances are no longer present.<br>
