"PROCESS FOR PREPARING ARYLACETYLAMINOTHIAZOLES"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of Lawrenceville-Princeton Rd., P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of/the/<br>
invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-	<br><br><br>
The    present    invention    relates    to    a    process    for    preparing arylacetylaminothiazols.<br><br>
The present invention concerns new processes for the preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylaIkylthio)-2-arylacetylarninothiazoles and analogs,- inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.<br>
The 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-arylacerylaminothiazole compounds of formula I<br><br><br><br><br><br>
or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein:<br>
R1, R2, R4, R5, R6, R8, R9, R12 and R13 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl<br>
or heteroaryl; R3,R7,R10andR13 are each independently hydrogen, alkyl, aryl, heteroaryl,<br>
halogen, hydroxy or alkoxy; and XisCHorN,<br>
are novel, potent inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases (cdks). They are useful in the therapy of proliferative diseases, for example, cancer, inflammation, autoimmune diseases such as arthritis, viral diseases, fungal diseases, chemotherapy-induced alopecia, neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease. Vlore specifically, the compounds of formula I are useful in the treatment of a variety of ;ancers"such as bladder, breast, colon, kidney, liver and lung cancers.<br><br><br>

r<br>
The preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles, key intermediates in die synthesis of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-arylacetylaminothiazoles of formula I, has been described (K. S. Kim et al, WO 9924416, May 20, 1999 and corresponding U.S. Patent No. 6,040,321).<br>
4-Formylphenylacetic acid has been previously prepared from ethyl phenylacetate in four steps which provided 
The reaction of 4-bromophenylacetic acid or ester with alkyl acrylates using palladium catalysts to give 4-(2-alkoxycarbonylvinyl)phenylacetic acid or ester has been previously reported in the literature (J. W. Tilley et al, J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 1125; A. Cerri et al, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1993, 30, 1581). The oxidation of β-arylacrylates to give aryl aldehydes has also been reported (G. Cainelli et al, Synthesis, 1989, 47; D. G. Lee et al, Can. J. Chem. 1972, 50; D. G. Lee et al, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1993, 503; S. Antus et al, Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1993, 105).<br>
This invention concerns new efficient processes for the preparation of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-arylacetylaminothiazoles and analogs. The processes involve new strategy for the preparation of formylarylacetic acids, key intermediates in the synthesis of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-arylacetylaminothiazoles and analogs, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.<br>
The present invention relates to new, more efficient processes for the preparation of formylarylacetic acids with application to the synthesis of 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-<br><br>
LD137fPCT ,<br>
arylacetylaminothiazoles and analogs, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases. The processes involve reaction of haloarylacetic acids or esters II with olefins III to give vinylarylacetic acids or esters IV. Oxidation of IV with an oxidizing reagent gives formylarylacetic acids or esters V. Compared to the previous process which takes four steps and has yields less than 15%, the process of. the invention can obtain the formylacetic acids or esters in only two steps and at substantially higher yields.<br>
Subsequent   coupling   of  formylarylacetic   acids   or   esters   V   with   5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles VI   produces amides VII.  Reductive amination of      the      amide      VII      with      amines      affords      5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-     (aminoalkyl)arylacetylaminothiazoles I, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases.<br>
Alternatively, compounds of formula I can be prepared by coupling of haloalkylarylacetic acids VIII with 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles VI followed by aminolysis of the resulting amides IX with amines.<br>
The above-described reactions are illustrated in the below Scheme 1.  <br><br><br><br><br><br>

Methods of solvation are generally known in the art. Therefore, the compounds useful in<br>
the processes of this invention may be in the free or hydrate form.<br>
.1	As   set   forth   in   Scheme   1,   the   process   for   the   preparation   of  5-(2-<br>
oxazolylalkylthio)-2-arylacetylaminothiazoles   and   analogs   involves   the   following transformations:<br>
(a) reacting a haloarylacetate II with an olefin III in the presence of a palladium catalyst in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give a vinyl-substituted arylacetate IV       such as vinylarylacetate.<br>
It should be appreciated that the term "haloarylacetate" for purposes of the present invention includes both haloarylacetic acids and esters. Additionally, a sulfonate, for example, RSO2O- (where R is alkyl, aryl or heteroaryl), CF3SO2O- and the like, may be substituted for the halogen in the arylacetate or arylacetic acid starting compounds.       The preferred haloarylacetates are haloarylacetic acids with bromophenylacetic acids, such as, for example, 4-bromophenylacetic acid, most preferred.   The olefin includes alkenes and polymers derived from an alkene such as ethyl or methyl acrylate. The palladium catalysts include, but are not limited to, palladium acetate or diacetate, palladium halides, etc., with the palladium diacetate preferred.  Other standard catalysts       may be employed although less conveniently.  A conventional ligand for the palladium catalyst such as trialkyl or triarylphosphine can also be employed.  Suitable solvent(s) include solvents such as hydrocarbons, ethers, amides, for example, dimethylformamide ("DMF"), ketones, etc., or mixtures thereof, with amides such as DMF preferred.<br><br><br>
LD137fPCT<br>
(b) reacting the vinyl-substituted arylacetate IV, like vinylarylacetate, obtained in step (a) with an oxidizing reagent in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give a formylarylacetate V.<br>
The oxidizing reagent includes, but is not limited to, O3, KMnC&gt;4, NaI(VOs04,<br>
etc., with NalCVOsCH preferred. Suitable solvent(s) include solvents such as<br>
hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, amides, and the like, mixtures thereof, or aqueous mixtures<br>
thereof, with an ether and water mixture preferred.	—<br>
For example, the oxidative cleavage of the double bond of formula IV by a reagent such as osmium tetroxide with sodium periodate in a dioxane/water mixture gives the desired vinyl-substituted arylacetic acid or arylacetate, such as formylphenylacetic acid or formylphenylacetate.<br>
(c) reacting the formylarylacetate V obtained in step (b) with a 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazole compound VI in the presence of a coupling reagent and in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give an amide VII.<br>
The 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles include 5-(5-substituted-2-oxazolyl-alkylthio)-2-aminothiazole compounds with 5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-arnino-thiazole preferred. The coupling reagents include, but are not limited to, carbodiimides, haloformates, thionyl halide and the like, with thionyl halide preferred. Suitable solvent(s) include aprotic solvents such as hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, r etc., with halogenated hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane preferred.<br><br><br>
LD137fPCT<br>
(d) reacting the amide VII obtained in step (c) with an amine in the presence of a reducing reagent in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give 5-(2-oxazolylalkyltbio)-2-(ammoalkyl)arylacetylaminothiazole I.<br>
	The amine used in reaction (d) includes primary and secondary amines with<br>
   primary aliphatic amines preferred. The reducing reagents include, but are not limited to,<br>
NaBH4, NaBH(OAc)3, Et3SiH/TFA and the like with NaBH(OAc)3 preferred.   Suitable<br>
solvent(s) include hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons,  ethers,  esters, etc., or<br>
mixtures thereof, with ethers such as tetrahydrofuran ("THF") preferred.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula I can be prepared by:<br>
 (c1) reacting the haloalkylarylacetate VIII with a 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-<br>
aminothiazole compound VI in the presence of a coupling reagent and in a suitable solvent or solvent mixtures to give an amide IX.<br>
	The 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazoles include 5-(5-substituted-2-<br>
oxazolyl-alkylthio)-2-aminothiazole compounds with 5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylalkylthio)-<br>
2-amino-thiazole preferred. The coupling reagents include, but are not limited to,<br>
carbodiimides, haloformates, thionyl halide and the like, with the former preferred, for<br>
example, an alkylcarbodiimide. Suitable solvent(s) include aprotic solvents such as<br>
hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, etc., with halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons such as dichloromethane preferred.<br>
 For instance, treatment of haloalkylarylacetate or haloalkylarylacetic acid VIII<br>
such as haloalkylphenylacetate or haloalkylphenylacetic acid with 5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazole VI provides a haloalkyl-substituted phenylacetamide IX.<br><br><br>
LD137fPCT<br>
(d') reacting the amide IX obtained in step (c') with an amine in a suitable solvent<br>
or	solvent	mixtures	to	give	5-(2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-<br>
(arnmoalkyl)arylacetylaminothiazole I.<br>
The amine used in reaction (d') includes primary and secondary amines with primary aliphatic amines preferred. Suitable solvent(s) include hydrocarbons, halogenated hydrocarbons, ethers, esters, amides, etc., with amides such as DMF preferred:"<br>
For example, the reaction under reductive amination conditions with a primary or secondary amine in the presence of sodium cyanoborohydride or hydrogen in the       presence of a catalyst gives the compounds of formula I.<br>
Alternatively, the aldehydes of formula VII may be reacted with an organometallic reagent such as methylmagnesium bromide in a suitable solvent or solvent mixture, such as, for example, ether to give an alcohol derivative. The alcohol derivative is converted to its corresponding halide such as a chloride by a chlorinating 1(5 agent such as thionyl chloride. The halide compound such as the chloride compound may then be converted to a compound of formula I by reaction with an excess of a primary or secondary amine in a suitable solvent such as ethanol.<br>
	The starting compounds of Scheme 1 are commercially available or may be<br>
prepared by methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
 To further illustrate Scheme 1, a process to make formylphenylacetic acids with<br>
application to the synthesis of 5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylmethylthio)-2-[(aminomethyl)phenyl-acetyl]aminothiazoles and analogs thereof, for example, starts with the reaction of    halophenylacetic acids  II such  as bromophenylacetic  acid<br><br><br>
LD137f-PCT<br>
(R=R'=R2=R3=H, X=Br) with alkyl acrylate III such as ethyl acrylate (R4=Z=H, Y=C02Et)        to        give        (2-ethoxycarbonyl)vinylphenylacetic        acids        IV (R=R1=R2=R3=R4=Z=H,. Y=C02Et).  Oxidation of IV with a suitable oxidizing reagent gives formylphenylacetic acids V (R1=R2=R3=R4=H).   Coupling of V with 5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazole     VI     (R6=R7=R8=R9=R10=H,     R11=t-Bu) produces amides VII R1=R2=R3=R4 R5=R6=R7=R8 R9=R10, R11=t-Bu).     Reductive animation     of    VII     with    amines—affords     5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-(aminomethyl)phenylacetylamino-thiazoles I, inhibitors of cyclin dependent kinases. Alternatively,    compounds   of   formula   I   can   be   prepared   by   coupling   of      haloalkylphenylacetic     acids     VIII     such     as     bromomethylphenylacetic     acid (R=R1=R2=R3=R4=R5=H)   with   5-(5-t-butyl-2-oxazolylalkylthio)-2-aminothiazole   VI followed by aminolysis of the resulting amides IX with amines.<br>
The following examples demonstrate certain aspects of the present invention. However, it is to be understood that these examples are for illustration only and do not 115 purport to be wholly definitive as to conditions and scope of this invention. It should be appreciated that when typical reaction conditions (e.g., temperature, reaction times, etc.) have been given, the conditions both above and below the specified ranges can also be used, though generally less conveniently. The examples are conducted at room temperature (about 23°C to about 28°C) and at atmospheric pressure. All parts and 2p percents referred to herein are on a weight basis and all temperatures are expressed in degrees centigrade unless otherwise specified.<br>

To the reaction mixture was  added ethyl acetate (500 mL), the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate (2 x 500 mL), and the combined organic layers washed with hydrochloric acid (IN, 500 mL), water (500 mL) and saturated sodium chloride solution (250 mL), then dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and evaporated in vacuo to provide the title compound as a mixture of   and trans isomers (46.9 g, 100%).<br>
EXAMPLE 2 B.       Preparation of 4-Formylphenylacetic Acid<br><br>
To a stirred solution of the title compound of Example 1 (46.9 g, 200 mmol) in 2|) dioxane (500 mL) and water (500 mL) was added osmium tetroxide (0.5 g, 4% in water), followed by sodium periodate (85.56 g, 400 mmol). The reaction mixture was monitored by HPLC, stirred for 1 hour and N-methylmorpholine (1.0 g) was added, followed by additional osmium tetroxide (1.0 g) after another 16 hours. After 4 hours stirring at room temperature, additional sodium periodate (40 g) was added, the reaction stirred for 21 2$ hours, filtered, and the filter cake washed with ethyl acetate (500 mL). The phases were separated, the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate (500 mL), the remaining aqueous layer acidified with hydrochloric acid (30 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (500<br><br><br>
