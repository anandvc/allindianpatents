^f	flnr.i.n nir TNVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to androgen receptor targeting agents (ARTA), which demonstrate androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. The agents define a new subclass of compounds, which ore selective androgen receptor modulators (SARMs) useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM); c) treatment of conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Female (ADIF); d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing anoVor treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[O003J The androgen receptor ("AR") is a ligand-activated transcriptional regulatory protein that mediates induction of male sexual development and function through its activity with endogenous androgens. Androgens are generally known as the male sex hormones. The androgenic hormones are steroids which are produced in the body by the testes and the cortex of the adrenal gland or can be synthesized in the laboratory. Androgenic steroids play an important role in many physiologic processes, including the development and maintenance of male sexual characteristics such as muscle and bone mass, prostate growth, spermatogenesis, and the male hair partem (Matsumoto, Endocrinol. Met Clin. N. Am. 23:857-75 (1994)). The endogenous steroidal androgens<br><br>
include testosterone and dihydrotestosterone ("DHT"). Testosterone is the principal steroid secreted by the testes and is the primary circulating androgen found in the plasma of males. Testosterone is converted to DHT by the enzyme 5 alpha-reductase in many peripheral tissues. DHT is thus thought to serve as the intracellular mediator for most androgen actions (Zhou, et al., Molec. Endocrinol. 9:208-18 (1995)). Other steroidal androgens include esters of testosterone, such as the cypionatc, propionate, phenylpropiooate^ eyclopentylpjopionate, isocarporate, enantbate, and decanoate esters, and other synthetic androgens such as 7-MethyI-Nortestosterone C"MENT) and its acetate ester (Sundaram et al., "7 Alpna-Methyl-Nortestosteronfi(MENT): The Optimal Androgen For Male Contraception," Ann. Med., 25:199-205 (1993) ("Sundaram")). Because the AR is involved in male sexual development and function, the AS. is a likely target for effecting male contraception or other forms of hormone replacement therapy.<br>
[0004] Worldwide population growth and social awareness of family planning have stimulated a great deal of research in contraception. Contraception is a difficult subject under any circumstance. It is fraught with cultural and social stigma, religious implications, and, most certainly, significant health concerns. This situation is only exacerbated when the subject focuses on male contraception. Despite me availability of suitable contraceptive devices, historically, society has looked to women to be responsible for contraceptive decisions and their consequences. Although concern over sexually transmitted diseases has made men more aware of the need to develop safe and responsible sexual habits, women still often bear the brunt of contraceptive choice. Women have a number of choices, from temporary mechanical devices such as sponges and diaphragms to temporary chemical devices such as spermicides. Women also have at their disposal more permanent options, such as physical devices including IUDs and cervical caps as well as more permanent chemical treatments such as birth control pills and subcutaneous implants. However, to date, the only options available for men include the use of condoms and vasectomy. Condom use, however is not favored by many men because of the reduced sexual sensitivity, the interruption in sexual spontaneity, and the significant possibility of pregnancy caused by breakage or misuse. Vasectomies are also not favored. If more convenient methods of birth control were available to men, particularly long-term methods which require no preparative activity immediately prior<br><br>
to a sexual act, such methods could significantly increase the likelihood that men would take more responsibility for contraception.<br>
100051 Administration of the male sex steroids (e.g., testosterone and its derivatives) has shown particular promise in this regard due to the combined gonadotropin-suppressiiig and androgen-substituting properties of these compounds (Steinberger et al., "Effect of Chronic Administration of Testosterone Enanthate on Sperm Production and Plasma Testosterone, Follicle Stimulating Hormone, and Luteinizing Hormone Levels: A Preliminary Evaluation of a Possible Male Contraceptive, Fertility and Sterility 28:1320-28 (1977)). Chronic administration of high doses of testosterone completely abolishes sperm production (azoospermia) or reduces it to a very law level (oligospermia). The degree of spermatoganic suppression necessary to produce infertility is not precisely known. However, a recent report by the World Health Organization showed that weekly intramuscular injections of testosterone enanthate result in azoospermia or severe oligospermia (i.e., less than 3 million sperm per ml) and infertility in 98% of men receiving therapy (World Health Organization Task Force on Methods And Regulation of Male Fertility, "Contraceptive Efficacy of Testosterone-Induced Azoospermia and Oligospermia in Normal Men," Fertility and Sterility (55:821-29 (1996)).<br>
[0006] A variety of testosterone esters have been developed which are more slowly absorbed after intramuscular injection and thus result in greater androgenic effect Testosterone enanthate is the most widely used of these esters. While testosterone enanthate has been valuable in terms of establishing the feasibility of hormonal agents far male contraception, it has several drawbacks, including the need for weekly injections and the presence of supraphysiologic peak levels of testosterone immediately following intramuscular injection (Wu, "Effects of Testosterone Enanthate in Normal Men: Experience From a Mufticenter Contraceptive Efficacy Study," Fertility and Sterility 65:626-36 (1996)).<br>
[0QQ71 Steroidal Uganda which bind the AR and act as androgens (e.g. testosterone enanthate) or as antiandrogens (e.g. cyproterone acetate) have been known for many years and are used clinically (Wu 1988). Although nonsteroidal andaodrogens are in<br><br>
clinical use for hormone-dependent prostate cancer, nonsteroidal androgens have not been reported. For this reason, research on male contraceptives has fecused solely on steroidal compounds.<br>
[00081 Prostate cancer is one of the most frequently occurring cancers among men in the United States, with hundreds of thousands of new cases diagnosed each year. Unfortunately, over sixty percent of newly diagnosed cases of prostate cancer are found to be pathologically advanced, with no cure and a dismal prognosis, One approach to this problem is to find prostate cancer earlier through screening programs and thereby reduce the number of advanced prostate cancer patients. Another strategy, however, is to develop drugs to prevent prostate cancer. One third of all men over SO years of age have a latent form of prostate cancer that may be activated into the life-threatening clinical prostate cancer form. The frequency of latent prostatic tumors has been shown to increase substantially with each decade of life from the 50a (5.3-14%) to the 90s (40-80%). The number of people with latent prostate cancer is the same across all cultures, ethnic groups, and races, yet the frequency of clinically aggressive cancer is markedly different. This suggests that environmental factors may play a role in activating latent prostate cancer. Thus, the development of treatment and preventative strategies against prostate cancer may have the greatest overall impact both medically and economically against prostate cancer.<br>
[0009] Osteoporosis is a systemic skeletal disease, characterized by low bone mass and deterioration of bone tissue, with a consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fracture. In the U.S., the condition affects more man 25 million people and causes more than 1.3 million fractures each year, including 500,000 spine, 250,000 hip and 240,000 wrist fractures annually. Hip fractures are the most serious consequence of osteoporosis, with 5-20% of patients dying within one year, and over 50% of survivors being incapacitated. The elderly are at greatest risk of osteoporosis, and the problem is therefore predicted to increase significantly with the aging of tie population. Worldwide fracture incidence is forecasted to increase three-fold over the next 60 years, and one study estimated (hat there will be 4.5 million hip fractures worldwide in 2050,<br><br>
(00010]	Womenareat greater risk of osteoporosis than men. Women experience<br>
a sharp acceleration of bone loss during the five years following menopause. Other factors that increase the risk include smoking, alcohol abuse, a sedentary lifestyle and low calcium intake. However, osteoporosis also occurs frequently in males. It is well established that the bone mineral density of males decrease with age. Decreased amounts of bone mineral content and density correlates with decreased bone strength, and predisposes to fracture. The molecular mechanisms underlying the plciotiopic effects of sex-hormones in non-reproductive tissues are only beginning to be understood, but it is clear that physiologic concentrations of androgens and estrogens play an important role in maintaining bone homeostasis throughout the life-cycle. Consequently, when androgen or estrogen deprivation occurs there is a resultant increase in the rate of bone remodeling mat tilts the balance of resorption and formation to the favor of resorption that contributes to the overall loss of bone mass. In males, the natural decline in sex-hormones at maturity (direct decline in androgens as well as lower levels of estrogens derived from peripheral aromatization of androgens) is associated with the frailty of boacs. This effect is also observed inmates who have been castrated.<br>
[00011]	Androgen decline in tbe aging male (ADAM) refers to a progressive<br>
decrease in androgen production, common in males after middle age. The syndrome is iharacterized by alterations in the physical and intellectual domains mat correlate with ind can be corrected by manipulation of the androgen milieu. ADAM is characterized nochemicaUy by a decrease not only in serum androgen, but also in other hormones, such as growth hormone, melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone. Clinical manifestations nclude fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, lypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, benign prostate lyperplasia, anemia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer.<br>
[00012}	Androgen  Deficiency   in  Female  (ADIF)   refers   to   a   variety   of<br>
lormone-related conditions including, common in females after middle agest. The syndrome ia characterized by sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood,<br><br>
anemia, depression, anemia, hair Joss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer.<br>
[00013]	Muscle wasting refers to the progressive loss of muscle mass and/or to<br>
the progressive weakening and degeneration of muscles, including the skeletal or voluntary muscles, which control movement, caidiac muscles, which contiol the heart (cardiomyopathies), and smooth muscles. Chrome muscle wasting is a chronic condition (i.e. persisting over a long period of time) characterized by progressrve loss of muscle mass, weakening and degeneration of muscle. The loss of muscle mass that occurs during muscle wasting can be characterized by a muscle protein breakdown or degradation. Protein degradation occurs because of an unusually high rate of protein degradation, an unusually low rate of protein synthesis, or a combination of both. Protein degradation, whether caused by a high degree of protein degradation or a low degree of protein synthesis, leads to a decrease in muscle mass and to muscle wasting. Muscle wasting is associated with chronic, neurological, genetic or infectious pathologies, diseases, illnesses or conditions. These include Muscular Dystrophies such as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and Myotome Dystrophy; Muscle Atrophies such as Post-Polio Muscle Atrophy (PPMA); Cachexias such as Cardiac Cachexia, AIDS Cachexia and Cancer Cachexia, -malnutrition, Leprosy, Diabetes, Renal Disease, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Cancer, end stage Renal failure, Emphysema, Osteomalacia, HIV Infection, AIDS, and Cardiomyopathy, In addition, other circumstances and conditions are linked to and can cause muscle wasting. These include chronic lower back pain, advanced age, central nervous system (CNS) injury, peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury, chemical injury, central nervous system (CNS) damage, peripheral nerve damage, spinal cord damage, chemical damage, bums, disuse deconditioning that occurs when a limb is immobilized, long term hospitalization due to illness or injury, and alcoholism. Muscle wasting, if left unabated, can have dire health consequences. For example, the changes mat occur during muscle wasting can lead to a weakened physical state that is detrimental to an individual"s health, resulting in increased susceptibility to infection, poor performance status and susceptibility to injury.<br><br>
[00014J	New innovative approaches are urgently needed at both the basic science<br>
md clinical levels to develop compounds which an; useful for a) male contraception; b) Xeatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with ADIF, such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, sarcopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alterations in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditioas; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.<br>

Biological Activity of Selective Androgen Modulator Compounds<br>
[000100]	The compounds provided herein are compounds which are selective<br>
androgen receptor modulators (SARM) which are useful for oral testosterone replacement therapy "which have an unexpected in-vho activity for an androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor. Further, appropriately substituted compounds are effective to treat prostate cancer and useful for imaging of prostate cancer. The SARM compounds demonstrate an in-vivo androgenic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal ligand for the androgen receptor.<br>
[000101]	As contemplated herein, the appropriately substituted SARM compounds<br>
of the present invention axe useful for a) male contraception; b) treatment of a variety of hormone-related conditions, for example conditions associated with Androgen Decline in Aging Male (ADAM), such as fatigue, depression, decreased libido, sexual dysfunction, erectile dysfunction, hypogonadism, osteoporosis, hair loss, anemia, obesity, sarcopenia, osteopenia,osteoporosis, benign prostate hyperplasia, alterations in mood and cognition and prostate cancer; c) treatment of conditions associated with<br><br>
ADIF, such as sexual dysfunction, decreased sexual libido, hypogonadism, saicopenia, osteopenia, osteoporosis, alteratians in cognition and mood, depression, anemia, hair loss, obesity, endometriosis, breast cancer, uterine cancer and ovarian cancer; d) treatment and/or prevention of acute and/or chronic muscular wasting conditions; e) preventing and/or treating dry eye conditions; f) oral androgen replacement therapy; and/or g) decreasing the incidence of, halting or causing a regression of prostate cancer.<br>
[000102]	As used herein, receptors for extracellular signaling molecules are<br>
collectively referred to as "cell signaling receptors". Many cell signaling receptors are transmembrane proteins on a cell surface; when they bind an extracellular signaling molecule (i.e., a ligand), they become activated so as to generate a cascade of intracellular signals that alter the behavior of the cell. In contrast, in some cases, the receptors are inside the cell and the signaling ligand has to enter the cell to activate them; these signaling molecules therefore must be sufficiently small and hydrophobic to diffuse across the plasma membrane of the cell.<br>
[000103]	Steroid hormones are one example of small hydrophobic molecules that<br>
diffuse directly across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to intracellular cell signaling receptors. These receptors are structurally related and constitute the intracellular receptor superfamily (or steroid-hormone receptor superfamily). Steroid hormone receptors include progesterone receptors, estrogen receptors, androgen receptors, glucocorticoid receptors, and mineralocorticoid receptors. The present invention is particularly directed to androgen receptors.<br>
[000104]	In addition to ligand binding to the receptors, the receptors can be<br>
blocked to prevent ligand binding. When a substance binds to a receptor, the three-dimensional structure of the substance fits into a space created by the three-dimensional structure of the receptor in a ball and socket configuration. The better the ball fits into the socket, the more tightly it is held. This phenomenon is called affinity. If the affinity of a substance is greater than the original hormone, it will compete with the hormone and bind the binding site more-frequently. Once bound, signals may be sent through the receptor into the cells, causing the cell to respond in some fashion. This is<br><br>
called activation. On activation, the activated receptor then directly regulates the transcription of specific genes. But the substance and the receptor may have certain attributes, other than affinity, in order to activate the cell. Chemical bonds between atoms of the substance and the atoms of the receptors may form. In some cases, this leads to a change in the configuration of the receptor, which is enough to begin the activation process (called signal transduction).<br>
{000105]	In one embodiment, the present invention is directed to selective<br>
androgen receptor modulator compounds which are agonist compounds. A receptor agonist is a substance which binds receptors and activates them. Thus, hi one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and activating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the agonist compound of the present invention is an agonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the agonist compound also has anabolic activity. In another embodiment, the present invention provides selective androgen modulator compounds which have agonistic and anabolic activity of a nonsteroidal compound forme androgen receptor.<br>
[000106]	In another embodiment, the present invention is directed to selective<br>
androgen receptor modulator compounds which are antagonist compounds. A receptor antagonist is a substance which binds receptors and inactivates them. Thus, in one embodiment, the SARM compounds of the present invention are useful in binding to and inactivating steroidal hormone receptors. In one embodiment, the antagonist compound of the present invention is an antagonist which binds the androgen receptor. In another embodiment, the compound has high affinity for the androgen receptor.<br>
[000107]	In yet another embodiment, me SARM compounds of the present<br>
invention can be classified as partial AR agonist/antagonists. The SARMs are AR agonists in some tissues, to cause increased transcription of AR-responsive genes (e.g. muscle anabolic effect). In other tissues, these compounds serve as inhibitors at the AR to prevent agonistic effects of the native androgens.<br><br>
[000108]	Assays to determine whether the compounds of the present invention ore<br>
AR agonists or antagonists are well known to a person skilled in the art. For example, AR agonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to maintain and/or stimulate the growth of AR containing tissue such as prostate and seminal vesicles, as measured by weight. AR antagonistic activity can be determined by monitoring the ability of the SARM compounds to inhibit the growth of AR containing tissue.<br>
[000109]	The compounds of the present invention bind either reversibly or<br>
irreversibly to an androgen receptor. In one embodiment, the androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a mammal. In another embodiment, tbe androgen receptor is an androgen receptor of a human. In one embodiment, the SARM compounds hind reversibly to the androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Reversible binding of a compound to a receptor means that a compound can detach from the receptor after binding.<br>
[000110]	In another embodiment, the SARM compounds bind irreversibly to the<br>
androgen receptor of a mammal, for example a human. Thus, in one embodiment, the compounds of the present invention may contain a functional group (e.g. affinity label) that allows alkylation of the androgen receptor (i.e. covalent bond formation). Thus, in this case, the compounds are alkylating agents which bind irreversibly to the receptor and, accordingly, cannot be displaced by a steroid, such as the endogenous Uganda DHT and testosterone. An "alkylating agent" is defined herein as an agent which alkylates (forms a covalent bond) with a cellular component, such as DNA, RNA or enzyme. It is a highly reactive chemical that introduces alkyl radicals into biologically active molecules and thereby prevents their proper functioning. The alkylating moiety is an electrophilic group that interacts with micleophiiic moieties in cellular components.<br>
[000111]	According to one embodiment of the present invention, a method is<br>
provided for binding the SARM compounds of the jresent invention to an androgen receptor by contacting tbe receptor with a SARM compound end/or its analog, derivative, isomer, metabolite, pharmaceutically acceptable salt, pharmaceutical product,<br><br>
hydrate or N-oxide or any combination thereof, under conditions effective to cause the selective androgen receptor modulator compound to bind the androgen receptor. The binding of the selective androgen receptor modulator compounds to the androgen receptor enables the compounds of the present invention to be useful as a male contraceptive and in a number of hormone therapies. The agonist compounds bind to and activate the androgen receptor. The antagonist compounds hind to and inactivate the androgen receptor. Binding of the agonist or antagonist compounds is either reversible or irreversible.<br>

[000133]	"BPH (benign prostate hyperplasia)" is a nonmalignant enlargement of<br>
the prostate gland, and is the most common non-malignant proliferative abnormality found in any internal organ and the major cause of morbidity in the adult male. BPH occurs in over 75% of men over 50 years of age, reaching 88% prevalence by the ninth decade.   BPH frequently results in a gradual squeezing of the portion of the urethra<br><br>
which traverses the prostate (prostatic urethra). This causes patients to experieoce a frequent urge to urinate because of incomplete emptying of the bladder and urgency of urination. The obstruction of urinary flow can also lead to a general lack of control over urination, including difficulty initiating urination when desired, as well as difficulty in preventing urinary flow because of the inability to empty urine from the bladder, a condition known as overflow urinary incontinence, which can lead to urinary obstruction and to urinary failure.<br>

known dissolving, mixing, granulating, or tablet-forming processes. For oral administration, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are mixed with additives customary for this purpose, such as vehicles, stabilizers, or inert diluents, and converted by customary methods into suitable forms for administration, such as tablets, coated tablets, hard or soft gelatin capsules, aqueous, alcoholic or oily solutions. Examples of suitable inert vehicles are<br><br>
conventional tablet bases such as lactose, sucrose, or cornstarch in combination with binders such as acacia, cornstarch, gelatin, with disintegrating agents such as cornstarch, potato starch, alginic acid, or with a lubricant such as stearic acid or magnesium gtearate.<br>
[000153]	Examples of suitable oily vehicles or solvents are vegetable or animal oils<br>
such as sunflower oil or fish-liver oil. Preparations can be effected both as dry and as wet granules. For parenteral administration (subcutaneous, intravenous, intraarterial, or intramuscular injection), the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxides, and the like are converted into a solution, suspension, or emulsion, if desired with the substances customary and suitable for this purpose, for example, solubilizers or other auxiliaries. Examples are sterile liquids such as water and oils, with or without the addition of a surfactant and omer pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants. Illustrative oils are those of petroleum, animp), vegetable, or synthetic origin, for example, peanut oil, soybean oil, or mineral oil. In general, water, saline, aqueous dextrose and related sugar solutions, and glycols such as propylene glycols or polyethylene glycol are preferred liquid carriers, particularly for injectable solutions.<br>
[000154]	The preparation of pharmaceutical compositions which contain an active<br>
component is well understood in die art Typically, such compositions are prepared as aerosols of the polypeptide delivered to the nasopharynx or as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; however, solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified. The active therapeutic ingredient is often mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with die active ingredient Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline, dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like or any combination thereof.<br>
[000155]	In addition, the composition can contain minor amounts of auxiliary<br>
substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents, pH buffering agents which enhance the effectiveness of the active ingredient.<br>
[000156]	An  active component can be formulated into the  composition as<br><br>
neutralized phaimaceutically acceptable salt forms. Piarmaceurically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the polypeptide or antibody molecule), which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, maudelic, and the like. Salts formed from the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as Uopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-emylamino ethanol, bistidine, procaine, and the like.<br>
[000157]	For topical administration to body surfaces using, for example, creams,<br>
gels, drops, and the like, the SARM agents or their physiologically tolerated derivatives such as salts, esters, N-oxideB, and the like can be prepared and applied as solutions, suspensions, or emulsions in a physiologically acceptable diluent with or without a pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
[000168]	In another embodiment, the active compound can be delivered in a<br>
vesicle, in particular a liposome (see Langer, Science 249:1527-1533 (1990); Treat et al, in Liposomes in the Therapy of Infectious Disease and Cancer, Lopez- Berestein and Fidler (eds.), Lisa, New York, pp. 353-365 (1989); Lcpez-Berestein, ibid., pp. 317-327; see generally ibid).<br>
[000159]	For use in medicine, the salts of the SARM may be pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts. Other salts may, however, be useful in the preparation of the compounds according to the invention or of their pharmaceuticaUy acceptable salts. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of this invention include acid addition salts which may, for example, be formed by mixing a solution of the compound according to the invention with a solution of a phannaceuticaily acceptable acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, methanesulphonic acid, fumaric acid, maleic acid, succinic acid, acetic acid, benzoic: acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, carbonic acid or phosphoric acid.<br><br>
[000160}	The following examples are presented in order to more fully illustrate the<br>
preferred embodiments of the invention. They should in no way be constwed, however, as limiting the broad scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>
EXPERIMENTAL METHODS<br>
[000162]	Animals.   Immature male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 90 to lOOg,<br>
were purchased from Harlan Biosciences (Indianapolis, IN). The animals were maintained on a 12-hour light-dark cycle with food and water available ad libitum. The animal protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Laboratory Animal Care and Use Committee.<br>
[000163]	Study Design.   Rats were randomly distributed into treatment groups<br>
groups. One day prior to the start of drug treatment, animals were individually removed from   the   cage,   weighed   and   anesthetized   with   an   intraperitoneal   dose   of<br><br>
keiamine/xylazine (S7/13 mg*g; approximately 1 mL per kg). When appropriately anesthetized (i.e., no response to toe pincb), the animals" ears were marked fcr identification purposes. Animate were then placed on a sterile pad and their abdomen and scrotum washed with betadine and 70% alcohol. The testes were removed via a midline scrotal incision, with sterile suture being used to ligate supra-testicular tissue prior to surgical removal of each testis. The surgical wound site was closed with sterile stainless steel wound clips, and the site cleaned with betadine. The animals were allowed to recover on a sterile pad (until able to stand) and then returned to their cage.<br>
[000164]	Twenty-four    hours    later,    animals    were    re-anesthetized    with<br>
ketamine/xylazine, and an Alzet osmotic pump(s) (model 2002) was placed aubcutaneouly in the scapular region. In this instance, the scapular region was shaved and cleaned (betadine and alcohol) and a small incision (1 cm) made using a sterile scalpel. The osmotic pump was inserted and the wound closed with a sterile stainless steel wound clip. Animals were allowed to recover and were returned to their cage. Osmotic pumps contained the appropriate treatment dissolved in polyethylene glycol 300 (PEG30Q). Osmotic pumps were filled with the appropriate solution one day prior to implantation. Animals were monitored daily for signs of acute toxicity to drug treatment (e.g., lethargy, rough coat).<br>
[000165]	After   14   days   of  drug  treatment,   rats   were   anesthetized   with<br>
ketamine/xylaziae. Animals were then sacrificed by exsaoguinatkms under anesthesia. A blood sample was collected by venipuncture of the abdominal aorta, and submitted for complete blood cell analysis. A portion of me blood was placed in a separate tube, centrifuged at 12,000g for 1 minute, and the plasma layer removed and frozen at -20°C. The ventral prostates, seminal vesicles, levator ani muscle, liver, kidneys, spleen, lungs, and heart were removed, cleared of extraneous tissue, weighed, and placed in vials containing 10% neutral buffered formalin. Preserved tissues were sent to GTx, Inc. for histopathological analysis.<br>
[000166J	For data analysis, the weights of all organs were normalized to body<br>
weight, and analyzed for any statistical significant difference by single-factor ANOVA.<br><br><br>
Compound 7<br>
{000169}	The androgenic and anabolic activities of compound 7 were examined in<br>
a castrated rat model after 14 days of administration. Intact Controls (not castrated, untreated) and Castrated Controls (castrated, untreated) were used as the control groups. Rats were castrated on day 0 and received daily subcutaneous doses (0.05 to 3 mg/day) of compound 7 in a vehicle of DMSO/PEG. Rats were sacrificed on final day and the wet weight of androgenic (prostate and seminal vesicles) and anabolic (levator ani) organs determined.<br>
[000170]	As shown in Figure 2, treatment with increasing doses of compound 7<br>
resulted in an increase in prostate, seminal vesicle and levator ani muscle weights in a dose-dependent manner. Compound 7 showed lower potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weights of prostate and seminal vesicle, but a greater potency and intrinsic activity in increasing the weight of levator ani muscle.<br>
