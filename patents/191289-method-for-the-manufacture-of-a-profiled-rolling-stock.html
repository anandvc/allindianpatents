				<td>The invention relates to a method for the manufacture of a profiled rolling stock and more particularly, to a method for heat-treating profiled rolling stock, in particular track or railroad rails, with an increased heat removal from portions of the profile surface during cooling in the gamma range of the basic iron material, wherein a conversion into a fine pearlitic grain of increased strength, in particular increased wear resistance and increased hardness takes place in the desired cross-sectional area(s), particularly in the head area of rails, and, if required, a deformation or bending by a thermally caused warping of the rolling stock, in particular the rail, perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis is decreased, preferably essentially prevented, during cooling to room temperature, particularly following a structural conversion in the more heavily cooled cross-sectional area(s), and an increased rigidity and fatigue strength under reversed bending stresses is achieved.<br>
The invention further relates to a device for the heat treatment of profiled rolling stock, in particular track or railroad rails, essentially consisting of at least one stand-by area for the rolling stock at the roller table, with a rolling stock positioning device, a cooling treatment area, with devices for partial high intensity heat removal from the surface of the rolling stock and a final cooling area for cooling the rolling stock to room temperature, as well as depositing, transverse transporting, stopping and manipulating means.<br>
Finally, the invention relates to profiled rolling stock, in    particular    to    a   track    or    railroad    rail,    consisting    of   a<br><br>
rail head of an at least partial pearlitic grain structure, a rail base and a web between the rail head and the rail base.<br>
Profiled rolling stock, in particular track or railroad rails, is mainly produced from basic iron alloys with weight-% contents between 0.4 and 1.0 C, 0.1 and 1.2 Si, 0.5 and 3.5 Mn, if required up to 1.5 Cr, as well as other alloy elements at concentrations below 1%, the rest being iron and impurities occurring in the manufacturing process. Based on the usual dimensions, for example a weight between 30 to 100 kg/m, and the ratio of cross section to circumference of rails resulting therefrom, during cooling of the rolling stock from the conversion heat in still air, for example on cooling beds and the like, a conversion of the grain from an austenitic into a rough pearlitic structure, possibly having portions of ferrite, because of slow cooling, takes place. The previously mentioned materials having the above structure have a hardness in the range between 250 HB to 350 HB.<br>
An increase in traffic and larger axial loads, as well as the desire to improve the durability of rails in practical use has resulted in a multitude of suggestions for increasing the strength and wear resistance of the material. In the course of this it is possible to achieve more advantageous or improved material properties with a hardness of 400 HB and above by means of measures in respect to heat treatment and/or alloy techniques.<br>
However, rails should be easy to weld in the field for reasons, among others, of forming shock-free sections or multiple lengths, so that measures in respect to alloy techniques for increasing the hardness or strength and durability of the material can mostly be applied on a small<br><br>
scale only due to the welding problems and are aimed to a heat treatment matched to the composition of the steel (German Patent Publication DE-C 34 46 794, European Patent Publications EP-B-0 187 904, EP-B-0 186 373). For economic reasons, such methods have also not proven themselves on a large scale.<br>
To increase the useful properties of rails and switch parts made from the above mentioned materials it is possible and known to one skilled in the art to provide a fine pearlitic material structure by means of a thermal tempering treatment. In the process it is important to set appropriate cooling conditions or cooling rates for the cool-down from the austenitizing temperature. For example, European Patent Publication EP-B-0 293 002 suggests for this purpose to perform, after an initially high cooling intensity, a practically isothermic structural conversion at approximately 530°C. It is furthermore known from German Published, Non-Examined Patent Application DE-OS 28 20 784 to perform hardening of rails of a defined composition in boiling water and to achieve a desired cooling intensity for setting a fine pearlitic structural state by means of additives and movement steps.<br>
In accordance with Austrian Patent AT-PS-323 224 it had also been suggested to produce rails with a homogeneous fine pearlitic structure from a selected alloy by the application of defined cooling parameters, for example a cooling speed between 10 and 2 0°C/s down to a temperature of no more than 550°C. However, the above steps have the common disadvantage that, depending on the mass concentration of the rolling stock profile, an even cooling intensity of the surface can cause different cooling speeds and structural forms in the zones<br><br>
close to the surface, and that it is often necessary to take elaborate precautions to prevent undesired local structural form or material properties, in particular excessive hardness and brittleness, in parts of the rail which are primarily stressed by bending.<br>
In many cases it was also proposed to provide in a directed manner a heterogeneous microstructure in the cross section of a rail in accordance with the respective stresses. For example, a method is known from German Patent Publication DE-C-30 06 695, in accordance with which a conversion over the entire cross section is caused from the rolling heat by cooling the rail, after which the head of the rail is re-austenitized by inductive heating and subsequently hardened. In accordance with WO 94/02652 it was further proposed to cool the rail head to a surface temperature between 450 and 550°C in a cooling medium of a specially set cooling intensity and in this way to create a fine pearlitic grain therein. A device for the suspended hardening of rails in accordance with German Patent Publication DE-C-40 03 363 is suitable for such treatment.<br>
However, the inhomogeneous cooling over the cross section of profiled rolling stock can lead to curvatures or deviations from the straightness at room temperature. To avoid this disadvantage it has been proposed (German Patent Publication DE-A-42 37 991) to transport or cool rails suspended, preferably with the head down, on a cooling bed, however, a directed formation of a heterogeneous grain structure over the cross section is hardly possible here.<br>
All of the methods and devices known up to now have the common disadvantage that although they disclose solutions in<br><br>
limited areas or regarding individual method steps leading to the desired goal in the manufacture of profiled rolling stock, overcoming all the problems in a satisfactory way cannot be shown in connection with an economical production of long rails of high quality and with special finishing properties.<br>
The invention is intended to provide relief in this area and its object is, while removing the disadvantages of the known production types, to recite a novel method by means of which profiled rolling stock having particularly advantageous useful properties can be produced. It is a further object of the invention to make available a device especially for executing the method and to design rolling stock, in particular a rail,  for highest stresses.<br>
Accordingly, there is provided a method for the manufacture of a profiled rolling stock, such as inter alia track or railroad rails, with an increased heat removal from portions of the profile surface during cooling in the gamma range of the basic iron material, wherein a conversion into a fine pearlitic grain of increased strength, such as increased wear resistance and increased hardness takes place in the desired cross-sectional area(s), in the head area of rails, and, optionally a deformation or bending by a thermally caused warping of the rolling stock, in particular the rail, perpendicularly to the longitudinal axis is decreased, essentially prevented, during cooling to room temperature, following a structural conversion in the more heavily cooled cross-sectional area(s), and an increased rigidity and fatigue strength under reversed bending stresses is achieved, characterized in that the rolling stock, such as the rail, at an average temperature of at most 1100°C, preferably at most 900°C, but at least 750°C, and aligned straight in its longitudinal direction during its plastic shaping, in its aligned state is moved into a transverse direction and held there and, in a first step of cooling the rolling stock or the rail, it is allowed to cool evenly to a temperature below 860°C, preferably approximately 820°C,<br><br>
in particular to 5 to 120°C above the Ar3 temperature of the alloy with the same local cooling intensity, essentially by radiation in still air, wherein in a second step of cooling, heat is removed from the rolling stock in the longitudinal direction with an intensity which locally is essentially the same, but viewed in cross section is circumferentially different, and the cooling intensity in at least one zone at the circumference of the profiled rolling stock is increased, wherein the larger cooling intensity(ies) are assigned to the area(s) with a large ratio of the cross section to the circumference or with a large portion of volume in respect to the surface or with a high mass concentration, and/or those with locally high temperature of the rolling stock and the area(s) of a cooling speed increased in this manner is (are) brought to the conversion temperature, under which cooling conditions a fine pearlitic grain structure free of martensite is formed, after which in subsequent step, cooling to room temperature at the same local cooling intensity, for example in still air, is performed.<br>
In a method in accordance with the species this object is attained in that the rolling stock, in particular the rail, at an average temperature of at most 1100°C, preferably at most 900°C, but at least 750°C, and aligned straight in its longitudinal direction during its plastic shaping, is in its aligned state moved into a transverse direction and held there and, in a first step of cooling the rolling stock or the rail, it is allowed to cool evenly to a temperature below 860°C, preferably approximately 820°C, in particular to 5 to 120°C above the Ar3 temperature of the alloy with the same local cooling intensity, preferably essentially by radiation in still air. In a second step of cooling, heat is removed from the rolling stock in the longitudinal direction with an intensity which locally is essentially the same, but viewed in cross section is circumferentially different, and the cooling intensity in at least one zone at the circumference of the profiled rolling stock is increased, wherein the larger cooling   intensity(ies)    are   assigned   to   the   area(s)    with   a<br><br>
large ratio of the cross section to the circumference or with<br>
a large portion of volume in respect to the surface or with a<br>
high mass concentration and/or those with locally high<br>
temperatures of the rolling stock, and the area(s) of a<br>
cooling speed increased in this manner is (are) brought to the<br>
conversion temperature, under which cooling condition a fine<br>
pearlitic grain structure free of martensite is formed. Then,<br>
in a subsequent step, cooling to room temperature at the same<br>
local cooling intensity, for example in still air,  is<br>
performed.  It is important that a straight alignment of the<br>
rolling stock during plastic shaping takes place and this is<br>
performed within a temperature range between 750°C and 1100°C.<br>
It has been found that lower temperatures than 750°C can lead<br>
to partially resilient bending with deviations from the<br>
straight alignment and as a result to inhomogeneous cooling<br>
intensity in the longitudinal direction of the rail. In most<br>
cases rolling stock temperatures above 1100°C cause a growth<br>
of the austenite bodies or the formation of rough grains, by<br>
which the material properties can be disadvantageously<br>
affected in the end. Eased on straight aligned rolling stock,<br>
it has been found to be important for the formation of a fine<br>
pearlitic area of the cross section which is evenly developed<br>
in the longitudinal direction that the rolling stock is held<br>
and allowed to cool evenly in a first cooling step to a<br>
temperature below 860°C at the same local cooling intensity.<br>
In the process it is possible, on the one hand, to compensate<br>
a local inhomogeneity of the temperature distribution in the<br>
longitudinal direction which possibly might have been caused<br>
by the partial resting on a transverse transport device, on<br>
the other hand an axially symmetrical or center- symmetrical<br>
temperature distribution is provided in the cross section of<br>
the profiled rolling stock and in this way its straightness is<br>
stabilized.  It is particularly advantageous to perform this<br><br>
compensating cooling to a temperature of 5 to 120°C above the Ar3 temperature of the alloy in order to provide advantageous conditions for a partial conversion of the grain into a fine pearlitic structural shape in portions of the cross section. In this case the Ar3 temperature is the temperature at which a conversion of the gamma grid into the alpha grid of the alloy begins at a cooling velocity of 3°C/min.<br>
Cooling of the rolling stock at an intensity of heat removal which in the longitudinal direction is essentially the same but, viewed in cross section is different circumferentially is known per se. However, it is important to assign the areas of increased cooling intensity of the surface to correspond with the mass concentration of the rolling stock. In connection with a straight alignment, compensating cooling and setting of a symmetrical temperature distribution and an assignment of the cooling areas it is possible to maintain a cooling speed, which is different over the cross-sectional areas, but essentially the same in the longitudinal direction of the rolling stock. In this connection it is important to set the value of the cooling speed with which the selected area of the rolling stock is brought to the conversion temperature by means known per se. As can be seen in Fig. 3, which is a time-temperature conversion diagram of an alloy of known composition and is known to one skilled in the art, in the course of higher rates of cooling from the Ar3 temperature, for example the curves c and d, martensite parts are formed in the grain, because of which the material achieves greater hardness, but loses considerably in elasticity and has increased breaking tendencies and the intended use is no longer possible. Low cooling rates, for example those of the curve h, create a rough pearlitic soft grain structure. Thus it is important to<br><br>
set the local cooling rates high enough that martensite formation during conversion is prevented in every case, but that a fine pearlitic grain is created in the area of increased cooling intensity. Following the complete grain conversion, the rolling stock is brought to room temperature at the same local cooling intensity in order to reduce or to essentially prevent bending of the rolling stock.<br>
It is particularly advantageous if the heat treatment is performed by means of the hot forming heat following the hot forming of the rolling stock at a deforming degree of 1.8 to 8%, preferably 2 to 5%, during the last tapping at a temperature of at least 750°C and at most 1050°C. A final deformation with a deformation degree or a cross-sectional reduction of 1.8 to 8% causes an advantageous austenite grain refining if conversion takes place in a temperature range between 770°C to 1050°C. It has been shown that lesser conversion degrees than 1.8 cause a particularly strong rough grain or grain growth in places, but larger conversions than 8% cause a large temperature increase in central or interior areas, apparently because of released conversion energy, because of which inhomogeneities in the grain can be caused locally and reductions in quality can occur.<br>
In view of receiving essentially straight aligned or axially aligned rolling stock after cooling to room temperature and particularly in view of rails having increased rigidity and fatigue strength under reversed bending stresses, it is of great advantage if in the second step of cooling the cooling intensity is increased in two or more zones at the circumference of the profiled rolling stock. By means of this it is possible to achieve increased hardness and increased strength of the material in several areas of a cross-sectional<br><br>
surface close to the surface because of a finer pearlitic structure of the grain. In case of bending stresses of the rolling stock, wherein the cross-sectional zones which are farthest distant from the neutral grain or zero line show the greatest stress, it is now possible to embody at least two of these peripheral zones to have increased strength. It has been found that with a rail it is also possible to increase the fracture toughness of the material in the base area.<br>
In a preferred manner, the portion of the rolling stock having the largest mass concentration, for example the head of the rail, is cooled in a dipping process or by being dipped into a cooling liquid, while simultaneously heat is removed by means of lesser cooling intensity, for example compressed air or air-water spraying, from the rolling stock part(s) with a lesser mass concentration, for example the base of the rail, which are intended to be provided with increased cooling. Proceeding in this way it is possible to counteract the formation of a high interior tension state and thermal warping of the rolling stock.<br>
In order to prevent a disadvantageous martensite formation and to achieve a fine pearlitic structure of the grains in the alloys on an iron base mentioned at the outset, it is advantageous if the degree of cooling intensity, in particular the composition of the cooling liquid for the dip cooling, is set in such a way that, in the temperature range between 800°C to 450°C, cooling of the zone close to the surface of the dipped part in particular is achieved at 1.6 to 2.4°C/s, preferably at approximately 2.0°C/s. This cooling speed is preferred for economical reasons, because when a desired quality of the rolled product has been achieved, a<br><br>
short cooling time in the second step is required and in this way a large throughput is achieved.<br>
To minimize the curvature it has been shown to be advantageous if with profiled rolling stock of T-shaped cross section such as is present, for example, at the base of a rail, the zone or surface opposite the web is cooled at higher intensity, preferably by means of compressed air or an air-water mixture. In the process it has been found in view of the improvement of the long term properties to be particularly advantageous if the surface zone located opposite the web of increased cooling intensity is embodied to be essentially symmetrical in respect to the web axis and is laterally limited.<br>
If furthermore it is intended to prevent an increased cooling intensity of the areas of the cross section of the profiled rolling stock which are distal in respect to a mass concentration or a web juncture and/or to protect these areas from an increased heat removal or at least to heat them briefly, it is possible to provide a grain of the same or decreased material strength in the edges of the rolling stock. Surprisingly this lowers the danger of breaking, particularly in case of sharp and/or changing continuous stresses of the rolled material.<br>
It is possible to achieve a special strength of the shape if the cooling intensity at the surface of the profiled rolling stock, in particular the rail, is set in such a way that the zones in which the conversion of the gamma grain takes place during cooling are essentially embodied to be parallel symmetrical and/or parallel to the neutral plane,<br><br>
preferably concentric to the line of the center of gravity or the center of gravity of the cross- sectional surface.<br>
In order to achieve an essentially completely even local cooling intensity in the longitudinal direction and to maintain the heat transfer into the cooling medium stable, it can be provided in accordance with the invention that the rolling stock, a part of which in respect to the cross section is dipped into a cooling liquid in a dip tank, is moved in this longitudinal direction relative to the cooling liquid container or dip tank during cooling and/or that at least during the time in which a portion of the rolling stock is dipped into the cooling liquid the latter is charged with an oscillation or is made to oscillate. It has been found that these measures decisively improve the homogeneity of the achieved quality.<br>
A device of the type mentioned at the outset for the integral solution of the problems when producing profiled rolling stock having special properties, is distinguished in accordance with the invention in that the roller bed in the stand-by area has a rolling stock positioning device, known per se, and means for the straight or axially aligned positioning of the profiled rolling stock during its plastic shaping, has a transverse transport device for a straight or axially aligned transfer of the rolling stock essentially perpendicularly to its axis from the stand-by area into the cooling treatment area, in which area a device, known per se, for hardening rolling stock, in particular the head of rails, by means of cooling liquid in a dip tank with holding and manipulation devices and a controllable additional cooling device for more intense cooling of at least one further area of the rolling stock, in particular the base of a rail, is<br><br>
disposed and that the final cooling area has a support for the rolling stock for its cooling to room temperature.<br>
It was found that the straight or axially aligned positioning is important, particularly in connection with heat treatments to be performed partially in respect to the cross section or in partial areas of a profiled rolling stock. By preventing a curvature over the entire length or partial areas thereof it is possible to maintain the predetermined cooling conditions or the cooling intensities of the rolling stock even, viewed in the axial direction, so that differences in strength or hardness along a generatrix of the profile are eliminated. Research has shown that different distances from the wall of a coolant reservoir and/or from the spray cooling axis can cause overly proportional deviations of the hardness and strength values.<br>
During positioning it is furthermore important that the rolling stock is subjected to plastic shaping by means of appropriate devices in order to prevent elastic returns to a possibly partially curved shape. In order to avoid the necessity of later straightening it is of great importance to bring the profiled rolling stock in an axially aligned manner into a cooling area by means of a straight-line transverse transport. In addition to this a manipulation device is provided in the cooling area, by means of which the transfer, holding, dipping into a cooling liquid tank or hardening of partial areas of the rolling stock as well as the transfer into a final cooling area are possible." In the process at least one additional cooling device can be provided for the intensified cooling of further cross-sectional areas.<br><br>
In a further development of the invention it is of advantage that the additional cooling device can be placed against the rolling stock and its cooling intensity is controllable, so that a further local heat removal corresponding to the method can be set.<br>
An embodiment is also advantageous, wherein the additional cooling device has parts for forming a local cooling means flow which is essentially uninterrupted in the longitudinal or axial direction of the rolling stock and limited in the transverse direction and, if required, has means for preventing an increased heat removal from the surface(s) adjoining the cooled surface. By means of this it is possible to form sharply limited cooling zones and to exclude adjacent areas from an intensified heat removal process or to create a lesser material hardness in them, wherein in accordance with a further embodiment the additional cooling device is designed as a moving pressure or spray cooling device.<br>
The homogeneity of the hardness and strength values in the longitudinal direction of the profiled rolling stock can be further increased if the rolling stock can be moved in the cooling liquid in the longitudinal axial direction in respect to the dip tank and/or in respect to the additional cooling device, and/or if installations are disposed on the dip tank and/or in the cooling liquid itself by means of which the cooling liquid can be turbulently moved and/or set to oscillate. It was found that relative movements as well as oscillation movements or pressure waves between the cooling medium and the work piece even out the local cooling intensity and create advantageous heat treating conditions.<br><br>
A rail in accordance with the invention, particularly one produced in accordance with one of the previously mentioned methods, possibly produced in an above described device is distinguished in that in its cross section the rail shows great material strength and hardness values in the upper area of the head, which values are reduced in the lower head area in the web and the peripheral parts of the base, and that in the center area in the bottom area of the base there are increased hardness values of the material compared with the peripheral parts and the web, wherein particularly even quality characteristics are achieved if essentially equal material hardness values have been set symmetrically with the main axis of the cross-sectional profile or symmetrically to the perpendicular axis of the cross-section of the rail. Such a rail displays improved use properties even under increased demands such as high axial loads and/or high frequency of use and/or small radii of curvature of the line.<br>
The invention will be described in detail in what follows by means of/drawings showing only one embodiment. There are shown in<br>
Fig.	1 the course of heat treatment of rails,<br>
Fig.	2 a rail in cross section,<br>
Fig.	3 a time-temperature conversion diagram of a rail<br>
material.<br>
As schematically shown in Fig. 1, profiled rolling stock, such as a rail, is positioned in a stand-by area A at a roller table 21 by movable bumpers or the like, for example (not shown) . The rail l is then aligned straight by alignment means 22 and 23, wherein a centering type, of the alignment means  which  also  corrects  a  vertical  curvature  is<br><br>
advantageous. Following the alignment of the rolling stock 1, there is a transverse transport to a support 2 in a cooling area B and placement into a manipulation device with holding means 24, wherein holding during the movement must be performed in such a way that there is no bending transversely to the longitudinal axis. In a manner known per se, the rolling stock or the rail 1 is partially immersed by the holding means 24 into a cooling liquid 37 in a dip tank 38. Herein it is important that the distance of the surface of the rail 1 from the wall of the dip tank is equally great on both sides over its length. For intensifying and particularly for an equalization of the cooling intensity of a rolling stock surface, in an advantageous manner the rolling stock 1 can be movable in the dip tank 38 or the cooling medium 37 in a longitudinal direction in an amount of, for example 0.5 to 5 m. It is also possible to use oscillation generators (not shown) in the cooling medium 37 or on the dip tank, which cause the cooling medium to oscillate at a frequency of, for example, 100 to 800/min, which advantageously affects the cooling intensity.<br>
An additional cooling device 3 can be placed on or attached to a flat part of the rolling stock, possibly on the base 13 of a rail 1. Such an additional cooling device can have a water supply 32 and an air supply 33 and form a spray 31 directed to a surface part of the rolling stock or the base of the rail. To provide a decreased cooling intensity to the peripheral parts 132 and to form a zone of increased material hardness only in a central area 131 of a rolling stock or rail base area, it can be advantageous to provide a cooling medium removal, for example by means of an aspirating device.<br><br>
After cooling of the rolling stock, in particular a rail 1, immersed into a cooling medium 37 and in particular of a portion thereof located opposite it and subjected to a spray 31, below the conversion temperature of the material of an intensity causing a fine pearlitic grain, for example in accordance with Fig. 3 to approximately 500°C at a cooling rate in accordance with curve f, the rail can be placed on a support 25 in the final cooling area C for cooling to room temperature.<br>
As represented in Fig. 2, a rail 1 in accordance with the invention has three areas of different grain structure or hardness, wherein the transition areas are embodied to be continuous. A fine pearlitic zone 111 of hardness values between 340 and 390 HB, possibly up to 425 HB, is provided in the rail head 11 and makes a downward transition into a zone 112 of reduced hardness, for example 300 to 340 HB. In the adjoining web 12, which in actual use must have a large degree of toughness, hardness values between 280 and 32 0 HB have accordingly been provided. A pearlitic grain of a rougher structure or lamella formation and a hardness between 280 to 320 HB, the same as in the web 12, is provided in the peripheral areas 132 of the rail base 13. Initiation of a rupture or break is prevented to a large extent by means of this grain embodiment and the material properties of reduced hardness values. However, an area 131 of increased material strength and hardness values of 3 00 to 350 HB and more is formed in the center of the bottom of the base 13. As has been determined, such a distribution in "accordance with the invention of the mechanical properties of the material across the cross section of a rail cause high stability and advantageous long term behavior, particularly under difficult conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
