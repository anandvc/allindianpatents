PHARMACEUTICAL COMPOSITION COMPRISING A FACTOR Vila AND A FACTOR XIII<br>
FIELD OF THIS INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a factor Vila and a factor XIII. The invention also relates to the use of a combination of a factor Vila with a factor XIII for the manufacture of a medicament for treatment of subjects suffering from bleeding episodes, or prevention hereof. The invention also relates to a method for treatment of bleeding episodes in subjects and to a method for enhancing clot formation in a subject. The present invention also relates to kits comprising these compounds,<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Haemostasis is initiated by the formation of a complex between tissue factor (TF) being ex¬posed to the circulating blood following an injury to the vessel wall, and FVIla which is present in the circulation in an amount corresponding to about 1% of the totai FVII protein mass. This complex is anchored to the TF-bearing cell and activates FX into FXa and FIX into FIXa on the cell surface. FXa activates prothrombin to thrombin, which activates FVIII, FV, FXI and FXIII. Furthermore, the limited amount of thrombin formed in this initial step of haemostasis aiso activates the platelets. Following the action of thrombin on the platelets these change shape and expose charged phospholipids on their surface. This activated platelet surface forms the template for the further FX activation and the full thrombin generation. The further FX activation on the activated platelet surface occurs via a FlXa-FVIJIa complex formed on the surface of the activated platelet, and FXa then converts prothrombin into thrombin while still on the surface. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin which is insoluble and which stabilizes the initial platelet plug. This process is compartmentalized, I.e., localised to the site of TF expression or exposure, thereby minimizing the risk of a systemic activation of the coagulation sys¬tem. The insoluble fibrin forming the plug is furthermore stabilised by FXIII-catalysed cross-linking of the fibrin fibres.<br>
FVIla exists in plasma mainly as a single-chain zymogen, which is cleaved by FXa into its two-chain, activated form, FVIla. Recombinant activated factor Vila (rFVUa) has been developed as a pro-haemostatic agent. The administration of rFVIla offers a rapid and highly effective pro-haemostatic response in haemophilia subjects with bleedings who cannot be treated with coagulation factor products due to antibody formation. Also bleeding subjects with a factor VII deficiency or subjects having a normal coagulation system but experiencing excessive bleeding can be treated successfully with FVIla. In these studies, no unfavourable side effects of rFVIla (in particular the occurrence of thromboembolism) has been encountered.<br>
Extra exogenously administered FVIla increases the formation of thrombin on the activated platelet surface. This occurs in haemophiliac subjects lacking FIX or FVIII and therefore missing the most potent pathway for full thrombin formation. Also in the presence of a lowered number of platelets or platelets with a defect function, extra FVIla increases the thrombin formation.<br><br>
FX1II, the fibrin stabilising factor, is a transglutaminase that cross-links the fibrin monomers thereby providing a fibrin structure with increased resistance to the dissolution by piasmin and other proteolytic enzymes, factor XIII is also known as "fibrinoligase" and "fibrin stabilizing factor". When activated, FXIlia is able to form intermotecular gamma-glutamyl-epsilon-lysine cross-links between side chains of fibrin molecules and between other substrates. FX1I1 is found in plasma and in platelets. The enzyme exists in plasma as a tetramerlc zymogen consisting of two alpha-subunits and two beta-subunits (designated a2b2) and in platelets as a zymogen consisting of two alpha-subunits (designated ardimer).<br>
Both zymogens are activated by thrombin and Ca2+. Calcium is being released from the platelets on the aggregation at the site of injury. Thrombin cleaves off the 1-37 N-terminal amino acid residues (of ardimer). In case of the a2b2-zymogen, the beta-subunits are then dissociated from the activated alpha-subunits. Calcium binds equally weil to the zymogen and to the thrombin modified molecule. Following the thrombin and calcium activation the active centre cysteine on the alpha chain is exposed and the fully activated enzyme Is formed. Subjects with severe thrombocytopenia have been found to have low plasma levels of FXKI.<br>
It is well known that subjects who bleed excessively in association with surgery or major trauma and need blood transfusions develop more complications than those who do not experience any bleeding. However, also moderate bleedings requiring the administration of human blood or blood products {platelets, leukocytes, plasma-derived concentrates for the treatment of coagulation defects, etc.) may lead to complications associated with the risk of transferring human viruses (hepatitis, HIV, parvovirus, and other, by now unknown viruses), Extensive bleedings requiring massive blood transfusions may lead to the development of multiple organ failure including impaired lung and kidney function. Once a subject has developed these serious complications a cascade of events involving a number of cytokines and Inflammatory reactions is started making any treatment extremely difficult and unfortunately often unsuccessful. Therefore a major goal in surgery as well as in the treatment of major tissue damage is to avoid or minimise the bleeding<br>
To avoid or minimise such bleeding it is of importance to ensure the formation of stable and solid haemostatic plugs that are not easily dissolved by fibrinolytic enzymes. Furthermore, it is of importance to ensure quick and effective formation of such plugs or clots.<br>
Japanese patent application No. 2-167234 A concerns an adhesive for bio-tissue character¬ized by containing fibrinogen, prothrombin, blood coagulation factor VII, blood coagulation factor IX, blood coagulation factor X, blood coagulation factor XIII, antithrombin, a proteinase inhibitor, and cal¬cium ion.<br>

use in counteracting deficiencies of blood clotting factors or the effects of inhibitors to blood clotting<br>
factors in a subject.<br>

of extra exogenous FVlia and the effect on the formation of thrombin on the activated platelet surface<br>
in a model system mimicking hemophilia A or B conditions<br>
There remains a need in the art for an Improved, reliable and widely applicable method of<br>
enhancing coagulation, quickly forming stable haemostatic plugs and achieving full haemostasis in<br>
subjects, in particular in subjects having an impaired thrombin generation. There is also a need for a<br>
method wherein the amount of FVlia needed for achieving full haemostasis is lowered.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
One object of the present invention is to provide compositions, which can effectively be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding episodes and coagulation disorders.<br>
A second object of the present invention is to provide compositions in one dosage form, which can effectively be used in the treatment or prophylaxis of bleeding episodes or as a procoagulant<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide compositions, methods of treatment or kits exhibiting a synergistic effect.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide compositions, methods of treatment or kits exhibiting no substantial side effects, such as a high level of systemic activation of the coagulation system.<br>
Other objects of the present invention will become apparent upon reading the present description.<br>
The present inventors have shown that a combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII can reduce the clotting time of normal human plasma more effectively than either factor Vila or factor Xill alone. It has also been shown that a combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII can increase the firmness of the clot more effectively than either factor Vila or factor Xlll alone. By combining a factor Vila at a concentration where no further increase in clot firmness was observed with a factor Xlll, also at a concentration where no further increase in clot firmness was observed, it was unexpectedly shown that a further increase in ciot firmness was obtained, it has also been shown that combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII can prolong the in vitro ciot lysis time in normal human piasma more effectively than either factor Vila or factor Xlll inhibitor alone. Thus, by enhancing coagulation a more<br><br>
effective treatment of bleeding in subjects can be obtained. Moreover, patients can be treated with relatively lower concentrations of factor Vila, thus, reducing the relatively high costs in connection with conventional treatment with factor Vila alone.<br>

LIST OF FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 shows that the spontaneous clot formation in citrated normal human plasma (NHP) diluted to 1/10 in buffer containing 20 nM Hepes, 150 mM NaCI, and 5 mM CaCI2l pH 7.4 in a micro titer well (total volume 250 ^l) was obtained at about 2500-3000 sec. Fibrin clot formation was moni¬tored by the increase in optical density at 600 nm in a Specramax™ 340. Molecular Devices, Sunny¬vale CA. Fig. 1 shows that 10 nM recombinant factor Vila (rFV(Ia) from Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsvaard, Denmark shortened the clotting time to 1600 sec (n = 2). Further shortening of the clotting time was obtained when 30 nM factor XIII (FXIll) from American Diagnostica inc, Greenwich, CT was added together with 10 nM rFVlla (n = 3), The clot formed in the presence of FXIll was more transparent (lower maximal OD) than in its absence indicating that the addition of FXIll resulted in a more fine-meshed fibrin gel structure with thinner fibres.<br>
Figure 2 shows that supplementary FXIll (30 nM) prolongs the fibrin clot lysis time of clots formed in the presence of rFVlla and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Clot formation was induced in the presence or absence of 30 nM XIII by addition of 25 //I NHP to 225 p\ 20 nM Hepes, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCfe, pH 7.4 containing 50 nM rFVlla and 0.5 nM recombinant tPA from Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsvssrd, Denmark. Clot formation and subsequent clot lysis induced by tPA-mediated plasmi¬nogen activation was monftored by a Spectramax® 340 at 600 nm as the increase in OD6a0nm followed by reversion of the trace to the basal level. Fig. 2 shows that the clot lysis time under these conditions was significantly prolonged by the presence of FXIll.<br>
Figure 3 shows the effect of rFVlla and FXIll on Maximal Clot Firmness (MCF) as well as clot resistance to t-PA mediated lysis. Prior to rFVlla and/or FXIll addition the MCF obtained was 25 mm and the time required for half the clot to be tysed was 12.3 minutes (Fig. 3). Addition of Increasing concentrations of FXIll (0 - 40 nM) did not alter MCF; however, a dose-dependent prolongation of the half-clot lysis was observed, optimal at 30 nM FXIll (half-clot lysis time: 14,3 min, Fig. 3), Similarly, rFVlla (1 nM) addition resulted in clot protection from t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis (half-clot lysis time; 16.4 min) without any effect on MCF (Fig. 3), However, upon addition of rFVlla (1 nM) together with FXIll (30 nM) an increase in the MCF (29 mm), as well as a profound protection from fibrinolysis (half-clot lysis time; 27.1 min) was observed (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results demonstrate that rFVlla and FXIll addition to plasma in a synergistic fashion improve clot mechanical strength and resistance to t-PA mediated fibrinolysis.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THIS INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a composition comprising a combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII. The invention also provides a composition comprising a combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII as the sole active ingredients. The composition may be in the form of a single composition or it may be in the form of a multi-component kit. The present compositions are useful as therapeutic and prophylactic procoagulant and fibrin clot-stabilizing agents and form quick fibrin clots in mammals, including primates such as humans.<br>
Whenever, a first or second or third, etc., unit dose is mentioned throughout this specification this does not indicate the preferred order of administration, but is merely done for convenience purposes.<br>
The present invention further provides a method for treating (including prophylacticaily treating or preventing) bleeding episodes in a subject, including a human being, e.g., due to trauma or surgery, or in subjects lacking or having defective blood coagulation factors FIX or FVHI or platelets.<br>
It has now been found that a combination of a factor Vila and a factor Xllla is an advanta¬geous product ensuring the formation of solid, stable and quick haemostatic plugs.<br>
The full thrombin generation is necessary for a solid, stabile haemostatic plug to be formed. The fibrin structure of such a plug is dependent on both the amount of thrombin formed and the rate of the initial thrombin generation. In the presence of an impaired thrombin generation a porous fibrin plug, which is highly permeable, is being formed. The fibrinolytic enzymes normally present on the fibrin surface easily dissolve such a fibrin plug. The formation of a stable fibrin plug is also dependent on the presence of factor Xllla, which is being activated by thrombin and therefore also dependent on the full thrombin generation. Furthermore, the recently described thrombin activatable fibrinolytic in¬hibitor, TAFI, requires rather high thrombin amounts for its activation, in the presence of a not fully adequate thrombin formation the TAFI may therefore not be activated resulting in the formation of a haemostatic plug, which is easier than normally dissolved by the normal fibrinolytic activity.<br>
By increasing the thrombin generation factor Vila provides the basis for a full factor XIII acti¬vation, which is of the uttermost importance for the formation of a fully stabilised haemostatic plug and thereby for the maintenance of haemostasis. In situations with lowered number of platelets, thrombo¬cytopenia, a faster thrombin generation is initiated by the administration of exogenous extra factor Vila. However, the total thrombin generation is not normalised by factor Vila even in high concentra¬tions.<br>
By combining a factor Vila and a factor XIII, in particular the factor XIII alpha chain (a2-dimer), a full activation of factor Xlll is facilitated which enhances the haemostatic effect of factor Vila.<br>
Furthermore, in subjects with lowered plasma concentrations of fibrinogen (multi-transfused subjects as a consequence of multiple trauma or extensive surgery) full factor Xlll activation does not occur. A more effective haemostasis is then obtained by the administration of a combination of a factor Vila and a factor Xlll.<br><br>
Another way to increase the stability of fibrin haemostatic plugs is to ensure full presence of factor Xllla (activated factor XIII).<br>
Subjects with thrombocytopenia have an impaired thrombin generation as well as a defective stabilization of the fibrin plugs resulting in haemostatic plugs prone to premature dissolution. Further¬more, subjects subjected to major trauma or organ damage and who, as a consequence, have ob¬tained frequent blood transfusions often have lowered platelet counts as well as lowered levels of fi¬brinogen, factor VIII, and other coagulation proteins. These subjects experience an impaired (or low¬ered) thrombin generation. In addition, their lowered fibrinogen level interfere negatively with the acti¬vation of factor XIII. These subjects, therefore, have a defective, or less efficient, haemostasis leading to the formation of fibrin plugs which are easily and prematurely dissolved by proteolytic enzymes, such enzymes in addition being extensively released in situations characterized by extensive trauma and organ damage.<br>
In order to facilitate the formation of fully stabilized plugs with full capacity to maintain haemostasis in a subject, a composition according to the invention is administered. This composition is especially beneficial In subjects with a lowered number of platelets and in subjects with lowered plasma levels of fibrinogen and/or other coagulation proteins.<br>
In the presence of a factor XIII lower concentrations of factor Vila may be sufficient to ensure a sufficient haemostasis.<br>
As stated above, factor XIII exists in plasma as a tetrameric zymogen consisting of two al-pha-subunits and two beta-subunits (designated a2 b2), but is found in other tissue (e,g., platelets) as an a2-dimer. Either of these zymogen forms, or activated factor XIII (factor Xllla), may be used within the present invention, as well as genetically engineered variants of factor XIII that retain their charac¬teristic cross-linking activity. In one embodiment, the factor X1I1 is human factor XIII; in another em¬bodiment, the factor XIII is human a2-dimer; in yet another embodiment, the factor XIII Is activated human factor Xllla.<br>
The factor XIII and factor Vila used in the present invention may be purified from blood or produced by recombinant means. It is evident that the practice of the methods described herein is in¬dependent of how the purified factor XII! and factor Vila are derived and, therefore, the present inven¬tion is contemplated to cover use of any factor XIII and factor Vila preparation suitable for use herein. Preferred are human factor Vila and human factor XIII. Also genetically engineered variants of factor Vila and factor XIII retaining their characteristic haemostasis-reiated activity may be used in the pre¬sent inventions. Fragments of factor Vila or factor XIII or factor Vila- or factor XNI-variants retaining their characteristic haemostasis-reiated activity may also be used in the present inventions. The haemostasis-reiated activity of a factor Vila may, for example, be measured using the factor Vila-activity assay described in the present specification, The haemostasis-reiated activity of a factor XIII may, for example, be measured using the factor XIH-activity assay described In the present specifica¬tion.<br>
Non-limiting examples of factor VII variants having substantially the same or better biological activity compared to wild-type factor Vila include, but are not limited to, those described in Danish<br><br>
Patent Applications Nos. PA 2000 00734, PA 2000 01360, PA 2000 01361, and PA 2001 00477. Non-limiting examples include [L305V]-FVIIa, [L305V/M306D/D309S]-FVIIa, [L305l]-FVIIa, [L305T&gt;FVila, [F374P]-FVila, [V158T/M298Q]-FV!la, [V158D/E296V/M29SQ]-FV!!a and [K337A]-FVl!a.<br>
In the present context the three-letter or one-letter indications of the amino acids have been used in their conventional meaning as indicated In table 1. Unless indicated explicitly, the amino acids mentioned herein are L-amino acids. It is to be understood, that the first letter in, for example, K337 represent the amino acid naturally present at the indicated position wiid-type factor VII, and that, for example, [K337AJ-FVlla designates the FVll-variant wherein the amino acid represented by the one-letter code K naturally present in the indicated position is replaced by the amino acid represented by the one-letter code A,<br><br>
The term "factor Vila" or "FVIIa" may be used interchangeably. The term factor Vila includes zymogen factor VII (single-chain factor VII). The term "factor XIIP or "FXIII" may be used inter* changeable The term "factor VIII" orTVlll" may be used interchangeably.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that substitutions can be made outside the regions critical to the function of the factor Vila or factor Xlll-molecule and still result in an active polypeptide. Amino acid residues essential to the activity of the factor Vila or factor Xlll-polypeptide, and therefore preferably not subject to substitution, may be identified according to procedures known in the art, such as site-directed mutagenesis or alanine-scanning mutagenesis (see, e.g., Cunningham and Wells, 1989, Science 244: 1081-1085). In the latter technique, mutations are introduced at every positively charged residue in the molecule, and the resultant mutant molecules are tested for coagulant, respectively cross-linking activity to identify amino acid residues that are critical to the activity of the molecule. Sites of substrate-enzyme interaction can also be determined by analysis of the three-dimensional structure as determined by such techniques as nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, crystallography or photoaffinity labelling (see, e.g., de Vos et a/., 1992, Science 255: 306-<br><br>
312; Smith et a/., 1992, Journal of Molecular Biology 224: 899-904; Wlodaver et a/., 1992, FEBS Letters 309: 59-64),<br>
The introduction of a mutation into the nucleic acid sequence to exchange one nucleotide for another nucleotide may be accomplished by site-directed mutagenesis using any of the methods known in the art. Particularly useful is the procedure that utilizes a super coiled, double stranded DNA vector with an insert of interest and two synthetic primers containing the desired mutation. The oli¬gonucleotide primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, extend during tempera¬ture cycling by means of Pfu DNA polymerase. On incorporation of the primers, a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks is generated. Following temperature cycling, the product is treated with Dpnl, which is specific for methylated and hemimethylated DNA to digest the parental DNA template and to select for mutation-containing synthesized DNA, Other procedures known in the art for creat¬ing, identifying and isolating variants may also be used, such as, for example, gene shuffling or phage display techniques.<br>
The term "factor VII!" or "FVIir includes activated factor Vlil (designated factor Villa), vari¬ants and truncated forms of factor VIII retaining their characteristic coagulant activity, in one embodi¬ment, the factor Vlli is human factor VIII.<br>
The term TFPl inhibitor" means compounds inhibiting the ant(-coagu(ative actively of TFPI (tissue factor pathway inhibitor). The term includes compounds such as those disclosed in European Patent No. 558 529, WO 96/28153 and US 5,622,988, TFPI" and "EPP (extrinsic pathway inhibitor) may be used interchangeably.<br>
Within the present invention an "effective amount' of a factor Vila and an "effective amount" of a factor XII! is defined as the amount of a factor Vila and a factor Xlil sufficient to prevent or reduce bleeding or blood loss, so as to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the disease and its complications.<br>
The amount of a factor Vila and the amount of a factor XIII administered according to the present invention may vary from a ratio of about 1:100 to about 100:1 {pg factor Vila: //g factor Xll!)*<br>
In this context, "subjects with an impaired thrombin generation" means subjects who cannot generate a full thrombin burst on the activated platelet surface and includes subjects having a generation of thrombin less that the thrombin-generation in subjects having a fully functioning, normal haemostatic system, including a normal amount and function of coagulation factors, platelets and fibrinogen, and includes subjects lacking FIX and/or FVIII (haemophilia A and B) or having defective FIX and/or FVIII or having inhibitors against FIX and/or FVIII; subjects lacking FXl; subjects with a lowered number of platelets or platelets with a defective function (e.g., thrombocytopenia or thrombasthenia Glanzmann or subjects with excessive bleeds); and subjects having lowered levels of prothrombin, FX or FVl I.<br>
Subjects with lowered plasma concentrations of fibrinogen (e.g., multitransfused subjects as a consequence of multiple trauma or extensive surgery) do also suffer from the formation of looser and unstable fibrin plugs which are easily dissolved.<br><br>
The term "full haemostasis" means the formation of a stable and solid fibrin clot or plug at the site of injury which effectively stops the bleeding and which is not readily dissolved by the fibrinolytic system.<br>
The term "activity of factor Vila" or "factor Vila-activity" means the ability to generate thrombin; the term also Includes the ability to generate thrombin on the surface of activated platelets in the absence of tissue factor.<br>
The term "enhancement of the normal haemostatic system" means an enhancement of the ability to generate thrombin.<br>
As used herein the term "bleeding disorder" reflects any defect, congenital, acquired or induced, of cellular or molecular origin that is manifested in bleedings. Examples are clotting factor deficiencies (e.g. haemophilia A and B or deficiency of coagulation factors XI or VII), clotting factor inhibitors, de¬fective platelet function, thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand's disease.<br>
The term "bleeding episodes" is meant to include uncontrolled and excessive bleeding which is a major problem both in connection with surgery and other forms of tissue damage. Uncon¬trolled and excessive bleeding may occur in subjects having a basically normal coagulation system (these subjects do however develop a coagulopathy as a result of the bleeding - dilution of coagula¬tion proteins, increased fibrinolysis and lowered platelets due to a dilution effect of the bleeding) and subjects having coagulation or bleeding disorders. Clotting factor deficiencies (haemophilia A and B, deficiency of coagulation factors XI or VII) or clotting factor inhibitors may be the cause of bleeding disorders. Excessive bleedings also occur in subjects with a normally functioning blood clotting cas-cade (no clotting factor deficiencies or -inhibitors against any of the coagulation factors) and may be caused by a defective platelet function, thrombocytopenia or von Willebrand's disease. In such cases, the bleedings may be likened to those bleedings caused by haemophilia because the haemostatic system, as in haemophilia, lacks or has abnormal essential clotting "compounds" (such as platelets or von Wiilebrand factor protein) that causes major bleedings. In subjects who experience extensive tis¬sue damage in association with surgery or vast trauma, the normal haemostatic mechanism may be overwhelmed by the demand of immediate haemostasis and they may develop bleeding in spite of a basically (pre-trauma) normal haemostatic mechanism. Achieving satisfactory haemostasis also is a problem when bleedings occur in organs such as the brain, inner ear region and eyes with limited possibility for surgical haemostasis. The same problem may arise in the process of taking biopsies from various organs (liver, lung, tumour tissue, gastrointestinal tract) as well as in laparoscopic surgery. Common for all these situations is the difficulty to provide haemostasis by surgical techniques (sutures, clips, etc.) which also is the case when bleeding is diffuse (haemorrhagic gastritis and profuse uterine bleeding). Acute and profuse bleedings may also occur in subjects on anticoagulant therapy in whom a defective haemostasis has been induced by the therapy given. Such subjects may need surgical interventions in case the anticoagulant effect has to be counteracted rapidly. Radical retropubic prostatectomy is a commonly performed procedure for subjects with localized prostate cancer. The operation Is frequently complicated by significant and sometimes massive blood loss. The considerable blood loss during prostatectomy is mainly related to the complicated anatomical<br><br>
situation, with various densely vascularized sites that are not easily accessible for surgical haemostasis, and which may result in diffuse bleeding from a large area. Another situation that may cause problems in the case of unsatisfactory haemostasis is when subjects with a normal haemostatic mechanism are given anticoagulant therapy to prevent thromboembolic disease. Such therapy may include heparin, other forms of proteoglycans, warfarin or other forms of vitamin K-antagonists as well as aspirin and other platelet aggregation inhibitors.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the bleeding is associated with haemophilia. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with haemophilia with aquired inhibitors. !n another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with thrombocytopenia. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with von Willebrand's disease. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with severe tissue damage, in another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with severe trauma. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with surgery. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with laparoscopic surgery. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with haemorrhagic gastritis. In another embodiment, the bleeding is profuse uterine bleeding. In another embodiment, the bleeding is occurring in organs with a limited possibility for mechanical haemostasis. In another embodiment, the bleeding is occum'ng in the brain, inner ear region or eyes. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with the process of taking biopsies. In another embodiment, the bleeding is associated with anticoagulant therapy.<br>
The composition according to the invention may further comprise a TFPl-inhibitor. Such a composition should preferable be administered to subjects having haemophilia A or B.<br>
The composition according to the invention may further comprise a factor VIII. Such a composition should preferably be administered to subjects who do not have inhibitors to factor VIII,<br>
In this context, the term "treatment" is meant to include both prevention of an expected bleeding, such as, for example, in surgery, and regulation of an already occurring bleeding, such as, for example, in haemophilia or in trauma, with the purpose of inhibiting or minimising the bleeding. Prophylactic administration of a factor Vila and a factor XIII is thus included in the term "treatment".<br>
The term "subject" as used herein is intended to mean any animal, in particular mammals, such as humans, and may, where appropriate, be used interchangeably with the term "patient".<br>

Preparation of compounds<br>
Human purified factor Vila suitable for use in the present invention is preferably made by DNA recombinant technology, e.g. as described by Hagen et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. USA 83:2412-2416,1986 or as described in European Patent No, 200.421 (ZymoGenetics, Inc.). factor Vila produced by recombinant technology may be authentic factor Vila or a more or less modified factor Vila provided that such a factor Vila has substantially the same biological activity for blood coagulation as authentic factor Vila (wild-type factor Vila). Such a modified factor Vila may be produced by modifying the nucleic acid sequence encoding wild-type factor VII either by altering the amino acid codons or by removal of some of the amino acid codons in the nucleic acid encoding the natural factor VII by known means, e.g. by site-specific mutagenesis.<br>
Factor VII may also be produced by the methods described by Broze and Majerus, J.Siol.Chem. 255(4): 1242-1247, 1980 and Hedner and KisieJ. J.CIin.lnvest. 71:1836-1841.1983. These methods yield factor VII without detectable amounts of other blood coagulation factors. An even further purified factor VII preparation may be obtained by including an additional gel filtration as the final purification step. factor VII is then converted into activated factor Vila by known means, e.g. by several different plasma proteins, such as factor Xlla, IX a or Xa. Alternatively, as described by Bjoern et al. (Research Disclosure, 269 September 1986, pp. 564-565), factor VII may be activated by passing it through an ion-exchange chromatography column, such as Mono Q® (Pharmacia fine Chemicals) or the like.<br>
Factor XIII for use within the present Invention may be prepared from plasma according to known methods, such as those disclosed by Cooke and Holbrook (Biochem. J. 141:79-84,1974) and Curtis and Lorand (Methods Enzymoi. 45:177-191,1976), incorporated herein by reference. The a2 dimer form of factor XIII may be prepared from placenta as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,904,751; 3,931,399; 4,597,899 and 4,285,933, incorporated herein by reference. It is preferred, however, to use recombinant factor XIII so as to avoid to the use of biood- or tissue-derived products that carry a risk of disease transmission. Methods for preparing recombinant factor XIII are known in the art. See, for example, Davie et al., EP 268,772; Grundmann et al., AU-A-69896/87; Bishop et al., Biochemistry 1990, 29:1861-1869; Board et al., Thromb. Haemost. 1990, 63: 235-240; Jagadeeswaran et al., Gene 1990, 86: 279-283; and Broker et al., FEBS Lett. 19*89, 248:105-110, which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. Within one embodiment, the factor XIII a2 dimer is prepared cytoplasmi-caliy in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as disclosed In copending U.S. patent application Ser.<br><br>
No, 07/741,263t incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). The cells are harvested and lysed, and a cleared lysate is prepared. The lysate is fractionated by anion exchange chromatography at neutral to slightly alkaline pH using a column of derivatized agarose, such as DEAE Fast-Flow Sepha-rose.TM. (Pharmacia) or the like, factor Xllf is then precipitated from the column eluate by concentrat¬ing the eluate and adjusting the pH to 5.2-5.5, such as by diafiltration against ammonium succinate buffer. The precipitate is then dissolved and further purified using conventional chromatographic tech¬niques, such as gel filtration and hydrophobic interaction chromatography.<br>
As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, it is preferred to use factor XIII and factor Vila proteins syngeneic with the subject in order to reduce the risk of inducing an immune response. Preparation and characterization of non-human factor XIII has been disclosed by Nakamura et af. (J, Biochem. 78:1247-1266,1975), The present invention also encompasses the use of such factor XIII and factor Vila proteins within veterinary procedures.<br>
Administration and pharmaceutical compositions<br>
For treatment in connection with deliberate interventions, the factor Vll and the factor XIII will typically be administered within about 24 hours prior to performing the intervention, and for as much as 7 days or more thereafter. Administration as a coagulant can be by a variety of routes as described herein.<br>
The dose of the factor VII ranges from about 0.05 mg to about 500 mg/day, e.g., from about 1 mg to about 200 mg/day, or, e.g., from about 10 mg to about 175 mg/day for a 70-kg subject as loading and maintenance doses, depending on the weight of the subject, the condition and the severity of the condition.<br>
The dose of the factor XIII ranges from about 0.05 mg to about 500 mg/day, e,gM from about 1 mg to about 200 mg/day, or, e,g„ from about 10 mg to about 175 mg/day for a 70-kg subject as loading and maintenance doses, depending on the weight of the subject, the condition and the severity of the condition.<br>
The compositions and kits of the present invention are useful within human and veterinary medicine; such as, for example, in the treatment or prophylaxis of subjects suffering from bleeding episodes or coagulative disorders. For use within the present invention, the factor Vila and factor XIII are formulated, optionally with a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier. Preferably, the pharmaceutical compositions are administered parenteraily, i.e., intravenously, subcutaneously, or intramuscularly, or it may be administered by continuous or pulsatile infusion.<br>
Formulations may further include one or more diluents, emulsifiers, preservatives, buffers, excipients, etc. and may be provided in such forms as liquids, powders, emulsions, controlled release, etc. One skilled in this art may formulate the compositions of the invention an appropriate manner, and in accordance with accepted practices, such as those disclosed in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. Gennaro, ed,, Mack Publishing Co., Easton, PA, 1990. The compositions for parenteral administration comprise a factor Vll and a factor XIII in combination with, preferably dissolved in, a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier, preferably an aqueous carrier. A variety of aqueous carriers may<br><br>
be used, such as water, buffered water, 0.4% saline, 0.3% glycine and the like. The factor VII variants of the invention can also be formulated into liposome preparations for delivery or targeting to the sites of injury. Liposome preparations are generally described in, e.g., U.S. 4,837,028, U.S. 4,501,728, and U.S. 4,975,282.<br>
A typical pharmaceutical composition for intravenous infusion could be made up to contain 250 ml of sterile Ringer's solution and 10 mg of a factor Vila and/or a factor XIII, Actual methods for preparing parenteraily administrate compositions will be known or apparent to those skilled in the art and are described in more detail in, for example, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences. 18th ed., Mack Publishing Company, Easton, PA (1990).<br>
In short, pharmaceutical compositions suitable for use according to the present invention is made by mixing a factor Vila, or a factor XIII, or a factor Vila in combination with a factor XIII, preferably in purified form, with suitable adjuvants and a suitable carrier or diluent. Suitable physiological acceptable carriers or diluents include sterile water and saline. The compositions may contain pharmaceutical^ acceptable auxiliary substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents and the like, for example, sodium acetate, sodium lactate, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, calcium chloride, etc. Suitable adjuvants also include calcium, proteins (e.g. albumins), or other inert peptides (e.g. glycylgiycine) or amino acids (e.g. glycine, or histidine) to stabilise the purified factor Vila and/or factor XIII. Other physiological acceptable adjuvants are non-reducing sugars, polyalcohols (e.g. sorbitol, mannitol or glycerol), polysaccharides such as low molecular weight dextrins, detergents (e.g. polysorbate) and antioxidants (e.g. bisulfite and ascorbate), The adjuvants are generally present in a concentration of from 0.001 to 4% w/v. The pharmaceutical composition may also contain protease inhibitors, e.g. aprotinin or tranexamic acid, and preserving agents. Furthermore, the preparation may also contain a TFPI-inhibitor and/or factor VIII.<br>
The compositions may be sterilised by conventional, well-known sterilisation techniques. The resulting aqueous solutions may be packaged for use or filtered under aseptic conditions and iyophWsed, the iyophiiised preparation being combined with a sterile aqueous solution prior to administration.<br>
The concentration of a factor Vila, a factor XIII, or a factor Vila in combination with a factor Xlll in these formulations can vary widely, i.e., from less than about 0.5% by weight, usually at or at least about 1 % by weight to as much as 15 or 20% by weight and will be selected primarily by fluid volumes, viscosities, etc., in accordance with the particular mode of administration selected.<br>
Administration by injection or infusion, in particular injection, is preferred. Thus, the factor Vila and the factor XIII are prepared in a form suitable for intravenous administration, such as a preparation that is either a dissolved Iyophiiised powder or a liquid formulation containing both the factor Vila and the factor XIII in one dosage form, or a dissolved Iyophiiised powder or a liquid formulation containing the factor Vila in one dosage form and dissolved Iyophiiised powder or a liquid formulation containing the factor Xlll in another dosage form.<br>
Local delivery of a factor Vila and a factor Xlll, such as, for example, topical application may be carried out, for example, by means of a spray, perfusion, double balloon catheters, stent,<br><br>
incorporated into vascular grafts or stents, hydrogels used to coat balloon catheters, or other well established methods. For ambulatory subjects requiring daily maintenance levels, the factor Vila and the factor XIII may be administered by continuous infusion using e.g. a portable pump system. In any event, the pharmaceutical compositions should provide a quantity of a factor Vila and a factor XIII sufficient to effectively treat the subject.<br>
The combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII shows a synergistic effect \n an In vitro clot firmness- and fibrinolysis time-assay. Moreover, the combination of a factor Vila and a factor XIII shows a synergistic effect in forming stable fibrin clots, increasing the half-clot lysis time, increasing clot strength and increasing resistance to fibrinolysis.<br>
The compositions containing a factor VII and a factor Xlll can be administered for prophylactic and/or therapeutic treatments. In therapeutic applications, compositions are administered to a subject already suffering from a disease, as described above, in an amount sufficient to cure, alleviate or partially arrest the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as an "effective amount" or "therapeutically effective amount0. As will be understood by the person skilled in the art, amounts effective for this purpose will depend on the severity of the disease or injury as well as the weight and general state of the subject It must be kept in mind that the materials of the present invention may generally be employed in serious disease or injury states, that is, life threatening or potentially life threatening situations. In such cases, in view of the minimisation of extraneous substances and general* lack of immunogenicity of factor Vila and factor Xlll in humans, it is possible and may be felt desirable by the treating physician to administer a substantial excess of these compositions.<br>
In prophylactic applications, compositions containing a factor Vila and a factor Xlll are administered to a subject susceptible to or otherwise at risk of a disease state or injury to enhance the' subject's own coagulative capability. Such an amount is defined to be a "prophylactically effective dose."<br>
Single or multiple administrations of the compositions can be carried out with dose levels and patterns being selected by the treating physician. The compositions may be administered one or more times per day or week. An effective amount of such a pharmaceutical composition is the amount that provides a clinically significant effect against bleeding episodes. Such amounts will depend, in part, on the particular condition to be treated, age, weight, and general health of the subject, and other factors evident to those skilled in the art.<br>
The composition is generally administered in one single dose before the expected bleeding or at the start of the bleeding. It may however also be given in multiple doses, preferably with intervals of 2-4-6-12 hour, depending on the dose given and the condition of the subject<br>
The composition may be in the form of a single preparation comprising both a factor Vila and a factor Xlll in suitable concentrations. The composition may also be in the form of a kit consisting of a first unit dosage form comprising a factor Vila and a second unit dosage form comprising a factor XIII and, optionally, one or more further unit dosage forms comprising a factor VIII and/or an TFPI inhibitor. In this case, the factor Vila and the factor XIII should be administered sequentially, preferably within about 1-2<br><br>
hours of each other, for example within 30 minutes of each other or, preferably, within 10 minutes or, more preferred, within 5 minutes of each other. Either of the two unit dosage forms can be administered<br>
first<br>
Since the present invention relates to the prevention or treatment of bleeding episodes or for coagulative treatment by treatment with a combination of active ingredients that may be administered separately, the invention also relates to combining separate pharmaceutical compositions in kit form. The kit includes at least two separate pharmaceutical compositions. The kit includes container means for containing the separate compositions such as a divided bottle or a divided foil packet. Typically the kit includes directions for the administration of the separate components. The kit form Is particularly advantageous when the separate components are preferably administered in different dosage forms, are administered at different dosage intervals, or when titration of the individual components of the combination is desired by the prescribing physician.<br>
Assays<br>
Test for factor Vila activity:<br>
A suitable assay for testing for factor Vila activity and thereby selecting suitable factor Vila variants can be performed as a simple preliminary in vitro test: In Vitro Hydrolysis Assay<br>
Native (wild-type) factor Vila and factor Vila variant (both hereafter referred to as "factor Vila") may be assayed for specific activities. They may also be assayed in parallel to directly compare their specific activities. The assay is carried out in a microliter plate (MaxiSorp, Nunc, Denmark). The chro-mogenic substrate D-lle-Pro-Arg-p-nitroaniiide (S-2288, Chromogenix, Sweden), final concentration 1 mM, is added to factor Vila (final concentration 100 nM) in 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0,1 M NaCI, 5 mM CaCI2 and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The absorbance at 405 nm is measured con¬tinuously in a SpectraMax™ 340 plate reader (Molecular Devices, USA). The absorbance developed during a 20-minute incubation, after subtraction of the absorbance in a blank well containing no en¬zyme, is used to calculate the ratio between the activities of variant and wild-type factor Vila:<br>
Ratio - (A^osnm factor Vila variant)/(A405 nm factor Vila wild-type).<br>
Based thereon, factor Vila variants with an activity comparable to or higher than native factor Vila may be identified, such as, for example, variants where the ratio between the activity of the vari¬ant and the activity of native factor VII shown in Fig. 1 is around, versus above 1.0.<br>
The activity of factor Vila or factor Vila variants may also be measured using a physiological substrate such as factor X, suitably at a concentration of 100-1000 nM, where the factor Xa generated is measured after the addition of a suitable chromogenic substrate (eg. S-2765). In addition, the activity assay may be run at physiological temperature.<br>
The ability of factor Vila or factor Vila variants to generate thrombin can also be measured io an assay comprising all relevant coagulation factors and inhibitors at physiological concentrations (minus factor VIII when mimicking hemophilia A conditions) and activated platelets (as described on p. 543 in Monroe et aL (1997) Brit. J. Haematol. 99, 542-547 which is hereby incorporated as reference).<br><br>
Test for factor XIII activity:<br>
A suitable assay for testing for factor Xill transglutaminase activity and thereby selecting suitable factor XII! variants can be performed as a simple in vitro test as described, for example, in Methods of Enzymology, Vol. 45 (1976), Proteolytic Enzymes, Part B, pages 177-191 (Ed. Lorand, L),<br>
The present invention is further illustrated by the following examples, which, however, are not to be construed as limiting the scope of protection. The features disclosed in the foregoing description and in the following examples may, both separately and in any combination thereof, be material for realizing the invention in diverse forms thereof.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1.<br>
factor XIII enhances factor Vila-induced fibrin clot formation,<br>
Citrated normal human plasma (NHP) was diluted 1/10 in buffer containing 20 nM HEPES, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCi2, pH 7.4 in a micro titer well (total volume 250 //I) and fibrin clot formation was monitored by the increase in optical density at 600 nm in a Specramax™ 340 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale CA).<br>
Spontaneous clot formation was obtained at about 2500-3000 sec. Fig. 1 shows that 10 nM recombinant factor Vila (rFVIIa) (Novo Nordisk A/S Bagsvaerd, Denmark) shortened the clotting time to 1600 sec (n =* 2). Further shortening of the clotting time was obtained when 30 nM factor XIII (FXIII) (American Diagnostica inc. Greenwich, CT) was added together with 10 nM rFVIIa (n = 3). The clot formed in the presence of FXIII was more transparent (lower maximal OD) than in its absence indicat¬ing that the addition of FXIII resulted in a more fine-meshed fibrin gel structure with thinner fibres.<br>
Example 2.<br>
The presence of supplementary factor XIII during factor Vila-induced ciot formation results In increased<br>
resistance to fibrinolytic degradation.<br>
A fibrin clot consisting of thin fibres is mechanically stronger and more difficult to degrade than a clot containing the same amount of fibrin arranged as thick fibres or less cross-linked fibres. The experiment shown in Fig. 2 illustrates that supplementary FXIII (30 nM) prolongs the fibrin clot lysis time of clots formed In the presence of rFVIIa and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA, American Diagnostica). Clot formation was induced in the presence or absence of 30 nM FXIII by addition of 25 //I NHP to 225 //120 nM HEPES, 150 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCI2l pH 7.4 containing 50 nM rFVIIa and 0.5 nM recombinant t-PA. Clot formation and subsequent ciot lysis induced by t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation was monitored by a Spectramax® 340 at 600 nm as the increase in ODeoo nm followed by re¬version of the trace to the basal level. Fig. 2 shows that the clot lysis time under these conditions was significantly prolonged by the presence of FXIII.<br><br>
Example 3.<br>
factor Vila in combination with factor XIII increases maximal clot firmness and increases ciot resis¬tance to fibrinolysis.<br>
Thrombelastograph measurements was conducted on citrated normal human plasma added 6 nM recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA, American Diagnostica) and the effect of addition of 1 nM rFVIIa (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) alone or in combination with various concentrations of factor XIII (FXIII, Haematologic Technologies, HCXIII-0160, Lot N1212,) was ana¬lyzed. Clotting was initiated by addition of Innovin (final concentration 2000-fold diluted, Dade Behring # 526945) and calcium (final concentration 15 mM) in a 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4 buffer,<br>
Thrombelastograph measurements were utilized to analyze the effect of rFVIIa and FXIII on Maximal Clot Firmness (MCF) as well as clot resistance to t-PA mediated lysis. Prior to rFVIIa and/or FXIII addition the MCF obtained was 25 mm and the time required for half the clot to be iysed was 12.3 minutes (Fig. 3). Addition of increasing concentrations of FXIII (0 - 40 nM) did not alter MCF; however, a dose-dependent prolongation of the half-ciot lysis was observed, optimal at 30 nM FXIII (half-clot lysis time: 14,3 min, Fig, 3). Similarly, rFVIIa (1 nM) addition resulted in clot protection from t-PA-mediated fibrinolysis (half-clot lysis time; 16.4 min) without any effect on MCF (Fig. 3). However, upon addition of rFVIIa (1 nM) together with FXIII (30 nM) an increase En the MCF (29 mm), as well as a profound protection from fibrinolysis (half-clot lysis time; 27.1 min) was observed (Fig, 3). Taken to¬gether, these results demonstrate that rFVIIa and FXIII addition to plasma in a synergistic fashion im¬prove clot mechanical strength and resistance to t-PA mediated fibrinolysis.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
