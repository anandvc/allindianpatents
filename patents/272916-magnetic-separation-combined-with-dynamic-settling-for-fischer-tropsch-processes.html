STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT<br>
[0001]   Not Applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates generally to the separation of liquids from solid particles contained in a multi-phase reactor effluent. More specifically, the present invention relates to a system and method for separating liquid from catalyst particles used to catalyze reactions. Still more specifically, the present invention relates to a reliable and efficient means to separate liquid from solid particles having magnetic properties. Description of the Related Art<br>
[0003] Separation of liquid from solid catalyst material used in multi-phase reactors is of paramount importance to many processes and has been intensely studied. For example, the catalyst-liquid separation is one of the most critical steps in the application of slurry type reactors for Fischer-Tropsch (hereinafter FT) processes. Only if this separation is effective is the application of such reactors successful. Separation techniques typically include settling and filtration. Additionally, combinations thereof have been proposed. Magnetic separation as a stand alone process has been proposed.<br>
[0004] Cross-flow filtration is a commonly used method. Mild cross flow filtration has been proposed, and this method claims the cake of catalyst particles formed on the surface of filter media acts as the primary barrier to prevent solids from passing through the filter media thus contaminating the liquid. For example, U.S. Patent No. 6,929,754 discloses a solid/liquid separation system and method for removing wax products from a slurry used in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. The preferred embodiments of U.S. Patent No. 6,929,754 are characterized by a solid/liquid separation system that removes liquid products from a slurry by drawing the fluid across a filter medium composed of a filter cake disposed on a substrate. In the preferred embodiments, the filter cake is desirable and performs the majority of the filtration. [0005] The primary disadvantage of filtration methods is that the filter media is prone to clogging, or plugging by small particles resulting from physical and chemical attrition of the catalyst during use. Filtration media are designed for a certain micrometer rating, say 20 micrometers, so that any particles larger than 20 micrometers will be retained on the surface of<br>
media. Particles smaller than 20 micrometers will travel through the media and may exit or get stuck within the pores of the filter medium due to agglomeration, shape, and other factors. Although a backwash method may be used to unplug the medium, with time on stream, backwash may become less effective and eventually the filter elements must be removed from the system and replaced. Fischer-Tropsch catalysts, typically iron-based or cobalt-based, are prone to attrition. Typical fresh catalyst particles are in the range of from 20 micrometers to 100 micrometers. Attrition leads to the formation of particles less than 20 micrometers in size, with some particles in the sub-micron size range. These smaller particles may either clog or plug the filter media, or change the cake composition in such a way that the filter media becomes impermeable, and compacted. Compact cakes cause the need for higher pressure drop across the media to get the same volume of liquid across the filter. This leads to a vicious cycle of higher pressure drop leading to an even more compacted cake and/or media plugging which will render the system ineffective.<br>
[0006] Settling is another method proposed to separate solid material from liquids in FT processes and other multi-phase reactor systems. Typical settlers are of two types: vertical settlers and inclined settlers (also known as lamellar settlers). United States Patent No. 6,833,078 discloses a solid/liquid separation system and methods for separating liquid products from catalyst fines from a slurry used in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. A settling system continuously or intermittently removes catalyst fines from the slurry and is coupled with catalyst/liquid separation system that separates liquid products from the slurry. [0007] United States Patent 6,068,760 discloses a catalyst/wax separation device for slurry Fischer-Tropsch reactor whereby catalyst particles are separated from the wax in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor by feeding a portion of the reactor slurry to a dynamic settler which does not require any pump. As the slurry flows down a pipe in the center of the settler, the slurry flows into the surrounding annular region at the bottom of the settler. The heavier catalyst particles settle down and are removed as the slurry at the bottom of the settler is recycled back to the reactor. The wax rises up in the annular section and this clarified wax is removed by a wax outlet pipe.<br>
[0008] In U.S. Patent No. 6,730,221, Bonn et al. describe a method whereby catalyst particles are separated from the wax in a reactor slurry reactor by feeding a portion of the slurry to a dynamic settler. Heavier catalyst particles settle and are removed as the slurry at the bottom of the settler is recycled back to the reactor. Clarified wax is removed at the top of the settler. A multi-channel baffle prevents turbulence, improving retention of the desired heavier catalyst particles.<br>
09] The design of dynamic inclined settlers is such that they allow higher liquid removal rates than similarly sized vertical settlers. In U.S. Patent No. 7,078,439, Odueyungbo, et al. July 18, 2006 disclose systems and methods for catalyst/hydrocarbon product separation from a FT product slurry. The preferred embodiments in U.S. Patent No. 7,078,439 are characterized by a separation system that uses a sedimentation chamber, which contains at least one inclined channel that enhances the settling of particles within the slurry. The inclined channel may be provided by a structure selected from the group consisting of tube, pipe, conduit, sheets, trays, walls, plates, and combinations thereof.<br>
[0010] In settlers, liquid is typically withdrawn from the top section of the settler. The particle settling and removal rates are dependent on particle settling velocity, which is dependent on particle diameter. The design of settlers is to remove a specified range of particle sizes or larger. Particles in the liquid change size due to attrition over time, as they decrease in size, they leave the settler with the liquid withdrawn, thus contaminating the liquid. This renders the settler which is designed for a particular range of solid particles ineffective. In a FT process, any time catalyst particles leave the reactor, it not only contaminates the liquid product, but decreases the catalyst inventory in the reactor; both may be detrimental for the process economics. Another problem with settlers is that mixing due to convective flow may occur within the settler, lifting particles upward and contaminating the overflow (i.e. the liquid withdrawn from the top section of the vessel).<br>
[0011] Reduction of solid catalyst particle size with time in a multiphase reactor or slurry bubble column reactor (due to physical and/or chemical attrition) causes a settler with a certain particle size removal to become ineffective. At near constant operating conditions (e.g. pressure, temperature, liquid composition, etc.), a settler can be designed to remove a certain amount of liquids allowing for the solids to settle and follow the slurry path (underflow of the settler) to get a liquid as the overflow of the settler almost free of solid particles. This design works provided the minimum size of the particles for which the settler was designed remains constant. If the minimum size starts to shift to smaller particles, complete separation of solid particles will not occur and some particles will leave with the liquid in the overflow of the settler. [0012] Magnetic separation has been proposed as a stand alone system to separate solids and liquids in FT reactor systems. This system consists of passing the slurry containing liquids and solids to be separated through a vessel with magnetized walls. The solids with magnetic properties will accumulate on or near the walls or along magnetic fields created inside the settler vessel, fall vertically to the bottom of the vessel, and continue to travel in the direction of the slurry stream. Thus the solids can be separated from the liquids which can be withdrawn from<br>
to top of the vessel.  This technique has been shown to be effective for the removal of solid<br>
particulates on the small micron to sub-micron scale range.<br>
[0013]   Accordingly, a need exists for an efficient and reliable system and method for separating<br>
solid catalyst particles from a slurry.   The system and method should desirably continue<br>
functioning even when minimum particle size shifts to smaller particle size due to catalyst<br>
attrition.<br>

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS [0035]   For a more detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the present invention, reference will now be made to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br>
[0036]   Figure 1 is a schematic of a Fischer-Tropsch process incorporating a magnetic separation and settling system (MSS) according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. [0037]   Figure 2 is a detailed schematic of a magnetic dynamic settling vessel of the MSS system of Figure 1.<br>
NOTATION AND NOMENCLATURE [0038]   Certain terms are used throughout the following descriptions and claims to refer to particular system components.    This document does not intend to distinguish between components that differ in name but not function.<br>
[0039] In the following discussion and in the claims, the terms "including" and "comprising" are used in an open-ended fashion, and thus should be interpreted to mean "including, but not limited to.<br>
 [0040] Use of the terms 'magnetic dynamic settling vessel' and 'magnetic dynamic settler' does not imply that all or even a majority of the settling vessel is magnetic, rather it is used to mean that the settling vessel or dynamic settler comprises at least one magnetic component or the use of magnetic fields inside the settler to enhance the settling process. [0041] The term 'slurry' is used to refer to fluid comprising solid particles. [0042] When a stream is referred to as a 'solids' stream, it is to be understood that the stream comprises liquid as well as solids. The term 'solids' is used to indicate which outlet stream of a vessel comprises a greater quantity of solids, and differentiates it from a 'liquid product' stream, which comprises less, if any, solid material.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION Overview<br>
[0043] Herein disclosed are a system and method for separating solid particles from a fluid stream. The system and method combine magnetic separation and dynamic settling and may be particularly effective for separating solid catalyst particles comprising at least one metal from a fluid stream. The unique combination of magnetic separation with settling may provide a liquid essentially free of solid particles.<br>
[0044] Catalysts typically used in FT processes are iron-based and cobalt-based. These catalysts have magnetic properties and become attracted to magnetized surfaces. By applying magnetization to appropriate surfaces of a settler and/or by creating a magnetic field inside the settler vessel the mixing in the bulk of the liquid will be minimized as the particles will tend to deposit on the surfaces or agglomerate along the magnetic fields rendering the settler much more effective as agglomerated particles settle at much higher velocities than individuals particles allowing for a higher rate of liquid withdrawal and/or enhanced liquid quality (lesser amount of solids in product liquid stream). Also, the smaller particles generated by attrition over time will be most attracted to the magnetized surfaces or may agglomerate along the magnetic fields created inside the settler avoiding liquid overflow contamination. In this way the settler does not become ineffective by the change of particle size distribution over time or at least it effects are minimized. System<br>
[0045] The magnetic separation and settling system (hereinafter MSS), which may be positioned downstream of a reactor, may be particularly suitable for use in a Fischer-Tropsch (hereinafter FT) synthesis process. Although the herein disclosed system and method are suitable for solid/liquid separation within many disparate processes involving multi-phase<br>
fraction, the following description will be made with reference to the FT reaction. It is to be understood that the present disclosure is equally suitable to other processes wherein the separation of particles comprising a magnetic component from liquids is desired. [0046] Figure 1 illustrates an embodiment of a FT system 200 comprising MSS 100 (magnetic separation and settling system), multi-phase reactor 10, and vapor/liquid-slurry separator 45, which may also be referred to as a slurry degasser, (the liquid exiting the reactor comprises solid catalyst particles, and, therefore is referred to as a slurry). In embodiments, MSS 100 comprises magnetic dynamic settling vessel (hereinafter MDSV) 60. Optionally, as discussed further hereinbelow, MSS 100 further comprises secondary separation system (hereinafter SS system) 95. Optionally, MSS 100 comprises dynamic settler (hereinafter DS) 70, as further discussed hereinbelow.<br>
[0047] Multi-phase FT synthesis reactor 10 converts a synthesis gas feedstream 20 (synthesis gas is a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen) into liquid hydrocarbons of various forms. Clarified liquid hydrocarbon products 120, from which catalyst has been removed, are recovered from FT system 200. As mentioned hereinabove, typical catalysts used for FT reaction are based on iron or cobalt. FT is commonly used to produce a synthetic petroleum substitute, typically from coal, bio-mass or natural gas, for use as synthetic lubrication oil or as synthetic fuel (mainly diesel, jet fuel and naphtha). In embodiments, reactor 10 comprises a multi-phase reactor.<br>
[0048] In embodiments, the catalyst is a FT catalyst comprising at least one metal selected from the group consisting of iron and cobalt. In embodiments, the FT catalyst comprises particles substantially in the range of from about 10µm to about 200µm. In some embodiments, the FT catalyst comprises particles substantially in the range of from about 20um to about 150µm. A small amount of catalyst particles may have a size of less than 10 microns or more than 150 microns. Due to physical and/or chemical attrition, smaller particles may be generated as the catalyst is activated and/or with time on line. In embodiments, a minority of the catalyst particles have a size of less than 10 microns.<br>
[0049] In embodiments of MSS 100, reactor 10 is a FT synthesis reactor. Reactor 10 comprises FT gas exit 31 and FT liquid exit 41. FT liquid exit 41 and FT gas exit 31 are commonly positioned in the top portion of multi-phase reactor 10, with FT gas exit 31 at or near the top of multi-phase reactor 10 and FT liquid exit 41 at or near the top of liquid slurry 11. [0050] In embodiments, FT system 200 further comprises degasser or vapor/liquid-slurry separator (hereinafter VLS) 45 which may be any vapor/liquid separator known to those of skill in the art. In embodiments, VLS inlet 44 is below the level of reactor liquid exit 41 and the flow<br>
gravity assisted as the density of the slurry within reactor 10 is less than the density of the liquid/slurry column after the vapor/liquid-slurry separator. In embodiments, the flow of effluent from reactor 10 to VLS 45 is pump-assisted. VLS vapor stream 50 exits VLS 45 via VLS gas exit 43. In embodiments, VLS liquid exit 42 is fluidly connected to MDSV slurry inlet 54. Catalyst is removed from FT effluent 40 comprising catalyst slurry to yield clarified liquid hydrocarbon products 120. This separation of solid catalyst particles from liquid hydrocarbon product is performed with MSS 100. Recovered concentrated catalyst slurry may be recycled to reactor 10.<br>
[0051] In embodiments, the ratio of MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 to MDSV liquid product stream 85 is in the range of from about 5 to about 20. Alternatively, the ratio of the flow in MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 (underflow) to that of MDSV liquid product stream 85 (overflow) is in the range of from 10 to about 20.<br>
[0052] MSS 100 comprises magnetic dynamic settling vessel 60 which separates catalyst from liquid wax product via a combination of magnetic fields and/or magnetic components along with dynamic settling. U.S. Patent Nos. 6,068,760 and 6,730,221, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes, disclose dynamic settling vessels for separating catalyst particles from wax in a Fischer-Tropsch reactor by feeding a portion of the reactor slurry to the dynamic settler. In embodiments, MDSV 60 comprises a dynamic settling vessel as disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,068,760 or 6,730,221 and further comprising a magnetic field for enhancing separation of catalyst particles from the product wax. [0053] Figure 2 is a schematic of an embodiment of MDSV 60. In embodiments, MDSV 60 is roughly conically shaped, as shown in the depiction of Figure 2. In some embodiments, MDSV 60 comprises vertical walls 66 along the top portion 62 and inclined walls 64 within a bottom portion 63. In embodiments, the bottom portion 63 of MDSV 60 is frustoconical. [0054] Magnetic dynamic settling vessel 60 comprises at least one magnetic field therein. Without wishing to be limited by theory, the presence of a magnetic field(s) in MDSV 60 serves to agglomerate the solid particles. The performance of a settling process depends on the settling velocity which is proportional to the particle size. When particles agglomerate, the agglomerated particles behave as larger particles, and settle with a greater settling velocity. The combination of dynamic settling with magnetic separation thus increases the effectiveness of separation of solid particles from the product stream.<br>
[0055] In embodiments the at least one magnetic field is created within the vessel in the slurry body (slurry volume) with no magnetized component within the magnetic dynamic settling vessel. The at least one magnetic field may be throughout substantially the entire slurry volume<br>
of the MDSV. In preferred embodiments, the at least one magnetic field is throughout substantially the entirety of the bottom section of the slurry volume of the MDSV. The at least one magnetic field preferably comprises at least a portion of the lower 20% of the slurry volume of the MDSV. In some embodiments, the at least magnetic field comprises at least a portion of the lower 50% of the slurry volume of the MDSV.<br>
[0056] In embodiments, the magnetic field within MDSV 60 is provided by at least one magnetic component selected, but not limited to, magnetic external walls, magnetic internal walls, magnetic internal baffles, magnetic internal fins, magnetic internal rods, magnetic internal plates, another magnetized internal component, and combinations thereof. In embodiments, the at least one magnetized component is an internal component. In embodiments, the at least one magnetized internal component is positioned vertically. In embodiments, at least a portion of the walls of MDSV 60 is magnetized. In embodiments, at least a portion of the lower portion 63 of MDSV 60 is magnetized. In embodiments, MDSV 60 comprises magnetized internal components positioned at an incline. In embodiments, at least a portion of MDSV vertical walls 66 is magnetized. In embodiments, at least a portion of MDSV inclined walls 64 is magnetized. [0057] As mentioned herein, in some embodiments, magnetic dynamic settling vessel 60 comprises magnetized exterior walls. In embodiments, the walls of the settling vessel are magnetized by at least one magnet. In embodiments, at least a portion of the walls of MDSV 60 are magnetized by a plurality of magnets; for example, magnets 57 in Figure 2. The catalyst particles within MDSV inlet stream 55 having magnetic properties are attracted to the magnetic surfaces of the exterior vessel walls and/or internal components and, thereby, the catalyst particles may be separated from MDSV liquid product stream 85. Magnetic fields can also be created inside the vessel (instead of or in addition to on vessel surfaces) in a way that particles start to agglomerate in the body of the slurry filled vessel, preferably near the bottom of MDSV 60 and near slurry discharge point 58. Magnetic fields may be created such that the particles agglomerate along horizontal planes or vertical planes. In embodiments, MDSV 60 further comprises inclined plates 56. In the embodiment of Figure 2, MDSV 60 comprises magnetized inclined plates 56. In embodiments, the top section of each plate/rod is magnetized. Liquid flowing parallel to the surfaces has less opportunity to carry solid particles with it as the solids particles not only fall onto the surfaces by settling but separation from the liquid is also enhanced by the attraction of the particles to the magnetic surfaces. In embodiments, MDSV 60 comprises vertical magnetized rods/plates. In embodiments, the MSS 100 comprises more than one MDSV. In embodiments, MSS 100 comprises more than one MDSV 60 with at least a portion of at least one MDSV 60 having magnetized walls.<br>
 [0058] MDSV 60 comprises at least one MDSV slurry inlet 54. MDSV 60 comprises a feed conduit 67 extending downwardly into a sealed vertical dynamic settler chamber a substantial length. In embodiments, the feed conduit is a vertical feed conduit. In embodiments, the feed conduit 67 extends at least 70% of the length 51 of MDSV 60 such that the slurry discharge point 58 is located in the lower portion 63 of MDSV 60. In embodiments, the feed conduit 67 extends at least 80% of the length 51 of MDSV 60 such that the slurry discharge point 58 is located in the lower portion 63 of MDSV 60. In embodiments, feed conduit 67 extends downwardly to within the conical zone at the bottom of MDSV 60. In embodiments, feed conduit 67 is positioned in the geometric center of MDSV 60. In some embodiments, as shown in Figure 2, feed conduit 67 is located at one side of MDSV 60 and the vessel further comprises internal plates, such as internal inclined plates 56<br>
[0059] MDSV 60 further comprises at least two outlets. MDSV 60 comprises an MDSV liquid product outlet 59 from which liquid product reduced in solids content exits MDSV 60 and MDSV concentrated slurry outlet 61 from which a stream increased in solids content exits MDSV 60. In the embodiment of Figure 2, liquid product exits MDSV 60 via MDSV liquid product stream 85 which exits MDSV 60 via MDSV liquid product outlet 59. MDSV liquid product outlet 59 is located within an upper portion 62 of MDSV 60. In the embodiments of Figure 1, concentrated catalyst slurry is removed from MDSV 60 via MDSV concentrated slurry outlet 61 and MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65. Concentrated catalyst slurry is removed from a lower portion 63 of MDSV 60. In some embodiments, MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65, MDSV liquid product stream 85, or both undergo further settling or filtering processes.<br>
[0060] As mentioned hereinabove, in embodiments, feed conduit 67 is positioned near the geometric center of MDSV 60 and forms an annular region between the inner walls of the chamber and the feed conduit 67, whereby as the slurry flows into an annular region at the bottom of the settler, the heavier catalyst particles settle down aided by gravity and the magnetic field within MDSV 60 and are removed as the concentrated slurry at the bottom 63 of the settler via concentrated slurry stream 65 and concentrated slurry outlet 61. Nonmagnetic wax product rises up in the annular section and clarified wax is removed by a wax liquid product outlet pipe 59 and MDSV liquid product stream 85. In embodiments, it is envisioned that MDSV 60 comprises a plurality of liquid product outlets. The use of multiple liquid outlets may aid in minimizing/avoiding undesirable preferential liquid flow within the annular region. For example, the use of multiple outlets may be useful in embodiments in which feed conduit 67 is<br>
pitioned near the geometric center of MDSV 60 and wherein the use of a single outlet positioned off-center would lead to undesirable preferential upward liquid flow. [0061] In embodiments, MDSV 60 further comprises a multichannel baffle as described in U.S. Patent No. 6,730,221. The baffle(s) may help to prevent turbulence and/or improve retention of solid particles. The multichannel baffle may serve to divide the annular volume into plural channels. In embodiments, the maximum cross-sectional dimension of the channels is sufficiently small that natural convection flow is minimized and particle settling is promoted. In some embodiments, the multichannel baffle is positioned within the annular volume between the vessel walls 66 and the feed conduit 67. In these embodiments, wax liquid product outlet pipe 59 communicates with the annular volume above the multichannel baffle and MDSV concentrated slurry outlet 61 communicates with the annular volume below the multichannel baffle. In embodiments, channels of the multichannel baffle have hexagonal cross section. Alternatively, the channels are circular in cross section.<br>
[0062] Without wishing to be limited by theory, combining the eduction formed by the feed conduit 67 extending downwardly to within the conical bottom of MDSV 60 with the agglomeration of the particles due to magnetic field(s) within MDSV 60, leads to increased catalyst separation effectiveness. Effectiveness of catalyst settling/separation is meant to refer to an increase in wax product overflow (increase in quantity) in MDSV liquid product stream 85 for the same size vessel and/or less solid particles within MDSV liquid product stream 85 (increase in quality). The combination of dynamic settling with magnetic separation in a single vessel allows operation at a greater flow rate of MDSV liquid product stream 85 without compromising removal of solid particles from the wax product.<br>
[0063] In embodiments, MDSV 60 is capable of reducing the solids content of liquid product stream 85 to less than 5000 ppm. In embodiments, MDSV 60 is capable of reducing the solids content of liquid product stream 85 to less than 2500 ppm. In certain embodiments, MDSV 60 is capable of reducing the solids content of liquid product stream 85 to less than 1000 ppm. [0064] In embodiments, MDSV 60 is capable of reducing the solids content of liquid product stream 85 to less than about 5000ppm while operating at a liquid linear upward velocity of greater than or equal to 15cm/h. In embodiments, MDSV 60 is capable of reducing the solids content of liquid product stream 85 to less than about 5000ppm while operating at a liquid linear upward velocity of greater than or equal to 45cm/h.

In embodiments, MDSV 60 is capable of reducing the solids content of liquid product stream 85 to less than about 1000ppm while operating at a liquid linear upward velocity of greater than or equal to 90cm/h. [0067]   In embodiments, MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 is recycled to reactor 10.   In embodiments, concentrated slurry stream 65 is treated as known to those of skill in the art to further separate liquids therefrom and/or regenerate catalyst prior to recycle to reactor 10. Fischer-Tropsch catalyst may be regenerated by, for example, purging the catalyst with an inert gas or by a regenerating gas for a period of time as known to those of skill in the art. [0068]   In the embodiment of Figure 1, MSS 100 further comprises a second dynamic settler (hereinafter DS) 70 and secondary separation system 95 (both of which are optional components of MSS 100). In embodiments, DS 70 comprises a vertical settler. In some embodiments, DS 70 comprises an inclined settler.   DS 70 may comprise an integrated multi-step solid/liquid separation system. DS 70 comprises at least one DS inlet 71 and at least two DS outlets. DS 70 comprises DS liquid product outlet 73 and DS concentrated slurry outlet 72. In embodiments, DS inlet 71 is fondly connected to MDSV concentrated slurry outlet 61. In embodiments, DS concentrated slurry outlet 72 is fluidly connected to reactor 10 via reactor slurry inlet 32.   In embodiments, reactor slurry inlet 32 is positioned in a lower portion of reactor 10. DS 70 may serve to withdraw additional liquids and solid particles of a certain size via DS liquid product stream 80. The solid particles removed via DS liquid product stream 80 may comprise particles of a certain size (usually the smaller sizes) that, due to process requirements, need to be removed from FT system 200.   In the embodiment of Figure 2, MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 enters DS 70. DS concentrated slurry stream 75 is removed from DS 70 via DS concentrated slurry outlet 72.   In embodiments, concentrated slurry returns to reactor 10 via gravity driven<br>
mp.  In alternative embodiments, concentrated slurry returns to reactor 10 via pump-assisted loop. In embodiments, DS 70 is a MDSV.<br>
[0069] In embodiments, FT system 200 further comprises a de-magnetizing device downstream of MDSV 60 whereby magnetized catalyst particles in DS concentrated slurry stream 75 or MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 is de-magnetized prior to introduction into FT reactor 10. The de-magnetizing device is any device suitable to de-magnetize the catalyst and thus promoting homogeneous mixing and/or reducing agglomeration thereof. The de-magnetization device may be a magnet or coil positioned, for example, within a line carrying the catalyst to be recycled to FT reactor 10. In this manner, the magnetization on catalyst particles will be removed and thus will not adversely affect the catalyst behavior in FT reactor 10. [0070] In embodiments, MSS 100 further comprises secondary separation system 95. Optional secondary system (hereinafter OSS) 95 comprises at least one OSS inlet 91 and at least two OSS outlets.

In embodiments, secondary separation system 95 comprises a cross-flow filtration unit. In embodiments, secondary separation system 95 comprises high gradient magnetic separation. In embodiments secondary separation system 95 comprises other filtration devices including, but not limited to, press filters, sand filters, centrifugal separators, hydro-cyclones (hydro-clones), and combinations thereof.

[0073] In embodiments comprising VLS 45, liquid exiting VLS 45 is introduced to MDSV 60, the dynamic settler with magnetic separations means. Upon introduction of slurry to MDSV 60, liquid product is separated from concentrated catalyst slurry. MDSV liquid product stream 85 comprises decreased solids content relative to the solids content of MDSV inlet stream 55. In embodiments, the MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 comprises increased solids content relative to MDSV inlet stream 55.<br>
[0074] In embodiments, the solids content of liquid product stream 85 is less than 5000 ppm. In embodiments, the solids content of liquid product stream 85 is less than 2500 ppm. In certain embodiments, the solids content of liquid product stream 85 is less than 1000 ppm. [0075] In embodiments, the ratio of the volumetric flow rate of MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 to liquid product stream 85 is in the range of from about 5 to about 30. In embodiments, the ratio of the volumetric flow rate of MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 to liquid product stream 85 is in the range of from about 5 to about 20.

[0079] In embodiments, MDSV concentrated slurry 65 is recycled to reactor 10 via, for example, reactor slurry inlet 32. In some embodiments, MDSV concentrated slurry 65 undergoes further processing prior to recycle of catalyst to reactor 10. In the embodiment of Figure 1, MDSV concentrated slurry stream 65 enters DS 70. Liquids removed from concentrated slurry stream 65 in DS 70 are removed from DS 70 via DS liquid product stream 80. DS liquid product stream 80 may, in some embodiments, contain particles below a certain size, the recycle of which to reactor 10 is undesired. In embodiments, DS liquid product stream 80 is combined with MDSV liquid product stream 85 from MDSV 60, yielding OSS inlet stream 90.<br>
[0080] DS concentrated slurry stream 75 may be recycled to reactor 10 via FT reactor inlet 32. In embodiments, flow of slurry from MSS 100 to reactor 10 is gravity driven. In some embodiments, flow of slurry from MSS 100 to reactor 10 is pump-assisted. In embodiments, DS slurry exit stream 75 is further processed prior to recycle to reactor 10. For example, in embodiments, DS concentrated slurry stream 75 is treated to regenerate catalyst prior to recycle thereof to reactor 10 for reuse.<br>
