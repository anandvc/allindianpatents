				<td>[001] The present disclosure relates to preformed compositions in shaped<br>
form and the use of preformed compositions for sealkig apertures. The present<br>
disclosure further relates to preformed compositions in shaped form exhibiting<br>
BrVfl/KFI shielding effectiveness, and the use of such preformed compositions for<br>
sealing apertures.<br>
Introduction<br>
[002] Electromagnetic interference can be defined as undesired conducted or<br>
radiated electrical disturbance fiom an electrical or electronic source, including<br>
transients, which can interfere -with the operation of other electrical or electronic<br>
apparatus. Such disturbance can occur at frequencies throughout the electromagnetic<br>
spectrum. Radio frequency interference ("RET") is often used interchangeably with<br>
electromagnetic interference ("EMI"), although RM more properly refers to the radio<br>
frequency portion of the electromagnetic spectrum usually defined as between 10<br>
kilohertz (KHz) and 100 gigahertz (GHz).<br>
â€¢ [003] Electronic equipment is typically enclosed in a housing. The housing<br>
can serve not only as a physical barrier to protect the internal electronics from the<br>
external environment, but also can serve to shield EMMRP1 radiation. Enclosures<br>
having the ability to absorb and/or reflect EMJ/RH energy can be employed to<br>
confine the EMI/RFI energy within the source device, as well as to insulate the source<br>
device or other external devices from other BMQ/RFI sources. To maintain<br>
accessibility to the internal components, enclosures can be provided with openable or<br>
removable accesses such as doors, hatches, panels, or covers. Gaps typically exist<br>
between the accesses and the corresponding mating surfaces associated with the<br>
accesses that reduce the efficiency of the electromagnetic shielding by presenting<br>
openings through which radiant energy may be emitted. Such gaps also present<br>
discontinuities in the surface and ground conductivity of the housing and in some<br>
cases, may generate a secondary source of EMI/RFI radiation by functioning as a slot<br>
antenna.<br>
[004] For filing gaps between the mating surfaces of the housing and<br>
removable accesses, gaskets and other seals can be used to maintain electrical<br>
 across the structures, and to exclude environmental degredants such as particulates, moisture, and corrosive species. Such seals can be bonded or mechanically attached to one or both of the mating surfaces and can function to establish a continuous conductive path by conforming to surface irregularities under an applied pressure.<br>
[005]  Conventional processes for manufacturing BMI/RFI shielding gaskets include extrusion, molding, and die-cutting. Molding includes the compression or injection molding of an uncured sealant or thermoplastic material into a certain configuration which is then cured to a foal shape. Die-cutting includes the forroing of a gasket from a cured polymeric material which is cut or stamped using a die into a certain configuration. Form-in-place ("FIP") processes are also wed for forming EMI/RFI shielding gaskets wherein the FIP process includes the application of a bead of a viscous, curable, eloctrically-conductive composition in a fluent state to a surface that is subsequently cured-in-place by the application of heat, atmospheric moisture, or ultraviolet radiation to form an electrically-conductive, BMI/RFI shielding gasket.<br>
[006]  Electrical conductivity anil EM1/RF1 shielding effectiveness can be imparted to polymeric gaskets by incorporating conductive materials within the polymer matrix. The conductive elements can include, for example, metal or metal-plated particles, fabrics, meshes, fibers, awl combinations thereof. The metal can be in the form of, for example, to;a,emts, particles, flakes, or spherea,. Examples cf metals include copper, nickel, silver, aluminum, tin, and steel. Other conductive materials that can be used to impart EMl/RFI shielding effectiveness to polymer compositions include conductive particles or fibers comprising carbon or graphite. Conductive polymers such as polythiophenes, polypyrroles, polyaniline, poly(p-pheaylene) vinylene, polyphenylene sulfide, polyphenylene, and polyacetylene can also be used.<br>
[007J  In addition to providing continuous electrical conductivity and BMI/RFI sihielding effectiveness, in certain applications it is desirable that gaskets or seals to surfaces exposed to the environment, such as in aviation and aerospace vr-hicica, not lead to corrosion of the mctil surfaces. When dissimilar metals and/or conductive composite materials are joined in the presence of an electrolyte, a galvanic potential is established at the interface between me dissimilar conductors. When the<br>
interfacial seal is exposed to the environment, particularly under severe environmental conditions such as salt fog or salt fog containing a high concentration of SO2, corrosion of the least noble of the conductive surfaces can occur. Corrosion may lead to a degradation in the EMI/RFI shielding effectiveness of the seal. Mechanians other than galvanic potentials, for example, crevice corrosion, may also comprotnise the electrical and mechanical integrity of the enclosure.<br>
[008] Polysulfide polymen are known in the art. The production of polysulfidc polymers is characterized by Fettes and Jotzak, Industrial Engineering Chemietry, November 1950, oopagee 2.217 - 2,223. The commercial use of polysulfide polymers in the manufacture of f ealautt for aerospace applications lias long been known and commercially used. For example, polyvulfide sealants have been used to to sea! an aircraft body because of the high tensile strength, high tear strength, thenal resistance, and resistance to high ultrsviolet light Polysulfide<br>
sealants have been used to seal auoaft fiwl tanks because of the resistance to ftel and adhsion upon exposure to fuel.<br>
(009] Polysulfide sealants are generally  aookued toasurface by extrusion using a caulking gun. Such a process can  be efficient for permanent panels installed on an airframe. However, extruding a sealant to seal apertures in and/or on an airframe such as those associated with access doors or panels can require a significant amount of additional effort. To extrude fin uocured sealant, the interior perimeer of the access door opening is masked and the exterior poiineter of the access door is coated with a  release agent prior to extruding the sealant to the masked area of the acoess door opening to avoid sealing an access door shut. The access door is put in place and clamped down to force tie excess uncured sealant around the accew door. The sealant is then cured and the excess sealant is  trimmed away, This process: is time intensive and can add significant labor to servicing aircraft with many access doors. Some aircraft can have as many tis a hundred or more access doors that are used to cover sensitive electronic equipment or fittings that must be periodically accessed and resealed.<br>
[010}   Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a method for sealing access doors, for example those in an airframe of an aviation or aerospace vehicle, that does<br>
not require masking, reduces trimming and/or is not as lebor and time intensive as the conventional extrusion method for sealing the access  doors.<br>
[O11] Electricallyconductive sealants that exhibit EMI/RFI shielding effectivenese are commercially available, For example, PRC-DeSoto international, Inc. (Glendale, CA) manufactures  several clss B electrically  conductive sealants specifically developed for aviation and aerospace applications, For example, PR-2200 Class B electrically conductive sealant is an electrically conductive polythioether sealant that meets toe requirements of MMS 327 (Boeing St. Louis Military Material Specification) test methods. These two-part, nickel-filled seaknti comprise polythioother  polymer, PHRMAPOLP-3.1, and are aot corrosive when used on aluminuim alloys or between dissirolilar metals,, However, commcrcially available selants  such  as exemplified by the PR-2200 product are not provided as a preformed composition.<br>
(012] Therefore,  it is further desirable to provide a method for sealing access doors to provide effective EMI/RFI shielding and cause minimal corrosion to conductive sirface in environments encountered in aviation and aerospace applications that does not require masking, reduces timming and/or is not as labor and time interasive as is the coaveotional extrusion method for sealing the access doors.
