SPECIFICATION<br>
SECTION 10<br>
TITLE<br>
"A COMPOSITION EFFECTIVE IN THE REMOVAL OF ECTOPARASITES AND A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION THEREOF*.<br>
APPLICANT<br>
MARICO INDUSTRIES LIMITED, an Indian company of Rang Sttarda, K.C. Marg, Bandra Reclamation, Bandra West, Mumbai-400 050,<br>
Maharasthra, INDIA.<br>
   The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner<br><br><br><br><br>
-2-Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a composition effective in the removal of ectoparasites, more particularly for the extermination of lice and to a process for the preparation of said compositon.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
-Pediculus humanus capitis is an ectoparasite that causes Pediculosis, a term used to describe the condition arising from its infestation. As the lice feed on human skin and blood, they inject their digestive juices and fecal material into the skin which along with the puncture wound itself, cause skin irritation and lesions from the resulting scratching. Lice are also known to be vectors of certain diseases, such as exanthematic or epidemic typhus and recurrent fever.<br>
The adult female louse has a life span of about one month, in which it lays up to ten nits a day that are firmly attached to hair through an excreted cement. The nits hatch to release instars in about 7-9 days, which become mature adults in another week. Effective control of Hce requires an approach that eliminates all 3 stages of the louse life cycle.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Most currently utilised options for an effective control of lice involve the application of pediculicides, which are toxic pharmaceutical agents that, when interaalized, poison and kill lice. Examples of such pediculicidal agents used to treat lice are "described in EP 0191236 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,288,483. Typically, such pediculicidal agents enter via the respiratory spiracles, and once inside the louse, interfere with the function of a critical metabolic or physiological pathway, leading to death. Malathion, for example, inhibits acetylcholinesterase, disrupting signaling in the nervous system.<br>
Some of these compounds are also toxic to humans, for e.g., there are reports in the medical literature, that children treated with lindane have developed seizures. Many of these compounds also have unpleasant odors or other undesirable properties, causing noncompliance by the patient, leading to re-infestation of the individual, and spreading of the infestation to others. In addition, the harshness of these agents make them unsuitable for use as prophylactics.<br>
The removal of nits has typically been done by hand using special fine-tooth combs. U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,813 teaches compositions containing formic acid that facilitate removal of nits from the hair; however, formic acid is a known caustic agent which itself could cause skin irritation.<br><br>
-4-<br>
Use of combing alone to treat head lice is not completely effective-because the lice can hold onto the hair shafts using their claws or escape by crawling away from the area being combed. Besides, this method is labor intensive requiring daily combing, is painful, and is unpleasant since the lice are active, visible and crawling.<br>
Home remedies such as application of corn oil, olive oil, eucalyptus oil, neem oil, coconut oil, mayonnaise, or petroleum jelly for a period of time sufficient to Idll the lice (e.g. overnight) are by themselves not completely effective.<br>
Heat has also been suggested as a means of killing head lice but has not been effective, due in part to the fact that crawling lice will rapidly move away from the heat source. Moreover, the temperatures needed to kill the lice, typically 60 degrees Celsius or higher, can burn or scald the scalp.<br>
Use of heat in conjunction with pediculicidal compositions is discouraged because some of the solvents used in the pediculicidal compositions are inflammable at the temperatures necessary to kill the lice and the heat may additionally degrade the active pediculicidal agents as well.<br><br>
-5-<br>
Use of aqueous based preparations which have been widely covered7 in the state ofithe art through various patents have some limitation due to the "immersion refe" exhibited by lice, whereby the lice become immobilized as a consequence of reflexes thatlflias evolved to avoid suffocation. The lice remain immobilized while in contact with the pediculostatic or pediculicidal agent in its wet form, and do not recover from the immersion reflex once the agent has been dried onto the lice. U.S. patent No. 6,265,384 teaches that the immersion reflex is a self-preservation behavior that lice have evolved to protect themselves agamst drowning when, through actions of the host, they are immersed in water. Lice are obligate air breathers and cannot derive oxygen when underwater; the immersion reflex allows them greatly to increase the amount of time that they can survive without access to air. During submersion, the spiracles and tracheoles, through which lice breath, become blocked by water. As the lice become anoxic, they rapidly switch into a state of profound suspended animation, decreasing their need for oxygen, thus prolonging their survival. They become completely immobile, unresponsive to stimuli, and even cease gut motility. If the reflex continues too long, however, the lice eventually run completely out of oxygen and die from anoxia. This "immersion reflex" exhibited by the lice sometimes prevent the pediculostatic or pediculocidal agent from entering into the lice thereby impacting its efficacy.<br><br>
-6-Prior art teaches the use of topical agents that are well known to killllic|^suGji as natural \ pyrethrins,   pyrethroids,   permethrin,   lindane,   malathion,   carbaryl^vivermegtjn   and"? combinations thereof. These agents, once internalized, typically target and iirterfere with,  i specific components of metabolic or other physiologic pathways, leading to death of the organism.<br>
Prior art also teaches that efficacy of the various aqueous based formulations have been reduced by the "immersion effect" which is a normal endogenous behavioral reflex exhibited by the lice to protect themselves from drowning, when, through the actions of the host, they are immersed in water, wherein the metabolic activity of the lice is drastically reduced thereby reducing the penetration of the pediculicidal agent.<br>
