				<td>POWERTRAIN WITH TORQUE CONVERTER AND AXIALLY COMPACT<br>
SEVEN SPEED DUAL CLUTCH TRANSMISSION<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO CO-PENDING APPLICATION<br>
[0001]	This patent application is a continuation-in-part of patent application<br>
Ser. No. 11/466,479, filed on August 23, 2006, now<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002]	The invention relates to a powertrain having a power source, a<br>
torque converter and a compact seven speed transmission with two friction shifting<br>
clutches.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003]	Dual clutch transmissions (DCTs) have been designed with friction<br>
launch clutches that connect the output of a torque converter to a lay shaft<br>
transmission. Dual clutch transmissions are known for their sporty,<br>
performance-oriented characteristics. Dual clutch transmissions typically exhibit<br>
good fuel economy due to good gear mesh efficiency and ratio selection flexibility.<br>
Synchronizers are typically used to engage gears with the countershafts to<br>
complete power flow from the engaged input clutch to an output shaft. The<br>
synchronizers have low spin losses; thus, overall operating efficiency is enhanced.<br>
However, dual clutch transmissions have some specific design considerations. For<br>
example, due to the high heat that can be generated during slip, the shifting<br>
clutches must be of a relatively large size. Shudder and oil life durability must<br>
also be addressed. Furthermore, cooling circuits for the friction shifting clutches<br>
are typically relatively complex due to the heat dissipation requirements of these<br>
large clutches. Finally, because lay shaft or countershaft transmissions typically<br>
have many sets of axially-aligned, intermeshing gears, the overall axial length of<br>
countershaft transmissions may limit there use in some vehicle designs.<br>
1<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	A powertrain having a torque converter and dual shifting friction<br>
clutches connectable to first and second concentric intermediate shafts combines<br>
the smoothness and ratio-boosting effects of a torque converter with the low spin<br>
losses associated with synchronizers used in dual clutch designs, while preferably<br>
providing seven fixed forward speed ratios in an axially compact design. Several<br>
aspects of the powertrain contribute to the minimization of axial length. For<br>
example, driving gears connected for common rotation with the intermediate shafts<br>
intermesh with driven input gears connectable for rotation with each of the<br>
respective countershafts, thus functioning as shared driving gears. Preferably,<br>
back-to-back synchronizer pairs are supported on the countershafts between<br>
adjacent intermeshing aligned gear sets such that only four back-to-back<br>
synchronizer pairs are necessary and only four synchronizer selection devices are<br>
required to control engagement of the four pairs. Additionally, a parking gear is<br>
preferably connected for common rotation with one of the countershafts such that<br>
it is radially-aligned with an intermeshing output gear set. (A radial plane is in a<br>
plane encompassing radii of the driving or driven gears, perpendicular to the axis<br>
of rotation of the input member, output member, intermediate shafts and<br>
countershafts in the transmission. Accordingly, as used herein, components that<br>
are "radially-aligned" are aligned in a radial plane.) Furthermore, positioning of a<br>
transmission oil pump between the torque converter and the first and second<br>
friction shifting clutches allows a clutch hub supporting the friction shifting<br>
clutches to be configured with clutch hub passages for routing oil delivered from<br>
the pump to the friction shifting clutches.<br>
[0005]	Specifically, within the scope of the invention, the powertrain<br>
includes a power source and a torque converter that operatively connects the power<br>
source with a transmission input member. First and second friction shifting<br>
clutches are alternately selectively engagable to operatively connect the<br>
transmission input member with first and second concentric intermediate shafts,<br>
2<br><br>
respectively. A first input driving gear is connected for common rotation with the<br>
first intermediate shaft and intermeshes with a first pair of driven input gears that<br>
are each connectable for common rotation to a different respective one of the<br>
countershafts to selectively transfer torque to the respective countershaft when the<br>
first friction input clutch is engaged. Furthermore, a second input driving gear is<br>
connected for common rotation with the second intermediate shaft and intermeshes<br>
with a second pair of input gears each connectable for common rotation with a<br>
different respective one of the countershafts to selectively transfer torque to the<br>
respective countershaft when the second friction input clutch is engaged. Thus,<br>
when torque is provided through either of the friction clutches to the countershafts,<br>
shared driving gears on each of the countershafts transfer the torque to one of the<br>
countershafts, depending on synchronizer engagements. Preferably, the first<br>
countershaft includes two input driving gears and the second countershaft has two<br>
other input driving gears so that four intermeshing aligned gear sets are used for<br>
input of torque from the first and second friction shifting clutches. Preferably two<br>
output gear sets are utilized, including a first output gear set that has a first output<br>
driving gear connected for common rotation with the first countershaft and a first<br>
output driven gear connected for common rotation with the output member that<br>
continuously intermeshes with the first output driving gear. Similarly, the second<br>
output gear set has a second output driving gear connected for common rotation<br>
with a second countershaft and a second output driven gear connected for common<br>
rotation with the output member that continuously intermeshes with the second<br>
output driving gear. Accordingly, the input and output driving gears and the input<br>
and output driven gears thereby form six sets of intermeshing aligned gears. By<br>
utilizing the four back-to-back synchronizers and selectively engaging the friction<br>
shifting clutches, seven forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio are<br>
achieved.<br>
[0006]	Unique packaging of the transmission oil pump allows simplified<br>
routing of clutch and lubrication oil and compact piloting of a clutch hub that<br>
supports the dual friction shifting clutches. Specifically, the clutch hub is<br>
3<br><br>
configured with clutch hub passages for routing oil delivered from the transmission<br>
oil pump to the first and second friction shifting clutches. Preferably, a stationary<br>
clutch hub support member at least partially supports the clutch hub and is<br>
configured with clutch hub support member passages that are in fluid<br>
communication with the clutch hub passages so that oil may be routed from the<br>
transmission oil pump to the friction shifting clutches through the stationary clutch<br>
hub support member. The transmission oil pump is preferably radially-inward of<br>
and partially surrounded by the stationary clutch hub support member. Preferably,<br>
a stator support shaft connects a stator portion of the torque converter with the<br>
clutch hub support member. The oil pump is positioned radially-outward of the<br>
stator support shaft. Preferably the stator support shaft is configured with stator<br>
support shaft passages that are in fluid communication with the oil pump to route<br>
oil delivered from the oil pump to the torque converter.<br>
[0007]	The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best mode for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0008]	FIGURE 1 is a schematic illustration of a first embodiment of a<br>
powertrain with an engine, a torque converter, a transmission with dual friction<br>
shifting clutches, and an oil pump positioned between the torque converter and the<br>
friction shifting clutches;<br>
[0009]	FIGURE 2 is a table showing an engagement schedule of the<br>
friction shifting clutches and synchronizers in the powertrain of Figure 1 to<br>
achieve seven forward speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio; and<br>
[001.0]	FIGURE 3 is a partial schematic fragmentary illustration of the<br>
torque converter, oil pump and friction shifting clutches of the powertrain of<br>
Figure 1, showing a clutch hub, a clutch hub support member and a stator shaft<br>
4<br><br>
support member that enable routing of oil from the oil pump to the torque<br>
converter and to the friction shifting clutches.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[0011]	Referring to the drawings, wherein like reference numbers represent<br>
the same or corresponding parts throughout the several views, there is shown in<br>
Figure 1 a powertrain 10 for a vehicle (not shown). The powertrain 10 includes a<br>
power source or engine 14, a torque converter 16 and a transmission 18. The torque<br>
converter 16 includes a turbine portion 20, a pump portion 22, and a stator portion<br>
24. An engine output shaft 23 is connected for rotation with a hub member 25 that<br>
is connected to the pump portion 22. The turbine portion 20 is connected with a<br>
transmission input member 26. A fluid coupling between the pump portion 22 and<br>
the turbine portion 20 thus operatively connects the engine 14 with the transmission<br>
input member 26. The transmission input member 26 is preferably in the nature of a<br>
shaft. Selective engagement of a torque converter clutch 28 allows the engine 14 to<br>
be directly connected with the input member 26, bypassing the torque converter 16.<br>
Preferably, the torque converter clutch 28 is electronically controlled and may be<br>
enhanced with a plurality of clutch plates to provide a large clutch torque capacity,<br>
thus making the converter clutch 28 able to transmit a large amount of torque. The<br>
stator portion 24 is grounded to a stationary member, such as the transmission<br>
housing 30, through a typical one-way clutch 32. A damper 34 is operatively<br>
connected to the torque converter clutch 28 for absorbing vibration. A transmission<br>
oil pump 36 is operatively connected for rotation with the pump portion 22. Support<br>
for the pump 36 and fluid communication from the pump 36 to the transmission 18<br>
and to the torque converter 16 will be discussed hereinafter. Briefly, a stator support<br>
shaft 38 supports the stator and is located radially-inward of the pump 36. The<br>
stator support shaft 38 operatively supports the stator portion 24 and is connected<br>
with a stationary clutch hub support member 40 that is grounded to the transmission<br>
housing 30. A clutch hub 42 operatively connects the input member 26 with first<br>
and second concentric intermediate shafts 44, 46 by selective engagement of first<br>
and second friction shifting clutches CO and CE, respectively.<br>
5<br><br>
[0012]	The transmission 18 further includes a first countershaft 50 and a<br>
second counter shaft 52 which are axially-spaced from and generally parallel with<br>
the intermediate shafts 44 and 46.<br>
[0013]	Six aligned, intermeshing gear sets are utilized to transfer torque from<br>
the intermediate shafts 44, 46 via the countershafts 50, 52 to an output member 56<br>
(preferably in the form of a shaft) to establish multiple speed ratios between the<br>
input member 26 and the output member 56. The output member 56 is connected to<br>
a final drive mechanism 58 which may be connected to vehicle wheels (not shown).<br>
[0014]	A first intermeshing gear set includes gears 60, 62 and 64. The gear<br>
60 is a shared input driving gear that is connected for common rotation with the<br>
intermediate shaft 44 and continuously intermeshes with both gears 62 and 64. The<br>
gear 62 is rotatable about the first countershaft 50 and is selectively connectablc<br>
therewith. The gear 64 is rotatable about the second countershaft 52 and is<br>
selectively connectable therewith.<br>
[0015]	A second intermeshing gear set includes gears 66, 68 and 70. The<br>
gear 66 is connected for common rotation with the intermediate shaft 44 and<br>
continuously intermeshes with both gears 68 and 70. The gear 68 is rotatable about<br>
and selectively connectable with the countershaft 50. The gear 70 is rotatable about<br>
and selectively connectable with the second countershaft 52.<br>
[0016]	A third intermeshing gear set includes gears 72, 74 and 76. The gear<br>
72 is connected for common rotation with the intermediate shaft 46 and<br>
continuously intermeshes with both gears 74 and 76. The gear 74 is rotatable about<br>
and selectively connectable for rotation with the first countershaft 50. The gear 76 is<br>
rotatable about and selectively connectable for rotation with the second countershaft<br>
52.<br>
[0017]	A fourth intermeshing gear set includes gears 78, 80, 82 and a gear<br>
84. The gear 78 is connected for common rotation with the intermediate shaft 46.<br>
The gear 78 continuously intermeshes with both the gear 80 and the gear 82. The<br>
gear 82 continuously intermeshes with the gear 84. The gear 80 is rotatable about<br>
and selectively connectable for common rotation with the first countershaft 50. The<br>
gear 82 is an idler gear supported on a separate axis I. The gear 84 is rotatable about<br>
6<br><br>
and selectively connectable with the second countershaft 52. The gears 60, 66, 72<br>
and 78 are referred to herein as input driving gears. The gears 62, 64, 68, 70, 74, 76,<br>
80, and 84 are referred to herein as input driven gears.<br>
[0018]	The transmission 18 includes a fifth intermeshing, aligned gear set<br>
that includes a gear 86 and a gear 88. The gear 86 is connected for common rotation<br>
with the second countershaft 52 and continuously intermeshes with the gear 88<br>
which is connected for common rotation with the output member 56. A sixth<br>
intermeshing, aligned gear set includes gear a 90 which is connected for common<br>
rotation with the first countershaft 50 and a gear 92 which is connected for common<br>
rotation with the output member 56 and continuously intermeshes with the gear 90.<br>
The gears 86 and 90 are referred to herein as output driving gears and the gears 88<br>
and 92 arc referred to herein as output driven gears. The intermeshing, aligned gear<br>
set including the gears 60, 62 and 64 may be referred to as a first input gear set. The<br>
intermeshing, aligned gear set including the gears 66, 68 and 70 may be referred to<br>
as a second input gear set. The intermeshing, aligned gear set including the gears<br>
72, 74 and 76 may be referred to a third input gear set. The intermeshing, aligned<br>
gear set including the gears 78, 80, 82 and 84 may be referred to herein as a fourth<br>
intermeshing gear set. The gear set including the gears 90, 92 may be referred to as<br>
a first output gear set and the gear set including the gears 88 and 86 may be referred<br>
to as a second output gear set. The four input gear sets utilize shared input driving<br>
gears: the gear 60, the gear 66, the gear 72 and the gear 78. Each of the input<br>
driving gears 60, 66, 72 and 78 intermesh with gears that are connectable for<br>
rotation with each of the countershafts 50, 52. Thus, the shared input driving gears<br>
are each able to transfer torque to both of the countershafts 50, 52, the countershaft<br>
to which torque is transferred being dependent on the engagement of synchronizers,<br>
as will be described herein.<br>
[0019]	A parking gear 94 is radially-aligned with the output gear set 90, 92.<br>
Thus, the parking gear 94 is situated in what may otherwise be unused, empty space<br>
and docs not require any addition to the axial length of the transmission 18.<br>
[0020]	The transmission 18 includes four pairs of back-to-back<br>
synchronizers: A, B, C and D. The back-to-back synchronizer pair A includes<br>
7<br><br>
synchronizer A1 and a synchronizer A3. The synchronizer A1 is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the gear 64 for common rotation with the second countershaft<br>
52. The synchronizer A3 is selectively engagable to connect the gear 70 for<br>
common rotation with the second countershaft 52. A single synchronizer selection<br>
device 96 is operable to engage either the synchronizer Al or A3. Specifically, a<br>
synchronizer selection device 96 is shiftable to the left to engage the synchronizer<br>
Al and shiftable to the right the engage the synchronizer A3.<br>
[0021]	The back-to-back synchronizer pair B includes a synchronizer B2 and<br>
a synchronizer BR. The synchronizer B2 is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
gear 76 for common rotation with the second countershaft 52. The synchronizer BR<br>
is selectively engagable to connect the gear 84 for common rotation with the second<br>
countershaft 52. A single synchronizer selection device 98 is operable to control<br>
engagement of both the synchronizer B2 and the synchronizer BR. Specifically, the<br>
synchronizer selection device 98 is shiftable to the left to engage the synchronizer<br>
B2 and shiftable to the right to engage the synchronizer BR.<br>
[0022]	The back-to-back synchronizer pair C includes a synchronizer C5 and<br>
a synchronizer C7. The synchronizer C5 is selectively engagable to connect the gear<br>
62 for common rotation with the first countershaft 50. The synchronizer C7 is<br>
selectively engageable to connect the gear 68 for common rotation with the first<br>
countershaft 50. A single synchronizer selection device 100 is operable to control<br>
engagement of both the synchronizers C5 and C7. Specifically, the synchronizer<br>
selection device 100 is shiftable to the left to engage the synchronizer C5 and<br>
shiftable to the right the engage the synchronizer C7.<br>
[0023]	The back-to-back synchronizer pair D includes a synchronizer D6<br>
and a synchronizer D4. The synchronizer D6 is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
gear 74 for common rotation with the first countershaft 50. The synchronizer D4 is<br>
selectively the synchronizers D6 and D4. Specifically, the synchronizer selection<br>
device 102 is shiftable to the left to engage the synchronizer D6 and shiftable to the<br>
right to engage the synchronizer D4.<br>
[0024]	Referring to Figure 2, the engagement schedule of the shifting<br>
friction clutches CO and CE as well as the synchronizers is shown. As indicated in<br>
8<br><br>
Figure 2, seven forward gears (i.e., speed ratios) and a reverse gear (i.e., speed ratio)<br>
are achieved. Those skilled in the art will recognize that the gears shown in Figure 1<br>
may be designed with various tooth counts that, when the clutches and synchronizers<br>
are engaged according to the truth table of Figure 2, will result in seven forward<br>
speed ratios and a reverse speed ratio corresponding with the seven forward gears<br>
and the reverse gear. For example, the following gear ratios may have different<br>
numerical values: First gear: tooth count gear 64/tooth count gear 60; Second gear:<br>
tooth count gear 76/tooth count gear 72; Third gear tooth count gear 70/tooth count<br>
gear 66; Fourth gear: tooth count gear 80/tooth count gear 78; Fifth gear: tooth count<br>
gear 62/tooth count gear 60; Sixth gear: tooth count gear 74/tooth count gear 72;<br>
Seventh gear: tooth count gear 68/tooth count gear 66; Reverse gear: tooth count<br>
gear 84/tooth count gear 78; First countershaft (50) output: tooth count gear 90/tooth<br>
count gear 92. Second countershaft (52) output: tooth count gear 86/tooth count gear<br>
88; The tooth counts are selected to achieve desired speed ratios, ratio steps, and<br>
overall speed ratio.<br>
[0025J	To establish the reverse speed ratio, the clutch CE and the<br>
synchronizer BR are engaged. By engagement of the clutch CE torque is transferred<br>
from the input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 46. By engagement of the<br>
synchronizer BR torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 44 to the second<br>
countershaft 52 via intermeshing gears 78, 82 and 84, with the gear 82 acting as an<br>
idler gear so that the gear 84 rotates in the same direction as the gear 78. Torque is<br>
transferred from the second countershaft 52 to the output member 56 via the<br>
intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
[0026]	To establish the first forward speed ratio, the input friction clutch CO<br>
and the synchronizer Al are engaged. Torque is transferred from the input member<br>
26 to the intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of the input shifting friction clutch<br>
CO. Torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 44 to the second countershaft<br>
52 by engagement of synchronizer Al through the intermeshing gears 60 and 62.<br>
Torque is transferred from the second countershaft 52 to the output member 56 via<br>
intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
9<br><br>
[0027]	To establish the second forward speed ratio, input friction shifting<br>
clutch CE and the synchronizer B2 are engaged. Torque is transferred from the<br>
input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 46 via engagement of clutch CE. Torque<br>
is then transferred from the intermediate shaft 46 to the second countershaft 52 via<br>
engagement of the synchronizer B2 through the intermeshing gears 72 and 76.<br>
Torque is transferred from the second countershaft 52 to the output member 56 via<br>
the intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
[0028]	To establish the third forward speed ratio, the input friction shifting<br>
clutch CO and the synchronizer A3 are engaged. Torque is transferred from the<br>
input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of the clutch CO.<br>
Torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 44 to the second countershaft 52<br>
via engagement of the synchronizer A3 through the intermeshing gears 66 and 70.<br>
Torque is transferred from the second countershaft 52 to the output member 56 via<br>
the intermeshing gears 86 and 88.<br>
[0029]	It will thus be appreciated that all of the four lower speed (higher<br>
numerical reduction ratios) gears (1st, 2nd, 3rd and Reverse) are disposed on the<br>
second countershaft 52.<br>
[0030]	To establish the fourth forward speed ratio, the input friction shifting<br>
clutch CE and the synchronizer D4 are engaged. Torque is transferred from the<br>
input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 46 via engagement of the clutch CE.<br>
Torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 46 to the first countershaft 50 via<br>
the engagement of synchronizer D4 through the intermeshing gears 78 and 80.<br>
Torque is transferred from the first countershaft 50 to the output member 56 through<br>
the intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br>
[0031]	A fifth forward speed ratio is established by engagement of the input<br>
friction shifting clutch CO and the synchronizer C5. Torque is transferred from the<br>
input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of the clutch CO.<br>
Torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 44 to the first countershaft 50 via<br>
engagement of the synchronizer C5 through the intermeshing gears 60 and 62.<br>
Torque is transferred from the first countershaft 50 to the output member 56 through<br>
the intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br>
10<br><br>
[0032]	A sixth forward speed ratio is established by engagement of the input<br>
friction shifting clutch CE and the synchronizer D6. Torque is transferred from the<br>
input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 46 via engagement of the clutch CE.<br>
Torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 46 to the first countershaft 50 via<br>
engagement of the synchronizer D6 through the intermeshing gears 72 and 74.<br>
Torque is transferred from the first countershaft 50 to the output member 56 through<br>
the intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br>
[0033]	A seventh forward speed ratio is established via engagement of the<br>
input friction shifting clutch CO and the synchronizer C7. Torque is transferred<br>
from the input member 26 to the intermediate shaft 44 via engagement of the input<br>
friction shifting clutch CO. Torque is transferred from the intermediate shaft 44 to<br>
the first countershaft 50 via engagement of synchronizer C7 through intermeshing<br>
gears 66 and 68. Torque is transferred from the first countershaft 50 to the output<br>
member 56 through the intermeshing gears 90 and 92.<br>
[0034]	It will thus also be appreciated that all of the four higher speed (lower<br>
numerical reduction ratio) gears (4n, 5n, 6n and 7U) are disposed on the first<br>
countershaft 50. This arrangement of higher speed gears on the first countershaft 50<br>
and lower speed gears on the second countershaft 52 is facilitated by the difference<br>
in center to center distances between the axes of the first and second countershafts<br>
50, 52 and the common axis of the two intermediate shafts 44 and 46. In Figure 1,<br>
this greater distance "X" between the axis of the second countershaft 52 and the<br>
common axis of the two intermediate shafts 44 and 46 is illustrated and contrasted<br>
with the smaller distance "Y" between the axis of the first countershaft 50 and the<br>
common axis of the two intermediate shafts 44 and 46. This arrangement also<br>
assists maintenance of reasonable torque and speed ratios on the ratio gears.<br>
Distributing the overall gear state ratio, i.e., that overall gear ratio between the input<br>
member 26 (or the intermediate shafts 44 and 46) and the output member 56,<br>
between the ratio and transfer gearsets allows for smaller gear diameter packaging<br>
than an arrangement that develops all the gear state ratios in one gearset.<br>
[0035]	Referring now to Figure 3, the torque converter 16, the pump 36, the<br>
stationary clutch hub support member 40, the clutch hub 42 and the stator support<br>
11<br><br>
shaft 38 are shown in greater detail. The transmission oil pump 36 is operatively<br>
connected to the pump portion 22 of the torque converter 16 and to the engine output<br>
member 23 via pump portion hub member 25. The stator portion 24 is operatively<br>
connected to the stator support shaft 38 which is connected with the stationary clutch<br>
hub support member 40. The transmission housing 30 is bolted or otherwise<br>
connected with the stationary member clutch hub support member 40. Thus, the<br>
pump 36 is radially-outward of the stator support shaft 38 and is radially-inward of<br>
and supported by the stationary clutch hub support member 40.<br>
[0036]	The turbine portion 20 is operatively connected for rotation with the<br>
input member 26. The input member 26 in turn is operatively connected for rotation<br>
with the clutch hub 42. The clutch hub 42 supports a portion of the friction input<br>
shifting clutches CO and CE. The friction input shifting clutch CO has another<br>
portion operatively connected for rotation with the intermediate shaft 44. The<br>
friction input shifting clutch CE has another portion operatively connected for<br>
rotation with intermediate shaft 46. Engagement of the clutch CO connects the input<br>
member 26 and the clutch hub 42 for rotation with the intermediate shaft 44.<br>
Engagement of the clutch CE connects the input member 26 and the clutch hub 42<br>
for rotation with the intermediate shaft 46.<br>
[0037]	Transmission oil from pump the 36 is routed to the torque converter<br>
16 and to the friction shifting clutches CO and CE. Torque converter clutch apply<br>
oil is routed from the pump 36 to the torque converter 16 via a sleeve passage 101<br>
which is an annular passage between the pump portion sleeve shaft 103 and the<br>
stator support shaft 38. The pump portion sleeve shaft 103 operatively connects the<br>
pump portion 22 to the pump 36. Torque converter clutch release oil is also routed<br>
to the torque converter 16 through a stator support shaft passage 104 in the stator<br>
support shaft 38. The oil makes its way from the pump 36 to the stator support shaft<br>
passage 104 through a horizontally running crevice 108 between the stationary<br>
clutch hub support member 40 and the stator support shaft 38. Lubrication oil for<br>
gears supported on the intermediate shafts 44 and 46 is delivered via a lubrication<br>
passage 106.<br>
12<br><br>
[0038]	The stationary clutch hub support member 40 also has clutch hub<br>
support member passages 110 and 112 formed therein to direct clutch apply oil from<br>
the pump 36 via the horizontal crevice 108 to clutch hub passages 114 and 116. The<br>
clutch hub 42 also has additional passages (not shown) in fluid communication with<br>
one another for delivering dam oil to the clutches CO and CE. These additional dam<br>
oil passages are located in a different radial plane than the passages 114 and 116.<br>
The clutch hub passage 114 directs oil to the input friction clutch CE and the clutch<br>
hub passage 116 directs oil to the input friction clutch CO.<br>
[0039]	The passage 118 is an oil supply to the pump 36 in the housing 30<br>
and is fluidly communicable with a filter (not shown) through which oil is supplied<br>
to the pump 36. Multiple valves, represented by a valve 120, control oil flow<br>
through passages 101, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114 and 116 and communicate with<br>
one or more valve bodies (not shown).<br>
[0040]	Thus, the unique packaging of the oil pump 36 adjacent the clutch<br>
hub 42 enables a relatively simple cooling circuit for the friction shifting clutches<br>
CO and CE through the stationary clutch hub support member passages 110, 112<br>
and the clutch hub passages 114, 116. During assembly of the transmission 18, the<br>
clutch hub 42 is piloted over the stationary hub support member 40, which serves to<br>
partially support both the clutch hub 42 and the pump 36.<br>
[0041]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
