				<td>BACKGROUND<br>
This disclosure relates to solder resistant high temperature thermoplastic compositions and methods for manufacturing the same.<br>
Because of the desire to miniatuize products and to improve productivity in the electronics industry, a method of soldering resinous electronic parts has been developed for affixing parts such as connectors, switches, relays and coil bobbins to printed circuit board. This method has been named a "surface-mount" technology.<br>
The term "surface-mount" as used herein refers to a mounting system wherein electrom'c parts are affixed to a printed circuit board. A creamy lead-free solder is used to facilitate the adhesion of the electronic parts to the printed circuit board. Thermoplastic compositions are also often used as insulating materials for electronic parts. The printed circuit board is then passed through a heating oven (re-flowing oven), thereby melting the solder to fix the electronic parts to the wiring board. The surface-mount technology permits mounting to be conducted on both surfaces of the printed circuit board thereby reducing production costs.<br>
However, the surface-mount technology suffers from several drawbacks. For example, upon exposure to a lead-free solder, many of the thermoplastic compositions that are used as insulators begin to fail. Loss of insulating ability, which generally occurs after failure, renders the thermoplastic composition unreliable for these types of applications. It is therefore desirable to have thermoplastic compositions that can contact lead free solder without any of the aforementioned disadvantages.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
Disclosed herein is a solder resistant high temperature thermoplastic composition that comprises a polyarylene ether, a polyarylene sulfide, and glass fibers. The polyarylene ether has an intrinsic viscosity (IV) less than or equal to about 0.15 deciliter per gram as determined in chloroform at 25°C. The use of the low IV polyarylene ether permits improved blending which leads to improved high temperature properties. The high temperature thermoplastic composition also advantageously displays a thermal resistance effective to withstand the high temperatures encotuntered in a re-flowing oven. Further, the high temperature thermoplastic compositions more closely match the thermal shrinkage of polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), which is presently used in solder connector applications. The high temperature thermoplastic compositions are also advantageous in that the-thermal performance is improved without any changes to existing processing equipment such as molding machines, dies, molds, extruders, and the like. The high temperature thermoplastic compositions can also be molded into various shapes and<br><br>
forms such as connectors, circuit boards, pipes, rods, films, sheets and bearings, which renders them useful in electrical applications which might result in contact with lead free solder.<br>
As noted above, the high temperature thermoplastic composition comprises a polyarylene ether, a polyaiylene.sulfide, and glass fibers. The polyarylene ether and the polyarylene sulfide constitute a thermoplastic blend.

Impact modifiers may also be added to the high temperature thermoplastic<br>
composition. These impact modifiers include block copolymers such as, for example,<br>
A-B-A triblock copolymers and A-B diblock copolymers. The A-B-A and A-B type<br>
block copolymer may be thermoplastic rubbers comprised of one or two alkenyl<br>
aromatic blocks, which are generally styrene blocks and an elastomeric block, e.g., a<br>
butadiene block that is partially hydrogenated. Mixtures of these diblock and triblock<br>
copolymers are especially useful. Examples of suitable impact modifiers of the A-B<br>
and A-B-A type block copolyrners include polystyrene-polybutadiene (SBR),<br>
polystyrene-poly(ethylene-propylene),	polystyrene-polyisoprene,	poly(α-<br>
methylstyene)-polybutadiene, polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene (SBR),<br>
polystyrene-poly(ethylene-propylene)-polystyrene,	polystyrene-polyisoprene-<br>
polystyrene and poly(a-methylstyrene)-polybutadiene-poly(a-methyIstyrene), as well as the selectively hydrogenated versions thereof, or the like, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing impact modifiers. Mixtures of the aforementioned block copolymers are also useful.<br><br>
Thermosetting resins may also be added to the solder free composition. These thennosetting resins can be added for purposes of impact modification if desired. Examples of suitable thermosetting resins include polyurethane, natural rubber, synthetic rubber, epoxy, phenolic, polyesters, polyamides, silicones, or the like, or a combination comprising at least one of the foregoing thermosetting resins. Where it is desirable to add additional thermoplastic or thermosetting resins or combinations of thermoplastic and thermosetting resins to the high temperature thermoplastic composition, they may be added in an amount of about 1 to about 20 wt% based upon the weight of the high temperature thermoplastic composition.<br>
Other additives may also be optionally added to the high temperature thermoplastic composition including, for example, mineral fillers, antioxidants, lubricants, surfactants, antistatic agents, flow control agents, flow promotors, impact modifiers, nucleating agents, coupling agents, flame retardants, and the like. Similarly, addition of pigments and dyes (inorganic and organic) may also be used.<br>
The high temperature thermoplastic composition can be manufactured by melt blending, solution blending, or by combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing methods of blending. Melt blending involving the aforementioned forces may be conducted in machines such as, single or multiple screw extruders. Buss kneader, Henschel, helicones, Ross mixer, Banbury, roll mills, molding machines such as injection molding machines, vacuum forming machines, blow molding machine, or then like, or combinations comprising at least one of the foregoing machines. It is generally desirable during melt or solution blending of the composition to impart a specific energy of about 0.01 to about 10 kilowatt-hour/kilogram (kwhr/kg) of the composition.<br>
The high temperature thermoplastic compositions can be manufactured by a number of methods. In. one exemplary process, the thermoplastic polymers, the glass fibers, and additional ingredients are compounded in an extruder and extruded to produce pellets. During the extrusion, the glass fibers and other ingredient are dispersed in the ' thermoplastic polymeric matrix. In another exemplary process, the glass fibers along with the other ingredients are compounded with the thermoplastic polymers in a dry<br><br>
blending process e.g., in a Henschel mixer, and then either fluxed on a mill and comminuted or extruded and chopped. The high temperature thermoplastic composition can also be mixed in a dry blending process and directly molded, e.g., by injection molding or any other suitable transfer molding technique. It is desirable to have all of the components of the high temperature thermoplastic composition free from water prior to extrusion and/or molding.  .<br>
In another exemplary method of manufacturing the high temperature thermoplastic composition, the glass fibers can be masterbatched into a resin composition comprising the polyarylene ether and/or the polyarylene sulfide. The masterbatch may then be let down with additional polyarylene ether and/or the polyarylene sulfide during the extrusion process or the molding process to form the high temperature thermoplastic composition.<br>
When compounding occurs in an extruder, it is generally carried out so as to ensure that the residence time in the machine is short. The temperature in the extruder is carefully controlled and friction heat can be utilized in part or in whole to ensure that an intimate blend of the glass fiber with the thermoplastic matrix is obtained. In cases where fnctional heating is utilized in part, the remaining heat may be supplied through electrical heating bands mounted on the barrels of the extruder. Oil heating of the extruder barrels may also be used.<br>
Exemplary extrusion temperatures are about 180 to about 400°C. The compounded high temperature thermoplastic composition can be extruded into granules or pellets, cut into sheets or shaped into briquettes for further downstream processing. The composition can then be molded in equipment generally employed for processing thermoplastic compositions, e.g., a Newbury type injection molding machine with cylinder temperatures of about 220 to about 400°C, and mold temperatures of about 75 to about HCC.<br>
Use of polyarylene ethers that have a low intrinsic viscosity permits ease of processing. The ease of processing results in a better dispersion of the glass fibers resulting in reduced flaws and/or defects in manufactured articles.   This promotes<br><br>
improved physical properties such as impact properties as determined in Notched Izod tests conducted at room temperature (25°C). In one embodiment, the high temperature thermoplastic composition has an impact strength of greater than or equal to about 1 ft-lb/inch in a notched Izod test conducted at 25°C. In another embodiment, the high temperature thermoplastic composition has a notched Izod impact strength of greater than or equal to about 1.5 ft-lb/inch. In yet another embodiment, the high temperature thermoplastic composition has a notched Izod impact strength of greater than or equal to about 2 ft-lb/inch. The high temperature thermoplastic compositions also display a heat distortion temperature of greater than or equal to about 250°C. In one embodiment, the high temperature thermoplastic compositions display a heat distortion temperature of greater than or equal to about 260°C. In another embodinient, the high temperature thermoplastic compositions display a heat distortion temperature of greater than or equal to about 270°C. In yet another embodiment, the high temperature thermoplastic compositions display a heat distortion temperature of greater than or equal to about 280°C.<br>
Articles manufactured from the high temperature thermoplastic composition can also be flame retardant. This flame retardancy can be achieved without adding any flame retardant additives. In one embodiment, articles having a thickness of 1.6 millimeter when tested according to the procedure of Underwriter's Laboratory Bulletin 94 entitled "Tests for Flanunability of Plastic Materials, UL94", has a flame retardancy rating of UL-94 V-2. In another embodiment, articles having a thickness of 1.6 millimeter have a flame retardancy rating of UL-94 V-1. In another embodiment, articles having a thickness of 1.6 millimeter have a flame retardancy rating of UL-94 V-0.<br>
Molded samples can have a smooth surface. In one embodiment, articles manufactured from the high temperature thermoplastic composition can have a Class A surface finish.<br>
The high temperature thermoplastic compositions can be advantageously used for a wide variety of applications where high temperature stability is desired. Examples of such applications are electronic applications where the high temperature thermoplastic<br><br>
compositions can be advantageously used for their resistance to lead free solder. Other applications include automotive applications such as dash boards, exterior body panels of appliances, or the like.<br>
The following, examples, which are meant to be exemplary, not limiting, illustrate compositions and methods for manufacturing the high temperature thermoplastic compositions described herein.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
These examples demonstrate the advantageous properties of a high temperature thermoplastic composition comprising polyarylene ether having an intrinsic viscosity below 0.15 dl/g. Sample 1 contains a low intrinsic viscosity polyphenylene ether (PPE) having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.12 dl/g while Sample 2 is a comparative example containing a PPE having an intrinsic viscosity of 0.4 dl/g.

The flow promotor (lubricant) was pentaerythritol stearate (PETS) available under the tradename GLYCOLUBE® from Lonza Inc. The glass fibers used were Type E glass fibers obtained from Johns Manville. The glass fibers had a diameter of 13 micrometers and a length of about 3 millimeter. Table 1 below shows details of the composition of Sample 1 and Sample 2 respectively.<br>
The components for each lead-free solder friendly sample were extruded in a 40mm twin-screw extruder (ZSK-40) manufactured by Krupp, Werner and Pfleiderer. The extruder had 5 barrels or heating zones set at temperatures of 293°C, 293°C, 293°C, 298°C, and 298°C. The die temperature was set at 298°C. The extruder was run at 250 rpm. The extrusion rate was 175 pounds per hour. The strand emanating from the extruder was pelletized, dried and subjected to injection molding to manufacture the test parts. The molding machine was a Cincinnati 220T. The amounts of each component employed in the various compositions are shown in Table 1. All ingredients were added directly in the extruder during extrusion.<br><br>
The injection molded samples were tested for their mechanical properties and thermal properties. The samples were subjected to tensile tests as per ASTM D 638, Notched Izod impact property tests as per ASTM D 256, and heat distortion temperature (HDT) tests as per ASTM D 648. Five samples were tested for each test.<br>
The samples were also subjected to a flammability test as per UL-94. The probability of a first time pass (achieving V-0) in a flammability test is expressed in terms of p(FTP). For samples that can achieve V-0 in a first pass, the p(FTP) value is 1 or as close to 1 as possible, while samples that are not capable of achieving V-0 in a first pass have a p(FTP) value that is significantly less than 1. In other words, the closer the p(FTP) value is to 1, the better the flame retardancy properties of the composition. The results for all the tests are shown in the Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
As illustrated above in Table 1, it can be seen that the sample manufactured from the low intrinsic viscosity PPO has superior mechanical, thermal and flammability properties. For example, the tensile strength and the impact properties of the Sample 1 is superior to the properties of the Sample 2.    Similarly when flammability<br><br>
properties are compared,.the Sample 1 shows a probability of a first time pass that is superior to that of Sample 2. As shown in the Table 2, the high temperature thermoplastic composition has a p(FTP) of greater than 0.9. As noted above, the high temperature thermoplastic composition can have a p(FTP) of 1.<br>
As illustrated above, the samples manufactured with an intrinsic viscosity of less than or equal to about 0.15 dl/g, produce high temperature thermoplastic compositions having superior mechanical, thermal and flammability properties. The high temperature thermoplastic compositions having the low intrinsic viscosity PPO can be advantageously used as a solder resistant support in electronic applications. The high temperature thermoplastic compositions can also be utilized for numerous applications in the automotive sector, the appliances sector, heavy equipment such as lathes, earth moving equipment, or the like.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
