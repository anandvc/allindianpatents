CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br><br>
[0001] The present application for patent claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/789,319, entitled "Encoder Assisted Frame Rate Up Conversion," filed April 4, 2006, assigned to the assignee hereof and hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
BACKGROUND Field<br><br>
[0003] The invention relates to multimedia signal processing and, more particularly, to video encoding and decoding.<br><br>
Background<br><br>
[0004] Multimedia processing systems, such as video encoders, may encode multimedia data using encoding methods based on international standards such as MPEG-x and H.26x standards. Such encoding methods generally are directed to compressing the multimedia data for transmission and/or storage. Compression is broadly the process of removing redundancy from the data.<br><br>
[0005] A video signal may be described in terms of a sequence of pictures, which include frames (an entire picture), or fields (e.g., an interlaced video stream comprises fields of alternating odd or even lines of a picture). As used herein, the term "frame" is broadly used to refer to a picture, a frame, or a field. Multimedia processors, such as video encoders, may encode a frame by partitioning it into blocks or "macroblocks" of, for example, 16x16 pixels. The encoder may further partition each macroblock into subb locks. Each subblock may further comprise additional subb locks. For example, subb locks of a macroblock may include 16x8 and 8x16 subb locks. Subb locks of the 8x16 subb locks may include 8x8 subb locks, and so forth. As used herein, the term "block" refers to either a macroblock or a subblock. <br><br>
[0006] Video encoding methods compress video signals by using lossless or lossy compression algorithms to compress each frame or blocks of the frame. Intra-frame coding refers to encoding a frame using data from that frame. Inter- frame coding refers to predictive encoding schemes such as schemes that comprise encoding a frame based on other, "reference," frames. For example, video signals often exhibit temporal redundancy in which frames near each other in the temporal sequence of frames have at least portions that match or at least partially match each other. Encoders can take advantage of this temporal redundancy to reduce the size of encoded data. [0007] Encoders may take advantage of this temporal redundancy by encoding a frame in terms of the difference between the frame and one or more reference frames. For example, video encoders may use motion compensation based algorithms that match blocks of the frame being encoded to portions of one or more other frames. The block of the encoded frame may be shifted in the frame relative to the matching portion of the reference frame. This shift is characterized by a motion vector. Any differences between the block and partially matching portion of the reference frame may be characterized in terms of a residual. The encoder may thus encode a frame as data that comprises one or more of the motion vectors and residuals for a particular partitioning of the frame. A particular partition of blocks for encoding the frame may be selected by approximately minimizing a cost function that, for example, balances encoding size with distortion to the content of the frame resulting from an encoding. [0008] Reference frames may include one or more prior frames of the video signal or one or more frames that follow the frame in the video signal in terms of output order. The H.264 standard, for example, includes a configuration that uses five reference frames in searching for the best matching block. In general, searching of more reference frames increases the ability of the encoder to find portions of one of the reference frames that closely matches the block of the frame being encoded. Better matches have a smaller difference to encode, which generally results in a more compact encoding. However, encoding such matches may still require a significant amount of bandwidth. Thus, a need exists for better ways of encoding video data.<br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
[0009] The system, method, and devices of the invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting <br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
[0027] The following detailed description is directed to certain specific aspects of the invention. However, the invention can be embodied in a multitude of different ways as defined and covered by the claims. In this description, reference is made to the drawings wherein like parts are designated with like numerals throughout. In the following description, specific details are given to provide a thorough understanding of the aspects described. However, it will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the aspects may be practiced without these specific details. For example, electrical components may be shown in block diagrams in order not to obscure the aspects in unnecessary detail. In other instances, such components, other structures and techniques may be shown in detail to further explain the aspects.<br><br>
[0028] Moreover, it is to be recognized that depending on the aspect, certain acts or events of any of the methods, processes, block diagrams, and flowcharts described herein can be performed in a different sequence, may be added, merged, or left out all together (e.g., not all described acts or events are necessary for the practice of the method). Moreover, in certain aspects, acts or events may be performed concurrently, e.g., through multi-threaded processing, interrupt processing, or multiple processors, rather than sequentially. It is further to be recognized that the methods, processes, block diagrams, and flowcharts described herein may be repeated, either in whole or in part. [0029] Aspects include systems and methods of improving processing in an encoder in a multimedia transmission system. Other aspects include method and systems of <br><br>
processing in a decoder in a multimedia transmission system. Multimedia data may include one or more of motion video, audio, still images, or any other suitable type of audio-visual data. For example, one aspect comprises a method of reduced encoding size in an encoder by encoding in terms of an interpolated frame. An interpolated frame is a frame that a decoder (or encoder) generates by interpolating data from nearby frames. One type of interpolated frame is a frame rate upconversion frame that is generated to increase the output frame rate of a video decoder. Such frames are typically not communicated between the encoder and decoder, but are generated at the decoder based on temporally proximal frames. It has been found that an encoder may achieve certain efficiencies by encoding a frame with reference to such an interpolated frame. In particular, the encoder may reduce the amount of motion compensation data in the encoded data for the frame that the decoder generates that motion compensation data in interpolating the frame, e.g., by reducing the amount of encoded residual data. [0030] Another aspect comprises using a standard multimedia encoding format to communicate the reference to the interpolated frame from the encoder to the decoder. Depending on the encoding format, using the standard encoding data format to encode the reference to the interpolated frame can further reduce the size of the encoded frame data output by the encoder, e.g., by communicating the reference to the interpolated frame by using bits.<br><br>
[0031] Figure 1 is a block diagram illustrating a multimedia communications system 100 according to one aspect. The system 100 includes an encoder device 110 in communication with a decoder device 150 via a network 140. In one example, the encoder device receives a multimedia signal from an external source 102 and encodes that signal for transmission on the network 140.<br><br>
[0032] In this example, the encoder device 110 comprises a processor 112 coupled to a memory 114 and a transceiver 116. The processor 112 encodes data from the multimedia data source and provides it to the transceiver 116 for communication over the network 140.<br><br>
[0033] In this example, the decoder device 150 comprises a processor 152 coupled to a memory 154 and a transceiver 156. The processor 152 may include one or more of a general purpose processor or a digital signal processor. The memory 154 may include one or more of solid state or disk based storage. The transceiver 156 is configured to receive multimedia data over the network 140 and provide it to the processor 152 for <br><br>
decoding. In one example, the transceiver 156 includes a wireless transceiver. The network 140 may comprise one or more of a wired or wireless communication system, including one or more of a Ethernet, telephone (e.g., POTS), cable, power-line, and fiber optic systems, and/or a wireless system comprising one or more of a code division multiple access (CDMA or CDMA2000) communication system, a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) system, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system a time division multiple access (TDMA) system such as GSM/GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)/EDGE (enhanced data GSM environment), a TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio) mobile telephone system, a wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) system, a high data rate (IxEV-DO or IxEV-DO Gold Multicast) system, an IEEE 802.11 system, a MediaFLO system, a DMB system, or a DVB-H system.<br><br>
[0034] Figure 2 graphically illustrates an aspect of a method of encoding a portion of a video frame in a system such as illustrated in Figure 1. Frames may include intra (I) frames that are encoded without reference to other frames, predictive (P) frames encoded with reference to temporally prior frames, and bi-predictive (B) frames that are encoded with respect to temporally prior and/or future frames.<br><br>
[0035] As illustrated in Figure 2, a frame 170 may be divided into a number of macroblocks 171a. Each macroblock 171a comprises an array of pixels, e.g., a 16x16 array of pixels of the frame 170. Further, the encoder 110 may partition the macroblocks 171 into any number of smaller blocks such as the 8x8 subblock 171b, or the 4x4 subblock 171c. Optionally, the encoder 110 may vary the subblock sizes within the frame 170 and/or between encoded frames 170. Collectively, the macroblocks 171a and the partitions of macroblocks such as subb locks 171b are referred to herein as "blocks" and referred to collectively with reference to item 171 of Figure 2. [0036] Encoded video frames 170 (or blocks 171 of the frames 170) may be encoded without dependency on other frames (e.g., intramode) or predictively based on other encoded frames (e.g., intermode). The particular mode of encoding used for a portion of the frame 170 may be referred to as a "mode" (of encoding). The encoder 110 may encode different portions of the frame 170, e.g., different blocks 171 or subblocks 171, using different modes. For example, motion estimation algorithms may be used to encode the frame 170 or one or more blocks 171 of the frame 170. One example of the encoder 110 encodes the frame 170 in terms of blocks that include blocks of sizes such <br><br>
as 16x16, 16x8, 8x16, 8x8, 8x4, 4x8, 4x4 (but other sizes may be used). The encoded frame 170 may comprise a partition of the frame 170 into a set of encoded blocks 171 that encodes substantially all the pixels of the frame 170. The encoded blocks 171 may be of different sizes and selected based on a cost function that allows comparison of different encoding strategies based on a weighted average of factors such as encoded data size and resulting distortion of the image.<br><br>
[0037] As noted above, one way of predicting video frames is using motion estimation algorithms that take advantage of temporal redundancy in video data to encode the frame 170 based on at least partially matching blocks 171 from one frame to another frame, e.g., a reference frame. Motion estimation algorithms identify blocks 176 in one or more reference frames 174 that are similar to (e.g., at least partially match) the blocks 171 of the frame 170 but possibly shifted in location in the encoded frame 174. Note that in various aspects, motion estimation algorithms may use reference frames 174 that were previous to the current frame 170 in time, subsequent to the frame 170, or both. The blocks 171 of the frame 170 are encoded in terms of a motion vector indicative of positional differences between the block 171 and the block 176 and residual data indicative of the differences between the pixel values of the block 171 of the frame 170 relative to a reference block (e.g., block 176 of a reference frame 174c) found in a list of one or more references frames 174 (e.g., references frames 174a, 174b, 174c, 174d, and 174e). The reference frames 174 may be a temporally ordered list 180 of frames that precede or follow the frame 170 in the video signal. As shown in Figure 2, the encoder 110 may compare the block 171b of the frame 170 to the reference frames 174 to identify corresponding blocks such as the block 176 in the frame 174c. [0038] The encoder 110 may calculate motion compensation data, e.g., motion vectors and residuals, for each of a group of blocks such as 16x16, 16x8, 8x16, 8x8, 8x4, 4x8, and 4x4 blocks (partitions) of the blocks 171. The encoder 110 may first calculate the motion compensation data for larger blocks 171, e.g., 16x16, then for calculate the motion compensation data for each subblock of the larger blocks, e.g., 16x8, 8x8, etc. The encoder 110 can select a particular partition or set of the blocks 171 of one or more sizes that covers substantially all of the frame 170. The encoder 110 may select particular blocks and respective predictive data for each portion of the frame 170 based on a cost function, e.g., a rate-distortion (RD) function, that comprises a measure of that trades off between encoding size and distortion based on the encoding <br><br>
data size of a frame or portion of the frame using a particular set of motion vectors and residuals for a particular set of the blocks of the frame and corresponding estimates of the resulting image distortion. Encoders 110 may use any suitable cost function, including those known in the art. For example, suitable cost functions are disclosed in "Rate-Constrained Coder Control and Comparison of Video Coding Standards," IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY, VOL. 13, NO. 7, 688 (July 2003). The cost functions may comprise, for example, rate- distortion functions, smallest residue, and/or sum of absolute difference (SAD) functions.<br><br>
[0039] Figure 3 graphically illustrates portions of a method of encoding a portion of the video frame 170 in the system 100 using an interpolated frame. As noted above, Frame Rate Up Conversion (FRUC) is the process of video interpolation at the video decoder 150 to increase the frame rate of the reconstructed video. Such frames can be used to increase the rate that the decoder 150 generates frames to, for example, improve the perceived quality of a transmitted video signal. As illustrated in Figure 3, a FRUC frame 174f may also be generated by the encoder 110 for use in encoding video frames 170. For example, the FRUC frame 174f may be generated to correspond to the same time index as the frame to be encoded. It is to be recognized that FRUC frames may be generated for various types of frames, e.g., B frames or P frames.<br><br>
[0040] As illustrated in Figure 3, the encoder 110 may add the FRUC frame 174f to the list of reference frames for encoding the frame 170. It has been found that in some instances portions of the frame 170 may be predictive Iy encoded more compactly with reference to an interpolated frame at the same time index of the frame 170. A reduction in the size of the encoded data can be achieved because the reference data of the FRUC frame may be a closer match to the frame data to be encoded, and thus, the motion data (e.g., a motion vector or a residual) would be reduced or perhaps eliminated (if an exact or sufficiently close match is located). The decoder 150 can instead interpolate the FRUC frame and use its data in place of the omitted motion compensation data. [0041] In operation, in one aspect, if the number of reference frames to be considered for predictive encoding (e.g., the size of the reference list 180) is N (e.g., 5), encoded blocks may be encoded with reference to a particular reference frame number, 0 .. N-I, in the encoded data for the encoded block. When a block is encoded with reference to the FRUC frame 174f, the reference frame number may be set to N, one higher than <br><br>
would be found in a typical list of reference frames 174. Thus, the same field in the encoded data is used to indicate encoding based on an interpolated reference frame and to indicate encoding based on a non-interpolated reference frame. For example, if the encoder 110 is configured to generate a bitstream compliant with a standard syntax such as a H.264 bitstream syntax, identify the reference frame as 0 to N - 1 in a 3 bit field according to an encoding specification such as a configuration of standard H.264, the encoder 110 may identify the use of the additional reference frame by setting the reference frame field value to N, thereby using the same bits in the same standard encoding field as would be used to identify one of the reference frames 0 to N-I . The decoder 150 may thus identify the use of an interpolated FRUC frame when it decodes blocks based on encoded data. Further, as the reference frame number is used in standard encoding formats, the encoder 150 may encode with reference to the FRUC frame without including additional data in its output encoded data. [0042] Further, by adding the FRUC frame to the list 180 of reference frames 174, little additional complexity is added to reference frame searching algorithm (other than the additional searching performed due to the increase in the size of the reference list) in obtaining the reduced encoding size from using FRUC frames as references for encoding. Moreover, it has been found that further encoding size reductions can be obtained by using existing data fields in the encoded data format to identify encoding in terms of FRUC frames. For example, the motion vector (MV) and residual (or coded block pattern (CBP)) indicator fields in the encoded data format, along with the reference to an additional position in the reference frame list (as discussed above) can be used to encode blocks based on the FRUC frame 174f without adding data fields to the encoding data for a block or frame. Table 1, below, describes four examples of encoding modes using the MV and CBP fields in encoded data to encode a block in terms of the FRUC frame 174f in the reference list 190. <br><br>
Table 1.<br><br><br>
[0043] Figure 4 is a flowchart illustrating one example of a method 200 of encoding a portion of a video stream in the system 100. The method 200 begins at a flowchart item 222, in which the encoder 110 generates at least one interpolated frame, e.g., the frame 174f. The interpolated frame may include a FRUC frame. Next at a flowchart item 224, the encoder 110 identifies a plurality, e.g.., the list 180 of reference frames 174 that <br><br>
includes the interpolated frame, e.g., the frame 174f. In one aspect, a contemporaneous FRUC frame is interpolated for each predicted frame to be encoded. In one aspect, a contemporaneous FRUC frame 174f is generated and inserted into the list 180 for each B frame that is encoded. In one aspect, frames are generated according to a fixed group of pictures (GOP) pattern (the pattern of frames defined between each I frame) such as a "IBPBPBP" pattern. To encode B frames in such a GOP implementation, an FRUC frame is interpolated from P frames neighboring the B frame and added to the list 180 of reference frames. In another aspect, the encoder 110 may generate frames according to an adaptive GOP encoding that adjusts based on the video content. In one example of an adaptive GOP scheme, multiple B frames may be encoded between each P frame. For example, three B-frames may be encoded between the two P-frames. For each B- frame, an independent FRUC frame may be generated at the same time instance as the particular B-frame. In one aspect, the FRUC frame corresponding to each B frame is inserted in the reference frame list 180 for each B frame. Note that to generate the independent FRUC frame for each B frame, data from each the adjacent P frames is scaled accordingly.<br><br>
[0044] Moving to a flowchart item 228, the encoder 110 encodes at least a portion of a frame based at least on the plurality of reference frames 174. It is to be recognized that portions or blocks of any particular frame 170 may or may not be encoded with reference to the interpolated frame 174f, depending on the content of the particular to- be-encode frame 170 and the particular reference frames 174. As described above, the encoder 110 evaluates the cost function of encoding based on the interpolated frame as compared to the remaining frames in the reference list, and selects the reference frame accordingly. The method 200 may be repeated for each portion or block 171 of the frame 170 and may be repeated for each predictively encoded frame in the video signal. [0045] Figure 5 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the encoder 110 for processing video data in accordance with the method 200. The encoder 110 includes modules or blocks such as a module 302 for generating an interpolated frame, a module 304 for identifying reference frames, and a module 306 for encoding a frame. The module 302 for generating an interpolated frame is configured to generate at least one interpolated frame, e.g., the frame 174f, according to the flowchart item 222 of Figure 4. The module 304 for identifying reference frames is configured to identify a plurality of reference frames 174, e.g., the list 180, that includes the interpolated frame, e.g., the <br><br>
frame 174f, for encoding the frame 170 according to the flowchart item 224 of Figure 4. The module 306 for encoding a frame is configured to encode at least a portion of the frame 170 based at least on the list 180 of reference frames 174.<br><br>
[0046] Figure 6 is a flowchart illustrating in more detail an example of a method 400 of decoding video data such as encoded by the method 200. The method begins at a flowchart item 402 in which the decoder 150 receives encoded data indicative of an interpolated reference frame. In one aspect, the encoded data comprises a standard encoded data format in which interpolated frame references are encoded as discussed above with reference to Table 1. In one aspect, the decoder 150 identifies the reference frame as being an interpolated based on the reference frame index being set to N, where non-interpolated reference frames are numbered 0 to N - 1. Proceeding to a flowchart item 406, the decoder 150 generates at least a portion of the interpolated frame. In one aspect, the interpolated frame is a FRUC frame. The generation of the interpolated FRUC frame may be simplified because the frame is not displayed (other FRUC frames may still be generated for frame rate upconversion, such FRUC frames may be generated without this simplified processing to preserve picture quality). For example, motion vector merging and scaling may be omitted. Motion vector smoothing may also be simplified, e.g., to a simplified version of 3x3 median smoothing. Moving to a flowchart item 408, the decoder 150 decodes at least a portion of a predicted frame based at least in part on the interpolated frame. The decoder 150 may repeat the acts of method 400 for each block or frame in a video signal. In addition, the decoder 150 may decode other blocks or frames without reference to interpolated frames. [0047] Figure 7 is a block diagram illustrating an example of the decoder 150 in accordance with the method 400. The decoder 150 includes modules or blocks such as a module 420 for receiving encoded data, a module 424 for generating an interpolated frame, and a module 426 for decoding a predicted frame. The module 420 for receiving encoded data is configured to receive encoded data indicative of a reference frame for at least a portion of a predicted frame, e.g., as described with reference to the flowchart item 402 of Figure 6. The module 424 for generating an interpolated frame is configured to generate at least a portion of the interpolated frame. In one aspect, the interpolated frame is a FRUC frame, e.g., as described with reference to the flowchart item 406 of Figure 6. The module 426 for decoding a predicted frame is configured to <br><br>
decode at least a portion of a predicted frame based at least in part on the interpolated frame, e.g., as described with reference to the flowchart item 408 of Figure 6. [0048] In view of the above, one will appreciate that the invention overcomes the problem of encoding multimedia data such as video data.
