The present invention relates to a new process for the preparation of precipitated silica, to precipitated silicas which are in particular in the form of powder, of substantially spherical beads or of granules, and to their application as a reinforcing filler for elastomers.<br>
It is known that precipitated silica has been employed for a long time as a white reinforcing filler in elastomers.<br>
However, like any reinforcing filler, it is appropriate that it should be capable of, on the one hand, being handled and above all, on the other hand, of being easily incorporated into the mixtures.<br>
It is known in general that, to obtain the optimum reinforcing jroperties conferred by a filler, it is appropriate that the latter should be present n the elastomer matrix in a final form which is both as finely divided as possible and distributed as homogeneously as possible. However, such conditions can be achieved only insofar as, on the one hand, the filler has a very good ability to be corporated into the matrix during mixing with the elastomer (incorporability of he filler) and to disintegrate or to deagglomerate into the form of a very fine lowder (disintegration of the filler) and as, on the other hand, the powder esulting from the abovementioned disintegration process can itself, in its turn, be erfectly and homogeneously dispersed in the elastomer (dispersion of the owder).<br>
Moreover, for reasons of mutual affinities, silica particles have an nfortunate tendency, in the elastomer matrix, to agglomerate with each other, hese silica/silica interactions have a detrimental consequence of limiting the sinforcing properties to a level that is substantially lower than that which if would" e theoretically possible to expect if all the silica/elastomer interactions capable "<br><br>
of being created during the mixing operation were actually obtained (this theoretical number of silica/elastomer interactions being, as is well known, directly proportional to the external surface of the silica employed).<br>
Furthermore, in the raw state, such silica/silica interactions tend to increase the stiffness and the consistency of the mixtures, thus making them more difficult to process.<br>
The problem arises of having available fillers which, while being capable of being relatively large in size, have a very good dispersibility in elastomers.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to overcome the abovementioned disadvantages and to solve the abovementioned problem.<br>
More precisely, its aim is especially to propose a new process for the preparation of precipitated silica which, advantageously, has a very good dispersibility (and disintegratability) and very satisfactory reinforcing properties, in particular which, when employed as a reinforcing filler for elastomers, imparts excellent rheological properties to the latter while providing them with good mechanical properties.<br>
The invention also relates to precipitated silicas which, preferably, are in the form of powder, of substantially spherical beads or, optionally, of granules, and which, while being of relatively large size, have a very good dispersibility (and disintegratability) and very satisfactory reinforcing properties.<br>
It relates, finally, to the use of the said precipitated silicas as reinforcing fillers for elastomers.<br>
In the description which follows, the BET specific surface is determined according to the Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method described in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Vol. 60, page 309, February 1938<br>
-	r<br>
and corresponding to NFT standard 45007 (November 1987).<br><br>
The CTAB specific surface is the outer surface determined according to NFT standard 45007 (November 1987) (5.12).<br>
The DOP oil uptake is determined according to NFT standard 30-022 (March 1953) by using dioctyl phthalate.<br>
The packing density (PD) is measured according to NFT standard 030100.<br>
The pH is measured according to ISO standard 787/9 (pH of a suspension at a concentration of 5 % in water).<br>
Finally, it is specified that the given pore volumes are measured by mercury porosimetry, the pore diameters being calculated from the Washburn relationship with an angle of contact theta equal to 130° and a surface tension gamma equal to 484 dynes/cm (Micromeritics 9300 porosimeter).<br>
The dispersibility and the disintegratability of the silica according to the invention can be quantified by means of a specific disintegration test.<br>
The disintegration test is carried out according to the following procedure:<br>
the cohesion of the agglomerates is assessed by a particle size measurement (using laser scattering), . performed on a silica suspension previously disintegrated by ultrasonic treatment; the disintegratability of the silica is thus measured (rupture of objects from 0.1 to a few tens of microns). The disintegration under ultrasound is performed with the aid of a Vibracell Bioblock (600 W) sonic transducer equipped with a probe 19 mm in diameter. The particle size measurement is performed by laser scattering on a Sympatec particle size analyser.<br>
2 grams of silica are measured out into a specimen tube (height: 6 cm and diameter: 4 cm) and are made up to 50 grams by adding demineralized<br>
water; an aqueous suspension containing 4 % of silica is thus produced, which is homogenized for 2 minutes by magnetic stirring.  The disintegration  under<br><br>
ultrasound is next performed as follows: with the probe immersed to a depth of 4 cm, the power is adjusted so as to obtain a needle deflection on the power dial indicating 20 % (which corresponds to an energy of 120 watts/cm dissipated by the end of the probe). The disintegration is performed for 420 seconds. The particle size measurement is then carried out after a known volume (expressed in ml) of the homogenized suspension has been introduced into the cell of the particle size analyser.<br>
The value of the median diameter 05o which is obtained is proportionally smaller the higher the disintegratability of the silica. The ratio (10 x volume of dispersion introduced (in ml))/opticai density of the suspension detected by the particle size analyser (this optical density is of the order of 20) is also determined. This ratio is an indication of the proportion of fines, that is to say of the content of particles smaller than 0.1 nm, which are not detected by the particle size analyser. This ratio, called the ultrasonic disintegration factor (FQ) is proportionally higher the higher the disintegratability of the silica.<br>
One of the subjects of the invention is a process for the preparation of precipitated silica of the type including the reaction of a silicate with an acidifying agent, whereby a suspension of precipitated silica is obtained, followed by the separation and the drying of this suspension, in which the precipitation is :arried out in the following manner:<br>
(i) an initial base stock comprising a silicate of alkali metal M and an<br>
electrolyte is formed, the silicate concentration (expressed as SiOj) in the said<br>
nitial base stock being lower than 20 g/l,	(ii)  the   acidifying   agent  is<br>
idded to the said base stock until at least 5 % of the quantity of M2O present in he said base stock is neutralized,<br>
(iii) acidifying agent and a silicate of alkali metal M are added imultaneously to the reaction mixture such that the ratio of the quantity of ilicate added (expressed as Si02) (the quantity of silicate present in the initial<br><br>
base stock (expressed as SiO2), called the degree of consolidation, is greater than 4 and at most 100,<br>
characterized in  that the  said process  includes  one of the  following  two operations (a) or (b):<br>
(a)	at least one aluminium compound A and then a basic agent are added to the reaction mixture after stage (iii), the said separation comprising a filtration and a disintegration of the cake originating from this filtration, the said disintegration being performed in the presence of at least one aluminium compound B,<br>
(b)	a silicate and at least one aluminium compound A are added simultaneously to the reaction mixture after stage (iii) and, when the said separation comprises a filtration and a disintegration of the cake originating from this filtration, the disintegration is preferably performed in the presence of at least one aluminium compound B.<br>
It has thus been found that the introduction of aluminium - this being according to a particular method - combined with a low silicate concentration (expressed as Si02) and of electrolyte in the initial base' stock and at an appropriate degree of consolidation during the simultaneous addition stage constitutes an important condition for imparting their excellent properties to the products obtained, especially very satisfactory reinforcing properties.<br>
It should be noted, in general, that the process concerned is a process for the synthesis of precipitated silica, that is to say that an acidifying agent is reacted with a silicate in very special conditions.<br>
The choice of the acidifying agent and of the silicate is made in a manner which is well known per se.<br>
It may be recalled that the acidifying agent generally employed is a strong inorganic acid such as sulphuric acid, nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, or an organic acid such as acetic acid, formic acid or carbonic acid.<br><br>
The acidifying agent may be dilute or concentrated; its normality may be between 0.4 and 36 N, for example between 0.6 and 1.5 N.<br>
In particular, in the case where the acidifying agent is sulphuric acid, its concentration may be between 40 and 180 g/l, for example between 60 and 130 g/l.<br>
It is possible, furthermore, to employ as a silicate any common form of silicates such as metasilicates, disilicates and advantageously an alkali metal silicate, especially sodium or potassium silicate.<br>
The silicate may exhibit a concentration, expressed as silica, of between 40 and 330 g/l, for example between 60 and 300 g/l, in particular between 60 and 250 g/l.<br>
In general, sulphuric acid is employed as the acidifying agent, and sodium silicate as the silicate.<br>
In the case where sodium silicate is employed, the latter generally exhibits an SiO2/Na2O weight ratio of between 2 and 4, for example between 3.0 and 3.7.<br>
Insofar as the process of preparation of the invention is more particularly concerned, the precipitation is done in a specific manner according to the following stages.<br>
First of all a base stock is formed which includes some silicate and an electrolyte (stage (i)). The quantity of silicate present in the initial base stock advantageously represents only a part of the total quantity of silicate introduced into the reaction.<br>
According to a characteristic of the process of preparation according to the invention, the silicate concentrate in the initial base stock is (higher than 0 g/l and) lower than 20 g of SiO2 per litre. This concentration may be at most 11 g/l and, optionally, at most 8 g/l.<br><br>
Especially when the separation performed subsequently during the process according to the invention includes a filtration performed by means of a filter press (and more particularly in the case where it is desired to prepare silicas which have a CTAB specific surface of at least 140 m2/g), this concentration may  be at least 8 g/l, in particular between 10 and 15 g/l, for example between 11 and 15g/l; the drying used later in the process according to the invention may be performed by spraying by means of a multinozzle sprayer.<br>
The base stock may include an electrolyte. Nevertheless, preferably, no electrolyte is employed in the course of the process of preparation according to the invention; in particular, the initial base stock preferably does not include any electrolyte.<br>
The term electrolyte is understood here in its normal accepted meaning, that is to say that it denotes any ionic or molecular substance which, when in solution, decomposes or dissociates to form ions or charged particles. An electrolyte which may be mentioned is a salt from the group of the alkali and alkaline-earth metal salts, especially the salt of the metal of the starting silicate and of the acidifying agent, for example sodium sulphate in the case of the reaction of a sodium silicate with sulphuric acid.<br>
The second stage consists in adding the acidifying agent to the base stock of composition described above (stage (ii)).<br>
Thus, in this second stage the acidifying agent is added to the said initial base stock until at least 5 %, preferably at least 50 %, of the MjO quantity present in the said initial base stock is neutralized.<br>
In this second stage the acidifying agent is preferably added to the said initial base stock until 50 to 99 % of the quantity of M2O present in the said initial base stock is neutralized.<br>
Once the desired value of neutralized M2O quantity is reached, a simultaneous addition (stage (iii)) Is then undertaken, of acidifying agent and of a<br><br>
quantity of silicate of alkali metal M such that the degree of consolidation, that is to say the ratio of the quantity of silicate added (expressed as SiO2)the quantity of silicate present in the initial base stock (expressed as SiO2) is higher than 4 and at most 100.<br>
According to an alternative form of the process of the invention this simultaneous addition is undertaken, of acidifying agent and of a quantity of silicate of alkali metal M such that the degree of consolidation is more particularly between 12 and 100, preferably between 12 and 50, especially between 13 and 40.<br>
According to another alternative form of the process of the invention this simultaneous addition is undertaken, of acidifying agent and of a quantity of silicate of alkali metal M such that the degree of consolidation is rather higher than 4 and lower than 12, preferably between 5 and 11.5, especially between 7.5 and 11. This alternative form is, in general, used when the silicate concentration in the initial base stock is at least 8 g/l, in particular between 10 and 15 g/l, for example between 11 and 15 g/l.<br>
Throughout the stage (iii) the quantity of acidifying agent which is addSd is preferably such that 80 to 99 %, for example 85 to 97 %, of the quantity of M2O which is added is neutralized.<br>
In stage (iii) it is possible to undertake the simultaneous addition of acidifying agent and of silicate at a first pH plateau of the reaction mixture, pH,, and then at a second pH plateau of the reaction mixture, pHz, such that 7 
According to an essential characteristic of the process of preparation according to the invention, the latter includes one of the two operations, (a) or (b) mentioned above, that is to say:<br>
. (a) at least one aluminium compound A and then a basic agent are added, after stage (iii) to the reaction mixture, the separation used in the process<br><br>
comprising a filtration and a disintegration of the cal<e originating from this filtration the said disintegration being perfonmed in presence of at least one aluminium compound b or></e>
(b) a silicate and at least one aluminium compound A are added simultaneously, after stage (iii) to the reaction mixture and, when the separation used in the process comprises a filtration and a disintegration of the cake originating from this filtration, the disintegration is preferably perfomied in the presence of at least one aluminium compound B.<br>
In a first alternative form of the process of preparation according to the invention (that is to say when the latter includes the operation (a)), the following successive stages are performed advantageously after having carried out the precipitation according to the stages (i), (ii) and (iii) described above:<br>
(iv) at least one aluminium compound A is added to the reaction mixture (that is to say to the reaction suspension or slurry obtained),<br>
(v) a basic agent is added to the reaction mixture preferably until a pH value of the reaction mixture of between 6.5 and 10, in particular between 7.2 and 8.6, is obtained,<br>
(vi) acidifying agent is added to the reaction mixture, preferably until a pH value of the reaction mixture of between 3 and 5, in particular between 3.4 and 4.5, is obtained.<br>
After the simultaneous addition of stage (iii) it may then be advantageous to perform a maturing of the reaction mixture, it being possible for this maturing to last, for example, from 1 to 60 minutes, in particular from 3 to 30 minutes.<br>
In this first alternative form it is desirable, between stage (iii) and stage (iv), and especially before the said optional maturing, to add an additional quantity of acidifying agent to the reaction mixture. This addition is generally<br><br>
aone until a pM value of the reaction mixture of between 3 and 6.5, In particular between 4 and 6, is obtained.<br>
The acidifying agent employed during this addition is generally identical with that employed during stages (11), (ill) and (vl) of the first alternative form of the process of preparation according to the invention.<br>
A maturing of the reaction mixture is usually performed between stage (v) and (vi), for example for 2 to 60 minutes, in particular for 5 to 45 minutes.<br>
Similarly, a maturing of the reaction mixture Is In most cases performed after stage (vi), for example for 2 to 60 minutes, in particular for 5 to 30 minutes.<br>
The basic agent employed during stage (iv) may be a solution of aqueous ammonia or, preferably, a solution of sodium hydroxide (or soda).<br>
In a second alternative form of the process of preparation according to the invention (that Is to say when the latter includes the operation (b)), a stage (Iv) is performed after the stages (i), (ii) and (III) described previously, which consists in adding a silicate and at least one aluminium compound A simultaneously to the reaction mixture.<br>
After the simultaneous addition of stage (iv) it may then be advantageous to perform a maturing of the reaction mixture, it being possible for this maturing to last, for example, from 2 to 60 minutes, in particular from 5 to 30 minutes.<br>
In this ser.ond alternative form it is desirable, after stage (Iv), and especially after this optional maturing, to add an additional quantity of acidifying agent to the reaction mixture. This addition is generally done until a pH value of<br>
	the reaction mixture of between 3 and 6.5, in particular between 4 and 6   ■=<br>
obtained.<br><br>
The acidifying agent employed during this addition is generally identical with that employed during stages (ii) and (iii) of the second alternative fomi of the process of preparation according to the invention.<br>
A maturing of the react/on mixture Is usually perfomied after this addition of acidifying agent, for example for 1 to 60 minutes, in particular for 3 to 30 minutes.<br>
The aluminium compound A employed in the process of preparation according to the invention is generally an organic or inorganic aluminium salt.<br>
By way of examples of an organic salt there may be mentioned especially the salts of carboxylic or polycarboxylic acids, like the salts of acetic, citric, tartaric or oxalic acid.<br>
By way of examples of an inorganic salt there may be mentioned especially halides and oxyhalides (like chlorides and oxychlorides), nitrates, phosphates, sulphates and oxysulphates.<br>
In practice, the aluminium compound A may be employed in the form of a solution, generally aqueous.<br>
An   aluminium   sulphate   is   preferably   employed   as   aluminium . compound A.<br>
The temperature of the reaction mixture is generally between 60 and 98°C.<br>
According to an alternative form of the invention the reaction is performed at a constant temperature of between 70 and 96°C.<br>
.According to another alternative form of the invention the temperature at the end of the reaction is higher than the temperature at the beginning of reaction; the temperature at the beginning of the reaction is thus maintained preferably between 70 and 96°C and the temperature is then raised over a few minutes, preferably up to a value of between 75 and 98°C, which value it is<br><br>
maintained until the end of the reaction; the operations (a) or (b) are thus usually performed at this constant temperature value.<br>
At the outcome of the stages which have just been described a silica slurry is obtained which Is then separated (liquid-solid separation).<br>
In the first alternative form of the process of the preparation according to the invention (that is to say when the latter includes the operation (a)), this separation comprises a filtration (followed by washing if necessary) and a disintegration, the said disintegration being performed in the presence of at least one aluminium compound B and, preferably, in the presence of an acidifying agent as described above (in this latter case the aluminium compound B and the acidifying agent are advantageously added simultaneously).<br>
The disintegration operation, which may be carried out, for example, by passing the filter cake through a mill of the colloid or bead type, makes it possible in particular to lower the viscosity of the suspension to be subsequently dried.<br>
In the second alternative form of the process of preparation according to the invention (that is to say when the latter includes the operation (b)), the separation also comprises, in general, a filtration (followed by washing if necessary) and a disintegration, the said disintegration being preferably performed in the presence of at least one aluminium compound B and, in general, in the presence of an acidifying agent as described above (in this latter case the aluminium compound B and the acidifying agent are advantageously added simultaneously).<br>
The aluminium compound B is usually different from the aluminium compound A mentioned above and generally consists of an alkali metal, especially potassium, or, very preferably, sodium, aluminate.<br>
The quantities of the aluminium compounds A and B employed in the process of preparation according to the invention are preferably such that the<br><br>
precipitatea silica prepared contains at least 0.35 %, in particular at least 0.45 %, for example between 0.50 and 1.50%, or even between 0.75 and 1.40 %, by weight of aluminium.<br>
Tfie separation used in the process of preparation according to the invention usually includes a filtration performed by means of any suitable method, for example by means of a belt filter, a rotary vacuum filter or, preferably, a filter press.<br>
The suspension of precipitated silica thus recovered (filter cake) is then dried.<br>
This drying may be done according to any method that is known per se.<br>
The drying is preferably done by spraying.<br>
Any suitable type of sprayer may be employed for this purpose, especially a turbine, nozzle, liquid-pressure or two-fluid sprayer.<br>
The drying is, for example, performed by spraying by means of a multinozzle sprayer especially when the silicate concentration in the initial base stock is at least 8 g/l (and lower than 20 g/l), in particular of between 10 and 15g/l (and more particularly in-the case where it is desired to prepare silicas which have a CTAB specific surface of at least 140 m/g).<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention, the suspension to be dried has a solids content higher than 15 % by weight, preferably higher than 17 % by weight and, for example, higher than 20 % by weight. The drying is then preferably performed by means of a multinozzle sprayer.<br>
The precipitated silica capable of being obtained according to this<br>
embodiment of the invention and preferably by using a filter press is<br>
advantageously in the form of substantially spherical beads, preferably of a	<br>
mean size of at least 80 nm.<br><br>
It should be noted that dry material for example silica In pulverulent form may be also added to the filter cake after the filtration, at a subsequent stage of the process.<br>
At the end of the drying, a stage of milling may be undertaken on the product recovered, especially on the product obtained by drying a suspension which has a solids content higher than 15 % by weight. The precipitated silica which is then obtainable is generally in the form of a powder, preferably with a mean size of at least 15 m, in particular between 15 and 60 m, for example between 20 and 45 m.<br>
The milled products with the desired particle size can be separated from any nonconforming products by means, for example, of vibrating screens which have appropriate mesh sizes, and the nonconforming products thus recovered can be returned to the milling.<br>
Similarly, according to another embodiment of the invention, the suspension to be dried has a solids content of at most 15 % by weight. The drying is then generally performed by means of a turbine sprayer. The precipitated silica which is then obtainable according to this embodiment of the invention and preferably by using a rotary vacuum filter is generally in the form of a powder, preferably with a mean size of at least 15 im, in particular between 30 and 150 nm, for example between 45 and 120 m.<br>
Finally, the product which has been dried (especially from a suspension which has a solids content of at most 15 % by weight) or milled can, according to another embodiment of the invention, be subjected to an agglomeration stage.<br>
Agglomeration is here intended to mean any process which enables finely divided objects to be bonded together in order to bring them into the form of objects of larger size and which are mechanically stronger.<br><br>
These processes are especially direct compression, wet-route granulation (that is to say with the use of a binder such as water, silica slurry, etc.), extrusion and, preferably, dry compacting.<br>
When this last technique is used it may be found advantageous, before starting the compacting, to deaerate the pulverulent products (an operation which is also called predensifying or degassing), so as to remove the air included therein and to ensure a more uniform compacting.<br>
The precipitated silica which can be obtained according to this embodiment of the invention is advantageously in the form of granules, preferably at least 1 mm in size, in particular between 1 and 10 mm.<br>
At the end of the agglomeration stage the products may be classified to a desired size, for example by screening, and then packaged for their future use.<br>
The powders, as well as the beads, of precipitated silica which are obtained by the process according to the" invention thus offer the advantage, among others, of providing access to granules such as those mentioned above, in a simple, efficient and economical manner, especially by conventional forming Operations, such as, for example, granulation or compacting, without the latter resulting in degradation capable of masking, or even annihilating, the good intrinsic properties associated with these powders or these beads, as may be the case in the prior art when using conventional powders.<br>
Other subjects of the invention consist of new precipitated silicas<br>

Accordingly, tlie present iiivention provides a process for preparing precipitated silica comprising reacting a silicate with an acidifying agent to produce a suspension of precipitated silica and, then, separating and drying the suspension, wherein the precipitation is canied out by the steps comprising: (i) forming an initial base stock comprising the silicate of alkali metal M and MO, said stock initially having a silicate concentration (expressed as SiO) lower than about 20 g/1; (ii) adding the acidifying agent to said base stock until at least about 5% of the quantity of M2O present in said base stock is neutralized and (iii) adding simultaneously additional acidifying agent and silicate to said base stock such that the ratio of the quantity of silicate added (expressed as SiOytlie quantity of silicate present in the initial base stock (expressed as SiO2) is greater than about 4 and at most about 100, characterized in that at least one aluminium compound A such as herein described, and either then a basic agent or simultaneously a silicate are added to the reaction mixture after stage (iii), the said separation comprising a filtration and a disintegration of the cake originating from this filtration, the said disintegration being performed in the presence of at least one aluminium compound B such as herein described.<br><br><br>
The following were introduced into a stainless steel reactor provided with a stirring system using propellers and with heating using a jacket:<br>
-	733 litres of water, and<br>
-	46.5 litres of a solution of sodium silicate (SiO2/Na2O weight ratio of 3.4) with a concentration expressed as silica of 235 g/l.<br>
The concentration of silicate expressed as Si02 in the initial base ' stock is thus 14 g/l. The temperature of the solution was then raised to 80oC while being kept stirred.The entire reaction was canied out at 80oC and with stirring. Dilute sulphuric acid with a density of 1.050 at 20X was then introduced at a rate of 5.4 l/min for a period of 9 minutes ; following addition, the neutralisation ratio in the base stock was 78 %. i.e., 78 % of the quantity of Na2O present In the initial base stock had been neutralised.<br>
Simultaneous introduction of a sodium silicate solution of the type described above at a rate of 4.3 l/min and of dilute sulphuric acid also of the type described above and at a rate which was regulated sa as to maintain a pH:<br><br>
-	of 8.5 ± 0.1 for the first 55 minutes, then<br>
-	of 7.8 ± 0.1 for the final 35 minutes,<br>
in reaction medium, was then effected over 90 minutes.<br>
During this simultaneous addition step, the instantaneous neutralisation ratio was 94 %. i.e., 94 % of the quantity of NajO added (per min) was neutralised.<br>
The consolidation ratio following simultaneous addition was 8.3.<br>
A solution of aluminium sulphate of density at 20°C equal to 1.2 is then introduced into the reaction medium at a rate of 4.6 l/min for 6 minutes. At the end of this addition, 18 % strength concentrated soda is introduced into the 'eaction medium at a rate of 3.8 l/min until the pH of the reaction medium is squal to 8.0.<br>
The introduction of soda is then stopped and maturing of the reaction nedlum is undertaken at a temperature of 80°C for 20 minutes.<br>
Dilute sulphuric acid with a density of 1.050 at 20°C is then ntroduced at a rate of 4.0 l/min until the pH of the reaction medium is equal o3.7.<br>
The introduction of acid is then stopped and maturing of the reaction medium is undertaken at a temperature of 80°C for 10 minutes.<br>
The entire reaction period is 159 minutes.<br>
A slurry of precipitated silica Is thus obtained which is filtered and washed by means of a filter press.<br>
The cake obtained is next fluidized by mechanical and chemical action (simultaneous addition of sulphuric acid and of a quantity of sodium aluminate corresponding to an Al/SiOj weight ratio of 0.25 %). After this disintegration operation the resulting slurry, with a pH equal to 6.5 and a loss of ignition equal to 79.0 % (and hence a solids content of 21.0 % by weight), Is sprayed by means of a nozzle sprayer.<br><br>
The  characteristics  of the  silica   P1   obtained  in t\e  fomi   of substantially spherical beads (in accordance with the invention; are then the<br><br>
The characteristics of the silica prepared in Example 1 312 those of a commercial silica sold in the form of substantially spherical beads oy RHONE-POULENC CHIMIE as a reinforcing filler for elastomers, in this esse the silica ZEOSYL® 175 MP (referred to as MP1), are reported in Table 1 belov.<br><br><br><br><br>
The formulations are prepared in the following manner:<br>
The following are introduced into an internal mixer (Banbury type), in	'<br>
this order and at the times and temperatures of the mixing which are shown in brackets :<br>
-	S.B.R. 1955 S 25, B.R. 1220 and natural rubber (to)(60°C)<br>
-	the X50S and 2/3 of the silica (IQ + 1 min)(80°C)<br>
-	the ZnO, the stearic acid, the 6PPD and 1/3of the silica (to + 2min)(100°C)<br>
The discharge from the mixer (mix drop) takes place when the chamber temperature reaches 165°C (that is to say at approximately to + 5 min 10 s). The mix is introduced onto a roll mill, the rolls being kept at 30°C, to be calendered thereon. The CBS, the DPG and the sulphur are introduced onto this mill.<br>
After homogenization and three fine passes the final mixture is calendered into the form of sheets from 2.5 to 3 mm in thickness.<br>
The results of the tests are the following :   .<br><br>
1- Rheological properties<br>
The measurements are carried out on the formulations in the raw state.<br>
The results are reported in Table II below. The apparatus employed for conducting the measurements has been shown.<br><br>
The formulation obtained from the silica according to the invention results in the lowest values.<br>
This expresses a greater processibility of the mixes prepared from the silica according to the invention, in particular in respect of the extrusion and calendering operations which are often carried out during the manufacture of elastomer compositions (lower energy expenditure for processing the mix, greater ease of injection during the compounding, less die swell during extrusion, less shrinkage on calendering, ...).<br>
2- Mechanical properties<br>
The measurements are carried out on vulcanized formultaions.<br><br>
The vulcanization is carried out by heating the formulations to 150C for 40 minutes.<br><br><br>
These last results demonstrate the good reinforcing effect confenred by the silica according to the invention.<br>
Thus, while resulting in more satisfactory rheological properties, the silica according to the invention provides mechanical properties which are better than those obtained with the silica of the prior art.<br>
On the one hand, the silica according to the invention produces a 300 % muduius / 100 % !noduiu3 ratio that IG greater than the ratio obtained with the silica of the prior art, which is a proof of better dispersion of the silica within the rubber matrix.<br>
On the other hand, the high reinforcing power of the silica according<br>
to the invention is confirmed by the high value obtained for the tensile strength.<br><br>
At last, with regard to the abrasion resistance, it can be seen that the loss by abrasion is substantially reduced (about 20 %) in relation to the comparative silica.<br>
3- Dynamic properties<br>
The measurements are carried out on vulcanized formulations.<br>
The vulcanization is obtained by heating the formulations to 150°C for 40 minutes. The results (illustrating the tendency to heat up) are reported in Table IV below (the lower the value, the lower the tendency to heat up). The apparatus employed for conducting the measurements has been shown.<br><br><br><br>
