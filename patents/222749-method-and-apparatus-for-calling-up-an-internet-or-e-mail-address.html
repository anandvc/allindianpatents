				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on a method for finding an internet<br>
or E-mail address.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Internet or E-mail addresses are noted in the content of<br>
many Teletext pages regardless of whether they contain<br>
advertising or information. The addresses are currently<br>
transmitted within the visable area of a Teletext page so that<br>
the user must normally copy them and enter them into an Internet<br>
browser.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention is based on the object of creating a<br>
simplified method for finding an Internet or E-mail address. This<br>
object including further advantageous developments is achieved<br>
by the features of the invention.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The method according to the invention for finding an<br>
Internet or E mail address which is reproduced in a teletext<br>
system, comprising visible areas and non-visible areas of the<br>
teletext system, a selection unit, a control unit and a link<br>
unit, is distinguished by the fact that the address in the<br>
visible area is selected by the selection unit, the control unit<br>
recognizes the selected address, the control unit accepts and/or<br>
modifies the address format and the address is selected via the<br>
link unit.<br>
The method according to the invention provides the user with<br>
the advantage that he does not need to copy the Internet address<br>
which he sees in the teletext. This provides him with faster<br>
access.<br>
Furthermore, the method can be characterized in that the<br>
control unit recognizes the address by means of obvious address<br>
information.<br>
If the user is not able to select the address required by<br>
him with the aid of a cursor or another unit for highlighting the<br>
address, it is possible for the system itself to emphasize an<br>
Internet address. This means that the Internet address in the<br>
teletext is rendered visible for the user and he can let this<br>
address be selected by means of an acknowledgement key on a<br>
remote control unit. Obvious address information is, for example,<br>
Internet address strings such as "http2//", "www." or subsequent<br>
strings such as, for example, "com" or " de" or strings which are<br>
preferably separated only by dots (without spaces). The<br>
control unit can use this information to perform highlighting.<br>
For example if the highlighting were to begin at "www" and end<br>
at "com", the control unit could then translate the address thus<br>
found and use it for selection. Or if the highlighting begins at<br>
"www", the end can be determined in accordance with the<br>
extraction algorithm described below. The control unit can then<br>
translate the address thus found and use it for selection.<br>
Furthermore, the method can be distinguished by the fact<br>
that the address is displayed in the visible area and the non-<br>
visible area contains address information which is used by the<br>
control unit for calling up the address.<br>
If the translation of the Internet address is to be omitted<br>
it is possible to store the address information in the non-<br>
visible area so that it could be found there. This means that<br>
there is a link between the visible teletext information and the<br>
non-visible Internet address which is then used by the control<br>
unit for selection.<br><br>
It is also possible for a user to highlight the address<br>
by means of a highlighting unit and this address is to fox<br>
transferred to the control unit.<br>
The highlighting unit has the advantage that the user<br>
himself can highlight the part of the address relevant to him.<br>
For example, in the case of a long Internet address where<br>
however, only the home page is of interest to the user only the<br>
first part of the address needs to be highlighted which as a<br>
rule, applies to the home page. In this manner the user will not<br>
have to reach the home page via the detour of a subpage.<br>
Furthermore, the method can be distinguished by the fact<br>
that the control unit contains a memory and/or that there is a<br>
link to a memory for storing addresses and/or retrieving<br>
addresses.<br>
If the control unit contains a memory and/or accesses a<br>
memory this would have the advantage that as soon as the<br>
control unit recognizes an address in the teletext page it can<br>
store it in the memory. The memory can also be used for checking<br>
whether the address selected by the control unit is correct. If<br>
for example an Internet address is not specified completely it<br>
is possible to find it completely by means of a comparison with<br><br>
the addressin a memory. This memory can be filled with many<br>
Internet addresses right from the start in order thus to provide<br>
the prerequisite that the correct Internet address will be found.<br>
Using the control unit the user can also perform a search<br>
algorithm so that he can find in this manner the address which he<br>
does not reliably know.<br>
A circuit for finding an Internet or E-mail address which is<br>
reproduced in a teletext system comprising a selection unit a<br>
control unit and a link unit is distinguished by the fact that<br>
the selection unit recognizes the address and the link unit sets<br>
up the link as soon as the control unit requests it to do so.<br>
Further, the circuit can contain a selection unit and a link<br>
unit in the control unit.<br>
Furthermore, the circuit can be distinguished by the fact<br>
that the control unit contains a memory and/or that there is a<br>
link to a memory.<br>
In the text which follows, possibilities will again be<br>
explained by means of which Internet or E—mail addresses can be<br>
found.<br>
The Internet or E-mail addresses(s) will be called<br>
addresses in the text which follows. The teletext page (s) is<br>
(are) called page (a) in the text which follows. They are designated<br>
by magazine numbers and a decimal page number. The corresponding<br>
line in the magazine is identified by a numerical value, e.g. x/5<br>
is line 5 in a magazine x. teletext pages with a hexadecimal page<br>
number are called "ghost-page".<br>
Page-related addresses<br>
The page—related addresses must establish their reference to<br>
the page by at least one reference also being transmitted in one<br>
of the data packets belonging to this page.<br>
Visible area! x/1 - x/23<br>
The addresses which are transmitted in the visible area of<br>
the page do not have an identification which identify them as<br>
addresses. Such a page is then searched for address-specific<br>
identifiers. The names of the addresses are subject to the<br>
familar restrictions of the character set according to the<br>
teletext specification (European Broadcasting Unions Interim<br>
Technical Document SPB 492). Thus the characters 6 ("at") and ~<br>
(tilde) are not available in every national character set.<br>
Although it would be possible to generate them by x/26, they<br>
are, as a rule, replaced, namely a by (at) and v by (*). The<br>
data themselves are sensitive to interference along the<br>
transmission path since they are only protected by one parity bit<br>
per 7 data bits.<br>
Non-visible area: x/27 to x/31<br>
As a rule, such additional data are protected by hamming<br>
coding. The character codes which contain colour attributes and<br>
others in the visible area can be used for completing the<br>
character set. The following forms are conceivable for optimizing<br>
the transmissioni<br>
- direct entry of the addresses, if necessary with<br>
row/column address for display within the visible areas<br>
- reference to an address table which is transmitted in a<br>
separate "ghost page" (see under "sender-related addresses"). If<br>
a navigation medium (mouse, pointing device, tab stop) points to<br>
such an entry or reference, the complete address can be displayed<br>
in a superimposed window (free or docked, or cart be visually<br>
emphasized if it is already, displayed on the screen (as in the<br>
case of "page-related addresses").<br>
x/27<br>
The functions having designation codes 0-7 art used for<br>
transmitting links to other teletext pages. The functions can also<br>
be used in this sense for looking for the corresponding address.<br>
x/28<br>
The functions having designation codes 0-4 are used. The<br>
functions having designation codes 5-15 can be freely specified<br>
for pointing to an address or to contain one.<br>
x/30<br>
The functions having designation codes 0-3 are used in<br>
magazine 3.<br>
x/31<br>
The packets are used for data services in magazine 1—3 and<br>
8.<br>
Sender-related addresses<br>
Addresses which can be called up from each end must be<br>
translated and stored in page-independent tables. Such tables are<br>
usually transmitted with hexadecimal page numbers and are thus<br>
not directly selectable by the user.<br>
x/28<br>
The x/28 data to be defined can also contain references to<br>
"ghost pages". These can be handled like data pages of teletext<br>
presentation level 2.5 (described in ETC (European<br>
Telecommunication Standard) 3OO 7O6 issued by the European<br>
Telecommunications Standards Institute, F-06921) Sophia<br>
Antipolis).<br>
Application<br>
An application in the sense of ETS 300 708 is a non-teletext<br>
service which is transmitted in accordance with the transmission<br>
specification of teletext. Such a one can also contain addresses<br>
in a form which enables or necessitates the addresses to be<br>
administered independently of the teletext.<br>
Separate Application<br>
The access to the internet can be defined as a separate<br>
application. This requires that the addresses are administered<br>
independently of the teletext.<br>
Existing Application<br>
Within an electronic program guide (EPB), addressed can be<br>
named as pure text characters in the short or long information<br>
relating to the individual PIs (Program Information) (compare<br>
"visible area"; it differs from a teletext in the generation of the<br>
special characters! by x/26 in teletext and by ESC sequences in<br>
EPG).<br>
Exraction algorithm<br>
The transmitted addresses, as described above in the section<br>
"visible area", need a special extraction aglorithm. This is<br>
capable of recognizing addresses, if necessary over line breaks.<br>
In this connection attention must be paid to various conditions.<br>
It it is assumed that texts which are written over a number<br>
of lines are continued in the first possible column of the next<br>
line following, the column number in the continuation line is<br>
smaller than or equal to the starting column.<br>
If it is assumed that texts are written in various colour<br>
combinations (foreground - background), it must be assumed that a<br>
start item is continued in the same colour combination. Thus<br>
all areas with different colours and all mosaic graphics areas<br>
must be ignored (mosaic colour atext colour).<br>
Address generation<br>
Apart from the method of extracting complete Internet<br>
addresses from the received data, it would also be possible to<br>
generate Internet addresses by oneself from fractions. For this<br>
purpose, the user can select a part of the displayed text by<br>
mouse or pointing device.<br>
If the selected text is free of characters which cannot<br>
occur in an Internet address such as for example a space an<br>
attempt is made to find a valid Internet address in the<br>
following manner:<br>
a) by prefixing a string which determines the type of<br>
Internet address such as e.g. "www." "ftp." or "gopher".<br>
b&gt; by appending a string which represents the so-called<br>
domain name such as e.g. ".com", ".edu", "gov" or of one of<br>
dynamic probability of use and/or stored for the user in<br>
accordance with geographic location such as e.g. "de", "fr",<br>
"it".<br>
c) by arbitrary combinations of the two above-mentioned<br>
measures.<br>
d) by progressive shortening of the text by the last "/"<br>
in each case and the subsequent text.<br>
In each case the control unit transfers an Internet address<br>
thus generated to the Internet browser. If an address is<br>
recognized as valid i.e. the browser is capable of reaching the<br>
Internet address without errors the current address is entered<br>
into a list of valid Internet addresses. In this time the<br>
browser can for example display the content of the address first<br>
recognized as valid. If more than one Internet address is<br>
recognized as valid the user is presented with a list containing<br>
these addresses for selection. If only one valid address is<br>
found the browser requests the content of this address. If no<br>
valid address is found for the selected text or if the text<br>
contains characters which cannot occur in an Internet address<br>
this text is transferred to the browser with the command to<br>
search the Internet for the text or for logically combined parts<br>
of the text by means of the search engine set as a standard.<br>
Thus for example Internet pages cam be searched for which<br>
contain each or at least one of the words of a selected text.<br>
Navigation<br>
Navigation is made possible as follows:<br>
Addresses or address components which can be read explicitly<br>
in the text (see "address generation") appear visually emphasized<br>
(e.g. by underlining). If a navigation medium (e.g. mouse visual<br>
pointing device or cursor, if nececessary fay tab stop) coo<br>
within the capture range of an address the address is marked as<br>
logically combinable. This marking can be don by changing the<br>
cursor or by inserting the address (superimposition in a pop-up<br>
window or in a special status line). On confirmation by means of<br>
an OK button, the selected address is provided to a browser for<br>
selection or respectively for disposal.<br>
Similarly it is possible to insert all information<br>
contained on the page (visible as fragment or in the non-visible<br>
area) in a pop-up menu within which it is possible to navigate by<br>
means of cursor keys or mouse (pointing device).<br>
"Ok" - see above.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
In the text which follow the invention will be explained<br>
with a number of illustrative embodiments referring, to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the method according to<br>
the invention<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow diagram of the method according to<br>
the invention.<br>
DETAlL DESCRIPTION UP A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
Figure 1 shows a block diagram of the method according to<br>
the invention. The tuner l receives the satellite, cable or<br>
terrestrial signal IN which is then forwarded to the data decoder<br>
DD and to the colour demodulator FD. The data then pass via a<br>
line or via a bus system to the memory MEM which contains data<br>
and programs. Furthermore the data pass to the procesor PR. The<br>
processor forwards the data obtained to the picture tube B via<br>
the graphics card GK. The picture tube could be constructed as<br>
television set or as monitor. The processor PH also performs a<br>
data exchange with the modem MD and the modem is connected to an<br>
analog or digital telephone network TEL. The process contains the<br>
selection unit and the control unit. the link unit is<br>
implemented by the modem MD.<br>
If a string which is an Internet address is then displayed on<br>
the picture tube B, the user can highlight this by means of the<br>
remote control unit FB. The remote control unit FB is connected to<br>
the other units by wires and/or wirelessly.The address thus formed is<br>
converted by the process in such a form that the search can begin<br>
via the modem, that is to say, the program which is stored in a<br>
memory MEM is called up by the processor in the background, the<br>
data of the internet address are conveyed to this program and the<br>
program activates a modem for the search. The program is<br>
preferably a program which is also used for normal Internet use. It<br>
is also possible tor the search routine then running to be displayed<br>
to the user on the picture tube B. That is to say the user sees<br>
that the address selected by him in the teletext is transferred<br>
to the program and the search mechanism is started. As soon as<br>
the address is round, the content of the page is displayed to the<br>
user. The displaying is preferably also performed in the form in<br>
which the programs for internet or E mails are constructed. If<br>
the user has seen enough information, he can navigate further in<br>
the internet, simply change to teletext or also wholly to the<br>
television programme by means of the remote control unit. this<br>
makes it possible for the user to select in a simple manner an<br>
Internet or E-mail address discovered in a teletext and the<br>
result to be provided to him directly.<br>
if the user does not highlight the address, the system<br>
independently looks tor address information in the teletext page,<br>
highlights this address information and the user can let the address<br>
be searched for by means of the remote control unit. The address<br>
search and the selection is performed in the same manner as in<br>
the case of the highlighted address.<br>
Figure 2 shows a flow diagram of the method According to the<br>
invention. If the user does not highlight the address by means<br>
of the remote control unit the processor PR starts a program for<br>
finding addresses. Firstly the program looks for significant<br>
address components. These would be, for examplef "https//",<br>
"www.", "com", "de" and others. As soon as an address meeting<br>
the start or end condition is found it is stored. After that a<br>
check is made whether the address ends before column 30 or an<br>
invalid character is detected. If this is the case the search is<br>
ended and if not the search is continued in the subroutine<br>
'continue searching'. The 'continue searching" subroutine compares<br>
whether the colour combination is the same as in the case of the<br>
start address. If this is the case the contents of the column<br>
are allocated to the address and if not the next colour<br>
combination is looked for and a check is made whether the column<br>
number is greater than in the case of the start address. If the<br>
column number is greater than the start address the search is<br>
ended since the address will be continued in this column at the<br>
latest. If the column is not greater the subroutine is run<br><br>
again. In this manner the address is found since the address<br>
has the same colour continuously as a rule. That is to say if<br>
the address begins in one column the colour is used for checking<br>
whether the address ends in the column or whether it is continued<br>
in the next higher or lower column. This depends on the following<br>
criteria it is continued in the next lower column (i.e. higher<br>
column number) if the start characters of the adress are found<br>
and it is continued in the next higher column (i.e. lower column<br>
number) if the end—of—address condition is found.<br>
If both address conditions are found i.e. start and end<br>
condition the address can be determined by taking the start<br>
condition end condition and the information in between and/or it<br>
is possible to recognize the entire address by means of the<br>
colour information.<br>
