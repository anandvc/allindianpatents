				<td>This invention describes a process for the preparation of poly bis(naphthalimido) sulphides. The invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of polymers based on bis(naphthalimido)sulphide compounds. More particularly, it relates to a process for the preparation of poly bis(naphthalimido) sulphides having general formula given in the drawing accompanying this specification wherein<br>
R - -(CH2)n- and n = 2 to 12 or<br>
R = 1,4-phenylene, 1,3-phenylene, 4-methyl-l,3-phenylene, 4,4'-thio-diphenylene, 4,4'-methylenediphenylene, 4,4'-oxydiphenylene, 2,5-bis(phenyl) 3,4-diphenyl thiophene, 2,5-bis(phenyl) furan, 3,4 bis( phenyl) 2,5-furan, 3,4-bis(phenyl) 2,5-diphenyl pyrrole, 4,4'-(hexafluoro-isopropylidene) diphenylene, 4,4'-(9-fluorenylidene)-diphenylene, 4,4'-diphenylene sulfone, 1,5'-naphamalene, 2,6'-napthlene, l,4'-cyclohexane, 4,4'-benzophenone, 3,3'-benzophenone, 2,6'-pyridine, 4,4'-(isopropylidene) diphenylene, 4,4'-biphenyl, 4,4'-bis(phenyl ether), 3,3'-bis(phenyl ether), 1,3,3-trimethyl cyclohexane methyl group.<br>
Poly bis(naphthaleneimido) sulphide compounds prepared by the process of the present invention can be used to prepare high performance engineering polymers with good chemical and thermal stability. The synthesis of polymers with various specific properties such as high glass transition temperature, improved processability, and long term thermal stability is still major driving force for development of new monomers and polymers therefrom. Bis(naphthalimido) based polymers will have high chemical and thermal stability, and high solubility as compared to those prepared with<br><br>
bis(phthalimido) polymers. In our copending application no. 3323/D/98 we have described and claimed a process for the preparation of bis(4-halo-l,8-napthalimido)alkylenes.<br>
The polymers prepared by the process of the present invention are obtained by nucleophilic halo displacement polymerisation reaction. One example would be polythioarylene copolymers, poly(4-thiophenylene) being an important member in the family of polythioarylenes.<br>
In the conventional synthetic route to the synthesis of polythioarylenes, the polymer precipitates out of the system as soon as a critical molecular weight is achieved leading to a restriction in the molecular weight. If the compounds prepared by the process of the present invention are used as monomers, since the polymer is soluble, precipitation during the course of the polymerization docs not occur and high molecular weight polymers can be obtained.<br>
Another advantage is the presence of imide ring, which would help, in easy displacement of halo group to result in high molecular weight polythioarylene copolymer. The rigid naphthalene ring would lead to polymers with good thermal and mechanical stability. The methyl substitution, ether linkage, highly phcnylated diamincs in place aromatic diamincs helps in enhanced solubility.<br><br>
The compounds prepared by the process of this invention namely poly bis( napthalimido) sulphides are reportedly synthesized first time by the inventors of the present invention and hence there are no earlier methods known fro the preparation of these compounds.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore to provide a process for the preparation of poly bis (naphthalimido) sulphides, which are soluble in common organic solvents.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of poly bis(naphthalimido) sulphides of formula 1 wherein R = -(CH2)n- and n = 2 to 12 or R= 1 ,4-phenylene, 1,3-phenylene, 4-methyl-l-3-phenylene, 4,4'-thio-diphenylene, 4,4'-methylenediphenylene, 4,4'-oxydiphenylene, 2,5-bis(phenyl) 3,4-diphenyl) thiophene, 2,5-bis(phenyl) furan, 3,4 bis(phenyl) 2,5-furan, 3,4-bis(phenyl) 2,5-diphenyl pyrrole, 4,4'-(hexafluoro-isopropylidene) diphenylene, 4,4'-(9-fluorenylidene)-diphenylene, 4,4 '-diphenylene sulfone, l,5'-naphathalene, 2,6'-napthlene, l,4'-cyclohexane, 4,4'-benzophenone, 3,3'-benzophenone, 2,6'-pyridine, 4,4'-(isopropylidene) diphenylene, 4,4'-biphenyl, 4,4'-bis(phenyl ether), 3,3'-<br>
bis(phenyl  ether),   1,3,3-trimethyl  cyclohexane  methyl  group  which  comprises,<br>
