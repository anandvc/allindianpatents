6-Substituted Pyrido-Pvrimidines<br>
The present invention relates to pyridopyrimidines and derivatives thereof. In particular, the present invention provides 2,6-disubstituted 7-oxo-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines, a process for their manufacture, pharmaceutical preparations comprising the same, and methods for using the same.<br>
Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP) is a family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that activate their substrates by dual phosphorylation. The kinases are activated by a variety of signals including nutritional and osmotic stress, UV light, growth factors, endotoxin and inflammatory cytokines. One group of MAP kinases is the p38 kinase group that includes various isoforms {e.g., p38a, p39p, p38y and p385). The p38 kinases are responsible for phosphorylating and activating transcription factors as well as other kinases, and are activated by physical and chemical stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines and bacterial lipopolysaccharide.<br>
More importantly, the products of the p38 phosphorylation have been shown to mediate the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF and IL-1, and cyclooxygenase-2. Each of these cytokines has been implicated in numerous disease states and conditions. For example, TNF-a is a cytokine produced primarily by activated monocytes and macrophages. Its excessive or unregulated production has been implicated as playing a causative role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. More recently, inhibition of TNF production has been shown to have broad application in the treatment of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis and asthma.<br><br>
TNF has also been implicated in viral infections, such as HIV, influenza virus, and herpes virus including herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2), cytomegalovirus (CMV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus, human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7), human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), pseudorabies and rhinotracheitis, among others.<br>
Similarly, EL-1 is produced by activated monocytes and macrophages, and plays a role in many pathophysiological responses including rheumatoid arthritis, fever and reduction of bone resorption.<br>
Additionally, the involvement of p38 has been implicated in stroke, Alzheimer's disease, osteoarthritis, lung injury, septic shock, angiogenesis, dermatitis, psoriasis and atopic dermatitis (see e.g. J. Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents, (2000) 10(1)).<br>
The inhibition of these cytokines by inhibition of the p38 kinase is of benefit in controlling, reducing and alleviating many of these disease states.<br>
Certain 6-aryl-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones, -7-imines and-7-thiones are disclosed as inhibitors of protein tyrosine kinase mediated cellular proliferation in WO 96/34867. Other 6-aryl-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines and naphthyridines are also disclosed as inhibitors of tyrosine kinase in WO 96/15128. 6-alkyl-pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidin-7-ones are disclosed as inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases in WO 98/33798. Certain 4-amino-pyridopyrimidines are disclosed as inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase in EP 0 278 686A1.<br>

Compounds of Formula I" and E" where W is O can be prepared by hydrolyzing precursor sulfones such as If, 2e, Dig shown in the following Schemes 1-4 in refluxing aqueous acetic acid or aqueous hydroxide to provide a hydroxyl compound (i.e., compounds F and II", wherein R10W is hydroxy). The resulting hydroxyl compound can be alkylated with R10-L where L is a leaving group to provide compounds of Formula F and II", where W is O and R10 is as described. Alternatively, the sulfone group in the precursor sulfone may be directly displaced with an alcohol R10-OH as described in WO 96/33798 to provide compounds of Formula I and II where W is O and R10 is as described. Compounds of Formula F and II" where R10W form a leaving group such as halo may be prepared by treating the precursor compound where R10W is hydroxy<br><br>
with a halogenating agent such as phosphorous oxychloride or phosphorous oxybromide. Compounds of Formula I' and IT' where R10W foim a leaving group such as acetoxy, tosyloxy etc. may be prepared by treating the precursor compound where R       is hydroxy with an acylating or sulfonylating agent respectively.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by a variety of methods. In one aspect of the present invention, a method for preparing compounds of Formula I where Z is N is shown in Scheme 1 below. It should be appreciated that although the scheme often indicates exact structures, methods of the present invention apply widely to analogous compounds of Formula I or II, given appropriate consideration to protection and deprotection of reactive functional groups by methods standard to the art of organic chemistry. For example, hydroxy groups, in order to prevent unwanted side reactions, sometimes need to be converted to ethers or esters during chemical reactions at other sites in the molecule. The hydroxy protecting group is then removed to provide the free hydroxy group. Similarly, amino groups and carboxylic acid groups can be derivatized to protect them against unwanted side reactions. Typical protecting groups, and methods for attaching and cleaving them, are described fully in the above incorporated references by T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3rd edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1999, and Harrison and Harrison et al., Compendium of Synthetic Organic Methods, Vols. 1-8 (John Wiley and Sons, 1971-1996).<br><br><br>
Treatment of a compound of Formula la with a primary amine (R3-NH2&gt; provides a compound of Formula lb. This reaction is conveniently carried out in a solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, preferably a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, especially dichloromethane, an optionally halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon, or an open-chain or cyclic ether such as tetrahydrofuran, a formamide or a lower alkanol. Suitably, the reaction is carrie out at about -20 °C to about 120 °C.<br>
Reduction of a compound of Formula lb provides an alcohol of Formula Ic. This reduction is typically carried out using lithium aluminum hydride in a manner well known to those of skill in the art (e.g., in a solvent which is inert under the conditions of the reduction, preferably an open-chain or cyclic ether, especially tetrahydrofuran, at about -20 °C to about 70 °C, preferab] at about 0 °C to about room temperature).<br><br>
Oxidation of an alcohol of Formula Ic provides a carboxaldehyde of Formula Id. The oxidation is typically carried out with manganese dioxide, although numerous other methods can also be employed (see, for example, ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 4TH ED., March, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992)). Depending on the oxidizing agent employed, the reaction is carried out conveniently in a solvent which is inert under the specific oxidation conditions, preferably a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, especially dichloromethane, or an optionally halogenated aromatic hydrocarbon. Suitably, the oxidation is earned out at about 0 °C to about 60 °C<br>
Reaction of a carboxaldehyde of Formula Id with an ester, Ar1-X^Hr-COaR'(where R' is an alkyl group, and Ar1 and X are those defined above) in the presence of a base provides a compound of Formula Ie. Any relatively non-nucleophilic base can be used including carbonates, such as potassium carbonate, lithium carbonate, and sodium carbonate; bicarbonates, such as potassium bicarbonate, lithium bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate; amines, such as secondary and tertiary amines; and resin bound amines such as l,3,4,6,7,8-hexahydro-2H pyrimido[l,2-a]pyrimidine. Conveniently, the reaction is carried out in a solvent which is relatively polar but inert under the reaction conditions, preferably an amide such as dimethyl formamide, N-substituted pyrrolidinone, especially 1 -methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, and at a temperature of about 25 °C to about 150 °C.<br>
Oxidation of Ie with an oxidizing agent, e.g. a peracid such as 3-chloroperbenzoic acid (i.e., MCPBA) or Oxone®, provides a sulfone (If) which can be converted to a variety of target compounds. Typically the oxidation of Ie is carried out in a solvent which is inert under the conditions of the oxidation. For example, when MCPBA is used as the oxidizing agent, the solvent is preferably a halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbon, especially chloroform. When Oxone® is used as the oxidizing agent, the solvent is preferably methanol, aqueous ethanol or aqueous tetrahydrofuran. The reaction temperature depends<br><br>
on the solvent used. For an organic solvent, the reaction temperature is generally at about -20 °C to about 50 °C, preferably about 0 °C to about room temperature. When water is used as the solvent, the reaction temperature is generally from about 0 °C to about 50 °C, preferably about 0 °C to about room temperature. Alternatively, the oxidation may be carried under catalytic conditions with rhenium/peroxide based reagents, see ("Oxidation of Sulfoxides by Hydrogen Peroxide, Catalyzed by MethyltrioxorheniumCVn)", Lahti, David W.; Espenson, James H, Inorg. Chem. (2000) 39(10) pp.2164-2167; "Rhenium oxo complexes in catalytic oxidations, Catal. Today (2000)55(4), pp317-363 and "A Simple and Efficient Method for the Preparation of Pyridine N-Oxides", Coperet, Christophe; Adolfsson, Hans; Khuong, Tinh-Alfredo V.; Yudin, Andrei K.; Sharpless, K. Barry, J. Org. Chem. (1998) 63(5), ppl740-1741).<br>
Reacting the compound If with an amine (R1-NH2) provides the compounds of Formula I' (i.e., compounds I, wherein W is NH). Further alkylation of F then provides compounds of Formula I, where W is NR , where R2 is alkyl. The reaction can be carried out in the presence or absence of solvent. Conveniently, the reaction is carried out at temperatures of from about 0 °C to about 200 °C, more preferably about room temperature to about 150 °C. Alternatively, in some cases rather than using the sulfone If, the sulfide le or the corresponding sulfoxide can be reacted directly with an amine (R1-NH2) to provide the compounds of Formula IAccordingly, the present invention provides a method of preparing compounds of Formula I, by treating a compound of general Formula le, If or the corresponding sulfoxide with an amine (R!-NH2) and optionally reacting the resulting product with R"-L, where R" is is alkyl and L is a leaving group.<br>
Compounds of Formula I where RJ is amino, monoalkylamino, dialkylamino or NR32-Y3-R33 may be prepared as shown in Scheme 2 from the corresponding 2-alkylthio-8-amino-[2,3-d]pyridopyrimidin-7(8H)-one (IV, Z=N)<br><br><br><br>
Displacement of the sulfide (or the corresponding sulfoxide or sulfone with an amine RJNH2 as previously described for compound le in Scheme 1 provides compounds of Formula I (compounds of Formula I where Z is CH and R2 is H). Reacting the resulting product with R2-L, where R2 is is alkyl and L is a leaving group gives compounds of Formula I where R is alkyl.<br>
Compounds of Formula I where Z is CH may be prepared as shown in Scheme 3.<br><br><br><br>
Synthesis, 87092 (1994). JThe methylthiopyridine is coupled in a Heck reaction under palladium catalysis (e.g. palladium acetate) in the presence of base (e.g. potassium acetate or tributylamine) with the vinyl ester 2a to give a compound of Formula 2b (see Dong, Y.; Busacca, C.A. J. Org. Chem.. 62,6464-65 (1997). Ring closure under basic conditions gives a 1,6-naphthyridone of Formula 2c. Alkylation of 2c with an alkyl halide (or any other alkylating agent R3-X where X is a leaving group) gives a 1-alkylated naphthyridone of Formula 2d. Oxidation of 2d and displacement of the sulfone with an amine R1NH2 as previously described for compound Ie in Scheme 1 provides compounds of Formula I" (compounds of Formula I where Z is CH and R is H). Reacting the resulting product with R2-L, where R2 is alkyl and L is a leaving group gives compounds of Formula I where R2 is alkyl.An alternative route is shown in Scheme 3A.<br><br><br><br>
Reaction of a carboxaldehyde of Formula Id (R3 is H) with a nitrile, A^-X^Hr-CN (where Ar1 and X1 are those defined above) in the presence of a base under condtions similar to those described for conversion of Id to Ie in Scheme 1 provides a compound of Formula nie. Compounds of Formula Hie may be sequentially alkylated, acylated or sulfonylated with alkylating agents, acyl halides, isocyanates, anhydrides and sulfonyl halides to provide compounds of Formula mf where R8 and R9 are as described in the Summary of the Invention. Subsequent oxidation of mf and displacement of the sulfone with<br><br>
an amine R NH2 as previously described for compound Ie in Scheme 1 provides compounds of Formula AT. Further reacting the resulting product with R2~L, where R2 is is alkyl and L is a leaving group gives compounds of Formula II where R2 is alkyl.<br>
One of skill in the art will understand that certain modifications to the above schemes are contemplated and within the scope of the present invention. For example, certain steps will involve the use of protecting groups for functional groups that are not compatible with particular reaction conditions.<br>
The compounds of Formula I and II and the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of basic compounds of Formula I and II with acids can be used as medicaments, e.g., in the form of pharmaceutical preparations. The pharmaceutical preparations can be administered enterally, e.g., orally in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, nasally, e.g., in the form of nasal sprays, or rectally, e.g., in the form of suppositories. However, they may also be administered parenterally, e.g., in the form of injection solutions.<br>
The compounds of Formula I and II and their aforementioned pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be processed with pharmaceutically inert, organic or inorganic carriers for the production of pharmaceutical preparations. Lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts and the like can be used, for example, as such carriers for tablets, coated tablets, dragees and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats, semi-solid and liquid polyols and the like; depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, usually required in the case of soft gelatine capsules. Suitable carriers for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar,<br><br>
glucose and the like. Suitable carriers for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats, semi-liquid or liquid polyols and the like.<br>

The dosage can vary within wide limits and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. In general, in the case of administration to adults a convenient daily dosage should be about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg, preferably about 0.5 mg/kg to about 5 mg/kg. The daily dosage may be administered as a single dose or in divided doses and, in addition, the upper dosage limit refened to earlier may be exceeded when this is found to be indicated.<br><br>
Finally, the use of compounds of Formula I and II and their aforementioned pharmaceutical^ acceptable salts for the production of medicaments, especially in the treatment or prophylaxis of inflammatory, immunological, oncological, bronchopulmonary, dermatological and cardiovascular disorders, in the treatment of asthma, central nervous system disorders or diabetic complications or for the prevention of graft rejection following transplant surgery, is also an object of the invention.<br>

The compounds can further be used for preventing the production of cyclooxygenase-2.<br>
Besides being useful for human treatment, these compounds are also useful for veterinary treatment of companion animals, exotic animals and farm animals, including mammals, rodents, and the like. More preferred animals include horses, dogs, and cats.<br><br>
The present compounds can also be used in co-therapies, partially or completely, in place of other conventional antiinflammatories, such as together with steroids, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, NSAIDs, DMARDS, immunosuppressive agents, 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, LTB4 antagonists and LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors.<br>
As used herein, the term "TNF mediated disorder" refers to any and all disorders and disease states in which TNF plays a role, either by control of TNF itself, or by TNF causing another monokine to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, EL-6 or EL-8. A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to TNF, would therefore be considered a disorder mediated by TNF.<br>
As used herein, the term "p38 mediated disorder" refers to any and all disorders and disease states in which p38 plays a role, either by control of p38 itself, or by p38 causing another factor to be released, such as but not limited to IL-1, IL-6 or IL-8. A disease state in which, for instance, IL-1 is a major component, and whose production or action, is exacerbated or secreted in response to p38, would therefore be considered a disorder mediated by p38.<br>
As TNF-P has close structural homology with TNF-a (also known as cachectin), and since each induces similar biologic responses and binds to the same cellular receptor, the synthesis of both TNF-a and TNF-fJ are inhibited by the compounds of the present invention and thus are herein referred to collectively as "TNF' unless specifically delineated otherwise.<br><br><br>

Polystyrene 96-well plates were coated with 50 |Ltl per well of antibody 2TNF-H12 in PBS (10 Mg/mL) and incubated in a humidified chamber<br>
at 4 °C overnight. The plates were washed with PBS and then blocked with 5% nonfat-dry milk in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature and washed with 0.1% BSA (bovine serum albumin) in PBS.<br>
TNF standards were prepared from a stock solution of human recombinant TNF-cc (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The concentration of the standards in the assay began at 10 ng/mL followed by 6 half log serial dilutions.<br>
Twenty five nL aliquots of the above culture supernatants or TNF standards or only medium (control) were mixed with 25 ^L aliquots of biotinylated monoclonal antibody 2TNF-H34 (2 Hg/mL in PBS containing 0.1% BSA) and then added to each well. The samples were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature with gentle shaking and then washed 3 times with 0.1% BSA in PBS. 50 |il of peroxidase-streptavidin (Zymed, S. San Francisco, CA, USA) solution containing 0.416 jig/mL of peroxidase-streptavidin and 0.1% BSA in PBS was added to each well. The samples were incubated for an additional 1 hr at room temperature and then washed 4 times with 0.1% BSA in PBS. Fifty |iL of O-<br><br>
phenylenediamine solution (1 \ig/mL O-phenylene-diamine and 0.03 % hydrogen peroxide in 0.2M citrate buffer pH 4.5) was added to each well and the samples were incubated in the dark for 30 min., at room temperature. Optical density of the sample and the reference were read at 450 nm and 650 nm, respectively. TNF-a levels were determined from a graph relating the optical density at 450 nm to the concentration used.<br>
The IC50 value was defined as the concentration of the test<br>
compound corresponding to half-maximal reduction in 450 nm absorbance.<br>
Example 116<br>
This example illustrates an in vivo assay to evaluate the inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-a production in mice (or rats).<br>
The ability of the compounds of this invention to inhibit the TNF-a release, in vivo, was determined using a minor modification of the methods described in described in Zanetti, et. a/., J. Immunol, 148:1890 (1992) and Sekut, el. aU I Lab. Clin. Med., 124:813 (1994).<br>
Female BALB/c mice weighing 18-21 grams (Charles River, Hollister, CA, USA) were acclimated for one week. Groups containing 8 mice each were dosed orally either with the test compounds suspended or dissolved in an aqueous vehicle containing 0.9% sodium chloride, 0.5% sodium carboxymethyl-cellulose, 0.4% polysorbate 80,0.9% benzyl alcohol (CMC vehicle) or only vehicle (control group). After 30 min., the mice were injected intraperitoneally with 20 \ig of LPS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). After 1.5 h, the mice were sacrificed by CO2 inhalation and blood was harvested by<br>
cardiocentesis. Blood was clarified by centrifugation at 15,600 X g for 5 min., and sera were transferred to clean tubes and frozen at -20°C until analyzed for TNF-a by ELISA assay (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol.<br><br>
Representative compounds of the present invention are shown in Table 1 and Table 2 below. Compounds of Table 1 and 2 have IC50 activity against p38 kinase in the range of from about 0.1 to 5000 nM, with the majority being between 1 to 1000 nM and are surprisingly selective forp38 kinase relative to cyclin-dependent kinases and tyrosine kinase. IC50 data for specific compounds are provided in units, whereby a unit (micromolar) in the tables of "0.01" corresponds to 10 nM.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
