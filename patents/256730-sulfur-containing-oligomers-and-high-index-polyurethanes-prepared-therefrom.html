PREPARED THEREFROM<br>
[0001]     The present invention relates to sulfur-containing polyurethanes and methods for their preparation.<br>
[0002]     A number of organic polymeric materials,, such as' plastics, have been developed as alternatives and replacements for glass in applications such as optical lenses, fiber optics, windows and automotive, nautical and aviation transparencies.  These polymeric materials can provide advantages relative to glass, including, shatter resistance, lighter weight for a'given application, ease of molding and ease of dying.  However, the refractive indices of many polymeric materials are generally lower than that of glass.  In ophthalmic applications, the use of a polymeric material having a lower refractive index will require a thicker lens relative to a material having a higher refractive index.  A thicker lens is not desirable.<br>
[0003] Thus, there is a need in the art to develop a polymeric material having high refractive index and good Abbe Number, impact resistance/strength, and optical transparency.<br>
[0004]     For the purposes of this specification, unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term "about."  Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the following specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention.  At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques.<br>
[0005]     Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported<br>

[007 8]    Not intending to be bound by any particular theory, it is believed that as the mixture of polythiol, dienes and radical intiator is heated, the double bonds are at least partially consumed by reaction with the SH groups of the polythiol.  The mixture can be heated for a sufficient period of time such that the double bonds are essentially consumed and a pre-calculated theoretical value for SH content is reached.  In a non-limiting embodiment, the mixture can be heated for a time period of from 1 hour to 5 days.  In another non-limiting embodiment, the mixture can be heated at a temperature of from 40°C to 1Q0°C.<br>
[0079]     The number average molecular weight (Mn) of the resulting polythiol oligomer can vary widely.  The number average molecular<br>
weight (Mn) of polythiol oligomer can be predicted based on the stoichiometry of the reaction.  In alternate non-limiting embodiments, the M„ of polythiol oligomer can vary from 400 to 10,000 g/mole, or from 1000 to 3000 g/mole.<br>

[00 84]     As is known in the art, the nature of the SH group of polythiols is such that oxidative coupling can occur readily, leading to formation of disulfide linkages.  Various oxidizing agents can lead to such oxidative coupling.  As is also known in the art, the oxygen in the air can in some cases lead to such oxidative coupling during storage of the polythiol.  As is known in the art, it is believed that a possible mechanism for the coupling of thiol groups involves the formation of thiyl radicals, followed by coupling of said thiyl radicals, to form disulfide linkage.  As is known in the art, it is also believed that formation of disulfide linkage can occur under conditions that can lead to the formation of<br>

Impact resistance can be measured using a variety of conventional methods known to one skilled in the art.  In a non-limiting embpdiment, the impact resistance is measured using the Impact Energy Test which consists<br>
of testing a flat sheet sample of polymerizate having a thickness of 3mm, and cut into a square piece approximately 4cm x 4cm.  Said flat sheet sample of polymerizate is supported on a flat O-ring which is attached to top of the pedestal of a steel holder, as defined below. Said O-ring is constructed of neoprene having a hardness of 40 +_  5 Shore A durometer, a minimum tensile strength of 8.3 MPa, and a minimum ultimate elongation of 400 percent, and has an inner diameter of 25 mm, an outer diameter of 31 mm, and a thickness of 2.3 mm.  Said steel holder consists of a steel base, with a mass of approximately 12 kg, and a steel pedestal affixed to said steel base.  The shape of said steel pedestal is approximated by the solid shape which would result from adjoining onto the top of a cylinder, having an outer diameter of 75 mm and a height of 10 mm, the frustum of a right circular cone, having a bottom diameter of 75 mm, a top diameter of 25 mm, and a height of 8 mm, wherein the center of said frustum coincides with the center of said cylinder. The bottom of said steel pedestal is affixed to said steel base, and the neoprene O-ring is affixed to the top of the steel pedestal, with the center of said O-ring coinciding with the center of the steel pedestal. The flat sheet sample of polymerizate is set on top of the O-ring with the center of said flat sheet sample coinciding with the center of said O-ring.  The Impact Energy Test is carried out by dropping steel balls of increasing weight from a distance of 50 inches (1.27 meters) onto the center of the flat sheet sample.  The sheet is determined to have passed the test if the sheet does not fracture. The sheet is determined to have failed the test when the sheet fractures.  As used herein, the term "fracture" refers to a crack through the entire thickness of the sheet into two or more separate pieces, or detachment of one or more pieces of material from the backside of the sheet (i.e., the side of the sheet opposite' the side of impact).  The impact strength of the sheet is reported as the impact energy that corresponds to the highest level (i.e., largest ball) at which the sheet passes the test, and it is calculated acording to the following formula:<br>
E=mgd [00170]    Wherein E represent impact energy in Joules (J), m represents mass of the ball in kilograms (kg), g represents<br>
acceleration due to gravity (i.e., 9.806S5 m/sec2) and? d represents the distance of the ball drop in meters (i.e., 1.27 m).  In an alternate non-limiting embodiment, using, the Impact Energy Test as described herein, the impact strength can be at least 1.0 Joule, or at least 2.0 Joules, or at least 4.95 Joules.<br>

In a non-limiting embodiment, the density is measured using a DensiTEGH instrument manufactured by Tech Pro, Incorporated-in accordance with ASTM D297.<br>

100175]    In another embodiment, the photochromic substance can be added to the sulfur-containing polyurethane prior to polymerizing and/or cast curing the material.  In this embodiment, the photochromic substance used can be chosen such that it is resistant to potentially adverse interactions with, for example, the isocyanate, isothiocyante groups present.  Such adverse interactions can result in deactivation of the photochromic substance, for example, by trapping them in either an open or closed form.
