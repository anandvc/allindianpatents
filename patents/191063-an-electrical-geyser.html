				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an electrical geyser. More specifically, the present invention relates to an electrical geyser which provides water at constant temperature as against the progressively decreasing temperature of water coming out of a geyser of the prior art while in use by the user.<br>
Geysers of the prior art having copper or steel body with steel sheethed coiled elements are basically boilers and not geysers which should provide hot water at progressively reducing temperature. Such geysers have an inlet for cold water and an outlet for hot water. As the user draws hot water from the outlet, the cold water from the inlet keeps filling in and taking its place. The end result of this is a constant fall of water temperature, giving the user a very uncomfortable feeling.<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of an electrical geyser.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an electrical geyser which obviates the disadvantages associated with the prior art.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose an electrical geyser which provides water at a uniform temperaxture.<br>
According to this invention there is provided an electrical geyser comprising moulded and insulated housing having an inlet adapted to be connected to a water source through a first valve characterized in that said inlet being extended into the upper part of said housing in the form of a cage, a ball valve being provided within said cage for opening or closing said inlet end of said cage, an outlet being provided at the base of said housing and connected through a second valve disposed at 90° out of phase with each other, said first and second valves are coupled to each other through a common handle and a third valve is provided to connect a top and/or a shower.<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig.l shows a front sectional view of the geyser, and; Fig.2 shows the water flow connection to the geyser of fig. 1<br>
Referring to the drawings, and with particular reference to fig. 1 the geyser S of the<br>
present invention comprises a housing J having an insulation J, on the inner side<br>
thereof. By way of example and without implying any limitation, housing J may be<br>
made of any suitable thermoplastic	<br><br>
material having a moulded in insulation J, which also functions as a reinforcement for said body. Water is introduced into housing J through a water inlet D, said inlet extending upwardly into housing J and terminating into a cage CG. A float valve B is disposed within cage CG and adapted to close the discharge end of inlet D when water within housing J reaches the predetermined level. A filter or fi1ter cartridge R may be provided at the di schar ge end of inlet D. Housing J has a hinged cover N, a vent A provided with said cover. Hinged cover N allows an opening of said cover for cleansing of said housing. Further, if required, a fragrance dispenser could be introduced through cover N.<br>
Geyser S has an outlet E for discharge of water, said outlet E being the main outlet and extending inwardly from the base plate P of said geyser. Main outlet E has a water reserve outlet F. A further drain valve 0 is provided with a drain outlet 01 for cleansing of geyser S with the additional provision of a visible mud-trap to facilitate cleansing frequency.<br>
Base plate? P supports a wiring cover I, heating elements H being mounted on said .cover. By way of example, elements H may be teflon coated heating elements. Elements H are connected to a power source through a thermostat C. Instead of elements H, a microwave heating system may tae employed for further energy conservation/effeciency. Geyser S is provided with a thermometer L.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig.2, which illustrates a, first valve VI provided in the pipe Ql connected to meet Dl. A second valve V2 is provided with pipe Q2 connected to main water outlet E. In accordance with this invention, valves VI and V2 are disposed at 90 degree out of phase, and comprise; quaxrter turn valves. Thus, when valve VI is in an open status valve V2 is in a closed status and viceversa.<br>
Several  distinct advantages arise by such  a construction of a water flow connection to geyser S. Thus,  when valve V:l. is in an open status valve  V2 is  closed  and  whereby a discharge  of  water  is prevented.   Water  is filled into  geyser  S  till<br>
inlet  D  is closed by ball valve B.   Thus,  water-within geyser S is heated, and once the temperature of  water  is attained  thermostat  C  disconnects heating  elements H from the power  source.when  a discharge of heated water is required, valve V2  is opened and valve VI is closed.  Thus, water  having a uniform temperature is discharged from outlet  E, as no fresh water is allowed to flow into geyser S. An ensuing advantage is of a saving of power.<br>
Valves  VI  &amp; V2 ax re coupled  to  each  other through  a  common operating  handle.   A  further valve V3 is provided for discharge of heated  water to  the shower, said valve V3 being also a  quarter turn valve.<br><br><br>
CLAIM:<br>
1.	An electrical geyser comprising moulded and insulated housing having<br>
an inlet adapted to be connected to a water source through a first valve<br>
characterized in that said inlet being extended into the upper part of said<br>
housing in the form of a cage, a ball valve being provided within said<br>
cage for opening or closing said inlet end of said cage, an outlet being<br>
provided at the base of said housing and connected through a second<br>
valve disposed at 90° out of phase with-said first valve said first and second<br>
valves are coupled to each other through a common handle and a third<br>
valve is provided to connect a top and/or a shower.<br>
2.	A geyser as claimed in claim 1 wherein a harmful gases/air outlet is<br>
provided at the upper end of said housing.<br>
3.	An electrical geyser substantially as herein described and illustrated in<br>
the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
