				<td>METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR A PERMANENT MAGNET<br>
MACHINE WITH AN ADDED AIR BARRIER<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE<br>
[0001] This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 60/991,310, filed November 30, 2007.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The present invention generally relates to magnetic devices<br>
such as electrical motors, and more particularly relates to interior<br>
permanent magnet machines.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0003] Interior permanent magnet (IPM) machines are favored for fuel<br>
cell and hybrid electric vehicle operations due to their desirable<br>
characteristics - i.e., good torque density, good overall efficiency, good<br>
constant power range, etc. The rotor field in a permanent magnet machine<br>
is obtained by virtue of its structure, unlike other machines such as<br>
induction, switched or synchronous reluctance machines, in which the<br>
field is generated by a stator current supplied by a source. As a result,<br>
permanent magnet machines exhibit superior efficiency as compared to<br>
other such machines.<br>
[0004] However, as with surface PM machines, an IPM machine is<br>
burdened by the fact that the permanent magnet field is present even when<br>
the machine is not powered, resulting in losses induced by the rotating<br>
permanent magnet field of the rotor. Furthermore, the permanent magnet<br>
field induces voltage ("back EMF") into the stator winding. For a strong<br>
permanent magnet machine, this back EMF can be quite significant.<br>
[0005] In an IPM machine, a second rotor barrier is sometimes added,<br>
and a small magnet (used to saturate the bridge above the rotor barrier) is<br><br>
optionally placed therein. This second layer of magnet or air pocket acts as<br>
a barrier to the permanent magnet field of the lower primary magnet layer,<br>
reducing the air-gap magnet flux, and also lowering the machine back<br>
EMF and losses induced by the permanent magnet field. For some<br>
machines, due to limited space, the second barrier can not easily be added.<br>
Furthermore, addition of the second barrier may weaken the rotor structure<br>
or may not cover the entire lower magnet, resulting in some portion of the<br>
lower barrier magnet directly exposed to the air-gap , in turn leading to<br>
higher losses and higher back EMF.<br>
[00061 Accordingly, it is desirable to provide IPM machines that<br>
reduce field-related losses while minimizing back EMF and air-gap<br>
magnetic flux. Other desirable features and characteristics of the present<br>
invention will become apparent from the subsequent detailed description<br>
and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the accompanying<br>
drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] A more complete understanding of the present invention may<br>
be derived by referring to the detailed description and claims when<br>
considered in conjunction with the following figures, wherein like<br>
reference numbers refer to similar elements throughout the figures.<br>
[0008] FIG. 1 depicts, in cross-section, various internal permanent<br>
magnet (IPM) machines;<br>
[0009] FIG. 2 depicts, in cross-section, an IPM machine in accordance<br>
with one embodiment; and<br>
[0010] FIGS. 3 and 4 are graphs showing example empirical results of<br>
an IPM machine in accordance with one embodiment.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0011] The following detailed description is merely illustrative in<br>
nature and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses<br>
of the invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any<br>
expressed or implied theory presented in the preceding technical field,<br>
background, brief summary or the following detailed description. The<br>
invention may be described herein in terms of functional and/or logical<br>
block components and various processing steps. It should be appreciated<br>
that such block components may be realized by any number of hardware,<br>
software, and/or firmware components configured to perform the specified<br>
functions. For the purposes of conciseness, conventional techniques and<br>
systems related to electrical motors, magnetism, and the like are not<br>
described in detail herein.<br>
[0012] In general, the various embodiments are directed to a<br>
permanent magnet machine ("PM machine"), and more specifically an<br>
internal permanent magnet machine ("IPM machine") that includes a rotor<br>
with an additional air barrier above the first magnet barrier in the same<br>
rotor slot. As a result, no second barrier is needed (i.e., to lower the air-gap<br>
flux). The added air barrier above the permanent magnet of the first layer<br>
acts as a barrier to the first layer magnet and lowers the magnet flux.<br>
Hence, the machine back EMF and the magnet induced losses (e.g., iron<br>
loss) are reduced. The added air barrier above the magnet also increases<br>
rotor saliency to an extent similar to a two-barrier rotor geometry. This<br>
partially compensates for the reduction in torque due to the reduction of<br>
the permanent magnet field in the air-gap .<br>
[0013] Interior PM machines often incorporate one or more rotor<br>
barriers (or simply "barriers"). These barriers introduce resistance<br>
(reluctance) to magnetic field thus introducing rotor saliency. This saliency<br>
is a source of torque and is commonly well-known as reluctance torque.<br>
Higher the number of barriers is usually higher is the reluctance torque.<br>
FIGS. l(a)-(c), for example, illustrate partial cross-sections through<br><br>
various exemplary IPM machines 100 with single and double barrier rotors<br>
106. More particular, FIG. 1(a) illustrates a rotor 100 with magnets 110<br>
and rotor slots or cavities (the barrier) 125 incorporated into the structure<br>
at various locations with respect to magnets 110. As is conventional, IPM<br>
100 includes a stator 101 having a plurality of windings 102 magnetically<br>
interacting with magnets 110 within rotor 106. Various cavities are<br>
provided within region 104 of rotor 106, and all or a portion of these<br>
cavities are filled with permanent magnets in the conventional manner,<br>
depending upon the number of layers incorporated into the structure.<br>
[0014] FIG 1(b), more particularly, depicts a two-barrier PM rotor<br>
with the second barrier partially filed with magnets 110. Similarly, FIG.<br>
1(c) illustrates a two-barrier PM rotor with no magnets in the second layer<br>
~ i.e., the second layer comprises only an air-filled cavity. The added<br>
second barrier shown in FIGS. 1(b) and 1(c) adds resistance to the lower<br>
magnet barrier, lowering the air-gap magnet flux. However, as mentioned<br>
previously, addition of the second barrier in the rotor can mechanically<br>
weaken the rotor. Also, for some machines, addition of any such second<br>
barrier is not geometrically feasible due to, for example, limited space<br>
(e.g., the rotor of FIG. 1(a)).<br>
[0015] Rotors with more than two barriers may also be provided;<br>
however, such designs undesirably increase manufacturing complexity.<br>
Increasing the number of barriers improves rotor saliency, and thus<br>
improves machine torque. Moreover, the second rotor barrier often works<br>
as a barrier to the inner magnet layer, consequently lowering the magnet<br>
flux in the air-gap. Lowering of magnet flux in the air-gap reduces the<br>
magnet torque, but is somewhat compensated by the increased saliency of<br>
the rotor as mentioned earlier.<br>
[0016] In hybrid applications, when the PM machine is part of a<br>
transmission, very often the machine is rotating in conjunction with a<br>
different gear-set even though machine is producing no torque or is<br>
producing very low torque. If the no-load or light load operation is a<br><br>
substantial portion of the machine drive cycle, the overall efficiency of the<br>
transmission is affected. Rotating magnet flux also induces voltage in the<br>
stator winding, commonly referred to as back EMF. The high magnet flux<br>
of a permanent magnet rotor may induce very high voltage in the stator,<br>
especially during high speed operation of the machine. Therefore,<br>
lowering of the machine air-gap flux is very desirable for such machines.<br>
[0017] FIG. 2 depicts an IPM machine 200 in accordance with one<br>
embodiment of the present invention in which an air-barrier is<br>
incorporated into the cavity or slot where the magnet is placed, rather than<br>
adding an additional barrier. That is, as shown, a pair of magnets 110 are<br>
placed within respective cavities that are configured to be larger than the<br>
magnets themselves, thus allowing air barriers to be formed adjacent to the<br>
magnets.<br>
[0018] In the cross-sectional illustration shown in FIG. 2, the cavity<br>
includes the union of the area filled by magnet 110 and the area defined by<br>
the various air pockets adjacent thereto, i.e.: air pockets 226, 225, and<br>
227. The term "cavity" is thus used to refer to a region thus defined prior<br>
to insertion of magnet 110. While FIG. 2 illustrates a cross-sectional view<br>
of magnets 110 and air pockets 225, 226, and 227, it will be understood<br>
that the cavity extends into region 104 of rotor 106 and will define a three-<br>
dimensional volume having any suitable shape.<br>
[0019] The size, location, and geometry of each air pocket 225, 226,<br>
and 227 may be selected to achieve the desired design objectives. In the<br>
illustrated embodiment, for example, air barriers 225 are configured<br>
adjacent to the "top" of magnets 110 (i.e., toward the outer surface of the<br>
rotor 101, radially). These top air barriers 225 are generally triangular (or<br>
trianguloid) and extend substantially the entire length of each magnet 110.<br>
In this embodiment, pairs of rectangular magnets are configured angled<br>
toward each other - i.e., defining an obtuse angle facing outward toward<br>
stator 101, and the widest portion of air pockets 225 (corresponding to<br><br>
each apex) is adjacent to that corner of magnet 110 that is closest to stator<br>
101.<br>
[0020] In this embodiment, additional "bottom" air barriers 227 are<br>
defined on the opposite side of magnet 110 from air gaps 225, and have a<br>
cross-sectional area that is substantially smaller than that of air gaps 225.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, bottom air gaps 227 are also generally<br>
triangular and are adjacent to a corner of magnet 110.<br>
[0021] Further illustrated in FIG. 2 are "side" air gaps 226 which, in<br>
this embodiment, are provided adjacent to an edge of magnet 110 as<br>
shown. In one embodiment, side air gaps 226 extend the full height<br>
(radially) of magnets 110.<br>
[0022] As illustrated, additional conventional air pocket (rotor slot)<br>
125 (i.e., air pockets that are non-contiguous with the cavities defined<br>
above, may also be provided within rotor 106.<br>
[0023] The structures described above are advantageous in a number<br>
of respects. In particular, the added air barrier 225 above the permanent<br>
magnet 110 acts as a barrier to the first layer magnet and lowers the<br>
magnet flux, thereby also reducing machine back EMF and magnet<br>
induced losses. At the same time, rotor saliency is increased due to the<br>
reduction of the d-axis (magnet axis) inductance.<br>
[0024] Figure 3, for example, is an empirical graph showing the no-<br>
load iron loss (spin loss) for the rotor of FIG. 2 compared to that for the<br>
rotor of FIG. 1(a) (no air-barrier). As can be seen, iron loss is greatly<br>
reduced. The addition of the air barrier also lowers machine back EMF.<br>
FIG. 4 depicts the back EMF of the above two rotors. As can be seen,<br>
machine back EMF is significantly reduced. The reduction in machine<br>
torque due to addition of the air-barrier (lower magnet flux) is minimal as<br>
some of the torque loss is compensated by the increased saliency of the<br>
rotor (higher reluctance torque).<br>
[0025] While at least one example embodiment has been presented in<br>
the foregoing detailed description, it should be appreciated that a vast<br><br>
number of variations exist. For example, additional barrier layers may be<br>
incorporated in addition to the single layer illustrated. It should also be<br>
appreciated that the example embodiment or embodiments described<br>
herein are not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of<br>
the invention in any way. Rather, the foregoing detailed description will<br>
provide those skilled in the art with a convenient road map for<br>
implementing the described embodiment or embodiments. It should be<br>
understood that various changes can be made in the function and<br>
arrangement of elements without departing from the scope of the invention<br>
and the legal equivalents thereof.<br><br>
