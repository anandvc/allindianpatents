				<td>A PEPIDOMIMETIC COMPOUND AND A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION THEREOF<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel anti-hypertensive molecules The present invention also provides a process for the preparation of novel antihypertensive molecules The present invention particularly relates to the preparation of novel Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEI) with prolonged activity. ACE inhibitors play an important role in Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosteron system (RAAS) by inhibiting the activity of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) and therefore are used to regulate blood pressure. ACE inhibitors synthesized by the process of present invention have a peptide moiety and nonpeptide moiety ACE inhibitors, synthesized by this present invention, show enhanced bioavailability and fewer side effects<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Hypertension has assumed the form of a grave problem all over the world In 18 23% people are suffering from hypertension. Over three-quarters of women aged 75 0f over and 64% of men aged 75 or over have hypertension. (Health, United States, 2002. Table 68). Annually, hypertension cause 23,761 deaths and there are 8 6 deaths per 100,000 population in 2000 (National Vital Statistics Report, Vol. 50, No 15)<br>
In India, it has been estimated that 10-20% people suffer from hypertension and with increasing urbanization, problem is compounding. Even in India, According to analysis, the prevalence-of Hypertension among adults in India is 11%. There is increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension especially of systolic level. The incidence is more in urban than in rural population. Prevalence is slightly more in women (Gupta, 1997). Cardiovascular deaths in India are estimated to be 2 5 million per year and by 2020 it will be the leading cause of death (Enas et al 1996). This provides window to our future as we urbanize and adopt unhealthy life styles.<br>
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme: Its Physiology<br>
In the development of blood pressure Renin Angiotensin Aldosteron System (RAAS) plays a major role (Petnllo et al, 1982). It interacts with Kallikrein-Kinm-Prostaglandin System (KKP) to regulate blood pressure. ACE, as it is well known, pla\s a pnotal role in both the system and helps in keeping homeostasis in blood pressure  the key components of RAAS include Renin, Angiotensinogen, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin-I, Angiotensin-II &amp; Aldosterone.  <br><br>
Increased ACE activity has also been linked to the hypertrophy of endothelial cells in<br>
vasculature by decreasing apoptosis. It causes the narrowing of lumen of vessels, which<br>
results in increased blood pressure. High ACE activity also contributes to oxidative stress.<br>
Kallikrein-Kinin-Prostaglandin is an alternative blood controlling system (fig.l)<br>
which is influenced by ACE. Kallikrein is a serine protease glycoprotein synsthesised in<br>
liver. It acts upon kininogens producing Bradykinin. Bradykinin synthesizes prostaglandins<br>
and nitric oxide (NO) that cause the relaxation of smooth muscles leading to a decrease in<br>
blood pressure. Angiotensin converting enzyme degrades Bradykinin thus augmenting the<br>
blood pressure (Bhoola et al, 1999).<br>
Interaction of Substrate of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme with Its Active Site<br>
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in both abovementioned<br>
systems.<br>
Angiotensin converting enzyme (MW 150-180 KD) is a membrane bound<br>
glycoprotein (Ehlers et al, 1989). It has two homologous domains: N-domain and C-domain.<br>
It is a Zn metalloprotease (Ehlers et al, 1989) and removes a dipeptide (His-Leu) from Cterminal<br>
of Ang-I (fig.2) and converting it to Ang-II, which is a potent vaso-constrictor. The<br>
active site of ACE has subsites S1, S1'and 82'. The substrate of ACE, Angiotensin-I, makes<br>
hydrophobic interaction with subsites S1, S1',S2'. While Zn2+ &amp; its coordinated-water<br>
molecule are present in a fourth subsite. The substrate gets oriented in such a way that it<br>
interacts with zinc-coordinated water molecule as shown in the figure 2. The glutamate<br>
polarizes and activates water molecule to hydrolyze Angiotensin-I into Angiotensin-II and a<br>
dipeptide. Increased ACE activity leads to enhanced production of Ang- II and degradation of<br>
bradykinin leading to increased BP.<br>
Inhibition of ACE<br>
From above, it can be concluded that ACE by regulating blood pressure is the hub of<br>
RAAS and KKP. So it may be deduced that molecules that can reduce ACE activity can be<br>
used to counter hypertension because inhibition of ACE leads to two major effects:<br>
(1) Decrease in the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II diminishes the effect of<br>
RAAS and thus relaxing the smooth muscles and reduce the production of aldosterone<br>
resulting in decrease of blood volume and blood pressure (Giudicelli et al, 1995).<br>
(2) Decrease in bradykinin degradation in KKP system. . Bradykinin, when interacts with B2<br>
receptors at endothelial cells, causes the release of endothelium-derived relaxing factors like<br>
nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin-prostacyclin which cause relaxation of smooth muscles<br>
leading to a decrease in BP (Giudicelli et al, 1995).<br>
New Aspects of Inhibition of ACE<br>
Recent reports suggest that advantages of ACE inhibition go beyond its conventional<br>
roles because ACEIs<br>
(1) Decrease in hypertrophy that may decline the chances of atherosclerosis (Chobanian et<br>
al, 1990).<br>
(2) Decrease in oxidative stress by reducing the formation of superoxide anions(Munzel and<br>
Keaney, 2001)<br>
(3) Decrease in tissue factor activity that can prevent the development of atherosclerosis<br>
(Napoleone et al, 2000).<br>
(4) Decrease in ACE activity can increase the level of Ac-SDKP and it can be used as anti<br>
cancer therapy (Azizi et al, 1996).<br>
In view of the above-mentioned roles of ACE inhibitors in various disorders, several<br>
groups of researchers are engaged in developing drug targets as angiotensin converting<br>
enzyme inhibitors.<br>
Current Status of Hypertension Therapies:<br>
Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs)<br>
Several vasodilating agents have been synthesized in treatment of congestive heart<br>
failure and hypertension. Nitrates like isosorbide mononitrate and glyceryl trinitrates are used<br>
to counter hypertension (Winbury and Gabel, 1967) but they have a short duration of action<br>
(Cohn, Johnson and Ziesche et al, 1991). A diuretic like thiazide increases the excretion of<br>
water and along with it sodium. A decrease in sodium leads to hypovolumia resulting in<br>
decreased BP. One of the main shortcoming of diuretics is hypokalemia (Brater, 1998). Ca+<br>
plays an important role in muscle contraction. Ca+ channel blockers inhibit influx of Ca+ and<br>
do not let the blood pressure rise (Weiner, 1994). Side effects of headache, dizziness and<br>
flushing along with peripheral edema are most prominent with Ca channel blockers (Psaty et<br>
al, 1995). p-blockers are also among the front line therapy for hypertension. They block the<br>
sympathic beta-receptors, which prevent sympathic stimulation of heart rate and cardiac<br>
metabolism. Side effects of Beta-blockers are light-headedness, postural hypotension, cold<br>
extremities, gastric upset with heartburn, diarrhea and impotence (Quyyumi et al, 1984).<br>
Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosteron System plays the pivotal in development of<br>
hypertension. The main acting agent of this system is Ang II, which is a potent<br>
vasoconstrictor. There are two main strategies that do not let the Ang II elicit its<br>
vasoconstrictive effects. First is ATI receptor antagonist, which do not let Ang II bind to its<br>
ATI receptors (Goodfriend et al, 1996). Second therapy dealing with RAAS is Angiotensin<br>
Converting Enzyme Inhibitors. These inhibitors competitively bind to the active site of<br>
ACE and do not let natural substrates (Ang I &amp;Bradykinin) bind to the active site. Captoprils,<br>
Enalpril are main ACE inhibitor.<br>
ACEIs are the most important among the drugs controlling hypertension. All the<br>
drugs currently available in the market have a more or less similar mode of action. These<br>
drugs inhibit the activity of ACE as depicted in the fig. 1 that leads to decreased formation of<br>
Ang II reducing BP.<br>
The main drugs currently available in the market are captopril, enalpril, fosinopril,<br>
ramipril and lisinopril.<br>
Captopril is a derivative of proline and D-2-Methyle-3-mercaptopropionic acid whose<br>
SH group efficiently interacts with Zn in active site and replaces the water molecule.<br>
(Cushman and Ondetti, 1991).<br>
Enalpril has proline and alanine derived moiety whose COO" group interacts with Zn<br>
in active site. It is a prodrug that is converted by esterase activity in liver to more active<br>
enalprilate (Patchett et al, 1980).<br>
Fosinopril is a derivative of proline and acetic acid derivative with phosphate group<br>
that interacts with Zn. Its absorption is rapid. By esterase activity it is converted to<br>
fosinoprilate (Singhvi et al, 1988).<br>
Ramipril is a carboxylated dipeptide inhibitor prodrug. In body it is converted into<br>
diacid ramiprilate (Vasment and Bender, 1989).<br>
Limitations of Current ACE Inhibitors<br>
(1) Since most of the ACE inhibitors, synthesized so far, are peptide based. Their peptide<br>
nature makes them susceptible to proteolytic degradation and the body excretes them. Due to<br>
this reason, ACE inhibitors show less bioavailability and therefore repeated and larger doses<br>
are needed to have the desired effects (Gavras and Gavras, 1980).<br>
(2) Sometimes ACE inhibitors lead to accumulation of bradykinin in air passages resulting in<br>
bronchospasm and dry-cough (Israili and Hall, 1992).<br>
(3) ACE inhibitor therapy is some times associated with angioedema in which watery fluid is<br>
collected under skin, mucous membrane or subcutaneous tissue that sometimes erupt to form<br>
boils on skin (Israili and Hall, 1992).<br>
(4) The ACE inhibitors, due to presence of different functional groups, cause rashes, skin<br>
irritation, neutropenia and taste alteration (DiBianco, 1986).<br>
(5) Most of the ACE inhibitors cause hypotension. The frequency of hypotension is higher in<br>
case of diuretic intake (Hodsman et al, 1983).<br>
(6) They also cause a decline in renal function. During ACE inhibition efferent arteriolar<br>
resistance decreases and glomerular filtration declines (Hricik et al, 1983).<br>
(7) ACE inhibitors also cause hyperkalemia because aldosterone is inhibited (Warren and<br>
O'Connor, 1980).<br>
Peptidomimics: A New Approach<br>
The side effects of these inhibitors have resulted in renewed efforts in modifying the<br>
available drugs or developing new drugs with minimum side effects and longer<br>
bioavailability. Despite the significant efforts to develop ACE inhibitors devoid of the above<br>
said side effects, progress has been disappointed. Moreover currently available ACEIs are<br>
peptide-based compounds which are proteolysed by various proteases and excreted by body.<br>
However to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to modify the<br>
peptidic nature of these inhibitors in order to inhibit the proteolytic cleavage by various<br>
proteases to enhance the longevity as well as their better interaction in the active site. A new<br>
emerging concept in the form of peptidomimics seems to be the right answer to this problem<br>
(Beelay, 1994).<br>
Peptidomimics are synthesized by combining peptidic moiety to nonpeptidic moiety.<br>
The nonpeptide moieties used include unusual amino acids, some non-toxic, pharmacophoric<br>
heterocyclics and diphenyls. These peptidomimics can be used as ACE inhibitor because they<br>
can be resistant to proteolysis and have good interaction with active site.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation<br>
of novel antihypertensive molecules.<br>
Another objective is to provide a process for the preparation of peptidomimics that<br>
can act as ACE inhibitors.<br>
Still another objective is to provide novel antihypertensive ACE inhibiting<br>

Another objective is to provide a process to prepare ACE inhibitors that can bind to<br>
the active site of ACE by hydrophobic and hydrophilic interaction which can be achieved by<br>
proper selection of amino acids<br>
Still another objective is to provide a process for the synthesis of ACE inhibitors that can strongly hgate with the Zn present in the active site in such a way that it can not compete with and carry out the hydrolysis of substrate.<br>
Another objective is to provide a process to synthesize ACE inhibitors having nonpeptide moiety or unusual amino acids (pharmacophore group) that can make a nonpeptide bond resistant tigainst proteolysis<br>
Another objective is to provide ACE inhibitors that can show selective inhibition of the two active sites 1 e. N-domain &amp; C-domain active site of the ACE.<br>

Other and further aspects, features, and advantages of the present invention will be<br>
apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiments of the invention given<br>
for the purpose of disclosure. Alternative embodiments of the invention can be envisaged by<br>
those skilled in the art. All such alternative embodiments are intended to lie within the scope<br>
of this invention.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Synthesis of Peptidomimics<br>
For proper drug targeting there is need to synthesize the library of compounds i.e.<br>
Peptidomimics. These peptidomimics are being designed according to Structural Activity<br>
Relationship, synthesized by Combinatorial Chemistry and their inhibition is checked by In<br>
vitro studies,<br>
(a) Designing of Novel Peptidomimics<br>
Peptidomimic compounds that can act as ACE inhibitor preferably must have<br>
following features (fig.3):<br>
 (1) The peptidomimic compound should have aromatic, aliphatic amino acids like Phe, Trp,<br>
Tyr Pro (Cheung et al 1980).<br>
(2) A negatively charged COO" group should be present at C-terminal.<br>
(3) Amino acids like lie, Leu, Lys and Val are incorporated next to the C-terminal amino<br>
acid.<br>
(4) In peptidomimic compound the aromatic moieties of currently existing ACEIs are<br>
replaced with suitable heterocyclics or unusual amino acids.<br>
The process of present invention thus results in the synthesis of di and<br>
tripeptidomimics consisting of various combinations of aromatic amino acids (Phe, Trp, Tyr<br>
and Pro) and aliphatic amino acids (He, Leu, Lys and Val). The residues chosen at Cterminal<br>
will enhance hydrophobic interactions with subsites SI', S2'. The negatively<br>
charged COO" group of these amino acids at C-terminal has hydrophobic interaction with<br>
positively charged Arg residue in the enzyme's active site. Hydrophobic side chains of<br>
aliphatic amino acids, next to the C-terminal amino acid, establish interaction with ACE<br>
hydrophobic subsite SI'. A carbonyl of amide bond of these amino acids forms H-bonds<br>
with hydrogen of ACE active site. In new peptidomimics, N-terminal will be substituted with<br>
suitable hetrocyclic or unusual amino acids to enhance their bioavailability as well as their<br>
interaction with co-ordinated Zn and hydrophobic subsite SI present in enzyme's active site.<br>
Heterocyclic moieties are the molecules that have certain medicinally functional<br>
groups known as 'pharmacophores'. These pharmacophores are supposed to be compatible<br>
with human system. These molecules are also expected to produce conformational constraints<br>
that help them to interact with active site in a better and effective way.<br>
The work as designed and described above involves synthesis of large number of<br>
peptidomimics. This can be best achieved by the combinatorial chemistry, which will be used<br>
in the present proposed work,<br>
(b) Synthesis of Peptidomimics: Combinatorial Chemistry<br>
This concept takes its origin with the aim of synthesizing 96 diverse peptides<br>
simultaneously (Furk et al, 1991). In this method, in each reaction vessel, peptides with<br>
different sequences are synthesized preferably by solid phase peptide synthesis. This<br>
technique is of two types:<br>
(1) Multiple Synth esis of Mixture of Peptides<br>
This method involves the synthesis of mixture of large number of peptides called as<br>
compound libraries of peptides. In this method, in each reaction vessel peptides with different<br>
sequences are simultaneously synthesized. This method, also called pool and split method,<br>
involves:<br>
(a) Dividing or splitting of resin into different parts.<br>
(b) Coupling of resin with amino acids.<br>
(c) Mixing of coupled parts of resin and adding new amino acids to generate mixture of<br>
peptides.<br>
(2) Multiple Synthesis of Individual Peptides<br>
Multiple synthesis of individual peptides involves synthesis of large number of<br>
individual peptides (Beck-sickinger and Jung, 1996) One peptide sequence is synthesized in<br>
each reaction vessel. There is no splitting and mixing of reaction products like in previous<br>
case. This method requires coupling, washing and deprotection repeatedly.<br>
(c) Evaluation of Inhibition of Peptidomimics<br>
(1) In vitro Study of Peptidomimic Inhibitors<br>
The library of peptidomimic compound was evaluated for their ACE inhibition<br>
potencies by determining the ACE activity by in-vitro enzyme assay using<br>
spectrophotometric method (Cheung et al,1980). In this assay ACE acts upon synthetic<br>
substrate Hip-His-Leu. The following assay components in a final volume of 0.25 ml are<br>
incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C: 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, 5 mM Hip-<br>
His-Leu, 300 mM NaCl and angiotensin converting enzyme (12 miliunits/ml of assay<br>
volume). The rate of hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu is determined by measuring the absorbance<br>
of hippuric acid after extracting into ethyl acetate, evaporation of solvent at 120 °C and<br>
redissolution into water. Extracted hippuric acid is then measured by reading absorbance at<br>
228 nm.<br>
(2) In vivo Study of Peptidomimics as ACE Inhibitors<br>
Evaluation of ACE inhibition of synthesized peptidomimics is done in hypertensive<br>
rats. Wistar rats (female, 225-250 gm) were taken and hypertension was induced in these rats<br>
by administering the injection of Methylprednisolone per week for two weeks (Elijovich and<br>
Krakoff, 1980). After two weeks when rats become hypertensive, the efficacy of synthesized<br>
ACE inhibitors is checked in in-vivo conditions by intra venous administration in<br>
pharmacologically accepted medium in doses ranging from 5 mg/ kg of body weight to 10<br>
mg/kg of body weight..<br>
The following examples are given for the present invention and should be construed<br>
to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>

Example 11<br>
In-vitro Evaluation of ACE Inhibition of Synthesized Peptidomimics<br>
The peptidomimic compound L-Abrine-Ornithine-Proline was evaluated for its ACE<br>
inhibition potency by determining the ACE activity assay using spectrophotometric method.<br>
In this assay ACE acts upon synthetic substrate Hip-His-Leu. The following assay<br>
components in a final volume of 0.25 ml are incubated for 20 minutes at 37°C: 100 mM<br>
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.3, 5 mM Htp-His-Leu, 300 mM NaCl and angiotensin<br>
converting enzyme (12 miliunits/ml of assay volume). The rate of hydrolysis of Hip-His-Leu<br>
is determined by measuring the absorbance of hippuric acid after extracting into ethyl acetate,<br>
evaporation of solvent at 120 °C and redissolution into water. Extracted hippuric acid is then<br>
measured by reading absorbance at 228 nm.. L-Abrine -Ornithine -Proline and 3- (3-<br>
thienyl)-L-alanine-Ornithine-Proline were evaluated for their ACE inhibition efficacy by this<br>
assay. 3- (3-thienyl)-L-aIanme-Ornithine-Proline showed its ICso to be 2 jj. mole. The ICso of<br>
L-Abrine -Ornithine -Proline was found to be 10 \i mole. Inhibition kinetics of L-Abrine -<br>
Ornithine -Proline is illustrated in fig.4 . The control experiment contained no peptidomimic<br>
ACE inhibitor.<br>
Example 12<br>
Development of Animal Model for Hypertension<br>
Female wistar rats with an initial body weight of 225-250 gm were used in this<br>
experiment. Three groups of animals were made: Group I (n=3) of control animals; Group II<br>
(n=3) of animals for reference inhibitor captopril and Group III (n=5) of animal for<br>
synthesized ACE inhibitors Measurement of body weight and tail systolic blood presssure<br>
were made in unanesthetsized animals.<br>
A long acting suspension of 20 mg/kg methylprednisolone (Depo-Medrol, Pharmacia)<br>
was administered subcutaneously per week for two weeks in animals of group II and III.<br>
Group I of control animals received only vehicle polyethylene glycol (PEG). All animals had<br>
free access to tap water, were placed on regular rat chow and had their tail systolic pressure<br>
measured every week for two weeks. After two weeks of treatment, all the animal s became<br>
significantly hypertensive (fig.5).<br>
Example 13<br>
In-vivo Administration of Synthesized Peptidomimics as ACE Inhibitor<br>
(a) Surgical Procedure<br>
The rats were anaesthetized by intraperitoneal administration of urethane.(l gm/kg).<br>
The trachea was cannulated with polyethylene tube. Polyethylene cannulas were also placed<br>
into the rat femoral artery and vein. The arterial catheter was used for recording of blood<br>
pressure and the venous catheter was used for the administration of drugs/peptides. After<br>
surgery, animals were allowed 30 min for stabilization before starting the experiment.<br>
(b) Physiological Measurement<br>
Arterial blood pressure was measured with a pressure transducer (WPI-model BPLR)<br>
with a strain gauge/bridge amplifier (WPI-model TBM4) connected to four channel digital<br>
oscillograph Tektronix (Model TDS 420A). Permanent records were obtained by storing and<br>
copying on a floppy disk from the oscillograph. From the arterial blood pressure waveform,<br>
mean arterial pressure and diastolic blood pressure were measured.<br>
(c) Drug Administration<br>
Varying amounts of L-Abrine-Ornithine-Proline (5 mg/kg, 8 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg)<br>
were dissolved in normal saline. Peptidomimics was injected i.v. in constant volume of 0.2<br>
ml over a period of 10 seconds and the venous catheter was flushed with an additional 0.3 ml<br>
of saline. Readings of mean arterial pressure (MAP) were made after each 10 minutes till<br>
blood pressure returned to base line.<br>
Example 14<br>
Hypotensive Effect of Synthesized Peptidomimics as ACE Inhibitor<br>
At 5mg/kg L-Abrine-Ornithine-Proline showed its hypotensive effect which caused a<br>
fall of around 15 mm Hg (fig.6). Hypotensive effect started after almost five minutes and<br>
blood pressure returned to baseline within 30 minutes. A dose of 8 mg/kg of L-Abrine-<br>
Ornithine-Proline began to show its hypotensive effect five minute after its administration. At<br>
this dose, blood pressure declined upto 46 mm Hg. It nearly took 160 minutes for blood<br>
pressure to return to baseline. The highest dose used was 10 mg/kg. It showed strong<br>
hypotensive effect. The onset of hypotensive effect was again after five minutes of<br>
administration. A fall in blood pressure of almost 50 mmHg was reached within 70 minutes<br>
and blood pressure did not return to baseline even after 180 minutes<br>
Reference inhibitor captopril was used at dose of 1 mg/kg. This dose of captopril<br>
caused fall of 60 mm Hg and was quite effective in blocking angiotensin-converting enzyme<br>
even after 180 minutes and blood pressure returned to baseline after 240 minutes (not<br>
shown).<br>
