PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
the following specifications particularly describe the nature of this invention and the method in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method for calculating capacitance value and magnetizing inductance value for smooth sustained voltage build up in an induction generator.<br>
This invention particularly relates to a method for calculating capacitance value and magnetizing inductance value for smooth sustained voltage build up in an induction generator of a wind power generation system.<br>
The magnetizing inductance value calculated according to the invention is that for the saturated region of the induction generator.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A wind power generation system generates electricity from wind energy and comprises an induction generator coupled to a wind turbine or windmill through a gear box and a control system. In a wind power generation system, the mechanical energy of the wind turbine is converted into electrical energy by the induction generator. In order to convert the wind energy into electrical energy efficiently, it is important that the induction generator operates smoothly. For smooth operation of the induction generator it is essential that the voltage generated in the stator windings is sustained and is without transients. If the voltage generated in the stator windings of the generator is not sustained and smooth, there will be vibrations in the wind turbine leading to wear and tear of the wind turbine thereby reducing its life. In order to initiate voltage generation by the induction generator (self excitation), a leading reactive power is provided to the stator windings of the generator by connecting a capacitor bank to the stator windings. It is essential that the capacitance value of the capacitor bank is such that at a given rotor speed, voltage generated in the stator windings is<br><br>
without large transients. Therefore, calculation of the capacitance value of the capacitor bank is very critical for the desired operation of the induction generator. It is known that the induction generator operates in the saturated region during the self-excitation [D. Seyoum, C. Grantham and F. Rahman, "The dynamic characteristics of an isolated self-excited induction generator driven by a wind turbine" IEEE Trans. Industry Applications, vol. 39, no. 4, Jul/Aug 2003, pp. 936-944]. It is also known that the maximum value of magnetizing inductance (Lmax) in the saturated region leads to sustained voltage generation in the stator windings [D. Seyoum, C. Grantham, and F. Rahman, "The dynamic characteristics of an isolated self-excited induction generator driven by a wind turbine" IEEE Trans. Industry Applications, vol. 39, no. 4, Jul/Aug 2003, pp. 936-944, and Thakur RK and Agarwal V, " Effect of excitation capacitance value on the transient behaviour of induction generator in wind energy conversion system", National Power Electronics Conference, Bangalore, Dec 2007]. Therefore, in order to accurately calculate the capacitance value it is essential to know the maximum value of the magnetizing inductance in the saturated region. But this value is not known and available. However, it is known that the magnetizing inductance value in the saturated region lies between zero and Lmax value in the unsaturated region [C. Grantham, D. Sutanto and B Mismail, "Steady state and transient analysis of self-excited induction generators", IEE proc, B, 136, (2) pp. 61-68, 1989]. It is possible to obtain the Lmax value in the unsaturated region experimentally [C. Grantham, D. Sutanto and B Mismail, "Steady state and transient analysis of self-excited induction generators", IEE proc. B, 136, (2) pp. 61-68, 1989]. For accurate calculation of the capacitance value it is necessary to take into consideration the magnetizing inductance value for the saturated region both in the steady state and dynamic state operating conditions of the induction generator.<br><br>
Per phase equivalent impedance method is used for the calculation of the capacitance value of the capacitor bank of an induction generator [T. Ahmed, 0. Noro, K. Matsuo, Y. Shindo and M. Nakaoka, "Minimum excitation capacitance requirements for wind turbine coupled stand-alone self-excited induction generator with voltage regulation based on SVC", IEICE/IEEE INTELEC03, Oct. 19-23, 2003 and A.M. Eltamaly, "New formula to determine the minimum capacitance required for self-excited induction generator", Power Electronics Specialists Conference, vol. 1, pp. 106 - 110, 23-27 June, 2002] . In this method the induction generator is represented as a steady state equivalent circuit as illustrated below:<br><br>
Vg       =	Air gap Voltage (Volt)<br>
Xir,Xls.X       =	Per phase terminal excitation capacitive impedance (H)<br>
Xs, Xr, X =	Per phase stator, rotor (referred to stator) and load inductive impedance (H)<br>
Rs, Rr, R =	Per phase stator, rotor (referred to stator) and load resistance (Q)<br>
F	=	Frequency (Hz)<br>
v	=	Speed<br>
The loop equation for the current (I) in the above circuit is as follows:<br><br><br>
where Z is the net loop impedance.<br>
The steady state equivalent circuit is obtained from the steady state operating condition of the induction generator. The capacitance value (Xc) in equation 1 is calculated by substituting Lm in equation 1 with the Lmax value for the unsaurated region and using iterative methodologies such as Newton- Raphson method. Since equation 1 is obtained from the steady state operating condition of the induction generator and since tne value of Lm used is the Lmax value for the unsaturated region the capacitance value obtained is not accurate.<br>
D-q model based eigenvalue sensitivity method is also used for the calculation of the capacitance value of the capacitor bank [Li Wang and Ching-Huei Lee, "A novel analysis on the performance of an isolated self-excited induction gnerator", IEEE Trans. Energy Conversion, 12, (2), pp. 109-117, June 1997, C. Grantam, D. Sutanto and B Mismail, "Steady state and transient analysis of self-excited induction generators", IEE proc. B, 136, (2) pp. 61-68, 1989, and D. Seyoum, C. Grantham, and F. Rahman, "The dynamics of an isolated self-excited induction generator driven by a wind turbine" The 27th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, Vol. 2, pp. 1364-1369, Dec. 2001]. In this method the induction generator is represented as a dynamic state equivalent circuit as illustrated below:<br><br><br><br><br>

Per phase stator and rotor (referred to stator) resistance (H)<br>
Per phase stator and rotor (referred to stator) inductance (H)<br>

Stator quadrature and direct axis voltage (volt)<br>
Stator quadrature and direct axis currents (Amp)<br>
Rotor quadrature and direct axis currents (Amp)<br>
Per phase magnetizing inductance (referred to stator) (H)<br>
Per phase capacitance (F)<br><br><br>
The terminal voltage equation obtained from the above circuits is as follows:<br><br><br>
The capacitance value C is calculated from equation 2 by substituting Lm in equation 2 with the Lmax value for the unsaturated region and using iterative methodologies like Gauss-Siedel method.<br>
The equivalent circuit is obtained from the dynamic state of operation of the induction generator.<br>
This method is comparatively more accurate as it takes into account the dynamic state of operation of the induction generator. However, this method is also not very accurate and reliable as it makes use of the value of Lmax for the unsaturated region.<br>
The above methods do not give the Lmax value for the saturated region. This value would have been useful to calculate the electrical torque and power output of the induction generator theoretically. The Lmax value could have been used to design the induction generator for optimal performance.<br>

The real part and imaginary part of the 6th order polynomial is generated by replacing the complex variable 's' in the 6th order polynomial as jco and substituting the value of Lm as [0 -Lmax value in the unsaturated region] and value of C as [0 - ω]. The real part and imaginary part are generated as follows:<br>

The Lmax value in the unsaturated region is obtained experimentally for a particular rotor<br>
speed of the induction generator [C. Grantham, D. Sutanto and B Mismail, "Steady state and<br>
transient analysis of self-excited induction generators", IEE proc. B, 136, (2) pp. 61-68,<br>
1989].<br>
The real and imaginary parts are set to zero and a pair of equations is obtained for C and Lm.<br>
The equations for C and Lm are as follows:<br><br>
The above equations are solved simultaneously using interval analysis method to obtain all the solutions for C and Lm. The capacitance value and corresponding magnetizing inductance (Lmax) value for the saturated region is extracted from the solutions obtained for C and Lm for smooth sustained voltage build up in an induction generator .<br>
The following example is illustrative of the invention but not limitative of the scope thereof.<br>
Example 1<br>
A. Using the d-q based eigenvalue sensitivity method, the capacitance value was calculated for a three phase induction generator of the following specification:<br>
V= 220V<br>
I=4.8A<br>
f=60Hz<br>
Rotor Speed= 377 rad/sec<br><br>
The Lmax value in the unsaturated region was obtained experimentally and was found to be 0.28H. Lm in the terminal voltage equation (2) was substituted by this value of Lmax. Eigenvalue sensitivity method was used to calculate the value of capacitance. The capacitance value obtained was 84.97 uF.<br>
When the above induction generator was operated using the calculated capacitance value, the voltage generated in the stator windings is as seen in Fig 1. The waveform portion comprising the transients is marked as A.<br>
B. The capacitance for the same induction generator for the same rotor speed was calculated using the method of the invention.<br>
The capacitance value obtained was 34 uF and the corresponding value of magnetizing inductance for the saturated region obtained was 0.23 H.<br>
When the above induction generator was operated using the calculated capacitance value, the voltage generated in the stator windings is as seen in Fig 2. The waveform portion comprising the transients is marked as B.<br>
It is very clear from the above comparative example that when the induction generator is operated using the capacitance value calculated using the method of the invention the transients generated in the stator windings are of reduced amplitude. This results in reduced vibrations of the systems/components such as a wind turbine connected to the induction generator thereby leading to increased life of such systems/components. It is very evident from the above example that the method of the invention is simple and easy to carry out. The<br><br>
method of the invention results in the value of Lmax for the saturated region which can be used to calculate the electrical torque and power output of the induction generator theoretically. The method of the invention can, therefore, be used to design the induction generator for optimal performance.<br><br>
