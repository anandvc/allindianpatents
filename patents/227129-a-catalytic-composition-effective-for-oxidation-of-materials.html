				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to catalytic composition and methods for oxidizing materials in the presence of catalysts which are complexes of transition metals such as Mn, Fe or Cr, with selected macropolycyclic rigid ligands, preferably cross bridged macropolycyclic ligands. More specifically, the present invention relates to catalytic oxidation of oxidizable compounds using said metal catalysts, including synthetic organic oxidation reactions as appropriate to chemical process industry, drug synthesis, and the preparation of specialty chemicals, such as enantiomeric epoxidation of alkenes, oxidation of organic functional groups, hydrocarbons, heteroatoms, or enynes, conversion of sulfides to sulfones, and the like, oxidation of oxidizable compounds (e.g., stains) on surfaces such as fabrics, dishes, countertops dentures and the like; oxidation of oxidizable compounds in solution dye transfer inhibition in the laundering of fabrics; the decontamination of soils, and further, to the bleaching of pulp and paper. Prefered catalytic systems include transition-metal complexes of ligands which are polyazamacropolycycles, especially including specific azamacrobicycles, such as cross-bridged derivatives of cyclam.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A damaging effect of manganese on fabrics during bleaching has been known since the 19th century. In the 1960's and 70's, efforts were made to include simple Mn(ii) salts in detergents, but none saw commerical success. More recently, metal-containing catalysts containing macrocyclic ligands have ben described for use in bleaching compositions. Such catalysts include those described as manganese-containing derivatives of small macrocycles, especially l,4,7-trimethyl-l,4,7-triazacyclononane. These catalysts assertdely catalyze the bleaching action of peroxy compounds against various stains. Several are said to be effective in washing and bleaching of substrates, including in laundry and cleaning applications and in the textile, paper and wood pulp industries. However, such metal-containing bleach catalysts, especially these manganese-containing catalysts, still have shortcomings, for example a tendency to damage textile fabric, relatively high cost, high color, and the ability to locally stain or discolor substrates.<br>
Salts--of-cationic-rnetal dry cave complexes have been described in U.S. latent 4,888,032, to Busch, December 19, 1989 as completing oxygen reversibly, and are taught as being useful for oxygen scavenging and separating oxygen from air. A wide variety of ligands are taught to be usable, some of which include macrocycle ring structures and bridging groups. See also: D,H. Busch, Chemical Reviewsr (1993), 21, 847 - 880, for example the discussion of superstructures on polydentate ligands at pages 856-857, and references cited therein, as well as B. K. Coltrain et al., "Oxygen Activation by Transition Metal Complexes of Macrobicyclic Cyclidene Ligands" in "The Activation of Dioxygen and Homogeneous Catalytic Oxidation", Ed. by E.H.R. Barton, et al, (Plenum Press, NY; 1993), pp. 359-380.<br>
More recently the literature on azamacrocycles has grown at a rapid pace. Among the many references are Hancock et. al., J. Chem. Soc.r Chem. Commun., (1987), 1129-1130; Weisman et al., "Synthesis and Transition Metal Complexes of New Cross-Bridged Tetraamine Ligands", Chem. Commun.. (1996), 947-948; U.S. 5,428, 180, U.S. 5,504,075, and U.S. 5,126,464, all to Burrows et al;;-U,S. 5,480,990, to Kiefer et al.; and U.S. 5.374,4167to Rousseaux et al.<br>
Homogeneous transition metal catalysis is a broad realm that has enjoyed intensive activity leading to a number of large scale chemical processes; e.g., the Monsanto acetic acid process, the Dupont adiponitrile process, and others, among which certain famous ones involve oxidations (Wacker Process, Midcentury Process). Further, transition metal oxidation catalysis has been promoted heavily in studies on the biomimicry of the monooxygenase enzymes, especially cytochrome P450, Whereas such studies have emphasized and shown the prowess of the native porphyrin prosthetic group, others have shown that certain oxidative capabilities exist in the same metal ions in the simple solvated condition. This history reveals the possibility that catalytic oxidation may alter almost all families of organic compounds to yield valuable products, but successful applications depend on the activity of the putative catalyst, it survivabiliry under reaction conditions, its selectivity, and the absence of undesirable side reactions or over-reaction.<br>
It has now surprisingly been determined that the use of certain transition-metal catalysts- of specific rigid macropolycycles, preferably containing cross-<br>
bridging, have exceptional kinetic stability such that the metal tons only dissociate very slowly under conditions which would destroy complexes with ordinary ligands, and further have exceptional thermal stability. Thus, the present invention catalyst systems can provide one or more important benefits. These include improved effectiveness and in some instances even synergy with one or more primary oxidants<br>
such as. hydrogen peroxide, hydrophilically or hydrophobically activated hydrogen peroxide, preformed peracids, monopersulfate or hypochlorite; the ability to be effective catalysts, some, especially those containing Mn(II), having little to no color and allowing great formulation flexibility for use in consumer products where product aesthetics are very important; and effectiveness on a variety of substrates and reactants, including a variety of soiled or stained fabrics or hard surfaces while minimizing tendency to stain or damage such surfaces.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides improved catalytic systems containing transition-metal oxidation catalysts, and methods which utilize these catalysts and catalytic systems in the area of chemical syntheses involving organic oxidation reactions, such as oxidation of organic functional groups, hydrocarbons, or heteroatoms, and epoxidation of alkenes; oxidation of oxidizable stains on fabrics and hard surfaces; oxidation of reactants in solutions; pulp and paper bleaching; the oxidation of organic pollutants and for other equivalent highly desirable purposes.<br>
These and other objects are secured herein, as will be seen from the following disclosures.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Transition metals such as manganese are well-known in oxidation systems. Free Mn +2 ions have, for example, been implicated in the oxidation of lignin by white rot mycetes. Manganese and other transition metals in complexed form are familiar in biological systems with a variety of ligands. See, for example, "The Biological Chemistry of the Elements", J.J.R. Fraustro da Silva and R.J.P. Williams, Clarendon Press, Oxford, reprinted 1993. Complexes of ligands such as substituted porphyrins with iron, manganese, chromium or ruthenium are asserted to be useful in catalyzing a variety of oxidative reactions, including oxidation of lignin and industrial pollutants. See, for example, U.S. 5,077,394.<br>
A recent review of nickel-catalyzed oxidations includes the following disclosures: (1) simple tetradentate ligands such as cyclam (a non-cross-bridged, N-H functional tetraazamacrocycle) or salen (a four-donor N,N,O,0 ligand) render Ni(II) active for olefm epoxidation; (2) Ni salen complexes can utilize sodium hypocWorite as primary oxidant and show high catalytic turnover in epoxidation reactions; (3) bleach can be used under phase-transfer conditions for manganese porphyrin-catalyzed epoxidations and can be adapted to Ni as well; and (4) reactivity is dramatically influenced by pH with conversion of styrenes into epoxides being quantitative under conditions said to be optimized at pH 9.3.<br>
The catalysis of oxidation reactions by transition metals is more generally useful in synthetic organic chemistry in such varied aspects of the chemical process<br>
industry as commodity chemical production and drug manufacture, in addition to the laboratory, and also in consumer product applications such as detergency. Laundry bleaching in general is reviewed in Kirk Qthmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, 3rd and 4th editions under a number of headings including "Bleaching Agents", "Detergents" and "Peroxy Compounds", Laundry applications of bleaching systems include the use of amido-derived bleach activators in laundry detergents as described in U.S. 4,634,551, The use of manganese with various ligands to enhance bleaching is reported in the following United States Patents: U.S. 4,430,243; U.S. 4,728,455; U.S. 5,246,621; U.S. 5,244,594; U.S. 5,284,944; U.S. 5,194,416; U.S, 5,246,612; U.S. 5,256,779; U.S. 5,280,117; U.S. 5,274,147; U.S. 5,153,161; U.S. 5,227,084; U.S. 5,114,606; U.S. 5,114,611. See also: EP 549,271 Al; EP 544,490 Al; EP 549,272 Al; and EP 544,440 A2.<br>
U.S, 5,580,485 describes a bleach and oxidation catalyst comprising an iron complex having formula A[LFeXn]ZYq(A) or precursors thereof. The most preferred<br>
ligand is said, to be N,N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-bis(pyridin-2-yl)methylamine, N4?y. The Fe-complex catalyst is said to be useful in a bleaching system comprising<br>
a peroxy compound or a precursor thereof and suitable for use in the washing and bleaching of substrates including laundry, dishwashing and hard surface cleaning. Alternatively, the Fe-complex catalyst is assertedly also useful in the textile, paper and wood-pulp industries.<br>
The art of the transition metal chemistry of macrocycles is enormous; see, for example "Heterocyclic compounds: Aza-crown macrocycles", J.S. Bradshaw et. al., Wiley-Interscience, 1993 which also describes a number of syntheses of such ligands. See especially the table beginning at p. 604. U.S. 4,888,032jlescribes salts of cationic metal dry cave complexes.<br>
Cross-bridging, i.e., bridging across nonadjacent nitrogens, of cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane) is described by Weisman et al, J. Amet. Chem. SOC, (1990), 112(23), 8604-8605. More particularly, Weisman et al,, Chem Commun.(1996), pp. 947-948 describe new cross-bridged tetraamine ligands which are bicyclo(6.6.2J, [6,5.2], and [5,5.2) systems, and their complexation to Cu(II) and Ni(II) demonstrating that the ligands coordinate the metals in a cleft. Specific complexes reported include those of the ligands 1.1:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which A is hydrogen or benzyl and (a) m=n=l; or (b) m=l and n=0; or (c) m=n=0, including a Cu(II)chloride complex of the ligand having A= H and m=n=1; Cu(II) perchlorate complexes where A=H and m=n=l or m=n=0; a Cu(II)chloride complex of the ligand having A= benzyl and m=n=0; and a Ni(II)bromide complex of the ligand having A=H and m=n=l. In some instances halide in these complexes is a ligand, and in other instances it is present as an anion. This handful of complexes appears to be the total of those known wherein the cross-bridging is not across "adjacent" nitrogens.<br>
Ramasubbu and Wainwright, Chem. Soc.. Chem. Commun.. (1982), 277-278 in contrast describe structurally reinforcing cyclen by bridging adjacent nitrogen donors. Ni(II) forms a pale yellow mononuclear diperchlorate complex having one mole of the ligand in a square planar configuration. Kojima et al, Chemistry Letters, (1996), pp, 153-154, describes assertedly novel optically active dinuclear Cu(II) complexes of a structurally reinforced tricyclic macrocycle.<br>
Bridging alkylation of saturated polyaza macrocycles as a means for imparting structural rigidity is described by Wainwright, Inorg. Chem.. (1980), 12(5), 1396-8. Mali, Wade and Hancock describe a cobalt (III) complex of a structurally reinforced macrocycle, see J. Chem, Soc.. Dalton Trans.. (1992), (1), 67-71. Seki et al describe the synthesis and structure of chiral dinuclear copper(H) complexes of an assertedly novel reinforced hexaazamacrocyclic ligand; see MoL Cryst. Liq. Crvst. Sci. Techno!.. Sect. A (1996), 226, 79-84; see also related work by the same authors in the same Journal at 276. 85-90 and 278. 235-240.<br>

(1996), 353-362. Important earlier work by Wieghardt and co-workers on 1,4.7-triazacyclononane transition metal complexes, including those of Manganese, is described in Angew. Chem. Intemat. Ed.

(1984), 1357-1362 describe synthesis and characterization of the macrocycle 1,7-dimethyl-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane and of certain of its Cu(II) and Ni(II) complexes including both a square-planar Ni complex and a cis-octahedral complex with the macrocycle co-ordinated in a folded configuration to four sites around the central nickel atom. Hancock et al, Inorg. Chem., (1990), 22, 1968-1974 describe ligand design approaches for complexation in aqueous solution, including chelate ring size as a basis for control of size-based selectivity for metal ions.

Costa and Delgado, Inorg. Chem.. (1993), 22, 5257-5265, describe metal complexes such as the Co(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) complexes, of macrocyclic complexes containing pyridine, Derivatives of the cross-bridged cyclens, such as salts of 4,10-dimethyl-l,4,7,10-tetraazabicyclo[5.5.2]tetradecane, are described by Bencini et al., see Supramolecular Chemistry, 3^, 141-146. U.S. 5,428,180 and .related work by Cynthia Burrows and co-workers in U.S. 5,272,056 and U.S. 5,504,075 describe pH dependence of oxidations using cyclam or its derivatives, oxidations of alkenes to epoxides using metal complexes of such derivatives, and pharmaceutical applications, Hancock et al., Inorganica Chimica Acta.. (1989), J64f 73-84 describe under a title including "complexes of structurally reinforced tetraaza-macrocyclic ligands of high ligand field strength" the synthesis of complexes of low-spin Ni(II) with three assertedly novel bicyclic macrocycles. The complexes apparently involve nearly coplanar arrangements of the four donor atoms and the metals despite the presence of the bicyclic ligand arrangement, Bencini et al., L Chem. Soc^ Chem.

Rey., (1989), 89, 1875-1914 review ligand design for selective complcxaiion of metal ions in aqueous solution. Conformers of cyclam complexes are discussed on page 1894 including a folded conformer -see Fig, 18 (cis-V). The paper includes a glossary.

Selectivity for Metal Ions on the Basis of the Match and Size Between the Metal Ion and the Macrocyclic Cavity", Hancock et al., J. C.hem. Soc,. Chem. Common.r (1987), 1129-1130 describe formation constants for Cu(II), Ni(II) and other metal complexes of some bridged macrocycles having piperazine-like structure,<br>
Many other macrocycles are described in the art, including types with pedant groups and a wide range of intracyclic and exocyclic substituents. Although the macrocycle and transition metal complex literature are, separately, vast, relatively little appears to have been reported on how to select and combine specific transition metals and specific macrocycle classes, for example cross-bridged tetraaza- and penta-aza macrocycles, so as to apply them for the further improvement of oxidation catalysis. There is, for example, no apparent singling out of these materials from the vast chemical literature, either alone or as their transition metal complexes, for use in bleaching detergents.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Catalytic Systems for Oxidizing Materials:<br>
The catalytic systems of the present invention comprise a particularly selected transition-metal oxidation catalyst which is a complex of a transition metal and a macropdlycyclic rigid ligand, preferably one which is cross-bridged; the catalytic systems preferably also comprise an oxidation agent or "primary oxidant", preferably one which is a low cost, readily available substance producing little or no waste, such as a source of hydrogen peroxide. The source of hydrogen peroxide can be H2O2 itself, its solutions, or any common hydrogen-peroxide releasing salt,<br>
adduct or precursor, such as sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, or mixtures thereof. Also useful are other sources of available oxygen such as persulfate (e.g., OXONE, manufactured by DuPont), as well as preformed organic peracids and other organic peroxides. More generally, chlorine or other oxidants such as C1O2 or<br>
NaOCl can be used,<br>
Mixtures of primary oxidants can be used; in such mixtures, an oxidant which is not present in major proportion can be used, for example as in mixtures of a major proportion of hydrogen peroxide and a minor proportion of peracetic acid or its salts. In this example, the peracetic acid is termed the "secondary oxidant". Secondary oxidants can be selected from the same list of oxidants given hereinafter; the use of secondary oxidants is optional but may be highly desirable in certain embodiments of the invention. The catalytic system often further comprises further adjuncts, including compounds which liberate oxidant as a result of in-situ chemical reaction; as well as solvents and oihcr additives characteristic of the end-use of the catalytic system. To secure the benefits of the invention, a substrate material, such as a chemical compound to be oxidized, or j commercial mixture of materials such as a paper pulp, or a soiled material such as level containing one or more materials or soils to be oxidized, is added to the catalytic system under widely ranging conditions further described hereinafter.<br>
The catalytic systems herein are useful for oxidative synthetic chemistry processes, such as oxidation of organic functional groups, hydrocarbons, heteroatoms, and epoxidation (including enantiomeric) of alkenes and enynes, oxidation of sulfides to sulfones, and the like.<br>
The present invention catalytic systems also have utility in the area of oxidizing (preferably including bleaching) wood pulp for use in, for example, paper making processes. Other utilities include oxidative destruction of waste materials or effluents.<br>
Effective Amounts of Catalyst Materials<br>
The term "catalytically effective amount", as used herein, refers to an amount of the transition-metal oxidation catalyst present in the present invention catalytic systems, or during use according to the present invention methods, -that is sufficient, under whatever comparative or use conditions are employed, to result in at least partial oxidation of the material sought to be oxidized by the catalytic systems or method. For example, in the synthesis of epoxides from alkenes, the catalytic amount is that amount which is sufficient to catalyze the desired epoxidation reaction. As noted, the invention encompasses catalytic systems both at their in-use levels and at the levels which may commercially be provided for sale as "concentrates"; thus "catalytic systems" herein include both those in which the catalyst is highly dilute and ready to use, for example at ppb levels, and compositions having rather higher concentrations of catalyst and adjunct materials. Intermediate level compositions, as noted in summary, can include those comprising from about 0.01 ppm to about 500 ppm, more preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 50 ppm, more preferably still from about 0.1 ppm to about 10 ppm of transition-metal catalyst and the balance to 100%, typically about 99% or more, being solid-form or liquid-form adjunct materials (for example fillers, solvents, and adjuncts especially adapted to a particular use, such as papermaking adjuncts, detergent adjuncts, or the like). In terms of amounts of materials, the invention also encompasses a large number of novel transition-metal catalysts per-se, especially including their substantially pure (100% active) forms. Other amounts, for example of oxidant materials and other adjuncts for specialized uses, are illustrated in more detail hereinafter.<br><br>
Transition-Metal Oxidation Catalysts:<br>
The present invention catalytic systems comprise a transition-metal oxidation catalyst. In general, the catalyst contains an at least partially covalently bonded transition metal, and bonded thereto at least one particularly defined macropolycyclic rigid ligand, preferably one having four or more donor atoms and<br>
which is cross-bridged or otherwise tied so that the primary macrocycle ring complexes in a folded conformation about the metal. Catalysts herein are thus neither of the more conventional macrocyclic type: eg., porphyrin complexes, in which the metal can readily adopt square-planar configuration; nor are they complexes in which the metal is fully encrypted in a ligand. Rather, the presently useful catalysts represent a selection of all the many complexes, hitherto largely unrecognized, which have an intermediate state in which the metal is bound in a "cleft". Further, there can be present in the catalyst one or more additional Ugandsi of generally conventional type such as chloride covalently bound to the metal; and, if needed, one or more counter-ions, most commonly anions such as chloride, hexafluorophosphate, perchlorate or the like; and additional molecules to complete crystal formation as needed, such as water of crystallization. Only the transition-metal and macropolycyclic rigid ligand are, in general, essential.<br>

Preferred complexes useful as transition-metal oxidation catalysts more generally include not only monometallic, mononuclear kinds such as those illustrated hereinabove but' also bimetallic, trimetallic or cluster kinds, especially when the polymetallic kinds transform chemically in the presence of a primary oxidant to form a mononuclear, monometallic active species. Monometallic, mononuclear complexes are preferred. As defined herein, a monometallic transition-metal oxidation catalyst contains only one transition metal atom per mole of complex. A monometallic, mononuclear complex is one in which any donor atoms of the essential macrocyclic ligand are bonded to the same transition metal atom, that is, the essential ligand does not "bridge" across two or more transition-metal atoms, Transition Metals of the Catalyst<br>
Just as the macropolycyclic ligand cannot vary indeterminately for the present useful purposes, nor can the meial. An important part of the invention is to arrive at a match between ligand selection and metal selection which results in excellent oxidation catalysis. In genera), transition-metal oxidation catalysts herein comprise a transition metal selected from the group consisting of Mn(II), Mn(III), Mn(IV), Mn(V), Fe(II), Fe(III), Fe(IV). (Axl). Co(II), Co(III), Ni(I), Ni(II), Ni(III), Cu(I), Cu(II), Cu(III), Cr(II), Cr(III). C'rtl(V). Cr(V), Cr(VI), V(Ill), V(IV), V(V), Mo(IV), Mo(V), Mo(VI), W(IV), \V
Mn(II) complexes are rather rare in all of coordination chemistry. The designation (II) or (III) denotes a coordinated transition metal having the requisite oxidation state; the coordinated metal atom is not a free ion or one having only water as a ligand.<br>
Ligands<br>
In general, as used herein, a "ligand" is any moiety capable of direct covalent bonding to a metal ion. Ligands can be charged or neutral and may range widely, including simple monovalent donors, such as chloride, or simple amines which form a single coordinate bond and a single point of attachment to a metal; to oxygen or ethylene, which can form a three-membered ring with a metal and thus can be said to have two potential points of attachment, to larger moieties such as ethylenediamine or aza macrocycles, which form up to the maximum number of single bonds to one or more metals that are allowed by the available sites on the metal and the number of lone pairs or alternate bonding sites of the free ligand. Numerous ligands can form bonds other than simple donor bonds, and can have multiple points of attachment.<br>
Ligands useful herein can fall into several groups: the essential macropolycyclic rigid ligand, preferably a cross-bridged macropolycycle (preferably there will be one such ligand in a useful transition-metal complex, but more, for example two, can be present, but not in preferred mononuclear complexes); other, optional ligands, which in general are different from the essential cross-bridged macropolycycle (generally there will be from 0 to 4, preferably from 1 to 3 such ligands); and ligands associated transiently with the metal as part of the catalytic cycle, these latter typically being' related to water, hydroxide, oxygen, water, hydroxide, or peroxides. Ligands of the third group are not essential for defining the metal oxidation catalyst, which is a stable, isolable chemical compound that can be fully characterized. Ligands which bind to metals through donor atoms each having at least a single lone pair of electrons available for donation to a metal have a donor capability, or potential denticity. at least equal to the number of donor atoms. In general, that donor capability may be fully or only partially exercised.<br>
MacroPolycyclic Rigid Ligands<br>
To arrive at the instant transiiion-metal catalysts, a macropolycyclic rigid ligand is essential. This is coordinated (covalently connected to any of the above-<br>
's<br>
identified transition-metals) by at least three, preferably at least four, and most preferably four or five, donor atoms to ihe same transition metal.<br>
Generally, the macropolycyclic rigid ligands herein can be viewed as the result of imposing additional structural rigidity on specifically selected "parent macrocycles". The term "rigid" herein has been defined as the constrained converse.<br>
of flexibility: see D.H. Busch., Chemical Reviews.. (1993), 93, 847-860, incorporated by reference. More particularly, "rigid"' as used herein means that the essential ligand, to be suitable for the purposes of the invention, must be deternu'nably more rigid than a macrocycle ("parent macrocycle") which 'is otherwise identical (having the same ring size and type and number of atoms in the main ring) but lacks the superstructure (especially linking moieties or, preferably cross-bridging moieties) of the present ligands. In determining the comparative<br>
•<br>
rigidity of the macrocycles with and without superstructures, the practitioner will vise the free form (not the metal-bound form) of the macrocycles. Rigidity is well* known to be useful in comparing macrocycles; suitable tools for determining, measuring or comparing rigidity include computational methods (see, for example, Zimmer, Chemical Reviews. (1995), 95(38), 2629-2648 or Hancock et al., Inorganica Chimica Acta. (1989), 164, 73-84. A determination of whether one macrocycle is more rigid than another can be often made by simply making a molecular model, thus it is not in general essential to know configurational energies in absolute terms or to precisely compute them. Excellent comparative determinations of rigidity of one macrocycle vs. another can be made using inexpensive personal computer-based computational tools, such as ALCHEMY III, commercially available from Tripos Associates. Tripos also has available more expensive software permitting not only comparative, but absolute determinations; alternately, SHAPES can be used (see Zimmer cited supra). One observation which is significant in the context of the present invention is that there is an optimum for the present purposes when the parent macrocycle is distinctly flexible as compared to the cross-bridged form. Thus, unexpectedly, it is preferred to use parent macrocycles containing at least four donor atoms, such as cyclam derivatives, and to cross-bridge them, rather than to start with a more rigid parent macrocycle. Another observation is that cross-bridged macrocycles are significantly preferred over macrocycles which are bridged in other manners.<br>
The macrocyclic rigid ligands herein are of course not limited to being synthesized from any preformed macrocycle plus preformed "rigidizing" or "conformation-modifying" element: rather, a wide variety of synthetic means, such as template syntheses, are useful See for example Busch et al., reviewed in "Heterocyclic compounds: Aza-crown macrocycles", j.S. Bradshaw et. al., referred to in the Background Section hereinbefore, for synthetic methods.<br>
In one aspect of the present invention, the macropolycyclic rigid ligands herein include those comprising:<br><br>
(i) an organic macrocycle ring containing three, preferably four, or more donor atoms (preferably at least 3, more preferably at least 4, of these donor atoms are N) separated from each other by covaient linkages of at least one, preferably 2 or 3, non-donor atoms, two to five (preferably three to four, more preferably four) of these donor atoms being coordinated to th« same transition metal in the complex; and (ii) a linking moiety, preferably a cross-bridging chain, which covalently connects at least 2 (preferably non-adjacent) donor atoms of the organic macrocycle ring, said covalently connected (preferably non-adjacent) donor atoms being bridgehead donor atoms which are coordinated to the same transition metal in the complex, and wherein said linking moiety (preferably a cross-bridged chain) comprises from 2 to about 10 atoms (preferably the cross-bridged chain is selected from 2, 3 or 4 non-donor atoms, and 4-6 non-donor atoms with a further donor atom).<br>
While clear from the various contexts and illustrations already presented, the practitioner may further benefit if certain terms receive additional definition and illustration. As used herein, "macrocyclic rings" are covalently connected rings formed from three or more, preferably four or more, donor atoms (i.e., heteroatoms such as nitrogen or oxygen) with carbon chains connecting them, and any macrocycle ring as defined herein must contain a total of at least ten, preferably at least twelve, atoms in the macrocycle ring. A macropolycycltc rigid ligand herein may contain more than one ring of any sort per ligand, but at least one macrocycle ring must be identifiable. Moreover, in the preferred embodiments, no two hetero-1 atoms are directly connected. Preferred transition-metal oxidation catalysts are those wherein the macropolycyclic rigid ligand comprises an organic macrocycle ring (main ring) containing at least 10-20 atoms, preferably 12-18 atoms, more preferably from about 12 to about 20 atoms, most preferably 12 to 16 atoms.<br>
"Donor atoms" herein are heteroatoms such as nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus or sulfur, which when incorporated into a ligand still have at least one lone pair of electrons available for forming a donor-acceptor bond with a metal. Preferred transition-metal oxidation catalyst are those wherein the donor atoms in the organic macrocycle ring of the cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligand are selected from the group consisting of N, O, S, and P, preferably N and 0, and most preferably all N. Also preferred are cross-bridged macropolvcyclic ligands comprising 4 or 5 donor atoms, all of which are coordinated to ihe same transition metal. Most preferred transition-metal oxidation catalysts arc those wherein the cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligand comprises 4 nitrogen donor atoms all coordinated to the same transition metal, and those wherein the cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligand comprises 5 nitrogen atoms all coordinaicd to ihe same transition metal.<br>
"Non-donor atoms" of the macropolycyclic rigid ligand herein are most commonly carbon, though a number of atom types can be included, especially in optional exocyclic substituents (such as "pendant" moieties, illustrated hereinafter) of the macrocycles, which are neither donor atoms for purposes essential to form the metal catalysts, nor are they carbon. Thus, in the broadest sense, the term "non-donor atoms" can refer to any atom not essential to forming donor bonds with the metal of the catalyst. Examples of such atoms could include heteroatoms such as sulfur as incorporated in a non-coordinatable sulfonate group, phosphorus as incorporated into a phosphonium salt moiety, phosphorus as incorporated into a P(V) oxide, a non-transition metal, or the like. In certain preferred embodiments, all non-donor atoms are carbon.<br>
The term "macropolycyclic ligand" is used herein to refer to the essential ligand required for forming the essential metal catalyst. As indicated by the term, such a ligand is both a macrocycle and is polycyclic. "Polycyclic" means at least bicyclic in the conventional sense. The essential macropolycyclic ligands must be rigid, and preferred ligands must also cross-bridged.<br>
Non-limiting examples of macropolycyclic rigid ligands, as defined herein,<br>
include 1.3-1.7:<br><br>
(FigureRemoved)<br>
Ligand 1.3 is a macropolycylic rigid ligand in accordance with the invention which is a highly preferred, cross-bridged, methyl-substituted (all nitrogen atoms tertiary) derivative of cyclam. Formally, this ligand is named 5,12-dimethyl-l,5,8,12-tetraazabicyclo[6.6.2]hexadecane using the extended von Baeyer system. See '*A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds: Recommendations 1993", R. Panico, W.H, Powell and J-C Richer (Eds,), Blackwell Scientific Publications, Boston, 1993; see especially section R-2.4.2.1, According to conventional terminology. Nl and N8 are "bridgehead atoms"; as defined herein, more particularly "bridgehead donor atoms" since they have lone pairs capable of donation to a metal. N't is connected to two non-bridgehead donor atoms, N5 and N12, by distinct saturated carbon chains 2,3,4 and 14,13 and<br>
to bridgehead donor atom N8 by a "linking moiety" a,b which here is a saturated carbon chain of two carbon atoms. N8 is connected to two non-bridgehead donor atoms, N5 and N12, by distinct chains 6,7 and 9,10,11. Chain a,b is a "linking moiety" as defined herein, and is of the special, preferred type referred to as a "cross-bridging" moiety. The "macrocyclic ring" of the ligand supra, or "main ring" (IUPAC), includes all four donor atoms and chains 2,3,4; 6,7; 9,10,11 and 13,14 but .not a,b, This ligand is conventionally bicyclic. The short bridge or "linking moiety" a,b is a "cross-bridge" as defined herein, with a,b bisecting the macrocyclic ring.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Ligand 1.4 lies within the general definition of macropolycyclic rigid ligands as defined herein, but is not a preferred ligand since it is not "cross-bridged" as defined herein. Specifically, the "linking moiety" a,b connects "adjacent" donor atoms Nl and N12, which is outside the preferred embodiment of the present invention: see for comparison the preceding macrocyclic rigid ligand, in which the linking moiety a,b is a cross-bridging moiety and connects "non-adjacent" donor atoms.<br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Ligand 1.5 lies within the general definition of macropolycyclic rigid ligands as defined herein, but is not a preferred ligind since it contains only three donor atoms, all of which are bridgehead donor atoms.<br>
(Figure  Removed)<br><br><br>
Ligand 1.6 lies within the general definition of macropolycylic rigid ligands as defined herein. This ligand can be viewed as a "main ring" which is a tetraazamacrocycle having three bridgehead donor atoms. This macrocycle is bridged by a "linking moiety" having a structure more complex than a simple chain, containing as it does a secondary ring. The linking moiety includes both a "cross-bridging" mode of bonding, and a non-cross-bridging mode.<br><br><br><br>
(Figure  Removed)<br>
Ligand 1.7 lies within the general definition of macropolycylic rigid ligands, Five donor atoms are present; two being bridgehead donor atoms. This ligand is a preferred cross-bridged ligand. It contains no exocyclic or pendant substituents which have aromatic content.<br>
In contrast, for purposes of comparison, the following ligands (1.8 and 1.9) conform neither with the broad definition of macropolycyclic rigid ligands in the present invention, nor with the preferred cross-bridged sub-family thereof and therefore are completely outside the present invention<br><br>
(Figure  Removed)<br><br><br>
In the ligand supra, neither nitrogen atom is a bridgehead donor atom.  There arc insufficient donor atoms.<br>
(Figure  Removed)<br><br><br>
The ligand supra is also outside the present invention. The nitrogen atoms are not bridgehead donor atoms, and the two-carbon linkage between the two main rings does not meet the invention definition of a "linking moiety" since, instead of linking across a single macrocycle ring, it links.two different rings. The linkage therefore does not confer rigidity as used in the term "macropolycyclic rigid ligand". See the definition of "linking moiety" hereinafter.<br>
Generally, the essential macropolycyclic rigid ligands (and the corresponding transition-metal catalysts) herein comprise:<br>
(a)	at least one macrocycle main ring comprising three or more heteroatoms; and<br>
(b)	a covalently connected non-metal superstructure capable of increasing the<br>
rigidity of the macrocycle, preferably selected from<br>
(i) a bridging superstructure, such as a linking moiety;<br>
(ii) a cross-bridging superstructure, such as a cross-bridging linking moiety; and<br>
(iii) combinations thereof.<br>
The term "superstructure" is used herein as defined by Busch et al., in the Chemical Reviews article incorporated hereinabove.<br>
Preferred superstructures herein not only enhance the rigidity of the parent macrocycle, but also favor folding of the macrocycle so that it co-ordinates to a metal in a cleft. Suitable superstructures can be remarkably simple, for example a linking moiety such as any of those illustrated in 1.10 and 1.11 below, can be used.<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br>
wherein n is an integer, for example from 2 to 8, preferably less than 6, typically 2 to 4, or<br>
(Formula  Removed)<br><br>
wherein m and n are integers from about I to 8, more preferably from 1 to 3; Z is N or CH; and T is a compatible substituent, for example H, alkyl, trialkylamrnoniurn, halogen, nitro, sulfonate, or the like. The aromatic ring in 1.11 can be replaced by a saturated ring, in which the atom in Z connecting into the ring can contain N, 0, S or C.<br>
Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the preorganization built into the macropolycyclic ligands herein that leads to extra kinetic and/or thermodynamic stability of their metal complexes arises from either or both of topological constraints and enhanced rigidity (loss of flexibility) compared to the free parent macrocycle which has no superstructure, The macropolycyclic rigid ligands as defined herein and their preferred cross-bridged sub-family, which can be said to be "ultra-rigid", combine two sources of fixed preorganization. In preferred ligands herein, the linking moieties and parent macrocycle rings are combined to form ligands which have a significant extent of "fold", typically greater than in many known superstructured ligands in which a superstructure is attached to a largely planar, often unsarurated macrocycle. See, for example, : D.H. Busch, Chemical Reviews. (1993), 22, 847 - 880. Further, the preferred ligands herein have a number of particular properties, including (1) they are characterized by very high proton affinities, as in so-called "proton sponges"; (2) they tend to react slowly with multivalent transition metals, which when combined with (1) above, renders synthesis of their complexes with certain hydrolyzable metal ions difficult in hydroxylic solvents; (3) when they are coordinated to transition metal atoms as identified herein, the ligands result in complexes that have exceptional kinetic stability such that the metal ions only dissociate extremely slowly under conditions<br><br>
that would destroy complexes with ordinary ligands; and (4) these complexes have exceptional thermodynamic stabiliiy; however, the unusual kinetics of ligand dissociation from the transition- metal may defeat conventional equilibrium measurements that might quantitate this property.<br>
Other usable but more complex superstructures suitable for the present invention purposes include those containing on additional ring, such as in 1.6. Other bridging superstructures when added to a macrocycle include, for example, 1.4, Incontrast* cross-bridging superstructures unexpectedly produce a substantial improvement in the utility of a macrocyclic ligand for use in oxidation catalysis: a preferred cross-bridging superstructure is 1.3. A superstructure illustrative of a bridging plus cross-bridging combination is 1.12:<br><br>
(Figure  Removed)<br>
In 1.12, linking moiety (i) is cross-bridging, while linking moiety (ii) is not. 1.12 is less preferred than 1.3.<br>
More generally, a "linking moiety", as defined herein, is a covalently linked moiety comprising a plurality of atoms which has at least two points of covalent attachment to a macrocycle ring and which does not form part of the main ring or rings of the parent macrocycle. In other terms, with the exception of the bonds formed by attaching it to the parent macrocycle, a linking moiety is wholly in a superstructure.<br>
The terms "cross-bridged" or "cross-bridging", as used herein, refers to covalent ligation, bisection or "tying" of a macrocycle ring in which two donor atoms of the macrocycle ring are covalently connected by a linking moiety, for example an additional chain distinct from the macrocycle ring, and further, preferably, in which there is at least one donor atom of the macrocycle ring in each of the sections of the macrocycle ring separated by the ligation, bisection or tying. Cross-bridging is not present in structure 1.4 hereinabove; it is present in 1.3, where two donor atoms of a preferred macrocycle ring are connected in such manner that there is not a donor atom in each of ihe bisection rings. Of course, provided that cross-bridging is present, any other kind of bridging can optionally be added and the bridged macrocycle will retain the preferred property of being "cross-bridged": see Structure 1.12. A "cross-bridged chain" or "cross-bridging chain", as defined herein, is thus a highly preferred type of linking moiety comprising a plurality of atoms which has at least two points of covalcnt attachment to a macrocycle ring and which does not form part of the original macroocle ring (main ring), and further, which is connected to the main ring using the rule identified in defining the term "cross-bridging",<br>
The term "adjacent" as used herein in connection with donor atoms in a macrocycle ring means that there are no donor atoms intervening between a first donor atom and another donor atom within the macrocycle ring; all intervening atoms in the ring are non-donor atoms, typically they are carbon atoms. The complementary term "non-adjacent" as used herein in connection with donor atoms in a macrocycle ring means that there is at least one donor atom intervening between a first donor atom and another that is being referred to, In preferred cases such as a cross-bridged tetraazamacrocycle, there will be at least a pair of non-adjacent donor atoms which are bridgehead atoms, and a further pair of non-bridgehead donor atoms.<br>
"Bridgehead" atoms herein are atoms of a macropolycyclic ligand which are connected into the structure of the macrocycle in such manner that each non-donor bond to such an atom is a covalent single bond and there are sufficient covalent single bonds to connect the atom termed "bridgehead" such that it forms a junction of at least two rings, this number being the maximum observable by visual inspection in the un-coordinated ligand.<br><br>
In general, the metal oxidation catalysts herein may contain bridgehead atoms which are carbon, however, and importantly, in certain preferred embodiments, all essential bridgehead atoms are heteroatoms, all heteroatoms are tertiary, and further, they each co-ordinate through lone pair donation to the metal. Thus, bridgehead atoms are junction points not only of rings in the macrocycle, but also of chelate rings.<br>
The term "a further donor alom" unless otherwise specifically indicated, as used herein, refers to a donor atom other than a donor atom contained in the macrocycle ring of an essential macropolycycle. For example, a "further donor atom" may be present in an optional exocyclic substituent of a macrocyclic ligand , or in a cross-bridged chain thereof. In certain preferred embodiments, a "further donor atom" is present only in a cross-bridged chain.<br>
The term "coordinated with the same transition metal" as used herein is used to emphasize that a particular donor atom or ligand does not bind to two or more distinct metal atoms, but rather, to only one.<br>
Optional Ligands<br>
It is to be recognized for the iramition-meial oxidation catalysts useful in the present invention catalytic systems thai welmonal non-macropotycyclic ligands may optionally also be coordinated 10 ihc metal, as necessary to complete the coordination number of the metal complcxed. Such ligands may have any number<br><br>
of atoms capable of donating electrons to the catalyst complex, but preferred<br>
optional ligands have a denticity of 1 to 3, preferably 1. Examples of such ligands are H2O, ROH, NR3, RCN, OH-, OOH-, RS-, RO -, RCOO -, OCN -, SCN-, N3-, CN-, F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, 02-, NO3-, NO2-, SO42-, SO}2-, P043-, organic phosphates, organic phosphonates, organic sulfates, organic sulfonates, and aromatic N donors such as pyridines, pyrazines, pyrazoles, imidazoles, benzimidazoles, pyrimidines, triazoles and thiazoles with R being H, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted aryl. Preferred transition-metal oxidation catalysts comprise one or two non-macropolycydic ligands.<br>
the term "non-macropolycyclic ligands" is used herein to refer to ligands such as those illustrated immediately hereinabove which in general are not essential for forming the metal catalyst, and are not cross-bridged macropolycycles. "Not essential", with reference to such non-macropolycyclic ligands means that, in the invention as broadly defined, they can be substituted by a variety of common alternate ligands. In highly preferred embodiments in which metal, macropolycyclic and non-macropolycyclic ligands are finely tuned into a transition-metal oxidation catalyst, there may of course be significant differences in performance when the indicated non-macropolycyclic ligand(s) are replaced by further, especially non-illustrated, alternative ligands.<br>
The term "metal catalyst" or "transition-metal oxidation catalyst" is used herein to refer to the essential catalyst compound of the invention and is commonly used with the "metal" qualifier unless absolutely clear from the context. Note that there is a disclosure hereinafter pertaining specifically to optional catalyst materials. Therein the term "bleach catalyst" may be used unqualified to refer to optional, organic (metal-free) catalyst materials, or to optional metal-containing catalysts that lack the advantages of the essential catalyst: such optional materials, for example. include known metal porphyrins or metal-containing photobleach.es. Other optional catalytic materials herein include enzymes.<br>

Tetradentate and pentadentate cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligands are most preferred.<br>
Unless otherwise specified, the convention herein when referring to denticity, as in "the macropolycycle has a denticity of four" will be to refer to a characteristic of the ligand: namely, the maximum number of donor bonds that it is capable of forming when it coordinates to a metal. Such a ligand is identified as "tetradentate". Similarly, a macropolycycle containing five nitrogen atoms each with a lone pair is referred to as "pentadentate". The present invention encompasses catalytic systems in which the macrocyclic rigid ligand exerts its full denticity, as stated, in the transition-metal catalyst complexes; moreover, the invention also encompasses any equivalents which can be formed, for example, if one or more donor sites are not directly coordinated to the metal. This can happen, for example, when a pentadentate ligand coordinates through four donor atoms to the transition metal and one donor atom is protonated.<br>

Also preferred are catalysts wherein the molar ratio of transition metal to macropolycyclic ligand in the oxidation catalyst is 1;1, and more preferably wherein the catalyst comprises only one metal per oxidation catalyst complex. Further preferred transition-metal oxidation catalysts are monometallic, mononuclear complexes.

Preferred transition-metal oxidation catalysts also include those wherein at least four of the donor atoms in the macropolycyclic rigid ligand, preferably at least four nitrogen donor atoms, two of which form an apical bond angle with the same transition metal of 180±50° and two of which form at least one equatorial bond angle of 90±20°. Such catalysts preferably have four or five nitrogen donor atoms in total and also have coordination geometry selected from distorted octahedral (including trigonal antiprismatic and general tetragonal distortion) and distorted trigonal prismatic, and preferably wherein further the cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligand is in the folded conformation (as described, for example, in Hancock and Martell, Chem. Rev., 1989, 89, at page 1894). A folded conformation of a cross-bridged macropolycyclic ligand in a transition-metal complex is further illustrated below;<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
This catalyst is the complex of Example 1 hereinafter. The center atom is Mn; the two ligands to the right are chloride; and a Bcyclam ligand occupies the left side of the distorted octahedral structure. The complex contains an angle N-Mn-N of 158° incorporating the two mutually trans- donor atoms in "axial" positions; the corresponding angle N-Mn-N for the nitrogen donor atoms in plane with the two chloride ligands is 83.2°,<br>
Stated alternately, the preferred synthetic, laundry, cleaning, papermaking, or effluent-treating catalytic systems herein contain transition-metal complexes of a macropolycyclic ligand in which there is a major energetic preference of the ligand for a folded, as distinct from an "open" and/or "planar" and or "flat" conformation. For comparison, a disfavored conformation is, for example, either of the trans-structures shown in Hancock and Martell, Chemical Reviews, (1989), 89. at page 1894 (see Figure 18), incorporated by reference.<br>
In light of the foregoing coordination description, the present invention includes oxidation catalytic systems comprising a transition-metal oxidation catalyst, especially based on Mn(II) or Mn(III) or correspondingly, Fe(II) or Fe(III) or Cr(II) or Cr(III), wherein two of the donor atoms in the macropolycyclic rigid ligand, preferably two nitrogen donor atoms, occupy mutually trans- positions of the coordination geometry, and at least two of the donor atoms in the macropolycyclic rigid ligand, preferably at least two nitrogen donor atoms, occupy cis- equatorial positions of the coordination geometry, including particularly the cases in which there is substantial distortion as illustrated hereinabove.<br>
The present catalytic systems can. furthermore, include transition metal oxidation catalysts in which the number of asymmetric sites can vary widely; thus both S- and R- absolute conformations can be included for any stereochemically active site. Other types of isomensm. such as geometric isomerism, are also included. The transition-metal oxidation catalyst can further include mixtures of geometric or stereoisomers.<br>
Purificatio<br>
In general, the state of purity of the transition-metal oxidation catalyst can vary, provided that any impurities, such as byproducts of the synthesis, free ligand(s), unreacted transition-metal salt precursors, colloidal organic or inorganic particles, and the like, are not present in amounts which substantially decrease the utility of the transition-metal oxidation catalyst. It has been discovered that preferred embodiments of the present invention include those in which the transition-metal oxidation catalyst is purified by any suitable means, such that it does not excessively consume available oxygen (AvO). Excessive AvO consumption is defined as including any instance of exponential decrease in AvO levels of bleaching, oxidizing or catalyzing solutions with time at 20-40 deg. C. Preferred transition-metal oxidation catalysts herein, whether purified or not, when placed into dilute aqueous buffered alkaline solution at a pH of about 9 (carbonate/bicarbonate buffer) at temperatures of about 40 deg. C., have a relatively steady decrease in AvO levels with time; in preferred cases, this rate of decrease is linear or approximately linear. In the preferred embodiments, there is a rate of AvO consumption at 40 deg C given by a slope of a graph of %AvO vs. time (in sec.) (hereinafter "AvO slope") of from about -0.0050 to about -0.0500, more preferably -0.0100 to about -0.0200. Thus, a preferred Mn(II) oxidation catalyst in accordance with the invention has an AvO slope of from about -0.0 140 to about -0.0182; in contrast, a somewhat less preferred transition metal oxidation catalyst has an AvO slope of -0,0286.<br>
Preferred methods for determining AvO consumption in aqueous solutions of transition metaJ oxidation catalysis herein include the well-known iodometric method or its variants, such as methods commonly applied for hydrogen peroxide. See, for example, Organic Peroxides, Vol. 2., D. Swem (Ed.,), Wiley-Interscience, New York, 1971, for example the table at p. 585 and references therein including P.O. Bartlett and R. Altscul, J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 67, 812 (1945) and W.E. Cass, J. Amer. Chem. Soc.j 68, 1976 (1946). Accelerators such as ammonium molybdate can be used. The general procedure used herein is to prepare an aqueous solution of catalyst and hydrogen peroxide in a mild alkaline buffer, for example carbonate/bicarbonate at pH 9, and lo monitor the consumption of hydrogen peroxide by periodic removal of aliquots of the solution which are "stopped" from<br>
x<br>
further loss of hydrogen peroxide by acidification using glacial acetic acid, preferably with chilling (ice). These aliquots can then be analyzed by reaction with potassium iodide, optionally but sometimes preferably using ammonium molybdate (especially low-impurity molybdate, sec for example U.S. 4,596,701) to accelerate complete reaction, followed by back-iiiraiation using sodium thiosulfate. Other<br><br>
variations of analytical procedure can be used, such as thermometric procedures, potential buffer methods (Ishibashi et al., Anal Chim. Acta (1992), 261(1-2), 405-10) or photometric procedures for determination of hydrogen peroxide (EP 485,000 A2, May 13, 1992). Variations of methods permitting fractional determinations, for example of peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, in presence or absence of the instant transition-metal oxidation catalysts are also useful; see, for example JP 92-<br>
303215, Oct. 16,1992,<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, there are encompassed laundry and cleaning compositions incorporating transition-metal oxidation catalysts which have been purified to the extent of having a differential AvO  loss reduction , relative to the untreated catalyst, of at least about 10 % (units here are dimensionless since they represent the ratio of the AvO  slope of the treated transition-metal oxidation catalyst over the AvO slope for me untreated transition metal oxidation catalyst - effectively a ratio of AvO's). In other terms, the AvO slope is improved by purification so as to bring it into the above-identified preferred ranges.<br>
m yet another embodiment of the instant invention, two processes have been identified which are particularly effective in improving the suitability of transition-metal oxidation catalysts, as synthesized, for incorporation into laundry and cleaning products or for other useful oxidation catalysis applications. One such process is any process having a step of treating the transition-metal oxidation catalyst, as prepared, by extracting the transition-metal oxidation catalyst, in solid form, with an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent; suitable solvents are oxidation-stable under conditions of use and include benzene and toluene, preferably toluene. Surprisingly, toluene extraction can measurably improve the AvO slope (see disclosure hereinabove),<br>
Another process which can be used to improve the AvO slope of the transition metal oxidation catalyst is to tiller a solution thereof using any suitable filtration means for removing small or colloidal particles. Such means include the use of fine-pore filters; centrifiigation: or coagulation of the colloidal solids.<br>
In more detail, a full procedure lor purifying a transition-metal oxidation catalyst herein can include;<br>
(a)	dissolving the transition-mental omdaiion catalyst, as prepared, in hot<br><br>
acetonitrile:<br>
(b)	filtering the resulting solution hoi. c g,. at about 70 deg. C. through glass<br>
mlcrofibers (for example glass microfiber filter paper available from<br>
Whatman);<br><br>
(c)	if desired, filtering the solution of the first filtration through a 0.2 micron<br>
membrane (for example, a 0.2 micron filter commercially available from<br>
Millipore) or centrifuging whereby colloidal particles are removed;<br>
(d)	evaporating the solution of the second filtration to dryness;<br>
(e)	washing the solids of step (d) with toluene, for example five times using<br>
toluene in an amount which is double the volume of the oxidation<br>
catalyst solids;<br>
(f)	dry ing the product of step (e),<br>
Another procedure which can be used, in any convenient combination with aromatic solvent washes and/or removal of fine particles is recrystallization. RecrystalHzation, for example of Mn(II) Bcyclam chloride transition-metal oxidation catalyst, can be done from hot acetonitrile. Recrystallization can have its disadvantages, for example it may on occasion be more costly.<br>
Catalytic Systems and Methods-for Synthetic Oxidation Reactions<br>
Methods and catalytic systems for oxidizing alkenes to epoxides by treating the alkene with a transition-metal complex are known, for example from U.S, 5,428,180 and U.S, 5,077,394. Epoxidations of olefins can also be carried out according to the method of Collman, J. P.; Kodadek, T. J.; Raybuck, S. A.; and Meunier, B., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A (1983), 80, 7039, and which publication is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the present invention, catalytic systems and methods require the presence of the transition-metal oxidation catalysts described herein to effect such oxidative processes.<br>
The catalytic systems for use herein suitably comprise a transition-metal oxidation catalyst as described herein, a primary oxidation agent or primary oxidant, for example monopersulfate or peracetic acid or their salts, and a solvent. A wide range of protic and aprotic solvents can be used, covering a range of dielectric constants. The catalytic systems include solutions comprising at least about 0.00001%, more preferably at least about 0.0001% of transition-metal catalyst, from about 0.0001% to about 10%, by weight of primary oxidation agent, and at least about 5%, more typically at least about 50% of solvent. The amount of substrate (the compound to be oxidized) can vary in a wide range, in terms of proportion by weight to the catalytic system. A suitable range of composition is from 1:10,000 lo about 10,000:1 of catalytic system to substrate by weight, more typically from about 1:1,000 to about 1:1.<br>
Similarly, other oxidation reactions for,synthetic chemical manufacturing processes such as oxidation of sulfidcs 10 sullbnes are carried out according to the present invention utilizing catalytic systems containing oxidation agent, transition-<br><br>
metal catalysts, and proportions of the materials as described herein. Again, it is preferred that such processes use catalytic systems which are solutions of these agents,<br>
Catalytic systems and Methods for Pulp Oxidation<br>
The application of oxidizing agents in a sequence of delignifying and bleaching treatment stages of unbleached chemical paper pulp processes are known, for example U,S, Patent 5,431,781. The present invention catalytic systems and methods further require the presence of the transition-metal oxidation catalysts described herein to effect such oxidative processes.<br>
All types of wood used for the production of chemical pulps are suitable for use in the process of the present invention. In particular, this includes those used for kraft pulps, namely the coniferous woods such as, for example, the species of pines and firs and the deciduous woods such as, for example, yellow pine, beech, oak, eucalyptus and hornbeam.<br>
Catalytic systems useful in pulp and paper treatment can, in general, have a range of composition similar to that described supra for organic synthetic purposes. The substrate in this instance is paper or paper-derived materials having an oxidizable component, such as lignin.<br>
In more detail, transition-metal catalysts herein can be useful in a somewhat similar manner to the substituted porphyrin metal complexes of Dolphin (U.S. 5,077,394), though there can be additional advantages, for example improved flexibility in the control of water-solubility of catalyst as compared with certain porphyrin systems. Thus transition-metal complexes identified herein may be used in the form of catalyst systems including (a) the traasition-metaJ catalyst, (b) primary oxidant, for example peracetate, persulfate or peroxide, and (c) solvent such as water though nonaqueous, especially polar aprotic solvents such as dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, alcohols e.g., methanol, ethanol, chlorinated solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform or the like or combinations of water and such organic solvents having a wide range in dielectric constant may be used, together providing catalytic systems for oxidation applicable to a variety of processes, for example those in which prior art optionally substituted phenyl porphyrins have been indicated as useful, The transition-metal catalysts which are the more water soluble are particularly useful in those processes in which water solubility is desired or required. Such processes include, by way of illustration, the oxidation of alkanes (including cycloalkanes), the oxidation of alkenes (including cycloalkenes), the oxidative conversion of lignin model compounds which are converted by the lignin modifying and degrading fungal<br><br>
enzymes also known as ligninases, the use in the modification or degradation of lignin, and the use in the treating of wood in various forms such as wood chips or pulp to assist in or effect pulping or bleaching.<br>
Particular pulping-related processes of interest for the use of the water<br>
.soluble transition-metal complexes, for example the Mn(II) Bcyclarn complexes, for<br>
assisting in or effecting a modification or degradation of lignin, include processes of<br>
making and oxidatively treating the well-known mechanical pulps such as<br>
thermomechanical pulps and kraft pulps so as to effect bleaching,<br>
The invention also provides transition-metal complexes having reduced water-solubility, such as those in which the macrocycle ligand carries one or more long-chain alkyl pendant substituents, and these may also be used in various commercial applications such as solvent pulping, for example the known organosolv pulping process. Other uses include the decomposition of organic contaminants in waste streams such as the chlorinated organic compounds in El effluent from the kraft pulp chlorine bleaching process.<br>
Of particular interest is the use of the present transition-metal catalysts, including the Fe, Mn (preferred for environmental reasons) and even Ni types as catalysts in the catalytic oxidation of alkanes (including cycloalkanes) for the hydroxylation of the same (or ultimate keto formation) and in the catalytic oxidation of alkenes (including cycloalkenes) to form epoxides (epoxidation). Such hydroxylations and epoxidation are well-known reactions which are commonly carried out in an organic solvent which is redox-inert under the operating conditions, but water containing systems may also be used; hence both the water soluble and water insoluble transition-metal complexes may be used in such processes.<br>
In general, the present transition-metal oxidant catalytic systems may be used over a wide range of reaction temperatures including high temperatures up to 150 deg. C. or even higher, and over a wide range of pH's which may extend from about 1 to 14, more suitably from pH 2 to pH 12; nonetheless, it is particularly desirable to use the catalysts at ambient or near-ambient temperatures where energy economy is desired, and to use mild pH's, which arc desirably safe for material handling. The present catalyst systems have the advantage of being useful under such conditions.<br>
The present invention  includes  use of the  identified  transition-metal<br><br>
oxidation catalyst systems in the oxiJative deiignification of wood-pulp. U.S. 5,552,019, for example, describes such delignification using potyoxometallates. The present catalyst systems, typically comprising (a) the transition-metal catalyst; (b) a primary oxidant such as sodium hypochlorite or, more preferably, potassium monopersulfate triple salt, the latter sold cnmmercially as OXONE by Du Pont and<br>
(c) pH-adjusting adjuncts can be used, especially at pH in the range from about 7.5 to about 9.5, under mild temperature conditions for delignification purposes.<br>
The present invention has numerous alternate embodiments and ramifications. For example, in the laundry detergents and laundry detergent additives field, the invention includes all manner of bleach-containing or bleach additive compositions, including for example, fully-formulated heavy-duty granular detergents containing sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate and/or a preformed peracid derivative such as OXONE as primary oxidant, the transition-metal catalyst of the invention, a bleach activator such as tetraacetylethylenediamine or a similar compound, with or without nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate sodium salt, and the like.<br>
Other suitable composition forms include laundry bleach additive powders, granular or tablet-form automatic dishwashing detergents, scouring powders and bathroom cleaners, In the solid-form compositions, the catalytic system may lack solvent (water) - this is added by the user along with the substrate (a soiled surface) which is to be cleaned (or contains soil to be oxidized).<br>
Other desirable embodiments of the instant invention include dentifrice or denture cleaning compositions. Suitable compositions to which the transition-metal complexes herein can be added include the dentifrice compositions containing stabilized sodium percarbonate, see for example U.S. 5,424,060 and the denture cleaners of U.S. 5,476,607 which are derived from a mixture containing a pregranulated compressed mixture of anhydrous perborate, perborate monohydrate and lubricant, monopersulfate, non-granulated perborate monohydrate, proteolytic enzyme and sequestering agent, though enzyme-free compositions are also very effective. Optionally, excipients, builders, colors, flavors, and surfactants can be added to such compositions, these being adjuncts characteristic of the intended use. RE32,771 describes another denture cleaning composition to which the instant transition-metal catalysts may profitably be added, Thus, by simple admixture of, for example, about 0.00001% to about 0.1% of the present transition-metal catalyst, a cleaning composition is secured that is particularly suited for compaction into tablet form; this composition also comprises a phosphate salt, an improved perborate salt mixture wherein the improvement comprises a combination of anhydrous perborate and monohydrate perborate in the amount of about 50% to about 70% by weight of the total cleansing composition, wherein the combination includes at least 20% by weight of the total cleansing composition of anhydrous perborate, said combination having a portion present in a compacted granulated mixture with from about 0.01% to about 0.70% by weight of said combination of a polymeric fluorocarbon, and a chelating or sequestering agent present in amounts greater than about 10% by weight<br>
up to about 50% by weight of the total composition, said cleansing composition being capable of cleansing stained surfaces and the like with a soaking time of five minutes or less when dissolved in aqueous solution and producing a marked improvement in clarity of solution upon disintegration and cleaning efficacy over the prior art. Of course, the denture cleaning composition need not extend to the sophistication of such compositions: adjuncts not essential to the provision of catalytic oxidation such as the fluorinated polymer can be omitted if desired.<br>
In another non-limiting illustration, the present transition-metal catalyst can be added to an effervescent denture-cleaning composition comprising monoperphthalate, for.example the magnesium salt thereof, and/or to the composition of U.S. 4,490,269 incorporated herein by reference. Preferred denture cleansing compositions include those having tablet form, wherein the tablet composition is characterized by active oxygen levels in the range from about 100 to about 200 mg/tablet; and compositions characterized by fragrance retention levels greater than about 50% throughout a period of six hours or greater. See U.S. 5,486,304 incorporated by reference for more detail in connection especially with<br><br>
fragrance retention.<br>
The advantages and benefits of the instant invention include cleaning compositions which have superior bleaching compared to compositions not having the selected transition-metal oxidation catalyst. The superiority in bleaching is obtained using very low levels of transition-metal oxidation catalyst. The invention includes embodiments which are especially suited for fabric washing, having a low tendency to damage fabrics in repeated  washings, However, numerous other benefits can be secured; for example, compositions an be relatively more aggressive, as needed, for example, in tough cleaning of durable hard surfaces, such as the interiors of ovens, or kitchen surfaces having difficult-to-remove films of soil. The compositions can be used both in "pre-treat modes, for example to loosen dirt in kitchens or bathrooms; or in a "mainuash" mode, for example in fully-formulated heavy-duty laundry detergent granules. Moreover, in addition to the bleaching and/or soil-removing advantages, other advantages of the instant compositions include their efficacy in improving trw sanitary condition of surfaces ranging from laundered textiles to kitchen counter-tops and bathroom tiles. Without intending to be limited by theory, it is believed that the  compositions can help control or kill a wide variety of micro-organisms, including bacteria, viruses, sub-viral particles and molds; as well as to destroy objectionable non-living proteins and/or peptides such as certain toxins.<br>
The transition-metal oxidation catalysts useful herein may be synthesized by any convenient route. However, specific synthesis methods are nonlimitingly illustrated in detail as follows, including a synthetic method according to the present invention wherein the catalyst is prepared under strictly oxygen and hydroxyl-free conditions by use of bis(pyridine) manganese (II) salts (e.g., chloride salt) to coordinate the manganese into the macropolycyclic rigid ligand [see, for example, Example 1, Method I, and Example 7].<br>

Oxidation Agents;<br>
Oxidation agents (sometimes termed "oxidants") useful in the present invention can be any of the oxidizing agents known for oxidative synthetic<br>
reaction chemistry, pulp oxidation and bleaching, laundry, hard surface cleaning, automatic dishwashing or denture cleaning purposes. Oxygen bleaches or mixtures thereof are preferred, though other oxidants, such as oxygen, an enzymatic hydrogen peroxide producing system, or hypohalites, such as chlorine oxidants like hypochlorite, may also be used. Oxygen-based oxidants deliver "available oxygen" (AvO) or "active oxygen" which is typically measurable by standard methods such as iodide/thiosulfate and/or eerie sulfate titration. See the well-known work by Swern, or Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology under "Bleaching Agents". When the oxidant is a peroxygen compound, it contains -O-O- linkages with one 0 in each such linkage being "active". AvO content of such an oxidant compound, usually expressed as a percent, is equal to 100 * the number of active oxygen atoms * (16 I molecular weight of the oxygen bleach compound). Preferably, an oxygen bleach will be used herein, since this benefits most directly from combination with the catalyst. The mode of combination can vary, For example, the catalyst and oxidant can be incorporated into a single product formula, or can be used in various combinations of "pretreatment product" such as "stain sticks", "main wash product" and even "post-wash product" such as fabric conditioners or dryer-added sheets. The oxidant herein can have any physical form compatible with the intended application; more particularly, liquid-form and solid-form oxidants as well as adjuncts, promoters or activators are included. Liquids can be included in solid detergents, for example by adsorption onto an inert support; and solids can be included in liquid detergents, for example by use of compatible suspending agents. Common oxidants of the peroxygen type include hydrogen peroxide, inorganic peroxohydrates, organic peroxohydrates and the organic peroxyacids, including hydrophilic and hydrophobic mono- or di- peroxyacids. These can be peroxycarboxylic acids, peroxyimidic acids, amidoperoxycarboxylic acids, or their salts including the calcium, magnesium, or mixed-cation salts. Peracids of various kinds can be used both m free form and as precursors known as "bleach activators" or "bleach, promoters" which, when combined with a source of hydrogen peroxide, pernydforyze to release the corresponding peracid. Also useful herein as oxidants are the inorganic peroxides such as Na2O2, superoxides such as KO2 organic hydroperoxides such as cumene<br>
hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydrooeroxtde. and the inorganic peroxoacids and their salts such as the peroxosulfunc acid salts, especially the potassium<br>
salts of peroxodisulfuric acid and, more preferably, of peroxomonosulfuric acid including the commercial triple-salt form sold as OXONE by Dupont and also any equivalent commercially available forms such as CUROX from Akzo or CAROAT from Degussa. Certain organic peroxides, such as dibenzoyl peroxide, may be useful, especially as additives rather than as primary oxygen bleach.<br>
Mixed oxidants are generally useful, as are mixtures of any oxidants with the known bleach activators, organic catalysts, enzymatic catalysts and mixtures thereof; moreover such mixtures may further include brighteners, photobleaches and dye transfer inhibitors of types well-known in the art.<br>
Preferred oxidants include the peroxohydrates, sometimes known as peroxyhydrates or peroxohydrates, These are organic or, more commonly, inorganic Baits capable of releasing hydrogen peroxide rather readily. They include types in which hydrogen peroxide is present as a true crystal hydrate, and types in which hydrogen peroxide is incorporated covalently and is released chemically, for example by hydrolysis. Typically, peroxohydrates deliver hydrogen peroxide readily enough that it can be extracted in measurable amounts into the ether phase of an ether/water mixture. Peroxohydrates are characterized in that they fail to give the Rieserifeld reaction, in contrast to certain other oxidant types described hereinafter. Peroxohydrates are the most common examples of "hydrogen peroxide source" materials and include the perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, and persilicates. Other materials which serve to produce or release hydrogen peroxide are, of course, useful. Mixtures of two or more peroxohydrates can be used, for example when it 1.3 desired to exploit differential solubility. Suitable peroxohydrates include sodium carbonate perowyhydrate and equivalent commercial "perearboriate" oxidants, and any of the so-called sodium perborate hydrates, the "tetrahydrate" and "monohydrate" being preferred; though sodium pyrophosphate peroxyhydrate can be used. Many such peroxohydrates are available in processed forms with coalings, such as of silicate and/or borate and/or wa&gt;cy materials and/or surfactants, or have particle geometries, such as compact spheres, which improve storage stability. By way of organic peroxohydrates, urea peroxyhydrate can also be useful herein.<br>
Percarbonate oxidant includes, for example, dry particles having an average particle size in the range from about 500 micrometers to about 1,000 micrometers, not more than about 10% by weight of said particles<br><br>
being smaller than about 200 micrometers and not more than about 10% by weight of said particles being larger than about 1,250 micrometers. Percarbonates and perborates are widely available in commerce, for example from FMC, Solvay and Tokai Denka.<br>
Organic percarboxylic acids useful herein as the oxidants include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate, available from Interox, m-chloro perbenzoic acid and its salts, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid and their salts. Such bleaches are disclosed in U,S, 4,483,781, U.S. Pat. Appl. 740,446, Bums et al, filed June 3, 1985, EP-A 133,354, published February 20, 1985, and U.S. 4,412,934. Highly preferred oxidants also include 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid (NAPAA) as described in U.S. 4,634,551 and include those having formula HO-O-C(O)-R-Y wherein R is an alkylene or substituted alkylene group containing from 1 to about 22 carbon atoms or a phenylene or substituted phenylene group, and Y is hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, aryl or -C(0)-OH or-C(0)-0-OH.<br>
Organic percarboxylic acids usable herein include those containing one, two or more peroxy groups and can be aliphatic or aromatic. When the<br>
organic percarboxylic acid is aliphatic, the unsubstituted acid suitably has the linear formula: HO-0-C(0)-(CH2)n-Y where Y can be, for example, H, CH3, CH2CI, COOH, or C(O)OOH; and n is an integer from 1 to 20.<br>
Branched analogs are also acceptable. When the organic percarboxylic acid is aromatic, the unsubstituted acid suitably has formula: HO-0-C(O)-C6H4-Y<br>
wherein Y is hydrogen, alkyl, alkyhalogen, halogen, or -COOH or -C(0)OOH.<br>
Monoperoxycarboxylic acids useful as oxidant herein are further illustrated by alkyl percarboxylic acids and aryl percarboxylic acids such as peroxybenzoic acid and ring-substituted peroxybenzoic acids, e.g., peroxy-alpha-naphthoic acid; aliphatic, substituted aliphatic and arylalkyl monoperoxy acids such as peroxylauric acid, peroxystearic acid, and N.N-phthaloylaminoperoxycaproic acid (PAP); and 6-octylamino-6-oxo-peroxyhexanoic acid. Monoperoxycarboxylic acids can be hydrophilic,<br>
•s<br>
such as peracetic acid, or can be relatively hydrophobic. The hydrophobic types include those containing a chain of six or more carbon atoms, preferred hydrophobic types having a linear aliphatic C8-C14 chain optionally substituted by one or more ether oxygen atoms and/or one or more aromatic moieties positioned such that the peracid is an aliphatic<br><br>
peracid. More generally, such optional substitution by ether oxygen atoms and/or aromatic moieties can be applied to any of the peracids or bleach activators herein. Branched-chain peracid types and aromatic peracids having one or more C3-C16 linear or branched long-chain substituents can also be useful. The peracids can be used in the acid form or as any suitable salt with a bleach-stable cation, Very useful herein are the organic percarboxylic acids of formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or mixtures thereof wherein R1 is alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from<br>
2 about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R2   is alkylene, arylene or alkarylene<br>
containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, and R5 is H or alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms. When these peracids have a sum of carbon atoms in R1 and R2 together of about 6 or higher, preferably from about 8 to about 14, they are particularly suitable as hydrophobic peracids for bleaching a variety of relatively hydrophobic or "lipophilic" stains, including so-called "dingy" types. Calcium, magnesium, or substituted ammonium salts may also be useful.<br>
Other useful peracids and bleach activators herein are in the family of imidoperacids and imido bleach activators. These include phthaloylimidoperoxycaproic acid and related arylimido-substituted and acyloxynitrogen derivatives. For listings of such compounds, preparations and their incorporation into laundry compositions Including both granules and liquids, See U.S. 5,487,818; U.S. 5,470,988, U.S. 5,466,825; U.S. 5,419,846; U.S. 5,415,796; U.S. 5.391,324; U.S. 5,328.634; U.S. 5,310,934; U.S. 5,279,757; U.S. 5.246,620; U.S, 5,245,075; U.S. 5,294,362; U.S. 5,423,998; U.S. 5,208,340; U.S. 5,132,431 and U.S. 5,087385.<br>
Useful diperoxyacids include, for example, 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid, (DPDA); 1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid; diperOxybrassilic acid; diperoxysebasic acid and diperoxyisophthalic acid; 2-decyldiperoxybutane-1,4-dioic acid; and 4,4'-sulphonylbisperoxybenzoic acid. Owing to structures in which two relatively hydrophilic groups are disposed at the ends of the molecule, diperoxyacids have sometimes been classified separately from the hydrophitic and hydrophobic monoperacids,<br>
for example as "hydrotropic": Some of the diperacids are hydrophoblc in a quite literal sense, especially when they have a long-chain moiety separating the peroxyacid moieties.<br>
. More generally, the terms "hydrophilic" and "hydrophobia" used herein in connection with any of the oxidants, especially the peracids, and in connection with bleach activators, are in the first instance based on whether a given oxidant effectively performs bleaching of fugitive dyes in solution thereby preventing fabric 'greying and discoloration and/or removes more hydrophilic stains such as tea, wine and grape juice - in this case it is termed "hydrophilic", When the oxidant or bleach activator has a significant stain removal, whiteness-improving or cleaning effect on dingy, greasy, carotenoid, or other hydrophobic soils, it is termed "hydrophobia". The-terms are applicable also when referring to peracids or bleach activators used in combination with a hydrogen peroxide source. The current commercial benchmarks for hydrophilic performance of oxidant systems are: TAED or peracetic acid, for benchmarking hydrophilic bleaching. NOBS or NAPAA are the corresponding benchmarks for hydrophobic bleaching. The terms "hydrophilic", "hydrophobic" and "hydrotropic" with reference to oxidants including peracids and here extended to bleach activator have also • been used somewhat more narrowly in the literature. See especially Kirk Othmer's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Vol. 4., pages 284-285. This reference provides a chromatographic retention time and critical micelle concentration-based set of criteria, and is useful to identify and/or characterize preferred sub-classes of hydrophobic, hydrophilic and hydrotropic oxidants and bleach activators that can be used in the present invention.<br>
Bleach Activators<br>
Bleach activators useful herein include amides, imides, esters and anhydrides. Commonly at least one substituted or unsubstituted acyl moiety is present, covalently connected to a leaving group as in the structure R-C(0)-L. In one preferred mode of use, bleach activators are combined with a source of hydrogen peroxide, such as the perborates or percarbonates, in a single product. Conveniently, the single product leads 10 in situ production in aqueous solution (i.e., during the washing process) of the pcrcarboxylic acid corresponding to the bleach activator. The product itself can be hydrous, for example a powder, provided that water is controlled in amount and mobility such that storage stability is acceptable. Alternately, the product can be an anhydrous solid or liquid. In<br><br>
another, mode, the bleach activator or oxygen bleach is incorporated in a pretreatment product, such as a stain stick; soiled, pretreated substrates can then be exposed to further treatments, for example of a hydrogen peroxide source. With respect to the above bleach activator structure RC(0)L, the atom in the leaving group connecting to the peracid-forming acyl moiety R(C)O- is most typically 0 or N. Bleach activators can have non-charged, positively or negatively charged peracid-forming moieties and/or noncharged, positively or negatively charged leaving groups. One or more peracid-forming moieties or leaving-groups can be present. See, for example, U.S. 5,595,967, U.S. 5,561,235, U.S. 5,560,862 or the bis-(peroxy-carbonic) system of U.S. 5,534,179. Bleach activators can be substituted with electron-donating or electron-releasing moieties either in the leaving-group or in the peracid-forming moiety or moieties, changing their reactivity and making-them more or less suited to particular pH or wash conditions. For example, electron-withdrawing groups such as N02 improve the<br>
efficacy of bleach activators intended for use in mild-pH (e.g., from about 7.5- to about 9.5) wash conditions.<br>
Cationic bleach activators include quaternary carbamate-, quaternary carbonate-, quaternary ester- and quaternary amide- types, delivering a range of cationic peroxyimidic, peroxycarbonic or peroxycarboxylic acids to the wash. An analogous but non-cationic palette of bleach activators is available when quaternary derivatives are not desired. In more detail, cationic activators include quaternary ammonium-substituted activators of WO 96-06915, U.S. 4,751,015 and 4,397,757, EP-A-284292, EP-A-331.229 and EP-A-03520 including 2-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) ethyl-4-sulphophenyl carbonate-(SPCC); N-octyl,N,N-dimethyl-N 10-carbophenoxy decyl ammonium chloride-(ODC); 3-(N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium) propyl sodium-4-sulphophenyl carboxylate; and N,N,N-trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy benzene sulfonate. Also useful are cationic nitriles as disclosed in EP-A-303,520 and in European Patent Specification 458,396 and 464,880. Other nitrile types have electron-withdrawing substituents as described in U.S. 5,591,378; examples including j.5-dimethoxybenzonitri!e and 3,5-dinitrobenzonitrile.<br>
Other bleach activator disclosure include GB 836,988; 864.798; 907,356; 1,003,310 and 1,519,351; German Pjicni 3.337.921; EP-A-0185522; EP-A-0174132; EP-A-0120591; U.S. Pat Soy 1.246.339; 3,332,882: 4,128,494; 4,412,934 and 4,675,393, and the phenol sul Innate ester of alkanoyl aminoacids disclosed in U.S. 5,523,434. Suitable bleach activators include any acetylated diamine types, whether hydrophilic or hs Jrnphobic in character.<br>
Of the- above classes of bleach precursors, preferred classes include the esters, including acyl phenol sulfonates, acyl alkyl phenol sulfonates or acyl oxybenzenesulfonates (OBS leaving-group); the acyl-amides; and the quaternary ammonium substituted peroxyacid precursors including the cationic nitrites.<br>
Preferred bleach activators include N,N,N'N'-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) or any of its close relatives including the triacetyl or other unsymmetrical derivatives. TAED and the acetylated carbohydrates such as glucose pentaacetate and tetraacetyl xylose are preferred hydrophilic bleach activators. Depending on the application, acetyl triethyl citrate, a liquid, also has some utility, as does phenyl benzoate.<br>
Preferred hydrophobic bleach activators include sodium nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS or SNOBS), substituted amide types described in detail hereinafter, such as activators related to NAPAA, and activators related to certain imidoperacid bleaches, for example as described in U.S. Patent 5,061,807, issued October 29, 1991 and assigned to Hoechst Aktiengesellschaft of Frankfurt, Germany. Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application (Kokai) No. 4-28799 for example describes a bleaching agent and a bleaching detergent composition comprising an organic peracid precursor described by a general formula and illustrated by compounds which may be summarized more particularly as conforming to the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein L is sodium p-phenolsulfonate, R1 is CH3 or C-12H25 and R2 is H. Analogs of these compounds having any of the leaving-groups identified herein and/or having R1 being linear or branched C6-C16 are also useful,<br>
Another group of peracids and bleach activators herein are those derivable from acyclic imidoperoxycarboxylic acids and salts thereof of the formula:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
cyclic imidoperoxycarboxylic acids and salts thereof of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
and (iii) mixtures of said<br>
compounds, (i) and (ii);<br>
wherein M is selected from hydrogen and bleach-compatible cations having charge q; and y and z are integers such that said compound is electrically neutral; E, A and X comprise hydrocarbyl groups; and said terminal hydrocarbyl groups are contained within E and A.   The structure of the corresponding bleach activators is obtained by deleting the peroxy moiety and the metal and replacing it with a leaving-group L, which can be any of the leaving-group moieties defined elsewhere herein. In preferred embodiments, there are encompassed detergent compositions wherein, in any of said compounds, X is linear C3-C8 alkyl; A is selected from:<br>
, wherein n is from 0 to about 4, and<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R1 and E are said terminal hydrocarbyl groups, R2, R3 and R4 are independently selected from H, C1-C3 saturated alkyl, and C1-C3<br>
unsaturated alkyl; and wherein said terminal hydrocarbyl groups are alkyl groups comprising at least six carbon atoms, more typically linear or branched alkyl having from about 8 to about 16 carbon atoms.<br>
Other suitable bleach activators include sodium-4-benzoyloxy benzene sulfonate (SBOBS); sodium-1-methyl-2-benzoyloxy benzene-4-sulphonate; sodium-4-methyl-3-benzoyloxy benzoate (SPCC); trimethyl ammonium toluyloxy-benzene sulfonate; or sodium 3,5,5-trimethyl hexanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (STHOBS).<br>
Bleach activators may be used in an amount of up to 20%, preferably from 0.1-10% by weight, of the composition, though higher levels, 40% or more, are acceptable, for example in highly concentrated bleach additive product forms or forms intended for appliance automated dosing.<br>
Highly preferred bleach activators useful herein are amide-substituted and have either of the formulae:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
or mixtures thereof, wherein R is alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms including both hydrophilic types (short R1) and hydrophobia types (R1 is especially from about 8 to about 12), R2 is alkylene, arylene or alkarylene containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R is H, or an alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl containing from about 1 to about 10 carbon atoms, and L is a leaving group.<br>
A leaving group as defined herein is any group that is displaced from the bleach activator as a consequence of attack by perhydroxide or equivalent reagent capable of liberating a more potent bleach from the reaction. Perhydrolysis is a term used to describe such reaction. Thus bleach activators perhydrolyze to liberate peracid. Leaving groups of bleach activators for relatively low-pH washing are suitably electron-withdrawing, Preferred leaving groups have slow rates of reassociation with the moiety from which they have been displaced, Leaving groups of bleach activators are preferably selected such that their removal and peracid formation are at rates consistent with the desired application, e.g., a wash cycle. In practice, a balance is struck such that leaving-groups are<br>
not appreciably liberated, and the corresponding activators do not appreciably hydrolyze or perhydrolyze, while stored in a bleaching composition. The pK of the conjugate acid of the leaving group is a measure of suitability, and is typically from about 4 to about 16, preferably from about 6 to about 12, more preferably from about 8 to about 11.<br>
Preferred   bleach  activators  include  those  of the  formulae,   for<br><br>
example the amide-substituted formulae, hereinabove, wherein R1 , R2 and R5 are as defined for the corresponding peroxyacid and L is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
 (Formula Removed)<br>
and mixtures thereof, wherein R is a linear or branched alkyl, aryl, or alkaryl group containing from about 1 to about 14 carbon atoms, R is an alkyl chain containing from 1 to about 8 carbon atoms, R4 is H or R3, and Y is H or a solubilizing group. These and other known leaving groups are, more generally, general suitable alternatives for introduction into any bleach activator herein. Preferred solubilizing groups include -S03-M+, -CO2-M+, -SO4-M+ -N+(R)4X and O
	<br>
and -CO2- M wherein R3 is an alkyl chain containing from about 1 to about 4 carbon atoms, M is a bleach-stable cation and X is a bleach-stable anion, each of which is selected consistent with maintaining solubility of the activator. Under some circumstances, for example solid-<br>
form European heavy-duty granular detergents, any of the above bleach activators are preferably solids having crystalline character and melting-point above about 50 deg. C; in these cases, branched alkyl groups are preferably not included in the oxygen bleach or bleach activator; in other formulation contexts, for example heavy-duty liquids with bleach or liquid bleach additives, low-melting or liquid bleach activators are preferred. Melting-point reduction can be favored by incorporating branched, rather than linear alkyl moieties into the oxygen bleach or precursor.<br>
When solubilizing groups are added to the leaving group, the activator can have good water-solubility or dispersibility while still being capable of delivering a relatively hydrophobic peracid. Preferably, M is alkali metal, ammonium or substituted ammonium, more preferably Na or K, and X is halide, hydroxide, methylsulfate or acetate. Solubilizing groups can, more generally, be used in any bleach activator herein. Bleach activators of lower solubility, for example those with leaving group not having a solubilizing group, may need to be finely divided or dispersed in bleaching solutions for acceptable results.<br>
Preferred bleach activators also include those of the above general formula wherein L is selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein R3 is as defined above and Y is -SO3-M+ or -CO2-M+ wherein M is as defined above.<br>
Preferred examples of bleach activators of the above formulae include (6-<br>
octanamidocaproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate,	(6-nonanamidocaproyl)<br>
oxybenzenesulfonate,    (6-decanamidocaproyl)oxybenzenesulfonate,    and mixtures thereof,<br>
Other useful activators, disclosed in U.S, 4,966,723, are benzoxazin-type, such as a C0H4 ring to which is fused in the 1,2-positions a moiety -<br>
C(O)OC(R1)=N-.<br>
Depending on the activator and precise application, good bleaching results can be obtained from bleaching systems having with in-use pH of from about 6 to about 13, preferably from about 9.0 to about 10.5. Typically, for example, activators with electron-withdrawing moieties are used for near-neutral or sub-neutral pH ranges. Alkalis and buffering agents can be used to secure such pH<br>
Acyl lactam activators are very useful herein, especially the acyl caprolactams (see for example WO 94-28102 A) and acyl valerolactams (see U.S. 5,503,639) of the formulae:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
wherein R6 is H, alkyl, aryl, alkoxyaryl, an alkaryl group containing from 1 to about 12 carbon atoms, or substituted phenyl containing from about 6 to about 18 carbons. See also U.S. 4,545,784 which discloses acyl caprolactams, including benzoyl caprolactam adsorbed into sodium perborate. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, NOBS, lactam activators, imide activators or amide-functional activators, especially the more hydrophobic derivatives, are desirably combined with hydrophilic activators such as TAED, typically at weight ratios of hydrophobic activator: TAED in the range of 1:5 to 5:1, preferably about 1:1. Other suitable lactam activators are alpha-modified, see WO 96-22350 A1, July 25, 1996. Lactam activators, especially the more hydrophobic types, are desirably used in combination with TAED, typically at weight ratios of amido-derived or caprolactam activators: TAED in the range of 1:5 to 5:1, preferably about 1:1. See also the bleach activators having cyclic amidine leaving-group disclosed in U.S. 5.552,556.<br>
Nonlimiting examples of additional activators useful herein are to be found in U.S. 4,915,854, U.S. 4,412,934 and 4,634,551. The hydrophobic activator nonanoyloxybenzene sulfonate (NOBS) and the hydrophilic tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED) activator are typical, and mixtures thereof can also be used.<br>
The superior bleaching/cleaning action of the present compositions is also preferably achieved with safety to natural rubber machine parts, for example of certain european washing appliances (see WO 94-28104) and other natural rubber articles, including fabrics containing natural rubber and natural rubber elastic materials. Complexities of bleaching mechanisms are legion and are not completely understood.<br>
Additional activators useful herein include those of U.S. 5,545,349. Examples include esters of an organic acid and ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol or glycerin, or the acid imide of an organic acid and ethylenediamine; wherein the organic acid is selected from methoxyacetic acid, 2-<br>
methoxypropionic acid, p-methoxybenzoic acid, ethoxyacetic acid, 2-<br>

methoxy-1-methylethoxy)ethoxyacetic	acid,	2-(2-methoxy-2-<br>
methylethoxy)ethoxyacetic acid and 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethoxyacetic acid.<br>
Enzymatic sources of hydrogen peroxide<br>
On a different track from the bleach activators illustrated hereinabove, another suitable hydrogen peroxide generating system is a combination of a C1 -C4 alkanol oxidase and a C1 -C4 alkanol, especially a combination of<br>
methano! oxidase (MOX) and ethanol, Such combinations are disclosed in WO 94/03003. Other enzymatic materials related to bleaching, such as peroxidases, haloperoxidases, oxidases, superoxide dismutascs, catalases and their enhancers or, more commonly, inhibitors, may be used as optional ingredients in the instant compositions.<br>
Oxygen transfer agents and precursors<br>
Also useful herein are any of the known organic bleach catalysts, oxygen transfer agents or precursors therefor. These include the compounds themselves and/or their precursors, for example any suitable ketone for production of dioxiranes and/or any of the hetero-atom containing analogs of dioxirane precursors or dioxiranes , such as sulfonimines R1R2C=NSO2R3, see EP 446 982 A, published 1991 and sulfonyloxaziridines, for example:<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
see EP 446,981 A, published 1991. Preferred examples of such materials include hydrophilic or hydrophobic ketones, used especially in conjunction with monoperoxysulfates to produce dioxiranes in situ, and/or the imines described in U.S. 5,576,282 and references described therein. Oxygen<br>
bleaches preferably used in conjunction with such oxygen transfer agents or precursors include percarboxylic acids and salts, percarbonic acids and salts, peroxymonosulfuric acid and salts, and mixtures thereof. See also U.S. 5,360,568; U.S. 5,360,569; and U.S. 5,370,826.<br>
Catalytic System Combinations<br>
While the combinations of ingredients used with the transition-metal bleach catalysts of the invention can be widely permuted, some particularly preferred combinations include:<br>
(a)	transition metal bleach catalyst + hydrogen peroxide source alone,<br>
e.g., sodium perborate or percarbonate;<br>
(b)	as (a) but with the further addition of a bleach activator selected<br>
from<br>
(i) hydrophilic bleach activators;<br>
(ii) hydrophobia bleach activators and<br>
(iii) mixtures thereof;<br>
(c)	transition metal bleach catalyst + peracid alone, e.g.,<br>
(i) hydrophilic peracid. e.g., peracetic acid;<br>
(ii) hydrophobic peracid, e.g., NAPAA or peroxylauric acid;<br>
(iii) inorganic peracid, e.g., peroxymonosulfuric acid K salts;<br>
(d)	use (a), (b) or (c) with the further addition of an oxygen transfer<br>
agent or<br>
precursor therefor; especially (c) + oxygen transfer agent. Any of (a) - (d) can be further combined with one or more polymeric dispersants, sequestrants, antioxidants, fluorescent whitening agents, photobleaches and/or dye transfer inhibitors. In such combinations, the transition metal bleach catalyst will preferably be at levels in a range suited to provide wash (in-use) concentrations of from about 0.1 to about 10 ppm (weight of catalyst); the other components being used at their known levels which may vary widely.<br>
While there is currently no certain advantage, the transition metal catalysts of the invention can be ussd in combination with heretofore-disclosed transition metal bleach or dye transfer inhibition catalysts, such as the Mn or Fe complexes of triazacyclononanes, the Fe complexes of N,N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-bis(pyridin-2-yl)methylamine (U.S. 5,580.485) and the like. For example, when the transition metal bleachcaTalyst is one disclosed to be particularly effective for solution bleaching and dye transfer inhibition, as is the case for example with certain transition metal complexes<br>
of porphyrins, it may be combined with one better suited for promoting interfacial bleaching of soiled substrates. Laundry.and Cleaning Compositions_and Methods:<br>
In general, a laundry or cleaning adjunct is any material required to transform a composition containing only transition-metal bleach catalyst into a composition useful for laundry or cleaning purposes. Adjuncts in general include detersive surfactants, builders, enzymes, and like materials having an independent cleaning function; and also stabilizers, diluents, structuring materials, agents having aesthetic effect such as colorants, pro-perfumes and perfumes. In preferred embodiments, laundry or cleaning adjuncts are readily recognizable to those of skill in the art as being characteristic of laundry or cleaning products, especially of laundry or cleaning products intended for direct use by a consumer in a domestic environment.<br>
In a hard surface cleaning or fabric laundering operation which uses the present invention catalytic systems, the target substrate will typically be a fabric or surface stained with, for example, various food stains.<br>
In the case of use in laundry or hard surface catalytic systems or methods, the catalytically effective amount of transition-metal oxidation catalyst is that sufficient to enhance the appearance of a soiled surface. In such cases, the appearance is typically improved in one or more of whiteness, brightness and de-staining; and a catalytically effective amount is one requiring less than a stoichiometric number of moles of catalyst when compared with the number of moles of primary oxidant, such as hydrogen peroxide or hydrophobic peracid, required to produce measurable effect. In addition to direct observation of the bulk surface being bleached or cleaned, catalytic bleaching effect can (where appropriate) be measured indirectly, such as by measurement of the kinetics or end-result of oxidizing a dye in solution,<br>
By "effective amount" in a laundry or cleaning adjunct context is meant an amount of a material, such as a detergent adjunct, which is sufficient under whatever comparative or use conditions are employed, to provide the desired end-result benefit, for example in laundry and cleaning methods to improve the appearance of a soiled surface in one or more use cycles, A "use cycle" is, for example, one wash of a bundle of fabrics by a consumer. Appearance or visual effect can be measured by the consumer, by technical observers such as trained panelists, or by technical instrument means such as spectroscopy or image analysis.<br>
Unless otherwise indicated, the detergent or detergent additive compositions may be formulated as granular or power-form all-purpose or "heavy-duty" washing agents, especially laundry detergents; liquid, gel or paste-form all-purpose washing agents, especially the so-called heavy-duty liquid types; liquid fine-fabric detergents; hand dishwashing agents or light duty dishwashing agents, especially those of the high-foaming type; machine dishwashing agents, including the various tabletted, granular, liquid and rinse-aid types for household and institutional use; liquid cleaning and disinfecting agents, including antibacterial hand-wash types, laundry bars, mouthwashes, dentine cleaners, car or carpet shampoos, bathroom cleaners; hair shampoos and hair-rinses; shower gels and foam baths and metal cleaners; as well as cleaning auxiliaries such as bleach additives and "stain-stick" or pre-treat types.<br>
Catalytic systems herein as incorporated into detergents can include boron-free, phosphate-free, or chlorine-free embodiments.<br>
Desirable adjuncts more generally include detersive surfactants, builders, enzymes, dispersant polymers, color speckles, silvercare, anti-tarnish and/or anti-corrosion agents, dyes, fillers, germicides, alkalinity sources, hydrotropes, anti-oxidants, enzyme stabilizing agents, perfumes, solubilizing agents, carriers, processing aids, pigments, and, for liquid formulations, solvents, as described in detail hereinafter.<br>
Quite typically, laundry or cleaning compositions herein such as laundry detergents, laundry detergent additives, hard surface cleaners, automatic dishwashing detergents, synthetic and soap-based laundry bars, fabric softeners and fabric treatment liquids, solids and treatment articles of all kinds will require several adjuncts, though certain simply formulated products, such as bleach additives, may require only metal catalyst and a single supporting material such as a detergent builder or surfactant which helps to make (he potent catalyst available to the consumer in a manageable dose.<br>
Catalyst system compositions of ih present invention useful for laundry or cleaning products comprise transition-metal bleach catalyst comprising a complex of a transition metal and a macropolycylic rigid ligand as defined herein. The compositions also comprise at least one edjuct material, preferably comprising an oxygen bleaching agent such as a source ui hvdrogen peroxide. More preferably, the adjunct component includes both an oxygen bleaching agent and at least one other adjunct material selected from non-bleaching  suited for laundry detergents or cleaning products. Non-bleachinc adiuixts as defined herein are adjuncts useful in detergents and cleaning products which neither bleach on their own, nor are<br>
recognized as adjuncts used in cleaning primarily as promoters of bleaching such as is the case with bleach activators, organic bleach catalysts or peracids. Preferred non-bleaching adjuncts include detersive surfactants, detergent builders, non-bleaching enzymes having a useful function in detergents, and the like. Preferred cleaning compositions herein can incorporate a source of hydrogen peroxide which is any common hydrogen-peroxide releasing salt, such as sodium perborate, sodium percarbonate, and mixtures thereof. Also useful are other sources of available oxygen such as persulfate (e.g., OXONE, manufactured by DuPont), as well as preformed organic peracids.<br>
In a hard surface cleaning or fabric laundering operation which uses the present invention compositions, the target substrate, that is, the material to be cleaned, will typically be a fabric or surface stained with, for example, various hydrophilic food stains, such as coffee, tea or wine; with hydrophobic stains such as greasy or carotenoid stains; or is a "dingy" surface, for example one yellowed by the presence of a relatively uniformly distributed fine residue of hydrophobic soils.<br>
In the preferred laundry compositions, adjuncts such as builders including zeolites and phosphates, surfactants such as anionic and/or nonionic and/or cationic surfactants, dispersant polymers (which modify and inhibit crystal growth of calcium and/or magnesium salts), chelants (which control wash water introduced transition metals), alkalis (to adjust pH), and detersive enzymes are present. Additional bleach-modifying adjuncts such as conventional bleach activators such as TAED and/or NOBS may be added, provided that any such materials are delivered in such a manner as to be compatible with the purposes of the present invention. The present detergent or detergent-additive compositions may, moreover, comprise one or more processing aids, fillers, perfumes, conventional enzyme particle-making materials including enzyme cores or "nonpareils", as well as pigments, and the like. In the preferred laundry compositions, additional ingredients such as soil release polymers, brighteners, and/or dye transfer inhibitors can be present.<br>
The inventive compositions can include laundry detergents, hard-surface cleaners and the like which include all the components needed for cleaning; alternatively, the compositions can be made for use as cleaning additives, A cleaning additive, for example, can be a composition containing the transition-metal bleach catalyst, a detersive surfactant, and a builder, and can be sold for use as an "add-on", to be used with a conventional determent uhich contains a perborate, percarbonate. or other primary oxidant. The compositions herein can include automatic dishwashing compositions (ADD) and demure cleaners, thus, they are not, in general, limited to fabric washing.<br>
In general, adjunct materials used for the production of ADD compositions herein are preferably checked for compatibility with spotting/filming on glassware. Test methods for spotting/filming are generally described in the automatic dishwashing detergent literature, including DIN test methods. Certain oily materials, especially those having longer hydrocarbon chain lengths, and insoluble materials such as clays, as well as long-chain fatty acids or soaps which form soap scum are therefore preferably limited or excluded from such compositions.<br>
Amounts of the essential ingredients can vary within wide ranges, however preferred cleaning compositions herein (which have a 1% aqueous solution pH of from about 6 to about 13, more preferably from about 7,5 to about 11.5, and most preferably less than about 11, especially from about 9 to about 10.5) ore those wherein there is present: from about 0.01 ppm to about 500 ppm of a transition-metal bleach catalyst in accordance with the invention, and the balance, typically from at least about 90% to about 100% of one or more laundry or cleaning adjuncts. In preferred embodiments, there can be present (also expressed as a percentage by weight of the entire composition) from 0.1% to about 90%, preferably from about 0.5% to about 50% of a primary oxidant, such as a preformed peracid or a source of hydrogen peroxide; from 0% to about 20%, preferably at least about 0.001%, of a conventional bleach-promoting adjunct, such as a hydrophilic bleach activator, a hydrophobic bleach activator, or a mixture of hydrophilic and hydrophobic bleach activators, and at least about 0.001%, preferably from about 1% to about 40%, of a laundry or cleaning adjunct which does not have a primary role in bleaching, such as a detersive surfactant, a detergent builder, a detergent enzyme, a stabilizer, a detergent buffer, or mixtures thereof. Such fully-formulated embodiments desirably comprise, by way of non-bleaching adjuncts, from about 0.1% to about 15% of a polymeric dispersant, from about 0.01% to about 10% of a chelant, and from about 0.00001% to about 10% of a detersive enzyme though further additional or adjunct ingredients, especially colorants, perfumes, pro-perfumes (compounds which release a fragrance when triggered by any suitable trigger such as heat, enzyme action, or change in pH) may be present. Preferred adjuncts herein are selected from bleach-stable types, though bleach-unstable types can often be included through the skill of the formulator.<br>
Detergent compositions herein can have any desired physical form; when in granular form, it is typical to limit water content, for example to less than about 10%, preferably less than about 7% free water, for best storage stability. However, liquid forms using both aqueous and/or nonaqueous solvents are also included.<br><br>
Further, preferred compositions of this invention include those which are substantially free of chlorine bleach. By "substantially ftee" of chlorine bleach is meant that the formulator does not deliberately add a chlorine-containing bleach additive, such as hypochlorite or a source thereof, such as a chlorinated isocyanurate, to the preferred composition, However, it is recognized that because of factors outside the control of the formulator, such as chlorination of the water supply, some non-zero amount of chlorine bleach may be present in the wash liquor. The term "substantially free" can be similarly constructed with reference to preferred limitation of other ingredients, such as phosphate builder.<br>
In a fabric laundering operation, the target substrate will typically be a fabric stained with, for example, various food stains. The test conditions will vary, depending on the type of washing appliance used and the habits of the user. Thus, front-loading laundry washing machines of the type employed in Europe generally use less water and higher detergent concentrations than do top-loading U.S.-style machines. Some machines have considerably longer wash cycles than others. Some users elect to use very hot water; others use warm or even cold water in fabric laundering operations. Of course, the catalytic performance of the transition-metal bleach catalyst will be affected by such considerations, and the levels of transition-metal bleach catalyst used in fully-formulated detergent and bleach compositions can be appropriately adjusted. As a practical matter, and not by way of limitation, the compositions and processes herein can be adjusted to provide on the order of at least one part per ten million of the active transition-metal bleach catalyst, in the aqueous washing liquor, and will preferably provide from about 0.01 ppm to about 1.0 ppm, more preferably from about 0.03 ppm to about 0.6 ppm, of the transition-metal bleach catalyst, in the laundry liquor. To illustrate this point further, on the order of 3 micromolar transition-metal bleach catalyst is effective at 40°C, pH 10 under European conditions using perborate and a bleach activator (e.g., nonanoyloxybenzenesulfonate). An increase in concentration of 3-5 fold may be required under U.S. conditions to achieve the same results. Conversely, use of a bleach activator and the transition-metal bleach catalyst with perborate may allow the formulator to achieve equivalent bleaching at lower perborate usage levels than products without the transition-metal bleach catalyst.<br>
The bulk density of granular detergent compositions in accordance with the present invention typically have a hulk density of at least 600 g/liter, more preferably from 650 g/liter to 1200 g/ liter. Bulk density is measured by means of a simple funnel and cup device consisting of a conical funnel molded rigidly on a base and provided with a flap valve at its lower extremity to allow the contents of the<br><br>
funnel to be emptied into an axially aligned cylindrical cup disposed below the funnel. The funnel is 130 mm high and has internal diameters of 130 mm and 40 mm at its respective upper and lower extremities. It is mounted so that the lower extremity is 140 mm above the upper surface of the base. The cup has an overall height of 90 mm, an internal height of 87 mm and an internal diameter of 84 mm. Its nominal volume is 500 ml.<br>
To carry out a measurement, the funnel is filled with powder by hand pouring, the flap valve is opened and powder allowed to overfill the cup. The filled cup is removed from the frame and excess powder removed from the cup by passing a straight edged implement e.g.; a knife, across its upper edge. The filled cup is then weighed and the value obtained for the weight of powder doubled to provide a bulk density in g/liter. Replicate measurements are made as required.<br>
The instant compositions may include a detersive surfactant as a preferred component. Detersive surfactants are extensively illustrated in U.S. 3,929,678, Dec. 30, 1975 Laughlin, et at, and U.S. 4,259,217, March 31, 1981, Murphy; in the series "Surfactant Science", Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York and Basel; in "Handbook of Surfactants", M.R. Porter, Chapman and Hall, 2nd Ed., 1994; in "Surfactants in Consumer Products", Ed, J. Falbe, Springer-Verlag, 1987; and in numerous detergent-related patents assigned to Procter &amp; Gamble and other detergent and consumer product manufacturers.
