FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
This invention relates to a process for obtaining refined,  ultra<br>
pure, porous alumina powder and an apparatus therefor.<br>
This  invention  further  relates  to  a  process  for  obtaining<br>
refined,  ultra  pure, porous alumina powder from  the  activated<br>
hydrolysis of wssste Al-metsl in water vapour.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Alumina  or sapphire (A1 O) is an important industrial  product.<br>
                             2 3 Incorporation  of  metals, metal oxides, or  other  materials  in<br>
pores in a porous Al2O3 offers new Al2O3 ceramics and products. They display many unique properties and have a great deal of attention owing to potential applications in high performance catalysts, sensors, separation membranes, microelectronic circuits, phosphors, surface coating and hot gas fi11ers.<br>
In  industries, a pure as well as derived Al2O3 ceramics in  fine<br>
powders are produced from Al3+ salts through a vehicle of sol-gel<br>
or other precursor methods. A precursor or activator additive (organic chemical) used in these methods generates slot of tonic gases during processing and thermal decomposition of precursor mixture with Al3+ cations to have the final ceramic powder- It adds, unwanted impurities in final product. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process and apparatus for obtaining refined, porous alumina powder which is ultra pure. A  further object of this invention is to propose a  process  and<br>
1<br><br>
apparatus  for obtaining refined, porous alumina, powder which  is<br>
simple.<br>
      Further  objects  and advantages of this invention  will  be apparent from the ensuing description. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
       Thus according to this invention is provided a process for the preparation of ultra pure porous alueina powder comprising the steps of cleaning and refining a aluminnium metal surface, followed by washing the refined surface, subjecting the washed surface to a treatment with aqueous solution of a Hg+2 salt  such  as  herein described followed by  washing  to  remove<br>
excess  Hg+2 ions, to obtain the nascent aluminium  surface, and<br>
subjecting  the same to treatment with cooled water vapour at  20<br>
to  300C, to obtain alumina fibres followed by heating at 300  to<br>
   a 400 C, to obtain alumina powder.<br>
    In  accordance with this invention,a process is  developed  to refine an ultra  pure AL2O3  powder(porous) from waste Al-metal<br>
in   A1—industries   or  workshops-It  involves   its   activated<br>
hydro1ys is in flowing cooled H2O vapour at room<br>
temperature Otherwise, a thin surface passivation layer  develops<br>
and stops the reaction. A set—up is designed to conduct a nondisrupted hydrolysis with freshly created nascent metal surfaces  by a chemical treatment and  mechanical  deformation.It<br>
helps to refine a pure Al2O3  and to recover it leaving behind<br>
                              2 3 byproduct  impurities in base metal. A nondisrupted hydrolysis  of<br>
Al-metal in cooleod H2O vapour is tested with specimens of (i)<br>
a pure metal (99%), (ii) an alloy.<br>
1<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
with 5-20% transition metals and carbons, and (iii) waste Al scrsps or plates from machine shops. A general observation of these experiments is that the impurities as such adversel inhibit  hydrolysis  of  Al-metal. Irrespective  of  origin,  the<br>
specimen  invariably has a thin A12O3 surfaee layer. As such,  it<br>
                                         2 3 strongly  adheres  to  metal surface and does  not  allow  it  to<br>
hydrolyze.<br>
The oxide surface is refined and a refreshed metal surface is introduced by its chemical treatments and/or mechanical deformation. The specimen is thoroughly washed in distilled water with a mineral acid such as a 1-2% hydrochloric acid and then further treated with a mineral acid such as 0-1-0.2M hydrochloric acid for 10-20 mins., followed by washing in water again. It yields reasonably cleaned surfaces which still have part of oxide surface layers sufficient enough to prevent any hydrolysis reaction.  Till this stage, it does not allow a visible  reaction<br>
in H20 vapour. A  further  refined metal surface to allow H2O to react  with  Al<br>
atoms  though it is obtained by treating with Hg2+ -cations.  In<br>
this  process, the specimen with refreshed surfaces is dipped  in<br>
an  aqueous Hg2+ solution at a concentration of 0.1-0.3M for  1—2<br>
mins. Bnd then rinsed in water followed by oxalic acid to remove<br>
Hg+2 cations. The Hg2+ cations react with Al at nascent  surface<br>
by getting reduced to HG metal, Hg2+   + 2 Al - 3 Hg + 2 Al  , It<br><br>
forms a thin amalgam film with nascent Al surface. The amalgam induces residual surface oxide layer to pile off and segregate over it alongwith byproduct impurities, Those are removed along— with excess amalgam, if any, while wsshing in water. The  nascent<br>
metal surfaces thus obtained are highly reactive to H2O molecules<br>
                                                               2 and induce an activated self-induced hydrolysis as soon as put in<br>
cooled H2O vapour at room temperature. 2<br>
H2O molecules  at nascent Al surface decompose into OH   and  H+<br>
ions. The OH  anions conduct the hydrolysis by reacting with  Al atoms at nascent Al surface, resulting in the hydrolyzed Al metal<br>
A1O(OH),HO product. The reaction can be expressed as<br>
2<br><br>
Nascent  AlO(OH)  absorbs  H2O from the medium  and  converts  to<br>
                                 2 AlO(OH),2H2O,  Here,  a nondisrupted continuous  reaction  over  a<br>
           2 period of 2-5 mins. is necessary in order to refile a pure sample<br>
by leaving behind byproduct impurities in base metal. This is easily achieved in case the reaction is carried out with a pure Al metal. In this case, it proceeds so fast that the product grows as fibres perpendicular to reaction surface. Fibres of length  150-200  mm  grow in 25-100 ?m diameters  in  cooled  H2O<br>
vapour at 20-300C.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
According to this invention is further provided an apparatus for the preparation of. obtaining refined, ultra fine, porous alumina powder.<br>
In accordance with this invention is further provided a special reaction chamber for an uninterrupted reaction with the help of a continuous flow of cooled H2O vapour in Al—metal having the usual impurities- A refreshed Al metal specimen with nascent surface is put in a box preferably made of glass with support at corners  so<br>
that the surfaces are ,in direct contact of flowing H2O vapour.  A<br>
                                                               2 few holes of 2-3 mm diameter are made to allow H2O vapour to pass<br>
through  the plate during the reaction. Another similar piste  of<br>
Al or other material, with regular hoies of 2-3 mm diameter is placed parallel to the first plate at a distance of about 2 mm.<br>
Hyrolyzing  Al  metal  in AlO(OH),2H20 at the  first  plate  grows<br>
                                          2 through  pores in the second plate as fibres. Pores  support  and<br>
col1imate their directional growth perpendiculsr to reaction surface as per H2O vapour flow. In this design, the product callects  itself over the second plate. The product  which  grows<br>
effectively fast over a length through pores does not involve byproduct impurities by hydrolysis of other elements from surface<br>
in the first plate. Those are confined as residue to the first plate after the reaction and do not mix with the sample collected over the second plate•<br>
5<br><br>
The invention will now be explained in greater detail with the help  of the accompanying drawing where Fig.1 shows the  reaction<br>
chamber (i) comprising a bow (2), typically made of glass and the nascent  Al metal surface (3) and the second piste (4) of  Al  or<br>
any other material, parallel to plate (3). The pistes are provided with holes (5) typically 2—3 mm in diameter and the  two<br>
plates  (3,4) are spaced at a distance about 2 mm.  AlO(OH),2H2O<br>
                                                                                  2 fibres grow through the holes. The chamber is also provided  with<br>
a  water  vapour  inlet (6) at the bottom thereof,  and  a  water<br>
vapour  outlet (7) at the top. The Al0(0H),2H2O forms  as  fibres<br>
2<br>
 (8) through the pores-Expected  impurities  of  carbon, chromium  or  other  transition metals in commercial Al metal do not participate in formation  of<br>
long Al(OH).2H20 fibres in continuous hydrolysis of Al metal<br>
                    2 grow   fast  by  leaving  behind  the  impurities  unreacted or<br>
reoxidised in the base metal specimen. As a result, the sample recovered  from  fibres  over  th  second  plate  is  free   from<br>
impurities.  A chemical analysis by optica1  absorption  spectrum<br>
doss not show impurities of transition metal cations Mq+ to a ppm<br>
level. Also no signal appears in epr confirming the	absence of<br>
paramagnetic M cations.<br>
A specimen obtained alongwith byproduct impurities by	hydrolyzing<br>
a refreshed Al metal with nascent surface immersed in	water as  a<br>
whole  has characteristic absorption in visible to UV	region  and<br><br>
an  epr signal at g-value between 6.0 and 1.5 in Cr3+ and  other<br>
Mq+ intpurities. A similar result is found from the hydrolysis  in<br>
H2O vapour  or  in  a humid air without  using  a  separator  of<br>
parallel plates to separate away the byproduct impurities.<br>
The  invention will now be explained in greater detail  with  the<br>
help of the following non-1imiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The  proposed reaction process is carried out with a  pure (99%)<br>
aluminium metal plate with freshly created nascent  surfaces.  A<br>
self-induced reaction occurs as soon as it is put in cooled  watr<br>
vapour in the apparatus shown in Fig.1. It proceeds so fast  that<br>
the product of AlO(OH). H2O grows as fibres perpendicular to  the<br>
reaction surface. As long fibres as 130-200 mm grow in 25-100 ?m<br>
diameter in cooled H2O vapour at 20-300C. A refined Al2O3  powder,<br>
porosity 50% occurs after heating the fibres at 300-400 C.  The<br>
recovered Al2O3 powder is porous and as pure as upto a ppm level. EXAMPLE 2<br>
The reaction is repeated with aluminium alloys having 5-20 at %<br>
transition  metal  and  carbon,  A  relatively  slow   hydrolysis<br>
reaction  is noticed in cooled H2O vapour at 20-30 0C.  A  flowing<br>
H2O vapour  is used to activate the reaction.  A  refined  ?l2O3<br>
powder  (porosity ? 30%) free of carbon and other  components  of<br>
the  master alloy appears after heating the recovered  sample  at<br>
300-4000C  in  air. No hydrolysis has been observed in  case  the<br>
7<br><br>
	 - 8 - 	<br>
starting alloy has the carbon and other components larger than of 10 at %. EXAMPLE 3<br>
The reaction is further tested with waste scraps or plates of aluminium metal from machine shops. Refreshed metal surfaces, are introduced by a chemical treatment and/or mechanical deformation. The specimen is washed in , 1-2% HC1 and then surface treated  with<br>
0.1-0.2M  HgCl2   solution in water for 10-20  mins.  followed  by<br>
                 2 washed  in  water  to remove the adsorbed  chemicals.  It  yields<br>
reactive  surfaces to hydrolyse into AlO(OH).2H2O if immersed  in<br><br>
cooled  H2O vapour. A flowing H2O vapour is used  at 2.0-300C.  A<br>
refined Al2 O3 powder (porosity ? 40%) after heating the recovered 2 3<br>
Q<br>
sample  at 300-400 0C in air. The recovered Al2O3 is pure  to  ppm<br>
                                                      2 3 level.<br>
As  per x-ray diffraction, as received A1O(OH).H2O hydrolysis  of<br>
                                                          2 pure  Al metal or with impurities in H2O vapour is amorphous.  It<br>
                                              2 has  crystalline structure in hydrolysis in water.  An  amorphous<br>
Al2O3  powder results on heating amorphous sample at 300 to  400 0C<br>
in  air.  It  is porous with ? = 50 (80 to  90%  before  heating)<br>
porosity determined by difference in experimental and theoretical<br>
values  of  specific density. It absorbs as much N2 gas  as  500<br>
2<br>
cm3 /g. ??does not drop below ? 40% until the temperature is above<br>
     1200 0C. Particles 5-20 nm diameter are distributed through  pores<br>
of similar dimension.<br>
8<br><br>
- 9 -<br>
The method of obtaining pure Al2O3  powder by selective hydrolysis<br>
of Al metal in cooled H2O vapour, explored here is much more<br>
                            2 convenient and simple to conduct in a single step as compared  to<br>
conventional  hydrolysis with an electrochemical cell or  sol—gel<br>
method.  It yields  an ultra pure refined  Al2O3 .  This  is  not<br>
possible  by other  methods as such. It has many  advantages  and<br>
benefits that can make it a success in producing a specially pure and porous Al2O3 powder useful to fabricate a variety of nanocomposites for structural optical and other applications of catalysts, gas sensors, and surface coating. Doping of pores by transition metal or rare-earth cations generate new materials, for optical and electronic devices-<br><br>
