Building Modules<br>
This invention relates to a building module/ to<br>
buildings made from such modules and to the construction of<br>
buildings using such modules.<br>
There have been many prior proposals for constructing<br>
buildings from prefabricated units. In some proposals,<br>
panels are prefabricated and transported to a site for<br>
assembly into a building. The transport of the panels is '<br>
reasonably straightforward but the assembly on site<br>
involves a considerable amount of labour. In other<br>
proposals, an entire building is prefabricated and<br>
transported, often with some difficulty. Another option is<br>
to make a building from several prefabricated threedimensional<br>
modules and assemble the modules on site, but<br>
in that case both transport and assembly tend to be<br>
time-consuming and expensive. In an attempt to alleviate<br>
that problem it has been proposed to use a conventional<br>
freight container as a building module. For example,<br>
US 4599829 shows a building system formed of freight<br>
containers. The containers are each of the standard<br>
dimensions of a freight container and have corner castings<br>
at each of their corners. Those corner castings are<br>
provided at the standard spacings (a centre-to-centre<br>
spacing of about 2259 mm) so that the container can be<br>
handled in the same way as a conventional freight<br>
container.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an<br>
improved form of building module.<br>
It is a further object of the invention to provide an<br>
improved form of building made from such modules.<br>
It is a still further object of the invention to<br>
provide an improved method of constructing a building using<br>
such modules.<br>
According to a first particular aspect of the<br>
invention there is provided a building module having an<br>
exterior shape generally of a cuboid having side, end, top<br>
and bottom faces, and fabricated from metal, the module<br>
being hollow and defining a space of a size suitable for<br>
occupation by a person, the module including fastening<br>
elements to allow the module to be fastened to another<br>
adjacent module to allow for engagement by standard load<br>
handling equipment for handling freight containers, wherein<br>
the module has an overall exterior width greater than<br>
2700 mm and includes a first set of fastening elements in<br>
the region of a first end of the top of the module and a<br>
second set of fastening elements in the region of a second<br>
end of the top of the module, the fastening elements of<br>
each set including two fastening elements spaced apart from<br>
one another at a centre-to-centre spacing of about 2260 mm.<br>
Thus the invention provides a module which can be of a<br>
size that enables it to be transported but which is able to<br>
be fastened to other modules on site to form a larger<br>
building in a quick and simple manner. Furthermore by<br>
providing fastening elements at a centre-to-centre spacing<br>
of about 2260 mm, handling and transport of the module is<br>
greatly facilitated since the module can be handled and<br>
transported by the same equipment as handles and transports<br>
standard freight containers.<br>
Preferably the two fastening elements are<br>
symmetrically positioned on opposite sides of a central<br>
vertical plane of the module. In that case, they will both<br>
be inboard of the sides of the module and it is generally<br>
preferred that the set of fastening elements further<br>
include third and fourth elements at the opposite side<br>
edges of the top of the module. It is also preferred that<br>
each of the first and second sets of fastening elements<br>
comprises more than two fastening elements at locations<br>
spaced across the top of the module each fastening element<br>
being spaced from another fastening element at a centre-tocentre<br>
spacing of about 2260 mm.<br>
The first and second sets of fastening elements will<br>
usually be provided at the opposite ends of the module but<br>
that will not necessarily be the case and they may be<br>
u O<br>
provided inboard of the ends so as to be spaced apart from<br>
one another longitudinally by a standard distance. Thus<br>
reference is also made to the sets of fastening elements<br>
being in the regions of the ends of the module.<br>
In addition to providing first and second sets of<br>
fastening elements in the regions of the ends of the top of<br>
the module, third and fourth sets of fastening elements are<br>
preferably provided in the regions of the ends of the<br>
bottom of the module. The third and fourth sets of<br>
fastening elements may be arranged in the same way as<br>
described above in respect of the first and second sets of<br>
fastening elements.<br>
Preferably there are respective elongate members in<br>
the region of each of the eight edges of the cuboid and a<br>
plurality of metal panels secured to at least some of the<br>
elongate members. The elongate members are preferably of<br>
an open or hollow section, for example of hot or cold<br>
rolled or folded section, prefabricated section or<br>
rectangular hollow section. The elongate members and panels<br>
preferably together define a monocoque structure. The<br>
elongate members and panels are preferably made of steel.<br>
Such a construction enables a module as large as can<br>
readily be transported by road to be fabricated with<br>
sufficient strength that it is self supporting.<br>
Furthermore, when in use the module is fastened to other<br>
modules that can enhance their strengths so that a<br>
structurally strong building can be formed by fastening the<br>
modules together. Such a structure can have sufficient<br>
strength not only to support itself even as a multi-storey<br>
structure (consisting for example of more than 10 or 20<br>
storeys) but also to support other structural elements such<br>
as bridging elements or cantilevered elements without<br>
additional structural support.<br>
In most cases, it will be preferred that there are<br>
metal panels secured on all of the side and end faces of<br>
the cuboid, and preferably also on the top and bottom faces<br>
of the cuboid. At least some of the metal panels may be<br>
— 4 —<br>
corrugated. Such corrugations add to the strength and<br>
stiffness of the panel. One or more of the metal panels<br>
may, whether or not they are corrugated, be of composite<br>
construction and may for example include insulating<br>
material and/or an inner lining.<br>
Since the module is to form part of a building, it is<br>
preferable that it is fabricated with appropriate openings<br>
formed therein. The openings may be covered over for the<br>
purpose of transporting modules from a factory where they<br>
are fabricated to a site where they are to be used in a<br>
building; such temporarily closed openings in the module<br>
are hereby defined as "open" for the purpose of this<br>
specification. For example, one side face or each side<br>
face of the module may be partly closed by a panel and be<br>
partly open; similarly, one end face or each end face of<br>
the module may be partly closed by a panel and be partly<br>
open. The partly open face, or one of the partly open<br>
faces, may extend from a region at the bottom of the face<br>
to a region at the top of the face; that may provide an<br>
access route, for example a doorway, into the module for a<br>
person; of course, the doorway need not extend to the very<br>
top or the very bottom of the face. The partly open face,<br>
or one of the partly open faces, may extend upwardly from a<br>
region partway up the face. That may for example provide a<br>
window opening. One or more openings may also be provided<br>
in the top or bottom faces of the module, tor example to<br>
accommodate a staircase, lift or services within the<br>
module.<br>
The module may be fabricated as a completely empty<br>
shell and may remain in that state until after assembly<br>
into a building. More commonly, however, it will be<br>
preferable to carry out a degree of fitting out either in<br>
the factory or on site but prior to assembly into a<br>
building. For example, insulation may be added to walls,<br>
floors and ceilings, a plywood lining may be provided over<br>
the insulation, doors, windows and balconies may be added.<br>
Further examples may be electrical, power and lighting<br>
- 5 -<br>
cabling systems, heating and plumbing systems,<br>
telecommunications systems and other media communications<br>
systems. A cladding may also be added to one or more faces<br>
of the module. That cladding may be brickwork or some<br>
other cladding such as wood panelling/ metal sheet<br>
cladding. The cladding may be tile hung or in the form of<br>
a curtain wall. The cladding may provide a glass facade.<br>
Ties or other systems for holding the cladding in place may<br>
be provided. The ties may be retained in slots in a panel<br>
forming a face of the module; alternatively cladding<br>
fixings may be fixed to castings or plates of a frame of<br>
the module. A pod containing selected fittings may be<br>
installed in the module. For example there may be a<br>
kitchen pod containing kitchen fittings or a bathroom pod<br>
containing bathroom fittings. Such a pod may occupy a<br>
minor part only of the interior volume of the module.<br>
The ability of the module to be fastened to adjacent<br>
modules represents a key feature of the invention.<br>
Preferably the fastening elements of the module are<br>
suitable for fastening the module to an adjacent module<br>
placed alongside and/or to an adjacent module placed endto-<br>
end and/or to an adjacent module placed above or below.<br>
Thus modules may be fastened together in arrays of one, two<br>
or three dimensions. Most commonly the modules are<br>
fastened together in a two- or three-dimensional array with<br>
a plurality of storeys, each storey comprising a plurality<br>
of modules placed alongside one another.<br>
At least some of the fastening elements are preferably<br>
provided in the region of the eight corners of the module.<br>
As will be clear from the description below, those<br>
fastening elements may be the only fastening elements, but<br>
there may also be other fastening elements, for example<br>
partway along the top and/or bottom side edges of the<br>
module. Such a fastening element may transfer a building<br>
load to a foundation and/or provide a connection to an<br>
adjacent module.<br>
- 6 -<br>
In accordance with an especially preferred feature of<br>
the invention, at least some of the fastening elements are<br>
defined by hollow blocks with openings through which<br>
connector elements can be inserted. The fastening elements<br>
are preferably provided with openings in their top, side<br>
and end faces or bottom, side and end faces. The fastening<br>
elements are preferably welded to the elongate members.<br>
The fastening elements may be in the same general form as<br>
corner castings of freight containers and may be in<br>
accordance with ISO/TC-104-1161. Some or all of the<br>
fastening elements may, however, be of a design which<br>
differs from ISO/TC-104-1161 in order to meet the special<br>
requirements of a building module of the present invention.<br>
For example longer fastening elements may be used in some<br>
cases and where fastening elements are provided away from<br>
the corners of the module they may have a top or bottom<br>
opening and only one further aperture. Furthermore<br>
openings in the fastening elements may vary from the<br>
standard and, for example, a fastening element on the top<br>
of the module may have an opening in its end face of the<br>
kind provided in a standard container for the front face of<br>
a fastening element at the bottom of the container. That<br>
facilitates handling and transport of the module between a<br>
factory where it is fabricated and its final destination.<br>
By using the same fastening elements for transporting and<br>
handling the module as are used for securing one module to<br>
another an especially advantageous, economical and time<br>
saving system is provided.<br>
The connector elements and hollow blocks are<br>
preferably arranged such that after a connector element has<br>
been inserted into an opening in a hollow block it can be<br>
fastened in the opening. Thus the connector element<br>
preferably not only locates the module relative to the<br>
connector element but also fastens it to the connector<br>
element. Various fastening arrangements, including manual<br>
and automatic arrangements, may be employed, depending upon<br>
the particular circumstances. The connector elements and<br>
- 7 -<br>
hollow blocks may be arranged such that after a connector<br>
element has been inserted into an opening in a hollow block<br>
it can be fastened in the opening by a fastener entering<br>
the hollow block through another opening and engaging the<br>
connector element. In that manner a very strong and<br>
reliable fastening of the connector element to the block<br>
can be obtained. The connector elements may be fastened in<br>
the hollow blocks by fasteners screw threadedly engaging<br>
the connector elements in the hollow blocks.<br>
To connect one module to another which may be<br>
immediately above or below it, or alongside it, the<br>
connector elements preferably include a connector element<br>
that has a first part for insertion into an opening in one<br>
fastening element of one module and a second part for<br>
insertion into an opening in another fastening element of<br>
another module. In other cases it is desirable to connect<br>
four modules together, for example to connect two modules<br>
that are alongside one another to two further modules<br>
immediately above them to form what may be regarded as a<br>
two-dimensional array of modules. For that purpose the<br>
connector elements preferably include a connector element<br>
that has a first part for insertion into an opening in one<br>
fastening element of one module, a second part for<br>
insertion into an opening in another fastening element of<br>
another module, a third part for insertion into an opening<br>
in yet another fastening element of yet another module and<br>
a fourth part for insertion into an opening in a still<br>
further fastening element of a still further module. In<br>
further cases it is desirable to connect further modules in<br>
end-to-end relationship with some of the modules to form<br>
what may be regarded as a three-dimensional array of<br>
modules. For that purpose the connector elements<br>
preferably include a connector element having the first to<br>
fourth parts referred to above, but also fifth, sixth,<br>
seventh and eighth parts for insertion into openings in<br>
fastening elements of other modules.<br>
- 8 -<br>
Gaskets are preferably located between a connector<br>
element and a hollow block into which the connector element<br>
is inserted. Such a gasket can accommodate expansion or<br>
contraction of modules, relieve stresses and isolate<br>
acoustic vibration.<br>
Where reference is made herein to a corner casting, it<br>
should be understood that the term "casting" is employed<br>
because that is the standard terminology. Whilst such<br>
elements are usually formed by casting, it is not an<br>
essential feature of the invention that they are formed by<br>
casting. They may for example be fabricated from sheet<br>
steel. Furthermore where reference is made to a corner<br>
casting or a block it should be understood that, whilst<br>
such an element will usually be formed separately and<br>
subsequently fixed to the rest of the module for example by<br>
welding, it is within the scope of the invention for the<br>
corner casting or block to be formed as an integral part of<br>
the rest of the structure of the module.<br>
Standard load handling apparatus is designed to engage<br>
corner castings having a centre-to-centre spacing of about<br>
2260 mm (the precise spacing is usually intended to be<br>
2259 mm in accordance with the Standards and is therefore<br>
referred to here as "about 2260 mm"). In accordance with<br>
another aspect of the invention the overall exterior width<br>
of the module may be in the range of 2350 mm to 2500 mm,<br>
allowing for corner castings at the corners of the module<br>
to have a centre-to-centre spacing of about 2260 mm. In<br>
most applications, however, it will be desirable for the<br>
module to have a greater overall width. In that case it<br>
may be desirable to provide one or more additional<br>
fastening elements along each top and bottom end edge of<br>
the module; a single additional fastening element may be<br>
adequate and may be spaced at a centre-to-centre spacing of<br>
about 2260 mm from a fastening element at a corner of the<br>
module. That fastening element may be off centre or may be<br>
equispaced from corners at opposite sides of the module.<br>
Alternatively and as described above, a pair of additional<br>
- 9 -<br>
fastening elements may be provided symmetrically on either<br>
side of a central plane of the module along a top end edge<br>
of the module at a centre-to-centre spacing of about<br>
2260 mm. It is also desirable to provide a pair of<br>
additional fastening elements symmetrically on either side<br>
of a central plane of the module along a bottom end edge of<br>
the module at a centre-to-centre spacing of about 2260 mm.<br>
The additional fastening elements can then be used, for<br>
example, to secure a module on a road trailer/chassis or a<br>
transport chassis provided at a handling terminal. It is<br>
possible for a module to be less than 2400 mm in width; in<br>
that case it may be advantageous for modules to be<br>
connected together side-by-side for transport. For example<br>
two modules, each of about 1250 mm in width could be<br>
connected in this way.<br>
Especially in the case of relatively long modules, it<br>
may also be advantageous to place fastening elements<br>
partway along top and bottom side edges of the module.<br>
That may facilitate handling and transport and may also be<br>
used for connections to foundations or adjacent modules, as<br>
described above.<br>
Where the overall width of the module exceeds the<br>
range of 2350 mm to 2500 mm given above, it is preferably<br>
up to 1.5 or 2 times that width, and therefore preferably<br>
up to 4900 mm. If a module is not more than 3660 mm (1.5<br>
times standard width) that has the advantage that two<br>
modules placed side-by-side then occupy the space that<br>
would typically be allocated to three freight containers<br>
placed side-by-side, namely up to about 7400 mm total<br>
width. For modules greater than 3660 mm wide and up to<br>
4900 mm wide, the space used for one module would be the<br>
space typically allocated for two standard containers<br>
placed side-by-side. That can for example facilitate<br>
transport of the modules by a container ship or other<br>
vessel.<br>
Other dimensions of the module may also be matched to<br>
those of a freight container. Such containers are commonly<br>
- 10 -<br>
of lengths of 10 ft (2991 mm), 20 ft (6058 mm), 30 ft<br>
(9125 mm), 40 ft (12192 mm), 45 ft (13716 mm) or,<br>
especially in USA and Canada, up to 53 ft (17154 mm). The<br>
overall length of the module is most likely to be in the<br>
range of 6000 mm to 6100 mm, in the range of 12100 mm to<br>
12300 mm or in the range of 13600 mm to 13800 mm, those<br>
being the most commonly used dimensions for freight<br>
containers.<br>
For lengths of module greater than 40 ft (12192 mm),<br>
fastening elements are preferably provided at the same<br>
positions longitudinally as on a standard 40 ft (12192 mm)<br>
container to allow lifting and vessel stowage using<br>
equipment of standard dimensions and with standard vessel<br>
stowage arrangements.<br>
Preferably the exterior of the module is fitted with a<br>
plurality of additional fastening elements for interfacing<br>
with an external wall cladding system and/or a roofing<br>
system. In that way the addition of a wall cladding system<br>
or a roofing system may be greatly facilitated. The<br>
additional fastening elements are preferably secured to one<br>
or more of the elongate members. Such additional fastening<br>
elements can be of the same or different design from the<br>
fastening elements that are, or act as, the standard<br>
castings of a freight container. The fastening elements<br>
may also be used for fixing other structural elements such<br>
as balconies, corridors, stairs or bridging elements to the<br>
module.<br>
The description above has been provided principally<br>
with reference to a building module according to the first<br>
particular aspect of the invention. It should be<br>
understood that the many features described above can also<br>
be incorporated advantageously in a module which differs in<br>
some respect from the module of the first particular aspect<br>
of the invention, for example because it has an overall<br>
exterior width of less than 2700 mm. According to a broad<br>
aspect of the invention there is provided a building module<br>
having an exterior shape generally of a cuboid having side,<br>
- 11 -<br>
end, top and bottom faces, and fabricated from metal, the<br>
module being hollow and defining a space of a size suitable<br>
for occupation by a person, the module including fastening<br>
elements to allow the module to be fastened to another<br>
adjacent module.<br>
Such a module may further incorporate any of the<br>
features described above of the module according to the<br>
first particular aspect of the invention.<br>
An important aspect of the invention is that the<br>
modules are not usually employed individually but rather<br>
are fastened together as a multiplicity (a "multiplicity"<br>
as used herein refers to three or more) of modules. Thus<br>
the present invention further provides a multiplicity of<br>
modules for fastening together to form part or all of a<br>
building, each module having an exterior shape generally of<br>
a cuboid having side, end, top and bottom faces, being<br>
hollow and defining a space suitable for occupation by a<br>
person.<br>
The modules may all be of the same dimensions but it<br>
may also be the case that their dimensions vary, especially<br>
in terms of their widths and lengths. Conveniently, at<br>
least the majority of the modules have a width which is<br>
approximately one, two or three times a given unit width.<br>
For example the given unit width may be 1220 mm, some<br>
modules may have a width of about 2440 mm and some modules<br>
may have a width of about 3660 mm and some may even have a<br>
width of about 4880 mm. Similarly, at least the majority<br>
of the modules may have a length which is approximately<br>
one, two, three, four or five times a given unit length.<br>
In particular applications it may be desirable for a module<br>
to be of exceptionally short length and there may therefore<br>
be at least one module which has a length which is less<br>
than one fifth of the length of the longest module. The<br>
short module may be transported with another longer module<br>
and result in a combined length that matches a standard<br>
length and therefore facilitates transport.<br>
- 12 -<br>
At least the majority of the modules may be of<br>
approximately the same height. That may be advantageous in<br>
the case of a group of modules for use in the same<br>
building. The preferred height of module may vary from one<br>
design of building to another, or from one part of a<br>
building to another. A module may also be provided in a<br>
flat pack form and sides of the module erected on site.<br>
Preferably there is further provided a foundation<br>
interface having a lower face for resting on foundations<br>
and an upper face carrying connector elements for<br>
engagement with fastening elements on modules to fasten the<br>
modules to the foundation interface. The lower face of the<br>
foundation interface can be connected to the foundations in<br>
a conventional manner and is then able to provide the<br>
special fastening arrangement for engaging fastening<br>
elements on the modules. The connector elements can engage<br>
the fastening elements in the same manner as described<br>
above in respect of the connector elements connecting two<br>
modules together. The foundation interface may be in the<br>
form of one or more rectangular rings, opposite ends of a<br>
module resting on opposite sides of a ring. An alternative<br>
arrangement is to fix the connector elements in appropriate<br>
locations directly onto conventional foundations.<br>
Similarly an inter storey interface may be provided<br>
for placing between storeys of modules, the inter storey<br>
interface having a lower face carrying connector elements<br>
for engagement with fastening elements on modules in a<br>
storey immediately below the interface and having an upper<br>
face carrying connector elements for engagement with<br>
fastening elements on modules in a storey immediately above<br>
the interface. Again, the connector elements can engage<br>
the fastening elements of the modules in the same manner as<br>
described above in respect of the connector elements<br>
connecting two modules together. The inter storey<br>
interface may also be in the form of one or more<br>
rectangular rings.<br>
- 13 -<br>
Each module of the multiplicity of modules may include<br>
any of the features referred to above.<br>
The present invention still further provides a<br>
building including a multiplicity of modules as defined<br>
above, the modules being fastened together to form part or<br>
all of a building with aligned openings in adjacent walls<br>
of adjacent modules to allow a person to move from one<br>
module to another.<br>
The modules of the building may be fastened together<br>
in side-by-side relationship and/or in end-to-end<br>
relationship and/or there may be a plurality of storeys of<br>
modules, the modules in one storey being fastened to<br>
modules in an adjacent upper and/or lower storey.<br>
The connected modules may provide the majority or all<br>
of the structural strength of the building, other<br>
structural elements such as cladding, roofing, balconies<br>
and stairwells being supported from the modules. For<br>
example, a roofed space and bridging corridors may be<br>
provided between two spaced apart groups of modules and<br>
supported by the modules. Another possibility is to<br>
connect a module that is without sides, ends or a top to<br>
adjacent modules to form a floor above which there may be<br>
open or covered space.<br>
The invention still further provides a method of<br>
constructing a building at a site, the method comprising<br>
the following steps:<br>
fabricating a plurality of modules at a location<br>
remote from the site, each module being generally in the<br>
shape of a cuboid and including fastening elements/<br>
transporting the fabricated modules to the site, and<br>
fastening together the fastening elements of modules<br>
to connect the modules together with aligned openings in<br>
adjacent walls of adjacent modules to allow a person to<br>
move from one module to another.<br>
Preferably the fabricated modules are engaged by their<br>
fastening elements to secure them during transport. That<br>
facilitates the securing of the modules while they are<br>
- 14 -<br>
being transported. Similarly, it is preferred that the<br>
modules are engaged by their fastening elements to move<br>
them into their final positions at the site.<br>
The building that is constructed by the method of the<br>
invention is preferably a building comprising a<br>
multiplicity of modules and being as defined above.<br>

Fig.l shows a typical module in accordance with the<br>
invention. The module 10 is in the shape of a cuboid<br>
having opposite end faces 11 (only one of which is visible<br>
in Fig. 1), opposite side faces 12 (only one of which is<br>
visible in Fig. 1), a top face 13 and a bottom face 14. In<br>
the case of the example shown in Fig. 1, the module has an<br>
opening 15 in its side face extending from a region at the<br>
bottom of the face to a region at the top of the face, and<br>
an opening 16 in its end face extending upwardly from a<br>
region partway up the face. Panels 15A and 16A are<br>
provided to close the openings 15 and 16 respectively prior<br>
to final installation of the module. The opening 15 is of<br>
sufficient height to allow a person to walk through<br>
- 17 -<br>
unobstructed and the opening 16 is of a suitable size and<br>
position to provide a window. Similar openings are<br>
provided in the other side and end faces not visible in<br>
Fig. 1.<br>
The module 10 has a steel monocoque shell structure<br>
formed by four horizontal side rails 17, four horizontal<br>
end rails 18 and four vertical posts 19, all of open<br>
section, and by corrugated steel panels 20 welded between<br>
the rails.<br>
At each corner of the module 10, a fastening element<br>
in the form of a respective corner casting 21 is provided.<br>
Each corner casting 21 is of the kind conventionally found<br>
on freight containers and is of hollow construction with<br>
external top, side and end apertures 22 providing access<br>
into the interior of the casting. Each casting 21 is made<br>
generally in accordance with ISO/TC-104-1161 but with<br>
variations in the external length of the casting in some<br>
cases and with the front apertures of the upper castings<br>
being in accordance with the dimensions set by the standard<br>
for the fron apertures of the bottom castings.<br>
Fig. 2 shows one particular internal wall construction<br>
that may be employed in the module of Fig. 1. In the<br>
example shown steel studding 23 of "L" shaped section is<br>
stitch welded to the interior of a steel panel 20, boards<br>
of insulation 24 are laid between the studding 23 and<br>
plywood 25 is then fixed to the studding 23 over the<br>
insulation 24.<br>
Fig. 3 shows one particular floor construction that<br>
may be employed in the module of Fig. 1. Steel floor<br>
joists of inverted "L" shaped section 30 (or alternatively<br>
of "C" section) are fixed over the corrugated steel panel<br>
20, boards of insulation 31 are laid between the joists 30,<br>
and plywood 32 is then fixed to the joists 30 over the<br>
insulation 31.<br>
Fig. 4 shows schematically the assembly of four<br>
modules. A lower storey of modules 10A and 10B, each<br>
similar to the module 10 of Fig. 1, have been placed in<br>
- 18 -<br>
position together with a module IOC which is directly above<br>
the module 10A. Fig. 4 shows a fourth module 10D being<br>
lowered into position on top of the module 10B to form a<br>
building comprising four modules. The manner in which the<br>
modules are fastened together is described below.<br>
Fig. 5 shows one possible layout for a storey of<br>
modules, in this case providing bedroom accommodation that<br>
might typically be used for hotel, key workers or students.<br>
The storey shown comprises a single row of modules<br>
comprising two sets of four modules 50 with another module<br>
51 interposed between each set and with further modules 52A<br>
and 52B at respective ends of the row of modules. The<br>
modules 50 within a given set are placed directly alongside<br>
one another without any stagger whilst the module 51, which<br>
is the same size and shape as the modules 50, is offset<br>
from the adjacent sets of modules 50. The further<br>
modules 52A and 52B are of a different shape from the<br>
modules 50 and 51 being shorter and wider.<br>
Each of the modules 50 may be of the general structure<br>
shown in Fig. 1 with the openings 16 in the end faces of<br>
the modules providing exterior window openings and the<br>
openings 15 in the side faces of the modules allowing the<br>
creation of a central corridor 53 through the modules. As<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the modules 50 are internally divided by<br>
partitions 54 having doors 55 to define the walls of the<br>
corridor 53 and bedrooms 56 on each side of the corridor,<br>
two bedrooms being thereby created within each module 50.<br>
In the example shown, the module 51 with openings in<br>
its side faces aligned with the corridor 53 contains at one<br>
end of the module a staircase 57 allowing access to a lower<br>
and/or upper storey through an opening in the roof and/or<br>
floor of the module 51. At the opposite end of the<br>
module 51 there is a space which may be used for services<br>
and/or a lift. In the particular example shown the further<br>
modules 52A and 52B are kitchens and each have three<br>
windows 58. The storey is shown without any external<br>
access but of course it should be understood that if<br>
- 19 -<br>
external access is required, that can readily be provided,<br>
for example by providing an opening in an end face of the<br>
module 51 and forming a doorway in the opening.<br>
Each of the bedrooms created in the modules 50 is<br>
shown fitted with a bathroom pod 59. Such pods which may<br>
for example include a toilet, washbasin and shower are<br>
known per se as prefabricated units and will not be<br>
described further here.<br>
Figs. 6A to 6D show possible variations of the basic<br>
configuration of a module. In Fig. 6A a module 60 with<br>
open end faces, a full height opening 61 in one side and a<br>
window opening 62 in the opposite side is shown. In<br>
Fig. 6B a module 63 with an open side face, an opposite<br>
closed side face and two end faces with window openings 64<br>
is shown. In Fig. 6C a module 65 with an open side face,<br>
an open end face and with window openings 66 formed in the<br>
other side and end faces is shown. Finally, in Fig. 6D a<br>
module 67 with all its end and side faces open is shown.<br>
Whilst certain particular configurations have been shown by<br>
way of example, it will be understood that many other<br>
configurations are possible.<br>
The modules shown in Figs. 6A to 6D are approximately<br>
1.5 times wider than the module 10 shown in Fig. 1. As<br>
will be described below, the corner castings 21 of a<br>
standard freight container are spaced apart by a standard<br>
width (2259 mm centre-to-centre spacing) to allow the<br>
container to be handled easily by conventional load<br>
handling apparatus and engaged by fastening devices on<br>
trailers. With a wider module, that spacing for<br>
conventional load handling apparatus can no longer be<br>
achieved by the corner castings 21 provided at the corners<br>
of the modules and an additional casting 68 is therefore<br>
provided along each top and bottom end rail 18 at the<br>
standard spacing from one of the corner castings 21. That<br>
enables the module to be readily handled by load handling<br>
apparatus engaging the additional casting 68 and the<br>
appropriate corner casting 21 on the same end rail 18. A<br>
- 20 -<br>
pair of extra castings 69 are also provided on the bottom<br>
end rails 18 and on the top end rails 18, symmetrically<br>
positioned on opposite sides of a central vertical<br>
longitudinal plane through the module, at the standard<br>
separation (2259 mm centre-to-centre spacing). Those extra<br>
castings 69 allow a module to be fastened to standard<br>
fasteners on a road trailer with the module symmetrically<br>
placed on the road trailer and to be lifted symmetrically<br>
by standard lifting equipment.<br>
It will be understood that the castings 68 and 69, not<br>
being at corners of the module have fewer apertures and<br>
indeed the castings 69 may have apertures only in their end<br>
faces or bottom/top faces if that is all that is required<br>
to secure them to a road trailer and lifting equipment.<br>
In addition to employing modules in accordance with<br>
the invention as described above it is possible to use<br>
extra modules of special design to suit particular<br>
circumstances. For example it may be desirable to create a<br>
high open space within a building or on a side of a<br>
building and in that case an arrangement of the kind<br>
exemplified in Fig. 7 may be employed. The structure shown<br>
in Fig. 7 is an open span structure formed from a lower<br>
module 71 having a bottom face 72 and end faces 73 but no<br>
side faces and no top face, and an upper module 74 having a<br>
top face 75 and end faces 76 but no side faces and no<br>
bottom face. The modules 71 and 74 may be constructed as<br>
rigid structures or they may be formed from separately<br>
detachable panels allowing a flat pack style of transport.<br>
It may be noted that each module is provided with corner<br>
castings 21 at its eight corners.<br>
An important feature of the described embodiments of<br>
the present invention is the fastening system that enables<br>
modules to be fastened together on site quickly,<br>
economically and securely. One exemplary form of that<br>
fastening system is shown in Figs. 8A to 8C and 9A to 9G<br>
and will now be described with reference to those drawings<br>
in which Figs. 8A to 8C provide an overview of the system<br>
- 21 -<br>
and Figs. 9A to 9G provide details of the various parts of<br>
the system.<br>
Referring first to Fig. 8A, which is an exploded view,<br>
there are shown a corner casting 21A of a lower module, a<br>
corner casting 2 IB of an adjacent lower module, a corner<br>
casting 21C of an upper module stacked directly on top of<br>
the module with the casting 21A and a corner casting 2ID of<br>
an upper module stacked directly on top of the module with<br>
the casting 21B. As will be understood, only the corner<br>
castings of the modules and not the remaining parts of the<br>
modules are shown in the interests of clarity.<br>
A connector element 81 comprises in a single casting a<br>
central plate part 82, lugs 83A and 83B projecting<br>
downwardly from the plate part 82 and lugs 83C and 83D<br>
projecting upwardly from the plate part 82. The lugs 83A<br>
and 83B pass through apertures 84 in a lower gasket 85 and<br>
into the apertures 22 in the tops of the castings 21A<br>
and 21B. Similarly the lugs 83C and 83D pass through<br>
apertures 86 in an upper gasket 87 (identical to the lower<br>
gasket 85) and into the apertures 22 in the bottoms of the<br>
castings 21C and 21D.<br>
Once the connector element 81 is installed as<br>
described, the corner castings 21A to 2ID are positioned as<br>
shown in Fig. 8B. Lock down plates 88A and 88B, each<br>
carrying a pair of lugs 89A and 89B are then able to be<br>
inserted into the end apertures 22 of the corner castings.<br>
Fig. 8B shows the plates 88A and 88B about to enter the<br>
apertures.<br>
The plates 88A and 88B have holes 90 which pass<br>
through the plates and the lugs 89A and 89B and align with<br>
threaded holes 91 in the lugs 83A to 83D of the connector<br>
element 81 when the corner castings 21A to 21C are properly<br>
assembled together. Then, as a final stage of fastening,<br>
bolts 92A to 92D with washers 93A to 93D are passed through<br>
the holes 90 and into screw threaded engagement in the<br>
holes 91 of the lugs 83A to 83D. The parts are then in the<br>
position shown in Fig. 8C.<br>
- 22 -<br>
Figs. 9A to 9G illustrate the assembly just described<br>
in more detail. It uses a connector element of the kind<br>
shown in Fig. 9C having a central plate part 82 and four<br>
lugss 83A, 83B, 83C and 83D (of which only 83C and 83D are<br>
visible in Fig. 9C). That connector element is shown in<br>
perspective view in Fig. 9H.<br>
It will be noted that the fastening system just<br>
described is suitable for joining four modules at<br>
respective adjacent corners. It will be appreciated that<br>
in other parts of the building, for example at a corner,<br>
there will be only one upper and one lower corner casting<br>
so that a connector element with only one lug on each side<br>
will be required. Fig. 9J shows such a connector element<br>
having a central plate part 82 and lugs 83A and 83C.<br>
Similarly, it will be appreciated that in some parts of a<br>
building having a three-dimensional array of modules it<br>
will be desirable to provide a connector element with four<br>
lugs on each side. Fig. 9K shows such a connector element<br>
having a central plate part 82 and lugs 83A to 83H.<br>
It should be understood that whilst one particular<br>
locking system has been shown and described with reference<br>
to Figs. 8A and 8B and 9A to 9G, other locking arrangements<br>
may be provided, for example to suit the accessibility of<br>
the connecting element. The lugs of the connector elements<br>
also ensure accurate alignment of modules as the modules<br>
are positioned on a partly constructed building.<br>
Figs. 10 and 11 show certain additional features which<br>
may be incorporated in a module according to the invention.<br>
For example, if it is desired to provide a brick covering<br>
over a face of the module, slots 101 may be provided in the<br>
steel panel 20 forming the end face, "T" shaped brick ties<br>
102 may be slotted into the slots 101 and a brick shelf 103<br>
may be fixed at the bottom of the end face. As shown in<br>
Fig. 10 the brickwork may be formed around a window 104.<br>
Fig. 11 also shows how pods, for example a bathroom pod or<br>
a kitchen pod, can be inserted through a side opening in<br>
- 23 -<br>
the module to allow installation of such a module on site<br>
or prior to delivery to site.<br>
Fig. 12A shows one example of a module, which may for<br>
example be the module 52A shown in Fig. 5. Most of the<br>
features of the module have been described above and are<br>
referenced by the same reference numerals in Fig. 12A. A<br>
further feature shown clearly in Fig. 12A is the provision<br>
along all the horizontal rails of fixing points 120 to<br>
which cladding systems, roof support systems or the like<br>
may be fixed. In one particular example the module 52A<br>
would have the following dimensions:<br>
overall exterior width, w: 3660 mm<br>
overall exterior length, 1: 6096 mm<br>
overall exterior height, h: 2900 ram<br>
spacing between fixing points 120, s: 900 mm<br>
centre-to-centre distance of additional<br>
casting 68 from further<br>
corner casting on same end rail, d: 2259 mm<br>
centre-to-centre separation of extra<br>
castings 69, x: 2259 mm<br>
It will be understood from the description above that<br>
the castings may be arranged in various ways according to<br>
the size of the module and the handling and connecting<br>
facilities that are required. Fig. 12B shows one<br>
especially advantageous arrangement of castings at an end<br>
of a module. In the arrangement shown there are four<br>
corner castings 21, a further four castings 69A, 69B, 69C<br>
and 69D along the top of the end of the module and a still<br>
further four castings 69A', 69B', 69C' and 69D' along the<br>
bottom of the end of the module. The other end of the<br>
module has the same arrangement of castings.<br>
The castings are arranged symmetrically about the<br>
central vertical plane of the module indicated by the<br>
centre line C/L in Fig. 12B. Each of the castings 21, 69<br>
is arranged at the standard spacing from another casting,<br>
that is at a distance marked D in Fig. 12B of 2438 mm<br>
measured from the outer edges of the castings (resulting in<br>
- 24 -<br>
a centre-to-centre spacing of the apertures in the castings<br>
of about 2260 mm).<br>
Usually, if the module is to be lifted by standard<br>
equipment for handling freight containers, then as shown in<br>
Fig. 12C and illustrated by solid line arrows, a<br>
spreader 95 will be lowered to engage the castings 69A<br>
and 69D at each end of the module. The weight of the<br>
module can then be evenly distributed on the spreader.<br>
Similarly, when locking down the module on, for example, a<br>
trailer chassis the module can be symmetrically positioned<br>
by using the castings 69A' and 69D' as implied by the<br>
dotted line arrows 96 in Fig. 12C. It should be noted,<br>
however, that another possibility is to position the module<br>
asymmetrically by using either of the castings 69B'<br>
or 69C', together with one of the corner castings 21; the<br>
dotted line arrows 97 in Fig. 12C illustrate this<br>
arrangement which may be useful when the module is stored<br>
on a container ship or is used in a building where it is<br>
desired to offset the modules in one storey from those in<br>
an adjacent storey.<br>
It will be appreciated that although in Fig. 12B<br>
additional castings are shown only at the ends of the<br>
modules, they may also be provided partway along the<br>
lengths of the top and bottom side edges of the modules.<br>
Furthermore they may be provided away from the edges of any<br>
of the faces of the module if desired, for example for<br>
fixing other structural elements to the building. Thus,<br>
the castings may be in the region of the ends rather than<br>
at the ends of the module.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a module such as the module 10 of Fig. 1<br>
being placed on a foundation interface ring 130. The<br>
ring 130 is placed on an appropriate foundation and locked<br>
to it in an appropriate manner known per se. On the upper<br>
face of the ring 130 there are upwardly projecting<br>
connectors 131 of similar form to the connector elements 81<br>
but with lugs 132 projecting on one side only from a<br>
plate 133 welded to the ring 130. In the example shown the<br>
- 25 -<br>
connectors 131 each have a single lug 132 but it will be<br>
understood from the description above with reference to<br>
Figs. 8A to 8C and 9A to 9G that they may also have a pair<br>
of lugs. The lugs 132 have screw threaded holes (not<br>
visible in Fig. 13) for receiving bolts that secure<br>
modified versions of the lock down plates 88A and 88B<br>
described above (the plates being modified such that each<br>
carries a single lug only with the bolt passing through the<br>
lug and into the screw threaded hole in the connector 131).<br>
It will be noted that the ring 130 is dimensioned to match<br>
the length of a module so that opposite ends of the module<br>
can be fastened to opposite sides of the ring. Special<br>
manual or automatic twist lock or other mechanically locked<br>
down connectors that can directly connect the modules to<br>
the foundations may be provided.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a module 140 of similar dimensions to<br>
the module 10 described above together with another<br>
module 141 of the same height and width, but a much shorter<br>
length connected at the end of the module 10. The<br>
combination of the two modules preferably has a standard<br>
length, for example 40 ft (12192mm). Such an end-to-end<br>
connection may provide a useful way of transporting the two<br>
modules together even if the short module is subsequently<br>
used in a different location in the building.<br>
Fig. 15 shows a section through the floor, ceiling and<br>
external walls of two modules 151 and 152 stacked on top of<br>
one another. In the example shown windows 153 and 154 are<br>
provided in the modules 151 and 152 and brickwork 155 is<br>
provided on the exterior wall between the windows. The<br>
lower module 152 is shown with a pressed steel corrugated<br>
roof pan 156 below which are insulating panels 157A, a<br>
plywood lining 158A and a plasterboard finish 159A. The<br>
insulation panels 157A are held in place by XXL" shaped<br>
sections 160A welded to the roof pan 156. In a similar way<br>
the floor of the upper module 151 comprises a pressed steel<br>
corrugated bottom face 161 on which insulating panels 157B<br>
are laid and secured in place by "L" shaped sections 160B<br>
- 26 -<br>
welded to the steel corrugated face 161. A plywood floor<br>
158B is laid over the panels 157B.<br>
Fig. 16A shows a section (in plan view) through one<br>
example of an external wall structure. A corrugated steel<br>
skin 163 provides the structural strength and on the inside<br>
carries insulating panels 157C held in place by "L" shaped<br>
sections 160C. A plywood lining 158C is secured over the<br>
panels 157C and a plasterboard finish 159C is added. On<br>
the outside the steel skin 163 has a layer of<br>
insulation 164 and outside that brickwork 165 held to the<br>
skin 163 by ties which engage in slots 166 formed in<br>
plates 167 welded to the steel skin 163.<br>
Fig. 16B shows a section (in plan view) through one<br>
example of adjoining internal walls 168A, 168B of adjacent<br>
modules. Each wall is of the same construction including a<br>
corrugated steel skin 163 which is exposed on its outer<br>
face confronting the adjacent module and on its inner face<br>
carries insulating panels 157D held in place by "L" shaped<br>
sections 160D welded to the skin 163. A plywood<br>
lining 158D is secured over the panels 157D and a<br>
plasterboard finish 159D is added.<br>
Whilst certain particular embodiments of the invention<br>
have been described, it should be understood that these are<br>
of course only examples of many different possible<br>
arrangements. In the illustrated examples an upper storey<br>
of modules is placed directly above a lower storey and the<br>
modules in the upper storey are the same size as the<br>
modules in the lower storey. It should be understood,<br>
however, that this need not be the case. For example, the<br>
modules in the upper storey may be bigger or smaller than<br>
the modules directly below and/or the modules in one storey<br>
may be offset from the modules in another storey. In cases<br>
of this kind it is of course desirable for modules to have<br>
fastening elements partway along their edges so that the<br>
modules in one storey can be connected securely to the<br>
modules in another storey.<br>
- 27 -<br>
In the particular example of buildings illustrated,<br>
bedroom accommodation is provided. It will be understood<br>
that the modules may be employed in a variety of<br>
applications including housing, hotels, hostels, hospitals,<br>
care homes, and educational, social and leisure facilities,<br>
and in commercial, penal or industrial premises. Other<br>
applications include basements and cellars, car parking and<br>
storage. The accommodation provided by a module can take<br>
many forms including bedrooms, living rooms, dining rooms,<br>
kitchens, bathrooms, corridors, service voids, storage,<br>
bicycle sheds, stairwells, lift shafts, launderettes,<br>
community spaces and offices.<br>
The buildings that are formed from the modules can be<br>
permanent building structures with a life expectancy as<br>
great or greater than those of a conventional building, and<br>
they can also easily be extended, converted or modified.<br>
Furthermore, if desired, a building can readily be<br>
dismantled and the modules moved elsewhere.<br>
It will be understood that appropriate services can<br>
also be provided in the modules. Services may be run under<br>
floors, above ceilings through specially formed ducts etc.<br>
The modules may be provided with openings in appropriate<br>
locations to allow services to pass from one module to<br>
another.<br>
Fig. 17A shows a large module 200 with various<br>
auxiliary parts displaced, as shown by dotted lines, to<br>
enable the construction to be better understood. The<br>
module 200 includes panels 201 in its top and 201' in its<br>
bottom, which are removed on site to provide a vertical<br>
passageway for a service duct. It also includes bracing/<br>
sealing panels 202, 203 and 204 which add strength to the<br>
module while it is being transported and lifted but can be<br>
removed on site to provide openings, and it further<br>
includes brick shelves 205 fixed along the bottom of the<br>
side to support brick cladding.<br>
Fig. 17B shows two of the modules 200 of Fig. 17A<br>
mounted one on top of another, together with a further,<br>
- 28 -<br>
smaller module 300. The smaller module 300 has a side<br>
opening that corresponds to a side opening in the<br>
module 200, has a brick shelf 305 and a bracing panel 302.<br>
The modules are shown connected to foundations 99.<br>
Fig. ISA shows how the ground floor of the building<br>
shown in Fig. 17B may be fitted out. The building includes<br>
door openings 211 and 311 to the outside at one end of the<br>
building and window openings 212 and 312 at the other end.<br>
As shown there is provided on the ground floor a living<br>
room 315, a kitchen 215, a bathroom 216 and a first bedroom<br>
217. On the first floor there is a second bedroom 218 and<br>
a bathroom 219 together with a third bedroom 220 which has<br>
a door onto a roof terrace 316 formed by part of the top of<br>
the module 300. At one end of the first floor a balcony<br>
221 is connected to the upper module 200 and at the other<br>
end there is a large window. Figs. 18C and 18D show<br>
