SIEGENIA-AUBI KG GERMAN Company INDUSTRIESTRASSE 1-3, 57234 WILNSDORF, GERMANY<br><br>
PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
The invention relates to a roller bolt according to the precharacterizing clause of claims 1 and 11.<br>
Roller bolts of the abovementioned type are already known. For example, DE 29 03 837 C3 reveals a roller bolt which has a metal roller guided on a collar bolt. The inside of the roller is provided with scores or grooves which are offset in the longitudinal direction and serve for the engagement of a securing element in the form of an expanding ring. As a result, the roller can be set in different positions relative to the collar bolt.<br>
In order to obtain even lower friction during the interaction of the roller and the locking web, it is proposed, according to DE 29 03 099 Al, to provide a plastic roller instead of the metal roller. The elastic properties of the plastic permit the securing element to be integrated in the roller. To this end, an undercut is provided on the roller and is engaged in by a projection of the collar bolt. In order to be able to cover different areas of use in respect of the closing pressure, it is provided that rollers with different outside diameters, such that they can be exchanged, if appropriate, can be assigned to the collar bolt.<br>
It has been shown in this case that the comparatively thin roller may be damaged under some circumstances, in particular at the thinner longitudinal ends. This is the case in particular with longitudinally displaceable locking pins which engage in positionally fixed locking webs and, in the process, do not bear along their entire height against said locking webs. The roller then only comes into contact with the locking web by means of the end section placed in the direction of the free end, and therefore comparatively high forces act on a surface which is only small.<br>
It has therefore already been proposed in DE 27 51 813 C2 to realize the free end of the sleeve with a thickened portion such that the sleeve obtains a shape in the manner of a mushroom head.<br><br><br>
Although DE 6937034 Ul has already proposed to reinforce or to coat locking members of casement or leaf closures with low-friction material, for example polytetrafluoroethylene, it is not envisaged using said coating simultaneously also as a guide element for an adjustment means.<br>
DE-A 27 51 813 has also disclosed a casement or leaf closure for windows or doors, the locking pin of which is provided on its circumferential surface with a casing of wear-resistant material, which casing either comprises a ring pressed on in a rotationally fixed manner or a sleeve or else a circumferential coating made of plastic, for example polyamide or polycarbonate, and achieves an improvement in the sliding properties for the locking pins upon interaction with the locking webs on the frame. A similar solution is also found in DE 32 03 421 Al.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of further developing a roller bolt to the effect that it can firstly be produced and fitted cost-effectively but, secondly, reduces the friction on the locking web and is more resistant to damage.<br>
Corresponding solutions are provided in the characterizing parts of claims 1 and 11.<br>
The configuration of the roller as a metal sleeve which is covered by a plastic affords the advantages of a stable configuration and avoids the direct interaction of the metal of the roller and of the locking web. Furthermore, the roller is provided with sufficient stability and therefore remains free from damage even under extreme conditions. The solution provided in claim 11 creates a solution with reduced friction which avoids damage to the roller in the region of that section of the free end of the roller bolt which is subjected to a higher load.<br>
Further  advantageous   configurations   emerge   from claims 2 to 10 and 12 to 13.<br><br><br>
A particularly advantageous development is provided by the metal sleeve having an outwardly pointing collar placed toward the free end of the collar bolt. The more sensitive end surface of the roller can thereby be additionally protected.<br>
Furthermore, it is provided here that the collar has the thickness of the plastic casing, and therefore, the plastic casing is completely covered in the direction of the end surface.<br>
In order to produce the roller, it can be provided that the plastic casing is produced by encapsulating the metal sleeve by injection molding. If the metal sleeve is provided with bores which are distributed over the circumferential surface and in which the plastic casing engages at least in some regions, an optimum bond of the plastic casing and the metal sleeve can be achieved.<br>
In order also to reduce the friction between the collar bolt and the roller, it can furthermore be provided that, in the region of the bores, the plastic casing protrudes over the inside of the metal sleeve in the direction of the collar bolt. Direct interaction of the metal surfaces is therefore also avoided here.<br>
In order also to connect the casing and the metal sleeve to each other in the longitudinal direction in an interlocking manner, it is provided that the metal sleeve is provided with at least one radial constriction of the circumferential surface. The constriction may have different forms. A particularly preferred configuration also provides an outwardly pointing collar here.<br>
As an alternative to encapsulating the metal sleeve by injection molding, it can be provided that the plastic casing is formed by a plastic sleeve which is fitted onto the roller in a rotationally fixed manner. For example, the plastic sleeve can be shrunk on such that the plastic casing sits firmly on the metal sleeve.<br><br><br>
If, at its end pointing away from the free end of the collar bolt, the plastic casing has a constriction, which protrudes inward over the inside diameter of the metal sleeve and can be assigned at least to one circumferential groove of the collar bolt, then the fastening of the roller can be facilitated and, if appropriate, can even take place without a tool.<br>
For the alternative solution according to claim 11, it is also advantageous if the securing element comprises an annular crown which can be fixed to the collar bolt by radially inwardly pointing latching projections. As a result, in addition to fastening the roller to the collar bolt, protection of the end surface is also achieved.<br>
In order also here to adjust the roller relative to the collar bolt, it can be provided that the collar bolt has a plurality of axially adjacent circumferential grooves to which the securing element with the latching projections can be assigned, and that the roller is fixed to the securing element.<br>
Further advantageous configurations of the invention can be seen in the drawings, in which:<br>
fig. 1   shows the roller bolt in a three-dimensional illustration with a complete and a partially cut away roller,<br>
fig. 2   shows a section of the roller bolt according to fig. 1,<br>
fig. 3    shows the roller in an individual partial illustration,<br>
fig. 4 shows a further exemplary embodiment of    the invention with a roller provided with bores,<br>
fig. 5   shows a further exemplary embodiment of the roller bolt.<br><br><br>
In fig. 1, the roller bolt per se is referred to by 1 and the roller by 2. The roller 2 is fastened to the collar bolt 3 which has a fastening extension 4 with which the roller bolt 1 can be fastened, for example, to the driving rod of an espagnolette. The end 5 of the roller bolt 1 correspondingly projects freely outward, for example from a rebate surface. As becomes clear in conjunction with fig. 2, the fastening extension 4 is arranged eccentrically in relation to the cylindrical section 6. If the fastening extension 4 is pressed, for example, in a bore of a driving rod, an adjustment of the contact pressure can take place via this eccentric arrangement. Reference is made in this regard to AT 307 914, to the entire content of which reference is made with regard to the eccentric mounting of the roller bolt 1. In order to be able to undertake the adjustment, the roller bolt 1 is provided at its free end 5 with a tool engagement means 7.<br>
According to figs. 1 to 3, the roller 2 of the roller bolt 1 comprises a plastic casing 8 and a metal sleeve 9. The metal sleeve 9 has an outwardly pointing collar 10 which covers the end surface 11 of the plastic casing 8. Furthermore, at that end 12 of the roller 2 which points toward the fastening extension 4, the plastic casing 8 protrudes over the metal sleeve 9 and engages around an encircling projection 13 on the cylindrical section 6 of the collar bolt 3. At the same time, the roller 2 bears with the metal sleeve 9 against that edge of the projection 13 which faces the free end 5 such that said projection securely holds the roller 2 in the axial direction 14. The selected arrangement ensures that compressive forces possibly acting on the roller 2 can be absorbed by the metal sleeve 9 and can be transmitted via the projection 13. Compressive forces in the axial direction can be produced, for example, by the roller bolt 1 striking with the collar 10 against a projection, for example during closing of the casement or leaf or during a movement of the driving rod to which the roller bolt is assigned. In addition to a loading in the radial direction, the striking with an edge of the roller also causes a force component counter to the direction 14.<br><br><br>
The configuration of the roller 2 from the metal sleeve 9 over which the plastic casing 9 engages firstly affords the advantage of a stable configuration and secondly virtually avoids the interaction of metal surfaces. During a closing operation, the roller bolt 1 is placed by means of the roller 2 against the locking web (not illustrated here) without extensive rubbing of metal surfaces occurring. As a result, undesirable abrasion marks can be avoided on the locking web.<br>
The collar 10 prevents damage to the end surfaces 11 of the plastic casing 8. In this case, the collar 10 has the thickness of the plastic casing 8, but it may also 5 be provided that said plastic casing also protrudes over the collar 10 in order to avoid interaction of the collar 10 with the locking web. However, it has been shown in practice that the roller bolt 2 is slightly elastically deformed by the forces which occur when it strikes against the locking web, and therefore the collar 10 either stands back slightly or else, at least, the forces arising between the collar 10 and the lock web are low.<br>
In the individual partial illustration of the roller 2 according to fig. 3, it can also be seen that the plastic casing 9 is provided at the end 12 with an encircling latching lug 15 which, in the fitted state, engages behind the projection 13. The elastic properties of the plastic casing 9 therefore permit simple installation or, if appropriate, removal of the roller 2. it can also be gathered here that the metal sleeve 9 is provided with at least one radial constriction of the circumferential surface 15, which constriction arises, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated, by the metal sleeve 9 having a second, outward protruding collar 17 at its end 16. This results in an undercut, which is situated in the radial direction, on the collar 17, and therefore the plastic casing 8 and the metal sleeve 9 are also secured against each other in the axial direction.<br>
A configuration is particularly advantageous here, in which the plastic casing 8 is produced by encapsulating the metal sleeve 9 by injection molding. This results in a simple and cost-effective manner in a firm bond between, the metal sleeve 9 and the<br><br><br>
plastic casing 8, which bond can be secured in a simple manner as described above.<br>
To this end, it can also be provided as an alternative, according to fig. 4, or in conjunction with the exemplary embodiments according to figs 1 to 3, that the metal sleeve 9 is provided with bores 18 which are distributed over the circumferential surface 16 and in which the plastic casing 8 engages at least in some regions. This results in an interlocking connection which reinforces the connection of the plastic casing 8 and the metal sleeve 9. It can also be provided here that, in the region of the bores 18, the plastic casing 8 protrudes over the inside of the metal sleeve 9 in the direction of the collar bolt 3 such that the metal sleeve 9 and the collar bolt 3 remain slightly spaced apart from each other. Direct interaction of the metal surfaces is thereby avoided and tolerances which may be unavoidable during the manufacturing of the components can be compensated for by the elastic properties of the plastic casing 8.<br>
As an alternative and without special illustrations being necessary for this, the plastic casing 8 may be formed by a plastic sleeve which is fitted onto the metal sleeve 9 in a rotationally fixed manner. This can take place, for example, by the plastic sleeve being shrunk or adhesively bonded onto the metal sleeve 9.<br>
Furthermore, as an alternative to the configuration according to figs. 1 to 4, it can be provided that, at its free end 12, the plastic casing 8 engages by means of the constriction which protrudes inward over the inside diameter of the metal sleeve 9 and is in the   form of the latching lug 15 in a circumferential groove of the collar bolt<br>
3.<br>
Fig. 5 illustrates a further exemplary embodiment of a roller bolt 1. In this case, the roller bolt 3 is provided with an encircling groove 35 in which an expanding ring 36 sits. The inside of the metal sleeve 9 of the roller 2 has two grooves 37, 38 which are offset with respect to each other and serve for the engagement of the expanding ring<br><br><br>
36. The grooves 37, 38 are made in a section 39 which has a smaller inside diameter 40 than the remaining part of the metal sleeve 9. This results in a greater wall thickness in the metal sleeve 9 in the region of the grooves 37, 38, and therefore the mechanical stability of the metal sleeve 9 is maintained in spite of the grooves 37, 38. At its end 5, the collar bolt 3 has an encircling collar 41, the outside diameter of which is larger than the inside diameter 40, and therefore the collar 41 forms an end stop for the roller 2 in the direction 14.<br>
In contrast to the embodiments illustrated in figs. 1 to 3, the axial dimensioning of the metal sleeve 9 corresponds to the dimensioning of the roller 2, since the axial fixing of the roller 2 on the collar bolt 3 takes place via the expanding ring 36.<br>
In order to fix the plastic casing 8 to the metal sleeve 9, the metal sleeve 9 is provided at the end 42 with a conical widening 43 which increases the outside diameter such that that the plastic casing 8 is fixed between the collar 10 and the widening 43.<br>
The plastic casing 8 may likewise be produced here by encapsulation of the metal sleeve 9 by injection molding. However, it is also possible and advantageous to form the plastic casing 8 from a tubular section which is shrunk or adhesively bonded on the metal sleeve 9.<br>
Finally, it should also be pointed out that the plastic casings 8 of all of the exemplary embodiments mentioned comprise a plastic to which friction-reducing additives are added. The advantageous properties of the roller 2 can thereby be further improved.<br><br><br>
