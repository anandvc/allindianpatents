v In order to solve this problem, U.S.C. Patent No. 5,869,828 entitled<br>
lor and shape system for encoding and decoding d a0 as been<br>
proposed. USP 5,869,828 discloses a method and system for<br>
l o encodingldecoding character data using a color figure, in which a color<br>
figure having a simple structure is printed on the exterior surface of<br>
products to represent information on the products.<br>
Printers may have different printing characteristics, so that a color<br>
figure may be printed in different colors depending on the type of printers.<br>
1s That is, if an item of data is encoded into a color figure and the color figure<br>
is printed by printers provided by different companies, the shades of the<br>
printed color figures may vary depending on the characteristics of each of<br>
the printers. Accordingly, in USP 5,869,828, even when an identical color<br>
figure is printed, different color figures may be obtained due to differences<br>
m in the printing environment, so that it is likelihood that the original data<br>
encoded in a color figure may not be correctly decoded.<br>

Best mode for cawing out the Invention<br>
FIG. 1A shows an example of the structure of a code formed as an<br>
image so that target infonnation can be read by machines, according to the<br>
present invention. Referring to FIG. 1, this code includes at least a data<br>
to area having at least one cell. The code includes the data area 11 formed<br>
with at least one data cell which is encoded and expressed in different<br>
colors or shades depending on the content of information. Further, various<br>
shapes or patterns may be used for encoding information. Shapes of the<br>
cells may be are differently represented each other and patterns such as<br>
1s a line may be added within the cells.<br>
The code can further include a parity area 13, a reference area 15<br>
andlor a control area 17. The parity area 13 formed with parity cells for<br>
performing recognition error inspection with respect to the cells within the<br>
data area I I. The reference area 15 is formed with at least one reference<br>
a cell which provides a reference color or reference shade for judging the<br>
color or shade of me data cell formed in the data area 1 1. The control area<br>
17 is formed with at least one control cell which indicates a command or<br>
sewice capable of being provided using the information indicated in the<br>
data area 1 1. Hereinafter, one or more areas including the parity area, the<br>
25 reference area and the control area except the data area is referred to as<br>
"an auxiliary area" and a cell within the auxiliary area is referred to as "an<br>
auxiliary cell."<br>
Preferably, the code further includes a boundary area for defining<br>
the areas between the areas included in the code. Also, a boundary area<br>
30 can be further included between the cells included in each of the regions,<br>
in order to define cells. The boundary area can be made up of a line or cell<br>
having a specific color or pattern, and a boundary line or boundary area<br>
can be black or white. The areas can also be distinguished from each other<br>
by a certain range of a color or shade differently set for the cells of each of<br>
the data area, the parity area, the reference area and the control area, or<br>
by inserting an individual specific pattem into the cells of each of the areas.<br>
s Meanwhile, the boundary area may not be expressed in the code image for<br>
security of code information.<br>
The data area 11 is made up of at least one data cell in which a<br>
character or the like is encoded into an image. A data cell can be<br>
configured so as to represent information such as a single character, or a<br>
to set of data cells can be configured so as to represent one or more items of<br>
information. For example, a character A can be expressed as a single red<br>
cell or as two cells, for example, a red cell and a green cell.<br>
Target information contained in the data area 11 is made up of<br>
characters, numerals and symbols, and can be a variety of information such<br>
t5 as a name, an address, a telephone number, a facsimile number, the host<br>
address of a network, domain names and IP addresses used on the<br>
Internet, a URL, a protocol, or a document name, depending on the need<br>
of users.<br>
The parity area 13 is provided to be used upon decoding to<br>
20 determine whether colors or shades (and shape andfor pattem, if any)<br>
expressed in the cells are suitable for the content of target information.<br>
Parity data is obtained according to the code values corresponding to the<br>
colors or shades expressed in the data cells, and parity cells are formed by<br>
the colors or shades for the parity data. Various examples of the location<br>
25 of parity cells within a code image are shown in FIGS. 3A through 3F.<br>
The reference area 15 is used to set a reference color (or a<br>
reference shade, if necessary, a reference shape or a reference pattern) for<br>
recognizing the colors (or shades, shape or pattern) expressed in the cells<br>
in the data area 11 and/or the control area 17. The colors of the cells<br>
30 expressed in each of the areas are based on at least one model of a red<br>
blue green (RGB) color model, a hue saturation value (HSV) color model<br>
and the like. Also, when a code is formed in a black and white shade (gray<br>
scale), the inforrnation of each cell can be accurately ascertained on the<br>
basis of black andlor white expressed in the reference area 15.<br>
A color can be printed differently depending on the type of printer or<br>
the material used in the printing paper, and the same color can be<br>
s recognized somewhat differently depending on the characteristics of a<br>
scanner or camera. In consideration with this fact, the reference cells in the<br>
reference area 15 provide a standard for determining a color expressed on<br>
the data area. That is, even when a color is differently printed due to the<br>
difference in characteristics between output devices, or when a color is<br>
10 differently recognized due to the difference in characteristics between input<br>
devices such as a scanner, the color of each of the cells in the data area<br>
11 can be accurately recognized since the color difference between the<br>
reference area 15 and the data area 11 is f~ed. Therefore, the color of<br>
each of the cells can be obtained by the comparison with the reference<br>
1s color of the reference area 15 on the basis of the RGB model or HSV<br>
model, so that the information of a data cell can be accurately recognized<br>
even if an image input device or an image output device is changed. When<br>
a code image is input by a camera, shapes or patterns in the code image<br>
may be,distorted or tilted. Shapes or patterns expressed in the code image<br>
m may be correctly discerned based on the reference shape or reference<br>
pattern provided in the reference area.<br>
Users can receive various services depending on the type of<br>
application field using the target inforrnation of the data area 11. For<br>
example, if an lntemet home page address (that is, a URL) is expressed as<br>
25 a code image on a business card, a program can be provided so that a<br>
code image is decoded by a computer, and then a web browser of the<br>
computer or a server computer connected to the computer is executed to<br>
allow users to be connected to the home page. Also, if an Internet E-mail<br>
address is expressed as a code image on a business card, the code image<br>
30 is decoded by a computer, and then the mailing software of the computer<br>
is executed, to provide an environment where a mail can be sent to the Email<br>
address. In an another example, when the code image is input to a<br>
portable terminal such as a mobile phone, a phone call is made to a<br>
telephone number corresponding to the code image or a service for<br>
geographic information may be provided. Here, this automatic service<br>
fundion can be automatically executed by a separate program or by a<br>
5 decoding program depending on the type of target information. Also, a<br>
code image includes the control area 17 on which this command word is<br>
expressed as an image, so that the automatic service function can be<br>
executed by a decoding program using control information decoded by the<br>
control area 17.<br>
10 The control area 17 can include a command or metadata for<br>
controlling the target information of the data area. For example, the<br>
information expressed on the control area 17 can indude various metadata<br>
such as the sequence of decoding of the cells formed in the data area 1 1,<br>
the location of the reference cells of the reference area 15 that is a<br>
is standard of judgement of the colors of the data cells formed on the data<br>
area 11, the location or properties of the parity area 13, and the like.<br>
. Fig 1 B to I€are examples of expressing a data area and an<br>
auxiliary area in a code image. Here, the auxiliary area which is represent<br>
by hatched areas may include at least one area selected among a parity<br>
m area, a reference area and a control area.<br>
FIG. 2A shows an example of expressing data of two bits using four<br>
colors. If each cell can have one among four colors. 2-bit data can be<br>
expressed using one color cell. Hence, if 4 consecutive cells are defined<br>
to express one character, , that is, 256 characters, can be expressed. If<br>
25 a cell may expressed by one of four types of shapes, for example, a small<br>
rectangular, a large rectangular, a small circle and a large circle, while one<br>
color is used, data of two bits can be encoded. In this case, information of<br>
256 (8 bits) kinds can be expressed in a code image when a cell may be<br>
filled by one of four colors. FIG. 2B shows an example of a code<br>
XI conversion table where various characters (alphabet or special characters),<br>
numerals or figures are converted into color images. Here, one character<br>
is mapped to two color cells.<br>
In an encoding method using the code conversion table of FIG. 2B,<br>
various characters or the like are converted into code values, and then<br>
code images are produced in colors respectively allocated to the code<br>
values. In FIG. 2B, a code image is produced using 8 colors, and two<br>
5 consecutive cells are used to express one character or numeral. Code<br>
values "000" to "1 11" are allocated to 8 colors, respectively, and each<br>
character is encoded in two colors. For example, a number "3" is allocated<br>
as a code value "000 01 1 ", and encoded in a color (black) allocated to the<br>
code value "000" and a color (cyan) allocated to the code value "01 I", so<br>
lo that the number"3" is expressed using two consecutive cells of black and<br>
cyan. Various characters or numerals included in the target information are<br>
converted into code values according to the code conversion table shown<br>
in FIG. 28, and then colors corresponding to the code values can be<br>
expressed in a rectangular matrix, that is, a combination of rectangular<br>
15 cells.<br>
FIG. 2C shows an example of a code image produced using a<br>
grayscale code, according to the present invention. In the present<br>
invention, a character or numeral can be color-encoded and colordecoded<br>
using a color printer and a scanner. In FIG. 2C, a code image can be<br>
20 produced using a grayscale code, that is, shades ranging from black to<br>
white, depending on the purposes and circumstances of users.<br>
A grayscale code forms a code according to the brightness of white<br>
from black instead of a mixture ratio of red, green and blue. Thus, the<br>
reference area is formed of at least one reference shade among black,<br>
2s white and gray, and the cells formed in the data area have code values<br>
obtained due to the gray difference between their shades (or colors) and<br>
the reference shade of the reference area. If there is no reference area, a<br>
shade of each cell in the code image is detected, cells (cell group) having<br>
similar shades each otherwithin a predetermined criterion are grouped, and<br>
30 then the same code value is-assigned to the cells included in the same<br>
group. Next, using a parity area it is determined whether there is a<br>
decoding error. If an error, shades of the cells may be recalculated or<br>
criteria for forming cell groups are reestablished, and then it is determined<br>
whether an error is still happened. This gray code image can usually be<br>
applied to black printing media such as newspaper.<br>
FIGS. 2D and 2E show an example of a pattern that can be<br>
5 expressed in each of the cells of a code image. As can be seen from FIGS.<br>
2D and 2E, a method of adding a pattem to a color cell using a vector line<br>
in addition to color can be adopted to convert information into a code<br>
image. FIG. 2D shows an example of 4direction vector lines and 8-<br>
direction vector lines that can be expressed in a cell. If Uirection vector<br>
10 lines are used, patterns of four bits, that is, 16 different patterns, can be<br>
added to the color of each cell, as shown in FIG. 2E. Accordingly, when<br>
one character is expressed for one cell, and 8 colors, that is, colors of 3<br>
bits, are used, each cell can be expressed in 128 characters (characters of<br>
7 bits). Also, a cell can be divided in horizontal, vertical and diagonal<br>
15 directions, and the divided cell pieces can be expressed in different colors<br>
or shades.<br>
. In a code image according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention, a data area and/or an auxiliary area may be expressed by<br>
shapes andlor patterns as well as colors or shades. Also, a data area<br>
20 and/or an auxiliary area may be expressed by at least one of colors,<br>
shades, shapes or patterns, or a combination thereof. For example,<br>
information may be expressed by various shapes or patterns in a data area<br>
and/or an auxiliary area while using only one color.<br>
FIGS 1 ?A though 11 H show various examples of representing a<br>
2s code image according the present invention. A cell may be variously<br>
expressed by one shape of a rectangular, a circle, an ellipse, a cross or<br>
web andlor a combination thereof.<br>
Size or shape of a code image or a cell included therein may be aptly<br>
selected according to contents or amounts of information to be expressed<br>
30 in the code image. FIG 11 H shows that a shape similar to a bar code also<br>
may be used in an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
FIGS. 3A through 3F show various examples of the location of the<br>
&amp;- parity area 13 of FIG. 1 within a rectangular matrix-type code image. Also,<br>
the configuration of these examples can be modified and applied to a code<br>
image having a circular shape or another shape. Area (Dn) except for the<br>
parity area (Pn) is a data area, a reference area or a control area.<br>
5 In FIG. 3A, parity cells each having parity information on the cells in<br>
the same row are located at the rightmost column. For example, the parity<br>
cell for cells Dl 1, 012. Dl3 and Dl4 is PI. In FIG. 38, parity cells each<br>
having parity information on the cells on the same row are aligned in a<br>
diagonal direction. In FIG. 3C, parity cells each having parity information<br>
lo on the cells on the same column are located at the lowermost row. In FIG.<br>
30, parity cells each having parity information on the cells on the same<br>
column are aligned in a diagonal direction.<br>
In FIG. 3E, parity cells Plr through P4r each having parity<br>
information on the cells in the same row are located at the rightmost<br>
1s column, and simultaneously, parity cells Plc through P4c each having<br>
parity information on the cells in the same column are aligned at the<br>
lowermost row. A parity cell Prc having parity information on the row parity<br>
cells and the column parity cells is further included. In FIG. 3F, a code<br>
includes the row parity cells Plr through P4r and the column parity cells<br>
20 PIC through P4c, as in FIG. 3E. Here, the row parity cells PI r through P4r<br>
are aligned in a diagonal direction. Conversely, the column parity cells PI c<br>
through P4c can be aligned diagonally.<br>
An example of a method of selecting a color for a parity cell will now<br>
be described. A parity cell has a code value obtained by performing a XOR<br>
2s operation with respect to the code values of the data cells (undoubtedly,<br>
reference cells and/or control cells can be included) on the same row or<br>
column. Various methods for generating parity data may be applied for<br>
encoding a code image according to the number of colors or shades to be<br>
expressed in the code image. For example, when two kinds of colors or<br>
30 shades are used, two parity methods, that is, an even parity method and an<br>
odd parity method may be available. When an even parity method is used,<br>
the result value of the XOR operation is directly the code value of a parity<br>
cell, so that the parity cell is expressed in a color for the obtained code<br>
value. When an odd parity method is used, the complement value (-) of<br>
each bit of the resultant value of the XOR operation is obtained, and the<br>
parity cell is formed in a color corresponding to the obtained complement<br>
5 value.<br>
A method of obtaining a color to be expressed in a parity cell using<br>
the code conversion table shown in FIG. 2A will now be described. If the<br>
colors of the data cells Dl 1, 012, Dl 3 and Dl4 are black, red, green and<br>
green, respectively, the code values of the data cells are 11,10,01 and 01,<br>
10 respectively. Here, 'XOR denotes an exclusive OR operation.<br><br>
11 XOR 10 XOR 01 XOR 01 = 01 (green)<br><br>
I IXOR 10 XOR 01 XOR 01 = 01 -&gt; -01 = 10 (red)<br>
1s As the number of colors or shades used in a code image is<br>
increased, it is more flexible to select one among various parity methods.<br>
When four types of colors or shades are used, four parity methods<br>
comprising modular parity methods as well as an even and odd parity<br>
method are available. The modular parity methods includes an even<br>
M modular parity method in which an even parity value obtained by the even<br>
parity method is added by two, the resultant value is divided by four and<br>
then the resultant value is set to a parity value and an odd modular parity<br>
method in which an odd parity value obtained by the odd parity method is<br>
added by two, the resultant value is divided by four and then the resultant<br>
a value is set to a parity value. In case of eight colors or shades, eight types<br>
of parity methods are available. In general, if the number of colors or<br>
shades used in a code image is assumed to N, the number of parity<br>
methods may be determined as follows:<br>
(an even parity value + 2 * i) % N, or<br>
30 (an odd parity value + 2 * i) % N<br>
where, i=0,1,2, . . . , log,N-I , N=2,4,8, . . . , and %: rnoddar.<br>
A plurality of parity methods may be simultaneously applied to one<br>
&amp;<br>
code image and thus type of code, type of decoding or direction for reading<br>
cells may be determined according to types of parity methods or locations<br>
expressed in the code image. Referring to FIG. 3E, an even parity method<br>
is applied to each row and column, but an odd parity method may applied<br>
s to a cell Prc. Referring to FIGS. 3A to 3C1 an even parity method is applied<br>
to the first column, but an odd parity method may applied to the remaining<br>
columns. Meanwhile, a shape or a pattern may also be used to express a<br>
parity value instead of colors or shades. Further, a combination of colors,<br>
shades, shapes andlor pattern is also available. For example, when a<br>
10 parity value is zero, a while rectangular All may be used or a black circle<br>
cell. A code image may further comprises a cell or an area in which<br>
inforrnation relating to a parity method applied to the code image is<br>
expressed.<br>
FIG. 6 is a flowchart illustrating a method of encoding information<br>
15 such as characters into a code image, according to an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A method of converting inforrnation into a code image<br>
using encoding software will now be described. At least one character or<br>
numeral included in target information is converted into a code image<br>
formed of a predetermined shape, color or pattem or a combination of the<br>
m abovedescribed features using a predetermined code conversion table as<br>
shown in FIG. 2B.<br>
An encoding method may be a direct encoding method, an indirect<br>
(or index) encoding method or a mixed encoding method depending on the<br>
type of information encoded into a code image. In a direct encoding<br>
2s method, target information itself is directly encoded using a code<br>
conversion table, thereby producing a code image. In an indirect encoding<br>
method, index information (for example, the address of a database or a<br>
record number) for reference of target information is encoded into an image<br>
using a code conversion table. The mixed encoding method is a mixture of<br>
30 the two above-described methods.<br>
In the direct encoding method of encoding target information itself<br>
into a code image, a separate system or storage is not required. However,<br>
). when the amount of data of target information increases, the physical size<br>
of the code image increases.<br>
In the indirect encoding method, target information itself is not<br>
encoded, but information on the position of a storage medium is encoded.<br>
s This position information can be he pointer or memory address of a storage<br>
medium in which target information is stored, or the URL or IP address<br>
representing the position of target information. Thus, the indirect encoding<br>
method requires a separate system or a storage medium in which target<br>
inforrnation exists.<br>
10 In the mixed encoding method, some indispensable data among the<br>
entire target information is directly encoded, and the other data is indirectly<br>
encoded. For example, names and telephone numbers are encoded<br>
character by character, large data such as mail addresses or E-mail<br>
addresses is stored in a server, and the memory address of the data stored<br>
1s in the server is encoded to produce a code image. Also, it is preferable that<br>
fixed data such as names adopt the direct encoding method, and variable<br>
information capable of being changed at any time, such as, home page<br>
addresses, telephone numbers or E-mail addresses, is indirectly encoded.<br>
Even when the personal items of a user are changed, a person who has<br>
XI received a business card on which a code image of the user is expressed<br>
can always access the latest inforrnation even with the old business card<br>
if the user registers the changed items in the database of a server.<br>
FIG. 4 shows the structure of a database which stores index<br>
information required when an indirect encoding method is applied to an<br>
a encoding method according to the present invention. FIG. 5 illustrates a<br>
process for acquiring target inforrnation using index information read from<br>
a code image. In FIG. 5, a service pointer database 52 that stores pointer<br>
information capable of accessing real target information depending on<br>
index inforrnation is included together with an index database 51 as shown<br>
30 in FIG. 4. The pointer information indicates the position at which real target<br>
information 53 such as messages, images or moving pictures is stored.<br>
A unique index is allocated to each real target information (content),<br>
++ and the service code and the offset, which correspond to target information,<br>
are set and stored together. Here, the target information, which is the final<br>
inforrnation capable of being eventually used by users, includes various<br>
types of inforrnation such as web site addresses, E-mail addresses,<br>
s messages, images, moving pictures and music. A service code is<br>
designated depending on the type of service. For example, a web<br>
connection service and a telephone call service can be encoded into 0 "<br>
and Cl ", respectively. The offset relates to information on a position at<br>
which the service pointer database 52 can be accessed. For example, if<br>
l o index information is read from a code image, the index database 51 is<br>
searched to extract the service code, offset and target information for the<br>
index information. Pointer information stored in the service pointer<br>
database 52 is searched for depending on the offset. The positions of<br>
preset messages or image files are found depending on the pointer<br>
is inforrnation and the message or image is provided to users. For example,<br>
using a target data obtained by decoding a code image, a service type code<br>
is obtained from a first database and location information is obtained from<br>
a second database. Target information is obtained according to the<br>
location information, and then a service such as a message service, a<br>
20 moving image service, a web page access service, a telephone call service<br>
or an E-mail service which is determined by the service type code may be<br>
provided depending on the target inforrnation.<br>
An encoding process will now be described referring to FIG. 6. A<br>
code conversion table on which colors or shades (or gray levels) are<br>
2s mapped corresponding to recognizable characters including numerals and<br>
symbols, is established, in step 61. An example of the code conversion<br>
table is shown in FIG. 28, and a pattern (see FIG 2E) using a vector line<br>
can be used in the code conversion table.<br>
A user inputs target information to be converted into a code image,<br>
30 in step 62. Here, the user inputs his or her name, position, telephone<br>
number and facsimile number in order to encode, for example, personal<br>
items to be expressed on a business card, into a code image. It is common<br>
that a server stores information input by users in a database or file.<br>
Next, it is determined whether to apply the direct encoding method<br>
of directly encoding target information or the indirect encoding method of<br>
indirectly encoding information on the position at which target information<br>
s is stored in a data base, in step 63. If the direct encoding method is<br>
applied, the target inforrnation itself is set to be target data to be encoded,<br>
in step 64b. If the indirect encoding method is applied, the information on<br>
the position of the target information is set to be target data to be encoded,<br>
in step Ma. For example, if personal items (target inforrnation) themselves<br>
ro input by users are encoded, this corresponds to the direct encoding<br>
method. If database addresses at which the personal items are stored in<br>
a server, or indices associated with the addresses are encoded, this<br>
corresponds to the indirect encoding method. Also, a mixed encoding<br>
method, in which names are encoded by the direct encoding method and<br>
is the other personal items are encoded by the indirect encoding method, can<br>
be applied.<br>
The target data is encoded using a code conversion table, in step<br>
65. Then, a code value for each of the characters or numerals included in<br>
the target data is obtained, a color or shade for each data cell is determined<br>
20 by the code value to form an image of each data cell, and imaged data cells<br>
are aligned in the order (or in a determined way) of alignment of characters<br>
or the like of target data, thereby completing a data area.<br>
After the target data is encoded, at least one of parity inforrnation,<br>
reference information and control inforrnation may be selected as an<br>
2s auxiliary information to be expressed in a code image in step 66. .Further,<br>
a method of expressing the auxiliary inforrnation in the code image, for<br>
example, type of parity method, may be determined.<br>
If reference inforrnation is expressed in an auxiliary area of a code<br>
image, a reference area can be further set up by determining the shape,<br>
30 position or arrangement of reference cells in which a reference color or<br>
reference shade (and reference shape or reference pattern, if necessary)<br>
is to be expressed for providing a standard of interpretation of colors or<br>
shades expressed in the data cells of the data area. Also, a control area,<br>
in which control inforrnation where items associated with commands or<br>
services capable of being used using the target information included in the<br>
data area are set, can be further established.<br>
s Then, if parity information is expressed in an auxiliary area of a code<br>
image, a parity value is obtained from the code values of colors or shades<br>
(and shapes or patterns, if necessary) expressed in the data area or the<br>
like, and a color or shade for the parity value is set to be parity data, in step<br>
66. At this time, an area in which the parity cell is to be located is<br>
10 determined (see FIG. 1 and FIGS. 3A through 3F).<br>
When a data area and an auxiliary area are set up, the layout of a<br>
code image including the shape of the code image, the relative position and<br>
size of each of the areas, and the size of a cell unit is set. A code image<br>
made up of a data area and an auxiliary area is produced acmrding to the<br>
1s set layout, in step 67. The code image can be automatically output by the<br>
algorithm of a program, or manufactured by a graphic editor or by a manual<br>
operation according to a code conversion scheme. The code image formed<br>
in this way is expressed on a predetermined medium or stored in an image<br>
file.<br>
20 FIG. 7 shows an encoding system according to the present<br>
invention. In FIG. 7, a computer 77 receives target inforrnation, produces<br>
a code image through the above-described encoding process and prints the<br>
code image using a printer 78, so that the code image can be physically<br>
expressed on a medium 79a such as a business card or electronically<br>
25 provided in the form of a code image file 79b. Here, a medium on which a<br>
code image is expressed can be all media capable of expressing<br>
predetermined information, such as a business card, the exterior of<br>
products, the advertisement page of magazines and the like. Also, a code<br>
image can be output through a display device such as a monitor, stored in<br>
30 a computer file, or transmitted as an electrical signal to a communication<br>
line.<br>
FIG. 8A is a flowchart illustrating a decoding method to extract the<br>
original target information made up of characters or the like from a code<br>
image, according to an embodiment of the present invention. In order to<br>
decode a code image of the present invention, an image input device 92 for<br>
reading a code image 91a, such as a scanner, a digital camera, a CCD<br>
s camera, a sensor, a facsimile or the like, must be provided, or a code image<br>
must be provided in the form of a code image file 91 b so as to be directly<br>
used by a computer 93, as shown in FIG. 9. Also, the computer 93 (a<br>
personal computer or a server computer connected to personal computers)<br>
must be able to execute a program for decoding code images.<br>
10 - Refening back to FIG. 8A, a code image made up of a data area and<br>
: a parity area (including a reference area and a control area if they exist) is<br>
input to a user computer, in step 80. The user computer can directly<br>
receive the code image 91a expressed on a medium using an image input<br>
device, or can load the image file 91 b, which has already been made, into<br>
1s its memory using a storage device such as a disc or buffer. In the case of<br>
a code image formed by an indirect encoding method, the user computer<br>
must be connected to a server having a storage device in which index<br>
information is stored, or must include such a storage device.<br>
An image input by an image input device is processed by an edge<br>
m detection method or a noise image rejection method using predetermined<br>
parameters, thereby eliminating a background image and thus obtaining a<br>
code image. Sometimes, a code image may be read crookedly or aslant<br>
depending on the operating state of a scanner or the position on a medium<br>
at which the code image is printed. In this case, the code image may be<br>
25 decoded wrongly, Accordingly, the position or direction of the code image<br>
is corrected, in step 87. Even when the correction step is not performed,<br>
locations and inforrnation of each cell may be detected concerning the state<br>
of an input image.<br>
A data area and an auxiliary area (a parity area, a reference area<br>
30 and/or a control area) in the code image are discerned from each other<br>
using the information in a boundary area set between areas or using<br>
particular inforrnation in a cell, in step 82. If the auxiliary area includes at<br>
b- least two sub areas, these sub areas are discerned from each other. If<br>
there is the reference area in the code image, colors, shades, shapes<br>
and/or patterns are discriminated depending on information of the reference<br>
area. If there is the parity area in the code image, it is performed to detect<br>
s a decoding error.<br>
When a code image is recognized by a computer, a decoding<br>
process for extracting the original information from the code image is<br>
performed. Decoding denotes extraction of the original information from a<br>
code image according to what is defined in a code conversion table. Types<br>
lo of decoding methods include a direct decoding method and an indirect<br>
decoding method. In a direct decoding method, when a code image is<br>
decoded, actual target information such as names or addresses is directly<br>
extracted. In an indirect decoding method, a decoded result has index<br>
information, wtlich is a key value for accessing a database in which actual<br>
15 target information such as names or addresses is stored.<br>
Upon decoding, a process for finding shapes, colors, patterns and<br>
characters included in a code image is required, and a process for<br>
correcting distorted images is also required. Here, the colors can be<br>
discerned by at least one of an RGB (red, green, blue) model, an HSV (hue<br>
20 angle, saturation, value) model, a CMY (cyan, magenta, yellow) model and<br>
an HLS (hue angle, lightness, saturation) model.<br>
In order to achieve decoding, the code values of the cells within a<br>
data area and an auxiliary area are extracted, in step 83. if a reference<br>
area exists, a color (or shade, etc) is detected from a reference cell, and<br>
2s serves as a reference color (or reference shade) for interpreting the<br>
information in the data area or other areas. Colors are detected from the<br>
cells included in the data area, the parity area or the control area, and the<br>
color differences of the detected colors from the reference color are<br>
obtained and converted into the code values for the cells. If there is no<br>
30 reference area, the code values for the cells can be obtained depending on<br>
colors or shades interpreted by an image input device.<br>
If the parity area exists in a code image, the parity of each row or<br>
N column of the code image is checked as to whether it has errors, using the<br>
code values obtained from the parity area, that is, parity data, in step 84.<br>
This step will be described later in greater detail referring to FIG. 88. If<br>
necessary, direction or location of the code image may be also detected<br>
s depending on the parity data.<br>
The code value of each cell obtained through the abovedescribed<br>
process is converted into target data made up of recognizable characters<br>
including numerals and symbols according to a code conversion table (see<br>
FIG. 28). in step 85. The content of the target data obtained in step 85 is<br>
10 determined depending on the type of encoding method, in step 86. In step<br>
87a, if a code image is encoded by the indirect encoding method, that is,<br>
if target data obtained by decoding is index data, target information stored<br>
at a position on a storage device (database) determined by the target data<br>
is extracted, since the target data corresponds to the address or pointer of<br>
1s a storage device in which target information is stored. If the target data is<br>
not index data, the target data serves as desired target infomation, in step<br>
87b.<br>
It is determined whether a code image includes a control area in<br>
which items associated with commands or setvices capable of being<br>
x, executed using target information are set forth, in step 88. If a code image<br>
includes the control area, commands or sewices are provided depending<br>
on information set forth in the control area, in step 89a. Otherwise, a basic<br>
service designated in a program is provided, in step 89b.<br>
FIG. 88 is a flowchart illustrating the step 80 of FIG. 8A in greater<br>
2s detail. In FIG. 8B, parity is inspected on the basis of the code values<br>
extracted in step 84, and colors are corrected according to the result of the<br>
parity inspection.<br>
First, parameters for color interpretation are set in step 841. The<br>
parameters can be R, G and B in the RGB model, H, S and V in the HSV<br>
30 model, or a combination of the aforementioned features, and are set to<br>
normalize the code values of colors or shades recognized from a code<br>
image in consideration of the environment from which the code image has<br>
&amp; been read. Here, the parameters can be R, V and S values, that is, the R<br>
value obtained by the RGB model and the V and S values obtained by the<br>
HSV model. Generally, initial environmental parameters are set so as to-be<br>
suitable for the most-widely used illumination environment, such as,<br>
s fluorescent lamps or 3-wavelength lamps. Preferably, the parameters are<br>
set depending on the illumination environment when a white backgmund is<br>
photographed using an image input device, before a code image is input.<br>
For example, since red light is relatively strong under the illumination of a<br>
halogen lamp, parameters are set so as to remove an influence of red light<br>
l o from a halogen lamp. Then, an actually-read color is normalized by the<br>
parameters, thereby reducing the effect of illumination and obtaining a color<br>
which is close to the original color.<br>
Next, the R, G and B values of a color read from a code image are<br>
nmlized on the basis of the parameters R, V and S, in step 842. A code<br>
1s value for a color depending on the normalized R, G and B values is<br>
obtained using a code conversion table, in step 843. A parity value is<br>
calculated using the code value of the cells on each column and/or row<br>
expressed in a data area (including a reference area and a control area if<br>
they exist), in step 844. In step 845, the calculated parity value is<br>
compared with the parity data of a parity cell set in units of columns and<br>
rows of the data area, to determine whether there are parity errors. If a<br>
plurality of parity methods are applied to the code image, order of decoding<br>
cells included in the code image may be also easily detected besides a<br>
parity check described in the above.<br>
If a parity error is generated on a column or row, parameters for a<br>
new environment are set in step 846, and then the step returns to the color<br>
normalizing step 802. Parameters optimized to an illumination environment<br>
of high frequency, and their weighted values, are pre-set and stored in a<br>
3 decoding program or a database, so that users can select an environment<br>
parameter which is the most suitable for their environments. Generation of<br>
parity errors can be considered as generation of errors in color<br>
interpretation using the currently-set parameters. Accordingly, in this case,<br>
colors are again read using other parameters.<br>
The parameters are experimentally set in a parameter database so<br>
that a code image is distinguished from a background in an input image and<br>
5 a color read by an input optical device is corrected to the original color by<br>
analyzing the optical characteristics of the input optical device and its<br>
peripheral illumination circumstances. Thus, the effects of devices or an<br>
environment are excluded, so that colors can be recognized without errors.<br>
Two or more parameter groups each having other objective may be<br>
10 established. One may be a parameter gmup for distinguishing a code<br>
image from a background image and the other may be a parameter group<br>
for discerning colors or shades of the code image. For example, when<br>
colors are discerned on the basis of the RGB model under a red<br>
illumination environment, an R value is relatively high. Thus, the effects of<br>
1s environments can be excluded by reducing the R value read by an optical<br>
device depending on a predetermined weighted value. In a case of a code<br>
image received under a bright illumination environment, black and white are<br>
discerned from each other on the basis of the HSV model by increasing the<br>
weighted value of a V value. In a case of a code image received under a<br>
m dark illumination environment, colors are determined on the basis of the<br>
HSV model by increasing the weighted value of the V value which is used<br>
for discerning black and white from other colors and by increasing the<br>
weighted value of the S value.<br>
Upon re-setting parameters, the distribution of R, G, 6, H, S andtor<br>
25 V values obtained with respect to each of the cells of a code image by an<br>
optical device is ascertained, and parameters and their weighted values<br>
can be re-set with reference to the distribution.<br>
Meanwhile, when errors of reading data from a code image during<br>
decoding process continuously occur, a user may directly enter target data<br>
30 according to colors and so on expressed in the code image referring to a<br>
code conversion table and then a predetermined service may be provided<br>
to the user.<br>
FIG. 10 shows an example of an advertisement paper on which a<br>
code image is printed according to the present invention. Users who see<br>
the advertisement paper of FIG. 10 can obtain information on a code image<br>
by scanning (or photographing) the code image (a rectangular matrix-type<br>
s image displayed on the lower portion at the left and right sides of the<br>
advertisement paper) using an optical device such as a PC camera or a<br>
scanner.<br>
In the present invention, a computer-readable code image can be<br>
stored in recording media that can be read by a computer. The computerlo<br>
readable recording media may be any type of recording device that can be<br>
read by a computer system, such as, ROM, RAM, CD-ROM, magnetic<br>
tapes, floppy discs, optical data storage devices, and carrier waves (e.g.,<br>
transmissions over the Internet). Also, the computer readable recording<br>
media can be distributed on computer systems connected through a<br>
15 network and can store and execute a computer readable code in a<br>
distributed mode.<br>
As described above, various types of information can be expressed<br>
in a code image using colors, shades, shapes and/or pattens according to<br>
the present invention. The code system according to the present invention<br>
20 enables to encode more diversified and voluminous information compared<br>
to the other codes of the prior arts. Further, when a code image according<br>
to the present invention may include a parity area for parity inspection, malrecognition<br>
of colors due to the difference between input devices such as<br>
cameras or between the environments such as illumination conditions, can<br>
25 be easily detected and corrected. Thus, a more efficient decoding method<br>
and apparatus can be achieved using a code image according to the<br>
present invention.<br>
Industrial A~plicability<br>
30 According to an embodiment of the present invention, parity<br>
information together with target information is encoded into a code image<br>
according to a code conversion table, parity inspection is performed when<br>
the encoded code image is decoded, and environmental parameters are<br>
appropriately applied upon generation of parity errors, so that colors can<br>
be accurately recognized. In particular, even in an environment having<br>
normal brightness under a general fluorescent lamp, in a relatively dark or<br>
s bright environment, and in an environment where red light is strong such<br>
as an environment under a halogen lamp, information on a code can be<br>
accurately recognized. Also, when the code may include a reference area,<br>
the code reduces mis-recognition due to differences among operational<br>
conditions or machine models of output apparatuses or input apparatuses.<br><br><br><br><br>
