				<td>The present invention relates to a diagnostic device for the early detection of HIV p24<br>
antigen, HIV-1 antibodies and HIV -2 antibodies in human serum or plasma.<br>
More specifically, the subject invention relates to a process for making a test on a Comb<br>
format based on Enzyme Immuno Assay principle and an analyzing device for the<br>
detection of HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies and HIV p24 antigen in human serum or<br>
plasma,<br>
It is an Enzyme Immuno Assay (EIA) for the detection of HIV1 antibodies, HIV2<br>
antibodies and p24 antigen in human serum or plasma. The respective p24 antibody and<br>
the HIV1 and HIV 2 antigens are applied on the plastic polystyrene material in the form<br>
of a dots.<br>
It is an assay leading to the differential detection of antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 and<br>
p24 antigen in human serum or plasma.<br>
Back ground<br>
The Human Immunodeficiency Virus is responsible agent for the Acquired<br>
Immunodeficiency Syndrome in humans. HIV causes AIDS by attacking the immune<br>
system's CD4 cells. When the immune system loses too many CD cells, we are less able<br>
to fight off infection and can develop serious infection.<br>
AIDS is usually associated with two distinct type of HIV: HIV 1 and HIV-2. The first<br>
confirmed case of AIDS was identified in 1983 and by 1984 the etiological agent, the<br>
HTV, subsequently named HIV -1 was isolated.<br>
2<br><br>
HIV -2 viruses was first isolated from the AIDS patients in West Africa in 1986 and<br>
subsequently detected as an infectious agent for the first time in the US the following<br>
year.<br>
These two viruses belong to the retrovirus group and are slow viruses. The structure,<br>
gene organization and serological behavior of HIV -1 and HIV-2 and their complete<br>
nucleotide sequence have been determined. This knowledge has laid foundation for the<br>
development of a new assay leading to differential detection of antibodies and antigens in<br>
human serum or plasma.<br>
EIA ( Enzyme Immuno Assay) continues to be the screening test for HIV infection with<br>
high sensitivity and specificity. The standard of practice for screening blood in blood<br>
banks for HIV is EIA. EIA methods are highly accurate, and suitable for high volume<br>
testing.<br>
Prior Art<br>
US Patent No: 20060286036 teaches a method for identifying an agent that inhibits HIV<br>
infection comprising assaying a biological activity of an isopeptidase . The anti-HIV<br>
agents are identified by screening test compounds for ability to modulate a biological<br>
activity of isopeptidase T (IsoT), e.g., its isopeptidase activity or its binding to another<br>
molecule such as viral protein R (Vpr). Such IsoT modulators can be further examined<br>
for their activity in inhibiting an activity indicative of HIV infection or HIV replication.<br>
These novel anti-HIV agents are useful in the prevention or treatment of HIV infection<br>
and      conditions      associated      with      or      caused      by      HIV      infection.<br>
US Patent No: 6870045 describe the compositions and methods for synthesizing and<br>
detecting HIV-2 specific amplicons. Particularly described are oligoneucleotides that are<br>
useful as hybridization probe, and amplication primers that facilitate detection of very<br>
low levels of HIV-2 nucleic acids.<br>
US Patent No: 5641624 provide a method for determining the amount of HIV-1 p24<br>
antigen or anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody present in a suitable bodily fluid sample from an<br>
HIV-1-infected subject. This invention also provides a kit for determining the amount of<br>
HIV-1 p24 antigen or anti-HIV-1 p24 antibody present in an HIV-1-infected subject.<br>
3<br><br>
US Patent No: 6593079 concerns a process for diagnosis of an HIV infection by means<br>
of an immunoassay using the specific detection of the p24 antigen of HIV 1, HIVl-SubO<br>
and/or the p26 antigen of HIV2, at least one antibody against the env region of HIV1,<br>
HIVl-Sub0 and/or of HIV2 and at least one antibody against the pol and/or gag region of<br>
HIV1, HIVl-SubO and/or HIV2, reagent kits and test strips suitable for diagnostic<br>
procedure as well as monoclonal antibodies against p24 and their use.<br>
Description<br>
HIV test devices are available in the known art for the detection of HIV antibodies in<br>
human beings associated with such devices. But no HIV Enzyme Immuno Assay Comb<br>
test device is available in the market with the facility for the simultaneous detection of<br>
the HIV 1 antibodies, HIV 2 antibodies and HIV p24 antigen in human beings.<br>
No Enzyme Immuno Assay Comb test device with four dots is available in the market. In<br>
this, specific antigens are coated on the comb for the detection of the HIV-1 and HIV-2<br>
antibodies and specific monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies are coated on the comb for<br>
the detection of the p24 antigen. p24 antigen detection dot is included in the comb for the<br>
early and simultaneous detection of the p24 antigen.<br>
It is a rapid, visual EIA test for the qualitative and differential detection of antibodies to<br>
HIV -1 and HIV-2 and p24 antigen in human serum or plasma.<br>
Another object of the present invention is that this is the EIA Comb test device wherein<br>
an in built control dot for the testing of the workability of the device is included so that<br>
the workability can be tested simultaneously and separately along with the detection of<br>
the p24 antigen and antibodies to HIV.<br>
The HIV Ag &amp; Ab EIA Comb device is a visual, rapid, sensitive and accurate<br>
immunoassay for the differential detection of HIV-1 antibodies, HIV-2 antibodies, and<br>
HIV p24 antigen in human serum or plasma by using HIV-1 antigen, HIV-2 antigen and<br>
HIV p24 antibodies immobilized on the specific dots in the Comb.<br>
4<br><br>
The serological events following the HIV infection are represented graphically in figure<br>
1. In individuals infected with HIV, antigen appears first before antibodies of HIV but<br>
due to the seroconversion, the antigen is lost and antibody develops within 2 to 6 weeks<br>
after infection and thereby the level of the antibody increases.<br>
HIV p24 antigen test device for the detection of the specific p24 antigen is a test device<br>
for the early and rapid detection of the HIV in human body. Antigen can generally only<br>
be detected during the acute and during the symptomatic phase of AIDS. Antibodies to<br>
HIV 1 &amp; 2 can be detected throughout virtually the entire infection period. When the HIV<br>
virus enters into the body, the earlier detection of the disease is impossible because the<br>
virus enters in a window phase and subsequently the immune system start<br>
producing antibodies. So the use of highly sensitive antibody assays is therefore an<br>
established approach in serodiagnosis of HIV infection. Progressive improvements in<br>
assay sensitivity have reduced that window phase. Further shortening of this period can<br>
be achieved by the incorporation of HIV antigen detection in such antibody tests enabling<br>
the detection of the infected individuals at the earliest possible moment. p24 antibody dot<br>
detects the specific p24 antigens of HIV. So early detection of HIV is possible.<br>
The present invention device contains a Comb which is made of polystyrene plastic,<br>
having eight individual teeth, each a separate test spaced to fit in to a standard 96 micro<br>
titer wells in which assay is to be performed. Each comb consists of 4 dots immobilized<br>
on one side of each tooth of polystyrene comb. This comb is provided with an inbuilt<br>
control dot. The lowest dot is the dot for the detection of HIV-1 antibodies, the dot above<br>
the lowest dot (HIV 1 detection dot) is for the detection of the HIV-2 antibodies, the dot<br>
above the dot for the detection of the HIV-2 is p24 antigen detection dot and the dot at<br>
the top is the inbuilt control dot. The location of all these three dots (HIV 1 Ag, HIV 2<br>
Ag and p24 antibody) are interchangeable except the control dot.<br>
The control dot is immobilized with the monoclonal or polyclonal antihuman IgG of<br>
chicken, donkey, horse or rabbit. The detection dot for the detection of the p24 antigen is<br>
coated with the specific p24 monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies , detection dot for the<br>
detection of HIV 1 is coated with recombinant protein/ peptide or modified version in the<br>
form of biotinylated recombinant protein/ peptide such as gp 41 and C terminus of gp 120<br>
5<br><br>
and HIV-2 detection dot is coated with recombinant protein / peptide or biotinylated<br>
recombinant protein/ peptide immunodominant epitopes of gp 36.<br>
"HIV Ag&amp; Ab EIA" Comb is based on enzyme immunoassay and employs the binding of<br>
enzyme with chromogenic substrate to visualize the immobilized immune complex.<br>
HIV -1 and HIV-2 antigens and p24 antibodies are immobilized as circular dots on the<br>
polystyerene comb as shown in the figure 2.<br>
When the comb is incubated with the specimen containing HIV-1, HIV-2 antibodies and<br>
p 24 antigen, these antibodies bind specifically to the antigen and p24 antigen bind to the<br>
p24 antibodies. The comb is washed to remove unbound antibodies and antigens. The<br>
comb is then incubated in micro wells containing enzyme conjugate. This conjugate will<br>
bind to the antigen- antibody/ antibody - antigen complex present on the comb. Then the<br>
comb is placed in the micro wells containing substrate solution and is incubated for eight<br>
minutes. The unbound conjugate will react with substrate. The results can be readable<br>
from the gray -blue coloured dots on the comb as shown in the figure 3.<br>
