				<td>Description<br>
Arrangement having a field device and a converter device, and<br>
method for their operation<br>
The invention relates to an arrangement having at least one<br>
field device, in particular a protective device and having at<br>
least one converter device which is connected to the field<br>
device and is suitable for connection to a power transmission<br>
line.<br>
Protective devices for power transmission systems are marketed,<br>
for example, by Siemens AG under the product name SIPROTEC. The<br>
method of operation of the SIPROTEC protective device can be<br>
adjusted from the outside via a network or data bus connection<br>
before commissioning, by a process of configuring the device.<br>
During operation of the protective device, digital sample data<br>
is fed into the protective device, and is evaluated. If the<br>
protective device finds during this evaluation that the sample<br>
data indicates a fault, a fault signal or alarm signal is<br>
produced.<br>
The invention is based on the object of further developing an<br>
arrangement of the type mentioned initially such that the<br>
serviceability of the protective device can be tested<br>
particularly easily.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by the<br>
characterizing features of claim 1. Advantageous refinements of<br>
the arrangement according to the invention are specified in<br>
dependent claims.<br>
The invention accordingly provides for the field device and<br>
converter device to be connected to one another via a closed<br>
data transmission ring.<br><br>
One major advantage of the arrangement according to the<br>
invention is that the field device can be tested within the<br><br>
arrangement without any interruption occurring in the data<br>
communication between the field device and the converter<br>
device. This is because the data transmission ring which s<br>
provided according to the invention makes it possible to ensure<br>
that a test device can be connected from the outside to the<br>
arrangement and thus to the field device without having to<br>
disconnect the data connection between the field device and the<br>
converter device for this purpose. This is because the ring<br>
structure of a data transmission ring means that t here are<br>
always two data transmission paths between the field device and<br>
the converter device, as a result of which one of the two data<br>
transmission paths can be disconnected in order to connect a.<br>
test device to the data transmission ring; the data connection<br>
between the field device and the converter device is<br>
nevertheless maintained in this case because the other data<br>
transmission path in each case will still remain for the<br>
connection between the field device and the converter device.<br>
In summary, the connection, which is provided according to the<br>
invention, is in the form of a ring and is therefore redundant,<br>
between the field device and the converter device thus allows a<br>
test device to be connected while the arrangement is being<br>
operated, without any need to disconnect the devices or<br>
interrupt the data connection for this purpose.<br>
In order to ensure that a test device can be connected<br>
particularly quickly and easily to the data transmission ring,<br>
it is considered to be advantageous for an additional switching<br>
device to be connected to the data transmission ring, whicn<br>
additional switching device is suitable for use as an interface<br>
for connection of a test device and can be used in a<br>
corresponding manner.<br>
With regard to particularly high data transmission rates, it is<br>
considered to be advantageous for the data transmission ring to<br>
be formed by an optically operating ring; this is because<br>
optically operating data transmission rings allow data packets<br><br>
to be transmitted up to the Gigabit range.<br><br>
The data transmission ring is preferably an Ethernet ring, so<br>
that it is possible to make use of the Ethernet technology that<br>
is known in the field of data transmission. For example, the<br>
IEC61850 Standard is used for transmission of communication<br>
protocols, preferably based on the real-time Ethernet process<br>
and the IEC61784-2 Standard. It is particularly preferable tor<br>
the data transmission ring to operate in what is referred to as<br>
real time, for example based on the Profinet-i_RTE Standard.<br>
The already mentioned switching device as an additional<br>
component of the data transmission ring is preferably formed by<br>
an Ethernet switch in the form of a 3-port switch, for example<br>
as is described in German laid-open specification DE 102 60 806<br>
A1. 3-port switches such as these are preferably formed by<br>
monolithically integrated components, in particular based on<br>
FPGA or ASIC.<br>
If it is intended to save an additional switching device for<br>
connection of a test device, the test device can also be<br>
connected directly to the data transmission ring; this is<br>
because, as already mentioned initially, the data transmission<br>
ring can be disconnected for connection of the test device<br>
without any possibility of data being lost since one<br>
transmission path in the data transmission ring is always<br>
available for communication.<br>
Apart from this, it is also possible to accommodate the test<br>
device in the converter device in order to allow the field<br>
device to be tested with the converter device.<br>
It is particularly preferable for the field device to be<br>
designed such that it produces a copy of its field device<br>
application - that is to say in the specialist ,anguage the<br>
software for controlling the operation of the field device - in<br>
the form of an application copy during test operation. The<br>
field device can then continue to operate without any change<br><br>
during the device test by the test device: for example he<br>
application<br><br>
copy is tested during the device test; alternatively, the fieic<br>
device application can also be tested during the device test,<br>
in which case the field device continues to operate on the<br>
basis of the application copy.<br>
It is particularly preferable for the field device to be<br>
designed such that it can switch backwards and forwards between<br>
the field device application and the application copy in order<br>
to allow both the field device application and the application<br>
copy to be checked. In this case, field device operation is<br>
therefore maintained on the basis of the application copy at<br>
times and on the basis of the field device application at<br>
times; in a corresponding manner, the field device application<br>
is tested at times and the application copy is tested at times,<br>
to be precise for example until both the field device<br>
application and the application copy have been completely<br>
tested.<br>
The backward and forward switching between the field device<br>
application and the application copy for device operation and<br>
test operation preferably takes place "on the fly", that is to<br>
say without any interruption, thus allowing a complete device<br>
test, and also a repeat device test, during normal device<br>
operation.<br>
The invention also relates to a method for testing a field<br>
device which is arranged in an arrangement - as described<br>
initially.<br>
According to the invention, provision is made in this context<br>
for a test device which is connected to the data transmission<br>
ring to produce test frequencies which are transmitted via the<br>
data transmission ring to the field device.<br>
Advantageous refinements of the method according to the<br>
invention are specified in dependent claims.<br><br>
With regard to the advantages of the method according to the<br>
invention, reference should be made to the above statements<br>
relating to the arrangement according to the invention.<br>
Apart from this, it should be mentioned that the refinement or<br>
the field device as described above is regarded as an<br>
autonomous invention. Specifically, it is therefore likewise<br>
regarded as an invention to design a field device such that it<br>
produces a copy of its field device application in the form of<br>
an application copy for test operation and maintains field<br>
device operation during the device test by a test device,<br>
irrespective of whether this is on the basis of the field<br>
device application or on the basis of the application copy.<br>
This refinement of the field device is therefore regarded as an<br>
invention irrespective of whether the field device is or is nor<br>
connected to a converter device via a closed data transmission<br>
ring or in some other manner, for example an already known<br>
manner.<br>
A test method in which a field device is tested while it is<br>
operating by accessing an application copy, irrespective of<br>
whether this is for test operation or for device operation, is<br>
also regarded as an autonomous invention, to be precise<br>
irrespective of whether the field device is or is not connected<br>
to a converter device via a closed data transmi ssion ring or in<br>
some other manner, for example an already known manner.<br>
The invention will be explained in more detail in the following<br>
text with reference to exemplary embodiments; in this case, by<br>
way of example:<br>
figure 1 shows one exemplary embodiment of an arrangement<br>
according to the invention in which a test device is<br>
connected via an additional switching device to a<br>
data transmission ring,<br><br>
figure 2 shows a second exemplary embodiment of an arrangement<br>
according to the invention, in which a test<br><br>
device is connected directly to a data transmission<br>
ring, and<br>
figure 3 shows a third exemplary embodiment of an arrangement<br>
according to the invention, in which a test device<br>
for testing a field device is contained in a<br>
converter device.<br>
For the sake of clarity, the same reference symbols are always<br>
used for identical or comparable components in figures 1 to 3.<br>
Figure 1 shows an arrangement 10 with a protective device 20<br>
and a bay controller 30, which are connected to one another and<br>
to a converter device 50 via a closed dat.a transmission ring 40<br>
in the form of a real-time Ethernet ring.<br>
In addition, an additional switching device 60, which is an<br>
Ethernet switch in the form of a 3-port switch, is connected to<br>
the data transmission ring 40. By way of example, the Ethernet<br>
switch 60 may be formed by a 3-port switch as is described in<br>
German laid-open specification DE 102 60 806 A1.<br>
Figure 1 furthermore shows that a test device 70, by means of<br>
which the protective device 20 or the bay controller 30 can be<br>
tested can be connected to that Ethernet switch 60. By way of<br>
example, the following text is based on the assumption that the<br>
protective device 20 is intended to be subjected to a test.<br>
Current transformers and voltage transformers, which are<br>
annotated with the reference symbol 80, are connected to the<br>
converter device 50. These current and voltage transformers 80<br>
are connected to a power transmission line, which is not<br>
illustrated any further in figure 1 for clarity reasons, and<br>
detect current and voltage values which are detected by the<br><br>
converter device 50 and are transmitted in the form of Ethernet<br>
data packets to the protective device 20 and the bay controller<br>
30.<br>
The arrangement 10 shown in figure 1 can be operated, for<br>
example, as follows:<br>
When it is intended to subject the protective device 20 to a<br>
device test, then the test device 70 is, for example, connected<br>
to the Ethernet switch 60 without this leading to an<br>
interruption in the data connection between the protective<br>
device 20 and the converter device 50. Data interruption is<br>
precluded because the Ethernet switch 60 is already a component<br>
of the data transmission ring 40, ana because the data<br>
transmission ring 40 has a total of two transmission paths<br>
between the protective device 20 and the converter device 50,<br>
specifically a first transmission path 100 on the left in<br>
figure 1 and a transmission path 110 on the right in figure 1.<br>
A connection between the protective device 20 and the converter<br>
device 50 is therefore also maintained when one of the two<br>
transmission paths 100 or 110 is briefly interrupted.<br>
After connection of the test device 70 to the transmission ring<br>
40, test sequences or test message sequences are produced by<br>
the test device 70 and are transmitted to the protective device<br>
20 via the data transmission ring 40.<br>
In order now to make it possible for the protective device 20<br>
to maintain its protective function without any interruption<br>
even during a device test such as this, the protective device<br>
20 as shown in figure 1 is designed such that it makes a copy<br>
of its protective device application for a device test, and<br>
this is available as an application copy. The existence of this<br>
application copy makes it possible not only to operate the<br>
protective device 20 in the normal protective device mode -<br>
also referred to as normal operation in the following text -<br><br>
but also to test it in parallel with this. This test mode can<br>
be carried out, for example, on the basis of the application<br>
copy, since the<br><br>
application copy represents a preferably 1:1 copy of the field<br>
device application, and is therefore preferably identical to<br>
it. The field device 20 can continue to operate normally during<br>
a test mode such as this on the basis of its field device<br>
application, and can process the converter data of the<br>
converter device 50 further.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to maintain normal operation of<br>
the protective device 20 on the basis of the application copy<br>
and to process the data of the converter device 50 further with<br>
the aid of the application copy in the protective device 20; in<br>
this procedure, the device test is therefore carried out on the<br>
basis of the original field device application.<br>
Furthermore, it is also possible to test both the field device<br>
application and the application copy; a complete test such as<br>
this can in this case be carried out by testing the field<br>
device application first of all and then testing the<br>
application copy - or vice versa; alternatively, a "parallel"<br>
test can be carried out instead of this. By way of example, a<br>
parallel test such as this can be carried out by regularly<br>
switching backwards and forwards between the field device<br>
application and the application copy, as a result of which the<br>
field device application and the application copy are tested<br>
alternately in parts, and normal operation is carried out in a<br>
correspondingly switched manner alternately on the basis of the<br>
application copy and of the field device application.<br>
The bay controller 30 can also be tested in a corresponding<br>
manner by the test device 70.<br>
The data transmission ring 40 preferably operates on the basis<br>
of communication protocols according to IEC Standard 61850,<br>
preferably based on the real-time Ethernet draft IEC Standard<br>
61784.2, or similar draft standards based on optical data<br>
transmission.<br><br>
By way of example, the converter device 50 can be formed by a<br>
converter electronics unit which comprises secondary current<br>
and voltage transformers and/or processes current and voltage<br>
measured values further in the form of digital data. In order<br>
to transmit the digital converter data that is produced by the<br>
converter device 50 to the protective device 20 or to the oay<br>
controller 30, this data is mapped onto real-time Ethernet<br>
channels and is transmitted via the data transmission ring 40<br>
to the protective device 20 or to the Day controller 30. The<br>
data transmission ring 40 preferably forms a redundant,<br>
deterministic communication system with a real-time capability,<br>
so that any interruption in the communication ring cannot lead<br>
to a failure of the protective function of the protective<br>
device 20 or of the bay controller 30.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a second exemplary embodiment of an<br>
arrangement. This shows a protective device 20, a bay<br>
controller 30 and a converter device 50, which are connected to<br>
one another via a data transmission ring 40. In contrast to the<br>
first exemplary embodiment shown in figure 1, the test device<br>
7 0 is not connected via the Ethernet switch 60 to the data<br>
transmission ring 40, but by disconnection of the transmission<br>
path 110 and connection of the test device 70 in between. The<br>
transmission path 110 is in this case briefly interrupted in<br>
order to allow the test device 70 to be integrated in the data<br>
transmission ring 40. However, this does not lead to an<br>
interruption in data transmission between the protective device<br>
20, the bay controller 30 and the converter device 50 because<br>
the transmission path 100 is still available, without any<br>
interruption.<br>
In this case, the Ethernet switch 60 can be used for connection<br>
of other devices; alternatively, the Ethernet switch 60 can<br>
also be saved if it is not required for connection of further<br>
components.<br><br>
Figure 3 shows a third exemplary embodiment, of an arrangement.<br>
This once again shows a data transmission ring 40 to which a<br>
protective device 20, a bay controller 30 and a converter<br>
device 50 are connected. In order to test the protective device<br>
20 and/or the bay controller 30, a test device 70 is integrated<br>
within the converter device 50 and forms an integral component<br>
of the converter electronics of the converter device 50. The<br>
converter device 50 is therefore able to transmit test;<br>
sequences to the protective device 20 and/or to the bay<br>
controller 30 in order to test it. In the exemplary embodiment<br>
shown in figure 3, the Ethernet switch 60 for connection of<br>
further components can also be used or omitted.<br>
The protective device 20 and the bay controller 30 preferably<br>
each contain a microprocessor device with a memory in which an<br>
application copy, which has been made by the microprocessor<br>
device, of the field device application can be stored for the<br>
device test.<br><br>
