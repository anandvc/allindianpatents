(c) in the formula (1), each of A and D is such as to provide a dye compound selected from compounds of the formulae<br><br><br><br><br>
When at least one of the amine of the formula (10) and the coupling component of the formula (11) carries an<br><br>
-SO2F group, the process comprises the preliminary step of<br><br>
(i) reacting at least one of the amine of the formula (10) and the coupling component of the formula (11), after protecting the amino group of the said amine if necessary, with chlorosulphonic acid, optionally in the presence of dimethylformamide and thionylchloride at a temperature of 30 to 1400C to obtain the corresponding chlorosulphdnyl derivative thereof and reacting the said chlorosulphonyl derivative with potassium chloride in a boiling aqueous medium to obtain at least one of the amine of the formula (10) and the coupling component of the formula (11) having an —SO2F group substituted directly thereon or attached to a substitueht thereof; or<br><br>
(ii) sulphonating at least one of the amine of the formula (10) and the coupling component of the formula (11) by reaction thereof with oleum or sulphuric acid to give the corresponding sulphonic acid derivative;<br><br>
optionally forming an inorganic salt or ester of the suiphonic acid derivative;<br><br>
reacting one of the sulphonic acid derivative, inorganic salt and ester thereof, for conversion thereof to the corresponding chlorosulphonyl derivative, with thionylchloride, optionally in the presence of a chlorophosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychloride<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
on phosphorus pentachloride in an organic liquid such as an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of from 200C to 1100C; and<br><br>
reacting the said chlorosulphonyl derivative with potassium chloride in a boiling aqueous medium to obtain at least one of the amine of the formula (10) and the coupling componen.t of the formula (11) having an -SO2F group substituted directly thereon or attached to a substituent thereof.<br><br>
A synthetic textile material or fibre blend thereof may be coloured by a process which comprises applying to the synthetic textile material a compound or mixture thereof, which is free from water solubilising groups, of Formula (1), prepared as described above.<br><br>
Different compounds of Formula (1) may be mixed or the compounds of Formula (1) may be mixed with dyes which do not contain an —SO2F group. The mixtures may be simple physical mixtures or may be mixed crystals formed for example by co-crystallisation. Sdch mixtures generally show improvement in dyeing properties. Crystalline modifications of compounds of Formula (1) exist and it is intended that the present definition includes such crystalline modifications which may be formed by heat treatment.<br><br>
The presence of one or more —SO2F groups in a dye molecule generally improves the properties of that dye and confers surprisingly good wet-fastness and lightfastness properties.<br><br>
One such process for manufacturing a coloured synthetic textile material or fibre blend thereof comprises applying to the synthetic textile material a compound or mixture thereof, which is free from water<br><br>
solubilising groups, of Formula (1) ~.4herein A and D each independently is an optionally substituted heterocyclic or carbocyclic group in which at least one of A and D carries directly at least one -SO2F group or carries a substituent to which at least one -SO2F group is attached and at least one of A and D carries directly at least one ester group or carries a substituent to which at least one ester group is attached, in accordance with requirement (a) a~bove.<br><br>
Azo dyes containing both an -SO2F and an ester group have improved performances in wash fastness properties over azo dyes carrying only an -SO2F group.<br><br>
The synthetic textile material may be selected from secondary cellulose acetate, cellulose triacetate, polyamide, polyacrylonitrile and aromatic polyester. The synthetic textile material is preferably polyamide or aromatic polyester, more preferably aromatic polyester such as polyhexamethylene adipamide or polyethylene terephthalate and especially polyethylene terephthalate. Fibre blends may comprise mixtures of different synthetic textile materials or mixtures of synthetic and natural textile materials. Preferred fibre blends are those of polyester cellulose such as polyester-cotton. The textile materials or blends thereof may be in the fbrm of filaments, loose fibres, yarn, woven or knitted fibres.<br><br>
Another such process for colouring a polyester textile material or fibre blend thereof comprises applying to the polyester textile material a compound or mixture thereof, which is free from water solubilising groups, of Formula (1) in which A and D are each independently in an optionally substituted phenyl group and one of A and D carries a 4-SO2F group, except for 4-<br><br>
(4-fluorosulphonylphenylazo) —N,N—dimethylaniline, provided that one of A and D does not carry an<br><br>
-NHCH2CH (OH) CH2Cl, -NCOCH2Cl or -NCH2CH2SO2F substituent. The dye compounds of Formula (1) preferably have low<br><br>
solubility in water, typically less than 1% preferably less than 0.5% and especially less than 0.2% solubility in water. The dyes of Formula (1) are thus free from water solubilising groups such as —SO3H, —CO2H, —PO3H and quaternary amino.<br><br>
The dye compounds of Formula (1), optionally in conjunction with other disperse dyes may be applied to the synthetic textile materials or fibre blends thereof by methods which are conventionally employed in dyeing disperse dyes to such materials and fibre blends.<br><br>
The process conditions may be selected from the following<br><br>
i) exhaust dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 1250C to 1400C for from 10 to 120 minutes and under a pressure of from 1 to 2 bar; a sequestrant may be optionally added;<br><br>
ii) continuous dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 1900C to 2250C for from 15 seconds to 5 minutes; a migration inhibitor may optionally be added; iii) printing direct at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 1600C to 1850C for 4 to 15 minutes for high temperature steaming, or at a temperature of from 1900C to 2250C for 15 seconds to 5 minutes for bake fixation with dry heat or at a temperature of from 1200C to 1400C and 1 to 2 bar for 10 to 45 minutes for pressure steaming; wetting agents and thickeners (such as alginates) •of from 5 to 100% by weight of the dye may be optionally be added;<br><br><br><br><br>
iv) discharge printing (by padding the dye. onto the textile material, drying and overprinting) at a pH of from 4 to 6.5; migration inhibitors and thickeners may optionally be added;<br><br>
v) carrier dyeing at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of from 950C to 1000C using a carrier such as methylnaphthalene, diphenylamine or 2-phenylphenol; sequestrants may optionally be added; and<br><br>
vi) atmospheric dyeing of acetate, triacetate and nylon at a pH of from 4 to 6.5, at a temperature of 850C for acetate or at a temperature of 900C for triacetate and nylon for from 15 to 90 minutes; sequestrants may optionally be added.<br><br>
In all of the above processes the dye compound of Formula (1) is applied as a dispersion comprising from 0.001% to 4% of the compound in aqueous medium.<br><br>

Azo dye compounds prepared by a process of the 5 invention and in which, in Formula (1), requirement (b)<br><br>
is satisfied, are also novel compounds. Such azo dye compounds are selected from compounds of formulae (3), (4), (5) and (7) as defined with reference to requirement (b) above. These compounds differ from the corresponding<br><br>
10	compounds of formulae (3), (4), (5) and (7) defined with reference to requirement (a) in that<br><br>
(i) such compounds need not necessarily contain an ester group as defined in requirement. (a);<br><br>

and K'0, K", K'3 and K'4 each independently is H, alkoxy, 20 alkyl, NO2, —SO2F, F, Cl, Br, I or —CN.<br><br>
Azo dye compounds prepared by a process of the invention, in which, in Formula (1), requirement (c) is satisfied, are also novel compounds of the respective formulae (267), (268), (269), (273), (275), (276), (277)<br><br>
25	and (278), as defined with reference to requirement (c) above.<br><br>
Compositions comprising dispersions of the compounds of Formula (1) prepared by the process of the present invention may be formulated. The compositions typically<br><br>
comprise from 1% to 30% of the compound of Formula (1) in<br><br>
an aqueous medium. The compositions are preferably<br><br>
buffered at pH 2 to 7 more preferably at pH 4 to 6. These dispersions may further comprise ingredients<br><br>
5	conventionally used in dyeing applications such as dispersing agents for example lignosulphonates, naphthalene sulphonic acid/formaldehyde condensates or phenol/cresol/sulphani lic acid/formaldehyde condensates, surfactants, wetting agents such as alkyl aryl<br><br>
10	ethoxylates which may be sulphonated or phosphated, inorganic salts, de—foamers such as mineral oil or nonanol, organic liquids and buffers. Dispersing agents may be present at from 10% to 200% on the weight of the compound of Formula (1) . Wetting agents may be used at<br><br>
15	from 0% to 20% on the weight of the compound (1) . The dispersions may be preparedby bead milling the compound of Formula (1) with glass beads or sand in an aqueous medium.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, the compounds of 20 Formula (1) are obtained by usual methods -for the<br><br>
preparation of azo compounds such as by diazotisation of an amine of Formula A-NH2 and coupling onto a component DX in which A and D are as hereinbefore defined and X is a group displaceable by a diazotised amine. Typically the<br><br>
25	amine, A—NH2 may be diazotised in an acidic medium, such as acetic, propionic or hydrochloric acid using a nitrosating agent such as nitrosylsulphuric acid, sodium nitrite or methylnitrite at a temperature from —100C to 100C. Coupling onto the component D-X may be achieved by<br><br>
adding the diazotised amine to a mixture of D—X in an alkanol such as methanol at a temperature from 0CC to 100C. After coupling the compound of Formula (1) may be recovered from the reaction mixture by any convenient<br>
	5	means such as by filtration.<br><br>
Fluorosulphonyl groups may be introduced into the compounds of Formula (1) or into the A and D components prior to coupling by methods generally available in the literature. For example reaction of the compound of<br><br>
10	Formula (1), A—NH2, the NH2 being protected as necessary, or D-X, in which A, and D are as hereinbefore defined, with chlorosulphonic acid optionally in the presence of dimethylformamide and thionylchloride at a temperature of from 300C to 1400C gives the chlorosulphonyl derivative.<br><br>
15	The chlorosulphonyl derivative may be reacted in boiling aqueous media with potassium fluoride to give the fluorosulphonyl derivative.<br><br>
Alternatively the compound of Formula (1), A-NH2 or D—X may be sulphonated with sulphuric acid or oleum to<br><br>
20	give the sulphonic acid derivative which may be converted to the chlorosulphonyl derivative by reaction, either of the free acid or an inorganic salt thereof, with thionyichioride optionally in the presence of a chlorophosphorus compound such as phosphorus oxychloride<br><br>
25	or phosphorus pentachloride in an organic liquid such as an aromatic hydrocarbon at a temperature of from 200C to 1100C. Similarly a sulphonate ester may be converted to the corresponding chlorosulphonyl derivative. The<br><br>
chlorosulphonyl derivative may then be converted to the fluorosuiphonyl derivative as described above.<br><br>
The compounds of Formulae (1) are useful for the coloration of synthetic textile materials particularly polyester textile materials and fibre blends thereof to which they impart colours which have excellent wet and light fastness properties.<br>

agent such as nitrosylsulphuric acid, sodium nitrite or methylnitrite in an acid medium such as acetic, propionic or hydrochloric and at a temperature of from -100C to + 100C to form a diazotised amine;<br>
(2)	coupling the diazotised amine with a coupling component of the formula (11)<br>
	D-X	(11)<br>
wherein X is a group displaceable by the diazotised amine<br>
and D is as defined above, by adding the diazotised amine to a mixture of the<br>
coupling component of the formula (11) in an alkanol such as methanol at a temperature of from 0 to 100C to form a monoazo compound of the formula (1) and wherein at least one of the following requirements is satisfied:<br>
