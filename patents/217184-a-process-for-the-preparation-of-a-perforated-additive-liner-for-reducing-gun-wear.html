				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a perforated additive liner for use along with Combustible Cartridge Case (CCC) Ammunition, for improving barrel life by reducing the gun wear.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
To save precious metal (lie replacement of costly brass cartridge case by Combustible Cartridge Case (CCC), in high calibre gun Ammunition has been in vogue. This replacement of brass cartridge case with CCC, saves manufacturing effort and reduces overall production cost while saving precious metal. With the increased demand of high performance of guns which deliver ammunition at very high muzzle velocity, use of high impetus propellant has become necessary. While the brass cartridge cases protected the inside of gun from the action of flame, in the present scenario this changeover to CCC has not been very satisfactory. The high flame temperature of the charge, increases gun barrel temperature, reducing number of round that can be continuously discharged per cycle-round, to allow the gun to return to ambient temperature. This high increase of barrel temperature, causes pitting of the gun inside. The unburned residue of the CCC also adversely effects the gun life, and during conflict, exposes the gun location by discharge of unburned CCC particles and muzzle flash, which are thrown out in the open-air alongside the projectile. The aforesaidi drawbacks has been the major reason for the reduction of useful life of guns, which are necessarily caused by the action of solid . propellant, which is highly reactive, coming in direct contact with the inside of the gun material at very high temperature and pressure. Weapon designers have tried to resolve this problem by adopting different approaches, such as barrel material modification, use of low flame temperature propellant and the use of wear reducing additives.<br>
The phenomenon of barrel erosion is attributed to, chemical and mechanical effects. The effect of barrel erosion by thermal means is controlled by the use of wear reducing additives. Prominent among the wear reducing materials being used for the purpose are titanium dioxide,. Talc and polyurethane.<br>
One  of the additive composition known in the  art<br>
comprises  of  A7. sodium or potassium  water  glass  end flash suppressant volatile admixture, which  is  placed<br>
adjacent  to  every props11ant grain charge  by  way of coating  or  the additive composition  is  alternatively<br>
applied on a combustible case, for reducing muzzle flash and reduce gun erosion.<br>
The   main   disadvantage   of   above    additive<br>
composition  is  that it has an adverse  effect  on  the range of projectile due to reduce  prope11ant charge  to<br>
accommodate  additive  mixture,  and  that  the   proper configuration  and homogeneity is difficult to  achieve.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that sublimation occurs even at room temperature which causes loss of flash reducer.<br>
Another composition known in the art  incorporates one  of the erosion and flash additives like  TiO.sub.2,<br>
talc, K.sub.2 SO.sub.4, KNO.sub.3 on a wax cloth lin*r. The  main  drawback of above composition  is  that<br>
initially  the  flames do not directly come  in  contact with  CCC, this leaves some unburned residue of the  CCC<br>
at  the  time  of projectiles  emergence  from  the  gun<br>
barrel, which adversely effects the gun life.<br>
Another  drawback  of such a composition  is  that<br>
throwing out of unburned CCC particles during firing .and muzzle flash ex pose's the gun location.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the presont invention is  to<br>
provide  a  perforated  udditlve liner  treated  with a composition  involving  mixture  of  hydrated  magnesium<br>
silicate  (laic), Max and stearyl alcohol  (referred  to hereafter  in this specification a«  'wax—talc'  treated<br>
perforated  additive liner) and wax for use with CCC  in high caliber tank qun ammunition for reducing gun wear.<br>
Another  object  of the present  invention  is  to provide  a  wax—talc treated perforated  additive  liner<br>
which  regulates  exposure  of  the  CCC  to  the   high temperature flame produced by the prope11ant, by way  of<br>
perforations in the coated liner media and also  ensures complete burning of CCC inside the gun barrel.<br>
Still  another object of the present invention  is<br>
to provide » wax-talc treated perforated additive  liner for  use  with CCC in high caliber tank  gun  ammunition<br>
which is completely reliable.<br>
Further  object  of the present  invention  is  to<br>
provide a wax—talc treated perforated additive liner for use  with CCC in high caliber tank gun ammunition  which<br>
minimises the contact of flame at high temperature  with gun  barrel thereby reducing the degradation  of  barrel<br>
inside due to transfer of thermal energy.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is  to provide a wax—talc treated perforated liner for use with<br>
CCC  in high caliber tank gun ammunition which  prevents delayed  or incomplete combustion of CCC, and leaves  no<br>
CCC residue inside gun barrel so that the barrel  inside does not get coated with the residue.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
According  to this invention there is  provided  a process  for  the preparation of a  perforated  additive liner  for  use  with combustible  cartridge  cases  for reducing gun wear which comprises in the steps of i-<br>
(a)   preparing a talc-wax mixture by  mixing  powdered<br>
talc  (hydrated magnesium silicate),  Max  mixture and stearyl alcohol,<br>
(b)   coating said talc-wax mixture on gauze cloth, (c)   perforating the additive liner.<br>
In  accordance  with the  present  invention,  •the perforated   additive  liner  comprises  of   a   coated<br>
substrate fabric material such that it does not obstruct the  propel1 ant  flame from reaching the CCC  while  the<br>
coating  on  the liner  provides  wear/erosion  reducing factors.   There  is  also  means  for  quenching  heat,<br>
produced by the propellant mix, which is provided by  an additive  to  the liner.  The additive is  comprised  of<br>
wax—talc  mixture and does not leave any  residue  after burn—out.   Talc—wax  mixture  is  uniformly  coated  on<br>
cotton  gauze  cloth  and is  then  placed  between  th» propellant  bed  and  CCC.   During  the  combustion  of<br>
propellant these wear reducing materials form a  laminar cool  layer between the hot gases and the inside of  gun<br>
barrel,  thereby  reducing transfer of heat to  the  gun barrel.   In  operation the liner need  only  be  placed<br>
proximate to said propellant and vicinal to the base  of<br>
said projectile.  Additionally the liner may be  located within  a propelling charge container, preferably.  Maid<br>
liner  is  located  juxtaposed to  the  said  propelling charge container and said propellant which are proximate<br>
and in communication with the inside of th* gun barrel. The  present  invention will now be  described  in<br>
detail  and  illustrated with reference  to  an  example which is  intended to be a typical example to illustrate<br>
the  working  of the invention and is  not  intended  to imply  any  limitation  on  the  scope  of  the  present<br>
invention. PREPARATION OF LINER<br>
The  process  of preparation of  perforated  liner<br>
comprises of the following steps :-a)     Preparing  a mixture of 45 to 55%  powdered  talc<br>
(hydrated magnesium silicate (3MgO, 48 i(^ , H^ O) of 2 to<br>
3  micron particle size and wax mixture (of  slip  point not  less than 75 C) 45 to 55%  VAX (of slip  point  not<br>
less than 75 C with stearyl alcohol 1 to 2%).<br>
b)    Coating of talc VAX mixture on on* Bide of gauze cloth to uniform thickness of 0.8 to 1.00 mm.<br>
c)	Cutting the coated sheet to the required size,  to<br>
avoid  overlapping while fixing on the internal  surface<br>
of the CCC.<br>
d)	Perforating  the  additive  liner   to   realize<br>
perforation size 2.5 to 3.00 mm diameter, adjusting  the<br>
perforation in such a May that alternate line	of<br>
perforation Mill fall in the same line and that	the<br>
distance between periphery of two adjacent holes	is<br>
maintained at 6 to 7 mm apart (Fig. 1).<br>
APPLICATION OF LINER;<br>
Fixing  of  the additive liner to the  CCC  inside<br>
surface is done with the help of any suitable  flaiMMble adhesive  cement (known in the art) applied on the  side<br>
not coated with talc-wax composition.  This adhesive  is of  the  type  that does not  leave  any  residue  after<br>
burning.   The  size of the liner is  adjusted  to just, cover the inside of CCC without overlap.  In  operation*<br>
the  liner  need  only  be  placed  proximate  to  said propellant  and vicinal to the base of said  projectile.Additionally the liner may be located within • propelling charge container, preferably, said liner im<br>
located juxtaposed to the said propelling charge container and said propellant which are proximate and in<br>
communication with the inside of the gun barrel.<br>
