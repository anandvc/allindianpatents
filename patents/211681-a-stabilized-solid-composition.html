greatly increased utility of gabapentm as she therapeutic agents Cor those diseases or disorders or conditions as recited above, in addition to cerebral diseases such as epilepsy ana the like-As stared above, gabapentn is a very effective drug for cerebral diseases such as epilepsy and the like, and it has =n extremely low toxicity.  However, in order to maintain the effect as expected, it has beer, administered to adults usually at a single daily dose of 900 - 1800 ng or in some cases a daily dose of up to 2400 rag in three dieided doses.  Thus, a single dose will be in the range of 300 - 60C mg or in some cases up to 800 mg.<br>
Further, gabapentin has difficulties in that it is a drug having a strongly bitter taste and also a very poor fluidity and that an extremely high dosage should be required for administration in the dosage torn-, ot   powders.<br>
Since gaoapantin is very difficult to fomulate because of instability, gabapentin capsules now available in the oversea markets are those manufactured by a simple ary blending of gabapent with necessary auxiliaries and subsequent encapsulating into hard capsules.<br>
However, a single dose is as high as 300 - 600 mc or in some cases up to 800 mg as stated above, which<br><br>
4<br><br><br>
necessitates large-sized capsules; for example, Capsule No.<br>
0 sould te applied to capsules having a content of 400 mg<br>
per capsule   Consequently, ingesting such capsules is<br>
difficult aven for adults, much more for children.  Although<br>
gabapension capsules have already been markated, it is still<br>
inaispsn5ao_e to attempt any improvement in compliance and<br>
easy administrator.trat on of gabapentin, and a demand for a<br>
smalier-sized pharmaceutical preparation of gabapentin<br>
exists in.   the clinical field.	<br>
Gabapentin itself is a powdery material having very poor compression-moldability and fluidity.  Compression molding or granulation has been usually employed for small-sizing or fluidizmg of the drug having such powder propercies end the molding properties should be improved with the aid of pharmaceutical auxiliaries.  However, many of the auxiliaries to be applied for compression molding tend to react wich caoapentir. with lapse cf time :c form 4-cyciohexylpyrroiiccne (the corresponding Lactam form) by accelerating the dehydration reaction between the amino group and trie carboxyl group within the T.c.ecuie of gahapentir. .  This dehydration reaction would te far more accelerated as the gabapentin powder is oerng rr.ore tightly compressed.  Moreover, tne reaction between gabapentin and<br>
6<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
such auxiliaries with lapse of time would be further acceleratec by the use of water or an organic solvent in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation..<br>
It has been standardized in ccrcmercially available gabapentin capsules that an allowable content cf the lactam up to the beyond-use date should be no more than 1.0% in view of safety.  Accordingly, it is necessary in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation of gabapentm to prevent the formation cf the .lactam by retarding the zehyaration reaction aetween the amino group and the carooxyl group within the molecule of gabapentm.  On the other hand, there has been a demand for a small-sized dosage form for easier ingesting ;s discussed above.  Under such circumstances, there have been attempted over years various methods. However, none of these attempts has succeeded either because a large-sized dosage forni resulted due to alarge amount of the auxiliaries used cr because an increser amount of the lactam formed or both of them.<br>
Such instability as encountered in manufacturing a gabaper.tir. preparation has been also observed in other 4-amino-3-SUBSUITUTED-butanoic acid derivatives which are structurally analogous to gabapentm and have a   structurally<br>

and b-methyl- 3-eminomethyl-hexanoic acid, represented by the following structural formula and called "pregabalin" in a generic name,<br>
CH:-CH{CHj)2 H,N-H,C-CH-CH,-COOH<br>
are also a   drug which has very poor compression.nolcability and fluidity like gabapentin.  Compression molding or granulation used for small-sizing or fluiaizir.c ihe drug snould De improved with the aid cf pharmaceutical auxiliaries.  However, many of the auxiliaries to be applied to compression molding tand to react with gaoapentin with lapse of rime to form 4-cyclohexylpyrrol idone (the<br>

WO 99/59572	PCT/US99/I0186<br><br>
corresponding lactam form) by accelerating the dehyaration reaction between the amino group and the carooxyl group within the molecule of the compound.  This cerydration reaction would be far more accelerated as the compound is 5      oeirg /more tightly compressed and would he further<br>
accelerated by the use of water or an organic solvent in manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation, as is the case   of gabapentin.  It may be said that the mechanism of degradation. by the autocondensation is peculiar to the 4-<br>

structurally bulky substituent at the 3-position there of.<br>
Tc the contrary, in y-aminobutyric acid derivatives having no or a less bulky substituent at Che 3-position thereof, such as Y_aminobutyric acid or 4-amino-3-<br>

brought about, even when maintained in a driec state such as at a temperature of 105°c over 2-3 hours. and   the formation of 4-cyclonexylpyrrolidone (the corresponcess lactam form) is not observed.  In other words, in the 4-emino-3-<br>
20      substicuied-butanoic acid derivative wherein the substituent at the 3-position -hereof has a bulky structure, the dehydration reaction could easily be brought about between the amino group and the carboxyl group within she molecule.<br>

WO 99/59572	PCT/US99/I0186<br>
In view of the aforesaid background, for drugs which are 4-amino-3-substltuted-butanoic acid derivatives, including gabapentin, having a structurally bulky substituent at the 3-position thereof, there have been desired a new pharmaceutical preparation containing said drugs which may be small-sized or fiuadized in a dosage form such as tablets or granules and may have a comparable storage stability to commercially available, pharmaceutical preparations including commercially availaole gabapentm capsules, and a process for manufacturing the same.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION we have made earnest studies to solve the prior art problems as stated above and, as a result, have now found that the degradation of 4-amino-3-suDstituted-butanoic acid derivatives including gabapentin owing    to the lactam formation curing the formulation and .storage :an be prevented by blocking the evaporation and movement of a very small amout of residual water in a solid composition containing the A - amino-5-substituted-butanoic acid cerivative manufactured, irrespective of formulation methods employed, that it is effective to add a humectant es a stabilizer against decradation and that a solid composition containing<br><br><br>
the 4 -amino-3-subtituted butanoic acid derivative stabilised by said humectant and a solid pharmaceutical preparation using said composition such 55 tablets, granules or the  like have an excellent storage stability, en the 5      sasjs cl   wnich this invention has been completed.<br>

such as canapentin may be conducted by any granulation method well-known per s_£, for example, a fluidized cranulaticn method, a high speed stirring granulation method, a melting granulation method and the like.  In order 5      to effectively adhere a stabilizer to bulk powders of the 4-aroino-3-suostituted-butanoic acid derivative, there may be preferably employed a fluidized granulation method in which Dulk powders of the said compound are fluidized and then a stabilizer is sprayed onto the fluidized powders.  Tn this<br>
10      fluidized granulation step, a stabilizer is added in the form of its solution dissolved in water or an organic solvent such as alcohols or the like, whereby a small amount of the stabilizer may be sufficient for uniformly adhering to the surface of bulk powders of the 4-aiPino-3-subsituted<br>
15      butanoic acid derivative.<br>
In the granulation step using said fluidized granulation rxethod. granulation may be carried out by adding to bulk pc^ders of the 4-amino-3-substi-uted-butanoic acid derivative the stabilizer solution as described above and,<br>
2C      if necessary, a binder such as corn starch, a ceiluiose derivative (e.g., hydroxypropyicellulose), polyvinyl alcohol, a polyvinyl pyrrolidone (e.g., Kollidon-K30 or<br>

The aforementioned stabiliser -solution may be applied to oulK powders of the 4-amino- 3-substituted-S      butanoic acid derivative prior to the granulation using the binder or other auxiliaries for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation.  In this granulation step, there may be also incorporated, if necessary, a sweetening agent such as mannitol, sorbitol, xylitol or the like and other<br>
10      auxiliaries for manufacturing a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
The granular powders thus obtained may be used as a pharmaceutical preparation of the

However, we have also found out that a certain neutral amino acid, "hich have hardly been used as a lubricant in compressing drugs, such as L-leucine, L-lsoleucine, L-valine, D-leucine, D-isoleucme, D-valine, DL-leucine, DL-isoleucine or DL-valine or a mixture thereof can exert a remarkable effect as a lubricant for compression-molding into tablets of the present derivative such as gabapentin and that in the tablets thus prepared, there has been no adverse influence on both the stability with lapse of nime and dissolution property provided by the present scab iluer.<br>

It has been believed that an excess water remaining generally in solid preparations including a preparation of the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative would be undesirable since it may cause discoloration, degradation, tabletmg troubles or the like. It is the most significant feature of this invention that, unexpectedly, a stability of a solid preparation of the 4-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivative can be remarkably improved by the addition of a humectant which has a water retention activity and has been considered to trigger unfavorable disturbances in the said preparation as stated above.  Thus, the present invention has now provided a means for stabilizing pharmaceut ically unstable <j-amino-3-substituted-butanoic acid derivatives including gabapentin and further elucidated the principle of this stabilization which have been regarded as problems to be solved in art over many years. a significant effect invention is that wet granulation method using water has widely utilized for small-sized pharmaceutical preparation easily taken by patients can applied having an extremely poor voidability without causing any degradation gabapentin. present></j-amino-3-substituted-butanoic>
