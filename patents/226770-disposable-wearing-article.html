DISPOSABLE WEARING ARTICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable wearing<br>
article used to absorb and then to retain bodily waste<br>
discharged thereon.<br>
BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
There has already been disclosed a disposable diaper<br>
having front and rear waist regions, a crotch region extending<br>
between these two waist regions, and pressure sensitive<br>
adhesive double coated tape strips extending in a transverse<br>
direction and attached to transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions in the front and rear waist regions so that the side<br>
edge portions of the front waist region and the side edge<br>
portions of the rear waist region may be put flat and connected<br>
together by means of these pressure sensitive adhesive double<br>
coated tape strips (See PATENT DOCUMENT 1). A waist-hole and<br>
a pair of leg-holes are formed as the front and rear waist regions<br>
are connected with each other in such manner. Parent or care<br>
personnel may put the article on the wearer's body by guiding<br>
legs of the wearer through the waist-hole, then through the<br>
leg-holes and drawing the article upward along the wearer's<br>
waist.<br>
[0003]<br>
In addition, there has already been disclosed a<br>
disposable wearing article having front and rear waist regions,<br>
a crotch region extending between these two waist regions, and<br>
engagement members extending in a transverse direction and<br>
attached to transversely opposite side edge portions in the<br>
front and rear waist regions so that the side edge portions of<br>
the front waist region and the side edge portions of the rear<br>
waist region may be connected together by means of these<br>
engagement members (See PATENT DOCUMENT 2) . One of the<br>
engagement members is defined by hooks constituting the<br>
so-called mechanical fastener and attached to the outer surface<br>
of the front waist region along the transversely opposite side<br>
edge portions thereof. The other of the engagement members is<br>
defined by loops constituting the mechanical fastener and<br>
attached to the inner surface of the rear waist region along<br>
the transversely opposite side edge portions thereof. Parent<br>
or care personnel may put the article disclosed in Citation 2<br>
on the wearer's body in a manner as follows : along the respective<br>
transversely opposite side edges portions of the front and rear<br>
waist regions, the inner surface of the rear waist region is<br>
placed upon the outer surface of the front waist region; the<br>
hooks and the loops are put in mutual engagement to connect the<br>
front and rear waist regions with each other whereupon a<br>
waist-hole and a pair of leg-holes are formed; then the wearer's<br>
legs are guided through the waist-hole, then through the<br>
leg-holes; and finally the article is drawn upward along the<br>
wearer's waist.<br>
PATENT DOCUMENT 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>

PATENT DOCUMENT 2: Japanese Unexamined Utility Model<br>
Application Publication No. 1994-55623<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]<br>
After the article disclosed in Citation 1 has been put<br>
on the wearer's body with the front and rear waist regions<br>
connected together by means of the pressure sensitive adhesive<br>
double coated tape strips, a peel force intending to release<br>
these double coated tape strips from one another is exerted upon<br>
the transversely opposite side edges of the front and rear waist<br>
regions as these side edge portions of the front and rear waist<br>
regions are pulled by the wearer's waist in a waist surrounding<br>
direction. If an adhesive force between the pressure sensitive<br>
adhesive double coated tape strips is relatively low, it will<br>
be apprehended that the peel force exerted upon the side edge<br>
portions of the front and rear waist regions might readily<br>
release these adhesive double coated tape strips from one<br>
another and thereby the front and rear waist regions might be<br>
unintentionally disconnected from each other as the<br>
transversely opposite side edge portions of the front and rear<br>
waist regions are pulled by the wearer's waist in a waist<br>
surrounding direction.<br>
[0005]<br>
After the article disclosed in Citation 1 has been put<br>
on the wearer's body with the front and rear waist regions<br>
connected together by means of those engagement members, the<br>
hooks and the loops are further tightly engaged one with another<br>
as the front and rear waist regions are pulled by the wearer's<br>
waist in a waist surrounding direction. Depending on a degree<br>
of the pulling force, there is anxiety that the hooks and the<br>
loops might be too tightly engaged with one another to be easily<br>
disengaged from one another for disposal of the article after<br>
the article has been soiled with body waste.<br>
[0006]<br>
In view of the problem as has been described above, it<br>
is an object of the present invention to provide a disposable<br>
wearing article improved so as to eliminate a possibility that<br>
the front and rear waist regions might be unintentionally<br>
disconnected from each other during use of the article and to<br>
ensure that the side edge portions of the front and rear waist<br>
regions can be easily separated from each other.<br>
MEASURE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
[0007]<br>
The object set forth above is achieved, according to the<br>
present invention, by an improvement in the disposable wearing<br>
article having front and rear waist regions, a crotch region<br>
extending between these waist regions and a pair of engagement<br>
members respectively to inner surfaces of transversely opposite<br>
side edge portions of one of the front and rear waist region<br>
so that the side edge portions of these waist regions are<br>
releasably engaged with inner or outer surface of these waist<br>
region by means of the engagement members.<br>
[0008]<br>
The improvement according to the present invention is in<br>
that the engagement members respectively have fixed portions<br>
permanently bonded to the side edge portions of the waist region<br>
and a first free portions extending inward from the fixed<br>
portions in a transverse direction and the first free portions<br>
are formed on respective inner surfaces with hooks constituting<br>
a mechanical fastener.<br>
[0009]<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention,<br>
the fastening means is one of hooks of a mechanical fastener<br>
and adhesive of an adhesive fastener and provided on the inner<br>
surface of the first free portion.<br>
[0010]<br>
According to another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the engagement members respectively include second<br>
free portions lying on the side opposed to the first free<br>
portions with respective the fixed portions therebetween and<br>
extending outward from the respective fixed portions in the<br>
transverse direction and the one of the hooks and adhesive are<br>
formed on respective inner surfaces of the second free portions.<br>
[0011]<br>
According to still another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the engagement members respectively have a length<br>
dimension measured in the longitudinal direction approximately<br>
same as the corresponding dimension of the side edge portions<br>
of the waist region.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to further another preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the side edge portions of the front and rear waist<br>
regions are stretchable at least in the transverse direction<br>
of the longitudinal and transverse directions.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013]<br>
In the disposable wearing article according to the<br>
present invention, even when a force tending to disconnect the<br>
side edge portions of the front and rear waist regions from one<br>
another is exerted on these side edge portions of the article<br>
put on the wearer's body with the engagement members engaged<br>
with the inner surface of the front or rear waist region, such<br>
pulling force functions as the shearing force exerted on the<br>
side edge portions of the waist region and the engagement<br>
members. Therefore, the free portions of the engagement<br>
members are not easily disengaged from the inner surface of the<br>
waist region and it is not apprehended that the front and rear<br>
waist regions might be unintentionally disconnected from each<br>
other during use of the article. Regardless of the particular<br>
wearer's waist size, the article can be appropriately tightened<br>
around the wearer's waist and such adjustment makes it possible<br>
to prevent the article from slipping down during use of the<br>
article because this article allows a fitness of the article<br>
around the wearer's waist to be adjusted. The used article can<br>
be maintained in its folded state by the engagement members for<br>
disposal.<br>
[0014]<br>
In the case of the article wherein the fixed portions of<br>
the engagement members also are provided on the respective inner<br>
surfaces with the hooks, even if the force exerted on the side<br>
edge portions of the front and rear waist regions tends to<br>
separate these side edge portions from one another, such force<br>
functions as a shearing force exerted on the side edge portions<br>
of the waist region and the engagement members whether the<br>
article 1B is put on the wearer's body by engaging the fixed<br>
portions as well as the free portions of the engagement member<br>
with the inner surface of the waist region or by the fixed<br>
portions as well as the free portions of the engagement members<br>
with the outer surface of the waist region. Thus the fixed<br>
portions as well as the free portions of the engagement members<br>
are not easily peeled off from the inner or outer surface of<br>
the waist region and there is no anxiety that the front and rear<br>
waist regions might be unintentionally disconnected from each<br>
other during use of the article.<br>
[0015]<br>
In the case of the diaper wherein the engagement members<br>
have, in addition to the fixed portions and the first free<br>
portions, the second free portions of which the respective inner<br>
surfaces formed with the hooks, these second free portions are<br>
engaged with the inner or outer surface of the waist region so<br>
as to enhance engagement between the waist region and the<br>
engagement members. In this article, the second free portions<br>
of the engagement members are engaged with the outer surfaces<br>
of the respective side edge portions of the waist region by means<br>
of the hooks so that, even if any peeling force is exerted on<br>
the fixed portions, such peeling force is restricted by the<br>
second free portions and it is not apprehended that the peeling<br>
force might be significantly exerted on the fixed portions.<br>
[0016]<br>
In the article wherein the length dimension of the<br>
engagement member measured in the longitudinal direction is<br>
approximately same as the corresponding dimension of the side<br>
edge of the waist region, the side edge portions of the one waist<br>
region can be engaged with the side edge portions of the other<br>
waist region substantially over the full length dimension of<br>
these side edge portions. In this way, the front and rear waist<br>
regions can be reliably connected with each other.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE FOR WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0019]<br>
Details of a disposable wearing article according to the<br>
present invention will be more fully understood from the<br>
description given hereunder with reference to the accompanying<br>
drawings.<br>
[0020]<br>
Fig. 1 is a perspective view showing a disposable wearing<br>
article 1A according to a typical embodiment of the invention<br>
as partially broken away, Fig. 2 is a sectional view taken along<br>
a line II-II in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a sectional view taken along<br>
a line III-III in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a sectional view taken<br>
along a line IV-IV in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, a transverse direction<br>
is indicated by an arrow K, a longitudinal direction is<br>
indicated by an arrow L and a thickness direction is indicated<br>
by an arrow M. As used herein, "inner surfaces" of an outer<br>
sheet 2, engagement members 11 and top- and backsheets 21, 22<br>
refer to the surfaces thereof facing the wearer's skin and<br>
"outer surfaces" thereof refer to the surfaces thereof facing<br>
away from the wearer's skin.<br>
[0021]<br>
The article 1A comprises a liquid-impervious outer sheet<br>
2 defining an outer shape of the article lA and a laminated panel<br>
3 attached to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2. The<br>
article lA defines, in a longitudinal direction, a front waist<br>
region 4, a rear waist region 6, a crotch region 5 extending<br>
between these waist regions 4, 6, longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions 7 extending across the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6 in a transverse direction, and transversely opposite side<br>
edge portions 8, 9, 10 extending in the front waist region 4,<br>
the crotch region 5 and the rear waist region 6 in a longitudinal<br>
direction. The side edge portions 8 of the front waist region<br>
4 have a substantially same length dimension as a length<br>
dimension of the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region<br>
6. Engagement members 11 are attached to the side edge portions<br>
10 of the rear waist region 6.<br>
[0022]<br>
The outer sheet 2 defines the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6, the crotch region 5, the longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions and the transversely opposite side edge portions 8,<br>
9, 10. The outer sheet 2 is formed by composite nonwoven fabric<br>
consisting of a pair of non-stretchable hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 12, 13 placed upon and bonded to each<br>
other. Mutually opposed surfaces of these nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 12, 13 are intermittently bonded to each other by means<br>
of adhesive (not shown) . The outer sheet 2 curves inward along<br>
the side edge portions extending in the crotch region 5 so as<br>
to describe circular arcs which are convex in the transverse<br>
direction of the article lA. Thus, the outer sheet 2 presents<br>
a substantially hourglass-like planar shape. A plurality of<br>
first and second waist-surrounding elastic members 14, 15 and<br>
a plurality of leg-surrounding elastic members 16 are<br>
contractibly attached to the outer sheet 2 so that the outer<br>
sheet 2 may be formed with a plurality of gathers as these elastic<br>
members 14, 15, 16 contract.<br>
[0023]<br>
The first waist-surrounding elastic members 14 extend<br>
along the longitudinally opposite end portions 7 in the<br>
transverse direction. The first waist-surrounding elastic<br>
members 14 comprise a plurality of elastic strands arranged<br>
substantially at regular intervals in the longitudinal<br>
direction. The second waist-surrounding members 15 are laid<br>
between the first waist-surrounding elastic members 14 and the<br>
leg-surrounding elastic members 16 and extend across the front<br>
and rear waist regions 4, 6 in the transverse direction. The<br>
second waist-surrounding elastic members 15 comprise a<br>
plurality of elastic strands arranged substantially at regular<br>
intervals in the longitudinal direction. The leg-surrounding<br>
elastic members 16 comprise a plurality of elastic strands<br>
extending along the side edges 8, 9, 10 in the longitudinal<br>
direction from the crotch region 5 toward the front and rear<br>
waist regions 4, 6. These elastic members 14, 15, 16 are<br>
interposed between the nonwoven fabric layers 12, 13<br>
constituting the outer sheet 2 and intermittently bonded to the<br>
mutual opposed surfaces of these nonwoven fabric layers 12, 13.<br>
Specifically, these elastic members 14, 15, 16 are bonded to<br>
these nonwoven fabric layers 15, 16 while these elastic members<br>
14, 15, 16 are stretched at a predetermined ratio. The presence<br>
of these first and second waist-surrounding elastic members 14,<br>
15 makes the respective side edge portions 8, 10 of the front<br>
and rear waist regions 4, 6 elastically stretchable in the<br>
transverse direction.<br>
[0024]<br>
The engagement members 11 are laid on the inner surface<br>
of the rear waist region 6 along the side edge portions 10 thereof<br>
and . extend in the longitudinal direction. Each of the<br>
engagement members 11 is provided in a rectangular shape which<br>
is relatively long in the longitudinal direction and its length<br>
dimension S2 measured in the longitudinal direction is<br>
substantially same as a length dimension S1 of the side edge<br>
portion 10 measured in the longitudinal direction (See Fig. 4) .<br>
The engagement member 11 has a fixed portion 18 permanently<br>
bonded to the side edge portion 10 in the vicinity of its<br>
outermost edge 17 and extending in the longitudinal direction<br>
and a free portion 19 extending in parallel to and inward from<br>
the fixed portion 18 in the transverse direction of the rear<br>
waist region 6.<br>
[0025]<br>
The fixed portion 18 has its outer surface permanently<br>
bonded to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e., the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 12) . Of the fixed portion 18, an upper<br>
zone 18a is placed upon transversely opposite end portions 14a<br>
of the first waist-surrounding elastic members 14 on the<br>
associated side, an intermediate zone 18b is placed upon<br>
transversely opposite end portions 15a of the second<br>
waist-surrounding elastic members 15 on the associated side and<br>
a lower zone 18c is placed upon longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions 16a of the leg-surrounding elastic members 16 on the<br>
associated side (See Fig. 4) . The free portion 19 is not<br>
permanently bonded to the outer sheet 2. The free portion 19<br>
is provided on its whole inner surface with a plurality of hooks<br>
20 constituting the known mechanical fastener. These hooks 20<br>
extend from the inner surface of the free portion 19 in the<br>
thickness direction of the article 1A. It should be noted here<br>
that these hooks 20 may be replaced by adhesive of the adhesive<br>
fastener known in the art.<br>
[0026]<br>
A length dimension S4 of the fixed portion 18 measured<br>
in the transverse direction is approximately a half of a full<br>
length dimension S3 of the engagement member 11 measured in the<br>
transverse direction and a length dimension S5 of the free<br>
portion 19 measured in the transverse direction is<br>
approximately a half of the full length dimension S3 (See Fig.<br>
2). The outermost edge 18d of the fixed portion 18 is placed<br>
aside inward from the outermost edge 17 of the side edge portion<br>
10 in order to avoid an anxiety that the outermost edge 18d of<br>
the fixed portion 18 might contact the wearer's skin and thereby<br>
uncomfortably irritate the wearer's skin.<br>
[0027]<br>
The panel 3 comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet 21<br>
facing the wearer's skin, a liquid-impervious backsheet 22<br>
facing away from the wearer's skin and a liquid-absorbent core<br>
23 interposed between these top- and backsheets 21, 22. The<br>
panel 3 serves to absorb and to retain body waste discharged<br>
by the wearer of the article 1A. The panel 3 has a substantially<br>
rectangular planar shape and extends between the front and rear<br>
waist regions 4, 6. The panel 3 has longitudinally opposite<br>
ends 24 extending in the transverse direction and transversely<br>
opposite side edges 25 extending in the longitudinal direction<br>
between the front and rear waist regions 4,6. In the panel<br>
3, the outer surface of the backsheet 22 is permanently bonded<br>
to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e., the nonwoven<br>
fabric layer 12) in intermittent or continuous manner. The<br>
transversely opposite side edges 25 of the panel 3 are<br>
respectively provided with a pair of liquid-resistant<br>
leak-barrier sheets 2 6 extending in the longitudinal direction<br>
between the front and rear waist regions 4, 6.<br>
[0028]<br>
The topsheet 21 is formed by hydrophilic fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric 27 and the backsheet 22 is formed by hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric 28. The core 23 is permanently bonded to at<br>
least one of the top- and backsheets 21, 22. The core 23<br>
comprises a mixture of particulate or fibrous super-absorbent<br>
polymer and fluff pulp or a mixture of particulate or fibrous<br>
super-absorbent polymer, fluff pulp and thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin fiber, in any case, compressed to a given<br>
thickness. Preferably, the core 23 is entirely wrapped with<br>
liquid-pervious sheet such as tissue paper or hydrophilic<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric in order to prevent the core 23 from<br>
getting out of its initial shape and/or to prevent polymer from<br>
falling off. The polymer may be starch-based polymer,<br>
cellulose-based polymer or synthetic polymer.<br>
[0029]<br>
The longitudinally opposite end portions 24 are formed<br>
by longitudinally opposite end portions 21a, 22a of the top-<br>
and backsheets 21, 22, respectively, extending outward in the<br>
longitudinal direction beyond the longitudinally opposite ends<br>
23a of the core 23. In these end portions 24, the end portions<br>
21a, 22a of the top- and backsheets 21, 22 are put flat and<br>
permanently bonded together. The transversely opposite side<br>
edge portions 25 are formed by transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions 21b, 22b of the top- and backsheets 21, 22,<br>
respectively, extending outward in the transverse direction<br>
beyond the transversely opposite side edges 23b of the core 23.<br>
In these side edge portions 25, the side edge portions 21b, 22b<br>
of the top- and backsheets 21, 22 are put flat and permanently<br>
bonded together.<br>
[0030]<br>
The leak-barrier sheets 26 are formed by hydrophobic<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric 29. Each of these leak-barrier sheets<br>
26 has a fixed lateral portion 26a extending in parallel to the<br>
associated side edge 25 of the panel 3 in the longitudinal<br>
direction, a movable portion 26b extending in parallel to the<br>
fixed lateral portion 26a in the longitudinal direction, and<br>
longitudinally opposite fixed end portions 2 6c of the movable<br>
portion 26b. The fixed lateral portion 26a is interposed<br>
between the outer sheet 2 and the backsheet 22 and permanently<br>
bonded to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e., the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 12) and the outer surface of the backsheet<br>
22. A stretchable elastic member 30 extending in the<br>
longitudinal direction is contractibly attached to the movable<br>
portion 26b in the vicinity of its upper edge. The elastic<br>
member 30 is strand-like and permanently bonded to the movable<br>
portion 26b so that the elastic member 30 may be wrapped with<br>
a part of the movable portion 26b. The longitudinally opposite<br>
fixed end portions 2 6c lying on the respective end portions 25<br>
of the panel 3 are collapsed inward as viewed in the transverse<br>
direction and permanently bonded in such state to the outer<br>
surface of the topsheet 21. The elastic member 30 contracts<br>
as the article 1A curves in the longitudinal direction with the<br>
panel 3 inside. In response to this, the movable portion 26b<br>
of the leak-barrier sheet 26 rises above the topsheet 21 and<br>
forms a barrier against body waste.<br>

Fig. 5 is a perspective view showing the article lA of<br>
Fig. 1 as put on the wearer's body in one manner of wearing,<br>
Fig. 6 is a sectional view taken along a line VI-VI in Fig. 5,<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view showing the article lA of Fig. 1<br>
as put on the wearer's body in another manner of wearing and<br>
Fig. 8 is a sectional view taken along a line VIII-VIII in Fig.<br>
7. In Figs. 5 and 7, a waist-surrounding direction is indicated<br>
by an arrow N.<br>
[0032]<br>
A first sequence followed by parent or care personnel to<br>
put the article lA on the wearer's body comprises steps of<br>
placing the inner surface of the rear waist region 6 upon the<br>
inner surface of the front waist region 4 along the side edge<br>
portions 10, 8 thereof and pressing the engagement members 11<br>
against the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4.<br>
By pressing the engagement members 11 against the inner surface<br>
of the side edge portions 8, the hooks 20 are caught by individual<br>
fibers of the nonwoven fabric layer 12 constituting the outer<br>
sheet 2 and thereby the free portions 19 of the engagement<br>
members 11 are engaged with the inner surface of the side edge<br>
portions 8 of the front waist region 4. In this way, the front<br>
and rear waist regions 4,6 are connected with each other along<br>
the side edge portions 8, 10 thereof (See Fig. 5) whereupon the<br>
article 1A is formed with a waist-hole 31 and a pair of leg-holes<br>
32. After the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 have been<br>
connected with each other, parent or care personnel guides the<br>
wearer's legs through the waist-hole 31, then through the<br>
leg-holes 32 and draws the article lA upward along the wearer's<br>
waist.<br>
[0033]<br>
Referring to Fig. 6, the side edge portions 8, 10 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are pulled in the waist<br>
surrounding direction indicated by an arrow N1 as the article<br>
1A is put on the wearer's body. Although such pulling force<br>
certainly tends to disconnect the side edge portions 8, 10 of<br>
the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 from each other, it<br>
functions not as a peeling force tending to disengage the<br>
engagement members from the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 but as a shearing force indicated by an arrow<br>
N2. The hooks 20 are not easily disengaged from the inner<br>
surface of the outer sheet 2 merely by such shearing force. In<br>
this way, it is not apprehended that the front and rear waist<br>
regions 4, 6 might be unintentionally disconnected from each<br>
other during use of the article 1A.<br>
[0034]<br>
A second sequence followed by parent or care personnel<br>
to put the article lA on the wearer's body is distinguished from<br>
the first sequence as has been described above in that the second<br>
sequence includes additional steps for adjustment. If it has<br>
been found that a fitness of the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6 around the wearer's waist is insufficient after the article<br>
lA was put on the wearer's body in accordance with the first<br>
sequence in the state as shown by Fig. 5, the engagement members<br>
11 are disengaged from the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 and thereby the front waist region 4 is<br>
disconnected from the rear waist region 6. Now the inner<br>
surfaces of the respective side edge portions 10 of the rear<br>
waist region 6 are placed again on the outer surfaces of the<br>
respective side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4 at<br>
new positions appropriate for adjustment and the engagement<br>
members 11 are pressed against the outer surface of the front<br>
waist region 4. By pressing the engagement members 11 against<br>
the outer surface of the front waist region 4, the hooks 20 are<br>
caught by individual fibers of the nonwoven fabric layer 13<br>
constituting the outer sheet 2 and thereby the free portions<br>
19 of the engagement members 11 are engaged with the outer<br>
surface of the front waist region 4. In this way, the side edge<br>
portions 8 of the front waist region 4 are connected with the<br>
side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region 6 at the positions<br>
desired for fitness adjustment (See Fig. 7). In this way,<br>
parent or care personnel may connect the side edge portions 10<br>
of the rear waist region 6 with the side edge portions 8 of the<br>
front waist region 4 at the desired positions to ensure that<br>
a dimension of the article 1A in the waist surrounding direction<br>
is adjusted in conformity with the individual wearer's waist<br>
size.<br>
[0035]<br>
Thus the article lA allows the fitness of the front and<br>
rear waist regions 4, 6 around the wearer's waist to be adjusted<br>
by releasing the engagement between the side edge portions 8<br>
of the front waist region 4 and the engagement members 11 from<br>
the state of the article 1A having been once put on the wearer's<br>
body as shown by Fig. 5 and engaging again the engagement members<br>
11 with the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4<br>
at desired positions on the respective side edge portions 8.<br>
Regardless of the particular wearer's waist size, the article<br>
lA can be appropriately tightened around the wearer's waist and<br>
such adjustment makes it possible to prevent the article 1A from<br>
slipping down during use of the article 1A.<br>
[0036]<br>
Of the fixed portion 18 in each of the engagement members<br>
11, the upper zone 18a and the intermediate zone 18b<br>
respectively lie on the associated ones of the transversely<br>
opposite end portions 14a, 15a of the first and second<br>
waist-surrounding elastic members 14, 15 and the lower zone 18c<br>
lies on the associated upper end portions 16a of the<br>
leg-surrounding elastic members 16 on the associated side.<br>
Such arrangement ensures that the elastic members 14, 15 are<br>
stretched in the transverse direction in operative association<br>
with the engagement members 11 and the elastic members 16 are<br>
stretched in the longitudinal direction also in operative<br>
association with the engagement members 11 as the engagement<br>
members 11 are adjustably engaged with the side edge portions<br>
8 of the front waist region 4 at the desired positions. In this<br>
way, these elastic members 14, 15, 16 can be effectively<br>
utilized to tighten the article lA around the wearer's waist<br>
and legs and thereby to maintain the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6 in close contact with the wearer's skin.<br>
[0037]<br>
In the article lA, the length dimension S2 of the<br>
engagement member 11 measured in the longitudinal direction is<br>
substantially same as the length dimension S1 of the side edge<br>
portion 10 of the rear waist region 6. Such dimensioning allows<br>
each of the side edge portions 10 to be engaged over a<br>
substantially full range of the length dimension S1 with the<br>
front waist region 4. Compared to the case in which the side<br>
edge portions 10 of the rear waist region 6 are partially<br>
connected to the front waist region 4, the article 1A allows<br>
the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 to be reliably connected<br>
with each other.<br>
[0038]<br>
Fig. 9 is a perspective view showing the article lA folded<br>
for disposal. The used article lA may be prepared for disposal,<br>
for example, in a manner as will be described hereunder. After<br>
the engagement members 11 have been disengaged from the front<br>
waist region 4 and the article lA has been left off from the<br>
wearer's body, parent or care personnel may fold the crotch<br>
region 5 onto the outer surface of the front waist region 4,<br>
then draw the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region<br>
toward a transversely intermediate zone of the crotch region<br>
5 and press the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region<br>
6 against the outer surface of the crotch region 5 at desired<br>
positions. By pressing the side edge portions 10 against the<br>
crotch region 5, the hooks 20 are caught by the individual fibers<br>
of the nonwoven fabric layer 13 constituting the outer sheet<br>
2 and thereby the free portions 19 of the respective engagement<br>
members 11 are engaged with the outer surface of the crotch<br>
region 5. The used article 1A is maintained in its folded state<br>
by the engagement members 11 and therefore ready for disposal.<br>
More specifically, the waist-hole 31 as well as the leg-holes<br>
32 of the used article 1A are maintained in closed state and<br>
therefore it is not apprehended that body waste or odor thereof<br>
might leak out from the article lA through the waist-hole 31<br>
and/or the leg-holes 32.<br>
[0039]<br>
Fig. 10 is a perspective view showing a wearing article<br>
1B according to another embodiment according to the invention<br>
as partially broken away, Fig. 11 is a sectional view taken along<br>
a line XI-XI in Fig. 10, Fig. 12 is a sectional view taken along<br>
a line XII-XII in Fig. 10 and Fig. 13 is a sectional view taken<br>
along a line XIII-XIII in Fig. 10. In Fig. 10, a transverse<br>
direction is indicated by an arrow K, a longitudinal direction<br>
is indicated by an arrow L and a thickness direction is indicated<br>
by an arrow M.<br>
[0040]<br>
The article 1B comprises a liquid-impervious outer sheet<br>
2 and a laminated panel 3 attached to the inner surface of the<br>
outer sheet 2. The article 1B defines, in a longitudinal<br>
direction, a front waist region 4, a rear waist region 6, a crotch<br>
region 5 extending between these waist regions 4, 6,<br>
longitudinally opposite end portions 7 extending in a<br>
transverse direction, and transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions 8, 9, 10 extending in a longitudinal direction. The<br>
side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4 have a<br>
substantially same length dimension as a length dimension of<br>
the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region 6. Engagement<br>
members 11 are attached to the side edge portions 10 of the rear<br>
waist region 6.<br>
[0041]<br>
The outer sheet 2 defines the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6, the crotch region 5, the longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions and the transversely opposite side edge portions 8,<br>
9, 10. The outer sheet 2 is formed by composite nonwoven fabric<br>
consisting of a pair of non-stretchable hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 12, 13 placed upon and bonded to each<br>
other. Mutually opposed surfaces of these nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 12, 13 are intermittently bonded to each other by means<br>
of adhesive (not shown). The outer sheet 2 curves inward along<br>
the side edge portions extending in the crotch region 5 so as<br>
to describe circular arcs which are convex in the transverse<br>
direction of the article 1B. Thus, the outer sheet 2 presents<br>
a substantially hourglass-like planar shape.<br>
Waist-surrounding elastic members 35 and a plurality of<br>
leg-surrounding elastic members 16 are contractibly attached<br>
to the outer sheet 2.<br>
[0042]<br>
The waist-surrounding elastic members 35 are belt-like<br>
members and extend along the longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions 7 in the transverse direction. The leg-surrounding<br>
elastic members 16 comprise a plurality of elastic strands<br>
extending along the side edges 8, 9, 10 in the longitudinal<br>
direction these elastic members 16, 35 are interposed between<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 33, 34 constituting the outer sheet<br>
2 and intermittently bonded to the mutual opposed surfaces of<br>
these nonwoven fabric layers 33, 34. Specifically, these<br>
elastic members 33, 34 are bonded to these nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 16, 35 while these elastic members 16, 35 are stretched<br>
at a predetermined ratio. The respective side edge portions<br>
8, 10 of the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are elastically<br>
stretchable at least in the transverse direction of the<br>
longitudinal and transverse directions because the elastic<br>
members make the outer sheet 2 elastically stretchable.<br>
[0043]<br>
The engagement members 11 are laid on the inner surface<br>
of the rear waist region 6 along the side edge portions 10 thereof<br>
and extend in the longitudinal direction. Each of the<br>
engagement members 11 is provided in a rectangular shape which<br>
is relatively long in the longitudinal direction and its length<br>
dimension S2 measured in the longitudinal direction is<br>
substantially same as a length dimension S1 of the side edge<br>
portion 10 measured in the longitudinal direction (See Fig. 13) .<br>
The engagement member 11 has a fixed portion 18 permanently<br>
bonded to the side edge portion 10 in the vicinity of its<br>
outermost edge 17 and extending in the longitudinal direction<br>
and a free portion 19 extending in parallel to and inward from<br>
the fixed portion 18 in the transverse direction of the rear<br>
waist region 6.<br>
[0044]<br>
The fixed portion 18 has its outer surface permanently<br>
bonded to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e., the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 33). The free portion 19 is not<br>
permanently bonded to the outer sheet 2 and free from the outer<br>
sheet 2. The fixed portion 18 and the free portion 19 are<br>
provided on their whole inner surfaces with a plurality of hooks<br>
20 constituting the mechanical fastener. These hooks 20 extend<br>
from the inner surfaces of these portions 18, 19 in the thickness<br>
direction of the article 1B. It should be noted here that these<br>
hooks may be replaced by adhesive of adhesive fastener known<br>
in the art.<br>
[0045]<br>
In the engagement member 11, a length dimension S4 of the<br>
fixed portion 18 measured in the transverse direction is<br>
approximately a half of a full length dimension S3 of the<br>
engagement member 11 measured in the transverse direction and<br>
a length dimension S5 of the free portion 19 measured in the<br>
transverse direction is approximately a half of the full length<br>
dimension S3 (See Fig. 11). The outermost edge 18d of the fixed<br>
portion 18 is placed aside inward from the outermost edge 17<br>
of the side edge portion 10.<br>
[0046]<br>
The panel 3 comprises a liquid-pervious topsheet 21<br>
facing the wearer's skin, a liquid-impervious backsheet 22<br>
facing away from the wearer's skin and a liquid-absorbent core<br>
23 interposed between these top- and backsheets 21, 22. The<br>
panel 3 serves to absorb and to retain body waste discharged<br>
by the wearer of the article 1B. The panel 3 has a substantially<br>
rectangular planar shape and extends between the front and rear<br>
waist regions 4, 6. The panel 3 has longitudinally opposite<br>
ends 24 extending in the transverse direction and transversely<br>
opposite side edges 25 extending in the longitudinal direction.<br>
In the panel 3, the outer surface of the backsheet 22 is<br>
permanently bonded to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2<br>
(i.e., the nonwoven fabric layer 33) in intermittent or<br>
continuous manner. The transversely opposite side edges 25 of<br>
the panel 3 are respectively provided with a pair of<br>
liquid-resistant leak-barrier sheets 26 extending in the<br>
longitudinal direction. The core 23 is similar to that in the<br>
embodiment shown by Fig. 1.<br>
[0047]<br>
The longitudinally opposite end portions 24 are formed<br>
by longitudinally opposite end portions 21a, 22a of the top-<br>
and backsheets 21, 22, respectively, extending outward in the<br>
longitudinal direction beyond the longitudinally opposite ends<br>
23a of the core 23. In these end portions 24, the end portions<br>
21a, 22a of the top- and backsheets 21, 22 are put flat and<br>
permanently bonded together. The transversely opposite side<br>
edge portions 25 are formed by transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions 21b, 22b of the top- and backsheets 21, 22,<br>
respectively, extending outward in the transverse direction<br>
beyond the transversely opposite side edges 23b of the core 23.<br>
In these side edge portions 25, the side edge portions 21b, 22b<br>
of the top- and backsheets 21, 22 are put flat and permanently<br>
bonded together.<br>
[0048]<br>
The leak-barrier sheets 2 6 are formed by hydrophobic<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric 2 9 similar to that in the embodiment<br>
shown by Fig. 1. Each of these leak-barrier sheets 26 has a<br>
fixed lateral portion 26a extending in parallel to the<br>
associated side edge 25 of the panel 3 in the longitudinal<br>
direction, a movable portion 26b extending in parallel to the<br>
fixed lateral portion 2 6a in the longitudinal direction, and<br>
longitudinally opposite fixed end portions 26c of the movable<br>
portion 26b. The fixed lateral portion 26a is interposed<br>
between the outer sheet 2 and the backsheet 22 and permanently<br>
bonded to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e., the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 33) and the outer surface of the backsheet<br>
22. A stretchable elastic member 30 extending in the<br>
longitudinal direction is contractibly attached to the movable<br>
portion 26b in the vicinity of its upper edge. The movable<br>
portion 26b rises above the topsheet 21 and forms a barrier<br>
against body waste as the elastic member 30 contracts. The<br>
longitudinally opposite fixed end portions 2 6c lying on the<br>
respective end portions 25 of the panel 3 are collapsed inward<br>
as viewed in the transverse direction of the article 1B and<br>
permanently bonded in such state to the outer surface of the<br>
topsheet 21.<br>
[0049]<br>
Fig. 14 is a perspective view showing the article 1B of<br>
Fig 10 as put on the wearer's body in one manner of wearing,<br>
Fig. 15 is a sectional view taken along a line XV-XV in Fig.<br>
14, Fig. 16 is a perspective view showing the article 1B of Fig.<br>
10 as put on the wearer's body in another manner of wearing and<br>
Fig. 17 is a sectional view taken along a line XVII-XVII in Fig.<br>
16. In Figs. 14 and 16, a waist-surrounding direction is<br>
indicated by an arrow N. A seguence for disposal of this article<br>
1B is same as the case of Fig. 1 and therefore its repeated<br>
description is eliminated here.<br>
[0050]<br>
A first sequence followed by parent or care personnel to<br>
put the article 1B on the wearer's body comprises steps of<br>
placing the inner surface of the rear waist region 6 upon the<br>
inner surface of the front waist region 4 along the side edge<br>
portions 10, 8 thereof and pressing the engagement members 11<br>
against the inner surfaces of the respective side edge portions<br>
8 of the front waist region 4. By pressing the engagement<br>
members 11 against the inner surfaces of the side edge portions<br>
8, the hooks 20 are caught by individual fibers of the nonwoven<br>
fabric layer 33 constituting the outer sheet 2 and thereby the<br>
fixed portion 18 and the free portions 19 of the engagement<br>
members 11 are engaged with the inner surfaces of the respective<br>
side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4. In this way,<br>
the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are connected with each<br>
other along the side edge portions 8, 10 thereof (See Fig. 14)<br>
whereupon the article 1B is formed with a waist-hole 31 and a<br>
pair of leg-holes 32. After the front and. rear waist regions<br>
4, 6 have been connected with each other, parent or care<br>
personnel guides the wearer's legs through the waist-hole 31,<br>
then through the leg-holes 32 and draws the article 1B upward<br>
along the wearer's waist.<br>
[0051]<br>
Referring to Fig. 15, the side edge portions 8, 10 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are pulled in the waist<br>
surrounding direction indicated by an arrow N1 as the article<br>
1A is put on the wearer's body. Although such pulling force<br>
certainly tends to disconnect the side edge portions 8, 10 of<br>
the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 from each other, it<br>
functions not as a peeling force tending to disengage the<br>
engagement members from the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 but as a shearing force indicated by an arrow<br>
N2 exerted on the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region<br>
4 and the engagement members 11. The hooks 20 are not easily<br>
disengaged from the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e.,<br>
the nonwoven fabric 33) merely by such shearing force. In this<br>
way, it is not apprehended that the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6 might be unintentionally disconnected from each other<br>
during use of the article 1B.<br>
[0052]<br>
In the article 1B put on the wearer's body in the manner<br>
as illustrated by Fig. 15, a significant shearing force is<br>
exerted primarily upon the free portions 19 of the respective<br>
engagement members 11 as the side edge portions 8, 10 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are pulled in the waist<br>
surrounding direction indicated by the arrow N1. Such shearing<br>
force functions to enhance engagement between the hooks 20<br>
formed on the free portions 19 and the individual fibers of the<br>
nonwoven fabric 33. On the contrary, a shearing force exerted<br>
upon the fixed portions 18 is not so significant as the shearing<br>
force exerted upon the free portions 19 and engagement between<br>
the hooks 20 formed on the fixed portions 18 and the individual<br>
fibers of the nonwoven fabric 33 is correspondingly moderate.<br>
In other words, the engagement between the fixed portions 18<br>
of the respective engagement members 11 and the side edge<br>
portions 8 of the front waist region 4 can be easily released<br>
and thereby the side edge portions 8, 10 of the front and rear<br>
waist regions 4, 6 can be easily disconnected from one another.<br>
[0053]<br>
A second sequence followed by parent or care personnel<br>
to put the article 1B on the wearer's body is distinguished from<br>
the first sequence as has been described above in that the second<br>
sequence includes additional steps for adjustment. If it has<br>
been found that a fitness of the front and rear waist regions<br>
4, 6 around the wearer's waist is insufficient after the article<br>
1B was put on the wearer's body in accordance with the first<br>
sequence in the state as shown by Fig. 14, the engagement members<br>
11 are disengaged from the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 and thereby the front waist region 4 is<br>
disconnected from the rear waist region 6. Now the inner<br>
surfaces of the respective side edge portions 10 of the rear<br>
waist region 6 are placed again on the outer surfaces of the<br>
respective side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4 at<br>
new positions appropriate for adjustment and the engagement<br>
members 11 are pressed against the outer surface of the front<br>
waist region 4. By pressing the engagement members 11 against<br>
the outer surface of the front waist region 4, the hooks 20 are<br>
caught by individual fibers of the nonwoven fabric layer 34<br>
constituting the outer sheet 2 and thereby the fixed portions<br>
18 and the free portions 19 of the engagement members 11 are<br>
engaged with the outer surface of the front waist region 4 . In<br>
this way, the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region<br>
4 are connected with the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist<br>
region 6 at the positions desired for fitness adjustment (See<br>
Fig. 16). In this way, parent or care personnel may connect<br>
the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region 6 with the<br>
side edge portions 8 of the front waist region 4 at the desired<br>
positions to ensure that a dimension of the article 1B in the<br>
waist surrounding direction is adjusted in conformity with the<br>
individual wearer's waist size.<br>
[0054]<br>
Thus the article 1B allows the fitness of the front and<br>
rear waist regions 4, 6 around the wearer's waist to be adjusted<br>
by releasing the engagement between the side edge portions 8<br>
of the front waist region 4 and the engagement members 11 from<br>
the state of the article 1B having been once put on the wearer's<br>
body as shown by Fig. 14 and engaging again the engagement<br>
members 11 with the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region<br>
4 at desired positions on the respective side edge portions 8.<br>
Regardless of the particular wearer's waist size, the article<br>
1B can be appropriately tightened around the wearer's waist and<br>
such adjustment makes it possible to prevent the article 1B from<br>
slipping down during use thereof.<br>
[0055]<br>
Referring to Fig. 17, the side edge portions 8, 10 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are pulled in the waist<br>
surrounding direction indicated by an arrow N1 as the article<br>
1B is put on the wearer's body. Although such pulling force<br>
certainly tends to disconnect the side edge portions 8, 10 of<br>
the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 from each other, it<br>
functions not as a peeling force tending to disengage the<br>
engagement members from the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 but as a shearing force indicated by an arrow<br>
N2 exerted on the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region<br>
4 and the fixed portions 18. This is for the reason that the<br>
fixed portions 18 of the engagement members 11 are held in<br>
engagement with the side edge portions 8 by means of the hooks<br>
20. The hooks 20 are not easily disengaged from the inner<br>
surface of the outer sheet 2 merely by such shearing force. In<br>
this way, it is not apprehended that the front and rear waist<br>
regions 4, 6 might be unintentionally disconnected from each<br>
other during use of the article 1B whether the article 1B is<br>
put on the wearer's body in the manner illustrated by Fig. 14<br>
or in the manner illustrated by Fig. 16.<br>
[0056]<br>
In the article 1B, the length dimension S2 of the<br>
engagement member 11 measured in the longitudinal direction is<br>
substantially same as the length dimension S1 of the side edge<br>
portion 10 of the rear waist region 6. Such dimensioning allows<br>
each of the side edge portions 10 to be engaged over a<br>
substantially full range of the length dimension S1 with the<br>
front waist region 4. The used article 1B may be folded in<br>
preparation for disposal by folding the crotch region 5 onto<br>
the outer surface of the front waist region 4 and engaging the<br>
fixed portions 18 and the free portions 19 of the engagement<br>
members 11 with the outer surface of the crotch region 5<br>
similarly to the case of the article 1A shown by Fig. 1. Thus<br>
the diaper 1B is maintained in such folded state by the<br>
engagement members 11 and ready for disposal.<br>
[0057]<br>
Fig. 18 is a perspective view showing an article 1C<br>
according to still another embodiment of the invention as<br>
partially broken away and Fig. 19 is a sectional view taken along<br>
a line XI-XI in Fig. 10. In Fig. 18, a transverse direction<br>
is indicated by an arrow K, a longitudinal direction is<br>
indicated by an arrow L and a thickness direction is indicated<br>
by an arrow M. While this article 1C is distinguished from the<br>
article 1B so far as the construction of the engagement members<br>
11 is concerned, the remaining construction is common to these<br>
articles 1B and 1C. Thus similar members in these two<br>
embodiments are designated by the similar reference numerals<br>
and detailed description of these similar members is eliminated<br>
here.<br>
[0058]<br>
The engagement members 11 are laid on the inner surface<br>
of the rear waist region 6 along the side edge portions 10 thereof<br>
and extend in the longitudinal direction. Each of the<br>
engagement members 11 is provided in a rectangular shape which<br>
is relatively long in the longitudinal direction and its length<br>
dimension measured in the longitudinal direction is<br>
substantially same as a length dimension of the side edge<br>
portion 10 measured in the longitudinal direction. The<br>
engagement member 11 has a fixed portion 18 permanently bonded<br>
to the side edge portion 10 inside its outermost edge 17 and<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction, a first free portion<br>
19 extending in parallel to and inward from the fixed portion<br>
18 in the transverse direction of the rear waist region 6 and<br>
a second free portion 36 extending in parallel to and outward<br>
from the fixed portion 18 in the transverse direction of the<br>
rear waist region 6.<br>
[0059]<br>
The fixed portion 18 has its outer surface permanently<br>
bonded to the inner surface of the outer sheet 2 (i.e., the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 33). The first and second free portions<br>
19, 36 are not permanently bonded to the outer sheet 2. The<br>
second free portion 36 lies on the side opposed to the first<br>
free portion 19 with the fixed portion 18 therebetween and<br>
extends outward slightly beyond the outermost edge 18 of the<br>
side edge portion 10. The fixed portion 18 and the free portion<br>
19 as well as the first and second free portions 19, 36 are<br>
provided on their whole inner surfaces with a plurality of hooks<br>
20 constituting the mechanical fastener. These hooks 20 extend<br>
from the inner surfaces of these portions 18, 19, 36 in the<br>
thickness direction of the article 1B. It should be noted here<br>
that the hooks 20 may be replaced by adhesive of the adhesive<br>
fastener known in the art. A length dimension S4 of the fixed<br>
portion 18 is approximately 1/3 of the full length dimension<br>
S3 of the engagement member 11 and length dimensions S5, S6 of<br>
the first and second free portions 19, 36, respectively,<br>
correspond to approximately 1/3 of the full length dimension<br>
S3 of the engagement member 11.<br>
[0060]<br>
Fig. 20 is a perspective view showing the article 1C of<br>
Fig. 18 as put on the wearer's body in one manner of wearing,<br>
Fig. 21 is a sectional view taken along a line XXI-XXI in Fig.<br>
20, Fig. 22 is a perspective view showing the article 1C of Fig.<br>
18 as put on the wearer's body in another manner of wearing and<br>
Fig. 23 is a sectional view taken along a line XXIII-XXIII in<br>
Fig 22. In Figs. 20 and 22, a waist-surrounding direction is<br>
indicated by an arrow L1. A sequence for wearing as well as<br>
disposal of this article 1C is same as those in the cases of<br>
Figs. 1 and 10 and a repeated description thereof is eliminated<br>
here.<br>
[0061]<br>
In the article 1C, the fixed portions 18 as well as the<br>
first and second free portions 19, 26 of the respective<br>
engagement members 11 are adapted to be engaged with the inner<br>
surfaces of the respective side edge portions of the front waist<br>
region 4 and thereby to connect the side edge portions 8, 10<br>
of the front and rear waist regions 4, 6, respectively, with<br>
one another (See Fig. 20). Referring to Fig. 21, the side edge<br>
portions 8, 10 of the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are pulled<br>
in the waist surrounding direction indicated by an arrow N1 as<br>
the article 1C is put on the wearer's body. Although such<br>
pulling force certainly tends to disconnect the side edge<br>
portions 8, 10 of the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 from<br>
each other, it rather functions as a shearing force indicated<br>
by an arrow N2 exerted on the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 and the engagement members 11. Therefore, the<br>
hooks 20 are not easily disengaged from the inner surface of<br>
the outer sheet 2 and it is not apprehended that the front and<br>
rear waist regions 4, 6 might be unintentionally disconnected<br>
from each other during use of the article 1C shown by Fog. 20.<br>
[0062]<br>
In the article 1C, the fixed portions 18 as well as the<br>
first and second free portions 19, 26 of the respective<br>
engagement members 11 are adapted to be engaged with the inner<br>
surfaces of the respective side edge portions of the front waist<br>
region 4 so that the outer surface of the side edge portions<br>
8 of the front waist region 4 may be engaged, at desired positions<br>
thereof, with the side edge portions 10 of the rear waist region<br>
6 (See Fig. 22). Even when the side edge portions 8, 10 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 4, 6 are pulled in the waist<br>
surrounding direction indicated by the arrow N1 and such pulling<br>
force tends to disconnect the side edge portions 8, 10 of the<br>
front and rear waist regions 4, 6 from one another, engagement<br>
of the fixed portions 18 and the second free portions 36 with<br>
the outer surface of the side edge portions 8 of the front waist<br>
region 4 prevents such pulling force from functioning as a<br>
peeling force exerted on these portions 18, 36, 8. Namely, such<br>
pulling force rather functions as a shearing force exerted on<br>
these portions 18, 36, 8 as indicated by the arrow N2 in Fig.<br>
23. The hooks 20 are not easily disengaged from the inner<br>
surface of the outer sheet 2 merely by such shearing force and<br>
it is not apprehended that the front and rear waist regions 4,<br>
6 might be unintentionally disconnected from each other during<br>
use of the article 1C. Even if a peeling force tends to affect<br>
the fixed portions 18, such peeling force is effectively<br>
restricted by engagement of the second free portions 36 of the<br>
respective engagement members 11 with the outer surface of the<br>
side edge portions 8 by means of the hooks 20.<br>
[0063]<br>
In the article 1C, the first and second free portions 19,<br>
36 of the engagement members 11 are engaged with the outer<br>
surface of the side edge portions 8 by means of the hooks so<br>
as to enhance engagement between the front waist region 4 and<br>
the engagement members 11. In this way, it is possible to<br>
maintain the engagement members 11 and the side edge portions<br>
8 in these free portions 19, 36 even if any peeling force is<br>
exerted on the fixed portions 18.<br>
[0064]<br>
The article 1C allows a fitness of the article 1C around<br>
the wearer's waist to be adjusted by engaging again the<br>
engagement members 11 with the side edge portions 8 of the front<br>
waist region 4 at desired positions on the side edge portions<br>
8. The article 1C further allows the side edge portions 10 of<br>
the rear waist region 6 to be engaged with the front waist region<br>
4 substantially over the full length dimension of the side edge<br>
portions 10 by means of the engagement members 11 and thereby<br>
allows the front and rear waist regions 4, 6 to be reliably<br>
connected with each other.<br>
[0065]<br>
The used article 1C may be folded in the same manner as<br>
in the case of the article 1A of Fig. 1 for disposal thereof.<br>
Specifically, the crotch region 5 may be folded onto the outer<br>
surface of the front waist region 4 and then the fixed portions<br>
18 and the first and second free portions 19, 36 may be engaged<br>
with the outer surface of the crotch region. The used article<br>
1C is maintained in such folded state and ready for disposal.<br>
[0066]<br>
Material for the topsheet 21 is not limited to the<br>
hydrophilic fibrous nonwoven fabric and it is possible to form<br>
the topsheet 21 by hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric having<br>
a plurality of apertures. It is possible to use breathable<br>
liquid-impervious plastic film as material for the backsheet<br>
22. The outer sheet 2, the backsheet 22 and the leak-barrier<br>
sheets 26 may be formed also by composite nonwoven fabric (SM<br>
nonwoven fabric or SMS nonwoven fabric) consisting of melt blown<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric having a high water-resistance and spun<br>
bond fibrous nonwoven fabric being high in strength as well as<br>
in flexibility laminated on at least one side of the melt blown<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric.<br>
[0067]<br>
Materials for the fibrous nonwoven fabric layers may be<br>
selected from a group consisting of spun lace-, needle punch-,<br>
melt blown-, thermal bond-, spun bond- and chemical<br>
bond-nonwoven fabric layers. Material for the hydrophilic<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric may be selected from a group consisting<br>
of synthetic fiber modified to be hydrophilic, semi-synthetic<br>
fiber, regenerated fiber and mixture thereof. The hydrophobic<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric may contain water-repellent finished<br>
semi-synthetic fiber or regenerated fiber. Although not<br>
specified, the synthetic fiber may be selected from a group<br>
consisting of polyester-, polyacrylonitril-, polyvinyl<br>
chloride-, polyethylene-, polypropylene- and<br>
polystyrene-based synthetic fibers. It is also possible to use<br>
the synthetic fiber selected from a group consisting of<br>
core-sheath conjugate fiber, side-by-side conjugate fiber,<br>
modified macaroni fiber, microporous fiber and fused type<br>
conjugate fiber.<br>
[0068]<br>
The stretchable fibrous nonwoven fabric layers 33, 34<br>
constituting the outer sheet 2 of Figs. 10 and 18 may be formed<br>
by melt blown nonwoven fabric or spun bond nonwoven fabric. It<br>
is possible to use, as component fiber of the stretchable<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 33, 34, stretchable fiber melt spun from<br>
thermoplastic elastomer resin. It is also possible to form the<br>
outer sheet 2 by composite nonwoven fabric consisting of<br>
stretchable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric made of<br>
thermoplastic elastomer resin fiber and hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric made of crimped fiber melt spun from<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin selected from a group consisting<br>
of polypropylene, polyethylene and polyester laminated on at<br>
least one surface of the aforementioned hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric.<br>
[0069]<br>
Permanently bonding of the sheets 2, 21, 22, 26 to one<br>
another, permanently bonding of the core 23 to the sheets 21,<br>
22 and permanently bonding of the elastic members 30 to the sheet<br>
26 may be achieved by use of adhesive. It is preferred to coat<br>
the outer sheet 2, the top- and backsheets 21, 22 and the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 26 with the adhesive in a pattern selected<br>
from a group consisting of spiral pattern, wave-pattern, zigzag<br>
pattern, dotted pattern and stripe-pattern. By coating the<br>
top- and backsheets 21, 22 and the leak-barrier sheets 26 with<br>
the adhesive in such pattern, these sheets 2, 21, 22, 26 can<br>
be intermittently and permanently bonded one to another, the<br>
core 23 can be intermittently and permanently bonded to the<br>
sheets 21, 22 and the elastic members 30 can be intermittently<br>
and permanently bonded to the sheet 26. The outer sheet 2 may<br>
be permanently bonded to the fixed portions 18 of the respective<br>
engagement members 11 by use of adhesive or welding technique<br>
such as sonic sealing or heat sealing. The adhesive may be<br>
selected from a group consisting of hot melt adhesive, acrylic<br>
adhesive and rubber adhesive.<br>
[0070]<br>
When the engagement members 11 are permanently bonded to<br>
the outer sheet 2 using adhesive, a content of finish surface<br>
active agent in the nonwoven fabric layers 12, 13, 33, 34<br>
constituting the outer sheet 2 is preferably 0.04 wt per total<br>
weight of these nonwoven fabric layers as measured by solvent<br>
extraction method (prescribed by JIS L 1015 7.22). If the<br>
content of the finish surface active agent exceeds 0.04 wt, the<br>
finish surface active agent will progressively deteriorate an<br>
adhesive force of the adhesive as the time elapses and an<br>
adhesive strength between the fixed portions 18 and the outer<br>
sheet 2 will be correspondingly deteriorated until the fixed<br>
portions 18 may be peeled off from the outer sheet 2. So far<br>
as the content of the finish surface active agent is less than<br>
0.04 wt, the adhesive is reliably protected against<br>
deterioration of its adhesive force and, even if the articles<br>
1A, 1B, 1C are stored for long period, the adhesive strength<br>
between the fixed portions 18 of the engagement members 11 and<br>
the outer sheet 2 is protected from deterioration. The finish<br>
surface active agent may be selected from a group consisting<br>
of anionic, nonionic, cationic, amphoteric surface active<br>
agents and mixtures thereof. Anionic or nonionic surface<br>
active agent may contain, if necessary to enhance adherence to<br>
the fiber, fatty wax, fatty acid, higher alcohol, mineral oil<br>
or hardened oil.<br>
[0071]<br>
While the articles 1A, 1B, 1C have been illustrated and<br>
described to have the engagement members 11 attached to the<br>
inner surface of the side edges 10 of the rear waist region 6,<br>
it is also possible to attach the engagement members to the inner<br>
surface of the side edge portions 8 of the front waist region<br>
4.<br>
