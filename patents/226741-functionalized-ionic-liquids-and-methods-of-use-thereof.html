				<td>FUNCTIONALIZED IONIC LIQUIDS, AND METHODS OF USE THEREOF<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Ionic Liquids<br>
Room temperature ionic liquids consist of ions. However, unlike conventional<br>
molten salts (for example, molten sodium chloride), these materials often melt below 100°<br>
C. Since the melting points are low, ionic liquids can act as solvents in which reactions can<br>
be performed, and because the liquid is made of ions rather than molecules, such reactions<br>
often provide distinct selectivities and reactivities as compared to conventional organic<br>
solvents.<br>
Room-temperature ionic liquids have been used as clean solvents and catalysts for<br>
green chemistry and as electrolytes for batteries, photochemistry and electrosynthesis.<br>
They have no significant vapor pressure and thus create no volatile organic contaminants.<br>
They also allow for easy separation of organic molecules by direct distillation without loss<br>
of the ionic liquid. Their liquid range can be as large as 300° C allowing for large reaction<br>
kinetic control, which, coupled with their good solvent properties, allows small reactor<br>
volumes to be used. Salts based upon poor nucleophilic anions, such as [BF4]-, [PF6]-,<br>
[CF3CO2]-, and [CF3SO3]-, are water and air insensitive and possess remarkably high<br>
thermal stability. Many of these materials are based around an imidazolium cation, 1-alkyl-<br>
3-methylimidazolium. By changing the anion or the alkyl chain on the cation, a wide<br>
variation in properties, such as hydrophobicity, viscosity, density and solvation, can be<br>
obtained. For example, ionic liquids will dissolve a wide range of organic molecules to an<br>
appreciable extent, the solubility being influenced by the nature of the counter anion.<br>
The unique physical properties of ionic liquids have been found to offer certain<br>
advantages in numerous applications. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,827,602 to Koch et al.<br>
discloses ionic liquids having improved properties for application in batteries,<br>
electrochemical capacitors, catalysis, chemical separations, and other uses. The ionic<br>
liquids described in Koch et al. are hydrophobic in nature, being poorly soluble in water,<br>
and contain only non-Lewis acid anions. When fluorinated, they were found to be<br>
particularly useful as hydraluic fluids and inert liquid diluents for highly reactive chemicals,<br>
In addition, ionic liquids have been discussed by Freemantle, M. Chem. Eng. News 1998,<br>
76 [March 30], 32; Carmichael, H. Chem. Britain, 2000, [January], 36; Seddon, K. R. J.<br>

W., Bowlas, C. J., Seddon, K. R. Chem. Coram. 1996, 1625; Merrigan, T. L., Bates, E. D.,<br><br>
Dorman, S. C, Davis, J. H. Chem. Comm. 2000, 2051; Freemantle, M. Chem. Eng. News,<br>
2000, 78 [May 15], 37. See also Holbrey, J. D.; Seddon, K. R. Clean Products and<br>
Processes 1999,1, 223-236; and Dupont, J., Consorti, C. S. Spencer, J. J Braz. Chem. Soc.<br>
2000,11,337-344.<br>
Ionic liquids have been disclosed for use as solvents for a broad spectrum of<br>
chemical processes. These ionic liquids, which in some cases can serve as both catalyst and<br>
solvent, are attracting increasing interest from industry because they promise significant<br>
environmental benefits, e.g., because they are nonvolatile they do not emit vapors. Hence,<br>
for example, they have been used in butene dimerization processes. WO 95/21871, WO<br>
95/21872 and WO 95/21806 relate to ionic liquids and their use to catalyse hydrocarbon<br>
conversion reactions such as polymerisation and alkylation reactions. The ionic liquids<br>
described for this process were preferably l-(C1 -C4 alkyl)-3-(C6 -C30 alkyl) imidazolium<br>
chlorides and especially l-methyl-3-C10 alkyl-imidazolium chloride, or 1-hydrocarbyl<br>
pyridinium halides, where the hydrocarbyl group is, for example, ethyl, butyl or other alkyl.<br>
PCT publication WO 01/25326 to Lamanna et al. discloses an antistatic composition<br>
comprising at least one ionic salt consisting of a nonpolymeric nitrogen onium cation and a<br>
weakly coordinating fluoroorganic anion, the conjugate acid of the anion being a superacid,<br>
in combination with thermoplastic polymer. The composition was found to exhibit good<br>
antistatic performance over a wide range of humidity levels.<br>
Bronsted Acid Catalysis<br>
From undergraduate laboratories to chemical manufacturing plants, the use of strong<br>
Bronsted acids is ubiquitous. Smith, M. B.; March, J. March's Advanced Organic<br>
Chemistry; Wiley-Interscience: New York, 2001; Chapter 8. In this context, solid acids are<br>
being more widely used since, as non-volatile materials, they are deemed less noxious than<br>
traditional liquid acids. Ritter, S. K. Chem. Eng. News, 2001, 79 (40), 63-67. However,<br>
solid acids have shortcomings. Among the more troublesome of these are restricted<br>
accessibility of the matrix-bound acidic sites, high mw/active site ratios, and rapid<br>
deactivation from coking. Ishihara, K.; Hasegama, A. and Yamamoto, H. Angew. Chem.<br>
Int. Ed., 2001, 40, 4077-4079; and Harmer, M. A. and Sun, Q. Appl. Catal. A: General,<br>
2001, 221, 45-62.<br>
Bearing in mind both the advantages and disadvantages of solid acids, the search<br>
continues for systems that are Bronsted acids with solid-like non-volatility but that manifest<br>
the motility, greater effective surface area and potential activity of a liquid phase.<br><br>
Combining just these characteristics, ionic liquids (IL) have been described as one of the<br>
most promising new jeaction mediums. Seddon, K. R. J. Chem. Technol. Biotechnol.<br>
1997, 68, 351-356. Not only can these unusual materials dissolve many organic and<br>
inorganic substrates, they are also readily recycled and are tunable to specific chemical<br>
tasks. Bates, E. D.; Mayton, R. D.; Ntai, I. and Davis, J. H. Jr. J. Am. Chem Soc. 2002,124,<br>
926-927; Visser, A. E.; Holbrey, J. D.; Rogers, R. D. Chem. Commun., 2001, 2484-2485;<br>

Further, the chemical industry is under significant pressure to replace the volatile<br>
organic compounds that are currently used as solvents in organic synthesis. Many of these<br>
solvents, such as chlorinated hydrocarbons, are toxic and hazardous for the environment,<br>
due to their emissions in the atmosphere and the contamination of aqueous effluents. Ionic<br>
liquids (EL) seem to offer a solution to this problem, too. Ionic liquids have no measurable<br>
vapor pressure. This means that they don't evaporate, and therefore they emit no hazardous<br>
vapors in the atmosphere, and replenishing of the solvent is not required. This property also<br>
allows easy separation of volatile products. ILs are able to dissolve a wide range of organic,<br>
inorganic and organometallic compounds. Notably, their properties can be adjusted by<br>
altering the cation or anion of the IL, allowing for fine tuning of the reaction.<br>
Moreover, many organic transformations, such as Fischer esterification, alcohol<br>
dehydrodimerization and the pinacol/benzopinacole rearrangement, require an acidic<br>
catalyst. Solid acids are now being used since, as nonvolatile compounds, they are less<br>
hazardous than traditional liquid acids. As noted above, although they are less hazardous,<br>
solid acids have several disadvantages, such as restricted accessibility of the matrix-bound<br>
acidic sites, high molecular weight/active-site ratios, and rapid deactivation from coking.<br>

Purification of Gas Mixtures<br>
There is little doubt that petroleum, coal and natural gas will continue to be the<br>
primary global fuel and chemical feedstock sources for some years to come. Mills, Mark P.<br>
Energy Policy in the Electron Age, Mills-McCarthy &amp; Associates, Inc.<br><br>
http://www.fossilfiiels.org/electric/electron.htm. Natural gas is regarded as the cleanest of<br>
these materials, and as such is being consumed at an accelerating pace. Despite its<br>
reputation as a clean fuel, natural gas is usually contaminated with a variety of undesirable<br>
materials, especially CO2 and H2S. While this level of contamination is very low in gas<br>
from certain sources (sweet gas), it is much higher in gas from others (sour gas). As sweet<br>
gas reserves are depleted, pressures will build for the increased utilization of sour gas. Oil<br>
and Gas R&amp;D Programs: Securing the U.S. Energy, Environmental and Economic Future.<br>
Office of Fossil Energy, U.S. Dept. of Energy, Office of Natural Gas and Petroleum<br>
Technology: Washington, DC, 1997. Since admixed CO2 lowers the fuel value of natural<br>
gas, the large amount of it present in sour gas compels its removal prior to combustion.<br>
The lower fuel value for sour gas, coupled with the connection between CO2 and global<br>
warming, makes CO2 capture a commercially important and environmentally desirable<br>
process.<br>
One of the most attractive approaches for the separation of a target compound from<br>
a mixture of gases in a gas stream is selective absorption into a liquid. Astarita, G,; Savage,<br>
D. W.; Bisio, A. Gas Treating with Chemical Solvents; Wiley-Interscience: New York,<br>
1983. Such interactions between gases and pure liquids or solutions are the bases for<br>
numerous gas separation technologies, including commercial systems for the removal of<br>
CO2 from natural gas. These scrubbing processes include ones in which the simple,<br>
differential dissolution of the target gas into the liquid phase is of principal importance.<br>
More common are processes in which a chemical reaction of the target gas with a solute in<br>
the liquid phase is the main mode of sequestration. With either mode of gas removal, the<br>
vapor pressure of the solvent itself plays a significant role in gas-liquid processes, usually<br>
to their detriment. In the case of large-scale CO2 capture, aqueous amines are used to<br>
chemically trap the CO2 by way of ammonium carbamate formation. In these systems, the<br>
uptake of water into the gas stream is particularly problematic. Compounding the water<br>
uptake difficulty is the loss into the gas stream of the volatile amine sequestering agent.<br>
A liquid that could facilitate the sequestration of gases without concurrent loss of<br>
the capture agent or solvent into the gas stream should prove to be a superior material in<br>
such applications. To this end, ionic liquids (low temperature molten salts) have been<br>
proposed as solvent-reagents for gas separations. Pez, G. P.; Carlin, R. T.; Laciak, D. V.;<br>
Sorensen, J. C. U. S. Patent 4,761,164. Due to the coulombic attraction between the ions of<br>
these liquids, they exhibit no measurable vapor pressure up to their thermal decomposition<br><br>
point, generally &gt; 300°C. This lack of vapor pressure makes these materials highly<br>
attractive for gas processing. Indeed, for-these purposes they may be thought of as "liquid<br>
solids," incorporating some of the most useful physical properties of both phases.<br>
Despite the general promise of ionic liquids (IL) in gas treatment, the molten salts<br>
used thus far for CO2 separation are generally "off the shelf materials, such as (CH3)4NF<br>
tetrahydrate, that are not optimized for this purpose, frequently depending upon another<br>
volatile reagent, water. Pez, G, P.; Carlin, R. T.; Laciak, D. V.; Sorensen, J. C. U. S. Patent<br>
4,761,164; Quinn, R.; Pez, G P. U. S. Patent 4,973,456; and Quinn, R.; Appleby, J. B.; Pez,<br>
G. P. J. Am. Chem. Soc, 1995,117, 329. For instance, the latter salt uses the very weakly<br>
basic bifluoride ion to drive the net generation of bicarbonate from CO2 and water.<br>
The prospects for preparing a broad array of ionic liquids with ions incorporating<br>
functional groups are good. Freemantle, M. Chemical &amp; Engineering News, May 15, 2000,<br>
37. Moreover, certain of these new "task-specific" ionic liquids have proven useful in both<br>
synthetic and separations applications. Visser, A. E.; Holbrey, J. D.; Rogers, R. D. Chem.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The invention will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying<br>
examples, in which certain preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This<br>
invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed<br>
as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so<br>
that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the<br>
invention to those skilled in the art.<br>
Overview of Two Preferred Embodiments<br>
The reaction of triphenylphosphine or N-butylimidazole with cyclic sultones gives<br>
zwitterions that are subsequently converted into ionic liquids by reaction with<br>
trifluoromethane sulfonic acid or p-toluene sulfonic acid. The resulting ionic liquids have<br>
cations to which are tethered alkane sulfonic acid groups. These Bronsted acidic ionic<br>
liquids are useful solvent/catalysts for several organic reactions, including Fischer<br>
esterification, alcohol dehydrodimerization and the pinacol rearrangement. The ionic<br>
liquids combine the low volatility and ease of separation from product normally associated<br><br>
with solid acid catalysts, with the higher activity and yields normally found using<br>
conventional liquid acids.<br><br>
Reaction of 1-butyl imidazole with 3-bromopropylamine hydrobromide, followed<br>
by work-up and anion exchange, yields a room-temperature ionic liquid incorporating a<br>
cation with an appended amine group. The ionic liquid reacts reversibly with CO2,<br>
reversibly sequestering the gas as a carbamate salt. The ionic liquid, which can be<br>
repeatedly recycled in this role, is comparable in efficiency for CO2 capture to commercial<br>
amine sequestering reagents, and yet is non-volatile and does not require water in order to<br>
function. <br>
Bronsted Acidic Ionic Liquids and Their Use as Dual Sovents-Catalysts<br>
Remarkably, we have developed the first ionic liquids that are strong Bronsted<br>
acids. Olivier-Bourbigou, H. and Magna, L. J. Mol. Cat. A: Chemical, 2002, 3484, 1-19;<br>
Cole, A. C; Jensen, J. L.; Ntai, I.; Tran, K. L. T.; Weaver, K. J.; Forbes, D. C; Davis, J. H.,<br>
Jr. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002, 124, 5962-5963; and Welton, T. Chem. Rev. 1999, 99, 2071-<br>
2084. In each IL, an alkane sulfonic acid group is covalently tethered to the IL cation.<br>
The synthetic approach used to assemble the zwitterionic precursors to the acidic IL<br>
is well-precedented. Reaction of the neutral nucleophiles N-butyl imidazole or<br>
triphenylphosphine with 1,4-butane sultone or 1,3-propane sultone, respectively, produces<br>
the requisite zwitterions in excellent yields. See Yoshizawa, M.; Hirao, M.; Ito-Akita, K.<br>
and Ohno, H. J. Mater. Chem. 2001, 11, 1057-1062. In the second step, the simultaneous<br>
realization of the latent acidity of the zwitterions and their conversion into ionic liquids is<br>
accomplished. The chemical yields for both the zwitterion formation and acidification<br>
steps are essentially quantitative. Moreover, since neither reaction produces by-products,<br>
the IL syntheses are 100% atom efficient.<br>
The zwitterion acidification is accomplished by combining 1:1 molar quantities of<br>
the zwitterions with an acid possessing a pKa sufficiently low to convert the pendant<br><br>
sulfonate group into an alkane sulfonic acid, the pKa of the latter being ~ -2. The result is<br>
the transformation of the zwitterion into an IL cation bearing an appended sulfonic acid<br>
group, with the conjugate base of the exogenous acid becoming the IL anion. Because these<br>
systems contain two formal negative charges per acidic proton, they may be regarded as<br>
internally self-buffered. For the IL syntheses reported here, the donor acids included<br>
trifluoromethane sulfonic acid, p-toluene sulfonic acid hydrate (pTSA-H2O), sulfuric acid,<br>
HPF4, HPF6, and (CF3S(O)2)2NH. Two acids were then used to convert zwitterions 1 and 2<br>
to IL 1a and 2a, respectively. The acidifications were accomplished by stirring together the<br>
neat reagents and warming gently for 2 — 24 h.<br><br>
Brousted acidic IL and the precursor zwitterions.<br>
The IL la is a somewhat viscous liquid at room temperature, while 2a is a stiff glass<br>
that liquefies around 80°C. In keeping with the behavior of other EL, neither 1a or 2a fumes<br>
or manifests any observable degree of vapor pressure, unlike strong acids dissolved in<br>
conventional EL, which frequently continue to emit noxious vapors. Further, treatment of la<br>
under vacuum (10 torr) at 150°C results in no observed loss of triflic acid (CF3SO3H bp =<br>
162°C @ 760 torr) from the EL. Moreover, washing 2a with toluene or diethyl ether results<br>
in no extraction of free pTSA (soluble in either liquid). Both of these behaviors are<br>
consistent with the donor acids being fully incorporated into their respective IL structures,<br>
rather than remaining simply mixtures of added strong acid with dissolved zwitterion, in<br>
which case some retention of pre-mixing characteristics (e.g., triflic acid volatility) would<br>
be expected.<br>
Both new IL were screened as solvent/catalysts for several classical acid-promoted<br>
organic reactions, though we placed an emphasis upon probing the chemistry of 2a (vide<br>
infra). The reaction types screened were Fischer esterification, alcohol dehydrodimerization<br>
and the pinacol/benzopinacole rearrangement. Reactions and results are outlined below in<br>
Scheme 1.<br><br><br>
Scheme 1. Representative reactions using IL 1a and 2a.<br>
Both new ionic liquids proved catalytically active in these reactions. However, we<br>
placed an emphasis at this early stage of our studies upon more fully probing the chemistry<br>
of 2a. Our motivation for doing so originates in recent reports by Karodia and co-workers<br>
in which tetraorganophosphonium tosylate salts (mp &gt; 70°C) were used as solvents for<br>
several organic reactions. Karodia, N.; Ludley, P. Tetrahedron Lett. 2001, 42, 2011-2014;<br>
Karodia, N.; Guise, S.; Newlands, C; Andersen, J. Chem. Commun. 1998, 2341-2342; and<br>
Comyns, C; Karodia, N.; Zeler, S.; Andersen, J. Catal Lett. 2000, 67, 113-115. In those<br>
reports, the cooling of the solvent upon completion of the reaction resulted in the separation<br>
of the IL as a solid. We reasoned that 2a might behave similarly, providing direct access to<br>
a convenient mode of separation, decantation, which parallels the manner in which solid<br>
acids are removed from reaction media. As expected, this proved to be the case in most of<br>
the reactions in which 2a was used.<br>
The reaction of alcohols with strong acids is used both for alkene and ether<br>
synthesis, the favored product being selected by the judicious choice of acid and reaction<br>
conditions. Depending upon the substrate/2a stoichiometry, 1-octanol is selectively<br>
converted to octyl ether in 16%-56% isolated yield with minimal by-product formation. In a<br>
control experiment, pTSA-H2O gave a better yield of octyl ether but more by-products were<br>
formed and the separation of the pTSA from the reaction milieu was considerably more<br>
difficult. Using Nafion-117+ as a control, we found the catalyst/product separation to be<br>
straightforward and by-product formation to be minimal, but the yield of octyl ether was<br>
quite poor (3%).<br>
The rearrangement of pinacol to pinacolone is a process of considerable industrial<br>
importance. The latter provides a synthetic entree to trimethylpyruvate and then tert-<br>
leucine, a building block of several peptidomimetric drugs and chiral catalysts. Stinson, S.<br>
E. Chem. Eng. News online at http://www.pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/960715/page.html.<br><br>
Though existing procedures use H2SO4 or H3PO4 to catalyze the reaction, interest has been<br>
expressed in the replacement of these species by solid acids. Using various solid acid<br>
catalysts, reported yields of pinacolone range from 2%-71%, but long reaction periods are<br>
typical, and the use of a volatile organic solvent is required, complicating isolation. Hsien,<br>
M.; Sheu, H.-T.; Lee, T.; Cheng, S. and Lee, J.-F. J. Mol. Cat. A: Chemical 2002,181, 189-<br>
200. Using 2a as catalyst/solvent, we obtained an unoptimized yield of pinacolone of 35%<br>
during a one-hour reaction period, and an 88% yield of benzopinacolone over a two-hour<br>
period. Moreover, the pinacolone is readily distilled as a pure compound straight from the<br>
reaction milieu, unreacted pinacol being retained by the solvent/catalyst phase.<br>
Ultimately, the ease with which these IL are recycled is central to their utility.<br>
Consequently, we examined the formation of ethyl acetate, an important commodity ester,<br>
from ethanol and acetic acid using 2a as the solvent/catalyst in a batch-type process, i.e.,<br>
recycling the 2a. Otera, J. Angew. Client. Int. Ed. 2001, 40, 2044-2045. The results of a<br>
representative round of recycling experiments are summarized below in Table 1.<br><br>
Table 1. Recycling of 2a in the synthesis of ethyl acetate.<br>
As shown, the yield of the ester increases from cycles 1 to 3, only to drop off again<br>
in cycle 4. During these cycles, the mass of the solvent/catalyst medium also increases,<br>
consistent with the entrapment of materials by the cooled catalyst phase. Post-cycling<br>
analysis of the IL by GC and NMR was consistent with the retention of appreciable<br>
quantities of water and acetic acid. When heated under vacuum to remove these volatile<br>
materials, the catalytic activity of 2a was found to increase, in line with the degree to which<br>
water is removed from the system.<br>
For an equilibrium reaction in which water is a product, the initial increase in ester<br>
yield accompanying the retention of water in cycles 1-3 was unexpected. It appears that for<br><br>
reasons yet to be determined, the presence of a threshold quantity of water in the ionic<br>
liquid contributes to higher reaction yields. To test the plausibility of this theory, we<br>
charged a dried sample of 2a with a bolus of water, estimated to be equivalent to the<br>
cumulative amount retained after cycles 1 and 2; we found the yield (entry 5) of ethyl<br>
acetate to be greater than that obtained using dried 2a (entry 1).<br>
Overall, the IL are versatile solvent/catalysts for the reactions examined, and<br>
provide further examples of the capacity of ionic liquids to be fashioned for specific<br>
chemical applications. They provide good product selectivities as well as a balance<br>
between the yields achievable using a homogeneous acid catalyst and the ease of<br>
catalyst/substrate separation provided by a heterogeneous catalyst.<br>
Carbon Dioxide Capture by a Task-Specific Ionic Liquid<br>
Remarkably, we have discovered an IL that captures CO2. The cation of this new<br>
task-specific ionic liquid consists of an imidazolium ion to which a primary amine moiety is<br>
covalently tethered. This salt readily and reversibly sequesters CO2. The ionic liquid is<br>
prepared from commercially available starting materials. The cation core is assembled by<br>
the reaction of 1-butylimidazole with 2-bromopropylamine hydrobromide in ethanol. After<br>
24 h under reflux, the ethanol is removed in vacuo and the solid residue dissolved in a<br>
minimal quantity of water which is brought to ~pH 8 by the addition, in small portions, of<br>
solid KOH. The product imidazolium bromide is then separated from the KBr by-product<br>
by evaporation of the water, followed by extraction of the residue with ethanol-THF, in<br>
which the imidazolium salt is soluble. Subsequent ion exchange using NaBF4 in<br>
ethanol/water gave the product salt 1 in 58% overall yield. NMR and FAB-MS verify the<br>
structure and composition of the IL. After drying under vacuum at 80°C, the product is a<br>
relatively viscous, water-free liquid that may be used directly for CO2 sequestration. See<br>
Scheme 2. <br>
Scheme 2. Proposed reaction between TSIL 1 and CO2.<br>
Consistent with observations by Brennecke and co-workers, CO2 at 1 atm exhibits<br>
intrinsic solubility in the "conventional" ionic liquid phase 1-hexyl-3-methyl imidazolium<br><br>
hexafluorophosphate, [6-mim]PF6. Blanchard, L.A. et al. Nature 1999, 399, 28-31; and<br>
Blanchard, L.A. et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2001, 105, 2437. This is manifested by a 0.0881%<br>
increase in mass of the IL upon exposure to CO2, and also by the FT-IR spectrum of the<br>
gas-treated EL, which has peaks characteristic of dissolved CO2 at 2380 and 2400 cm.-1 In a<br>
similar fashion, 1 exhibits a mass increase when exposed to CO2, but one that considerably<br>
exceeds that observed with [6-mim]PF6. When 1.2896 g of pure 1 is exposed to a stream of<br>
dry CO2 for 3 h at 1 atm at room temperature (-295 K), a total mass gain of 0.0948 g<br>
(7.4%) is observed, a vastly greater increase than that observed for [6-mim]PF6.<br><br>
CO2/TSIL molar ratio as a function of time.<br>
The molar uptake of CO2 per mole of TSIL during the 3 h exposure period<br>
approaches 0.5, the theoretical maximum for CO2 sequestration as an ammonium carbamate<br>
salt. This per mole uptake of CO2 by the amine-appended TSEL is comparable to those of<br>
standard sequestering amines, such as monoethanolamine (MEA), P,P'-<br>
hydroxyaminoethylether (DGA) and diisopropanolamine (DIPA). The process of CO2<br>
uptake is reversible; CO2 extruded from the IL upon heating (80°-100°C) for several hours<br>
under vacuum. The recovered ionic liquid has been recycled (five cycles) for CO2 uptake<br>
with no observed loss of efficiency.<br>
Significantly, the sequestration of CO2 by the TSEL is borne out by comparison of<br>
the FT-ER and NMR spectra of the gas-untreated and gas-treated materials. In the FT-IR,<br>
the spectrum of the CO2 treated material manifests a new absorption at 1666 cm" ,<br>
consistent with a carbamate C=O stretch. Among the other prominent IR changes are those<br>
associated with N-H resonances. Centered at 3238 cm"1, a broad amide N-II band with<br>
considerable fine structure is now present. Another broad new band is centered around<br>
3623 cm-1, and is assigned as an ammonium N-H stretch. Equally noteworthy is the virtual<br><br>
absence of bands associated with dissolved CO2. When subjected to heating under vacuum,<br>
the FT-IR spectrum of the sample returns to a pre-CO2 exposure appearance.<br>
The 13C-NMR spectrum of the CO2 treated product also supportsformation of a<br>
TSIL-ammonium carbamate. Most notably, a new resonance is observed at 5 158.11,<br>
attributable to a carbamate carbonyl carbon. Also new is a peak at 56.52 ppm, consistent<br>
with a methylene carbon attached to the carbamate nitrogen atom. The other features of the<br>
spectrum generally consist of peaks near those of the starting free-amine TSIL. However,<br>
the new resonances are "doubled" due to one-half of the amine TSIL becoming each a<br>
carbamate- and an ammonium-appended species.<br>
Various Applications of Ionic Liquids<br>
Ionic liquids that preferentially dissolve certain gaseous species can be used in<br>
conventional gas absorption applications. The non-volatile nature of ionic liquids plays two<br>
important roles. First, there will be no cross-contamination of the gas stream by the solvent<br>
during operation. This means no solvent loss and no air pollution. Second, regeneration of<br>
the solvent is easy; a simple flash or mild distillation step is all that is required to remove<br>
the gas from the solvent, again with no cross-contamination.<br>
In addition to their use as conventional absorbents, ionic liquids may be<br>
immobilized on a support and used in a supported liquid membrane (SLM). The membrane<br>
will work if a gas preferentially dissolves in the liquid. SLMs may be used in a continuous<br>
separation process without a regeneration step. Conventional SLM technology is<br>
undermined by the fact that the liquid in which the gas dissolves eventially evaporates, thus<br>
rendering the membrane useless. Since ionic liquids are completely non-volatile, this<br>
problem is eliminated.<br>
Ionic liquids also find use in the conversion of brown coal and oil shale into value-<br>
added products, such as alternative synthetic fuels and/or high-quality chemical feedstocks.<br>
For example, 1-butyl-3-methyl imidazolium, has been used to extract organic compounds<br>
from Estonian oil shale kerogen at various temperatures. Results at 175° C yielded soluble<br>
products with an increase often times over that obtained using conventional organic<br>
solvents.<br>
Bronsted-acidic ILs also act as proton shuttles, functionally carrying protons from<br>
acidic resin surfaces (e.g., Nafion) to the surrounding medium, where they are more free to<br>
react than if the proton is held at the polymer surface. Moreover, the Bronsted-acidic ILs<br>
have absolutely no vapor pressure when dissolved in water. For example, a relatively<br><br>
concentrated solution of HCl gives off HCI gas; in contrast, a Bronsted-acidic IL gives off<br>
no gaseous acid -- pH paper suspended above the surface does not change colors!<br>
Many product streams, particularly in the field of petroleum chemistry, include<br>
olefins and non-olefins. For example, ethane crackers tend to produce a mixture of ethane<br>
and ethylene. The ethylene is typically separated from the ethane via distillation. Because<br>
the boiling points of ethylene and ethane are relatively close to one another, the distillation<br>
is typically done at very low temperatures and/or high pressures; the separation is relatively<br>
expensive. The same problems are observed when separating propane from propylene in<br>
dehydrogenation facilities. Ionic liquids are useful is separating such mixtures. For<br>
example, an ionic liquid with a pendant functional group that coordinates the pi-biond of an<br>
olefin may be used to dissolve selectively the olefinic components of such a mixture.<br>
Likewise, an ionic liquid with a pendant functional group that coordinates a transition metal<br>
capable of coordinating the pi-bond of an olefin may be used to dissolve selectively the<br>
olefinic components of such a mixture. In either case, the dissolved olefins subsequently<br>
can be isolated by desorption.<br>

Exemplification<br>
The invention now being generally described, it will be more readily understood by<br>
reference to the following examples, which are included merely for purposes of illustration<br>
of certain aspects and embodiments of the present invention, and are not intended to limit<br>
the invention.<br>
Example J<br>
Bronsted Acidic Ionic Liquids and Their Use as Catalysts-Solvents<br>
General Considerations<br>
1H NMR (300 MHz) and 13C NMR (75 MHz) spectra were obtained as solutions in<br>
either CDCl3 or D2O. Chemical shifts were reported in parts per million (ppm, 5) and<br>
referenced to CHCl3 (δ 7.27) or D2O (5 4.88). Infrared spectra were recorded as a thin film<br>
on sodium chloride and absorptions were reported in wavenumbers (cm-1). Melting points<br>
are uncorrected. Distillations were performed using a Kugelrohr ball-tube distillation<br>
apparatus. Gas chromatographic analyses were performed using an Agilent 6850 system<br>
(FID). TLC analyses were performed on Whatman flexible polyester backed TLC plates<br>
with a fluorescent indicator. Detection was conducted by UV absorption (254 nm) and<br>
charring with 10% KMnO4 in water. Baker silica gel (47-61 microns) was used for all<br>
chromatographic separations. Anhydrous organic solvents were dried and then distilled<br>
prior to use. Acetic acid, acetic anhydride, benzopinacole, ethanol, hexanoic acid, 1-<br><br>
octanol, pinacol and p-toluenesulfonic acid were not purified prior to use. All other<br>
chemicals used for synthetic procedures were reagent grade or better. Solutions were<br>
concentrated in vacuo with a rotary evaporator and the residue was purified using a silica<br>
gel column unless specified otherwise.<br><br>
Triphenylphosphine and 1,3-propane sultone were combined in equimolar quantities in<br>
toluene and brought to reflux. Overnight, a white precipitate formed which was isolated by<br>
filtration and dried. Analysis of the solid revealed it to be the desired zwitterion, formed in<br>
quantitative yield. The desired zwitterion was of sufficient purity to be used without any<br>
further purification. Conversion to the ionic liquid was accomplished by combining<br>
equimolar quantities of pTSA hydrate and the zwitterion and heating to 70 °C for 24 h,<br>
during which time the solids liquefy, resulting in the formation of triphenyl(propyl-3-<br>
sulfonyl)phosphonium toluenesulfonate. The IL phase was then washed repeatedly with<br>
toluene and ether to remove non-ionic residues, and dried in vacuo. The product was<br>
formed quantitatively and in high purity as assessed by mass balance and NMR<br>
spectroscopy. Spectral data:1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O); δ 7.66 - 7.60 (m, 3H), 7.53 - 7.44<br>
(m, 14H), 7.06 (d, J = 8.0, 2H), 3.31 - 3.21 (m, 2H), 2.89 (t, J= 6.9, 2H), 2.11 (s, 3H), 1.97<br>
- 1.80 (m,2H). 13C NMR (75.5 MHz, D2O); δ 142.21, 139.75, 135.29, 135.25, 133.47,<br>
133.34, 130.40, 130.23, 129.42, 125.44, 118.13, 116.98, 50.55, 50.33, 20.58, 20.04, 17.9.<br><br>
To a 5 mL reaction conical vial equipped with stir bar and reflux condenser was<br>
added 882 mg triphenyl(propyl-3-sulphonyl)phosphonium toluenesulfonate. Next added in<br><br>
one portion was 58.8 mg benzopinacole. The reaction was allowed to warm to 140 C for a<br>
period of 2 hours. The resulting monophase was then allowed to cool to room temperature<br>
at which time the biphase was washed with EtOAc (3 x 2.0 mL) after addition of 1.0 mL<br>
water and 2.0 mL EtOAc. The combined organic phases were dried with anhydrous<br>
MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. The crude product (71.1 mg) revealed over a<br>
99% conversion from benzopinacole to benzopinacolone via GC ((HP-1 methyl siloxane)<br>
100°C (2 min), 10°C/min, 275°C (10 min)) 11.32 min (benzopinacole); 21.38 min<br>
(benzopinacolone). Purification by silica gel chromatography (EtOAc/Hex 1:8) afforded<br>
the desired material in 49.5 mg (88% isolated yield) as a white crystalline solid. Spectral<br>
data of this material matched that of commercially available material.<br><br>
To a 5 mL reaction conical vial equipped with stir bar and reflux condenser was<br>
added 1.0 g (1.91 mmol) triphenyl(propyl-3-sulphonyl)phosphonium toluenesulfonate.<br>
Next added in one portion was 1.0 mL (6.35 mmol) 1-octanol. The reaction was allowed to<br>
warm to 175 Cover a period of 2 hours. The resulting monophase was then allowed to<br>
cool to room temperature at which time the biphase was washed with EtOAc (3 x 2.0 mL)<br>
after addition of 1.0 mL water and 2.0 mL EtOAc. The combined organic phases were<br>
dried with anhydrous MgSO4, filtered and concentrated in vacuo. Purification by bulb-to-<br>
bulb distillation (bp 130 °C/ 3 mm Hg (air bath temp)) afforded the desired material in 432<br>
mg (56 % isolated yield) as a clear and colorless oil.<br>
The ratio of alcohol to IL effected the overall yield of octyl ether formation. From<br>
the combination of approximately 300 mg (0.57 mmol) rriphenyl(propyl-3-<br>
sulphonyl)phosphonium toluenesulfonate and 0.45 mL 1-octanol, afforded was 55 mg (16%<br>
isolated yield), whereas from the combination of 771 mg (1.47 mmol) triphenyl(propyI-3-<br>
sulphonyl)phosphonium toluenesulfonate and 0.5 mL (3.18 mmol) 1-octanol, afforded was<br>
96.8 mg (25% isolated yield). The products in each run were analyzed by GC ((HP-1<br>
methyl siloxane) 100°C (2 min), 10°C/min, 275°C (10 min)) 4.83 min (1-octanol); 12.03<br>

commercially available material.<br>
Control Reaction using PTSA: From the combination of 1-octanol (0.5 mL, 3.17<br>
mmol) and p-toluenesulfonic acid (280 mg, 1.47 mmol (using the monohydrate)) was<br><br>
obtained 187 mg n-octyl ether (49% isolated yield) based upon purification of the crude<br>
product by bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 130 °C/ 3 mm Hg (air bath temp)).<br>
Control Reaction using NAFION 117: From the combination of 0.5 mL 1-octanol<br>
(3.17 mmol) and 0.314 g NAFION 117 (0.28 meq (0.89 meq/g)) in 3.0 mL toluene (1.1 M)<br>
as solvent was obtained 12.4 mg n-octyl ether (3% isolated yield) upon purification of the<br>
crude product (GC ratio of 90:10 (octanohoctyl ether)) by bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 130<br>
°C/3 mm Hg (air bath temp)).<br><br>
A 5 mL reaction conical vial was equipped with stir bar and Hinkman-Hinkle still<br>
head. Attached onto the still head was a reflux condenser with drying tube. To the reaction<br>
conical vial was added approximately 1.0 g triphenyl(propyl-3-sulphonyl)phosphonium<br>
toluenesulfonate. Next added in one portion to the reaction vial was 290 mg pinacol. The<br>
reaction was allowed to warm to a maximum temperature of 180 C for a total period of 1<br>
hour. The resulting monophase was then allowed to cool to room temperature at which<br>
time the distillate was transferred to another flask and analyzed by GC ((HP-1 methyl<br>
siloxane) 50°C (2 min), 10°C/min, 275°C (10 min)) 4.07 min (pinacolone); 6.17 min<br>
(pinacol) and NMR. Purification of the crude product via bulb-to-bulb distillation (bp 125<br>
°C/ 3 mm Hg (air bath temp)) afforded the desired material in 86 mg (35% isolated yield)<br>
as a clear and colorless oil. Spectral data of this material matched that of commercially<br>
available material.<br><br><br>
From the combination of l~butylimidazole and 1,4-butane sultone was formed in<br>
excellent yield. After washing the salt with diethyl ether and toluene to remove any<br>
unreacted starting materials, the solid was dried in vacuo. Then, a stoichiometric amount<br>
of trifluoromethanesulfonic acid was added and the mixture stirred for two hours at 40°C<br>
during which time the solid zwitterion dissolved/liquefied, resulted in the formation of 3-<br>
butyl-1-(buryl-4-sulfonyl)imidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate. The IL phase was then<br>
washed repeatedly with toluene and ether to remove non-ionic residues, and dried in vacuo.<br>
The product was formed quantitatively and in high purity as assessed by mass balance and<br>
NMR spectroscopy. Spectral data: 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O); δ 8.68 (s, 1H), 7.40 (d, J=<br>

To a 5 mL reaction vial equipped with stir bar was added approximately 200 μL of 3-<br>
butyl-l-(butyl-4-sulfonyl)imidazolium trifluoromethanesulfonate (1.9 M). Added next via<br>
syringe was 1-octanol (60 μL, 0.38 mmol) followed by hexanoic acid (48 μL, 0.38 mmol).<br>
The resulting monophase was allowed to stir at room temperature for a period of 7 days at<br>
which time the oil was washed with toluene (5 x 2 mL). Shorter reaction times using higher<br>
reaction temperatures also afforded excellent conversion of acid to ester. Reaction of 1-<br>
octanol and acetic acid resulted in 89% conversion to n-octyl acetate at 40°C for a period of<br>
72 h whereas 83% conversion was observed at 40°C for 48 h. The collected organic<br>
washes were concentrated in vacuo to afford 76 mg of n-octyl hexanoate. GC analysis of<br>
the crude product revealed only trace amounts of starting material in the organic washes.<br>
Purification of the crude colorless oil by bulb-to-bulb distillation afforded the desired<br>

The reaction setup used to illustrate the reuse of the EL in synthetic transformations<br>
consisted of a 5 mL reaction conical vial equipped with a magnetic spin vane. Attached to<br>
the conical vial was a Hinkman-Hinkle still head which itself was equipped with a Claisen<br>
adapter and reflux condenser. Proper alignment of one of the two inlet ports of the Claisen<br>
adapter was essential for the addition of reagents via a syringe pump. The setup was<br>
equipped with a drying tube packed with CaCl2 and heated externally via a sand bath.<br>
Representative Procedure<br>
To the 5 mL reaction conical vial charged with 2.1 g IL (4.0 mmol) was added via<br>
syringe acetic acid (1.0 mL, 17.5 mmol) and ethanol (1.0 mL, 17.5 mmol). The reaction<br>
mixture was allowed to warm to a maximum temperature of 175°C (external temperature)<br>
over a period of 45 min. Although completion of reaction was observed prior to reaching<br>
the maximum temperature, reuse of the reaction setup/TL made it necessary to remove all<br>
volatile components via distillation prior to the next cycle. With each cycle, reaction<br>
completion was confirmed by GC analysis [GC ((HP-1 methyl siloxane; f= 1.0 mL/min)<br>
50°C (2 min), 10°C/min, 275°C (10 min)) 3.21 min (EtOH), 3.37 min (EtOAc), 3.42 min<br>
(AcOH)] and documented via the mass of distillate obtained. Each cycle afforded pure<br>
ethyl acetate without any appreciable amounts of starting material (
EtOH due to an EtOH/EtOAc azeotrope (31% by weight and bp of 78°C)). Biphasic<br><br>
mixtures were separated and factored into product formation was maximum water content<br>
of 3.3%.<br>
Control Reaction<br>
A 5 mL reaction conical vial was charged with acetic acid (1.0 mL, 17.5 mmol) and<br>
ethanol (1.0 mL, 17.5 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to amaximum<br>
temperature of 175°C (external temperature) over a period of 45 min. Observed were no<br>
appreciable amounts of distillate even after continuous heating 30 min after the 45 min<br>
window. The distillate that was collected consisted of EtOH (97%) and EtOAc (7%).<br>
Remaining in the reaction conical vial was AcOH.<br>
Regeneration and Subsequent Reuse of Ionic Liquid<br>
The system after multiple cycles retained a significant amount of mass, primarily<br>
water, which correlated to a rise in mass percentage of over 151%. Based upon the mass<br>
balance of reaction cycles and product yields, the rise in mass consists of water and acetic<br>
acid. Removal of the VOCs using heat (
However, when the setup was evacuated (10 Torr) and warmed to 65°C over a period of 5<br>
hours, observed was the loss in volume contained in the reaction vial. The resulting ionic<br>
liquid still contained AcOH (42%) based upon 1H NMR analysis. Using the results from<br>
cycle 2, 0.441 mL of water was added prior to the addition of ethanol and acetic acid in an<br>
effort to mimic the water:IL ratio. This control experiment afforded 1.3 g ethyl acetate<br>
(87% isolated yield).<br><br><br>
aIsolated yield. bIsolated yield using<br>
regenerated ionic liquid (addition of 0.441 mL<br>
water prior to run).<br><br>
A 100 mL round-bottomed flask was charged with a magnetic stirbar, 50 mL of<br>
toluene and 3.29 g (40 mmol) 1-methyl imidazole. To this solution was then added 5.0 g<br>
(40 mmol) of 2-(chloroethyI) ethyl sulfide. A condenser was fitted, and the solution heated<br>
to and maintained at reflux for 12 h. During this time, a dense yellow-brown liquid phase<br>
separated from the toluene. After cooling, the toluene layer was separated and discarded,<br>
and the lower, ionic liquid layer washed with 2 x 50 mL of diethyl ether. The viscous<br>
liquid was dried overnight in vacuo (7.41 g, 89%).<br>
Part 2<br>
The imidazolium chloride product from Part 1 (7.41 g, 35.8 mmol) was dissolved in<br>
25 mL of acetonitrile and treated with 8.01 g (35.8 mmol of lithium<br>
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonylimide). The dissolution of the latter was quickly followed by<br><br>
the precipitation of LiC1. After stirring overnight, the suspension was filtered and the<br>
solvent removed in vacuo to leave the bis(triflyl)imide salt of the imidazolium cation (12.02<br>
g, 86%).<br>
Part 3<br>
A 100 mL flask was charged with a stirbar and 1.51 g (3.9 mmol) of the product salt<br>
isolated in Part 2. This was then dissolved in 50 mL dichloromethane and the solution<br>
cooled to 0°C. To the cooled, stirred solution was added dropwise a solution of 1.00 g m-<br>
chloroperoxybenzoic acid (66.9% peroxide activity by assay, 3.9 mmol active peroxide)<br>
dissolved in 10 mL dichloromethane. The solution was allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature, during which time a white precipitate formed. After stirring for 12 h, the<br>
solvent was removed in vacuo, and the white solid residue extracted with 5 x 50 mL<br>
portions of ether. The by-product m-chlorobenzoic acid was completely extracted into the<br>
ether washings, leaving the pale-yellow liquid product.<br>

Part 1<br>
A 250 mL round-bottomed flask was charged with a magnetic stirbar, 75 mL of<br>
toluene and 11.55 g (120 mmol) 1,2-dimethyl imidazole. To this solution was then added<br>
14.97 g (120 mmol) of 2-(chloroethyl) ethyl sulfide. A condenser was fitted, and the<br>
solution heated to and maintained at reflux for 12 h. During this time, a dense yellow-<br>
brown liquid phase separated from the toluene. After cooling, the toluene layer was<br>
separated and discarded, and the lower, ionic liquid layer washed with 2 x 50 mL of diethyl<br>
ether. The viscous liquid was dried overnight in vacuo, solidifying during that time into a<br>
low-melting, tan crystalline solid. (18.06 g, 68%).<br>
Part 2<br>
The imidazolium chloride product from Part 1 (7.70 g, 35.0 mmol) was dissolved in<br>
25 mL of acetonitrile and treated with 10.04 g (35.0 mmol of lithium<br>
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonylimide). The dissolution of the latter was quickly followed by<br>
the precipitation of LiC1. After stirring overnight, the suspension was filtered and the<br>
solvent removed in vacuo to leave the bis(triflyl)imide salt of the imidazolium cation (12.20<br>
g, 75%).<br><br>
Part 3<br>
A 100 mL flask was charged with a stirbar and 4.35 g (19.8 mmol) of the chloride<br>
salt isolated in Part 1. This was then dissolved in 50 mL dichloromethane and the solution<br>
cooled to 0°C. To the cooled, stirred solution was added dropwise a solution of 5.10 g m-<br>
chloroperoxybenzoic acid (66.9% peroxide activity by assay, 19.8 mrnol active peroxide)<br>
dissolved in 10 mL dichloromethane. The solution was allowed to warm to room<br>
temperature and stir for 12 h, after which time the solvent was removed in vacuo, and the<br>
white solid residue extracted with 5 x 50 mL portions of ether. The by-product m-<br>
chlorobenzoic acid was completely extracted into the ether washings, leaving the pale-<br>
yellow glass that was shown by NMR to still contain m-chlorobenzoic acid. The glass was<br>
then dissolved in 50/50 (v/v) acetonitrile/methanol and chromatographed on silica gel.<br>
Elution of a pale yellow band gave the product IL sulfoxide chloride salt as a yellow glass<br>
that liquefies upon modest heating (2.4 g, 50%).<br>

A 50 mL flask was charged with a magnetic stirbar, 1.0 g (4.2 mmol) of Sulfoxide<br>
IL 3 (Example 8) and 10 mL of deionized water. In a separate flask sheilded from light,<br>
0.40 g (4.5 mmol) sodium dicyanamide was dissolved in 10 mL of deionized water. To this<br>
solution was added 0.77 g (4.5 mmol) silver nitrate, and the solution stirred for four hours.<br>
At the end of this period, the suspended solid (AgC2N3) was quickly recovered by filtration,<br>
washed with a small portion of water, and added into the flask containing Sulfoxide IL 3.<br>
This flask was stirred in the dark for two hours, after which time the precipitated silver<br><br>
chloride was removed by filtration. Removal in vacuo of the water from the yellow-orange<br>

A 100 mL flask was charged with a magnetic stirbar and 8.0 g (94 mmol) N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidine. To the amine was added 40 mL of acetonitrile and 14.0 g (96 mmol) 2-<br>
chloroethyl ethyl sulfide. The solution was then heated at reflux for 24 h, after which time<br>
the volatiles were removed in vacuo. The sticky tan-brown residue was repeatedly washed<br>
with small portions of toluene and then ether. The impure product was taken up into 50/50<br>
v/v acetonitrile/methanol and filtered through a short silica column. The solvent was<br>
removed in vacuo leaving a tan solid (5.9 g, 27%, unoptimized).<br>
Part 2<br>
A 100 mL flask was charged with a stirbar and 2.0 g (8.6 mmol) of the<br>
pyrrolidinium chloride salt isolated from Part 1. To this solid was added 25 mL of<br>
acetonitrile and 2.5 g (8.6 mmol) lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. The<br>
dissolution of the latter was followed by precipitation of lithium chloride, which was<br>
removed by filtration. Evaporation of the acetonitrile gave a viscous, pale yellow liquid<br>
(3.3 g, 80%).<br>
Part 3<br>
The product isolated from Part 2 (6.9 mmol) was dissolved in 50 mL<br>
dichloromethane in a 100 mL flask that had also been charged with a magnetic stirbar. To<br>
this stirred solution was added 1.78 g of m-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (66.9% peroxide<br>
activity by assay, 6.9 mmol active peroxide) dissolved in 10 mL dichloromethane. The<br>
solution was stirred overnight, during which time a white solid formed. The solvent was<br>
removed in vacuo and the white solid residue extracted with 4 x 50 mL portions of ether.<br><br>
The by-product m-chlorobenzoic acid was extracted into the ether washings, leaving a<br>
viscous, colorless liquid product.<br><br>
Under an atmosphere of argon, a 100 mL flask equipped with a stirbar and fitted<br>
with a reflux condenser was charged with 10.0 g of a 50 wt. % solution of tributylphosphine<br>
(24.6 mmol phosphine) in toluene. While maintaining the inert atmosphere, 3.0 g (25.0<br>
mmol) tetrahydrofurfuryl chloride was added and the solution brought to reflux. After 12 h,<br>
a white solid had precipitated which was isolated by filtration (7.49 g, 94%).<br>
Part 2<br>
The solid chloride salt isolated in Part 1 was dissolved in 75 mL of acetonitrile,<br>
giving a colorless solution. To this stirred solution was added 6.64 g (23 mmol) of lithium<br>
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)irnide. Dissolution of the former in the acetonitrile was<br>
followed in a short period of time by the precipitation of lithium chloride. After stirring for<br>
two hours, the solid was removed by filtration and the solvent stripped in vacuo. The<br>
residual colorless oil was washed with 3 x 20 mL of ether and dried in vacuo, leaving a<br>
colorless oil (10.8 g, 82%).<br>

In a 250 mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirbar, 10.0 g (99 mmol) of furfuryl<br>
amine was dissolved in 100 mL of deionized water. To the stirred solution was added 18.1<br>
g of a 48 wt. % solution of tetrafluoroboric acid in water (99 mmol acid). After stirring for<br>
two days, 1.49 g (49.5 mmol) of powdered formaldehyde was added to the yellow solution,<br>
which was then heated to 70oC, at which point the mixture became homogeneous. The<br>
solution was then cooled to room temperature, at which point 7.2 g of 40% aqueous glyoxal<br>
(49.5 mmol glyoxal) was added and stirring continued for 3 h during which time the<br>
solution became orange-brown in color. The aqueous solution was then extracted with<br>
three 100 mL portions of dichloromethane, which were then combined and dried over<br>
magnesium sulfate. The solid was then removed by filtration and the solvent removed in<br>

p-toluenesulfonic acid hydrate (1.72 g, 0.009034 mol). The mixture of solids was warmed<br>
and stirred at 45 °C-60°C overnight, resulting in the liquefaction of the solids; after cooling<br>
of the liquid the a stiff glass was formed that re-liquefies below 85 °C. The presence of<br>
water (7-10 molecules per mole of salt) in the initial salt induces a lower melting point.<br>
The anhydrous salt melts at 180°C. 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O); δ 7.66 - 7.60 (m, 3H). 7.53<br>
- 7.44 (m, 14H), 7.06 (d, J= 8.0, 2H), 3.31 - 3.21 (m, 2H), 2.89 (t, J= 6.9, 2H), 2.11 (s,<br>
3H), 1.97-1.80 (m,2H). 13C NMR (75.5 MHz, D2O); δ 142.21, 139.75, 135.29, 135.25,<br>
133.47, 133.34, 130.40, 130.23, 129.42, 125.44, 118.13, 116.98, 50.55,50.33,20.58, 20.04,<br>

Synthesis of IL 3<br>
In a toluene solution (10.0 cm3) of tributylphosphine (50% by weight in toluene,<br>
0.0222 mol) 1,3-propane sultone (2.72 g, 0.02227 mol) was added. The mixture was heated<br>
and stirred at reflux overnight under an argon atmosphere, resulting in the formation of a<br>
white precipitate. The solution was then concentrated in vacuo with a rotary evaporator to<br><br>
half it's original volume, and the solid product then isolated by filtration. The zwitterion<br>
was washed with diethyl ether (50 cm3) and dried in vacuo with a rotary evaporator and<br>
mechanical pump (4.77 g, 66%). The dried zwitterion (4.00 g, 0.0123 mol) was acidified by<br>
the addition of solid bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (3.47 g, 0.0123 mol). The mixture<br>
was heated at 50 °C overnight under argon, resulting in the liquefaction of the solids and the<br>
formation of a somewhat viscous liquid (7.45 g, 99%) that decreases in viscosity even upon<br>
mild (45°C) heating.<br>
Synthesis of ethyl acetate using an IL as acid catalyst<br>
To IL2 (2.1 g, 4.0 mmol) was added via syringe acetic acid (1.0 mL, 17.5 mmol) and<br>
ethanol (1.0 mL, 17.5 mmol). The reaction mixture was allowed to warm to a maximum<br>
temperature of 175°C (external temperature) over a period of 45 min. Although completion<br>
of reaction was observed prior to reaching the maximum temperature, reuse of the reaction<br>
setup/IL made it necessary to remove all volatile components via distillation prior to the<br>
next cycle. With each cycle, reaction completion was confirmed by GC analysis [GC ((HP-<br>
1 methyl siloxane; f= 1.0 mL/min) 50°C (2 min), 10°C/min, 275°C (10 min)) 3.21 min<br>
(EtOH), 3.37 min (EtOAc), 3.42 min (AcOH)] and documented via the mass of distillate<br>
obtained. Each cycle afforded pure ethyl acetate without any appreciable amounts of<br>
starting material (
weight and bp of 78°C)). Biphasic mixtures were separated and factored into product<br>
formation was maximum water content of 3.3%.<br>
