METHODS AND REAGENTS FOR THE TREATMENT OF DISEASES AND DISORDERS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED LEVELS OF<br>
PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to the treatment of immunoinflammatory disorders.<br>
Immunoinflammatory disorders are characterized by the inappropriate activation of the body's immune defenses. Rather than targeting infectious invaders, the immune response targets and damages the body's own tissues or transplanted tissues. The tissue targeted by the immune system varies with the disorder. For example, in multiple sclerosis, the immune response is directed against the neuronal tissue, while in Crohn's disease the digestive tract is targeted. Immunoinflammatory disorders affect millions of individuals and include conditions such as asthma, allergic intraocular inflammatory diseases, arthritis, atopic dermatitis, atopic eczema, diabetes, hemolytic anaemia, inflammatory dermatoses, inflammatory bowel or gastrointestinal disorders (e.g., Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, pruritis/inflammation, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus.<br>
Current treatment regimens for immunoinflammatory disorders typically rely on immunosuppressive agents. The effectiveness of these agents can vary and their use is often accompanied by adverse side effects. Thus, improved therapeutic agents and methods for the treatment of immunoinflammatory disorders are needed.<br><br>

"NsIDI" is meant any non-steroidal agent that decreases proinflammatory<br>
xytokine-production or secretion, binds an immunophilin, or causes a down<br>
regulation of the proinflammatory reaction. NsIDIs include calcineurin<br>
inhibitors, such as cyclosporine, tacrolimus, ascomycin, pimecrolimus, as well<br>
as other agents (peptides, peptide fragments, chemically modified peptides, or<br>
peptide mimetics) that inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin. NsIDIs<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the patient subject to a treatment described herein does not have clinical depression, an anxiety or panic disorder, an obsessive/compulsive disorder, alcoholism, an eating disorder, an attention-deficit disorder, a borderline personality disorder, a sleep disorder, a headache, premenstrual syndrome, an irregular heartbeat, schizophrenia, Tourette's syndrome, or phobias.<br>
	'- By "an amount sufficient" is meant the amount of a compound, in a<br>
combination of the invention, required to treat or prevent an immunoinflammatory disease in a clinically relevant manner. A sufficient amount of an active compound used to practice the present invention for therapeutic treatment of conditions caused by or contributing to an immunoinflammatory disease varies depending upon the manner of administration, the age, body weight, and general health of the patient. Ultimately, the prescribers will decide the appropriate amount and dosage regimen. Additionally, an effective amount may can be that amount of compound in the combination of the invention that is safe and efficacious in the treatment of a patient having the immunoinflammatory disease over each agent alone as determined and approved by a regulatory authority (such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration).<br><br>
By "more effective" is meant that a treatment exhibits greater efficacy, or is less toxic, safer, more convenient, or less expensive than another treatment with which it is being compared. Efficacy may be measured by a skilled practitioner using any standard method.that is appropriate for a given indication.<br>

Non-Steroidal ImmuBophilin-Dependent Immunosuppressants<br>
In one embodiment, the invention features methods, compositions, and kits employing an SSRI and a non-steroidal immunophilin-dependent immunosuppressant (NsIDI), optionally with a corticosteroid or other agent described herein.<br>
In healthy individuals the immune system uses cellular effectors, such as B-cells and T-cells, to target infectious microbes and abnormal cell types while leaving normal cells intact. In individuals with an autoimmune disorder or a transplanted organ, activated T-cells damage healthy tissues, Calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporins, tacrolimus, pimecrolimus), and rapamycin target many types of immunoregulatory cells, including T-cells, and suppress the immune response in organ transplantation and autoimmune disorders.<br><br>
Cyclosporins<br>
The cyclosporins are fungal metabolites that comprise a clasg of cyclic oligopeptides that act as immunosuppressants. Cyclosporine A, and its daitcrated analogue ISAt^247, are hydrophobic cyclic polypeptide consisting of eleven amino acids. Cyclosporine A binds and forms a complex with the intracellular receptor cyclophilin. The cyclosporine/cyclophilin complex binds to and inhibits calcineurin, a Ca  -calmodulin-dependent serine-threonine-specific protein phosphatase. Calcineurin mediates signal transduction events required for T-cell activation (reviewed in Schreiber et ah, Cell 70:365-368, 1 991). Cyclosporins and their functional and structural analogs suppress the T-ccll-dependent immune response by inhibiting antigen-triggered signal transduction. This inhibition decreases the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2.<br>
Many cyclosporines (e.g., cyclosporine A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and I) are produced by fungi. Cyclosporine A is a commercially available under the trade name NEORAL from Novartis. CyclosporineTA structural and functional analogs include cyclosporins having one or more fluorinated amino acids (described, e.g., in U.S. Patent No. 5,227,467); cyclosporines having modified amino acids (described, e.g., in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,122,511 and 4,798,823); and dcu!crated cyclosporines, such as ISAtx247 (described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 20020132763). Additional cyclosporine analogs are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,136,357,4,384,996, 5,284,826, and 5,709,797. Cyclosporine analogs include, but are not limited to, D-Sar (a-SMe)3 Val2-DH-Cs (209-825), Allo-Thr-2-Cs, Norvaline-2-Cs, D-Ala (3-acetylamino)-8-Cs, Thr-2-Cs, and D-MeSer-3-Cs, D-Ser (0-CH2CH2-OH)-8-Cs, and D-Ser~8-Cs, which are described in Cruz et al. (Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 44:143-149.2000).<br>
Cyclosporines are highly hydrophobic and readily precipitate in the presence of water (e.g., on contact with body fluids). Methods of providing cyclosporine formulations with improved bioavailability are described in U.S.<br><br>
Patent Nos. 4,388,307, 6,468,968, 5,051,402, 5,342,625, 5,977,066, and 6,022,852. Cyclosporine microemulsion compositions are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,866,159, 5,916,589, 5,962,014, 5,962,017, 6,007,840, and (..024,978.<br>
Cyclosporins can be administered either intravenously or orally, but oral administration is preferred. To counteract the hydrophobicity of cyclosporine A, an intravenous cyclosporine A is usually provided in an cthanol-polyoxyethylated castor oil vehicle that must be diluted prior to administration. Cyclosporine A may be provided, e.g., as a microemulsion in a 25 mg or 100 mg tablets, or in a^lOO mg/ml oral solution-(NEGRAL™).<br>
Typically, patient dosage of an oral cyclosporine varies according to the patient's condition, but some standard recommended dosages in prior art treatment regimens are provided herein. Patients undergoing organ transplant typically receive an initial dose of oral cyclosporine A in amounts between 12 and 15 mg/kg/day. Dosage is then gradually decreased by 5% per week until a 7-12 mg/kg/day:'maintelfiajice dose is reached. For intravenous administration 2-6 mg/kg/day is preferred for most patients. For patients diagnosed as having Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, dosage amounts-from 6-8 mg/kg/day are generally given. For patients diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus, dosage amounts from 2.2-6.0 mg/kg/day are generally given. For psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis, dosage amounts from 0.5-4 mg/kg/day are typical. Other useful dosages include 0.5-5 mg/kg/day, 5-10 mg/kg/day, 10-15 rnglg day, 15-20 mg/kg/day, or 20-25 mg/kg/day. Often cyclosporines are administered in combination with other immunosuppressive agents, such as glucocorticoids. Additional information is provided in Table 3.<br><br><br>
Tacrolimus<br>
Tacrolimus (PROGRAF, Fujisawa), also known as FK506, is an immunosuppressive agent that targets T-cell intracellular signal transduction pathways. Tacrolimus binds to an intracellular protein FK506 binding protein (FKBP-12) that is not structurally related to cyclophilin (Harding et al. Nature 341:758-7601, 1989; Siekienka et al. Nature 341:755-757,1989; and Soltoff et al., J. Biol. Chem. 267:17472-17477, 1992). The FKBP/FK506 complex binds to calcineurin and inhibits calcineurin's phosphatase activity. This inhibition prevents the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT, a nuclear component that initiates gene transcription required for lymphokine (e.g., IL-2, gamma interferon) production and T-cell activation. Thus, tacrolimus inhibits<br>
T-cell activation.<br>
Tacrolimus is a macrolide antibiotic that is produced by Streptomyces tsukuhuensis. It suppresses the immune system and prolongs the survival of transplanted organs. It is currently available in oral and injectable formulations. Tacrolimus capsules contain 0.5 mg, 1 mg5 or 5 mg of anhydrous<br><br>
tacrolimus within a gelatin capsule shell The injectable formulation contains 5 mg anhydrous tacrolimus in castor oil and alcohol that is diluted with 9% sodium chloride or 5% dextrose prior to injection. While oral administration is preferred, patients unable to take oral capsules may receive injectable tacrolimus. The initial dose should be administered no sooner than six hours after transplant by continuous intravenous infusion.<br>
Tacrolimus and tacrolimus analogs are described by Tanaka et al., (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 109:5031,1987), and in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,894,366, 4.929,611, and 4,956,352. FK506-related compounds, including FR-900520, FR-900523,-and FR-900525, are described in U.S. Patent No. 5*254,562; O-aryl, O-alkyl, Oalkenyl, and Oalkynylmacrolides are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5?250,678? 532,248, 5,693,648; amino O-aryl macrolides are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,262,533; alkylidene macrolides are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,284,840; N-heteroaryl, N-alkylheteroaryl, N~alkenylheteroaryl, and N-alkynylheteroaryl macrolides are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,208,241; aminomacrolides and derivatives thereof are described in U.S. Patent No. 5.208,228; fluoromacrolides are described in U.S. Patent No. 5,189,042; amino O-alkyl, O-alkenyl, and-O-alkynylmacrolides are described in U.S. Patent No. 5.102,334; and halomacrolides are described in U,S. Patent No. 5,143,918.<br>
While suggested dosages will vary with a patient's condition, standard recommended dosages used in prior rt treatment regimens are provided below. Patients diagnosed as having Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis are administered 0.1-0,2 mg/kg/day oral tacrolimus. Patients having a transplanted organ typically receive doses of 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day of oral tacrolimus. Patients being treated for rheumatoid arthritis typically receive 1-3 mg/day oral tacrolimus. For the treatment of psoriasis, 0.01-0.15 mg/kg/day of oral tacrolimus is administered to a patient. Atopic dermatitis can be treated twice a day by applying a cream having 0.03-0.1% tacrolimus to the affected area. Patients receiving oral tacrolimus capsules typically receive the first dose no sooner than six hours after transplant, or eight to twelve hours after intravenous<br><br>
tacrolimus infusion was discontinued. Other suggested tacrolimus dosages include 0.005-0.01 mg/kg/day, 0.01-0.03 mg/kg/day, 0.03-0.05 mg/kg/day, 0.05-0.07 mg/kg/day, 0.07-0.10 mg/kg/day, 0.10-0.25 mg/kg/day, or 0.25-0.5 mg "kg/day.<br>
Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by the mixed-function oxidase system, in particular, by the cytochrome P-450 system. The primary mechanism of metabolism is demethylation and hydroxylation. While various tacrolimus metabolites are likely to exhibit immunosuppressive biological activity, the 13-demethyl metabolite is reported to have the same activity as tacrolimus.<br>
Pimecrolimus and Ascomycin Derivatives<br>
Ascomycin is a close structural analog of FK506 and is a potent immunosuppressant. It binds to FKBP-12 and suppresses its proline rotamase activity. The ascomycin-FKBP complex inhibits calcineurin, a type 2B phosphatase.<br>
Pimecrolimus (also known as SDZ ASM-981) is an 33-epi-chloro derivative of the ascomycin. It is produced by the strain Streptomyces hv^roscopicus var, ascomyceitus. Like tacrolimus, pimecrolimus (ELIDEL    , Novartis) binds FKBP-12, inhibits calcineurin phosphatase activity, and inhibits T-cell activation by blocking the transcription of early cytokines. In particular, pimecrolimus inhibits IL-2 production and the release of other proinflammatory cytokines.<br>
Pimecrolimus structural and functional analogs are described in U.S. Patent No. 6,384,073. Pimecrolimus is particularly useful for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Pimecrolimus is currently available as a 1% cream. While individual dosing will vary with the patient's condition, some standard recommended dosages are provided below. Oral pimecrolimus can be given for the treatment of psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis in amounts of 40-60 mg. day. For the treatment of Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis amounts of<br><br>
SO-160 mg/day pimecrolimus can be given. Patients having an organ transplant can be administered 160-240 mg/day of pimecrolimus. Patients diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythamatosus can be administered 40-120 mg/day of pimecrolimus. Other useful dosages of pimecrolimus include 0.5-5 mg/day, 5-10 mg/day, 10-30 mg/day, 40-80 mg/day, 80-120 mg/day, or even 120-200 mg/day.<br>
Rapamycin<br>
Rapamycin (Rapamune® sirolimus, Wyeth) is a cyclic lactone produced by Steptomyces hygroscopicus. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits T-lymphocyte activation and proliferation. Like cyclosporins, tacrolimus, and pimecrolimus, rapamycin forms a complex with the immunophilin FKBP-12, but the rapamycin-FKBP-12 complex does not inhibit caleineurin phosphatase activity. The rapamycin-immunophilin complex binds 10 and inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that is required for cell xrycle^progression. Inhibition of mTOR kinase activity blocks T-lymphocyte proliferation and lymphokine secretion.<br>
Rapamycin structural and functional analogs include mono- and diacylated rapamycin derivatives (U.S. Patent No. ,4,316,885); rapamycin water-soluble prodrugs (U.S. Patent No. 4,650,803); carbo'xylic acid esters (PCT Publication No. WO 92/05179); carbamates (U.S. Patent No. 5,118,678); amide cs:ers (U.S. Patent No. 5,118,678); biotin esters (U.S. Patent No. 5.504.091); fluorinated esters (U.S. Patent No. 5,100,883); acetals (U.S. Patent No. 5.151,413); silyl ethers (U.S. Patent No. 5,120,842); bicyclic derivatives (U.S. Paient No. 5,120,725); rapamycin dimers (U.S. Patent No. 5,120,727); O-aryl, O-alkyl, O-alkyenyl and Oalkynyl derivatives (U.S. Patent No. 5.258.3S9); and deuterated rapamycin (U.S. Patent No. 6,503,921). Additional rapamycin analogs are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,202,332 and 5,169,851.<br>
Everolimus (40-O«(2-hydroxyethyl)rapamycin; CERTICAN™; No\ ailis) is an immunosuppressive macrolide that is structurally related to<br><br>
rapamycin, and has been found to be particularly effective at preventing acute rejection of organ transplant when give in combination with cyclosporin A. Rapamycin is currently available for oral administration in liquid and tablet formulations. RAPAMUNE™ liquid contains 1 mg/mL rapamycin that    * is diluted in water or orange juice prior to administration. Tablets containing 1 or 2 mg of rapamycin are also available. Rapamycin is preferably given once daily as soon as possible after transplantation. It is absorbed rapidly and completely after oral administration. Typically, patient dosage of rapamycin vanes according to the patient's condition, but some standard recommended dosages are provided below. The initial loading dose for rapamycin is 6 mg. Subsequent maintenance doses of 2 mg/day are typical. Alternatively, a loading dose of 3 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or 25 mg can be used with a 1 nig, 3 mg, 5 mg, 7 mg, or 10 mg per day maintenance dose. In patients weighing less than 40 kg, rapamycin dosages are typically adjusted based on x&gt;dy surface area; generally a 3 mg/m /day loading dose and a 1-mg/m /day maintenance dose is used.<br>
Peptide Moieties<br>
Peptides, peptide mimetics, peptide fragments, either natural, synthetic r chemically modified, that impair the calcineurin-mediated .phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of NFAT are suitable for use in practicing the invention. Examples of peptides that act as calcineurin inhibitors by inhibiting the NFAT activation and the NFAT transcription factor are described, e.g., by Aramburu et al., Science 285:2129-2133, 1999) and Aramburu et al., Mol. Cell 1:627-637,1998). As a class of calcinuerin inhibitors, these agents are useful in the methods of the invention.<br><br>
Administration<br>
In particular embodiments of any of the methods of the invention, the compounds are administered within 10 days of each other, within five days of each other, within twenty-four hours of each other, or simultaneously. The compounds may be formulated together as a single composition, or may be formulated and administered separately. One or both compounds may be administered in a low dosage or in a high dosage, each of which is defined herein. It may be desirable to administer to the patient other compounds, such as a corticosteroid, NSAID (e.g., naproxen sodium, diclofenac sodium, diclofenac potassium, aspirin, -sulindac, diflunisal, piroxicam, indomethacin, ibuprofen, nabumetone, choline magnesium trisalicylate, sodium salicylate, salicylsalicylic acid, fenoprofen, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen, meclofenamate sodium, meloxicam, oxaprozin, sulindac, and tolmetin), COX-2 inhibitor (e.g., rofecoxib, celecoxib, valdecoxib, and lumiracoxib), glucocorticoid receptor modulator, or DMARD. Combination therapies of the invention are especially useful for the treatment of immunoin flamatory disorders in combination with<br>
other .anti-cytokine agents or agents that modulate the immune response to positively effect disease, such as agents that influence cell adhesion, or biologies (i.e., agents that block the action of IL-6, IL-1, IL-2, IL-12, IL-15 or TNFa (e.g., etanefcept, adelimumab, infliximab, or CDP-870). In this example (that of agents blocking the effect of TNFa), the combination therapy reduces the production of cytokines, etanercept or infliximab act on the remaining fraction of inflammatory cytokines, providing enhanced treatment.<br>
Therapy according to the invention may be performed alone or in conjunction with another therapy and may be provided at home, the doctor's office, a clinic, a hospital's outpatient department, or a hospital. Treatment optionally begins at a hospital so that the doctor can observe the therapy's effects closely and make any adjustments that are needed, or it may begin on an outpatient basis. The duration of the therapy depends on the type of disease or disorder being treated, the age and condition of the patient, the stage and type<br><br>
of the patient's disease, and how the patient responds to the treatment. Additionally, a person having a greater risk of developing an inflammatory disease (e.g., a person who is undergoing age-related hormonal changes) may receive treatment to inhibit or delay the onset of symptoms.<br>
Routes of administration for the various embodiments include, but are not limited to, topical, transdermal, and systemic administration (such as, intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, inhalation, rectal, buccal, vaginal, intraperitoneal, intraarticular, ophthalmic or oral administration). As used herein, "systemic administration" refers to all nondermal routes of administration, and specifically excludes topical and transdermal routes of administration.<br>
In combination therapy, the dosage and frequency of administration of each component of the combination can be controlled independently. For example, one compound may be administered three times per day, while the second compound may be administered once per day. Combination therapy may be given in on-and-off cycles that include rest periods so that the patient's body has a chance to recover from any as yet unforeseen side effects. The compounds may also be formulated together such that one administration delivers both compounds.<br>
Formulation of Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
The administration of a combination of the invention may be by any suitable means that results in suppression of proinflammatory cytokine levels at the target region. The compound may be contained in any appropriate amount in any suitable carrier substance, and is generally present in an amount of 1-95% by weight of the total weight of the composition. The composition may be provided in a dosage form that is suitable for the oral, parenteral (e.g., intravenously, intramuscularly), rectal, cutaneous, nasal, vaginal, inhalant, skin (patch), or ocular administration route. Thus, the composition may be in the form of, e.g., tablets, capsules, pills, powders, granulates, suspensions,<br><br>
emulsions, solutions, gels including hydrogels, pastes, ointments, creams, plasters, drenches, osmotic delivery devices, suppositories, enemas, injectables, implants, sprays, or aerosols.   The pharmaceutical compositions may be formulated according to conventional pharmaceutical practice (see, e.g.,<br>
i     Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20th edition, 2000, ed. A.R. Gennaro, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Philadelphia, and Encyclopedia of Pharmaceutical Technology, eds. J. Swarbrick and J. C. Boylan, 1988-1999, Marcel Dekker, New York).<br>
Each compound of the combination may be formulated in a variety of<br>
&gt;     ways that are known in the art. For example, the first and second agents may be formulated together or separately. Desirably, the first and second agents are formulated together for the simultaneous or near simultaneous administration of the agents. Such co-formulated compositions can include the SSRI and the steroid formulated together in the same pill, capsule, liquid, etc. It is to be understood that, when referring to the formulation of "SSRI/steroid '"combinations," the formulation technology employed is also useful for the formulation of the individual agents of the combination, as well as other combinations of the invention (e.g., a SSRI/glucocorticoid receptor modulator combination). By using different formulation strategies for different agents, the pharmacokinetic profiles for each agent can be suitably matched.<br>
The individually or separately formulated agents can be packaged together as a kit. Non-limiting examples include kits that contain, e.g., two pills, a pill and a powder, a suppository and a liquid in a vial, two topical creams, etc. The kit can include optional components that aid in the administration of the unit dose to patients, such as vials for reconstituting powder forms, syringes for injection, customized IV delivery systems, inhalers, etc. Additionally, the unit dose kit can contain instructions for preparation and administration of the compositions. The kit may be.manufactured as a single use unit dose for one patient, multiple uses for a particular patient (at a constant dose or in which the individual compounds may vary in potency as therapy<br><br>
progresses); or the kit may contain multiple doses suitable for administration to multiple patients ("bulk packaging"). The kit components may be assembled in cartons, blister packs, bottles, tubes, and the like.<br>
Controlled Release Formulations<br>
Administration of an SSRI/steroid combination of the invention in which one or both of the active agents is formulated for controlled release is useful where the SSRI or the steroid, has (i) a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., the difference between the plasma concentration leading to harmful side effects or toxic reactions and the plasma concentration leading to a therapeutic effect is small; generally, the therapeutic index, TI, is defined as the ratio of median lethal dose (LD50) to median effective dose (ED50)); (ii) a narrow absorption window in the gastro-intestinal tract; (iii) a short biological half-life; or (iv) the pharmacokinetic profile of each component must be modified to maximize the contribution of each agent, when used together, to an amount of that is therapeutically effective for cytokine suppression. Accordingly, a sustained release formulation may be used to avoid frequent dosing that may be required in order to sustain the plasma levels of both agents at a therapeutic level. For example, in preferable oral pharmaceutical compositions of the invention, half-life and mean residency times from 10 to 20 hours for one or both agents of the combination of the invention are observed.<br>
Many strategies can be pursued to obtain controlled release in which the rate of release outweighs the rate of metabolism of the therapeutic compound. For example, controlled release can be obtained by the appropriate selection of formulation parameters and ingredients (e.g., appropriate controlled release compositions and coatings). Examples include single or multiple unit tablet or capsule compositions, oil solutions, suspensions, emulsions, microcapsules, microspheres, nanoparticles, patches, and liposomes. The release mechanism can be controlled such that the SSRI and/or steroid are released at period intervals, the release could be simultaneous, or a delayed release of one of the<br><br>
agents of the combination can be affected, when the early release of one particular agent is preferred over the other.<br>
Controlled release formulations may include a degradable or nondegradable polymer, hydrogel, organogel, or other physical construct that modifies the bioabsorption, half-life or biodegradation of the agent. The controlled release formulation can be a material that is painted or otherwise applied onto the afflicted site, either internally or externally. In one example, the invention provides a biodegradable bolus or implant that is surgically inserted at or near a site of interest (for example, proximal to an arthritic joint). In another example, the controlled release formulation implant can be inserted into an organ, such as in the lower intestine for the treatment inflammatory bowel disease.<br>
Hydrogels can be used in controlled release formulations for the SSRI/steroid combinations of the present invention. Such polymers are formed from macromers with a polymerizable, non-degradable, region that is separated "by at least one degfadable region. For example, the water soluble, non¬degradable, region can form the central core of the macromer and have at least two degradable regions which are attached to the core, such that upon degradation, the non-degradable regions (in particular a polymerized gel) are separated, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,626,863. Hydrogels can include acrylates. which can be readily polymerized by several initiating systems such as eosin dye, ultraviolet or visible light. Hydrogels can also include polyethylene glycols (PEGs), which are highly hydrophilic and biocompatible. Hydrogels can also include oligoglycolic acid, which is a poly(a-hydroxy acid) that can be readily degraded by hydrolysis of the ester linkage into glycolic acid, a nontoxic metabolite. Other chain extensions can include polylactic acid, polycaprolactone, polyorthoesters, polyanhydrides or polypeptides. The entire network can be gelled into a biodegradable network that can be used to entrap and homogeneously disperse SSRI/steroid combinations of the invention for delivery at a controlled rate.<br><br>
Chitosan and mixtures of chitosan with carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) have been used as vehicles for the sustained release of drugs, as described by Inouye et al., Drug Design and Delivery 1: 297-305, 1987. Mixtures of these compounds and agents of the SSRI/steroid combinations of the invention, when compressed under 200 kg/cm , form a tablet from which the active agent is slowly released upon administration to a subject. The release profile can be changed by varying the ratios of chitosan, CMC-Na, and active agent(s). The tablets can also contain other additives, including lactose, CaHP04 dihydrate, sucrose, crystalline cellulose, or croscarmellose sodium. Several examples are given in Table 4.<br><br>
Baichwal, in U.S. Patent No. 6,245,356, describes a sustained release oral solid dosage forms that includes agglomerated particles of a therapeutically active medicament (for example, an SSRI/steroid combination or component thereof of the present invention) in amorphous form, a gelling agent, an ionizable gel strength enhancing agent and an inert diluent. The gelling agent can be a mixture of a xanthan gum and a locust bean gum capable<br><br>
of cross-linking with the xanthan gum when the gums are exposed to an environmental fluid. Preferably, the ionizable gel enhancing agent acts to enhance the strength of cross-linking between the xanthan gum and the locust bean gum and thereby prolonging the release of the medicament component of the formulation. In addition to xanthan gum and locust bean gum, acceptable gelling agents that may also be used include those gelling agents well-known in the art. Examples include naturally occurring or modified naturally occurring gums such as alginates, carrageenan, pectin, guar gum, modified starch, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, methylcellulose, and other cellulosic materials or polymers, such as, for example, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and hydroxypropyl cellulose, and mixtures of the foregoing.<br>
In another formulation useful for the combinations of the invention, Baichwal and Staniforth in U.S. Patent No. 5,135,757 describe a free-flowing slow release granulation for use as a pharmaceutical excipient that includes from about 20 to about 70 percent or more by weight of a hydrophilic material that includes a heteropolysaccharide (such as, for example, xanthan gum or a derivative thereof) and a polysaccharide material capable of cross-linking the heteropolysaccharide (such as, for example, galactomannans, and most preferably locust bean gum) in the presence of aqueous solutions, and from about 30 to about 80 percent by weight of an inert pharmaceutical filler (such as, for example, lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol, xylitol, fructose or mixtures thereof). After mixing the excipient with an SSRI/steroid combination, or combination agent, of the invention, the mixture is directly compressed into solid dosage forms such as tablets. The tablets thus formed slowly release the medicament when ingested and exposed to gastric fluids. By varying the amount of excipient relative to the medicament, a slow release profile can be attained.<br>
In another formulation useful for the combinations of the invention, Shell, in U.S. Patent No. 5,007,790, describe sustained-release oral drug-dosage forms that release a drug in solution at a rate controlled by the solubility<br><br>
of the drug. The dosage form comprises a tablet or capsule that includes a plurality of particles of a dispersion of a limited solubility drug (such as, for example, prednisolone, paroxetine, or any other agent of the SSRI/steroid combination of the present invention) in a hydrophilic, water-swellable,, crosslinked polymer that maintains its physical integrity over the dosing lifetime but thereafter rapidly dissolves. Once ingested, the particles swell to promote gastric retention and permit the gastric fluid to penetrate the particles, dissolve drug and leach it from the particles, assuring that drug reaches the stomach in the solution state which is less injurious to the stomach than solid¬-state drug. The programmed eventual dissolution of the polymer depends upon the nature of the polymer and the degree of crosslinking. The polymer is nonfibrillar and substantially water soluble in its uncrosslinked state, and the degree of crosslinking is sufficient to enable the polymer to remain insoluble for the desired time period, normally at least from about 4 hours to 8 hours up to 12 hours, with the choice depending upon the drug incorporated and the medical treatment involved. Examples of suitable crosslinked polymers that may be used in the invention are gelatin, albumin, sodium alginate, carboxymethyl cellulose, polyvinyl alcohol, and chitin. Depending upon the polymer, crosslinking may be achieved by thermal or radiation treatment or through the use of crosslinking agents such as aldehydes, polyamino acids, metal ions and the like.<br>
Silicone microspheres forpH-controlled gastrointestinal drug delivery that are useful in the formulation of the SSRI/steroid combinations of the invention have been described by Carelli et al., Int. J. Pharmaceutics 179: 73-83, 1999. The microspheres so described are pH-sensitive semi-interpenetrating polymer hydrogels made of varying proportions of poly(meihacrylic acid-co-methylmethacrylate) (Eudragit LI 00 or Eudragit SI00) and crosslinked polyethylene glycol 8000 that are encapsulated into silicone microspheres in the 500 to 1000 μm size range.<br><br>
Slow-release formulations can include a coating which is not readily water-soluble but which is slowly attacked and removed by water, or through which water can slowly permeate. Thus, for example, the SSRI/steroid combinations of the invention can be spray-coated with a solution of a binder under continuously fluidizing conditions, such as describe by Kitamori et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,036,948. Examples of water-soluble binders include pregelatinized starch (e.g., pregelatinized cornstarch, pregelatinized white potato starch), pregelatinized modified starch, water-soluble celluloses (e.g. hydroxypropyl-cellulose, hydroxymethyl-cellulose, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose, carboxymethyl-cellulose), polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, dextrin, gum arabicum and gelatin, organic solvent-soluble binders, such as cellulose derivatives (e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate, ethylcellulose).<br>
Combinations of the invention, or a component thereof, with sustained release properties can also be formulated by spray drying techniques. In one example, as described by Espositio et al., Pharm. Dev. TechnoL 5: 267-78, 2000, prednisolone was encapsulated in methyacrylate microparticles (Eudragit RS) using a Mini Spray Dryer, model 190 (Buchi, Laboratorium Technik AG, Flawil, Germany). Optimal conditions for microparticle formation were found to be a feed (pump) rate of 0.5 mL/min of a solution containing 50 mg prednisolone in 10 mL of acetonitrile, a flow rate of nebulized air of 600 L/hr, dry air temperature heating at 80°C, and a flow rate of aspirated drying air of 28 m3/hr.<br>
Yet another form of sustained release SSRI/steroid combinations can be prepared by microencapsulation of combination agent particles in membranes which aci as microdialysis cells. In such a formulation, gastric fluid permeates the microcapsule walls and swells the microcapsule, allowing the active agent(s) xo dialyze out (see, for example, Tsuei et a]., U.S. Patent No. 5,589,194). One commercially available sustained-release system of this kind consists of microcapsules having membranes of acacia gum/gelatine/ethyl<br><br>
alcohol. This product is available from Eurand Limited (France) under the trade name Diffucaps™. Microcapsules so formulated might be carried in a conventional gelatine capsule or tabletted.<br>
Extended- and/or controlled-release formulations of both SSRIs and corticosteroids are known. For example, Paxil CR®, commercially available from GlaxoSmithKline, is an extended release form of paroxetine hydrochloride in a degradable polymeric matrix (GEOMATRIX™, see also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,839,177, 5,102,666, and 5,422,123), which also has an enteric coat to delay the start of drug release until after the tablets have passed through the stomach. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,102,666 describes a polymeric controlled release composition comprising a reaction complex formed by the interaction of (1) a calcium polycarbophil component which is a water-swellable, but water insoluble, fibrous cross-linked carboxy-functional polymer, the polymer containing (a) a plurality of repeating units of which at least about 80% contain at least one carboxyl functionality, and (b) about 0.05 to about 1.5% cross-linking agent substantially free from polyalkenyl polyether, the percentages being based upon the weights of unpolymerised repeating unit and cross-linking agent, respectively, with (2) water, in the presence of an active agent selected from the group consisting of SSRIs such as paroxetine. The amount of calcium polycarbophil present is from about 0.1 to about 99% by weight, for example about 10%. The amount of active agent present is from about 0.0001 to about 65% by weight, for example between about 5 and 20%. The amount of water present is from about 5 to about 200% by weight, for example between about 5 and 10%. The interaction is carried out at a pH of between about 3 and about 10, for example about 6 to 7. The calcium polycarbophil is originally present in the form of a calcium salt containing from about 5 to about 25% calcium.<br>
Other extended-release formulation examples are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,422,123. Thus, a system for the controlled release of an active substance which is an SSRI such as paroxetine, comprising (a) a deposit-core comprising<br><br>
an effective amount of the active substance and having defined geometric form, and (b) a support-plafform applied to the deposit-core, wherein the deposit-core contains at least the active substance, and at least one member selected from the group consisting of (1) a polymeric material which swells on contact with water or aqueous liquids and a gellable polymeric material wherein the ratio of the swellable polymeric material to the gellable polymeric material is in the range 1:9 to 9:1, and (2) a single polymeric material having both swelling and gelling properties, and wherein the support-platform is an elastic support, applied to said deposit-core so that it partially covers the surface of the deposit-core and follows changes due to hydration of the deposit-core and is slowly soluble and/or slowly gellable in aqueous fluids. The support-platform may comprise polymers such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, plasticizers such as a glyceride, binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydrophilic agents such as lactose and silica, and/or hydrophobic agents such as magnesium stearate and glycerides. The polymer(s) typically make up 30 to 90% by weight of the support-platform, for example about 35 to 40%. Plasticizer may make up at least 2% by weight of the support-platform, for example about 15 to 20%. Binder(s), hydrophilic agent(s) and hydrophobic agent(s) typically total up to about 50° o by weight of the support-platform, for example about 40 to 50%. In another example, an extended-release formulation for venlafaxine (Effexor XR®* is commercially available from Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. This formulation includes venlafaxine hydrochloride, microcrystalline cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, coated with a mixture of ethyl cellulose and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,403,120 and 6,419,958). A controlled-release formulation of budesonide (3 mg capsules) for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is available from AstraZeneca (sold as "Entocort™"). A sustained-release formulation useful for corticosteroids is also described in U.S. Patent No. 5,792,476, where the formulation includes 2.5-7 mg of a glucocorticoid as active substance with a regulated sustained-release such that at least 90% by weight of the glucocorticoid is released during<br><br>
a period of about 40-80 min, starting about 1-3 h after the entry of said glucocorticoid into the small intestine of the patient. To make these low dose levels of active substance possible, the active substance, i.e. the glucocorticoid, such as prednisolone or prednisone, is micronised, suitably mixed with known diluents, such as starch and lactose, and granulated with PVP (polyvinylpyrrolidone). Further, the granulate is laminated with a sustained release inner layer resistant to a pH of 6.8 and a sustained release outer layer resistant to a pH of 1.0. The inner layer is made of Eudragit®RL (copolymer of acrylic and methacrylic esters with a low content of quaternary ammonium groups) and the outer layer is made of Eudragit®L (anionic polymer synthesized from methacrylic acid and methacrylic acid methyl ester).<br>
A bilayer tablet can be formulated for an SSRI/steroid combination of the invention in which different custom granulations are made for each agent of the combination and the two agents are compressed on a bi-layer press to form a single tablet. For example, 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 37.5 mg, or 50 mg of paroxetine, formulated for a controlled release that results in a paroxetine t\ 2 of 15 to 20 hours may be combined in the same tablet with 3 mg of predinisolone, which is formulated such that the t\/2 approximates that of paroxetine. Examples of paroxetine extended-release formulations, including those used in bilayer taBlets, can be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,548,084.   In addition lo controlling the rate of predsnisolone release in vivo , an enteric or delayed release coat may be included that delays the start of drug release such that the Tmax of predsnisolone approximate that of paroxetine (i.e. 5 to 10 hours).<br>
Cyclodextrins are cyclic polysaccharides containing naturally occurring D(+)-glucopyranose units in an a-(l,4) linkage. Alpha-, beta- and gamma-cyclodexirins, which contain, respectively, six, seven or eight glucopyranose units, are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in W091/11172, WO94/02518 and W098/55148. Structurally, the cyclic nature of a cyclodextrin forms a torus or donut-like shape having an inner apolar or hydrophobic cavity, the secondary hydroxyl groups situated on one side of the<br><br>
cyclodextrin torus and the primary hydroxyl groups situated on the other. The side on which the secondary hydroxyl groups are located has a wider diameter than the side on which the primary hydroxyl groups are located. The hydrophobic nature of the cyclodextrin inner cavity allows for the inclusion of a variety of compounds. (Comprehensive Supramolecular Chemistry, Volume 3, J. L. Atwood et al, eds., Pergamon Press (1996); Cserhati, Analytical Biochemistry 225: 328-32, 1995; Husain et al., Applied Spectroscopy 46: 652-8, 1992. Cyclodextrins have been used as a delivery vehicle of various therapeutic compounds by forming inclusion complexes with various drugs that can fit into the hydrophobic cavity of the cyclodextrin or by forming non-covalent association complexes with other biologically active molecules. U.S. Pat. No. 4.727,064 describes pharmaceutical preparations consisting of a drug with substantially low water solubility and an amorphous, water-soluble cyclodextrin-based mixture in which the drug forms an inclusion complex with the cyclodextrins of the mixture.<br>
Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex can modify the drug's solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability, and/or stability properties. For example, cyclodextrins have been described for improving the bioavailability of prednisolone, as described by Uekama et al., J. Pharm Dyn. 6: 124-7, 1983. A p-cyclodextrin/prednisolone complex can be prepared by adding both components to water and stirring at 25°C for 7 days. The resultant precipitate recovered is a 1:2 prednisolone/cyclodextrin complex.<br>
Sulfobutylether-P-cyclodextrin (SBE-p-CD, commercially available from CyDex, Inc, Overland Park, KA, USA and sold as CAPTISOL®) can also be used as an aid in the preparation of sustained-release formulations of agents of the combinations of the present invention. For example, a sustained-release tablet has been prepared that includes prednisolone and SBE-p-CD compressed in a hydroxypropyl methylcellulose matrix (see Rao et al., J. Pharm. Sci. 90: 807-16, 2001). In another example of the use of various cyclodextrins, EP 1109806 Bl describes cyclodextrin complexes of paroxetine, where a-, y-, or<br><br>
P-cyclodextrins [including eptakis(2-6-di-0-methyl)-P-cyclodextrin, (2,3,6-tri-<br>
0-methyl)-P-cyclodextrin, monosuccinyl eptakis(2,6-di-0-methyl)-P-<br>
cyclodextrin, or 2-hydroxypropyl-P-cyclodextrin] in anhydrous or hydrated form formed complex ratios of agent to cyclodextrin of from 1:0.25 to 1:20 can be obtained.<br>
Polymeric cyclodextrins have also been prepared, as described in U.S. Patent Application Serial Nos. 10/021,294 and 10/021,312. The cyclodextrin polymers so formed can be useful for formulating agents of the combinations of the present invention. These multifunctional polymeric cyclodextrins are commercially available from Insert Therapeutics, Inc., Pasadena, CA, USA.<br>
As an alternative to direct complexation with agents, cyclodextrins may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Formulations that include cyclodextrins and other agents of the combinations of the present invention (i.e., SSRIs and/or steroids) can be prepared by methods similar to the preparations of the cyclodextrin formulations described herein.<br>
Liposomal Formulations<br>
One or both components of the SSRI/steroid combinations of the invention, or mixtures of the two components together, can be incorporated into liposomal carriers for administration. The liposomal carriers are composed of three general types of vesicle-forming lipid components. The first includes vesicle-forming lipids which will form the bulk of the vesicle structure in the liposome. Generally, these vesicle-forming lipids include any amphipathic lipids having hydrophobic and polar head group moieties, and   * which (a) can form spontaneously into bilayer vesicles in water, as exemplified by phospholipids, or (b) are stably incorporated into lipid bilayers, with its hydrophobic moiety in contact with the interior, hydrophobic region of the bilayer membrane, and its polar head group moiety oriented toward the exterior, polar surface of the membrane.<br><br>
The vesicle-forming lipids of this type are preferably ones having two hydrocarbon chains, typically acyl chains, and a polar head group. Included in this class are the phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), PE, phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and sphingomyelin (SM), where the two hydrocarbon chains are typically between about 14-22 carbon atoms in length, and have varying degrees of unsaturation. The above-described lipids and phospholipids whose acyl chains have a variety of degrees of saturation can be obtained commercially, or prepared according to published methods. Other lipids that can be included in the invention are glycolipids and sterols, such as cholesterol.<br>
The second general component includes a vesicle-forming lipid which is derivatized with a polymer chain which will form the polymer layer in the composition. The vesicle-forming lipids which can be used as the second general vesicle-forming lipid component are any of those described for the first general vesicle-forming lipid component. Vesicle forming lipids with diacyl chains, such as phospholipids, are preferred. One exemplary phospholipid is phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which provides a reactive amino group which is convenient for coupling to the activated polymers. An exemplary PE is distearyl PE (DSPE).<br>
The p'reTerred polymer in the derivatized lipid, is polyethyleneglycol (PEG), preferably a PEG chain having a molecular weight between 1,000-15,000 daltons, more preferably between 2,000 and 10,000 daltons, most preferably between 2,000 and 5,000 daltons. Other hydrophilic polymers which may be suitable include polyvinylpyrrolidone, polymethyloxazoline, polyethyloxazoline, polyhydroxypropyl methacrylamide, polymethacrylamide and polydimethylacrylamide, polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, and derivatized celluloses, such as hydroxymethylcellulose or hydroxyethylcellulose.<br>
Additionally, block copolymers or random copolymers of these polymers, particularly including PEG segments, may be suitable. Methods for<br><br>
preparing lipids derivatized with hydrophilic polymers, such as PEG, are well known e.g., as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,013,556.<br>
A third general vesicle-forming lipid component, which is optional, is a lipid anchor by which a targeting moiety is anchored to the liposome, through a polymer chain in the anchor. Additionally, the targeting group is positioned at the distal end of the polymer chain in such a way so that the biological activity of the targeting moiety is not lost. The lipid anchor has a hydrophobic moiety which serves to anchor the lipid in the outer layer of the liposome bilayer surface, a polar head group to which the interior end of the polymer is covalently attached,.and.a free (exterior) polymer end which is or can be activated for covalent coupling to the targeting moiety. Methods for preparing lipid anchor molecules of this type are described below.<br>
The lipids components used in forming the liposomes are preferably present in a molar ratio of about 70-90 percent vesicle forming lipids, 1-25 percent polymer derivatized lipid, and 0.1-5 percent lipid anchor. One exemplary formulation includes 50-70 mole percent underivatized PE, 20-40 mole percent cholesterol, 0.1-1 mole percent of a PE-PEG (3500) polymer with a chemically reactive group at its free end for coupling to a targeting moiety, 5-10 mole percent PE derivatized with PEG 3500 polymer chains, and 1 mole percent alpha-tocopherol.<br>
The liposomes are preferably prepared to have substantially homogeneous sizes in a selected size range, typically between about 0.03 to 0.5 microns. One effective sizing method for REVs and MLVs involves extruding an aqueous suspension of the liposomes through a series of polycarbonate membranes having a selected uniform'pore size in the range of 0.03 to 0.2 micron, typically 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, or 0.2 microns. The pore size of the membrane corresponds roughly to the largest sizes of liposomes produced by extrusion through that membrane, particularly where the preparation is extruded nvo or more times through the same membrane. Homogenization methods are also useful for down-sizing liposomes to sizes of 100 nm or less.<br><br>
