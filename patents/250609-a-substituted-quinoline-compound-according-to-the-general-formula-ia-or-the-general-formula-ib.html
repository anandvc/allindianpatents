				<td>The present invention relates to novel substituted quinoline derivatives useful for the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.), M. bovis, M. avium andM. marinum.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), a serious and potentially fatal infection with a world-wide distribution. Estimates torn the World Health Organization indicate that more than 8 million people contract TB each year, and 2 million people die from tuberculosis yearly. In the last decade, TB cases have grown 20% worldwide with the highest burden in the most impoverished communities. If these trends continue, TB incidence will increase by 41% in the next twenty years. Fifty years since the introduction of an effective chemotherapy, TB remains after AIDS, the leading infectious cause of adult mortality in the world. Complicating the TB epidemic is the rising tide of multi-drug- resistant strains, and the deadly symbiosis with HIV. People who are HIV-positive and infected with TB are 30 times more likely to develop active TB than people who are HIV-negative and TB is responsible for the death of one out of every three people with HIV/AIDS worldwide.<br>
Existing approaches to treatment of tuberculosis all involve the combination of multiple agents. For example, the regimen recommended by the U.S. Public Health Service is a combination of isoniazid, rifempicin and pyrazinamide for two months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin alone for a further four months. These drugs are continued for a further seven months in patients infected with HIV. For patients infected with multidrug resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, agents such as ethambutol, streptomycin, kanamycin, amikacin, capreomycin, ethionamide, cycloserine, ciprofoxacin and ofloxacin are added to the combination therapies. There exists no single agent that is effective in the clinical treatment of tuberculosis, nor any combination of agents that offers the possibility of therapy of less than six months' duration.<br>
There is a high medical need for new drugs that improve current treatment by enabling regimens that facilitate patient and provider compliance. Shorter regimens and those that require less supeivision are the best way to achieve this. Most of the benefit from treatment comes in the first 2 months, during the intensive, or bactericidal, phase when four drugs are given together; the bacterial burden is greatly reduced, and patients become noninfectious. The 4- to 6-month continuation, or sterilizing, phase is required to eliminate persisting bacilli and to minimize the risk of relapse. A potent sterilizing drug that shortens treatment to 2 months or less would be extremely beneficial. Drugs that facilitate compliance by requiring less intensive supervision also are needed. Obviously, a compound that reduces both the total length of treatment and the frequency of drug administration would provide the greatest benefit<br>
Complicating the TB epidemic is the increasing incidence of multi-drug- resistant strains or MDR-TB. Up to four percent of all cases worldwide are considered MDR-TB - those resistant to the most effective drugs of the four-drug standard, isoniazid and rifarmpin. MDR-TB is lelhal when untreated and can not be adequately treated through the standard therapy, so treatment requires up to 2 years of "second-line" drugs. These drugs are often toxic, expensive and marginally effective. In the absence of an effective therapy, infectious MDR-TB patients continue to spread the disease, producing new infections with MDR-TB strains. There is a high medical need for a new drug with a new mechanism of action, which is likely to demonstrate activity against MDR strains.<br>
The term "drug resistant" as used hereinbefore or hereinafter is a term well understood by the person skilled in microbiology. A drug resistant Mycobacterium is a Mycobacterium which is no longer susceptible to at least one previously effective drug; which has developed the ability to withstand antibiotic attack by at least one previously effective drug. A drug resistant strain may relay that ability to withstand to its progeny. Said resistance may be due to random genetic mutations in the bacterial cell that alters its sensitivity to a single drug or to different drugs.<br>
MDR tuberculosis is a specific form of drug resistant tuberculosis due to a bacterium resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin (with or without resistance to other drugs), which are at present the two most powerful anti-TB drugs.<br>
The purpose of the present invention is to provide novel compounds, in particular substituted quinoline derivatives, having the property of inhibiting growth of Mycobacteria including drug resistant or multi drug resistant Mycobacteria, and therefore useful for the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. avium, M. smegmatis andM. marinum.<br><br>
Substituted quinoUnes were already disclosed in US 5,965,572 (The United States of America) for treating antibiotic resistant infections and in WO 00/34265 to inhibit the growth of bacterial microorganisms. WO 2004/011436 describes quinoline derivatives as antimycobacterial agents.<br>

The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are defined to comprise the therapeutically active non-toxic acid addition salt forms which the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) are able to form. Said acid addition salts can be obtained by treating the base form of the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) with appropriate acids, for example inorganic acids, for example hydrohalic acid, in particular hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid; organic acids, for example acetic acid, hydroxyacetic acid, propanoic acid, lactic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, cyclamic acid, salicyclic acid, p-aminosalicylic acid and pamoic acid<br>
The compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) containing acidic protons may also be converted into their therapeutically active non-toxic base addition salt forms by treatment with appropriate organic and inorganic bases. Appropriate base salts forms comprise, for example, the ammonium salts, the alkaline and earth alkaline metal salts, in particular lithium, sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium salts, salts with organic bases, e.g. the benzathine, #-methyl-D-glucamine, hybramine salts, and salts with amino acids, for example arginine and lysine.<br>
Conversely, said acid or base addition salt forms can be converted into the free forms by treatment with an appropriate base or acid.<br>
The term addition salt as used in the framework of this application also comprises the solvates which the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) as well as the<br><br>
salts thereof, are able to form. Such solvates are, for example, hydrates and alcoholates.<br>
The term "quaternary amine" as used hereinbefore defines the quaternary ammonium salts which the compounds of formula (la) or (Ib) are able to form by reaction between a basic nitrogen of a compound of formula (la) or (Ib) and an appropriate quaternizing agent, such as, for example, an optionally substituted alkylhalide, arylhalide or arylalkylhalide, e.g. melhyliodide or benzyliodide. Other reactants with good leaving groups may also be used, such as alkyl trifluoromethanesulfonates, alkyl methanesulfonates, and alkyl p-toluenesulfonates. A quaternary amine has a positively charged nitrogen. Pharmaceutically acceptable counterions include chloro, bromo, iodo, trifluoroacetate and acetate. The counterion of choice can be introduced using ion exchange resins.<br>
The term "stereochemically isomeric forms" as used herein defines all possible isomeric forms which the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) may possess. Unless otherwise mentioned or indicated, the chemical designation of compounds denotes the mixture of all possible stereochemically isomeric forms, said mixtures containing all diastereomers and enantiomers of the basic molecular structure . More in particular, stereogenic centers may have the R- or S-configuration; substituents on bivalent cyclic (partially) saturated radicals may have either the cis- or trans-configuration. Stereochemically isomeric forms of the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) are obviously intended to be embraced within the scope of this invention.<br>
Following CAS-nomenclature conventions, when two stereogenic centers of known absolute configuration are present in a molecule, an R or S descriptor is assigned (based on Cahn-Ingold-Prelog sequence rule) to the lowest-numbered chiral center, the reference center. The configuration of the second stereogenic center is indicated using relative descriptors or, where R* is always specified as the reference center and indicates centers with the same chirality and indicates centers of unlike chirality. For example, if the lowest-numbered chiral center in the molecule has an S configuration and the second center is /?, the stereo descriptor would be specified as S-[R *,S*]. If "a" and "/3" are used: the position of the highest priority substituent on the asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system having the lowest ring number, is arbitrarily always in the "a" position of the mean plane determined by the ring system. The position of the highest priority substituent on the other asymmetric carbon atom in the ring system relative to the position of the highest priority substituent<br><br>
on the reference atom is denominated "a", if it is on the same side of the mean plane determined by the ring system, or "/3", if it is on the other side of the mean plane determined by the ring system.<br>
Compounds of either Formula (la) and (Ib) and some of the intermediate compounds invariably have at least one stereogenic centers in their structure which may lead to at least 2 stereochemically different structures.<br>
The compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) as prepared in the processes described below may be synthesized in the form of racemic mixtures of enantiomers which can be separated from one another following art-known resolution procedures. The racemic compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) may be converted into the corresponding diastereomeric salt forms by reaction with a suitable chiral acid. Said diastereomeric salt forms are subsequently separated, for example, by selective or fractional crystallization and the enantiomers are liberated therefrom by alkali. An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) involves liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase. Said pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be derived from the corresponding pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate starting materials, provided that the reaction occurs stereospecifically. Preferably if a specific stereoisomer is desired, said compound will be synthesized by stereospecific methods of preparation. These methods will advantageously employ enantiomerically pure starting materials.<br>
The tautomeric forms of the compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) are meant to comprise those compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) wherein e.g. an enol group is converted into a keto group (keto-enol tautomerism).<br>
The N-oxide forms of the compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib) are meant to comprise those compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) wherein one or several nitrogen atoms are oxidized to the so-called N-oxide, particularly those .N-oxides wherein the nitrogen of the amine radical is oxidized.<br>
The invention also comprises derivative compounds (usually called "pro-drugs") of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention, which are degraded in vivo to yield the compounds according to the invention. Pro-drugs are usually (but not always) of lower potency at the target receptor than the compounds to which they are degraded. Pro-drugs are particularly useful when the desired compound has chemical<br><br>
or physical properties that make its administration difficult or inefficient For example, the desired compound may be only poorly soluble, it may be poorly transported across the mucosal epithelium, or it may have an undesirably short plasma half-life. Further discussion on pro-drugs may be found in Stella, V. J. et al, "Prodrugs", Drug Delivery Systems, 1985, pp. 112-176, and Drugs, 1985,29, pp. 455-473.<br>
Pro-drugs forms of the pharmacologically-active compounds according to the invention will generally be compounds according to either Formula (la) or (Ib), the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide forms thereof, having an acid group which is esterified or amidated. Included in such esterified acid groups are groups of the formula -COOR, where R is a C1alky!, phenyl, benzyl or one of the following groups :<br>
Amidated groups include groups of the formula - CONRHl2, wherein Ry is H, Ci^alkyl, phenyl or benzyl and Rz is -OH, H, Ci-^alkyl, phenyl or benzyl.<br>

The compounds according to the invention have surprisingly been shown to be suitable for the treatment of mycobacterial diseases, particularly those diseases caused by pathogenic mycobacteria, including drug resistant and multi drug resistant mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. bovis, M. avium, M. smegmatis andM. marinum. The present invention thus also relates to compounds of either Formula (la) or (Ib) as defined hereinabove, the pharmaceutically acceptable acid or base addition salts thereof, the stereochemically isomeric forms thereof, the tautomeric forms thereof and the N-oxide forms thereof, for use as a medicine.<br>
The invention also relates to a composition comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and, as active ingredient, a therapeutically effective amount of a compound<br><br>
according to the invention. The compounds according to the invention may be formulated into various pharmaceutical forms for administration purposes. As appropriate compositions there may be cited all compositions usually employed for systemically administering drugs. To prepare the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, an effective amount of the particular compound, optionally in addition salt form, as the active ingredient is combined in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration. These pharmaceutical compositions are desirable in unitary dosage form suitable, in particular, for administration orally or by parenteral injection. For example, in preparing the compositions in oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations such as suspensions, syrups, elixirs, emulsions and solutions; or solid carriers such as starches, sugars, kaolin, diluents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of powders, pills, capsules and tablets. Because of their ease in administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit forms in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. For parenteral compositions, the carrier will usually comprise sterile water, at least in large part, though other ingredients, for example, to aid solubility, may be included. Injectable solutions, for example, may be prepared in which the carrier comprises saline solution, glucose solution or a mixture of saline and glucose solution. Injectable suspensions may also be prepared in which case appropriate liquid carriers, suspending agents and the like may be employed. Also included are solid form preparations which are intended to be converted, shortly before use, to liquid form preparations.<br>
Depending on the mode of administration, the pharmaceutical composition will preferably comprise from 0.05 to 99 % by weight, more preferably from 0.1 to 70 % by weight of the active ingredient of formula (la) or (Ib), and, from 1 to 99.95 % by weight, more preferably from 30 to 99.9 weight % of a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, all percentages being based on the total composition.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition may additionally contain various other ingredients known in the art, for example, a lubricant, stabilising agent, buffering agent, emulsifying agent, viscosity-regulating agent, surfactant, preservative, flavouring or colorant.<br><br>
It is especially advantageous to formulate the aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions in unit dosage form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Unit dosage form as used herein refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active ingredient calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required pharmaceutical carrier. Examples of such unit dosage forms are tablets (including scored or coated tablets), capsules, pills, powder packets, wafers, suppositories, injectable solutions or suspensions and the like, and segregated multiples thereof. The daily dosage of the compound according to the invention will, of course, vary with the compound employed, me mode of administration, the treatment desired and the mycobacterial disease indicated. However, in general, satisfactory results will be obtained when the compound according to the invention is administered at a daily dosage not exceeding Igram, e.g. in the range from 10 to 50 mg/kg body weight.<br>

Pure stereochemically isomeric forms may also be obtained from the pure stereochemically isomeric forms of the appropriate intermediates and starting materials, provided that the intervening reactions occur stereospecifically.<br><br>
An alternative manner of separating the enantiomeric forms of the compounds of formula (I) and intermediates involves liquid chromatography, in particular liquid chromatography using a chiral stationary phase.<br>

D. Pharmacological examples<br>
D.I. In-vitro method for testing compounds against M. tuberculosis. Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 100 ul of Middlebrook (Ix) broth medium. Subsequently, stock solutions (10 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 25 ul volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial fivefold dilutions were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp., Hopkinton, MA). Pipette tips were changed after every 3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobic compounds. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Approximately 5000 CPU per well of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37RV), in a volume of 100 ul in Middlebrook (Ix) broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 7 days in a humidified atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). One day before the end of incubation, 6 days after inoculation, Resazurin (1:5) was added to all wells in a volume of 20 ul and<br><br>
plates were incubated for another 24 hours at 37°C. On day 7 the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically.<br>
The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Spectramax Gemini EM, Molecular Devices) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm. The percentage growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods, and MIC data (representing IC90's expressed in microgram/ml) were calculated.<br>
D.2. In-vitro method for testing compounds for anti-bacterial activity against strain M. Smegmatis ATCC607.<br>
Flat-bottom, sterile 96-well plastic microtiter plates were filled with 180 ul of sterile deionized water, supplemented with 0.25 % BSA. Subsequently, stock solutions (7.8 x final test concentration) of compounds were added in 45 ul volumes to a series of duplicate wells in column 2 so as to allow evaluation of their effects on bacterial growth. Serial five-fold dilutions (45 ul in 180 ul) were made directly in the microtiter plates from column 2 to 11 using a customised robot system (Zymark Corp., Hopktnton, MA). Pipette tips were changed after every 3 dilutions to minimize pipetting errors with high hydrophobia compounds. Untreated control samples with (column 1) and without (column 12) inoculum were included in each microtiter plate. Approximately, 250 CFU per well of bacteria inoculum, in a volume of 100 ul in 2.8x Mueller-Hinton broth medium, was added to the rows A to H, except column 12. The same volume of broth medium without inoculum was added to column 12 in row A to H. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for 48 hours in a humidified 5% CO2<br>
atmosphere (incubator with open air valve and continuous ventilation). At the end of incubation, two days after inoculation, the bacterial growth was quantitated fluorometrically. Therefore Alamar Blue (l0x) was added to all wells in a volume of 20 ul and plates were incubated for another 2 hours at 50°C.<br>
The fluorescence was read in a computer-controlled fluorometer (Cytofluor, Biosearch) at an excitation wavelength of 530 nm and an emission wavelength of 590 nm (gain 30). The % growth inhibition achieved by the compounds was calculated according to standard methods. The pICso was defined as the 50 % inhibitory concentration for bacterial growth.
