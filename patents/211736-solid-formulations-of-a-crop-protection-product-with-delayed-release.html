Slow-release formulations of crop protection agents<br>
The present invention relates to a solid formulation of a crop protection product with delayed release of the active ingredient, obtainable by preparing a melt comprising:<br>
0.1-80% by wt. of an active ingredient which can be used in crop<br>
protection, or of a combination of such active ingredients,<br>
10-80% by wt. of at least one mineral filler,<br>
0-20% by wt. of inorganic or organic additives, and<br>
to 100% by wt. of at least one thermoplastic water-insoluble<br>
polymer,<br>
the total of all constituents equaling 100% by weight, and subsequent shaping.<br>
The invention furthermore relates to a process for the preparation of a solid formulation of a crop protection product, which comprises melting at least one active ingredient, at least one mineral filler and, if appropriate, inorganic or organic additives with at least one thermoplastic, water-insoluble polymer (solubility 
The invention furthermore relates to a process which comprises using in solid form such a solid formulation of a crop protection product for controlling phytopathogenic fungi, undesired vegetation, undesired attack by insects or mites, and/or for regulating plant growth, and allowing it to act on plants, their environment or on seed. Such solid formulations furthermore release the active ingredient(s) which it comprises in a controlled and slow manner (complete release within several days up to some months) into the environment (soil, aqueous medium, plants). This leads to a biological availability over a prolonged period to suit the respective purpose. For example, this is necessary for active ingredients which are insufficiently persistent in soil and/or plant, for active ingredients which are phytotoxic to the crop plant, or else for applications where it is required that the availability or release of active ingredient extends over a prolonged period.<br><br>
Formulations comprising active ingredient which are prepared by-melt extrusion are generally known. Extruding and subsequent shaping of melts of water-soluble polymers, preferably copolymers of vinylpyrrolidone, which contain active ingredient are described in EP-A 240904 and EP-A 240906.<br>
WO 94/08455 describes the coextrusion of crop protection products with polyvinylpyrrolidone and subsequent cooling, crushing and grinding. The ground extrudate disperses rapidly and finely in water and is suitable for spray applications.<br>
There are furthermore known solid formulations of crop protection products which are prepared by melt extrusion with subsequent shaping and which allow a controlled, slow release of pesticides.<br>
WO 91/03940 describes biodegradable pesticide-comprising matrices, their preparation by means of melt extrusion with subsequent shaping, and their use for the controlled release of pesticides. In addition to synthetic polymers (
WO 95/28835 describes the preparation of agrochemical formulations with hydrophobic and hydrophilic waxes. Active ingredient, carnauba wax and polyethylene glycol are subjected to melt extrusion, ground and graded. The 500 -1000 µm  fraction is released in water. Depending on the composition, 14-100% of the active ingredients are released after 10 hours.<br>
US 5,643,590 describes insecticidal compositions whose mammalian toxicity is markedly reduced. In a multi-step process, pesticides together with PVC, stabilizer, plasticizer and mineral additive are mixed intimately at 75-110°C, and the mixture is cooled to 70°C, transferred into an extruder, extruded at 150-180°C and subsequently pelleted. The pellets, which do not dust, exhibit a markedly reduced toxicity to mammals and a prolonged activity (100% worm control over 10 weeks).<br>
DE 19 622 355 describes the preparation by melt extrusion and injection molding of shaped articles which exhibit controlled release. The crop protection agent  together with a vinyl acetate polymer which is insoluble in water and a water-soluble<br><br>
polymer (polyvinyl acetate/vinylpyrrolidone) - is subjected to melt extrusion and granulation.<br>
Formulations based on synthetic polymers and starch (WO 91/03940)  can be plastified homogeneously and granulated to give dust-free granules in a simple manner - i.e., inter alia, without addition of water and/or glycerol - only if the polymer content is high (&gt;60%) and rapidly show signs of decomposition since the starch is sensitive to heat and shearing forces. Also, such formulations swell and exhibit low density and thus only show insufficient sedimentation in water or soils flooded with water.<br>
While formulations based on hydrophobic and hydrophilic waxes  (WO 95/28835) are easy to prepare by simply melting them together with the active ingredient, they are not easy to process (for example extrusion granulation, hot cutting) and are not dimensionally stable upon heat aging (14 days at 54'C) as a result of the wax-like consistency. Moreover, formulations made of stearic acid or stearyl alcohol and PEG do not sediment in water (density 
US 5,643,590 describes a complicated multi-step process in which pesticides are mixed intimately at 75-110°C with PVC, stabilizer, plasticizer and mineral additive, the mixture is cooled to 70®C, transferred into an extruder and extruded at 150-180°C, and the extrudate is subsequently pelleted. The lack of thermal stability of a large number of active ingredients does not allow high temperature stress because of the danger of decomposition. Moreover, the manufacturing process should be as simple as possible.<br>
In DE  19 622 355, crop protection agents are subjected to melt extrusion and granulation together with a vinyl acetate polymer which is insoluble in water and a water-soluble polymer (polyvinyl acetate/vinylpyrrolidone). Due to low glass transition temperatures, formulations based on polyvinyl acetate polymers exhibit insufficient heat resistance. Upon heat aging (14 days at 54°C), granulated melt extrudates made of polyvinyl acetate and polyvinylpyrrolidone coalesce to form a coherent mass.<br>
The problems are insufficient heat and storage stability, inadequate sedimentation, poor granulation properties, inadequate homogeneity of the melt, and complicated and expensive production.<br><br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a solid, storage-stable, slow-releasing crop protection formulation which settles in water, can be granulated and can be prepared readily from inexpensive components by subjecting a mixture of solids to  melt extrusion, followed by shaping.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the composition described at the outset and the process for its preparation.<br>
In general, suitable active ingredients are those which do not undergo decomposition under the processing temperatures when preparing the melt. Preferred substances are those which are solid at room temperature since these are easier to mix and meter. However, the use is not restricted to solid active ingredients since even liquid active ingredients can be processed by means of a solid matrix to give a solid, heat-resistant and storage-stable formulation.<br>
The amount of active ingredient components in the total formulation may vary within wide limits, depending on efficacy, release rate and processability. Thus, the active ingredient content may range from 0.1-80% by weight, preferably from 0.5-40% by weight, especially preferably from 1-20% by weight, based on the total formulation. The only condition is that the formulation is still thermoplastically processable.<br>
Crop protection agents which may be mentioned are fungicides, herbicides, insecticides and growth regulators. Combinations are also possible.<br>

Other structures of the compounds I and II are disclosed in detail in WO 96/32015, pages 3 to 18.<br>
When providing the mixtures, it is preferred to employ the active ingredients of the formula I or II, which may be admixed with other active ingredients against pests (for example insects, arachnids or nematodes) or harmful fungi or else herbicidal or growth-regulatory active ingredients or fertilizers, as required.<br>

Preferred substances amongst the fungicides are systemic strobilurins, which may be employed as a slow-release formulation in rice growing. They should be applied as granules by broadcasting. The dust-free, homogeneous granules should sediment readily in flooded fields or, when flooding treated fields, not rise to the surface, and should be dimensionally stable and storage-stable upon use, even in warmer regions*<br>
The rates of application for the compounds of the formula I, or II, are 2 to 0.01 kg/ha, preferably 0.5 to 0.02 kg/ha, in particular 0.25 to 0.03 kg/ha.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise 0.1 to 80, preferably 0.5 to 40, especially preferably 1 to 20, % by weight of one of the compounds of the formula I or II.<br>
The active ingredients are employed in a purity of 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to 1H NMR or HPLC spectrum [sic]).<br><br>
The compounds of the formula I or II, their mixtures or the respective formulations are applied by treating the harmful fungir their environment, or the materials, plants, seeds, soils, areas or spaces to be protected from fungal attack, with a  fungicidally active amount of the mixture, or in the case of separate application, of the compounds of the formula I or II. Treatment may be effected before or after attack by the harmful fungi.<br>
' Preferred polymeric binders are amorphous and partially crystalline polymers and mixtures of these which can be processed thermoplastically, i.e. as a viscous melt, and which additionally have a solubility in water of less than 100 mg per liter of water at 20°C.<br>
Examples of suitable polymeric binders are:<br>
polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polybutylene and polyisobutylene; vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polystyrene, polyacrylonitrile, polyacrylates, polymethacrylates; polyacetals such as polyoxymethylene; polyesters such as polyhydroxybutyric acid, polyhydroxyvaleric acid, polyalkylene terephthalates, polyalkylene adipate terephthalates, polybutylene adipate terephthalates; polyester amides; polyether amides; polyamides; polyimides; polyethers; polyether ketones; polyurethanes and polycarbonates. Also copolymers of ethylene/vinyl acetate, ethylene/(meth)aerylates, styrene/acrylonitrile, styrene/butadiene, styrene/butadiene/acrylonitrile, olefin/maleic anhydride.<br>
Examples of preferred polymers are polyolefins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyesters.<br>
Especially preferred are biodegradable polybutylene adipate terephthalates, as they are described in DE 4 440 858 (Ecoflex®, BASF).<br>
Suitable mineral fillers are substances which, due to their density, facilitate or make possible sedimentation of the granules in aqueous medium and which can be incorporated in large amounts into thermoplastic polymers, are not too hard, i.e. can be processed readily by extruding, are chemically indifferent, increase the heat resistance of the formulation, are thermostable themselves, improve the granulation properties of the melt, allow the active ingredient to be released, are ecologically sound and, moreover, as inexpensive as possible. Moreover, the<br><br>
incorporability of components of low viscosity, such as, for example, the active ingredient, is improved. In addition, type and amount of filler affect release of the active ingredient(s) from the polymer matrix.<br>
It is especially the better sedimentation (high density of the mineral), the granulation properties (fillers occupy amorphous zones of the polymer and thus reduce intermolecular mobility; thus, they increase the heat resistance and reduce the elasticity; the product is easier to granulate) and the increased heat resistance that mean that the addition of a mineral filler is not only sensible from the economical standpoint, but is also necessary from the technical point of view.<br>
Examples of suitable mineral fillers are: oxides, hydroxides, silicates, carbonates and sulfates of calcium, magnesium, aluminum and titanium; specifically for example chalk, gypsum, bentonite, kaolin, wollastonite, talc, phlogopite, clay minerals in general, and mixtures of various mineral fillers.<br>
Preferred mineral fillers are, for example, limestone (calcium carbonate), gypsum (calcium sulfate) and talc (magnesium silicate), which are particularly suitable due to their softness ; and their lubricity.<br>
The amount of mineral filler may vary within wide limits, depending on the granulation properties and the processability. Thus, the filler content may range from 10 to 80% by weight, preferably from 10 to 70% by weight, especially preferably from 10 to 60% by weight, based on the total formulation. The only condition is that the formulation can still be subjected to thermoplastic processing.<br>
Moreover, inorganic or organic additives are optionally used to improve the processability of the mixture and to modify release of the active ingredient(s). The amount of additives should range from 0 to 20% by weight, preferably from 0 to 10% by weight and especially preferably from 0 to 5% by weight, based on the total formulation. The only condition is that the formulation can still be subjected to thermoplastic processing.<br>
The group of additives may be divided as follows:<br>
1)  Customary auxiliaries used in extrusion technology, such as lubricants, mold release agents, fluidization auxiliaries.<br><br>
plasticizers and stabilizers, as they are described, for<br>
example, in DE 19504832.<br>
I.<br>
2)  Additives which affect release of the active ingredient(s):<br>
water-soluble inorganic substances such as, for example, sodium chloride, sodium sulfate or calcium sulfate<br>
water-soluble organic substances such as, for example, neopentyl glycol, polyethylene glycol or urea<br>
non-ionic or ionic surfactants such as, for example, fatty alcohol ethoxylates, alkylbenzenesulfonates or alkylnaphthalenesulfonates<br>
waxes, fatty alcohols and fatty acids, fats and oils such as, for example, carnauba wax, stearic acid, stearyl alcohol or castor oil<br>
To prepare the formulations according to the invention, all components can be melted together directly in the form of a physical mixture or mixed with the pre-formed polymer melt. In general, it is customary to meter into the extruder a physical mixture of active ingredient, filler, additive and polymer jointly in a free feed, e.g. via a differential weigh feeder, where it is melted.<br>
The process steps of mixing and melting can be effected in the customary manner, for example as described in EP-A 240904, EP-A 337256 and EP-A 358195.<br>
In general, the components are mixed in the melt in a known manner in kneaders or extruders, preferably in single- or twin-screw extruders, in a temperature range between 50 and 200^*0, preferably between 50 and 150°C, especially preferably in a temperature range of between 50 and 140°C.<br>
The extruder may contain mixing, kneading and return elements, as required. If appropriate, existing solvents and residual moisture may be stripped off during extrusion by means of gas outlet ports or vacuum pumps. Also, components in liquid and in solid form may be introduced via pumps or conveying means arranged laterally. The extrusion device used depends on the desired shape.<br><br>
The melt which exits may be shaped by extrusion granulation of the fully or partially cooled extrudates, by hot cutting of the melt at the extruder head using a cut-off unit with rotating knives, by underwater granulation directly at the exit point of the melt from the nozzle, or by another method conventionally used in plastics technology described, inter alia, in EP-A 240906 and DE-A 3 830 355. The resulting solid shapes can be processed further to shaped articles, for example by injection molding.<br>
Moreover, a layer structure can be achieved by means of coextrusion or by subsequent coating, for example in a fluidized bed, with the aid of solutions or dispersions which may comprise active ingredients and polymers, and this layer structure modulates the release of the shaped article according to the invention or incorporates an additional active ingredient component•<br>
The process according to the invention is illustrated hereinbelow with reference to examples.<br>
General procedure<br>
The amounts of active ingredient, filler, additive and polymers indicated in the excunples were mixed, introduced via a weigh feeder into the conveying zone (zone 0) of a closely intermeshing counterrotating twin-screw extruder (Haake Rheocord 90 equipped with mixing screw and 2 mm nozzle, Haake, 76227 Karlsruhe) and homogenized over 5 temperature zones at a throughput of 1 kg per hour and a screw speed of 200 rpm, plastified and, at the extruder head (zone 4) discharged via a 2 mm nozzle to a metal conveyor belt. From the metal conveyor belt, the extrudate was introduced via an air chute and a Haake TPl conveying drum, into a 1.1 mm SGS 100/E strand granulator by C.F. Scheer &amp; CIE and formulated into cylindrical granules of average cross section 1.0-1.2 mm.<br>

Example 1<br>
Formulations based on carnauba wax / Pluriol 9000 (formulation 12-17) were not melt-extruded and granulated, due to their low melting viscosity and their low glass transition temperature. 50 g batches of the mixtures of active ingredient, carnauba wax and Pluriol 9000 were melted in a 100 ml glass flask in an oil bath at 120°C and homogenized for 10 minutes using a glass spatula. Then, a Pasteur pipette was used to deposit drops of approx. 2-3 mm diameter on a cold metal sheet. After cooling, the wax formulations were removed from the metal sheet using a spatula.<br>
The tables which follow list all active ingredient formulations or crop protection formulations prepared in the above-described manner, mainly by melt extrusion (formulation 1-11 and 18-67). The metered amounts in % by weight based on the total formulation can be seen from the tables:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
which remain dimensionally stable and flowable after heat aging were assessed with Y for Yes, Granules which do not remain dimensionally stable and flowable/ i.e. which tend to agglomerate, were assessed with N for No.<br><br><br>
The wax matrices sediment in some cases only and are in no case stable upon heat aging (formulation 12-17).<br>
The formulations based on polymer / mineral filler have the best properties regarding sedimentation and storage stability (formulation 18-27, 30-37, 40-47, 50-64, 65-67).<br>
Example 2<br>
Apart from the conditions that the formulations according to the invention are transport- and storage-stable and are capable of sedimentation regarding wind and water erosion, the formulations according to the invention should release the crop protection agents at a controlled slow rate, i.e. within a period of a few days up to a few months, depending on the active ingredient and the formula. A delayed release of active ingredient is required if a long-term activity is desired or if the active ingredients are phytotoxic. To this end, the release of active ingredient from the granules in water was determined.<br>
*<br>
To determine the release of active ingredient, 1 g of granules of each of the above formulations was introduced into all graduated flask and covered with 1 1 of drinking water. The flasks were stored for 4 weeks and longer at 25°C under vibration-proof conditions. To determine the release of active ingredient, samples were taken daily. Prior to sampling, the flask was turned by 180*^ and mixed to guarantee a homogeneous distribution of the active ingredient. The aqueous solutions were then measured using a UV/VIS spectroscope and returned into the flasks. Calibrating curves (absorption versus concentration) of the active ingredients were established beforehand.<br>
The apparatus used for detennination of the active ingredients was the following:<br>
UV/VIS spectroscope, HP 8452, diode array spectrophotometer, 1 cm quartz cuvette<br>
The absorptions were measured at different wavelengths, depending on the absorption maximum of the various active ingredients (X = 200-250 nm) .<br>
The release curves of all formulations (formulation 1-64) are found in the appendix. The percentage release was plotted against the time in days (100% means the complete release of 50 ppm of<br><br>
active ingredient for 1 g of 5% formulation in 1 liter of water) (see Figures 1—10).<br>
The cumulated release curves of the active ingredients are square-root dependent, as can be expected for a diffusion process (-f^ law):<br>
c = K X "{1:<br>
t: time, c: concentration of active ingredient<br>
Moreover, a release is highly dependent on the water solubility of the active ingredient, while its dependence on granule shape and size is less pronounced. This suggests diffusion-controlled pore diffusion. The release rate is too low for an erosion mechanism and too high for matrix diffusion. Fillers and additives affect release to the expected extent.<br>
The release of active ingredient as a function of time can be adjusted to suit the specific aims by varying the amounts of polymer matrix, filler and, if appropriate, additive.<br><br><br><br>
