DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring firstly to Figures 1 to 4, the applicator 10 comprises a base designated 12, two flaps 14 and two tabs 16.<br>
The base 12 is moulded in two parts 12.1 and 12.2 with a split line 18 between them. To ensure that the parts 12:1 and 12.2 do not separate during packaging of the condom, thin webs (not shown) can bridge the split line 18. These provide insignificant resistance to breaking along the line 18 when such action is required.<br>
The base 12 comprises two planar sections 20 each of which   a semi-circular trough 22. Each trough 22 is bounded by a radialiy   Figure 4), by a base wall 25 and by a radially outer   24 projects above the level of the section 20. The wall 24 slopes radially inwardly and the wail 28 slopes radially outwardly. Thus the base 26 of the<br>
 radially is narrower than the mouth of the trough measured in the<br>
interlocking pins 30 protrude upwardly from the sections 20 and a strengthening rim 32 extends around the outer edge of the lower surface of the base<br>
The flaps 14 are joined to the edges of the parts 12.1, 12.2 remote from, the trough 22 by way of film hinges 34. Each flap comprises a planar area 36.<br><br>
One edge of each area 35 is joined by the film hinge 34 to the base 12. Strengthening flanges 38 protrude upwardly from the areas 36.<br>
Each flap 14 has a semi-circular depression 40 along its remaining edge. The depression comprises a circumferentially extending semi-circular inclined wall 42 and a semi-circular flat area 44 which are best seen in Figures 2 and 4.<br>
Sockets 45 are provided in the areas 35, the sockets serving to receive the pins 30.<br>
The tabs 15 are connected to the flaps 14 by way of film hinges 48. It  the tab 16 are not shown in Figure 3.<br>
The underside of each flap 14 (see Figures 3 and 4) is dimpled at 50 to provide a finger grip.<br>
clips are provided at 52 on the flaps 14.<br>
With the  applicator as shown in Figures 1 and 2, the hem ring H Forces 2 and 4) of a rolled condom C is pressed Into the circular trough defined by the two trough halves 22. The closed end of the condom extends across the circular space bounded by the semi-circular inner waits 24 with the nipple at the end of the condom in this space.<br><br>
The flaps 14 are then displaced through 180° to the positions shown in Figures 3 and 4. The clips 52 are distorted as the flaps reach their fully folded positions and grip the edges of the parts 12.1,12.2 thereby to hold the flaps 14 in place. The depressions 40, due to the inversion of the flaps 14, become raised areas and close-off the upwardly open circular trough which contains the hem ring H. The radially inner peripheries of the areas 44 lie close to the radially outer faces of the inner wails 24 of the trough. The condom extends through the circular gap which remains between said inner peripheries and said radially outer faces.<br>
The tabs are pressed down to the positions shown in Figure 4 and mean the nipplke to prevent air entering ft.<br>
* once the applicator has been removed from its package (as will be<br>
 as the applicator is gripped on each side of the split line. Flexing the applicator causes any flimsy connection between the two parts to fail.<br>
  H now holds the two parts together.<br>
as the applicator is slid along the erect penis, the condom unrolls from the inner ring and out through the gap between the inner peripheries of the facts and the rapidly outer face of the inner wall of the circular trough.<br>
Turning now to Figures 5 to 10, the applicator 100 illustrated comprises<br>
V<br>
two parts which have been designated 102 and 104. The part 102 (Figure 5) comprises a  trough 106 which is bounded on the inside by a wall 108 which is<br><br>
substantially oval in plan view and on the outside by an outer wall 110. The outer wall 110 extends generally parallel to the wall 108 and has long side sections 112 which are straight, short straight end sections 114 and curved sections 116 joining the sections 112 and 114.<br>
Gripping handles 118 protrude outwardly from the wall 110.<br>
Inter-locking tabs 120 are provided which protrude upwardly from the wall 110,<br>
The part102 can be moulded in halves, the halves abutting along the   for ease of handling, however, it is preferred that the part 102 be   as a single component with flimsy, frangible moulded bridges connections<br>
expanding across the centre line L.<br>
The part 104 comprises a wall 122 which matches the wall 110 in   124 in the wall 122 receive the locking tabs120 protruding from the<br><br>
inwardly of each half of the wall 122 there is a flap 125 which has an inner edge which is of generally semi-oval shape. A semi-circular cut-out 128 is provided in the edge of each flap 126.<br>
Gripping handles 130 protrude outwardly from the wall 122 and match<br><br>
the handles 118 in shape.<br>
At each end of each handle 118, 130 there is a tab 132 with a circular hole 134 in it. If desired only the part 102 or the part 104, but not both, has tabs 132.<br>
The part 104 can, in the same way as the part 102, be moulded in halves. However it is preferred that it be moulded in one piece with flimsy bridges extending across the fine LI.<br>
strengthening ribs 135, which are on the top faces of the flaps 126 as  Figure 10.. are provided.<br>
The name ring  H (Figure 9) of a condom C is pressed into the trough bounced by the walls 103 and 110. If the part 102 is moulded in two halves it is the<br>
  learn ring which attaches the halves to one another. The nipple of   across the generally oval opening,' designated 138 in Figure 5,<br><br>
Lubricant can be fed into-the trough through the cut-outs 128. The part 104 invented from the position shown in Figure 6, is then pressed down onto the part 102. The tabs 120 enter the sockets 124 thereby connecting the parts 102, 104 together.<br><br>
The flaps 126 cover the trough in which the hem ring is located (see Figure 9) in the same way that the flaps 14 cover the hem ring trough 22 in Figures 1 to 4.<br>
The inner edges of the flaps 126 lie adjacent the wall 108, there being a gap wide enough for that part of the cylindrical wall of the condom adjacent the nipple to pass through.<br>
As shown at 140 in Figure 9, the handles 118, 130 can have tongues and grooves which inter block to secure the handles together.<br>
The condom is applied by flexing the applicator along the registering   4 and pulling the two halves apart If there are flimsy connections they   stags The applicator is slid along the penis causing the condom to unroll and feed out of the trough through said gap.<br>
Once the condom is fully unrolled, the two halves are tilted with respect<br>
  Using the handles 118, 130 and simultaneously pulled apart The   ■decreases the naps 125 and comes free of the applicator which is now in<br>
two separate valves<br><br><br>
in Figures 12 to 14 there is shown a package which contains the applicator of Figures 5 to 10. The package comprises a multi-layered foil. In the preferred form the layers are polyester-aluminium-polythene with laminating<br><br>
adhesive between the aluminium and plastics material layers on each side thereof.<br>
The foil is manufactured in strip form and rolled. At intervals along the length of the roll there are transverse lines of perforations. Each perforation can be, for example, 1mm long with a gap of 1mm between itself and the next perforation. The perforations are cut partially through the polyester layer but not through the polyethylene or aluminum layers.<br>
At each end of each fine of perforations the foil is cut. The cuts are preferably V-shaped and extend inwardly for, for example, 2mm from the edge of the and the combinations thus extend between the cuts.<br>
The foil strips are fed forward and the applicator placed on the lower of<br>
  strips with a line of perforations across the applicator. A heated former ,preferably of aluminium, then produces a substantially square seal S which<br><br>
To remove the applicator the package is torn along the line of   the cuts assist in the commencement of the splitting action.<br>
The  foils can be sealed through the holes 134 to located the applicator in the package.<br>
