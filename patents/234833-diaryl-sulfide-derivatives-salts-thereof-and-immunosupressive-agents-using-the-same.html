				<td> The present invention relates to a diaryl sulfide derivative, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or hydrate.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to diaryl sulfide derivatives, salts and hydrates thereof that are useful as an immunosuppressive agent.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
Immunosuppressive agents are widely used as a treatment for autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, nephritis, osteoarthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, chronic inflammatory diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, and allergic diseases such as asthma and dermatitis. Progress in medicine has led to an increase in the number of tissue and organ transplantations performed each year.  In such a situation of modern medicine, having as much control as possible over the rejection following transplantation is a key to successful transplantation.  Immunosuppressive agents also play a significant role to this end.<br>
Among immunosuppressors commonly used in organ transplantation are antimetabolites, such as azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, such as cyclosporin A and tacrolimus, and corticosteroid, such as<br><br>
prednisolone. Despite their popularity, some of these drugs are not effective enough while others require continuous monitoring of the blood drug level to avoid renal failure and other serious side effects. Thus, none of conventional immunosuppressive agents are satisfactory in view of efficacy and potential side effects.<br>
Multiple drug combined-therapy, in which different immunosuppressive drugs with different mechanisms of action are used, is becoming increasingly common with the aims of alleviating the side effects of the drugs and achieving sufficient immunosuppressive effects. Also, development of new types of immunosuppressive agents that have completely different mechanisms of action is sought.<br>
In an effort to respond to such demands, the present inventors conducted a search for new types of immunosuppressive agents with main emphasis on 2-amino-l,3-propanediol derivatives.<br>
While the use of 2-amino-l,3-propanediol derivatives as immunosuppressive agents has been disclosed in PCT publication W094/08943 (YOSHITOMI PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES, Ltd., TAITO Co., Ltd.) and in Japanese Patent Publication No. Hei 9-2579602 (YOSHITOMI PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES, Ltd., TAITO Co., Ltd.), it has not been previously known that 2-amino-l,3-propanediol derivatives having a diaryl sulfide group, which are subjects of the present invention, can serve as an<br>
effective immunosuppressor.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a diaryl sulfide derivative that exhibits significant immunosuppressive effects with little side effects,<br>
In the course of studies on immunosuppressive agents that have different mechanisms of action from antimetabolites and calcineurin inhibitors, the present inventors discovered that novel diaryl sulfide derivatives that have a different structure from conventional immunosuppressors exhibit strong immunosuppressive effects. Specifically, the compounds are such that one of the aryl groups includes, at its para-position, a carbon chain with an aminopropanediol group and the other aryl group includes a substituent at its meta-position. This discovery led the present inventors to devise the present invention.<br>
The present invention thus is an immunosuppressive agent containing as an active ingredient at least one of a diaryl sulfide derivative, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and hydrate thereof, the diaryl sulfide derivative represented by the following general formula (1):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein RI is halogen, trihalomethyl, hydroxy, lower alkyl having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, substituted or unsubstituted phenyl, aralkyl, lower alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, trifluoromethyloxy, phenoxy, cyclohexylmethyloxy, substituted or unsubstituted aralkyloxy, pyridylmethyloxy, cinnamyloxy, naphthylmethyloxy, phenoxymethyl, hydroxymethyl, hydroxyethyl, lower alkylthio having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, lower alkylsulfinyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, lower alkylsulfonyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, benzylthio, acetyl, nitro, or cyano; R2 is hydrogen, halogen, trihalomethyl, lower alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, lower alkyl having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, phenethyl, or benzyloxy; Rj is hydrogen, halogen, trifluoromethyl, lower alkoxyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, hydroxy, benzyloxy, lower alkyl having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, phenyl, or lower alkoxymethyl having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; X is S, SO, or S02; and n is an integer from 1 to 4.<br>
More specifically, the present invention is an immunosuppressive agent containing as an active ingredient at least one of a diaryl sulfide derivative, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and hydrate thereof, the diaryl sulfide derivative represented by the following general formula (la):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R2, RS, and n are the same as defined above.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention is an<br>
immunosuppressive agent containing as an active ingredient at least one of a diaryl sulfide derivative, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt and hydrate thereof, the diaryl sulfide derivative represented by the following general formula (Ib):<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
wherein R2, RS, and n are the same as defined above; and R4 is hydrogen, halogen, lower alkyl having 1 to 7 carbon atoms, lower alkoxy having 1 to 4 carbon atoms, or trifluoromethyl.<br>
The compounds of the general formulae (1), (la), and (Ib) are each a novel compound.<br>
Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the compound of the general formula (1) include acid salts, such as hydrochloride, hydrobromide, acetate, trifluoroacetate, methanesulfonate, citrate, and tartrate.<br>

Spleens were collected from 9 to 11 week old male BALB/c mice (CLEA JAPAN Inc., CHARLES RIVER JAPAN Inc., or JAPAN SLC Inc.). The spleens were placed in a phosphate-buffered saline (PBS(-), NISSUI PHARMACEUTICAL Co., Ltd.) or in an RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO INDUSTRIES Inc., or IWAKI GLASS Co., Ltd.) and were either passed through a stainless steel mesh, or gently pressed between two slide glasses and then passed through a cell strainer (70um, Falcon), to form a cell suspension. The suspension was then centrifuged and the supernatant was discarded. An ammonium chloride-Tris isotonic buffer was added to the suspension to lyse erythrocytes. The cells were then<br>
centrifuged and washed three times in PBS (-) or RPMI-1640 medium and were resuspended in an RPMI-1640 medium. To this suspension, mitomycin C (KYOWA HAKKO KOGYO Co., Ltd.) was added to a final concentration of 25ug/mL and the suspension was incubated for 30 minutes at 37 °C in a 5% C02 atmosphere. The cells were again centrifuged and washed in PBS (-) or RPMI-1640 medium and were resuspended in an RPMI-1640 medium so that the medium would contain 2.5 X 108 cells/mL. This suspension served as a "stimulation cell suspension." Using a 27G needle along with a microsyringe (Hamilton), 20)jL (5 X 106 cells/mouse) of the stimulation cell suspension was subcutaneously injected into the right hind footpad of 7 to 9 week old male C3H/HeN mice (CLEA JAPAN Inc., CHARLES RIVER JAPAN Inc., or JAPAN SLC Inc.). A group of mice was injected with RPMI-1640 medium alone to serve as normal control.  4 days after the injection, right popliteal lymph nodes were collected and were weighed on a Mettler AT201 electronic scale (METTLER TOLEDO Co., Ltd.).  Each animal was intraperitoneally administered a test compound once a day for four consecutive days starting on the day of the injection of the stimulation cells (i.e., total of 4 times). Controls were administered a vehicle that has the same composition as that used in the preparation of the test compounds. The results are shown in Table 11 below:<br>

Ability of test compounds to suppress delayed-type<br>
hypersensitivity in mice.<br>
This experiment was performed according to the method described in Methods in Enzymology, 300 (1999): 345-363.  1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DNFB, NACALAI TESQUE Inc.) was dissolved in a mixture of acetone and olive oil (acetone: olive oil = 4:1) to a concentration of 1% (v/v) .  lOuL of the 1% DNFB solution was applied to the footpad of each hind leg of male BALB/c mice (JAPAN SLC Inc. or CHARLES RIVER JAPAN Inc.) for sensitization. The sensitization was done for 2 consecutive days (day 0 and day 1). On day 5, the mice were challenged with the antigen to induce delayed-type hypersensitive responses: First, the initial thickness of each ear was measured by the dial thickness gauge G (0.01-lOmm, OZAKI MFC Co., Ltd.) and a test compound was administered.  30 minutes after the administration, lOuL of a 0.2% (v/v) DNFB solution was applied to the inner and outer surfaces of the<br><br>
right ear of each animal for antigen challenge. The left ear of each animal was challenged with the solvent alone. 24 hours after the challenge, the increase in the ear thickness was measured for each ear and the difference in thickness between the right and the left ears was determined for each individual, The test compound was dissolved, or suspended, in an ultra pure water and was orally administered at a dose of O.lmL/lOg of body weight. A control group was administered ultra pure water alone. The results are shown in Table 12 below:<br>

Activities of test compounds on skin transplantation model in<br>
mice<br>
Effects of the test compounds were examined on skin transplantation model in mice. The experimental procedure was referred to the method described in Journal of Experimental Biology, 28, No.3 (1951); 385-405.<br>
First, dorsal skin from male DBA/2 mice were stripped of the fatty layer and the panniculus carnosus and, cut into circular grafts with a diameter of 8mm. Next, graft bed, a circular area, approximately 8mm in diameter, was prepared in the back of anesthetized male BALB/c mice with a scalpel while the skin was pinched by forceps. Each graft obtained from the DBA/2 mice was placed on the graft bed formed in the backs of the BALB/c mice and was secured with a strip of adhesive bandage while held down from the top.  6 days after transplantation, the bandage was removed and the graft was subsequently observed everyday. The activity of each compound was evaluated based on the length of the graft survival period, which is defined as the number of days for rejection. Each test compound was dissolved in ultra pure water and was orally administered once a day, starting from the day of transplantation.  In a similar fashion, the control group was administered ultra pure water alone.<br>
The results are shown in Figs. 1 through 3.<br>
As can be seen from the results, the compounds of the present invention represented by the general formula (1) have proven effective in animal model.<br>
