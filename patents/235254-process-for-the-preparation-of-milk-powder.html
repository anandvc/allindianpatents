Process for the preparation of milk powder<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of fat-containing milk powder.<br>
In the preparation of milk powder, it is economical to concentrate production in regions where fresh milk is available in great quantities and at an economic price. It is thus desirable to increase the capacity of existing installed drying equipment, particularly spray drying towers, without investing in new equipment. A means to achieve this goal would be to introduce highly concentrated milk into the drying step. A problem is that in treating of highly concentrated milk a product quality deterioration occurs as a consequence of fat clustering of the highly concentrated milk mainly during homogenisation. Homogenisation cannot be omitted because of the bad solubility of powders made from non homogenised milk.<br>
US-A-5 518 751 is concerned with a process for the manufacture of recombined evaporated milk concentrates and milk powders comprising introducing a vegetable fat into the liquid concentrate in the course of evaporating for increasing the unsaturated fatty acid content thereof. In an embodiment for making milk powder, after introduction of the fat in the last effect of the evaporator, the mixture is homogenised before being dried.<br>
EP-A-0 627 169 is related to a process for the manufacture of liquid evaporated milk in which the preheating and evaporation steps are within the evaporation equipment and homogenisation takes place before concentration.<br>
EP-A-0 873 690 is concerned with a process of preparing a fat-containing foodstuff comprising adding a fat phase to an aqueous phase said adding and homogenising being located between two evaporators of a plurality of evaporator effects. The purpose of this step is to protect heat-sensitive oils. For instant milk<br><br>
powder it would not make sense to separate the fat from the production milk prior to evaporation.<br>
Swmruny of the invention<br>
We have found that it is possible to drastically increase productivity of manufacture of milk powder by primary spray drying fresh milk and by the way to maintain or even improve the powder quality i:A that homogenisation is carried out at mid way of evaporation, i.e. on the pre-concentrate between the stages of the multiple stages evaporator. This positioning of homogenisation in the present invention is a solution to the problem of too high viscosity obtained in a concentrate homogenisation. Thus the control of viscosity allows to dry a concentrate of beyond 50 % solids content by weight without adversely affecting the quality of the powder obtained after drying.<br>
The process of the invention thus comprises:<br>
preparing a standardised milk,<br>
feeding the prepared standardised milk into an evaporator having at least one<br>
stage to obtain a pre-concentrate,<br>
homogenising the pre-concentrate,<br>
further evaporating the pre-concentrate in an evaporator having at least one stage<br>
to obtain a concentrate having a total solids content of at least 50 % by weight,<br>
and then<br>
spray drying the concentrate.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The principle behind this invention is the ability to spray dry a milk concentrate containing up to about 63 % by weight solids concentration.<br>
According to the invention, fresh whole milk is standardised to a desired fat to solids not-fat ratio. This standardisation is carried out generally by adding the appropriate amount of skimmed milk to the fresh whole milk. This can also be done by composing suitable milk liquids from fresh whole milk, partially skimmed milk, cream, butterfat, buttermilk etc. Recombination of milk can also<br><br>
be carried out from milk powder, skim milk powder, butter oil or vegetable oils with the appropriate amount of water.<br>
Depending on the quality of milk, the thus standardised milk is then optionally clarified by centrifugation, preferably after having been heated to about 40° C to about 45° C in order to obtain the best separation and cleaning efficiency during clarifying.<br>
The milk is then subjected to heat treatment. The heat treatment can be performed in two steps as is conventional, by preheating and then heating with a suitable dwell time,<br>
The heat-treated milk is then fed into an evaporator. When the total solids content of the milk is from 20 to 50 % by weight, preferably about 35 % by weight, the milk is homogenised, in one or two stages, preferably in two stages before the evaporation process is completed.<br>
When the total solids content of milk is greater than about 50 % by weight, the particles, in particular casein micelles and fat droplets, become sensitive to mechanical shear stress. Homogenising the milk at about 35 % by weight solids allows efficient homogenisation using high pressure piston homogenisers. Homogenisation can be carried out on part of the total flow. It is important in this case that the fat part of the milk is completely homogenised together with an appropriate part of the non-fat solids and water.<br>
In principal, the milk can be homogenised at any concentration below a critical concentration which is about 50 % by weight. On industrial manufacturing level one is interested to homogenise at a concentration as high as possible because this reduces the size of the homogeniser and hence manufacturing cost. Consequently, it is preferred to homogenise mid-way of the evaporator. The specific evaporator configuration will indicate the best solid content (TS, total solids) where the homogenisation is practised.<br>
Homogenisation can be carried out in one or two stages. The pressure of the first stage of the homogeniser is from about 50 to about 250 bar. Preferably, the pressure is from about 140 bar to about 150 bar. The pressure of the second stage<br><br>
of the homogeniser is from 0 to about 150 bar. Preferably, the pressure is from about 20 to about 60 bar. The total pressure of the homogeniser is from about 140 bar to about 250 bar. Preferably the total pressure of the homogeniser is from about 160 bar to about 210 bar.<br>
Surprisingly, homogenising the milk pre-concentrate at this intermediate concentration level avoids the strong viscosity increase which occurs if one homogenises the milk at solids concentration above 50 % by weight and allows for later spray drying at a total solids content of preferably about 55 up to about 60 % by weight. Spray drying at such a high total solids content was previously impossible because the structure of the concentrate is destroyed during homogenisation. For example the viscosity of a 60 % solids by weight milk concentrate is approximately one order of magnitude (10 x) higher when the milk is homogenized at 60 % concentration by weight compared to the viscosity with homogenization about mid-way the evaporation*<br>
Description of the drawings<br>
The following drawings where parts and percentages are by weight illustrate the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 gives the state of apparent dynamic viscosity (mPa. s) plotted against homogenisation pressure (bar) at different solid concentrations (whole 50, 55 and 60 % by weight total solids, TS) for the homogenisation of milk concentrate at 28 % fat in solid matter after evaporation and serves as a reference and skim milk at 50 and 55 % TS for comparison and<br>
Fig. 2 gives the state of apparent dynamic viscosity (mPa. s) plotted against solids concentration (%) under different homogenisation conditions (without homogenisation and at 80+20,120+30 and 200+50 bar) for the homogenisation of milk preconcentrate at 28 % fat in solid matter at mid-way the concentration according to the invention. In the figures, in-line milk viscosity measurements were carried out as follows:<br>
]1  Basic principle<br><br>
In laminar flows (with a Reynolds number less than approximately 2100), the application of either Newton!s second law, Navier Stokes equations, the energy equation or dimensional analysis, to an incompressible fluid flowing in a circular pipe of length / and radius r centred on the axis of the pipe of diameter D, allows to define the Hagen-Poiseuille equation (Munson et al, Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1990) which links the apparent viscosity (r|, Pa.s) to the pressure drop (AP, Pa):<br><br>
where Q is the flow rate (m3. s"1), D is the pipe diameter and / is the pipe length (m). Since the results were restricted to laminar flows of Newtonian fluids (with Re numbers 
2, Experimental<br>
Depending on experimental conditions two pipe modules, containing several pipe sections of various lengths and thermally regulated (50 +/- 3°C) by a water circulation, were used. These modules were installed after the evaporation unit and their characteristics are given in Table 1 below:<br><br>
DP &amp; Q values were collected during running periods of 10 min and then averaged. Viscosity was deduced from previous equation.<br><br>
As shown in Fig.l, the homogenisation of concentrated whole milk (28 % fat in solid matter) with solids concentration above 50 % by weight (TS) leads to strong increase in its apparent dynamic viscosities, which is not the case for skim milk.<br>
In Fig- 2, the homogenisation of milk (28 % fat in solid matter) mid way the concentration results in moderate viscosities after finishing the concentration to solids concentrations above 50 % by weight and the effect of homogenisation pressures is moderate.<br>
After homogenisation, the milk concentrate is once again fed into the evaporator where it is finally concentrated.<br>
Once evaporation is complete, spray drying of the milk concentrate can be carried out preferably with high pressure swirl nozzles which are disposed to the hot air flow in the drying tower. The atomisation pressure is of about 80 to about 250 bar, preferably of about 140 to about 150 bar. Preferably, the atomisation temperature of the concentrate is about 72 °C.<br>
In order to instantise the powder, lecithination with agglomeration of the recirculated fines can be carried out in the dryer, or lecithination can be carried out separately from the drying tower in an after-drier, e.g in a fluidised bed.<br>
The processing of the milk powder after the atomisation step comprising after-drying, after-cooling, storage, filling into cans or boxes and gassing is then completed according to the standard known to experts in the field.<br>
Embodiments of the invention are now described by way of example only. In the following Examples, parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated.<br>
Example 1<br>
4255 kg of untreated whole milk containing 4.08 % fat and 8.55 % non-fat milk solids and 711 kg skimmed milk containing 0.1 % fat and 8.9 % non-fat solids were mixed in a tank to form 4966 kg of standardised milk with 3-5 % fat and 8.6 % non-fat solids.<br><br>
The mixture was passed by a centrifugal pump through a plate-type heat exchanger in which it was preheated to 40 - 45° C and it was then clarified in a centrifugal separator. The clarified mixture was pasteurised, first by indirect heating in a plate heat exchanger at maximum 85° C with a holding time of 50 s or less at that temperature, and subsequently by direct steam injection at minimum 105° C with a holding time of minimum 5 s.<br>
The pasteurised liquid was then fed to the first effects of a multiple effect falling film evaporator to obtain a preconcentrate with a solid content of 35 %. The temperature of milk vapour in the exhaust duct of the separator of the first effect was up to 72° C.<br>
After heating the preconcentrate to 60 - 75° C in a plate heat exchanger, it was then passed through an homogeniser in which it was homogenised in two stages, first under a pressure of 120 bar and then under a pressure of 30 bar.<br>
The homogenised mixture was then delivered with a pump to the last effects of the falling-film evaporator in which it was finally concentrated to a dry matter content of 55 %. It was then taken up by a high pressure pump and spray dried in a drying tower by high pressure swirl nozzles at a pressure of 140 bar and a temperature of 72° C It was agglomerated and lecithinated to achieve instantisation, after-dried, after-cooled, filled into packs and gassed.<br>
The powder had excellent reconstitution and physico-chemical characteristics. When compared to a conventional whole milk powder produced from a concentrate from the evaporator of 49 % solids content the powder structure was coarser with less fines of dimension under 100 micron.<br>
In the following Table 2, the consumer perceivable reconstitution properties of the powder of Example 1 (55 % TS of the concentrate after evaporation) are given in comparison to a reference (50-51 % TS of the concentrate after evaporation) using different tests. The tests were carried out as follows:<br><br>
Wet: This is a test to evaluate the wettability of milk powders by measuring the sinkability time (in s.) of the powder into water at 20° C (Wett 20) and at 40° C (Wctt 40), according to IDF-Standard 87:1979.<br>
Misc: Also called sludge test, estimates the miscibility of milk powders by visual evaluation of the amount of undissolved milk powder (lumps) after powder reconstitution at 20° C (Misc 20) and at 40° C (Misc 40), and the suspension is poured through a preweighed screen which is reweighed after draining and removing of any liquid residues(J. Pisecky, Handbook of Milk Powder Manufacture, Niro A/S DK-2860 Soeborg, Denmark). The results are expressed in scale value from 0 (best) to 5.<br>
SOD: State of dissolution, als-: called slowly dispersible particles (SDP) test determines the amount of undissolved small particles in the milk after reconstitution of milk powders. This test is conducted simultaneously with sludge determination (Misc above) using the liquid from the screen filtration and comparing the film on the wall of a test tube with that of the test index standard photo. SOD 20 and SOD 40 respectively mean that the test is carried out at 20° C, respectively at 40° C. The results are expressed in scale value from 0 (best) to 5.<br>
W.S.: White specks test, also called White flecks number (IDF standards 174:1995, J. Pisecky, Handbook of Milk Powder Manufacture, Niro A/S DK-2860 Soeborg, Denmark), is for the estimation of the white flecks, i.e. tiny flakes floating in the reconstituted solution. After being allowed to stand for several min., the flakes rise to the surface forming a thin layer and are visually detected. The results are expressed in scale value from 0 (best) to 5.<br><br><br>
As shown inTable 2 above, the consumer perceived properties of the reconstituted milk powder of the process of the inventon were similar or even better than those of the reference.<br>
►        In following Table 3, further characteristics of the powder of the process of the invention are given in comparison to the reference (50-51 % TS of the concentrate after evaporation) using different tests. The tests were carried out as follows:<br><br>
Free Fat: The free fat levels in instant milk powder are determined by cold extraction of the powder with hexane at 20° C slowly poured over a filtration setup containing the powder, connected to a water-jet vacuum pump, so that the solvent passes through the filter by gravity. The filtrate is concentrated to dryness and the free fat weighed. The results are expressed as weight % free fat in the powder.<br>
Homogenisation degree and Sediment: The homogenisation (homo) degree is calculated from the fat content before and after centrifugation of a solution with a dry matter content of 13 % by weight, expressed as weight % (F. Kiermeier et al, "Milch und Milcherzeugnisse, Verlag" Paul Parey, Berlin, 314 (1973)). The sediment of reconsituted milk powder is measured by the gravimetric determination of the deposit after centrifugation, expressed as weight % of the powder.<br>
Viscosity: The viscosity of the reconstituted powder is determined by means of the Haake RS 100/Plate-cone/35 mm/4° viscometer at a shear rate of 100 s"1 at 25° C and expressed in mPa.s.<br><br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The method of Example 1 was carried out with the difference that the intermediate homogenisation, i.e. the homogenisation of the preconcentrate had a pressure of the first stage of 150 bar and a pressure of the second stage of 30 bar.<br>
The quality of the powder was comparable to that obtained in Example 1,<br><br><br><br><br>
