The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention, for example an ester, which on administration to a mammal such as, for example, a human is able to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives also include prodrugs of the compounds of the<br><br>
invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull. 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not.<br>
The compounds of the rrvenaor may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous &amp;nd crysnsi&amp;ie polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the inversion belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
Use<br>
This invention relates further to the use of compounds of the formula I and their pharmaceutical compositions as PPAR ligands. The PPAR ligands of the invention are suitable as modulators of PPAR activity.<br>
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR) are transcription factors which can be activated by ligands and belong to the class of nuclear hormone receptors. There are three PPAR isoforms, PPARalpha, PPARgamma and PPARdelta (identical to PPARbeta), which are encoded by different genes (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR): structure, mechanisms of activation and diverse functions: Motojima K., Cell Struct Funct, 1993, 18(5), 267-77).<br>
In humans, PPARgamma exists in three variants, PPARgamma,, gamma2, and gamma3, which are the result of alternative use of promoters and differential mRNA splicing. Different PPARs have different tissue distribution and modulate different physiological functions. The PPARs play a key role in various aspects of the regulation of a large number of genes, the products of which genes are directly or indirectly crucially involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. Thus, for example, the<br><br>
PPARaipha receptor plays an important part in the regulation of fatty acid catabolism or lipoprotein metabolism in the liver, while PPARgamma is crucially involved for example in regulating adipose cell differentiation. In addition, however, PPARs are also involved in the regulation of many other physiological processes, including those which are not directly connected with carbohydrate or lipid metabolism. The activity of different PPARs can be modulated by various fatty acids, fatty acid derivatives and synthetic compounds to varying extents. For relevant reviews about functions, physiological effects and pathophysiology, see: Berger, J. et alM Annu. Rev. Med.,<br>
2002,	53, 409-435; Wilson, T. et aL, J. Med. Chem., 2000, 43 (4), 527-550; Kliewer, S.<br>
et al., Recent Prog Horm Res., 2001, 56, 239-63; Moller, D.E. and Berger, J.P., Int J<br>
Obes Relat Metab Disord., 2003, 27 Suppl 3, 17-21; Ram, V.J., Drugs Today, 2003,<br>
39(8),609-32).<br>
Among the three PPAR-isoforms the physiological functions of PPARdelta have long remained an enigma. The first proposed pharmacological role for PPARdelta has been the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. It was shown that the somewhat selective PPARdelta ligand L-165041 raises plasma cholesterol in a diabetic animal model (Berger J. et alM J. Biol. Chem., 1999, 274, 6718-6725; Leibowitz M.D. et aL, FEBS Lett., 2000,473(3), 333-336). In obese, insulin resistant rhesus monkeys, the potent and selective PPARdelta ligand GW501516 raises HDL-cholesterol, decreases plasma LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin levels (Oliver, W. et aL, Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL, 2001, 98, 5306-5311). The dual PPARdelta/PPARalpha agonist YM-16638 significantly lowers plasma lipids in rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys (Goto, S. et aL, Br. J. Pharm., 1996,118,174-178) and acts in a similar manner in two weeks clinical trials in healthy volunteers (Shimokawa, T. et aL, Drug Dev. Res., 1996, 38, 86-92). More recent publications underline that PPARdelta is an important target for the treatment of dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis and syndrom X (Wang,Y-X. et aL, Cell, 2003, 113, 159-170; Luquet, S. et aL, FASEB JM<br>
2003,	17, 209-226 ; Tanaka, T. et aL, PNAS, 2003, 100, .15924-15929 ; Hoist, D. et al.,<br>
 BioChem. Biophys. Acta, 2003,1633, 43-50; Dressel, U. et aL, Mol. Endocrin., 2003,<br>
17, 2477-2493 ; Lee, C.H. et aL, Science, 2003, 302, 453-457).<br><br>
Besides its actions as a regulator of the lipid-, glucose- and cholesterol-metabolism PPARdelta is known to play a rote in embryonic development, implantation and bone formation (Urn, H. and Dey, S.K, Trends Endocrinol Metab,, 2000,11(4),137-42; Ding, N.Z. et a!., Mol Reprod Dev., 2003. 86(3), 218-24; Mano, H. et al., J Biol Chem., 2000, 275(11), 8126-32).<br>
Numerous publications demonstate that PPARdelta is triggering proliferation and differentiation of keratinocvfes which points to its role in skin disorders and wound healing (Di-Poi, N. et al., J Steroid Biochem Mol Biol., 2003, 85(2-5), 257-65; Tan, N.S. et al., Am J Clin Dermatol., 2003,4(8), 523-30; Wahli, W., Swiss Med Wkly., 2002, 132(7-8),83-91).<br>
PPARdelta appears to be significantly expressed in the CNS; however much of its function there still remains undiscovered. Of singular interest however, is the discovery that PPARdelta was expressed in rodent oligodendrocytes, the major lipid producing cells of the CNS (J. Granneman, et al., J. Neurosci. Res., 1998, 51, 563-573). Moreover, ft was also found that a PPARdelta selective agonist was found to significantly increase oligodendroglial myelin gene expression and myelin sheath diameter in mouse cultures (I. Saluja et al., Glia, 2001, 33, 194-204). Thus, PPARdelta activators may be of use for the treatment of demyelinating and dysmyelinating diseases.<br>
Demyelinating conditions are manifested in loss of myelin - the multiple dense layers of lipids and protein which cover many nerve fibers. These layers are provided by oligodendroglia in the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In patie/rts with demyelinating conditions, demyelination may be irreversible; it is usually accompanied or followed by axonal degeneration, and often by cellular degeneration. Demyelination can occur as a result of neuronal damage or damage to the myelin itself - whether due to aberrant immune responses, local injury, ischemia, metabolic disorders, toxic agents, or viral infections (Prineas and McDonald, Demyelinating Diseases. In Greenfield's Neuropathology, 6.sup.th ed. (Edward Arnold: New York, 1997)813-811, Beers and Berkow, eds., The Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy, 17.sup.th ed. (Whitehouse Station, N.J.: Merck Research Laboratories, 1999) 1299, 1437, 1473-76, 1483).<br><br>
Central demyelination (demyelination of the CNS) occurs in several conditions, often of uncertain etiology, that have come to be known as the primary demyelinating diseases. Of these, multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most prevalent. Other primary demyelinating diseases include adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), adrenomyeloneuropathy, AIDS-vacuolar myelopathy, HTLV-associated myelopathy, Leber's hereditary optic atrophy, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, Guillian-Barre syndrome and tropical spastic paraparesis. In addition, there are acute conditions in which demyelination can occur in the CNS, e.g., acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) and acute viral encephalitis. Furthermore, acute transverse myelitis, a syndrome in which an acute spinal cord transection of unknown cause affects both gray and white matter in one or more adjacent thoracic segments, can also result in demyelination. Also, disorders in which myelin forming glial cells are damaged including spinal cord injuries, neuropathies and nerve injury.<br>
The present invention relates to compounds of the formula I suitable for modulating the activity of PPARs, especially the activity of PPARdelta and PPARalpha. Depending on the modulation profile, the compounds of the formula I are suitable for the treatment, control and prophylaxis of the indications described hereinafter, and for a number of other pharmaceutical applications connected thereto (see, for example, Berger, J., et al., Annu. Rev. Med., 2002, 53, 409-435; Wilson, T. et ah, J. Med. Chem., 2000,43(4), 527-550; Kliewer, S. et al., Recent Prog Horm Res., 2001, 56, 239-63; Fruchart, J.C. et al., 2001, Pharmacological Research, 44(5), 345-52; Kersten, S. et a!., Nature, 2000, 405,421-424; Torra, LP. et al., Curr Opin Lipidol, 2001,12, 245-254).<br>

Formulations<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.001 mg to 100 mg (typically from 0.01 mg to 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of bodyweight, for example 0.1-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.001 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram and per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1 ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, ampules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, capsules or tablets, may contain, for example, from 0.05 to 1000 mg, typically from 0.5 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutical^ active substances may likewise be present, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br><br>

Determination of EC50 values of PPAR agonists in the cellular PPARalpha assay<br>
i<br>
Principle<br>
The potency of substances which bind to human PPARalpha and activate it in an agonistic manner is analyzed using a stably transfected HEK cell line (HEK= human<br>
: embryo kidney) which is referred to here as PPARalpha reporter cell line. It contains two genetic elements, a luctferase reporter element (pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo) and a PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD) which mediates expression of the luciferase reporter element depending on a PPARalpha iigand. The stably and constitutively expressed fusion protein GR-GAL4-humanPPARalpha-LBD<br>
) binds in the cell nucleus of the PPARalpha reporter cell line via the GAL4 protein portion to the GAL4 DNA binding motifs 5'-upstream of the luciferase reporter element which is stably integrated in the genome of the cell line. There is only weak expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the absence of a PPARalpha Iigand if fatty acid-depleted fetal calf serum (cs-FCS) is used in the assay. PPARalpha ligands bind and<br>
; activate the PPARalpha fusion protein and thereby stimulate the expression of the luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase which is formed can be detected by means of chemiluminescence via an appropriate substrate.<br>
Construction of the PPARalpha reporter cell line ) The PPARalpha reporter cell line was prepared in two stages. Firstly, the luciferase reporter element was constructed and stably transfected into HEK cells. For this<br><br>
purpose, five binding sites of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # AF264724) were cloned in 5'-upstream of a 68 bp-long minimal MMTV promoter (Accession # V01175). The minima! MMTV promoter section contains a CCAAT box and a TATA element m order fc enable efficient transcription by RNA polymerase II. The cloning and sec^jancing of the GAL4-MMTV construct took place in analogy to the description of Sambrook J. st al (Kfotecular cloning, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1989). Then the compters Pbo&amp;ius pyralis gene (Accession # M15077) was cloned in 3'-downstream of the GAL4-4IMTV element. After sequencing, the luciferase reporter element consisting of five GAL4 binding sites, MMTV promoter and luciferase gene was recloned ink* a plescnati wrier confers zeocin resistance in order to obtain the plasmid pdeltaM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo. This vector was transfected into HEK cells in accordance with the statements in Ausubel, F.M. et al. (Current protocols in molecular biology, Vol. 1-3, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1995). Then zeocin-containing medium (0.5 mg/ml) was used to select a suitable stable cell clone which showed very low basal expression of the luceiiferase gene.<br>
In a second step, the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARaIpha-LBD was introduced into the stable cell clone described. For this purpose, initially the cDNA coding for the N-termina! 76 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor (Accession # P04150) was linked to the cDNA section coding for amino acids 1 -147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # P04386). The cDNA of the ligand-binding domain of the human PPARalpha receptor (amino acids S167-Y468; Accession # S74349) was cloned in at the 3'-end of this GR-GAL4 construct. The fusion construct prepared in this way (GR-GAL4~humanPPARalpha-LBD) was recloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (invitrogen) in order to enable constitutive expression therein by the cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease and stably transfected into the previously described cell clone containing the luciferase reporter element. The finished PPARalpha reporter cell line which contains a luciferase reporter element and constitutively expresses the PPARalpha fusion protein (GR-GAL4-human PPARalpha-LBD) was isolated by selection with zeocin (0.5 mg/ml) and ' G418 (0.5 mg/ml).<br><br>
ssay procedure<br>
he activity of PPARalpha agonists is determined in a 3-day assay which is described elow:<br>
)ay1<br>
"he PPARalpha reporter cell line is cultivated to 80% confluence in DMEM (# 41965-I39, Invitrogen) which is mixed with the following additions: 10% cs-FCS (fetal calf ;erum; #SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 0.5 mg/ml zeocin (#R250-01, Invitrogen), 0.5 mg/ml 5418 (#10131-027, Invitrogen), 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution (#15140-122, nvitrogen) and 2 mM L-giutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen). The cultivation takes )lace in standard cell culture bottles (# 353112, Becton Dickinson) in a cell culture ncubator at 37DC in the presence of 5% CO2. The 80%-confluent cells are washed )nce with 15 ml of PBS (#14190-094, Invitrogen), treated with 3 ml of trypsin solution #25300-054, invitrogen) at 37°C for 2 min, taken up in 5 ml of the DMEM described and counted in a cell counter. After dilution to 500.000 cells/ml, 35,000 cells are seeded in each well of a 96 well microtiter plate with a clear plastic base (#3610, doming Costar). The plates are incubated in the cell culture incubator at 37°C and 5% Z02 for 24 h.<br>
Day 2<br>
PPARalpha agonists to be tested are dissolved in DMSO in a concentration of 10 mM. This stock solution is diluted in DMEM (#41965-039, Invitrogen) which is mixed with 5% cs-FCS (#SH-30068.03, Hyclone), 2 mM L-glutamine (#25030-024, Invitrogen) and the previously described antibiotics (zeocin, G418, penicillin and streptomycin). Test substances are tested in 11 different concentrations in the range from 10 \iM to 100 pM, More potent compounds are tested in concentration ranges from 1 pM to 10 pM or between 100 nM and 1 pM.<br>
The medium of the PPARalpha reporter cell line seeded on day 1 is completely removed by aspiration, and the test substances diluted in medium are immediately added to the cells. The dilution and addition of the substances is carried out by a robot (Beckman FX). The final volume of the test substances diluted in medium is 100 pi per<br><br>
well of a 96 well microtiter plate. The DMSO concentration in the assay is less than 0.1 % v/v in order to avoid cytotoxic effects of the solvent.<br>
Each plate was charged with a standard PPARalpha agonist, which was likewise diluted in 11 different coricentrsooos- in order to demonstrate the functioning of the assay in each indivktal plas. The assay plates are incubated in an incubator at 37°C and 5% C02 for 24 h.<br>
Day 3<br>
The PPARalpha reporter cells treated with the test substances are removed from the incubator, and the medium e qsptrarari off. The cells are lyzed by pipetting 50 pi of Bright Glo reagent (from Promega) into each well of a 96 well microtiter plate. After incubation at room temperature in the dark for 10 minutes, the microtiter plates are measured in the luminometer (Trilux from Wallac). The measuring time for each well of a microtiter plate is 1 sec.<br>
Evaluation<br>
The raw data from the luminometer are transferred into a Microsoft Excel file. Dose-effect plots and EC50 values of PPAR agonists are calculated using the XLFit program as specified by ihe manufacturer (IDBS).<br>
Principle<br>
The potency of substances which bind to human PPARdelta and activate it in an agonistic manner is analyzed using a stably transfected HEK cell line (HEK= human embryo kidney) which is referred to here as PPARdelta reporter cell line. In analogy to the assay described for PPARalpha, the PPARdelta reporter cell line also contains two genetic elements, a luciferase reporter element (pde!taM-GAL4-Luc-Zeo) and a PPARdelta fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARdelta-LBD) which mediates expression of the luciferase reporter element depending on a PPARdelta ligand. The stably and constitutively expressed fusion protein GR-GAL4-humanPPARdeIta-LBD binds in the cell nucleus of the PPARdelta reporter cell line via the GAL4 protein<br><br>
portion to the GAL4 DNA binding motifs 5'-upstream of the luciferase reporter element which is stably integrated in the genome of the cell line. There is only little expression of the luciferase reporter gene in the absence of a PPARdelta ligand if fatty acid-depleted fetal calf serum (cs-FCS) is used in the assay. PPARdelta ligands bind and activate the PPARdelta fusion protein and thereby stimulate expression of the luciferase reporter gene. The luciferase which is formed can be detected by means of chemiluminescence via an appropriate substrate.<br>
Construction of the PPARdelta reporter cell line<br>
The production of the stable PPARdelta reporter cell line is based on a stable HEK-cell clone which was stably transfected with a luciferase reporter element. This step was already described above in the section "construction of the PPARalpha reporter cell line". In a second step, the PPARdelta fusion protein (GR-GAL4-humanPPARdelta-LBR was stably introduced into this cell clone. For this purpose, the cDNA coding for the N-terminal 76 amino acids of the glucocorticoid receptor (Accession # P04150) was linked to the cDNA section coding for amino acids 1-147 of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 (Accession # P04386). The cDNA of the ligand-binding domain of the human PPARdelta receptor (amino acids S139-Y441; Accession # L07592) was cloned in at the 3'-end of this GR-GAL4 construct. The fusion construct prepared in this way (GR-GAL4-humanPPARdelta-LBD) was recloned into the plasmid pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) in order to enable constitutive expression by the cytomegalovirus promoter. This plasmid was linearized with a restriction endonuclease and stably transfected into the previously described cell clone containing the luciferase reporter element. The resulting PPARdelta reporter cell line which contains a luciferase reporter element and constitutively expresses the PPARdelta fusion protein (GR-GAL4-human PPARdelta-LBD) was isolated by selection with zeocin (0.5 mg/ml) and G418 (0.5 mg/ml).<br>
' Assay procedure and evaluation<br>
The activity of PPARdelta agonists is determined in a 3-day assay in exact analogy to<br><br>
the procedure already described for the PPARaipha reporter cell line except that the PPARdelta reporter cell line and a spedfic PPARdelta agonist was used as a standard to control test efficacy.<br>
