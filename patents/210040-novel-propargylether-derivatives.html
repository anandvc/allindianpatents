It relates to the preparation of those substances and to agrochemical compositions comprising at least one of those compounds as active ingredient. The invention relates also to the preparation of the said compositions and to the use of the compounds or of the compositions in controlling or preventing the infestation of plants by phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi.<br><br>
R10 is optionally substituted aryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl,<br>
R11 is hydrogen or optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl,<br>
Z is hydrogen -CO-Ri6, -COOR16, -CO-COOR16 or -CONR16RI7J<br>
R12 is hydrogen, or optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl,<br>
R13 is hydrogen or alkyl,<br>
R14 is hydrogen, alkyl, cycloaikyl or cycloalkyl-alkyl,<br>

and<br><br>
R16 and R17 are independently of each other hydrogen, optionally substituted alkyl, optionally substituted cycioalkyl, optionally substituted aryl or optionally substituted heteroaryl.<br>
In the above definition aryl includes aromatic hydrocarbon rings like phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, phenanthrenyl and biphenyl like 1,3-biphenyl and 1,4-biphenyl, with phenyl being preferred.<br>
Heteroaryl stands for aromatic ring systems comprising mono-, bi- or tricyclic systems wherein at least one oxygen, nitrogen or sulfur atom is present as a ring member. Examples are furyl, thienyl, pyrrolyl, imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, oxadiazolyl, thiadiazolyl, triazolyl, tetrazolyl, pyridyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, pyrazinyl, triazinyl, tetrazinyl, indolyl, benzothiophenyl, benzofuranyl, benzimidazolyl, indazolyl, benzotriazolyl, benzothiazolyl, benzoxazolyl, quinolinyl, isoquinolinyl, phthalazinyl, quin-oxalinyl, quinazolinyl, cinnolinyl and naphthyridinyl.<br>
The above aryl and heteroaryl groups may be optionally substituted. This means they may carry one or more identical or different substituents. Normally not more than three substituents are present at the same time. Examples of substituents of aryl or heteroaryl groups are: alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, cycioalkyl, cycloalkyl-alkyl, phenyl and phenyl-alkyl, it being possible in turn for all of the preceding groups to carry one or more identical or different halogen atoms; alkoxy; alkenyloxy; alkynyloxy; alkoxyalkyl; haloalkoxy, alkylthio; haloalkylthio; alkylsulfonyl; formyl; alkanoyl; hydroxy; halogen; cyano; nitro; amino; alkylamino; dialkylamino; carboxy; alkoxycarbonyl; alkenyloxycarbonyl; or alkynyloxycarbonyl.<br>
Optionally substituted alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl or cycioalkyl groups may carry one or more substituents selected from halogen, alkyl, alkoxy, alkylthio, nitro, cyano, hydroxy, mercapto, alkylcarbonyl or alkoxycarbonyl. Preferably, the number of substituents is no more than three with the exception of halogen, where the alkyl groups may be perhalogenated. In the above definitions "halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine. The alkyl, alkenyl and alkynyl radicals may be straight-chain or branched. This applies also to the alkyl, alkenyl or alkynyl parts of other alkyl-, alkenyl- or alkynyl-containing groups. Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkyl on its own or as part of another substituent is to be understood as being, for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl and the isomers thereof, for example isopropyl, isobutyl, tert-butyl or sec-butyl, isopentyl ortert-pentyl.<br><br>
Cycloalkyl is, depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, cyclopropyl, cyclo-butyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, cycloheptyl or cyclooctyl.<br>
Depending upon the number of carbon atoms mentioned, alkenyl as a group or as a structural element of other groups is to be understood as being, for example, ethenyl, allyl, 1-propenyl, buten-2-yi, buten-3-yl, penten-1-yl, penten-3-yl, hexen-1-yl, 4-methyl-3-pentenyl or 4-methyl-3-hexenyl.<br>
Alkynyl as a group or as a structural element of other groups is, for example, ethynyl, propyn-1-yl, propyn-2-yl, butyn-1-yl, butyn-2-yl, 1-methyl-2-butynyl, hexyn-1-yl, 1-ethyl-2-butynyl or octyn-1-yl.<br>
A haloalkyl group may contain one or more (identical or different) halogen atoms, and for example may stand for CHCI2, CH2F, CCI3, CH2CI, CHF2, CF3j CH2CH2Br, C2CI5, CH2Br, CHCIBr, CF3CH2, etc..<br>
The presence of at least one asymmetric carbon atom in the compounds of formula I means that the compounds may occur in optically isomeric and enantiomeric forms. As a result of the presence of a possible aliphatic C=C double bond, geometric isomerism may also occur. Formula I is intended to include all those possible isomeric forms and mixtures thereof.<br>

Certain amino acid carbamates, mandelic acid derivatives and alkoximino acetic acid derivatives have been proposed for controlling plant-destructive fungi (for example in EP-A-398072, WO 94/29267 and WO 96/23763). The action of those preparations is not, however, satisfactory in all aspects of agricultural needs. Surprisingly, with the compound structure of formula I, new kinds of microbicides having a high level of activity have been found.<br>
The propargylether derivatives of formula I may be obtained according to one of the processes of Schemes 1 to 5:<br><br><br>

Carboxy-activated derivatives of the acid of formula II are all compounds having an activated carboxyl group like an acid halide, such as an acid chloride, like symmetrical or mixed anhydrides, such as mixed anhydrides with O-alkylcarbonates, like activated esters, such as p-nitrophenylesters or N-hydroxysuccinimidesters, as well as in-situ-formed activated forms of the amino acid of formula II with condensating agents, such as dicyciohexylcarbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, benzotriazol-1 -yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1-yl N,N,N\N'-bis(pentamethylene)-uronium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1-yl N,N,N',N,-bis(tetramethylene)uronium hexafluorophosphate, O-benzotriazol-1-yl N,N,N\N'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate or benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate. The mixed anhydrides of the acids of the formula II may be prepared by reaction of an amino acid of formula II with chloroformic acid esters like chloroformic acid alkylesters, such as<br><br>
ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate, optionally in the presence of an organic or inorganic base like a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine, pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine or N-methyl-morpholine.<br>

It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents. The reaction is preformed optionally in the presence of an organic or inorganic base like a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine, pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine or N-methyl-morpholine, like a metal hydroxide or a metal carbonate, preferentially an alkali hydroxide or an alkali carbonate, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide at temperatures ranging from -80°C to +150 °C, preferentially at temperatures ranging from -40°C to +40°C.<br>
The compounds of formula I may then finally be prepared by reacting of a phenol of formula IV wherein R4, R5t R6, R7, Rs and R9 are as defined for formula I with a compound of formula V wherein R1t R2 and R3 are as defined for formula I and wherein Y is a leaving group like a halide such as a chloride or bromide or a sulfonic ester such as a tosylate, mesylate ortriflate (step B).<br>

It is also possible to use mixtures of these solvents. The reaction is performed optionally in the presence of an organic or inorganic base like a tertiary amine, such as triethylamine, N,N-diisopropyl-ethylamine, pyridine, N-methyl-piperidine or N-methyl-morpholine, like a metal hydroxide, a metal carbonate or a metal alkoxide, preferentially an alkali hydroxide, an alkali carbonate or an alkali alkoxide, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, sodium methoxide, potassium methoxide, sodium ethoxide, potassium ethoxide, sodium tert-butoxide or potassium tert-butoxide at temperatures ranging from -80°C to +200°C, preferentially at temperatures ranging from 0°C to +120°C.<br><br><br>

Seebach, G. Adam, T. Gees, M. Schiess, W. Weigang, Chem. Ber. 1988, 121, 507).<br><br>
Step E: An isocyanide of formula VIII wherein R1f R2, R3, R4, Rs, Re, R? and R8 are as defined for formula I is reacted with an aldehyde or ketone of formula IX, wherein R10 and Rn are as defined for formula I in the presence of a carboxylic acid Ri6-COOH wherein R16 is hydrogen or lower alkyl, typically acetic acid, to give a O-acyl-a-hydroxy amide of formula la, wherein R1f R2, R3, R4, R5, Re, R7, Re, Rio and Rn are as defined for formula I, (a three-component Passerini Reaction, J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, 1992, p. 980).<br>
Alternatively an isocyanide of formula VIII wherein R,, R2, R3, R4, R5, Re, R7 and R8 are as defined for formula I is reacted with an aldehyde or ketone of formula IX in the presence of titanium tetrachloride to give an a-hydroxy amide of the formula lb (where R1f R2, R3, R4, R5, Re, R7, Rs, Rio and Rn have the same meaning as defined above) under conditions known per se (Chem. Ber. 1988, 121, 507; O. Ort et al. Pesticide Sci. 1997, 50, 331). Step F: A compound of formula VII, wherein Ru R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7 and R8 are as defined for formula I is treated with one phosgene equivalent (e.g. triphosgene) and a base (e.g. triethylamine) and in a second step, without isolation of the isocyanide intermediate, is further treated with titanium tetrachloride and an aldehyde or ketone of formula IX, wherein R10 and R1t as defined for formula I under conditions known per se (WO 96/17840) to give an a-hydroxy amide of the formula lb, wherein R1( R2, R3, R4, R5, Re, R7, Re, R10 and Rn are as defined for formula I.<br>
Step G: An O-acyl-a-hydroxy amide of formula la wherein Ri, R2, R3l R4, R5, Re, R7, Re, R10, Rn and R16 are as defined above is hydrolyzed to a an a-hydroxy amide of formula lb, wherein R1t R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8l R10 and Rn are as defined for formula I under classical conditions (J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, 1992). Step H: A compound of formula lb wherein R1f R2, R3l R4, R5, Re, R7. Ra, R10 and Rn are as defined for formula I is oxidized by an organic oxidizing agent, e.g. an alkyl hydroperoxide, a DMSO-based reagent (T. T. Tidwell, Org. React, 1990, 39, 297-572), an hypervalent iodine reagent, a dioxirane, a nitroxyl radical; or an inorganic oxidizing agent, e.g. peroxides, hypochlorites, transition metal oxide (e.g. Cr, Mn, Ru, Re, Os), sodium percarbonate, sodium perborate, silver carbonate.<br>
The reaction of the compound of formula lb with the oxidizing agent advantageously takes place in an inert solvent, such as THF, dtchloromethane, water or a ketone, e.g. acetone, or in a mixture thereof, in the absence or in the presence of an acid or in the presence or in the absence of a base, at temperatures between -80°C to +150°C.<br><br>
Step I: A compound of formula Ic wherein R1f R2, R3, R4, Rs, Re, R7, Re and R10 are as defined for formula I is reacted with R12-O-NH2 wherein R12 is as defined above, under classical oximation conditions (e.g. J. March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 4th ed., Wiley, 1992) to give a compound of formula Id wherein R1f R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, Rs, R10 and R12 are as defined above. Furthermore, when R12 is H, compounds of formula Id may be alkylated with Ri2-LG wherein R12 is as defined above (with the exception of H), LG is a leaving group, typically CI, Br, O-tosyl, O-mesyl, in the presence of a base in an inert solvent and at temperature between -20°C to +160°C.<br><br>
Step K: A dioxolanone IX (obtained by the condensation of a mandelic acid with acetone under acid catalysis ( see EP-A-071568)) is subsequently treated with a base such as lithium disoproppylamide (LDA) and an alkylating agent Rn-L according to known procedures (THL 1994, 2891, Rec. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas, DE 4319887). Steps L and M: The resulting dioxolanone X is either heated with the appropriate amine XI at temperatures in between 50-200°C (step L), or the dioxolanone is first hydrolysed in aqueous diluted mineral acid (e.g. HCI) or under basic conditions (aqueous sodium<br><br>
hydroxide (0-120°C; step M) to the substituted hydroxy acid II' which then can be amidated (according to step A of scheme 1). Hydroxy acids IT can also be obtained by reaction of a Grignard reagent R10-HgHal (starting from a aryl-halide and Mg) with an appropriate tx-keto acid ester (Synthesis 1993, 606).<br><br><br>
Step O: An appropriate carboxylic acid ester derivative XII is reacted with a alkyl-<br>

USSR, 21,694(1951)<br>
Step R: A keto-carboxylic acid derivative XIX is transformed with a hydroxylamine<br>
derivative H2NOR12 in inert a solvent according to step I (see scheme 2) to the<br>
corresponding oxime XVIII.<br>

Step U: A keto-carboxylic acid derivative XIX is reduced either with hydrogen in presence<br>
of a catalyst such as Pt02 in a inert solvent like tetrahydrofurane, or with sodium<br>
borohydride at low temperature (-20°C to +60°C) in a solvent such as an alcohol (ethanoi)<br>
or a cyclic ether to the mandelic acid derivative XX. A series of chiral catalysts is described<br>
in the literature in order to obtain enantiomerically pure alcohols (Org. Synth. 63,18 (1984;<br>
JACS 109, 5856; C.R. Stephenson, Advanced Asymm.Synthesis London 1996;<br>
M.Hudlicky. Reductions in Org, Chemistry, ACS Monogr. 188, Washington 1996)<br>
If desired, the alcohol XX may be oxidized with an oxidant (e.g. DMSO/CICOCOCI/ tert.amine; J. Am. Chem. Soc. 108,1035) to the ketone XIX as described for step H (see scheme 2), (M.Hudlicky, Oxidations in Org. Chemistry, ACS Monograph 186, Washington, 1990)<br>
Step V: An aryl derivative XIII is transformed to a keto-carboxylic acid ester XIX by treating it with an oxalic ester derivative L2OC-COOalkyl, where L2 represents a leaving group such as a chlorine atom or an alkoxy radical, in presence of a Lewis acid e.g. AICI3 in a inert solvent such as dichlorobenzene orCS2. (J Med. Chem. 28, 1896). Step W : An aldehyde XV is transformed to the corresponding cyanohydrine by reaction with an alkali cyanide (e.g. KCN) in presence of a sodium hydrogen- sulfite (NaHS03) in an inert solvent such as water; or by reaction with a trialkyl-silylcyanide in presence of a Lewis acid (Znl2).The cyanohydrine or its trialkylsilylester is then hydrolysed in mineral acids such as aqueous hydrochloric acid as described in Org. Synth. Coll. Vol. V, 437 (1973).<br><br>
Step X: An aryl acetic acid ester XVI is hydroxylated by reaction with a derivative of hydrogen peroxide, e.g. bistrimethylsilylhydrogen peroxide in a inert solvent and in presence of a base such as lithium diisopropylamide (LDA) at temperatures between -90°C to +50°C as described in Synth. Comm. 18, 2141 (1988).<br>
Step Y: A dichloro acetophenone XVII is treated with an alkali hydroxide (NaOH) in water as described in EP-A-071568.<br>
Step A': Intermediates XVIII, XIX and XX, where R6' has the meaning of alkyl may be hydrolysed with 1.0 to 1.5 equivalents of aqueous alkali hydroxide in water or in mixtures with an alcohol or tetrahydrofurane leading to the corresponding acids (II", IT", II""). The acids II", IT", II"" may be reacted with the appropriate amine Ilia to obtain the amides I", I'" and I"". The reaction may be directed either via acid chloride in presence pf a base (pyridine or triethylamine) in an inert solvent or preferably directly in combination with an activating agent (e.g. dicyclohexyi carbodiimide, carbonyldiimidazole, or benzotriazole-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino) phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) in a inert solvent and optionally in presence of a base (tert. amine), according to M. Bodansky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis; M. Bodansky, The Practice of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag Berlin 1994) as indicated for step A (see scheme 1).<br>
Intermediates XVIII, XIX and XX, where R6' stands for alkyl can also directly be reacted with an amine Ilia with or without a higher boiling solvent at temperatures in between 70-240°C according to WO 94/29267.<br><br><br>
Step Z: A carboxylic acid derivative XXII having a leaving group X^ is cross-coupled according to the Suzuki-methodology with an arylboronic acid or -ester XXIII to build a biphenyl derivative XXI (Synth. Comm.11, 513 (1981); Acta Chem. Scand. 47, 221; Chem. Rev. 95, 2457; Heterocycles 34, 1395) in presence of a base (alkali carbonate, alkali fluoride (e.g. CsF), tert. amine (ethyl diisopropylamine or Buchwalds' ligand (2'-dicyclohexylphosphanyl-biphenyl-2-yl)-dimethylamine) and a palladium catalyst (e.g. PdP(Ph)4, Pd(OAc)2; (PPh)3PdCI2) in an inert solvent (benzene, toluene, acetonitrile, dioxane, water, aliphatic alcohols) at 0-150°C.<br>
Step A: The resulting carboxylic acid derivative XXI is then amidated to If as described for step A (see scheme 1). Direct amidation of XXII leads to the final products la-lf.<br>
The compounds of formula I are oils or solids at room temperature and are distinguished by valuable microbicidal properties. They can be used in the agricultural sector or related fields<br><br>
preventively and curatively in the control of plant-destructive microorganisms. The compounds of formula I according to the invention are distinguished at low rates of concentration not only by outstanding microbicidal, especially fungicidal, activity but also by being especially well tolerated by plants.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the compounds of formula I have for practical purposes a very advantageous biocidal spectrum in the control of phytopathogenic microorganisms, especially fungi. They possess very advantageous curative and preventive properties and are used in the protection of numerous crop plants. With the compounds of formula I it is possible to inhibit or destroy phytopathogenic microorganisms that occur on various crops of useful plants or on parts of such plants (fruit, blossom, leaves, stems, tubers, roots), while parts of the plants which grow later also remain protected, for example, against phytopathogenic fungi.<br>
The novel compounds of formula I prove to be effective against specific genera of the fungus class Fungi imperfecti (e.g. Cercospora), Basidiomycetes (e.g. Puccinia) and Ascomycetes (e.g. Erysiphe and Venturia) and especially against Oomycetes (e.g. Plasmopara, Peronospora, Pythium and Phytophthora). They therefore represent in plant protection a valuable addition to the compositions for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. The compounds of formula I can also be used as dressings for protecting seed (fruit, tubers, grains) and plant cuttings from fungal infections and against phytopathogenic fungi that occur in the soil.<br>
The invention relates also to compositions comprising compounds of formula I as active ingredient, especially plant-protecting compositions, and to the use thereof in the agricultural sector or related fields.<br>
In addition, the present invention includes the preparation of those compositions, wherein the active ingredient is homogeneously mixed with one or more of the substances or groups of substances described herein. Also included is a method of treating plants which is distinguished by the application of the novel compounds of formula I or of the novel compositions.<br><br>
Target crops to be protected within the scope of this invention comprise, for example, the following species of plants: cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize, sorghum and related species); beet (sugar beet and fodder beet); pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit (apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries, strawberries, raspberries and blackberries); leguminous plants (beans, lentils, peas, soybeans); oil plants (rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil plants, cocoa beans, groundnuts); cucurbi-taceae (marrows, cucumbers, melons); fibre plants (cotton, flax, hemp, jute); citrus fruit (oranges, lemons, grapefruit, mandarins); vegetables (spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes, paprika); lauraceae (avocado, cinnamon, camphor) and plants such as tobacco, nuts, coffee, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas and natural rubber plants, and also ornamentals.<br>
The compounds of formula I are normally used in the form of compositions and can be applied to the area or plant to be treated simultaneously or in succession with other active ingredients. Those other active ingredients may be fertilisers, micronutrient donors or other preparations that influence plant growth. It is also possible to use selective herbicides or insecticides, fungicides, bactericides, nematicides, molluscicides or mixtures of several of those preparations, if desired together with further carriers, surfactants or other application-promoting adjuvants customarily employed in formulation technology.<br>

b)	Systemic action<br>
2-3 week old potato plants (Bintje variety) are watered with a spray mixture (0.02 % active ingredient based on the volume of the soil) prepared from a wettable powder formulation of the test compound. Care is taken that the spray mixture does not come into contact with the parts of the plants that are above the ground. After 48 hours, the treated plants are infected with a sporangia suspension of the fungus. Fungus infestation is evaluated after incubation of the infected plants for 4 days at 90-100 % relative humidity and +20°C. Fungal infestation is effectively controlled with compounds of Tables 1 to 47.<br><br>
