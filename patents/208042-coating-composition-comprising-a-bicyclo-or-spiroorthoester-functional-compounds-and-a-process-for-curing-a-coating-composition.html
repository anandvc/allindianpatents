				<td> <br><br><br><br>
The invention pertains to a coating composition comprising a first compound comprising at least one bicycle- or spiro-orthoester group.<br>
The use of compounds comprising bicyclo-orthoester groups in coating compositions is known from US patent publication No. 4.338,240. In this patent publication the use and the preparation of bicyclo-orthoester-functional compounds (hereinafter bicyclo-orthoester will be abbreviated to BOE) is described. Described are. e.g.. BOE-functional compounds, which are the adduct of two compounds comprising one hydroxyl group and one BOE group and one compound comprising two isocyanate groups. The compounds are cross-linked by means of cationic ring opening homopolymerisation of the BOE groups. In that case, however, the presence of moisture has to be excluded. Furthermore, energy in the form of ultraviolet, infrared or microwave irradation or heat has to be supplied during the polymerisation process.<br>
The invention now provides a coating composition of the aforementioned type which is free of said drawbacks. For that reason the coating composition mentioned in the opening paragraph is characterised in that it comprises a second compound comprising at least two hydroxyl-reactive groups.<br>
A coating composition comprising a compound comprising at least one bicycle- or spiro-orthoester group (hereinafter spiro-orthoester will be abbreviated to SOE) is a composition having latent hydroxyl groups. In the presence of water or moisture from the air the BOE or SOE groups will be hydrolysed, forming hydroxyl groups. This reaction is also known as deblocking. During deblocking few if any volatile components are released.<br><br>
When the BOE- or SOE-group is deblocked in this manner, it is not possible to obtain a homopolymer of BOE- or SOE groups by cationic polymerization. However, it has now been found that when a second compound comprising at least two hydroxyl-reactive groups is present in the composition, the deblocked hydroxyl groups can react with the hydroxyl-reactive groups to give a cross-linked polymer.<br>
BOE- and SOE-functional compounds may be used as main binders or as reactive diluents in the coating compositions of the present invention.<br>
The use of compounds comprising BOE or SOE groups in coating compositions has several advantages over the use of compounds having free hydroxyl groups, such as hydroxyl-functional reactive diluents, hydroxyl-functional main binders, e.g, polyester polyols and acrylate polyols. and even compounds where the BOE or SOE groups have already been hydrolysed.<br>
Firstly, the viscosity of compounds comprising BOE or SOE groups is lower than that of the corresponding hydrolysed compounds, in consequence, less viscosity-reducing solvent which evaporates in air Is needed in the coating composition.<br>
Secondly, because of the stability of the BOE- and SOE-functional compounds the pot life:drying time ratio of compositions according to the invention is particularly favourable, for hydrolysis only takes place in the presence of water or moisture.<br>
Thirdly, in coating compositions of the present invention BOE- and SOE-functional compounds have the advantage that hydrolysis of the BOE or<br><br>
SOE group produces a substantial increase in the composition's viscosity. A high viscosity will give reduced sagging of the coating composition on the substrate.<br>
Finally, it has been found that the coating compositions of the present invention provide a high build behavior.<br>
By BOE groups are meant in this connection groups having a structure according to formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
X and Z are independently from each other selected from linear or .   branched alk(en)ylene groups with 1-4 carbon atoms optionally containing<br>
an oxygen or a nitrogen atom;<br>
Y is nothing or is selected independently of X and Z from linear or branched    alk(en)ylene groups with 1-4 carbon atoms optionally containing an oxygen<br>
or a nitrogen atom;<br>
R1 and R2 may be the same or different and are selected from the group of<br>
monovalent radicals comprising<br>
hydrogen, hydroxyl. alk(en)yl groups comprising 1-30 carbon atoms which<br>
may be linear or branched and may optionally contain one or more<br>
heteroatoms and groups selected from the group of oxygen, nitrogen, '     sulphur, phosphorus, sulphone. sulphoxy, and ester, optionally substituted<br>
with epoxy. cyano, amino, thiol, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, phosphorus,<br><br>
sulphoxy, amido, ether, ester, urea, urethane, thioester, thioamide, amide, carboxyl, carbonyl. aryi, and acyl groups, and divalent radicals comprising<br>
alk(en)ylene groups having 1-10 carbon atoms which groups may be linear or branched and may optionally contain one or more heteroatoms and groups selected from the group of oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, sulphone, sulphoxy, and ester, optionally substituted with epoxy, cyano, amino, thiol, hydroxyl, halogen, nitro, phosphorus, sulphoxy, amido, ether, ester, urea, urethane, thioester, thioamide, amide, carboxyl. carbonyl, aryl, and acyl groups, ester groups; ether groups; amide groups; thioester groups; thioamide groups; urethane groups; urea groups; and a single bond.<br>
Preferably. X. Y. and Z are methylene. R1 and R2 in that case are linked to a divalent 2,6,7-trioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane radical.<br>
In the case of R1-, and R2 being both monovalent radicals, the BOE group as defined by formula I is the same as the BOE-functional compound. Monovalent radicals R1 and R2 are preferably independently from each other selected from the group of hydrogen, hydroxy!, and linear or branched alk(en)yl groups having 1-20 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with one or more hydroxyl groups and optionally comprising an ester group. Examples of such groups are: methyl, methylol. ethyl, ethylol, propyl, propylol, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, a - CH2 -CH2 - 0 - CO - C1-20 alk(en)yl group, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably, R1 is linear or branched alk(en)yl having 1-20 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with hydroxyl, while R2 is methyl or ethyl. Alternatively, R1 can be methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl,<br><br>
octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl. and mixtures thereof, while R2 can be methylol, ethyl, ethylol or a    - CH2 - CH2 - O - CO - C1-20 alk(en)yl group.<br>
When a divalent radical is selected for either or both R1 or R2 groups, high-molecular weight BOE-functional compounds can be formed. These may be adducts or polymers comprising several BOE groups. Thus two BOE groups can form an adduct by selecting a monovalent radical for one of the two R^ and R2 groups, and a divalent radical for the other. The BOE groups will then be linked together via the divalent radical. BOE groups may also be linked via the divalent radicals to monomer or oligomer compounds. Such BOE-functional compounds are, e.g. described in above-mentioned US 4.338,240. For example, two BOE groups may be linked to a dimer fatty acid, e.g. Pripol 1009. ex. Unichema. Alternatively, in the aforementioned configuration the BOE groups can function as side groups or terminal groups in a polymer chain. The polymers can be. e.g., polyesters, polyethers, polyacrylates, polyamides or polyurethanes. When the divalent radical is a single bond, the BOE group is bonded directly to the polymer. When the R1 and R2 groups are both divalent, the BOE groups can be incorporated into the main chain of a polymer or they can serve to link two polymer chains together. Preferably, one or both R1 and R2 groups are selected from the group of ester, ether, urethane. a single bond, and alk(en)ylene groups having 1-10 carbon atoms which may be linear or branched and may contain one or more ester, ether, or urethane groups.<br>
The term SOB groups in this case refers to groups having a structure according to formula II or III<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
R3 and R5 are independently from each other selected from the group of<br>
linear or branched alk(en)yl, aryl or acyl optionally containing one or more<br>
oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur or phosphorus atoms, optionally substituted with<br>
a halogen atom; and<br>
R4 and Re are independently from each other selected from an alkylene<br>
group having 1-3 carbon atoms optionally substituted with one or more<br>
groups selected from monovalent radicals<br>
such  as  linear or branched  alk(en)yl.  aryl  or acyl groups  optionally<br>
containing one or more oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus atoms;<br>
and<br>
divalent radicals<br>
such as a single bond and an alkylene group having 1-10 carbon atoms<br>
with or without one or more atoms and groups selected from oxygen,<br>
nitrogen, sulphur, and phosphorus atoms, and ether, ester, and urethane<br>
groups.<br>
Preferably. R3 and R5 are selected independently from linear or branched alk(en)yl groups having 1-4 carbon atoms, e.g., a methyl or ethyl group.<br>
In the case that neither of R4 and R6 is substituted with a divalent radical, the SOE group as defined by formulae II and III is the same as the SOE-functional compound.<br><br>
When a divalent radical is selected as substituent for either or both R4 and R6 groups, high-molecular weight SOE-functional compounds can be prepared in the same manner as described above for high-molecular BOE compounds. When R4 or R6 has one divalent radical substituent, adducts or polymers can be made which have SOE groups as terminal or side groups. In formula III, R4 and R6 can both have divalent radicals as substituents, in which case the SOE group can be incorporated into the main chain. The polymers may be, e.g., polyacrylate, polyester, polyether, polyamide or polyurethane.<br><br><br>
Preferably, R4 is ethylene, optionally substituted with a linear or branched alky! group having 1-5 carbon atoms, optionally containing one or more oxygen and nitrogen atoms. For instance, R4 may be:<br><br>
Preferably, R6 is propylene.<br>

The hydroxyl-reactive groups are selected from the group of isocyanate, epoxy, acetal, carboxyl, anhydride, and alkoxy silane groups. Also, mixtures of these groups in one compound are included. Alternatively, the second compound can be an amino resin.<br>

is used in a molar ratio of 1:1 with the anhydride monomer, as described in US 4,798,745.<br>

In addition to the disclosed BOE- and SOE-functional compounds and said hydroxyl-reactive compounds other compounds may be present in the coating composition according to the present invention. Such compounds may be main binders and/or reactive diluents comprising reactive groups which may be cross-linked with the aforesaid hydroxyl-functional compounds and/or hydroxyl-reactive compounds. Examples include hydroxyl-functional binders, e.g., polyester polyols such as described in H. Wagner et al., Lackkunstharze. 5th ed., 1971 (Carl Hanser Verlag, Munich), ^olyether polyols, polyacrylate polyols, polyurethane polyols, cellulose acetobutyrate, hydroxyl-functional epoxy resins, alkyds, and dendrimeric polyols such as described in WO 93/17060. Also, hydroxyl-functional oligomers and monomers, such as castor oil and trimethylolpropane may be present. Finally, ketone resins, aspargyl acid esters, and latent or non-latent amino-functional compounds such as oxazolidines, ketimines, aldimines. diimines, secondary amines, and polyamines may be present. These and other compounds are known to the skilled person and are mentioned, int. al., in US 5,214,086.<br><br>
The ratio of hydroxyl-reactive groups to hydroxyl groups ranges from 50 to 300 eq.%. preferably from 70 to 250 eq.%<br>
The invention further encompasses a process for curing the present coating composition. More particularly, the latent hydroxyl groups of the BOE or SOE-functional compound have to be deblocked and reacted with the hydroxyl-reactive groups of the second compound to allow the present coating composition to be cured.<br>
The deblocking of the latent hydroxyl groups, of the BOE and SOE compounds takes place under the influence of water in the form of, e.g., moisture from the air or added water. This deblocking is preferably catalysed by a first catalyst selected from the group of Lewis acids, such as AICI3. SbClg, BF3. BCI3, BeCl2, FeCIs, FeBra, SnCU. TiCl4. ZnCIa and ZrCU and organic complexes thereof, e.g.. BF3Et20, BF3-2CH3COOH, BF3-2H2O, BF3-H3PO4. BF3-(CH3)2O, BF3-THF, BF3-2CH3OH. BF3-2C2H50H, and BF3-C6H5CH2. and Bronsted acids. Preferably, use is made of Bronsted acids having a pKa 
Said first catalysts may be blocked, if so desired, resulting in the release of the Lewis or Br0nsted acid under the influence of, e.g., electromagnetic irradiation (light or UV). heat or moisture. Acid generating photoinitiators are described,  int.  al.,  in G.  Li  Bassi et al.. "Photoinitiators for the<br><br>
Simultaneous Generation of Free Radicals and Acid Hardening Catalysts," Radcure '86 Proceedings, e.g. 2-methyl-1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-[4-methylphenylsulphonyl] propan-1-one (MDTA). ex. Fratelli Lambert! Spa, Varese, Italy. Alternatively, use may be made of Lewis acid generating compounds such as Irgacure® 261 ex Ciba Geigy and trimethyi silyl benzene sulphonic ester.<br>
The first catalyst can be used alone or as a mixture of catalysts in effective amounts. The term effective amount in this case is dependent on the use of the BOE- or SOE-functional compound. When the BOE- or SOE-functional compound is used as a main binder, sufficient catalyst will have to be present to hydrolyse practically all BOE- or SOE-functional compounds. However, if the BOE- or SOE-functional compound is used primarily as a reactive diluent while other compounds are present as main binders, the hydrolysation of at least a portion of the BOE- or SOE-functional compound will suffice.<br>
Amounts of 0 to 10 wt.% relative to the BOE- and SOE-functional compounds of the first catalyst may be sufficient. Preferably. 0,3 to 8 wt.%, more specifically, 0.5 to 6 wt.%. will be present.<br>
The reaction of the deblocked hydroxyl groups of the BOE or SOE compound, the hydroxyl-reactive groups of the second compound, and, optionally, third compounds present in the composition comprising hydroxyl groups or hydroxyl-reactive groups, takes preferably place under the influence of a second catalyst. Such catalysts are known to the skilled person. The second catalyst is used in an amount of 0 to 10 wt.%, preferably 0.001 to 5 wt.%. more preferably in an amount of 0,01 to 1 wt.%, calculated on solid matter (i.e., the amount of BOE or SOE, the hydroxyl-<br><br>
reactive compound, and. optionally, the above-mentioned third compounds).<br>
As an example for the various hydroxy l-reactive groups the following catalysts may be mentioned. Polyisocyanates: dimethyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin dilaurate, dibutyl tin diacetate, tin octoate, zinc octoate, aluminum chelate, and dimethyl tin dichloride; polyepoxy compounds: tertiary amines and Lewis acids such as BF3 or organic complexes thereof; polyacetal compounds: paratoluene sulphonic acid and dodecyl benzene suiphonic acid; polycarboxylic compounds: dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid, polyanhydride compounds: organotin compounds; alkoxysilane compounds: organotin compounds, phosphoric acid, paratoluene sulphonic acid, dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid, and tertiary amines; and amino resins: dodecyl benzene sulphonic acid.<br>
As can be noted from the above, the first and the second catalyst may be the same in some coating compositions. In that case, the amount of catalyst may be higher than indicated for the first or second catalyst alone.<br>
The coating composition according to the invention may be part of a "components system, for instance a 2-component system. For example, one component may comprise both the BOE- or SOE-functional compound and the hydroxy l-reactive compound. The second component may comprise the catalyst for the hydrolysis of the BOE- or SOE-functional compound<br>
Alternatively, a 3-component system may be employed. For example, one component may comprise the BOE- or SOE-functional compound. A second component may comprise the hydroxy l-reactive component. A third<br><br>
component may comprise the catalyst for the hydrolysis of the BOE- or SOE-functional compound.<br>
In addition, a coating composition such as described may contain the usual additives such- as solvents, pigments, fillers, leveling agents, emulsifiers, anti-foaming agents and rheology control agents, reducing agents, antioxidants, HALS-stabilisers, UV-stabilisers. water traps such as molecular sieves, and antisettling agents.<br>
Application onto a substrate can be via any method known to the skilled person, e.g., via rolling, spraying, brushing, flow coating, dipping, and roller coating. Preferably, a coating composition such as described is applied by spraying.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention may be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, e.g., iron, steel, and aluminum, plastic, wood, glass, synthetic material, paper, leather, or another coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the current invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositions of the current invention show  particular utility as clearcoats (over base coats, water-borne and solvent-borne), base coats, pigmented topcoats, primers, and fillers. The compositions are particularly suitable for refinishing motor vehicles and transportation vehicles and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes.<br>
The applied coating composition can be cured very effectively at a temperature of. e.g., 0-50°C. If so desired, the coating composition may be baked, e.g., at a temperature in the range of 50-120oC.<br><br>
The present BOE-functional compound can be prepared in several ways.<br>
One such way is the transesterification of a polyol in an appropriate solvent. Examples of such polyols include glycerol, trimethyiol propane, and pentaerythritol. The transesterification agent can be a trialkyi orthoester selected from the group of triethyl orthoformate, triethyl orthoacetate, and triethyl orthopropionate. Preferably, use is made of solvents which are inert to the transesterification reaction, e.g., diethylene glycol dimethyl ether and tetraethyiene glycol dimethyl ether. The catalyst for such a reaction may be a strong acid, e.g., paratoluene sulphonic acid or BF3Et2O,. Such a process is described in T. Endo et al., Polymer Joumal Vol. 13 (1981). p. 715.<br>
When the polyol selected is pentaerythritol, a BOE group comprising a hydroxyl group is formed. This BOE group is converted into a BOE-functional compound by means of a transesterification reaction or by reaction with an acid chloride. In this way a hydroxyl-functional BOE group can be linked via transesterification to a saturated or unsaturated carboxylic acid, preferably one having not more than 20 carbon atoms. The resulting BOE-functional compound has the advantage of being non-volatile or hardly volatile because of the high molecular weight, while, surprisingly, the viscosity remains low. For this reason the BOE-functional compound is highly suited to be used as a reactive diluent. When the carboxylic acid group is unsaturated, the present coating composition comprising such a BOE-functional compound can be cured in two ways, i.e., via the hydrolysed BOE group as described above and via the unsaturated compound.<br><br>
Also, the aforesaid hydroxyl-functionai BOE group can be provided with a vinyl group via a transesterification reaction with a (meth)acrylate. By polymerisation under the influence of radicals using a vinyl-comprising BOE a BOE-functional polyacrylate can be prepared.<br>
A BOE-functional polyacrylate can further be prepared by the transesterification of a polyacrylate with a hydroxyl-functionai BOE group. In this case it is preferred to employ a polyacrylate having short-chain esters, preferably esters having 1-4 carbon atoms. The advantage of such a polyacrylate is that after the transesterification reaction the resulting alcohol groups can be isolated, e.g., by distillation In general, every polymer having an ester group as side group can be provided with BOE groups via said transesterification. As examples of polymers may be mentioned polyesters, polyethers, polyamides, and polyurethanes.<br>
Alternatively, the hydroxyl-functionai BOE group can be provided with groups which are reactive or not using, e.g.. isocyanate-functional compounds. Furthermore, two or more BOE-functional groups can be interlinked using a di- or polyisocyanate-functional compound. In this way also the hydroxyl-functionai BOE group can be linked to, e.g.. hydroxyl-functionai polymers, e.g., polyester polyols, polyether polyols, and polyacrylate polyols.<br>
Also, BOE-functional compounds can be prepared by converting the corresponding ester-functional oxetane compounds with BF3Et2O, as described by EJ. Corey et al., Tetrahedron Letters, 24 (1983), pp. 5571-5574.<br>
Oxetane compounds have the following structure:<br><br><br>
Preferably, R16 is hydroxy methyl, hydroxyethyl, chloromethyl or chloroethyl. The preparation of oxetane compounds comprising a hydroxy! group is described in J.B. Pattison, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 79 (1957), pp. 3455-3456.<br>
Said hydroxyl-functional oxetane compounds can be converted into ester group-comprising oxetanes via a transesterification reaction with suitable esters R17(COOR18)n, wherein n is an integer of at least 1, R17 is a  saturated or unsaturated alkyl, aryi, or acyl radical having 1-40 carbon atoms, optionally substituted with a reactive group such as vinyl, carbonyl, carboxyl ester, or hydroxyl, and R18 is an alkyl group having 1-4 carbon atoms. R18 preferably is methyl, ethyl, or propyl. The alcohols R18OH released on transesterification are isolated from the reaction mixture, e.g., by means of distillation. Such suitable esters may be, for example, the .     methyl ester of a fatty acid and mixtures of fatty acid, e.g. Edenor ME C6-<br><br>
10, ex. Henkel, and the dimethyl ester of a dimer fatty acid, e.g. Pripol 1009. ex. Unichema.<br>
Also, ester group-comprising oxetane compounds can be polymers, with the oxetane compounds being terminal groups or side groups. In that case, R1 can be a polymeric group such as polyester, polyether, polyacrylate, polyamide or polyurethane. Suitable polyesters can be obtained by the nucleophilic addition of carbanions to α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds. Likewise suitable are ester group terminated polyesters derived from polycarboxylic acids, polyols, or ester-forming equivalents thereof. Preferably, the aforesaid R18roups are employed.<br>
Other examples include the adduct of the conversion of diethyl fumarate and diethyl malonate to tetraethyl ester of 1.1.2,3-propane tetracarboxylic acid and a hydroxyl-functional oxetane. In the presence of a diol or polyol a terminal oxetane-functional polyester is formed.<br>
The hydroxyl-functional oxetane compounds also can be converted with the aid of acid chlorides R1(COI)n.<br>
 Preferably, R17s a group having a high molecular weight, such as pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, or the aforesaid polymers. The resulting BOE compound is non-volatile or hardly volatile because of the high molecular weight, and on account of its surprisingly low viscosity is pre-eminently suited to be used as a reactive diluent.<br>
Halogen-functional oxetanes can be converted into ester-functional oxetanes by reacting them with carboxylate salts of, e.g., silver or with<br><br>
ammonium compounds such as substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts.<br>
It has now been found that the conversion of the ester-functional oxetane compound in a BOE-functional compound already takes place in the presence of a catalytic amount of a strong Bronsted or Lewis acid or organic complexes thereof. Lewis acids are preferred. Examples of Lewis acids are: AiCl3 SbClg. BF3. BCI3. BeCl2. FeCla. FeBr3. SnCl4TiCl4ZnCl2, and ZrCl4 and organic complexes thereof, e.g., BFsEtaO. BF3-2CH3COOH, BF3'2HA BF3-H3PO4. BF3-(CH3)2O BF3-THF. BF3-2CH3OH. BF3-2C2H5OH. and BF3-C6H5CH2. More preferred are BF3Et2O BF3-2CH3COOH. and SnCU. Amounts of 0.001-0.1 mole of catalyst per mole of oxetane compound are preferred, more preferably 0,004-0,08 mole/mole. It has further been found that the conversion already takes place in. the presence of a small amount of solvent, and even without solvent if so desired. The term solvent in this connection refers to those solvents which are conventionally employed in the field of organic chemistry and have been described for the conversion of oxetane compounds. The conversion takes place in the range of -100 to 200°C, preferably in the range of 0 to 80°C. The conversion time is in the range of 30 minutes to 2 days and can rsult in a yield of more than 90%.<br>
Various methods can be employed to prepare SOE-functional compounds. One such method of preparation is the reaction of an epoxy-functional compound such as butyl giycidyl ether with a lactone such as caprolactone or butyrolactone. Alternatively, SOE-functional polymers can be prepared from epoxy-functional polymers. e.g.. polyacrylates of glycidyl(meth)acrylate.    using    lactones,    or   from   polylactones   using<br><br>
monoepoxides. Again, use may be made of catalysts such as Lewis or Bronsted acids, preferably paratoluene sulphonic acid or BF3t2.<br>
Further, a SOE-functional compound can be prepared by reacting pentaerythritol and triethyl orthopropionate in the presence of paratoluene sulphonic acid with a specific trimethyl benzene being used as solvent. Surprisingly, in this way very selectively a compound having two SOE groups of the following structure<br><br>
was synthesised.<br>

Into a flask equipped with a stirrer, a distilling column, a nitrogen inlet, a heating<br>
jacket, and a thermometer were charged 486 g of triethyl orthoacetate, 408 g of<br>
pentaerythritol, 300 g of diethylene glycol dimethyl.<br><br>
65 g of diethyl ether, and 1,4 g of a 35%-solution of BF3Et2O in diethyl ether. To this mixture were added in the course of 1 hour 93 g of butyl glycidyl ether. The reaction was slightly exothermic. By means of external cooling the temperature was maintained in the range of 23-28°C. After the addition of the butyl glycidyl ether the mixture was kept at said temperature for 3 hours with continuous stirring. Next, the reaction mixture was heated to reflux for one hour. After cooling to room temperature, 2 g of sodium carbonate were added and stirring was continued overnight at room temperature. The solids were filtered off, and 1 more g of sodium carbonate was added. Diethylether was distilled off at reduced pressure at room temperature. The residue was subjected to vacuum distillation. The fraction having a boiling point in the range of 45-65°C at a pressure of 0,1 mbar yielded 31 g of clear liquid. After analysis (1H and 13C-NMR spectroscopy) it was found that a spiro-orthoester of the following structure had formed<br><br>

In a flask equipped as in Example 7A were weighed di-3-ethyloxetan-3-yl methyl ester of dimer fatty acid prepared as specified in Example 7B (914 g) and butyl acetate (1400 g). At room temperature BF3-Et2O (9,15 g) was added thereto during 15 minutes. The reaction mixture was heated to 50°C and kept at that temperature for 10 hours. Next, the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and 6.5 g triethyl amine was added. A precipitate was formed, which was filtered off. The product analyzed by infrared spectroscopy showed a small signal at 3400 cm-1 indicating hydroxyl functionality. Phenyl isocyanate (9 g) was added to the product. After 1 hour at room temperature infrared spectroscopy indicated the absence of hydroxyl functionality (no signal at 3400 cm'1-) and of isocyanate functionality (no signal at 2270 cm-1).  Part of the butyl acetate was<br><br>
evaporated. The final product has a solids content of 82,7% and is a yellow oil.<br>

The reaction mixture was heated to reflux temperature. At 189°C the ethanol distillation began. The distillation speed was controlled by slowly increasing the reaction temperature. At a temperature of 210°C all ethanol had been distilled off. The xylene was removed from the reaction mixture under reduced pressure. The obtained oxetane-functional polyester had a molecular weight of Mn=1021 and Mw=1875 (GPC, polystyrene standard).<br>
B: Preparation of a BOE-functional polyester<br>
This reaction was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. Into a round-bottomed flask were weighed: the oxetane-functional polyester as prepared in Example 8A (800,0 g, 1,6 equivalents of oxetane) and BFaEtaO (about 1 g). An exothermic reaction took place. The temperature of the reaction mixture rose to 62°C. Next, there was cooling with a water bath. After one night virtually all oxetane groups were found to have been converted into the corresponding BOE groups (BOE signal at d (ppm) 4,0 in ^H NMR). The obtained BOE-functional polyester had a molecular weight of Mn=1648 and Mw=7449 (GPC. polystyrene standard).<br><br>

Comm., (1989), p. 837.<br>
The reaction was carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. To a mixture of 3-ethyl-3-hydroxymethyl oxetane (170,6 g, 1,50 moles) and triethyl amine (153,8 g. 1.52 moles ) in tetrahydrofuran (500 g) cooled in an ice bath acryloyi chloride (137,5 g, 1,52 moles) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was stirred for one hour at room temperature. To the reaction mixture 500 g of water were added. The organic layer was separated from the aqueous layer. The aqueous layer was extracted with diethyl ether (2 x 500 ml). The combined organic layers were dried with a saturated NaCI solution and magnesium sulphate. Following filtration of the ether layer the volatile organic compounds were removed under vacuum using a rotary vacuum evaporator. The residue was distilled under vacuum. 3-ethyloxetan-3-yl methyl acrylate was isolated at 122°C/19 mbar as a clear oil. The yield was: 200,4 g. (80%). 1H NMR (CDCI3) d (ppm): 0,92 (t, 3H); 1,80 (q, 2H); 4,30 (s, 'H); 4,48 (dd, '4H); 5,88 (d, 1); 6,18 (dd, 1H); 6.45 (d.<br>

During the feeding the temperature rose from 155°C to 169°C. After the feeding there were two further additions, each over 30 minutes, of<br><br>
a solution of Trigonox® 42S (0,25 g) in MAK (1,0 g). The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature. Next, BF3Et2O (0,75 g) was added. The obtained resin had the following physical properties: Mn=1736, Mw=4567, viscosity = 1,28 Pa.s, and S.C.=74,7% (after 30 minutes of heating at 150°C).<br>
Example 10 and Comparative Example A<br>
BOE as main binder reacting with a polvisocvanate-containinq compound Desmodur® N3390 was mixed with (2,2-dimethylol-n-butyl)propionate (DBP) and BOE 2, respectively (130 eq.% NCO, calculated on (latent) hydroxyl). 0,15 wt.% of DBTL, calculated on solid matter, and 0,33 wt.% of PTSA, calculated on DBP, were added to the DBP mixture, while 0,15 wt.% of DBTL calculated on solid matter and 0,83 wt.% of PTSA calculated on BOE 2 were added to the BOE 2 mixture. The two mixtures were diluted with a 50:50 mixture of MAK/EAK to spraying viscosity (±DINC4 18"). 270 g of MAK/EAK were needed to give the DBP mixture the desired spraying viscosity. By contrast, the BOE 2 mixture required only 200 g. The use of BOE 2, in other words, makes for a 70 g reduction of the amount of diluent required to obtain a sprayable composition. The pot life and drying time data is compiled below. Pot life is defined as the time during which the viscosity of the coating composition increased to 30" DINC4. The coating compositions were sprayed on a steel plate to obtain a 50p layer after drying. It is obvious that the coating composition according to the present invention has a longer pot life and a shorter drying time, in other words, an especially favourable pot life:drying time ratio.<br><br><br>
Example 11 and Comparative Example B<br>
SQE as main binder reacting with a polvisocyanate-containinq compound Two samples of SOE 2 were mixed with Desmodur® N3390 (130 eq.% of NCO, calculated on latent hydroxyl), 0,3 wt.% of DBTL, calculated on solid matter, was added to the two mixtures, while 1,1 wt.% of PTSA, calculated on SOE 2, was added to one of the mixtures. The coating compositions were applied on a steel plate with a 100Μ  draw bar. The S.C. results are compiled below. They clearly show the effect PTSA has on the deblocking of the hydroxyl groups in the SOE composition.<br><br>
Examples 12-18<br>
BOE as main binder reacting with a polvisocvanate-containina compound 4,3 parts by weight of BOE 2 were mixed with 10,8 parts by weight of Desmodur ® N3390 (100 eq.% NCO, calculated on latent hydroxyl). 0,3 wt.% of DBTL, calculated on solid matter, was added. Various acids were added as catalysts for the hydrolysis of the BOE compound. The coating compositions were applied on steel plates with a 100|J draw bar. The data is compiled below. The percentages of catalyst mentioned in the table are based on the amount of BOE 2. PTSA has a pKa of 0,5-1, the pKa of benzoic acid (BZ) is 4,2, and the pKa of DBF is 2-3. The S.C. is measured after 1 day drying at room temperature and 1 hour at 120°C.<br><br><br>
In all cases there is excellent pot life. The S.C. improves with the use of stronger acid or larger quantities of acid. Example 16 provides the best results with a high S.C. and a reasonable drying time.<br>
Comparative Examples C and D<br>
Example 12 was repeated. Instead of 4.3 parts of BOE 2. 3,7 parts of 2-ethyl-1,3-hexane diol were added. Two mixtures were prepared comprising 0,005 parts by weight and 0.05 parts by weight of DBTL. calculated on solid matter, respectively. For the first mixture a pot life of 0.5 hour was measured, for the second, one of 1 minute. The touch dry time of the coating composition when using 0.05 parts by weight of DBTL was over 4 hours at room temperature.<br><br>
Example 19 and Comparative Example E<br>
BOE as reactive diluent in a composition comprising a polyester polvol and a polyisocvanate-functional compound<br>
The diluting capacity of BOE 2 was compared with ethylbutyl propane diol (EBP), a hydroxyl-functional compound, in a high solids urethane coating formulation. Use was made of 130 eq.% NCO (Desmodur® N3390) on (latent) hydroxyl. Polyester polyol A was used as the binder. The catalyst used for the BOE hydrolysis was PTSA, the catalyst for the isocyanate-hydroxyl reaction was DBTL. It can be seen from the table that when BOE 2 is used, there is 65 grams less solvent present per kilogram of paint (about 65 grams per liter). Because of the lower equivalent weight of BOE 2 in comparison with EBP, comparatively speaking a little more isocyanate is needed for cross-linking. All amounts are in parts by weight.<br><br><br>
Example 20 and Comparative Example F<br>
BOE as main binder with a polvisocyanate-functional compound<br>
The performance of BOE 2 was compared with that of a commercially<br>
available reactive diluent, Oxazolidine Zoldine® RD 20 ex. Angus Chemical<br>
Company (1-aza-3,7-dioxo-bicycio-2,8-diisopropyl-5-ethyl-[3,3,0]-octane).<br>
Desmodur® N3390 was cross-linked with the two compounds (130 Eq. % NCO, calculated on (latent) hydroxyl). The coating .compositions were diluted with MAK:EAK (50:50) to a viscosity of 19 DINC4. Added were 0,1 wt.% of DBTL, calculated on solid matter, and 0,57 wt.% of PTSA, calculated on BOE 2. Both compositions were sprayed onto bare steel. The temperature during drying was 20oC, the relative humidity 70%. Below it can be seen that the pot life is longer when use is made of BOE 2, while drying proceeds more rapidly.<br><br><br>
Examples 21 and 22 and comparative Example G<br>
BOE  as main  binder in  combination with a  polvisocvanate-functional<br>
comoound and an acid generating initiator.<br>
A coating composition was prepared containing<br>
5.3   parts by weight of BOE 3B 10,8   parts by weight of Desmodur® N3390<br>
1.5   parts by weight of 10% DBTL in butylacetate 1.06 parts by weight of 20% 2-methyl"1-[4-(methylthio)phenyl]-2-[4-methyiphenylsulphonyl] propan-1-one (MDTA), ex. Fratelli Lamberti Spa, Varese, Italy, in butyl acetate.<br>
The coating composition was applied with a draw bar onto two steel plates to give a 50 pm film thickness after drying. Five minutes after application one steel plate was irradiated by UV-A for 1 minute (Example 21). After an hour at room temperature the coating was touch dry and clear. The unradiated coating (comparative example G) was touch dry after 5 hours but was very troubled due to unhydrolysed BOE, The coating composition was stored for a week at 50°C. Then it was applied as described above (example 22). The coating was again touch dry after an hour. The storage stability of the MDTA containing coating composition is very good.<br>

The coating compositions were applied with a draw bar onto a steel plate to give a 50 pm film thickness after drying. The touch dry time of the coating composition of the present invention is equal to the comparative coating composition as well as the solvent resistance to MEK.<br><br>
Example 24 and Comparative Example I<br>
BOE as main binder with polvalkoxvsilane-functional resin<br>

  i<br>
The results listed above show that a composition comprising a melamine resin and a catalyst frees water which result in a very quick ring opening of the BOE compound. Accordingly, the potlife is very short and this coating composition asks for a 2K component system or a blocked catalyst. The coating composition was applied with a draw bar onto a steel plate to give a 50μm film thickness after drying.<br>
Examples 26 and 27<br>
Solvent free clearcoat compositions<br>
Two solvent free clearcoat compositions were prepared as listed below.<br>

component   contained   the   BOE   compound,   the   second   component<br>
contained   the   polyisocyanate   compound   and   the   third   component<br>
contained the acid catalyst. Solvent-free is defined as VOC
 <br><br>
Both compositions have a viscosity of 23" (DINC4). The clearcoats were sprayed on steel panels coated with Autobase MM basecoat. ex.

Both coating compositions were sprayed on steel panels prepared with a conventional primer as a car refinish topcoat. Appearance and application behavior is good. The VOC level is at a very low level, approximately 250<br>
g/i.<br>
Examples 30 and 31<br>
Clearcoat coating compositions<br>
Two clearcoat coating compositions were prepared as listed below. Both<br>
coating compositions have a viscosity of 16" DINC4. Potlife of the coating<br>
composition of Example 30 is shorter than the potlife of the coating<br>
composition of Example 31, due to the presence of hydroxyl-functional<br><br>
polymer in BOE 3A. Both clearcoat compositions were sprayed on steel panels prepared with Autobase MM basecoat. ex. Sikkens. using a HVLP spraygun. Room temperature cure of the coating composition of Example 30 is faster than the cure of the coating composition of Example 31. Appearance and gloss of both coatings are excellent.<br><br>
Examples 32 and 33<br>
Clearcoat coating compositions<br>
Two clearcoat coating compositions were prepared as listed below. Both<br>
clearcoat compositions were sprayed  on steel  panels  prepared with<br>
Autobase MM basecoat.  ex.  Sikkens.  using a HVLP spraygun.  Both<br><br>

Primer compositions<br>
Two ultra high solid primer compositions were prepared as listed below.<br>
Component 1 was stirred at high speed for 15 minutes and subsequently<br><br>
passed twice through a closed mill to obtain a fineness of less than 25 |.im. Component 1 was then mixed with premixed components 2 and 3.<br><br>
Both primer coating compositions were applied with conventional spray equipment on steel panels and had a spray viscosity around 2.0 Poise (measured with a Sheen Rotothinner) at a VOC around 290 g/l.   Dried at<br><br>
room temperature (overnight) or at 60X (30 minutes), hard and good sandable coatings were obtained which can be topcoated with regular carrefmish topcoat systems and/or coating compositions of the present invention such as exemplified in Examples 26-29 (pigmented topcoats as well as base/clear systems).<br>
Advantages over existing Medium Solid 2k primer/filler materials as used in the carrefmish market nowadays are: a very low VOC. a long potlife and a high build behavior. Compared to existing High Solids primer compositions comprising imine crosslinkers advantages are again a long potlife, fast drying at 60oC. and the fact that there is no emission of volatile blocking components (like aldehydes and ketones from crosslinkers such as ketimines, aldimines and oxazolidines).<br>
