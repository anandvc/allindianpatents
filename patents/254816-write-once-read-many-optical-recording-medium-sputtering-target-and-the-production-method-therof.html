DESCRIPTION<br>
WRITE-ONCE-READ-MANY OPTICAL RECORDING MEDIUM,<br>
SPUTTERING TARGET AND THE PRODUCTION METHOD THEREOF<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a write-once-read-many (WORM) optical<br>
recording medium. More specifically, the present invention relates to a write-<br>
once-read-many optical recording medium enabling high density recording<br>
particularly at blue-laser wavelengths. The present invention further relates to a<br>
sputtering target which can be used for forming an oxide-layer which is a layer<br>
constituting the write-once-read- many optical recording medium.<br>
Background Art<br>
Relating to a write-once-read-many optical recording medium enabling<br>
recording and reproducing at laser wavelengths of blue or shorter, a blue laser<br>
allowing super high density recording is rapidly developed, and the development<br>
of write-once-read-many optical recoding media sensitive to blue-laser<br>
wavelengths is promoted.<br>
In conventional write-once-read-many optical recording media, a laser<br>
beam is irradiated to a recording layer which comprises an organic material to<br>
change the refractive index		<br><br><br>
typically due to the decomposition and degeneration of the<br>
organic material, and thus recording pjts areformed. The<br>
optical constant and decomposition behavior of the organic<br>
material used in the recording layer play an important role to<br>
form satisfactory recording pits.<br>
For use in a recording layer of write-once-read-many<br>
optical recording media sensitive to blue-laser wavelengths, an<br>
organic material must have suitable optical properties and<br>
decomposition behavior with respect to light at blue-laser<br>
wavelengths. More specifically, the wavelengths at which<br>
recording is performed are set at a tail on the longer-wavelength<br>
side of a major absorption band to increase the reflectance in<br>
unrecorded portions and to substantially increase difference in<br>
refractive index invited by the decomposition of the organic<br>
material upon irradiation of laser to thereby yield a higher<br>
modulated amplitude. This is because wavelengths at the tail<br>
on the longer-wavelength side of a major absorption band of<br>
such an organic material yield an appropriate absorption<br>
coefficient and a high refractive index.<br>
However, an organic material having optical properties<br>
with respect to light at blue-laser wavelengths equivalent to<br>
those of conventional materials has not yet been found. To<br>
produce such an organic material having an absorption band in<br>
the vicinity of blue-laser wavelengths, the molecular skeleton<br><br>
must be downsized or the conjugate system must be shortened.<br>
However, this invites a lowered absorption coefficient and a<br>
lowered refractive index. More specifically, there are many<br>
organic material having an absorption band in the vicinity of<br>
blue-laser wavelengths and it is possible to control their<br>
absorption coefficients, however they do not have a sufficiently<br>
high refractive index and fail to yield a higher degree of<br>
modulated amplitude.<br>
Then the one using inorganic materials and organic<br>
materials, and the one using only inorganic materials are<br>
presently being studied for a material having optical properties<br>
sensitive to light at blue-laser wavelengths. As the one using<br>
oxides, Patent Literature 1 discloses a recording layer which<br>
comprises Bi, rare-earth, Ga, Fe, and O, and the invention<br>
describes a composition capable of forming garnet, Patent<br>
Literature 2 discloses an optical recording medium using organic<br>
oxides.<br>
However, these conventional techniques do not study in<br>
what shape recording marks should be formed to effectively form<br>
excellent recording marks and yield excellent properties. As a<br>
matter of course, these techniques do not allow for the shape of<br>
recording marks to yield higher modulated amplitudes when<br>
used with light at blue-wavelengths, which are brought up<br>
herein as an issue.<br><br>
Besides, for write-once-read-many optical recording media<br>
using oxides of metals or semimetals as a recording layer,<br>
TeOx-Pd recording layers having high-reliabilities have been<br>
proposed in Patent Literatures 3 and 4. In Patent Literatures<br>
3 and 4, the composition ratio of the TeOx-Pd recording layer is<br>
varied in a direction of the thickness of the layer to enhance<br>
reliabilities such as storage stability. Besides, recording layers<br>
which comprise TeOx-Pd are also disclosed in Non-Patent<br>
Literatures 1 and 2, however, they have only descriptions on<br>
controlling of degrees of oxidation therein as a method for<br>
improving reliabilities.<br>
As to materials containing a bismuth oxide, which are<br>
similar to the present invention though, they are disclosed<br>
respectively in the following Patent Literatures- Patent<br>
Literature 5 discloses an amorphous and ferromagnetic oxide<br>
expressed by the formula Ax(MmOn)y(Fe2O3)z, in which individual<br>
ratios of various oxides of A, various elements of M, and x, y,<br>
and z are defined; Patent Literature 6 discloses a metallic oxide<br>
which comprises a 50% or more amorphous phase expressed by<br>
the formula (Bi2O3)x(MmOn)y(Fe2O3)z, in which individual ratios<br>
of m and n of MmOn, individual ratios of x, y, and z are defined,<br>
and the production method thereof; Patent Literature 7 discloses<br>
an amorphous compound having a composition expressed by the<br>
formula (B2O3)x(Bi2O3)1-x, the range of the composition x, and<br><br>
the quenching method; and Patent Literature 8 discloses<br>
bismuth-iron amorphous compound material having a<br>
composition of (Bi2O3)1-x(Fe2O3)x, however, x is represented by<br>
0.90 ≥ x &gt; 0.<br>
However, these techniques respectively relate to<br>
amorphous oxide materials which are optically transmissive and<br>
ferromagnetic, and they are . typically used for<br>
photoelectromagnetic optical recording media, functional devices<br>
for controlling light by means of actions of magnetism,<br>
photoelectromagnetic sensors, transparent and electrically<br>
conductive films, piezo-electric films, and the like. In addition,<br>
these techniques provided by other companies basically aim for<br>
patents relating to materials and/or production methods of the<br>
materials and have no descriptions on applications to<br>
writeonce-read-many optical recording media. <br>
On the other hand, as one of the methods for producing a<br>
recording layer for an optical recording medium, there has been<br>
a sputtering method. The sputtering has been widely known in<br>
the art as—one of the methods for forming thin-layers under<br>
vapor-phase and utilized in producing thin-layers for industrial<br>
purposes. In the sputtering method, a target material having<br>
the same component as that of a layer to be formed is prepared,<br>
typically, argon gas ions generated by glow-discharge is crashed<br>
with the target material to beat the constituent atoms of the<br><br>
target material, and the atoms are deposited on a substrate to<br>
thereby form a layer. An oxide typically has high-melting point,<br>
and thus it is not suitably formed by an evaporation method or<br>
the like, and the high-frequency-wave sputtering method, in<br>
which high-frequency waves are applied, is usually used.<br>
There are many achievements of the sputtering method in<br>
its production process, and sputtering is also advantageous in<br>
terms of throughput. However, when a layer containing mixed<br>
materials from two or more elements is formed, there may be<br>
cases where the composition of a target is not same as that of<br>
the layer, and therefore, the composition of the target must be<br>
considered. Further, there are many cases where the structure<br>
and characteristics of a layer vary depending on the<br>
configuration of a compound constituting the target, and thus<br>
this point must be considered.<br>
As a technique known in the art, for example, Patent<br>
Literature 9 discloses a target which comprises a Bi oxide as a<br>
sputtering target for forming a dielectric film. However, Patent<br>
Literature 9 does not mention a target which comprises Fe. <br>
Since when the type of constituent elements varies, the relation<br>
between the composition and constituting compound of the<br>
target as well as the relation between the structure and<br>
composition of a layer vary. Thus, the structure of target must<br>
be changed, and the findings disclosed in Patent Literature 9 do<br><br>
not serve as a reference to the sputtering target proposed in the<br>
present invention.<br>
In addition, Patent Literature 10 discloses a target for<br>
producing a thin layer made from Bi3Fe5O12, however, the<br>
invention is for producing a thin layer having so-called a garnet<br>
structure, in which high-degree of magneto-optical effect is<br>
obtained, and the invention employs the ratio of Bi to Fe being<br>
3*5 to 3.5:4.5. Accordingly it differs from the sputtering target<br>
proposed in the present invention.<br>

medium capable of performing excellent recording at a<br>
wavelength of blue-laser wavelengths or shorter, the following<br>
items (1) to (3) are taken up as important issues:<br>
(1) Small recording marks can be formed.<br>
(2)	Less interference between recording marks<br>
(3)	High-stability in recoding marks<br>
When a blue-laser is used, a material by which recording<br>
can be excellently performed at blue-wavelengths must be<br>
selected, unlike in the case where a laser is used at<br>
near-infrared wavelengths and red-wavelengths used for CD and<br>
DVD.<br><br>
Since a Bi oxide easily absorbs light at blue-wavelengths,<br>
excellent recording can be expected.<br>
The first aspect of a write-once-read-many optical<br>
recording medium according to the present invention comprises<br>
a substrate, a recording layer, and a reflective layer, in which a<br><br>
material represented by BiOx (e 
recording layer, and recording marks with information recorded<br>
therein comprise crystal of Bi and/or crystal of a Bi oxide. To<br>
yield a higher modulated amplitude, it is required that the<br>
(difference in refractive index between a recording mark an<br>
unrecorded portion be large. When a material represented by<br>
BiOx (0 
crystal of Bi and/or crystal of a Bi oxide in a recording mark, the<br>
variance in refractive index is larger, and higher modulated<br>
amplitude can be realized. For example, when an unrecorded<br>
portion is amorphous and a recoding mark comprises a<br>
crystallized portion, higher modulated amplitude can be yielded.<br>
When an unrecorded portion comprises a Bi oxide, by forming<br>
precipitation of a simple substance of Bi-metal, not oxide, in a<br>
recording mark, the difference in refractive index is much larger,<br>
and much higher modulated amplitude can be yielded. The<br>
method for forming a recording mark by crystallizing amorphous<br>
portions has been used so far, however, in the present invention,<br>
when recording is performed in an oxide, much greater effect<br><br>
can be expected by utilizing the phenomenon that the recorded<br>
portion is changed to a substance other than oxides and the<br>
recorded portion is crystallized. A recording mark which<br>
comprises crystals having two or more different<br>
crystal-structures can restrain the crystals from growing and<br>
spreading and enables forming a small recording mark, because<br>
mixed crystals each having a different crystal structure can<br>
restrain the growth of crystals.<br>
The changes in a recording layer induced by recording<br>
will be described more.<br>
The material represented by BiOx (0 
metastable state which is hard to exist with normal conditions,<br>
 however, such a state can be realized in an optical recording<br>
medium by forming a recording layer by sputtering. When a<br>
laser beam is irradiated to a recording layer in a metastable<br>
state of BiOx (0 
easily to separate into Bi and a Bi oxide, because BiOx attempts<br>
to go back to a more stable state. At this point in time, it is<br>
believed that some Bi oxides isolate from oxygen to become no<br>
longer an oxide to be in a state of Bi. Since a more stable state<br>
is a crystalline state, crystal of Bi and crystal of a Bi oxide are<br>
formed, and thus a recording mark becomes in a state where<br>
crystal of Bi and/or crystal of a Bi oxide are included.<br>
An aspect of the write-once-read-any optical recording<br><br>
medium of the present invention comprises a substrate, a<br>
recording layer, and a reflective layer, wherein the recording<br>
layer comprises Bi, O, and M as constituent elements, wherein<br>
M represents at least one element selected from the group<br>
consisting of Mg, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Cu, Zn, Li, Si, Ge, Zr, Ti, Hf,<br>
Sn, Mo, V, Nb, Y, and Ta, and a recording mark with information<br>
recorded therein comprises one or more crystals from crystal of<br>
the one or more elements contained in the recording layer and<br>
crystal of an oxide of the one or more elements. An another<br>
aspect of the write-once-read-many optical recording medium<br>
comprises a substrate, a recording layer, and a reflective layer,<br>
wherein the recording layer comprises Bi, O, and L as<br>
constituent elements, and the recording layer comprises a Bi<br>
oxide, and L represents at least one element selected from the<br>
group consisting of B, P, Ga, As, Se, Tc, Pd, Ag, Sb, Te, W, Re, Os,<br>
Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Po, At, and Cd.<br>
Bismuth may be contained in any of the states such as<br>
metallic bismuths, bismuth alloys, bismuth oxides, bismuth<br>
sulfides, bismuth nitrides, bismuth fluorides, however, the<br>
recording layer preferably comprises one bismuth oxide. Since<br>
a recording layer containing a bismuth oxide enables lowering<br>
thermal conductivity of the recording layer, achieving<br>
high-sensitivities and lower jitter values, and making an<br>
imaginary part of complex index of refraction smaller, the<br><br>
recording layer has an excellent transparency, and a<br>
multi-layered recording layer is easily formed.<br>
Preferably, bismuth and one or more elements selected<br>
from the group consisting Mg, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Cu, Zn, Li, Si,<br>
Ge, Zr, Ti, Hf, Sn, Mo, V, Nb, Y, Ta, B, P, Ga, As, Se, Te, Pd, Ag,<br>
Sb, Te, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Po, At, and Cd reside in the<br>
recording layer in an oxidized state from the perspective of<br>
improvements in stability and thermal conductivity, however,<br>
they are not necessarily oxidized completely. In other words,<br>
when the recording layer of the present invention comprises<br>
three elements of bismuth, oxygen, and one element such as Mg,<br>
it may comprise bismuth, a bismuth oxide, an element such as<br>
Mg, and an oxide of the element such as Mg.<br>
Examples of the method for making bismuth or metallic<br>
bismuth and a Bi oxide mixed in the recording layer, i.e. the<br>
method for forming a recording layer in which bismuth elements<br>
reside in different states include the following methods (A) to<br>
(C).<br>
(A)	Sputtering the recording layer using a bismuth-oxide <br>
target<br>
(B)	Sputtering the recording layer using a bismuth target<br>
and a bismuth-oxide target<br>
(C)	Sputtering the recording layer using a bismuth target<br>
while introducing oxygen into the recording layer or<br><br>
co-sputtering method<br>
When the method (A) is employed, bismuth in the target<br>
is completely oxidized, and this method utilizes the phenomenon<br>
that oxygen is likely to be deficient depending on the sputtering<br>
conditions such as degree of vacuum and sputtering power.<br>
First, an aspect of the write-once-read-many recording<br>
medium in which the recording layer comprises Bi, M and<br>
oxygen as constituent elements will be described below. It is<br>
noted that the element M represents at least one element<br>
selected from the group consisting of Mg, Al, Cr, Mn, Co, Fe, Cu,<br>
Zn, Li, Si, Ge, Zr, Ti, Hf, Sn, Mo, V, Nb, Y, and Ta.<br>
Recording can be excellently performed to light at<br>
blue-wavelengths by using a material which comprises Bi, M,<br>
and oxygen for a recording layer. In an aspect of the<br>
write-once-read-many optical recording medium of the present<br>
invention, in which a recording layer comprises M, by forming a<br>
recording mark in a state where crystals of two or more types of<br>
oxides are mixed, the difference in refractive index between a<br>
recording mark and an unrecorded portion is larger, and higher<br>
modulated amplitudes can be yielded. Further, greater effects<br>
can be obtained by making not only crystal of respective oxides<br>
but also crystal of a simple substance of element reside in the<br>
recording layer. Since growth of crystals can be restrained by<br>
making crystals of different elements or crystals each having a<br><br>
different crystal structure mixed, a recording mark which<br>
comprises crystals of two or more different elements and/or<br>
crystal-structures can restrain the crystals from growing and<br>
spreading and makes it possible to form a small recording mark.<br>
A recording mark preferably comprises tetravalent Bi.<br>
Typically, as the valence of Bi, trivalent Bi is in the most stable<br>
state, however to yield a much higher modulated amplitude, a<br>
tetravalent Bi is used. It is possible to make the valence of Bi<br>
into tetravalence depending on the conditions of oxygen<br>
surrounding a Bi atom. Since physical properties are changed<br>
by changing the valence of Bi, higher modulated amplitude can<br>
be yielded.<br>
Examples of the tetravalent Bi compound include BiO2.<br>
Typically, a Bioxide having a structure of Bi2O3 is in a stable<br>
state. However, a Bi-oxide can take a structure like BiO2<br>
depending on the conditions. By making a recording layer have<br>
a crystalline structure that is not typically employed, higher<br>
modulated amplitudes can be yielded.<br>
A still another aspect of the write-once-read-many optical<br>
recording medium of the present invention will be described<br>
below. In the write-once-read-many optical recording medium,<br>
a recording layer comprises Bi, L, oxygen, and a Bi oxide as<br>
constituent elements. It is noted that the element L represents<br>
at least one element selected from the group consisting of B, P,<br><br>
Ga, As, Se, Tc, Pd, Ag, Sb, Te, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Po,<br>
At, and Cd. The recording layer comprises bismuth as the<br>
principal constituent. As an element to be added to the<br>
recording layer which comprises Bi and O as constituent<br>
elements, the element M can be named. However, the study<br>
about basic properties of the constituent elements that can be<br>
added to the constituent elements shows that the element L can<br>
also be named. One of the reasons why the element L can be<br>
added as a constituent element to a recording layer which<br>
comprises bismuth as the principal constituent and comprises a<br>
Bi oxide is to reduce thermal conductivity to facilitate forming a<br>
minute recording mark. Since thermal conductivity is a value<br>
attributable to the presence of photon scattering, thermal<br>
conductivity can be reduced when the particle size and crystal<br>
size are downsized, when there are a number of atoms<br>
constituting a material, and when the difference in atomic mass<br>
of constituent atoms is large, and the like. Thus, by adding the<br>
element L as a constituent element to a recording layer which<br>
comprises bismuth as the principal constituent and comprises a<br>
Bi oxide, it is possible to control thermal conductivity and<br>
improve high density recording properties.<br>
Further, in a recording layer which comprises bismuth as<br>
the principal constituent and further comprises a bismuth oxide,<br>
the bismuth oxide and the bismuth are crystallized by recording<br><br>
of information, however the size of the crystal and crystallized<br>
particles can be controlled by the element L. Thus, the element<br>
L enables controlling the size of crystal and crystallized<br>
particles in recorded portions and greatly improving recording<br>
and reproducing properties such as jitter. This is another<br>
reason for adding the element L as a constituent element to a<br>
recording layer.<br>
From the perspective of thermal conductivity, there are<br>
little requirements that are assumed by the element L which can<br>
be added as a constituent element to the recording layer except<br>
for simple requirements such as the stability of raw materials<br>
and the difficulty level of production. However, the inventors of<br>
the present invention found that reliabilities of a recording layer,<br>
i.e. reproducing stability and storage stability substantially<br>
vary depending on the selected element L, and definitely there<br>
are requirements assumed by the element L with respect to<br>
reliabilities.<br>
Namely, as a result of keen examinations on the<br>
requirements of the element L to be added as a constituent<br>
element to the recording layer, the inventors of the present<br>
invention found that the following requirements (I) or (II) are<br>
effective:<br>
(I) An element having a Pauling's electronegativity value<br>
of 1,80 or more.<br><br>
(II) An element having a Pauling's electronegativity value<br>
of 1.65 or more and the standard enthalpy of formation AHf° of<br>
oxides of-1,000 (kJ/mol) or more, excluding transition metals.<br>
By using an element L satisfying (I) or (II), it is possible<br>
to achieve a write-once-read-many optical recording medium<br>
having excellent recording and reproducing properties such as<br>
jitter, and high-reliabilities.<br>
Hereinafter, the requirements (I) and (II) will be<br>
explained in detail.<br>
Degradation in reliabilities of the recording layer which<br>
comprises bismuth as the principal constituent of constituent<br>
elements and comprises a bismuth oxide is primarily caused by<br>
progression of oxidation, or changes in oxidization state such as<br>
changes in the valence, and the like.	Pauling's<br>
electronegativity values and the standard enthalpy of formation<br>
"AHf0" of oxides are really important as physical property values<br>
of the element L, because the progression of oxidation and<br>
changes in oxidization state are liable to invite degraded<br>
reliabilities. To sufficiently enhance reliabilities of an optical<br>
recording medium, first, it is preferred to select an element<br>
having a Pauling's electronegativity value of 1.80 or more as an<br>
element L. This is because oxidation is unlikely to make<br>
progress with an element having a high Pauling's<br>
electronegativity value, and to secure satisfactory reliabilities,<br><br>
an element having a Pauling's electronegativity value of 1.80 or<br>
more is effective. The standard enthalpy of formation of "∆Hf0"<br>
of oxides may take any values, provided that the Pauling's<br>
electronegativity value is 1.80 or more.<br>
Examples of the element L having an electronegativity of<br>
1.80 or more include B, Si, P, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ga, Ge, As, Se, Mo,<br>
Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Sn, Sb, Te, W, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au, Hg, Tl, Pb,<br>
Po, and At.<br>
Here, the electronegativity will be described briefly.<br>
The electronegativity is a scale representing how strongly<br>
the existing atom in a molecule can attract electrons thereto.<br>
The ways to determine a value of electronegativity include<br>
Pauling's electronegativity, Mulliken's electronegativity, and<br>
Allred-Rochow's electronegativity. In the present invention, the<br>
adequacy of an element L is determined by using Pauling's<br>
electronegativity.<br>
The Pauling's electronegativity defines that the binding<br>
energy E (AB) of molecules A and B is greater than the average<br>
of binding energy of molecules AA and molecules BB [E (AA) and<br>
E (BB), respectively], and the difference therebetween is a<br>
square of the difference between the electronegativity of the<br>
respective atoms (XA, XB). Namely, it is represented by the<br>
following formula:<br>
E (AB) - [E (AA) + E (BB)] / 2 = 96.48 (XA- XB)2 ....(1)<br><br>
In Pauling's electronegativity, the equation includes a<br>
conversion coefficient of 96.48 (leV = 96.48kJmol-1), because a<br>
value of electronegativity is determined by using electron volt.<br>
Since the electronegativity varies depending on with what<br>
valence an intended element takes in a molecule, the following<br>
definitions are applied when the electronegativity is determined<br>
in the present invention.<br>
Namely, as shown below, the value when the following<br>
each group element respectively takes the following valence is<br>
defined as the Pauling's electronegativity value of the element:<br>
Elements in 1 group take monovalence; elements in 2<br>
group take divalence," elements in 3 group take trivalence;<br>
elements in 4 group to 10 group take divalence; elements in 11<br>
group take monovalence*' elements in 12 group take divalence,'<br>
elements in 13 group take trivalence; elements in 14 group take<br>
tetravalence; elements in 15 group take trivalence; elements in<br>
16 group take divalence; elements in 17 group take<br>
monovalence; and elements in 18 group take zero valence.<br>
For the above-noted elements each having<br>
electronegativity of 1.80 or more, the respective Pauling's<br>
electronegativity values defined in the present invention are B<br>
(2.04), Si (1.90), P (2.19), Fe (1.83), Co (1.88), Ni (1.91), Cu<br>
(1.90), Ga (1.81), Ge (2.01), As (2.18), Se (2.55), Mo (2.16), Tc<br>
(1.90), Ru (2.20), Rh (2.28), Pd (2.20), Ag (1.93), Sn (1.96), Sb<br><br>
(2.05), Te (2.10), W (2.36), Re (1.90), Os (2.20), Ir (2.20), Pt<br>
(2.28), Au (2.54), Hg (2.00), Tl (2.04), Pb (2.33), Po (2.00), and At<br>
(2.20).<br>
These elements can be added in combination with two or<br>
more as constituent elements to a recording layer.<br>
Further, the inventors of the present invention found that<br>
even if the Pauling's electronegativity value is less than 1,80, an<br>
element having a Pauling's electronegativity value of 1.65 or<br>
more and the standard enthalpy of formation AHf° of oxides of<br>
the element being -1,000 (kJ/mol) or more enables ensuring<br>
satisfactory reliabilities. The reason why the requirement is<br>
effective is because when an element having a great value of<br>
standard enthalpy of formation ∆Hf0 of oxides, the element is<br>
hard to form oxides thereof even if the value of Pauling's<br>
electronegativity value is small in some degree.<br>
In the present invention, when determining a Pauling's<br>
electronegativity value, it was determined with each valence<br>
fixed to every group of elements, and the same definitions are<br>
applied when determining the standard enthalpy of formation<br>
∆Hf0.<br>
Namely, the value when an oxide is constituted with the<br>
following each valence in each group element is defined as the<br>
standard enthalpy AHf° of formation of the element.<br>
Namely, elements in group 1 take monovalence," elements<br><br>
in 2 group take divalence; elements in 3 group take trivalence;<br>
elements in 4 group to 10 group take divalence; elements in 11<br>
group take monovalence; elements in 12 group take divalence;<br>
elements in 13 group take trivalence! elements in 14 group take<br>
tetravalence; elements in 15 group take trivalence; elements in<br>
16 group take divalence; and elements in 17 group take<br>
monovalence; and elements in 18 group take zero valence.<br>
However, in the case of a transition metal, it is impossible to<br>
easily determine the standard enthalpy of formation AHf0 of<br>
oxide thereof, because it forms an oxide with various valences.<br>
Typically, the higher the valence of the element which forms an<br>
oxide thereof is, the lower the standard enthalpy of formation<br>
∆Hf0 of the oxide is.<br>
In other words, it is considered that in the case of a<br>
transition metal, an oxide or oxides thereof are easily formed<br>
because there are oxides having various valences to be formed,<br>
and thus in the present invention transition metals are not<br>
preferably used as an element L.<br>
For example, since V (vanadium) takes divalence, the<br>
standard enthalpy of formation ∆Hf0 of a V (vanadium) oxide<br>
takes the value of the standard enthalpy ∆Hf0 of formation of VO<br>
= -431 (kJmol-1), and it falls under the requirements for the<br>
element L (II) in the present invention. However, V (vanadium)<br>
also easily forms oxides such as V2O3 (trivalence), V2O4<br><br>
(tetravalence), V2O5 (pentavalence). The ∆Hf0 values of these<br>
oxides are respectively V2O3 (-1,218kJmol-1), V2O4<br>
(-l,424kJmol-1), V2O5 (-1,550kJmol-1), and these values do not<br>
fall under the requirements for the element L (II) in the present<br>
invention. Namely, assuming that V forms oxides with almost<br>
only divalence, V (vanadium) falls under the requirements of (I)<br>
and (II) of the present invention, however V (vanadium) easily<br>
forms oxides other than divalent oxides, and the oxides are<br>
easily oxidized, i.e. are in a more stable state. Thus, these<br>
oxides are excluded from the preferred element L of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The description of the exclusion is clearly described in the<br>
requirement (II) for the element L in the present invention as<br>
"excluding transition metals."<br>
Here, the standard enthalpy of formation ∆Hf° will be<br>
described briefly.<br>
Typically, a chemical reaction is represented by the<br>
following chemical equation (2):<br>
H2 (gas) + (1/2) O2 (gas) = H2O (liquid) 	(2)<br>
The left side of the chemical equation is referred to as<br>
original system, and the right side thereof is referred to as<br>
product. The coefficient attached to a molecule is called a<br>
stoichiometric coefficient.<br>
Heat moves in and out associated with a chemical<br><br>
reaction of the system at a constant temperature is called heat<br>
of reaction, and heat of reaction at a constant pressure is called<br>
heat of reaction at constant pressure.<br>
In most cases, under typical laboratory conditions, heat of<br>
reaction is measured at a constant pressure, therefore, heat of<br>
reaction at constant pressure is typically used. Heat of<br>
reaction at constant pressure is equal to the difference in<br>
enthalpy "∆H" between product and original system.<br>
A reaction expressed as ∆H &gt; 0 is referred to as<br>
endothermic reaction, and a reaction expressed as ∆H 
referred to as exothermic reaction.<br>
Heat of reaction generated from a reaction forming a<br>
compound from a chemical element of the compound is called<br>
heat of formation or enthalpy of formation. Heat of reaction<br>
generated from a reaction forming one mole compound in<br>
standard condition from a chemical element of the compound is<br>
called standard enthalpy of formation. In the standard<br>
condition, the standard enthalpy of formation is marked with a<br>
designated temperature, typically 298K, under a pressure of<br>
0.1MPa or nearly equal to 1 atmospheric pressure, and the<br>
standard enthalpy of formation is represented by the symbol of<br>
∆Hf°. In the standard condition, it is ruled that enthalpies of<br>
respective chemical elements are zero.<br>
Thus, it can be said that the smaller the value of<br><br>
standard enthalpy of formation of oxide of an element is or the<br>
greater in negative value of the standard enthalpy of formation<br>
is, the oxide is more stable and the element is easily oxidized.<br>
The specific values of the standard enthalpy of formation<br>
are written, for example, in "Electrochemistry Handbook Vol. 5"<br>
(Denkikagaku Binran) edited by The Electrochemistry Society<br>
of Japan, Maruzen).<br>
Since the standard enthalpy of formation ∆Hf° varies<br>
depending on with what valence an intended element takes in a<br>
molecule to form an oxide thereof, the above-noted requirements<br>
are applied when the standard enthalpy of formation of oxides of<br>
respective elements is determined in the present invention.<br>
Examples of elements having a Pauling's<br>
electronegativity value of 1.65 or more and the standard<br>
enthalpy of formation of oxides thereof ∆Hf0 of -1,000 (kJ/mol)<br>
or more include Zn, Cd, and In.	For the Pauling's<br>
electronegativity value according to the definitions of the<br>
present invention, these elements respectively are determined<br>
as follows: Zn (1.65), Cd (1.69), and In (1.78). For the<br>
standard enthalpy of formation ∆Hf0 according to the definitions<br>
of the present invention, they are respectively determined as<br>
follows:	Zn (-348kJmon), Cd (-258kJmol-1), and In<br>
(-925kJmorl-1).<br>
The atomic number ratio of the total amount of the<br><br>
element L to bismuth is preferably 1.25 or less.<br>
Since a recording layer of the present invention is based<br>
on the assumption that it comprises bismuth as the principal<br>
constituent of the recording layer and also comprises a Bi oxide,<br>
when the atomic number ratio of the total amount of the element<br>
L to bismuth is more than 1.25, intrinsic recording and<br>
reproducing properties may not be obtained.<br>
Further, adding B, P, Ga, Se, Pd, Ag, Sb, Te, W, Pt, and<br>
Au as an element L to the recording layer is preferable from the<br>
perspective of improving storage stability of the recording layer.<br>
The improvement of storage stability is very likely to be caused<br>
by the fact that it is hard to break a once-formed crystalline<br>
structure by strengthening binding force between the atoms or<br>
when atoms in different size reside side-byside, it makes the<br>
crystalline structure stable because smaller atoms in size can<br>
reside in lattices of greater atoms in size. In particular,<br>
elements such as B and Pd are bound to oxygen, and when<br>
making Bi and O exist together is effective in stabilizing an<br>
amorphous structure. It may consequently stabilize the<br>
structure of the crystal, which leads to improvements in storage<br>
stability of the write-once-read-many recording medium.<br>
In a write-once-read-many optical recording medium of<br>
the present invention, it is preferred that recording and<br>
reproducing of information be performed through the use of a<br><br>
laser beam at a wavelength of 680nm or less. Unlike dyes, the<br>
recording layer of the present invention has an appropriate<br>
absorption coefficient at a wide range of wavelengths and has a<br>
high refractive index, and therefore it is possible to perform<br>
recording and reproducing with a laser beam at a red-laser<br>
wavelength of 680nm or less as well as to achieve excellent<br>
recording and reproducing properties and high-reliabilities.<br>
Among them, the most preferable advantage is to perform<br>
recording and reproducing with a laser beam at a wavelength of<br>
450nm or less. This is because the recording layer having<br>
bismuth as the principal constituent and having a Bi oxide has a<br>
complex refractive index particularly suitable for a<br>
write-once-read-many optical recording medium used with a<br>
laser beam at a wavelength of 450nm or less.<br>
A write-once-read-many optical recording medium<br>
according to the present invention preferably has the following<br>
configurations, however they are not particularly limited to the<br>
configurations.<br>
(A)	Substrate, recording layer, upper coating layer, and<br>
reflective layer<br>
(B)	Substrate, under coating layer, recording layer, upper<br>
coating layer, and reflective layer<br>
(C)	Substrate, reflective layer, upper coating layer,<br>
recording layer, and cover layer<br><br>
(D) Substrate, reflective layer, upper coating layer,<br>
recording layer, under coating layer, and cover layer.<br>
Further, on the basis of the above configurations, a<br>
structure of layers may be formed in a multi-layered structure.<br>
For example, when formed in two-layered based on the<br>
configuration of (A), it may has a configuration as follows:<br>
Substrate, recording layer, upper coating layer, reflective layer<br>
or semi-transparent layer, binder layer, recording layer, upper<br>
coating layer, reflective layer, and substrate.<br>
For the under coating layer and the upper coating layer,<br>
the following oxides and nonoxides are available' examples of<br>
the oxides include simple oxide such as B2O5, Sm2O3, Ce2O3,<br>
Al2O3, MgO, BeO, ZrO2, UO2, and ThO2; silicate such as SiO2,<br>
2MgOSiO2, MgO.SiO2, CaO.SiO3, ZrO2SiO2, 3Al2O3.2SiO2,<br>
2MgO.2Al2O3-5SiO2, Li2O.Al2O3-4SiO2; double oxide such as<br>
Al2TiO5, MgAl2O4, Ca10 (PO4)6(OH)2, BaTiO3, LiNbO3, PZT [Pb<br>
(Zr, Ti) O3], PLZT [(Pb, La) (Zr, Ti) O3],and ferrite. Examples of<br>
the nonoxides include nitrides such as Si3N4, A1N, BN, and TiN'<br>
carbides such as SiC, B4C, TiC, and WC; borides such as LaB6,<br>
TiB2, and ZrB2; sulfides such as ZnS, CdS, and MoS2; silicides<br>
such as MoSi2; and carbons such as amorphous carbon, graphite,<br>
and diamond.<br>
Organic materials such as dyes and resins can also be<br>
used for the under coating layer and the upper coating layer.<br><br>
Examples of the dyes include polymethine dyes,<br>
naphthalocyanine dyes, phthalocyanine dyes, squarylium dyes,<br>
chroconium dyes, pyrylium dyes, naphthoquinone dyes,<br>
anthraquinone (indanthrene)	dyes, xanthene dyes,<br>
triphenylmethane dyes, azulene dyes, tetrahydrocholine dyes,<br>
phenanthrene dyes, triphenothiazine dyes, azo dyes, formazan<br>
dyes, and metal complexes of these compounds.<br>
Examples of the resins include polyvinyl alcohols,<br>
polyvinyl pyrrolidones, cellulose nitrates, cellulose acetates,<br>
ketone resins, acrylic resins, polystyrene resins, urethane resins,<br>
polyvinyl butyrals, polycarbonates, and polyolefins. Each of<br>
these resins may be used alone or in combination with two or<br>
more.<br>
A layer which comprises organic materials can be formed<br>
by means of vapor depositions, sputtering, CVD, i.e. Chemical<br>
Vapor Deposition, coating of a solvent or the like, which are<br>
typically used. When a coating method is used, the above-noted<br>
organic materials and the like are dissolved in an organic<br>
solvent and the solvent is coated by a commonly used coating<br>
method such as spraying, roller-coating, dipping, and<br>
spin-coating.<br>
Examples of typical organic solvents to be used include<br>
alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol; ketones<br>
such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, and cyclohexanone;<br><br>
amides such as N, N-dimethylacetoamide, and N,<br>
N-dimethylformamide; sulfoxides such as dimethylsulfoxide;<br>
ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, diethyl ether, and<br>
ethylene glycol monomethyl ether; esters such as methyl acetate,<br>
and ethyl acetate; aliphatic halocarbons such as chloroform,<br>
methylenechloride, dichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride, and<br>
trichloroethane; aromatic series such as benzene, xylene,<br>
monochlorobenzene, and dichlorobenzene; cellosolves such as<br>
methoxyethanol, and ethoxyethanol; and hydrocarbons such as<br>
hexane, pentane, cyclohexane, and methylcyclohexane.<br>
For the reflective layer, light reflection materials having<br>
high reflectance against laser beams are used.<br>
Examples of the light reflection materials include metals<br>
such as Al, Al-Ti, Al-In, Al-Nb, Au, Ag, and Cu, semimetals, and<br>
alloys thereof. Each of these materials may be used alone and<br>
in combination with two or more.<br>
When a reflective layer is formed with an alloy, it is<br>
possible to prepare it by using an alloy as a target material and<br>
by sputtering. Besides, it is also possible to form a reflective<br>
layer by tip-on-target method (for example, a Cu tip is placed on<br>
an Ag target material to form a reflective layer), and by<br>
cosputtering (for example, an Ag target and a Cu target are<br>
used).<br>
It is also possible to alternately stack low-refractive<br><br>
index layers and high-refractive index layers and form a<br>
multi-layered structure to use it as a reflective layer.<br>
A reflective layer may be formed, for example, by<br>
sputtering, ion-plating, chemical vapor deposition, and vacuum<br>
deposition. The reflective layer preferably has a thickness of<br>
5nm to 300nm.<br>
Materials for a substrate are not particularly limited, as<br>
long as they have excellent thermal and machine properties, and<br>
when recording and reproducing is performed from the side of a<br>
substrate and through the substrate, they have also excellent<br>
light transmission properties.<br>
Specifically, examples thereof include polycarbonates,<br>
polymethyl methacryiates, amorphous polyolefins, cellulose<br>
acetates, polyethylene terephthalate, of which polycarbonates<br>
and amorphous polyolefins are preferable.<br>
The thickness of the substrate varies depending on the<br>
application and is not particularly limited.<br>
Materials for a protective layer to be formed on a<br>
reflective layer, an optically transparent layer or the like are<br>
not particularly limited, provided that the material can protect<br>
reflective layers, optically transparent layers or the like from<br>
external forces. Examples of organic materials include<br>
thermoplastic resins, thermosetting resins, electron beam<br>
curable resins, and ultraviolet curable resins. Examples of<br><br>
inorganic materials include SiO2, Si3N4, MgF2, and SnO2.<br>
On a reflective layer and/or an optically transparent layer<br>
and the like, a protective layer can be formed using a<br>
thermoplastic resin and/or thermosetting resin. First, a<br>
thermoplastic resin and/or a thermosetting resin are dissolved<br>
in a suitable solvent to prepare a coating solution. Then, the<br>
coating solution is coated to a reflective layer and/or an optically<br>
transparent layer and dried to thereby form a protective layer.<br>
A protective layer using an ultraviolet curable resin can<br>
be formed by directly coating an ultraviolet curable resin to a<br>
reflective layer and/or an optically transparent layer or<br>
dissolving an ultraviolet curable resin in a suitable solvent to<br>
prepare a coating solution and coating the coating solution to a<br>
reflective layer and/or an optically transparent layer, and then<br>
irradiating ultraviolet ray to the coating solution to harden it.<br>
For ultraviolet curable resins, for example, acrylate<br>
resins such as urethane acrylates, epoxy acrylates, and<br>
polyester acrylates can be used.<br>
Each of these materials may be used alone and in<br>
combination with two or more and may be formed in not only a<br>
single layer but also in a multi-layered structure.<br>
For a method for forming a protective layer, coating<br>
methods such as spin-coating and casting, sputtering, chemical<br>
vapor deposition, and the like are used, of which spin-coating is<br><br>
preferable.<br>
The thickness of the protective layer is typically 0.1µm to<br>
100µm, however it is preferably 3pm to 30pm in the present<br>
invention.<br>
Further, a substrate may be disposed on the surface of a<br>
reflective layer or an optically transparent layer. The reflective<br>
layer and the optically transparent layer may be arranged so as<br>
to face each other. Two sheets of optical recording media may<br>
be laminated after arranging a reflective layer and an optically<br>
transparent layer so as to face each other.<br>
In addition, an ultraviolet curable resin layer, an<br>
inorganic resin layer or the like may be formed on a mirror<br>
surface side of a substrate to protect the surface and/or to<br>
prevent dust or the like from attaching thereto.<br>
An optically transparent layer or a cover layer should be<br>
formed when a lens with a high numerical aperture is used for<br>
higher recording density. With increasing numeral aperture,<br>
the portion through which the reproducing light passes must<br>
have a reduced thickness. This is because the allowance in the<br>
aberration occurs when the perpendicular direction to the<br>
surface of the medium deviates from the optical axis of an<br>
optical pickup, the deviation angle so called a tilt angle is<br>
reduced with increasing numerical aperture. The tilt angle is<br>
in proportional to the square of the product of reciprocal of the<br><br>
wavelength of an optical source multiplied by the numerical<br>
aperture of the objective lens and is susceptible to the<br>
aberration due to the thickness of the substrate. To reduce the<br>
aberration due to the thickness of the substrate, the thickness of<br>
the substrate is reduced.<br>
For this purpose, some optical recording media are<br>
presented, for example, an optical recording medium in which a<br>
substrate, a recording layer with concave convex or<br>
irregularities formed thereon, a reflective layer, and an optically<br>
transparent layer or a cover layer which is a layer transmitting<br>
light are disposed in this order in a laminar structure, in which<br>
the reproducing light is irradiated from the optically<br>
transparent layer to reproduce information in the recording<br>
layer. Another example is an optical recording medium in<br>
which a reflective layer, a recording layer, and an optically<br>
transparent layer or a cover layer having optical transparency<br>
are disposed in this order on a substrate, in which the<br>
reproducing light is irradiated from the optically transparent<br>
layer to reproduce information in the recording layer. These<br>
optical recording media can allow the use of an objective lens<br>
with a high numerical aperture by reducing the thickness of the<br>
optically transparent layer. Namely, higher-density recording<br>
can be performed by recording and/or reproducing information<br>
on a medium having a thin optically transparent layer, in which<br><br>
the reproducing light is irradiated from the optically<br>
transparent layer.<br>
The cover layer may typically comprise a polycarbonate<br>
sheet or an ultraviolet curable resin. The cover layer used<br>
herein may include a binder layer for binding the cover layer to<br>
an adjacent layer.<br>
Hereinafter, a sputtering target suitably used for the<br>
optical recording medium of this invention having a recording<br>
layer which comprises Bi, Fe, and oxygen, and the production<br>
method will be disclosed in detail.<br>
A sputtering target according to the present invention<br>
comprises Bi, Fe, and 0. The sputtering target is suitably used<br>
for forming a recording layer of an optical recording medium<br>
which performs recording and reproducing with a laser beam at<br>
wavelengths of 550nm or less.<br>
The relationship between extinction coefficient k which is<br>
one of optical constants and is a coefficient representing a light<br>
absorption degree and wavelength of light was examined.<br>
When the value of k is zero, it represents that there is no<br>
absorption of light, and with increasing value of k, absorption<br>
light increases. A recording layer formed using the sputtering<br>
target of the present invention which comprises Bi, Fe, and O<br>
has absorption light of nearly zero at a wavelength of 600nm or<br>
more, and has approx. zero value of k, therefore, it is hard to<br><br>
record information. However, the value of k abruptly becomes<br>
greater at wavelengths shorter than 550nm and excellent<br>
recording is enabled. Particularly, in the vicinity of a<br>
wavelength of 400nm, absorption of light becomes substantially<br>
greater, fairly excellent properties are exhibited as a recording<br>
layer of an optical recording medium.<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention preferably<br>
comprises a Bi oxide and a Fe oxide or a complex oxide of Bi and<br>
Fe. The sputtering target may comprise a complex oxide of Bi<br>
and Fe and further comprises one or more selected from a Bi<br>
oxide and a Fe oxide. There may be cases where a Bi oxide or a<br>
Fe oxide remains in a sputtering target without making complex<br>
of Bi and Fe in a well-balanced condition, depending on the<br>
composition. An aspect of the sputtering target comprises a Bi<br>
oxide and a Fe oxide, or another aspect of the sputtering target<br>
comprises a complex oxide of Bi and Fe, or still another aspect of<br>
a sputtering target comprises a complex oxide of Bi and Fe and<br>
further comprises one or more selected from a Bi oxide and a Fe<br>
oxide. In any of the aspects stated above, an optical recording<br>
medium produced using such a sputtering target as stated above<br>
exhibits excellent properties. In particular, by including a Bi<br>
oxide as a constituent of a recording layer, the produced<br>
recording layer can include the Bi oxide. Since a recorded mark<br>
can be excellently recorded by precipitating Bi metal, it is<br><br>
remarkably effective to use a sputtering target which comprises<br>
a Bi oxide.<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention preferably<br>
comprises one or more selected from a Bi oxide, a Fe oxide, and<br>
a complex oxide of Bi and Fe, and the oxide is preferably an<br>
oxide having a smaller amount of oxygen compared to the<br>
stoichiometric composition. Examples of the oxide which is a Bi<br>
oxide, a Fe oxide, or a complex oxide of Bi and Fe and has a<br>
smaller amount of oxygen compared to the stoichiometric<br>
composition include BiOx (x 
3), Bi25FeOx (x 
amount of oxygen to enhance metallic properties, sputtering is<br>
enabled through the use of a direct-current power (DC power).<br>
DC sputtering has advantages in that apparatuses used for the<br>
manufacturing are cheaper than those used in RF sputtering<br>
and the apparatuses used in DC sputtering are to be more<br>
downsized than those used in RF sputtering. When a layer is<br>
formed by DC sputtering, the amount of oxygen in the layer can<br>
be controlled by externally introducing oxygen. By employing<br>
DC sputtering, recording properties are easily controlled.<br>
A sputtering target having a smaller amount of oxygen<br>
compared to the stoichiometric composition is calcined after a Bi<br>
metal and Fe2O3 being mixed. It is also possible to produce a<br>
target having a small amount of oxygen by the methods such as<br><br>
by reducing the amount of oxygen remaining in the target by<br>
controlling the temperature.<br>
The sputtering target of the present invention preferably<br>
comprises one or more selected from BiFeO3, Bi25FeO40, and<br>
Bi36Fe2O57 as the principal constituent. As mentioned above,<br>
an optical recording medium using a recording layer which<br>
comprises Bi, Fe, and oxygen exhibits excellent recording<br>
properties. There have been a sputtering target containing Bi,<br>
Fe, and oxygen for magnetic optical recording and having a<br>
garnet structure, however, such sputtering target do not<br>
comprise the compounds used in the present invention as the<br>
principal constituent from the perspective of the composition for<br>
forming a garnet structure. A sputtering target which<br>
comprises three elements of Bi, Fe, and oxygen has not been<br>
used so far, because it is impossible to form a garnet structure<br>
only with these three elements. In addition, the present<br>
invention does not relate to magnetic optical recording media,<br>
and the present invention relates a sputtering target used for<br>
forming a layer which primarily comprises Bi, Fe, and oxygen,<br>
which is hereafter referred to as a BiFeO layer, for an optical<br>
recording medium without using magnetism, particularly for a<br>
write-once-read-many optical recording medium capable of<br>
high-density recording.<br>
The sputtering target preferably consists of three<br><br>
elements of Bi, Fe, and oxygen.<br>
In this case, the sputtering target may comprise impure<br>
elements other than the three elements, however, it is not<br>
preferred to include the microelements that would impair<br>
properties of layers.<br>
A sputtering target of the present invention is produced<br>
by mixing and calcining powder of oxides of raw materials. It is<br>
possible to produce the sputtering target using calcine powder of<br>
a Bi oxide and powder of a Fe oxide. It is also possible to<br>
produce a sputtering target by producing powder of a compound<br>
which primarily comprises three elements of Bi, Fe, and oxygen<br>
and then calcining the powder. As the calcining method,<br>
press-heat calcination processes such as hot-pressing, hot<br>
isostatic pressuring or HIP may be used. For calcination<br>
temperatures, higher temperatures are preferred to reinforce<br>
the strength of a sputtering target, however, in the case of a<br>
compound which comprises three elements of Bi, Fe, and oxygen,<br>
separation of the phase and/or fusion occur at a temperature of<br>
approx. 800°C or more, and it is difficult to uniformly calcine it.<br>
Then, the calcination temperature must be controlled not so as<br>
to be more than approx. 750°C.<br>
In particular, an optical recording medium in which a<br>
BiFeO layer is formed using a sputtering target which comprises<br>
one or more selected from BiFeO3, Bi25FeO40, and Bi36Fe2O57 as<br><br>
the principal constituent for the recording layer exhibits<br>
excellent properties. The presence of BiFeO3, Bi25FeO40, and<br>
Bi36Fe2O57 can be checked by means of X-ray diffraction. For<br>
the radiation source, Cu is used to measure it with the angle of<br>
29 of an X-ray diffractometer from 5° to 60°. The term the<br>
principal constituent means that the highest content or the<br>
highest % by mass is contained in a compound. Typically, a<br>
material exhibiting the highest diffraction peak as a result of an<br>
X-ray diffraction analysis can be determined as the principal<br>
constituent, however, the content may not be in proportion to<br>
the scale of diffraction peak. The case of a sputtering target<br>
which comprises two or more elements selected from BiFe03,<br>
Bi25FeO40, and Bi36Fe2O57 as the principal constituent means<br>
that each content of these two or more compounds is same and<br>
the content of these two or more compounds is higher than that<br>
of other components.<br>
The sputtering target preferably comprises Bi2O3 and/or<br>
Fe2O3. An optical recording medium with a BiFeO layer formed<br>
using a sputtering target which comprises these compounds for<br>
the recording layer exhibits excellent properties. The presence<br>
of Bi2O3 and/or Fe2O3 can be checked by means of X-ray<br>
diffraction. For the radiation source, Cu is used to measure it<br>
at an angle of 29 from 5° to 60°.<br>
In the. X-ray diffraction analysis for identifying<br><br>
constituents of BiFeO3, Bi25FeO40, Bi36Fe2O57, and Bi2O3, and<br>
Fe2O3, when the angle of 2θ where a diffraction peak is expected<br>
to be detected is defined as θ1, a substance actually having a<br>
diffraction peak within the range of θ1 ± 1 degree is determined<br>
to be included in the above-noted compounds.<br>
In X-ray diffraction analysis, the lattice constant varies,<br>
and misalignments are developed in angles at which diffraction<br>
peaks appear depending on causes such as measurement<br>
temperature, internal stress of the layer, X-ray wavelength error<br>
of measurement, and shift of composition. For well-known<br>
substances, at what angles diffraction peaks are detected can be<br>
known through the use of ASTM (American Society for Testing<br>
and Material) cards and JCPDS search. When a sample is<br>
analyzed to identify the component, ASTM cards and JCPDS<br>
card charts are widely used. The term, JCPDS stands for Joint<br>
Committee on Powder Diffraction Standards, and it is a chart of<br>
X-ray diffraction patterns distributed by the organization called<br>
International Center for Diffraction Data, and a number of<br>
charts of diffraction patterns of standard substances are stored<br>
for search. An X-ray diffraction pattern chart of a sample<br>
having unknown components is compared to the charts of<br>
standard substances, and to what chart of standard substance<br>
the X-ray diffraction pattern chart corresponds or is closely<br>
related is determined. With this comparison, the substance of<br><br>
the sample is identified. The identification method using<br>
JCPDS card charts is a method widely used in the world, as<br>
shown in X-ray Diffraction Analysis Rules, and descriptions of<br>
X-ray Diffraction Analysis Rules in Japanese Industrial<br>
Standard (JIS) as well as in X-ray Diffraction Analysis -<br>
Ceramics Basic Structures 3 edited by Tokyo Institute of<br>
Technology. In the measurement, to what chart of standard<br>
substance the X-ray diffraction pattern of the substance having<br>
unknown components corresponds or is closely related is<br>
examined, and then the substance is identified.<br>
nλ = 2d sinθ<br>
In the above equation, n represents a positive integral<br>
number, λ, represents a wavelength, d represents distance of<br>
lattice plane, and θ represents a glancing angle or a<br>
supplementary angle of incident angle.<br>
Since the Bragg principle is approved, a peak of<br>
diffraction also appears at the positions where n represents an<br>
integral multiple at the side of higher-angle of 2θ. The<br>
identification of substances is enabled by analyzing peaks of<br>
positions represented by integral multiple at the same time of<br>
the analysis of diffraction peaks based on 2θ. As described<br>
above, in X-ray diffraction analysis, lattice constant varies, and<br>
misalignments are developed in angles at which diffraction<br>
peaks appear due to measurement temperature, internal stress<br><br>
of the layer, X-ray wavelength error of measurement, shift of<br>
composition, and the like, therefore, when a substance having a<br>
peak near at the angle where a diffraction peak appeared at a<br>
known substance, it can be determined that the substance<br>
corresponds to the known substance having that diffraction<br>
peak.<br>
For the misalignment of diffraction peak, for example,<br>
peaks having 29 = 22.491 degree sought from the standard chart<br>
of BiFeO3 (reference code 20-0169) was studied. The results of<br>
measurement on four sputtering targets produced in the same<br>
manner and under same conditions were respectively observed.<br>
The degree 2θ of the standard data of BiFeO3 is 22.491°. On<br>
the other hand, these targets showed very slight misalignments<br>
of 22.380°, 22.500°, 22.420°, and 22.420°, respectively. This<br>
study showed that the misalignments of approx. ± 1 degree are<br>
within the error range of measurement, when repeatedly<br>
measured. Therefore, even though such misalignments in angle<br>
of ± 1 degree diffraction peak are observed, it can be identified<br>
as a known peak. For example, when a substance having a<br>
peak with a misalignment of ± 1 degree from 22.491°, it can be<br>
determined that the BiFeO3 described in the present invention<br>
are included in the substance. The sputtering target which<br>
comprises Bi, Fe, and O and has a diffraction peak at 22.380 ≤<br>
29 ≤ 22.500 is particularly effective in recording properties.<br><br>
Similarly, according to the standard data of Bi36Fe2O57,<br>
Bi36Fe2O57 has a peak at 2θ = 27.681 degree. The above-noted<br>
four targets were measured, and it was found that they had a<br>
peak at 27.65°, 27.64°, 27.76°, and 27.67°.<br>
According to the standard data of Bi25FeO40, it has a peak<br>
at 2θ = 27.683 degree. These four targets were measured, and<br>
it was found that they had a peak at 27.66°, 27.64°, 27.76°, and<br>
27.68°, respectively.<br>
Since misalignments of approx. ± 1 degree are caused in<br>
the repeated measurements, it is considered that the<br>
misalignments of ± 1 degree in 2θ of any of these substances fall<br>
under the error range of measurement.<br>
Preferably, the sputtering target does not further<br>
comprise Bi2Fe4O9. With increasing content of Bi, the content<br>
of Bi2Fe4O9 tends to lower. The presence of Bi2Fe4O9 can be<br>
checked by means of X-ray diffraction. For the radiation source,<br>
Cu is used to measure it with the angle of 29 of an X-ray<br>
diffractometer from 5° to 60°. It is found that an optical<br>
recording medium with a BiFeO layer formed for a recording<br>
layer using a sputtering target in which the presence of<br>
Bi2Fe4O9 is recognized by means of X-ray diffraction does not<br>
satisfactorily exhibit recording properties and does not suit<br>
high-density recording.<br>
The sputtering target preferably has a content of Co, Ca<br><br>
and Cr less than the detection limit. When a sputtering target<br>
which comprises impurities is used, a formed layer also<br>
comprises elements of impurities. In optical recording,<br>
recording is performed by absorbing laser beam irradiation into<br>
a recording layer to elevate the temperature at the recording<br>
layer and to induce physical or chemical changes. The term<br>
physical or chemical changes means changes such as<br>
crystallization or the like. A layer used for a recording layer<br>
containing impurities is not preferably used because<br>
crystallization temperature varies, and the size of crystal differs<br>
at the time of crystallization.<br>
For detection of impurities, the composition is<br>
quantitatively analyzed by means of the inductively coupled<br>
plasma emission spectrometry. This analysis is suitable when<br>
analyzing element in minute amount, and even when using this<br>
analysis, the sputtering target preferably has a content of Co,<br>
Ca and Cr less than the detection limit.<br>
The sputtering target preferably has a packing density of<br>
65% to 96%.<br>
The higher the packing density of the sputtering target is,<br>
the higher the strength of the target is, and the time for forming<br>
a layer tends to be shortened because of its high-density<br>
elements, at the same time, the difference in composition<br>
between the target and the formed layer tends to increase.<br><br>
There may be cases where the composition of the target can be<br>
close to that of the layer by reducing the density of the target,<br>
however, a density-reduced target causes problems with not only<br>
delayed layer-forming speed but also causes a problem that the<br>
target itself goes brittle to be broken when forming a layer.<br>
Herein, the term packing density represents a value obtained as<br>
density by comparing the weight of a target actually produced to<br>
the weight of the target calculated when the weight of the target<br>
is dominated by an intended substance at 100%.<br>
Table 1 shows packing densities of a target, conditions of<br>
the target during the time for forming a layer or after the<br>
forming, and recording properties of a recording medium with a<br>
layer formed therein when using a Bi10Fe5Ox target having a<br>
diameter of 76.2mm and a thickness of 4mm. When the packing<br>
density was 50% or less, the target was not able to be formed as<br>
a sputtering target even after calcinations. With a packing<br>
density of 61%, the target was able to be formed, however, it was<br>
easily broken immediately after applying an electric power of<br>
100W. With a packing density of 98%, the density was so high<br>
and the target was so hard that it was easily broken. With a<br>
packing density of 65% to 96%, the target was able to be formed<br>
with no problem, and excellent recording properties were<br>
exhibited. Even with a packing density of 61% and 98%,<br>
excellent recording properties were obtained by forming a layer<br><br>
under the conditions ensuring no occurrence of fracture of target<br>
in forming a layer. As can be seen from the above results, the<br>
packing density of the sputtering target is preferably 65% to<br>
96%.<br><br>
The sputtering target preferably has an atomic ratio of Bi<br>
to Fe satisfying the relation of Bi/Fe ≥ 0.8. An optical recording<br>
medium having a BiFeO-layer formed using the target exhibits<br>
excellent properties and is particularly suitable for high-density<br>
recording.<br>
Theoretically, the upper limit of the ratio Bi/Fe is 25<br>
based on the assumption that a sputtering target which<br>
comprises Bi25FeO40 as the principal constituent is used,<br>
however, virtually, it is 15 or so. A sputtering target<br>
production method of the present invention relates to a method<br>
for producing the BiFeO target of the present invention by<br><br>
calcining powder of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3. Bi2O3 naturally exists as<br>
an oxide of Bi, and Fe2O3 exists as an oxide of Fe. These<br>
powers are crushed by a dry process or a wet process and then<br>
classifying into a uniformly sized particle diameter. Next, the<br>
powders are mixed, heated, and pressed to put into shape and<br>
then calcined at a maintained temperature of 750°C in the<br>
atmosphere. The strength of a sputtering target can be<br>
improved by repeatedly performing the process of re-crushing a<br>
calcined target and forming the shape by heating and pressing.<br>
A sputtering target can be obtained by bonding the target<br>
calcined as above to a backing plate made from oxygen-free<br>
copper by means of metal bonding or resin bonding.<br>
The present invention also proposes an optical recording<br>
medium which comprises a BiFeO layer formed using the<br>
sputtering target of the present invention. In the optical<br>
recording medium, necessary layers are formed on a resin<br>
substrate which comprises a polycarbonate or the like. Grooves<br>
and pits may be formed on the resin substrate for controlling<br>
tracking or the like. A BiFeO-layer is formed by applying<br>
radiofrequency power while introducing an argon gas in vacuo.<br>
Besides, a metallic layer and a protective layer for improving<br>
properties may be disposed as a reflective layer.<br>
The above paragraphs describe the sputtering target of<br>
the present invention with a focus on optical recording media,<br><br>
and the application of the sputtering target of the present<br>
invention is not limited to optical recording media and may be<br>
used for other purposes, as long as performance of the layer<br>
meets requirements. For example, the sputtering target can be<br>
used for forming a thin layer made from magnetic materials, for<br>
forming a thin-layer for producing an isolator for optical<br>
controlling, and for forming a thin layer for an optical switch.<br>
For a rough production line of forming the sputtering<br>
target, it is possible to take procedure steps of weighing of raw<br>
materials, mixing by a dry-process ball mill, hot-pressing, shape<br>
forming, and bonding can be used. It is also usable to take the<br>
procedure steps of weighing of raw materials, mixing by a<br>
dry-process ball mill, spray-drying, hot-pressing, shape forming,<br>
and bonding.<br>
According to the present invention, it is possible to<br>
present a write-once-read-many recording medium capable of<br>
recording small recording marks at higher degrees of modulated<br>
amplitudes with stability. With the use of the additional<br>
elements that have not been found so far, it is possible to<br>
provide a write-once-read-many optical recording medium<br>
having excellent recording and reproducing properties and<br>
reliabilities.<br>
Further, the present invention can provide a sputtering<br>
target suitable for arbitrarily forming a layer having a stable<br><br>
composition and structure, the production method thereof, and<br>
can also provide a high-density optical recording medium using<br>
the target.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in<br>
detail on an optical recording medium which comprises a<br>
recording layer in which a material of the present invention<br>
represented by BiOx (0 
write-once-read-many optical recording medium which comprises<br>
Bi, M and oxygen as constituent elements of a recording layer,<br>
referring to specific examples, however, the present invention is<br>
not limited to the disclosed examples.<br>
Example A-1<br>
On a polycarbonate-substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 21nm formed thereon, a layer having the<br>
composition represented by BiOx (0 
10nm was formed by sputtering to yield a write-once-read-many<br>
optical recording medium of the present invention. This layer<br>
was formed at a radiofrequency power of 100W and an Ar gas<br>
flow rate of 40sccm using a sputtering target having the<br>
composition of Bi2O3 and a diameter of 76.2mm.<br>
Recording was performed to the optical recording medium<br>
under the following conditions using an optical disk evaluation<br>
system DDU-1000 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL<br>
CO., LTD. having a lens numerical aperture of 0.65 at a<br><br>
wavelength of 405nm.<br>
•	Modulation Mode: 1-7 modulation<br>
•	Recording linear density: The shortest mark length<br>
(2T) = 0.231µm<br>
•	Recording linear velocity: 6.0m/s<br>
•	Waveform equalization: Normal equalizer<br>
As a result, an excellent jitter value of 9.9% was obtained<br>
in a consecutively recorded portion at a recording power of<br>
5.2mW, and excellent binary recording properties having a<br>
modulated amplitude of 55% were realized.<br>
Example A-2<br>
A write-once-read-many recording medium of the present<br>
invention was produced by sputtering a layer which comprises<br>
Fe and O, having a thickness of 10nm on a<br>
polycarbonate-substrate with a guide groove having a groove<br>
depth of 21nm formed thereon. This layer was formed at a<br>
radiofrequency power of 100W and an Ar gas flow rate of 40sccm<br>
using a sputtering target having the composition of Bi10Fe5Ox<br>
and a diameter of 76.2mm. The target was prepared by<br>
calcining a mixture of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 at a ratio of 2:1.<br>
Theoretically it should have been Bi10Fe5O22.5, however, the<br>
amount of oxygen was unable to be measured with accuracy<br>
because of leaked oxygen in a calcination process, and therefore<br>
the oxygen is represented by Ox.<br><br>
The optical recording medium was evaluated under the<br>
following conditions using an optical disk evaluation system<br>
DDU-1000 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD.<br>
having a lens numerical aperture of 0.65 at a wavelength of<br>
405nm.<br>
•	Modulation Mode- 1-7 modulation<br>
•	Recording linear density: The shortest mark length<br>
(2T) = 0.231pm<br>
•	Recording linear velocity: 6.0m/s<br>
•	Waveform equalization: Normal equalizer<br>
As a result, an excellent jitter value of 8.9% was obtained<br>
in a consecutively recorded portion at a recording power of<br>
5.8mW, and excellent binary recording properties having a<br>
modulated amplitude of 52% were realized.<br>
Example A-3<br>
Reflection EELS measurements were performed using a<br>
write-once-read-many optical recording medium produced and<br>
used for recording in Example A-1. A scanning Auger electron<br>
spectrometer PHI4300 manufactured by Perkin-Elmer was<br>
modified for the measurements. EELS stands for Electron<br>
Energy Loss Spectroscopy and is a spectroscopy system in which<br>
electrons are irradiated to a sample to measure an energy<br>
distribution of electrons scattered by interaction with the outer<br>
surface of the sample. When a primary electron of certain<br><br>
energy excites the inner shell of an atom to be measured, an<br>
electron of certain energy is discharged, resulting in the<br>
scattering of the primary electron. During this process, some<br>
energy is lost by the interaction with the neighboring atoms.<br>
Therefore, by examining the way the electrons are scattered,<br>
information such as radial distribution function of neighboring<br>
atoms can be obtained.<br>
The radial distribution function in the vicinity of an<br>
oxygen atom was measured based on the EELS spectrum<br>
obtained by EELS measurements. A radial distribution<br>
function represents a probability of existence of electron in the<br>
vicinity of an atom and enables calculations and presumptions of<br>
the valence and structure of the atom. Among analysis<br>
software packages based on the photoelectron multiple<br>
scattering theory, the FEFF software published by Washington<br>
University are widely used. The number of valences and<br>
structure thereof can be presumed by using this analysis<br>
software and referring the calculated values against actually<br>
measured values.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates values of radial distribution function<br>
measured by the method as stated above.<br>
FIG. 2 shows radial distribution functions calculated<br>
using an FEFF. The diagram shows radial distribution<br>
functions respectively in the case of Bitrivalent which could be<br><br>
taken by Bi; the case of Bi-trivalent however taking a structure<br>
of β-Bi2O3; and the case of BiO2 of Bi-tetravalence.<br>
Comparing these radial distribution functions, peaks 1011<br>
and 1012 in the vicinity of 6 angstrom in the recorded portion<br>
are distinctively shown. When comparing the two diagrams,<br>
the peaks 1011 and 1012 match each other. It proves that BiO2,<br>
i.e. BiO2 of tetravalent Bi exists in the recorded portion.<br>
A write-once-read-many optical recording medium having<br>
such a recording mark enables excellent recording with higher<br>
modulated amplitudes and realizing high-density recording.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be further<br>
described in detail on a write-once-read-many optical recording<br>
medium using the element L used in the present invention as an<br>
additional element, referring to Examples and Comparative<br>
Examples, however, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
disclosed examples.<br>
(Examples B-1 to B18)<br>
A write-once-read-many optical recording medium was<br>
produced by taking a structure in which a polyolefin-substrate<br>
(ZEONOR manufactured by NIPPON ZEON CO., LTD.); a<br>
recording layer which comprises bismuth as the principal<br>
constituent of the elements constituting the recording layer and<br>
a Bi oxide; a heat-insulating layer; and a reflective layer were<br>
formed in a laminar structure, and using the following materials<br><br>
for these respective layers.<br>
A sputtering target was produced using raw materials in<br>
which Bi2O3 and oxides of the element shown in Table 2 were<br>
mixed at a ratio from 2:1 to 5:1, and then a recording layer was<br>
formed using this sputtering target so as to have a thickness<br>
approx. 7nm.<br>
Table 2 shows resulting respective Pauling's<br>
electronegativity values of each element L added to the<br>
respective recording layer, and the standard enthalpy values of<br>
formation ∆Hf0 of oxides of the element L, however, these values<br>
are based on the definitions of the present invention. When the<br>
Pauling's electronegativity value is 1.80 or more, the standard<br>
enthalpy of formation ∆Hf° of oxides of the element L is not<br>
important, and thus some elements in Table 2 have not their<br>
values of ∆Hf0.<br>
As described above, in the present invention, Pauling's<br>
electronegativity values and standard enthalpy values of<br>
oxide-formation of an element L were obtained with each valence<br>
fixed to each element group. The individual valences of the<br>
individual elements based on the definitions of the present<br>
invention are also written in Table 2.<br>
In Table 2, the term type A represents an element L<br>
which falls under the definition (I) of the present invention, and<br>
the term type B represents an element L which falls under the<br><br>
definition (II) of the present invention.<br>
A material in which ZnS-SiO2 was used for a<br>
heat-insulating layer at a ratio of 85:15 (mol%) and formed so as<br>
to have a thickness of 15nm.<br>
For a reflective layer, an Ag alloy was used and formed so<br>
as to have a thickness of 100nm.<br>
The track pitch of a polyolefin substrate was 0.437µm and<br>
the thickness was 0.6mm.<br>
Recording was performed to these optical recording media<br>
under the following conditions using an optical disk evaluation<br>
system DDU1000 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL<br>
CO., LTD. having a lens numerical aperture of 0.65 at a<br>
wavelength of 405nm.<br>
As a result, extremely excellent recording and<br>
reproducing properties, i.e. jitter values shown in Table 2 were<br>
realized.<br><br>
•	Modulation Mode: 1-7 modulation<br>
•	Recording linear density: The shortest mark length<br>
(2T) = 0.204pm<br>
•	Recording linear velocity: 6.6m/s<br>
•	Waveform equalization: Limit equalizer<br>
•	Reproducing power: 0.5mW<br>
Next, these write-once-read-many optical recording media<br><br>
were left under the conditions at a temperature of 80°C and a<br>
relative humidity of 85% for 100 hours to measure the amount of<br>
change in jitter value. The amount of change in jitter value is<br>
calculated as follows:<br>
(Jitter value after a storage test) - (Initial jitter value)<br>
Table 2 shows the results.<br>
As is clear from Table 2, the elements satisfying the<br>
definition (I) for the element L of the present invention<br>
respectively demonstrated an excellent initial jitter value and a<br>
small degree of degradation in jitter value, suffering from the<br>
storage test.<br>
It was also demonstrated that the standard enthalpy of<br>
formation of oxides "∆Hf0" may take any values, as long as the<br>
definition (I) is satisfied.<br>
Also, the elements satisfying the definition (II) for the<br>
element L of the present invention respectively demonstrated an<br>
excellent initial jitter value and a small degree of degradation in<br>
jitter value suffering from the storage test.<br><br><br><br>
In the Examples above, the wavelength for recording and<br>
reproducing was set at 405nm, however, recording was also<br>
excellently performed with a jitter value of 9% or less for a laser<br>
beam at a wavelength of 660nm by adjusting the thickness of a<br>
heat-insulation layer from 15nm to 120nm. In the test, the<br>
track pitch of the substrate was 0.74µm, and the recording and<br>
reproducing conditions were based on those of DVD+R. The<br>
amount of increased jitter value obtained in the same storage<br>
test as the Examples above gave results substantially similar to<br>
those shown in Table 2.<br>
(Comparative Example B-1)<br>
A write-once-read-many optical recording medium was<br><br>
produced in the same manner as Example B-1, provided that the<br>
principal constituent is bismuth, and a recording layer formed<br>
by sputtering through the use of a metallic bismuth target was<br>
used instead of the recording layer containing a Bi oxide. The<br>
optical recording medium was then evaluated.<br>
The analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed<br>
that no bismuth oxide was detected in the recording layer except<br>
in the interface between the substrate and the recording layer<br>
and the interface between the recording layer and ZnS-SiO2.<br>
Thus, it proved that the recording layer produced in<br>
Comparative Example B-1 did not include a Bi oxide.<br>
As a result of the measurements of recording and<br>
reproducing properties, the initial jitter value exceeded 15%,<br>
and it was impossible to measure jitter after the storage test.<br>
From the results, the importance of a recording layer<br>
which comprises not only bismuth as the principal constituent<br>
but also a Bi oxide is confirmed.<br>
(Example B-19)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 50nm and a track pitch of 0.40µm formed<br>
thereon, a ZnS-SiO2 layer, i.e. an under coating layer having a<br>
thickness of 65nm and a BiPdO layer, i.e. a recording layer<br>
having a thickness of 15nm were disposed in this order in a<br>
laminar structure by sputtering. The atomic number ratio of Bi<br><br>
to Pd, or Bi:Pd was approx. 3:1.<br>
Next, on the recording layer, an organic-material layer,<br>
i.e. an upper coating layer which comprises a pigment or a dye<br>
represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 was formed by<br>
spin-coating so as to have the average thickness of approx. 30nm.<br>
On the organic-material layer, a reflective layer which comprises<br>
Ag, having a thickness of 150nm was disposed by sputtering,<br>
and then a protective layer made from an ultraviolet curable<br>
resin having a thickness of 5pm was further disposed on the<br>
reflective layer by spin-coating so as to thereby yield a<br>
write-once-read-many recording medium of the present<br>
invention.<br>
A pigment or a dye represented by Chemical Formula 1 is<br>
typically used for materials of conventional DVD±R, and such<br>
materials respectively have little absorption in blue-laser<br>
wavelengths.<br><br><br>

INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. at a wavelength of 405nm..<br>
The measurement of the optical recording medium<br>
resulted in an excellent value of PRSNR 22 at a recording power<br>
of 5.8mW, and excellent recording and reproducing properties<br>
were achieved.<br>
(Example B-20)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 20nm and a track pitch of 0.32µm formed<br>
thereon, a reflective layer made from Ag having a thickness of<br>
100nm, a ZnS-SiO2 layer, i.e. an upper coating layer having a<br>
thickness of 16nm and a BiPdO layer or a recording layer having<br>
a thickness of 7nm were disposed in this order in a laminar<br>
structure by sputtering. The atomic number ratio of Bi to Pd,<br>
or Bi:Pd was approx. 3:1.<br>
Next, a cover layer made from a resin having a thickness<br>
of 0.1mm was laminated on the recording layer to yield a<br>

resulted in an excellent jitter value of 6.0% at a recording power<br>
of 7.0mW, and excellent recording and reproducing properties<br>
were achieved.<br>

present invention was produced in the same manner as Example<br>

layer. The write-once-read-many optical recording medium was<br>
then evaluated. The atomic number ratio of Bi to B, or Bi:B<br>
was approx. 2:1.<br>

of 5.6mW, and it exemplified that excellent recording and<br>
reproducing properties are realizable with the optical recording<br>
medium.<br>
(Example B-22)<br>

then evaluated. The atomic number ratio of Bi to B, or Bi:B<br>
was approx.. 2:1.<br>
The measurement of the optical recording medium<br>
resulted in an excellent jitter value of 5.9% at a recording power<br>
of 6.7mW, and excellent recording and reproducing properties<br>
were achieved.<br>
(Example B-23)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 50nm and a track pitch of 0.32pm formed<br>
thereon, a reflective layer made from Ag having a thickness of<br>
100nm was formed by sputtering, an organic-material layer, i.e.<br>
an upper coating layer which comprises a pigment or a dye<br>
represented by Chemical Formula 1 was formed by spin-coating<br>
so as to have the average thickness of approx. 30nm, then a<br>
BiBO layer, i.e. a recording layer having a thickness of 15nm,<br>
and a ZnS-SiO2 layer, i.e. an under coating layer were disposed<br>
in this order in a laminar structure by sputtering. The atomic<br>
number ratio of Bi to B, or Bi:B was approx. 2:1.<br>
Next, a cover layer made from a transparent resin having<br>
a thickness of 100nm was laminated on the recording layer to<br>
thereby yield a write-once-read-many recording medium of the<br>
present invention.<br><br>
Recording and reproducing were performed to the optical<br>
recording medium under the recording and reproducing<br>
conditions in accordance with BD-R to evaluate it using an<br>
optical disk evaluation system having a numerical aperture of<br>
0.85 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. at a<br>
wavelength of 405nm..<br>
The measurement of the optical recording medium<br>
resulted in an excellent jitter value of 6.5% at a recording power<br>
of 4.8mW, and excellent recording and reproducing properties<br>
were achieved.<br>
(Example B24)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 40nm and a track pitch of 0.74pm formed<br>
thereon, a BiBO layer, i.e. a recording layer having a thickness<br>
of 15nm and a ZnS-SiO2 layer, i.e. an upper coating layer having<br>
a thickness of 40nm were disposed in this order in a laminar<br>
structure by sputtering. The atomic number ratio of Bi to B, or<br>
Bi:B was approx.. 2:1.<br>
Next, on the recording layer, a reflective layer made from<br>
Ag having a thickness of 100nm and a protective layer made<br>
from an ultraviolet curable resin having a thickness of approx.<br>
5pm were disposed to thereby yield a write-once-read-many<br>
recording medium of the present invention.<br>
Recording and reproducing were performed to the optical<br><br>
recording medium under the recording and reproducing<br>
conditions in accordance with DVD+R to evaluate it using an<br>
optical disk evaluation system DDU-1000 having a numerical<br>
aperture of 0.65 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO.,<br>
LTD. at a wavelength of 660nm.<br>
The measurement of the optical recording medium<br>
resulted in a jitter value of 7.2% at a recording power of 12.0mW,<br>
and excellent recording and reproducing properties were<br>
achieved.<br>
(Example B-25)<br>
A write-once-read-many optical recording medium of the<br>
present invention was produced in the same manner as Example<br>
B-24, provided that Sb was added to the materials of the<br>
recording layer. The write-once-read-many optical recording<br>

The measurement of the optical recording medium<br>
resulted in a jitter value of 7.6% at a recording power of 10.0mW,<br>
and excellent recording and reproducing properties were<br>
achieved.<br>
(Example B-26)<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 20nm and a track pitch of 0.437µm formed<br>
thereon, a BiPdO layer, i.e. a recording layer having a thickness<br><br>
of 5nm and a ZnS-SiO2 layer, i.e. an upper coating layer having<br>
a thickness of 15nm were disposed in this order in a laminar<br>
structure by sputtering. On the ZnS_SiO2 layer, a reflective<br>
layer which comprises Ag, having a thickness of 100nm was<br>
disposed by sputtering, and a protective layer which comprises<br>
an ultraviolet curable resin, having a thickness of approx. 5pm<br>
was further disposed by spin-coating to thereby yield a<br>
write-once-read-many optical recording medium of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In Example B-26, the atomic number ratio of the total<br>
amount of Pd to bismuth was changed in the recording layer to<br>
evaluate jitter value. The recording and reproducing conditions<br>
were same as those in Examples B-l to B-18.<br>
The measurement of the optical recording medium, as<br>
shown in FIG. 3, exemplified that an excellent jitter value can<br>
be obtained in the range where the atomic number ratio of the<br>
total amount of Pd relative to bismuth is 1.25 or less. The<br>
value 1.25 is represented by the dotted-line in FIG. 3. In<br>
addition, it was exemplified that the elements defined in the<br>
present invention except for Pd respectively have a tendency<br>
similar to the above.<br>
Next, the present invention relating to the sputtering<br>
target will be specifically described referring to examples and<br>
comparative examples, however, the present invention is not<br><br>
limited to the disclosed examples.<br>
Example C-1<br>
Powders of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 were mixed so that the<br>
atomic ratio of Bi to Fe was 6:5 and then mixed in a ball mill by<br>
dry-process for 1 hour. The mixed powder was formed by<br>
pressing at 100MPa to 200MPa and then calcined at 750°C for 5<br>
hours in the atmosphere to yield a sputtering target. The<br>
target had a diameter of 152.4φ and a thickness of 4mm. The<br>
target was bounded to a backing plate made from oxygen-free<br>
copper by metal bonding to yield a sputtering target 1. The<br>
sputtering target had a packing density of 75%.<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern of the sputtering target was<br>
measured. The measurement conditions are as shown in Table<br>
3. FIG. 4 shows the measurement results.<br>
To identify diffraction peak positions obtained in the<br>
measurement, the diffraction peak positions were searched and<br>
checked against those of known substances. The diagram<br>
marked with (a) at the top of FIG. 4 represents the diffraction<br>
pattern of target 1. The diagram marked with (b) represents<br>
diffraction peak positions of BiFeO3 which are based on known<br>
data. In X-ray diffraction analysis, data on the position of<br>
diffraction lines and on the intensities of substances have been<br>
compiled in a database from the source of data on X-ray<br>
diffraction measured in the past. Therefore, the measured<br><br>
substance can be identified by comparing the measured<br>
diffraction result with the previous data. As a result of a<br>
search after comparing BiFeO3 data marked with (b) with the<br>
measured data marked with (a), it was found that diffraction<br>
peaks with a mark "°" were those of BiFeO3. Similarly, the<br>
diagram marked with (c) is the known data of Fe2O3, and the<br>
diagram marked with (d) is the known data of Bi2O3. Similarly,<br>
diffraction peaks of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 were identified. The<br>
greatest peak was the one corresponding to BiFe2O3, and this<br>
demonstrated that this compound is the principal component.<br>
Further, the sputtering target was subjected to the ICP analysis,<br>
i.e. the inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry. Part<br>
of the sputtering target was dissolved in an aqua regia as a<br>
sample and then diluted with superpure water for the analysis.<br>
For the solution, elements of Co, Ca, and Cr were respectively<br>
analyzed. The result of analysis was that the content of the<br>
respective elements was less than the detection limit.<br><br><br>
Example 02<br>
An optical recording medium was produced using the<br>
sputtering target prepared in Example C-1.<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 50nm and a track pitch of 0.44pm formed<br>
thereon, a BiFeO layer having a thickness of 15nm was formed<br>
by sputtering, an organic-material layer containing a pigment or<br>
a dye represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 was<br>
formed on the BiFeO layer by spin-coating so as to have the<br>
average thickness of approx. 30nm, a reflective layer made from<br>
Ag having a thickness of 150nm was disposed on the<br>
organic-material layer by sputtering, and then a protective layer<br>
made from an ultraviolet curable resin having a thickness of<br>
approx. 5pm was further disposed on the reflective layer by<br>
spin-coating to thereby yield a write-once-read-many recording<br>
medium of the present invention. A pigment or a dye<br>
represented by Chemical Formula 1 is typically used for<br>
materials of conventional DVD±R, and such materials<br>
respectively have little absorption in blue-laser wavelengths.<br><br><br>
Binary recording was performed to the optical recording<br>
medium under the following conditions using an optical disk<br>
evaluation system DDU-1000 having a numerical aperture of<br>
0.65 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. at a<br>
wavelength of 405nm.<br><br>
•	Modulation Mode: 8-16 modulation<br>
•	Recording linear density: 1T = 0.0917pm<br>
The shortest mark length (3T) = 0.275pm<br>
•	Recording linear velocity: 6.0m/s<br>
•	Waveform equalization: Normal equalizer<br>
As a result, as shown in FIG. 5, an excellent jitter value<br>
of 10.2% was obtained at a recording power of 6.1mW, and<br>
excellent recording properties were realized.<br><br>
Example C-3<br>
Sputtering target 2 was prepared in the same manner as<br>
Example C-1, provided that powders of Bi2O3 and Fe2O3 were<br>
mixed so that the atomic ratio of Bi to Fe was 35:5. The<br>
sputtering target had a packing density of 67%.<br>
X-ray diffraction pattern of the sputtering target was<br>
measured. The measurement conditions were as shown in Table<br>
3. FIG. 6 shows the measurement result.<br>
To identify diffraction peak positions obtained in the<br>
measurement, the diffraction peak positions were referred to<br>
those of known substances. As shown in FIG. 6, most if not all<br>
peaks of the diffraction pattern matched to those of Bi25FeO40-<br>
As a matter of course, the highest peak was that of Bi25FeO40,<br>
and it proves that this compound was the principal constituent.<br>
Example C-4<br>
An optical recording medium was produced using the<br>
sputtering target prepared in Example C-3.<br>
On a polycarbonate substrate with a guide groove having<br>
a groove depth of 50nm and a track pitch of 0.44pm formed<br>
thereon, a ZnSSiO2 layer having a thickness of 50nm and a<br>
BiFeO layer having a thickness of 15nm were formed in this<br>
order in a laminar structure by sputtering, an organic-material<br>
layer containing a pigment or a dye represented by the following<br>
Chemical Formula 1 was formed on the BiFeO layer by<br><br>
spin-coating so as to have the average thickness of approx. 30nm,<br>
a reflective layer which comprises Ag, having a thickness of<br>
150nm was disposed on the organic-material layer by sputtering,<br>
and then a protective layer made from an ultraviolet curable<br>
resin having a thickness of approx. 5pm was further disposed on<br>
the reflective layer by spin-coating to thereby yield a<br>

represented by Chemical Formula 1 is typically used for<br>
materials of conventional DVD±R, and such materials<br>
respectively have little absorption in blue-laser wavelengths.<br>
Binary recording was performed to the optical recording<br>
medium under the following conditions, using an optical disk<br>
evaluation system DDU-1000 having a numerical aperture of<br>
0.65 manufactured by PULSTEC INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD. at a<br>
wavelength of 405nm.<br><br>
•	Modulation Mode: 8-16 modulation<br>
•	Recording linear density: IT = 0.0917pm<br>

medium having a high modulated amplitude and a wide range of<br>
recording power margin was enabled without a great change in<br>
reproducing signal level or RF level of the recorded portions.<br>
