METHOD FOR CONTROLLING A WASTE WATER CONCENTRATION OF CLEANING<br>
SOLUTION CONTAINING PHOSPHORUS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling<br>
the concentration of P (phosphorus) in cleaning solution waste<br>
water.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The processing steps for fabricating steel products<br>
generate various kinds of waste waters that are discharged.<br>
Hazardous substances may be contained in those waste waters<br>
if they remain untreated. Waste water containing hazardous<br>
substances are sent from various processing steps to a waste<br>
water treatment process. In a waste water treatment plant,<br>
the waste water is neutralized, sedimented, and otherwise<br>
treated, and hazardous components are treated as refractory<br>
substances and separated by sedimentation (see patent<br>
references 1 and 2).<br>
For example, a surface treatment or activating process<br>
is performed as a post treatment of a galvanizing process in<br>
a hot-dip galvanizing line. In the surface treatment,<br>
galvanized steel sheets are rinsed with a surface treatment<br>
liquid containing P after a cleaning process (see, for example,<br>
patent reference 3). Since the surface treatment liquid and<br>
the waste water from the rinsing water contain a P component<br>
of the surface treatment or activating process, it is<br>
impossible to drain out them directly. Therefore, waste water<br>
from a surface treatment or activating process is drained to<br>
a drainage pit within the galvanizing line. The waste water<br>
is sent from the drainage pit to a waste water treatment plant,<br>
where the waste water is neutralized, sedimented and otherwise<br>
treated. The waste water is sedimented and separated while<br>
treating the P component as a refractory substance.<br>
However, if the P concentration of the waste water sent<br>
to the waste water treatment plant is high, it is impossible<br>
to neutralize, sediment and otherwise treat the waste water<br>
in the waste water treatment plant. Consequently, an upper<br>
limit of the P concentration of the waste water that can be<br>
sent into the waste water treatment plant is established. It<br>
is necessary to immediately stop sending of the waste water<br>
into the waste water treatment plant if the P concentration<br>
of the waste water from the drainage pit exceeds the upper limit<br>
of P concentration. If the flow of waste water into the waste<br>
water treatment plant is stopped, operation of the galvanizing<br>
line is typically stopped.<br>
It is therefore customary to employ a waste water buffer<br>
tank capable of storing the waste water to prevent operation<br>
of the hot-dip galvanizing line from being stopped when waste<br>
water exceeding the upper limit of P concentration is produced.<br>
Feeding the waste water into the waste water treatment plant<br>
is stopped when the P concentration of the waste water exceeds<br>
the upper limit of P concentration. The waste water is then<br>
stored in the waste water buffer tank.<br>
However, if the operation is run after stopping the flow<br>
of waste water into the waste water treatment plant, the<br>
operation can run only for a short time until the waste water<br>
buffer tank becomes full.<br>
It is also possible to dilute the waste water by adding<br>
diluting water into a waste water buffer tank such that the<br>
P concentration of the waste water becomes lower than the upper<br>
limit of P concentration such that the waste water can be sent<br>
to a waste water treatment plant. The thus diluted waste water<br>
can be sent to the waste water treatment plant. However, this<br>
method has the problem that the amount of waste water increases .<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method for controlling the concentration of P in cleaning<br>
solution waste water in such a way that sending waste water with<br><br>
high P concentrations and large amounts of waste water<br>
containing P into a waste water treatment plant can be prevented.<br>
This can assist in avoiding interrupting the operation of the<br>
galvanizing line.<br>
To achieve the above-described object, the present<br>
invention provides a method for controlling the concentration<br>
of P in cleaning solution waste water, the method comprising<br>
the steps of:<br>
providing a waste water buffer tank which, after<br>
receiving waste water of the cleaning solution containing P,<br>
can send the waste water to a waste water treatment plant or<br>
store the waste water;<br>
treating matter to be treated while setting the<br>
concentration of the cleaning solution containing P within a<br>
target concentration range;<br>
measuring the concentration of P in the waste water of<br>
the cleaning solution in the waste water buffer tank;<br>
sending the waste water of the cleaning solution<br>
containing P from the waste water buffer tank to the waste water<br>
treatment plant when the measured value of the P concentration<br>
is less than a tolerable upper limit; and<br>
stopping the flow of the waste water of the cleaning<br>
solution containing P to the waste water treatment plant,<br>
storing the waste water in the waste water buffer tank, and<br>
treating the matter to be treated while reducing the<br><br>
concentration of the cleaning solution containing P to a value<br>
within the target concentration range when the measured value<br>
of the P concentration is higher than the tolerable upper limit.<br>
A method for controlling the concentration of P in<br>
cleaning solution waste water.<br>
In the above-described method for controlling<br>
concentration of P in the waste water, if the measured value<br>
of the concentration of P in the waste water stored in the waste<br>
water buffer tank becomes less than the tolerable upper limit,<br>
it is desired to send the waste water to the waste water treatment<br>
plant from the waste water buffer tank.<br>
Furthermore, in the above-described method, when sending<br>
the waste water from the waste water buffer tank to the waste<br>
water treatment plant is begun, it is desired to increase the<br>
P concentration to a value within the target range.<br>
According to the present invention, when the<br>
concentration of P in the cleaning solution waste water has<br>
reached the tolerable upper limit, the concentration of P can<br>
be reduced to below the tolerable upper limit by reducing the<br>
concentration of P to a target lower limit. Therefore, it is<br>
possible to prevent waste water having high P concentrations<br>
and large amounts of waste water containing P from being sent<br>
to the waste water treatment plant while continuing the<br>
operation.<br><br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br><br>
Embodiments of the present invention are described taking<br>
a surface treatment or activating step as an example, the<br>
surface treatment or activating step being performed after a<br>
hot-dip galvanizing step on a hot-dip galvanizing line. The<br>
surface treatment or activating step is performed to improve<br>
the press moldability at the customer's site.<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram illustrating the surface<br>
treatment or activating step on the hot-dip galvanizing line.<br>
In Fig. 1, there is shown a steel sheet (hot-dip galvanized<br>
steel sheet) 1, a surface treatment or activating apparatus 2,<br>
a rinsing apparatus 3, a drier 4, a drainage pit 5, a waste water<br>
buffer tank 6, and a surface treatment tank 7.<br>
The surface treatment tank 7 holds a surface treatment<br>
or activating liquid containing P. With respect to the<br>
concentration of P of the surface treatment or activating liquid,<br>
a target concentration median CM, a target upper limit value<br>
CU, and a target lower limit value CL are set, taking account<br>
of the quality of the galvanized steel sheet, operability, and<br>
so on. The target upper limit value CU and target lower limit<br>
value CL are set to concentrations at which the operation and<br>
quality present no problems if a concentration within the range<br>
is adopted as a P concentration-set value (described later) of<br>
the surface treatment or activating liquid. CU to CL give the<br>
target concentration range.<br>
The surface treatment tank 7 has a surface treatment<br><br>
stock solution supply tank 11 that stores the surface treatment<br>
liquid stock solution in the surface treatment tank 7, a pure<br>
water supply tube 12 that supplies pure water, a P concentration<br>
meter 14, and a liquid level meter (not shown) that detects<br>
the liquid level, controls the concentration of the surface<br>
treatment or activating liquid, and controls the liquid level.<br>
The liquid level control is provided as follows. Two<br>
kinds of liquid level, or a low liquid level and a high liquid<br>
level, are set. When the liquid level becomes the low liquid<br>
level, pure water is supplied. When the liquid level becomes<br>
the high liquid level, the supply of pure water is stopped.<br>
Thus, the liquid level is kept roughly between the low and high<br>
liquid levels.<br>
With respect to the concentration control, when the<br>
concentration of P measured by the P concentration meter 14<br>
is less than the set value of the concentration of P (this<br>
concentration is referred to as the set value of P<br>
concentration) of the controlled surface treatment liquid, the<br>
surface treatment liquid stock solution is supplied from the<br>
surface treatment stock solution supply tank 11, based on the<br>
difference between the set value of P concentration and the<br>
measured value of P concentration such that the P concentration<br>
in the surface treatment tank 7 becomes the set value of P<br>
concentration. In normal operation, the target concentration<br>
median CM is adopted as the set value of P concentration of the<br><br>
surface treatment or activating liquid.<br>
The surface treatment or activating apparatus 2 sprays<br>
the surface treatment liquid containing P received in the<br>
surface treatment tank 7, using a pump 22, from a sprayer 13<br>
to the steel sheet 1, and squeezes out the surface treatment<br>
liquid by the wringer roll 25 located at the exit. Then, the<br>
steel sheet 1 exiting from the surface treatment or activating<br>
apparatus 2 is introduced into the rinsing apparatus 3. The<br>
rinsing apparatus 3 sprays the pure water supplied from the pure<br>
water supply tube 15 to the steel sheet 1 from a sprayer 16.<br>
The water is squeezed out by the wringer roll 25 located at the<br>
exit. The steel sheet 1 is made to exit from the rinsing<br>
apparatus 3 and dried by the drier 4. Then, the sheet is wound<br>
up by a winder on the exit side.<br>
The surface treatment liquid containing P and supplied<br>
to the surface treatment or activating apparatus 2 and the<br>
rinsing water from the rinsing apparatus 3 flow into the drainage<br>
pit 5 through the drain tubes 18 connected, respectively, with<br>
lower portions of the apparatuses. The waste water from the<br>
drainage pit 5 is sent to the waste water buffer tank 6.<br>
The drainage pit 5 is equipped with a pump 23 that sends<br>
the waste water to a waste water buffer tank 6 and with a liquid<br>
level meter (not shown) that detects the liquid level of the<br>
waste water. When the liquid level of the waste water becomes<br>
the preset high liquid level, the pump 23 sends the waste water<br><br>
to the waste water buffer tank 6. When the level becomes the<br>
preset low liquid level, the pump 23 is stopped.<br>
The waste water buffer tank 6 receives waste water from<br>
the drainage pit 5 and sends the waste water to a waste water<br>
treatment plant or stores the water in the waste water buffer<br>
tank 6. The waste water buffer tank 6 is made larger in capacity<br>
than the drainage pit 5. The tank capacity is appropriately<br>
determined taking account of the amount of stored waste water.<br>
The upper limit (hereinafter referred to as the "tolerable upper<br>
limit") of the concentration of P that can be sent from the waste<br>
water buffer tank 6 to the waste water treatment plant has been<br>
determined previously.<br>
The waste water buffer tank 6 has a pump 24 that sends<br>
the waste water to the waste water treatment plant, a P<br>
concentration meter 17 that detects the concentration of P in<br>
the waste water in the waste water buffer tank 6, and a liquid<br>
level meter (not shown) that detects the liquid level of the<br>
waste water. With respect to the liquid level, a low liquid<br>
level 1 used when the waste water is sent to the waste water<br>
treatment plant, a low liquid level 2 (the low liquid level 1<br>
is lower than the low liquid level 2) , and a maximum liquid level<br>
(limit liquid level of the stored liquid) are set. Making the<br>
positions of the low liquid level 1 and low liquid level 2 as<br>
low as possible compared with the position of the maximum liquid<br>
level is advantageous in increasing the amount of the liquid<br><br>
stored in the waste water buffer tank 6.<br>
The waste water buffer tank 6 measures the concentration<br>
of P in the waste water with the P concentration meter 17, and<br>
sends the waste water to the waste water treatment plant with<br>
the pump 24 when the measured value of the concentration of P<br>
is lower than the tolerable upper limit. When the waste water<br>
is sent to the waste water treatment plant, if the liquid level<br>
of the waste water becomes the low liquid level 2, the pump 24<br>
engages. The pump 24 is stopped if the level becomes the low<br>
liquid level 1.<br>
When the concentration of P measured by the P<br>
concentration meter 17 is higher than the tolerable upper limit,<br>
the pump 24 is stopped and the flow of waste water to the waste<br>
water treatment plant is stopped. The waste water is stored<br>
in the waste water buffer tank 6.<br>
If the processing described above is performed, the<br>
liquid level of the surface treatment liquid in the surface<br>
treatment tank 7 drops and the following control of the liquid<br>
level and control of the concentration are carried out. Pure<br>
water is supplied from the pure water supply tube 12 when the<br>
liquid level becomes a low liquid level. The flow of pure water<br>
is stopped when the liquid level becomes a high liquid level.<br>
The concentration of P of the surface treatment liquid drops<br>
because of the supply of pure water. Then, the surface<br>
treatment liquid stock solution is supplied from the surface<br><br>
treatment stock solution supply tank 11. The surface treatment<br>
liquid stock solution containing a high concentration of P is<br>
supplied from the surface treatment liquid stock solution<br>
supply tank 11 using the pump 21 according to the difference<br>
between the measured value of the concentration of P measured<br>
by the P concentration meter 14 and the set value of the<br>
concentration of P. Control is provided such that the<br>
concentration of P in the surface treatment tank 7 becomes the<br>
preset value of concentration of P.<br>
When this control is performed with the surface treatment<br>
tank 7, the P concentration becomes higher when the surface<br>
treatment liquid stock solution is supplied. The P<br>
concentration of the waste water sent to the waste water buffer<br>
tank 6 increases correspondingly when the P concentration in<br>
the surface treatment tank 7 becomes high.<br>
The pump 24 is stopped when the concentration of P in the<br>
waste water buffer tank 6 measured by the P concentration meter<br>
17 becomes higher than the tolerable upper limit. The flow of<br>
water to the waste water treatment plant is stopped. The waste<br>
water is stored in the waste water buffer tank 6.<br>
At the same time, the set value of the concentration of<br>
P in the surface treatment tank 7 is modified and reduced to<br>
a value within the target concentration range. Preferably, the<br>
P concentration is set to the target lower limit value CL. The<br>
P concentration of the waste water flowing into the waste water<br><br>
buffer tank 6 immediately diluted with pure water is reduced<br>
to below the tolerable upper limit by reducing the set value<br>
of P concentration in the surface treatment tank 7 (preferably,<br>
by modifying the target lower limit value CL).<br>
The waste water which is stored in the waste water buffer<br>
tank 6 and has a concentration of P exceeding the tolerable<br>
concentration is diluted with newly pumped waste water having<br>
a concentration of P less than the tolerable upper limit. The<br>
pump 24 engages if the P concentration measured by the P<br>
concentration meter 17 in the waste water buffer tank 6 becomes<br>
lower than the tolerable upper limit. The waste water stored<br>
in the waste water buffer tank 6 is sent to the waste water<br>
treatment plant. The pump 24 is stopped when the liquid level<br>
drops to the low liquid level 1. Subsequently, the waste water<br>
flows to the waste water treatment plant by a normal method of<br>
disposing of waste water, i.e., the pump 24 engages at the low<br>
liquid level 2 and the pump 24 is stopped at the low liquid level<br>
1.<br>
When the concentration of P in the waste water buffer tank<br>
6 measured by the P concentration meter 17 becomes lower than<br>
the tolerable upper limit and the operation of the pump 24 in<br>
the waste water buffer tank 6 is resumed, the set value of P<br>
concentration in the surface treatment tank 7 is modified and<br>
increased to a value within the target concentration range from<br>
the target lower limit value CU. Preferably, the value is set<br><br>
to the original target concentration median CM.<br>
By performing steps as described above, sending waste<br>
water having high concentrations of P and large amounts of waste<br>
water containing P to the waste water treatment plant can be<br>
prevented while continuing upstream operations. If the amount<br>
of waste water from the waste water buffer tank 6 reaches the<br>
maximum liquid level before the P concentration measured by the<br>
P concentration meter 17 becomes lower than the tolerable upper<br>
limit, the upstream operation is stopped and disposal of the<br>
waste water from the surface treatment step is stopped.<br>
The method of the present invention can be used as a method<br>
for controlling the concentration of P in waste water of general<br>
cleaning solution containing P, as well as of waste water<br>
produced from the above-described processing steps and<br>
containing P.<br>
Example<br>
In the surface treatment step on the hot-dip galvanizing<br>
line shown in Fig. 1, the processing was done under the<br>
following conditions. In the present embodiment, the upper<br>
limit (tolerable upper limit) of the concentration of P in the<br>
waste water that can be sent to the waste water treatment plant<br>
is 6 mass ppm.<br>
(1) Surface treatment or activating apparatus<br>
P concentration of surface treatment liquid: 10 mass ppm<br><br>
(target concentration median) ± 5 mass ppm (target range)<br>
Target lower limit value CL: 5 mass ppm<br>
Flow rate of surface treatment liquid: 5 m3/Hr<br>
(2) Rinsing apparatus<br>
Flow rate of pure water: 5 m3/Hr<br>
(3) Waste water buffer tank<br>
Capacity: 100 m3<br>
The tank capacity of 100 m3 is a capacity permitting about<br>
10-hour operation taking account of processing of materials<br>
requiring surface treatment and materials not requiring surface<br>
treatment.<br>
When the surface treatment step is performed while the<br>
value of the concentration of P in the surface treatment tank<br>
7 is set to 10 mass ppm (target concentration median) , if the<br>
concentration of P in the waste water buffer tank 6 increases<br>
and becomes equal to the tolerable upper limit of the waste<br>
buffer tank 6, i.e., 6 mass ppm, the flow of waste water to the<br>
waste water treatment plant is stopped and the waste water is<br>
stored in the waste water buffer tank 6. At the same time, the<br>
set value of the concentration of P in the surface treatment<br>
tank 7 is modified from 10 mass ppm to 5 mass ppm (target lower<br>
limit value).<br>
Fig. 2 shows one example of transition of set values of<br>
the concentration of P of the surface treatment liquid in the<br>
surface treatment tank 7, concentration of P measured by the<br><br>
P concentration meter, and concentration of P measured by the<br>
P concentration meter in the waste water buffer tank 6 before<br>
and after the set value of the concentration of P in the surface<br>
treatment tank 7 was modified from 10 mass ppm to 5 mass ppm.<br>
The target value (concentration preferable for disposal of<br>
waste water) of the concentration of P in the waste water buffer<br>
tank 6 in the present embodiment is 3 mass ppm.<br>
Because the set value of concentration of P in the surface<br>
treatment tank 7 was modified from 10 mass ppm to 5 mass ppm,<br>
the concentration of P in the waste water buffer tank 6 decreased<br>
from 6 mass ppm to 3 mass ppm. At the instant when the<br>
concentration of P in the waste water buffer tank 6 dropped to<br>
3 mass ppm, the flow of waste water to the waste water treatment<br>
plant was resumed. During this interval, the liquid level of<br>
the waste water in the waste water buffer tank was lower than<br>
the maximum liquid level. The operation was continued without<br>
stopping the line.<br>
The P concentration in the waste water buffer tank 6<br>
increased to 6 mass ppm under the condition where the set value<br>
of the concentration of P in the surface treatment tank 7 was<br>
10 mass ppm, for the following reason. The liquid level in the<br>
surface treatment tank 7 dropped and pure water was supplied.<br>
Then, the surface treatment liquid stock solution was supplied<br>
from the surface treatment stock solution supply tank 11,<br>
increasing the concentration of P.<br><br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The present invention can be used as a method for<br>
controlling the concentration of P in waste water in such a way<br>
that the flow of waste water having high P concentrations and<br>
large amounts of waste water containing P to a waste water<br>
treatment plant can be prevented when matter to be treated is<br>
treated using a cleaning solution containing P. This can assist<br>
in avoiding interrupting operation of the galvanizing line.<br><br>
What is claimed is:<br>
1. A method for controlling the concentration of P in<br>
cleaning solution waste water, the method comprising the steps<br>
of:<br>
providing a waste water buffer tank which, after<br>
receiving waste water of the cleaning solution containing P,<br>
can send the waste water to a waste water treatment plant or<br>
store the waste water;<br>
treating matter to be treated while setting the<br>
concentration of the cleaning solution containing P within a<br>
target concentration range;<br>
measuring the concentration of P in the waste water of<br>
the cleaning solution containing P in the waste water buffer<br>
tank;<br>
sending the waste water of the cleaning solution<br>
containing P from the waste water buffer tank to the waste water<br>
treatment plant when the measured value of the P concentration<br>
is less than a tolerable upper limit; and<br>
stopping the flow of the waste water of the cleaning<br>
solution containing P to the waste water treatment plant,<br>
storing the waste water in the waste water buffer tank, and<br>
treating the matter to be treated while reducing the<br>
concentration of the cleaning solution containing P to a value<br>
within the target concentration range when the measured value<br><br>
of the P concentration is higher than the tolerable upper limit.<br>
2. The method for controlling a waste water concentration<br>
of cleaning solution containing P according to claim 1,<br>
wherein when the measured value of the concentration of P<br>
in the waste water and stored in the waste water buffer tank<br>
becomes less than the tolerable upper limit, the waste water<br>
is sent from the waste water buffer tank to the waste water<br>
treatment plant.<br>
3. The method for controlling a waste water concentration<br>
of cleaning solution containing P according to claim 2,<br>
wherein if sending the waste water from the waste water<br>
buffer tank to the waste water treatment plant is started, the<br>
concentration of P in the cleaning solution is increased to a<br>
value within the target range.<br><br><br>
A method of controlling the concentration of P of<br>
cleaning solution waste water starts with providing a waste<br>
water buffer tank capable of either sending the waste water<br>
to a waste water treatment plant or storing the waste water<br>
after the waste water is accepted. The concentration of P in<br>
the cleaning solution is set within a target concentration<br>
range, and matter to be treated is treated. The concentration<br>
of P in the waste water is measured in the waste water buffer<br>
tank. When the measured value of the concentration of P is<br>
less than a tolerable upper limit, the waste water is sent from<br>
the waste water buffer tank to the waste water treatment plant.<br>
When the measured value of the concentration of P is higher<br>
than the tolerable upper limit, sending the waste water to the<br>
waste water treatment plant is stopped, and the waste water<br>
is stored in the waste water buffer tank. The concentration<br>
of P is reduced to a value within the target concentration range,<br>
and the matter to be treated is treated.</td>
