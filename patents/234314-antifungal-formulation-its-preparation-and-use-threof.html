				<td>Improved anti-dermatophytic preparation and use thereof Field of invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved preparation based on the synergistic action of garlic extract and essential oil of M. spicata var. Ganga or cinnamon oil against dermatophytic fungus. More particularly, the present invention relates to the synergistic enhancement of activity of a combination by menthyl acetate or Geraniol. The invention also provides a method of preparation of the synergistic combination and the shelf life observed to be more than one year. The cream based preparation is a potent anti-dermatophytic as described and illustrated by in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Back Ground of the invention<br>
Garlic, Allium sativum L (Liliaceae) has been used traditionally to treat a number of infectious diseases including those caused by bacteria, fungi, protozoa and viruses (Nor best. D. Weber et al. 1992, Planta Medica 58:418). Beside these, it has also been used for broad range of therapeutic properties including anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, anti-atherogenic, anti-coagulant anti-cancer and neurotropic. (M. Colic, et al Phytomedicine 9: 117-124. 2002).<br>
A number of reports are available on in vitro and in vivo efficacy of garlic oil, juice, extract (water or solvent) or lyophilised water extract against plant and human pathogens causing fungal and bacterial infections. The activity of garlic against dermatophytosis i.e. the superficial infections of skin or keratinised tissue of man and animals can be very well visualised from the reports of Venugopal and Venugopal 1995 and Prasad et al 1982, 1983 and 1987. Venugopal, 1995 [International Journal of Dermatology 34(4) 278-279] reported the activity of garlic extracts against 88 clinical isolates of dermatophytes by agar dilution technique, which includes Microsporum cannis, M, audouinii Trichophyton rubrum T. mentagraphytes, T. violaccum, T. simii, T. verrucosum T. erinacci and Epidermophytn floccosum. while Prasad et al, 1982, 1983 reported clinical findings of garlic extract against dermatophytes in animals and human beings, [Indian Journal of Medical research 1982 465-467, Indian Veterinary Medical journal 1983 7 (3) 161-163 and Poultry science 1981 60 (3) 541-545 Indian Veterinary Medical journal 1987 11 (2) 108-110] Besides these reports, many workers have described effect of garlic extract against isolated or experimental infections ,those include the work of Sharma S.R. et al 1994 [International journal of Animal sciences 9 (2) 239-240.] Sharma M.C. [Indian Veterinary Journal 1990 67 (3) 269-271,] Thakur DK et al [Indian journal of Animal-Health 1987 26 (1) 31-34 &amp; Indian veterinary journal 1983 60 (10) 799-801] Upadhyay.MP et al 1980 [Journal of general &amp; applied microbiology 1980 26 6, 421-424.] Rajora V.S. Indian Veterinary Journal 1982. 59 (10) 815-817.<br>
All the above reports and many others have utilized garlic extract (solvent or water), juice, or oil for the in vitro or in vivo evaluation of the infections caused by various species of dermatophytes viz. Trichophyton Microsporum Epidermophyton and yeast like fungi of genera Canddia, Ccryptococcus,Rhodotorula. Torulopsis trichosporon. It is also evident from the above reports that Garlic can be utilized in broad spectrum antifungal preparation for topical application but the instability of the activity and the disagreeable smell are two main constraints in its formulations as the activity of garlic juice / extract degrade &amp; finally lost on storage and higher concentration produces disagreeable smell. The loss in activity due to storage may be attributed to the fact that garlic possesses unstable compounds. Up to now more than 200 different biologically active substances has been isolated from garlic, among them organosulphur compounds such as allicin azoenes, diallyltrisulfide (DATS) or s-allylcystein, are considered the most important biologically active compound found in crushed or homogenised garlic [Colic M et. al.Phytomedicine 2000 9 117 -124 ]. It is unstable in the presence of heat or organic solvent and forms a variety of degraded compounds. Allicin is not present in garlic but is rapidly procured when its precursor alliin is cleaved by alliinase upon crushing or mincing of garlic because allin and alliinase are very stable when dry. Garlic powders have potential to preserve allin without degradation the allicin. However some powder preparations do release allicin upon aqueous contact which vary depending upon the source.<br>
Due to pronounced antibacterial and antifungal properties garlic have been used as insecticides to control plant diseases such as army worms, aphids and Colorado beetles. Anderson et al, U.S. Pat No. 5,733,552 has utilised garlic extract &amp; water to repel mosquito.<br>
Hsu, et al, 2001, US. Patent 6, 231, 685 entitle " Natural pesticide" has utilized garlic oil or extracts in combination with essential oils and found an improvement in insecticidal and fungicidal activity. They have utilized various combinations to control insects and fungal infection on plants. The invention also describes a synergistic effect of garlic oil or extract combined with essential oils, resulting in improved insecticidal, fungicidal activities. The essential oils described in this patent are cotton seed oil, soyabean oil, cinnamon oil corn oil, cedar oil, castor oil, clove oil, geranium oil, lemon grass oil, linseed oil, mint oil, sesame oil, thyme oil, rosemary oil, anise oil, basil oil, camphor oil, citronella oil, Eucalyptus oil, Fennel oil, Ginger oil, grapefruit oil, lemon oil, mandarin oil, orange oil, pine needle oil, pepper oil, rose oil, tangerine oil, tea tree oil, tee seed oil, mineral and fish oil.<br>
But till today no report is available on synergism of the garlic extract with plant essential oils or constituents for stable anti-dermatophytic activity. The invention is novel as<br>
the formulation uses the essential oil of the plant Mentha spicata var Ganga. This improved formulation from plant source is highly potent in in vitro and in vivo evaluations. This improved preparation against dermatophytic fungus is novel due to better synergism in activity, better stability and shelf life and reduced smell of garlic which is masked by the other ingredients.

The improved formulation was carefully planned, experimented and evaluated in vitro and in vivo as described and illustrated below. Example 1:<br>
In our experiments we found that all essential oil do not produce synergistic effects with dermatophytes as in case of plant pathogens described in US Patent 6231685. Following tables presents the results of evaluation of antifungal activities of water or solvent extracts of garlic in combinations with the essential oils. As investigation contain solvent extract (propylene glycol) was found to more potent than the water extract and hence in subsequent experiments solvent extract was used for measuring the activities. The combinations of essential oils and garlic extracts were made according to their MICs (minimum inhibitory combinations). The table clearly reveal that the essential oil of Eucalyptus hybrid, E..citriodora, Mentha citrata, M. arversis, Ocimum basilicum (French basil), Ocimum sanctum, Cymbopogon winteriamus, Trachyspermum ammi (Thyme oil ), Cumin cyminun, Anethum soya, Cedar wood oil, sesame oil have produced the antagonostic effects in case of Candida albicans and Trichophyton rubrum when evaluated with garlic extract. But only selected oils viz. Mentha spicata van. Ganga, Cinnamon oil produced the synergistic effect when used together or separately with garlic extract. The activity increased to several folds when these combinations were added to constituent of essential oil like menthyl acetate. The additions of these isolates not only enhanced the activity but also mask the smell of garlic to generate a pleasant smell. The broth assay was carried out following the NCCLS documents published by National Committee for Clinical and Laboratory Standards (USA) and disc diffusion assay according to Bauer et al (Bauer et al, 1996, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, 45:493-496).<br>

 Development and Testing of Formulation<br>
In an effort to prepare a garlic based cream for topical application against superficial fungal infection of keratinised tissue of skin, selection of proper carrier solvent for garlic extraction was made as follows.<br>
Preparation of extract: - 50 gm of raw garlic without removing the inner skin was properly homogenised in mortar &amp; pestle along with 50 ml of<br>
A.	Distilled water<br>
B.	Vegetable oil (linseed oil)<br>
C.	Ethyl alcohol<br>
D.	Propylene glycol<br>
E.	Liquid paraffin<br>
After properly homogenisation the material was filtered after 1 hrs by double layer of muslin cloth and filtrate was used as garlic extract. The supernatant liquid was used as extract. The extracts in oil and liquid paraffin have two layers with emulsion at the junction of the water layer. The emulsion was rejected and the volume of the remaining supernatant was made up of to 50 ml by adding appropriate amount of respective solvent. The solution was utilized for testing of antifungal activity as mother solution. The antifungal activity was tested [Bauer et al,1996, Journal of Clinical Pathology, 45:493-496], which revealed that the garlic extracted in propylene glycol, is the best solvent for antifungal activity.<br>
It was further observed that the activity is lost by keeping the homogenised material more than 24 hrs at room temperature (30-35°). The propylene glycol extract when tested after 15 days of storage at room temperature no activity was recorded. Similarly deterioration of activity was recorded for the extract when stored at 5°C for 15 days. The pH of garlic with water was recorded to be 5.8 while the propylene glycol extract (50g garlic+50 g propylene glycol) was 6.17. The activity of garlic extract in propylene glycol was slightly increased in acidic pH 4.5 by adding citric acid. When the propylene glycol extract was warmed up to 40° to 60° for 30 minute in water bath the activity decreased. <br>
Table 5:    (Table Removed)    <br>
The combination of cinnamon oil with menthyl acetate (isolated from the essential oil of M arvensis)  and  cinnamon oil with the essential oil of M. spicata variety   Ganga were found to be having synergistic   effect   on antifungal activity when used along with garlic extract ( propylene glycol). In all the cases the MIC of both garlic extract and essential oils have been drastically   reduced enhancing the activity   of garlic and also masking the smell.   On the basis of above results   the following combinations were prepared. Preparations Ingredients     Stearyl alcohol -        4 gm<br>
Cetyl alcohol	2 gm<br>

From the experiments of other non published work it was found that if the quantity of white petrolatum is replaced by propylene glycol the efficacy of the cream is further improved. So the final cream was prepared by adding the appropriate amount of propylene glycol and instead of using filtrate the extract was centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was used in the preparation of the cream. This modification provided a better texture and smoothness of the cream and also was easily spreadable on the skin surface.    <br>

Example 8: Mechanism of action<br>
The improved preparation (Cream 10) was also tested against isolated resistant mutants of Candida albicans against Clotrimazole, Amphotericin B and Nystatin. As most of the available antifungal available in the market contain these compounds the cream of invention /improved formulation was compared with them. Clotrimazole inhibits the biosynthesis of ergosterol in Candida albicans. The resistant mutants produce modified enzyme which can not bind to the azole group of compounds. But the compounds which inhibits more to the resistant mutants may be taken as potent inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis, which was observed in the improved preparation. Similarly, Amphotericin B and Nystatin resistant mutants were developed in the laboratory and the activity of the improved preparation was tested against a series of mutants showing different degree of resistance. The mutants resistant against Amphotericin B are also resistant against Nystatin. The polyenes binds to ergosterol and make it non-available for cell membrane biosynthesis there by inhibiting the growth. In mutants the sterol can not binds to the polyenes and hence resistance develops. The improved preparation also showed considerable activity against these mutants indicating the reduced availability of ergosterol for membrane. Hence the preparation (Cream 10) inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol and also makes it unavailable for membrane biosynthesis. The result of the experiments conducted as<br>
"hole diffusion assay" are provided below. All the activities of the preparation are better than the tested market available preparations and inhibit the growth of the fungus by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis and also making the sterol non-available for cell membrane biosynthesis.<br>

Similarly, Amphotericin B and Nystatin resistant mutants were developed in the laboratory and the activity of the improved preparation was tested against a series of mutants showing different degree of resistance. The mutants resistant against Amphotericin B are also resistant against Nystatin. The polyenes binds to ergosterol and make it non-available for cell membrane biosynthesis there by inhibiting the growth. In mutants the sterol can not binds to the polyenes and hence resistance develops. The improved preparation also showed considerable activity against these mutants indicating the reduced availability of ergosterol for membrane. Hence the preparation (Cream 10) inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol and also makes it unavailable for membrane biosynthesis. The result of the experiments conducted as "hole diffusion assay" are provided below. All the activities of the preparation are better than the tested market available preparations and inhibit the growth of the fungus by inhibiting ergosterol biosynthesis and also making the sterol non-available for cell membrane biosynthesis.<br>
