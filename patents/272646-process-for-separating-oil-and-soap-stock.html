 <br>
THE       FOLLOWING       SPECIFICATION DESCRIBES THE INVENTION<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for chemical refining of oils. In particular, it relates to the neutralization step during chemical refining process and results in reduction in water requirement &amp; minimal or zero discharge of effluent from the neutralization step.<br>
Background<br>
Vegetable oils are a valuable source for various precursors used in the food industry. These vegetable oils contain a high amount of triglycerides and are also therefore referred to as triglyceride oils. In addition to triglyceride components, these oils also contain a significant amount of impurities and other non-triglyceride components including phosphatides (gums), free fatty acids, small amounts of metals etc. Generally crude vegetable oils destined for human consumption are neutralized to remove free fatty acids, gums, albuminous and mucilaginous matter, and thereafter washed to reduce the soap content of neutral oil to produce a more stable product. Effective neutralization results in enhanced effectiveness of subsequent steps such as bleaching, hydrogenation, winterizing, deodorizing and furthermore results in high yields of a quality product.<br>
Refining of glyceride oil generally starts with a degumming process whereby gums and its associated components are removed from the oil by centrifugation. After the initial degumming step, the oil still contains a high amount of phosphatides and free fatty acids. Degumming step is followed by neutralization step with an acid/alkali treatment to remove residual phosphatides and neutralize free fatty acids to form a soap stock. The soap stock so formed after neutralization of free fatty acids is removed by centrifugal separation.<br>
During neutralization, soap separation is performed in various stages. Water is used to hydrate soap molecules and separate them from oil in centrifugal separators at different stages. The separation takes place due to the difference between the specific gravity of oil and soap molecule. Generally the water used is soft water at high temperature.<br>
The above prior art method makes use of a substantial quantity of water during the neutralization and soap separation step. After separation, the water collected (wash water)<br>
 <br>
from the separator contains soap molecules and other chemicals used during the refining process and causes considerable difficulties and expense in its disposal.<br>
It is therefore desirable to provide for an improved process for refining oils so as to reduce the over all water consumption and effluent load on the effluent treatment plant.<br>
Brief description of the Drawings<br>
Reference will be made to embodiments of the invention, examples of which may be illustrated in the accompanying figures. These figures are intended to be illustrative, not limiting. Although the invention is generally described in the context of these embodiments, it should be understood that it is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to these particular embodiments.<br>
Fig 1 shows the schematic view of the prior art process.<br>
Fig 2 shows the schematic view of the present invention.<br>
Description of the invention<br>
The present invention is directed to a process for oil refining which substantially reduces the water consumption during neutralization step and minimizes effluent discharge.<br>
According to an embodiment there is provided a process for neutralizing oils during chemical refining comprising subjecting the oil to an acid or an alkali to form a soap stock and removing the soap stock so formed after acid or alkali treatment in two stages. As shown in Fig 2, in first stage of soap separation, the oil and soapstock mixture formed after the acid/alkali treatment, is fed into a plurality of first soap separators <s1 and one soap separator or more than can be used depending on the load of soapstock in oil. embodiment separators are parallel.></s1>
Water from a wash water storage tank (11) is flushed to dilute the soap stock in the first soap separators (S1), (S2) and (S3). The soap molecules get separated from oil molecules in the separator due to the difference in the specific gravity of the two phases. Preferably, hot water is used as high temperature of water helps to separate soap from oil. After separation, water<br>
 <br>
phase containing soap molecules is removed and collected in the soap storage tank (12). Soap concentration in the water phase after first stage of soap separation is observed to be between 10% to 25% whereas soap concentration in oil is observed between 1000 ppm to 3000 ppm, depending on the type oil.<br>
Before the oil is sent for subsequent processing, soap concentration in oil should be below 80 ppm. Hence, the oil is subjected to a second water washing stage in a washing stage separator (S4) to further lower the concentration of soap, in the oil obtained from first stage. Fresh water from Hot water storage tank (10) is mixed with oil and fed in the washing stage separator (S4) to reduce soap concentration below 80 ppm in the oil. Water collected after the washing stage is referred to as wash water. After the washing stage, soap concentration in the wash water is observed to be between 1 to 2 % This wash water is collected and stored in the wash water storage tank (11) for use in the first stage of soap separation.<br>
Pumps (14) and (15) are provided to feed water to the process. (13) is the makeup water vessel needed for to make differential water requirement of wash water stage and soap separation stage.<br>
The above process thus makes use of wash water from the washing stage separator (S4) in the first stage of soap separation thereby reducing the need of fresh water in the first stage. This considerably reduces the water consumption and the effluent discharge during neutralization step. Further, it has also been observed that wash water with 1 % to 2% soap concentration has a high affinity to dissolve more soap from oil. Use of wash water therefore aids positively in removal of soap from oil during first stage of soap separation. The present invention thus provides for a process which reliably achieves very low levels of residual soap concentration as required for further processing, with minimizing the use of fresh water and load on effluent treatment plant.<br>
