Method and Apparatus for determining main parameter values of a storage medium that are required for replaying said storage medium<br>
The invention relates to a method and to an apparatus for determining main parameter values of a storage medium that are required for replaying said storage medium, wherein said storage medium includes a first data area, in which said main parameter values are stored, and a second data area not containing said main parameter values but other data.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
A DVD disc contains a small lead-in area that contains sync sectors, control data including the number of recording surfaces, disc keys and other information, and contains a data area occupying the main part of the available disc surface. In order to handle the content of a DVD Video disc it is necessary to transform a logical sector number denoted LSN into a physical sector number denoted PSN. A DVD disc may contain up to four recording surfaces.<br>
If there is more than one recording surface to be accessed, US-A-5 966 721 discloses how to make the content of the lead-in areas of multiple recording surfaces readable from one surface only.<br>
Invention<br>
A problem to be solved by the invention is to determine important data parameters, which are stored in the lead-in area of the disc and which are required for replaying the disc, from other data read from the non-lead-in area of the disc, without reading the required data parameters from the lead-in area. This problem is solved by the method and apparatus of the present invention as disclosed hereunder.<br><br>
-2-<br>
According to the invention, the content of the disc Data Area is used to detennine the necessary information for a transformation between LSN and PSN numbers without reading information from a lead-in area denoted Lead In.<br>
For determining the important or main parameters, the following Data Area data are used:<br>
characteristic file system data at the beginning of l-ayer 0;<br>
DVD Video specific data located at the beginning of Layer 0;<br>
Sector IDS;<br>
If l_ayer 1 is present, DVD Video specific data located at the inner radius of<br>
Layer 1;<br>
If Opposite Track Path disc is preset, the structure of DVD Video specific data<br>
located at the outer radius of Layers 0 and 1.<br>
Without any view into the Lead In, the proposed procedure determines the location of the Lead In, the Lead out, the Data Area, the Middle Area (if any), and determines the DVD disc type.<br>
The invention allows to automatically determine the following variables that are denoted in this application as main variables.<br>
disc_type (Single Layer, Parallel Track Path, or Opposite Track path);<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_0	(range:      0... FFFFFFh;<br>
End_PSN_Layer_0	(range:      0...   FFFFFFh;<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_l	(range :     lOOOOOOh ...  IFFFFFFh);<br>
End_PSN_Layer_l	(range:    1000000   ... IFFFFFFh).<br>
The last four of these five variables represent a complete replacement for the information from the Data Area allocation filed (BP 4 to 15) described by the DVD Specification for Read-Only Disc, Part 1, Version 1.0, 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information.<br><br>
3<br>
In principle, the inventive method is suited for determining at least one main parameter value of a storage medium that is required for replaying said storage medium, wherein said storage medium includes a first data area, in which said at least one main parameter value is stored, and a second data area not containing said at least one main parameter value but other data, and wherein said at least one main parameter value is determined by reading and evaluating data from said second data area, without reading said at least one main parameter value from said first data area.<br>
In principle the inventive apparatus is suited for determining at least one main parameter value of a data disc that is required for replaying said data disc, wherein said data disc includes a first data area, in which said at least one main parameter value is stored, and a second data area not containing said at least one main parameter value but other<br>
data, and wherein said apparatus includes:<br>
means for driving said data disc;	<br>
a pickup for reading data from said data disc; <br>
a buffer,	<br>
means for controlling said driving means, said pickup and/ said buffer, and for determininq said at least one main pa- / rameter value by reading and evaluating data from said second data area, without reading said at least one main parameter value from said first data area.<br>
Advantageous additional emdodiments of the invention are disclosed in the	<br>
following description.<br><br>

Exemplary embodiments<br>
The above main variables and the way' to calculate	or deter<br>
mine them are now described in more detail, based	on clauses<br>
of the DVD Specification for Read-Only Disc, Part	1, Version<br>
1.0.<br>
For DVD Single Layer discs: disc_type = Single Layer<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_0 = "Start sector number of the Data Area" in the Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, {BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation. End_PSN_Layer_0 = "End sector number of the Data Area" in the Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation. Start_PSN_Layer_l does not exist End_PSN_Layer__l does not exist<br>
For DVD Parallel Track Path discs that have two layers: disc_type = Parallel Track Path<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_0 = "Start sector number of the Data Area" in the Layer 0 Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1<br><br>
5<br>
Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation.<br>
End_PSN_Layer_0 = "End sector number of the Data Area" in the Layer 0 Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation. Start_PSN_Layer_l = 1000000h + "Start sector number of the Data Area" in the Layer 1 Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation.<br>
End_PSN_Layer_l = 1000000h + "End sector number of the Data Area" in the Layer 1 Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation.<br>
For DVD Opposite Track Path discs that have two layers:<br>
disc_type = Opposite Track Path<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_0 = "Start sector number of the Data Area" in the Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation. End_PSN_Layer_0 = "End sector number in Layer 0" in the Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation.<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_l = IFFFFFFh - End_PSN_Layer_0, i.e. the sector number Start_PSN_Layer_l follows immediately the sector number End_PSN_Layer_0.<br>
End_PSN_Layer_l = lOOOOOOh + "End sector number of the Data Area" in the Lead In as described by 3.4.1.3.1 Physical Format Information, (BP 4 to 15) Data Allocation.<br>
The variables PSN and ID are defined as follows:<br>
PSN = "Physical sector nummer", word length 25 bits.<br>
Range for Layer 0: 0 ... OFFFFFFh<br>
Range for Layer 1: 1000000h ... 1FFFFFFh<br>
PSN is identical to the 25 least significant bits of ID.<br>
ID = "Identification Data" as described by 3.2.2 Identi-<br><br>
6<br>
fication Data, i.e. an ID consists of Sector information and a physical sector number PSN.<br>
The two layers of the storage medium may be located at different sides of a disc, or may be located at one side of a multi-layer storage medium that also can be two-sided. It is also possible that the disc has a single layer on one side and two layers on the other side.<br>
In the figures, 'Y' denotes 'yes', 'N' denotes 'no', 'NV_PCK' denotes 'Navigation Pack', 'LSB' denotes 'least significant bit'.<br>
The transformation from logical sector number LSN to physical sector number PSN is described in connection with Fig. 1. 1:  start<br>
2:  LSN 
PSN = LSN + Start_PSN_Layer_0 4:  Area type of ID is Data Area<br>
PSN = LSN + Start_PSN_Layer_l + Start_PSN_Layer_0<br>
- End_PSN_Layer_0 - 1 5:  end<br>
There is no error handling, i.e. LSN must lie within the range provided by the existing Data Area of the disc.<br>
The transformation from a PSN number to an LSN number is described in connection with Fig. 2. 6 :  start 7:  is the most significant bit (the 25th bit) of PSN zero,<br>
i.e. is Layer 0 present ? 8 :  LSN = PSN - Start_PSN_Layer_0 9:  LSN = PSN - Start_PSN_Layer_l - Start_PSN_Layer_O<br>
+ End_PSN_Layer_0 + 1<br>
10: end<br>
There is no error handling, i.e. PSN must point into the existing Data Area of the disc.<br><br>
7<br>
The method of searching for the main variables is described in connection with Fig. 3. The main variables will be found in any case. A disadvantage of this method is that a big-distance jump of the optical head between the inner and the outer radius of the disc is required. Such jumps take some seconds. Advantageously, step 16 allows trying first other steps that work much faster. Only in case the faster steps fail, the slow but anyway working processing will be carried out. But tests have shown that the fast version processing steps will find the correct main variables for nearly all of the existing DVD Video discs. 11: Start<br>
12: disc inserted ? 13: primary volume descriptor pvd = 30010h<br>
Assunption that it is a DVD =&gt; try to read sector PSN = i 14: sector PSN = pvd found ?<br>
15: disc is either damaged or not of DVD-ROM type 16: indicates the ID of sector PSN = pvd a Data Area sector<br>
(Area type of ID = Data Area) ? 17: pvd = 31010h 18: indicates the ID of sector PSN = pvd a Data Area sector<br>
{Area type of ID = Data Area) ? 19: it is not a DVD-Video disc 20: it is a DVD-RAM disc:<br>
disc_type = Single Layer; Start_PSN_Layer__0 = 3lOOOh 21: For DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD-RW and DVD+RW: Start_PSN_Layer_0 = 3O000h;<br>
Assumption that it is a DVD dual layer disc =&gt; use the optical head or pick-up position of the same radius as used for reading sector 30010h of layer 0 to read a sector of layer 1. 22: any sector found ? 23: disc_type = Single Layer<br>
24: disc_type = Dual Layer (temporary status) 25: try fast processing steps 26: are all types of main variables completely known ?<br><br>
8<br>
jump to the outer radius of the disc, take care of the different radiuses: 8cm and 12cm; read successive sectors of layer 0 to locate the border between Data Area and Lead Out or Middle Area;<br>
End_PSN_Layer_0 = PSN of the last Data Area sector is there a Lead Out on Layer 0 at the outer radius of the disc?<br>
is disc_type = Dual Layer ? disc_type = Parallel Track Path Start_PSN_Layer_l = 1030000h;<br>
change to layer 1; read successive sectors of layer 1 to locate the border between Data Area and Lead Out; End_PSN_Layer_l = PSN of the last Data Area sector disc_type = Opposite Track Path;<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_l = IFFFFFFh - End_PSN_Layer_0; jump to the inner radius of the disc on layer 1 at the radius of sector PSN = 30000h; read successive sectors of layer 1 to locate the border between Data Area and Lead Out;<br>
End_PSN_Layer_l = PSN of the last Data Area sector end<br>
Fast processing steps  for searching for  the main  variables<br>
This type of processing is depicted in Fig. 4.<br>
50: Start<br>
51: find disc_type<br>
52: fast search for the main variables<br>
53: end<br>
Step 51 of Fig. 4 is denoted as function "find disc type"<br>
and includes the further steps depicted in Fig. 5.<br>
60: start<br>
61: is disc_type = Single Layer ?<br>
62 : assume a DVD Parallel Track Path disc =&gt; use the pick-up<br><br>
9<br>
position of the same radius as used for reading sector 30010h of layer 0 to read a sector of layer 1. 63: is sector PSN significantly greater than 1030010h ? 64: disc_type = Opposite Track Path 65: disc_type = Parallel Track Path<br>
Start_PSN_Layer_l = 1030000h 66: end<br>
This processing can also be desribed as follows: The parameter disc_type can be determined by reading at least one PSN at the beginning of the first disc layer and at least one PSN at the same or a similar radial location in the other disc layer. If the difference between the corresponding PSN numbers from the two layers is significant, it must be an Opposite Track Path disc. If that difference is small, it is a Parallel Track Path disc.<br>
Alternatively, if at the radial location of the first-layer Lead In there is a corresponding Lead In in the other layer, it must be a Parallel Track Path disc. If at the radial location of the first-layer Lead In there is a corresponding Lead Out in the other layer, it must be an Opposite Track Path disc. It is not necessary to read the content of the Lead In. Knowing the sector ID is sufficient, because the sector ID determines whether it is a Lead In or a Lead out or a Data Area.<br>
As a further alternative, one of the possible dual-layer disc types is assumed to be true and the decoding of the disc-stored useful data (e.g. video data or audio data) is started. If errors or inconsistencies will occur in the decoding, a single-sided disc type is assumed to be true and the decoding is tried again. Whether it is a Parallel Track Path or Opposite Track Path disc can be determined by assuming the presence of one of these types, followed by requesting a jump to a different sector number (i.e. a jump in a specific radial direction) and by checking the proper decoding processing.<br><br>

step 52 of Fig. 4 is denoted as function "fast search for<br>
the main variables" and includes the further steps depicted<br>

Alternative fast processing  steps  for searching critical ones  of   the main  variables:<br>
In case the above described fast processing steps of searching for the critical main variables fail, alternative processing steps can be carried out in order to derive the most important ones of the main variables, in particular End_PSN_Layer_0 for a Parallel Track Path disc, and End_PSN_Layer_0 or Start_PSN_Layer_l for an Opposite Track Path disc.<br>
For getting End_PSN_Layer_0 for Parallel Track Path discs: 400: search inside the file system for file system descriptors UDF, e.g. File Entry Descriptors, just after the middle of the LSN area of the whole disc. These descriptors are probably located in layer 1 just after the Lead In. 401: estimate the PSN of these descriptors and jump to a PSN<br>
just before such an estimated PSN 402: search for these UDF descriptors. The identification can be performed by analysing the first 16 bytes of each sector read. The first 16 bytes of the UDF descriptors contain the Descriptor Tag that provides characteristic information about this descriptor. Therefore an UDF descriptor can be easily recognised. 403: the Tag Location contains a logical sector location of itself. The Tag Location of some descriptors is counted relatively to the start of the partition {File Descriptors, like File Entry Descriptors). Some Tag Locations are identical to LSN {Volume Descriptors, e.g. Anchor Volume Descriptor Pointers).<br>
The Tag Location is used to recalculate End_PSN_Layer_0 404: get the start LSN of the UDF partition from the Parti-<br><br>
15<br>
tion Descriptor 405: Tag Location of a File Descriptor found:<br>
End_PSIS[_Layer_0 = Start_PSN_Layer_0 + Start_PSN_Layer_l + Tag Location + start LSN of the UDF partition<br>
- PSN of the Descriptor - 1 4 06: Tag Location of a Volume Descriptor found:<br>
End_PSIsr_Layer_0 = Start_PSN_Layer_0 + Start_PSN__Layer_l + Tag Location - PSN of the Descriptor - 1<br>
For getting End_PSN_Layer_0 and Start_PSN_Layer_l for Opposite Track Path discs:<br>
450: search inside the file system for file system descriptors UDF, e.g. File Entry Descriptors, just before the end of the LSN area of the whole disc. These descriptors are probably located in layer 1 just after the Lead In.<br>
451: estimate the PSN of these descriptors and jump to a PSN just before such an estimated PSN<br>
452: search for these UDF descriptors. The identification can be performed by analysing the first 16 bytes of each sector read. The first 16 bytes of the UDF descriptors contain the Descriptor Tag that provides????? characteristic information about this descriptor. Therefore an UDF descriptor can be easily recognised.<br>
453: the Tag Location contains a logical sector location of itself. The Tag Location of some descriptors is counted relatively to the start of the partition (File Descriptors, like File Entry Descriptors). Some Tag Locations are identical to LSN (Volume Descriptors, e.g. Anchor Volume Descriptor Pointers).<br>
The Tag Location is used to recalculate End_PSN_Layer_0 and Start_PSN_Layer_l<br>
454: get the start LSN of the UDF partition from the Partition Descriptor<br>
455: Tag Location of a File Descriptor found:<br>
End_PSN_Layer_0 = Start_PSN_Layer_0 + Start_PSN_Layer_l<br><br>
16<br>
+ Tag Location + start LSN of the UDF partition<br>
- PSN of the Descriptor - 1 456: Tag Location of a Volume Descriptor found:<br>
End_PSN_Layer_0 = Start__PSN_Layer_0 + Start_PSN_Layer_l + Tag Location - PSN of the Descriptor - 1 457: Start_PSN_Layer_l = IFFFFFFh - End_PSN_Layer_0<br>
The location of special DVD-Video files may also be used in an analog way, e.g. files VTS_xx_0.IFO, wherein xx runs from 1 to 99. These files are recognisable using a method described in EP-A-1014372 of the same applicant. A comparison of the PSN of the detected VTS_xx_0.IFO file with its location indicated by the file system leads to the calculation of End_PSN__Layer_0.<br>
Fig. 11 shows an optical disk D, which is driven by a motor M and from which data are read by means of a pick-up P. These data are fed to a track buffer TB. The data read are stored in TB in order to compensate for different instantaneous or short-term data rates. The corresponding partial data streams of the buffer-stored data stream are fed from TB into an associated decoder bit buffer. In this case, a video, audio, subpicture, and/or data decoder DAT may be involved, for example. The video decoder VXD may be an MPEG video decoder. The audio: decoder AUD may be an MPEG or AC3 audio decoder. Instead of a data decoder, it is also possible to use an output interface.<br>
M, P, TB, VID, AUD and DAT are controlled by controlling means CTRL. This controlling means CTRL steers the radial position of pick-up P and the speed of motor M, evaluates the required data read for determining, by carrying out the functional processing steps described, the above mentioned main variables.<br>
