				<td>The present invention relates to an apparatus and method for operating a wireless communication network.<br>
Description of the Prior Art:<br>
In a conventional wireless network, a Mobile Station (MS) may be used by an end user to access network services. The MS includes interface equipment used to terminate a wireless signal at the end-user side of a communication link. Examples of an MS include a cellular telephone, a wireless laptop, etc.<br>
The MS communicates with a Base Station System (BS). The BS performs radio-related functions. The BS includes Base Transceiver Stations (BTSs) and a Base Station Controller (BSC). The BTS provides an interface to the MS. In one embodiment, the BTS includes radio equipment, such as. the transceivers and antennas, needed to service each cell in" a wireless network. Several BTSs are typically controlled by a BSC. The BSC provides control functions and physical links between a Message Switching Center (MSC) and the BTS. The MSC provides an interface to network functionality, such as an internal network, virtual private, networks, public service telephone networks, etc.<br>
During operation, configuration information is communicated between the MS and BS to facilitate communications.   The configuration information is synchronized between the MS and the BS for proper operation of the system. One specific type of synchronization information is Sync_ID information (i.e., Sync_ID) as defined by TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002. The Sync_ID information is communicated between the MS and the BS in standardized messages to ensure that configuration information is current and updated between the MS and the BS.<br>
With the tremendous increase in wireless technology, bandwidth is at a premium in most wireless systems. Therefore, a number of techniques have been developed to increase bandwidth. However, many of these techniques focus on developing hardware and software that increases speed and processing power. However, the development cost and additional complexity associated with developing hardware and software is often prohibitive.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a method and apparatus for increasing performance and functionality of wireless networks within the context of the current signaling and message structure .of standardized protocols. There is a need for a method and apparatus that utilizes the Sync_ID information to increase performance and functionality of wireless networks within the framework of various wireless standard.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for increasing performance and functionality of wireless networks .that utilize standardized . messages. In one embodiment, additional network functions are implemented in a wireless network by utilizing synchronization information, such as the Sync_ID information (i.e., Sync_ID) defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002.<br>
In one embodiment, additional meaning is associated with synchronization<br>
information, such as Sync_IDs, by mapping and/or correlating the synchronization information to additional information. Standardized messages are then used to communicate the synchronization information between the MS and the BS. For example, additional meaning is attributed to the synchronization information. As<br>
such, the synchronization information may be used to facilitate the synchronization of the MS and the BS and the same synchronization information may also be used to communicate additional information between the MS and the BS to provide additional functionality in the wireless system.<br>
Additional network functions may be implemented using synchronization information. In one embodiment, the synchronization information may be used to define and/or communicate information about network services and/or network components. As a result, in addition to performing the primary function of synchronizing configuration information between the MS and the network, the synchronization information may also be used to communicate additional information, such as information about network services and/or network components. The additional information is then interpreted and used to implement additional network functions. As a result, the synchronization information is used to add functionality to the wireless system.<br>
In one embodiment, the synchronization information is mapped to network services. For example, specific synchronization information may be used to represent a web browsing service. As such, when the synchronization information is communicated between the MS and the BS, information about the web browsing service is communicated between the MS and the BS.<br>
In another embodiment, the synchronization information may be mapped to network components. As such, when the synchronization information is communicated between the MS and the BS, information about the network components is communicated between the MS and the BS. For example, information on whether a component exists in the network may be communicated using the synchronization information; information identifying a specific gateway that should be used to provide a better.quality of service may be communicated using the synchronization information, etc.<br>
Using the synchronization information to communicate information about network services and/or network components enables the implementation of additional network functions. As such, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the synchronization information is used to provide additional<br>
functionality in the wireless network. It should be appreciated that although specific network functions are defined and described, a variety of additional network functions may be defined and described using the synchronization information.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a method of operating comprises the steps of receiving synchronization information using network messaging, the synchronization information capable of use for synchronization; and then implementing a network function other than synchronization by interpreting the synchronization information.<br>
A method for managing a synchronization identifier, comprises embedding a first synchronization identifier in a release order; transmitting the release order; and causing update of a second synchronization identifier using the first synchronization identifier received in the release order.<br>
A method for managing a synchronization identifier, comprises formatting a status request at a base station for checking a mobile station synchronization identifier; transmitting the status request to a mobile station, the status request causing the mobile station to transmit a status response that includes the mobile station synchronization identifier; receiving the status response; and if the mobile station synchronization identifier does not match the base station synchronization identifier, transmitting an update request to the mobile station that includes the base station synchronization identifier.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings provided herein will recognize additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional fields in which the present invention would be of significant utility.<br>
It should be appreciated that although the present invention will be described with respect to TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread<br>
Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002, it is fully anticipated that this standard will evolve and that the evolved standards are within the scope of the present invention. Further, is should also be appreciated that the underlying teachings of the present invention are applicable to various other standards associated with the evolved standards.<br>
A variety of terms defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 will be used in the present invention. BS is used to represent a base station^ MS is used to represent a mobile station. Various types of configuration information are defined. For example, NNSCR is a non-negotiable service configuration information record. The NNSCR contains non-negotiable service configuration parameters of a call. The ERM is an Extended Release Message. One type of synchronization information is the Service Configuration Information Record or SCR. The SCR contains the service configuration parameters of a call. Synchronization information includes the Sync_ID, which is a Service Configuration Synchronization Identifier. The Sync_ID is a variable length identifier corresponding to the SCR and NNSCR that may be stored by the base station and/or the mobile station. In one embodiment, the Sync_ID value is used by the base station to determine whether SCR and NNSCR may be omitted during the call set up.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, synchronization information is communicated using standardized network messaging. The synchronization information is then used (1) for the purpose of synchronizing components in the network and (2) for adding additional network functions (i.e., additional network functionality) to the network. In one embodiment of the present invention, the standardized network messaging includes standardized messages defined by communications protocols. For example, protocols defined by the 3rd generation partnership project (i.e., 3GPP2), such as the 3G wireless protocol, protocols defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (i.e., IETF), such as various internet protocols, etc. It should be appreciated that although two specific standards groups and family of protocols are discussed, the present invention<br>
applies to a variety of standards-based groups and communications protocols and messaging defined by the standards-based groups.<br>
In one embodiment, the standardized messaging defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 is used to implement the present invention. For example, in one embodiment, Release Order Messages as defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 are used to communicate the synchronization information. In another embodiment, a Universal Handoff Messaging as defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 is used to communicate the synchronization information.<br>
The synchronization information is then used to add additional functions (i.e., functionality) to the network. In one embodiment, additional functionality includes a scenario in which the synchronization information is used to implement another function in addition to synchronization. For example, the synchronization information may be used to implement an additional service in the wireless network, such as video services, wireless services, Internet services, etc. Further, the synchronization information may be used to identify a component or network in the wireless network, such as a gateway, router, bridge, etc. For example, identifying various devices for communication may enable the network to implement functions, such as quality of service or load balancing, by routing traffic through various components in the wireless network.<br>
In one embodiment, the additional function is implemented by mapping or correlating the synchronization information with values, numbers, symbols, etc. that have a predefined meaning and/or values, numbers, symbols that may be used to implement a predefined function. For example, in one embodiment, databases may be deployed in an MS and placed in association (i.e., in communication) with a BS. When synchronization information is communicated between the MS and the BS the synchronization information may be used to synchronize the two devices.<br>
In addition, the synchronization information may be used as an index to map or correlate a value, number, symbol, etc. found in one or both of the databases.<br>
The value may be used to represent a service and/or component in the network. For example, the value may represent a video service or a router in the network. In the case where the value represents a video service, communicating the synchronization information between the MS and the BS provides information about the video service and, as such, facilitates the implementation of the video service in the network. In this scenario, the synchronization information is used to implement an additional network function or to add additional functionality in the network. In this example, the additional network function or functionality is the video service.<br>
In the case where the value represents a device, such as a router in the network, communicating the synchronization information between the MS and the BS provides information that identifies the router and, as such, facilitates the use of the router in the network. As such, the synchronization information has been used to implement an additional function in the network or to add additional functionality in the network. The additional function or functionality is the identification of a specific device, such as the router that should be used for communication. As a result, functionality, such as load balancing and quality of service, may be realized by identifying which device to use to communicate traffic at a specific time.<br>
Fig. 1 displays a network implementing the teachings of the present invention. A mobile station (MS) 100 is in communication with a base station (BS) 104. The MS 100 and the BS 104 synchronize information, such as a SyncJD. The BS 104 may communicate with a network 108.<br>
In one embodiment, the MS 100 includes or is in communication with a database (ms) 102. The database (ms) 102 may store synchronize information. For example, several SyncJDs may be simultaneously stored in the database (ms) 102. The BS 104 also communicates with a database (bs) 106. The database (bs) 106 may also store various types of synchronization information, such as one or several SyncJDs. It should be appreciated that although the database (bs) 106 is shown communicating with the BS 104, the database (bs) 106 may communicate across a network, such as network 108 with the BS 104.<br>
In one embodiment, each database, database (ms) 102 and the database (bs) 106 may be used to implement additional network functions in the wireless network<br>
by mapping or correlating the synchronize information to a number, value, symbol, code, etc. that represents a component and/or service in the wireless network. For example, the database (ms) 102 and the database (bs) 106 may each be implemented as a relational database and perform a mapping or correlation between the synchronize information and a value representing a wireless service, such as an Internet service, wireless video, wireless audio, etc. As such, in addition to synchronizing configuration information between the MS 100 and thejietwork 108 (i.e., BS 104), the synchronize information may be used to provide additional functionality to the wireless network by communicating information about network services.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the synchronization information may be used to implement a number, symbol, etc. that performs a mapping and/or correlation between the synchronization information and a component in the network, such as the MSC, a specific router, a specific end device. As such, the synchronization information may be used to implement, initiate, or communicate information about a specific device in the network. The device may then be used to distribute traffic. For example, load balancing .may be achieved using the synchronization information. As such, in addition to synchronizing configuration information between the MS 100 and the network 108 (i.e., base station 104), the synchronization information is used to provide additional functionality in the wireless network by communicating information about network components.<br>
During operation, synchronization information is communicated between the MS 100 and the BS 104. In one embodiment, the synchronization information may be used to represent configuration information, such as SCR and NNSCR. However, various types of configuration information may be represented and still remain within the scope of the present invention.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, standardized messages as defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, .May 20'02 and associated specifications may be used to communicate the synchronization information between MS 100 and BS 104. For example, in one embodiment, Release Order Messages as defined in<br>
TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 and associated specifications may be used to communicate the synchronization information between MS 100 and BS 104. For example, the release messages, such as the Release Order Message, the Extended Release Message and/or the Extended Release Mini-Message, etc., may be implemented.<br>
In another embodiment, Handoff Messages as defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 and associated specifications may be used to communicate the synchronization information between MS 100 and BS 104. In one embodiment, Handoff Messages as defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 and associated specifications, such as a Universal Handoff Direction Message, may be implemented.<br>
Once the synchronization information is communicated between the MS 100 and the BS 104, the configurations between the MS 100 and the BS 104 may be synchronized. In addition, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the synchronization information may be used to provide additional functionality to the wireless network depicted in Fig. 1. For example, in one embodiment, the synchronization information may be used as an index to search database (ms) 102 and/or database (bs) 106. The synchronization information may map or correlate with a value, symbol, number, etc. representing a service, component, etc. in a network. As such, by communicating.the synchronization information and then storing, searching, mapping, correlating, and/or using the synchronization information in association with the database (ms) 102 and the database (bs) 106, additional network information about network components and/or services are communicated with the synchronization information. Additional network information may include information used to-implement additional functions in the network, such as information used to implement additional network services, information used to identify specific components or networks, information used to launch automated routines in the MS 100 or BS 104, information used to automatically configure network 108, etc.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the synchronization information is used to implement fast call setup related features. For example, the BS 104 assigns synchronization information representing the configurations (i.e., Sync_ID which represents SCR and NNSCR) that are associated with service option(s) associated with the MS 100 (i.e., based on end user subscription policy, criteria, etc.). When either side (i.e., BS 104 and/or MS 100) connects a call using these service options, the BS 104 or the MS 100 can use the synchronization information to identify the stored configurations for the call. For example, in one embodiment, packet data service (i.e., web browsing) can use the synchronization information when the service is connected and disconnected between an idle state and a traffic state.<br>
In addition to the configuration information, such as the SCR and the NNSCR that the synchronization information is used to represent, in accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the synchronization information itself can carry additional useful information and, as such, provide additional functionality in the wireless system. For example, various types of Internet protocol information, such as the MS's Internet protocol version 4 (i.e., IPv4) address and/or the Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Key information for the packet data service option of the MS, may be communicated using the synchronization information. As such, the BS 104 may use the synchronization information itself during the service option reconnection to speed up the connection or for other purposes.<br>
In one embodiment, synchronization information includes a base station synchronization identifier (BSSI) and a mobile station synchronization identifier (MSSI). In one embodiment, the BSSI may be used to communicate the current configuration status of the BS 104. The MSSI is synchronization information that is used to convey the current synchronization status of the MS 100.<br>
During operation, the BS 104 may communicate the BSSI to the MS 100 and the MS 100 may communicate the MSSI to the BS 104. For example, using Fig. 1 BS 104 may communicate the BSSI to the MS 100.' The MS 100 may then optionally store the MSSI in the database (ms) 102. In addition, the MS 100 may communicate<br>
the MSSI to the BS 104.   The BS 104 may then optionally store the BSSI in the database (bs) 106.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the BS 104 may<br>
embed the BSSI in a standardized communication message. For example, in one<br>
embodiment, the BS 104 may embed the BSSI in a Release Order Message, such<br>
as the Release Order Messages as defined in TIA/EIA IS-2000.5-C, Signaling<br>
Standards for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum Systems - Release C, May 2002 and<br>
associated specifications. In one embodiment, the Release Messages include the<br>
Release Order Message, the Extended Release Message, and/or the Extended<br>
Release Mini-Message.	:<br>
The BS 104 may then transmit the Release Message to the MS 100. The MS 100 receives the Release Message communicated by the BS 104 and is then able to update the MSSI using the BSSI embedded in the Release Message. In another embodiment, the MS 100 may then transmit the Release Message to the BS 104. The BS 104 receives the Release Message communicated by the MS 100. The BS 104 may embed a BSSI in a Release Message. The BS 104 may then transmit the Release Message to the MS 100. The MS 100 receives the Release Message communicated by the BS 104 and is then able to update the MSSI using the BSSI embedded in the Release Message.<br>
It should be appreciated that the foregoing method may be implemented while the MS 100 and the BS 104 are operating on. the traffic channel or in the idle state. In addition, the BSSI may be used to communicate additional information used to implement network functions. For example, in one embodiment, the BSSI is used to communicate additional service information, such as mobile IP information or GRE tunnel information. In another embodiment, the BSSI may be used to communicate , additional network component information, such as a specific device to use during the communication session. Lastly, it should be appreciated that the Release Message may include multiple instances of synchronization information, such as multiple BSSls or multiple MSSls.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, during operation a status request is formulated at the BS 104:   The status request is formulated to check the<br>
current MSSI in the MS 100. The status request is transmitted from the BS 104 to the MS 100. After receiving the status request at the MS 100, a status response is formulated by the MS 100. The status response includes the MSSI associated with the MS 100. The status response is transmitted to the BS 104. The BS 104 then checks to determine if the MSSI transmitted by the MS 100 matches the current MSSI stored in association with the BS 104. If the MSSI does not match the current BSSI, then an update request including the current MSSI is transmitted from the BS 104 to the MS 100.<br>
Fig. 2 displays a computer architecture implementing the teachings of the present invention. The computer 200 of Fig. 2. may implement the mobile station (MS) 100, the database (ms) 102, the base station (BS) 104, the database (bs) 106, and the network 108 of Fig. 1. A central processing unit (CPU) 202 functions as the brain of the computer 200. Internal memory 204 is shown. The internal memory 204 includes short-term memory 206 and long-term memory 208. The short-term memory 206 may be a Random Access Memory (RAM) or a memory cache used for staging information. The long-term memory 208 may be a Read Only Memory (ROM) or an alternative form of memory used for storing information. Storage memory 220 may be any memory residing within the computer 200 other than internal memory 204. In one embodiment of the present invention, storage memory 220 is implemented with a hard drive. A communication pathway 210 is used to communicate information within computer 200, In addition, the communication pathway 210 may be connected to interfaces, which communicate information out of the computer 200 or receive information into the computer 200.<br>
Input devices, such as tactile input device, joystick, keyboards, microphone, communications connections, or a mouse, are shown as 212. The input devices 212 interface with computer 200 through an input interface 214. Output devices, such as a monitor, speakers, communications connections, etc., are shown as 216. The output devices 216 communicate with computer 200 through an output interface 218. Fig. 3 depicts a data diagram displaying a mapping between the synchronization information and different network functions. The synchronization information 300 is mapped to various network functions 302 (i.e., functionality). For<br>
example, the synchronization information is mapped to network components 304. In<br>
one embodiment, the network components 304 may include an MSC, routers, base<br>
stations, MS, etc. When the synchronization is mapped to a network component as<br>
shown at 304, information about a specific network component may be<br>
communicated between the BS and the MS during synchronization using the<br>
synchronization information. As such, routing, load balancing, etc. may be<br>
implemented using the synchronization information.	<br>
In a second embodiment, network services 306 may be communicated, initiated,- and implemented using the synchronization information. For example, network services, such as Internet services, web services, maintenance services, audio services, video services, etc., may be implemented using the synchronization information 300. As such, using the synchronization information provides another option for communicating information about services between the MS and the network.<br>
Fig. 4A displays a data diagram displaying the mapping between a packet including synchronization information and specific network functions. In Fig. 4A, a data packet including a field comprising synchronization information 400 is mapped to a network function(s) 402. In one embodiment, the field comprising synchronization information 400 is mapped to a specific network function, such as a network service, a network component, etc. For example, a one-to-one mapping is performed between the synchronization-information 400 and specific network function.<br>
Fig. 4B displays a data diagram displaying the mapping between a packet including a field including synchronization information and various network functions. In a second embodiment, a field comprising synchronization information 404 is mapped to several network functions as shown by 406 to 408. For example, one field comprising synchronization information 404 may be mapped to a network function(s) 406 to 408 where the network function(s) 406 to 408 may represent several network services or several network components. For example, in one embodiment, the field comprising synchronization information 404 may be segmented into several fields comprising synchronization information as shown by<br>
404A or 404B. Each field comprising synchronization information, such as 404A and 404B may be linked to a specific network service.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, synchronization information 404 may be used to implement a variety of different network functions. For example, a single instance of synchronization information may be used to represent multiple components or multiple services. In addition, any permutation or combination of the foregoing is within the scope-pf the present invention.<br>
Fig. 5 displays a message flow diagram in which a BS updates synchronization information using Release Order messaging. The traffic channel is already established and the .mobile station has moved from a first cell to a second cell.<br>
At 503 a traffic channel is established and synchronization information is communicated. An MS 500 and a BS 502 communicate synchronization information over traffic as shown by 504. The BS may then communicate a Release Order to the MS. The Release Order includes Sync_IDs as shown at 506. It should be appreciated that either the MS or the BS may initiate the Release Order. In one embodiment, if the MS initiates the Release Order, the BS may respond with Release Order including the synchronization information as shown at 506. In another embodiment, the base station initiates the Release Order including the synchronization information as shown at 506. The MS may then communicate a Release Order to the BS as shown at 508.<br>
In another embodiment, upon release of a call, the BS 502 sends a Release Order, Extended Release Message, or Extended Release Mini-Message to update the current synchronization information in the MS 500. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, in addition to communicating configuration related information on the SCR and NNSCR of the call, the synchronization information may convey additional information, such as mobile IP information and/or Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) Key information for a GRE tunnel.<br>
Fig. 6 displays a message flow diagram in which a BS updates synchronization information with a Release Order on a Common Channel. In one embodiment, the message flow diagram depicted in Fig. 6 occurs in an idle state.<br>
An MS 600 communicates an origination message including synchronization information (i.e., Sync_IDs) 604 to a BS 602. The BS 602 then communicates a Release Order including synchronization information 606 to the MS 600. In another embodiment, the BS 602 may also use the Release Order while in a Mobile Station Idle State to update the synchronization information stored in the MS 600. This is especially useful when the MS 600 updates its packet data zone information while in Idle.<br>
Fig. 7A displays a message flow diagram in which the MS performs a query. An MS 700 generates a Status Request Message including synchronization information 704 and communicates the Status Request Messaging including synchronization information 704 to the BS 702. The BS 702 then generates a Status Response Message including synchronization information 706 to the MS 700.<br>
Since the BS 702 can store multiple instances of synchronization information, there is a chance that the synchronization information stored in the MS 700 and BS 702 may not be synchronized. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, we propose to allow a MS 700 to query (i.e., in CDMA, use Status Request Message, or other messages that have the query capability) the synchronization information stored in the BS 702 either in BS 702 Idle State or in traffic mode (i.e., mobile station can use Status Response Message or other messages that have the ability to report the stored Sync_ID).<br>
Fig. 7B displays a message flow diagram in which the BS performs a query. A BS 702 generates a Status Request Message including synchronization information 708 and communicates the Status Request Messaging including synchronization information 708 to the MS 700. The MS 700 then generates a Status Response Message including synchronization information 710 to the BS 702. Since the MS 700 can store multiple instances of synchronization information, there is a chance that the synchronization information stored in the MS 700 and BS 702 may not be synchronized. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, we propose to allow an BS 700 to query (i.e., in CDMA, use Status Request Message, or other messages that have the query capability) the synchronization information stored in the MS 702 either in MS 702 Idle State or in<br>
traffic mode (i.e., mobile station can use Status Response Message or other messages that have the ability to report the stored Sync_ID).<br>
The synchronization information is used to communicate additional information between the MS 700 and the BS 702, such as information identifying services or components in the wireless network. In addition, the synchronization information is communicated between the MS 700 and the BS 702 using a variety of different mechanisms. For example, the synchronization information is communicated using Release Order Messages or Handoff Messages.<br>
