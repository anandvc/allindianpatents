				<td>The  present  invention  relates  to  2-  phenyl-substituted  imidazotriazinones compound and process thereof.<br>
The present invention relates to 2-phenyl-substituted imidazotriazinones, to processes for their preparation and to their use as pharmaceuticals, in particular as inhibitors of cGMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases;<br>
The published specification DE 28 11 780 describes imidazotriazines as bronchodilators having spasmolytic activity and inhibitory activity against phosphodiesterases which metabolize cyclic adenosin monophosphate (cAMP-PDEs, nomenclature according to Beavo: PDE-UI and PDE-IV). An inhibitory action against phosphodiesterases which metabolize cyclic guanosin monophosphate (cGMP-PDEs, nomenclature according to Beavo and Reifsnyder (Trends in Pharmacol. Sci. 11, 150-155, 1990) PDE-I, PDE-II and PDE-V) has not been described. Compounds having a sulphonamide group in the aryl radical in the 2-position are not claimed. Furthermore, FR 22 13 058, CH 59 46 71, DE 22 55 172, DE 23 64 076 and EP 000 9384 describe imidazotriazinones which do not have a substituted aryl radical in the 2-position and are likewise said to be bronchodilators having cAMP-PDE inhibitory action.<br>

The process according to the invention can be illustrated using the following scheme as an example: <br>
Solvents which are suitable for the individual steps are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or<br>
halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethane, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is also possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned solvents. Particular preference is given to ethanol for the first step and dichloroethane for the second step.<br>

Suitable solvents for the individual steps of the process are the customary organic solvents which do not change under the reaction conditions. These preferably include ethers, such as diethyl ether, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, glycol dimethyl ether, or hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, hexane, cyclohexane or mineral oil fractions, or halogenated hydrocarbons, such as dichloromethane, trichloromethane, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethylene, trichloroethylene or chlorobenzene, or ethyl acetate, dimethylformamide, hexamethylphosphoric triamide, acetonitrile, acetone, dimethoxyethane or pyridine. It is also possible to use mixtures of the abovementioned solvents. Particular preference is given to dichloromethane for the first step and to a mixture of tetrahydrofuran and pyridine for the second step.<br>
Suitable bases are generally alkali metal hydrides or alkali metal alkoxides, such as, for example, sodium hydride or potassium tert-butoxide, or cyclic amines, such as, for example, piperidine, pyridine, dimethylaminopyridine or CrC4 alkylamines, such as, for example, triethylamine. Preference is given to triethylamine, pyridine and/or dimethylaminopyridine.<br>
The base is generally employed in an amount of from 1 mol to 4 mol, preferably from 1.2 mol to 3 mol, in each case based on 1 mol of the compound of the formula (X).<br>
The reaction temperature can generally be varied within a relatively wide range. In general, the reaction is carried out in a range of from -20°C to 200°C, preferably of fromO°Cto 100°C.<br><br>
The compounds of the general formulae (VII), (VHT), (EX) and (X) are known per se, or they can be prepared by customary methods.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (IH) can be prepared by reacting compounds of the general formula (XI)<br>
in which<br>
R5 and R6 are each as defined above<br>
with ammonium chloride in toluene and in the presence of trimethylaluminium in hexane in a temperature range of from -20°C to room temperature, preferably at 0°C and atmospheric pressure, and reacting the resulting amidine, if appropriate in situ, with hydrazine hydrate.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (XI) are known per se, or they can be prepared by customary methods.<br>
Some of the compounds of the general formula (IV) are known, or they are novel, in which case they can be prepared by known methods [cf. David R. Marshall, Chemistry and Industry, 2 May 1983, 331-335].<br>
Compounds of the general formula (V) are novel per se, however, they can be prepared from the compounds of the general formula (IV) in accordance with the publication Organikum, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1974, pages 338 - 339.<br>
The compounds of the general formula (I) according to the invention have an unforeseeable useful pharmacological activity spectrum.<br>
They inhibit either one or more of the cGMP-metabolizing phosphodiesterases (PDE I, PDE n and PDE V). This results in an increase of cGMP. The differentiated expression of the phosphodiesterases in different cells, tissues and organs, as well as the differentiated subcellular localization of these enzymes, in combination with the selective inhibitors according to the invention make it possible to selectively address the various cGMP-regulated processes.<br>
Moreover, the compounds according to the invention enhance the activity of substances such as, for example EDRF (endothelium derived relaxing factor), ANP (atrial natriuretic peptide), of nitrovasodilators and all other substances which increase the cGMP concentration in a manner different from that of phosphodiesterase inhibitors.<br>
They can therefore be employed in pharmaceuticals for treating cardiovascular disorders, such as, for example, for treating hypertension, neuronal hypertonia, stable and unstable angina, peripheral and cardial vascularpathies, arrhythmiae, for treating thromboembolic disorders and ischaemias such as myocardial infarction, stroke, transistory and ischaemic attacks, angina pectoris, obstruction of peripheral circulation, prevention of restenoses after thrombolysis therapy, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasties (PTCA) and bypass. Furthermore, they may also be of significance for cerebrovascular disorders. Owing to their relaxing action on smooth muscles, they are suitable for treating disorders of the urogenital system such as hypertrophy of the prostate, incontinence and in particular for treating erectile dysfunction and female sexual dysfunction.<br>
Activity of the phosphodiesterases (PDEs)<br>
The cGMP-stimulated PDE 0, the cGMP-inhibited PDE HI and the cAMP-specific PDEIV were isolated either from porcine or bovine heart myocardium. The Ca2+-calmodulin-stimulated PDE I was isolated from porcine aorta, porcine brain or, preferably, from bovine aorta. The cGMP-specific PDE V was obtained from porcine small intestine, porcine aorta, human platelets and, preferably, from bovine aorta. Purification was carried out by anion exchange chromatography over MonoQ® Pharmacia, essentially following the method of M. Hoey and Miles D. Houslay, Biochemical Pharmacology, Vol. 40, 193-202 (1990) and C. Lugman et al., Biochemical Pharmacology, Vol. 35, 1743-1751 (1986).<br>
The enzyme activity is determined using a test mixture of 100 ml in 20 mM tris/HCl-buffer pH 7.5 containing 5 mM MgCli, 0.1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin and either 800 Bq[ 3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP. The final concentration of the nucleotides in question is 10"6 mol/1. The reaction is initiated by addition of the enzyme and the amount of enzyme is such that during the incubation time of 30 min, approximately 50% of the substrate are converted. To test the cGMP-stimulated PDE n, [3H]cAMP is used as substrate and 10"6 mol/1 of non-labelled cGMP are added to the mixture. To test the Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent PDE I, 1 mM of CaCb and 0.1 mM of calmodulin are added to the reaction mixture. The reaction is quenched by addition of 100ml of acetonitrile containing 1 mM cAMP and 1 mM AMP. 100 ml of the reaction mixture are separated by HPLC, and the cleavage products are determined quantitatively on-line using a continuous scintillation counter. The substance concentration measured is the concentration at which the reaction rate is reduced by 50%. Additionally, the "phosphodiesterase [3H] cAMP-SPA enzyme assay" and the "phosphodiesterase [3H] cGMP-SPA enzyme assay" from Amersham Life Science were used for testing. The test was carried out according to the test protocol of the manufacturer. To determine the activity of PDE H, the [3H]cAMP SPA assay was used, and 10"6 M cGMP were added to the reaction mixture to activate the enzyme. To measure PDE I, 10"7 M calmodulin<br>
and 1 mM CaCl2 were added to the reaction mixture. PDE V was measured using the [3H]cGMP SPA assay.<br>
Inhibition of the phosphodiesterases in vitro<br><br>
In principle, inhibition of one or more phosphodiesterases of this type results in an increase of the cGMP concentration. Thus, the compounds are of interest for all therapies in which an increase of the cGMP concentration is considered to be beneficial.<br>
The cardiovascular effects were investigated using SH-rats and dogs. The substances were administered intravenously or orally.<br>
The erection-stimulating action was investigated using rabbits which were awake [NaganumaH, EgashiraT, FujiJ, Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology 20, 177-183 (1993)]. The substances were administered intravenously, orally or parenterally.<br>
The novel active compounds and their physiologically acceptable salts (for example hydrochlorides, maleates or lactates) can be converted in a known manner into the customary formulations, such as tablets, coated tablets, pills, granules, aerosols, syrups, emulsions, suspensions and solutions, using inert non-toxic, pharmaceutically suitable excipients or solvents. In this case the therapeutically active compound should in each case be present in a concentration from approximately 0.5 to 90% by weight of the total mixture, i.e. in amounts which are sufficient in order to achieve the dosage range indicated.<br>
The formulations are prepared, for example, by extending the active compounds using solvents and/or excipients, if appropriate using emulsifiers and/or dispersants, it optionally being possible, for example, to use organic solvents as auxiliary solvents if the diluent used is water.<br>
Administration is carried out in a customary manner, preferably orally, transdermally or parenterally, for example perlingually, buccally, intravenously, nasally, rectally or inhalatively.<br>
For human use, in the case of oral administration, it is good practice to administer doses of from 0.001 to 50 mg/kg, preferably of 0.01 mg/kg - 20 mg/kg. In the case of parenteral administration, such as, for example, via mucous membranes nasally, buccally or inhalatively, it is good practice to use doses of 0.001 mg/kg - 0.5 mg/kg.<br>
In spite of this, if appropriate it may be necessary to depart from the amounts mentioned, namely depending on the body weight or the type of administration route, on the individual response towards the medicament, the manner of its formulation and the time or interval at which administration takes place. Thus, in some cases it may be adequate to manage with less than the abovementioned minimum amounts, while in other cases the upper limit mentioned has to be exceeded. In the case of the administration of relatively large amounts, it may be advisable to divide these into several individual doses over the course of the day.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are also suitable for use in veterinary medicine. For use in veterinary medicine, the compounds or their non-toxic salts can be administered in a suitable formulation in accordance with general veterinary practice. Depending on the kind of animal to be treated, the veterinary surgeon can determine the nature of use and the dosage.<br>

The sulphonamides listed in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6 below were prepared by means of automated parallelsynthesis from 4-ethoxy-3-(5-methyl-4-oxo-7-propyl-3,4-dihydro-imidazo[5,l-f][l,2,4]triazin-2-yl)-benzenesulphonyl chloride and the appropriate amine using one of the three standard procedures below.<br>
The sulphonamides listed in Table 5 were prepared by the same methods by means of automated parallelsynthesis from 4-ethoxy-3-(5-ethyl-4-oxo-7-propyl-3,4-dihydro-<br>
imidazo[5,l-8][l,2,4]triazin-2-yl)-benzenesulphonyl chloride and the appropriate amine.<br>
The purity of the final products was determined by means of HPLC, and they were characterized by LC-MS. The content of the desired compound according to HPLC-MS is given in per cent in the tables in the column "HPLC". Standard procedure A was used with amines having acidic functionalities, standard procedure B was used with amines having neutral functionalities, standard procedure C was used with amines having additional basic functionalities.<br>
In the structural formulae of Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 below, hydrogen atoms are in some cases not shown. Nitrogen atoms having a free valency are therefore to be understood as -NH- radical.<br>
Standard procedure A: Reaction of amines having acidic functionalities 0.05 mmol of amine, 0.042 mmol of sulphonyl chloride and 0.10 mmol of NaiCOa are initially charged, and 0.5 ml of a mixture of THF/HoO is pipetted in by hand. After 24 h at RT, the mixture is admixed with 0.5 ml of 1M HUSC^ solution and filtered through a two-phase cartridge (500 mg of Extrelut (upper phase) and 500 mg of SiOi, mobile phase ethyl acetate). The product is obtained after concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure.<br>
Standard procedure B: Reaction of amines having neutral functionalities 0.125 mmol of amine are initially charged and 0.03 mmol of sulphonyl chloride as a solution in 1,2-dichloroethane is pipetted in by the synthesizer. After 24 h, the mixture is admixed with 0.5 ml of 1M H2SO4 and filtered through a two-phase cartridge (500 mg of Extrelut (upper phase) and 500 mg of SiOi, mobile phase: ethyl acetate). The filtrate is concentrated under reduced pressure.<br>
Standard procedure C: Reaction of amines having basic functionalities 0.05 mmol of amine are initially charged and 0.038 mmol of sulphonyl chloride as a solution in 1,2-dichloroethane and 0.05 mmol of triethylamine as a solution in 1,2-dichloroethane is pipetted in by the synthesizer. After 24 h, the solution is initially admixed with 3 ml of saturated NaHCOa solution and the reaction mixture is filtered through a two-phase cartridge. The product is obtained after concentrating the filtrate under reduced pressure.<br>
All reactions are monitored by thin-layer chromatography. If the reaction is not complete after 24 h at RT, the mixture is heated to 60°C for a further 12 h and the experiment is subsequently terminated.<br>
