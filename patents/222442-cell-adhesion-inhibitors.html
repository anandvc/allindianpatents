				<td>CELL ADHESION INHIBITORS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Cell adhesion is a process by which cells associate with each other, migrate towards a specific target or localize within the extra-cellular matrix. As such, cell adhesion constitutes one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying numerous biological phenomena. For example, cell adhesion is responsible for the adhesion of hematopoietic cells to endothelial cells and the subsequent migration of those hemopoietic cells out of blood vessels and to the site of injury. As such, cell adhesion plays a role in pathologies such as inflammation and immune reactions in mammals.<br>
Investigations into the molecular basis for cell adhesion have revealed that various cell-surface macromolecules -- collectively known as cell adhesion molecules or receptors — mediate cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. For example, proteins of the superfamily called "integrins" are key mediators in adhesive interactions between hematopoietic cells and their microenvironment (M.E. Hemler, "VLA Proteins in the Integrin Family: Structures, Functions, and Their Role on Leukocytes.", Ann. Rev. Immunol., 8, p. 365 (1990)). Integrins are non-covalent heterodimeric complexes consisting of two subunits called a and D. There are at least 12 different a subunits (al-a6, a-L, a-M, a-X, a-IIB, a-V and a-E) and at least 9 different B (B1-B9) subunits. Based on the type of its a and B subunit components, each integrin molecule is categorized into a subfamily.<br>
a4Bl integrin, also known as very late antigen-4 ("VLA-4"), CD49d/CD29, is a leukocyte cell surface receptor that participates in a wide variety of both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive interactions (M.E. Hemler, Ann. Rev. Immunol.. 8, p. 365 (1990)). It serves as a receptor for the cytokine-inducible endothelial cell surface protein, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ("VCAM-1"), as well as to the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin ("FN") (Ruegg et al., J. Cell Biol.. 177, p. 179 (1991); Wayner et al., J. Cell Biol.. 105, p. 1873 (1987); Kramer et al'., J. Biol. Chem.. 264, p. 4684 (1989); Gehlsen et al. Science. 24, p.<br><br>
1228 (1988)). Anti-VLA4 monoclonal antibodies ("mAb's") have been shown to inhibit VLA4-dependeni adhesive interactions both in vitro and in vivo (Ferguson et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.. 88, p. 8072 (1991); Ferguson et al., J. Immunol.. 150, p. 1172 (1993)). Results of in vivo experiments suggest that this inhibition of VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion may prevent or inhibit several inflammatory and autoimmune pathologies (R. L. Lobb et al., "The Pathophysiologic Role of a4 Integrins In Vivo", J. Clin. Invest.. 94, pp. 1722-28 (1994)).<br>
" Despite these advances, there remains a need for small, specific inhibitors of VLA-4-dependent cell adhesion. Ideally, such inhibitors may be orally administered. Such compounds would provide useful agents for treatment, prevention or suppression of various pathologies mediated by cell adhesion and VLA-4 binding.<br>
SUMMARY<br>

Compounds of the invention, R3-L-L'-R', according to one embodiment, can be represented as R3-Y4-Y3-CHPQ-Y1-R1. This compound can be viewed as a dipeptide derivative: with R1 as an amino acid residue or a derivative thereof; Y1 as an amide linkage, or a derivative thereof, between the two residues; X as a carboxylate or a derivative thereof; C as the a-carbon atom of the second residue; and R3-Y4-Y3- as the side chain of the second residue.<br><br>
In the general method illustrated below, the compound R-YCHQQ-Y-R is prepared by first coupling a properly protected Y4 -Y3-CHpQ-Y' with a properly protected R3'.   Y3 and X have been defined above. Y4', Y1', and R3' are precursors of Y4, Y1, and R3, respectively.<br>
Compounds of the formula Y4 -Y3-CH(X)-Y' are available commercially or can be prepared according to methods known one of ordinary skill hi the art. For example, if Y1 is an amino group; X is a carboxylate; and Y4 -Y3- is NH2-(CH2)3-, the compound Y4 -Y3-CH(X)-Y' isornithine. As another example, if Y1 is an amino group, X is carboxylate and Y^-Y3- is 4-NH2-phenyl-CH2-, the compound Y4'-Y3-CH(X)-Y1' is 4-aminophenylalanine, available by reduction of commercially available is 4-nitrophenylalanine. Further reduction of the phenyl moiety produces a compound wherein Y1 is an amino group, X is carboxylate and Y4 -Y3- is 4-NH2-cyclohexyl-CH2-, or 4-aminocyclohexylalanine, available commercially as a mixture of cis and trans isomers. As mentioned above, proper protecting groups are required to prevent certain functionalities from undergoing undesired reactions. Using omimine as an example, Y1 and X are functionalities that are not involved hi the first coupling reaction, and should be protected with common amino protecting groups such as carbamates (e.g., t-butyl carbamate (BOC) and benzyl carbamate (CBZ)) and common carboxyl protecting groups such as substituted esters (e.g., ethyl ester and methoxymethyl ester). For more appropriate protecting groups, see T. W. Greene, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1981, and references cited therein.<br>
The compound R3' can be represented by the formula Z3-Lb-Z4-T or R4-Y5-N(R5)-CH(R6)-T. Each of T and T' is a functionality which joins with Y4' to form Y4. For example, if the desired Y4 is an amide linkage, it can be formed by reacting an amine group (Y4 ) with a carboxyl group (T or T') in the presence of a common coupling reagent such as benzotriazol-1 -yloxytris(dimethylamino)-phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP) or O-benzo-triazol-l-yl-A^A^A^'^'-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate (HBTU). As another example, if the desired Y4 is an aryl ether, it can be formed by reacting a phenol with an alcohol in the presence of diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) and triphenylphosphine.<br>
When R3 is of the formula Z3-Lb-Z4-T, the compound is available commercially or can be prepared according to methods known one of ordinary skill hi the art. For example, when Z3 is 2-methyl phenyl; Z4 is phenylmethyl; Lb is -NH-CO-NH- and T is -COOH, R3' is<br><br>
6-methylphenyl-ureido-phenyl acetic acid and can be obtained by reaction of 4-arninophcnylacetic acid with 2-methylphenyl isocyanate. As another example, when Z3 is 3-indole; Z4 is phenylmethyl; Lb is -CO-NH- and T is -COOH, R3' is 3-indolecarboxamido-phenyl acetic acid and can be obtained by reaction of 4-aminophenylacetic acid with indole-3-carbonyl chloride.<br>
When R3' is of the formula R4-Y5-N(R5)-CH(R6)-T', Y4'-Y3-CH(X)-Y1' can couple to NHCR5)-CH(R6)-T to form the intermediate NH(R5)-CH(R6)-Y4-Y3-CH(X)-Y1' prior to further coupling to R4-Y5' to form R4-Y'-NCR^-CHCR^-Y4-Y3-CHPO-Y!'. Y5' is a functionality which, upon undergoing further coupling reactions, gives rise to the functionality Y5. Note that the compound NH(R5)-CH(R6)-T' can be an amino acid derivative which is commercially available and can be prepared using conventional methods by one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, when T' is carboxyl; R6 is isobutyl; and R5 is methyl, the compound NH(R5)-CH(R6)-T' is N-methylleucine. R4-Y?' can be coupled to NH(R5)-CH(R6)-Y4-Y3-CHPQ-Y1' by commonly used synthetic methods. For example, if Y5 is carboxyl, the resulting Y is an amide linkage and can be prepared using common peptide synthesis reagents as mentioned above. As another example, if Y5 is an halide or sulfonate the resulting Y5 is a secondary or tertiary amine resulting from alkylation of the starting amine. Alternatively, to form the compound R4-Y5-N(R5)-CH(R6)-Y4-Y3-CH(X)-Y1'. NH(R5)-CH(R6)-T' can first couple to R4-Y5' to form the intermediate R4-Y5-N(R5)-CH(R6)-r prior to further coupling to Y4'-Y3-CH(X)-Y1'. Example 1 below provides a detailed procedure wherein R3- is of the formula R4-Y5-N(R5)-CH(R6)-<br>
Alternatively, when R3' is of the formula Z3-Lb-Z4-T, it can react with Y4'-Y3-CH(X)-Y1' to form Z3-Lb-Z4-Y4-Y3-CH(X)-Y!. See Example 2.<br>
The final product R3-Y4-Y3-CH(X)-Y1 can then be formed by reacting either R4-Y5-N(R5)-CH(R6)-Y4-Y3-CH(X)-Y1' or Z3-Lb-Z4-Y4-Y3-CH(X)-Y1' with R1' (the precursor of Rl). The moiety Y can be formed in a similar manner as Y4.<br><br>

examples of these modifications include, but are not limited to, esterification with polyethylene glycols, derivatization with pivolates or fatty acid substituents, conversion to carbamates, hydroxylation of aromatic rings, and heteroatom-substitution in aromatic rings. Also included are non-classical isoteres such as COaH, SOaNHR,<br>

Once synthesized, the activities and VLA-4 specificities of the compounds according to this invention may be determined using in vitro and in vivo assays.<br>
For example, the cell adhesion inhibitory activity of these compounds may be measured by determining the concentration of inhibitor required to block the binding of VLA-4-expressing cells to fibronectin- or CS1-coated plates. In this assay microtiter wells are coated with either fibronectin (containing the CS-1 sequence) or CS-1. If CS-1 is used, it must be conjugated to a carrier protein, such as bovine serum albumin, in order to bind to the wells. Once the wells are coated, varying concentrations of the test compound are then added together with appropriately labelled, VLA-4-expressing cells. Alternatively, the test compound may be added first and allowed to incubate with the coated wells prior to the addition of the cells. The cells are allowed to incubate in the wells for at least 30 minutes. Following incubation, the wells are emptied and washed. Inhibition of binding is measured by quantitating the fluorescence or radioactivity bound to the plate for each of the various concentrations of test compound, as well as for controls containing no test compound.<br>
VLA-4-expressing cells that may be utilized in this assay include Ramos cells, Jurkat cells, A375 melanoma cells, as well as human peripheral blood lymophocytes (PBLs). The cells used in this assay may be fluorescently or radioactively labelled.<br>
A direct binding assay may also be employed to quantitate the inhibitory activity of the compounds of this invention. In this assay, a VCAM-IgG fusion protein containing the first two immunoglobulin domains of VCAM (D1D2) attached above the hinge region of an IgGl molecule ("VCAM 2D-IgG"), is conjugated to a marker enzyme, such as alkaline phosphatase ("AP"). The synthesis of this VCAM-IgG fusion is described in PCT publication WO 90/13300, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. The<br><br>
Conjugation of that fusion to a marker enzyme is achieved by cross-linking methods well-known in the art.<br>
The VCAM-IgG enzyme conjugate is then placed in the wells of a multi-well filtration plate, such as that contained in the Millipore Multiscreen Assay System (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Varying concentrations of the test inhibitory compound are then added to the wells followed by addition of VLA-4-expressing cells. The cells, compound and VCAM-IgG enzyme conjugate are mixed together and allowed to incubate at room temperature.<br>
Following incubation, the wells are vacuum drained, leaving behind the cells and any bound VCAM.   Quantitation of bound VCAM is determined by adding an appropriate colorimetric "substrate for the enzyme conjugated to VCAM-IgG and determining the amount of reaction product. Decreased reaction product indicates increased binding inhibitory activity.<br>
In order to assess the VLA-4 inhibitory specificity of the compounds of this invention, assays for other major groups of integrins, i.e., B2 and B3, as well as other fil integrins, such as VLA-5, VLA-6 and a4B7 are performed. These assays may be similar to the adhesion inhibition and direct binding assays described above, substituting the appropriate integrin-expressing cell and corresponding ligand. For example, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) express B2 integrins on their surface and bind to ICAM. B3 integrins are involved in platelet aggregation and inhibition may be measured in a standard platelet aggregation assay. VLA-5 binds specifically to Arg-Gly-Asp sequences, while VLA-6 binds to laminin. a4B7 is a recently discovered homologue of VLA-4, which also binds fibronectin and VCAM. Specificity with respect to a4B7 is determined in a binding assay that utilizes the above-described VCAM-IgG-enzyme marker conjugate and a cell line that expresses a4B7, but not VLA-4, such as RPMI-8866 cells.<br>
Once VLA-4-specific inhibitors are identified, they may be further characterized in in vivo assays. One such assay tests the inhibition of contact hypersensitivity in an animal, such as described by P.L. Chisholm et ah, "Monoclonal Antibodies to the Integrin a-4 Subunit Inhibit the Murine Contact Hypersensitivity Response", Eur. J. Immunoh. 23, pp. 682-688 (1993) and in "Current Protocols in Immunology", J. E. Coligan, et ah, Eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1, pp. 4.2.1-4.2.5 (1991), the disclosures of which is herein<br><br>
incorporated by reference. In this assay, the skin of the animal is sensitized by exposure to an irritant, such as dinitrofluorobenzene, followed by light physical irritation, such as scratching the skin lightly with a sharp edge. Following a recovery period, the animals are re-sensitized following the same procedure. Several days after sensitization, one ear of the animal is exposed to the chemical irritant, while the other ear is treated with a non-irritant control solution. Shortly after treating the ears, the animals are given various doses of the VLA-4 inhibitor by subcutaneous injection. In vivo inhibition of cell adhesion-associated inflammation is assessed by measuring the ear swelling response of the animal hi the treated versus untreated ear. Swelling is measured using calipers or other suitable instrument to measure ear thickness, hi this manner, one may identify those inhibitors of this invention which are best suited for inhibiting inflammation.<br>
Another in vivo assay that may be employed to test the inhibitors of this invention is the sheep asthma assay. This assay is performed essentially as described in W. M. Abraham et al., "a-Integrins Mediate Antigen-induced Late Bronchial Responses and Prolonged Airway Hyperresponsiveness in Sheep", J. Clin. Invest.. 93, pp. 776-87 (1994), the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference. This assay measures inhibition ofAscaris antigen-induced late phase airway responses and airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic sheep.<br>

homoserine benzyl ester I (1.2 g, 3.89 mmol), 4-nitrophenol (485 mg, 4.08 mmol) and triphenylphosphine (1.2 g, 4.66 mmol) in THF (10 mL) diethylazodicarboxylate (DEAD) (0.74 mL, 4.66 mmol) was added dropwise and the reaction was stirred at room temperature 12-24h. Upon completion as judged by LC the solvents were removed to afford a viscous syrup. 4N HC1 in dioxane (10 mL) was added rapidly and the solution was stirred at room temperature 3-6 h or until judged complete by LC. The reaction was concentrated to 1A<br>
volume and the product was precipitated out of ehtyl acetate to afford the hydrochloride salt IT (96% pure, LC) as a white solid (867 mg, 2.36 mmol, 61%). ESMS: (M-C1) = 331.<br>
To a solution of Intermediate 4 (117 mg, 0.46 mmol) in DMF (3 mL) was added DIPEA (0.27 mL, 1.84 mmol) followed sequentially by the hydrochloride salt fl (160 mg, 0.48 mmol) and HATU (239 mg, 0.63 mmol). The solution was stirred at room temperature for 2- 4 h until judged complete by LC. The reaction was diluted with ethyl acetate (30 mL) and washed with 5% bicarbonate (10 mL), water (10 mL), citric acid (10 mL), brine (2x10 mL) and dried over sodium sulfate to afford the crude product in as a tan foam (213 mg, 0.37 mmol, 82%) which was used directly.<br>
ESMS: (M+H) = 568.<br>
The above material was dissolved in ethyl acetate (15 mL), 10% Pd/C (200 mg) was added and the reaction was subjected to hydrogenolysis at 50 psi for 4-6 h or until judged complete by LC. Filtration through celite and concentration afforded the crude aniline IV (144 mg, 0.32 mmol, 87%) as a tan foam which was used immediately.<br>
ESMS: (M+H) = 448.<br>
The aniline (74 mg, 0.17 mmol) obtained above was dissolved in DMF (3 mL) and oMePUPA (52 mg, 0.18 mmol) was added followed by DIPEA (0.08 mL, 0.43 mmol) and HATU (69 mg, 0.18 mmol) and the reaction was stirred at room temperature 3-4 h until complete by LC. Purification by HPLC afforded Bio-8355 (39 mg, 0.054 mmol, 30%) as a white solid.<br>
