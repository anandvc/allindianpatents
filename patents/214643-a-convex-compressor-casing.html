				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to gas turbine engines, and,<br>
more specifically, to compressors thereof.<br>
A turbofan gas turbine engine includes a fan followed in turn by a<br>
multi-stage axial compressor each including a row of circumferentially<br>
spaced apart rotor blades, typically cooperating with stator vanes. The<br>
blades operate at rotational speeds which can result in subsonic through<br>
supersonic flow of the air, with corresponding shock therefrom. Shock<br>
introduces pressure losses and reduces efficiency.<br>
Fan blades are the largest form of compressor blades whose radially<br>
outer tips experience the greatest relative velocity and are subject to strong<br>
passage and leading edge shock waves.<br>
A stationary casing surrounds the rotor blades and includes a radially<br>
inwardly facing inner surface defining a shroud which forms a small radial tip<br>
clearance or gap with the rotor blades during operation. As the blades<br>
compress or pump airflow between the flow passages defined between<br>
adjacent blades, a differential pressure is created between the opposite<br>
pressure and suction sides of each blade. This differential pressure causes a<br>
portion of the pressurized air to flow through the tip gap and reduces<br>
pumping efficiency.<br>
Furthermore, the airflow leaking over the blade tips typically rolls up<br>
into a vortex near the casing shroud which generates significant efficiency<br>
loss and aerodynamic flow blockage.<br>
The flow pumping capacity of a compressor rotor stage is its ability to<br>
maximize airflow through the passages between adjacent blades. Pumping<br>
should be effected with maximum efficiency, and with a suitable stall or<br>
throttle margin. Airfoil leakage at the blade tips creates an aerodynamic<br>
flow blockage in those outer portions of the flow passages between<br>
adjacent tips which decreases pumping capacity and efficiency.<br>
The presence of shock waves at the blade tips increases this problem.<br>
As the tip vortex passes through a shock wave, rapid diffusion of the air<br>
occurs with corresponding pressure losses and increase in aerodynamic flow<br>
blockage.<br>
Accordingly, it is desired to provide an improved compressor casing<br>
and cooperating blade tips for reducing tip vortex related performance loss<br>
and flow blockage for improving pumping efficiency and throttle margin.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A compressor casing includes an axially convex inner surface for<br>
surrounding a row of rotor blades with radial gaps therebetween. The tip of<br>
the blades complement the casing contour for reducing blade tip losses and<br>
flow blockage.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Illustrated in Figure 1 is a fan 10 of an exemplary turbofan gas turbine<br>
engine shown in part. The fan 10 is axisymmetrical about an axial centerline<br>
axis 12.<br>
The fan includes a row of circumferentially spaced apart airfoils 14 in<br>
the exemplary form of fan rotor blades as illustrated in Figures 1-3. As<br>
initially shown in Figure 3, each of the airfoils 14 includes a generally<br>
concave, pressure side 16 and a circumferentially opposite, generally<br>
convex, suction side 18 extending longitudinally or radially in span along<br>
transverse or radial sections from a radially inner root 20 to a radially outer<br>
tip 22.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, each airfoil 14 extends radially outwardly along<br>
a radial axis 24 along which the varying radial or transverse sections of the<br>
airfoil may be defined. Each airfoil also includes axially or chordally spaced<br>
apart leading and trailing edges 26,28 between which the pressure and<br>
suction sides extend axially.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, each radial or transverse section of the airfoil<br>
has a conventional straight chord between the leading and trailing edges, as<br>
well as an arcuate camber line therebetween. The airfoil twists from root to<br>
tip for cooperating with the air 30 channeled thereover during operation.<br>
The section chords vary in twist angle A from root to tip in a conventional<br>
manner.<br>
The flowpath for the air channeled between the airfoils is bound<br>
radially outwardly by an annular fan or compressor casing 32 and radially<br>
inwardly by corresponding integral platforms 34 of each blade at which the<br>
roots 20 are located. A conventional dovetail 36 integrally joins each blade<br>
to a rotor disk 38 having complementary axial dovetail slots for radially<br>
retaining the blades thereto.<br>
Referring again to Figure 1, the fan blades 14 are illustrated inside an<br>
exemplary annular casing 32. The size and configuration of the blades are<br>
typically specified for obtaining a desired maximum amount of flow pumping<br>
capacity of the fan expressed in mass per second. The fan is initially<br>
designed for maximizing compression efficiency with an acceptable amount<br>
of stall or throttle margin.<br>
The blade tips are typically sized and configured for providing a<br>
substantially uniform tip clearance or gap B with the casing 32 for<br>
minimizing airflow leakage therethrough during operation while preventing or<br>
reducing undesirable tip rubs against the casing. A conventional casing (not<br>
shown) is straight axially with either a cylindrical inner surface facing the<br>
blade tips, or with a conical converging, or diverging surface facing the tips.<br>
In view of the substantial amount of blade twist typical in first stage<br>
fan blades, the blade tips extend in part circumferentially around the inner<br>
surface of the casing and must necessarily be radially outwardly bowed for<br>
achieving the desired uniform tip gap inside the cylindrical or conical casing.<br>
The configurations of adjacent blades are typically designed for<br>
effecting a flow passage 40 having a converging-diverging form near the<br>
blade tips as shown in Figure 3 for decelerating the airflow between the<br>
leading and trailing edges. The inboard form of the flow passage down to<br>
the blade roots diverges only. Diffusion occurs in the flow passage with<br>
static pressure rising as velocity decreases. The tip vortex acts as a<br>
blockage to limit the static pressure rise.<br>
Since large fan blades can experience high Mach number flow at the<br>
tips thereof, the tip vortex 30v, as shown schematically in Figures 3 and 4,<br>
can interact with shock waves. The supersonic blade tip flow may create<br>
oblique shock waves emanating from the blade leading edges and a normal<br>
shock wave residing in the passage between adjacent blades. As indicated<br>
above, the pressure losses due to tip vortices are further increased by these<br>
forms of tip shock which decrease pumping capacity and compression<br>
efficiency.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the fan casing 32 illustrated<br>
in Figure 1 has a specifically contoured radially inner surface defining a<br>
stationary shroud which is at least in part axially convex for surrounding the<br>
row of rotor blades 14 disposed coaxially therein, with the blade tips 22<br>
being complementary with the contour of the casing for effecting a<br>
substantially uniform gap B therebetween.<br>
As shown in exaggerated enlargement in Figure 4, the inner surface<br>
of the casing 32 extends axially to surround the blades 14 from leading to<br>
trailing edge 26,28, and is axially convex at least along an aft portion<br>
thereof 32a to surround the blade tips at the trailing edges 28. Since the<br>
blade tips 22 complement the axial contour of the casing, each blade tip<br>
includes an aft part 22a which is radially inwardly concave at least in aft<br>
axial part from the trailing edge 28 toward the leading edge 26. In this way,<br>
the radially facing aft portions of the blade tips 22 and the casing inner<br>
surface complement each other with the former being radially inwardly<br>
concave and the latter being radially inwardly convex in the axial direction to<br>
effect the uniform gap B therebetween.<br>
The axial contour of the casing inner surface illustrated in Figure 4 is<br>
only one component of the complex three dimensional (3-D) configuration of<br>
the corresponding flow passages 40 defined between circumferentially<br>
adjacent blades 14. The radial sectional configurations of the blades from<br>
leading to trailing edge are conventionally defined for maximizing flow<br>
pumping capacity and compression efficiency with suitable stall margin.<br>
Each flow passage 40 includes a conventional induction area 40a as shown<br>
in Figures 3 and 4. The induction area extends from the pressure side at the<br>
leading edge of one blade to the suction side aft of the leading edge of the<br>
next adjacent blade and defines that area which encompasses the first<br>
covered pressure expansion wave during operation.<br>
Immediately aft of the induction area 40a is the passage mouth 40b<br>
which extends from the pressure side at the leading edge of one blade<br>
generally perpendicularly to a corresponding portion on the suction side of<br>
the next adjacent blade aft from the leading edge and the induction area.<br>
The flow passage converges from its mouth to a throat 40c of minimum<br>
area suitably disposed generally aft of the midchord region of the blades<br>
from which the flow passage diverges to an outlet 40d having a larger<br>
discharge area, and defined between the suction side at the trailing edge of<br>
one blade generally perpendicularly to the pressure side of the next adjacent<br>
blade forward of the trailing edge thereof.<br>
The converging-diverging contour of each flow passage 40<br>
decelerates the airflow in turn for pressurizing the air as diffusion occurs in<br>
the axial direction as the air flows between the fan blades.<br>
The significance of the preferentially contoured casing 32 may be<br>
additionally appreciated upon examination of Figure 5 in which the contours<br>
of the casing and complementary fan blade are exaggerated. Shown in<br>
dashed line inside the casing 32 is a conventional conical configuration<br>
thereof which cooperates with a straight, conical blade tip, shown in<br>
phantom line in axial profile, of a conventional fan blade. By forming the aft<br>
portion 32a of the casing inner surface axially convex upstream from the<br>
blade trailing edges, a local reduction in diffusion of the tip vortex generated<br>
during operation can be obtained.<br>
Reducing diffusion of the tip vortex correspondingly reduces the<br>
pressure losses therefrom and the aerodynamic flow blockage for both<br>
increasing flow pumping capacity and compression efficiency within the<br>
constraints of a particularly sized fan. The outer diameters of the fan blades<br>
at their leading and trailing edges and the corresponding inner diameters of<br>
the opposing casing portions may remain the same as conventional values,<br>
but with an improved recontouring of the inner surface axially therebetween<br>
for locally enhancing aerodynamic performance.<br>
The convex aft portion 32a of the casing inner surface may be<br>
effected in various manners including continuously arcuate, or segmented in<br>
conical portions as desired. From the aft portion, the casing may then be<br>
suitably contoured to return to a given inner diameter outboard of the blade<br>
edges.<br>
More specifically, and referring to Figures 4 and 5, the casing inner<br>
surface further includes a forward portion 32b disposed axially upstream of<br>
the aft portion 32a for surrounding the blade tips at the leading edges 26<br>
thereof. The casing forward portion 32b has a larger diameter about the fan<br>
centerline axis than the aft portion 32a, and thusly the casing converges<br>
therebetween.<br>
For example, the casing inner surface preferably also includes an<br>
intermediate portion 32c disposed axially between the forward and aft<br>
portions 32b,a which converges therebetween in the aft direction.<br>
The complementary blade tips 22 further include an axially forward<br>
part 22b and an intermediate or midchord part 22c axially aligned with<br>
corresponding portions of the casing. The respective parts of the blade tip<br>
vary in contour with the corresponding portions of the casing inner surface<br>
therearound between the leading and trailing edges of the blades to maintain<br>
a substantially uniform radial gap B therebetween. Since the casing<br>
intermediate portion 32c converges in a downstream direction, the<br>
intermediate part 22c of the blade tip also converges or slopes inwardly in<br>
profile in the axial direction between the forward and aft parts thereof.<br>
The inner, surface of the casing 32 is preferentially contoured to<br>
create an improved axial distribution of static pressure for locally reducing<br>
diffusion of the tip vortex to improve aerodynamic performance.<br>
Furthermore, the local reduction in diffusion additionally reduces the strength<br>
of normal shock for supersonic applications which in turn further reduces the<br>
degree of vortex diffusion across that shock. Since the tip vortex is subject<br>
to less severe static pressure rise gradient behind the shock, this tends to<br>
yet further reduce pressure losses, and reduce or prevent migration of the<br>
vortex toward the pressure side of the adjacent blade.<br>
The reduction of normal shock strength and the lower vortex pressure<br>
loss and lower vortex flow blockage all contribute to a higher efficiency<br>
compressor rotor with improved pumping capability and increase throttle<br>
range. In one design analyzed using three dimensional viscous flow analysis<br>
on a transonic rotor at high specific flow, a casing contoured in accordance<br>
with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention resulted in a<br>
significant increase in total airflow and correspondingly higher rotor<br>
efficiency at the same rotational speed when compared with a conventional<br>
conical casing design.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in Figure 4, the casing<br>
forward portion 32b over the blade leading edges has a larger outer diameter<br>
from the fan centerline axis than the casing aft portion 32a over the blade<br>
trailing edges. The contour of the casing inner surface is preferably selected<br>
for locally opening the induction area and throat of the flow passages, while<br>
the exit or discharge area of the flow passages remains the same for a given<br>
application. This also reduces effective camber at high speed of the fan for<br>
increasing total pumping flow with increased compression efficiency.<br>
Since the outer diameters of the blade leading edges and trailing<br>
edges is preferably specified for a particular fan design, and in view of the<br>
improved axial contour of the forward and aft casing portions 32b,a, the<br>
casing intermediate portion 32c preferably converges greater than the<br>
forward and aft portions 32b,a for providing an aerodynamic transition<br>
between the different local effects around the leading and trailing edges of<br>
the blades.<br>
As indicated above, the casing aft portion 32a over the blade trailing<br>
edges is axially convex and arcuate in the preferred embodiment. In<br>
alternate embodiments, the convex contour of the casing aft portion may<br>
include axially straight segments, such as one or more conical segments<br>
over the trailing edge region of the blades.<br>
The casing intermediate portion 32c is preferably axially straight in<br>
the form of a conical section having a slope angle C, or cone half-angle,<br>
which is substantially greater than the corresponding slope angles of the<br>
forward and aft portions 32b,a. In this way, the forward and aft portions<br>
have limited slope or convergence, with a majority of slope and convergence<br>
occurring over the casing intermediate portion 32c corresponding to the<br>
midchord to aft portion of the blade tips being surrounded.<br>
The casing forward portion 32b is preferably axially straight where it<br>
begins over the blade leading edges, either with a generally constant radius<br>
or inner diameter or slightly converging in the form of a conical section. The<br>
casing forward portion 32b preferably transitions to an axially arcuate form<br>
as it joins the casing intermediate portion 32c. In this way, the casing<br>
forward portion 32b is axially straight in its forward part over the leading<br>
edge, and is preferably axially concave in its aft part as it joins the preferably<br>
straight conical intermediate portion 32c. The casing aft portion 32a then<br>
follows in turn with axial convex contour for completing the hybrid axial<br>
contour of the casing surrounding the blade tips from the leading to trailing<br>
edges thereof.<br>
As indicated above, the axial contour of the blade tips 22 as they<br>
extend radially outwardly toward the inner surface of the casing 32 are<br>
complementary to the respective portions thereof. Accordingly, the forward<br>
parts 22b of the blade tips transition in axial side view from straight to<br>
axially convex for matching the complementary axial contour of the casing<br>
forward portion 32b which transitions from straight to axially concave. The<br>
intermediate parts 22c of the blade tips are axially conical to complement<br>
the axially conical casing intermediate portion 32c. And, the aft parts 22a<br>
of the blade tips are axially concave to complement the axially convex<br>
casing aft portion 32a.<br>
In this way, the axial contour of the inner surface of the casing 32<br>
where it surrounds the blade tips from leading to trailing edges varies for<br>
effecting a favorable axial distribution of static pressure for reducing local<br>
diffusion of tip vortices, and the strength of normal shock during supersonic<br>
operation, in addition to the benefits previously described above.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the inner surface of the casing 32 further<br>
includes an annular inlet portion 32d extending upstream from the forward<br>
portion 32b outboard of the blade leading edges 26. The inlet portion 32d<br>
may be cylindrical, conically divergent, or conically convergent, and is<br>
coaxial with the other casing portions for channeling the airflow 30 thereto.<br>
In Figure 4, the inlet portion 32d is preferably axially divergent, and<br>
smoothly blends with the shroud forward portion 32b for maximizing the<br>
induction area 40a.<br>
In the Figure 5 embodiment, the inlet portion 32d has a reduced inner<br>
diameter and coaxially joins the casing forward portion 32b at a radially<br>
outwardly extending step 42 which effectively positions the casing inner<br>
surface surrounding the blade tips in a recessed trench defining a shroud<br>
around the blade tips. Shroud trenching is conventional, but may be used<br>
with the preferentially axially contoured casing inner surface in accordance<br>
with the present invention for improving performance of the fan.<br>
The embodiment illustrated in Figures 1-5 is representative of a<br>
relatively long fan blade whose outer portion pressurizes air for discharge<br>
from a turbofan engine to produce propulsion thrust. The invention,<br>
however, is also applicable to other types of compressor airfoils such as the<br>
axial compressor blade 14B illustrated schematically in Figure 6.<br>
The compressor blade 14B extends radially outwardly from a<br>
supporting disk or drum 38a in one of several axial rotor and stator stages of<br>
a compressor in a conventional manner. Disposed upstream from the row of<br>
compressor blades is a corresponding row of stator vanes 44 which guide<br>
the airflow 30 to the compressor blades.<br>
The airflow is channeled axially from vane to blade of the several<br>
stages, and is bound radially outwardly and inwardly by the flowpath<br>
endwalls. The casing defines the outer wall, and the drum defines the inner<br>
wall between which the vane and blade airfoils extend. The vanes are<br>
spaced from the inner wall to define a radial gap therebetween, like the<br>
blade tip gap, to permit relative rotational movement.<br>
In this embodiment, the casing inner surface includes axially adjoining<br>
aft and forward portions 32a,b surrounding the compressor blades 14B.<br>
The entire casing inner surface between the leading and trailing edges of the<br>
blades is axially convex in this embodiment for again locally reducing<br>
diffusion of the tip vortices for enhancing air pumping capacity by reducing<br>
flow blockage and pressure losses.<br>
In this embodiment, the annular inlet portion 32d of the casing<br>
coaxially joins the casing forward portion 32b upstream therefrom and<br>
preferably converges in the downstream direction either in conical section,<br>
or axially concave as illustrated in the preferred embodiment.<br>
The tips of the compressor blades 14B have complementary contours<br>
for matching the convex axial contour of the casing inner surface to provide<br>
a substantially uniform radial gap therebetween. Accordingly, the adjoining<br>
aft and forward parts 22a,b of the blade tips are axially concave to<br>
complement the axially convex contour of the surrounding casing inner<br>
surface.<br>
Compressor performance may be additionally improved by introducing<br>
circumferential slots or grooves in the casing. In conventional practice, such<br>
grooves can enhance rotor throttle margin, but this usually results in poorer<br>
rotor efficiency.<br>
However, such grooves in combination with the convex casing<br>
contour described above provide additional benefit not otherwise possible.<br>
For example, Figure 4 additionally illustrates a single circumferential groove<br>
46 disposed in the forward portion of the casing 32, which groove is open<br>
toward the blade tip 22 inboard therefrom. The casing groove and convex<br>
contour complement each other to maximize performance and stability<br>
improvements.<br>
The casing groove acts to enhance stability and to allow more<br>
aggressive convex contouring than would otherwise be possible. The<br>
discontinuity introduced by the groove 46 allows the induction and throat<br>
areas to be maximized while also allowing higher convex casing curvatures<br>
32a downstream. Without the groove, the casing flowpath could otherwise<br>
have a higher concave curvature in its place which could degrade<br>
performance and stability.<br>
The performance penalty usually associated with casing grooves is<br>
avoided by the use of fewer grooves, preferably a single groove, and by the<br>
more favorable tip static pressure distribution imposed by the casing<br>
contour.<br>
In the embodiments disclosed above, improved pumping capacity and<br>
efficiency may be obtained. Since the embodiment illustrated in Figure 6<br>
includes the axially convex casing inner surface only, it does not realize all<br>
the advantages described above for the first embodiment.<br>
However, the different embodiments disclosed above permit minimal<br>
changes in casing and blade tip geometry for obtaining enhanced<br>
performance of compressor and fan blades without otherwise changing the<br>
overall size of the fan or compressor stages. For given design specifications,<br>
the axially contoured casings and complementary blade tips permit<br>
substantial improvements in performance not otherwise possible. These<br>
new features may be incorporated into existing designs where feasible for<br>
enhancing performance of fans and compressors, either subsonically or<br>
supersonically.<br>
While there have been described herein what are considered to be<br>
preferred and exemplary embodiments of the present invention, other<br>
modifications of the invention shall be apparent to those skilled in the art<br>
from the teachings herein, and it is, therefore, desired to be secured in the<br>
appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and<br>
