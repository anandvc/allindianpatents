				<td>METHODS TO MANUFACTURE 1,3-DIOXOLANE NUCLEOSIDES<br>
REFERENCE TO PRIOR APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional application 60/541,545, entitled "Methods To Manufacture<br>
1,3-Dioxolane Nucleosides" filed February 3, 2004.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This application provides a process for preparing enantiomerically pure p-D-dioxolane nucleosides. In particular,<br>
a new svnthesis of (-)-DAPD, suitable for large scale development, is described.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
AIDS, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, is a catastrophic disease that has reached global proportions.<br>
Currently an estimated 40 million people worldwide are livmg with AIDS, with approximately 5 million new<br>
infections every year. The yearly death toll is still over 3 million people worldwide. Another virus that causes a<br>
serious human health problem is the hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is second only to tobacco as a cause of<br>
human cancer. Some estimates put the number of people worldwide that have been infected with HBV as high as<br>
two billion people, up to a third of the world's population, with approximately 400 million chronically infected.<br>
A number of 2',3'-dideoxynucleosides have been found to be potent antiviral agents against HIV and/or hepatitis<br>
B virus. After cellular phosphorylation to the 5'-triphosphate by cellular kinase, these synthetic nucleosides are<br>
incorporated into a growing strand of viral DNA, causing chain termination due to the absence of the 3'-hydroxyl<br>
group. They can also inhibit the viral enzyme reverse transcnptase.<br>
There has also been interest in the synthesis of nucleoside denvatives in which the 3'-carbon of the nucleoside has<br>
been replaced with a heteroatom. Both 3TC and its 5-fluorocytosine analog (FTC) exhibit activity against HIV<br>
and HBV (Furman, et al., Antimic. Ag. Chemo., 1992, 2686-2692; and Cheng, et al.. J. Biol. Chem., 1992,<br>
267(20).! 3938-13942).<br>
The discovery that a racemic oxathiolane nucleoside BCH-189 possessed a potent activity against replication of<br>
HIV prompted Chu et al. to synthesize the chiral products (+)- and (-)-BCH-189 (Belleau, et al., 5th International<br>
Conference on AIDS, Montreal, Canada, June 4-9, 1989, #T.C.O. 1; Chu, et al. Tetr. Lett., 1991, 32, 3791). The<br>
latter compound, lamivudine, otherwise known as 3TC or epivir, is currently used clinically in the treatment of<br>
both HIV infection and HBV infection. The (-) enantiomer of 5-fluorocytosine oxathiolane analogue (FTC), is<br>
particularly active against HIV (Choi, W. et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1991, 113, 9377; Schinazi, R. F., et al.,<br>
Antimic. Ag. Chemo. 1992, 2423; U.S. Patent Nos. 5,204,4665; 5,210,085; 5,914,331; and 5,639,814).<br>
The above-described 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides are manufactured by condensation of silylated purine or<br>
pyrimidine base with a 1,3-oxathiolane intermediate. U.S. Patent No. 5,204,466 discloses a method to condense a<br>
1,3-oxathiolane with a silylated pyrimidine using tin chloride as a Lewis acid, which provides virtually complete<br>
p-stereoselectivity. A number of U.S. patents describe processes for the preparation of 1,3-oxathiolane<br>
nucleosides via condensation of a l,3-oxathiolane-2-carboxylic acid ester with a protected silylated base in the<br>
presence of a silicon-based Lewis acid, followed by reduction of the ester to the corresponding hydroxymethyl<br>
group to afford the final product (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,663,320; 5,693,787; 5,696,254; 5,744,596; 5,756,706 and<br>
5,864,164). In addition, these patents contain generic disclosures for the synthesis of 1,3-dioxolane nucleosides in<br>
ilar fashion using the corresponding 1,3-dioxolane intermediate.<br>
,S. Patent No. 5,272,151 discloses a process using a 2-O-protected-5-O-acylated-l,3-oxathiolane for the<br>
preparation of nucleosides by condensation with a silylated purine or pyrimidine base in the presence of a<br>
titanium catalyst. U.S. Patent No. 6,215,004 discloses a process for producing 1,3-oxathiolane nucleosides that<br>
includes condensing 2-O-protected-methyl-5-chloro-l,3-oxathiolane with a silylated 5-fluorocytosine without a<br>
Lewis acid catalyst. In these cases, the 1,3-oxathiolane ring is prepared in one of the following ways: (i) reaction<br>
of an aldehyde derived from a glyoxylate or glycolic acid with mercaptoacetic acid in toluene in the presence of<br>
p-toluenesulfonic acid to give 5-oxo-l,3-oxathiolane-2-carboxylic acid; (ii) cyclization of anhydrous glyoxylates<br>
with 2-mercaptoacetaldehyde diethylacetal at reflux in toluene to give 5-ethoxy-l,3-oxathiolane lactone: (iii)<br>
condensation of glyoxylic acid ester with mercaptoacetaldehyde (dimeric form) to give 5-hydroxy-l,3-<br>
oxathiolane-2-carboxylic ester or (iv) coupling of an acyloxyacetaldehyde with 2,5-dihydroxy-l,4-dithiane, the<br>
dimeric form of 2-mercaptoacetaldehyde to form a 2-(ayloxy)methyl-5-hydroxy-l,3-oxathiolane. The lactone, 5-<br>
oxo compound, has to be reduced to the corresponding lactol during the process. The 2-carboxylic acid or its<br>
ester also has to be reduced to the corresponding 2-hydroxymethyl derivatives with borane-methylsulfide<br>
complex.<br>
The key intermediate, aldehyde, can be prepared using several methods: (i) lead tetraacetate oxidation of 1.4-di-<br>
O-benzoyl meso-erythritol, 1,6-di-O-benzoyl D-mannitol or 1,5-di-O-benzoyl-D-arabitol; (ii) preparation of<br>
monoacylated ethylene glycol followed by oxidation to aldehyde; (iii) acylation of ethylene chlorohydrin<br>
followed by dimethylsulfoxide oxidation; (v) lead tetraacetate oxidation; (vi) ozonolysis of allyl or 3-methyl-2-<br>
buten-1-ol acylate; (vii) and more recently, by acylation of 2-butene-l,4-diol followed by ozonolysis. Also. U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6.215.004 discloses a process to prepare acyloxyacetaldehyde diethylacetal by acylaticn of 2.2-<br>
diethoxyethanol.<br>
Norbeck, D. W., et al. (Tet. Lett., 1989, 30, 6263) reported the synthesis of (±)-l-(2p\4p)-2-(hydroxynethyl)-4-<br>
dioxolanyl-thymine, that results in a racemic mixture of diastereomers about the C4' atom. The X-ray<br>
crystallographic analysis of the product revealed that the dioxolane ring adopts the T4 conformation commonly<br>
observed in ribonucleosides, with the O3' atom in the endo position, which is quite distinct from the distorted 3E<br>
conformations observed in AZT, AZDU, ddA, ddC, and 3'-deoxy-3'-fluorothymidine, all of which exhibit potent<br>
in vitro activity against HIV.<br>
The antiviral activity of dioxolane nucleosides prompted Chu et al. to synthesize a series of analogs in a search<br>
for potent antiviral and/or anticancer agents. For example, 9-(p-D hydroxymethyl-l,3-dioxolanyl) aminopurine<br>
(P-D-DAPD), and its metabolite 9-(p-D hydroxymethyl-l,3-dioxolanyl)-guanine (P-D-DXG) have been reported<br>
to have potent and selective activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HFV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV)<br>
(Rajagopalan et al., Antiviral Chem. Chemother.,1996, 7(2), 65-70). (-)-DAPD is a potent and selective inhibitor<br>
of HTV in vitro and in vivo and HBV replication in vitro (Furman, et al. Drugs of the Future 2000, 25 (5). 454-<br>
461). Similarly, l-(0-L hydroxvmethyl-l,3-dioxolanyl)-thymine (Dioxolane-T) (Norbeck et al., Tet. Let., 1989,<br>
30, 6263-66) possess anti-HIV and anti-HBV activity. 1-(P-L hydroxymethyl 3-dioxolanyl)-cytidine (p-L-OddC)<br>
was discovered to have potent anti-tumor activity towards human prostate as well as renal carcinoma (Kadhim et<br>
al., Can. Cancer Res., 57(21),4803-10, 1997). (-)-(2'5,4'/?)-l'-[2'-(hydroxy-methyl)-r,3'-dioxolan-4'-yl]-5-<br>
iodouracil) L-IOddU is currently in pre-clinical or clinical studies to assess its value as an antiviral or anticancer<br>
agent (see Kim, et al., J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 519-528 and references therein; Corbett, &amp; Rublein, Curr. Opin.<br>
fhvestig. Drugs 2001, 2, 348-353; Gu, et al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999, 43, 2376-2382; Mewshaw, et<br>
al.,J. Acquir. Immune Defic. Syndr. 2002, 29, 11-20).<br>
US 5,041,449 and US 5,270,315 to Belleau et al. disclose a generic group of racemic 2-substituted-4-substituted-<br>
1,3-dioxolanes. Table 1 of the reference shows data for two racemic 1,3-dioxolane nucleosides - a racemic trans<br>
(a) 1,3-dioxolane nucleoside with a cytosine base (Compound XII) and a racemic cis (P) 1,3-dioxolane nucleoside<br>
with an adenine base (Compound XIV) (see also EP 0 337 713 to IAF BioChem International).<br>
In June 1989, Belleau, et al., reported a method of synthesis of cytidine nucleosides that contain oxygen or sulfur<br>
in the 3'-position (Belleau, B., et al. Fifth International Conference on AIDS, Montreal; International<br>
Development Research Centre: Ottawa, Ontario, 1989; T.C.O.I.). The dioxolane ring was prepared by the<br>
condensation of RCO2CH2CHO with glycerin. The synthesis resulted in a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers<br>
about the C4' carbon of the nucleoside. Racemic DAPD was synthesized as depicted in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Belleau et al. reacted glycerol and chloroacetaldehyde to generate a dioxolane intermediate. After chlorine<br>
displacement with a benzoic acid salt, oxidation of the primary alcohol to a carboxylic acid and Baeyer-Villiger<br>
rearrangement with m-chloroperbenzoic acid, the corresponding racemic dioxolane benzoate was obtained. This<br>
compound was then coupled with 2-amino-6-chloropurine and the resulting nucleoside intermediate was reacted<br>
with ammonia under pressure to afford racemic DAPD. (±)-Dioxolane-T was also synthesized in similar fashion<br>
by Choi et al. (Choi, et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991,113, 9377-9378 and U. S. Patent No. 5,852,027).<br>
As discussed above, in late 1989, Norbeck et al. published an article which described the synthesis of racemic cis-<br>
1,3-dioxolane thymidine which also had anti-HIV activity in vitro (Norbeck, et al. Tet. Let. 1989, 30 (46), 6263-<br>
6266). The product was synthesized in five steps from benzyloxyaldehyde dimethylacetal and (±)-methyl<br>
glycerate to produce a 79% yield of the 1:1 diastereomeric mixture. As with the Belleau synthesis, the Norbeck<br>
synthesis results in a racemic mixture of diastereoisomers about the C41 carbon of the nucleoside. See Scheme<br>
Scheme 2<br>
The same racemic dioxolane acetate intermediate was synthesized by Liotta et. al. starting from <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 3<br>
The drawback of these procedures, shown in Scheme 3, is that they involve the synthesis of an unstable aldehyde<br>
and difficult oxidative step(s).<br>
US 5,179,104 to Chu and Schinazi, discloses a method to obtain enantiomerically pure p-D-l,3-dioxolane<br>
nucleosides via a stereospecific synthesis (see also related U.S. Patent Nos. 5,925,643; 5,767,122; 5,444,063;<br>
5,684,010; 5,834,474; and 5,830,898).<br>
EP 0 515 156 to BioChem Pharma discloses a method to obtain the enantiomers of 1,3-dioxolane nucleosides<br>
using a stereoselective synthesis that includes condensing a 1,3-dioxolane intermediate covalently bound to a<br>
chiral auxiliary with a silyl Lewis acid (see also related U.S. Patent Nos. 5,753,706 and 5,744,596).<br>
Chu, et al., published a stereospecific synthesis of p-D-l,3-dioxolane nucleosides from 1,6-anhydromannose<br>
(Chu, et al. Tet. Let., 1991, 32, 3791-3794). At about the same time, Thomas and Surber published an article<br>
which described that (i) a thorough search of the literature on chiral chromatography failed to reveal any examples<br>
W nucleoside separations and that (ii) their paper appears to be the first separation of the enantiomers of a<br>
nucleoside by chiral high performance liquid chromatography. The nucleoside resolved was not a 1,3-dioxolane<br>
nucleoside, and four out of the five chiral columns attempted did not work (Thomas, et al,JChromat., 1991,586,<br>
265-270).<br>
Kim et al. (Kim, et al. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36 (1), 30-37) subsequently published a paper which discloses an<br>
asymmetric synthesis of P-D and ct-D enantiomers of 1,3-dioxolane pyrimidine nucleosides from 1,6-anhydro-Dmannose.<br>
The synthesis of (-)-DAPD was described as a thirteen step process from 1,6-anhydro-D-mannose<br>
including a nine step conversion of 1,6-anhydro-D-mannose to a chiral acetate (Scheme 4).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
After coupling of the acetate under Vorbruggen conditions and several purification and deprotection steps, (-)-<br>
DAPD was obtained in modest yield. This process is time consuming, difficult and involves complicated<br>
oxidation steps.<br>
In 1992, Belleau et al. (Belleau, et al. Tet. Let. 1992, 33, 6949-6952) published a synthesis of enantiomerically<br>
pure 2',3'-dideoxy-3-oxacytidine stereoisomers via an eight step process using L-ascorbic acid as a chiral<br>
auxiliary. L-ascorbic acid was used to produce a set of diastereomers which could be separated. The use of lead<br>
tetraacetate makes this process unsuitable for scale-up. In 1992, Kim, et al., also published an article disclosing<br>
how to obtain (-)-L-p-dioxolane-C and (+)-L-p-dioxolane-T from 1,6-anhydro-L-p-gulopyranose (Kim, et al., Tet.<br>
Let. 1992,52(46), 5899-6902).<br>
Liotta and Shinazi, in US 5,276,151, found that racemic 2-O-protected-5-O-acylated-l,3-dioxolanes could be<br>
coupled with purine or pyrimidine bases in the presence of a titanium-containing Lewis acid to predominately<br>
generate the racemic p-isomers (see also WO 92/14729).<br>
Jin et al. (Jin, et al. Tet. Asym. 1993, 4 (2), 211-214), discloses that Lewis acid catalysts play a crucial role in the<br>
preparation 1,3-dioxolane nucleosides. TiCL, and SnCl4 promote the formation of dioxolane nucleosides with<br>
racemization in the coupling of enantiomerically pure 2'-deoxy-3'-oxaribosides with silylated N-acetylcytosine.<br>
The use of the Lewis acids trimethy , , , , , 2(Oi-Pr)2 furnishes<br>
enantiomerically pure cytosine dioxolane nucleosides in low diastereoselectivity.<br>
n asymmetric synthesis of dioxolane nucleosides was reported by Evans, et al. (Tet. Asym. 1993, 4, 2319-2322).<br>
Reaction of D-mannitol with BnOCH2CH-(OCH3)2 in the presence of SnCl2 in 1,2-dimethoxyethane followed by<br>
RuCla/NaOCl oxidation gave cis- and trans-dioxolane-4-carboxylic acid, which was then converted to D- and Ldioxolane<br>
nucleosides by decarboxylation, coupling and deprotection reactions. An alternative route to these<br>
carboxylic acids by reaction of BnOCH2CH(OCH3)2 with L-ascorbic acid was also reported in the paper. The<br>
chiral carboxylic acid can also be prepared by reacting commercially available 2,2-dimethyl-l,3-dioxolane-4-(S)-<br>
carboxylic acid with a protected derivative of hydroxy-acetaldehyde such as benzoyloxyacetaldehyde, under<br>
acidic conditions (see U.S. Patent Nos. 5,922,867 and 6,358,963).<br>
Siddiqui, et al., discloses that cis-2,6-diaminopurine dioxolane can be selectively deaminated using adenosine<br>
deaminase (Siddiqui, et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let., 1993, 3 (8), 1543-1546).<br>
While the synthesis of dioxolane nucleosides is possible using processes described in the literature, the chemistry<br>
is not applicable to the synthesis of (-)-DAPD on large scale. See Chu, et al. Tet. Let. 1991, 32, 3'791-3794:<br>
Siddiqui, et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Let. 1993, 3. 1543-1546; Kim, et al. Tet. Let. 1992, 46, 6899-6902)<br>
US 5,763,606 to Mansour et al. describes processes for producing predominately pure 1,3-oxathiolane and 1.3-<br>
dioxolane nucleosides via coupling of a silylated purine or pyrimidine base with a bicyclic intermediate (see also<br>
WO 94/29301).<br>
US 6,215,004 to Painter et al. discloses process for preparing 2-[R'C(O)OCH2]-l,3-dioxolanyl-5-one by reacting<br>
glycolic acid with an acetal of the formula (R'O):CHR; a hemiacetal of the formula (R20)(HO)CHR; or a mixture<br>
thereof, wherein R is -(CH2-O-C(0)R'), and R1 and R2 are independently alkyl, aryl. heteroaryl, he:erocychc.<br>
alkaryl, alkylheteroaryl. or alkylheterocyclic, or aralkyl, in the presence of a Lewis acid, such as boron :rifluonde<br>
diethyl etherate (see also WO 00/09494).<br>
WO 00/47759 and WO 01/58894 both to BioChem Pharma disclose processes of separating 0 and a anomers<br>
from an anomeric mixture of dioxolane analogs with a COOR moiety at the C4' position prior to coupljig with a<br>
purine or pyrimidine base. The process for resolving the dioxolane analogues to obtain dioxolanes having a<br>
predominant p-L-configuration, involves the use of enzymes, namely hydrolases.<br>
WO 03/062229 to Shire BioChem Inc. discloses a single reaction vessel process for producing a dioxolane<br>
nucleoside analogue by adding a Lewis acid, a silylating agent and a non-silylated purine or pyrimidine base to a<br>
dioxolane. The publication also describes a process for producing a dioxolane compound by reacting a dioxolane<br>
compound in a solvent in the presence of DIB and 12, using a suitable source of energy.<br>
The stereochemistry of 3'-oxa-substituted 2',3'-dideoxynucleoside analogues ("dioxolane nucleoside analogues'")<br>
can play an important role in their biological activity. The Cl' position of the ribose in the nucleoside is a chiral<br>
center because the carbon is attached to four different moieties. Likewise, there is an optically active center at C4'<br>
of the nucleoside.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
As shown below, the substituents on the chiral carbons (the specified purine or pyrimidine base and CH2OH) of<br>
1,3-dioxolane nucleosides can be either cis (on the same side) or trans (on opposite sides) with respect to the<br>
tRoxolane ring system. For the purpose of consistency, the same stereochemical designation is used when the<br>
methyloxy moiety or the base moiety is replaced with another substituent group. Both the cis and trans racemates<br>
consist of a pair of optical isomers. Hence, each compound has four individual optical isomers. The four optical<br>
isomers are represented by the following configurations (when orienting the dioxolane moiety in a horizontal<br>
plane such that the -O-CH2- moiety is in front): (1) cis, with both groups "up", which is a fi-cis configuration<br>
(referred to as P-D); (2) cis, with both groups "down", which is the opposite fi-cis configuration (referred to as PL);<br>
(3) trans with the C4' substituent "up" and the Cl' substituent "down"; and (4) trans with the C4' substituent<br>
"down" and the Cl' substituent "up". The two cis enantiomers together are referred to as a racemic mixture of penantiomers,<br>
and the two trans enantiomers are referred to as a racemic mixture of a-enantiomers. In general, it is<br>
difficult to separate or otherwise obtain the individual enantiomers of the m-configuration. The four possible<br>
stereoisomers of cis-1,3-dioxolane nucleosides are illustrated below:<br>
Trans(a)<br>
Since stereoisomers of dioxolane nucleosides usually have different biological activities and toxicity, obtaining<br>
the pure therapeutically active isomer becomes crucial. Frequently, one stereoisomer is considerably more active<br>
than the other.<br>
Chu et al. developed methods for the asymmetric synthesis of dioxolane nucleosides from D-mannose and Lgulonic<br>
lactone for D- and L-dioxolane nucleosides, respectively (U.S. Patent Nos. 5,767,122, 5,792,773).<br>
However, these processes involved many steps and most of the intermediates need to be purified by silica gel<br>
column chromatography (see Kim et al. J. Med. Chem. 1993, 36, 519-528).<br>
To prepare a sufficiently large quantity of dioxolane nucleoside drug substance for clinic trials, a chiral 2-<br>
acyloxymethyl-5-oxo-l,3-dioxolane has been used as the key intermediate. This was prepared by cyclization of<br>
ROCH2CHO or its acetal with glycolic acid in the presence of BF3, followed by column separation on chiral resin<br>
or by enzymatic resolution, which are expensive and difficult techniques.<br>
Thus, there remains a need for cost-effective and stereoselective processes to produce biologically active isomers<br>
of dioxolane nucleosides.<br>
is an object of the present invention to provide novel and cost-effective processes for the synthesis of<br>
enantiomerically pure dioxolane nucleosides.<br>

In one embodiment of the invention, the 1,3-dioxolane lactone of the formula (II) is the .yec-butanoate<br>
ester (Compound 13).<br>
hi one embodiment of the present invention, if a (S)-enantiomer of the butyrate ester lactone (Compound<br>
1 of the structure below) is desired,<br>
Compound 1<br>
PPL is used for the chiral resolution. As described in the examples, PPL was identified as the most<br>
selective enzyme (22% yield, 98% ee), and was found to leave the (5)-butyrate ester isomer in a full commercial<br>
enzyme screen of all available commercial enzymes and 200 microbial enzymes.<br>
Although in general embodiments, any effective enzyme can be used, Lipase PS, immobilized lipase<br>
Pseudomonas and Lipase M were identified as selective enzymes that left the (R)-butyrate ester isomer, as<br>
described in the examples. Lipase PS was found to be an efficient enzyme that possessed the required enantiopreference,<br>
giving 22% yield of 95% ee (/?)-Compound 1. Therefore, in one alternative embodiment of the<br>
present invention, if a (R)-enantiomer is desired, then Lipase PS, Immobilised lipase Pseudomonas or Lipase M is<br>
used for the chiral resolution. In one particular embodiment, the enzyme is Lipase PS.<br>
Although the invention is not bound to particular conditions for resolution, in one embodiment, the<br>
temperature for resolution is about 0°C. In another embodiment, the temperature is between -5 °C and 10°C, or -<br>
2°C and +5°C or about -1°C to about 1°C. In another embodiment, the amount of substrate is about lOOg/L. The<br>
amount of substrate can vary, for example from 5 to 500, 20 to 200, 50 to 150, about 60, 70, 80, 90. 100, 110,<br>
120, 130, 140, or more g/L of buffer or g/L of total reaction volume. In one embodiment, the buffer is 1:1 toluene<br>
buffer, which can be at about pH 6. In a specific embodiment, the conditions for resolution can be 0°C, lOOg L<br>
substrate in 1:1 toluene pH 6 buffer. As described in the examples, these conditions yield 22%, 95% ee (/?)-<br>
Compound 1 (E=5.3). The conditions can also vary slightly within experimental parameters for efficient<br>
resolution.<br>
Microbial strains that resolve the compounds can vary. In one embodiment, the strains are from a species<br>
of Acimtobacter. The microbial screen identified 2 strains (Acinetobacter and Acinetobacier junii) \vhich gave<br>
the C/?)-butyrate in 80% ee. All available commercial enzymes and 200 microbial enzymes were screened in order<br>
to identify an efficient resolution of the butyrate ester. The microbial screen revealed 2 promising strains (CMC<br>
3419, Acinetobacter and CMC 3606. Acinetobacter junii) which gave (/?)-butyrate in 80% ee.<br>
In one embodiment, when resolution of the butyrate ester acetate (Compound 3) of the structure below:<br>
Compound 3<br>
is desired, the enzyme used is Lipase PS. A full commercial enzyme screen of Compound 3 revealed that<br>
the majority of selective enzymes resolve at the acetate and not the required butyrate centre. However Lipase PS,<br>
Lipase MY and Lipase AY possessed moderate selectivity, leaving the (R)-ester isomers. These enzymes were of<br>
similar selectivity to those for Compound 1. Further investigation, revealed Lipase PS to be the most selective<br>
(effective E=3.7). Similarly, this is of comparable selectivity to the resolution of Compound 1 with Lipase PS.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the resolution step occurs at an earlier stage of the synthesis, i.e. the<br>
lactone stage.<br>
In one embodiment, when resolution of the (S)-enantiomer of p-methoxy-benzoyl lactone, 4-oxo-<br>
[l,3]dioxolan-2-ylmethyl 4'-methoxybenzoate (Compound 11).<br>
Compound 11<br>
is desired, then Chirazyme-L2 is used for the resolution of the lactone. A wide range of commercial and<br>
microbial enzymes were screened in order to identify an efficient resolution of Compound 11. Chirazyme-L2 was<br>
identified as the most selective enzyme giving residual ester in 39% yield, &gt;98% ee of the (S)-enantiomer.<br>
In another embodiment, when the resolution of the benzoyl lactone, 4-oxo-[l,3]dioxolan-2-ylmethyl<br>
benzoate (Compound 12).<br>
Compound 12<br>
is desired, the enzyme used can be Chirazyme-L2. A commercial enzyme screen (ten enz\Tnes) was<br>
undertaken for the benzoyl lactone (Compound 12). Chirazyme-L2 and Acid Protease-DS were identified as<br>
potential resolving agents in the screen. Chirazyme-L2 gave comparable selectivity for the resolutions of<br>
Compounds 11 and 12. A limited commercial enzyme screen for Compound 12 found that Chirazyme-L2 was<br>
again the most efficient enzyme.<br>
In another embodiment, when the resolution of yhe (7?,)-enantiomer of iso-butryl lactor.e, 4-oxo-<br>
[l,3]dioxolan-2-yl-methyl-2'-methylpropanoate (Compound 13).<br>
Compound 13<br>
is desired, the enzyme used can be Chirazyme-L2. A complete commercial and microbial enzyme screen<br>
was performed for Compound 13. Chirazyme-L2 was again identified as the most selective enzjme. The<br>
configuration was determined to be the (7^-enantiomer by chemical correlation. Initial studies in MTBE-buffer<br>
gave the residual ester in 28% yield, 92% ee.<br>
A full commercial enzyme screen for Compound 13 revealed that Chirazyme-L2, Lipase PS, Acid<br>
Protease DS and Chirazyme-L9 possessed moderate selectivity, leaving the (R)-enantiomer as the residual ester.<br>
A full microbial screen identified strains that were selective for either enantiomer. One microbe, CMC 103869,<br>
gave 95% ee lactone by running the resolution at 10°C.<br>
In one embodiment, Compound 13 (iso-butryl lactone) was the substrate. In another embodiment, the<br>
substrate is one that affords simpler downstream chemistry, for example, simpler purification techniques.<br>
Chirazyme-L2 can be the enzyme used for resolution. In one embodiment, Chirazyme-L2 can give the (R)-<br>
configuration of residual ester.<br>
The reaction was studied in MTBE-buffer, toluene-buffer and 2-propanol-water systems. Stability and<br>
selectivity problems were encountered with the MTBE and toluene systems. However the results in 2-propanolwater<br>
were excellent, giving a 38% yield of 94% ee Compound 13 from a 30 g input of racemate.<br>
Therefore, in one embodiment, the resolution is performed in 2-propanol-water.<br>
An optimization study was undertaken. The process was improved by employing a monophasic alcoholwater<br>
system as solvent and using Kugelrohr distillation to purify the product. Therefore, in one embodiment, the<br>
process involves a monophasic alcohol-water system and distillation.<br>
The bioresolution of compound 13 with Chirazyme-L2 was scaled up to 30 g at 200 gL ' in 2-<br>
propanol:water (9:1) and gave 4-oxo-[l,3]dioxolan-2-yl-methyl-2'-methyl-propanoate in 38% yield, 94% ee and<br>
90% chemical purity. See Scheme 8.<br>

In contrast, the t-butyl-diphenyl silyl ether lactone (Compound 4) of the structure below:<br>
Compound 4<br>
was determined as a true racemate. The phase diagram for this compound was constructed which revealed the<br>
eutectic to be at 77.5% ee.<br>
Racemic cis-DAPD was screened with several enzymes known for their acylation activity in the presence<br>
of vinyl butyrate, but they were found to give non-stereoselective reactions. PeptiCLEC-BL and Lipase AY gave<br>
fast reactions to the desired racemic butyrate and thus may be useful to regioselectively and mildly put an ester on<br>
the oxygen. In one embodiment, PeptiCLEC-BL is used. In a separate embodiment, Lipase AY is used.<br>

Retailed Description of Process Steps<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Scheme 9<br>
Initially a 2,2-dialkoxy-ethanol (1) was esterified with the corresponding acid chloride in quantitative<br>
yields. In the case of the wo-butyryl (2a) ester, cyclization to the corresponding dioxolane lactone (3a), was<br>
affected with glycolic acid in the presence of a Lewis acid (BF3 Et2O) in 80% yield. However, under the same<br>
conditions, the p-methoxy benzoate ester (2b) afforded the corresponding lactone in low yield and purity. Much<br>
better results were achieved in a two step procedure in which the acetal was first hydrolyzed to the corresponding<br>
aldehyde (2c), which then was subjected to similar cyclization conditions, affording the corresponding lactone<br>
(3b) in 80% yield as a solid. The lactones were resolved by chiral chromatography13. Selective reduction of the<br>
chiral lactones (4a and 4b) with LiAlH(OtBu)3 and subsequent treatment with acetic anhydride afforded the<br>
corresponding acetates (5a and 5b) in reasonable yields, after purification by flash column chromatography.<br>
Coupling with 2,6-dichloropurine under Vobruggen conditions afforded crude<br>
mixtures of <p anomers of the corresponding nucleosides and wo-butyrate ester was first></p>
jkirified by column chromatography and then crystallized from MeOH to afford the pure P anomer (7a) in a 24%<br>
yield. The p-methoxy benzoate ester nucleoside did not require chromatography, and was purified by<br>
crystallization from MeOH to afford pure P anomer (7b) in 46% yield. The chlorines were replaced with amino<br>
groups in a two-step procedure by treatment with sodium azide and then hydrogenation. The corresponding<br>
intermediates (9a and 9b) were isolated and fully described. Removal of the protecting groups was achieved with<br>
n-butylamine in refluxing MeOH to afford (-)-DAPD (10) in 93% and 90% yield respectively.<br>
The total overall yields from the corresponding chiral lactones (5a and 5b) were: 11.4% for the isobutyrate<br>
and 22.2 % for the p-methoxy benzoate.<br>

Determination of the Enantioselectivity Constant<br>
The enantioselectivity of a simple hydrolysis reaction may be characterized by the E value (C.S Chen, C.J. Sih, Y.<br>
Fujimoto and G. Girdaukus, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 1982, 104, 7294). This numerically represents the ratio of the<br>
specificity constants of the catalyst for the two enantiomers. The E value allows direct comparison of catalyst<br>
selectivity, even if the reactions have gone to different conversions.<br>
To calculate the E value, the extent of conversion and the optical purity of the remaining starting material and/or<br>
the hydrolysis product are needed. If both ees and eep are known, one can calculate conversion (c) using Equation<br>
1. If only ees or eep is known, c determined at the termination of the hydrolysis can be used to calculate E<br>
(Equation 2).<br>

Enzymatic screening for Compound 1<br>
Upases: To each scintillation vial was added 50 |iL Compound 1, MTBE (5 mL) and 50 mM KH:PO4,<br>
pH 7 (5 mL), followed by 25 mg enzyme. The vials were shaken in an incubator set at 30°C. Aliquots were<br>
removed periodically and assayed by TLC (50% EtOAc/heptane) and chiral GC.<br>
Proteases and esterases: As above, except the reaction solvent was 5 mL, 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 7 or 8<br>
with no MTBE. Acid protease reactions were performed at pH 3 using 0.1 M lactic acid solution [pepsin, Acid<br>
protease A (Newlase A), and Acid protease II (Newlase II)].<br>
In some cases 25 mg, 50% \vt. of enzyme gave extremely fast reactions and so 100% conversion was<br>
reached before meaningful assays could be performed. In these cases the reactions were performed again with the<br>
appropriate amount of enzyme to give a reasonable rate of reaction (usually 5% wt.). Enzymes that required<br>
smaller loadings were Chirazyme-L2, -El and -E2, all the CLECs, Choline esterase, Candida esterase (Altus),<br>
PPL, Lipase PS and Lipase AK.<br>
Two sets of conditions were used for the screen of racemic Compound 1, depending upon whether the<br>
enzyme used was a lipase or a protease/esterase. For lipase-catalyzed hydrolyses, the reaction solvent was 1:1<br>
MTBE:50 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7. For protease and esterase-catalyzed hydrolyses, reactions were<br>
carried out in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7 or 8 (or pH 3 for acid proteases) with no immiscible<br>
organic co-solvent. Reactions were carried out in a shaker bath at 30°C and followed by TLC, with ees values<br>
determined by GC analysis (Chirasil Dex-CB column).<br>
The alcohol product from hydrolysis of the butyrate ester appears to be unstable since several new spots<br>
on TLC were produced during the reactions. Thus with no chiral assay for the product possible, approximate<br>
conversions were estimated from the TLC analysis.<br>
The results from the screens are shown in the tables below. Table 1 shows the enzymes that selectively<br>
left peak 1 in the butyrate chiral assay, while Table 2 shows the enzymes that selectively left peak 2 in the<br>
butyrate chiral assay. It is noteworthy that there appeared to be a very large number of enzymes that give nonstereoselective<br>
hydrolysis of Compound 1, which indicated that the substrate is unstable under the reaction<br>
conditions. When a control reaction was performed containing no enzyme, hydrolysis still occurred. Further<br>
investigation of the stability of the substrate is described herein.<br>

Scale-up of PPL Resolution of Compound 1<br>
In order to determine which was the (/?)-isomer, a quantity of resolved Compound 1 was resolved using<br>
the most promising enzyme from the screen set forth supra, and taken through the synthetic sequence to an<br>
intermediate where the isomer elution order by chiral assay was known. The most promising enzyme from the<br>
screen was PPL (porcine pancreatic lipase, Sigma), thus this reaction was scaled up to 50g racemic substrate input<br>
(Scheme 10).<br>

49.75g 9.55g, 98% ee<br>

Scheme 10: Large scale PPL resolution of Compound 1<br>
Minimal optimization of the reaction conditions was performed, apart from increasing the substrate concentration<br>
to 50 g/L (a reaction on 5 g substrate was successfully run as a trial). The 50 g reaction was initiated with 5% wt<br>
PPL at 30°C and 3 M NaOH added as the reaction proceeded in an attempt to maintain the pH at 7. However the<br>
reaction was extremely fast and after 25 minutes was cooled to 15°C and the pH maintained at pH 6.<br>
In particular, to a 2L jacketed vessel at 30°C was added MTBE (500 mL), 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 7 (500<br>
mL) and racemic Compound 1 (49.75 g, 0.265 mol, TP-0257/98/D). To the stirred mixture (pH 7) was added<br>
PPL (2.5 g, 5 wt%), then 3M NaOH was added to maintain the pH at pH 6. Due to the speed of the reaction, after<br>
25 min the vessel was cooled to 15 °C and the reaction run at this temperature. The ees was measured at time<br>
intervals by removing aliquots of MTBE, diluting with more MTBE, drying (MgSO4), and analyzing by chiral<br>
GC. After Ih 10 min the ees had reached 98% and the reaction was worked-up. The mixture was filtered through<br>
celite and the celite washed with MTBE (200 mL). The mixture was allowed to separate and the organic layer<br>
retained. The aqueous was then re-extracted with MTBE (500 mL). The MTBE extractions were combined,<br>
dried (MgSO4) and evaporated in vacua to give 22 g of a crude yellow oil. The crude product was purified by<br>
silica flash column chromatography (20% EtOAc:80% heptane) to give 9.55 g (5)-Compound 1 as a very pale<br>
yellow oil, 98% ee, 95% pure by GC-MS. A further 1.5 g of less pure material was also obtained. Combined<br>
yield was 22%.<br>

The ees was measured at time intervals (peak 2 in ee assay).<br>
(Table Removed)The reaction was worked up after Ih 10 min and the isolated resolved Compound 1 purified by silica<br>
column chromatography. This yielded 9.55g, 95% pure, 98% ee ester, along with 1.5g of less pure ester (22%<br>
overall yield). The impurity in the main batch of ester (9.55g) was butyric acid. This material was taken through<br>
the synthetic sequence to an intermediate where the isomer elution order by chiral assay was known, and was<br>
determined to be (^-Compound 1. To obtain the (/?)-isomer. an enzyme that selectively left peak 1 in the<br>
Compound 1 chiral assay was needed.<br>
Example 15<br>
Optimization of Commercial Enzyme Resolutions giving (R)-Compound 1<br>
As can be seen from Table 1, the initial screen had shown SAWA immobilized lipase, Lipase M, Lipase<br>
PS and Fl Biocon. lipase to be potential candidates to efficiently give (/?)-Compound 1. The resolutions were<br>
scaled up to determine their selectivities (Fl Biocon. lipase is no longer commercially available).<br>
The enzyme was added to 2-5 g of ester in 15-20 mL each of solvent and buffer (0.2 N KH2PO4). Sodium<br>
hydroxide solution was added to control the pH. The work-up procedure was to filter (Celite), extract (MTBE),<br>
wash with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate, dry (MgSO4) and concentrate. Analysis was by chiral GC<br>
(Chirasil Dex CB). The variables studied were enzyme, solvent, pH and temperature (see Table 4).<br>
Initial trials with Lipase PS, Lipase M and SAWA immobilized Pseudomonas lipase in pH 7 phosphate<br>
buffer gave the remaining substrate with enantiomeric excesses of 90%, but the recovery of (/?)-Compound 1 was<br>
low (5%). The stability of the butyrate was investigated at pH 7 and pH 6 under standard reaction conditions but<br>
without enzyme present (entries 20 and 21). At pH 7 significant base was consumed to maintain pH and after<br>
work-up and isolation only 50% of (1) was recovered after 3.5 h. Stability is significantly better at pH 6.<br>
Possibly, the mode of breakdown is opening of the lactone-acetal to give an aldehyde and glycolic acid (Scheme<br>
H).<br>

(Table Removed)Table 4: Optimization of resolution of Compound 1<br>
Two other controls showed that starting ester of 98% ee is not racemized by the reaction conditions at pH<br>
6 or pH 7. A further test reaction showed that after 24 hours at pH 6, 100 g/L substrate in 2:1 toluene: 1 M buffer<br>
and 0 °C, greater than 90% yield of starting material was recovered with no loss of enantiomeric excess. Thus<br>
racemization and substrate stability under these reaction conditions is not a problem.<br>
With these results in mind, all further enzyme reactions were performed at pH 6. The best results from<br>
the study are shown in entries 7, 8, 9 and 13. The most promising enzyme resolution was with Lipase PS in<br>
toluene/pH 6 buffer giving an E value of 4.3. This would give a yield of 17% at 95% ee. Resolution with Lipase<br>
PS was investigated further in the Examples herein. Variables studied for optimization were concentration,<br>
solventrbuffer volume ratio, enzyme loading, additives and temperature.<br>
The optimal conditions were determined as 0°C, 100 g/L substrate in 1:1 toluene: potassium phosphate<br>
buffer (pH 6) which gives 95% ee, 22% yield of (fl)-Compound 1. At 200 g/L substrate concentration, 95% ee<br>
(^)-Compound 1 was obtained in 17% yield.<br>
Example 16<br>
Microbial Enzyme Screen<br>
From a screen of around 200 strains (using the new 96-well plate method), 7 positives were identified<br>
which left the (R)-isomer of Compound 1 (peak 1). These were classified as positive in so far as they hydrolyzed<br>
the ester and gave &gt;10% ee of remaining substrate, thus having potential for generating high ee ester.<br>
The screen was performed in 0.1M Na2HPO4^SraH2PO4) pH 6.0 with 20 g/1 ester at 25°C for<br>
mpproximately 16 h. The results are depicted in Figures 5A and SB.<br>
The seven positive strains (peak 1) from the primary screen were grown up in TSB (tryptone soya broth)<br>
flasks and the cell pastes harvested. These were re-suspended at 10% w/v in 0.1 M Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 6.0 +<br>
20 g/L ester and shaken in scintillation vials (at 1.0 mL per vial) for up to 92 hours at 25°C. The results are<br>
shown in Table 5.<br>
(Table Removed)The results from the control show that the ester is not stable over 24 hours at 25°C. There is a 97%<br>
decrease in peak area size between the peak areas at 17 and 92 hours. This clearly explains why all the samples<br>
peak areas show a dramatic drop. Of the strains re-screened, CMC 3606 (Acinetobacter junii) and CMC 3419<br>
(Acinetobacter) showed good enantioselectivity (80% ee for peak one). These two strains were re-grown [CMC<br>
3606 in flasks (as it was originally an unidentified bacteria) and CMC 3419 in fermentation vessels] ready for<br>
further evaluation. For CMC 3322 (P. alcaligenes) there was no detectable ester after 17 hours. This may be due<br>
to a shift in pH (with the cells lysing) or from a high esterase activity.<br>

of 1:1.4 respectively. See Figure IB. Comparison of the four chiral GC ee/de assay peaks and GC-MS peaks<br>
indicated that peaks 1 and 2 were enantiomers and peaks 3 and 4 were enantiomers in the ee/de assay.<br>
Enzyme Screen, Compound 3<br>
Upases: To each scintillation vial was added 50 jiL Compound 3 (TP-0259/98/A), MTBE (5 mL) and 50<br>
AnM KH2PO4, pH 7 (5 mL), followed by 20 mg enzyme. The vials were shaken in an incubator set at 30°C, with<br>
^tn'quots removed periodically and assayed by TLC (50% EtOAc/heptane) and chiral GC.<br>
Proteases and ester uses: As above, except the reaction solvent was 5 mL, 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 7 or 8<br>
with no MTBE. Acid protease reactions were performed at pH 3 using 0.1 M lactic acid solution [pepsin, Acid<br>
protease A (Newlase A), and Acid protease II (Newlase II)].<br>
For some enzymes that were known to be very active for these substrates, the reactions were performed<br>
with an appropriate amount of enzyme to give a reasonable rate of reaction, usually 10-15 wt%. Enzymes that<br>
required these reduced loadings were Chirazyme-L2, -El and -E2, all the CLECs, Choline esterase and Candida<br>
esterase (Altus).<br>
Racemic Compound 3 was screened for enzymatic hydrolysis with commercially available lipases,<br>
proteases and esterases. All lipase reactions were carried out in the presence of 50 uL Compound 3, 5 mL MTBE,<br>
5 mL pH 7 phosphate buffer and 50% wt. enzyme (except Chirazyme-El, Chirazyme-E2, Chirazyme-L2, Candida<br>
Esterase, Choline esterase and CLECs, 10% wt.). Esterase and protease reactions were performed without MTBE<br>
present. The reactions were followed by TLC and chiral GC.<br>
The stereochemistry at the acetate centre is not as important since it is set later in the synthesis of the bulk<br>
active DAPD. Thus it is desirable to resolve with respect to the butyrate centre. However, initially it was<br>
unknown which peak corresponded to which isomer. Control reactions, containing no enzyme, showed that the<br>
substrate was stable under the reaction conditions. The results from the screen for resolution of Compound 3 are<br>
shown in Tables 6-11.<br>
(Table Removed)These results show that Peptidase R, Protease M and Acid Protease A (Newlase A) have excellent<br>
selectivity for peaks 1 and 3; whilst Protease B, Chirazyme-L2, and Protease A have reasonable selectivity for<br>
peaks 1 and 3.<br>
(Table Removed)These results show that Lipase PS is reasonably selective for peak 2.<br>
No reaction was observed with a-Chymotrypsin, Lipase GC, Lipase PGE, Lipase N cone, Lipase G,<br>
Lipase R, Lipase M, Lipase A "Amano" 12, Lipase AU miles 1988, Lipase Fl Biocon., Wheat Germ Lipase.<br>
Papain W-40, Protease S, Protease X and Pepsin.<br>
Enzymes that gave unselective hydrolysis were Acid Protease II (Newlase II), Bromelain F, Alcalase.<br>
Savinase, Esperase, ChiroCLEC-BL, Trypsin, ChiroCLEC-PC, SAWA immobilised Pseudomonas lipase and<br>
Lipase F. Candida Esterase from Altus gave a reaction that was too fast to collect any enantiomeric excess data.<br>
After this screen had been completed, a sample of resolved Compound 3 was prepared by reduction (Si-<br>
Compound 1 from a PPL resolution. This was run on the ee/de assay giving peaks 1 and 4. Since the PPL<br>
resolution gives (S&gt;Compound 1, peaks 2 and 3 were needed for the resolution of Compound 3. The results from<br>
the screen showed that the majority of enzymes resolved Compound 3 at the acetate centre, not the required<br>
butyrate centre. However Lipase AK, Lipase MY, Lipase AY and Lipase PS give the required peaks with<br>
reasonable selectivity.<br>
Resolutions of Compound 3 with Lipase PS and Lipase MY were investigated further (Lipase AK has<br>
been discontinued by Amano). Scale up and isolation of the product was need to determine if the resolutions<br>
were efficient (see Table 12). Lipase PS in toluene gave a 39% yield of recovered starting material with an<br>
effective ee of 58% and effective E of 3.7 (this gives a measure of the amount of correct (/?)-butyrate that is<br>
present in the mixture). These selectivities were no better than what was obtained for Compound 1 with Lipase<br>
PS, E=5.3. Further, since in one embodiment, the resolution step is earlier in the reaction sequence, the following<br>
examples concentrate on optimizing the resolution of Compound 1.<br>

Enzyme Screen for Compound 11<br>
Lipases: In a scintillation vial 40 uL Compound 11, MTBE (5 mL), 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 6 (5 mL), and<br>
10 mg enzyme were shaken in an incubator at 30C. Aliquots were removed periodically and assayed by TLC<br>
(50% EtOAc/heptane) and chiral HPLC.<br>
Proteases and esterases: as above, but without MTBE.<br>
Two sets of conditions were used for the screen of Compound 11, the racemic methoxybenzoate ester,<br>
depending upon whether the enzyme used was a lipase or a protease/esterase. For lipase-catalysed hydrolyses. the<br>
reaction solvent was 1:1 methyl terr-butyl ether (MTBE):50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6. For<br>
protease and esterase-catalysed hydrolyses, reactions were carried out in the phosphate buffer with no immiscible<br>
organic co-solvent. Reactions were carried out in scintillation vials in a shaker at 30°C and followed by thin layer<br>
chromatography (TLC). The enantiomeric excess of the residual substrate (ees values) was determined by HPLC<br>
analysis (Chiralpak AS). The alcohol product from hydrolysis of these esters was known to be unstable from the<br>
Example above. Thus with no chiral assay for the product possible, conversions could not be calculated,<br>
Iso it was noted whether any substrate was still present by TLC analysis.<br>
The results from the screens are shown in the tables below. Table 13 shows the results for the enzymes<br>
that selectively left the enantiomer corresponding to peak 1 in the chiral HPLC assay, and Error! Reference source<br>

Scale-up of Chirazyme-L2 Resolution of Compound 11<br>
During the initial studies of the resolution of Compound 11, it was not known how the enantiomers<br>
correlate to the peaks in the chiral HPLC assay. In order to determine the absolute configuration, a sample was<br>
taken through the entire synthetic sequence to a DAPD intermediate where the configuration could be determined.<br>
One of the most promising enzymes from the screen was Chirazyme-L2; thus this reaction was scaled up in order<br>
to prepare a sample (Scheme 12). The substrate concentration was increased to 20 g/L and the enzyme loading<br>
reduced, but otherwise optimization of the process was minimal. With a 1 g input of racemate, 5 wt.%<br>
Chirazyme-L2 at 30°C with the pH maintained between 5 and 6, 0.32 Ig (32%) of ester was obtained in &gt;98% ee<br>
and good purity.<br>

Scheme 12: Scale-up of Compound 11 resolution<br>
The reaction was scaled-up further to 10 g; after 3.5 h, 3.9 g of Compound 11 was obtained in 39% y:eld.<br>
99% ee as a white solid. This was determined to be the undesired (^)-enantiomer. Consequently the des:red<br>
(/0-enantiomer must correspond to peak 2 in the chiral HPLC assay.<br>
Therefore, a 500 mL jacketed vessel at 30°C was charged with MTBE (250 mL), racemic Compound 11<br>
(10.00 g, 39.7 mmol, TP-43/100) and 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 6 (250 mL). Chirazyme-L2 (500 mg, 5 wt.%) was<br>
added to the mixture with stirring. The pH was maintained between pH 5 and 6 by addition of 2N NaOH. After<br>
3.5 hours, the base uptake had stopped, and the mixture filtered through Celite* and separated. The aqueous was<br>
extracted with MTBE (2 x 200 mL), the organic layers were combined, washed with 2N NaOH (200 mL), sodium<br>
sulfite (200 mL), 2N HC1 (200 mL) and dried (MgSO4). Concentration in vacua gave Compound 11 as a white<br>
solid. Yield 3.89 g, 39%; ee &gt;99%; 'H NMR (400MHz, CDC13) consistent with structure.<br>
Example 20<br>
Scale-up of Lipase PS Resolution of Compound 11<br>
From the initial screen, only Lipase PS was a candidate to give the desired (/J)-enantiomer of Compound<br>
11 (see Error! Reference source not found.). This resolution was scaled up to 2 g in order to determine its<br>
selectivity. At approximately 50% conversion the enantiomeric excess of residual ester was only 8%. The<br>
enzyme is clearly not sufficiently selective for a viable process.<br>
A 100 mL jacketed vessel at 30°C was charged with MTBE (25 mL), racemic Compound 11 (2.00 g, T.94<br>
mmol, TP-43/100) and 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 6 (25 mL). Lipase-PS (100 mg, 5 wt.%) was added to the mixture<br>
with stirring. The pH was maintained between pH 5 and 6 by addition of 2N NaOH. At approximately 50%<br>
conversion (by base uptake), an aliquot was taken and analysed to be 8% ee. After a further 24 hours no<br>
substrate was detected.<br>

Microbial Enzyme Screen<br>
General procedure for preparing 96 well culture plates.<br>
2.2 mL 96 deepwell plates were used. 1.0 mL sterile TSB (Tryptone soya broth, Oxoid CM129) for<br>
bacteria, or YM (Yeast mould broth, Oxoid CM920B) for yeasts, was added per vial and inoculated with a stock<br>
of culture. The plates were shaken at 25°C for &gt; 48 hours. The cell pellets were harvested by centrifugation<br>
(lOOOg for 10 minutes at 4°C) and the supernatant removed. The cell pellets were stored at -20°C until required<br>
for screening.<br>
Screening of 96 deepwell culture plates on Compound 11.<br>
A 200 g/L stock solution of Compound 11 was prepared in acetone. 450 uL 0.1M Tris-HCl + 0.1%<br>
Tween 80, pH 7.0 and 50 uL Compound 1 stock solution were added per well of the 96 deepwell culture plate.<br>
These plates were shaken at 25°C for &gt; 72 hours. Samples were extracted into MTBE and assayed by chiral<br>
HPLC.<br>
The screen was carried out against a range of bacteria and yeasts. These were grown up in 96 deep-well<br>
plates and their cell pellets harvested by centrifugation. This enables the pellets to be re-suspended in buffer with<br>
substrate for the screen. The plates were shaken at 25°C for &gt; 72 hours. Samples were extracted into MTBE and<br>
assayed by chiral HPLC. The results from the screen are summarized in Figure 3C. Several hits were identified<br>
as selective for leaving the enantiomer corresponding to peak 1 in the assay, however only a few strains gave the<br>
desired enantiomer (peak 2) at a low ee. This may be due to the low levels of enzyme expressed in the wild type<br>
micro-organisms, and hence low conversion. It must also be noted that the high throughput chiral HPLC method<br>
used can only give approximate values. The best results are collated in Table 15.<br>

The five strains that gave peak 2 selectively and three that gave peak 1 were selected for further trials to<br>

candidate for peak 2 from the primary screen, confirmed its selectivity at

Enzyme Screen.<br>
Compound 12 was screened against the 96 well culture plates. The screen for Compound 12 was based<br>
on that developed for Compound 11, but limited to only ten enzymes. Two sets of conditions were used,<br>
depending upon whether the enzyme was a lipase or a protease/esterase. For lipase-catalyzed hydrolyses, the<br>
reaction solvent was 1:1 MTBE:50 mM potassium phosphate buffer at pH 6. For protease and esterase-catalyzed<br>
hydrolyses, reactions were carried out in the phosphate buffer with no immiscible organic co-solvent. In all<br>
reactions the amount of substrate utilized was 40 mg. Reactions were carried out in a shaker bath at 30°C and<br>
enantiomeric excess values determined by HPLC analysis (Chiralpak AS). The three positive results are<br>
summarized in Table 17.<br>
(Table Removed)Substrate present<br>
The following enzymes gave less selective resolutions with Compound 2 (
Lipase PS; Lipase DS; Lipase AY; Lipase F; Acid Protease A; and Lipase N Cone.<br>
Samples were assayed by chiral HPLC; the results are summarized in Figure 3D. As can be seen from<br>
Figure 3D, microbial strains were identified that are selective for both enantiomers. The conversions, and<br>
therefore the true selectivities are unknown. While Chirazyme-L2 was identified as an excellent enzyme for<br>
leaving the enantiomer corresponding to peak 2 in the HPLC assay, no enzymes were identified in this limited<br>
screen that left peak 1. It is not known which peak in the chiral assay for Compound 2 corresponds to the<br>
required (/?)-enantiomer.<br>
Example 23<br>
Compound 13<br>
Chemical determination of configuration<br>
As an expedient way of determining which of the peaks in the GC chromatogram correspond to the<br>
desired enantiomer, it was envisioned that authentic samples could be made from the silyl ether. The<br>
enantiomerically enriched silyl ether was heated with 2-methylpropanoyl chloride in tetrahydrofuran (THF) with<br>
tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) (see Scheme 13).<br>

Scheme 13: Determination of configuration for Compound 13<br>
The goal was to cleave the silyl ether and trap the generated alcohol in situ with acid chloride. Although<br>
the intermediate alcohol is unstable, if only a small fraction reacts with acid chloride faster than decomposing.<br>
then ester of known configuration would be generated. Since the chiral assay is a GC method, the sensitivity is<br>
high and minute quantities can be detected. Starting from (/?)-silyl ether, peaks were observed in the GC<br>
chromatograms for the product, enhanced in peak 1 in both cases. Spiking the samples with racemate confirmed<br>
that the peaks corresponded to the desired esters. Slight losses in enantiomeric excess were observed in both<br>
cases, possibly due to the acidity of the medium and the potential instability of the parent alcohol that is assumed<br>
to be an intermediate. The absolute configuration of the starting silyl ether is known to be the desired (configuration. The enantiomer that gives peak 1 in the GC assay for the H-butanoate ester is also known to be the<br>
required enantiomer. Therefore, the reaction of the (/?)-silyl ether with 2-methylpropanoyl chloride will give the<br>
required enantiomer of Compound 13, and that this corresponds to peak 1 in the GC assay. Since the other<br>
enantiomer of the silyl ether was available, for extra confirmation it was also demonstrated to give the peak 2<br>
enantiomer in reaction with 2-methylpropanoyl chloride.<br>
Experimental - procedure for preparation of esters from enantiomerically silyl ether<br>
A mixture of 150 mg of silyl ether, 0.5 mL of acid chloride and 0.4 mL of TBAF (1M in THF), in 5 mL<br>
of THF, was heated to reflux under nitrogen for 3-4 hours. TLC showed a small amount of product formed. An<br>
aliquot was taken, passed through a plug of silica and analysed by chiral GC.<br>

Enzyme Screen<br>
Stability of the w-butanoate ester was determined to be significantly better at pH 6. Therefore for the<br>
screening of the sec-butanoate ester, Compound 13, similar conditions .were used. Racemic Compound 13 was<br>
screened for enzymatic hydrolysis with commercially available lipases, proteases and esterases. All hpase<br>
reactions were carried out in the presence of 40 uL Compound 13, 5 mL MTBE, 5 mL pH 6 phosphate buffer and<br>
20 wt.% enzyme. Esterase and protease reactions were performed without MTBE present. The mixtures '.vere<br>
shaken in an incubator at 30°C and monitored by TLC and Chiral GC. The alcohol product, like the other esters,<br>
is unstable as previously described. Therefore no chiral assay for the product was possible and conversions could<br>
not be calculated. For the screen it was noted whether any substrate was still present by TLC analysis. The best<br>
results from the screens are shown in Table 18 below.<br>

Chymotrypsin.<br>
From Table 19 it can be seen that all the enzymes selectively left peak 1 in the chiral GC assay,<br>
fortunately corresponding to the desired enantiomer. None of the enzymes screened were selective for peak 2.<br>
Four enzymes were chosen for re-screening with lower loadings, the results of which can be seen in Table . The<br>
most promising of these was Chirazyme-L2, leaving residual ester in 90% ee after 5.5 hours.<br>
(Table Removed)Scale-up of Cbirazvme-L2 Resolution of Compound 13.<br>
The Chirazyme-L2 resolution was scaled up to 1 g, 30 mg of enzyme and 25 mL each of pH 6 phosphate<br>
buffer and MTBE. After work-up the reaction yielded 0.212 g, 21% Th of Compound 13 as a colorless oil. The<br>
'H NMR spectrum showed a significant amount of impurities present, which had been carried through from the<br>
substrate.<br>
On a 6 g scale, using the same conditions, at 20°C the yield was 1.52 g, 25% Th of 88% ee resolved<br>
Compound 3 as a pale yellow oil. Again 'H NMR indicated some impurities were present. The selectivity was<br>
improved at a lower temperature, 0°C. Starting from 5.25 g of racemate, after 4.5 hours the resolution yielded<br>
1.48 g, 28% Th of 92% ee Compound 3. The configuration was confirmed as the required -enantiomer.<br>
Initially the bioresolution was performed at a moderate concentration, 20 g/L. To study the effect of<br>
increasing the volume efficiency, the resolution was repeated on a 1 g scale at 50 g/L, 0°C in pH 6 phosphate<br>
buffer and MTBE. After 4.5hrs, the biotransformation yielded 0.44 g, 44% Th, of material as a pale yellow oil in<br>
92% ee. From this it was concluded that the volume efficiency could be improved with no significant loss in<br>
selectivity.<br>
The purity of product obtained from these processes was low. Several impurities were carried through<br>
from the racemate. For a bioresolution of moderate selectivity the conversion optionally can be increased to gain<br>
high enantiomeric purity, of residual ester. One of the impurities, the 2-methylpropanoate ester of<br>
J^ydroxyacetaldehyde shown in Scheme 14, was present in the racemate. However it was not clear whether this<br>
was also produced in the bioresolution, as outlined below.<br>
Scheme 14: Formation of impurities<br>
In order to determine if any additional aldehyde was generated during the biotransformation. the<br>
resolution was repeated on the same scale (1 g) using distilled lactone, which contained no of aldehyde. This<br>
reaction yielded 0.29 g, 29%, of 93% ee product. The 'H NMR spectrum showed that the aldehyde was present;<br>
clearly this material is produced during the reaction or work up.<br>
Changing the solvent to toluene resulted in a slower, but more selective resolution. On a 1 g scale at, 50<br>
g/L, the reaction was worked-up after 22.5 hours to give 0.30 g, 30% yield of &gt;99°o ee ester. The concentration<br>
was further increased to 200 g/L, using 4 g of racemate. in 10 mL each of pH 6 phosphate buffer and toluene, at<br>
0°C. The process was highly volume efficient, and no problems were encountered. After 17 hours the<br>
biotransformation yielded 1.11 g, 28%. of 95° o ee product.<br>
Several reactions were performed on a slightly larger scale (2-10 g) utilizing differing enzyme loadings<br>
and reaction times; the results are summarized in Table 10 below. The rate of reaction was not entirely<br>
predictable. Several factors may be responsible for this, including different batches of racemate with different<br>
impurity profiles and differences in mixing of the biphasic solvent-immobilized enzyme system. The yields may<br>
be misleading due to impurities carried though from the racemate. It was found on this scale that thiosulfate,<br>
bicarbonate and acidic washes did not significantly reduce the amount of the aldehyde impurity. The work-up<br>
procedure required some clarification, but at this stage it was hoped that a combination of suitable wash and<br>
Kugelrohr distillation (wiped-film on scale) after resolution would be effective. This was investigated later on a<br>
larger scale. All these biotransformations used the toluene-buffer biphasic system at 200 g/L.<br>
(Table Removed)The process was scaled-up to 30 g using 10 wt.% enzyme at 0°C, 200 g/L. After a Kugelrohr distillation<br>
4.2 g of &gt;95% ee ester was recovered.<br>
As discussed earlier, the purity of the racemate is vital to the quality and yield obtainable after<br>
biotransformation. Moreover it is difficult to determine the true selectivity of a resolution with accurate<br>
conversion. This is unavailable from enantiomeric excess data since the product of the bioresolution cannot be<br>
isolated; the only information available is the enantiomeric excess of the residual substrate. An idea of selectivity<br>
is gained from the yield of the ester, but as it is contaminated with impurities, the accuracy is in doubt.<br>
When considering the final process it may be advantageous to use a crude racemate and purify after<br>
bioresolution, e.g. by wiped-film distillation. However, impurities may inhibit the enzyme. The possibility of<br>
one such process using very crude substrate was investigated; a mixture of racemate containing DME, water and<br>
other impurities, containing approximately 1 g of substrate was used in the bioresolution. During the<br>
biotransformation no base was consumed and so additional enzyme added. An aliquot was removed after 16<br>
hours and found to be racemic. These findings would suggest that the enzyme was being "killed" by the<br>
impurities present in this mixture. Thus, in one embodiment, purification of the substrate is preferable prior to<br>
bioresolution.<br>
Example 26<br>
Biotransformation in 2-Propanol-Water<br>
As mentioned earlier the stability of the substrate was a potential problem. A background process in<br>
which lactone is opened to glycolic acid and the 2-methylpropanoate ester of hydroxyacetaldehyde cannot be<br>
ruled out (Scheme 15).<br>
Q—V buffer | . M<br>
(Jrl<br>
Scheme 15: Ring-opening of lactone<br>
The mode of action of the enzyme on Compound 13 is also unknown. The only products detected after<br>
bioresolution are the 2-methylpropanoate ester of hydroxyacetaldehyde and gjycolic acid. However the usua.<br>
mode of action for a lipase is to hydrolyse the ester; this would give the lactone and 2-methylpropionic acid<br>
(Scheme 16). The lactone alcohol product is not detected and breaks down to glycolic acid and<br>
hydroxyacetaldehyde. If this mechanism is correct then the esterified aldehyde must come from reaction of<br>
hydroxyacetaldehyde with 2-methylpropionic acid. An alternative mechanism is that the enzyme may act directly<br>
to open the lactone without first cleaving the ester. This mode of action whereby a lactone ring is opened has<br>
been observed for liver esterases (see for example: E. Fouque and G. Rousseau Synthesis 1989, 661; and P.<br>
Barton and M. I. Page./. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 2,1993, 2317), but is perhaps unlikely in this case.<br>
Scheme 16: Possible reaction mechanism<br>
The use of additives in biotransformations has been widely reported to enhance selectivities, but their<br>
effects on enantiomeric excess are usually unpredictable. See for example: T. V. Hansen, V. Waagen, V. Partali,<br>
H. W. Anthonsen and T. Anthonsen, Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1995, 6, 499; G. Duan and J. Y. Chen,<br>
Biotechnology Letters 1994, 16, 1065; N. W. Boaz and R. L. Zimmerman, Tetrahedron Asymmetry 1994, 5, 153;<br>
and K. Faber, G Ottolina and S. Riva, Biocatalysis 1993, 8, 91. The mode of action is also often unclear; the<br>
additive may be acting as a phase transfer catalyst, as an enzyme modifier, or as an alternative to water as a<br>
nucleophile. In the resolution of (-)-2',3'-dideoxy-5-fluoro-3'-thiacytidine (FTC, also known as Coviracil™ and<br>
emtricitabine), it was found that alcohol:water mixtures were a good alternative to the normal biphasic or mainly<br>
aqueous systems. It was envisioned that this might also be effective in the resolution of Compound 13, both with<br>
respect to enzyme selectivity and substrate stability. This hypothesis was tested using 1 g of Compound 13, with<br>
3 wt.% enzyme, at 100 gL"1 in an 8:2 2-propanol: water solvent system. After 47 hours the reaction yielded 0.47<br>
g, 47%Th, of &gt;98% ee material.<br>
The initial result in 2-propanol-water looked excellent, although water and aldehyde may have bolstered<br>
the yield. More meaningful results were gained on a larger scale, with distillation to purify the product. The<br>
racemate was distilled using wipe film distillation. The conditions were 30 g of racemate in 9:1 2-propanol<br>
(IPA)-water, at 200 gL"1 with an enzyme loading of 5 wt.%. This reaction was filtered after 10 hours and reduced<br>
in vacua. The enantiomeric excess was determined to be 94%. This material was divided into two batches to<br>
investigate purification methods. The first portion was distilled using Kugelrohr apparatus at 133°C / 1.3 Torr tc<br>
give two required fractions:<br>
Fraction 1: 10.8 g contained 61% aldehyde, 31% Compound 3 and an undetermined amount of<br>
glycolic acid. Further distillation at 80°C/4-5 Torr to remove the aldehyde and a water wash gave 4.4 g of<br>
Compound 3 90% pure material containing 4% aldehyde.<br>
Fraction 2: 2.7 g contained no aldehyde but a significant amount of glycolic acid and Compound 3.<br>
After a water wash, 1.8 g of Compound 3 was obtained, 91% pure (by GC).<br>
The second portion of crude material was given a water wash prior to distillation at 140°C / 1.6 Torr<br>
followed by removal of the aldehyde at 60°C / 1.6 Torr, yielding 5.2 g of material in 89% purity, containing 6%<br>
aldehyde.<br>
Therefore in total 11.4 g of the 2-methylpropanoate ester was produced in 90% purity, 94% ee,<br>
corresponding to an excellent 38% overall yield. This procedure clearly out-performs that with toluene:buffer and<br>
with further optimization could provide an efficient route to the optically pure lactone.<br>

Experimental - Resolution of 30g of Compound 13 with Chirazyme-L2 in 2-propanol:water<br>

Compound 13 (30 g, DB/1005/85/1). The mixture was stirred and Chirazyme-L2 (1.5 g, 5 wt.%), added to this<br>

(MgSO4), and analysing by chiral GC. After lOh, the ees was 93%. Shortly after the mixture was filtered through<br>
Celite* and concentrated in vacua to give 32.1 g of crude Compound 3 as a pale yellow oil. The oil was<br>
then dissolved in toluene and concentrated (2 x 250 mL) to remove any water azeotropically. Crude yield 29.4 g,<br>
98%; ee 94%.<br>
This oil was divided into two portions. The first was distilled using Kugelrohr apparatus at 133°C ' 1.3<br>
Torr, which gave three fractions overall. Fraction 1 (most volatile) contained 10.8 g of 61% aldehyde. 31%<br>
lactone and 8% of other impurities. Fraction 2 contained 2.7 g of lactone contaminated with a significant amount<br>
of glycolic acid and fraction 3 contained yellow low volatility impurities. Fraction 2 was dissolved in toluene<br>
(200 mL), washed with water (200 mL), dried (MgS04) and concentrated in vacua to give 1.8 g of Compound 13<br>
as a colourless oil in 91% purity by GC (no aldehyde observed). Most of the aldehyde in fraction 1 was then<br>
removed by Kugelrohr distillation at 30°C / 4-5 Torr to give, as the residue, 6.1 g of lactone containing -12%<br>
aldehyde and an undetermined amount of glycolic acid. This material was then dissolved in toluene (200 mL),<br>
washed with water (200 mL), dried (MgSO4) and concentrated in vacua to give 4.4 g of Compound 3 as a<br>
colourless oil in 90% purity, 4% aldehyde by GC.<br>
The second portion of material was dissolved in toluene (200 mL), washed with water (200 mL). dried<br>
(MgSO4) and concentrated in vacua. The resulting oil was then distilled using Kugelrohr apparatus at 14C °C /<br>
1.6 Torr, to remove low volatility impurities, and then further distilled at 60°C / 1.3 Torr to remove any residual<br>
aldehyde. The material recovered fron this distillation was determined to be 5.15 g of 89% purity, 6% aldehyde<br>
by GC.<br>
Overall yield: 11.4 g. 38%; GC Punty: 90°o<br>

Microbial enzyme screen.<br>
As for Compounds 11 and 12. Compound 13 was screened against 96 well culture plates. Samples were<br>
assayed by chiral GC; it must be noted that the high through put chiral GC method used can only give<br>
approximate values. The results of the screen are represented in Figure 3E.<br>
A large number of strains showed activity on Compound 13, with selectivities for both peaks 1 and 2<br>
observed in the GC chromatograms. Those that gave an enantiomeric excess &gt; 40% ee are shown in Table 21.<br>
(Table Removed)Example 29<br>
Scale-up of biotransformations for CMC 103869 &amp; 103661.<br>
From the screen, two strains were selected for scale-up. These were CMC 103869 (Unidentified) and<br>
CMC 103661 (S. cerevisiae). Cultures of both were grown up and their harvested cell pastes stored at -20°C.<br>
Biotransformations were set-up at 30 mL scale, using both pH and temperature control. Initial biotransformations<br>
were in 0.1M Tris-HCl, pH 7. Poor enantiomeric excesses and substrate stability were observed, possibly due to<br>
the high pH. Lowering the pH to 6 partially increased selectivity, but there were still substrate stability problems.<br>
A change in buffer to 50 mM KH2PO4. pH 6, further increased the enantiomeric excess. The results for both<br>
strains are summarized in Figure 4. Resolution of Compound 13 with CMC 103869 gave residual ester of 70%<br>
ee. The results with CMC 103361 were disappointing and therefore further studies with this strain were<br>
abandoned. For all the biotransformations a loss of residual substrate was observed, possibly due either to a<br>
second enzyme or poor substrate stability at 25°C. Finally by reducing the temperature to 10°C the selectivity<br>
increased to &gt;95% ee, however there was still a total loss of substrate over time. The conversion and hence<br>
absolute selectivity is not known.<br>
CMC 103869 was grown up in TSB media and CMC 103661 was grown up in YM media in flasks. Both<br>
strains were grown at 25°C and cells harvested by centrifugation (2000g for 20 minutes at 4°C). Cell pastes were<br>
stored at -20°C. Biotransformations were run in 200 mL jacketed vessels with a magnetic stirrer, with<br>
temperature and pH control (with IN NaOH). Cell pastes were re-suspended at 10% w/v in either O.IM Tris-HCl<br>
buffer (adjusted to the required pH), or 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 6. Substrate, buffer and cell paste were added to the<br>
vessel and samples taken for analysis by chiral GC by dilution into MTBE.<br>

Analytical Development for Compound 4<br>
The conditions for the chiral assay HPLC method of analysis was reproduced to give the resolution<br>

Under the assay conditions the peak shapes of the enantiomers were a little broad (Figure IK), thus an<br>
attempt was made to improve this assay. This was achieved by employing supercritical fluid chromatography<br>
(SFC), with both isomers giving sharp peaks that were fully resolved within 4 minutes. See Figure 1L.<br>
Optimized SFC Conditions:<br>

Bioresolution of Compound 4<br>
During the study of the biotransformation of Compound 1, it was discovered that the material was<br>
susceptible to non-enzymatic hydrolysis. This could be due to the high lability of Compound 1 towards<br>
hydrolysis and the instability of the postulated lactone-alcohol product, that a possible pathway for the<br>
biotransformation was opening of the lactone before saponification of the butyrate. If this was true then<br>
enzymatic resolution Compound 4 might be possible. Therefore the reactivity of Compound 4 was tested with<br>
Upases PS, PPL, M, MY and the SAW A immobilized lipase, in toluene-pH 7 buffer at 20°C. No reaction was<br>
observed (TLC, 24 hours). The enzymatic reaction probably proceeds by first cleavage of the butyrate and then<br>
possible lactone opening.<br>
Conglomerate Studies<br>
The IR spectra of the racemate and single enantiomer of Compound 4 were compared and found to be<br>
similar but not identical.<br>
The melting points of each of these compounds were then determined by differential scanning calorimetry<br>
(DSC) and found to give an onset of melting of 91.7°C for the racemate and 81.1°C for the (-)-enantiomer (98.7%<br>
ee). Comparison of these melting points reveals that the racemate has a higher melting point than the single<br>
enantiomer. For a compound to be a conglomerate the IR spectra of the racemate and single enantiomer must be<br>
identical and the melting point of the racemate is required to be the lowest point on the phase diagram. Therefore,<br>
this compound is clearly not a conglomerate.<br>
Subsequently, a phase diagram for Compound 4 was constructed. The position of the eutectic was<br>
determined, above which point the ee of this compound may be enhanced to enantiomenc purity by<br>
crystallization. This phase diagram information was to be obtained by analyzing the melting points (again by<br>
DSC) of samples of differing enantiomeric excess in 10% ee increments. These samples were initially prepared<br>
by dissolving the required amounts of racemate and single enantiomer in acetone and removing the solvent. This<br>
method was successful for the 10% ee, 80% ee and 90% ee samples, with the DSC traces containing just one<br>
peak. For all the other samples however, two peaks were observed by DSC (possibly due to polymorphs). A<br>
number of methods for producing these samples were attempted to combat this problem. These included melting<br>
the sample; dissolving in acetone and heating O/N at 65 °C; melting and heating overnight at 65 °C and using<br>
dichloromethane as the solvent; but the DSC still gave two peaks. Therefore the phase diagram/eutectic could not<br>
be determined via this method. In addition since the compound was extremely soluble and only 1 g of the<br>
racemate and each of the single enantiomers was available, solubility studies were ruled out. However, since only<br>
one peak was given by the racemate and single enantiomer samples by DSC, the melting points and enthalpy<br>
values for these samples could be determined. This allowed the phase diagram to be constructed theoretically (J.<br>
Jacques, A. Collet and S.H. Wilden, Enantiomers, Racemates and Resolutions, New York: Wiley, 1981).<br>
The Schroder- Van Laar equation can be used to calculate the liquidus curve between the pure enantiomer<br>
and the eutectic for a true racemate compound, using the melting point and enthalpy of fusion of the pure<br>
enantiomer:<br>
Inx = — - —17- -- r R \.1[ TV<br>
Mole Fraction; 0.9 Tf = 351.64K 78.64°C<br>
0.8 Tf= 346.60 K 73.60°C<br>
0.7 Tf=341.05K 68.05°C<br>
0.6 , Tf = 334.86 K 61.86°C<br>
Then the part of the curve below which the solid phase consists of pure racemic compound can be<br>
determined using the following equation (Prigogine-Defay):<br>
In4x(l-x) <br>
R VTR<br>
f TfJ<br>
Mole Fraction; 0.9 Tf= 349.26 K 76.26°C<br>
0.8 Tf = 360.8 I K 87.81°C<br>
0.7 Tf = 366.53 K 93.53°C<br>
0.6 Tf = 369.4 I K 96.40°C<br>
Where:<br>
x = mole fraction of most abundant enantiomer (0.5 x 1) of a mixture whose melting terminates at <br>
(K).<br>
= enthalpy of fusion of single enantiomer (J.mor1).<br>
= enthalpy of fusion of racemate (J.mol"').<br>
R = 8.31 (J.K-'.mor1).<br>
TA = melting point of pure single enantiomer (K).<br>
TR = melting point of racemate (K).<br>
Both of these curves were then plotted on the same graph to give the phase diagram. The point at \vhich<br>
the lines cross is the eutectic, which in this case is 77.5% ee. See Figure 4.<br>

Enzymatic Resolution of DAPD<br>
A limited enzyme screen aimed at resolving the isomers of c/5-DAPD by transesterificauon using vinyl<br>
butyrate was performed. Enzymes were chosen on the basis of known transesterification activity. Solvents<br>
investigated were toluene (substrate insoluble), DMF and pyridine (substrate soluble). The reactions were<br>
followed by TLC and the enantiomeric excesses measured by supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC)<br>
(Chiralpak AD). As confirmation, enantiomeric excesses were also measured using a HPLC assay (100% MeOH.<br>
Chiralpak AD) and were in agreement with the SFC results.<br>
For each enzyme: To racemic cis-DAPD (TP0041/97/D-1, 10 mg, 0.04 mmol) was added solvent (1 mL)<br>
(toluene, DMF or pyridine, see Table 13), vinyl butyrate (0.1 mL, 0.8 mmol) and then enzyme (5-10 mg). The<br>
vials were shaken in an incubator at 30°C and assayed periodically by removing 50 \\L aliquots, diluting with<br>
methanol and analysing by TLC (10:1:0.1 EtOAc: MeOH: H2O) and chiral. Table 23 shows the results obtained.<br>
