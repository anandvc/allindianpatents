				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a process for removing arsenic salts or<br>
arsenic compounds from arsenic-contaminated water to a level of 50 ppb or<br>
below using nanostructured porous alumina powder material as an absorptive<br>
media. More specifically, the present invention deals with an absorption<br>
process for removal of arsenic contaminants [both arsenic (III) and arsenic<br>
(V) species] from the raw water by treating arsenic contaminated water with<br>
nanostructured porous alumina material following various methods of<br>
absorption techniques, e.g., single-step absorption or multi-step absorption or<br>
bed-type absorption depending on the concentration of arsenic contaminants<br>
in the feed water and the level of removal.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
One of the major concerns for sourcing potable water from natural resources<br>
is the possibility of arsenic contamination with the groundwater. In the<br>
various parts of the world, most notably, Bangladesh, India (West Bengal)<br>
and the United States of America have seen to cause life threatening diseases<br>
and other health hazards including cancer that affected a large numbers of<br>
people in the region due to consumption of arsenic contaminated water.<br>
About 3% of water samples collected worldwide showed to contain arsenic at<br>
concentrations greater than 50 'parts per billion' (ppb). Thermal water in<br>
Wyoming, California, Nevada, Alaska and Iceland are reported to be in the<br>
range of 20 - 3,800 ppb and water from the Waitopu Valley (New Zealand) is<br>
said to contain up to an alarming level of 276,000 ppb. Other countries<br>
include Argentina, Australia, Chile, China, Hungary, Mexico, Peru, Thailand<br>
etc, where adverse health effects have been documented due to arsenic<br>
contamination with the groundwater.<br>
-Z-<br><br>
The common route of exposure to arsenic is through food chain. Arsenic<br>
enters into groundwater in the form of its compounds or as soluble acids and<br>
further enters into the food chain containing plants, cereals and other food<br>
chains through rock and soil. Regions of volcanic or geothermal activity<br>
usually show elevated levels of arsenic contamination. Saltwater fishes often<br>
showed about 10 milligrams of arsenic per kilogram of tissue. The average<br>
daily per capita intake of arsenic from food could shoot up to a level of 50<br>
micrograms, depending on geographical location. Though it is interesting to<br>
note that arsenic may rather be useful to human at extremely low doses,<br>
however, high consumption of arsenic is reported, commonly lead to<br>
gastrointestinal disorder, fatal skin diseases, hypotension, including cancer.<br>
Arsenic is a naturally occurring element that is tasteless and odorless. In the<br>
earth's crust, arsenic ranks as the twentieth most common element. Arsenic<br>
is present in soils ranging from 0.1 to 40 milligrams per kilogram (parts per<br>
million, ppm) with an average level between 1.5 - 2 milligrams per kilogram<br>
[1]. Arsenic is considered to be a metalloid and not a true metal. Arsenic<br>
exists in four valence states. The four states are:<br>
•	Arsenate (As+5)<br>
•	Arsenite (As+3)<br>
•	Elemental Arsenic (As0)<br>
•	Arsine gas (As3)<br>
In the groundwater, Arsenic is present predominantly in the form of arsenate<br>
(As+5) and arsenite (As+3). Of the two predominant species, the arsenite is<br>
considered to be more toxic than arsenate that also has higher solubility in<br>
water. Arsenite is generally associated with anarobic conditions in<br>
groundwater and is more mobile than arsenate in groundwater. Arsenite is<br>
reported to be around sixty times more toxic than arsenate, due to its<br>
preferred reaction with enzymes in human metabolism. Other examples of<br>
inorganic arsenic compounds found naturally include oxides of arsenic, i.e.<br>
-3-<br><br>
As203, As205 and sulfides of arsenic, i.e., As2S3, AsS, HAsS2, HAsS33". Arsenic<br>
compounds which are stable in oxygenated water include arsenic acid<br>
containing As (V) i.e. H3As04, H2As04", Has042", and As043~. Arsenous acid<br>
containing As (III) species is also stable as H3As03 and H2As03" under mild<br>
reducing aqueous solutions. Arsenite can be converted to arsenate under<br>
oxidizing atmosphere, which means well-aerated surface water predominately<br>
contains arsenates.<br>
A wide range of technologies has been tried for the removal of arsenic from<br>
the borewell or groundwater containing higher levels of arsenic, thus making<br>
the natural water potable. The most common technologies for removal of<br>
arsenic utilize the conventional processes of oxidation, precipitation, ion<br>
exchange processes, membrane filtration techniques and most widely<br>
adsorption processes using various adsorptive media. These techniques are<br>
discussed in the following examples:<br>
A. Oxidative Methods<br>
Arsenic is present in groundwater in As (III) and As (V) forms in different<br>
proportions. Most oxidative treatment methods are effective in removing<br>
arsenic in pentavalent form and hence include an oxidation step for<br>
converting arsenite to arsenate, in case arsenic (III) is present in the water.<br>
Arsenite can be oxidized by oxygen, ozone, free chlorine, hypochlorite,<br>
permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, and Fenton's reagent, though atmospheric<br>
oxygen, hypochloride and permanganate are commonly used. The<br>
corresponding chemical reactions involved in oxidation process could be<br>
written as:<br>
H3As03 + V2 02 D H2As04" + 2H+<br>
H3As03 + HCIO □ HAs04' + CI" + 3H+<br>
3H3As03 + 2KMn04 □ 3HAs04"2 + 2Mn02+ + 2K+ + 4H+ + H20<br>
Arial oxidation of arsenic is very slow and can take several weeks for<br>
oxidation but chemicals like chlorine and permanganate can rapidly oxidize<br>
arsenite under wide range of conditions [5].<br><br>
Al. In-situ Oxidation<br>
In-situ oxidation, the dissolved oxygen in water oxidizes arsenite to less<br>
mobile arsenate that results in reduction of arsenic content in water.<br>
Experimental results show that arsenic in the tube well water following in-situ<br>
oxidation is reduced to about half due to underground precipitation and<br>
adsorption on ferric iron [5].<br>
A2. Solar Oxidation<br>
Solar oxidation is another simple example of oxidative method to oxidize<br>
arsenic in presence of solar radiation. By using this method, even transparent<br>
bottles containing arsenic contaminated water when exposed to sunlight for a<br>
given period of time is reported to reduce arsenic (III) content in the water.<br>
Ultraviolet radiation can also catalyze the process of oxidation of arsenite in<br>
presence of other oxidants like oxygen. Experiments using natural water in<br>
Bangladesh region show that the process, on average, can reduce arsenic<br>
content of water to about one-third [6],<br>
A3. Oxidation Method by Passive Sedimentation<br>
Passive sedimentation is another example of oxidative method that had<br>
received considerable attention primarily because of rural people's habit of<br>
storing water in pitchers for drinking purposes. Oxidation of water during<br>
collection and subsequent storage in houses often cause a reduction in<br>
arsenic concentration in the stored water.<br>
Experiments conducted using groundwater collected from the region of<br>
Bangladesh showed zero to high reduction in arsenic content by passive<br>
sedimentation. Arsenic reduction by plain sedimentation, appears to be<br>
dependent on water quality, particularly, the presence of precipitating iron in<br>
water that makes the arsenic to sediment under static condition of storage<br>
along with iron. Authors [5] showed that more than 50% reduction in arsenic<br>
content is possible by sedimentation of tube-well water containing 380-480<br>
- 5-<br><br>
mg/L of alkalinity in the form of CaC03 and 8-12 mg/L of iron, but the desired<br>
level of arsenic could not be reduced by this process. Most studies showed a<br>
reduction of 0 - 25% of the initial concentration of arsenic in ground water by<br>
this method.<br>
B. Precipitation and coagulation methods<br>
Precipitation and coagulation methods for arsenic removal from raw water<br>
depend upon the co-precipitation of both water insoluble arsenates and<br>
inorganic oxides of other metals. The water insoluble inorganic oxides are<br>
produced by the hydrolysis in the arsenic contaminated raw water by adding<br>
coagulants such as alum, ferric chloride or ferric sulfate. It is reported that in<br>
case of alum as coagulant, the pH of the contaminated water must be very<br>
close to neutral, whereas in case of ferric chloride, it can serve over a wide<br>
pH range.<br>
Bl. Filtration followed by Coagulation<br>
Conventional filtration followed by coagulation or flocculation using iron salts,<br>
is reported to be effective in removing arsenic up to 90% of (As+5) and 50%<br>
of (As+3).at pH in or around 7. Thus, in such methods, it is very important to<br>
fully oxidize As+3 to As+5 with chlorine or another strong oxidant prior to<br>
coagulation.<br>
It was reported [7] that coagulation/ filtration for arsenic removal from a high<br>
arsenic water with ferric ions as the coagulant could be considerably<br>
enhanced by adding an appropriate amount of coarse calcite. The enhanced<br>
coagulation and conventional filtration achieved a very high arsenic removal<br>
over 99%.<br>
Another report [8] states that, electro-coagulation is a very promising<br>
electrochemical treatment technique that does not require the addition of<br>
-6-<br><br>
chemicals or regeneration. The solid products which were deposited on the<br>
iron electrode during the process of electro-coagulation were characterized.<br>
The results suggested that magnetite particles and amorphous iron oxy-<br>
hydroxides present in the electro-coagulation products remove As(III) and<br>
As(V) with an efficiency of more than 99% from ground water in a field pilot<br>
scale study.<br>
C. Adsorption Methods<br>
Adsorption methods have been successfully applied to remove arsenic from<br>
groundwater. Adsorptive media that have been most widely used are<br>
activated alumina, ion exchange, elemental iron or iron compounds like ferric<br>
hydroxide, organic polymers, kaolin clay, and silica sand. Granular Ferric<br>
Hydroxide (GFH) is reported to be a good absorptive material. A lot of<br>
research has been carried out using this material for absorption. The article<br>
[9] describes the quantification of arsenate adsorption kinetics on GFH and to<br>
determine the inter particle diffusion rate. In another report, it is stated [10]<br>
that GFH is effective in reducing both As (III) and As (V) to a level less than 5<br>
ppb in drinking water from an initial concentration of 100 ppb at the pH levels<br>
of 6 and 7.6, with highest removal recorded at pH 7.6. It has been reported<br>
[11] that arsenic adsorption by GFH in a fixed bed reactor is simple, safe, and<br>
effective method for the elimination of arsenic from contaminated ground<br>
water. Depending upon the concentration of arsenic in raw water, 50,000 to<br>
70,000 bed volumes can be treated with GFH.<br>
CI. Absorption using Activated Alumina<br>
Activated alumina has a long history of using as an adsorptive material for<br>
arsenic removal. The material is extremely porous and has a high surface<br>
area.<br><br>
The capacity of arsenic removal by activated alumina is pH dependent, with<br>
the maximum removal capacity achieved in the pH range of 5.5 - 6. It is<br>
reported [14] that a household technology is developed based on activated<br>
alumina in which the efficiency of the technology is reported to be excellent<br>
irrespective of feed water quality. As reported, it also removes iron and<br>
manganese besides removal of As. The two activated alumina plants<br>
evaluated were capable of achieving arsenic levels of 5 ppb or less in the<br>
treated water, provided that the activated alumina was changed in time [12].<br>
It is reported [15] that arsenic removal can be done to the acceptable levels<br>
of below 50 ppb within 2 hours of adsorption time. It is achieved by agitation<br>
in the presence of activated alumina adsorbent below about 200 micrometers<br>
diameter with sufficient porosity of pores of above 100A diameter. It is<br>
reported that the amount of activated alumina adsorbent used per liter should<br>
not exceed 3.5gm because higher amounts results in higher viscosity and<br>
hence requiring higher energy consumption for mixing, pumping, etc., in<br>
higher consumption and possibly higher losses of alumina. It is preferred to<br>
use adsorbent in the range of 1.0-3.5 gm/L to facilitate solid-liquid contact<br>
and separation of loaded adsorbent. The said adsorption process is suitable<br>
for reducing levels of arsenic of about 0.5 to 5 ppm to below the acceptable<br>
limit of 50 ppb. The feed water having concentrations above 5 ppm, a<br>
pretreatment which includes precipitation with reagents such as ferric<br>
sulphate or chloride, is preferably used to reduce the arsenic concentration.<br>
Another group [16] has tried to remove arsenite ions (As (III)) by activated<br>
alumina. The effect on adsorbent dose, solution pH, and contact time has<br>
been investigated that revealed arsenite removal is pH and temperature<br>
dependent. A maximum of 96.2% As (III) removal could be achieved at pH<br>
7.6. The results suggested that adsorption of As (III) on activated alumina is<br>
a complex mechanism where both surface adsorption and intra particle<br>
diffusion contribute to the rate determining step and the adsorption process<br>
was spontaneous and decreased with increase in temperature.<br><br>
C2. Absorption using metallic iron<br>
Metallic iron or zero-valent iron is an effective material for dehalogenation of<br>
chlorinated organic compounds and for the removal of toxic metals [17].<br>
Granular iron is reported to offer a great promise for the in situ remediation of<br>
ground water contaminated with organic and inorganic pollutants.<br>
Thermodynamic considerations indicate that Fe (0) can reduce highly soluble<br>
As (V) and As (III) to sparsely soluble As (0). It has been reported that batch<br>
experiments showed faster removal of As (III) than As (V) removal rate at pH<br>
4 and 7 under anoxic conditions and under oxic conditions, As (III) removal<br>
was slower than As (V) removal at pH 7. Another article [18] reported a two<br>
stage treatment approach, viz. treatment with Fenton's reagent (lOOmg of<br>
ferrous ammonium sulphate + 100 pi H2O2 per liter) for 10 min followed by<br>
passing through iron scrap and filtering through sand, was found to be<br>
suitable for consistently producing water with arsenic content less than 10<br>
ppb.<br>
D. Membrane Filtration Methods<br>
Membrane filtration methods have been applied primarily to purify brackish<br>
water or seawater for use as drinking water. The water flows through the<br>
membrane whereas most of the water contaminants are retained. Not only<br>
are inorganic contaminants such as arsenic, lead, and iron removed from the<br>
treated water, but pathogens and hazardous organic contaminants are<br>
removed. Some articles have been reported to separate arsenic by various<br>
membrane filtration methods.<br>
Dl. Reverse Osmosis (RO)<br>
Most reverse osmosis plants are designed for 75-80% recovery, i.e. up to<br>
25% of the flow must be disposed of as a concentrated, possibly hazardous,<br>
and waste. Reverse osmosis is quite capable of the removal of arsenic to very<br>
low levels.   Robert Y. Ning [19] has done work on arsenic removal by RO<br><br>
method. Arsenic in the commonly high oxidation states of (V) is very<br>
effectively removed by RO. But it shows lower treatment efficiencies for<br>
arsenite. Elevating the pH such as by caustic injection into RO system feed<br>
water is done for the greater removal of As (III) compounds. It has been<br>
reported [20] that removal of As (V) and Sb (V) is much higher than As (III)<br>
and Sb (III) over the pH range 3-10. The effect of solution pH on the<br>
removal of arsenic using RO membranes was strongly affected by the solution<br>
pH, especially As (III). Controlling the pH of membrane feed water is essential<br>
for the successful removal of arsenic compounds.<br>
D2. Nano-Filtration<br>
This process uses an ultra-low-pressure membrane designed to allow only<br>
passage of particles less than 1 nanometer (10 Angstroms) in size. It is thus<br>
very efficient in the removal of dissolved matter, but is, of course, not<br>
selective for arsenic only. Like all other membrane processes, extensive<br>
pretreatment is necessary to prevent fouling of the delicate and expensive<br>
membranes caused by particulate matter, scaling, or bio-fouling.<br>
The rejection characteristics of the sodium dibasic arsenate as well as the<br>
arsenate anion from the natural groundwater by the nano-filtration<br>
membranes have been reported [21] to be satisfactory. Another report [22]<br>
have compared the performance of rapid sand filtration inter-chlorination<br>
system with nano-filtration in arsenic removal from raw water. It was<br>
observed that nano-filtration membrane could remove over 95% of As (V)<br>
under relatively low applied pressure and 75% of As (III) without adding any<br>
chemical additives. It was observed that As (III) could not be removed by<br>
rapid sand filtration system with out pre-oxidation of As (III) to As (V).<br>
D3. Electro dialysis (ED) and Electro Dialysis Reversal CEDRI<br>
Electro-dialytic and dialytic techniques [23] were used for the removal of<br>
Arsenic and other heavy metals. The effect of applying direct current, as<br>
"cleaning agent", of up to 120 mA was investigated. Parallel comparisons<br>
-10-<br><br>
were done between the two processes to reveal transport of charged particles<br>
induced solely by internal electrochemical potential difference in the system.<br>
The maximum removal efficiencies obtained in a batch electro-dialytic cell<br>
operated for 14 days was 95% for Arsenic.<br>
D4. Coagulation-Assisted Membrane Process ("CAMP*)<br>
Coagulation-assisted membrane process (CAMP) is considered to be a<br>
promising technology for arsenic removal because it can be applied over a<br>
wide range of water quality that contains high turbidity, iron, manganese,<br>
sulfate and nitrate.<br>
Low pressure membranes (e.g. micro-filtration and ultra-filtration) are very<br>
effective in removing particulate arsenic, but with out pre-coagulation step,<br>
low pressure membranes are ineffective at removing soluble arsenic. Metal-<br>
based coagulants, such as ferric chloride, can be used to bind arsenic which is<br>
removed with the ferric floe on the membrane. Factors affecting the CAM<br>
process include ferric chloride dosage, pH, mixing and floe formation. As with<br>
all membrane processes, provision for adequate pretreatment to control feed<br>
water quality need to be taken to protect the membrane from fouling caused<br>
by particulate matter, scaling and bio-fouling to optimize membrane<br>
performance and life. Disposal of the reject coagulant can be to a sanitary<br>
sewer.<br>
E. Ion Exchange Methods<br>
One great advantage of Ion Exchange is that no pH adjustment is necessary<br>
and recent advances in resin technology have replaced the weak-base anion<br>
resins with strong-base ones. Pentavalent arsenic (As+5), being present as the<br>
divalent anion HAs04"2, appears to have greater affinity for this type of resin.<br>
The ability to consistently achieve low levels of arsenic in the treated water<br>
(i.e. 
new anion exchanger (AE) prepared from a natural material like coconut coir<br>
pith (CP), for the removal of arsenic (V) from the aqueous solutions was<br>
evaluated [13]. The adsorbent (CP-AE) carrying dimethylaminohydroxypropyl<br><br>
weak base functional group was synthesized by the reaction of CP with<br>
epichlorohydrin and dimethylamine followed by treatment of hydrochloric<br>
acid. Analysis shows the presence of -NH+(CH3)2CI" group in the adsorbent<br>
and confirms the decrease in crystallinity in CP-AE compared to CP. Batch<br>
experiments were conducted to examine the efficiency of the adsorbent on<br>
As(V) removal and maximum removal of 99.2% was obtained.<br>
It appears from the literature that absorption methods using appropriate<br>
absorptive media and preferably without the usage of any secondary<br>
material/s (those normally used to optimize pH in the absorption process for<br>
enhancing the absorption) could be a better solution for removing arsenic<br>
from raw water. In this context, this invention was made using a porous<br>
material based on aluminum oxide ceramic powder sourced from Bharat<br>
Heavy Electricals Limited, India (BHEL/CTI) [24] that removes arsenic to a<br>
level of 50 ppb or below from feed water containing arsenic in the range of 10<br>
- 500 'parts per million' (ppm). The process does not need to use any<br>
secondary chemical/s in the absorption process. The process hereby<br>
discloses various parameters that effect the absorption process, i.e., the<br>
quantity of absorbent media, agitation/residence time, type/mode of<br>
absorption (single-step, multi-step, bed type etc) for effective removal arsenic<br>
from feed water having variable levels of arsenic in absence of any secondary<br>
chemical/s in the absorption process those normally used to optimize the pH<br>
of the medium for enhancing the absorption.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a process for<br>
removing arsenic salts or arsenic compound from arsenic-contaminated<br>
waters to a level of 50 ppb or below using nano structured porous alumina<br>
power material as an absorptive media by which arsenic-free water could be<br>
generated from arsenic-contaminated water that will help the society at large<br>
-12-<br><br>
for prevention of many diseases and health hazards those caused by<br>
consumption of arsenic-contaminated potable water.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a process for removing<br>
arsenic compounds from arsenic contaminated water to a level of 50 ppb or<br>
below using nano structructed porous alumina power material which is<br>
economical and environmentally benign material less costly and eco-friendly.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS:<br>
In arsenic-contaminated groundwater, both arsenic (V) and arsenic (III) could<br>
predominantly be present, the invented process is valid for any raw water<br>
that is contaminated with either or both the above forms of arsenic.<br>
Arsenic contaminated water with variable concentrations of both (V) and (III)<br>
forms of arsenic were prepared by dissolving known quantities of arsenic<br>
salts, i.e., sodium arsenate (Na2HAsC&gt;4.7H20) and sodium arsenite (NaAs02)<br>
respectively in de-ionized water. Both of the salts are soluble in water and<br>
are the salts largely used for making an artificial contamination of arsenic in<br>
water under laboratory condition. The derived arsenic-contaminated water<br>
represents a condition, similar to various sources of raw water from natural<br>
sources with respect to arsenic contamination/s.<br>
As (V) contaminated water, i.e., aqueous solutions of sodium arsenate<br>
(Na2HAs04.7H20) (AR grade) is prepared with known concentrations of i) 500<br>
ppm (0.500mg/L), ii) 300 ppm (0.300mg/L), iii) 100 ppm (O.lOOmg/L), iv) 50<br>
ppm (0.050mg/L), v) 20 ppm (0.020mg/L) and vi) 10 ppm (O.OlOmg/L). In<br>
case of As (III) contaminated water, i.e., aqueous solutions of sodium<br>
arsenite (NaAs02) (AR grade) is prepared with the same concentrations are<br>
prepared in the above.<br>
-13-<br><br>
As per the process, arsenic contaminated water with varied levels of arsenic is<br>
agitated with definite quantity of nanostructured porous alumina powder<br>
(absorptive media) in a definite period of time using a magnetic stirrer. The<br>
purpose of agitation is to allow arsenic to get absorbed with the absorptive<br>
media within a definite period of agitation time. The purpose of stirring is to<br>
disperse the absorptive media homogeneously in the arsenic contaminated<br>
water and the speed of stirring could be adjusted accordingly so as to<br>
disperse the absorptive media homogeneously throughout the water. Both<br>
the agitation and dispersion operation in the above process could also be<br>
achieved by other means, say, ultrasonic treatment.<br>
After the agitation, an emulsion or slurry is resulted which needs to be filtered<br>
using suitable filter paper or filter cloth. In order to accelerate the filtration<br>
process, a vacuum pump could be used.<br>
After filtration, the filtered water is collected and arsenic concentration in the<br>
filtered water is estimated using both Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical<br>
Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometry<br>
(AAS) techniques and removal of arsenic in the contaminated water is<br>
estimated. It is to be mentioned that when the evaporation takes place from<br>
the filtered water, the concentration of arsenic in the filtered water would go<br>
up that would mislead the arsenic level in the filtered water and hence the<br>
removal efficiency of the process. For the purpose of accurate testing, the<br>
filtered water is preserved carefully to avoid any evaporation or contamination<br>
that could take place due to environmental and atmospheric conditions.<br>
In case the removal of arsenic in desired level has not been achieved by the<br>
said agitation process, one way to achieve this is to increase the quantity of<br>
absorptive media and follow thereafter the same procedure. Alternatively,<br>
the number of steps in the agitation process need to be progressively<br>
increased using fresh absorptive media, until the level of separation of arsenic<br><br>
is achieved in the filtrate and hence a so-called multi-step absorption method<br>
could be followed.<br>
Further methods of achieving the desired level of arsenic in the filtrate<br>
besides agitating the absorptive media either in a single-step or multi-step<br>
process, absorption of arsenic by the absorptive media is also adopted by<br>
making a bed using the absorptive media with required thickness that is<br>
wrapped with a filter cloth in which the arsenic contaminated water is passed<br>
through the bed and thereby the filtered water is collected in the other end of<br>
the bed. Due to the high retention time of the arsenic contaminated water in<br>
the absorptive bed, a high adsorption of arsenic is observed and arsenic is<br>
removed in the desired level from the feed water.<br>
