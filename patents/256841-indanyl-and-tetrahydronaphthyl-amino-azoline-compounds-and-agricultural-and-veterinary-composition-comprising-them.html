				<td>The present invention relates to Indanyl- or Tetrahydronaphthyl-amino-azoline<br>
compounds, which are useful for combating animal pests. The present invention also<br>
relates to methods for combating animal pests and to agricultural compositions for<br>
combating animal pests.<br>
Animal pests and in particular insects, arachnids and nematodes destroy growing and<br>
harvested crops and attack wooden dwelling and commercial structures, causing large<br>
economic loss to the food supply and to property. While a large number of pesticidal<br>
agents are known, due to the ability of target pests to develop resistance to said<br>
agents, there is an ongoing need for new agents for combating insects, arachnids and<br>
nematodes.<br>
Compounds similar to those of formula I have been described in DE-A1963192.<br>
However, these compounds described in DE-A1963192 are limited in their activity or<br>
with regard to the broadness of their activity spectrum.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compounds having a good<br>
pesticidal activity and showing a broad activity spectrum against a large number of<br>
different anmimal pests, especially against difficult to control insects, arachnids and<br>
nematodes.<br>

amines II by the synthetic route outlined in the following scheme:<br><br>
According to the method outlined in the scheme, an amine II is converted to the<br>
corresponding isothiocaynate IV by conventional means, e.g. by reacting II with<br>
thiophosgene (see e.g. Houben-Weyl, E4, "Methoden der Organischen Chemie",<br>
chapter lic, pp. 837-842, Georg Thieme Verlag 1983. The isothiocyanate IV is then<br>
reacted with aminoethanol, thereby obtaining the thiourea V.<br><br>
The reaction of the aminoethanol with isothiocyanate IV can be performed in<br>
accordance with standard methods of organic chemistry, see e.g. Biosci. Biotech.<br>
Biochem. 56 (7), 1062-65 (1992).<br>
The thus obtained thioureas V can be cyclized by conventional means thereby<br>
obtaining the desired thiazoline compound of the formula Illa,b-S. Cyclization of<br>
compound V can be achieved e.g. under acid catalysis or under dehydrating<br>
conditions e.g. by Mitsunobu's reaction (see Tetrahedron Letters 1999, 40, 3125-<br>
3128).<br>
In our parallel US provisional application, which is filed simultanously, such<br>
alternatives methods are described.<br>
According to the method outlined in the scheme, an amine II can also be converted to<br>
azolines Ill-X by reaction with 2-chloroethylisothiocyanate or 2-chloroethylisocyanate<br>
e.g. as described in Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1994, 4, 2317-22 and subsequent<br>
cyclization in the presence or absence of base or under the conditions described<br>
below.<br>
Amines II are commercially available or known in the art or can be prepared by<br>
methods familiar to an organic chemist and well known in the art e.g. EP 2812578<br>
(indanyl type amines) or US 3 953 506 (tetrahydronaphthyl type amines).<br>
1-Chloro-2-isothiocyanatoethane (CAS-reg.-no.: 6099-88-3) and 2-<br>
chloroethylisocyanate (CAS-reg.-no.: 1943-83-5) are commercially available.<br>
Compounds of the generell formula VI or VII can be obtained by reaction with a<br>
suitable electrophile as outlined in the following scheme e.g. an alkylating or acylating<br>
reagent e. g. as described in WO 2005063724.<br><br>
The particular reaction mixtures are worked up, as a rule, by conventional methods,<br>
for example by removing the solvent, distributing the residue in a mixture of water and<br>
a suitable organic solvent and isolating the product from the organic phase.<br><br>
The Indanyl- orTetrahydronaphthyl-amino-azoline compounds I may be obtained in<br>
the preparation as isomer mixtures, which however can, if desired, be separated into<br>
the pure isomers by conventional methods, for example by crystallization or<br>
chromatography (if necessary, over an optically active adsorbate). Pure optically<br>
active isomers can be synthesized, for example, from corresponding optically active<br>
starting materials.<br>
In general, the Indanyl- or Tetrahydronaphthyl-amino-azoline compounds of the<br>
formula I can be prepared by the methods described above. However, in individual<br>
cases, certain compounds I can also advantageously be prepared from other<br>
compounds by other conventional methods as ester hydrolysis, amidation,<br>
esterification, ether cleavage, olefination, reduction, oxidation etc.<br>

Publishers, Dordrecht, 1998 (ISBN 0-7514-0443-8), for example by extending the .<br>
active compound with auxiliaries suitable for the formulation of agrochemicals, such<br>
as solvents and/or carriers, if desired emulsifiers, surfactants and dispersants,<br><br>
preservatives, antifoaming agents, anti-freezing agents, for seed treatment<br>
formulation also optionally colorants and/or binders and/or gelling agents.<br>
Solvents/carriers, which are suitable, are e.g.:<br>
solvents such as water, aromatic solvents (for example Solvesso products,<br>
xylene and the like), paraffins (for example mineral fractions), alcohols (for example<br>
methanol, butanol, pentanol, benzyl alcohol), ketones (for example cyclohexanone,<br>
gamma-butyrolactone), pyrrolidones (N-metyhl-pyrrolidone (NMP),N-octylpyrrolidone<br>
NOP), acetates (glycol diacetate), alkyl lactates, lactones such as g-butyrolactone,<br>
glycols, fatty acid dimethylamides, fatty acids and fatty acid esters, triglycerides, oils of<br>
vegetable or animal origin and modified oils such as alkylated plant oils. In principle,<br>
solvent mixtures may also be used.<br>

Suitable antifoaming agents are for example antifoaming agents based on silicon or<br>
magnesium stearate.<br>
Suitable preservatives are for example dichlorophen und benzyl alcohol hemiformal<br>
Suitable thickeners are compounds, which confer a pseudoplastic flow behavior to the<br>
formulation, i.e. high viscosity at rest and low viscosity in the agitated stage. Mention<br>
may be made, in this context, for example, of commercial thickeners based on<br>
polysaccharides, such as Xanthan Gum® (Kelzan® from Kelco), Rhodopol®23<br>
(Rhone Poulenc) or Veegum® (from R.T. Vanderbilt), or organic phyllosilicates, such<br>
as Attaclay® (from Engelhardt). Antifoam agents suitable for the dispersions<br>
according to the invention are, for example, silicone emulsions (such as, for example,<br>
Silikon® SRE, Wacker or Rhodorsil® from Rhodia), long-chain alcohols, fatty acids,<br>
organofluorine compounds and mixtures thereof. Biocides can be added to stabilize<br>
the compositions according to the invention against attack by microorganisms.<br>
Suitable biocides are, for example, based on isothiazolones such as the compounds<br>
marketed under the trademarks Proxel® from Avecia (or Arch) or Acticide® RS from<br>
Thor Chemie and Kathon® MK from Rohm &amp; Haas. Suitable antifreeze agents are<br>
organic polyols, for example ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol. These are<br>
usually employed in amounts of not more than 10% by weight, based on the total<br>
weight of the active compound composition. If appropriate, the active compound<br>
compositions according to the invention may comprise 1 to 5% by weight of buffer,<br>
based on the total amount of the formulation prepared, to regulate the pH, the amount<br>
and type of the buffer used depending on the chemical properties of the active<br>
compound or the active compounds. Examples of buffers are alkali metal salts of<br>
weak inorganic or organic acids, such as, for example, phosphoric acid, boronic acid,<br>
acetic acid, propionic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, oxalic acid and<br>
succinic acid.<br>
Substances which are suitable for the preparation of directly sprayable solutions,<br>
emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions are mineral oil fractions of medium to high boiling<br>
point, such as kerosene or diesel oil, furthermore coal tar oils and oils of vegetable or<br>
animal origin, aliphatic, cyclic and aromatic hydrocarbons, for example toluene,<br>

Powders, materials for spreading and dusts can be prepared by mixing or<br>
concomitantly grinding the active substances with a solid carrier.<br><br>
Granules, for example coated granules, impregnated granules and homogeneous<br>
granules, can be prepared by binding the active ingredients to solid carriers.<br>
Examples of solid carriers are mineral earths such as silica gels, silicates, talc, kaolin,<br>
attaclay, limestone, lime, chalk, bole, loess, clay, dolomite, diatomaceous earth,<br>
calcium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, magnesium oxide, ground synthetic materials,<br>
fertilizers, such as, for example, ammonium sulfate, ammonium phosphate,<br>
ammonium nitrate, ureas, and products of vegetable origin, such as cereal meal, tree<br>
bark meal, wood meal and nutshell meal, cellulose powders and other solid carriers.<br>
In general, the formulations comprise from 0.01 to 95% by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 90% by weight, of the active ingredient(s). The active ingredient(s) are employed in<br>
a purity of from 90% to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
For seed treatment purposes, respective formulations can be diluted 2-10 fold leading<br>
to concentrations in the ready to use preparations of 0.01 to 60% by weight active<br>
compound by weight, preferably 0.1 to 40% by weight.<br>
The compound of formula I can be used as such, in the form of their formulations or<br>
the use forms prepared therefrom, for example in the form of directly sprayable<br>
solutions, powders, suspensions or dispersions, emulsions, oil dispersions, pastes,<br>
dustable products, materials for spreading, or granules, by means of spraying,<br>
atomizing, dusting, spreading or pouring. The use forms depend entirely on the<br>
intended purposes; they are intended to ensure in each case the finest possible<br>
distribution of the active compounds according to the invention.<br>
Aqueous use forms can be prepared from emulsion concentrates, pastes or wettable<br>
powders (sprayable powders, oil dispersions) by adding water. To prepare emulsions,<br>
pastes or oil dispersions, the substances, as such or dissolved in an oil or solvent, can<br>
be homogenized in water by means of a wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier.<br>
Alternatively, it is possible to prepare concentrates composed of active substance,<br>
wetter, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if appropriate, solvent or oil, and such<br>
concentrates are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The active ingredient concentrations in the ready-to-use products can be varied within<br>
relatively wide ranges. In general, they are from 0.0001 to 10%, preferably from 0.01<br>
to 1 % per weight.<br>
The active ingredients may also be used successfully in the ultra-low-volume process<br>
(ULV), it being possible to apply formulations comprising over 95% by weight of active<br>
ingredient, or even to apply the active ingredient without additives.<br><br>

organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product having 10% (w/w) of active<br>
compound, which is applied undiluted for foliar use.<br>
Various types of oils, wetters, adjuvants, herbicides, fungicides, other pesticides, or<br>
bactericides may be added to the active ingredients, if appropriate just immediately<br>
prior to use (tank mix). These agents usually are admixed with the agents according<br>
to the invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1.<br>
The compounds and compositions of the present invention compounds I may be<br>
applied with other active ingredients, for example with other pesticides, insecticides,<br>
herbicides, fertilizers such as ammonium nitrate, urea, potash, and superphosphate,<br>
phytotoxicants and plant growth regulators, safeners and nematicides. These<br>
additional ingredients may be used sequentially or in combination with the above-<br>
described compositions, if appropriate also added only immediately prior to use (tank<br>
mix). For example, the plant(s) may be sprayed with a composition of this invention<br>
either before or after being treated with other active ingredients.<br>
These additonal active agents can be admixed with the agents used according to the<br>
invention in a weight ratio of 1:10 to 10:1. Mixing the compounds I, or the<br>
compositions comprising them in the use form as pesticides with other pesticides<br>

Applications<br><br>
The animal pest, i.e. the insects, arachnids and nematodes, the plant, soil or water in<br>
which the plant is growing can be contacted with the present compound(s) I or<br>
composition(s) containing them by any application method known in the art. As such,<br>
"contacting" includes both direct contact (applying the compounds/compositions<br>
directly on the animal pest or plant - typically to the foliage, stem or roots of the plant)<br>
and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions to the locus of the animal<br>
pest or plant).<br>
The compounds of formula I or the pesticidal compositions comprising them may be<br>
used to protect growing plants and crops from attack or infestation by animal pests,<br>
especially insects, acaridae or arachnids by contacting the plant/crop with a<br>
pesticidally effective amount of compounds of formula I. The term "crop" refers both to<br>
growing and harvested crops.<br>
Moreover, animal pests may be controlled by contacting the target pest, its food<br>
supply, habitat, breeding ground or its locus with a pesticidally effective amount of<br>
compounds of formula I. As such, the application may be carried out before or after<br>
the infection of the locus, growing crops, or harvested crops by the pest.<br>
The compounds of the invention can also be applied preventively to places at which<br>
occurrence of the pests is expected.<br>
The compounds of formula I may be also used to protect growing plants from attack or<br>
infestation by pests by contacting the plant with a pesticidally effective amount of<br>
compounds of formula I. As such, "contacting" includes both direct contact (applying<br>
the compounds/compositions directly on the pest and/or plant - typically to the foliage,<br>
stem or roots of the plant) and indirect contact (applying the compounds/compositions<br>
to the locus of the pest and/or plant).<br>
"Locus" means a habitat, breeding ground, plant, seed, soil, area, material or<br>
environment in which a pest or parasite is growing or may grow.<br>
In general, "pesticidally effective amount" means the amount of active ingredient<br>
needed to achieve an observable effect on growth, including the effects of necrosis,<br>
death, retardation, prevention, and removal, destruction, or otherwise diminishing the<br>
occurrence and activity of the target organism. The pesticidally effective amount can<br>
vary for the various compounds/compositions used in the invention. A pesticidally<br>
effective amount of the compositions will also vary according to the prevailing<br>
conditions such as desired pesticidal effect and duration, weather, target species,<br>
locus, mode of application, and the like.<br><br>
The compounds of formula I are effective through both contact (via soil, glass, wall,<br>
bed net, carpet, plant parts or animal parts), and ingestion (bait, or plant part).<br>
For use against ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitos, crickets, or cockroaches,<br>
compounds of formula I are preferably used in a bait composition.<br>
The bait can be a liquid, a solid or a semisolid preparation (e.g. a gel). Solid baits can<br>
be formed into various shapes and forms suitable to the respective application e.g.<br>
granules, blocks, sticks, disks. Liquid baits can be filled into various devices to ensure<br>
proper application, e.g. open containers, spray devices, droplet sources, or<br>
evaporation sources. Gels can be based on aqueous or oily matrices and can be<br>
formulated to particular necessities in terms of stickyness, moisture retention or aging<br>
characteristics.<br>
The bait employed in the composition is a product, which is sufficiently attractive to<br>
incite insects such as ants, termites, wasps, flies, mosquitos, crickets etc. or<br>
cockroaches to eat it. The attractiveness can be manipulated by using feeding<br>
stimulants or sex pheromones. Food stimulants are chosen, for example, but not<br>
exclusively, from animal and/or plant proteins (meat-, fish- or blood meal, insect parts,<br>
egg yolk), from fats and oils of animal and/or plant origin, or mono-, oligo- or<br>
polyorganosaccharides, especially from sucrose, lactose, fructose, dextrose, glucose,<br>
starch, pectin or even molasses or honey. Fresh or decaying parts of fruits, crops,<br>
plants, animals, insects or specific parts thereof can also serve as a feeding stimulant.<br>
Sex pheromones are known to be more insect specific. Specific pheromones are<br>
described in the literature and are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Formulations of compounds of formula I as aerosols (e.g in spray cans), oil sprays or<br>
pump sprays are highly suitable for the non-professional user for controlling pests<br>
such as flies, fleas, ticks, mosquitos or cockroaches. Aerosol recipes are preferably<br>
composed of the active compound, solvents such as lower alcohols (e.g. methanol,<br>
ethanol, propanol, butanol), ketones (e.g. acetone, methyl ethyl ketone), paraffin<br>
hydrocarbons (e.g. kerosenes) having boiling ranges of approximately 50 to 250°C,<br>
dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone, dimethyl sulphoxide, aromatic hydrocarbons<br>
such as toluene, xylene, water, furthermore auxiliaries such as emulsifiers such as<br>
sorbitol monooleate, oleyl ethoxylate having 3-7 mol of ethylene oxide, fatty alcohol<br>
ethoxylate, perfume oils such as ethereal oils, esters of medium fatty acids with lower<br>
alcohols, aromatic carbonyl compounds, if appropriate stabilizers such as sodium<br>
benzoate, amphoteric surfactants, lower epoxides, triethyl orthoformate and, if<br>
required, propellants such as propane, butane, nitrogen, compressed air, dimethyl<br>
ether, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, or mixtures of these gases.<br><br>
The oil spray formulations differ from the aerosol recipes in that no propellants are<br>
used.<br>
The compounds of formula I and its respective compositions can also be used in<br>
i mosquito and fumigating coils, smoke cartridges, vaporizer plates or long-term<br>
vaporizers and also in moth papers, moth pads or other heat-independent vaporizer<br>
systems.<br>
Methods to control infectious diseases transmitted by insects (e.g. malaria, dengue<br>
i and yellow fever, lymphatic filariasis, and leishmaniasis) with compounds of formula I<br>
and its respective compositions also comprise treating surfaces of huts and houses,<br>
air spraying and impregnation of curtains, tents, clothing items, bed nets, tsetse-fly<br>
trap or the like. Insecticidal compositions for application to fibers, fabric, knitgoods,<br>
nonwovens, netting material or foils and tarpaulins preferably comprise a mixture<br>
including the insecticide, optionally a repellent and at least one binder. Suitable<br>
repellents for example are N,N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), N,N-<br>
diethylphenylacetamide (DEPA), 1-(3-cyclohexan-1-yl-carbonyl)-2-methylpiperine, (2-<br>
hydroxymethylcyclohexyl) acetic acid lactone, 2-ethyl-1,3-hexandiol, indalone,<br>
Methylneodecanamide (MNDA), a pyrethroid not used for insect control such as {(+/-)-<br>
3-allyl-2-methyl-4-oxocyclopent-2-(+)-enyl-(+)-trans-chrysantemate (Esbiothrin), a<br>
repellent derived from or identical with plant extracts like limonene, eugenol, (+)-<br>
Eucamalol (1), (-)-i-epi-eucamalol or crude plant extracts from plants like Eucalyptus<br>
maculata, Vitex rotundifolia, Cymbopogan martinii, Cymbopogan citratus (lemon<br>
grass), Cymopogan nartdus (citronella). Suitable binders are selected for example<br>
from polymers and copolymers of vinyl esters of aliphatic acids (such as such as vinyl<br>
acetate and vinyl versatate), acrylic and methacrylic esters of alcohols, such as butyl<br>
acrylate, 2-ethylhexylacrylate, and methyl acrylate, mono- and di-ethylenically<br>
unsaturated hydrocarbons, such as styrene, and aliphatic diens, such as butadiene.<br>
The impregnation of curtains and bednets is done in general by dipping the textile<br>
material into emulsions or dispersions of the insecticide or spraying them onto the<br>
nets.<br>
The compounds of formula I and its compositions can be used for protecting wooden<br>
materials such as trees, board fences, sleepers, etc. and buildings such as houses,<br>
outhouses, factories, but also construction materials, furniture, leathers, fibers, vinyl<br>
articles, electric wires and cables etc. from ants and/or termites, and for controlling<br>
ants and termites from doing harm to crops or human being (e.g. when the pests<br>
invade into houses and public facilities). The compounds of formula I are applied not<br>
only to the surrounding soil surface or into the under-floor soil in order to protect<br>
wooden materials but it can also be applied to lumbered articles such as surfaces of<br>
the under-floor concrete, alcove posts, beams, plywoods, furniture, etc., wooden<br><br>
articles such as particle boards, half boards, etc. and vinyl articles such as coated<br>
electric wires, vinyl sheets, heat insulating material such as styrene foams, etc. In<br>
case of application against ants doing harm to crops or human beings, the ant<br>
controller of the present invention is applied to the crops or the surrounding soil, or is<br>
directly applied to the nest of ants or the like.<br>
In the case of soil treatment or of application to the pests dwelling place or nest, the<br>
quantity of active ingredient ranges from 0.0001 to 500 g per 100 m2, preferably from<br>
0.001 to 20 g per 100 m2.<br>
Customary application rates in the protection of materials are, for example, from 0.01<br>
g to 1000 g of active compound per m2 treated material, desirably from 0.1 g to 50 g<br>
per m2.<br>
Insecticidal compositions for use in the impregnation of materials typically contain<br>
from 0.001 to 95 weight %, preferably from 0.1 to 45 weight %, and more preferably<br>
from 1 to 25 weight % of at least one repellent and/or insecticide.<br>
For use in bait compositions, the typical content of active ingredient is from 0.001<br>
weight % to 15 weight %, desirably from 0.001 weight % to 5% weight % of active<br>
compound.<br>
For use in spray compositions, the content of active ingredient is from 0.001 to 80<br>
weights %, preferably from 0.01 to 50 weight % and most preferably from 0.01 to 15<br>
weight %.<br>
For use in treating crop plants, the rate of application of the active ingredients of this<br>
invention may be in the range of 0.1 g to 4000 g per hectare, desirably from 25 g to<br>
600 g per hectare, more desirably from 50 g to 500 g per hectare.<br>
Seed treatment<br>
The compounds of formula I are also suitable for the treatment of seeds in order to<br>
protect the seed from insect pest, in particular from soil-living insect pests and the<br>
resulting plant's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar insects.<br>
The compounds of formula I are particularly useful for the protection of the seed from<br>
soil pests and the resulting plant's roots and shoots against soil pests and foliar<br>
insects. The protection of the resulting plant's roots and shoots is preferred. More<br>
preferred is the protection of resulting plant's shoots from piercing and sucking<br>
insects, wherein the protection from aphids is most preferred.<br><br>
The present invention therefore comprises a method for the protection of seeds from<br>
insects, in particular from soil insects and of the seedlings' roots and shoots from<br>
insects, in particular from soil and foliar insects, said method comprising contacting<br>
the seeds before sowing and/or after pregermination with a compound of the general<br>
formula I or a salt thereof. Particularly preferred is a method, wherein the plant's roots<br>
and shoots are protected, more preferably a method, wherein the plants shoots are<br>
protected form piercing and sucking insects, most preferably aa method, wherein the<br>
plants shoots are protected from aphids.<br>
The term seed embraces seeds and plant propagules of all kinds including but not<br>
limited to true seeds, seed pieces, suckers, corms, bulbs, fruit, tubers, grains, cuttings,<br>
cut shoots and the like and means in a preferred embodiment true seeds.<br>
The term seed treatment comprises all suitable seed treatment techniques known in<br>
the art, such as seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking and seed<br>
pelleting.<br>
The present invention also comprises seeds coated with or containing the active<br>
compound.<br>
The term "coated with and/or containing" generally signifies that the active ingredient<br>
is for the most part on the surface of the propagation product at the time of<br>
application, although a greater or lesser part of the ingredient may penetrate into the<br>
propagation product, depending on the method of application. When the said<br>
propagation product is (re)planted, it may absorb the active ingredient.<br>
Suitable seed is seed of cereals, root crops, oil crops, vegetables, spices,<br>
ornamentals, for example seed of durum and other wheat, barley, oats, rye, maize<br>
(fodder maize and sugar maize / sweet and field corn), soybeans, oil crops, crucifers,<br>
cotton, sunflowers, bananas, rice, oilseed rape, turnip rape, sugarbeet, fodder beet,<br>
eggplants, potatoes, grass, lawn, turf, fodder grass, tomatoes, leeks,<br>
pumpkin/squash, cabbage, iceberg lettuce, pepper, cucumbers, melons, Brassica<br>
species, melons, beans, peas, garlic, onions, carrots, tuberous plants such as<br>
potatoes, sugar cane, tobacco, grapes, petunias, geranium/pelargoniums, pansies<br>
and impatiens.<br>
In addition, the active compound may also be used for the treatment seeds from<br>
plants, which tolerate the action of herbicides or fungicides or insecticides owing to<br>
breeding, including genetic engineering methods.<br>
For example, the active compound can be employed in treatment of seeds from<br>
plants, which are resistant to herbicides from the group consisting of the<br><br>
sulfonylureas, imidazolinones, glufosinate-ammonium or glyphosate-<br>
isopropylammonium and analogous active substances (see for example, EP-A-<br>
0242236, EP-A-242246) (WO 92/00377) (EP-A-0257993, U.S. Pat. No. 5,013,659) or<br>
in transgenic crop plants, for example cotton, with the capability of producing Bacillus<br>
thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which make the plants resistant to certain pests (EP-A-<br>
0142924, EP-A-0193259),<br>
Furthermore, the active compound can be used also for the treatment of seeds from<br>
plants, which have modified characteristics in comparison with existing plants consist,<br>
which can be generated for example by traditional breeding methods and/or the<br>
generation of mutants, or by recombinant procedures). For example, a number of<br>
cases have been described of recombinant modifications of crop plants for the<br>
purpose of modifying the starch synthesized in the plants (e.g. WO 92/11376, WO<br>
92/14827, WO 91/19806) or of transgenic crop plants having a modified fatty acid<br>
composition (WO 91/13972).<br>
The seed treatment application of the active compound is carried out by spraying or<br>
by dusting the seeds before sowing of the plants and before emergence of the plants.<br>
Compositions which are especially useful for seed treatment are e.g.:<br>
A	Soluble concentrates (SL, LS)<br>
D	Emulsions (EW, EO, ES)<br>

Conventional seed treatment formulations include for example flowable concentrates<br>
FS, solutions LS, powders for dry treatment DS, water dispersible powders for slurry<br>
treatment WS, water-soluble powders SS and emulsion ES and EC and gel<br>
formulation GF. These formulations can be applied to the seed diluted or undiluted.<br>
Application to the seeds is carried out before sowing, either directly on the seeds or<br>
after having pregerminated the latter<br>
In a preferred embodiment a FS formulation is used for seed treatment. Typcially, a<br>

thereof are in particular also suitable for being used for combating parasites in and on<br>
animals.<br>
An object of the present invention is therfore also to provide new methods to control<br>
parasites in and on animals. Another object of the invention is to provide safer<br>
pesticides for animals. Another object of the invention is further to provide pesticides<br>
for animals that may be used in lower doses than existing pesticides. And another<br>
object of the invention is to provide pesticides for animals, which provide a long<br>
residual control of the parasites.<br>

protecting animals against infestation and infection by parasites, which comprises<br>
orally, topically or parenterally administering or applying to the animals a parasiticidally<br>
effective amount of a compound of formula I or the enantiomers or veterinarily<br>
acceptable salts thereof or a composition comprising it.<br>
The invention also provides a process for the preparation of a composition for treating,<br>
controlling, preventing or protecting animals against infestation or infection by<br>
parasites which comprises a parasiticidally effective amount of a compound of formula<br>
I or the enantiomers or veterinarily acceptable salts thereof or a composition<br>
comprising it.<br>
Activity of compounds against agricultural pests does not suggest their suitability for<br>
control of endo- and ectoparasites in and on animals which requires, for example, low,<br>
non-emetic dosages in the case of oral application, metabolic compatibility with the<br>
animal, low toxicity, and a safe handling.<br>
Surprisingly it has now been found that compounds of formula I are suitable for<br>
combating endo- and ectoparasites in and on animals.<br>
