				<td>Tool with Multi-Layered Metal Oxide Coating<br>
The invention relates to a cutting tool having a base body and a multilayered coating<br>
applied thereto, wherein at least two layers of the multilayered coating which are<br>
arranged one on top of the other contain, or consist of, metal oxide of the same metal<br>
or of different metals.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Cutting tools consist of a base body which is made, for example, of hard metal,<br>
cermet, steel or high-speed steel. In order to increase durability, or, also, to improve<br>
the cutting properties, a single-layered or multilayered coating is often applied to the<br>
base body. This single-layered or multilayered coating may, for example, comprise<br>
hard metal material layers, oxide layers, and the like. Application of the coating is<br>
done by CVD-processes (chemical vapour deposition) and/or by PVD-processes<br>
(physical vapour deposition). A plurality of layers within a coating can be applied by<br>
means of CVD-processes alone, by means of PVD-processes alone, or by a<br>
combination of both processes.<br>
There are various variants of PVD-processes, e.g. i) magnetron sputtering, ii) arc<br>
vapour deposition (Arc-PVD), iii) ion plating, iv) electron beam vapour deposition and<br>
v) laser deposition. Magnetron sputtering and arc vapour deposition are the most<br>
frequently used PVD-processes for coating tools. Within each individual PVD-<br>
process variant there are, in turn, various modifications, e.g. pulsed or unpulsed<br>
magnetron sputtering, or pulsed or unpulsed arc vapour deposition etc.<br>
The target in the PVD-process may be a pure metal, or a combination of two or more<br>
metals. If the target comprises several metals, then all those metals are incorporated<br>
at the same time into the layer of a coating constructed during the PVD-process. The<br>
ratio of the proportions of metals to one another in the constructed layer depends<br>
upon the ratio of the proportions of metals in the target, but it also depends on<br>
conditions in the PVD-process, since individual metals are released from the target in<br>
greater amounts under certain conditions, and/or are deposited on the substrate in<br>
greater amounts than other metals.<br>
In order to produce certain metal compounds reactive gases are fed to the reaction<br>
chamber during the PVD-process, e.g. nitrogen to produce nitrides, oxygen to<br>
produce oxides, carbon-containing compounds to produce carbides, carbonitrides,<br>
oxicarbides etc., or mixtures of these gases to produce corresponding mixed<br>
compounds.<br>
EP-A-0668369 discloses a PVD-coating process, wherein hard material layers<br>
consisting of nitrides or carbonitrides of the metals Ti, Zr, Hf or alloys of TiAl, ZrAI,<br>
HfAl, TiZr, TiZrAI, are produced with an imbalanced magnetron, wherein during a<br>
specific time interval of the coating process additional coating material is deposited<br>
from a cathodic arc discharge vapour deposition process onto the substrates to be<br>
coated.<br>
DE-A-102004044240 discloses the application to one or more metal oxide layers<br>
onto a cutting tool in a PVD-process, in particular by the use of magnetron sputtering.<br>
DE-A-19937284 describes an electrically conductive multi-layered build-up on a<br>
metal substrate, having a first layer consisting of a metal material, in particular<br>
chrome, the surface of which is passivated by naturally formed oxide, and having a<br>
further layer of gold or gold alloy material which is applied by means of a<br>
PVD-process. That second layer is capable of at least partially cancelling the<br>
electrically insulating effect of the naturally formed oxide film of the first layer.<br>
Coated arrangements of this kind are used, for example, as supporting structures for<br>
the screened housing of electronic components.<br>
DE-A19651592 describes a coated cutting tool having a multilayered coating<br>
comprising at least one aluminium oxide layer and hard metal material layers. The<br>
hard metal material layers are, for example, TiAIN-layers applied by means of<br>
PVD-processes. The aluminium oxide layer which is applied directly thereon is also<br>
deposited by way of a PVD-process.<br>
Problem<br>
The problem forming the basis of the present task was to provide cutting tools which<br>
are better that the prior art.<br>
This problem according to the invention is solved by way of a cutting tool of the kind<br>
mentioned in the introduction, which is characterised in that the at least two metal<br>
oxide layers, arranged one on top of the other, are produced successively by<br>
different PVD processes selected from i) reactive magnetron sputtering, ii) arc vapour<br>
deposition (arc-PVD), iii) ion plating, iv) electron beam vapour deposition and v) laser<br>
deposition, wherein modifications of the respective processes i) to v) do not<br>
constitute different PVD-processes.<br>
In the sense of the present invention, i) magnetron sputtering, ii) arc vapour<br>
deposition (Arc-PVD), iii) ion plating, iv) electron beam vapour deposition and v) laser<br>
deposition are "different PVD-processes". Within each of these PVD-processes<br>
i)tov) there are modifications, and, in the sense of the present invention, the<br>
modifications of a PVD-process are not regarded as "different PVD-processes",<br>
Modifications of the "magnetron sputtering" PVD-process are, for example, "dual<br>
magnetron sputtering", "RF-magnetron sputtering", "bipolar magnetron sputtering",<br>
"unipolar magnetron sputtering", "DC-diode-magnetron sputtering",<br>
"DC-triode-magnetron sputtering", "pulsed magnetron sputtering", "unpulsed<br>
magnetron sputtering" and mixes of the afore-mentioned processes.<br>
Similarly, various modifications and mixed forms of modifications exist for the "arc<br>
vapour deposition" (Arc-PVD), "ion plating", "electron beam vapour deposition" and<br>
"laser deposition" PVD-processes. The modifications to PVD-processes i) to v) are<br>
very well known to the person skilled in this domain, and therefore do not need to be<br>
dealt with in greater detail here.<br>
The application of a multilayered coating, and also of a coating comprising a plurality<br>
of metal oxide layers, onto a cutting tool in the form of a wear protection coating has<br>
been known for a long time. However, the application of the metal oxide layers to the<br>
same base body using different PVD-processes is new and results in completely new<br>
coatings with new properties. This new kind of coating according to the present<br>
invention opens up a wide range of possibilities for improving and/or adapting the<br>
resistance to wear, the durability and/or the cutting properties of cutting tools.<br>
The resistance to wear, the durability and the cutting properties of a coating on a<br>
cutting tool are dependent upon various factors, e.g. on the material of the base body<br>
of the cutting tool, on the sequence, type and composition of the layers present in the<br>
coating, on the thickness of the various layers, and, last but not least, on the type of<br>
cutting operation which is performed by the cutting tool. Different resistances to wear<br>
can result for one and the same cutting tool, depending upon the type of work piece<br>
to be machined, the respective machining process, and other conditions during<br>
machining, e.g. the development of high temperatures, or the use of corrosive<br>
cooling agents. Furthermore, a distinction is made between different kinds of wear<br>
which can have varying degrees of influence upon the useful life, i.e. the durability, of<br>
a tool, depending upon the machining operation which it performs. Therefore, the<br>
development and improvement of cutting tools must always be considered in terms of<br>
which tool properties are to be improved, and it should be assessed under<br>
comparable conditions to the prior art.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been seen that by combining various PVD-processes for the<br>
purpose of applying at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other<br>
to the base body the properties of the entire coating can be purposefully influenced,<br>
and cutting tools with an improved resistance to wear, an improved cutting ability and<br>
better durability can be produced.<br>
By applying the metal oxide layers using different PVD-processes, metal oxide layers<br>
with different internal stress behaviours (internal compressive stress and internal<br>
tensile stress), for example, are produced in relatively large layer thicknesses<br>
(e.g. above 5 to 10 µ or more). By slightly adjusting various lattice parameters<br>
(e.g. in Al2O3 and (AICr)2O3), whilst the lattice structure is the same, a significant<br>
tensioning of the lattice, and thus an increase in hardness, can be produced, for<br>
example. Further properties, such as red hardness, thermodynamic stability, low<br>
crack propagation and the heat expansion coefficient can be purposefully influenced<br>
in a coating according to the invention.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the two metal<br>
oxide layers arranged one on top of the other are arranged directly on one another<br>
without an intermediate layer/layers. In dependence on the deposited layers,<br>
particularly good adhesion between the layers can advantageously result in this<br>
instance.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool there<br>
is arranged, between the two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other, at<br>
least one non-oxide intermediate layer, preferably at least one metal nitride layer.<br>
By way of example, a ZrN-layer can be provided between two ZrO2-Iayers. By<br>
depositing a metal nitride layer as an intermediate layer, the deposition process of<br>
the metal oxide layers is stabilised, and "decontamination" of the target(s) can be<br>
achieved. Depending upon the material, an improvement in respect of the bonding of<br>
the oxide layers has been observed. Furthermore, depending on the material, an<br>
increase in hardness has also been found.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool<br>
one of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other is<br>
produced by magnetron sputtering, and another of the at least two metal oxide layers<br>
arranged one on top of the other, which is arranged thereabove or therebelow, is<br>
produced by arc vapour deposition (arc-PVD).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the at least<br>
two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other are produced successively<br>
by different PVD-processes in the same PVD-apparatus, without the cutting tool body<br>
being removed from the PVD-apparatus between application of the at least two metal<br>
oxide layers arranged one on top of the other, and/or without the vacuum which<br>
prevails in the PVD-apparatus during the PVD process being reduced between<br>
application of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the at least<br>
two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other comprise oxides of the<br>
elements from Groups IVa to VIla of the periodic system and/or aluminium and/or<br>
silicon.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool at least one<br>
of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other has metal<br>
oxide of just one metal.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool at least one<br>
of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other further has at<br>
least one secondary component from carbides, nitrides, oxides, carbonitrides,<br>
oxinitrides, oxicarbides, oxicarbonitrides, borides, boronitrides, borocarbides,<br>
borocarbonitrides, borooxinitrides, borooxocarbides, borooxocarbonitrides,<br>
oxoboronitrides of the elements of Groups IVa to VIla of the periodic system and/or<br>
of aluminium and/or silicon, mixed metal phases and phase mixes of the afore-<br>
mentioned compounds.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the coating<br>
comprises further hard material layers consisting of carbides, nitrides, oxides,<br>
carbonitrides, oxinitrides, oxicarbides, oxicarbonitrides, borides, boronitrides,<br>
borocarbides, borocarbonitrides, borooxinitrides, borooxocarbides,<br>
borooxocarbonitrides, oxoboronitrides of the elements from groups IVa to VIla of the<br>
periodic system and/or aluminium and/or silicon, mixed metal phases and phase<br>
mixes of the afore-mentioned compounds.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the layers of<br>
the coating have layer thicknesses of 10 nm to 50 µm, preferably of 20 nm to 20 µm,<br>
particularly preferably of 0.2 µm to 4 µm.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the coating<br>
has a Vickers hardness (Hv) of between 500 and 4000, preferably of between 700<br>
and 3500, particularly preferably of between 1500 and 3000.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the base<br>
body is produced from hard metal, cermet, steel or high-speed steel (HSS).<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the metal<br>
oxides of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other have<br>
the same crystal structure. This means that depending on the material deposited<br>
improved adhesion of the layers to one another can be achieved. Examples of metal<br>
oxides with the same crystal structure are a-AI2O3 / Cr2O3.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool, the<br>
metal oxides of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other<br>
have a different crystal structure. Depending upon the material deposited, this can<br>
be particularly advantageous for inhibiting column growth of the crystals and for<br>
avoiding columns of crystallites, which would lead to increased brittleness.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the phases<br>
within the XRD, XPS and/or TEM spectrum which have the highest intensity (the<br>
main phases) of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other<br>
have the same crystal structure.<br>
In the context of the present invention, the main phases are those phases in a layer<br>
of the coating which are clearly in excess over other phases of the same layer.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, in the coating of the cutting tool the phases<br>
in the XRD, XPS and/or TEM-spectrum which have the highest intensity (the main<br>
phases) of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged directly one on top of the<br>
other have a different crystal structure.<br>
The invention also comprises a process for the production of a cutting tool with a<br>
base body and a multilayered coating applied thereto, wherein metal oxide of the<br>
same metal or of different metals is applied successively by different PVD processes<br>
in at least two layers of the multilayered coating arranged one on top of the other,<br>
wherein the PVD-processes are selected from i) reactive magnetron sputtering, ii) arc<br>
vapour deposition (arc-PVD), iii) ion plating, iv) electron beam vapour deposition and<br>
v) laser deposition, and wherein modifications of the respective processes i) to v) do<br>
not constitute different PVD-processes.<br>
In another embodiment of the process according to the invention, one of the at least<br>
two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other is applied by reactive<br>
magnetron sputtering, and a further one of the at least two metal oxide layers<br>
arranged one on top of the other, arranged thereon or thereunder, is applied by arc<br>
vapour deposition (arc-PVD).<br>
In another embodiment of the process according to the invention, the at least two<br>
metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other are applied successively by<br>
different PVD-processes in the same PVD-apparatus, without the cutting tool body<br>
being removed from the PVD-apparatus between the application of the at least two<br>
metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other, and/or without the vacuum<br>
which prevails in the PVD-apparatus during the PVD-process being reduced between<br>
application of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other.<br>
It will be clear that all individual features, such as described herein for specific<br>
embodiments of the invention, can be combined with all the other features of the<br>
inventive embodiments described, so far as this is technically reasonable and<br>
possible, and that such combinations are considered to be disclosed within the scope<br>
of this description. Simply for the sake of better readability, we will not name each<br>
and every possible combination here.<br>

17. A process for the production of a cutting tool with a base body and a<br>
multilayered coating applied thereto, wherein metal oxide of the same metal or of<br>
different metals is applied successively by different PVD processes in at least two<br>
layers of the multilayered coating arranged one on top of the other, wherein the PVD-<br>
processes are selected from i) RMS, ii) arc vapour deposition (arc-PVD), iii) ion<br>
plating, iv) electron beam vapour deposition and v) laser deposition, and wherein<br>
modifications of the respective processes i) to v) do not constitute different<br>
PVD-processes.<br>
18. A process according to Claim 17, characterised in that one of the at least two<br>
metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other is applied by RMS, and a further<br>
one of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other, arranged<br>
thereon or thereunder, is applied by arc vapour deposition (arc-PVD).<br>
19. A process according to one of Claims 17 or 18, characterised in that the at<br>
least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other are applied<br>
successively by different PVD-processes in the same PVD-apparatus, without the<br>
cutting tool body being removed from the PVD-apparatus between the application of<br>
the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on top of the other, and/or without<br>
the vacuum which prevails in the PVD-apparatus during the PVD-process being<br>
reduced between application of the at least two metal oxide layers arranged one on<br>
top of the other.<br>
<br>
The present invention relates to a cutting tool having a base body and a multilayered<br>
coating applied thereto, wherein at least two layers of the multilayered coating<br>
arranged one on top of the other contain, or consist of, metal oxide of the same metal<br>
or of different metals. In order to create cutting tools which are better than those of<br>
the prior art, it is proposed according to the invention that the at least two metal oxide<br>
layers arranged one on top of the other be produced successively by different<br>
PVD-processes, selected from i) reactive magnetron sputtering (RMS), ii) arc vapour<br>
deposition (arc-PVD), iii) ion plating, iv) electron beam vapour deposition and v) laser<br>
deposition, wherein modifications of the respective processes i) to v) do not<br>
constitute different PVD-processes.</td>
