Pressure swing adsorption is a well-known method for the separation of bulk gas mixtures and for the purification of gas streams containing low concentrations of undesirable components. The method has been developed and adapted for a wide range of operating conditions, product purity, and product recovery. Many pressure swing adsorption systems utilize two or more adsorber beds operated in a cyclic sequence in order to maintain a constant product flow rate while selected beds undergo various steps including adsorption, depressurization, desorption, purge, pressure equalization, repressurization, and other related steps. Multiple adsorbed beds using numerous process steps are required to achieve high purity and/or recovery of valuable gaseous products such as hydrogen, carbon oxides, synthesis gas, light hydrocarbons, and the like. The high cost of generating the feed gas mixtures containing these<br><br>
valuable components and the high purity requirements for certain products usually justify the complexity and capital expense of multiple-bed pressure swing adsorption systems.<br>
A number of single-bed pressure swing adsorption (PSA) processes have been developed and are known in the art. Many of these processes operate partially at pressures below atmospheric and are described as vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) or vacuum-pressure swing adsorption (VPSA) processes. In the present specification, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) is used as a generic term to describe all types of cyclic adsorption systems regardless of operating pressure levels.<br>
Other gaseous products amenable to recovery by PSA do not require the high purity and/or recovery of the above-named products. In the recovery of oxygen and nitrogen from air by PSA, for example, a lower purity product containing 90 to 95 vol% oxygen is acceptable for many end uses, and simpler PSA systems can be used to provide such a product. These simpler PSA systems have significantly lower capital and operating costs than the multiple-bed systems earlier described. The simplest of these PSA systems for air separation utilize a single adsorber bed in conjunction with one or more gas storage vessels to allow constant product flow and provide gas for adsorber purge and pressurization during the regeneration portion of the PSA cycle.<br>
U,S. Patent 4,561,865 discloses a single-bed PSA system comprising an adsorber and a surge tank operated with a feed compressor in a three-step cycle. First, compressed feed air is introduced into the adsorber, which increases the pressure in the adsorber, and simultaneously adsorber effluent is withdrawn into the surge tank. A portion of the gas is withdrawn from the surge tank as an oxygen-enriched product. The adsorber feed is then discontinued and the adsorber is vented countercurrently (i.e. through the adsorber feed end) to the atmosphere. During this venting step, purge gas from the surge tank is introduced into the product end of the adsorber. Upon completion<br><br>
of the vent/purge step, the adsorber and the surge tank are pressure equalized through the adsorber product end (i.e. countercun-ently). The steps are repeated in a cyclic manner. U.S. Patent 4,511,377 describes a modular apparatus using this PSA process.<br>
A single-bed PSA system is described in U.S. Patent 4,892,566 which utilizes an adsorber in conjunction with a surge tank, feed compressor, and switch valves to carry out a series of steps. First, compressed feed air is introduced into the adsorber, which increases the pressure in the adsorber while at the same time adsorber effluent is withdrawn into the surge tank. A portion of the gas is withdrawn from the surge tank as an oxygen-enriched product. The adsorber feed is discontinued and the adsorber outlet closed, and the adsorber is vented countercurrently (i.e. through the adsorber feed end) to the atmosphere. Gas from the surge tank is introduced into the adsorber countercurrently (i.e. through the adsorber product end) and the pressures in the adsorber and surge tank are equalized. The adsorber is then pressurized with feed air through the feed end and pressure equalized with the surge tank. The adsorber is further pressurized to a pressure above that of the surge tank, and finally the adsorber and surge tank are pressure equalized. The steps are then repeated in cyclic fashion.<br>
U.S. Patent 5,032,150 discloses a single-bed PSA process which utilizes multiple gas storage tanks in a PSA cycle to separate air. Compressed air is fed from an air feed tank into an adsorber presaturated with oxygen-rich gas from a previous cycle and the adsorber effluent is directed into a product collector tank, from which a portion of the gas is withdrawn as an oxygen-rich product. The adsorber outlet is then closed and the adsorber is pressure equalized with the air feed tank. Next, the adsorber is rinsed with nitrogen-rich gas from a nitrogen product tank, and the displaced gas is stored in the air feed tank. The nitrogen-saturated adsorber then is depressurized countercurrently (i.e. through the adsori^er feed end) into the nitrogen product tank. Nitrogen may be<br><br>
withdrawn as a product if required. Finally the adsorber is purged countercurrently with oxygen-rich gas from the product collector tank to displace the nitrogen therein and then is pressurized countercurrently with the oxygen-rich gas to the adsorption pressure. The steps are repeated in a cyclic manner.<br>
A single-vessel rapid PSA system is described in U.S. Patent 5,071,449 in which the vessel contains dual adsorption layers and operates in alternating fashion with a continuous feed gas and two continuous product streams. A product surge tank is not used. Another rapid PSA system utilizing a single adsorbent bed operating in a cycle of 30 seconds or less is described in U.S. Patent 4,194,892. The absorber effluent optionally flows through a product surge tank to dampen flow fluctuations during adsorber cycling.<br>
A single-bed PSA system with a product surge tank and an equalization tank is disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,370,728. In the operation of this system, compressed air feed is introduced into the adsorbent bed, pressurizing the bed from an intermediate pressure up to a maximum adsorption pressure, and the effluent product is withdrawn from the bed into the product surge tank. The adsorbent bed then is isolated and depressurized cocurrently (i.e. through the product end) into an equalization tank at the intermediate pressure. Next, the bed is further depressurized countercurrently (i.e* through the feed end) to a lower desorption pressure, and the bed is purged countercunrently with gas from the product surge tank. The bed is then pressurized countercunrently to the intennediate pressure with gas from the equalization tank. Finally the bed is pressurized with feed air and the steps are repeated in a cyclic manner.<br>
Other single-bed PSA processes are described in U.S. Patents 4,065,272; 4,477,264; 5,228,888; 5,415,683; 5,658,371; 5,679,134; and 5,772,737; and in Japan<br><br>
Patent Application Kokai Nos. H9-77502 and H10-1947080; and in European Patent Application EP 0 771 583 A1.<br>
Several of tlie above-cited documents disclose multiple gas storage tanks to provide purge and repressurization gas. U.S. Patent 5,370,728, U.S. Patent 5,658,371, and European Patent Application EP 0 771 583 A1 describe tlie use of dual gas storage tanks in single-bed air separation systems for oxygen recovery. One tank stores void space gas or partial depressurization gas having lower oxygen purity and the other tank stores higher purity oxygen product gas. Stored gas having lower oxygen purity is used for partial repressurization of the adsorber while a portion of stored higher purity product gas is used for adsorber purging. U.S. Patent 5,032,150 describes the recovery of nitrogen from air in a PSA system which use multiple gas storage tanks, wherein one tank stores oxygen-rich gas for purging the adsorber and another tank stores nitrogen-rich product for displacing oxygen from the adsorber after purging is completed.<br>
The single-bed PSA processes and systems described above provide for the efficient production of an enriched gaseous product from a feed gas mixture, and improvements will encourage the wider use of these single-bed processes and systems. In particular, the efficient use of product gas for purging is important in order to maximize product recovery and to minimize power consumption of the feed/evacuation blower. The invention described below and defined in the claims which follow offers an improved PSA process and system in which purge gas from a product gas storage tank is introduced into the adsorber during depressurization, during a period of essentially constant adsorber pressure, and/or during repressurization.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a PSA process which utilizes a unique and beneficial combination of cyclic feed, depressurization, evacuation, purge, and repressurization steps to provide a final gas product enriched in one of the feed components. The process is described below with reference to the pressure swing adsorption system shown schematically in Figure 1.<br>
In the descriptions of the embodiments of the present invention given herein, the following meanings are associated with specific terms used.<br>
A feed step occurs during the time in which pressurized feed gas is introduced into the adsorber vessel. Depressurization is defined as the withdrawal of gas from the adsorber vessel accompanied by decreasing adsorber pressure. Depressurization can be achieved by venting gas from a superatmospheric pressure directly to the atmosphere or to another process vessel or enclosed volume which is at a lower pressure. Depressurization also can be achieved by evacuation, defined as the withdrawal of gas from the adsorber by mechanical means such as a vacuum pump or<br><br>
blower. Evacuation can be carried out over any range of adsorber pressures, but typically is carried out at subatmospheric pressures, i.e.. under vacuum. Repressurization is defined as the introduction of gas into the adsorber vessel accompanied by increasing adsorber pressure.<br>
Purge is defined as the introduction of a purge gas, typically product gas, into one end of the adsorber while an effluent gas is withdrawn from the other end of the vessel, Purge can be carried out at any pressure, but is most effective at subatmospheric pressures. As will be described below, purge can be carried out during depressurization, evacuation, or repressurization, and thus the adsorber pressure may increase, decrease, or remain constant during any portion of a purge step.<br>
Void space gas is defined as nonadsorbed gas contained within the interstitial or interparticle volume within the adsorber vessel, and includes gas in the piping and vessel dead volume which is not occupied by adsorbent.<br>
The effluent gas from the adsorber vessel, which also can be defined as adsorber product gas, is stored in a product gas storage tank. Gas withdrawn from this tank for external consumption is defined as a final gas product.<br>
The process steps of the first embodiment of the invention are described in detail below with reference to Fig. 1. The description is illustrated by the recovery of oxygen from air, but the process can be used to separate other gas mixtures as explained later. 1) Air Feed<br>
Atmospheric air. preferably filtered by known methods to remove harmful particulate material, flows through feed line 1, inlet silencer 3, line 5, open valve 7, and line 9 into the inlet of blower 11. Blower 11, which typically is a rotary lobe Roots-type blower, compresses the air to a feed pressure typically in the range of 18 to 23 psla. An aftercooler (not shown) following the blower optionally can be used. Pressurized feed<br><br>
gas flows through open valve 15 and through lines 17 and 19 into adsorber vessel 21 containing adsorbent material which selectively adsorbs nitrogen, a more strongly adsorbed component in the air feed. Adsorber vessel 21 is initially at a typical intermediate pressure of about 14.5 to 15.5 psia as a result of a previous repressurization step (described below), and the pressures in adsorber vessel 21 and gas storage tank 31 are essentially equal. Pressurized feed air increases the pressure in the adsorber vessel to the full adsorption pressure of about 18 to 23 psia over a period of about 13 to 20 seconds.   Water present in atmospheric air can be removed upstream of adsorber vessel 21 by known methods, or alternatively can be removed by the use of a layer of adsorbent at the adsorber net end which preferentially adsorbs water.<br>
As the pressurized air feed passes through the adsorber vessel, it is enriched in oxygen, a less strongly adsorbed component in the air feed. Oxygen-enriched adsorber effluent typically containing 85 to 95 vol% oxygen is withdrawn through line 23, valve 25, and line 27. A portion of the adsorber effluent gas flows through line 29 into gas storage tank 31. The remainder passes through flow control valve 33 and line 35 to provide a final oxygen product gas.<br>
The air feed step continues until the adsorbent approaches a predetermined level of nitrogen breakthrough and before complete adsorption equilibrium with feed air is reached in the adsorber. At this point the air feed step is terminated by closing valve 15 and opening valve 39. The typical duration of the air feed step is about 13 to 20 seconds.<br>
Adsorber vessel 21 contains one or more adsorbents which preferentially adsorb nitrogen and thus enrich the adsorber effluent in oxygen. These adsorbents can be selected from the group consisting of monovalent or bivalent cation-exchanged zeolites<br><br>
having type A, type X, or mordenite structure. Specific examples are NaX, NaA, CaX, and CaA type zeolites.<br>
2.	Partial Depressurization/Provide Product<br>
During this short step of about 0.5 to 2.0 seconds, adsorber vessel 21 is cocurrently depressurized (i.e. in the same flow direction as the feed step) by about 0.2 to 1.0 psi, wherein oxygen-rich void space gas (and a small amount of desorbed nitrogen) flows through line 27 as additional oxygen product. This step, which is optional, recovers valuable oxygen product and eliminates noise which would occur if the gas were to be vented to the atmosphere. This step is terminated by closing valve 25 and opening valve 37.<br>
3.	Further Depressurization<br>
Additional gas is withdrawn countercurrently (i.e. in a direction opposite the flow direction of the feed step) to further depressurize the adsorber and desorb the nitrogen adsorbed during the air feed step, thereby regenerating the adsorbent for the next air feed step. This gas is removed through line 19, valve 37, and line 9 by blower 11, which discharges the depressurization gas through line 13, valve 39, line 41, and silencer 43, from which it is vented to the atmosphere through line 45. Evacuation continues until a minimum adsorber pressure of about 4 to 8 psia is attained. Alternatively, adsorber vessel 21 can be partially depressurized directly to the atmosphere by opening valves 7, 15. and 37 (and preferably valve 39 as well). This would allow higher flow rates and quicker desorption. When the adsorber pressure approaches atmospheric pressure, valves 7 and 15 would be closed with valve 39 open, after which the further depressurization would be completed by evacuation using blower 11 as described above. The further depressurization step is typically 20 to 36 seconds in duration, and is terminated by partially opening valve 25,<br><br>
4.	Countercurrent Product Purge<br>
A flow of product gas from gas storage tank 31 is drawn through partially open valve 25 to provide a countercurrent purge which sweeps the adsorbent and further desorbs residual nitrogen. The purge gas admission rate is controlled approximately at the capacity of blower 11 such that the pressure in adsorber vessel 21 remains essentially constant at the minimum adsorber pressure between about 4 to 8 psia. The term essentially constant as used here means that the adsorber pressure varies by no more than about ± 0.5 psi during this purge step. The duration of the purge step is between about 3 and 10 seconds, and the step is terminated by fully opening valve 25.<br>
5.	Countercurrent Product Purge and Partial Product Repressurization<br>
Product gas flows through fully open valve 25 and into adsorber vessel 21 at a rate faster than blower 11 can withdraw gas, thereby increasing the pressure in the vessel. This step lasts for about 2 to 5 seconds, during which the pressure in the adsorber vessel increases by about 1.5 to 3.0 psi to an intermediate pressure.   During this period, purge of adsorber vessel 21 continues, which sweeps the adsorbent and desorbs residual nitrogen. By raising the adsorber pressure during the purge step, the power consumption of blower 11 is greatly reduced. In addition, raising the bed pressure during the repressurization step extends the duration of the step, and allows slower repressurization. This in turn helps to push the residual nitrogen front back towards the adsorber inlet and shortens overall cycle time. The step is terminated by closing valve 37 and opening valve 7, thereby idling blower 11. 6. Product Repressurization<br>
Product gas from gas storage tank 31 flows through lines 27 and 29, valve 25, and line 23 into adsorber vessel 21, thereby increasing the pressure in the vessel to about 8 to 15 psia. The level of product repressurization determines the product purity<br><br>
obtained in the air feed step; higher repressurization will yield a higher product purity. This product repressurization step generally has a dura^on of 3 to 6 seconds, and is terminated by opening valve 15 and dosing valve 39. 7. Dual-ended Repressurization<br>
Repressurization of adsorber vessel 21 continues with product gas flowing countercurrently into the vessel from gas storage tanl
As pressurized air feed continues to flow into the adsorber, oxygen-rich adsorber effluent begins to flow out of the adsorber At this point, the dual-ended repressurization step is complete, the air feed step 1 begins, and the cycle is repeated.<br>
During steps 1 through 7 described above, final oxygen product gas is withdrawn continuously through valve 33 and line 35. During steps 1 and 2, the total gas flow from adsorber vessel 21 through lines 23 and 27 provides gas to storage tank 31 via line 29 and oxygen product via line 35. During steps 3 through 7, final oxygen gas product is withdrawn from gas storage tank 31 via lines 29 and 36. During steps 4 th^^ough 7, gas is also withdrawn from gas storage tank 31 via lines 29 and 27 for adsorber vessel purge<br><br>
and repressurization. Gas storage tank 31 is designed to be of sufficient volume to provide purge and repressurization gas while providing final oxygen product at the required pressure and flow rate.<br>
The PSA cycle described above is operated by valves 7,15, 25, 37, and 39 which are opened and closed at the required times by control signals from control system 51 using hardware and software systems known in the art. Any microprocessor-based controller which has digital as well as analog signal capability can be used, and software can be readily developed using standard commercially-available packages,<br>
A summary of the PSA cycle described above is given in Table 1. which indicates the valve position and time duration for each cycle step for the cycle described above. A plot of the absolute pressures in adsorber vessel 21 and gas storage tank 31 as a function of time is shown in Fig. 2.<br>

During further depressurization step (3). the adsoriDer pressure drops from the adsorber feed pressure to about atmospheric pressure during period t2-13 and then is<br>
evacuated to the minimum adsorber pressure during period t3-14.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, a flow of product gas from gas storage tank 31 is withdrawn through partially open valve 25 during at least a portion of further depressurization step (3) to provide a countercurrent purge gas which sweeps the adsorbent and desorbs residual nitrogen. The purge gas flow rate is controlled by valve 25 such that the pressure in adsorber vessel 21 continues to decrease by net gas withdrawal from the vessel. A summary of this alternative cycle is given m Table 2, which indicates the valve position and time duration for each cycle step for the cycle. A plot of the absolute pressures in adsorber vessel 21 and gas storage tank 31 as a function of time is shown in Fig. 3. The duration of this depressurization/purge step (3a) can be between about 2 and about 6 seconds. While the depressurization/purge step is shown Table 2 and Fig. 3 as occunring immediately before the adsorber reaches its minimum pressure, the step can occur during any portion of the further depressurization step<br>

Thus a beneficial feature of the present invention is the introduction of purge gas from product gas storage tank 31 while the adsorber is being depressurized in steps (3) and/or (3a), while the adsorber is being evacuated at the minimum adsorber pressure in step (4), or during the countercurrent product purge and partial product repressunzation in step (5). Various alternative purge options are possible in which purge gas is introduced into adsorber vessel 21 from gas storage tank 31 during any one of, or any combination of, steps (3), (3a), (4), and (5). Preferably purge gas is Introduced during steps (4) and (5) as described in the first embodiment of the invention described earlier Alternatively, purge gas can be introduced only during steps (3a), (4), and (5).<br><br>
EXAMPLE The single-bed PSA system of Fig. 1 was operated according to the cycle of Table 2 and Fig. 3. A single adsorber vessel was used which contained 600 lbs of activated alumina (loaded at the inlet end for water removal) and 3500 lbs of an X-type zeolite adsorbent in which about 85.6% of the exchangeable ion content was lithium, about 8.0% was zinc, and the remainder was sodium and potassium. The PSA system was operated to produce 5 tons/day of 90 vol% oxygen product and utilized a product storage tank volume of 700 cubic feet. The adsorber and gas storage tank pressure profiles were determined as shown in Fig. 2. The operation during steps (3a), (4), and (5) was monitored closely and operating data were obtained for adsorber pressure and evacuation gas flow rates and compositions. Blower power was calculated from measured gas pressures and flow rates. Measured and calculated data are given in Table 3 below.<br><br><br>
The adsorber pressure profile and blower vacuum power as functions of elapsed time are shown for purge steps 3a, 4, and 5 in Figs. 4 and 5 respectively. These data illustrate the benefit of simultaneous purge/repressurization (step 5) wherein the specific power of the vacuum blower decreases significantly during this step. In addition, partial repressurization during purge shortens the duration of the overall regeneration period (steps 3 through 7 of Table 1) compared with a cycle in which purge and repressurization steps are carried<br>
An alternative and optional embodiment of the invention is shown in the schematic flow diagram of Fig. 6. In this embodiment, additional product gas storage tank 32 is utilized to complement gas storage tank 31. Gas storage tank 32, which is connected to adsorber effluent line 27 via line 28 and check valve 30, can be integrated with gas storage tank 31 as shown or can be a separate tank. The volume of tank 31 is<br><br>
typically two or more times the volume of tank 32. Check valve 30 allows flow into gas storage tank 32 only when the gas pressure in line 28 (and thus the gas pressure in line 29 and gas storage tank 31 as well) is slightly greater than the pressure in gas storage tank 32 by the small differential pressure (typically 0.25 to 0.5 psi) required open check valve 30. This ensures that the gas pressure in gas storage tank 31 is always less than or approximately equal to the pressure in gas storage tank 32, prevents backflow of gas from tank 32 into line 28, and ensures that gas flows out of tank 32 only via flow control valve 33 and line 35.<br>
During cycle steps (1) and (2) described above in Tables 1 and 2, during which the pressure in adsorber vessel 21 is greater than the pressures in gas storage tanks 31 and 32, adsorber effluent product gas flows via line 29 into gas storage tank 31 and via line 28 and check valve 30 into gas storage tank 32. Final product gas is continuously withdrawn through flow control valve 33 and line 35. The minimum pressure in gas storage tank 32 is selected at a few psi above the required pressure of final product gas in line 35.<br>
During step 3 of either cycle in Tables 1 and 2, during which valve 25 is closed, the pressures in tanks 31 and 32 will be approximately equal and will decrease at about the same rate as product gas is withdrawn via line 35. When purge is initiated in step (4) of Table 1 or step (3a) of Table 2 by opening valve 25, the gas pressure will decrease more rapidly as gas flows out of tank 31, and check valve 30 will close thereby isolating tank 32 from tank 31. The pressure in tank 32 will fall at a rate dictated by the required product flow rate via control valve 33 and line 35, while the pressure in tank 31 will fall more rapidly at a rate dictated by the required purge rate through valve 25 and into adsorber vessel 21. This feature of the invention allows the use of lower pressure gas from tank 31 for purge while utilizing higher pressure gas from tank 31 for final<br><br>
product, which is a more efficient use of available gas pressure than the earlier-described use of the single gas storage tank of Fig. 1 This feature In turn translates into a reduced power requirement for operating blower 11 in the vacuum or evacuation mode.<br>
In this embodiment, adsorber vessel 21 is pressurized during step (7) of either cycle in Tables 1 or 2 by introducing feed gas via line 19 and product gas from tank 31 via line 23. After the pressures in adsorber 19 and tank 31 equalize, effluent gas product from adsorber 19 will flow via line 29 into tank 31. When the pressure in tank 31 reaches the pressure in tank 32 (plus the small differential pressure needed to open check valve 30), product gas from line 27 will flow into both tanks 31 and 32 until the<br>
cycle of either Table 1 or 2 is completed at time tf. The next cycle then proceeds as<br>
above.<br>
A comparison of the pressure profiles of single product gas storage tank 31 (Fig, 1) and product gas storage tank 32 in the optional dual tank alternative of Fig. 6 is given in Fig. 7. It is seen that the pressure in product gas storage tank 32 (Fig. 6) fluctuates less than the pressure in product gas storage tank 31 (Fig. 1), since no gas is withdrawn from tank 32 for purging. This allows the more efficient use of available igas pressure in tank 31 of Fig. 6 for purging compared with the eariier-described use of the single gas storage tank 31 of Fig. 1, since gas can be withdrawn from tank 31 of Fig. 6 at lower pressures than tank 31 of Fig. 1. This feature in turn translates into a reduced power requirement for operating blower 11 in the vacuum or evacuation mode. Stored product gas can be utilized more efficiently because purge and repressunzation gas can be provided at lower pressures than if a single product tank were used. In addition, final product gas pressure can be controlled more effectively because the pressure of gas<br><br>
stored for this purpose fluctuates over a smaller range during each process cycle, and thus gas storage vessel volume and cost can be reduced.<br>
The embodiment of Fig. 6 using optional dual product gas storage tanks is not restricted to the single adsorber process cycles described above, and can be used with any adsorption process cycle using one or more adsorber vessels. The optional use of dual product gas storage tanks allows (1) a constant delivery of product gas at a required pressure during periods when no adsorber vessel is operating in the feed step, and (2) the use of stored product gas at lower pressures for purging adsorber vessels.<br>
The PSA process cycles of the present invention are described above for the preferred application of air separation for oxygen production. These process cycles also can be used for the separation of other gas mixtures by using appropriate adsorbent(s) and cycle times. The process can be applied, for example, in the recovery of moderate purity hydrogen from petroleum refinery offgases, in the drying of air, and in the removal of heavier hydrocarbons from natural gas. Adsorbents useful for these separations include activated carbon, types A and X zeolites, and mordenite.<br>
Thus the PSA process of the present invention offers an efficient method for gas separation to yield a product containing about 80-95 vol% of the main product component at recoveries of about 40-75%, A beneficial feature of the invention is the introduction of purge gas from product gas storage tank 31 into the adsorber while the adsoriDer is being depressurized in steps (3) and/or (3a), while adsorber vessel 21 is being evacuated at the minimum adsorber pressure in step (4), or during the countercurrent product purge and partial product repressurization in step (5). Various alternative purge options are possible in which purge gas is introduced into the adsorber from gas storage tank 31 during any or all of steps (3), (3a), (4), and (5). The single-bed<br><br>
adsorption system is simple and low-capital compared with the multiple-bed systems required for higher product purity and recovery.<br>
The single bed system of the present invention is simpler than existing systems. The use of a single buffer tank, a single product purge and repressurization valve, and a single blower simplify the operation of the system. The process steps of combined purge and repressurization offer a more efficient system with a overall shorter cycle time thus increasing adsorbent productivity, which is defined as the volume of gaseous product per unit volume of adsorbent. The first purge drives off most of the water and carbon dioxide adsorbed near the adsorbent bed inlet, and the desorption of nitrogen requires vacuum purging at a higher pressure than is typical in the prior art. By utilizing higher pressure purge step it is possible to regenerate the adsorber bed efficiently at lower power costs. The cocurrent desorption step saves valuable product gas trapped in bed void volume thus increasing product recovery. The dual ended repressurization step greatly reduces repressurization time thus allowing faster cycle times and better adsorbent productivity.<br>
