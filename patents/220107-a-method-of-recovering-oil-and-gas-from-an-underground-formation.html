				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method of recovering oil and gas from an underground formation.<br>
This invention relates to oil and gas field chemicals and their use especially in increasing oil or gas recovery.<br>
In use the rate of oil recovery from oil and gas fields often reduces with time. The reduction is often associated with formation damage which can manifest itself as reduced permeability of the formation to oil or gas. In addition it is often desirable to inject water based fluids into a formation at a distance from a producing well to drive the oil into the well.<br>
For stimulation of oil recovery by injection of chemicals into a producing well to overcome problems with formation damage e.g. water blocking, very dilute aqueous solutions of nonionic or anionic surfactants have been described, in particular alkoxylated alkyl sulphates and alkoxylated alkaryl sulphonates (see USP 5092405).<br>
Alkylglycol ethers have now been found that can give substantial improvements in recovery of oil or gas from underground formations, especially in overcoming problems of formation damage.<br>
The present invention provides a method of recovering at least one of oil and gas from an underground formation comprising oil or gas, which comprises introducing into said formation at least one mono alkyl ether of polyethylene glycol in which the alkyl group has 3-5 carbons and the polyethylene glycol contains 3-6 ethyl ene oxy units (hereinafter called compound 1), and recovering oil and/or gas from said formation.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of increasing the recovery of at least one of oil and gas from an underground formation comprising it, which comprises introducing into said formation at least one compound 1, and recovering oil and/or gas from said formation.<br>
The compound is a monoalkyl ether of a polyethylene glycol, in which the alkyl group is a straight or branched chain alkyl group of 3-5 carbons, e.g. n or iso propyl, n, iso, sec., tert - butyl, n, iso, sec., tert- pentyl (amyl), especially n-butyj. There are 3-6 e.g. 4 or 5 ethylene oxy units in compounds 1, though 3 are most preferred. Examples of suitable compound 1 are the mono-n-butyl ether of triethylene glycol, also known as n butyl triglycol ether, and the mono-n butyl ethers of tetraethylene glycol and penta ethylene glycol. The compound 1 may be substantially pure or may be a mixture with at least one corresponding alkyl ether of another polyethylene glycol, especially with 3-6 ethylene oxy units. In particular the mixture may comprise at least 60% especially at least 80% e.g. 60-99%, or 80-98% of the compound(s) 1 and up to 40% especially up to 20% e.g. 1-40% or 2-20% of these other glycol ethers. The mixture may also comprise the monoalkyl ethers of a mixture of the polyethylene glycols, said glycols with a molar average of 2.6-6.4 e.g. 2.9-4.5 or 4.0-5.8 ethylene oxy units. The glycol ethers, compounds 1 are usually weakly structuring amphiphiles. The mixture may also contain small amounts eg up to 10% each of C3-5 alkyl monoalkyl ethers of polyethylene glycols with 7-20 eg 7-10 ethylene oxy units, especially with a total of up to 40% or 30% of these ethers.<br>
Compound(s) 1 may be used alone or may be used in admixture with other glycol ethers still such as mono alkyl ethers of mono and di ethylene glycol, in which the alkyl group which may be straight or branched has 1-8 carbons e.g. methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, hexyl or octyl. Examples are Ethylene glycol mono ethyl ether, Ethylene glycol mono-n-propyl ether, Ethylene glycol mono-iso-propyl ether, Ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether, Ethylene glycol mono-isobutyl ether, Ethylene glycol mono-2-butyl ether, Ethylene glycol mono-tert-butyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-n-propyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-iso-propyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-isobutyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-2-butyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-tert-butyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-n-pentyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-2-methylbutyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-3-methylbutyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-2-pentyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-3-pentyl ether, Diethylene glycol mono-tert-pentyl ether. Mono-methyl or mono ethyl ethers of triethylene glycol may also be used. The amounts of compound(s) 1 in these mixtures may be at least 60% especially at least 70% e.g. 60-98% or 70-98%, and the amount of the other glycol ether may be up to 40% e.g. up to 20% such as 1-40% or 2-30% by weight of the<br>
total mixture. In the present invention it is possible to use co-product streams from glycol ether manufacturing processes which contain a high proportion of glycol ethers, especially alkyl triglycol ethers such as e.g. n-butyltriglycol ether. Such a co-product stream may comprise a majority of n-butyltriglycol ether with smaller amounts of other alkyl triglycol ethers. One such co-product stream comprises 70-80% e.g. about 75% w/w of n-butyltriglycol ether, 1-5% e.g. about 2.5% w/w of butyldiglycol ether, 15-25% e.g. about 19% of butyl tetraglycol ether and 1-5% about 2% of butyl pentaglycol ether. A mixture of about 75% w/w n-butyl triglycol ether, about 2.5% w/w of butyl diglycol ether, about 19% butyl tetraglycol ether and about 2% of butyl pentaglycol ether, hereinafter called Mixture 2 is preferred.<br>
The compound 1 may have an hydrophilic lipophilic balance (HLB) value of 12-17 preferably 14-16.5, especially 14.5-16. The compound 1 is preferably a compound capable when mixed with distilled water and octane in at least one proportion of forming 3 liquid phases at a temperature, which is at least one value in the range 20-200°C, e.g. especially 50-150°C or 100-130°C. Relative weight proportions of the compound 1, distilled water and octane giving these 3 phases can be 10-50:60-20:50. The compound 1 may also have a cloud point in admixture with distilled water/or especially with water containing up to salt saturation eg up to 40g/l sodium chloride, of 0-250°C, especially 50-150°C, in particular below the reservoir temperature, but may be miscible with the distilled water or formation water at up to 130°C.<br>
The compound 1 may be injected into the formation undiluted, but may also be mixed with water in an aqueous formulation containing at least 1%, particularly 6% and especially at least 15% by weight of compound 1; the formulation may contain 1-99% e.g. 1-60%, particularly 6-50% and especially 15-50% and preferably 25-45% of compound 1. The aqueous medium with the compound 1 may be fresh, tap, river, sea, produced or formation water, with a total salinity of 0-250g/l e.g. 5-50g/l such as 10-45 g/1 (especially with a high barium content such as 50-3000 ppm Ba) and pH of 0.5-10 e.g. 3-8 such as 4-6. The formulation may contain a weight amount of compound 1 greater than (preferably at least 5 or 10% greater than) the concentration of compound 1 in the lowest "aqueous" phase of the 3 phase mixture of compound 1, water and octane at a specific temperature of 50-150°C e.g. 100-130°C. The formulation is usually a one phase liquid whose liquid is preferably consists essentially of water, and is in particular substantially<br>
free of any polar organic solvent, in particular an alcohol such as isopropanol.<br>
The formation into which the compound 1 is introduced may be consolidated or unconsolidated, and rock or sand. Examples of rocks are sandstones and carbonates e.g. chalk or limestone, both in homogeneous and fractured form. The sand may be dirty or clean, and may be homogeneous laminated or unconsolidated. The formation is porous to water, oil and gas and may have a sea water permeability in the range 1-5000 mD eg. 5-500mD. The formation surface to be contacted by the compound 1 may be of one of 3 wettabilities, namely water wet, mixed oil/water wet or oil wet. The formation may be at a temperature of 20-250°C, e.g. 60-200°C or 80-180°C such as 110-140°C and the formation surface to be contacted by the compound may be 30-50°C below this. Connate/formation water may contain 5-200g/l salts, in particular 40-SOOOppm barium, and a pH of 0.5-10 especially 3-6.<br>
The formation may have been previously damaged following entry of externally applied aqueous fluid, such as following drilling completion workover or production operations e.g. drilling fluid filtrate or workover, kill, fracture or completion fluids, or by internal fluids such as connate water. The damage may be reduced permeability to oil or gas following blockage of the pores by water (water trapping), or oil wetting of rock, or blockage of the pores by oil (oil trapping). The damage may also result from solids invasion, overbalance pressure, aqueous phase trapping and alteration of wettability.<br>
In the methods of the invention, the glycol ether or formulation may be introduced into the formation comprising oil and/or gas e.g. into the formation surrounding a production well, such as within 100m especially within 10m of said well, as in well stimulation and squeeze treatments, but may also be introduced into a formation distant from said formation from which oil/gas is recovered, such as more than 100m particularly more than 1 or 2 Km therefrom, eg 0.1 -5 Km such as 1-3 Km therefrom, as in tertiary oil recovery, in which the glycol ether or formulation is introduced into a secondary or injection well and forced towards the formation comprising the oil/gas to drive it towards a producing well.<br>
Well stimulation involves increasing the production of oil and/or gas from a well. Examples of stimulation methods are reducing water blocking,or increasing sand consolidation or introducing acidising. Water blocking reduces the permeability of a formation caused by the invasion of water into the pores. Sand consolidation is a treatment such as the injection of a resin e.g epoxy or<br>
formaldehyde resins into a well, by which loose, unconsolidated grains of a producing formation are made to adhere to reduce migration or elution of sand into the well bore and hence to prevent a well from producing sand but allowing it to produce oil and/or gas. Acidising is a method by which a formation is treated with acid e.g hydrochloric acid, usually under pressure, in order to increase the permeability of the formation.<br>
In well stimulation treatments, the glycol ether or formulation is introduced from a production well into the formation in order to repair the damage e.g. change the wettability of the formation or remove the water block to increase its permeability. The glycol ether or formulation is passed downhole and forced in plug flow into the formation eg. by introduction down the production well sequentially, before or after, another phase eg mud or drilling fluid, acid solution or completion brine, and shut in for a period of 0.5-4 days, after which period (called shut in) production is restarted usually with a high oil production rate. The method of the invention can reduce the frequency of shut ins and hence increase overall annual production.<br>
In squeeze treatment a similar approach to well stimulation is adopted but in this case the glycol ether formulation also comprises a production chemical such as an inhibitor of scale, corrosion, gas hydrate formation, wax or asphaltene deposition, or a hydrogen sulphide scavenger or an emulsifier. In such squeeze treatments the compound 1 is preferably one in which there are 4-6 ethylene oxy units, present in amount of at least 30% of the total glycol ether content of the liquid injected. Preferably however the process of the invention especially a well stimulation treatment is performed in the substantial absence of at least one water miscible oil field or gas field production chemical eg one as specified above.<br>
In techniques involving tertiary oil recovery,] the glycol ether or formulation is injected at a distance from the producing well and then forced, ideally in plug flow, eg. by means of subsequently injected pressurized water eg. formation water as such or containing viscosifying polymers through the formation towards the production well to repair any formation damage and free trapped oil for recovery at the production well. These techniques can improve introduction of recovery fluid eg by mobilizing residual oil, which is blocking water flow, increasing the ease of movement of recovery fluid to the production well.<br>
The glycol ethers used in the process of the invention can have the benefit of improved effectiveness at increasing the permeability to gas or oil of damaged<br>
formations.<br>
Preferably the method is not a squeeze treatment which is a process for increasing the effectiveness of production chemicals by reducing the number of squeezing and shut-in operations needed to increase the production rate from an oil well, said process comprising injecting into an oil-bearing rock fomation a water-miscible formulation comprising as components:<br>
(a)	a water miscible surfactant which is an alkyltriglycol ether especially n-butyl<br>
triethylene glycol ether, such as Mixture 2, and<br>
(b)	at least one water-miscible oil field or gas field production chemical, said<br>
components of the formulation being introduced either as a pre-formed single<br>
composition, or simultaneously in parallel or sequentially in either order into the<br>
rock formation.<br>
The invention is illustrated in the following examples. Example 1<br>
Preserved core, which was a medium grained, well cemented sandstone of porosity 14.5-15% and permeability 198-428mD from a North Sea well was cut into plugs and saturated with synthetic formation water from that well, containing in mg/1 79003 total dissolved salt, 28100 Na, 1630 K, 113 Mg, 615 Ca, 65 Sr, 770 Ba, 46050 Cl, 450 H, 1655 HCO3.<br>
Each plug was loaded into the inner tube of a coreflood apparatus comprising a pair of concentric pressurised tubes scalable at both ends through which a liquid may be passed in either direction. The tubes were then pressurised at ambient temperature at l,500psi for the annulus between the tubes (gross overburden pressure) and 500psi pressure for the core (pore pressure).<br>
1.	The core was then saturated with kerosene by flowing 90 pore volumes<br>
over 24 hours is a forward direction followed by reduction of the water content to<br>
the Swi (saturation water level) by flushing with kerosene at lOml/min in both flow<br>
directions.<br>
2.	The core and lines were than heated to 121°C and this temperature was<br>
maintained for all subsequent steps.<br>
3.	Six pore volumes of crude oil from the specific well were passed at 2ml/min<br>
in the reverse direction, and the plug shut in for 24 hrs.<br>
4.	The core was then flushed with the formation water at pH 4.5 at 0.07<br>
ml/min using 23 pore volumes in a forward direction for 72 hrs to reduce the oil<br>
content to Swo(org) (saturation oil) level, the permeability in the forward direction<br>
to the formation water being 28mD.<br>
5.	This first water flood was followed by flooding with kerosene to trap water<br>
in the pores by passing at 0.75 ml/min a total of 63 pore volumes for 18 hrs,<br>
followed by reducing the water content of the core to the Swi (saturation water)<br>
level by flushing with kerosene at an injection rate of lOml/min in both flow<br>
directions, the permeabilities being 67 and 71 mD respectively.<br>
6.	Seven pore volumes of crude oil from the well were then passed through<br>
the core in the reverse direction at 2ml/niin, followed by 24 hours shut in.<br>
7.	One pore volume of the formation water at pH 4.5 was then passed through<br>
the core at 0.07 ml/min in a forward direction to simulate water flooding, the<br>
permeability was about 12mD.<br>
8.	One pore volume of the undiluted Mixture 2 containing mono n butylether<br>
of triethylene glycol (a preferred compound 1) was then passed through the plug in<br>
the reverse direction at 0.05 ml/min followed by isolation of the core from flow<br>
lines which are then cleaned sucessively with toluene, methanol and formation<br>
water. The core was shut in for 6 hrs.<br>
9.	A third water flood was performed with formation water at pH 4.5 passed<br>
at 30 ml/min in a forward direction for 125 pore volumes. The core plug was then<br>
flushed with formation water to Sw(org) whereafter the permeability was<br>
determined for both directions by passing 2 ml/min formation water through the<br>
core. The permeabilities were 255mD in both directions.<br>
10.	The core was then saturated with kerosene by flowing 36 pore volumes<br>
over 26 hrs at 0.3 ml/min in the forward flow direction, and then flushed to Swi<br>
with kerosene at 10 ml/min in both directions, followed by determination of the<br>
permeabilities in both directions with 10 ml/min kerosene. The permeabilities were<br>
161 mD and 167 mD in forward and reverse directions respectively.<br>
Comparison of the permeabilities to kerosene and water before and after the treatment with the compound 1 shows that the latter increases the permeabilities by more than twice (for kerosene, simulating oil) and by at least 9 times (for water).<br>
These results show the value of the compound 1 in reducing water blockage (compare steps (9) and (7) (and squeeze treatments) and also tertiary oil recovery (compare steps (10) and (5). Comparative Example 1 A dry core plug which was a medium grained, well cemented sandstone and high<br>
potassium feldspar content of porosity 20% from a North Sea well was vacuum saturated with simulated formation brine from that well, containing in mg/1443230 total dissolved salt,  133644 Na, 6690 K, 18800 Mg, 127197 Ca, 3520 Sr, 162 Ba, 153030 Cl, 184HCO3.<br>
The plug was then loaded into the inner tube of a coreflood apparatus comprising a pair of concentric pressurised tubes scalable at both ends through which a liquid may be passed in either direction. The tubes were then pressurised at ambient temperature at l,500psi for the annulus between the tubes (gross overburden pressure) and 500psi pressure for the core (pore pressure).<br>
1)	The core was then saturated with kerosene by flowing kerosene over 20 hours at<br>
0.5 ml/min. The plug was then flushed to Swi (saturation water level) using kerosene at<br>
an injection rate of 10 ml/min in both flow directions. When steady state conditions<br>
achieved, keo (kerosene equilibrium permeability to oil) at Swi (saturation water level)<br>
was measured in both flow directions.<br>
2)	The coreholder and flow lines were then heated to 154 °C.<br>
3)	8 pore volumes of dead North Sea crude oil were passed in the reverse flow<br>
direction until steady state conditions achieved and the plug shut in for 24 hours at<br>
temperature.<br>
(4)       40 pore volumes of simulated North Sea oil well formation water of pH 5.5 were injected into the plug at 4 ml/hour in the forward flow direction. The kew (kerosene equilibrium permeability to water) at Swo (saturation oil level) was measured using formation water in the forward flow direction.<br>
5)	The coreholder and flow lines were then cooled to 110 °C.<br>
6)	Six pore volumes of 10 wt% "Scaletreat 837c"(commercially available from TR<br>
Oil Services) scale inhibitor in seawater solution were then injected into the core plug at<br>
30 ml/hr in the reverse flow direction followed by isolation of the plug from the flow<br>
lines and excess inhibitor flushed from the rig with synthetic formation water and the<br>
core plug was bled to the face and shut in at temperature for 12 hours<br>
7)	After shut in, the coreholder and flow lines were heated to 154 °C.<br>
8)	The inhibitor was then removed from the core plug using formation water<br>
(adjusted to pH 5.5) at 30 ml/hr in the forward flow direction and the final effective<br>
permeability of the plug to formation water (kew) measured at 0.2 ml/min in both flow<br>
directions.<br>
9)	The plug was then saturated with kerosene at 0.2 ml/min for 25 hours in the<br>
forward flow direction and then flushed with kerosene at an injection rate of 10 ml/min<br>
in each flow direction until steady-state conditions were achieved and the core's effluent contained no free brine. The keo of the core was then measured in each flow direction at 10 ml/min.<br>
10)      The core was then confined to a Hassler cell at 600 psig confining pressure and ambient pore pressure and temperature. Miscible solvent cleaning at 9.5 ml/min was then carried out with 10 pore volumes of toluene followed by 10 pore volumes of methanol. This solvent cycle was repeated twice. Ten pore volumes of a 50:50 mixture of methanol and simulated formation brine were then injected into the core plug, followed by 20 pore volumes of undiluted simulated formation brine and the kew of the core plug was measured in the forward flow direction at 9 ml/min. The permeability data are given in Table 1. Example 2<br>
The procedure of Comparative Example 1 was repeated using a plug from the same core source except that after step 5 and prior to step 6 two pore volumes of a 15 wt% solution of Mixture 2 in seawater were then injected into the core plug at 30 ml/hr in the reverse flow direction.The treated core was then shut in at temperature for 6 hours. The permeability data are given in Table 1<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
These results show the value of Mixture 2 in reducing water blockage (compare steps 8 and 4) and also tertiary oil recovery (compare steps 9 and 1) Example 3<br>
The process of Example 2 is repeated with the dilute solution of Mixture 2 in seawater between steps 5 and 6 but with 6 pore volumes of seawater without the scale inhibitor in step 6. The same conclusions as in Example 2 can be obtained from the results.<br><br><br><br><br>
