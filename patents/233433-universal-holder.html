				<td>DESCRIPTION UNIVERSAL HOLDER<br>
The present invention relates to a universal holder, particularly for attaching different vehicle parts to the chassis frame of a utility vehicle.<br>
When building utility vehicles, according to the related art, greatly varying components are attached to the chassis frame, which are also referred to in the following as vehicle parts. These vehicle parts include, for example, taillights, model or company signs, side panels, design elements, underride protection screens, compressed air cylinders, fenders, etc.<br>
Until now, attaching the individual vehicle parts to the chassis frame via individual holder devices has been known for utility vehicles. Thus, for example, the fenders of a utility vehicle are connected to the chassis frame via holders designed specially for the purpose, while a taillight or a side underride protector, for example, in turn has a holder for mounting on the chassis frame which is specially implemented for the particular element.<br>
The manifold different holders cause, in addition to the overall complex manufacturing, additional outlay in providing replacement parts, which finally has a negative result on the costs.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore	to provide<br>
holders,  particularly  for  attaching  vehicle	parts  to<br>
chassis frames of a utility vehicle, which allow	simplified<br>
manufacturing and warehousing and therefore save	costs.<br><br>
The object: is achieved by a universal holder having the features of Claim 1 and its use on a utility vehicle according to Claims 11 and 12.<br>
The present invention is based on the recognition that by standardizing a number of currently differing holders, a uniform, but universally usable universal holder may be provided, which is usable for nearly any vehicle parts to be attached to a chassis frame. Through a considered design of the universal holder based on all individual mounting requirements, providing greatly varying holders and their costly manufacturing and storage are advantageously avoided.<br>
Such a universal holder is usable according to the present invention even for mounting frames, which are in turn attached to a chassis frame.<br>
In one embodiment, the universal holder has an attachment bracket, using which it is to be attached at its intended location, particularly to a chassis frame. At least one arm is positioned on this attachment bracket, on which a vehicle part is in turn directly or indirectly mountable.<br>
A universal holder of this type may be mounted at nearly any arbitrary location, e.g., along the utility vehicle chassis  frame,  via  its  attachment  bracket.  The  arm extending away  from the attachment bracket allows  the mounting of at  least one vehicle part  in each case, independently  of  a  particular  type  and  design.  In individual cases, a connection part, which is simple to manufacture and cost-effective and produces the connection of the vehicle parts to the arm of the universal holder, may be provided for adapting the universal holder arm, which is always implemented identically, to the particular individual  mounted  component.  An  individually  required attachment device for every vehicle part on the utility<br><br>
vehicle   chassis   frame  is  therefore  advantageously superfluous and saves manufacturing and warehousing costs.<br>
In an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the attachment bracket has a first perforated mask on its side provided for attachment, which is implemented complementarily to a second perforated mask implemented on the intended attachment location, e.g., in the chassis frame. Through the masks (hole systems), which are implemented so they fit with one another, the mounting of the universal holder via its attachment bracket on the chassis frame of the utility vehicle, for example, is advantageously simplified. The attachment bracket may, e.g., without performing further drilling, be screwed onto any location corresponding with the hole pattern of the chassis frame. The arrangement and number of the holes on the attachment bracket and/or on the chassis frame is selected in this case in such a way that an optimum is achieved in regard to stability of the parts provided with the perforated mask (chassis frame, attachment bracket) and strength of the screw connection between the two parts. An attachment bracket having an increasing number of holes is met by the flexibility of the screw connection possibilities with the chassis frame. Correspondingly, (screw) connections between chassis frame and attachment bracket which are to be loaded less may be produced by a lower number of screws which are used, while the maximum number of the holes may be used for a connection which is loaded more.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the arm of the universal holder also has a universal hole pattern on one side for mounting different vehicle parts on the arm. Analogously to the previously described perforated mask on the chassis frame and/or attachment bracket, the advantageous standardization for using hole patterns which are always identical for<br><br>
different mounting purposes again results here. The vehicle parts to be attached directly or indirectly to the arm of the universal holder may maintain all of their individual attachment forms in this case and, at the same time, still all be attached to the same universal holder.<br>
The arm of the universal holder, which essentially has an oblong design, may have multiple sides on which the mounting of one or more vehicle parts is possible. E'or this case, each side may have specific hole pattern, which may be congruent with those of the other sides of the arm or may even differ therefrom.<br>
The universal holder is especially advantageous, because it is simple to manufacture, if the arm and/or the attachment bracket is implemented as a sheet steel bent part or sheet steel stamped part. Parts of this type are especially simple to manufacture and cost-effective in large piece counts. Of course, however, a form of the universal holder to be manufactured through forging, milling, casting, or other procedures, for example, is also conceivable. According to an advantageous embodiment of the present invention, attachment bracket and arm are welded to one another. In this way, a stable connection, which may also alternatively be replaced by other joining methods depending on the strength requirements, may be manufactured cost-effectively, rapidly, and easily.<br>
An especially advantageous embodiment of the present invention provides that the arm of the universal holder extends essentially perpendicularly to a side of the attachment bracket pressing against the chassis frame. Such a simple geometry makes design and also use of the universal holder easier and advantageously includes all essential areas of use. In the mounted state of the universal holder, it presses against the chassis frame of the utility vehicle via a face or side facing toward the<br><br>
chassis frame. This region of the chassis frame is typically essentially implemented as a perpendicular face, which is penetrated by the holes of the previously described perforated mask. Through the previously described arrangement of the associated arm, this arm projects essentially horizontally from the face in the mounted state. The vehicle parts for the chassis frame may thus be attached easily around the chassis frame on the universal holder. Of course, in principle an angle other than a right angle between the side of the attachment bracket pressing against the arm and the arm extending away from the attachment bracket is also conceivable.<br>
The universal holder is implemented especially advantageously if the arm essentially has a U-profile in its longitudinal direction. In this way, with low material use, especially good stability of the arm may be achieved. Furthermore, a profile of this type allows the attachment of vehicle parts to both legs of the U, and to the central web connecting the two legs, i.e., on a total of three sides. In this case, each side may have an individual hole pattern, but these may, however, be implemented identically on all three sides. As a function of the load to be received, the legs of the U-profile may have a vertical or even horizontal dimension which decreases from the attachment bracket in the direction toward the free end of the arm, in order to achieve an optimum between possible bending load suspension and material outlay.<br>
In another advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the U-profile is positioned so that the central web connecting the two legs is positioned essentially vertically in the mounted state, so that a carrying force exerted vertically from above on the arm runs essentially in the plane (floor) of the U-profile formed by the central web. In the "floor" of the U-profile formed by the central web, which is enclosed especially stably by the two legs,<br><br>
in the event of the above-mentioned load in the vertical direction, the thrust strains which arise in the event of a bending load of the arm in the floor area are absorbed especially safely and stably.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, attiichment bracket and arm jointly form a level contact face on at least one side of the universal holder. This means that attachment bracket and arm extend along a shared plane in their external dimensions on at least one side of the universal holder. The advantage of such a joint contact face is that vehicle parts or even auxiliary fasteners to be attached to the universal holder may press against the universal holder over its entire length in a formfitting way. Therefore, the attachment bracket in particular may also absorb a load which acts vertically on its part of the contact face. The arm of the universal holder is thus at least partially unloaded in regard to such contact forces. In addition, the advantage of simple and precise adiustment of a vehicle part to be attached to the universal holder results through, the contact face.<br>
In connection with the above-mentioned embodiment, a further advantageous embodiment results if the contact face of the arm is formed by the floor of a U-profile. In this case, the contact face is implemented continuously and stably in the region of the arm. As may be seen in a later description of the figures, an arm implemented in this way may be shaped like an elbow. In this case, the arm initially extends between two legs belonging to the attachment bracket and holding the arm in order to then subsequently expand laterally by the dimension of the wall thickness of such a legs, so that a leg of the attachment bracket having the arm adjoining thereto forms the above-mentioned shared contact face. Arm and attachment bracket may be welded to one another or connected to one another by any other suitable method. In principle, the one-piece<br><br>
embodiment of the universal holder according to the present invention is also conceivable.<br>
According to the present invention, the attachment bracket of the universal holder may be attached in at least two different orientations to the chassis frame of the utility vehicle. In the universal holder according to the present invention, if the arm extends away from the chassis frame above an imaginary horizontal central plane through the universal holder in the mounted state, through the analogous mounting "upside down", the universal holder is positioned in such way that the arm correspondingly extends away from the chassis frame below the above-mentioned plane. With a suitable perforated mask implementation in the attachment bracket and/or in the chassis frame, instead of the above-mentioned positioning rotated by 180°, a mounting around 90° or 270° or any other dimension permitted by the perforated mask may also be achieved. This advantageously elevates the flexibility in the different mounting requirements.<br>
The positioning of the arm in relation to the attachment bracket may also be selected freely (particularly if an arm having a U-profile is used), so that the central web forming the floor of the U-profile may represent the top, bottom, right, or left side of the arm in the mounted state. In addition, besides a U-profile, the arm may also have a square profile, T-profile, I-profile, or another profile suitable for absorbing load forces transmitted from the vehicle parts, e.g., it may even be implemented like a half shell.<br>
A utility vehicle according to the present invention has at least one universal holder of the previously described type, via which the above-mentioned vehicle parts are attached to the chassis frame of the utility vehicle.<br><br>
The universal holder may be manufactured from metal, plastic, glass-fiber reinforced plastic, composite material, or other materials.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments result from the subclaims.<br>
In the following, the present invention is to be explained in exemplary embodiments on the basis of descriptions of the figures.<br>
Figure 1 shows a universal holder according to the present invention in a perspective view;<br>
Figure 2 shows the universal holder according to Figure 1 in a side and front view;<br>
Figure 3  shows the above-mentioned universal holder in a top view/Figure 4  shows a utility vehicle having multiple universal holders according to the present invention;<br>
Figure 5 shows an exemplary application of the universal holder for a rear wheel fender in multiple views;<br>
Figure 6 shows the application of two universal holders for receiving a compressed-air cylinder in multiple views;<br>
Figure 7 shows the application of a universal holder for an underride protection plate;<br>
Figure 8 shows a further application of the universal holder for an underride protector; and<br>
Figure 9 shows the joint usage of a universal holder for multiple vehicle parts.<br><br>
A universal holder 1, shown in detail in Figures 1 through 3, has an attachment bracket 3 and an arm 2, which extend away from the attachment bracket 3 projecting essentially laterally.<br>
In the example shown, the attachment bracket 3 has a U-shaped cross-section, viewed from above, having a transverse web 3a and the two side jaws 3b, 3c, angled thereon, which run parallel to one another. The inner end region of the arm 2 is received between the latter. The transverse web 3a of the attachment bracket 3 diametrically opposite the arm 2 presses against a longitudinal girder of a chassis frame of the utility vehicle in the application shown.<br>
The attachment bracket 3 has a perforated mask 5 in the transverse web 3a, which is complementary to a perforated mask implemented at the intended attachment location, e.g., on a longitudinal girder of the chassis frame.<br>
In the example shown, the arm 2 is implemented as a half shell which is open to the side and inward and is U-shaped in cross-section, having an upper leg 2a, a lower leg 2b, a transverse web 2c, and an outer web 2d.<br>
A hole pattern 4 is implemented in both legs 2a, 2b, which is usable for variable mounting of vehicle parts.<br>
In the example shown, attachment bracket 3 and arm 2 are welded to one another.<br>
In Figure 2, the universal holder 1 shown in Figure 1 is illustrated in a side and a front view. The side view in the right part of Figure 2 shows the attachment bracket 3 and the arm 2 of the universal holder 1 and makes it clear that a further hole pattern 4' is implemented in the floor 2c of the U-profile of the arm 2. The hole pattern 4' may<br><br>
be implemented corresponding to the hole pattern 4 or different therefrom. The arm 2 of the universal holder 1 shown is thus provided with holes on three sides, in order to allow the mounting of vehicle parts. Instead of holes, oblong holes or differently shaped recesses may also be provided.<br>
The half-shell shape of the arm 2 and the perforated mask 5 in the attachment bracket 3 may be recognized well in the front view of the universal holder 1 in the left part of Figure 2 .<br>
In the top view of the universal holder 1 according to the present invention in Figure 3, it may be seen that the floor 2c of the arm 2 forms a shared level contact face 6 with the section 3c of the attachment bracket 3, because of which the arm 2 is deflected laterally outside the attachment bracket 3 by a corresponding dimension. A vehicle part or a mounting auxiliary part may thus press against this lateral face 6 in a formfitting way over the entire length of the universal holder 1.<br>
Figure 4 schematically shows a utility vehicle which has multiple universal holders 1 along its chassis frame 7. It may be seen in this case that the universal holder 1 is mounted so that the arm 2 extends away from the chassis frame (out of the plane of the drawing) either in the upper or in the lower region of the universal holder 1. A side underride protector 8 is attached in this case to the chassis frame using multiple universal holders 1 according to the present invention. Two further universal holders are each provided for mounting a rear wheel fender 9.<br>
Figure 5 shows the attachment of a rear wheel fender 9 in different views in greater detail. In all three views, the chassis frame 7 of the utility vehicle is shown, from which two universal holders 1 extend essentially horizontally.<br><br>
The universal holders 1 are mounted in this case on the chassis frame 7 in such a way that the arm 2 extends away from the chassis frame 7 essentially in its upper region.<br>
The fender 9 is then connected to the universal holders 1 by auxiliary elements H, so that the fender 9 is stably connected to the chassis frame 7 of the utility vehicle via the two universal holders 1.<br>
Figure 6 shows different views of a further application for the universal holder 1 according to the present invention. In this case, a compressed-air cylinder 10 is connected to the chassis frame 7 of the utility vehicle via two universal holders 1. The connection to the compressed-air cylinder 10 thereon is produced via one or two connection auxiliary parts H fastened to both universal holders 1.<br>
Figure 7 shows the attachment of a lateral underride protector (plate or strip), which is attached to the bottom of a universal holder 1, which is in turn attached to the chassis frame 7, via a connection auxiliary part H.<br>
Figure 8 shows a similar application in a side view, the auxiliary part H for receiving the underride protector 8 having an essentially right-angled shape here and this time being connected to the universal holder 1 on the top 2a of the arm 2.<br>
Figure 9 shows two views of the use of a universal holder 1 for simultaneously attaching multiple vehicle parts. The universal holder 1 laterally projects essentially horizontally from the chassis frame 7 of the utility vehicle shown on the right in Figure 9, a multichamber tail light 11 being attached directly to the lateral face 2c of the arm 2 lying parallel to the figure surface. In addition, an identification (name, inscription) plate 12 is<br><br>
attached via an auxiliary part H to the bottom 2b of the same arm 2.<br>
The universal usability of the universal holder according to the present invention for attaching different mounted parts to the frame of a utility vehicle is obvious from the above-mentioned examples shown in the drawing. The examples shown are, however, not to restrict the application of the universal holder thereto. Further vehicle parts, such as further operating material containers, battery boxes, wheel chocks, spare tires, air filters, and hydraulic, pneumatic, or electrical components, etc., could also be held on the frame via this universal holder.<br><br><br><br>
