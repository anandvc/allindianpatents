The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention<br>
and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
-1 -<br>
 <br>
 <br>
The present invention relates to the acid resistance coating for stainless steel<br>
products &amp; fasteners. More particular this invention relates to composition used<br>
for coating, which gives protection from acid corrosion to metal particularly<br>
stainless steel.<br>
Objective<br>
The aim of developing this composition for coating was to make "Acid<br>
Resistant Stainless Steel Products &amp; Fasteners", which can effectively<br>
sustain in an aggressive chemical environment than normal bare Stainless Steel<br>
Fasteners.<br>
 <br>
 <br>

Description<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
"Invention is related to make Stainless Steel Full Acid Proof and High Corrosion<br>
Resistant".<br>
2.	Description of the Invention<br>
Fasteners used in power supply batteries are eaten out by the Sulphuric Acid. These<br>
batteries are mostly used in Automobiles and for General Purposes.<br>
-2-<br>
 <br>
The life of fasteners becomes very short hardly 6 months in acidic &amp; chemical<br>
environment; therefore a frequent replacement of fasteners is required. This needs more<br>
number of times services, that is a costly affair.<br>
Seeing these problems, an innovative coating on Austenitic Stainless Steel has been<br>
developed which does not allow items to react with Sulphuric Acid and Stainless Steel<br>
becomes full acid proof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the composition for acid resistance<br>
coating for stainless steel products &amp; fasteners comprises of 10 to 15%<br>
"Chromium Salt 99% Pure" of Sodium Dichromate or Chromic Acid or<br>
Potassium Dichromate, etc. and 20 to 30% Cone. Sulphuric Acid (Sp. Gr. 1.98)<br>
and remaining component is De-ionized Water (range 55 to 70%) of composition.<br>
More particularly, it has been found that a more desirable composition for acid<br>
resistance coating for stainless steel products &amp; fasteners comprises of 14-15%<br>
"Chromium Salt 99% Pure" of Sodium Dichromate or Chromic Acid or<br>
Potassium Dichromate, etc. and 28 to 30% Cone. Sulphuric Acid (Sp. Gr. 1.98)<br>
and remaining component is De-ionized Water (range 55 to 58%) of composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Corrosion is a biggest problem to the industry - once material disintegration<br>
starts due to corrosion, it is whether by Oxidation or Chemical/Acidic reaction - it<br>
has to be replaced.<br>
There are two types of Iron based materials - Mild/Carbon Steel and Stainless<br>
Steel.<br>
Any corrosion resistance in Mild/Carbon Steel is achieved by some coating,<br>
which may be either by plating/galvanizing or painting. With the passage of time,<br>
coating removal takes place by any of the reason - oxidation, tightening, over<br>
torquing, accident, peel off and as a result bare surface is exposed, consequently<br>
corrosion starts immediately with a rapid speed.<br>
Since Stainless Steel has much higher acid and corrosion resistance than<br>
Carbon Steel, so Stainless Steel chosen for aggressive environments like Marine<br>
and Chemicals containing Acid Vapors.<br>
Stainless Steel has broadly four types of structures - Austenitic, Martensitic,<br>
Ferritic and Duplex. Among the Stainless Steel family, Austenitic is the highest<br>
usage alloy and its consumption is about 80% of total share of Stainless Steel.<br>
This coating is applicable on all Austenitic Grades of Stainless Steel including<br>
200 &amp; 300 series. Internationally, as per IS standards 304 grade is denominated<br>
by A2 and 316 by A4. 201 grade does not have any specific<br>
denomination/marking as per IS till now.<br>
-3-<br>
 <br>
Material disintegration is a material loss whether it is due to corrosion or reaction<br>
with the chemical. When fastener (metal) surface is lost, a customer has to<br>
replace it with the new one (Fig.5).<br>
The Aggressive Chemical Environment where acid is present in the surrounding,<br>
reacts with the metal, disintegrate the product and making life shorter of high<br>
value product. There huge cost is paid in replacement of parts, labor cost, down<br>
time and difficulty of repair. Sometimes, the damaged parts are not available or<br>
not possible to repair - a high value product is scraped. This special coating<br>
does not allow reaction with the acid and gives a long-life to the product. This<br>
coating also gives higher protection to the corrosion. Cost of coating comes Rs.<br>
50/- (1 US $) per 10 kg of Stainless Steel, which is negligible if it is compared<br>
with the replacement and labor cost. Process is simple and equipment cost is<br>
very low. It can be carried out in one 10x10 sq feet room comfortably. The new<br>
acid resistant coating is boon for fasteners, which are in direct contact with<br>
sulphuric acid in Battery.<br>
Acid Test Procedure<br>
Acid resistance performance of coated fasteners is checked by dipping in 1.30 sp<br>
gr. of sulphuric acid - there should not be any reaction with the component till 24<br>
hours. In uncoated natural component, reaction is started immediately in 1.30 sp<br>
gr sulphuric acid.<br>
Acid Test Results<br>
Uncoated Natural Finish reaction in 10 minutes.<br>
Coated fasteners with above technology not reacting in 24,48, 96 Hours.<br>
Salt Sprat ASTM B 117 Method Corrosion Test<br>
Uncoated Natural Finish - Salt Spray Hours 250r to 700 Hours.<br>
Coated fasteners /sheet with above technology - Salt Spray Hours 300r to 900 Hours.<br>
Advantages &amp; Life Cycle Costing (LCC) Analysis<br>
This coating for acid resistance is 100% successful &amp; compatible with Austenitic grade.<br>
// is partially successful with other grades of Stainless Steel also and for this a further<br>
R&amp;D work is continued.<br>
1.	Battery consumption is very high and average life cycle of battery is 2 years. So<br>
this is a very big saving if special coated fasteners are used in place of natural<br>
uncoated fasteners (Fig. 2&amp;3).<br>
2.	Chemical Industries &amp; Cane Sugar Mills are continuously emitting acid vapors,<br>
where these special coated fasteners are protecting from corrosion and enhancing<br>
life of the assembly &amp; product.<br>
-4-<br>
 <br>
This coating increases life of the hardware and fixing system of an assembly. For<br>
Example, Natural finish Fasteners in Automobile Battery (based sulphuric acid) are eaten<br>
by acid within 2 months. A blue/green/whitish colour salt is formed after reaction with<br>
the elements present in the Stainless Steel alloy and deposited around the clamp (Fig. 5).<br>
It is very cumbersome &amp; costly affair for customer to replace these fasteners frequently.<br>
Cost is hardly 10% more after this coating.<br>
-5-<br>
As per LCC analysis, if uncoated Stainless Steel is replaced even twice during the life-<br>
time of a product, coated will be a much cheaper option with a least headache of<br>
replacement.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Application of Invention in the Fields<br>
1.	Austenitic Stainless Products<br>
2.	Austenitic Stainless Fasteners<br>
The Austenitic Stainless Steel is more popular because: -<br>
1.	General Purpose - All Household Utensils are made from Austenitic Grade.<br>
2.	Engineering Values - Austenitic is the only grade in steel family where High<br>
Tensile Strength is achieved by Cold Working (Forging). Otherwise, high strength<br>
is achieved in all steel by heat treatment where lot of problems are envisaged from<br>
technical point of view like Galling (Ceasing), Sudden Failures (Breaking).<br>
3.	It is more firm during the load at high temperature (800 Oc) as well as low<br>
cryogenic temperature (-30 Oc).<br>
Sewerage requirement - Acid as well as Corrosion resistant<br>
!n sewerage all types of streams are flowing into the drain, for instance, Soap &amp;<br>
Detergent (contains free alkali) from homes and Acid from industries. 316 &amp; 304<br>
grades of stainless steel can resist to corrosion but can not resist to acid. The<br>
special enviro-coated fasteners in 304 grade developed by Kundan can resist to<br>
acid also apart from corrosion and cost is less than 316 grade.<br>
This shows that Enviro-coated 304 fasteners are the best solution for the<br>
problem in both the types of acid and alkali environment of sewage. This save<br>
huge cost, easy servicing and log life.<br>
Problems with Hardware<br>
Sometimes Fasteners are used in a very aggressive environments like Acid &amp;<br>
Chemical and Marine where life becomes short because of corrosion and<br>
fasteners are bound to be replaced. If galling (jamming of Nut &amp; Bolt - Fig. 4)<br>
takes place, which is a common severe problem observed after corrosion then<br>
sometimes whole High Value Product (Assembly) has to be scraped because<br>
repairing is beyond the scope of service engineer and this is a very costlier affair<br>
to the owner.<br>
-6-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Fig 4<br>
Permanent Black Colour Fasteners for Automobiles<br>
Black Color matching with the counter part at some locations is a requirement of<br>
the automobile manufacturers. Black color in Carbon steel is achieved by Zinc<br>
plating and life of zinc plating is hardly 6 months. Coating is faded<br>
(Brownish/Whitish Color) in next 3 months and looks bad. Coating also comes<br>
out by mild rubbing during the use, shining goes off and losing aesthetic in short<br>
span. Kundan has developed a special black color coating on Stainless Steel i.e.<br>
called "Enviro Coating". It is permanent, having good shining, more corrosion<br>
resistant and fully acid resistant with sulphuric acid. This has also lower<br>
coefficient of friction and higher anti-galling effect.<br>
Anti Galling<br>
Molybdenum coating is recommended to avoid galling which is a very costlier.<br>
Enviro-coating gives equally good anti-galling effect and replacing to<br>
Molybdenum coating.<br>

Stainless like 201, 304, 316, etc component (products/fasteners) are dipped in bath for 5<br>
minutes and temperature is maintained 90°C ± 5°C. A white colour of coating with black<br>
tinge (2-3 (µ, thickness) adhesion takes place on the component. Then components are<br>
thoroughly washed with water and dried in oven for 1 hour at 150°C. These fasteners<br>
should be cleaned, free from oil and well polished before coating.<br>
