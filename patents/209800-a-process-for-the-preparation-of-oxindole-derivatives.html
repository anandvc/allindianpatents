A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF OXINDOLE DERIVATIVES<br>
SUN   PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRIES LTD.<br>
A company incorporated under the laws of India having their office at ACME PLAZA,<br>
ANDHERI-KURLA ROAD, ANDHERI (E), MUMBAI-400059, MAHARASHTRA, i<br>
INDIA.<br><br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention.<br><br>
GRANTED<br><br>
8-8-2007<br>
 1 <br>
A PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF OXINDOLE DERIVATIVES<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of oxindole derivative of<br>
formula I.	<br><br>
formula I wherein   R   is  selected  from   hydrogen,   linear,  branched  or cyclic  alky],  aryl. substituted aryl, heteroaryl, haioalkyl like CF3, alkoxy, haloalkoxy, thioalkyl   and<br>
halogen.<br>
The compound of formula I, wherein R is chloro i.e. 5-[2-[4-(l,2-benzisothiazol-3-yl)-l-piperazinyl]ethyl]-6-chloro-l,3-di hydro-2H- indol-2-one oxindole is commonly known as ziprasidone (INN name) which is used in the treatment of schizophrenia.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
United States Patent No. 4831031 (hereinafter described as '031) discloses the preparation of 5-[2-[4-(i,2-benzisothjazol-3-yl)-l-piperazinyl]ethyl]-6-chloro-l,3-di hydro-2H- indol-2-one, compound of formula I, by reacting 6-chloro-oxindole with chloroacetyl chloride followed by reducing the carbonyl group with trifluoroacetic acicVtriethylsilane to yield 5-(2-chloroethyl)-6-chlorooxindole. 5-(2"-chIoroethyl)-6-chlorooxindole is then reacted with 3-(l-piperazinyl)-l,2-benzisothiazole to give compound of formula I, ziprasidone.<br>
United   States  Patent  No.   5338846  (hereinafter  described  as   '846)  discloses preparation of compound of formula I, wherein R is chloro, by reacting 5-(2-<br>
2<br><br>
chlordethyl)-6-chlorooxindole with 3-(l-piperazinyl)-l,2-benzisothiazole followed by preparation of mono hydrate of its hydrochloride salt.<br>
Both the above patents do not disclose the preparation of compound of formula 1 from<br>
2,5-dichloronitrobenzene, compound of formula II. Further,	discloses reaction of<br><br>
6-chloro oxindole with chloroacetyl chloride in carbon disulfide solvent which is difficult to handle at commercial scale because of its inherent properties viz. highly volatile, inflammable and hazardous.<br><br>
R formula II (wherein R and X are chloro)<br>
In literature, several procedures for the synthesis of oxindole derivatives are reported. G.J.Quallich reported a process (Synthesis, 51, January 1993) involving the reaction of a substituted halo nitrobenzene with a malonate, usually dimethyl malonate, in the presence of sodium hydride, to obtain the diester of arylmalonate. The second step involves Krapcho decarboxylation of the diester of the arylmalonate with lithium chloride in dimethyl sulfoxide to obtain the malonate monoester. The nitro group of the monoester is then reduced with iron and acetic acid to yield the substituted oxindole derivative. The disadvantage of this method is the use of sodium hydride in the preparation of the diester of the arylmalonate. Sodium hydride is a highly moisture sensitive and pyrophoric compound, thereby making its use on an industrial scale highly hazardous. Further, the overall yield reported by this process is about 50%.<br>
United States Patent No. 4,160,032 discloses the preparation of 6-chloro-oxindole, wherein 4-chloro-2-nitrotoluene is treated with sodium ethoxide-and diethyl oxalate, followed by refluxing it with hydrogen peroxide and acidification, to obtain 4-chloro-<br>
3<br><br>
2-nitrophenylacetic acid. The 4-chloro-2-nitrophenylacetic acid is then subjected to reductive cyclisation using hydrogen gas under pressure, in the presence of P102, to obtain 6-chloro-oxindole. This patent discloses a route starting with 4-ch!oro-2-nitrotoluene and not 2,5-dichloronitrobenzene, compound of formula II, as prepared in the process of the present invention. Further, it reduces the nitro group in the<br>
presence of PtO2 catalyst which could probably give dehalogenated products.<br>
■# •<br>
Collins et al reported a process (J. Am. Chem. Soc, 221,78, 1956)'"wheiein nitrophenyiacetic acids were prepared from o-nitrotoluenes through pyruvic acids. These nitrophenyiacetic acids were further subjected to reduction using zinc and sulfuric acid to yield the oxindoles. The disadvantage of this process is that the nitrophenyiacetic acids were obtained in moderate yields, and in the case of 4-chloro-2-nitrophenylacetic acid, a precursor of 6-chloro-oxindole, a yield as low as 4% was reported.<br>
PCT pulication 02/14275 also discloses the synthesis of 6-halosubstituted oxindoles using 4-halo-2-nitrophenylacetic acid as the starting material. The starting material is subjected to reductive cyclisation using 50% sulfuric acid and zinc dust in the presence of ethanol as the solvent. The entire process is carried out at high temperature under a nitrogen blanket. Such a process is not feasible at industrial scale because the working up of the reaction involves extraction in organic solvents, followed by chromatographic separation of the final product.<br>
Another process for the preparation of halosubstituted oxindoles is disclosed id Czechoslovakian Patent No. 191777, wherein a" 3-halosubstituted aniline is reacted with chloroacetyl chloride, followed by refluxing the mixture with aluminum chloride in a suitable solvent to obtain the 6-halosubstituted oxindole. The disadvantage of this process is that it could also lead to formation of the regio isomer, viz. 4-chloro-oxindole; that needs to be separated from the final produci.<br>
4<br><br>
Japanese Patent Nos. 56068668 and 62028133 disclose the process for the preparation of unsubstituted oxindole using 2-chlorophenylacetic acid as the starting material. The 2-chlorophenylacetic acid is cyclised to the oxindole, using aqueous ammonia in the presence of CuCl. Such a procedure may not be feasible for dihalo compounds, wherein the dihalo compound could lead to the formation of a mixture of products, such as the undesired mono and/or diaminohalo compounds. Hence, the process is undesirable for the synthesis of substituted oxindoles.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a simple, cost-effective and non-hazardous process for  the preparation of compound of formula I.<br>
A more specific object is to prepare compound of formula I, wherein R is chloro, using a simple, cost-effective and non-hazardous process.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare compound of formula V which is an intermediate for the preparation of compound of formula I.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of compound of formula I involving synthesis of the diester of arylmalonate from 2,5-dichloronitrobenzene, compound of formula II, wherein a mild, readily available, cheap and non-hazardous base is used, as opposed to prior art use of reactive bases such as sodium hydride. The advantage of using a mild base such as an alkali carbonate or an alkaline eurth metal carbonate is thai it does not necessitate.the use of absolutely anhydrous- reaction conditions. The prior art also reports the use of two equivalents of dialkyl malonate in the synthesis of the diester of the arylmalonate, in order to suppress the formation of the dialkyl bisarylmalonate impurity. We have surprisingly found that the use of mild and readily available bases.along with 0.5 to 1.5 moles of the dialkyl malonate results<br>

in the formation of a pure product of formula 111 (greater than 99%) in high yield which is then further converted to compound of formula I.<br>
