MOLECULAR SIEVE<br>
[Field of the invention]<br>
The present invention relates to a method for preparing<br>
metalloaluminophosphate (MeAPO) molecular sieve. The<br>
metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieves of the invention are useful as<br>
catalysts in a variety of processes including cracking, hydrocracking,<br>
isomerization, reforming, dewaxing, alkylation, transalkylation, conversion of<br>
methanol to light olefins. The limited supply and increasing cost of crude oil has<br>
prompted the search for alternative processes for producing hydrocarbon<br>
products. One such process is the conversion of oxygen-containing,<br>
halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic compounds to<br>
hydrocarbons and especially light olefins (by light olefins is meant C2 to C4<br>
olefins) or gasoline and aromatics. The interest in the methanol to olefin (MTO)<br>
process is based on the fact that oxygenates, especially methanol can be<br>
obtained from coal, biomass, organic waste or natural gas by the production of<br>
synthesis gas which is then processed to produce methanol.<br>

morphology, wherein the average smallest crystal dimension is at least 0.1<br>
micron and has an aspect ratio of less than or equal to 5.<br>
US 6,334,994 relates to a microporous crystalline silico-alumino-phosphate<br>
composition, the theoretical composition of which, on a water-free basis after<br>
synthesis and calcination, is: HwSixAlyPzO2 where w and x have a value between<br>
0.01 and 0.05 and y and z are values between 0.4 and 0.6, wherein the<br>
composition is a mixed phase product comprising silico-alumino-phosphates of<br>
AEI and CHA structure prepared in one batch crystallization, not including mere<br>
physical mixtures, the product after calcination in air at 550Â° C for 4 hours,<br>

from 150Â°C. to 200Â°C. Heating up to the crystallization temperature is typically<br>
carried for a period of time ranging from about 0,5 to about 16 hours, preferably<br>
from about 1 to 12 hours, most preferably from about 2 to 9 hours. The<br>
temperature may be increased stepwise or continuously. However, continuous<br>
heating is preferred. The reaction mixture may be kept static or agitated by<br>
means of tumbling or stirring the reaction vessel during hydrothermal treatment.<br>
Preferably, the reaction mixture is tumbled or stirred, most preferably stirred.<br>
The temperature is then maintained at the crystallization temperature for a<br>
period of time ranging from 2 to 200 hours. Heat and agitation is applied for a<br>
period of time effective to form crystalline product. In a specific embodiment, the<br>
reaction mixture is kept at the crystallization temperature for a period of from 16<br>
to 96 hours.<br>
With regards to the step c), the usual means can be used. Typically,<br>
the crystalline molecular sieve product is formed as a slurry and can be<br>
recovered by standard means, such as by sedimentation, centrifugation or<br>
filtration.<br>
With regards to the step d), the separated molecular sieve product is<br>
washed, recovered by sedimentation, centrifugation or filtration and dried.<br>
With regards to the step e), calcination of molecular sieves is known<br>
per se. As a result of the molecular sieve crystallization process, the recovered<br>
molecular sieve contains within its pores at least a portion of the template used.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, activation is performed in such a manner that the<br>
template is removed from the molecular sieve, leaving active catalytic sites with<br>
the microporous channels of the molecular sieve open for contact with a<br>
feedstock. The activation process is typically accomplished by calcining, or<br>
essentially heating the molecular sieve comprising the template at a<br>
temperature of from 200 to 800Â° C in the presence of an oxygen-containing gas.<br>
In some cases, it may be desirable to heat the molecular sieve in an<br>
environment having a low oxygen concentration. This type of process can be<br>
used for partial or complete removal of the template from the intracrystalline<br>
pore system.<br>
Additionally, if during the synthesis alkaline or alkaline earth metals have<br>
been used, the molecular sieve might be subjected to an ion-exchange step.<br>
Conventionally, ion-exchange is done in aqueous solutions using ammonium<br>
salts or inorganic acids.<br>
Once the molecular sieve is made, it can be used as itself as a catalyst.<br>
In another embodiment it can be formulated into a catalyst by combining the<br>
molecular sieve with other materials that provide additional hardness or catalytic<br>
activity to the finished catalyst product. The present invention also relates to<br>
catalysts consisting of the above MeAPO molecular sieves made by the method<br>
of the invention or comprising the above MeAPO molecular sieves made by the<br>
method of the invention.<br>
Materials which can be blended with the molecular sieve can be various<br>
inert or catalytically active materials, or various binder materials. These<br>
materials include compositions such as kaolin and other clays, various forms of<br>
rare earth metals, alumina or alumina sol, titania, zirconia, quartz, silica or silica<br>
sol, and mixtures thereof. These components are effective in densifying the<br>
catalyst and increasing the strength of the formulated catalyst. When blended<br>
with non-metalloaluminophosphate molecular sieve materials, the amount of<br>
MeAPO of the present invention, which is contained in the final catalyst product<br>
ranges from 10 to 90 weight percent of the total catalyst, preferably 20 to 70<br>
weight percent of the total catalyst.<br>
The MeAPO molecular sieves synthesized in accordance with the<br>
present method can be used to dry gases and liquids; for selective molecular<br>
separation based on size and polar properties; as ion-exchangers; as catalysts<br>
in cracking, hydrocracking, disproportionation, alkylation, isomerization,<br>
oxidation; as chemical carriers; in gas chromatography; and in the petroleum<br>
industry to remove normal paraffins from distillates. More precisely they are<br>
useful as catalysts in a variety of processes including cracking of, for example,<br>
a naphtha feed to light olefin(s) or higher molecular weight (MW) hydrocarbons<br>
to lower MW hydrocarbons; hydrocracking of, for example, heavy petroleum<br>
and/or cyclic feedstock; isomerization of, for example, aromatics such as<br>
xylene; polymerization of, for example, one or more olefin(s) to produce a<br>
oligomer product; dewaxing of, for example, hydrocarbons to remove straight<br>
chain paraffins; absorption of, for example, alkyl aromatic compounds for<br>
separating out isomers thereof; oligomerization of, for example, straight and<br>
branched chain olefin(s); and the synthesis of monoalkylamines and<br>
dialkylamines.<br>
The MeAPO made by the method of the present invention are particularly<br>
suited for the catalytic conversion of oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing<br>
or sulphur-containing organic compounds to hydrocarbons. Accordingly, the<br>
present invention also relates to a method for making an olefin product from an<br>
oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic<br>
feedstock wherein said oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-<br>
containing organic feedstock is contacted with the catalyst of this invention<br>
comprising the molecular sieve of this invention under conditions effective to<br>
convert the oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing<br>
organic feedstock to olefin products. In this process a feedstock containing an<br>
oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic<br>
compound contacts the above described catalyst in a reaction zone of a reactor<br>
at conditions effective to produce light olefins, particularly ethylene and<br>
propylene. Typically, the oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-<br>
containing organic feedstock is contacted with the catalyst when the oxygen-<br>
containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic compounds is<br>
in vapour phase. Alternately, the process may be carried out in a liquid or a<br>
mixed vapour/liquid phase. In this process, converting oxygen-containing,<br>
halogenide-containing or sulphur-containing organic compounds , olefins can<br>
generally be produced at a wide range of temperatures. An effective operating<br>
temperature range can be from about 200Â° C. to 700Â° C. At the lower end of the<br>
temperature range, the formation of the desired olefin products may become<br>
markedly slow. At the upper end of the temperature range, the process may not<br>
form an optimum amount of product. An operating temperature of at least 300Â°<br>
C, and up to 575Â° C is preferred.<br>
The pressure also may vary over a wide range. Preferred pressures are<br>
in the range of about 5 kPa to about 5 MPa, with the most preferred range being<br>
of from about 50 kPa to about 0.5 MPa. The foregoing pressures refer to the<br>
partial pressure of the oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing, sulphur-<br>
containing organic compounds and/or mixtures thereof.<br>
The process can be carried out in any system using a variety of transport<br>
beds, although a fixed bed or moving bed system could be used.<br>
Advantageously a fluidized bed is used. It is particularly desirable to operate the<br>
reaction process at high space velocities. The process can be conducted in a<br>
single reaction zone or a number of reaction zones arranged in series or in<br>
parallel. Any standard commercial scale reactor system can be used, for<br>
example fixed bed, fluidised or moving bed systems. The commercial scale<br>
reactor systems can be operated at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of<br>
from 0.1 hr-1to 1000 hr-1.<br>
One or more inert diluents may be present in the feedstock, for example,<br>
in an amount of from 1 to 95 molar percent, based on the total number of moles<br>
of all feed and diluent components fed to the reaction zone. Typical diluents<br>
include, but are not necessarily limited to helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide, hydrogen, water, paraffins, alkanes (especially<br>
methane, ethane, and propane), aromatic compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The preferred diluents are water and nitrogen. Water can be injected in either<br>
liquid or vapour form.<br>
The oxygenate feedstock is any feedstock containing a molecule or any<br>
chemical having at least an oxygen atom and capable, in the presence of the<br>
above MeAPO catalyst, to be converted to olefin products. The oxygenate<br>
feedstock comprises at least one organic compound which contains at least one<br>
oxygen atom, such as aliphatic alcohols, ethers, carbonyl compounds<br>
(aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, carbonates, esters and the like).<br>
Representative oxygenates include but are not necessarily limited to lower<br>
straight and branched chain aliphatic alcohols and their unsaturated<br>
counterparts. Examples of suitable oxygenate compounds include, but are not<br>
limited to: methanol; ethanol; n-propanol; isopropanol; C4-C20 alcohols; methyl<br>
ethyl ether; dimethyl ether; diethyl ether; di-isopropyl ether; formaldehyde;<br>
dimethyl carbonate; dimethyl ketone; acetic acid; and mixtures thereof.<br>
Representative oxygenates include lower straight chain or branched aliphatic<br>
alcohols, their unsaturated counterparts.<br>
Analogously to these oxygenates, compounds containing sulphur or<br>
halides may be used. Examples of suitable compounds include methyl<br>
mercaptan; dimethyl sulfide; ethyl mercaptan; di-ethyl sulfide; ethyl<br>
monochloride; methyl monochloride, methyl dichloride, n-alkyl halides, n-alkyl<br>
sulfides having n-alkyl groups of comprising the range of from about 1 to about<br>
10 carbon atoms; and mixtures thereof. Preferred oxygenate compounds are<br>
methanol, dimethyl ether, or a mixture thereof.<br>
The method of making the olefin products from an oxygenate feedstock<br>
can include the additional step of making the oxygenase feedstock from<br>
hydrocarbons such as oil, coal, tar sand, shale, biomass and natural gas.<br>
Methods for making oxygen-containing, halogenide-cojitaining, sulphur-<br>
containing-containing organic feedstocks are known in the art. These methods<br>
include fermentation to alcohol or ether, making synthesis gas, then converting<br>
the synthesis gas to alcohol or ether. Synthesis gas can be produced by known<br>
processes such as steam reforming, autothermal reforming and partial<br>
oxidization in case of gas feedstocks or by reforming or gasification using<br>
oxygen and steam in case of solid (coal, organic waste) orf liquid feedstocks.<br>
Methanol, methylsulfide and methylhalides can be produced by oxidation of<br>
methane with the help of dioxygen, sulphur or halides in the corresponding<br>
oxygen-containing, halogenide-containing or sulphur-cbntaining organic<br>
compound.<br>
One skilled in the art will also appreciate that the olefirji products made by<br>
the oxygenate-to-olefin conversion reaction using the molecular sieve of the<br>
present invention can be polymerized to form polycjlefins, particularly<br>
polyethylenes and polypropylenes.<br>
