				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of bulk solids feeding device used for<br>
feeding bulk solids (coal) to pulverizers envisaged in coal-fired boilers. More<br>
particularly, the invention relates to a retrofit kit system for online computation<br>
and control of bulk solids feeding to pulverizers envisaged in coal-fired boilers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coal fired boilers are employed world wide by thermal power plants, sugar<br>
industries and many other industries which require steam and / or power for its<br>
operation. The bulk solids feeding device vary the quantum of bulk solids (raw<br>
coal) fed to the pulverizer in proportion to demand and compute the amount of<br>
coal fed to the pulverizer over a period of time. It is essential to maintain the<br>
weighing accuracy of these feeding device on long-term basis. To achieve this,<br>
re-calibration of the feeding device is required to be done under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
-	When any of the components in weighting system/speed measuring circuit<br>
is changed.<br>
-	At regular intervals of around six months to take care of weighing system<br>
components wear and tear/change in characteristics.<br>
The bulk solids feeding device (raw coal feeders) deliver coal in proportion to the<br>
fuel demand generated from the combustion control device envisaged in a boiler.<br>
In the existing systems, the control functions such as weighing, sensing,<br>
computing, comparing, varying speed etc., to meet the demand are performed<br>
using handwired electronic (solid state) modules. The function of calibration is<br>
achieved by tuning the potentiometers located in the electronic modules.<br><br>
In the presently available hardwired electronic (solid state) control, more than<br>
eight varieties of electronic modules (Electronic cards) are used to perform<br>
weight sensing, speed measuring, rate multiplying computation and logic control<br>
functions. These modules are mounted in the card rack assemblies, one number<br>
rack fixed inside remote power cabinet and another mounted in the feeder<br>
integral cabinet.<br>
During calibration of feeders under the conditions described above, the<br>
potentiometers located in the electronic modules need to be adjusted to arrive at<br>
the calibration accuracy. Repeated potentiometers adjustment are required on<br>
trial basis, to achieve the accepted level of accuracy. Hence the calibration<br>
process takes more time (approximately one hour). Also the output of the<br>
potentiometers drift after few months of continuous operation due to feeder<br>
vibration etc.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a system for on-line computation and<br>
control of bulk-solids feeding rate to pulverizers envisaged in coal-fired boilers,<br>
which eliminates the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a system for on-line computation<br>
and control of bulk-solids feed-rate to pulverizes envisaged in coal-fired boilers<br>
which is capable of automatic calibration of the feeding device without real-time<br>
adjustment of the electronic modules of the system.<br><br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a system for on-line computation<br>
and control of bulk-solids feed-rate to pulverizes envisaged in coal-fired boilers<br>
which provides compatible interfaces for integration with the combustion control<br>
device of the boiler.<br>

friendly manner to the operating personnel. The microprocessor/microcontroller<br>
modules take care of the control functions such as weighing, computing,<br>
comparing, sequencing, counting etc. The system is user friendly such that<br>
calibration/recalibration can be done through data entry and without the use of<br>
potentiometers. The system is further configured to:<br>
-testing of the feeding device without microprocessor/microcontroller module.<br>
-allowing a continued operation of the feeding device in the event of failure of<br>
the microprocessor/microcontroller module.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO<br>
THE NUMBERED PARTS:<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the system comprises of a bulk solids feeding device, a<br>
Remote power cabinet, an Integral cabinet, and connecting means. The Remote<br>
power cabinet (4) consists of a card rack (1) which includes a<br>
microprocessor/microcontroller module, a power supply and motor speed control<br>
module, and a plurality of additional interface electronic modules. A Man-Machine<br>
interface (2) is mounted on the door of the Remote power cabinet (4). An<br>
Integral cabinet (5) is mounted on the Feeding device, which houses a signal-<br>
conditioning module (3). The feeding device consists of a motor (10) having an<br>
eddy current clutch (11) to drive a conveyor belt, and additionally having an<br>
integral cabinet (5). A remote power cabinet (4) having a man-machine interface<br>
(2), and a card rack (1), the interconnections between the remote power cabinet<br>
(4) and the Integral cabinet (5) are made by a special screened cable (6).<br><br>
A plant-control desk (7) storing and displaying data relating to coal integration<br>
and feed rate for operator's control; and a calibration probe (9) operable to<br>
perform calibration through test weights attached to the feeding device<br>
characterized in that the card rack (1) comprises atleast one<br>
microprocessor/micro controller module, a power supply and motor speed<br>
control, and a plurality of interface electronic modules, and wherein the<br>
microprocessor/micro controller modules determines the actual feed rate based<br>
on a speed factor and a weight factor estimated during the calibration of the<br>
feeding device, the actual feed rate being compared with a fuel-demand feed<br>
rate signaled by the signal conditioning module (3) to determine a motor-speed<br>
set point by means of the power supply and motor speed control module which<br>
regulates the eddy current clutch (11) thereby regulating the speed of the<br>
conveyor belt.<br>
The microprocessor/microcontroller maintains the feed rate accurately as per fuel<br>
demand signal from the combustion control, by regulating the current to the<br>
eddy current clutch (ECC). The regulation of the clutch current varies the speed<br>
of the belt conveyor. In order to regulate the clutch current, the microprocessor/<br>
microcontroller estimates motor speed set point.<br>
To determine the actual feed rate, computation is carried out through<br>
programming. The computation includes the estimation of the feed rate by<br>
utilizing, speed factor and weight factor previously obtained during calibration.<br>
The actual feed rate is compared with the fuel demand feed rate to determine<br>
the motor speed set point.<br><br>
The system is designed with the additional following features:<br>
a)	The front facia of power supply and motor speed control module has a<br>
lockable two position (ON-OFF) selector switch. With the lockable key<br>
selected to 'ON' position, the feeding device and the motor speed control<br>
circuit can be checked independently without the microprocessor /<br>
microcontroller module.<br>
b)	In case of failure/non functioning of the microprocessor/microcontroller<br>
module while the bulk solids feeding device is working, the plurality of<br>
additional interface electronic modules will take up the complete operation<br>
without interruption.<br>
The interface electronic module also take care of the protection logics. The man-<br>
machine Interface (2) provided on the door of the remote power cabinet (4)<br>
communicates with the microprocessor/microcontroller module mounted in the<br>
card rack (1). Membrane type key board is provided for operation of the system.<br>
The Existing system incorporates solid-state circuitries and their functions are<br>
described below:<br>
The Figures 2 shows the methodology adopted for the computation and control<br>
of the feeding device using solid-state electronics. An Existing method means<br>
(Refer FIGURE 2) a measurement of feed rate signals from a load cell LCI (21)<br>
and LC2 (22) and measurement of belt travel by means of encoder (220). The<br>
signal-conditioning module (210) means processing of signal from load cells<br>
(200) and Encoder (220). Instrumentation Amplifier (23) amplifies the load cell<br>
output and is fed to the summer amplifier (24). The summer amplifier (24) sums<br><br>
the load cell signal and subtract the Tare signal (27) to arrive to the actual<br>
material weight. To calibrate the system a test weight is used . The Load cell<br>
amplifier (210) has facility to adjust its output by variable gain amplifier (25).<br>
The Encoder signal (220) means measurement of belt weight in terms of rotary<br>
motion of the drive pulley.<br>
Feed Rate means generation of frequency proportional to the load cell amplifier<br>
output multiplied by belt speed.<br>
Feed Rate= Kg/Cm X Cm/Sec= Load cell Output X Encoder Frequency.<br>
The LCA O/P is switched ON and OFF by switch (34) to produce a voltage. The<br>
Switching frequency depends on the factor of belt speed. The Voltage Controlled<br>
Oscillator output is maintained as per the feed rate by means of feed rate circuit<br>
employed by means of pulse generator (32) and switching circuit (35). The<br>
Feedback O/P is switched ON and OFF by switch (35) to produce opposite<br>
voltage to the error amplifier (30). The error amplifier output is given to an<br>
integrator and LPF. The Output of the integrator is easy to drive the Voltage<br>
controlled oscillator (33), which is the actual feed rate.<br>
FIGURE 3, shows the arrangement of signal conditioning module referred as 3 in<br>
FIGURE 1. The Weighing system (200) has two load cells LCI (21) and LC2 (22).<br>
These two signals are independently given to signal conditioning module. The<br>
milli volt signals from the load cell are given to an instrumentation amplifier (53<br>
and 54), which amplifies the signal by a factor 'K' and provides a voltage to<br>
current converter circuit (55 and 56). The output of the voltage to current<br>
converter is between to 4-20 mA. A Calibration probe signal (210) is given to a<br>
pulse shaping circuit (57) to generate span timing.<br><br>
FIGURE 4 shows the arrangement inside the card rack referred as 1 in FIGURE 1.<br>
The card rack interfaces the signals. The Weight signal representing the Load cell<br>
LCA1 and LCA2 is given to the analog input module (60). The Customer demand<br>
signal representing feed rate in terms of Tonnes/hour is given to the analog<br>
input module (60). To determine the drive speed (11) of FIGURE 1 i.e., eddy<br>
current drive, the employed tacho generator output is given to a pulse input<br>
module (63). To determine the calibration probe timing the CALP signal is given<br>
to a pulse input module (63). A Man machine interface shown as 2 in FIGURE 1<br>
provide capability to enter the constants to the CPU memory (61) like test<br>
weight, weigh span, volume of the weigh span, initial density and etc. The CPU<br>
(61) drives a analog output module to give feedback in terms of actual feed rate.<br>
The computed speed signal to maintain the feed rate is given to a transfer circuit<br>
(64). To make the control in operation in the event of CPU (61) failure a solid-<br>
state redundancy backup (65) is built in and its output is given to the transfer<br>
circuit (64). The Output of the transfer circuit is the set point for the speed<br>
regulation circuit (66). The Speed of the eddy current clutch refer llof FIGURE 1<br>
is varied by varying the current through the clutch coil. A110V AC supply is given<br>
to the speed regulation circuit (64) for the speed regulation circuit to control the<br>
speed of the eddy current clutch drive.<br>
Normally the CPU computes LCA1 and LCA2 and tacho generator signal to<br>
determine the feed rate and the desired speed is derived as set point to the<br>
speed regulation circuit (66) and the feed rate is determined in terms of<br>
Tonnes/hour. In the event of the load cell failure the feeder will run and maintain<br>
the feed rate based on the density estimated from the historical data.<br><br>
In the calibration mode actual tare and test weight signals are measured and<br>
factorized and stored in the memory. The span time determined from the CALP<br>
signal is used with tacho signal to determine the speed signal.<br>
A.	The System will switch over from normal to assumed density mode incase<br>
of the following factors:<br>
1.	If any of the load cell value is not within the acceptable limits,<br>
which is stored in permanent memory.<br>
2.	If the difference between the two loads cell outputs is more than<br>
the permissible limit ((LC1-LC2) &gt; (LC1 + LC2)/8).<br>
3.	Manual mode changes over.<br>
B.	Following are the steps adopted in the computation process:<br>
1.	Two load cell signals are summed and tare, which is estimated<br>
during calibration, is subtracted from it to get the weight of<br>
material on weighing span of belt.<br>
2.	The result obtained is multiplied with calibration factor to obtain<br>
the belt load per unit length.<br>
3.	The Weight of material on belt is divided by weigh span volume to<br>
arrive at the current density.<br><br>
4.	The Current density stored in memory is averaged for every 3<br>
hours to get historic density, which is used in assumed density<br>
mode of operation.<br>
5.	The RPM of belt arrived from the tachometer output signal is<br>
multiplied by suitable scaling factor to get the belt travel per<br>
second.<br>
6.	The belt travel per second and belt load per unit length is<br>
multiplied to get the feed rate.<br>
7.	The feed rate is then compared with the demanded feed rate and<br>
the error obtained is processed to control the belt seed.<br>
8.	The feed rate is fed to the tantalizer as pulses to get the integrated<br>
fuel intake.<br>
C. Assumed Density mode of operation:<br>
In this mode of operation,<br>
1.	The historic density obtained in the actual density mode is<br>
multiplied with weigh span volume to get the approximate weight<br>
on belt.<br>
2.	The Weight on belt is divided by weigh span length to get the belt<br>
load per unit length.<br><br>
3.	The RPM of belt arrived from the tachometer output signal is<br>
multiplied by suitable scaling factor to get the belt travel per<br>
second.<br>
4.	The belt travel per second and belt load per unit length is<br>
multiplied to get the feed rate.<br>
5.	The feed rate is then compared with the demanded feed rate and<br>
the error obtained is processed to control the belt speed.<br>
6.	The feed rate is fed to the tantalizer as pulses to get the integrated<br>
fuel intake.<br><br>
