				<td>BICYCLIC HETEROAROKATIC COMPOUNDS<br>
The invention relates to compounds having glycoprotein hormone agonistic or antagonistic activity, in particular to compounds having Luteinizing Hormone (LH) agonistic activity. The invention furthennore relates to bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives, to pharmaceutical compositions containing the same as well as to the use of these compounds in medical therapy, particularly for use as a control of fertility.<br>
Gonadotropins serve important functions in a variety of bodily functions including metaboHsm, temperature regulation and the reproductive process. The hypophyseal gonadotropin FSH for example plays a pivotal role in the stimulation of folhcle development and maturation whereas LH induces ovulation (Sharp, R.M. Clin Endocrinol, 33:787-807, 1990; Dorrington and Armstrong, Recent Prog. Honn. Res. 35:301-342,1979). Currently, LH is applied clinically, in combination with FSH, for ovarian stimulation i.e. ovarian hyperstimulation for in vitro fertilisation (IVF) and induction of ovulation in infertile anovulatory women (Insler, V., Int. J. Fertility 33:S5-97, 1988, Navot and Rosenwaks, J. Vitro Fert. Embryo Transfer 5:3-13, 1988), as well as for male hypogonadism and male iniertility.<br>
Gonadotropins act on specific gonadal cell types to initiate ovarian and testicular differentiation and steroidogenesis. The actions of these pituitary and placental hormones are mediated by specific plasma membrane receptors that are members of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors. They consist of a single polypeptide with seven transmembrane domains and are able to interact with the Gs protein, leading to the activation of adenyl cyclase.<br>
Gonadotropins destined for therapeutic purposes can be isolated from human urine sources and are of low purify (Morse et al, Amer, J. Reproduct. Immunol, and Microbiology 17:143, 1988). Altemativeiy, they can be prepared as recombinant gonadotropins.<br>
As with other therapeutic proteins, it is necessary to administer gonadotropins either subcutaneous or mtra-muscular. It woxild be advantageous, however, to activate the<br><br>
receptor with a small molecule that could be administered through e.g. the oral or transdennal ixjute.<br>
The present invention describes the preparation of such low moleciilar weight hormone analogs that selectively activate one of the gonadotropin receptors. This should be considered as one of the major advantages of the present invention.<br>
Thus, the invention resides in bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives according to general formula I, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof<br><br>

It has been shown that compounds of the above mentioned formula I are capable of binding to the LH receptor and show agonistic LH activity.<br>
The invention fiirther resides in a pharmaceutical composition comprising a bicyclic heteroaromatic derivative or salts thereof having the general formula I.<br>
Thus, the compounds accordiug to the invention can be used in therapy. A fiirther aspect of the invention resides in the use of a bicyclic heteroaromatic compound having the general formula I for the manufacture of a medicament for the control of fertility. Preferably the present compounds are used to activate the LH receptor.<br>
The bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives of this invention may possess one or more chiral carbon atoms. The compounds may therefore be obtained as chiraUy pure compounds or as a mixture of diastereomers and/or enantiomers. Methods for obtaining the chiraUy pure compounds are well known in the art, e.g. crystallization or chromatography.<br>
For therapeutic use, salts of the compounds of formula I are those wherein the counterion is pharmaceutically acceptable. However, acid addition salts of bases according to formula I, may also find use, for example, in the preparation or purification of a pharmaceutically acceptable compound. All salts, whether pharmaceutically acceptable or not, are included within the ambit of the present invention.<br>
Examples of acid addition salts include those derived from mineral acids such as hydrochloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulphuric acid, preferably hydrochloric acid, and organic acids like citric acid, tartaric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, fiunaric acid, glycoUc acid, succinic acid, and the like.<br>
Suitable administration routes for the compounds of foromla I or pharmaceutically acceptable   salts  thereof,   also  referred  to  herein   as  the   active  ingredient   are<br><br>
intramuscular injections, subcutaneous injections, intravenous injections or intr^eritoneal injections, oral and intranasal administratioa Preferably, the compounds may be administered orally. The exact dose and regimen of administration of the active ingredient, or a pharmaceutical composition thereof will necessarily be dependent upon the therapeutic effect to be achieved (treatment of infertility; contraception), and may vary with flie particular compound, the route of administration, and the age and condition of the individual subject to whom the medicament is to be administered.<br>
In general parenteral administration requires lower dosages than other methods of administration which are more dependent upon adsorption. Tlowever, a dosage for humans preferably contains 0.0001-25 mg per kg body weighi. The desired dose may be presented as one dose or as multiple subdoses administered at qjpropriate intervals throughout the day, or, in case of female recipients, as doses to be administered at appropriate daily intervals throughout the menstrual cycle. The dosage as well as the regimen of administration may differ between a female and a male recipient.<br>
In case of in vitro or ex vivo applications, like in IVF applications, the compounds of the inventions are to be used in the incubation media in a concentration of approximately 0.01-5 |ig/ ml.<br>
The present invention thus also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising a bicyclic heteroaromatic compound according to formula in admixture with pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries, and optionally other therapeutic agents. The auxiliaries must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and not deleterious to the recipients thereof. Pharmaceutical compositions include those suitable for oral, rectal, nasal, topical (including transdermal,  buccal  and  sublingual),  vaginal or parenteral  (including subcutaneous,   intramuscular,  intravenous   and  irvtradennal)   administration.   The compositions may be prepared by any method well known in the art of pharmacy, for example, using methods such as those described in Gennaro et al. Remington"s Pharmaceutical Sciences (18th ed., Mack Publishing company, 1990, see especially Part 8: Pharmaceutical Preparations and Their Manufacture).<br>
Such methods include the step of bringing in association the active ingredient with any auxiliary agent. The auxiliary agent(s), also named accessory ingredients, include those conventional in the art (Gennaro, supra)., such as, fillers, binders, diluents, disintegrants, lubricants, colorants, flavoring agents and wetting agents.<br><br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for oral administration may be presented as . discrete dosage units such as pills, tablets or capsules, or as a powder or granules, or as a solution or suspension. The active ingredient may also be presented as a bolus or paste. The compositions can further be processed into a suppository or enema for rectal administration<br>
For parenteral administration, suitable compositions include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection. The compositions may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed vials and ampoules, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophihsed) condition requiring only the addition of sterile Uquid carrier, for example, water prior to use.<br>
Compositions, or formulations, suitable for administration by nasal inhalation include fine dusts or mists which may be generated by means of metered dose pressurized aerosols, nebulisers or insufflators.<br>
The bicyclic heteroaromatic derivatives of the invention can also be administered in the form of implantable phamiaceutical devices, consisting of a core of active material, encased by a release rate-regulating membrane. Such implants are to be applied subcutaneously or locally, and will release the active ingredient at an approximately constant rate over relatively large periods of time, for instance from weeks to years. Methods for the preparation of implantable pharmaceutical devices as such are known in the art, for example as described in European Patent 0,303,306 (AK20N.V.).<br>
Thus, the compounds according to the present invention can be used for the same chnical purposes as the native LH, with the advantage that they display altered stability properties and can be administered differently.<br>
The compounds of the present invention wherein B = NH, represented by formula (I-a) can generally be prepared following art-known condensation of an acid of formula (II) with an amine of formula (HI).<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula (I) wherein B is a bond, represented by formula (I-c) are accessible by reaction of an appropriate organometallic reagent with derivatives of formula (V) in an aprotic solvent such as THF. Related substitution reactions can be found in literature: S.V. Frye, M.C. Johnson, NX. Valvano, J. Org. Chem. 56: 3750, 1991. Weioreb amides of formula (V) can be synthesized from acids of formula (H) and N-methoxy-N-methyl amine using the conditions described for the preparation of amides of formula (I-a).<br><br><br>
Bicyclic lactams of fonnula (VH) are useful starting materials for the preparation of the corresponding imines (VHI). hi a typical experiment, the lactam is converted to the corresponding chioroimine using phosphoryl chlori.de at elevated temperatuie (60 °C to reflux) in an appropriate solvent such as 1,4-dioxane. Upon treatment with a reducing agent such as hydrogen in the presence of a suitable catalyst in ethanol, the desired imine of general formula (Vm) can be isolated. Related reductions have been reported in Uterature, see for example: E. Bisagni, C. Landras, S. Thirot and C. Huel, Tetrahedron 52:10427,1996.<br><br><br>
BicycUc lactams of general structure (VH) may be prepared by condensation of acids of type (DC) with diethyl aminomalonate under the agency of a coupling agent such as XBTU/DiPEA and cyclisation of the iDtermediate amides in ethanol under basic conditions. Aromatisation with concomitant deethoxycarbonylation thea yields bicycles of type (VTI). In an alternative procedure, glycine ethyl ester can be used instead of diethyl aminomalonate. See for example: M. Blanco, M.G. Lorenzo, I. Perillo, CB. Schapira, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 33: 361, 1996. Cyclisation of the intermediate amides may also be effected by tin(IV) chloride. The use of tin(IV) chloride to effect ring-closure on related systems has been reported: A.C. Veronese, R. CaUegaii, C.F. Morelli, Tetrahedron 51: 12277,1995.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, (ert-butyl ethyl malonate can be used in this procedure instead of diethyl malonate.<br><br>
In another approach, methyl pyri(mi)dines of general formula (XIV) are deprotonated at the methyl group using a strong base, such as lithium hexamethyldisilazane (LiHMDS) or hthium diisopropylamide (LDA) in a suitable aptotic solvent, such as THF at low temperatures (-78 °C). The anion is then reacted with ethyl 3-ethoxyacrylate. After conjugate addition, cyclisation to quinolines or quinazolines of general formula (XHO occurs, as described in: K. Kobayashi, K. Takada, H. Tanaka, T. Uneda, T. Kitamura, Chem. Lett.: 25, 1996; K. Kobayashi, T. Uneda, K. Takada, H. Tanaka, T. Kitamura, O. Morikawa, H. Konishi, J. Org. Chem. 62: 664,1997.<br><br><br>
Alternatively, imines of formula pCVUI) can be prepared from the corresponding lactams of formula (XIX) in a similar fashion (vide supra) as their regioisomeric analogs of formula (Vni), i.e. conversion to liie cWoroimine using POCI3 and subsequent dehalogenation using hydrogen and an appropriate catalyst.<br><br><br>
Furopyri(mi)dines of general formula (XXlii) are accessible by selective O-aUcylation of lactams of type (XXI) using potassium carbonate in acetone, and subsequent ring-closure under the influence of sodium ethoxide in ethanol.<br><br><br>
Thienopyri(mi)dines of general formula pOCTV) are accessible by treatment of chlorides (XV) with ethyl mercaptoacetate under the influence of a strong base. In a typical experiment, one equivalent of chloride (XV) is reacted with 1.5 equivalents of ethyl mercaptoacetate and 2 equivalents of potassium tert-butoxide in THF. Under these conditions, the acyclic sulfide undergoes spontaneous cyclisation to form the tiiienopyri(mi)dine of general formula (XXIV). If R^ is Clietero)aryl, substituted with an electron withdrawing group such as nitro, the abovementioned cyclization is accomphshed via a two-step procedure, involving isolation of the intermediate Ihioether, followed by treatment with a *crtiary base such as DIPEA in toluene/EtOH at reflux temperature, to effect thiophene rmg formation.<br><br>
Pyri(mi)dine carboxylates of general formula (DC) are accessible by saponification of alkoxycarbonyl pyri(mi)dines of formula (XXV) using a stroi.^, base such as lithium hydroxide or potassi^un hydroxide in a mixture of water and an organic co-solvent such as 1,4-dioxane or methanol at elevated temperature (40 °C to reflux), followed by acidic-work-up. If W = C02a31cyl, R^ preferably is benzyl, to enable selective hydiogenolysis of the benzyl ester function while substituent W remains unaffected.<br><br><br>
Compounds of foimula (XXV) could be prepared by palladium-catalysed alkoxycarbonylation of chlorides (XV) in the presence of carbon monoxide and an appropriate alcohol (R"OH, XXVI). Similar transfonnations have speared in literatore, see for example: Y. Bessard, R. Crettaz, Heterocycles 51: 2589,1999.<br><br>
Similarly, treatment of chlorides of general formula (XV) with trimethylalane in the I    presence of a palladium catalyst in an aprotic solvent such as THF gives access to<br><br>
methyl pyri(mi)diiies of general fommla (XIV). Related syntheses have been published in: Q. Lu, I. Mangalagiu, T. Bsnneche and K. Undheim, Acta Chem. Sc. 51: 302,1997.<br><br>
In a typical experiment, components PCXVII), pOCVUI) and (XXKa-e) are suspended in an appropriate solvent, e.g. ethanol, methanol, N,N-diniethyIformamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, tetrahydrofuran or pyridine and a base such as potassium<br><br>
carbonate, sodium acetate, sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide is added. Reaction takes place at elevated temperature (70 "C to reflux). See for example: S. Kambe, K. Saito and H. Kishi, Synthesis: 287, 1979; A.M. Abd-Elfattah, S.M. Hussain and A.M. El-Reedy, Tefrahedron 39: 3197, 1983; S.M. Hussain, A.A El-Barbary and S.A. Mansour, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 22: 169, 1985. In the case of W = C(0)OEt, aromatization occurs on the addition of an oxidant, such as DDQ or oxygen. Related cyclizations may also be performed on a solid support such as Merrifield lesin using an appropriate linker, see for example A.L. Mrzinzik and E.R. Felder, J. Org. Chem. 63: 723, 1998; T. Masquelin, D. Sprenger, R. Baer, F. GcAer and Y. Mercadal, Helv. Chim. Acta 81: 646,1998.<br>
Compounds of general fonnula (XX) wherein Y = N, represented by formula (XX-a) may be prepared via a similar condensation strategy, using malonitrile.<br><br>
Alternatively, compounds of general formula (XX) are accessible by ammonolysis of chlorides of formula PCV), using aqueous ammonia and an jqDpropriate organic-co solvent such as 1,4-dioxane. This transformation may also be accomplished with ammonium chloride and a tertiary amine base such as DiPEA m an aprotic solvent such asDMF.<br><br><br>
Chlorides of general foimula (XV) can be synthesized by the art-known reaction of . lactams pCXI) with POCI3 in an appropriate solvent, such as 1,4-dioxane, at elevated temperatures (60 "C to reflux).<br><br>
Derivatives of fonnula (XV) wherein Y = N and R" is not (6-14C)aiyl or (4-13C)heteroaryl, may be prepared via monosubstitution of CI in derivatives of formula (XXX) with various nucleophiles. Related substitution reactions can be foimd in literature, e.g. S. Kohra, Y. Tonunaga and A. Hosomi, J. Heterocycl. Cbem. 25: 959, 1988; A.A. SantiUi, D.H. Kim and S.V. Wanser, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 8: 445, 1971; J. Clark, M.S. Shannet, D. Korakas and G. Varvounis, J. Heterocycl. Chem. 30: 1065, 1993; S. Tumkevicius, Liebigs Ann. Org. Bioorg. Chem. 9:1703,1995.<br><br>
Pyridmes of general fonnula (XXI) wherein Y = CH, A = S and W = CN, represented by formula (XXI-b) are accessible by sequential alkylation of a,p-unsaturated dinitriles of general structure (XXXI) with carbon disulfide and alkyl iodide R^-I to give compounds of general fomiula (XXXII), as described by P. Milart, Tetrahedron 54: 15643-15656, 1998. Cychzation of compounds of formula (XXXH) under acidic conditions as described by K. Peseke, Z. Chem. 29: 442-443 (1989) yields pyridines of general fonnula (XXI-b).<br><br><br>
Compounds of general formula (XXI) wherein A is a bond, Y = CH and W is as previously defined, represented by formula (XXI-c), can be prepared by reaction of , -unsaturatedketones of general formula PODQII) with amides of general fomiula (XXXIV) wherein W is as previously defined, using a strong base such as potassium tert-butoxide in the presence of oxygen in a suitable solvent, such as dimethylsulfoxide. Related cyclisations have been described in: IL Iain, F. Roschangar, MA. Ciufolini, Teh-ahedron Lett. 36: 3307, 1995.<br><br>
Methods to determine receptor binding as well as in vitro and in vivo assays to determine biological activity of gonadotropins are well known. In general, expressed receptor is contacted with the compound to be tested and bindiog or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response is measured.<br>
To measure a functional response isolated DNA encoding the LH receptor gene, preferably the human receptor, is expressed in sintable host ceUs. Such a cell might be the Chinese Hamster Ovary cell, but other cells are also suitable. Preferably the ceUs are of mammalian origin (Jia et al, MolEndocrin., 5:759-776,1991-<br>
Methods to construct recombinant LH expressing cell lines are weil known in the art (Sambrook et al.. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor<br><br>
Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, latest edition). Expression of receptor is attained by egression of the DNA encoding the .desired protein. Techniques for site du-ected mutagenesis, Ugation of additional sequences, PCR, and construction of suitable expression systems are all, by now, well known in the art. Portions oi all of the DNA encoding the desired protein can be constructed synthetically using standard solid phase techniques, preferably to include restriction sites for ease of ligation. Suitable control elements for transcription and translation of the included coding sequence can be provided to the DNA coding sequences. As is well known, expression systems are now available which are compatible with a wide variety of hosts, including prokaryotic hosts such as bacteria and eukaryotic hosts such as yeast, plant cells, iosect cells, mammalian cells, avian cells and the like.<br>
Cells e5q&gt;ressing the receptor are then are then contacted with the test compound to observe binding, or stimulation or inhibition of a functional response.<br>
Alternatively isolated cell membranes containing the expressed receptor may be used to measure binding of compound.<br>
For measurement of binding radioactively or fluorescently labeled compounds may be used. As reference compound human recombinant LH can be used. In the alternative also competition binding assays can be performed.<br>
Another assay involves screening for"LH receptor agonist compounds by determining stimulation of receptor mediated cAMP accumulation. Thus, such a method involves expession of the recq)tor on the cell surface of a host cell and exposing the cell to the test compound. The amount of cAMP is then measured. The level of cAMP will be reduced or increased, depending on the inhibitory or stimulating effect of the test compound upon binding to the receptor.<br>
In addition to direct measurement of e.g. cAMP levels in the exposed cell, cells lines can be used which in addition to transfection with receptor encoding DNA are also transfected with a second DNA encoding a reporter gene the expression of which responds to the level of cAMP. Such reporter genes might be cAMP inducible or might be constructed in such a way that they are connected to novel cAMP responsive elements. In general, reporter gene expression might be controlled by any response element reacting to changing levels of cAMP. Suitable reporter genes are e.g. LacZ, alkaline phosphatase, firefly luciferase and green fluorescence protein. The principles of such transactivation assays are well known in the art and are described e.g. in Sh^towa, Ch, Himmler, A and Czemilofsky, A.P. (1995) Cuir.Opin.Biotechnol.6;574.<br><br>
For selecting active compounds testing at 10"^ M must result in an activity of more than 20% of the maximal activity when LH is used as a reference. Another criterion might be the ECjo value which must be 
The skilled artisan will recognize that desirable EC50 values are dependent on the compound tested. For example, a compound with an EC50 which is less than IQ"^ M is generally considered a candidate for drug selection. Preferably this value is lower than more preferably 10"* M. However, a compound which has a higher EC50, t^ut is selective for the particular receptor, may be even a better candidate.<br>
Screening for LH receptor agonistic compounds can also be performed by using a mouse Leydig cell bioassay (Van Damme, M., Robersen, D. and Diczfalusy, E. (1974). Acta Endocrinol. 77: 655-671 Mannaerts, B., Kloosterboer, H. and Schuurs, A. (1987). Neuroendocrinology of reproduction. R. RoUand et al. Eds., Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., 49-58). In this assay, stimulation of LH receptor mediated testosterone production can be measured in Leydig cells isolated fiiom male mice.<br>
To measure in vivo activity of LH receptor agonistic compounds ovulation induction in iimnatuie mice can be studied. In this assay immature female mice can be primed with urinary FSH and approximately 48 hours later treated with a LH agonistic compound. The animals are lolled after LH agonist treatment and the number of ova in the oviduct can be microscopically assessed.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be applied clinically in those regimens where now LH or hCG is used. These include LH substitution among subjects with hypogonadal hypogonadism either male or female, midcycle administration to induce ovulation (ovulation induction (01) or controlled hyperstimulation (COH) or stimulation of the corpus Inteum.<br>

LH agonistic activity of compounds was tested in Chinese Hamster Ovaiy (CHO) cells stably transfected with the human LH receptor and cotransfected with a cAMP responsive element (CRE) / promotor directing the expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. Binding of ligand to the Gs-coupled LH receptor will result in an increase of cAMP, which in tum will induce an increased transactivation of the luciferase reporter construct. The luciferase signal was quantified using a luminescence counter. For test compoxmds, EC50 values (concentration of test compound causing half-maximal (50 %) stimulation) were calculated. For that puipose the software program GraphPad PRISM, version 3.0 (GraphPad software Inc., San Diego) was used. Results indicated that ECso value for the compounds of examples 9, 11, 12, li3; 14, 25 and 27 was between 10"^ and 10"^ M.
