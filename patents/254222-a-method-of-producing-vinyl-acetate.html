				<td>MODIFIED SUPPORT MATERIALS FOR CATALYSTS	<br><br>
Claim of Priority<br>
[0001] The application claims the benefit of U.S. application 60/637,529, filed on December<br>
20, 2004, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to catalysts, methods of making the catalysts, and<br>
methods of making alkenyl alkanoates. More particularly, the invention relates to catalysts,<br>
methods of making the catalysts, and methods of making vinyl acetate.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0003] Certain alkenyl alkanoates, such as vinyl acetate (VA), are commodity chemicals in<br>
high demand in their monomer form. For example, VA is used to make polyvinyl acetate<br>
(PVAc), which is used commonly for adhesives, and accounts for a large portion of VA use.<br>
Other uses for VA included polyvinyl alcohol (PVOH), ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), vinyl<br>
acetate ethylene (VAE), polyvinyl butyral (PVB), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyvinyl<br>
formal (PVF), and vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer. PVOH is typically used for textiles,<br>
films, adhesives, and photosensitive coatings. Films and wire and cable insulation often employ<br>
EVA in some proportion. Major applications for vinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer include<br>
coatings, paints, and adhesives often employ VAE having VA in some proportion. VAE, which<br>
contains more than 50 percent VA, is primarily used as cement additives, paints, and adhesives.<br>
PVB is mainly used for under layer in laminated screens, coatings, and inks. EVOH is used for<br>
barrier films and engineering polymers. PVF is used for wire enamel and magnetic tape.<br>
[0004] Because VA is the basis for so many commercially significant materials and products,<br>
the demand for VA is large, and VA production is frequently done on a relatively large scale, e.g.<br>
50,000 metric tons or more per year. This large scale production means that significant<br><br>
economies of scale are possible and relatively subtle changes in the process, process conditions<br>
or catalyst characteristics can have a significant economic impact on the cost of the production of<br>
VA,<br>
[0005] Many techniques have been reported for the production of alkenyl alkanoates. For<br>
example, in making VA, a widely used technique includes a catalyzed gas phase reaction of<br>
ethylene with acetic acid and oxygen, as seen in the following reaction:<br><br>
Several side reactions may take place, including, such as, the formation of CO2. The results of<br>
this reaction are discussed in terms of the space-time yield (STY) of the reaction system, where<br>
the STY is the grams of VA produced per liter of catalyst per hour of reaction time (g/l*h).<br>
[0006] The composition of the starting material feed can be varied within wide limits.<br>
Typically, the starting material feed includes 30-70% ethylene, 10-30% acetic acid and 4-16%<br>
oxygen. The feed may also include inert materials such as CO2, nitrogen, methane, ethane,<br>
propane, argon and/or helium. The primary restriction on feed composition is the oxygen level in<br>
the effluent stream exiting the reactor must be sufficiently low such that the stream is outside the<br>
flammability zone. The oxygen level in the effluent is affected by the oxygen level in the starting<br>
material stream, O2 conversion rate of the reaction and the amount of any inert material in the<br>
effluent.<br>
[0007] The gas phase reaction has been carried out where a feed of the starting materials is<br>
passed over or through fixed bed reactors. Successful results have been obtained through the use<br>
of reaction temperatures in the range of 125°C to 200°C, while reaction pressures of 1-15<br>
atmospheres are typical,<br>
[0008] While these systems have provided adequate yields, there continues to be a need for<br>
reduced production of by-products, higher rates of VA output, and lower energy use during<br>
production. One approach is to improve catalyst characteristics, particularly as to CO2 selectivity<br>
and/or activity of the catalyst. Another approach is to modify reaction conditions, such as the<br>
ratio of starting materials to each other, the O2 conversion of the reaction, the space velocity (SV)<br>
of the starting material feed, and operating temperatures and pressures.<br><br>
[0009} The formation of CO2 is one aspect which may be reduced through the use of<br>
improved catalysts. The CO2 selectivity is the percentage of the ethylene converted that goes to<br>
CO2. Decreasing the CO2 selectivity permits a larger amount of VA per unit volume and unit<br>
time in existing plants, even retaining all other reaction conditions.<br>
[0010] The formation of ethyl acetate (EA) is another aspect which may be reduced through<br>
the use of improved catalysts. The EA selectivity is usually expressed in ppm as the ratio<br>
EA/VA vftJvfi, Decreasing the EA selectivity permits reducing or eliminating post-production<br>
purification of VA. By reducing the EA selectivity of a catalyst, the processing steps associated<br>
with EA removal could be eliminated, thus providing cost savings. It would be desirable to<br>
achieve an EA/VA ratio less than the typical ratio of about 700 ppm, preferably less than about<br>
200 ppm without sacrificing the catalysts' CO2 selectivity or its activity.<br>
[0011 ] Attempts to reduce EA output have included increasing the gold to palladium ratio on<br>
the catalyst, such as shown in U.S. Patent No. 5,185,308. While this patent indicates that the<br>
EA/VA ratio eventually goes to zero with a high enough gold to palladium ratio, experimental<br>
testing has been unable to reproduce mis result. Furthermore, CO2 selectivity is sacrificed<br>
through the use of an increased gold to palladium ratio. Consequently, another approach is<br>
needed.<br>
[0012] VA output of a particular reaction system is affected by several other factors<br>
including the activity of the catalyst, the ratio of starting materials to each other, the O2<br>
conversion of the reaction, the space velocity (SV) of the starting material feed, and operating<br>
temperatures and pressures. AH these factors cooperate to determine the space-time yield (STY)<br>
of the reaction system, where the STY is discussed in terms of grams of VA produced per liter of<br>
catalyst per hour of reaction time or g/l*h.<br>
[0013[ Generally, activity is a significant factor in determining the STY, but other factors<br>
may still have a significant impact on the STY. Typically, the higher the activity of a catalyst,<br>
the higher the STY the catalyst is able to produce.<br>
[0014] The O2 conversion is a measure of how much oxygen reacts in the presence of the<br>
catalyst. The O2 conversion rate is temperature dependent such that the conversion rate generally<br><br>
climbs with the reaction temperature. However, the CO2 selectivity also increases along with the<br>
increase in temperature. Thus, the O2 conversion rate is selected to give the desired VA output<br>
balanced against the amount of CO2 produced. A catalyst with a higher activity means that the<br>
overall reaction temperature can be lowered while maintaining the same O2 conversion.<br>
Alternatively, a catalyst with a higher activity will give a higher O2 conversion rate at a given<br>
temperature and space velocity.<br>
[0015} It is common mat catalysts employ one or more catalytic components carried on a<br>
relatively inert support material. In the case of VA catalysts, the catalytic components are<br>
typically a mixture of metals that may be distributed uniformly throughout the support material<br>
("all through-out catalysts"), just on the surface of the support material ("shell catalysts"), just<br>
below a shell of support material ("egg white catalysts") or in the core of the support material<br>
("egg yolk catalysts"). Preferred type of metal distribution is dependent a number of factors<br>
including the reactor system and catalyst size/shape.<br>
[0016] Numerous different types of support materials have been suggested for use in VA<br>
catalyst including silica, cerium doped silica, alumina, titania, zirconia and oxide mixtures. But<br>
very little investigation of the differences between the support materials has been done. For the<br>
most part, only silica and alumina have actually been commercialized as support materials.<br>
[0017] One useful combination of metals for VA catalysis is palladium and gold. Pd/Au<br>
catalysts provide adequate CO2 selectivity and activity, but there continues to be a need for<br>
improved catalysts given the economies of scale that are possible in the production of VA.<br>
[0018] One process for making Pd/Au catalysts typically includes the steps of impregnating<br>
the support with aqueous solutions of water-soluble salts of palladium and gold; reacting the<br>
impregnated water-soluble salts with an appropriate alkaline compound eg., sodium hydroxide,<br>
to precipitate (often called fixing) the metallic elements as water-insoluble compounds, e.g. the<br>
hydroxides; washing the fixed support material to remove un-fixed compounds and to otherwise<br>
cleanse the catalyst of any potential poisons, e.g. chloride; reducing the water insoluble<br>
compounds with a typical reductant such as hydrogen, ethylene or hydrazine, and adding an<br>
alkali metal compound such as potassium or sodium acetate.<br><br>
[0019} Various modifications to this basic process have been suggested. For example, in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,990,344, it is suggested that sintering of the palladium be undertaken after the<br>
reduction to its free metal form. In U,S, Patent No. 6,022,823, it suggested that calcining the<br>
support in a non-reducing atmosphere after impregnation with both palladium and gold salts<br>
might be advantageous. In W094/21374, it is suggested that after reduction and activation, but<br>
before its first use, the catalyst may be pretreated by successive heating in oxidizing, inert, and<br>
reducing atmospheres.<br>
[0020] In U.S. Patent No. 5,466,652, it is suggested that salts of palladium and gold that are<br>
hydroxyl-, halide- and barium-free and soluble in acetic acid may be useful to impregnate the<br>
support material. A similar suggestion is made in U.S. Patent No. 4,902,823, i.e. use of halide-<br>
and sulfur-free salts and complexes of palladium soluble in unsubstituted carboxylic acids having<br>
two to ten carbons.<br>
[0021} In U.S. Patent No. 6,486,370, it suggested that a layered catalyst may be used in a<br>
dehydrogenation process where the inner layer support material differs from the outer layer<br>
support material. Similarly, U.S. Patent No, 5,935,889 suggests that a layered catalyst may<br>
useful as acid catalysts. But neither suggests the use of layered catalysts in the production of<br>
alkenyl alkanoates. In U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0181940, layered catalysts for vinyl acetate<br>
are shown, but modified support materials are not.<br>
[0022} In U.S. Patent No. 5,508,136 it suggested mat a titanium or zirconium may be used to<br>
pre-treat a silica or alumina support material to improved activity and/or CO2 selectivity of the<br>
Gatalyst.<br>
[0023] Taken together, the inventors have recognized and addressed the need for continued<br>
improvements in the field of VA catalysts to provide improved VA production at lower costs.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0024] The present invention relates to a method of producing a catalyst or pre-catalyst<br>
suitable for assisting in the production of alkenyl alkanoates. The method includes contacting a<br>
modifier precursor to a support material to form a modified support material. One or more<br><br>
catalytic component precursors (palladium and/or gold) may be contacted to the modified support<br>
material. The atomic ratio of gold to palladium is preferably in the range of about 0.3 to about<br>
0.90. The support materials with the catalytic component may men be reduced using a reducing<br>
environment and/or activated using with an activating agent such as KOAc. A composition for<br>
catalyzing the production of an alkenyl alkanoates including a modified support material with<br>
palladium and gold is also included within the invention. Catalysts of the present invention may<br>
be used to produce alkenyl alkanoates in general and vinyl acetate in particular.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
(00251 Catalysts<br>
[0026} For present purposes, a catalyst is any support material that contains at least one<br>
catalytic component and that is capable of catalyzing a reaction, whereas a pre-catalyst is any<br>
material that results from any of the catalyst preparation steps discussed herein.<br>
[00271 Catalysts and pre-catalysts of the present invention may include those having a<br>
modified support material. Effective use of the catalyst accordingly should help improve EA<br>
selectivity while maintaining or improving CO2 selectivity, activity or both, particularly as<br>
pertaining to VA production. Moreover, the combination of improving EA selectively while<br>
maintaining or improving CO2 selectivity may be desirable even if activity is adversely affected.<br>
[0028] It should be appreciated that the present invention is described in the context of<br>
certain illustrative embodiments, but may be varied in any of a number of aspects depending on<br>
the needs of a particular application. By way of example, without limitation, the catalysts may<br>
have the catalytic components uniformly distributed throughout the support material or they may<br>
be shell catalysts where the catalytic components are found in a relatively thin shell around a<br>
support material core. Egg white catalysts may also be suitable, where the catalytic components<br>
reside substantially away from the center of support material. Egg yolk catalysts may also be<br>
suitable. Preferred type of metal distribution is dependent on a number of factors including the<br>
reactor system and catalyst size/shape and include shell catalysts and layered catalysts.<br>
[00291 Catalytic Components<br><br>
[0030] In general, the catalysts and pre-catalysts of the present invention include metals and<br>
particularly include a combination of at least two metals. In particular, the combination of metals<br>
includes at least one from Group VIIIB and at least one from Group IB. It will be appreciated<br>
that "catalytic component" is used to signify the metal that ultimately provides catalytic<br>
functionally to the catalyst, but also includes the metal in a variety of states, such as salt,<br>
solution, sol-gel, suspensions, colloidal suspensions, free metal, alloy, or combinations thereof.<br>
Preferred catalysts include palladium and gold as the catalytic components.<br>
[0031] Another preferred embodiment of the catalyst includes between about 1 to about 10<br>
grams of palladium and preferably between about 1 and 10 grams of palladium per liter.<br>
[0032] In one embodiment for catalysts, Au to Pd atomic ratios between about 0.1 and about<br>
1.25 may be preferred for catalysts. Most preferred Au;Pd atomic ratios are from 0.3-0.9. The<br>
atomic ratio can be adjusted to balance the EA/VA selectivity and CO2 selectivity. Employment<br>
of higher Au/Pd weight or atomic ratios tends to favor relatively lower EA/VA ratios but higher<br>
CO2 selectivity.<br>
[0033] One embodiment is the use of ground or powder catalysts for screening of catalyst<br>
compositions. A ground catalyst may be one where the catalytic components are contacted to the<br>
support material followed by a reduction in the particle size (e.g. by grinding or ball milling) or<br>
one where the catalytic components are contacted to the support material after the support<br>
material has been reduced in size. In one embodiment, a ground or powder catalyst is used to<br>
simulate a shell catalyst. In simulated shell catalyst, an aliquot of support material with a<br>
relatively high concentration of modifiers and/or catalytic components is diluted with a support<br>
material that is substantially free of modifiers and/or catalytic component, but has been activated<br>
with an activation agent (e.g. potassium acetate), as discussed below. The diluted support<br>
material then has the preferred amounts of modifiers and/or catalytic components in the catalyst.<br>
[0034] For shell catalysts, the thickness of the shell of catalytic components on the support<br>
material ranges from about 5 µm to about 500 µm. More preferred ranges include from about 5<br>
µm to about 300 µm.<br>
[0035] Support Materials<br><br>
[0036} In one aspect of the invention, the catalytic components of the present invention<br>
generally will be carried by a support material. Suitable support materials typically include<br>
materials that are substantially uniform in identity or a mixture of materials. Overall, the support<br>
materials are typically inert in the reaction being performed. Support materials may be composed<br>
of any suitable substance preferably selected so that the support materials have a relatively high<br>
surface area per unit mass or volume, such as a porous structure, a molecular sieve structure, a<br>
honeycomb structure, or other suitable structure. For example, the support material may contain<br>
silica, alumina, silica-alumina, titania, titano-silicate, zirconia, zircono-silicate, niobia, silicates,<br>
alumino-silicates, titanates, spinel, silicon carbide, silicon nitride, carbon, cordierite, steatite,<br>
bentonite, clays, metals, glasses, quartz, pumice, zeolites, non-zeolitic molecular sieves<br>
combinations thereof and the like. Any of the different crystalline form of the materials may also<br>
be suitable, e.g. alpha or gamma alumina. Zirconia, zircono-silicates and titano-silicates<br>
containing support materials are the most preferred. In addition, multilayer support materials are<br>
also suitable for use in the present invention.<br>
(0037} The support material in the catalyst of this invention may be composed of particles<br>
having any of various regular or irregular shapes, such as spheres, tablets, cylinders, discs, rings,<br>
stars, or other shapes. The support material may have dimensions such as diameter, length or<br>
width of about 1 to about 10 mm, preferably about 3 to about 9 mm. In particular having a<br>
regular shape (e.g. spherical) will have as its preferred largest dimension of about 4 mm to about<br>
8 mm. In addition, a ground or powder support material may be suitable such that the support<br>
material has a regular or irregular shape with a diameter of between about 10 microns and about<br>
1000 micron, with preferred sizes being between about 10 and about 700 microns, with most<br>
preferred sizes being between about 180 microns and about 450 microns. Larger or smaller sizes<br>
may be employed, as well as polydisperse collections of particles sizes. For example, for a fluid<br>
bed catalyst a preferred size range would include 10 to 150 microns. For precursors used in<br>
layered catalysts, a size range of 10 to 250 microns is preferred.<br>
[0038} Surface areas available for supporting catalytic components, as measured by the BET<br>
(Brunauer, Emmett, and Teller) method, may generally be between about 1 m2/g and about 500<br><br>
m2/g, preferably about 20 m2/g to about 200 m2/g. For example, for a porous support, the pore<br>
volume of the support material may generally be about 0.1 to about 2 ml/g, and preferably about<br>
0.4 to about 1,2 ml/g. An average pore size in the range, for example, of about 50 to about 2000<br>
angstroms is desirable, but not required.<br>
{0039} Examples of suitable silica containing support materials include KA160 from Sud<br>
Chemie, Aerolyst350 from Degussa and other pyrogenie or microporous-free silicas with a<br>
particle size of about 1 mm to about 10 mm.<br>
[0040] Examples of suitable zirconia containing support materials include those from<br>
NorPro, Zirconia Sales (America), Inc., Daichi Kigenso Kagaku Kogyo, Engelhard and<br>
Magnesium Elektron Inc (MEI). Suitable zirconia support materials have a wide range of surface<br>
areas from less than about 5 m2/g to more than 300 m2/g. Preferred zirconia support materials<br>
have surface areas from about 20 m /g to about 150 m /g, with a range of between about 30 m /g<br>
and about 100 m2/g more preferred. Support materials may have their surfaces treated through a<br>
calcining step in which the virgin support material is heated. The heating reduces the surface<br>
area of the support material (e.g. calcining). This provides a method of creating support<br>
materials with specific surface areas that may not otherwise be readily available from suppliers.<br>
[0041] Examples of other suitable support materials include titano-silicates from Grace such<br>
as SP18-9534 (silica with 0.61% TiO2) or zircono-silicates from Grace such as SP189043 (silica<br>
with 1,69% ZrO2). More generally, suitable support materials may include up to about 50%<br>
Ti2; more preferably between about 0.01% and about 25% T1O2; and most preferably between<br>
about 0.1 and about 5% TiO2. Also, suitable support materials may include up to about 50%<br>
Z1O2; more preferably between about 0.01% and about 25% ZrO2; and most preferably between<br>
about 0,1 and about 5% ZrO2.<br>
[0042] In another embodiment, it is contemplated to employ at least a plural combination of<br>
support materials, each with a different characteristic. For example, at least two support<br>
materials (e.g. zirconia and silica) with different characteristics may exhibit different activities<br>
and CO2 selectivities, thus permitting preparation of catalysts with a desired set of characteristics,<br>
i.e. activity of a catalyst may be balanced against the CO2 selectivity of the catalyst.<br><br>
[0043] Layered Support Materials<br>
[0044] In one embodiment, plural different supports are employed in a layered configuration<br>
as discussed in U.S. Patent Publication 2005/0181940, which is hereby incorporated by<br>
reference. Layering may be achieved in any of a number of different approaches, such as a<br>
plurality of lamella that are generally flat, undulated or a combination thereof. One particular<br>
approach is to utilize successively enveloping layers relative to an initial core layer. In general,<br>
herein, layered support materials typically include at least an inner layer and an outer layer at<br>
least partially surrounding the inner layer. All the layers of a layered catalyst may be modified as<br>
discussed below, with at least the outer layer preferably being modified. The outer layer also<br>
preferably contains substantially more of catalytic components than the inner layer. In one<br>
embodiment, the inner and outer layers are made of different materials; but the materials may be<br>
the same. While the inner layer may be non-porous, other embodiments include an inner layer<br>
mat is porous.<br>
[0045] The layered support material preferably results in a form of a shell catalyst. But the<br>
layered support material offers a well defined boundary between the areas of the support material<br>
that have catalytic components and the areas that do not. Also, the outer layer can be constructed<br>
consistently with a desired thickness. Together the boundary and the uniform thickness of the<br>
outer layer result in a shell catalyst that is a shell of catalytic components that is of a uniform and<br>
known thickness.<br>
[0046] Several techniques are known for creating layered support materials includes those<br>
described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,486,370; 5,935,889; and 5,200,382, each of which is<br>
incorporated by reference. In one embodiment, the materials of the inner layer are also npt<br>
substantially penetfated by liquids, e.g., metals including but not limited to aluminum, titanium<br>
and zirconium. Examples of other materials for the inner layer include, but are not limited to,<br>
silica, alumina, silica-alumina, titania, titano-silicate, zirconia, zircono-silicate, niobia, silicates,<br>
alumino-silicates, titanates, spinel, silieon carbide, silicon nitride, carbon, eordierite, steatite,<br>
bentonite, clays, metals, glasses, quartz, pumice, zeolites, non-zeolitic molecular sieves<br>
combinations thereof and the like. A preferred inner layer is silica and KA160, in particular.<br><br>
[0047] These materials which make up the inner layer may be in a variety of forms such as<br>
regularly shaped particulates, irregularly shaped particulates, pellets, discs, rings, stars, wagon<br>
wheels, honeycombs or other shaped bodies. A spherical particulate inner layer is preferred. The<br>
inner layer, whether spherical or not, has an effective diameter of about 0.02 mm to about 10.0<br>
mm and preferably from about 0.04 mm to about 8.0 mm.<br>
(0048] The outermost layer of any multilayer structure is one which is porous, has a surface<br>
area in the range of about 5 m2/g to about 300 m2/g. The material of the outer layer is a metal,<br>
ceramic, or a combination thereof, and in one embodiment it is selected from alumina, silica,<br>
silica-alumina, titania, zirconia, niobia, silicates, aluminosilicates, titanates, spinel, silicon<br>
carbide, silicon nitride, carbon, eordierite, steatite, bentonite, days, metals, glasses, quartz,<br>
pumice, zeolites, non-zeolitic molecular sieves and combinations thereof and preferably include<br>
alumina, silica, silica/alumina, zeolites, non-zeolite molecular sieves (NZMS), titania, zirconia<br>
and mixtures thereof. Specific examples include zirconia, silica and alumina or combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
[0049} While the outer layer typically surrounds substantially the entire inner layer, mis is not<br>
necessarily the ease and a selective coating on the inner layer by the outer layer may be<br>
employed.<br>
[0050] The outer layer may be eoated on to the underlying layer in a suitable manner. In one<br>
embodiment, a slurry of the outer layer material is employed. Coating of the inner layer with the<br>
slurry may be accomplished by methods such as rolling, dipping, spraying, wash coating, other<br>
slurry coating techniques, combinations thereof or the like. One preferred technique involves<br>
using a fixed or fluidized bed of inner layer particles and spraying the slurry into the bed to coat<br>
the particles evenly. The slurry may be applied repeatedly in small amounts, with intervening<br>
drying, to provide an outer layer that is highly uniform in thickness.<br>
[0051] The slurry utilized to coat the inner layer may also include any of a number of<br>
additives such as a surfactant, an organic or inorganic bonding agent that aids in the adhesion of<br>
the outer layer to an underlying layer, or combinations thereof. Examples of mis organic bonding<br>
agent include but are not limited to PVA, hydroxypropylcellulose, methyl cellulose, and<br><br>
carboxymethylcellulose. The amount of organic bonding agent which is added to the slurry may<br>
vary, such as from about 1 wt % to about 15 wt % of the combination of outer layer and the<br>
bonding agent. Examples of inorganic bonding agents are selected from an alumina bonding<br>
agent (e.g. Bohmite), a silica bonding agent (e.g. Ludox, Teos), zirconia bonding agent (e.g.<br>
zirconia acetate or colloidal zirconia) or combinations thereof. Examples of silica bonding<br>
agents include silica sol and silica gel, while examples of alumina bonding agents include<br>
alumina sol, bentonite, Bohmite, and aluminum nitrate. The amount of inorganic bonding agent<br>
may range from about 2 wt % to about 15 wt % of the combination of the outer layer and the<br>
bonding agent. The thickness of the outer layer may range from about 5 microns to about 500<br>
microns and preferably between about 20 microns and about 250 microns.<br>
[0052} Once the inner layer is coated with the outer layer, the resultant layered support will<br>
be dried, such as by heating at a temperature of about 100°C to about 320°C (e.g. for a time of<br>
about 1 to about 24 hours) and then may optionally be calcined at a temperature of about 300°C<br>
to about 900°C (e.g. for a time of about 0.5 to about 10 hours) to enhance bonding the outer layer<br>
to it underlying layer over a least a portion of its surface and provide a layered catalyst support.<br>
The drying and calcining steps can be combined into one step. The resultant layered support<br>
material may be contacted with catalytic components just as any other support material in the<br>
production of eatalysts, as described below. Alternately, the outer layer support material is<br>
contacted to catalytic components before it is coated onto the underlying layer.<br>
{0653] In another embodiment of the layered support, a second outer layer is added to<br>
surround the initial outer layer to form at least three layers. The material for the second outer<br>
layer may be the same or different man the first outer layer. Suitable materials include those<br>
discussed with respect to the first outer layer. The method for applying the second outer layer<br>
may be the same or different than the method used to apply the middle layer and suitable<br>
methods include those discussed wife respect to the first outer layer. Organic or inorganic<br>
bonding agents as described may suitably used in the formation of the second outer layer.<br>
[0054} The initial outer layer may or may not contain catalytic components. Similarly, the<br>
second outer layer may or may not contain catalytic components. If both outer layers contain<br><br>
catalytic component, then preferably different catalytic components are used in each layer,<br>
although this is not necessarily the ease. In one preferred embodiment, the initial outer layer<br>
does not contain a catalytic component. Contacting catalytic component to the outer layers may<br>
be accomplished by impregnation or spray coating, as described below.<br>
[0055] In embodiments where the initial outer layer contains catalytic component, one<br>
method of achieving this is to contact the catalytic component to the material of the initial outer<br>
layer before the material is applied to the inner layer. The second outer layer may be applied to<br>
the initial outer layer neat or containing catalytic component.<br>
[0056} Other suitable techniques may be used to achieve a three layered support material in<br>
which one or more of the outer layers contain catalytic components. Indeed, the layered support<br>
material is not limited to three layers, but may include four, five or more layers, some or all of<br>
which may contain catalytic components.<br>
[0057} In addition, the number and type of catalytic components that vary between the layers<br>
of the layered support material, other characteristics (e.g. porosity, particle size, surface area,<br>
pore volume, or the like) of the support material may vary between the layers.<br>
[0058] Modified Support Materials<br>
[0059} In another embodiment, the support material may be a modified support material, A<br>
modified support material is one that includes a modifier. The modifier is preferably a metal<br>
selected from alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, transition metals, and lanthanides. More<br>
preferably the modifier is selected from group 1 to 6 elements. Of these elements, barium,<br>
magnesium, cerium, potassium, calcium, niobium, tantalum, titanium, yttrium, steontium,<br>
zirconium, lanthanum, praseodymium, vanadium, molybdenum, and rubidium are more<br>
preferred. Niobium, titanium, magnesium, and zirconium represent the preferred modifiers, with<br>
zirconium being slightly less preferred. Combinations of these elements are also suitable with<br>
binary combinations die preferred type of combination. For example, suitable binary<br>
combinations include Ti-Zr, Mg-Nb, Nb-Zr, Mg-Ti, Nb-Ti, Mg-Zr or the like. Ratios of metals<br>
in the binary combinations range from about 4:1 to about 1:4.<br><br>
[0060} Support materials are typically modified before catalytic components are added to the<br>
support material. In one preferred embodiment, a support material is impregnated with one or<br>
more aqueous solution of the modifiers (referred to as modifier precursor solutions). The<br>
physical state of the support material during the contacting step may be a dry solid, a slurry, a<br>
sol-gel, a colloidal suspension or the like.<br>
[0061] In one embodiment, the modifiers contained in the precursor solution are water<br>
soluble salts made of the modifiers, including but not limited to, chlorides, other halides, nitrates,<br>
nitrites, hydroxides, oxides, oxalates, lactates, acetates (OAe), ammoniums and amines, with<br>
chloride free salts being preferred, with lactates, oxalates and nitrates being most preferred.<br>
Examples of modifier salts suitable for use in modifier precursor solutions include Ba(NO3)2,<br>
Mg(NO3)2-6H2O, Ce(NO3)3-6H2O, KNO3, Ca(NO3)2-4H2O, (NH4)1.35Nb(C2O4)^, Ta(C2O4)2.5,<br>
Ti(CH3CH(O-)CO2NH4)2(OH)2, Y(NO3)3-6H2O, ZrO(NO3)2-xH2O.<br>
[0062] Furthermore, more than one salt may be used in a given modifier precursor solution.<br>
Precursor solutions typically may be made by dissolving the selected salt or salts in water, with<br>
or without solubility modifiers such as acids, bases or other solvents. Other non-aqueous<br>
solvents may also be suitable.<br>
[0063] The modifier precursor solutions may be impregnated onto the support material in a<br>
single impregnation, although support materials maybe impregnated multiple times with<br>
modifiers having low atomic weight (e.g. Mg) or limited solubility in water (e.g. Nb or Ba). If<br>
multiple modifiers are utilized, the impregnation may be simultaneous (e.g. co-impregnation) or<br>
sequential and support material may be impregnated through the use of one or multiple precursor<br>
solutions. Suitably, the amount of modifier impregnated on to the support material is between<br>
about 0.01 wt% and about 5.0 wt% of the support material, and preferably between about 0.1<br>
wt% and about 4.0 wt%.<br>
[0064] For the impregnating step, the volume of precursor solution may be selected so that it<br>
corresponds to up to about 110% of the pore volume of the support material. Volumes between<br>
about 95% and about 100% of the pore volume of the support material are preferred<br><br>
[0065} Typically, the modifier precursor solution is added to the support material and the<br>
support material is allowed absorb the precursor solution. This may be done drop wise until<br>
incipient wetness of the support material is substantially achieved. Alternatively, the support<br>
material may be placed by aliquots or batch wise into the precursor solution, A roto-immersion<br>
or other assistive apparatus may be used to achieve thorough contact between the support<br>
material and the precursor solution. Further, a spray device may be used such that the precursor<br>
solution is sprayed through a nozzle onto the support material, where it absorbed, A fixing step<br>
is typically not used to fix the modifier on to the support material, although this is not necessarily<br>
the case.<br>
[0066] The modifier may be distributed all throughout the support material, distributed as a<br>
shell, and as an egg white or as an egg-yolk. Other contacting techniques may be used. For<br>
example, modifiers may be contacted to a support material through a chemical vapor deposition<br>
process, such as described in US2001/0048970, which is incorporated by reference. Also, spray<br>
coating or otherwise layering a uniformly pre-impregnated support material, as an outer layer, on<br>
to an inner layer may be suitable.<br>
[0067] After the modifier precursor solution has been contacted to the support material,<br>
decanting, heat or reduced pressure may be used to remove any excess liquid not absorbed by the<br>
support material or to dry the support material.<br>
[0068] After at least one modifier has been contacted to the support material, a calcining step<br>
may also be employed. The calcining step typieally is before the catalytic components are<br>
contacted to the modified support material. The calcining step includes heating the support<br>
material in a non-reducing atmosphere (i.e. oxidizing or inert). During calcination, the modifiers<br>
on the support material are at least partially decomposed from their salts to a mixture of their<br>
oxide and free metal form.<br>
[0069] For example, the calcining step is carried out at a temperature in the range of about<br>
100°C to about 900°C, preferably between about 300°C and about 700°C. Non-reducing gases<br>
used for the calcination may included one or more inert or oxidizing gases such as helium,<br>
nitrogen, argon, neon, nitrogen oxides, oxygen, air, carbon dioxide, combinations thereof or the<br><br>
like. In one embodiment, the calcining step is carried out in an atmosphere of substantially pure<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, air or combinations thereof. Calcination times may vary but preferably are<br>
between about 1 and 5 hours. The degree of decomposition of the modifier salts depends on the<br>
temperature used and length of time the modified support material is calcined and can be<br>
followed by monitoring volatile decomposition products,<br>
|0070] Methods Of Making Catalysts<br>
[0071] In general the method includes contacting modified support material with catalytic<br>
components and reducing the catalytic components. Preferred methods of the present invention<br>
include impregnating the catalytic components into the support material, calcining the catalytic<br>
component containing support material, reducing the catalytic components and activating the<br>
reduced catalytic components on the support material. Additional steps such as fixing the<br>
catalytic components on the support material and washing the fixed catalytic components may<br>
also be included in the method of making the catalyst or pre-catalyst. Some of the steps listed<br>
above are optional and others may be eliminated (e.g. the washing and/fixing steps). In addition,<br>
some steps may be repeated (e.g. multiple impregnation or fix steps) and the order of the steps<br>
may be different from that listed above (e.g. the reducing step precedes the calcining step). To a<br>
certain extent, the contacting step will determine what later steps are needed for the formation of<br>
the catalyst.<br>
[0072} Contacting Step<br>
{0073} One particular approach to contacting is one pursuant to which an egg yolk eatalyst or<br>
pre-catalyst is formed, an egg white catalyst or pre-catalyst is formed, an all throughout catalyst<br>
or pre-catalyst is formed or a shell catalyst or pre-catalyst is formed, or a combination thereof. In<br>
one embodiment, techniques that form shell catalysts are preferred.<br>
{0074] The contacting step may be carried out using any of the modified support materials<br>
described above, with niobium, titanium and magnesium modifiers on support materials<br>
containing zirconia being the most favored. The contacting step is preferably carried out at<br>
ambient temperature and pressure conditions; however, reduced or elevated temperatures or<br>
pressures may be employed.<br><br>
[0075] In one preferred contacting step, a modified support material is impregnated with one<br>
or more aqueous solutions of the eatalytie components (referred to as eatalytie precursor<br>
solutions). The physical state of the support material during the contacting step may be a dry<br>
solid, a slurry, a sol-gel, a colloidal suspension or the like.<br>
[0076} In one embodiment, the catalytic components contained in the precursor solution are<br>
water soluble salts made of the eatalytie components, including but not limited to, chlorides,<br>
other halides, nitrates, nitrites, hydroxides, oxides, oxalates, acetates (OAc), and amines, with<br>
halide free salts being preferred and chloride free salts being more preferred. Examples of<br>
palladium salts suitable for use in precursor solutions include PdCl2, Na2PdCl4, Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2,<br>
Pd(NH3)4(OH)2, Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2, Pd(NO3)2, Pd(NH3)4(OAe)2, Pd(NH3)2(OAc)2, Pd(OAc)2 in<br>
KOB and/or NMe4OH and/or NaOH, Pd(NH3)4(HCO3)2 and palladium oxalate. Of the chloride-<br>
containing palladium precursors, Na2PdCl4 is most preferred. Of the chloride free palladium<br>
precursor salts, the following four are the most preferred: Pd(NH3)4(NO3)2, Pd(NO3)2,<br>
Pd(NH3)2(NO2)2, Pd{NH3)4(OH)2. Examples of gold salts suitable for use in precursor solution<br>
include AuCl3, HAuCl4, NaAuCU, KAuO2, NaAu02, NMe4AuO2, Au(OAc)3 in KOH and/or<br>
NMe4OH as well as HAu(NO3)4 in nitric acid, with KAuO2 being the most preferred of the<br>
chloride free gold precursors.<br>
[0077[ Furthermore, more than one salt may be used in a given precursor solution. For<br>
example, a palladium salt may be combined with a gold salt or two different palladium salts may<br>
be combined together in a single precursor solution. Precursor solutions typically may be made<br>
by dissolving the selected salt or salts in water, with or without solubility modifiers such as acids,<br>
bases or other solvents. Other non-aqueous solvents may also be suitable.<br>
[0078J The precursor solutions may be impregnated onto the support material simultaneously<br>
(e.g. co-impregnation) or sequentially and may be impregnated through the use of one or multiple<br>
precursor solutions. In addition, a catalytic component may be impregnated on to support<br>
material in multiple steps, such that a portion of the catalytic component is contacted each time.<br>
For example, one suitable protocol may include impregnating with Pd, followed by impregnating<br><br>
with Au, followed by impregnating again with Au, In another protocol, Pd and Au are preferably<br>
eo-impregnated.<br>
[0079} The order of impregnating the modified support material with the catalytic precursor<br>
solutions is not eritieal; although there may be some advantages to certain orders, as discussed<br>
below, with respect to the calcining step. Preferably, the palladium catalytic component is<br>
impregnated onto the support material first, with gold being impregnated after palladium, or last<br>
Also, the support material may be impregnated multiple times with the same catalytic<br>
component. For example, a portion of the overall gold contained in the catalyst may be first<br>
contacted, followed by contacting of a second portion of the gold. One more other steps may<br>
intervene between the steps in whieh gold is contacted to the support material, e.g. calcining,<br>
reducing, and/or fixing,<br>
[0080} The acid-base profile of the precursor solutions may influence whether a co-<br>
impregnation or a sequential impregnation is utilized. Thus, only precursor solutions with<br>
similar acid-base profile should be used together in a co-impregnating step; this eliminates any<br>
acid-base reactions that may foul the precursor solutions<br>
[0081 J For the impregnating step, the volume of precursor solution is selected so that it<br>
corresponds to between about 85% and about 110% of the pore volume of the support material.<br>
Volumes between about 95% and about 100% of the pore volume of the support material are<br>
preferred. Further, for one step fixing and modifying discussed below, the modifier precursor<br>
solution may make up a lower percentage of pore volume. For example, less than 50% of the<br>
pore volume, less than 25% of the pore volume or less than 10 % of the pore volume.<br>
[0082} Typically, the precursor solution is added to the support material and the support<br>
material is allowed absorb the precursor solution. This may be done drop wise until incipient<br>
wetness of the support material is substantially achieved. Alternatively, the support material may<br>
be placed by aliquots or batch wise into the precursor solution, A roto-immersion or other<br>
assistive apparatus may be used to achieve thorough contact between the support material and the<br>
precursor solution. Further, a spray device may be used such that the precursor solution is<br>
sprayed through a nozzle onto the support material, where it absorbed. Optionally, decanting,<br><br>
heat or reduced pressure may be used to remove any excess liquid not absorbed by the support<br>
material of to dry the support material after impregnation.<br>
10083] Other contacting techniques may be used to avoid a fixing step while still achieving a<br>
shell eatalyst For example, catalytic components may be contacted to a support material through<br>
a chemical vapor deposition process, such as described in US2Q01/0048970, which is<br>
incorporated by reference. Also, spray coating or otherwise layering a uniformly pre-<br>
impregnated support material, as an outer layer, on to an inner layer effectively forms shell<br>
catalyst that may also be described as a layered support material. In another technique,<br>
organometallic precursors of catalytic components, particularly with respect to gold, may be used<br>
to form shell catalysts, as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,700,753, which is incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
{0084] A physical shell formation technique may also be suitable for the production of shell<br>
catalysts. Here, the precursor solution may be sprayed onto a heated modified support material<br>
or a layered modified support material, where the solvent of the precursor solution evaporates<br>
upon contact with the heated support material, thus depositing the catalytic components in a shell<br>
on the support material. Preferably, temperatures between about 40 and 140°C may be used.<br>
Selecting the temperature of the support material and the flow rate of the solution through the<br>
spray nozzle may be used control the thickness of the shell. For example, with temperatures<br>
above about 100°C, a relatively thin shell is formed. This embodiment may be particularly<br>
useful when chloride free precursors are utilized to help enhance the shell formation on the<br>
support material. See for example U.S. Patent Publication 20050181940.<br>
{0085} One skilled in the art will understand that a combination of the contacting steps may<br>
be an appropriate method of forming a contacted support material.<br>
{0086] Fixing Step<br>
{0087} It may be desirable to transform at least a portion of the catalytic components on the<br>
contacted and modified support material from a water-soluble form to a water-insoluble form.<br>
Such a step may be referred to as a fixing step. This may be accomplished by applying a fixing<br>
agent (e.g. dispersion in a liquid, such as a solution) to the impregnated support material which<br><br>
causes at least a portion of the catalytic components to precipitate. This fixing step helps to form<br>
a shell catalyst, but is not required to form sheii catalysts.<br>
(0088} Any suitable fixing agent may be used, with hydroxides (e.g. alkali metal hydroxides),<br>
silicates, borates, carbonates and bicarbonates in aqueous solutions being preferred. The<br>
preferred fixing agent is NaOH. Fixing may be accomplished by adding the fixing agent to the<br>
support material before, during or after the precursor solutions are impregnated on the support<br>
material. Typically, the fixing agent is used subsequent to the contacting step such that the<br>
contacted support material is allowed to soak in the fixing agent solution for about 1 to about 24<br>
hours. The specific time depends upon the combination of the precursor solution and the fixing<br>
agent. Like the impregnating step, an assistive device, such as a roto immersion apparatus as<br>
described in U.S. Patent No, 5,332,710, which is incorporated herein by reference, may<br>
advantageously be used in the fixing step.<br>
[00891 The fixing step may be accomplished in one or multiple steps, referred as a co-fix or a<br>
separate fix. In a co-fix, one or more volumes of a fixing agent solution is applied to the<br>
contacted support material after all the relevant precursor solutions have been contacted to the<br>
support material, whether the contact was accomplished through the use of one or multiple<br>
precursor solutions. For example, fixing after sequential impregnation with a palladium<br>
precursor solution and a gold precursor solution would be a co-fix. An example of co-fixing may<br>
be found in U.S. Patent No. 5,314,888, which is incorporated by reference.<br>
[0090] A separate fix, on the other hand, would include applying a fixing agent solution<br>
during or after each impregnation with a precursor solution. For example, the following<br>
protocols would be a separate fix: a) impregnating palladium followed by fixing followed by<br>
impregnating with gold followed by fixing; or b) co-impregnating with palladium followed by<br>
fixing followed by impregnating with gold followed by fixing. Between a fix and subsequent<br>
impregnation, any excess liquid may be removed and the support material dried, although this is<br>
not necessarily the ease. An example of separate fixing may be found in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,034,030, which is incorporated by reference.<br><br>
[0091] in another embodiment, the fixing step and the contacting step are conducted<br>
simultaneously, one example of which is described in U.S. Patent No. 4,048,096, which is<br>
incorporated by reference. For example, a simultaneous fix might be: impregnating with<br>
palladium followed by fixing followed by impregnating with gold and fixing agent In a<br>
variation on this embodiment, the fix may be conducted twice for a catalytic component. A<br>
catalytic component may be partially fixed when it is contacted to the support material (called a<br>
"pre-fix"), followed an additional, final fix. For example: impregnating with palladium followed<br>
by impregnating with gold and a pre-fixing agent followed by fixing with a final fixing agent.<br>
This technique may be used to help insure the formation of shell type catalyst as opposed to an<br>
all throughout catalyst<br>
[0092] In another embodiment of the simultaneous fixing and contacting step, the fixing<br>
solution is impregnated into the modified support material such that between about 25 and about<br>
95% of the pore volume is filled. Preferably, between about 70 and about 90% of the pore<br>
volume is filled by the fixing solution. The remainder of the pore volume is then filled with the<br>
catalytic precursor solution. Step-wise or Go-impregnation of the catalytic precursor may be<br>
used. This simultaneous fix and contacting step avoids the need for a drying step, thus<br>
simplifying the process. Examples of fixing solutions include those comprising alkali metal<br>
hydroxides, alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal bicarbonates or mixtures thereof. The fixing<br>
solutions may also be buffered to help maintain the pH of the solution.<br>
(0093] In another embodiment particularly suitable for use with chloride free precursors, the<br>
modified support material is pre-treated with a fixing agent to adjust the properties of the support<br>
material. In this embodiment, the support material is first impregnated with either an acid or<br>
base solution, typically free of metals. After drying, the support material is impregnated with a<br>
precursor solution that has the opposite acidity/alkalinity as the dried support material. The<br>
ensuing acid-base reaction forms a shell of catalytic components on the support material. For<br>
example, nitric acid may be used to pre-treat a support material that in turn is impregnated with a<br>
basic precursor solution such as Pd(OH}2 or Au(OH)3. This formation technique may be<br>
considered as using a fixing step followed by a contacting step.<br><br>
[0094] In another embodiments the modified support may be pre-treated before impregnation<br>
of the Pd and or Au in order to neutralize potentially chemically reactive sites on the support<br>
material which may cause poor shell formation. For example, a basic support (e.g. zirconia) may<br>
be pre-treated with HC1 to neutralize selected sites, followed by with Pd and Au impregnation<br>
and by fixing with base.<br>
(0095] The concentration of fixing agent in the solution is typically a molar excess of the<br>
amount of catalytic components impregnated on the support material. The amount of fixing<br>
agent should be between about 1.0 to about 3.0, preferably about 1.1 to about 2.0 times the<br>
amount necessary to react with the catalytically active cations present in the water-soluble salt.<br>
[0096] The volume of fixing agent solution supplied generally should be an amount<br>
sufficient to cover the available free surfaces of the impregnated support material This may be<br>
accomplished by introducing, for example, a volume that is greater than the pore volume of the<br>
contacted support material.<br>
[0097] The combination of impregnating and fixing steps can form a shell type catalyst. But,<br>
the use of halide free precursor solutions also permits the formation of a shell catalyst while<br>
optionally eliminating the fixing step. In the absence of a chloride precursor, a washing step, as<br>
discussed below, may be obviated. Further, the process can be free of a step of fixing catalytic<br>
components that would otherwise be needed to survive the washing step. Because no washing<br>
step is needed, the catalytic components need not be fixed to survive the washing step.<br>
Subsequent steps in the method making the catalyst do not require the catalytic components be<br>
fixed and thus the remainder of the step maybe carried out without additional preparatory steps.<br>
Overall, the use of ehloride free precursors permits a catalyst or pre-catalyst production method<br>
that is free of a step of washing, thus reducing the number of steps needed to produce the catalyst<br>
and eliminating the need to dispose of chloride containing waste.<br>
[0098] Washing Step<br>
[0099] Particularly, when halide containing precursor solutions are utilized and in other<br>
applications as desired, after the fixing step, the fixed support material may be washed to remove<br>
any halide residue on the support or otherwise treated to eliminate the potential negative effect of<br><br>
a contaminant on the support material. The washing step included rinsing the fixed support<br>
material in water, preferably deionized water. Washing may be done in a batch or a continuous<br>
mode. Washing at room temperature should continue until the effluent wash water has a halide<br>
ion content of less than about 1000 ppm, and more preferably until the final effluent gives a<br>
negative result to a silver nitrate test. The washing step may be carried out after or<br>
simultaneously with the reducing step, discussed below, but preferably is carried out before. As<br>
discussed above, the use of halide free precursor solutions permits the elimination of the washing<br>
step.<br>
[00100} Calcining Step of Catalytic Components<br>
[00101] After at least one catalytic component has been contacted to the support material, one<br>
or more a calcining steps may be employed, although this is not necessarily the case and in some<br>
instances is not preferred. The calcining step typically is before the reducing step and after the<br>
fixing step (if such a step is used) but may take place elsewhere in the process. In another<br>
embodiment, the calcining step is carried out after the reducing step. The calcining step includes<br>
heating the support material in a non-reducing atmosphere (i.e. oxidizing or inert). During<br>
calcination, the catalytic components on the modified support material are at least partially<br>
decomposed from their salts to a mixture of their oxide and free metal form.<br>
[00102] For example, the calcining step is carried out at a temperature in the range of about<br>
100°C to about 700°C, preferably between about 200°C and about 500°C. Non-reducing gases<br>
used for the calcination may included one or more inert or oxidizing gases such as helium,<br>
nitrogen, argon, neon, nitrogen oxides, oxygen^ air, carbon dioxide, combinations thereof or the<br>
like. In one embodiment, the calcining step is carried out in an atmosphere of substantially pure<br>
nitrogen, oxygen, air or combinations thereof. Calcination times may vary but preferably are<br>
between about 1 and 5 hours. The degree of decomposition of the catalytic component salts<br>
depends on the temperature used and length of time the impregnated catalyst is calcined and can<br>
be followed by monitoring volatile decomposition products. Optionally, on zirconia support<br>
materials, only the Pd is calcined.<br>
[00103] Reducing Step<br><br>
[00104] Another step employed generally herein to at least partially transform any remaining<br>
catalytic components from a salt or oxide form to a catalytically active state, such as by a<br>
reducing step. Typically this is done by exposure of salts or oxides to a reducing agent, examples<br>
of which include ammonia, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, hydrocarbons, olefins, aldehydes,<br>
alcohols, hydrazine, primary amines, carboxylic acids, carboxylic acid salts, carboxylic acid<br>
esters and combinations thereof. Hydrogen, ethylene, propylene, alkaline hydrazine and alkaline<br>
formaldehyde and combinations thereof are preferred reducing agents with ethylene and<br>
hydrogen blended with inert gases particularly preferred. Although reduction employing a<br>
gaseous environment is preferred, a reducing step carried with a liquid environment may also be<br>
used (e.g. employing a reducing solution). The temperature selected for the reduction can range<br>
from ambient up to about 550°C. Reduction times will typically vary from about 1 to about 10<br>
hours, with 5 hours preferred.<br>
[00105} Since the process used to reduce the catalytic components may influences the<br>
characteristics of the final catalyst, conditions employed for the reduction may be varied<br>
depending on whether high activity, high selectivity or some balance of these properties is<br>
desired.<br>
[00106} In one embodiment, palladium is contacted to the support material, fixed and reduced<br>
before gold is contacted and reduced, as described in U.S. Patent Nos. 6,486,093, 6,015,769 and<br>
related patents, all of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
[00107J Exemplary protocols including a reducing step include: a) impregnating with<br>
palladium followed by optionally calcining followed by impregnating with gold followed by<br>
reducing; b) co-impregnating with palladium and gold followed by optionally calcining followed<br>
by reducing; or e) impregnating with palladium followed by optionally calcining followed by<br>
reducing followed by impregnating with gold.<br>
[00108} Activating Step<br>
[00109] Usually after the reducing step and before the catalyst is used, an activating step is<br>
desirable. While the catalyst may be used without the activating step, the step has several<br>
beneficial results, including lengthening the operational life time of the catalyst. The activating<br><br>
step may be accomplished in accordance with conventional practice. Namely, the reduced<br>
support material is contacted with an activating agent, such as an alkali metal salt (e.g.<br>
carboxylate and/or alkali metal hydroxide), prior to use. Conventional alkali metal carboxylates<br>
such as the sodium, potassium, lithium and cesium salts of C2-4 aliphatic carboxylic acids are<br>
employed for this purpose. A preferred activating agent in the production of VA is an alkali<br>
acetate, with potassium acetate (KOAc) being the most preferred.<br>
(00110} The support material may optionally be impregnated with a solution of the activating<br>
agent. After drying, the catalyst may contain, for example, about 10 to about 70 grams,<br>
preferably about 20 to about 60 grams of activating agent per liter of Gatalyst.<br>
[00111] Methods of Making Alkenyl Alkanoates<br>
(00112] The present invention may be utilized to produce alkenyl alkanoates from an aikene,<br>
alkanoic acid and an oxygen containing gas in the presence of a catalyst. Preferred alkene<br>
starting materials contain from two to four carbon atoms (e.g. ethylene, propylene and n-butene).<br>
Preferred alkanoic acid starting materials used in the process of this invention for producing<br>
alkenyl alkanoates contain from two to four carbon atoms (e.g., acetic, propionic and butyric<br>
acid). Preferred products of the process are VA, vinyl propionate, vinyl butyrate, and allyl<br>
acetate. The most preferred starting materials are ethylene and acetic acid with the VA being the<br>
most preferred product. Thus, the present invention is useful in the production of olefinically<br>
unsaturated Garboxylic esters from an olefinically unsaturated compound, a carboxylic acid and<br>
oxygen in the presence of a catalyst. Although the rest of the specification discusses VA<br>
exclusively, it should be understood that the catalysts, method of making the catalysts and<br>
production methods are equally applicable to other alkenyl alkanoates, and the description is not<br>
intended as limiting the application of the invention to V A.<br>
(00113] When VA is produced using the catalyst of the present invention, a stream of gas,<br>
which contains ethylene, oxygen or air, and acetic acid is passed over the catalyst. The<br>
composition of the gas stream can be varied within wide limits, taking in account the zone of<br>
flammability of the effluent. For example, the molar ratio of ethylene to oxygen can be about<br>
80:20 to about 98:2, the molar ratio of acetic acid to ethylene can be about 100:1 to about 1:100,<br><br>
preferably about 10:1 to 1:10, and most preferably about 1:1 to about 1:8. The gas stream may<br>
also contain gaseous alkali metal acetate and/or inert gases, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide<br>
and/or saturated hydrocarbons. Reaction temperatures which can be used are elevated<br>
temperatures, preferably those in the range of about 125-220°C. The pressure employed can be a<br>
somewhat reduced pressure, normal pressure or elevated pressure, preferably a pressure of up to<br>
about 20 atmospheres gauge.<br>
[00114] In addition to fixed bed reactors, the methods of producing alkenyl alkanoates and the<br>
catalyst of the present invention may also be suitably employed in other types of reaction, for<br>
example, fluidized bed reactors.<br>
[00115] The methods of VA production preferably achieve an EA/VA ratio of less than about<br>
800 ppm, more preferably less than about 400 ppm, more preferably less than about 250 ppm and<br>
most preferably less than about 200 ppm. The methods also preferably achieve a CO2 selectivity<br>
of less than about 10%, and more preferably less than about 9% and most preferably less than 8%<br>
when the 02 conversion is 45%. Most preferably, the catalyst will have both the EA/VA ratio<br>
and CO2 selectivity discussed above.<br>
[00116] Moreover, the present methods of VA production preferably result in maintained or<br>
improved CO2 selectivities as compared to a standard catalyst utilized in similar processing<br>
conditions. A standard catalyst is any catalyst that may be used as a control, and preferably does<br>
not include a modified support material. To make the comparison, the standard catalyst is used<br>
as a control in the same or similar processing conditions as processing conditions for the<br>
modified support material catalyst. The catalyst on the modified support material need only<br>
match (or improve upon) the CO2 selectivity of the standard catalyst at a given O2 conversion.<br>
One example of a catalyst that may be used as a standard catalyst is shown in U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,352,710, hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[00117] Examples of Catalysts on Modified Support Materials<br>
[00118] Combinatorial/High Throughput chemistry and analysis techniques were utilized to<br>
screen catalysts with modified support materials. The compositional space for the screened<br>
catalysts included those with gold and palladium as catalytic components where the atomic ratio<br><br>
of gold to palladium is between 0.3 to 1.2. Support materials included: KA460 (silica-alumina),<br>
Norpro XZ 16052 (zirconia), Aerolyst 350 (silica), Grace SP-9600 (silica), Grace SP-9601<br>
(silica), Grace SP-9599 (silica), Grace SP-9602 (silica), Grace SP189043.USA3 (zircono-silica),<br>
Grace SP18-9534 (titano-silicate), Norpro XZ 16075 (zirconia) and Norpro XZ 16052 (zirconia).<br>
The above support materials were modified with Bay Mg, Ce, K, Ca, Nb, Ta, Ti, Y, Sr, Z, La, Pr,<br>
V, Mo, Rb, and selected bimetallic combinations discussed above. Unmodified support<br>
materials were also tested as controls.<br>
[00119] Modified support materials other than zirconia were prepared by impregnating 0.5 g<br>
samples of support (dried at 120 °C for at least 2 h) to incipient wetness with modifier precursor<br>
solutions to achieve one of three levels: 1.0,2.0 and 4.0 wt %. This was followed by drying at<br>
105 °C for at least 2 h and calcination at 500 QC, with 2°C/min heating rate. A robot from<br>
Hamilton was used to do all liquid dispensing<br>
[00120} The modified support materials were impregnated to incipient wetness with a solution<br>
of Pd(NH3)4(OH)2 to a Pd loading of 42.6 g Pd/L catalyst. During and after impregnation, the<br>
support materials were homogenized for at least 1 h. After impregnation, the support materials<br>
were dried in air at 105 °C for at least 2 h, and then calcined in air at 350 °C for 2 h, with a<br>
heating rate of 2 °C/min.<br>
[00121] Next, the modified support materials were impregnated to incipient wetness with<br>
freshly prepared 1 M [KOH + Au(OH)3] solution to achieve Au:Pd ratios of 0.45, 0.6, 0,9, and<br>
1.2. During and after impregnation, the impregnated support materials were homogenized for at<br>
least 1 h, followed by drying in air at 105 °C for at least 2 h.<br>
(00122] The modified support materials with the catalytic components were reduced in 7%<br>
hydrogen in nitrogen. The samples were placed in small crucibles in which the Gatalyst bed was<br>
about 1 to 3 mm deep. A flow of 100 mL was maintained throughout the reduction, with a<br>
2°C/min healing rate, 5 h at 350 °C. After reduction, the samples were activated by impregnation<br>
with a KOAc solution to 40 g KOAc/L catalyst and dried at 105 °C for at least 2 h.<br><br>
[00123] Modified zirconia support materials were made using essentially that same procedure<br>
as discussed above, except that no calcination took place after Pd impregnation and the reduction<br>
utilized 5% ethylene in nitrogen at 150°C.<br>
[00124] Catalysts prepared according to this protocol were heterogeneousiy diluted with<br>
support material containing 40 g/1 KOAc to give an overall Pd loading of 7 g/1. The simulated<br>
shell catalysts were tested using a standard line-in protocol to test the catalysts' CO2 selectivity<br>
and EA/VA ratios using a parallel reactor system. The standard protocol included testing the<br>
catalysts for 8 hours under normal feeds at 145°C (13.8% HOAc, 40% C2H4, 7.9% O2 and 38%<br>
N2, P=10 arm, SV = 138 cc/min/cc catalyst). A temperature ramp of 155°C, 165°C, 175°C and<br>
145°C was then used to obtain information on each catalyst. Catalysts that showed CO2<br>
selectivity less than about 9.0% at 45% O2 conversion and an EA/VA ratio of less than 800 ppm<br>
were deemed acceptable.<br>
[00125] Catalysts on modified support materials that showed acceptable CO2 selectivity and<br>
EA/VA ratios are shown in the table below:<br><br>
[00126] Based on the results above, other levels of modifier (e.g. 0.1 wt % and 0.4 wt %)<br>
and/or other Au:Pd ratios were tested to optimize the CO2 selectivity and the EA/VA ratio.<br>
Furthermore, variations in catalyst preparation conditions were also tested (e.g. different<br>
calcination temperatures, impregnation methods and/or different reduction conditions).<br>
[00127] To differentiate between the acceptable catalysts, a high temperature deactivation test<br>
was used. Normal feeds (13.8% HOAc, 40% C2H4,7.9% 02 and 38% N2, P=10 atm, SV = 138<br>
cc/min/cc catalyst) were used for 8 hours at 180°C as a line-in protocol. The line-in was<br>
followed by a temperature ramp of 165°C, 175°C, 185°C, 195°C and 165°C. Catalysts that<br><br>
showed acceptable properties under a more stringent set of guidelines (e.g. an EA/VA ratio of<br>
less than about 250 ppm with acceptable CO2 selectivity at 45% O2 conversion) would be the<br>
most preferred of the catalysts on the modified support materials. Under this protocol, the most<br>
preferred modified supports include niobium, titanium and magnesium on zirconia support<br>
materials. Also preferred were titanium and zirconium modifiers on the titano-silicate.<br>
[00128] Comparison of catalysts with and without modified support materials may be carried<br>
out using any VA synthetic procedure so long as the same procedure is used to test both types of<br>
catalysts. It will be further appreciated that functions or structures of a plurality of components<br>
or steps may be combined into a single component or step, or the functions or structures of one-<br>
step or component may be split among plural steps or components. The present invention<br>
contemplates all of these combinations. Unless stated otherwise, dimensions and geometries of<br>
the various structures depicted herein are not intended to be restrictive of the invention, and other<br>
dimensions or geometries are possible. Plural structural components or steps can he provided by<br>
a single integrated structure or step. Alternatively, a single integrated structure or step might be<br>
divided into separate plural components or steps. In addition, while a feature of the present<br>
invention may have been described in the context of only one of the illustrated embodiments,<br>
such feature may be combined with one or more other features of other embodiments, for any<br>
given application. It will also be appreciated from the above that the fabrication of the unique<br>
structures herein and the operation thereof also constitute methods in accordance with the present<br>
invention.<br>
[00129] The explanations and illustrations presented herein are intended to acquaint others<br>
skilled in the art with the invention, its principles, and its practical application. Those skilled in<br>
the art may adapt and apply the invention in its numerous forms, as may be best suited to the<br>
