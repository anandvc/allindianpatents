the air conduit 213 and into the dryer 90 such that<br>
the introduced atmospheric air is heated in the gap<br>
101 by virtue of heat flow from the peripheral wall<br>
11 of the furnace 10 into the gap 101; a temperature<br>
sensor 200 (see Fig. 5) mounted in the dryer 90 for<br>
measuring  temperature  in  the  dryer  90  and  for<br>

7<br>
pinion-and-rack unit 84 includes a rack 841 secured to the upper disc 87, and a pinion 842 coupled to the driving unit 843 and meshing with the rack 841 so as to permit rotation of the upper disc 87 relative to the lower disc 85 between an open position (see Figs. 3 and 4), in which, the upper and lower slots 871, 851 overlap, thereby permitting atmospheric air to be introduced into the enlarged end 821 of the second section 82 via the upper and lower slots 871, 851 upon actuation of the air blower 86, and a closed position, in which, the upper and lower slots 871, 851 are offset from each other and are closed by the lower and upper discs  85,  87,  respectively,  thereby  prevent ing atmospheric air from flowing into the enlarged end 821 of the second section 82 via the upper and lower slots 871, 851. The control unit 300 is electrically connected to the driving unit 843 for moving the upper disc 8 7 between the open and closed positions based on the temperature in the dryer 90 so as to vary flow rate of atmospheric air into the air conduit via the upper and lower slots 871, 851 and so as to adjust the temperature in the dryer 90.<br>
A feeding device 30 is connected to the furnace 10 for feeding the solid waste into the furnace 10, and includes a hopper 31 with a bottom outlet 332, a rotary wheel 352 driven by the feed motor 35 and rotatably disposed in the hopper 31 for feeding the<br><br>
8<br>
solid waste to the bottom outlet 332, a pipe 33 interconnecting the bottom outlet 332 and the furnace 10, and a blower 32 connected to the bottom outlet 332 for delivering the solid waste into the furnace 10 via the pipe 33.<br>
A main blower 71 is connected to the furnace 10 via an air pipe 72 for delivering air into the furnace 10 .<br>
A perforated supporting plate 13 is disposed in the bottom section 111 of the furnace 10 for supporting the solid waste, and is formed with a plurality of holes 131 for passage of ash therethrough. Ash falling from the supporting plate 13 via the holes 131 is transferred to a bottom exit 115 of the furnace 10 via a second rotary wheel 51 driven by a motor 52. Another blower 53 is connected to the bottom exit 115 for delivering the falling ash into the cyclone separator 40 via a pipe 54. A rake 552 is disposed rotatably over the supporting plate 13 for stirring ash on the supporting plate 13 and for facilitating falling of ash through the holes 131 so as to increase combustion efficiency of the furnace 10. A rake motor 55 is connected to the rake 552 for rotating the rake 552. The control unit 300 is electrically connected to the rake motor 55 for controlling rotating speed of the rake motor 55 based on the temperature in the dryer 90 so as to adjust the temperature in the dryer 90.<br><br>
