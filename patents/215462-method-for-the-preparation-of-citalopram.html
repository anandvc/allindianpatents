				<td>The present invention relates to a method for the preparation of the well known anti¬depressant drug citalopram, l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fiuoropheny!)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile.<br>
Background of the Invention.<br>
Citalopram is a well-known antidepressant drug that has now been on the market for some years and has the following structure:<br><br>
It is a selective, centrally acting serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, having antidepressant activities. The antidepressant activity of the compound has been repaned in several publications, e.g. J. Hyttel, Prog. Neuro-PsychopharmacoL &amp; Biol Psychiat., 1982, 6, 277-295 and A. Gravem, Acta Psychiatr. Scand., 1987, 75 , 478-486. The compound has also been disclosed to show effects in the treatment of dementia and cerebrovascular disorders, EP-A 474580.<br>
Citalopram was first disclosed in DE 2,657,271 corresponding to US 4,136,193. This patent publication describes the preparation of citalopram by one method and outlines a further method that may be used for preparing citalopram.<br>
According to the process described, the corresponding l-{4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydro-5-isobenzofurancarbonitrile is reacted -with 3-(N,N-dimemylamino^)ropyl-chloride in the presence of memylsulfinylmethide as condensing agent. The starting material was prepared from the corresponding 5-bromo derivative by reaction with cuprous cyanide.<br>
According to the second method, which is only outlined in general terms, citalopram may be chained by ring closure of the compound:<br><br><br>
is subjected to a ring closure reaction by dehydration with strong sulfuric acid in order to obtain citalopram. The intermediate of formula III was prepared from 5-cyanophthalide by two successive Grignard reactions, i.e, with 4-fluoropheny! magnesium halogenide and N.N-dimethylaminopropyl magnesium halogenide, respectively.<br>
Further processes are disclosed in International patent application Nos. WO 98/019511, WO 98/019512 and WO 98/019513. WO 98/019512 and WO 98/019513 relate to methods wherein a 5-amino-, 5-carboxy- or 5-(sec. aminocarbonyl)phthalide is subjected to two successive Grignard reactions, ring closure and conversion of the resulting 1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran derivative to the corresponding 5-cyano compound, i.e. citalopram. International patent application No. WO 98/019511 discloses a process for the manufacture of atalopram wherein a (4-substituted-2-bydroxymethylphenyl-{4-fluorpheiiyl)methanol rrutij*.!^ is subjected to ring closure and the resulting 5-substituted l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihytinnsobeiizofuran converted to the corresponding 5-cyano derivative and alkylated with a (3Hmnetfaylamino)pTopylhalogenide in order to obtain citalopram.<br><br>
Finally, methods of preparing the individual enantioroers of citalopram are disclosed m US Patent No 4,943,590 from which it also appears that the ring closure of the intermediate of formula ID may be carried out via a labile ester with a base.<br>
It has now been found that citalopram may be obtained in a high yield as a very pure product by a new process in which an optionally substituted 2-[l-[3-(dimethyIamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyl)-l,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yl]oxazoline or -thiazoline is converted in one step to citalopram substantially without any occurrence of undesired side-reactions.<br>
It has also been found that it is possible to prepare the optionally substituted 2-[l-[3-(dimeth-ylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyI)-l,3-dtoydroisoberizofuran-5-yl] oxazoline or -thiazoline intermediate directly starting from 5-carboxyphthalide, by formation of its amide with an optionally substituted 2-hydroxy-ethylamine or 2-mercapto-eraylamine and ring closure. The intermediate oxazolines and thiazolines are stable under the Grignard reaction conditions.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a novel method for the preparation of citalopram, its enantiomers and acid addition salts thereof comprising treatment of a compound of formula IV<br><br>
wherein X is 0 or S;<br>
R1 - R2 are each independently selected from hydrogen and C,^ alkyl, or R1 and R! together form a Cj.5 alkylene chain thereby forming a spiro-ring; RJ is selected from hydrogen and C,j alkyl, R4 is selected from hydrogen, CM alkyl, a carboxy group or a precursor group mereabre, or R5 and R* together form a CJ.J alkylene chain Uiereby forming a spiro-ring; with a dehydration agent or alternatively where X is S, thermally cleavage of the thiazoline ring or treatment with a radical initiator, such as peroxide or with light, to form citalopram having the formula<br><br><br>
as the base or an acid addition salt thereof, and thereafter optionally converting said base or said acid addition salt to a pharmaceuticalty acceptable salt thereof.<br>
The dehydration agent may be any suitable dehydration agent conventionally used in the art, such as phosphoroxytrichloride, thionylchloride, phosphorpentachloride, PPA (polyphosphoric acid), and P4O(0. The reaction may be carried out in the presence of an organic base, such as pyridine.<br>
Alternatively, the dehydration agent may be a Vilsmeier reagent, i.e. a compound which is formed by reaction of a chlorinating agent, preferably an acid chloride, e.g. phosgene, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphoroxychloride, phosphorpentachloride, trichloromethyl eiuonjformale, also briefly referred to as "diphosgene", or bis(trichloromethyl) carbonate, also briefly referred to as "triphosgene", with a tertiary amide such as N,N" dnnethylfonnamide or a N,N-dialkylaIkanamide, e.g N,N-dimethylacetamide. A classic Vilsmeyer reagent is the chloromethylenediraethyliminium chloride. The Vilsmeier reagent is preferably prepared in situ by adding the chlorinating agent to a mixture containing the starting oxazoline or thiazoline derivative of formula IV and the tertiary amide.<br>
When X is S and the conversion of the thiazoline group into the cyano group is made by thermal transformation, the thermal decomposition of compound IV is preferably carried out in an anhydrous organic solvent, more preferably an aprotic polar solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide, dimethylsulfoxide or acetonitrile. The temperature at which the thermal decomposition transforms the 2-thiazolyl group to a cyano group is between 60 °C and 140 "C. The thermal decomposition may conveniently be carried out by reflux in a suitable solvent, preferably acetonitrile. The thermal cleavage may ^jB%i-JujUy be carried out in the presence of oxygen or an oxidation agent. Compounds of ibnmna XV where X is S and R* is a carboxy group or a precursor for a carboxy group can also be converted to citalopram by treatment with a radical initiator such as light or peroxides.<br><br>
In a further aspect, the invention relates to the above process in which the compound of formula IV is in the form of the S-enantiomer.<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention relates, to citalopram and S-citalopram manufactured by the process of the invention and an antidepressant pharmaceutical composition comprising citalopram or S-citalopram manufactured by the process of the invention.<br>
According to the present invention, it has surprisingly been found that the oxazoiine or thiazoline group may be introduced into the S-position of phthalide and that remain stable during the subsequent reactions.<br>
Furthermore, it has been found that the 1,1-disubstituted isobenzofurancarbonyl group in the intermediate of formula IV is surprisingly stable and that the reaction of the 2-[l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-l-(4-fiuorophenyl)-l,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-yI]oxazoIine or -thiazoline with a dehydration reagent, in particular by a Vilsmeier reagent, to give the corresponding nitrile, i.e. citalopram, may be carried out at higher temperatures than those described in relation to such dehydration reactions in the literature.<br>
It has also been found that, due to the combined stability of the optionally substituted 2-oiazD&amp;yi or 2-thiazolinyI group and the 1,1-disubstituted isobenzofuranyl group, it is possible to prepare the 2-[l-[3-(o^emylaniino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyI)-I,3-dihydro-isobenzofuran-5-yl]oxazolme or -thiazoline intermediate IV and, hence, citalopram and its salts in pure form, starting directly from 5-carboxyphthalide.<br>
By the process of the invention, citalopram is obtained as a pure product in good yield thereby reducing costly purification processes.<br>
According to the present invention, the compound of formula IV may be prepared from 5-carboxyphthalide and transformed to citalopram and its salts by a process, comprising:<br>
a) reacting a functional derivative of 5-carboxyphthalide of formula V<br><br>
with a 2-hydroxy- or 2-mercaptoethanamine of formula VI<br><br><br><br>
in which X, R" - R" are as defined above, to a ring closure by dehydration;<br>
(e)	reacting the 2-[l-[3-(dimethylamino)propyi]-l-(4-fluorophenyl&gt;l,3-dihydroisoben20-<br>
furan-5-yrjoxazoline or -thiazoline thus obtained of formula IV<br><br>
in which X, R1 - R4 are as defined above, with a dehydration reagent or alternatively if X is S subjecting the compound of formula IV to a thermal decomposition reaction, or treatment with a radical initiator; and isolating the thus obtained citaloprara in form of the free base or as an acid addition salt thereof; and<br>
(f)	optionally converting said free base or said acid addition salt to a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable sah thereof.<br>
The taai synthesis of citalopram as outlined above, comprises the use of novel intermediates for the preparation of the intermediary oxazolines or thiazolines by reaction of a 5-carboxyphthalide with an optionally substituted etanolamine or mercaptoethylamine and ring closure of the amide thus obtained.<br>
The functional derivative of 5-carboxyphthaIide used in step (a) is a acid halide thereof, the anhydride, a mixed anhydride, an active ester, for example the 4-nitiophenylester, or the free acid, suitably activated for example with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. A preferred functional derivative is the acid chloride, which may be obtained by reaction of the free acid with thioriyl chloride and straightforwardly made to react in situ with the 2-hydroxy-ethylamine or 2-mercapto ethylamine of formula VI. The 5-carboxyphtalide can be prepared from 5-cyanopiflaBdc.<br>
Another advantageous functional derivative is the mixed anhydride with a monoester of caiixHiic acid, preferably with carbonic acid monoethylester, which may be obtained from 5-earboxyphtnatide and ethyl chloroformate and directly"made to react in situ with the 2-aydruxy-isthyl juine or 2-mercapto ethylamine of formula VI.<br><br>
In the starting material of formula VI, R1 - R4 are preferably selected from methyl or ethyl or hydrogen or one of the pairs of R1 and R2 or R3 and R\ respectively, are linked in order to form a 1,4-butylene or a 1,5-pentylene group. Most preferably, R" and R1 and R3 and R4, respectively, are identical. The preferred reagents are 2-amino-2-methyl-l-pTopanol, 2-amino-2-methyl-l-propanthiol, 2-amino-3-hydroxy-propionic acid (R,S-serine, R-serine, and S-serine) and R,S-cysteine, R-cysteine and S-cysteine. The compounds of formula VI are commercially available or may be prepared from commercially available compounds using conventional methods.<br>
The reaction of the functional derivative of 5-carboxyphthalide (V) with the ethanolamine of mercaptoethylamine VI is carried at a temperature of 10-40 °C, preferably at 15-25 °C, in an aprotic organic solvent such as an ether, for example methyl t-butyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a ketone, for example acetone or methylisobutylketone, a hydrocarbon, for example toluene, or a chlorinated solvent, for example dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane or 1,1,1" trichloroethane. Preferably, a hydrocarbon, conveniently toluene, is used when the functional derivative is the chloride, whereas a ketone, conveniently acetone, is used wben thtf functional derivative is a mixed anhydride. The reaction occurs in the usual manner of formation of the amides. However, when the activated acid derivative is the 5-carboxy phthafide chloride, the reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an inorganic base such as sodium or potassium carbonate, whereas an organic base such as triethylamintf may be employed when, for example, the mixed anhydride with carbonic acid monoethylestef is used as functional derivative.<br>
In step (b), the amide of formula VH is submitted to a ring closure reaction by dehydration, preferably by treatment with thionyl chloride. The amide of formula V is added to the dehydration agent at low temperature, namely at less than 10 °C, preferably less than 5 "C, most preferred between -10 °C and 3 °C. When thionyl chloride is used, the temperature is advantageously less than 0 DC, preferably about -10 °C. Then the temperature is allowed to rise to 20 °C and the reaction is completed at a temperature of 20-40 °C, preferably at 25-35 °C, most preferred at 28 to 30 °C.<br>
When thionyl chloride is used as the dehydrating agent the 2-(l-oxo-l,3-dihydroisobenzo-mm-S-yTjnxzzoims or -thiazoline of formula VTD is obtained in the form of a hydrocloride which may be isolated by dilution with an etheric solvent, preferably tetrahydrofuran.  The corresponding base may be isolated by precipitation from an aqueous alkaline solution of the rrydrochloride.<br><br>
The above steps (a) and (b) can be carried out as a one-pot process, namely without isolating the amide of formula VEL<br>
In step (c), the compound of formula VIII thus obtained is submitted to two subsequent Grignard reactions. In particular, it is reacted under usual conditions with a 4-fiuorophenyl magnesium halide, conveniently the chloride or the bromide, preferably the bromide, and preferably using tetrahydrofuran as solvent The reaction mixture is then treated with a [3-(dimethylamino)propyl]magnesiumhalogenide, conveniently the chloride or bromide, preferably the chloride, dissolved in the same solvent used for the previous Grignard reaction, preferably tetrahydrofuran, using the usual conditions of a Grignard reaction.<br>
The2-[3-hydroxymethyi-4-[(]^4-fJuorophenyl)-l-hydTOxy-[4-{dimemylamino)butyl] phenyl] oxazoline or -thiazolme of formula DC thus obtained may be isolated according to the conventional techniques.<br>
In step (d), ring closure of compound DC is carried out through elimination of a molecule of water. This elimination may be effected by an acid or via a labile ester with a base. Acidic ring closure is performed with an inorganic acid, such as a sulfuric or phosphoric acid, or an organic add, such as methylsulfonic, p-toluenesulfonic or trifluoroacetic acid. The basic ring closure is performed via a labile ester, such as the methane sulfonyl, p-toluene sulfonyl, 10-campiKHsniSmyl, trifluoroaceryl or trifluoromethanesulfonyl ester in presence of a base, such as triethyl amine, dimethylaniline, pyridine, etc. The reaction is performed in an inert solvent, preferably with cooling, in particular about 0 °C and is preferably carried out by a one-pot procedure, i.e. with esterification in presence of a base.<br>
Step (e), the treatment of the compound of IV with the dehydrating reagent is carried out as described above. The reaction of the compound of formula IV, as the free base or as a salt thereof, with the Vilsmeier reagent is carried out in anhydrous organic solvent. The anhydrous organic solvent may be an apolar solvent such as a hydrocarbon, e.g toluene or xylene, or a polar solvent, or it may be the N,N-dimethylfonnamide or N,N-dimethylacetamide which form the Vilsmeier reagent, wherein the tertiary amide is present in at least the stoechiometrical amount in respect of the acid chloride, preferably in an excess thereof, te in a double amount of the stoechiometrical amount Addition of the clorinating 2sz2 is gsasralry made at low temperatures, but the reaction itself occurs at a temperature of<br>
from80-150°C,preferably90-130C,ormorepreferred 100-120 °C. These temperature ranges allow the reaction to be completed within 4 hours, particularly within 30-60 minutes.<br><br>
Ring closure in step d) and subsequent dehydration in order to convert oxazoline or thiazoline to CN in step e) may in a preferred embodiment be performed in one step without isolation of the intermediate of formula IV, e.g. by using thionylchloride as dehydration agent.<br>
As set forth above, the citalopram thus obtained may be isolated in form of free base or of a salt thereof and converted to the selected final product, preferably citalopram hydrobromide.<br>
The process of the present invention allows the preparation of citalopram and of its salts starting from compounds carrying an oxazoline or thiazoline groups which represent valuable and direct precursors of the cyano group which are stable under the conditions of a Grignard reaction. Thermal decomposition of the oxazoline or thiazoline groups in the compound of formula IV may be very simple and convenient.<br>
Moreover, the process of the present invention allows the preparation of two the enanriomers of citalopram and of their salts starting from the corresponding enanriomers of the compound of formula IV or, when using the total synthesis starting from 5-carboxy phthalide, by resolution of the compound of formula IX. Compounds of formula IV or DC, in which R1 and R4 represent methyl and R1 and R3 are hydrogen, are particularly indicated.<br>
The intermediates of formula IV and IX in the form of enantiomers, may be obtained using coOTcaioeal separation techniques or as describe in US-A-4.943.590.<br>
It is advantageous to treat the compounds of formula IX as racemate, with an optically active acid, for example with (-)- or (+)-tartaric acid or (-)- or (+)-camphor-10-suIfonic acid, in order to separate the diastereoisomeric salt mixture and to isolate the optically active compound of formula DC, as free base or as a salt thereof.<br>
The total synthesis of citalopram and of its salts directly from 5-carboxyphthalide, represents a preferred embodiment, and involves a series of intermediates which are a further object of the present invention.<br>
Thus, according to another of its objects, the invention relates to the compounds of formula IV obtainable according to step (d) and the compounds of formula VIII and DC obtained according to step (b) and (c).<br>
The salts of the compounds IV, VIII and DC may be any acid addition salt, including pharmaceutical^ acceptable acid addition salts, for example the hydrochloride, irjorobtonnde, hydrogen.<br><br>
Other reaction conditions, solvents, etc are conventional conditions for such reactions and may easily be determined by a person skilled in the art.<br>
The compound of general formula I may be used as the free base or as a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt thereof. As acid addition salts, such salts formed with organic or inorganic acids may be used. Exemplary of such organic salts are those with maleic, fumaric, benzoic, ascorbic, succinic, oxalic, bismethylenesalicylic, methanesulfonic, ethanedisulfonic, acetic, propionic, tartaric, salicylic, citric, gluconic, lactic, malic, mandeUc, cinnamic, citraconic, aspartic, stearic, palmitic, itaconic, glycolic, p-aminobenzoic, glutamic, benzene sulfonic and theophylline acetic acids, as well as the 8-halotheophyllines, for example 8-bromotheophylline. Exemplary of such inorganic salts are those with hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, sulfamic, phosphoric and nitric acids.<br>
The acid addition salts of the compounds may be prepared by methods known in the art. The base is reacted with either the calculated amount of acid in a water miscible solvent, such as ■acetone or ethanol, with subsequent isolation of the salt by concentration and cooling, or with an excess of the acid in a water immiscible solvent, such as ethylether, ethylacetate or dicblarnrngthane, with the salt separating spontaneously.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may be administered in any suitable way and in any suitable form, for example orally in the form of tablets, capsules, powders or syrups, or parenterally in the form of usual sterile solutions for injection.<br>
The pharmaceutical formulations of me invention may be prepared by conventional methods in the art. For example, tablets may be prepared by mixing the active ingredient with ordinary adjuvants and/or diluents and subsequently compressing the mixture in a conventional tabletting maschine. Examples of adjuvants or diluents comprise: Com starch, potato starch, talcum, magnesium stearate, gelatine, lactose, gums, and the like. Any other adjuvant or additive colourings, aroma, preservatives etc. may be used provided that they are compatible with the active ingredients.<br>
SOJOOOBS for injections may be prepared by solving the active ingredient and possible ariumirs in a part of the solvent for injection, preferably sterile water, adjusting the solution to ihe desired volume, sterilisation of the solution and filling in suitable ampoules or vials. Any suitable additive conventionally used in the art may be added, such as tonicity agents, preservatives, antioxidants, etc.<br><br>
The inventioii is further illustrated by the following examples:<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of citalopram hydrobromide<br>
To a mixture of 4,4-dimethyl-2-[H3-(dimethyl amino)propyl]-l-(4-fluorophenyI&gt;l,3-duiydroisobenzofuran-5-yI]oxazoline (19 g, 0.0479 mol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (50 ml), cooled to -20 °C, there are added 8.93 ml of POC1, (0.0958 m), without allowing the temperature to rise above -10 °C. At the end of the addition, the temperature is allowed to rise to 10-15 °C, then the mixture is heated at 110-115 °C for 45-60 minutes and thereafter immediately cooled to 20-25 °C. The mixture is treated with 80 ml of deionized water and pH is adjusted to 9 by addition of a concentrated solution of ammonium hydroxide. The product is deeply extracted with toluene, by carrying out the operation four times with 80,60, 50 and, respectively, of toluene (40 ml), then the organic phases- are collected and decolourised by treatment with charcoal for 30 minutes. The charcoal is filtered off and the solvent is evaporated leaving 13.5 g of an oil. The oily residue is taken up with 80 ml of acetone and the obtained solution is treated with of a 48% HBr (4 ml) solution. The mixture thus obtained is concentrated in vacuo, and die oily residue is taken up with of acetone (40 ml) and the solution is allowed to stand overnight at 4-5°C. The solid is filtered off, washed at the first with toluene, then with acetone and dried. Thus, 9.4 g of citalopram hydrobromide is obtained.<br>
The mother liquors are concentrated to dryness, the residue is taken up with 20 ml of acetone, the solution is kept 4 hours at 4-5°C, then it is filtered, washed with a little amount of acetone and dried. Thus, there is obtained a further 1.44 g of citalopram hydrobromide.<br>
