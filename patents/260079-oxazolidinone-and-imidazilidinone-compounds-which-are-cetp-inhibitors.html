				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION CETP INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF TEE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a class of chemical compounds that inhibit cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and therefore may have utility in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Atherosclerosis and its clinical consequences, coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke and peripheral<br>
vascular disease, represent a truly enormous burden to the health care systems of the industrialized<br>
world. In the United States alone, approximately 13 million patients have been diagnosed with CHD, and<br>
greater than one half million deaths are attributed to CHD each year. Further, this toll is expected to grow<br>
over the next quarter century as an epidemic in obesity and diabetes continues to grow.<br>
;	It has long been recognized that in mammals, variations in circulating lipoprotein<br>
profiles correlate with the risk of atherosclerosis and CHD. The clinical success of HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitors, especially the statins, in reducing coronary events is based on the reduction of circulating Low Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), levels of which correlate directly with increased risk for atherosclerosis. More recently, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between High Density Lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and atherosclerosis, leading to the conclusion that low serum HDL-C levels are associated with an increased risk for CHD.<br>
Metabolic control of lipoprotein levels is a complex and dynamic process involving many factors. One important metabolic control in man is the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a plasma glycoprotein that catalyzes the movement of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the apoB containing lipoproteins, especially VLDL (see Hesler, C.B., et. al. (1987) Purification and characterization of human plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein. J. Biol. Chem. 262(5), 2275-2282)). Under physiological conditions, the net reaction is a heteroexchange in which CETP carries triglyceride to HDL from the apoB lipoproteins and transports cholesterol ester from HDL to the apoBliprotein.<br>
In humans, CETP plays a role in reverse cholesterol transport, the process whereby cholesterol is returned to the liver from peripheral tissues. Intriguingly, many animals do not possess CETP, including animals that have high HDL levels and are known to be resistant to coronary heart disease, such as rodents (see Guyard-Dangremont, V., et. al., (1998) Phospholipid and cholesteryl ester transfer activities in plasma from 14 vertebrate species. Relation to atherogenesis susceptibility, Comp. Biochem. Physiol. B Biochem. Mol. Biol. 120(3), 517-525). Numerous epidemiologic studies correlating the effects of natural variation in CETP activity with respect to coronary heart disease risk have been performed, including studies on a small number of known human null mutations (see Hirano, K.-L, Yamashita, S. and Matsuzawa, Y. (2000) Pros and cons of inhibiting cholesteryl ester transfer protein, Curr. Opm. Lipidol. 11(6), 589-596). These studies have clearly demonstrated an inverse correlation<br><br>
between plasma HDL-C concentration and CETP activity (see Inazu, A., et. al. (2000) Cholesteiyl ester transfer protein and atherosclerosis, Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 11(4), 389-396), leading to the hypothesis that pharmacologic inhibition of CETP lipid transfer activity may be beneficial to humans by increasing levels of HDL-C while lowering those of LDL.<br>
Despite the significant therapeutic advance that statins such as simvastatin (ZOCOR@)<br>
represent, statins only achieve a risk reduction of approximately one-third in the treatment and prevention<br>
of atherosclerosis and ensuing atherosclerotic disease events. Currently, few pharmacologic therapies are<br>
available that favorably raise circulating levels of HDL-C. Certain statins and some fibrates offer modest<br>
HDL-C gains. Niacin, which provides the most effective therapy for raising HDL-C that has been<br>
clinically documented, suffers from patient compliance issues, due in part to side effects such as<br>
flushing. An agent that safely and effectively raises HDL cholesterol levels can answer a significant, but<br>
as yet unmet medical need by offering a means of pharmacologic therapy that can significantly improve<br>
circulating lipid profiles through a mechanism that is complementary to existing therapies.<br>
i	New classes of chemical compounds that inhibit CETP are being investigated at several<br>
Ipharmaceutical companies or are in clinical trials. No CETP inhibitors are currently being marketed. New compounds are needed so that one or more pharmaceutical compounds can be found that are safe and effective. The novel compounds described herein are very potent CETP inhibitors. Some structurally similar compounds are found in WO2003/032981.<br>

Therapeutically active metabolites, where the metabolites themselves fall within the scope of the claimed invention, are also compounds of the current invention. Prodrugs, which are compounds that are convened to the claimed compounds as they are being administered to a patient or after they have been administered to a patient, are also compounds of this invention.<br>
JJtiHties<br>
Compounds of the current invention are potent inhibitors of CETP. They are therefore useful in treating diseases and conditions that are treated by inhibitors of CETP.<br>
One aspect of the present invention provides a method for treating or reducing the risk of developing a disease or condition that may be treated or prevented by inhibition of CETP by administering a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this invention to a patient in need of treatment. A patient is a human or mammal, and is most often a human. A "therapeutically effective amount" is the amount of compound that is effective in obtaining a desired clinical outcome in the treatment of a specific disease.<br>
Diseases or conditions that may be treated with compounds of this invention, or which the patient may have a reduced risk of developing as a result of being treated with the compounds of this invention, include: atherosclerosis, peripheral vascular disease, dyslipidemia, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, hypoalphalipoproteinernia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, familial-hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disorders, angina, ischemia, cardiac ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, reperfusion injury, angioplastic restenosis, hypertension, vascular complications of diabetes, obesity, endotoxemia, and metabolic syndrome.<br>
The compounds of this invention are expected to be particularly effective in raising HDL-C and/or increasing the ratio of HDL-C to LDL-C. These changes in HDL-C and LDL-C may be beneficial in treating atherosclerosis, reducing or reversing the development of atherosclerosis, reducing the risk of developing atherosclerosis, or preventing atherosclerosis.<br>
Administration and Dose Ranges<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dose of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like. Preferably compounds of Formula I are administered orally.<br>
The effective dosage of active ingredient employed may vary depending on the particular compound employed, the mode of administration, the condition being treated and the severity of the condition being treated. Such dosage may be ascertained readily by a person skilled in the art.<br>
When treating the diseases for which compounds of Formula I are indicated, generally satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds of the present invention are administered at a daily dosage of from about 0.01 milligram to about 100 milligram per kilogram of animal or human body weight, preferably given as a single daily dose or in divided doses two to six times a day, or in sustained release form. In the case of a 70 kg adult human, the total daily dose will generally be from about 0.5 milligram to about 500 milligrams. For a particularly potent compound, the dosage for an adult human may be as low as 0.1 nig. The dosage regimen may be adjusted within this range or even outside of this range to provide the optimal therapeutic response.<br>
Oral administration will usually be carried out using tablets. Examples of doses in tablets are 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 rng, 5 mg, 10 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg. Other oral forms can also have the same dosages (e.g. capsules).<br>
Fh a r maceu ti ca 1 Coinposi t i ons<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprise a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt as an active ingredient, as well as a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids. A pharmaceutical composition may also comprise a prodrug, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof^ if a prodrug is administered.   Pharmaceutical compositions may also consist essentially of a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier without other thereapeutic ingredients.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (nasal or buccal inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or earners such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents<br>
and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, hard and soft capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations.<br>
Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most<br>
advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. It desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques. Such compositions and preparations should contain at least 0.1 percent of active compound. The percentage of active compound in these compositions may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 2 percent to about 60 percent of the weight of the unit. The amount of active compound in such therapeutically useful compositions is such that an effective dosage will be obtained. The active compounds can also be administered intranasally as, for example, liquid drops or spray.<br>
The tablets, pills, capsules, and the like may also contain a binder such as gum<br>
tragacanth, acacia, corn starch or gelatin; excipients such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent such as com starch, potato starch, alginic acid; a lubricant such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin. When a dosage unit form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier such as a fatty oil.<br>
Various other materials may be present as coatings or to modify the physical form of the dosage unit. For instance, tablets may be coated with shellac, sugar or both. A syrup or elixir may contain, in addition to the active ingredient, sucrose as a sweetening agent, methyl and propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and a flavoring such as cherry or orange flavor.<br>
Compounds of formula I may also be administered parenterally. Solutions or<br>
suspensions of these active compounds can be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions can also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols and mixtures thereof in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases, the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g. glycerol, propylene glycol and liquid polyethylene glycol), suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>

The combination therapies described above which use the compounds of this invention may also be useful in the treatment of the metabolic syndrome. According to one widely used definition, a patient having metabolic syndrome is characterized as having three or more symptoms selected from the following group of five symptoms: (1) abdominal obesity; (2) hypertriglyceridemia; (3) low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL); (4) high blood pressure; and (5) elevated fasting glucose, which may be in the range characteristic of Type 2 diabetes if the patient is also diabetic. Each of these symptoms is defined clinically in the recently released Third Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in<br><br>
Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III, or ATP HI), National Institutes of Health, 2001, NIH Publication No. 01-3670. Patients with metabolic syndrome have an increased risk of developing the macrovascular and miciovascular complications that are listed above, including atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. The combinations described above may ameliorate more than one symptom of metabolic syndrome concurrently (e.g. two symptoms, three symptoms, four symptoms, or all five of the symptoms).<br>
CETP ASSAY<br>
An in vitro continuous assay for determining IC50's to identify compounds that are CETP inhibitors was performed based on a modification of the method described by Epps et al. employing B()DIPY®-CE as the cholesteryl ester lipid donor. See Epps et al.(1995) Method for measuring the activities of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (lipid transfer protein), Chem. Phys. Lipids. 77, 51-63.<br>
Particles used in the assay were created from the following sources: Synthetic donor HDL particles containing DOPC (Dioleoyl Phosphatidyl Choline), BODIPY@-CE (Molecular Probes C-3927), triolein (a triglyceride), and apoHDL were essentially created by probe sonication as described by Epps et al, but with the addition of a non-diffusable quencher molecule, dabcyl dicetylamide, in order to reduce background fluorescence. Dabcyl dicetylamide was made by heating dabcyl n-succinimide with dicetylamine in DMF at 95°C overnight in the presence of diisopropylamine catalyst. Native lipoproteins from human blood were used as acceptor particles. Particles having a density less than 1.063 g/ml were collected by ultracentrifugation. These particles include VLDL, IDL, and LDL. Particle concentrations were expressed in terms of protein concentration as determined by BCA assay (Pierce, USA). Particles were stored at 4°C until use.<br>
Assays were performed in Dynex Microfluor 2 U-bottom black 96-well plates (Cat #7205). An assay cocktail containing CETP, IX CETP buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA), and half the final concentration of acceptor particles was prepared, and 100 f.iL of the assay cocktail was added to each well of the plate. Test compounds in DMSO were added in a volume of 3 fJ.L. The plate was mixed on a plate shaker and then incubated at 25 °C for 1 hour. A second assay cocktail containing donor particles, the remaining acceptor particles and IX CETP buffer was prepared.   47 /xL of the second assay cocktail was added to the reaction wells to start the assay. Assays were performed at 25°C in a final volume of 150 juL. Final concentrations of materials were: 5 ng//iL donor particles, 30 ng/jjL acceptor particles (each expressed by protein content), IX CETP buffer, 0.8 nM recombinant human CETP (expressed in CHO cells and partially purified), and up to 2% DMSO when testing compounds. The assay was followed in a fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectramax GeminiXS) set for a 45 minute kinetic run at 25°C which read the samples every 45 sec at Ex = 480 nm, Em = 511 nm, with a cutoff filter at 495 nm, photomultiplier tube setting of medium, calibration on, and 6 reads/well.<br><br>
Data was evaluated by obtaining an initial rate, expressed in relative fluorescence units per second, for the pseudolinear portion of the curve, often 0-500 or 1000 sec. Comparison of the rates of samples with inhibitors to an uninhibited (DMSO only) positive control yielded a percent inhibition. A plot of percent inhibition vs. log of inhibitor concentration, fit to a Sigmoidal 4 parameter equation was used to calculate<br>

The aqueous and organic layers are separated. The organic layer is washed with 26 L of 20%w/v aq NaCl, then with 36 L water, then with 31 L 0.5 N HC1, and finally with 32 L of water. The organic layer is concentrated to -10 L. Heptane (20 L) is added, yielding crystals. The organic layer is concentrated to -10 L. Heptane (20L) is added again, and the organic layer is concentrated to -10 L. Heptane (22 L) is added and the slurry is aged at rt. The solid is filtered and washed with 24 L heptane.<br>
A solid product is obtained (98.8% purity, &gt;99.95%ee, by LC). The solid is then re-dissolved in 12.5 L MeOH (endothermic).   At rt, 3 L water is added, and the mixture is aged to initiate crystallization. Water (9.5 L) is added over ~60min at rt. After aging for 60min, the slurry is filtered and the solid is washed with 5 L MeOH/water (1/1.5), 5 L MeOH/water (1/4) and then 4 L water. The solid product is dried at 50° C under vacuum (99.9% pure by LC, &gt;99.95%ee).<br>
The reaction in Step 3 can also be carried out using Al(O-i-Pr)3 as the reducing agent. For example, the ketone (6 kg) is heated at 50°C with 0.3 eq of Al(O-i-Pr)3 (790g) in 12L IPA and 18 L of toluene for 15.5 hours. The solution is cooled to ambient temperature, and solid KOH pellets (1.35 kg) are added slowly with vigorous stirring, while keeping the temperature at  99.5% cyclization, 33L of IN HCI solution is added to quench the reaction, which is kept at

Step 1: Suzuki Coupling Reaction of Boronic Acid 1 and aryl chloride 2:<br>
A 3 M K2C03 solution is prepared by adding 4.71 kg of solid K2CO3 to 10.3 L water. Cooling is applied to keep the solution at 20-25 °C. THF (12 L), aryl chloride 2 (2.69 kg), and the boronic acid 1 t]iat was made in Example 78 (2.74kg) are added to the K2CO3 followed by a 1 L THF rinse. HPLC analysis is used to confirm the 1.00/1.00 ratio of 1/2. The solution is degassed by sparging with nitrogen g^s for 70 min. The catalyst, 1,1 bis(di-tert-butylphosphino)ferrocene palladium dichloride (42g) is added jas a solid and is followed by a degassed THF rinse (1.5 L). The organic layer turns dark brown immediately. The biphasic mixture is aged at 36°-40°C with vigorous stirring. After HPLC reveals complete conversion (15-18 h), the mixture is cooled to it and the aqueous layer is removed. To the organic layer is added heptane (25.6L) and water (25.6 L) and the layers are cut. The organic layer is washed with water (19L). The organic layer is treated with 680 g Darco KB-B at rt for 60 min and filtered through solka-flpc with a 10%THF/Heptane rinse (-15 L). The solvent is switched to heptane (-35 L) at -45-50 °C until kc0.5v% of THF is left. More heptane is added to bring the total volume to -45-50 L. The solution is seeded with crystals obtained from earlier runs if no seed bed forms. The slurry is slowly cooled to rt arid then to-15 °C. After aging at -15 °C for 1-2 h, after LC of the supernatant shows ~2g/l loss of the pj-oduct in the supernatant, the slurry is filtered and the product is washed with cold heptane (-25 L), providing compound 3.<br>

The mixture was wanned to + 12°C and was aged until complete conversion took place. Then 5N Hf'l (3.4L&gt; was added, followed by 16L of 10%IPAC/Heptane and 34L of water, keeping the! temperature between IO°C and 20CC throughout. The layers were cut and the organic layer was washed twice with 14L of 1:1 DMF:water followed by two 14L water washes. The organic layer was assayed for yield and was then filtered through 2.4 kg of silica gel to remove the excess oxazolidinone to. The warm heptane solution was then transferred slowly into a 20°C heptane solution containing 10 wt';,'j seed. The slurry was then cooled to -20°C and filtered. The filter cake was washed with cold heptane and was then dried, yielding the compound that was originally made in Example 73.<br>
