MULTI-SPEED COUNTERSHAFT TRANSMISSION WITH<br>
A PLANETARY GEAR SET<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]		The invention relates to a multi-speed transmission having first and<br>
second countershafts and a planetary gear set.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]		Automotive vehicles include a powertrain that is comprised of an<br>
engine, multi-speed transmission, and a differential or final drive. The multi-speed<br>
transmission increases the overall operating range of the vehicle by permitting the<br>
engine to operate through its torque range a number of times. The number of<br>
forward speed ratios that are available in the transmission determines the number of<br>
times the engine torque range is repeated. Early automatic transmissions had two<br>
speed ranges. This severely limited the overall speed range of the vehicle and<br>
therefore required a relatively large engine that could produce a wide speed and<br>
torque range. This resulted in the engine operating at a specific fuel consumption<br>
point during cruising, other than the most efficient point. Therefore, manually-<br>
shifted (countershaft transmissions) were the most popular.<br>
[0003]		With the advent of three- and four-speed automatic transmissions, the<br>
automatic shifting (planetary gear) transmission increased in popularity with the<br>
motoring public. These transmissions improved the operating performance and fuel<br>
economy of the vehicle. The increased number of speed ratios reduces the step size<br>
between ratios and therefore improves the shift quality of the transmission by<br>
making the ratio interchanges substantially imperceptible to the operator under<br>
normal vehicle acceleration.<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
2<br>
[0004]		A variety of different types of transmissions are used to deliver<br>
multiple speed ratios including manual, automated manual, dual clutch and planetary<br>
transmissions. For example, a typical multi-speed, dual clutch transmission uses a<br>
combination of two friction clutches and several dog clutch/synchronizers to achieve<br>
"power-on" or dynamic shifts by alternating between one friction clutch and the<br>
other, with the synchronizers being "pre-selected" for the oncoming ratio prior to<br>
actually making the dynamic shift. This concept typically uses countershaft gears<br>
with a different, dedicated gear pair to achieve each forward speed ratio (with the<br>
exception of being able to achieve a direct drive ratio in a rear wheel drive<br>
application). The transmission utilized for a specific application may depend on<br>
many factors, such as a minimization of required components, packaging<br>
limitations, ratio coverage and torque requirements for launch.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]		A combination countershaft and planetary gear set transmission is<br>
provided that achieves nine forward speed ratios and preferably at least one reverse<br>
speed ratio. The transmission includes a main shaft operatively connected to an<br>
input member as well as first and second countershafts that are each spaced from<br>
and substantially parallel with the main shaft. The transmission includes a plurality<br>
of gears forming different co-planar, intermeshing gear sets, each of the gears being<br>
concentric about the main shaft, the first countershaft or the second countershaft.<br>
The gears that are concentric with the first countershaft are aligned in not more than<br>
five (and in most embodiments not more than four), co-planar, intermeshing gear<br>
sets and the gears that are concentric with the second countershaft are aligned in not<br>
more than four co-planar, intermeshing gear sets. Preferably, the transmission<br>
includes not more that five total co-planar, intermeshing gear sets. The transmission<br>
needs only eight torque-transmitting mechanisms to achieve the nine forward and at<br>
least one reverse speed ratios.<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
3<br>
[0006]		In one aspect of the invention, the transmission is characterized by an<br>
absence of dual input or dual output torque-transmitting mechanisms, instead<br>
utilizing first and second head gear sets that provide a ratio to transfer torque to the<br>
first and second countershafts, respectively. The first head gear set at least partially<br>
forms a first co-planar, intermeshing gear set and the second head gear set at least<br>
partially forms a second co-planar, intermeshing gear set. As used herein, a "head<br>
gear set" is a set of intermeshing gears that transfers torque from the input member<br>
to a countershaft in the transmission. By utilizing the first and second head gear<br>
sets as well as the planetary gear set, the number of gears required on the<br>
countershafts is decreased, thus minimizing the overall length of the countershafts.<br>
[0007]		A reverse speed ratio may be provided in a number of ways. For<br>
example, one of the eight torque-transmitting mechanisms may be a reverse torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism that is a two-way dog clutch concentric with and supported<br>
by the first countershaft. The two-way dog clutch is shiftable in one direction to<br>
establish a reverse speed ratio and shiftable in an opposite direction to establish a<br>
forward speed ratio. Preferably, the two-way dog clutch is packaged between the<br>
first head gear set and a third co-planar, intermeshing gear set, and is generally<br>
aligned with the second co-planar, intermeshing gear set. As the axial space on the<br>
first countershaft which the dog-clutch is packaged would otherwise be unused, no<br>
additional length is required for packaging the two-way dog clutch.<br>
[0008]		Alternatively, a reverse shaft may be provided to transfer torque from<br>
either the first or the second co-planar, intermeshing gear set to the third co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set. The reverse shaft may include a rotating clutch to establish<br>
the torque transfer. In another alternative embodiment, the rotating clutch may be<br>
supported by the first countershaft to transfer torque via the reverse shaft.<br>
[0009]		In still another alternative embodiment, the reverse torque-<br>
transmitting mechanism may be a rotating clutch supported by the first countershaft<br>
that is selectively engagable to transfer torque directly from a first gear concentric<br>
with and supported about the first countershaft to a second gear concentric with and<br>
supported for rotation about the second countershaft, wherein the first and second<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
4<br>
gears continuously intermesh with one another. The first and second countershafts<br>
are not located in the same plane as the main shaft, enabling the first and second<br>
gears to intermesh without interference from the main shaft. These intermeshing<br>
countershaft-to-countershaft first and second gears may also be employed with the<br>
two-way dog clutch arrangement described above.<br>
[0010]		Preferably, only two rotating clutches are needed on each of the first<br>
and second countershafts in order to establish the forward speed ratios. In some<br>
embodiments, an additional rotating clutch is needed on one of the countershafts to<br>
establish the reverse speed ratio or ratios.<br>
[0011]		In another aspect of the invention, one of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is a direct drive torque-transmitting mechanism that is selectively<br>
engageable to transfer torque directly from the input member to the planetary gear<br>
set, thereby bypassing the countershafts.<br>
[0012]		In yet another aspect of the invention, one of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is a lock-up clutch selectively engageable to connect any two members<br>
of the planetary gear set for common rotation, thereby causing the entire planetary<br>
gear set to rotate at the same speed (i.e., locking-up the planetary gear set).<br>
[0013]		In yet another aspect of the invention, one of the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanisms is a brake selectively engagable to ground a ring gear member of the<br>
planetary gear set to the stationary member such as a transmission housing. The<br>
brake may also be referred to as a grounded clutch or stationary clutch.<br>
[0014]		In addition to its compact design, the transmission has many<br>
additional benefits. The transmission has adequate ratio coverage to meet both<br>
takeoff and low engine speed highway cruising requirements of a linehaul vehicle,<br>
although its use is not limited to linehaul vehicles. The highest three gear ratios are<br>
very close, allowing more precise modulation of engine speed at higher vehicle<br>
speeds when fuel economy is most critical. The combination of a countershaft and a<br>
planetary gear set configuration allows a potential increase in fuel efficiency over a<br>
traditional planetary transmission. The wide ratio coverage and relatively small<br>
ratio steps will enable lock-up of an associated torque converter in first gear as well<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
5<br>
as shifting during torque-converter lock-up. The ability to operate with the torque<br>
converter locked significantly reduces transmission cooling demands.<br>
[0015]		The above features and advantages and other features and advantages<br>
of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description<br>
of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0027]		Referring to the drawings wherein like reference numbers refer to like<br>
components, Figure 1 illustrates a powertrain 10 that includes an engine 12<br>
operatively connected to a transmission 14 through a torque converter 16. The torque<br>
converter 16 includes a pump portion 18 connected for rotation with an engine shaft<br>
20, a stator portion 22 grounded to a stationary member such as the transmission<br>
housing or casing 24, and a turbine portion 26. As is understood by those skilled in<br>
the art, the torque converter 16 is a fluid coupling providing torque multiplication<br>
between the pump portion 18 and the turbine portion 26. The turbine portion 26 is<br>
connected for rotation with an input member 28 of the transmission 14. The torque<br>
converter 16 includes a lock-up clutch 30. When the lock-up clutch 30 is engaged,<br>
power flow from the engine shaft 20 is directly connected with the input member 28,<br>
bypassing the fluid coupling and torque multiplication of the pump portion 18 and<br>
turbine portion 26.<br>
[0028]		The transmission 14 is operable to provide nine forward speed ratios<br>
and four reverse speed ratios between the input member 28 and an output member 32.<br>
Each speed ratio corresponds with a respective "gear" in the first column of Figure 2<br>
and a corresponding torque ratio shown in the second column of Figure 2, as is<br>
understood by those skilled in the art.<br>
[0029]		The transmission 14 includes a main shaft 34, a first countershaft 36,<br>
and a second countershaft 38. The input member 28 is connected for common rotation<br>
with main shaft 34. The first and second countershafts 36, 38 are arranged generally<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
8<br>
parallel with the main shaft 34. The transmission 14 includes a plurality of<br>
intermeshing gears as will be described herein. The main shaft 34 has a gear 40<br>
connected for common rotation therewith that continuously intermeshes with gear 42.<br>
Gear 42 is concentric with and rotatable about the first countershaft 36. Gears 40 and<br>
42 may be referred to as a first head gear set and form a first co-planar, intermeshing<br>
gear set. The co-planar nature of gears 40, 42 is indicated by plane P1A.<br>
Preferably, the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets described herein include: (i) at least a<br>
gear concentric with the main shaft 34 and either a gear concentric with one of the<br>
countershafts 36, 38 or (ii) a gear concentric with a reverse shaft, such as reverse shaft<br>
164 described with respect to Figure 3B below.<br>
[0030]		The main shaft 34 has a gear 44 connected for common rotation<br>
therewith. Gear 44 continuously intermeshes with gear 46 which is connected for<br>
common rotation with the second countershaft 38. Gears 44 and 46 are referred to<br>
herein as a second head gear set and form a second co-planar, intermeshing gear set,<br>
the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P2A.<br>
[0031]		Gear 48 is concentric with and rotatable about the first countershaft 36.<br>
Gear 48 continuously intermeshes with gear 50 which is connected for common<br>
rotation with the second countershaft 38. It should be understood that the main shaft<br>
34 and the countershafts 36, 38 are in different planes, in a triangular formation so<br>
that gear 48 can continuously intermesh with gear 50 without interfering with main<br>
shaft 34. This is indicated in Figure 1 by showing a portion of gear 48 in phantom to<br>
indicate that it is behind main shaft 34. Gears 48 and 50 form a third co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P3A.<br>
[0032]		A two-way dog clutch D is supported on the first countershaft 36. The<br>
dog clutch D is shiftable in two directions along first countershaft 36. The dog clutch<br>
D is shiftable to the left to connect gear 42 for common rotation with first<br>
countershaft 36. The dog clutch D is shiftable to the right to connect gear 48 for<br>
common rotation with first countershaft 36. When dog clutch D is shifted to the left,<br>
it partially establishes a forward speed ratio, as indicated in the column labeled DF in<br>
Figure 2. When a dog clutch D is shifted to the right it partially establishes a first<br>
speed ratio as indicated in the column DR in Figure 2. In a first forward speed ratio<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
9<br>
(Gear 1 indicated in the first column of Figure 2), the dog clutch D may be shifted<br>
either to the left or to the right. When dog clutch D is shifted to the left, torque is<br>
transferred from the input member 28 along the first head gear set, gears 40 and 42 in<br>
P1A, to the first countershaft 36. Alternatively, when the dog clutch D is shifted to<br>
the right, torque is transferred from the input member 28 through the second head<br>
gear set, gears 44 and 46 in P2A, to the second countershaft 38 and then through<br>
intermeshing gears 50 and 48 to the first<br>
countershaft 36.<br>
[0033]		The dog clutch D is preferably actuated by an independent actuator<br>
(not shown), such as in a hydraulic control system to move the two-way dog clutch D<br>
either to the right or to the left as discussed. The two-way dog clutch D is not<br>
actuated through the first countershaft 36, i.e., is not moved by moving the first<br>
countershaft 36.<br>
[0034]		Additional components of the transmission 14 include gears 52 and 54<br>
which are concentric with and rotatable about the second countershaft 38. Gear 52 is<br>
supported on and rotates with sleeve shaft 53. Gear 54 is supported on and rotates<br>
with sleeve shaft 55. Gear 52 intermeshes with gear 56 which is concentric with and<br>
rotatable about the main shaft 34. Gear 54 intermeshes with gear 58 which is<br>
concentric with and rotatable about the main shaft 34. Gear 56 also intermeshes with<br>
gear 60 which is concentric with and rotatable about the first countershaft 36. Gear 60<br>
is supported on and rotates with sleeve shaft 61. Gear 62 is supported on and<br>
rotatable with sleeve shaft 63. Gear 58 intermeshes with gear 62 which is rotatable<br>
about the first countershaft 36. Gears 52, 56 and 60 form a fourth co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P4A. Gears<br>
54, 58 and 62 form a fifth co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of<br>
which is indicated by plane P5A.<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
10<br>
[0035]		Transmission 14 further includes a planetary gear set 70. The<br>
planetary gear set 70 includes a sun gear member 72, a ring gear member 74 and a<br>
carrier member 76 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 77. The sun gear<br>
member 72 is continuously connected for common rotation with the gears 56 and 58<br>
via sleeve shaft 80 and hub member 82. The carrier member 76 is continuously<br>
connected for common rotation with the output member 32.<br>
[0036]		The transmission 14 includes eight torque-transmitting mechanisms.<br>
The two-way dog clutch D is one of these eight torque-transmitting mechanisms. The<br>
other seven torque-transmitting mechanisms are referred to herein as Cl, C2, C3, C4,<br>
C5, C6 and C7. Cl is a rotating clutch supported on the second countershaft 38 and is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 54 for common rotation with second<br>
countershaft 38. C2 is a rotating clutch supported on first countershaft 36 and is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 62 for common rotation with first countershaft<br>
36. C3 is a rotating clutch supported on second countershaft 38 and is selectively<br>
engageable to connect gear 52 for common rotation with second countershaft 38. C4<br>
is referred to herein as a bypass torque-transmitting mechanism or clutch that is<br>
selectively engagable to connect the main shaft 34 directly with the sun gear member<br>
72, bypassing the first and second countershafts 36, 38. C5 is a rotating clutch<br>
supported on first countershaft 36 and is selectively engagable to connect gear 60 with<br>
the first countershaft 36 for common rotation. C6 is a brake that is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the ring gear member 74 with the transmission housing 24. C7<br>
is referred to herein as a lock-up torque-transmitting mechanism or a rotating clutch<br>
that is selectively engageable to lock-up the planetary gear set 70 by connecting gears<br>
56 and 58 for common rotation with both sun gear member 72 and ring gear member<br>
74 via sleeve shaft 80 and hub member 82, thereby causing the entire planetary gear<br>
set 70 to rotate at the same speed as gears 56 and 58.<br>
[0037]		Referring to Figure 2, the engagement schedule of the torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms is indicated to achieve four reverse speed ratios and nine<br>
forward speed ratios. The transmission 14 could achieve 10 forward speed ratios if,<br>
after Gear 3, clutch C4 was engaged while clutch C3 is released and clutch C6 and<br>
two-way dog clutch D remained engaged in the forward position. This would provide<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
11<br>
a torque ratio with a numerical value between that indicated for Gear 3 and Gear 4 in<br>
Figure 2. In the engagement schedule of Figure 2 however, this alternate speed is<br>
skipped and C4 is not engaged during any of Gears 1 through 4. C7 is applied during<br>
Gears 5 through 9 to lock-up the planetary gear set 70 by connecting the gears 56 and<br>
58 via sleeve shaft 80 and hub member 82 directly to both the ring gear member 74<br>
and the sun gear member 72. As those skilled in the art will understand, when any<br>
two members of a planetary gear set are connected for common rotation, the entire<br>
planetary gear set rotates at the same speed. When C7 is applied to lock up the<br>
planetary gear set 70, the clutches Cl, C2, C3, C4 and C5 may be selectively engaged<br>
in order, providing an additional five speed ratios, indicated as Gears 5 though 9 in<br>
Figure 2. Thus, nine or ten forward speed ratios are achieved using only two rotating<br>
clutches on each of the countershafts 36 and 38. Each of the countershaft clutches are<br>
"reused" in achieving the ten forward speed ratios. This enables the countershafts 36<br>
and 38 to be shorter in overall length. The two-way dog clutch D is packaged in what<br>
would otherwise likely be an unused space between the first and third planes P1 A and<br>
P3A, thus not extending the required length of the first countershaft. 36. The ratio<br>
change provided by the first and second headsets and that available through the<br>
planetary gear set 70 enable ten forward speed ratios to be achieved using only four<br>
countershaft clutches.<br>
[0038]		As is apparent in Figure 1, the first countershaft 36 has gears in only<br>
four of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets as indicated by planes: P1 A, P3A, P4A<br>
and P5A. Likewise, the second countershaft 38 includes gears in only four of the co-<br>
planar, intermeshing gear sets as indicated by planes P2A, P3A, P4A and P5A. The<br>
transmission 14 includes only five total co-planar, intermeshing gear sets as indicated<br>
by planes P1A, P2A, P3A, P4A and P5A, plus the planetary gear set 70, thus<br>
maximizing compactness.<br>
[0039]		As indicated in Figure 2, a relatively high total ratio coverage (TRC) of<br>
8.658 is achieved by the transmission 14 between the input member 28 and the output<br>
member 32 (i.e., without including any torque ratio boosting affects of the torque<br>
converter 16). Additionally, small ratio steps are achieved, especially in the higher<br>
torque ratios, to maximize highway cruising fuel economy. A high torque ratio value<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
12<br>
is achieved in the first forward gear, Gear 1, thus providing adequate ratio coverage<br>
for take-off, especially in a commercial on-and-off highway line haul vehicle. The<br>
ratio steps are small enough to (i) enable lock-up of the torque converter 16 (by<br>
engaging lock-up clutch 30) during first gear (Gear 1) and (ii) lock-up to lock-up<br>
shifts, in higher gears, which significantly decreases transmission cooling demand.<br>
[0040]		The torque ratios and torque ratio steps indicated in Figure 2 are<br>
achieved by utilizing the following gear tooth counts: gear 40 has 54 teeth; gear 42<br>
has 44 teeth; gear 44 has 48 teeth; gear 46 has 53 teeth; gear 48 has 73 teeth; gear 50<br>
has 72 teeth; gear 52 has 48 teeth; gear 54 has 34 teeth; gear 56 has 50 teeth; gear 58<br>
has 66 teeth; gear 60 has 48 teeth; gear 62 has 34 teeth; ring gear 74 has 85 teeth; and<br>
sun gear 72 has 35 teeth. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other gear<br>
tooth counts resulting in other torque ratio, ratio step and total ratio coverage values<br>
may be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0041]		Referring to Figures 3A and 3B, another embodiment of a powertrain<br>
110 having a transmission 114 within the scope of the invention is illustrated. The<br>
transmission 114 operates according to the engagement schedule of Figure 2 to<br>
achieve the torque ratio and ratio steps between input member 128 and output<br>
member 132 as indicated in Figure 4, except that Gear REV L and Gear REV H are<br>
achieved according to the engagement schedule for Gears REV 2 and REV 4,<br>
respectively, in Figure 2, and dog clutch D100 need only be engaged in the forward<br>
direction (DF) in Gears 4 and 9. An optional tenth forward speed ratio may be<br>
achieved by engaging C4, releasing C3 and keeping C6 engaged after Gear 3.<br>
[0042]		The engine 12 is connected through torque converter 16 by engine<br>
shaft 20 to the transmission input member 128. The torque converter lock-up clutch<br>
30 may be applied to directly connect the engine output shaft 20 with the input<br>
member 128, bypassing the ratio boosting effect of the torque converter 16. The<br>
torque converter 16 includes a pump portion 18, a stator portion 22 grounded to<br>
transmission housing 124 and a turbine portion 26. The torque converter 16 includes<br>
a pump portion 18, a stator portion 22 grounded to transmission housing 124 and a<br>
turbine portion 26. The torque converter 16 operates as described with respect to<br>
Figure 1.<br><br>

[0043]		The transmission 114 includes a main shaft 134, a first countershaft<br>
136, and a second countershaft 138. The input member 128 is connected for common<br>
rotation with main shaft 134. Gear 140 is connected for common rotation with main<br>
shaft 134 and continuously intermeshes with gear 142 which is connected for<br>

as a first head gear set which is a first, co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar<br>
nature of which is indicated by plane P1B.<br>
[0044]		Gear 144 is connected for common rotation with main shaft 134 and<br>
continuously meshes with gear 146 which is connected for common rotation with<br>

co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane<br>
P3B.<br>
[0045]		Figure 3B shows another portion of transmission 114. The<br>
transmission 114 includes a reverse shaft 164 that has gears 165 and 168 connected<br>
for common rotation therewith. The reverse shaft 164 is located so that gear 165<br>
intermeshes with gear 156 and is aligned in the third plane P3B, and gear 168<br>
intermeshes with gear 167, as indicated in Figure 3B. Gear 165 is referred to as the<br>
first gear of the reverse shaft. Gear 167 is concentric with and rotates about first<br>
countershaft 136. Gears 168 and 167 form a fourth co-planar, intermeshing gear set,<br>
the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P4B. Reverse shaft 164 is offset<br>
from main shaft 134 and first countershaft 136 and is depicted in separate Figure 3B<br>
for purposes of clarity.<br><br>

[0046]		Dog clutch D100 is a two-way dog clutch that is shiftable to the left in<br>
Figure 3A to connect gear 167 for common rotation with first countershaft 136.<br>
When shifted to the left, dog clutch D100 partially establishes the REV L and REV H<br>
gears indicated in Figure 4 according to the engagement schedule of Figure 6 for REV<br>
L and REV H. Dog clutch D100 is shiftable to the left to connect gear 160 for<br>
common rotation with sleeve shaft 161.<br>
[0047]		Gear 154 is concentric with and rotatable about second countershaft 138<br>
and continuously intermeshes with gear 158 which is concentric with and rotatable<br>
about main shaft 134. Gear 154 is supported on and rotates with sleeve shaft 155.<br>

with sleeve 180. Gear 162 is supported on and rotates with sleeve shaft 163. Gears<br>
154, 158 and 162 form a fifth co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of<br>
which is indicated by plane P5B.<br>
[0048]		The transmission 114 includes planetary gear set 170. Planetary gear<br>
set 170 includes a sun gear member 172, a ring gear member 174 and a carrier<br>
member 176 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 177 disposed in<br>
meshing relationship with both the sun gear member 172 and the ring gear member<br>
174.<br>
[0049]		In addition to the dog clutch D100, the transmission 114 includes<br>
seven additional torque-transmitting mechanisms for a total of eight torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms. Clutch Cl is selectively engageable to connect gear 154 for<br>
common rotation with second countershaft 138. Clutch C2 is selectively engageable<br>
to connect gear 152 for common rotation with second countershaft 138. Clutch C3 is<br>

connect main shaft 134 with the sun gear member 172, bypassing the countershafts<br>
136 and 138. Clutch C5 is selectively engageable to connect sleeve shaft 161 for<br>
common rotation with first countershaft 136. Clutch C6 is selectively engagable to<br>
ground the ring gear member 174 to the stationary transmission housing 124. Clutch<br>

GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
15<br>
174 for common rotation with gears 156 and 158 via sleeve shaft 180 and hub<br>
member 182, locking up planetary gear set 170 such that it, as well as output member<br>
132, rotates at the same speed as gears 156 and 158 and sleeve shaft 180.<br>
[0050]		The torque ratios and ratio steps of Figure 4 are achieved by utilizing<br>
the following gear tooth counts on the gears of Figures 3A and 3B: gear 140 has 57<br>
teeth; gear 142 has 55 teeth; gear 144 has 41 teeth; gear 146 has 59 teeth; gear 167 has<br>
42 teeth; gear 168 has 47 teeth; gear 165 has 25 teeth; gear 152 has 48 teeth; gear 156<br>
has 52 teeth; gear 160 has 59 teeth; gear 154 has 39 teeth; gear 158 has 59 teeth; gear<br>
162 has 50 teeth; ring gear member 174 has 85 teeth and sun gear member 172 has 35<br>
teeth. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other gear tooth counts resulting<br>
in other torque ratio, ratio step and total ratio coverage values may be used within the<br>
scope of the invention.<br>
[0051]		As is apparent in Figure 3A, each countershaft 136 and 138 includes<br>
gears arranged in not more than four of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets. The<br>
first countershaft 136 has gears in four of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets, as<br>
indicated by planes P1B, P3B, P4B and P5B. The second countershaft 138 has<br>
gears in only three of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets, as indicated by planes<br>
P2B, P3B and P5B. Thus, by utilizing the first head gear set of gears 140 and 142,<br>
the second head gear set of gears 144 and 146, and planetary gear set 170, the<br>
overall length required for the first and second countershafts 136, 138 is minimized.<br>
[0052]		Referring to Figure 5, another embodiment of a powertrain 210 with<br>
a transmission 214 within the scope of the invention is illustrated. The powertrain<br>
210 includes an engine 12 with an engine shaft 20 connected through a torque<br>
converter 16 to an input member 228 of the transmission 214. The torque converter<br>
lock-up clutch 30 may be applied to directly connect the engine output shaft 20 with<br>
the input member 228, bypassing the ratio boosting effect of the torque converter<br>
16. The torque converter 16 includes a pump portion 18, a stator portion 22<br>
grounded to transmission housing 224 and a turbine portion 26. The torque<br>
converter 16 operates as described with respect to Figure 1.<br><br>

16<br>
[0053]		The transmission 214 is operable to provide nine forward speed ratios<br>
and two reverse speed ratios between input member 228 and transmission output<br>
member 232 as indicated by the torque ratios listed in the truth table of Figure 6,<br>
and according to the engagement schedule of Figure 6 as will be discussed herein.<br>
[0054]		The input member 228 is connected for common rotation with main<br>
shaft 234. The transmission 214 further includes first countershaft 236 and a second<br>
countershaft 238, both spaced from the main shaft 234 and substantially parallel<br>
therewith. The main shaft 234 has gear 240 connected for common rotation therewith.<br>
Gear 240 intermeshes with gear 242 which is connected for common rotation with<br>
first countershaft 236. Gear 240 and gear 242 form a first co-planar, intermeshing<br>
gear set, as indicated by plane P1C. Gears 240 and 242 may be referred to as a first<br>
head gear set.<br>

253 to be concentric with and rotatable about second countershaft 238. The<br>
countershafts 236 and 238 and main shaft 234 are arranged in a triangular formation,<br>
allowing gears 248 and 252 to intermesh without interfering with the main shaft 234.<br>
This is indicated in Figure 5 by gear 248 appearing partially in phantom behind main<br>
shaft 234.<br>
[0057]		A reverse torque-transmitting mechanism CR, which is a rotating<br>
clutch, is concentric with and supported for rotation about the first countershaft 236.<br>
Clutch CR is selectively engageable to connect gear 267 for common rotation with<br>
gear 248. When Clutch CR is engaged, torque may be transferred from the main<br><br>

shaft 234 through the second head gear set to gear 248. Gear 248 and gear 250 form a<br>
third co-planar, intermeshing gear set, as indicated by plane P3C.<br>
[0058]		The transmission 214 further includes gear 252 and gear 254 both of<br>
which are concentric with and rotate about second countershaft 238. Gear 252<br>
continuously intermeshes with gear 256 which is concentric with and supported on<br>
sleeve shaft 280 for common rotation about main shaft 234. Similarly, gear 254 is<br>
supported on and rotates with sleeve shaft 255 and continuously intermeshes with<br>
gear 258 which is concentric with and supported on sleeve shaft 280 for common<br>
rotation about main shaft 234. Gear 256 also continuously intermeshes with gear 260<br>
which is concentric with and supported for common rotation about first countershaft<br>
236 on sleeve shaft 261. Gear 258 also intermeshes with gear 262 which is concentric<br>
with and supported for common rotation about first countershaft 236 on sleeve shaft<br>
263. Gear 252, gear 256 and gear 260 form a fourth co-planar, intermeshing gear set,<br>
the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P4C. Gear 254, gear 258 and gear<br>
262 form a fifth co-planar, intermeshing gear set, as indicated by plane P5C.<br>
[0059]		The transmission 214 further includes a planetary gear set 270. The<br>
planetary gear set 270 includes a sun gear member 272, a ring gear member 274 and a<br>
carrier member 276 which rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 277. The<br>
pinion gears 277 intermesh with both the sun gear member 272 and the ring gear<br>
member 274. The carrier member 276 is continuously connected with the output<br>
member 232. The sun gear member 272 is connected for common rotation with both<br>
gear 256 and gear 258 via sleeve shaft 280 and hub member 282.<br>
[0060]		The transmission 214 includes eight torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
engagable according to the engagement schedule in the truth table of Figure 6 to<br>
establish nine forward speed ratios and two reverse speed ratios between the input<br>
member 228 and the output member 232. In addition to the torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism, clutch CR, seven additional torque-transmitting mechanisms, Cl, C2, C3,<br>
C4, C5, C6 and C7 are included. An optional tenth forward speed ratio may be<br>
established by engaging C4, releasing C3 and keeping C6 engaged after Gear 3.<br>
[0061]		Cl is a rotating clutch selectively engageable to connect gear 252 for<br>
common rotation with the second countershaft 238. C2 is a rotating clutch selectively<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
18<br>
engageable to connect gear 254 for common rotation with the second countershaft<br>
238. C3 is a rotating clutch selectively engageable to connect gear 260 for common<br>
rotation with first countershaft 236. C4 is a rotating clutch selectively engageable to<br>
connect main shaft 234 for common rotation with sun gear member 272, thus<br>
bypassing countershafts 236 and 238. C5 is selectively engageable to connect gear<br>
262 for common rotation with first countershaft 236. Torque-transmitting mechanism<br>
C6 is a brake selectively engagable to ground the ring gear member 274 to the<br>
transmission housing 224. C7 is a rotating clutch selectively engagable to lock-up the<br>
planetary gear set 270 by connecting sleeve shaft 280, and thereby gears 256 and 258<br>
to both the ring gear member 274 and the sun gear member 272, causing both the sun<br>
gear member 272 and the ring gear member 274, and therefore the entire planetary<br>
gear set 270 as well as output member 232, to rotate at the same speed.<br>
[0062]		Referring to Figure 6, nine forward speed ratios and two reverse speed<br>
ratios are achieved according to the engagement schedule shown therein. The<br>
numerical torque ratio values are achieved with the following gear tooth counts: gear<br>
240 has 57 teeth; gear 242 has 55 teeth; gear 246 has 59 teeth; gear 244 has 41 teeth;<br>
gear 267 has 70 teeth; gear 250 has 72 teeth; gear 248 has 75 teeth; gear 252 has 39<br>
teeth; gear 256 has 59 teeth; gear 260 has 50 teeth; gear 254 has 48 teeth; gear 258 has<br>
52 teeth; gear 262 has 59 teeth; the ring gear member 274 has 85 teeth and the sun<br>
gear member 272 has 35 teeth. As will be apparent to those skilled in the art, other<br>
gear tooth counts resulting in other torque ratio, ratio step and total ratio coverage<br>
values may be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0063]		Countershaft 236 supports gears arranged in only five co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear sets and countershaft 238 supports gears arranged in only four co-<br>
planar, intermeshing gear sets. For instance first countershaft 236 supports gears 242,<br>
267, 248, 260 and 262 arranged in only five of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets<br>
as indicated by planes PIC, P2C, P3C, P4C and P5C, respectively. The second<br>
countershaft 238 supports gears 246, 250, 252 and 254 arranged in only four of the<br>
co-planar, intermeshing gear sets, as indicated by planes P2C, P3C, P4C and P5C<br>
respectively. By utilizing the first and second head gear sets to provide a ratio<br>
change, a separate clutch is not required for each of the gears supported on the first<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
19<br>
and second countershafts 236 and 238 in order to provide nine forward speed ratios<br>
and two reverse speed ratios.<br>
[0064]		Figure 7 illustrates another embodiment of a powertrain 310 having a<br>
transmission 314 within the scope of the invention. The powertrain 310 includes an<br>
engine 12 with an engine shaft 20 connected through a torque converter 16 to an input<br>

provide nine forward speed ratios (an optional tenth forward speed ratio) and two<br>
reverse speed ratios between input member 328 and output member 332 according to<br>
the same engagement schedule as illustrated in the truth table of Figure 6 and<br>

[0072]		In addition to the reverse torque-transmitting mechanism CR, a<br>
rotating clutch C1 is selectively engagable to connect gear 352 and sleeve shaft 353<br>
for common rotation with second countershaft 328. Rotating clutch C2 is selectively<br>
engageable to connect gear 360 and sleeve shaft 361 for common rotation with first<br>
countershaft 336. Rotating clutch C3 is selectively engagable to connect gear 354 and<br>
sleeve shaft 355 with second countershaft 338 for common rotation. Clutch C4 is a<br>
bypass clutch that is selectively engageable to connect main shaft 334 directly with<br>
the sun gear member 372, bypassing the first and second countershafts 336, 338.<br>
Clutch C5 is a rotating clutch selectively engageable to connect sleeve shaft 363 and<br>
gear 362 for common rotation with first countershaft 336. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism C6 is a brake selectively engageable to connect ring gear member 374<br>
with the transmission housing 324. Rotating clutch C7 is referred to as a lock-up<br>
clutch as it is selectively engagable to connect both the ring gear member 374 and the<br>
sun gear member 372 for common rotation, thereby causing the entire planetary gear<br>
set 370 and output member 332 to rotate at the same speed as sleeve shaft 380 and<br>
gears 356 and 358.<br>
[0073]		As is apparent from the above discussion and from Figure 7, the first<br>
countershaft 336 supports gears in only four of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets<br>
as indicated by planes P1D, P2D, P4D and P5D. The second countershaft 338<br>
supports gears in four of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets as indicated by planes<br>
P2D, P3D, P4D and P5D. By utilizing the first head gear set (gears 340 and 342) and<br>
the second head gear set (gears 344 and 346) to provide a ratio, and by utilizing the<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
22<br>
planetary gear set 370, the number of clutches and gears required to be located and<br>
supported by the countershafts 336 and 338 is minimized, thus allowing minimization<br>
of the overall length of the countershafts 336 and 338.<br>
[0074]		Referring to Figures 8A and 8B, another embodiment of the<br>
transmission 414 within the scope of the invention is illustrated. A powertrain 410<br>
includes an engine 12 connected through an engine shaft 22 and torque converter 16<br>
to an input member 428 of the transmission 414. The transmission 414 provides nine<br>
forward speed ratios (and an optional tenth forward speed ratio) and two reverse<br>
speed ratios between the input member 428 and the output member 432. According<br>
to the engagement schedule of Figure 6 as discussed herein, but providing the torque<br>
ratios and ratio steps listed in the chart of Figure 9. The torque converter lock-up<br>
clutch 30 may be applied to directly connect the engine output shaft 20 with the input<br>
member 428, bypassing the ratio boosting effect of the torque converter 16. The<br>
torque converter 16 includes a pump portion 18, a stator portion 22 grounded to<br>
transmission housing 424 and a turbine portion 26. The torque converter 16 operates<br>
as described with respect to Figure 1.<br>
[0075]		The transmission 414 includes a main shaft 434, and first and second<br>
countershafts 436 and 438, respectively, spaced from the main shaft 434 and<br>
substantially parallel therewith. Gear 440 is supported for common rotation on main<br>
shaft 434 and intermeshes with gear 442 which is supported for common rotation with<br>
first countershaft 436. Gears 440 and 442 form a first co-planar, intermeshing gear<br>
set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane PIE. Gears 440 and 442 are<br>
referred to herein as a first head gear set. Gear 444 is supported for common rotation<br>
with main shaft 434 and intermeshes with gear 446 which is supported for common<br>
rotation with second countershaft 438. Gear 444 and gear 446 form a second co-<br>
planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P2E.<br>
Gears 444 and 446 are referred to herein as a second head gear set.<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
23<br>
[0076]		Gear 452 is supported by sleeve shaft 453 such that it is concentric<br>
with and rotates about second countershaft 438. Gear 454 is supported by sleeve shaft<br>
455 such that it is concentric with and rotates about second countershaft 438. Gear<br>
452 continuously intermeshes with gear 456 which is supported by sleeve shaft 480<br>
such that it is concentric with and rotates about main shaft 434. Gear 454<br>
continuously intermeshes with gear 458 which is also supported for rotation with<br>
sleeve shaft 480 such that it is concentric with and rotates about main shaft 434. Gear<br>
456 continuously intermeshes with gear 460 which is supported for rotation with<br>
sleeve shaft 461 such that it is concentric with and rotates about first countershaft 436.<br>
Gear 458 continuously intermeshes with gear 462 which is supported for rotation with<br>
sleeve shaft 463 such that it is concentric with and rotates about first countershaft 436.<br>
Gears 452, 456 and 460 partially form a third co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-<br>
planar nature of which is indicated by plane P3E.<br>
[0077]		An additional gear 467 is supported on sleeve shaft 466 for rotation<br>
such that it is concentric with and rotates about first countershaft 436. Referring to<br>
Figure 8B, a reverse cluster gear having a shaft 464 which may be referred to as a<br>
reverse shaft, is offset from main shaft 434 and countershafts 436 and 438. The<br>
reverse shaft 464 supports gear 468 for common rotation therewith as well as gear 465<br>
for common rotation therewith. Reverse shaft 464 is positioned such that gear 468<br>
continuously intermeshes with gear 467 and gear 465 continuously intermeshes with<br>
gear 456, as indicated in Figure 8B. The transmission 414 includes eight torque-<br>
transmitting mechanisms. One of the eight torque-transmitting mechanisms is a<br>
reverse torque-transmitting mechanism CR which is selectively engagable to connect<br>
the sleeve shaft 466 and gear 467 for common rotation with the first countershaft 436.<br>
When CR is engaged, torque may be transferred from the first set of co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gears aligned in plane P2E, (that is gears 440 and 442) through gear 467<br>
to the gears supported on reverse shaft 464, (that is gears 468 and 465) to gear 456 in<br>
the third set of co-planar, intermeshing gears aligned in plane P3E. In this manner,<br>
torque transferred from the first set of co-planar, intermeshing gears to the third set of<br>
co-planar, intermeshing gears. Gear 467 and gear 468 form a fourth co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P4E. Gear<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
24<br>
465 partially forms the third co-planar, intermeshing gear set aligned in plane P3E.<br>
Gears 454, 458 and 462 form a fifth co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar<br>
nature of which is indicated by plane P5E.<br>
[0078]		The transmission 414 further includes a planetary gear set 470. The<br>
planetary gear set 470 includes a sun gear member 472, a ring gear member 474 and a<br>
carrier member 476 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 477 in meshing<br>
engagement with both the sun gear member 472 and the ring gear member 474. The<br>
sun gear member 482 is continuously connected for common rotation with gear 456<br>
and gear 458 via sleeve shaft 480 and hub member 482. The carrier member 476 is<br>
continuously connected with the output member 432.<br>
[0079]		In addition to the reverse torque-transmitting mechanism CR, the<br>
transmission 414 includes seven additional torque-transmitting mechanisms. Rotating<br>
clutch Cl is supported on second countershaft 438 and is selectively engagable to<br>
connect gear 452 and sleeve shaft 453 with second countershaft 438 for common<br>
rotation. Additionally, rotating clutch C2 is supported on second countershaft 438<br>
and is selectively engagable to connect gear 454 and sleeve shaft 455 for common<br>
rotation with the second countershaft 438. Rotating clutch C5 is supported on first<br>
countershaft 436 and is selectively engagable to connect gear 462 and sleeve shaft<br>
463 for common rotation with first countershaft 436. Rotating clutch C3 is supported<br>
on first countershaft 436 and is selectively engageable to connect gear 460 and sleeve<br>
shaft 461 for common rotation with the first countershaft 436. Rotating clutch C4<br>
may be referred to as a bypass torque-transmitting mechanism and is selectively<br>
engagable to connect main shaft 434 directly with sun gear member 472, bypassing<br>
the first and second countershafts 436, 438. Torque-transmitting mechanism C6 is a<br>
brake which is selectively engagable to ground the ring gear member 474 to the<br>
transmission housing 424. Rotating clutch C7 is referred to herein as a lock-up clutch<br>
as it is selectively engagable to connect sun gear member 472 for common rotation<br>
with ring gear member 474 as well as sleeve shaft 480 and gears 456 and 454.<br>
Because the ring gear member 474 and sun gear member 472 rotate at the same speed,<br>
the entire planetary gear set 470 rotates at the same speed, and is said to be "locked-<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
25<br>
up". Therefore the output member 432 also rotates at the same speed as sleeve shaft<br>
480.<br>
[0080]		It is apparent from Figures 8A and 8B and the above discussion that<br>
the first countershaft 436 supports gears in only four of the co-planar, intermeshing<br>
gear sets, as indicated by planes PIE, P3E, P4E and P5E. The second countershaft<br>
438 supports gears in only three of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets, as indicated<br>
by planes P2E, P3E and P5E. Because the first and second head gear sets, that is<br>
gears 440 and 442, and gears 444 and 446, respectively, are used to provide a ratio<br>
change, and the planetary gear set 470 may be utilized for further ratio coverage, the<br>
number of components required on the first and second countershafts 436, 438 is<br>
minimized, enabling minimization of the overall length of the countershafts 436 and<br>
438.<br>
[0081]		The torque ratios and ratio steps illustrated in Figure 9 are achieved<br>
utilizing the following gear tooth counts: gear 440 has 57 teeth; gear 442 has 55 teeth;<br>
gear 444 has 41 teeth; gear 446 has 59 teeth; gear 452 has 39 teeth; gear 454 has 48<br>
teeth; gear 454 has 59 teeth; gear 458 has 52 teeth; gear 460 has 50 teeth; gear 462 has<br>
59 teeth; gear 465 has 34 teeth; gear 467 has 35 teeth; gear 468 has 45 teeth; the ring<br>
gear member 474 has 85 teeth; and the sun gear member 472 has 35 teeth.<br>
[0082]		Referring to Figures 10A and 10B, another embodiment of a<br>
powertrain 510 of the transmission 514 within the scope of the invention is illustrated.<br>
The powertrain 510 includes an engine 12 connected an engine output shaft 20<br>
through a torque converter 16 to an input member 528 of the transmission 514. The<br>
torque converter lock-up clutch 30 may be applied to directly connect the engine<br>
output shaft 20 with the input member 528, bypassing the ratio boosting effect of the<br>
torque converter 16. The torque converter 16 includes a pump portion 18, a stator<br>
portion 22 grounded to transmission housing 524 and a turbine portion 26. The<br>
torque converter 16 operates as described with respect to Figure 1. The transmission<br>
514 is operable to provide nine forward speed ratios (and an optional tenth forward<br>
speed ratio) and two reverse speed ratios according to the engagement schedule of<br>
Figure 6 and as described herein, but provides different ratios due to the different gear<br>
tooth counts that will be provided herein. Those skilled in the art will readily<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
26<br>
understand how to calculate the speed and torque ratios achieved using the gear tooth<br>
counts provided herein.<br>
[0083]		The transmission 514 includes a main shaft 534 and first and second<br>
countershaft 536, 538 respectively, that are spaced from and are generally parallel<br>
with the main shaft 534. Gear 540 is supported for common rotation with main shaft<br>
534 and continuously intermeshes with gear 542 which is supported for common<br>
rotation by first countershaft 536. Gears 540 and 542 partially form a first co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P1F. Gears<br>
540 and 542 are referred to herein as a first head gear set. Gear 544 is support for<br>
common rotation on main shaft 534. Gear 544 continuously intermeshes with gear<br>
546 which is supported for common rotation on second countershaft 538. Gears 544<br>
and 546 are referred to herein as a second head gear set. Gears 544 and 546 form a<br>
second co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by<br>
plane P2F. Gear 552 is supported on sleeve shaft 553 such that it is concentric with<br>
and rotates about second countershaft 538. Gear 552 continuously intermeshes with<br>
gear 556 which is supported on sleeve shaft 580 such that it is concentric with and<br>
rotates about main shaft 534. Gear 556 continuously intermeshes with gear 560<br>
which is supported on sleeve shaft 561 such that it is concentric with and rotates about<br>
first countershaft 536. Gear 552, gear 556 and gear 560 partially form a third co-<br>
planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P3F.<br>
[0084]		Gear 554 is supported for rotation on sleeve shaft 555 such that it is<br>
concentric with and rotates about second countershaft 538. Gear 554 continuously<br>
intermeshes with gear 558 which is supported for rotation with sleeve shaft 580 such<br>
that it is concentric with and rotates about main shaft 534. Gear 558 continuously<br>
intermeshes with gear 562 which is supported on sleeve shaft 563 such that it is<br>
concentric with and rotates about first countershaft 536. Gear 554, gear 558 and gear<br>
562 form a fourth co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is<br>
indicated by plane P4F.<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
27<br>
[0085]		Referring to Figure 10B, a reverse shaft 564 is positioned in a different<br>
plane than main shaft 534 and countershafts 536 and 538. The reverse shaft 564 has a<br>
gear 568 supported for common rotation thereon. Gear 565 is supported by sleeve<br>
shaft 566 such that it is concentric with and rotates about the reverse shaft 564. The<br>
reverse shaft 564 is positioned such that gear 568 continuously intermeshes with gear<br>
540 and is part of the first co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of<br>
which is indicated by plane P1F. Additionally, gear 567 continuously intermeshes<br>
with gear 565 and is positioned to intermesh with gear 556. Thus, both gears 565 and<br>
567 partially form the third co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of<br>
which is indicated by plane P3F.<br>
[0086]		The transmission 514 includes eight torque-transmitting mechanisms<br>
including a reverse torque-transmitting mechanism CR, which is a rotating clutch<br>
supported on sleeve shaft 566 and selectively engagable to connect gear 565 and<br>
sleeve shaft 566 for common rotation with reverse shaft 564. Selective engagement<br>
of clutch CR enables a transfer of torque from gear 540 of the first set of co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gears in plane P1F to gear 556 of the third set of co-planar, intermeshing<br>
gears in plane P3F.<br>
[0087]		Referring again to Figure 10A, the transmission 514 also includes a<br>
planetary gear set 570. The planetary gear set 570 includes a sun gear member 572, a<br>
ring gear member 574 and a carrier member 576 that rotatably supports a plurality of<br>
pinion gears 577 that intermesh with both the sun gear member 572 and the ring gear<br>
member 574. The sun gear member 572 is continuously connected for common<br>
rotation with gear 556 and gear 558 via sleeve shaft 580 and hub member 582. The<br>
carrier member 576 is continuously connected with the output member 532.<br>
[0088]		In additional to the reverse clutch CR, the transmission 514 includes a<br>
rotating clutch Cl supported by the second countershaft 538 and selectively<br>
engageable to connect gear 554 and sleeve shaft 555 for common rotation with second<br>
countershaft 538. The transmission 514 further includes rotating clutch C2 which is<br>
supported on the first countershaft 536 and is selectively engagable to connect gear<br>
562 and sleeve shaft 563 for common rotation with first countershaft 536. Rotating<br>
clutch C3 is supported on second countershaft 538 and is selectively engagable to<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
28<br>
connect gear 552 and sleeve shaft 553 for common rotation with second countershaft<br>
538. Rotating clutch C4 is referred to herein as a bypass both clutch and is selectively<br>
engagable to main shaft 534 with sun gear member 572, thereby bypassing both first<br>
and second countershaft 536, 538, respectively. Rotating clutch C5 is supported on<br>
first countershaft 536 and is selectively engagable to connect gear 560 and sleeve<br>
shaft 561 for common rotation with first countershaft 536. Torque-transmitting<br>
mechanism C6 is a brake selectively engagable to ground the ring gear member 574 to<br>
the transmission housing 524. Rotating clutch C7 is referred to herein as a lock-up<br>
clutch as it is selectively engageable to connect both the ring gear member 574 and<br>
the sun gear member 572 for common rotation with gears 556 and 558 and sleeve<br>
shaft 580. Because the sun gear member 572 and ring gear member 574 rotate at the<br>
same speed, the entire planetary gear set 570 and the output member 532 rotate at the<br>
same speed as the sleeve shaft 580.<br>
[0089]		As is apparent from Figures 10A and 10B and the above discussion,<br>
the first countershaft 536 supports gears in only three of the co-planar, intermeshing<br>
gears sets indicated by planes P1F, P3F and P4F. The second countershaft 538<br>
supports gears in only three of the co-planar, intermeshing gears sets indicated by<br>
planes P2F, P3F and P4F. Thus, by utilizing the first and second head gear sets, that<br>
is the first headset (gears 540 and 542) and the second headset (gears 544 and 546) to<br>
establish a ratio change, and by providing a planetary gear set 570 to provide ratio<br>
change, only two rotating clutches are necessary on each of the countershafts 536, 538<br>
to provide nine forward speed ratios (and an optional tenth forward speed ratio) and<br>
two reverse speed ratios.<br>
[0090]		The transmission 514 is operated according to the engagement<br>
schedule of Figure 6 but provides different torque ratios and steps according to the<br>
following tooth gear counts: gear 540 has 54 teeth; gear 542 has 44 teeth; gear 544<br>
has 48 teeth; gear 546 has 53 teeth; gear 552 has 48 teeth; gear 556 has 50 teeth; gear<br>
560 has 48 teeth; gear 554 has 34 teeth; gear 558 has 66 teeth; gear 562 has 34 teeth;<br>
gear 568 has 58 teeth; gear 565 has 34 teeth; gear 567 is an idler gear and can have<br>
any number of teeth without affecting the torque ratio; the ring gear member 574 has<br>
85 teeth; and the sun gear member 572 has 35 teeth. As will be apparent to those<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
29<br>
skilled in the art, other gear tooth counts resulting in other torque ratio, ratio step and<br>
total ratio coverage values may be used within the scope of the invention.<br>
[0091]		Figures 11A and 11B illustrate another embodiment of a transmission<br>
614 within the scope of the invention. A powertrain 610 includes an engine 12 having<br>
an engine output shaft 20 connecting through a torque convert 16 to an input member<br>
628 of the transmission 614. Transmission 614 is operable to provide at least nine<br>
forward speed ratios (and an optional tenth forward speed ratio) and two reverse<br>
speed ratios between the input member 628 and output member 632 according to the<br>
engagement schedule of the truth table of Figure 6, but with different numerical<br>
values and different ratio steps according to tooth gear counts that will be described<br>
herein. The torque converter lock-up clutch 30 may be applied to directly connect the<br>
engine output shaft 20 with the input member 628, bypassing the ratio boosting effect<br>
of the torque converter 16. The torque converter 16 includes a pump portion 18, a<br>
stator portion 22 grounded to transmission housing 624 and a turbine portion 26. The<br>
torque converter 16 operates as described with respect to Figure 1.<br>
[0092]		The transmission 614 includes a main shaft 634 and first and second<br>
countershaft 636, 638, respectively, spaced from and substantially parallel to the main<br>
shaft 634. Gear 644 is connected for common rotation with the main shaft 634 and<br>
continuously intermeshes with gear 646 which is connected for common rotation with<br>
second countershaft 638. Gear 644 and 646 partially form a second co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P2G. Gear<br>
644 and 646 are referred to herein as a second head gear set.<br>
[0093]		Gear 640 is supported for common rotation with the main shaft 634.<br>
Gear 640 continuously intermeshes with gear 642 which is supported for common<br>
rotation with first countershaft 636. Gear 640 and gear 642 are referred to herein as<br>
the first head gear set. Gear 640 and gear 642 form a first co-planar, intermeshing<br>

[0094]		Gear 652 is supported by sleeve shaft 653 such that it is concentric<br>
with and rotatable about second countershaft 638. Gear 652 continuously intermeshes<br>
with gear 656 which is supported by sleeve shaft 680 such that it is concentric with<br>
and rotates about main shaft 634. Gear 656 continuously intermeshes with gear 652.<br>
Gear 656 intermeshes with gear 660 which is supported by sleeve shaft 661 such that<br>
it is concentric with and rotates about first countershaft 636. Gear 652, gear 656 and<br>
gear 660 partially form a third co-planar, intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature<br>
of which is indicated by plane P3G.<br>
[0095]		Gear 654 is supported by sleeve shaft 655 such that it is concentric<br>
with and rotates about second counter shaft 638. Gear 654 continuously intermeshes<br>
with gear 658 which is supported by sleeve shaft 680 such that it is concentric with<br>
and rotates about main shaft 634. Gear 658 continuously intermeshes with gear 662<br>
which is supported by sleeve shaft 663 such that it is concentric with and rotates about<br>
first countershaft 636. Gear 654, gear 658 and gear 662 form a fourth co-planar,<br>
intermeshing gear set, the co-planar nature of which is indicated by plane P4G.<br>
[0096]		Referring to Figure 11B, transmission 614 further includes a reverse<br>
shaft 664 which is offset from the main shaft 634 and countershafts 636 and 638.<br>
Gear 668 is supported for common rotation with reverse shaft 664. Reverse shaft 664<br>
is positioned such that gear 668 continuously intermeshes with gear 646 and partially<br>
forms the second co-planar, intermeshing gear set. Gear 665 is supported on sleeve<br>
shaft 666 such that it is concentric with and rotatable about the reverse shaft 664.<br>

including reverse torque-transmitting mechanism rotating clutch CR, which is<br>
selectively engagable to connect gear 665 and sleeve shaft 666 for common rotation<br>
with reverse shaft 664. Engagement of clutch CR enables a transfer of torque from<br>

[0098]		Referring to Figure 11 A, the transmission 614 includes a planetary<br>
gear set 670 that has a sun gear member 672, a ring gear member 674 and a carrier<br>
member 676 that rotatably supports a plurality of pinion gears 677 that continuously<br>

[0099]	In addition to the reverse torque-transmitting mechanism clutch CR,<br>
transmission 614 includes rotating clutch Cl which is supported on second<br>
countershaft 638 and is selectively engagable to connect gear 652 and sleeve shaft<br>
653 for common rotation with second countershaft 638. Rotating clutch C2 is<br>
supported on the first countershaft 636 and is selectively engagable to connect gear<br>
660 and sleeve shaft 661 for common rotation with first countershaft 636. Rotating<br>
clutch C3 is supported on second countershaft 638 and is selectively engagable to<br>
connect gear 654 and sleeve shaft 655 for common rotation with second countershaft<br>
638. Rotating clutch C4 is referred to herein as a bypass clutch and is selectively<br>
engagable to connect the main shaft 634 directly with the sun gear member 672,<br>
thereby bypassing the first and second countershafts 636, 638, respectively. Rotating<br>
clutch C5 is supported on first countershaft 636 and is selectively engageable to<br>
connect gear 662 and sleeve shaft 663 for common rotation with first countershaft<br>
636. Torque-transmitting mechanism C6 is a brake that is selectively engagable to<br>
ground the ring gear member 674 to the transmission housing 624. Rotating clutch<br>
C7 is referred to herein as a lock-up clutch and is selectively engagable to connect the<br>
ring gear member 674 for common rotation with the sun gear member 672, thereby<br>
causing the entire planetary gear set 670 and the output member 632 to rotate at the<br>
same speed as gears 656, 658 and sleeve shaft 680.<br>
[00100]	As is apparent from Figures 11A and 11B and the above discussion,<br>
the first countershaft 636 supports gears in only three of the co-planar, intermeshing<br>
gear sets as indicated by planes PIG, P3G and P4G. The second countershaft 638<br>
supports gears in only three of the co-planar, intermeshing gear sets as indicated by<br>
planes P2G, P3G and P4G. By utilizing the first head gear set (gears 640 and 642)<br><br>
GP-307576-PTA-DLT<br>
32<br>
and the second head gear set (gears 644 and 646) to provide ratio change, and by<br>
providing the planetary gear set 670 which provides a ratio change, only two rotating<br>
clutches are needed on each of the countershafts 636, 638, enabling minimization of<br>
the overall length of the countershafts 636, 638.<br>
[00101]	The transmission of 614 of Figures 11A and 11B is operated<br>
according to the engagement schedule of the truth table of Figure 6, but provides<br>
different numerical values for the torque ratios, speed ratios and ratio steps according<br>
to the following gear tooth counts: gear 640 has 54 teeth; gear 642 has 44 teeth; gear<br>
644 has 48 teeth; gear 646 has 53 teeth; gear 652 has 34 teeth; gear 654 has 48 teeth;<br>
gear 656 has 66 teeth; gear 658 has 50 teeth; gear 660 has 34 teeth; gear 662 has 48<br>
teeth; gear 668 has 48 teeth; gear 665 has 35 teeth; the ring gear member 674 has 85<br>
teeth; and the sun gear member 672 has 35 teeth. As will be apparent to those skilled<br>
in the art, other gear tooth counts resulting in other torque ratio, ratio step and total<br>
ratio coverage values may be used within the scope of the invention. Each of the<br>
transmission embodiments described herein is characterized by an absence of dual<br>
input clutches and of dual output clutches. As those skilled in the art will readily<br>
understand, "dual input clutches" are alternatively selectively engagable clutches<br>
which transfer torque alternatively to the two countershafts in a conventional<br>
countershaft transmission. Similarly, "dual output clutches" are alternatively<br>
selectively engageable clutches supported on the two countershafts of a conventional<br>
countershaft transmission which are alternately engageable to transfer torque from the<br>
respective countershafts to the output member.<br>
[00102]	While the best modes for carrying out the invention have been<br>
described in detail, those familiar with the art to which this invention relates will<br>
