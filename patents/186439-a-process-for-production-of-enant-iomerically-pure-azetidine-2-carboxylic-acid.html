				<td>This invention relates to a process for the production of enantiomerically-pure azetidine-2-carboxylic acid<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a process for the production of enantiomerically pure azetidine-2-carboxylic acid.<br>
Prior Art<br>
L-Azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (L-AzeOH) is known to be useful in the synthesis of inter alia high molecular weight polypeptides and in particular as an analogue of the well known amino acid proline.<br>
Previously documented preparations of enantiomerically-pure AzeOH (i.e. D- and/or L-AzeOH) from the racemate (DL-AzeOH) involve long and relatively complicated multi-step methodology.<br>
A four step preparation involving the protection, resolution and subsequent deprotection of DL-AzeOH is known from J. Heterocyclic Chem. (1969) 6, 993. In this method, N-carbobenzoxy-protected DL-AzeOH is resolved using L-tyrosine hydrazide as resolution agent, and then isolated before a final deprotection step. This process has the further disadvantage that L-tyrosine hydrazide is expensive.<br>
Other reported preparations of L-AzeOH include a five step preparation via homoserine lactone, starting from N-tosyl protected L-methionine (see e.g. Japanese Patent Application N° 14457/74 and Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn.<br><br>
(1973) 46, 659) and a five step preparation via L-4-amino-2-chlorobutyric acid, starting from L-2,4-diaminobutyric acid (see Biochem. J. (1956) 64, 323).<br>
Description! of the Invention<br>
Tartaric acid has been known for many years to exist in three stereochemical forms, the L-fofm, the D-form and the meso-form. Two of these diastereoisomers, L- and D-tartaric acid are enantiomers.<br>
We have now surprisingly found that one enantiomer of AzeOH may be converted to the other in an enantiomerically-pure form and in extremely high yields via a novel and efficient process which comprises the selective crystallisation of a diastereomerically-pure AzeOH-tartrate salt from a mixture of AzeOH, optically-active tartaric acid, an organic acid and an aldehyde, followed by liberation of the free amino acid.<br>
In particular, we have found that selective crystallisation of AzeOH with D-tartaric acid, under anhydrous conditions in the presence of an organic acid and an aldehyde produces extremely high yields of diastereomerically-pure L-AzeOH-D-tartrate in the crystalline form, from which optically-pure L-AzeOH may be liberated. Similarly, crystallisation using L-tartaric acid produces extremely high yields of diastereomerically-pure D-AzeOH-L-tartrate, from which optically-pure D-AzeOH may be liberated.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a process for the production of enantiomerically-pure AzeOH which comprises:<br>
(a) selective crystallisation of a diastereomerically-pure AzeOH-tartrate salt from a homogeneous solution of AzeOH, optically-active tartaric acid, an organic acid and an aldehyde; followed by<br><br>
(b)        liberation of the free arnino acid, hereinafter referred to as "the process according to the invention".<br>
Therefore, this application relates to a process for the production of enantiornerically-pure azetidine-2-carboxylic acid characterized in that said process comprises:<br>
(1)	(a)        wherein    when    said    enantiornerically-pure    azetidine-2-<br>
carboxylic   acid   is   L-azetidine-2-carboxylic   acid,   said   process<br>
comprises selective crystallization of a diastereomerically-pure L-<br>
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid-D-tartrate salt from a homogeneous<br>
solution  comprising   D-tartaric   acid,   an  organic   acid   and   an<br>
aldehyde, both of the kind such as herein described,  and D-<br>
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid;<br>
(b) wherein when said enantiornerically-pure azetidine-2-carboxylic acid is D-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid, said process comprises selective crystallization of a diastereomerically-pure D-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid-L-tartrate salt from a homogeneous solution comprising L-tartaric acid, said organic acid, said aldehyde, and L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid;<br>
said   selective   crystallization  in   steps   (a)   and   (b)   is   carried   out  at<br>
supersaturation temperature as herein described;<br>
(2)	followed,   in   all   cases,   by   liberation   of  enantiomerically-pure<br>
azetidine-2-carboxylic acid in a manner such as herein described.<br><br>
By "optically active" tartaric acidfw'e mean D- or L-tartaric acid or a mixture thereof. However, we prefer that the D- or L-tartaric acid which is used in the process according to the invention is enantiomerically pure, for example with an optical purity (enantiomeric excess; e.e.) of greater than 95%.<br>
The process according to the invention may be used to produce diastereomerically-pure AzeOH-tartrate salts from mixtures of AzeOH including racemic AzeOH or enantiomerically-enriched AzeOH.<br>
By "enantiomerically-enriched" we mean any mixture of the isomers of AzeOH in which one isomer is present in a greater proportion than the other.<br>
Moreover, the process according to the invention may be used to convert one enantiomer of AzeOH to the other.<br>
According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a process<br>
for the conversion of one enantiomer of AzeOH to the other which<br>
comprises:	<br>
(a)	for   conversion   of      D-AzeOH   to   L-AzeOH,   selective<br>
crystallisation of a diastereomerically-pure L-AzeOH-D-tartrate salt from<br>
a homogeneous solution of D-AzeOH, D-tartaric acid, an organic acid and<br>
an aldehyde, followed by liberation of the free amino acid; or<br>
(b)	for    conversion   of   L-AzeOH    to    D-AzeOH,    selective<br>
crystallisation of a diastereomerically-pure D-AzeOH-L-tartrate salt from<br>
a homogeneous solution of L-AzeOH, L-tartaric acid, an organic acid and<br><br>
an aldehyde, followed by liberation of the free amino acid.<br>
Although the process according to the invention may be used to produce either L-AzeOH-D-tartrate or D-AzeOH-L-tartrate with a diastereomeric excess (d.e.) greater than 90%, by "diastereomerically-pure AzeOH-tartrate salt" we mean a AzeOH-tartrate salt with a d.e. of greater than 40%.<br>
Although the process according to the invention may be used to produce either L-AzeOH or D-AzeOH with optical purities (enantiomeric excess; e.e.) of greater than 90%, by "enantiomerically-pure AzeOH" we mean an AzeOH enantiomer with an e.e. of greater than 50%.<br>
Suitable organic acids for use in the process according to the invention include Ci_8 mono- or difunctional carboxylic acids which may be linear or branched and may include further functional groups (e.g. hydroxy, halo, nitro or an aromatic ring, such as phenyl). Examples of suitable organic acids include formic acid and acetic acid. The organic acid may be used as a solvent system for dissolving the AzeOH, tartaric acid and aldehyde.<br>
Suitable aldehydes for use in the process according to the invention include C3.g mono- or difunctional aldehydes which may be linear or branched and may include further functional groups (e.g. hydroxy, halo, nitro or an aromatic ring, such as phenyl). Examples of suitable aldehydes include butyric aldehyde and caproic aldehyde.<br>
Suitable molar ratios of aldehyde to enantiomerically-enriched AzeOH are in the range 0.01:1.0 to 1.0:1.0, preferably 0.01:1.0 to 0.2:1.0 and particularly 0.05:1.0 to 0.1:1.0.<br><br>
Suitable molar ratios of L- or D-tartaric acid to AzeOH which may be employed are in the range 0.5:1.0 to 2.0:1.0, preferably 0.6:1.0 to 1.1:1.0 and particularly 0.8:1.0 to 1.0:1.0.<br>
Following dissolution of AzeOH and L- or D-tartaric acid in the solvent system, the mixture may, if necessary, be adjusted to form a homogeneous solution by appropriate means, for example by heating to elevated temperature (e.g. at reflux).<br>
Crystallisation of the diastereomerically-pure AzeOH-tartrate salt is achieved by cooling the solution of AzeOH and tartaric acid to supersaturation temperature. Final crystallisation temperatures for the above mentioned solvent systems are typically in the range -10 to 30°C, for example -5 to 10°C and preferably 0 to 5°C.<br>
Crystallisation may be effected with or without seeding with crystals of the appropriate diastereomerically-pure AzeOH-tartrate salt. However, we prefer crystallisation to be effected by seeding.<br>
The crystalline salt may be isolated using techniques which are well known to those skilled in the art, for example decanting, filtering or centrifuging.<br>
Liberation of the enantiomerically-pure free amino acid from the crystalline salt following selective crystallisation may be achieved by displacing tartaric acid from the AzeOH-tartrate salt by reacting with a carbonate, an oxide, a hydroxide or a chloride of a metal which is known to form salts with tartaric acid (eg calcium or potassium). Particularly preferred calcium salts include calcium chloride. Particularly preferred potassium salts include potassium hydroxide. The displacement reaction<br><br>
may be performed above room temperature (eg between 30 and 60 °C) in the presence of an appropriate solvent in which AzeOH is soluble and the metal-tartrate salt is poorly soluble (eg water). Free optically pure amino acid may be separated from the precipitated metal tartrate (or hydrogen tartrate) by conventional techniques (eg filtering, centrifuging or decanting).<br>
Enantiomerically-pure D- or L-AzeOH may be further purified using conventional techniques (e.g. recrystallisation from an appropriate solvent, such as acetone or water, or combinations thereof).<br>
The process according to the invention may also be used to optically enrich optically impure AzeOH-tartrate salts.<br>
The process according to the invention has the advantage that enantiomerically pure AzeOH may be prepared in higher yields, with greater optical purity, in a manner which involves fewer steps (and without the need for protecting groups), in less time, more conveniently and at a lower cost than processes previously employed for the production of enantiomerically pure AzeOH. Moreover, tartaric acid may be recovered from the process according to the invention in a form which is pure enough for further use in the process (i.e. tartaric acid may be recycled without the need for additional purification).<br>
The invention is illustrated, but in no way limited, by the following examples. The crystalline products were analysed for AzeOH content by non-aqueous titration with perchloric acid. Optical purity was determined using HPLC on a chiral column.<br><br>
Examples<br>
Preparation of Diastereomerically-Pure AzeOH-Tartrate Salts<br>
Example 1<br>
L-AzeOH (99% e.e.; 1.01 g; 10 mmol) was dissolved in formic acid (4 mL) at 80°C. Butyric aldehyde (0.072 g; 1.0 mmol) was added and the mixture heated at 90°C for 3 hours. The solvent was subsequently distilled (45°C; 4 mbar) and the residue dried under vacuum. The residue was subsequently dissolved in a mixture of ethanol:water (35.6: 29.1) at 76°C. L-Tartaric acid (1.5 g; 10 mmol) was added, the insoluble compounds were filtered off and the solution was cooled to 0°C. The crystalline product was filtered, washed and dried under vacuum to yield 0.45 g of D-AzeOH-L-tartrate with a d.e. of 75%.<br>
Example 2<br>
50 g of a mother liquor containing enantiomerically-enriched AzeOH containing 16 g (68% e.e.) of D-AzeOH (prepared in accordance with Example 1) was concentrated under vacuum to give a viscous oil, which was further dewatered by azeotropic distillation with isopropanol. Acetic acid (72 mL) was added to the concentrated residue. The mixture was heated to 95°C and D-tartaric acid (25 g) and caproic aldehyde (2.8 g) were added. The mixture was seeded with L-AzeOH-D-tartrate, kept at 95-100°C for 3 hours and then gradually cooled to 0°C. The crystalline product was filtered, washed and dried at 60°C under vacuum to yield 29.3 g of L-AzeOH-D-tartrate with a d.e. of 94.6%. Recrystallisation of 28 g of the diastereomeric salt from ethanol:water (140 mL; 1.25:1.0) yielded 21.4 g of L-AzeOH-D-tartrate with a d.e. of 100%.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
DL-AzeOH (6.14 g; 60.8 mmol) was dissolved in acetic acid (36.5 mL) at 85°C. Butyric aldehyde (0.49 g; 6.8 mmol) and D-tartaric acid (9.12 g; 60.8 mmol) were added and the mixture maintained at 85°C for 6 hours. The reaction mixture was then gradually cooled to 0°C. The crystalline product was filtered off, washed with acetic acid and dried to yield 13.78 g (90%) of L-AzeOH-D-tartrate with a d.e. of 89%. Recrystallisation 13.78 g of the diastereomeric salt from dissolved acetic acidrwater (9:1; 124 mL) yielded 11.08 g of L-AzeOH-D-tartrate with a d.e. of 99.8%.<br>
Example 4<br>
The method described in Example 3 may be used to prepare of D-AzeOH-<br>
L-tartrate using L-tartaric acid instead of D-tartaric acid.<br>
Preparation of L-Azetidine-2-carboxyIic acid (L-AzeOH)<br>
Example 5<br>
L-AzeOH-D-tartrate (7.2 g; 28 mmol; d.e. of 99%) was dissolved in hot water (16 mL). At about 45°C, aqueous potassium hydroxide (6 mL; 6 M; 24 mmol) was added over 15 minutes. The solution was cooled to 5°C at which temperature potassium hydrogen tartrate was formed, which was filtered and washed with cold water (3 mL). The combined filtrate was concentrated under vacuum to give a crude product which was stirred for 1 hour at 60°C with water (1 mL) and acetone (30 mL). The product was filtered off and dried to yield 2.5 g (89%) of L-AzeOH with an e.e. of 99%.<br><br><br><br><br>
