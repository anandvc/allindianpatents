				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This Invention relates to dynamic external wrist	fixator<br>
which  Is a device meant for orthopaedic treatment  of	unstable<br>
fractures of the distal radius or the wrist bone through	external<br>
fixation.<br>
Treatment of unstable fractures of the wrist or the distal radius caused by high velocity injuries is very difficult. Different types of treatments are required depending on various factors such as the type of fracture, age and the lifestyle of the patient. Fracture, pattern, degree of communities, radial shortening and displacement, dorsal-palmar displacement and angulations and soft tissue involvement are also considered while deciding the typ e of treatment to be administered. The basic treatment principle is to obtain accurate fracture reduction, and to maintain the reduction while protecting the wrist to rehabilitate the hand. Plaster immobilization, functional bracing  percutaneous pinning and external fixation are the different types of treatment currently in use.<br>
A conservative way of treating wrist	fracture is by plaster<br>
immobilization and is accomplished by	placing the wrist  in<br>
some  palmar  flexion and ulnar deviation	while moulding a  cast<br>
over  the posteriolateral  wrist and	anteromedial  forearm.<br><br>
Deformity and malunion are often noticed in cases where the position of immobilization is not appropriately chosen. Functional bracing is carried out with the forearm in supination, thus allowing full palmar flexion of the wrist and full elbow flexion extension. This treatment is not fully satisfactory as it enhanced collapse of the fractured fragments and often resulted in swellings. Percutaneous pinning of fractured wrist does not yield satisfactory results. Delayed union and displacement are often observed in patients treated by this technique.<br>
External fixation is generally accepted as superior to other techniques of treating wrist fracture. Conventionally, external fixators apply traction and restore displacement. Most fixators use only longitudinal traction forces which are not capable of restoring palmar tilt. Though biplanar closing wedge osteomy with distal ulnar resection and carpal tunnel release as a combination procedure has been described, there remains a need for a device that permits management of the deformity in three planes.<br><br>
This dynamic external wrist fixator has been developed with a view to fulfil this objective of providing traction in all the three planes. This dynamic external fixator is different from the existing static and dynamic fixator in that it permits multiÂ¬planar ligamentotaxis that can be finely tuned at any stage and that it facilitates controlled and protected mobilization of the wrist with the operation of one degree of freedom at a time. This device also facilitates the reduction and maintenance of the fracture and the realignment of the articular surfaces to an extent as anatomically possible. The external fixator according to this invention consists of a wrist bridging frame made of two separate members such as rods, inter-connected by a specially designed hinge means. This hinged means permits three degree freedom that can be controlled independently at any direction and is provided with locking means to lock the hinge means at the desired plane or position. The hinge means also enables the memJDer of the frame to be fixed at any orientation relative to each other. Each member of the frame is provided with a pin gripping unit and is disposed along the longitudinal axis of these members. These pin gripping units have the freedom to traverse longitudinally along this axis of the frame members.<br><br>
One of the members of the wrist frame has tensioning means such as a threaded nut for adjusting the longitudinal movement of the pin gripping unit housed thereon. This tensioning means is located at the free end of the first member or rod.<br>
The hinge means connecting the two members of the wrist frame have means for allowing three degree or directional fifeedom. It has an adjustable threaded nut and screw assembly, rotating about the longitudinal axis to adjust the length. Palmar and dorsi flexion of the wrist is controlled by another adjustable means located laterally on the second member/rod while the centre of the hinge means has an adjustable nut for regulating radial and ulnar deviation. The pin gripping means have sleeves through which pins can be drilled to the desired bones of the broken hand. The rods may have appropriate openings for housing the pin gripping means which are displacable longitudinally therein.<br>
The dynamic external wrist fixator according to this invention comprises a wrist frame consisting of at least two members inter-connected by hinge means, each of the said members having mounted thereon at least one longitudinally displaceable<br><br>
pin gripping unit, the free end of the first member being provided with a tensioning means for controlling the longitudinal movement of the pin gripping unit mounted thereon and the said hinge means consisting of three way adjusting and fastening means for controlling multiplanar ligamentotaxis of the wrist.<br>
The procedure for using the dynamic external wrist fixator will be described hereinafter.<br>
The wrist fixator assembly is positioned against the injured wrist with the rod containing the tensioning means on the hand side of the fracture and the other rod on the forearm side. The hinge mechanism connecting the two rods must be in line with the fulcrum of the wrist joint. The wrist is then kept in moderate palmar flexion and slight ulnar deviation. The rods and the pin gripping units are aligned in the desired manner and then locked with the help of fastening means in the hinge mechanism.<br>
Pins are then inserted through the sleeves provided in the pin gripping unit. Jigs known in the art may be used for drilling pins into the metacarpal bone and into the radius. Multi-planar ligamentotaxis is applied with the help of the adjusting means in<br><br>
the hinge to achieve preliminary fracture reduction. The wrist is then immobilised for a pferiod of three weeks. During this period, sustained fracture reduction can be obtained by adjusting the traction or tension mechanism periodically.<br>
After three weeks of immobilization, the patient is allowed to exercise and mobilise the wrist joint periodically by unlocking the adjusting nuts in the hinge mechanism. Care must be taken to operate only one nut at a time so that multiplanar movement is avoided. The pins and the fixators may be released after a lapse of six weeks.<br>
Multiplanar movement that is afforded by the device according to this invention minimises malunion of the fracture.<br>
This invention wHl now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
Fig I shows the dynamic external wrist fixator wherein reference number 1 indicates the pin gripping unit. Reference numberals 2, 3 and 4 show the hinge means, the tensioning means and the pins respectively. R^ and R2 are the members or rods of the wrist frame hingedly connected.<br><br>
Fig II shows an exploded view of the hinge means showing the ends of the rods connected thereto. In Fig II (a) represents a * threaded nut, rotation of which controls the turning of the longitudinal axis of rod R^. Reference letter (b) indicates an adjusting means such as a threaded nut and screw which controls radial and lunar deviation of the wrist. Threaded nut (c) located by the rod Ro controls the palmar and dorsa flexion of the hand. By adjusting the tensioning means 3 and the adjusting means a, b and c, fracture reduction takes place. By periodically unlocking these adjusting means, it is also possible to provide the desired quantum of movement to the broken hand.<br>
This invention, though illustrated herein above with a particular embodiment includes obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art within the scope and ambit of the appended claims.<br><br><br>
