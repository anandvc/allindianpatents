				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF INVERT LIQUID SUGAR<br>
CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[001] This application is related to Mexican patent application<br>
NL/9/2001/000011, filed April 18,2001, the subject matter of which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The present invention is related to processes for the production<br>
of liquid sugar, and more particularly to a process for the production of liquid<br>
sugar which avoids the need of producing final sugar and other waste<br>
materials commonly produced in the traditional sugar production processes,<br>
and reduces the thermal and electrical energy consumption compared to<br>
conventional processes for the production of crystal sugar that ordinarily need<br>
a great amount of vapor and electricity for its production.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
[003] There is currently an over-supply and an over-production of<br>
crystal sugar, which causes a low selling price that affects the financial health<br>
of the sugar industry. In addition, there is a tendency in the food industry to<br>
substitute com syrup, which is fructose rich, for crystal sugar, especially in the<br>
beverage industry. This causes an additional depression of crystal sugar<br>
prices in the worldwide market.<br>
[004] The conventional process for the production of crystal sugar<br>
from sugar cane comprises the following steps:<br>
reducing the cane size by means of a grinding machine.<br>
Normally such machines have a cutting blade rotating at a velocity of between<br>
about 400 to 500 rpm in order to extract the juice of the sugar cane by<br>
extrusion;<br>
adding from 25 to 35% in weight of "imbibition" water to the raw<br>
sugar cane juice at a temperature of 75 to 85°C to assure an efficient sucrose<br>
extraction of from 95 to 98.5%.<br>
submitting the juice obtained in the last step to a purification<br>
proceeds known as defecation consisting in the addition of 0.5Kgs of calcium<br><br>
hydroxide by each ton of cane, to raise the pH of the juice to a pH of from 7.5<br>
to 8.5;<br>
feeding the juice to a heat interchanger to raise the temperature<br>
to 90-105°C, to precipitate the resin gum serums and albuminoidal<br>
substances;<br>
feeding the obtained juice to a continuous clarifier and<br>
evaporator to separate the liquid from the solids, called sedimentation sludge.<br>
The sedimentation sludge is passed to a continuous rotary filter in which a<br>
sugar solution is recovered. The obtained precipitation product has a sugar<br>
content of from 0.8 to 1.2 % in weight;<br>
pumping the sugar solution having a sucrose content of from 12<br>
to 15% to a multiple effect evaporator (from two to three effects), wherein a<br>
solid concentration of from 60 to 65% is achieved;<br>
crystallizing the solids obtained in the last step inside a one<br>
effect intermittent evaporator until obtaining a solid concentration of from 85 to<br>
90% to obtain a boiled mass containing crystal sugar. This is the most<br>
expensive step since a bad crystallization may provoke an increase of the<br>
production of non-crystallizable product (molasses), which is a by product that<br>
consumes as much as from 10 to 15% of the total cane sugar content;<br>
centrifuging the boiled mass inside cans rotating at 1000 to 1800<br>
RPM to separate the sugar crystals from the mass;<br>
washing the sugar crystals with atomized water in order to<br>
separate the molasses from the sugar crystals; and<br>
drying the sugar crystals by means of a rotary dryer to obtain<br>
raw sugar ready for a refining process.<br>
[005] The refining process comprise the following steps:<br>
mixing raw sugar with syrup having a solid content of from 72 to<br>
75 ° Brix inside a mixer having a rotary agitator for eliminating the molasses<br>
from the sugar crystals;<br>
centrifuging the mixture of syrup and raw sugar to separate the<br>
clean sugar crystals from the syrup; and<br><br>
dissolving the crystals in water to obtain a solution having a<br>
concentration of from 55 to 60 ° Brix.<br>
[006] The purification of the solution comprises the steps of:<br>
clarification;<br>
filtration; and<br>
de-coloration in order to obtain a de-colored (clear) solution. The<br>
clarification is carried out by carbon phosphate, whitewashing, filtration and<br>
discoloration;<br>
crystallization: the de-colored solution is evaporated to obtain a<br>
solid concentration of form 85 to 90 ° Brix and then it is sent to an agitated<br>
tank; where it is centrifuged for separating refined sugar crystals form the<br>
solution;<br>
washing: the refined sugar crystals are washed with hot water<br>
and the washing water is recycled to the crystallization step;<br>
drying: the washed refined sugar crystals are dried with a<br>
countercurrent hot air stream inside a rotary drier until obtaining a water<br>
content of 0.05% in weight.<br>
[007] The main disadvantage of the above process is the production<br>
of a final solution and molasses having a high content of non-processed<br>
sugar. Moreover, in order to carry out the crystallization of the sugar, the<br>
traditional process consumes a great amount of energy (vapor and electricity).<br>
[008] Furthermore, the traditional process needs the crest of the cane<br>
to be cut, since this part of the cane contains no crystallizable<br>
monosaccharide sugars that would raise the weight of the recollected cane for<br>
as much as 20 to 25%.<br>
[009] In view of the above-referred disadvantages and of the need of<br>
the food industry for alternative to the corn syrup, applicants developed a<br>
process for the production of liquid sugar.<br>
[010] The process of the present invention obtains a final product<br>
comprising liquid sugar having a fructose content of 50% in weight and a high<br>
efficiency of extraction sugar solids content of from 69 to 75% in weight.<br><br>
[011] The process of the present invention is able to treat the crest of<br>
the cane thus using all the cane and reducing the amount of waste material.<br>
[012] Furthermore, the process of the present invention has fewer<br>
steps compared with the traditional process thus reducing the quantity of<br>
needed equipment<br>
[013] Finally thanks to the process of the present invention there is<br>
produced more sugar by using the same amount of energy and cane<br>
compared with the traditional process and eliminates the production of<br>
molasses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION.<br>
[014] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for the production of liquid sugar by which is produced a liquid sugar<br>
containing 50% of fructose and from 69% to 75% of high efficiency process of<br>
extraction sugar cane solids.<br>
[015] It is another object of the present invention to provide a process<br>
of the above referred nature by which is produced more sugar by using the<br>
same amount of energy and cane compared with the traditional process.<br>
[016] It is still another object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process of the above referred nature which is able to treat the crest of the<br>
cane thus using all the cane and reducing the amount of waste material.<br>
[017] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process<br>
of the above referred nature that has less steps compared with the traditional<br>
process thus reducing the quantity of needed equipment<br>
[018] It is an additional object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process of the above referred nature that produces more sugar by using the<br>
same amount of energy and cane compared with the traditional process and<br>
eliminates the production of molasses.<br>
[019] Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set<br>
forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be obvious from<br>
the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects<br>
and advantages of the invention will be realized and attained by means of the<br>
elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.<br><br>
