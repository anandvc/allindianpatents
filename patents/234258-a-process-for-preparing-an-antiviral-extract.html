				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention concerns an antiviral preparation obtained from a plant extract.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Viruses are important pathogens of both humans and animals. Outbreak of a virus infection often results from introduction of a new virus (such as HTV, West Nile Virus, SARS), or from introduction of a new strain of a well known virus to an immunologically naive population, e.g. influenza.<br>
Despite the importance of the recent outbreaks of West Nile Virus and SARS, influenza is still one of the most prevalent and significant viral infections. Although the availability of formalin-inactivated trivalent vaccines has reduced the impact of influenza epidemics, this virus is still associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. It infects 10 - 20 % of the total population during seasonal epidemics, resulting in between three to five million cases of severe illness and at least 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year worldwide (World Health Organization, W.H.O., Global Influenza Program, September 2003 and W.H.O. Fact Sheet, March 2003). In the U.S.A. alone, more than 100 million cases are reported each year, causing 20,000 deaths and a consequent strong economic impact, estimated at around 22.9 billion dollars for 1995 (American Lung Association, 2002). W.H.O. has estimated the total burden at around 71-167 billion dollars per year (W.H.O. Fact Sheet, March 2003).<br>
Until recently, amantadine and rimantadine were used for the treatment of influenza infection, but these are now believed to be associated with severe adverse effects (including delirium and seizures which occur mostly in elderly persons on<br><br>
 higher doses). When used for prophylaxis of pandemic influenza at lower doses, such adverse events are less apparent In addition, the virus tends to develop resistance to these drugs (Steinhaur etal., 1991).<br>
A new class of antrivirals, the neuraminidase inhibitors, has recently been developed. Such drugs as zanamivir and oseltamivir, which have fewer adverse side effects (although zanamivir may exacerbate asthma or other chronic hmg diseases) are nevertheless expensive and currently not available for use in many countries (W.H.O. Fact Sheet, March 2003). Influenza may develop resistance to neuroaminidase inhibitors too (McKimm-Berschkin, 2000; Gubavera, et al. 2002).<br>
Many herbs and spices, among them also cinnamon, have been shown to feature antimicrobial and chemoprotective activities, (Lay and Roy, 2004). Extracts from cinnamon obtained by organic solvents (for example as in Velluti et al., 2004), typically contain the following ingredients: Eugenot (82%X Caryophylene (4.6%), Eugenyt acetate (2.1% Linalool (1.8%X Cinnamaldebyde (1%X Cinnamyl alchohol acetate (1%), 2-Propyl benzodioxol (1%X and Cubebene (
Other cinnamon bark essentials oils had antibacterial activity against Bacillus cereus, (Valero and Salmeron, 2003); as well as antibacterial and antifungal activities, (Kalemba and Kunicka, 2003 and Mau et al., 2001).<br>
Cinnamon hydrophobic fractions extracted in organic solvents had antibacterial activity against Helicobacter pylori, (Tabak, M. et a/., 1999); antifungal activity for fungi causing respiratory tract mycoses, (Singh, H.B. etal, 1995), and anti HTV-1 activity caused by inhibiting the reverse transcription, (Yamasakie et alt 1998).<br>
Compounds obtained from cinnamon are also used for other indications such as the use of cinnamon powder for reducing serum glucose triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol, (Khan et al, 2003); water extracts of cinnamon were used as antioxidants (Murcia et al, 2004); were shown to prevent insulin<br>
resistance, (Qin et al., 2004); and were also shown to inhibit Na+/K.+ ATPase and Cu2+ ATPase, (Usta et al., 2003). Essential oil extract obtained from cinnamon were former shown to improve digestion (Hernandez et al., 2004).<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A.	Preparation of Active Extract<br>
The active material was isolated by three steps as follows: a) the bark was purchased in the market and was ground into powder before it was stirred in aqueous phosphate buffer 0.01M-0.02M, pH 7.0, overnight The supernatant was separated by centrifugation and was used as me crude neutralizing extract; b) The active material in the crude extract was precipitated by KC1 0.15M or 0.08M MgC12, and the precipitate was dissolved in water or 0.01M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 (CE ppt); c) This solution was submitted onto column of sepharose 4B followed by a stepwise elution with phosphate buffer and various concentrations of galactose. The active antiviral material was eluted from the column by 0.15M galactose (Figs 12 a,b,c, fraction b or II).<br>
B.	Determination of Hemagglutinating unit (HAU) and Hemolytic activity<br>
Hemagglutinating unit (HAD) was determined by using 0.4% washed human red blood cells. Viral hemolytic activity was tested in vitro in two successive steps: l)attachment of the free virus onto 1 ml of 4% washed human erythrocytes for15 minutes.at room temperature; 2) incubation in the infected cells in 37Â°C for 3hours followed by ceotrifugation. Hie hemolytic activity of the viruses was determined by measuring me absorbance of the supernatant at 540 ran.<br>
C.      Elution of active fractions<br>
60 ml of crude extract were precipitated by MgCl2 0.08M or KC1 0.15M. The precipitate was dissolved in water or in O.OIM phosphate buffer and was submitted on 10 ml column of sepharose 4B pre-washed with phosphate buffer O.OIM, pH 7.0. After submission, me column was washed with the buffer followed by stepwise elution of galactose 0.15M, 0.3M, and various concentrations of acetonttrile, as shown in Figs. 12 a,b,c. The antiviral material was found in fraction b eluted from the column by 0.15M galactose (Fig. 12(c)) or fraction II in Fig. 12a, b.<br>
Example 1: In vitro inhibition of hemolytic activity by Inflaera A by crude extract of the invention<br>
"Various amounts of crude extract were incubated with 256 HAU samples of<br>
Influenza A PR8 virus to test the inhibitory effect on me hemolytic activity of the virus, as described in the experimental procedure. Virus alone or me crude extract alone was used as controls. The results are shown in Fig. l(a).The hemolytic activity of the virus was totally inhibited by 250 Î¼g of the crude extract<br>
Example 2: In vitro inhibition of hemolytic activity of Sendai virus by the extract of the invention<br>
Various amounts of crude extract were incubated with 256 HAU samples of<br>
Sendai virus to test the inhibitory effect on me hemolytic activity of the virus, as described in the experimental procedure. Virus alone or the crude extract alone was used as controls. The results are shown in Fig l(b). The hemolytic activity of the virus was totally inhibited by 250 |og of the crude extract<br>
Example 3;   Maintenance of antiviral activity after time period, refrigeration and autoclave<br>
The cinnamon extracts (CE) or autoclaved CE was kept at room temperature or in the refrigerator for 4 years before testing their ability to inhibit the hemolytic activity of Sendai Virus (S.V.). 200 ug of CE were mixed with 256 HAU of the virus and hemolysis was tested as described in the experimental procedures. The results are shown in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the antiviral activity of CE was maintained after all treatments although it lost some activity after autoclaving at 134Â°C.<br>
Example 5:  Inhibition of Influenza A PR8 by various fractions of the extract of the Invention treated with various reageats<br>
Autoclaved CE fractions were incubated with 256 HAU of Influenza APRS<br>
vinis at room temprature for 15 minutes After application oa human crythrocytes, the mixture was transferred to 37Â°C for 3 hours. The results ace shown in Fig. 3. 50-100 Î¼g of each CE fractions was sufficient to inhibit the viral hemolytic activity. CE ppt (isolated fraction obtained by salting out with KCI 0.15M) expressed me strongest antiviral activity.<br>
CE ppt was incubated with 0.01M or 0.1M HC1 and H2SO4 at room temperature for 3 hours followed by neutralization to pH 7 before examining its ability to neutralize the virus, as described in Fig. 3. The results after this treatment are shown in Fig. 4(a).<br>
CE ppt was incubated with 0.01M or 0.1M NaOH at room temperature for 3 hours, followed by neutralization to pH 7, before examining its ability to inhibit the hemolytic activity of the virus, as described in Fig. 3. The results are shown in Fig. 4(b). The treated material remained partially active. CE ppt is me precipitated fraction obtained by salting out with KCI 0.15M<br>
CE fractions were dialyzed against water before examining the antiviral activity as described in Fig. 3. The resuhs are shown in Fig. 5. The active material<br>
in the CE fractions has a molecular weight greater than 10 KDa (the dialysis bag cut-off). Example 5:  Inhibition of Influenza A PR8 by the extract of the Invention after incubation for various time periods<br>
50-200 Î¼g samples of 1he CE ppt fraction were incubated with the virus for<br>
1-30 minutes at room temperature, before adding the erythrocytes. Hemorytic activity of the virus was determined as described in Fig. 3. The results are shown in Fig. 6(a). Short incubation (one minute) was sufficient to neutralize the virus.<br>
50-200 Î¼g samples of the CE ppt traction were incubated with the virus for 1 min. or 20 minutes at room temperature before adding the erythrocytes. Hemotytic activity of the virus was determined as described in Fig. 3. The results are shown in Fig. 6(b), Short incubation (one minute) was sufficient to neutralize the virus.<br>
Example6; inhibition of influenza APR8 pre-absorbed onto erythrocytes<br>
 256 HAU of Influenza APRS vims were absorbed to human erythrocytes at room temperature before application of various CE fractions, and incubation at 37Â°C as described in methods. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Each of me CE fractions inhibited the hemolytic activity of the virus, although mis required at least two-fold amount of each traction compared to the direct interaction between the free vims and me CE fractions.<br>
Two CE fractions were absorbed onto human erythrocytes, and the excess was washed twice with PBS before application of 256 HAU of Influenza A PR8 virus at room temperature and incubation at 37Â°C as described in methods. The results are shown in Fig, 8. Bom the refrigerated crude extract and the isolated fraction CE ppt protected the eaymrocytes from me hemorvtie activity of the virus, but CE ppt was more effective. The amount needed for me protections was 4-10 times higher man the amount that inhibited the virus by direct interaction.<br><br>
Example 7: In vivo effect of treatment of the extract of the Invention on Influenza A infected mice<br>
3.5 week old mice were injected Lv. (caudal vein) with 250 ul of PBS<br>
containing 128 HAU of Influenza A virus alone or Influenza A mixed with 250 ug of the crude extract or me crude extract alone. The mice were weighed at 2-3 day intervals. The results are shown in Pig. 9. While the mice infected with the virus alone lost weight and most of mem died within 7-10 days, the mice injected with a mixture of the virus and the crude extract continued to gain weight almost on a level with those injected with the crude extract alone. Each group included 10 mice.<br>
Examnle 8:      in vivo effect of the extract of the invention  on Sendai virus<br>
3.5 week old mice were allowed to inhale 50 ul of water containing 64 HAU of Sendai virus alone, or virus mixed wim 125 Î¼g of the etude extract, or the crude extract alone. Tbe mice were weighed at 2-3 day intervals. The results are shown in Fig. 10. While the mice infected wim me virus akne lost weignt and most of them died within 7-10 days, the mice treated internasally with a mixture of the virus and the crude extract recovered and gained weight Each group included 10 mice.<br>
Example 9: In vivo effect of the extract of the invention on Influenza A PR8 infection<br>
3.5 weeks old mice were injected into the caudal vein with 128 HAU of<br>
Influenza A PR8 pre-incubated with 250 Î¼g of me CE inhibitor for 30 minutes at room temperature. The mice were weighed every 2-3 days for 3 weeks. The results are shown in Figs. ll(a) and ll(b). Weight loss of over 2 gr. was marked as a weight loss event No deaths occurred among the mice infected wim the virus pre-incubated wim the inhibitor. Each group included 10 mice.<br>
Example 10; Effect of the extract of the invention of HSV-1 infected Vero cells<br>
100 PFU aliquots of HSV1 were mixed with 50 Î¼g (B) of autoclaved CE ppt in 100 Î¼l medium M-199 and immediately submitted on Vero cells in 24 wells plate. After 2 hours incubation at 37Â°C, 5% COz, each well was overlaid with additional one ml medium and the incubation continued 3 days. The cells were washed twice with PBS before fixation with methanol and staining with Giemsa.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 13(a). As can be seen in lane (A), cells with HSV alone were detached and washed from plate. Against this, cells with HSV mixed with 50 Î¼g CE ppt were not affected, indicating that the extracts of the invention protected me Vero cells from HSV-1 infection.<br>
50 )jg fixed aliquots of CE ppt were incubated with samples containing 102-106 PFU of HSV1 for 1 hour in 100 Î¼l of medium M-199. Each sample was applied on confluent Vero ceil monolayer growth in 24 wells plate and the plate was incubated at 37Â°C, 5% CO, for 2 hows. One ml medium was added to each well and incubation continued 3 days. The cells were washed twice with PBS before fixation with medianol and staining with Giemsa.<br>
Results are shown in Kg. 13(b). The lanes were as follows: A - itfPFUjB-103 PFU, C - 104 PFU (A-C - virus was totally inhibited); D - 10s PFU-Vmiswas partially inhibited; E - 106 PFU - Virus was hardly inhibited; F - 102 PFU of virus without inhibitor, cells were detached and washed from wells.<br>
Aliquots containing 106 PFU of HSV1 were mixed with 50 Î¼g - 400 ng of CE ppt in 100 ul medium M-199. Each mixture immediately submitted on confluent Vero cell monolayers in 24 cells plate. After 1 hour incubation at 37Â°C, 5% CQz, the cells from each well were overlaid with one ml M-199 and the incubation continued 3 days. The cells were washed twice with PBS before fixation with methanol and staining with Giemsa.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 13(c). The lanes were as follows: A - 106PFU<br>
of virus without inhibitor, cells were detached and washed from wells; B - F: 106<br>
various-amounts of CE ppt as follows; B-50Î¼g c-100Î¼g,D -200 Î¼g, E - 300 Î¼g, F - 400Î¼g. There is direct correlation between inhibition and increasing amounts of the CE ppt<br>
As can be seen from all these results the extract of the invention was able to protect Vero cells from the damaging effects caused by HSV-1 infection.<br>
Example 11: Effects of the extract of the inveation on the weight loss of mice infected with virus<br>
Three and a half week old mice were infected with 32HAU of Sendai virus which was pre-incubated for 20 minutes with 125Î¼g of me CE ppt inhibitor or treated with the CE ppt immediately after mfecdon wim the virus. The mice were then weighed every 2-3 days during a 3-week period. As Fig. 14a shows, the two groups of mice which had been treated wdh the inhibitor started to gam weight 8 days post infection (P=Q.017). The control group which had not been treated with the inhibitor continued losing weight.<br>
In a different experiment, 3.5-week old mice were infected mtemasalry with 32 HAU of Sendai virus and immediately thereafter treated with 125Î¼g of the CE ppt inhibitor. A second group of mice was treated with the CE ppt inhibitor one hour post infection. The mice were weighed every 2-3 days for a period of 2.5 weeks. As Fig. 14b shows, Mice which had been treated wim the CE ppt inhibitor continued to gain weight whereas mice in the control group lost weight significantly (P=
Example 12; Effect of die extract of the invention on die weight loss of immunized mice<br>
In another set of experiments, immunization with the CE ppt inhibitor was tested. 3.5 week old mice were immunized intranasalry (Ln). with 32 HAU of Sendai virus mixed with 125Î¼g of the CE ppt The controlled group received only water. Three weeks post immunization both groups of mice were infected with 64 HAIlofJhe.narye virus alone. The mice were wejgh^ every 2-3 days over a period of 40 days. As Fig. 14c shows, the immunized mice were not affected by the subsequent virus infection and kept gaining weight (P=0.013).<br>
Similarly, two groups of mice were immunized 3 times by the Sendai virus mixed with the CE ppt inhibitor via two different routes of administration: oral and subcutaneousty (s.c) as shown in Fig. 14d. Two weeks after the third administration of the virus plus the CE ppt, the mice of both groups were infected with 80 HAU of the naive virus, as were the mice of the control group. The immunized mice were not affected by the subsequent virus infection and continued gaining weight Basically, no difference was observed between the mice to which the virus plus the CE ppt were administered orally or the mice which were administered s.c (P=
