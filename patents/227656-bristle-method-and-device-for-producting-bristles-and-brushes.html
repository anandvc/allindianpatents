				<td>Bristle, Method and Device for Producing Bristles and Brushes<br>
The invention concerns a bristle for a brush, in particular a cleaning<br>
brush, toothbrush or application brush and a method for producing a<br>
corresponding bristle of thermoplastic polymers through casting,<br>
preferably injection molding. The invention also concerns a device for<br>
carrying out the method and a brush comprising corresponding bristles.<br>
Animal hair and natural fibers which were previously used as bristle<br>
material for producing brushes, paint brushes or the like have been<br>
substantially replaced by plastic bristles, wherein the production of the<br>
bristle material is based largely on the well established production of<br>
synthetic textile fibers, i.e. extrusion or spinning processes. However, a<br>
bristle is subjected to completely different conditions than an endless<br>
fiber in a fiber composite. It is free and fixed at only one end and can<br>
be regarded in terms of stability as a freely projecting bar which bends<br>
and which is fixed at one end. Pressure or compression forces and<br>
sometimes also tensile forces occur during use. Compared to endless<br>
fibers, the stability requirements are different with regard to bending<br>
strength, fatigue strength under reversed bending stresses, buckling<br>
resistance and bend recovery.<br>
Corresponding bristles can be used for toothbrushes, cleaning brushes<br>
or brooms in particular in the field of hygiene, applicators for powdery<br>
or liquid media, in particular liquids, cleaning agents, solvents, paints<br>
and varnishes and cosmetics, for application pads, cleaning pads<br>
including mats for cleaning shoes, combs, hairbrushes or technical<br>
brushes. By way of example, bristles for a toothbrush are described<br>
below. The invention is however not limited thereto.<br>
As has been known for a long time, the cleaning effect of a toothbrush<br>
can be improved by providing a structure or profile on the outer surface<br>
of the bristle. If the bristles are e.g. provided on their outside with wart-<br>
like nubs (DE 100 17 167.2) or ribs (US 1 773 969) the plaque<br>
removing effect on the tooth can be increased by up to 50%.<br>
Such bristles having a structure or profile on their outer side are usually<br>
produced in the desired cross-sectional shape by extrusion or are<br>
surface-formed under continuous processing following production as an<br>
unprofiled monofilament. Profiling improves the brushing and cleaning<br>
effect but has the disadvantage that the profiling impairs the stability<br>
properties of the bristle in its mounting region and the bristle tends to<br>
bend or kink.<br>
The known externally profiled bristles also have negative effects on<br>
hygiene. Due to the profiling, chambers and undercuts are formed on<br>
the bristle proximate to and, in particular, in its fixing region in which<br>
impurities may deposit which cannot be removed or which can only be<br>
removed to an inappropriate degree due to the densely packed bristle<br>
field. This can produce fungal, bacterial and microbial growth.<br>
To increase the brushing and cleaning effect of a bristle, US 3 256 545<br>
and US 4 167 794 suggest providing a widened head at the free end of<br>
the bristle, which protrudes laterally by an amount corresponding to<br>
several times the diameter of the cylindrical bristle stem. In this design,<br>
the fixing region is loaded with high bending moments due to the mass<br>
and the brushing resistance of the head, which may cause the bristle to<br>
kink even after a short time of use thereby rendering the bristle<br>
unusable.<br>
It is the underlying purpose of the present invention to produce a bristle<br>
of the above-mentioned type which is hygienically impeccable, strong,<br>
efficient and highly stable for a long period of time. The invention<br>
should moreover produce a brush comprising corresponding bristles and<br>
propose a method for producing a corresponding bristle through casting<br>
and in particular injection molding whose bending behavior and bend<br>
recovery exceed that of extruded bristles, while permitting optimum<br>
realization of the theoretical elasticity values and tensile strengths and<br>
which permits production of bristles of high quality over large length<br>
ranges even with relatively small cross-sections to be able to produce<br>
bristle geometries and bristle arrangements in a simple fashion while<br>
thereby adjusting the brushes and paint brushes to the requirements of<br>
the final product. The invention is moreover based on providing a<br>
device, which is suitable for carrying out the method.<br>
With regard to bristles, this object is achieved through a bristle<br>
comprising the features of claim 1.<br>
The inventive bristle has no profile in and close to its lower fixing region<br>
to obtain good bristle rigidity and stability properties and to avoid<br>
formation of recesses and undercuts to reliably eliminate the hygiene<br>
problems associated therewith. In particular, the bristle can thereby be<br>
designed according to the static requirements, i.e. with respect to a<br>
desired deformation behavior and bend recovery. To render the bristle<br>
highly efficient (i.e. high brushing and cleaning effect), the surface of its<br>
free length is profiled at least in sections at a separation from the fixing<br>
region.<br>
To explain the invention, the individual sections of a bristle will be<br>
initially defined below with reference to Fig. 1. Fig. 1 shows a bristle<br>
100 having a lower substantially truncated root region a which serves<br>
for connecting to or into a bristle support or bristle body or which is part<br>
of the bristle support itself. Above the root region, the bristle 100<br>
comprises a protruding free length I which projects past the bristle<br>
support after mounting the bristle. The free length I of the bristle 100 is<br>
divided into two main regions, a shaft region S and a flexing region F,<br>
each of which are subdivided into two sections. The shaft region S<br>
directly borders the root region a. It can comprise e.g. 15% to 85% and<br>
in particular 35% to 65% of the free length I of the bristle 100. The<br>
flexing region F joins above the shaft region S and occupies the rest of<br>
the free length I. The shaft region S is composed of a lower shaft base<br>
section b bordering the root region a and a shaft section c disposed<br>
thereabove. The shaft base section b can assume e.g. 10% to 40% of<br>
the length of the shaft region S or even be relatively short, i.e. have an<br>
axial length of =10mm and in particular =1mm. The flexing region F<br>
disposed above the shaft region S, which is decisive for the brushing<br>
and cleaning properties of the brush, is composed of a lower active and<br>
flexing section d bordering the shaft region S and a tip section t<br>
disposed thereabove forming the free end of the bristle 100. The flexing<br>
and active section d can assume e.g. 50% to 95% of the length of the<br>
flexing region F.<br>
To prevent collection of impurities close to the fixing or mounting region<br>
of the bristle, the invention provides that the bristle has a continuous<br>
depression-free jacket at least in the shaft base section b. The cross-<br>
section of the bristle in the shaft base section b can thereby be circular,<br>
oval or even polygonal with rounded corners. The jacket surface is<br>
preferably smooth and without fractures or undercuts.<br>
In the flexing region F, i.e. the active and flexing section d and/or the<br>
tip section t, at least sections of the jacket of the bristle have a profiling<br>
formed through elevations and/or depressions within an enveloping<br>
surface of the bristle which increases the brushing and cleaning effect of<br>
the bristle.<br>
The profiling may also be formed in the shaft section c and in particular<br>
in its upper section joining the active and flexing section d. In a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the cross-section of the bristle<br>
also has a continuous and depression-free jacket in the shaft section c<br>
as in the shaft base section b. It is thereby not necessary that the shaft<br>
section c and the shaft base section b have the same cross-sectional<br>
shape or cross-sectional dimensions.<br>
To ensure stability of the bristle for a maximum service life, the<br>
invention may provide that the cross-sectional dimensions of the bristle<br>
throughout the region of its free length I, i.e. in the shaft region S and<br>
in the flexing region F do not exceed the cross-sectional dimensions in<br>
the region of the shaft base section b, and in particular of its lower<br>
cross-section at which the shaft base section b joins the root region a.<br>
Due to the continuous depression-free jacket provided in the shaft base<br>
section b and the profiling formed in the flexing region F, the bristle has<br>
regions of different cross-sectional shape. The cross-sectional shape of<br>
the bristle in the longitudinal direction can thereby change once or<br>
several times. The bristle may consist e.g. of sequential regions with<br>
round, oval, polygonal (in particular square, triangular, rectangular or<br>
octagonal), Y-shaped, crossed or star-shaped, annular or also arc-<br>
shaped or circle segment-shaped cross-section.<br>
In a variant, at least sections of the outer envelope of the bristle in the<br>
region of its free length I, may have the shape of a surface of a straight<br>
cylinder and/or of a cone or truncated cone. In particular, the free<br>
length I of the bristle can be formed from a sequence of regions of<br>
different geometrical shape. The regions may be e.g. cylindrical,<br>
conical, constricted (hyperboloidal) or bulged (shape of a barrel body).<br>
The transitions between the regions of differing cross-sections and/or<br>
differing geometrical shapes and the transitions between the profilings<br>
and/or between the profiling and the depression-free jacket should be<br>
smooth and as continuous as possible.<br>
If the bristle is conical along its entire free length or at least in sections,<br>
the conicity angle should be less than 5° and in particular less than 1°.<br>
The enveloping surface diameter of the bristle can be between<br>
0.010mm and 10.0mm, wherein bristles having an enveloping surface<br>
diameter of 
bristle can be determined through corresponding selection of the<br>
diameter and/or the cross-sectional shape and/or the composition of<br>
the bristle from a succession of different geometrical sections and/or<br>
through material selection.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the profiling is formed in<br>
the upper region of the active and flexing section d and/or in the tip<br>
section. In this connection, one single profiling may be provided.<br>
Alternatively, several similar or different profilings can be adjacent to<br>
another in the longitudinal direction of the bristle. In particular, a region<br>
with a preferably smooth, depression-free surface can be disposed<br>
between two axially separated profilings.<br>
The surface envelope may be smooth or, in a further development of<br>
the invention, at least sections of that outer surface of the bristle may<br>
have a roughness, in particular, in the micro-range.<br>
The profiling can be designed in various ways. In a first embodiment,<br>
the profiling comprises a groove extending around the bristle such as<br>
one single groove, which helically surrounds the bristle. It is also<br>
possible that the groove extends annularly around the bristle,<br>
substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal extension of the bristle.<br>
In this case, several grooves should be disposed, one above the other,<br>
wherein a peripheral edge, preferably sharply structured, is formed<br>
between neighboring grooves to increase the cleaning effect. The cross-<br>
section of the groove can be concavely rounded or V-shaped.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, the profiling can comprise several<br>
elongated grooves extending in the longitudinal direction of the bristle,<br>
wherein the longitudinal grooves are preferably distributed about the<br>
circumference of the bristle and are preferably disposed next to each<br>
other. A sharp edge may also be formed between neighboring grooves<br>
in this embodiment.<br>
The profiling may also be generated when the bristle has, in the region<br>
of the profiling, a crossed or star-shaped cross-section with several ribs<br>
which extend in the longitudinal direction of the bristle and which are<br>
distributed about the bristle circumference. The ribs may have a sharp<br>
outside edge or be rounded.<br>
In a further embodiment, the bristle has a polygonal, in particular<br>
triangular or rectangular cross-section in the region of the profiling<br>
wherein the cross-sectional edges may be sharp or rounded.<br>
It is also possible that two of the above-mentioned profiling types are<br>
superposed on the bristle. For example, a bristle having ribs extending<br>
in the longitudinal direction can also comprise longitudinal and/or<br>
transverse grooves, in particular, on the outer sides of the ribs.<br>
In a particular embodiment of the bristle, preferably for use in an<br>
application brush, only the tip section t may be provided with a<br>
profiling. The geometrical cross-sectional shape of the bristle may<br>
thereby change in the tip section. Alternatively, the tip section t may be<br>
formed by axially extending fingers or comprise at least one axial profile<br>
element which projects in an axial direction of the bristle past the<br>
underlying active and flexing section d and to thereby form the tip<br>
section t.<br>
In a further development of the invention, the bristle is composed of<br>
axially sequential sections or parts, which consist of different materials.<br>
The materials may thereby have different properties. In particular, the<br>
shaft base section b and optionally also the shaft section c may consist<br>
of a material which provides the bristle with the desired stability and<br>
rigidity while the active and flexing section d and the tip section t may<br>
be made from a material which is particularly well suited for achieving<br>
good brushing and cleaning effect and possibly also for accommodating<br>
additives in the bristle, e.g. substances for anti-microbial action. The<br>
bristle material may also be reinforced, at least in sections. This can be<br>
effected either through adding reinforcing fibers or reinforcing fiber<br>
mixtures and/or formation of a bristle core from a stable, hardening<br>
material.<br>
The axially sequential sections or parts of the bristle, which consist of<br>
different materials, can have different colors to mark their properties. At<br>
least one of the parts may provide an indication of wear.<br>
The free end of the bristle, i.e. the outer region of the tip section t is<br>
preferably deburred or rounded and the bristles may have a slight<br>
surface structure through addition of non-melting particles during the<br>
production process, in particular during the casting or injection molding<br>
process. The non-melting particles impair the transverse contraction<br>
during the slight shrinkage of the cooling bristles and therefore produce<br>
a slight wavy surface structure.<br>
Moreover, at least sections of the bristle may be provided with a coatinc<br>
that is preferably disposed in the region of the structure and bears e.g.<br>
the additives and/or substances for antimicrobial action. The coating<br>
may provide an indication of wear.<br>
The deformation properties of the bristle can be influenced by an inner<br>
hollow axial channel which starts from the root region a and which may<br>
supply the substances for antimicrobial action during use of the bristle.<br>
The hollow axial channel can extend through a partial region of the<br>
bristle or through approximately the entire bristle up to shortly below<br>
the free end. In a further development of the invention, the hollow<br>
channel extends through the entire bristle and opens into the tip region,<br>
i.e. is open at the tip of the bristle.<br>
The bristle may be formed as a symmetrical body with the transition<br>
between the profiling and the unprofiled jacket being in a plane, which<br>
extends substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the<br>
bristle. A bristle of this type can be used in any direction, since its<br>
properties are the same at all angular orientations. To provide the<br>
bristle with a preferred effect in a certain radial direction and, in<br>
particular, a brushing and cleaning effect, a further development of the<br>
invention configures the transition between the profiling and the<br>
unprofiled jacket to be located in a plane which extends at an angle<br>
with respect to the longitudinal axis of the bristle. The plane is<br>
preferably within an angular range of between 30° and 60° relative to<br>
the longitudinal axis of the bristle.<br>
To influence the stability and strength properties and, in particular, the<br>
deformation behavior of the bristle, the root region a and in particular<br>
the shaft base section b may have a jacket. The jacket moreover<br>
reliably prevents introduction of impurities. Alternatively, the entire<br>
bristle may be provided with a jacket. The jacket may thereby be part<br>
of the bristle support.<br>
The bristles may be made from thermoplastic materials, elastomers,<br>
thermoplastic elastomers, duroplastes, silicons or other materials, which<br>
can be cast, injection-molded or compressed. Two materials may<br>
thereby border one another within a cross-section of the bristle and<br>
thereby form a multi-layer bristle (side-by-side construction).<br>
After production, the bristles may be finished on at least part of their<br>
length in a mechanical, thermal or chemical fashion through e.g.<br>
coating, coloring, varnishing, vapor-deposition or galvanization. The<br>
bristle may also be polished, ground or roughened. The free end of the<br>
bristle can be rounded, sharpened or split. Surface finishing of the<br>
bristle may include sandblasting or exposure to laser beams to thereby<br>
provide a surface structure. Finishing may also effect a color change of<br>
the bristle, at least in sections, to visualize e.g. usage or wear<br>
conditions or effects.<br>
Finishing may include chemical structuring or etching. If finishing is<br>
provided only on part of the bristles in particular the bristle ends, a<br>
wear indication may be provided as is particularly useful for<br>
toothbrushes and hygiene brushes.<br>
An inventive bristle can be produced e.g. through casting, material<br>
removal, compression molding or compression. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention, the bristle is produced through injection<br>
molding in particular of a thermoplastic polymer. A method may be<br>
thereby used as disclosed in WO 02/03831 the complete disclosure of<br>
which is hereby incorporated by reference. The above-mentioned object<br>
is preferably achieved by a method comprising the features of claim 38.<br>
Departing from the known injection molding method, wherein the<br>
molten polymer mass is injected under pressure into a bristle-molding<br>
channel of predetermined length and predetermined cross-sectional<br>
shape along this length, and the channel is vented during injection<br>
molding, this object is achieved in that the magnitude of the injection<br>
pressure is adjusted in dependence on the cross-sectional shape of the<br>
bristle-molding channel such that a shear flow of the molten polymer<br>
mass is generated with high core speed in the center of the molten<br>
polymer mass flow and large shearing effect due to wall friction under<br>
distinct longitudinal orientation of the polymer molecules, at least in the<br>
region of the molten polymer mass close to the wall, which is<br>
maintained along the channel, wherein the channel is simultaneously<br>
vented along its length to support maintenance of the shear flow.<br>
This is based on the realization that the bending behavior of a<br>
monofilament can be primarily increased through generation and<br>
maintenance of a molecular orientation which has previously not been<br>
realized in injection molding of bristles, brushes and paint brushes. The<br>
molecular structure in a molten polymer mass flow can only be<br>
substantially influenced using sufficiently narrow cross-sections and<br>
melt flow forced to a speed profile having strong shearing effects to<br>
deform and stretch the energetically most favorable tension-free balled<br>
structure. For this reason, in accordance with the invention, the<br>
injection pressure is set to a sufficiently high level that a steep flow<br>
profile forms in the bristle-molding channels which is characterized by a<br>
high core speed in the center of the flow and large shearing effect in its<br>
edge region due to the wall friction of the molten polymer mass on the<br>
channel wall, wherein the shearing forces due to wall friction are larger<br>
the higher the speed difference between neighboring flow layers. A flow<br>
profile of this type with high core speed moreover ensures perfect filling<br>
of the mold of the bristle-molding channel even for the narrowest of<br>
cross-sections (small bristle diameter) and large channel length (bristle<br>
length).<br>
The speed profile can be set in dependence on the predetermined cross-<br>
sectional shape along the length of the bristle-molding channel through<br>
a correspondingly high, optionally variable injection pressure. The<br>
polymer molecules are thereby oriented longitudinally close to the<br>
channel wall and, to a reduced degree, within the entire melt flow,<br>
wherein the magnitude of the core speed moreover prevents premature<br>
solidification of the molten mass, even for small cross-sections and<br>
large lengths. High pressure alone is not sufficient for rapid filling of a<br>
narrow molding channel. In accordance with the invention, the channel<br>
is vented along its length such that the shear flow with high flow speed<br>
is maintained up to the end of the channel and the desired longitudinal<br>
orientation of the molecules reaches the bristle tip.<br>
Practical tests have shown that the injection pressure should be at least<br>
500 bar (0.5105 kPa) and is a function of the cross-sectional<br>
dependence of the bristle-molding channel. For the quality bristles<br>
under discussion having an average bristle diameter of e.g. 0.3<br>
(measured at half the length) and a corresponding cross-section of the<br>
bristle-molding channel and with a length of 10.5mm, the desired speed<br>
profile can be produced with an injection pressure of at least 500<br>
(0.5105 kPa). Approximately 2/3 of the above-mentioned injection<br>
pressure can usually be converted into specific pressure in the bristle-<br>
molding channel such that the molten polymer mass in the channel<br>
should have a pressure &gt; 300 bar (0.3105 kPa).<br>
During solidification below the crystal melt temperature, thermoplastic<br>
materials form crystallites, which influence the modulus of elasticity (E<br>
module) and the tensile strength (tearing strength) in dependence on<br>
their shape and configuration. The formation of needle crystals has a<br>
positive influence on stiffness through increase of the E modulus and<br>
strength due to an increase of the tensile strength and initially requires<br>
linked elongated crystal seed formation on parallel molecular sections.<br>
This seed formation can be amplified compared to isothermal<br>
crystallization through the introduction of forces as given i.a. in flow<br>
processes. The inventive high injection pressure and the high flow<br>
velocity of the molten polymer mass in the bristle-molding channel<br>
obtained thereby therefore not only promote longitudinal molecular<br>
orientation but also crystal formation, wherein the high pressure<br>
simultaneously increases the packed density of the crystals through<br>
increased loading. The partial crystallization of the molecularly oriented<br>
molten mass increases the relaxation time, i.e. the molecular<br>
orientation lasts for a longer period.<br>
The above-described effects are further supported in a supplement to<br>
the invention in which the bristle-molding channel is cooled.<br>
The narrower the cross-section and the larger the length of the bristle-<br>
molding channel, the more reasonable it is to keep the channel walls<br>
warm to maintain the viscosity of the molten polymer mass and obtain<br>
complete filling of the mold. When setting the inventive method<br>
parameters, the filling of the mold is also guaranteed when the bristle-<br>
molding channel is cooled. Cooling of the channel and associated<br>
introduction of forces additionally promote formation of crystals and<br>
increase relaxation time. The stabilizing outer layer of the bristle, which<br>
is produced on the channel wall, permits increase of the post-pressure,<br>
which is common in injection molding. The higher the post-pressure,<br>
the stronger the crystal seed formation in the still molten bristle core.<br>
The pressure simultaneously increases the melting temperature and<br>
enhances cooling of the molten mass for a given mass temperature,<br>
thereby further producing a positive effect on the crystal growth speed<br>
and impeding relaxation of the molecules.<br>
The high injection pressure and high flow velocity require particular or<br>
additional measures for rapid and effective venting to ensure complete<br>
mold filling and to prevent cavities in the molding channel or air<br>
inclusions in the molten mass. In the conventional injection molding<br>
methods, the bristle-molding channel is vented when the cavity is<br>
completely closed at the end of the channel or, for a longitudinally split<br>
injection mold defining the channel, in two planes parallel to the<br>
bristles. In the first case, for forming a perfect, preferably rounded<br>
bristle end, the venting must be drastically reduced to prevent molten<br>
polymer mass from getting into the venting regions. For venting parallel<br>
to the bristles, the mold-separating plane lies in the flow direction with<br>
the consequence that the molten polymer mass penetrates into even<br>
the most narrow of venting gaps and produces mold-separating seams<br>
along the bristle jacket.<br>
The invention therefore proposes venting of the bristle-molding channel<br>
transverse to the flow direction of the molten polymer mass, wherein<br>
the venting is preferably effected in several planes transverse to the<br>
flow direction of the molten polymer mass. The number of venting<br>
planes is higher, the longer the bristle-molding channel such that, for<br>
predetermined channel length, the venting is controlled in dependence<br>
on the speed of the molten mass front. Since venting is possible in such<br>
a plane about the entire periphery of the bristle channel, there is a<br>
corresponding gap length transverse to the flow direction which is larger<br>
than that of a bristle-parallel mold-separating plane and which can be<br>
implemented over a plurality of planes.<br>
The venting planes can be provided at equal separations along the<br>
length of the bristle-molding channel in dependence on the volume to<br>
be vented, optionally with progressive or degressive separation in the<br>
flow direction of the molten polymer mass. This permits simultaneous<br>
maintenance of a sufficiently high counter pressure in the channel to<br>
obtain uniform filling of the mold.<br>
The bristle-molding channel can be vented merely through displacement<br>
of air through the flow pressure of the molten polymer mass. However,<br>
venting can also be supported by external under-pressure.<br>
The inventive method permits injection of the molten polymer mass into<br>
a bristle-molding channel from the injection side with a cross-section,<br>
which is substantially uniform to produce a substantially cylindrical<br>
bristle, which could not be produced with previous injection molding<br>
technology for bristles and brushes.<br>
The cross-section may substantially continuously taper from the<br>
injection side to produce a bristle with preferably only weak conicity,<br>
which is desired for many applications to increase the bending elasticity<br>
from the bristle root to the bristle end. Such conicity promotes<br>
maintenance or even reinforces a steep velocity profile with high core<br>
speed and shearing effect in the edge region which increases along the<br>
length such that, despite increased flow resistance, the molecular<br>
orientation and crystal formation is enhanced towards the bristle end.<br>
Injection molding produces precisely sized bristles with a tolerance of<br>
±3% in cross-section and in length while extruded bristles with the<br>
same constructive parameters have tolerances of ±10%. The initially<br>
circular cross-section of extruded bristles is ovalized through processing<br>
which is unnecessary for the bristles produced according to the present<br>
invention.<br>
Injection molding technology usually regards mold removal slopes of a<br>
few degrees (&gt;1.00°) as necessary to be able to properly remove the<br>
injection-molded part. Ejectors usually support mold removal. When the<br>
bristles are injection-molded in accordance with the above-mentioned<br>
prior art, the mold slope must be considerably larger to prevent tearing<br>
off of the bristle during removal from the mold (US 3 256 545). This is<br>
one reason why prior art uses injection-molding tools, which have a<br>
bristle-parallel mold-separating plane, thereby accepting the above-<br>
described disadvantages. The inventive method permits reduction of the<br>
mold slope to a value of 0° with sufficient mold filling. Slender bristles<br>
of great length can be produced with relatively small conicity in the<br>
region of 0.2 to 0.5° when the positive properties of a conical bristle are<br>
desired having a bending angle, which increases towards the bristle<br>
end. Mold removal is simplified by crystal formation promoted by the<br>
longitudinal orientation and the associated increase in the tensile<br>
strength (tear resistance) of the bristle, in particular in the region close<br>
to the wall, which is important for removal from the mold. Further<br>
measures for facilitating removal from the mold are described in<br>
connection with the device.<br>
In a further embodiment of the inventive method, the molten polymer<br>
mass is injected into an inlet region which narrows like a nozzle towards<br>
the bristle-molding channel for generating an extension flow to produce<br>
a bristle with a widened root region which optionally tapers continuously<br>
towards the actual bristle.<br>
Such narrowing generates an extension flow, which produces<br>
considerable molecular orientation and, due to flow properties,<br>
corresponding boosting of the flow profile after the narrowing. The<br>
narrowing is therefore preferably disposed close to the injection side. It<br>
is also possible to provide narrowings along the length of the bristle-<br>
molding channel to obtain stepped bristles wherein, in this case as well,<br>
the narrowings have positive effects on the molecular structure and<br>
crystal formation.<br>
After an optional upstream inlet region, the cross-section of the bristle-<br>
molding channel is preferably selected with a maximum width of 
such that the injection-molded bristle has a corresponding diameter<br>
with an optionally broader root region. Bristles having this cross-section<br>
and broader root region cannot be produced through extrusion or<br>
spinning. The term "largest width" in this connection means that the<br>
bristle may also have a cross-section, which differs from a circular<br>
shape, e.g. oval, wherein the largest width of the length corresponds to<br>
the larger axis of the oval.<br>
In applications of the inventive method, the ratio between the largest<br>
width and the length of the channel may be selected to be 
1:1000, preferably up to 
have a length of between 15mm and 750mm with a maximum diameter<br>
of 3mm in or close to the root region. The smaller the largest width, the<br>
shorter the length. For stringent requirements, e.g. for toothbrushes,<br>
application brushes etc. diameters above the root region of 
are recommended which permit bristle lengths of more than 60mm in<br>
the inventive method.<br>
The inventive method can be modified in a likewise advantageous<br>
fashion when the molten polymer mass is injected simultaneously into<br>
several neighboring bristle-molding channels thereby forming a<br>
corresponding number of bristles such that a set of bristles can be<br>
produced in one injection process. Minimizing of the separation of the<br>
bristle-molding channels produces bristle arrangements in the form of<br>
pucks through slight compacting of the removed bristles.<br>
The number and arrangement of the bristle-molding channels can be<br>
selected such that the entire bristle stock of a brush or of a paint brush<br>
is produced in one injection process, wherein the separations between<br>
the bristles and their geometrical relationships can be varied in<br>
accordance with the desired arrangement in the bristle stock.<br>
A further embodiment provides that the molten polymer mass is<br>
injected into the neighboring bristle-molding channels thereby<br>
simultaneously forming a connection between at least two bristles,<br>
wherein the connection may serve for further handling of the connected<br>
bristles and also as an aid for connection to a brush body, paint brush<br>
handle or the like. Alternatively, after injection of the bristles from a<br>
polymer, a molten polymer mass of another polymer can be<br>
subsequently injected to produce a connection between the bristles. The<br>
connection may be in the form of bars, grids connecting several bristles,<br>
or the like. The use of different polymers with a joining factor of &gt;20%<br>
guarantees sufficiently secure connection.<br>
The connection may further be designed such that it forms a bristle<br>
support which may simultaneously constitute the brush body or part<br>
thereof or which can be completed into a brush body or paint brush<br>
handle by injecting at least one further molten polymer mass which<br>
may comprise a different thermoplastic or thermo elastic polymer.<br>
In a further variant of the method, several bristles can be injected with<br>
different lengths such that, in combination with the bristle support<br>
connecting them, a complete bristle stock or partial stock can be<br>
produced for a brush or a paint brush, wherein the bristle ends are at<br>
different heights along a flat or non-planar envelope surface so that the<br>
finished brush has optimized bristle end contours.<br>
The bristle group can also be injected with different cross-sections to<br>
permit different effects in predetermined regions of a finished brush.<br>
Likewise, the bristle group can be injected with a cross-sectional shape,<br>
which differs along its length. The bristle group can also be injected in a<br>
mutually non-parallel fashion to produce a bristle stock with differing<br>
bristle orientations.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the method, bristles having<br>
the same geometry but different bending elasticity (hardness) can be<br>
generated through injection molding of different molten polymer<br>
masses in the same molding channels. For extruded bristles for brushes<br>
having different degrees of hardness (textures) e.g. for toothbrushes<br>
having hardness gradations of soft, medium, hard, the desired degree<br>
of hardness could be influenced only via the diameter of the bristle, i.e.<br>
toothbrushes of the same structure had to prepare and process up to<br>
three different bristle diameters. The inventive method realizes these<br>
degrees of hardness merely through selection of the polymer and<br>
optionally by adjustment of the injection pressure but with identical<br>
bristle diameters.<br>
Bristles can also be injected from a polymer or a polymer mixture,<br>
which have reduced secondary binding forces in the solidified state.<br>
These bristles can be cleaved after production through mechanical<br>
forces thereby forming flags, if necessary only after further processing<br>
into brushes or paintbrushes.<br>
The bristles can be injected from a polymer comprising additives, which<br>
become active during use. The additives may have mechanical, e.g.<br>
abrasive effect or, e.g. for toothbrush bristles, be additives with<br>
protective, therapeutical or remineralizing action. Numerous additives of<br>
this type are known.<br>
The invention also concerns a device for injection-molding bristles from<br>
thermoplastic polymers, comprising a means for producing the injection<br>
pressure and an injection mold which has at least one supply channel<br>
for the molten polymer mass and at least one cavity in the form of a<br>
molding channel with a mold contour which corresponds to the length<br>
and cross-sectional shape of the bristle to be produced, wherein the<br>
molding channel has associated venting means for releasing the air<br>
displaced during injection molding. Devices of this kind are known from<br>
the above-described prior art.<br>
A device of this type is characterized, in accordance with the invention,<br>
by means for generating an injection pressure of preferably at least 500<br>
bar (0.5105kPa) and the venting means have venting cross-sections<br>
which are distributed along the length of the molding channel and which<br>
are designed to form, in cooperation with the injection pressure, a shear<br>
flow with high core speed in the center of the molten polymer mass and<br>
large shearing effect on the wall of the molding channel.<br>
Such a device can produce bristles through injection molding as<br>
described in connection with the method. Compared to known injection<br>
molding devices for producing bristles or one-piece brushes with<br>
bristles, the device according to the invention is designed such that the<br>
desired flow dynamics is obtained in the channel forming the bristle.<br>
The means for generating the injection pressure is preferably designed<br>
such that injection pressures of between 500 and 4000 bar (0.5-105 to<br>
4105 kPa) can be set depending on the length and cross-sectional<br>
shape of the molding channel. The pressure is higher, the smaller the<br>
cross-section of the bristle to be produced and the greater its length.<br>
The means for generating the injection pressure and venting cross-<br>
sections on the molding channel are designed with respect to<br>
construction and control such that the molten polymer mass in the<br>
molding channel has a specific pressure of at least 300 bar (0.3-105<br>
kPa) to 1300 bar (1.3105 kPa). This design is adjusted to the mass flow<br>
and flow resistances to be overcome upstream of the molding channel.<br>
If the injection pressure on the generating means is sufficiently high,<br>
the injection pressure can advantageously be controlled depending on<br>
the length and the cross-sectional shape of the molding channel to<br>
permit injection of injection molds of different geometrical shapes with<br>
one injection-molding unit.<br>
This purpose is supported in that the venting means have venting<br>
cross-sections, which can be controlled depending on the specific<br>
pressure.<br>
In the inventive device, the injection mold is advantageously associated<br>
with coolant, which may be external cooling after each injection molding<br>
cycle or after removal from the mold. The molding channel in the<br>
injection mold may have associated cooling means for keeping the<br>
molding channel at a reduced temperature.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the injection<br>
mold consists of several molding plates disposed in layers transverse to<br>
the longitudinal extension of the molding channel, each of which defines<br>
a longitudinal section of the molding channel.<br>
In contrast to prior art with more or less block-shaped injection molds,<br>
the invention provides a structure of stacked molding plates. This<br>
structure permits forming of minimum bore cross-sections with high<br>
precision in each molding plate of low thickness. This and any other<br>
production technology would fail for larger bore depths. This is also a<br>
reason why longitudinally separated injection molds were necessary for<br>
the production of narrow cross-sections. Their disadvantages are<br>
described in connection with prior art. The inventive decomposition of<br>
the injection mold into several plates permits realization of molding<br>
channels of large length with high and reproducible precision over the<br>
entire length. The molding plates which comprise the end of the<br>
molding channels and form the bristle end can have, due to the small<br>
thickness of the molding plates, cavities with only small depth to form a<br>
bristle end having clear contours, without any mold separating seam,<br>
and without additional venting means. Oxidation of the polymer, which<br>
can be observed in narrow mold cross-sections through the so-called<br>
diesel effect, does not occur due to the small depth of the cavity.<br>
The layered structure of the injection mold moreover permits formation<br>
of the venting means on the molding plates, i.e. with a frequency<br>
corresponding to their number. The venting means are preferably<br>
formed between the mutually facing support surfaces of the molding<br>
plates e.g. through narrow gaps or channels. The high flow velocity of<br>
the molten polymer mass perpendicular to such narrow gaps or<br>
channels prevents the molten mass from penetrating into the venting<br>
openings, despite the high pressure. The venting openings may<br>
therefore be larger than in a two-shell mold whose mold-separating<br>
plane is in the flow direction of the molten mass. The venting cross-<br>
sections may be formed with a maximum width of only a few urn up to<br>
300um.<br>
The venting means are preferably formed completely or partially<br>
through surface roughness on the mutually facing surfaces of the<br>
molding plates.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the venting means have<br>
venting cross-sections which increase outwardly from the surface of the<br>
molding channel such that the air can freely escape after passage of the<br>
narrowest point of the venting cross-sections.<br>
The displacement of air caused by the specific pressure in the molding<br>
channel can be supported when the venting means is connected to an<br>
external under-pressure source.<br>
The device may be designed such that the molding channel has a cross-<br>
section which is substantially constant along its length or which<br>
substantially uniformly tapers towards its end to produce cylindrical or<br>
slightly conical bristles.<br>
Practical injection tests under the stated method conditions have shown<br>
that the molding channel can taper at an angle 
to produce sufficient mold slope for removing a slightly conical bristle,<br>
having excellent bending behavior, from the mold.<br>
The molding channel can have a cross-section, which discontinuously<br>
tapers towards the end to produce specially designed bristle ends as<br>
required by the application for the finished brush.<br>
The largest width of the cross-section of the molding channel is<br>
preferably = 3mm. This covers the bristle cross-sections desired for<br>
quality brushes and paintbrushes.<br>
At least one molding plate can be disposed on the injection side having<br>
a widening which tapers towards the molding channel and can be<br>
connected upstream of the molding plates defining the molding channel<br>
having the above-mentioned largest width at their sides facing the<br>
supply channel to reinforce the cross-section on the bristle root and on<br>
the bristle base and also to obtain, due to this widening, an extensional<br>
flow at the inlet region of the molding channel to support formation of<br>
the desired flow dynamics. The widening can narrow like a trumpet<br>
towards the molding channel to produce a smoothly connecting<br>
shoulder at the bristle and to the support connecting the bristles, brush<br>
body or the like. This is particularly important for hygiene brushes of<br>
any type.<br>
The ratio between the largest width of the cross-section of the molding<br>
channel and its length is preferably between 1:5 and 1:250 but may<br>
also be 1:1000 wherein the ratio is closer to the higher value the<br>
narrower the cross-section of the molding channel and closer to the<br>
lower value the larger the narrowest cross-section.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides that the number and<br>
thickness of the molding plates is matched to the length of the molding<br>
channel, wherein the number of the molding plates is inversely<br>
proportional to the ratio between the largest inner diameter of the<br>
cross-section and the length of the molding channel. The number of<br>
molding plates, which belong to an injection mold, can be variable to be<br>
able to produce bristles of varying length with the same mold.<br>
The molding plates preferably have a thickness, which is approximately<br>
three to fifteen times the central diameter of the molding channel. For a<br>
bristle of an average diameter of 0.3mm and a length of 10.5mm, the<br>
molding plates have e.g. a thickness of 1.5mm to 2.00mm. A<br>
longitudinal section of the molding channel of 1.5mm to 2.0mm can be<br>
drilled with high precision into the molding plate.<br>
The molding plates are movable perpendicular to their plate plane,<br>
individually or in groups. This permits, in particular, removal of the<br>
bristle from the mold in a non-conventional fashion, wherein e.g. the<br>
molding plates, starting with the molding plate having the mold contour<br>
at the end of the molding channel and ending with the molding plate<br>
facing the supply channel, can be subsequently removed either<br>
individually or in groups.<br>
The molding plates are reliably kept together under the method-specific<br>
high closing pressure of the injection-molding machine and are not<br>
subjected to any deforming forces, despite their low thickness.<br>
Moreover, the venting openings are kept closed by the closing pressure<br>
and, unlike channels with longitudinal venting, require no additional<br>
means to keep them closed.<br>
Practical tests have shown that the inventive narrow cross-sections and<br>
channel lengths require considerable extraction forces to release the<br>
bristles if e.g. only two molding plates are present. The bristle usually<br>
breaks. Increasing the number of plates and their successive separation<br>
from each other permits damage-free removal of the bristle from the<br>
mold, in particular when the molding plate facing the supply channel is<br>
removed last. During removal from the mold, the edges of the holes of<br>
each molding plate function as drawing nozzles to flatten any "polymer<br>
skin" formed in the mold-separating plane without disadvantageously<br>
affecting the bristle jacket. In any event, the bristle ends are perfectly<br>
formed.<br>
Individual molding plates may be displaceable parallel to the<br>
neighboring molding plates to exert transverse loading on the bristle<br>
after injection molding, thereby optimizing the molecular structure.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the injection mold has molding<br>
channels of different length and/or different cross-sectional shape to<br>
obtain e.g. a bristle stock of the desired geometry and configuration in<br>
one injection molding cycle.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment, the injection mold has<br>
molding channels comprising a central axis which extends at an inclined<br>
angle relative to the direction of motion of the molding plates, wherein<br>
each molding plate comprises a longitudinal section of the molding<br>
channel with a length which permits removal from the mold through<br>
successive removal of the individual molding plates, despite the angle<br>
variation.<br>
The subdivision of the injection mold into a plurality of molding plates<br>
extending transverse to the molding channel permits subdivision of the<br>
molding channel into longitudinal sections which nevertheless permit<br>
removal of the individual longitudinal sections from the mold without<br>
excessive strain on the bristle or deformation thereof even when the<br>
bristle axis is inclined relative to the direction of motion of the molding<br>
plates (removing direction). In this fashion, bristle groups can be<br>
produced in one single injection mold, wherein the bristles extend<br>
parallel to each other but at an angle relative to a bristle support<br>
connecting them or which have different angle orientations relative to<br>
each other.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment, the injection mold has<br>
molding channels with a central axis which is curved relative to the<br>
direction of motion of the molding plates, wherein each molding plate<br>
defines a longitudinal section of the molding channel which is<br>
dimensioned such that removal form the mold is possible through<br>
successive lifting of individual molding plates in dependence on the<br>
curvature.<br>
Wavy bristles can thereby be produced which can also be easily<br>
removed from the mold. It is also possible to simultaneously produce<br>
straight, wavy and curved bristles in one single injection mold.<br>
In a further embodiment, the injection mold has at least one molding<br>
plate which can be displaced in its plane relative to the neighboring<br>
molding plates after injection-molding of the bristles to form, together<br>
with these, a clamping means for all the bristles which acts on the<br>
corresponding portion of the length of the molding channel.<br>
The invention thereby permits use of parts of the injection mold to<br>
grasp the injected bristles and fix them in the injection mold along a<br>
portion of their length e.g. to separate the molding plates close to the<br>
ends, in the removal direction, from the remaining molding plates and<br>
to carry along the bristle blanks such that the bristles are exposed along<br>
a middle partial length, i.e. between these molding plates and the<br>
remaining molding plates. Subsequent displacement of the clamping<br>
molding plates and return of the molding plates close to the end in the<br>
direction towards the injection end of the bristles, causes these ends to<br>
project past the molding plate at the injection side. Through transfer of<br>
the injection mold, optionally under further clamping by the holder, the<br>
injection mold can be connected to another injection molding tool,<br>
which has a mold cavity forming a bristle support or brush body. In a<br>
further injection molding process, the projecting ends are surrounded<br>
by a further molten polymer mass, which fills this mold cavity.<br>
The clamping means may also serve as a transport holder to transfer<br>
the clamped bristles, after removal from the other molding plates, into<br>
another work station for connection to a brush body. This is also<br>
possible when the bristles are already joined via a connection such as<br>
e.g. bridges, grids or bristle supports. The clamping molding plate is<br>
then located close to the transition between bristles and bristle support<br>
and the holder is removed in the removal direction along with the<br>
connection and subsequently transferred, wherein the molding plates<br>
which serve as holders are replaced by an equivalent set of molding<br>
plates to again obtain a complete injection mold. The holder can be a<br>
portable holder moving in a circulating path and be reused after<br>
complete removal of the bristles from the holder to complement the<br>
injection mold. If the connection is not directly required for the<br>
subsequent fabrication steps, e.g. insertion, gluing, welding, injecting<br>
etc. it can also be removed and only the bristles may be connected to<br>
the bristle support or brush body using any conventional joining<br>
technique.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides that the injection mold<br>
consists of at least two groups of molding plates comprising clamping<br>
means of which the first group comprises part of the molding channel<br>
including the end and the further groups comprise the remaining part of<br>
the molding channel, wherein the first group can be removed from the<br>
second group and the subsequent groups can be removed from each<br>
other, in temporal sequence. The injection process is divided into a<br>
number of injection molding cycles corresponding to the number of<br>
groups such that, in the closed initial position of the injection mold, the<br>
molten polymer mass is injected in a first injection cycle into the<br>
complete molding channel, whereupon the first group can be removed<br>
from the further groups thereby carrying along the blank via the<br>
clamping means, with the withdrawal path being shorter than the length<br>
of the blank. Subsequently, in a second injection molding cycle, more<br>
molten polymer mass is injected into the released longitudinal section of<br>
the molding channel of the further groups and the steps<br>
injection/removal are repeated until the second to last group is<br>
removed from the last group to produce bristles of a length greater than<br>
the length of the molding channel. The bristle is produced in sections,<br>
which permits production of bristles of greater lengths.<br>
In this embodiment of the device, a different molten polymer mass can<br>
be injected in each injection cycle to produce a bristle which has several<br>
components along the bristle length, wherein the polymers used in each<br>
step can be matched to the requirements of the bristle and connection<br>
to the bristle support thereby producing a bristle with several regions.<br>
The removal motions of the individual groups can be matched, in short<br>
time intervals, to the injection molding cycle, wherein the blank is<br>
sufficiently cooled that it is removed from the remaining molding plates<br>
during the withdrawal motion. The individual regions are preferably<br>
bonded together but may also be connected in a positive or non-<br>
positive manner through corresponding profiling of the end of the last<br>
injected partial length.<br>
The molding plate comprising the bristle end and the mold contour at<br>
the end of the molding channel can preferably be replaced with a<br>
molding plate having a different mold contour for producing bristles with<br>
ends of different shapes. This molding plate should only have smooth<br>
contours to permit faultless removal from the mold of the bristle end,<br>
which is important for the respective use.<br>
In this fashion, the end contour of the bristles can be varied for<br>
otherwise constant geometry of the bristles, e.g. have pointed or<br>
variably rounded ends or even to produce bristles with forked-ends (two<br>
tips or the like). This molding plate may have longitudinal molding<br>
channel sections of different depths to form a contoured envelope<br>
surface for the bristle ends of a bristle stock.<br>
A mold cavity, which connects two or more molding channels, is<br>
preferably disposed between the supply channel and the molding<br>
channels of the injection mold for forming a connection among the<br>
bristles which can optionally also connect all bristles. It can serve either<br>
as an auxiliary means for further handling of the entire bristle stock or<br>
as an auxiliary means for completing the bristle stock with a brush<br>
body.<br>
The mold cavity can also be designed to produce a brush or paintbrush<br>
body or part thereof.<br>
In particular, the mold cavity can thereby be formed from different<br>
polymers for producing a brush or paintbrush body or part thereof in a<br>
multiple component design.<br>

Figs. 2A and 2B show one individual bristle 100 which can be used in<br>
particular for hygiene brushes, e.g. toothbrushes, cleaning brushes in<br>
the medical field or in hospitals or also as cleaning or application<br>
brushes in the food industry. The root region a of the bristle 100 has a<br>
trumpet-like downward facing widening with concave rounded flanks<br>
thereby providing good mounting to a surface 102 of a brush body.<br>
Along its free length L, the bristle 100 has a conically tapering<br>
enveloping surface wherein the shaft region S has a circular cross-<br>
section with a continuous, smooth depression-free jacket along its<br>
entire length. A profiling 101 is formed in the flexing region F, with the<br>
bristle 100 having a crossed cross-section in this location (see Fig. 2B)<br>
to form four axial ribs 103 which are distributed about the<br>
circumference, which are rounded at their outer sides, and which<br>
extend up to the free end of the bristle 100. A smooth, continuous<br>
transition is provided between the outer side of the ribs 103 and the<br>
surface of the shaft region S. The bristle 100 is rounded in the region of<br>
its free end.<br>
Figs. 3A, 3B and 3C show a further development of the bristle of Fig. 2A<br>
which differs therefrom only in that the ribs 103 forming the profiling<br>
101 are connected to a central section 104 having a peripherally<br>
smooth, continuous and depression-free surface to form two axially<br>
separated profilings 101 of the above mentioned type between which<br>
the central section 104 having a smooth depression-free jacket is<br>
disposed. The surface of the ribs 103 merges smoothly and continuously<br>
into the depression-free jacket of the section 104 or shaft region.<br>
The upper region of the active and flexing section and the tip section of<br>
the bristle 100 of Figs. 4A, 4B and 4C have the above-mentioned<br>
profiling 101 with crossed cross-section (Fig. 4B). A section 104 with<br>
smooth, depression-free envelope is disposed below the profiling 101. A<br>
further profiling 105 is formed below this section 104, which comprises<br>
a plurality of axially extending grooves 106 which are closely disposed<br>
next to each other about the periphery of the bristle. A sharp edge 107<br>
is formed between two neighboring grooves 106 (Fig. 4C).<br>
The bristle 100 of Figs. 5A, 5B and 5C differs from the bristle of Fig. 4A<br>
in that the profiling 108 is an arrangement of several horizontal grooves<br>
109 which extend about the periphery of the bristle, each of which<br>
having a V-shaped cross-section, wherein a circumferential, sharp radial<br>
edge 110 is formed between each of the stacked grooves 109.<br>
Figs. 6A and 6B show a modification of the bristle according to Fig. 2A<br>
and differ from this figure in that the profiling 101 has a triangular<br>
cross-section instead of a crossed cross-section (see also Fig. 6B) to<br>
create three sharp axial edges 111 which are distributed about the<br>
circumference of the bristle. The triangular cross-section extends up to<br>
the free end of the bristle 100.<br>
Figs. 7A and 7B show a further alternative of the cross-sectional design<br>
of the profiling. In accordance with this embodiment, the profiled region<br>
101 of the bristle 100 has a cross-section formed by three axially<br>
upwardly protruding ribs 103 wherein each rib has the cross-sectional<br>
shape of a segment of a circle and a gap 112 is formed between the<br>
ribs 103 such that the ribs 103 are only connected to each other in the<br>
base region.<br>
Figs. 8A, 8B and 8C show a further development of the embodiment of<br>
Fig. 7A which differs therefrom only in that the ribs 103 have an<br>
external recess 113 of concave cross-section in an upper partial region<br>
of their axial length which extends in the longitudinal direction of the<br>
bristle 100 up to the upper free end of the bristle 100.<br>
In all of the above-mentioned embodiments, the bristle has a cross-<br>
section, which tapers continuously towards the tip. The cross-sectional<br>
dimensions of the bristle in the region of its free length do not exceed<br>
the cross-sectional dimensions of the lower portion of the shaft base<br>
section b where the bristle merges into the underlying root region a.<br>
Fig. 9 shows one embodiment in which the shaft base section b has a<br>
cylindrical shape and the sections disposed above, i.e. the shaft section<br>
c of the active and flexing section d and the tip section t, taper towards<br>
the top. The entire active and flexing section d has a profiling 108 which<br>
is formed by a plurality of horizontal grooves 109 extending around the<br>
bristle 100 with intermediate sharp circulating edges 110. Fig. 9 shows<br>
that the bristle has a circular cross-section in the region of the active<br>
and flexing section d and its upper tip section t has a square cross-<br>
section to form four sharp axial edges 111.<br>
The bristle 100 of Fig. 10 has a circular cross-section with smooth<br>
depression-free envelope throughout its overall shaft region S and its<br>
active and flexing section d, wherein the shaft section c and the active<br>
and flexing section d are conical. Three contiguous fingers 114 which<br>
extend axially in an upward direction form the tip section t. In this<br>
embodiment, three fingers are provided which are disposed at the<br>
corners of a substantially equilateral triangle.<br>
The bristle 100 of Fig. 11 differs from the bristle of Fig. 10 with respect<br>
to the design of the tip section t. Instead of the fingers 114, the tip<br>
section t now has a profiling 115 in the form of a square or rhombic<br>
cross-section to form four sharp axial edges 111. The bristle has no<br>
profile outside of the tip section t and has a smooth depression-free<br>
jacket.<br>
While in the embodiment of Fig. 11, the entire tip section t has a<br>
profiling 115, Fig. 12 shows a design having an upwardly facing recess<br>
115a with concave cross-section which is additionally formed on the<br>
free end of the bristle and whose circumferential edge serves as an<br>
additional profiling.<br>
Fig. 13 shows a bristle 100 which is formed of axially sequential<br>
sections or parts 100a and 100b of different materials. A first section<br>
100a thereby forms the shaft section s, i.e. the shaft base section b and<br>
the shaft section c and consists of a foamed material, which may have a<br>
certain surface roughness. A second section 100b is provided<br>
thereabove, which forms the active, and flexing section d and the tip<br>
section c and which consists of non-foamed material. The tip section t<br>
and the upper region of the active and flexing section d has a profiling<br>
101 in the form of a crossed cross-section with four ribs 103 distributed<br>
about the periphery of the bristles.<br>
Fig. 14 shows a further development of the bristle of Fig. 13 having a<br>
third section 100c which forms the active and flexing section d, which<br>
consists of a material filled with an additive or substance for<br>
antimicrobial action, and which may also have a certain surface<br>
roughness.<br>
While in the embodiments described up to now, the bristle has a<br>
conicity which tapers towards its free end at least along partial regions<br>
of its length, Figs. 15A and 15B show a bristle 100 comprising a<br>
cylindrical enveloping surface. A profiling 101 corresponding to the<br>
bristle of Fig. 2A is formed in the region of the tip section and at least in<br>
the upper region of the active and flexing section. In accordance with a<br>
further development as shown in Figs. 16A and 16B, the profiling 101<br>
has an external coating 116 which completely surrounds the outer<br>
surface of the bristle 100 in the region of the profiling 101.<br>
Figs. 17A and 17B show a further development of the bristle of Fig. 2A<br>
and differ therefrom only in that the bristle 100 has a hollow axial<br>
channel 117 travelling in the longitudinal direction which starts at the<br>
lower end of the root region and extends approximately to half the<br>
height of the bristle. The hollow axial channel 117 may be filled with<br>
active substances, e.g. sodium fluoride, xylite or other organic or<br>
inorganic materials and can gradually release them to the surface of the<br>
bristle during use. While the cavity only extends to the lower end of the<br>
structure 101 in Fig. 17A, Figs. 18A and 18B show a bristle 100 with<br>
cylindrical enveloping surface which has a hollow axial channel 117<br>
which extends approximately through the entire length of the bristle to<br>
shortly below the free end. The front end of the hollow channel in the<br>
vicinity of the free end of the bristle has a thin sealing membrane 117a<br>
made from the bristle material itself and through which the active<br>
substance located in the hollow channel 117 can be released.<br>
Figs. 19A and 19B show a further development of the bristle of Fig.<br>
18A, wherein the hollow channel 117 extends through the entire bristle<br>
and opens in the tip section at its free end.<br>
The bristle 100 shown in Figs. 20A and 20B is uniformly cylindrical with<br>
the exception of its tip section. The tip section is formed by a plurality<br>
of integral fingers 114 extending axially and upwardly. Instead of the<br>
plurality of parallel integral fingers 114, the tip section may be formed<br>
by a profiled element 118 having one or more components (shown in<br>
Figs. 21A through 21M). In the design of Figs. 21A and 21B, the profiled<br>
element 118 is formed by a vertical, substantially rectangular wall with<br>
rounded ends. Alternatively, in accordance with Fig. 21C, two mutually<br>
crossing walls which are correspondingly disposed perpendicular to each<br>
other are provided thereby forming a crossed section. Fig. 21D shows<br>
the profiled element as three axially freely protruding integral pins<br>
which are mounted at their lower ends and which have circular cross-<br>
sections. Fig. 21E shows a profiled element in the form of three<br>
mutually crossing walls arranged to form a star-shaped cross-section.<br>
Instead of providing a substantially rectilinear wall in accordance with<br>
Fig. 21A, Fig. 21F shows a curved, thin wall with a meandering or<br>
double-S-shaped cross-section. The active and flexing section disposed<br>
below the profiled element 118 does not have the previously described<br>
circular cross-section, rather an oval cross-section. Fig. 21G shows a<br>
design corresponding to Fig. 21F with the difference being that the<br>
active and flexing section bearing the profiled element 118 now has a<br>
rectangular cross-section with rounded edges.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 21H, the profiled element has a triangular<br>
cross-section with three sharp outer edges. The profiled element in<br>
accordance with Fig. 211 is created in a solid cross-section in which two<br>
axial slots, disposed perpendicularly with respect to each other, are<br>
formed to generate four independent vertical pins, each having a<br>
circular segment cross-section.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 21J, the tip section has four walls distributed<br>
about the periphery and formed with a radially outwardly concave<br>
shape which have effective edges in each of their end regions.<br>
Fig. 21K shows a profiled element 118 with a star-shaped cross-section<br>
i.e. an inner core which has axial grooves on its outside with<br>
intermediate outwardly facing sharp edges.<br>
Fig. 21L shows an active and flexing section with oval cross-section on<br>
which three short curved walls are disposed whose convex surfaces are<br>
directed radially outwardly. Two of the walls are disposed next to one<br>
another and the third wall is laterally offset thereto. Fig. 21M shows a<br>
modification of this embodiment, wherein the active and flexing section<br>
has a rectangular cross-section with rounded edges and the walls<br>
forming the profiled elements 118 have an L-shape and are radially<br>
outwardly angled.<br>
Figs. 22A and 22B show a modification of the bristle in accordance with<br>
Fig. 2A which differs therefrom in that the profiling 101 is formed not<br>
only in the tip region and in the active and flexing section but also in<br>
the upper region of the shaft section. The shaft base section and the<br>
bordering lower region of the shaft section are also provided with a<br>
continuous, smooth, and depression-free jacket.<br>
In the embodiments mentioned above, the transition between the<br>
unprofiled jacket and the profiling was always in a plane extending<br>
substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the bristle as a<br>
result of which the bristle has similar usage properties independent of<br>
its peripheral orientation. Figs. 23A and 23B show a bristle with which<br>
the transition between the lower unprofiled jacket and the upper<br>
profiling 108 formed by a plurality of horizontal circulating grooves<br>
above which a further profiling 101 with crossed cross-section and axial<br>
ribs 103 is disposed, is in a plane E extending at an angle with respect<br>
to the longitudinal axis of the bristle. In the embodiment shown, the<br>
plane E has an inclination of approximately 45°. The bristle therefore<br>
has a profiling along a larger part of its length at the left-hand side of<br>
Fig. 23A than on the right-hand side of Fig. 23A and the brushing and<br>
cleaning properties of the bristle consequently depend on the<br>
orientation with which they are fixed to the bristle support.<br>
Figs. 24A and 24B show a modification of the bristle in accordance with<br>
Fig. 13. The bristle 100 also consists of several parts 100a and 100b<br>
made from different materials. The surface of the lower part 100a may<br>
be roughened. The connection between the two parts 100a and 100b is<br>
obtained through a funnel-shaped contacting surface 100', which<br>
permits appropriate connection between the parts 100a and 100b even<br>
for relatively small bristle sizes. The profiling 101 is formed in the tip<br>
section of the bristle 100 by a crossed cross-section with four axially<br>
extending ribs 103.<br>
Figs. 25A and 25B show a bristle corresponding to Fig. 2A having an<br>
additional external cover 119 in the lower region of the shaft section,<br>
shaft base section and root region which can reinforce and stabilize the<br>
bristle and/or provide visual indication of certain bristle properties.<br>
In accordance with Fig. 26, the entire bristle is provided with a cover<br>
119 wherein the tip section has several axially upwardly protruding<br>
fingers 120 which penetrate through the cover 119.<br>
A possible production method of a corresponding inventive bristle is<br>
explained in detail below wherein the illustrations show a bristle without<br>
surface profile for reasons of simplification.<br>
The above mentioned operating parameters for injection pressure and<br>
the achievable high core speeds with large shearing effect through wall<br>
friction produce thin bristles of adjustable length using injection<br>
molding, which has not been possible up to now, not even with<br>
extrusion of endless monofilaments, wherein even weak conicity of<br>
bristles of such endless monofilaments can be realized only through<br>
considerable technical effort (interval withdrawal). Figs. 27A and 27B<br>
show two embodiments. Fig. 27A shows (scale 2:1) a bristle having a<br>
diameter of 0.77mm in the root region and of 0.2mm at the bristle end,<br>
and with an average diameter of 0.49mm at half-length. With an<br>
extremely weak conicity angle of 0.27°, which corresponds to the mold<br>
slope of the bristle-molding channel, bristles of a length of 60mm or<br>
more can be injection-molded as are required e.g. for high-quality paint<br>
brushes or the like. They have an average diameter at half bristle<br>
length of approximately 0.5mm. Fig. 27B shows (scale 5:1) a bristle of<br>
a diameter of 0.35mm in the root region and of 0.25mm at the bristle<br>
end with a bristle length of 10.5mm and the same conical angle (mold<br>
slope). The average diameter is 0.3mm. Bristles of this type are suited<br>
e.g. for toothbrushes. Due to the slender geometry of such bristles,<br>
they can be densely arranged without producing excessive separation in<br>
the region of the bristle ends - in contrast to conventional injection-<br>
molded bristles.<br>
Fig. 28 shows the superiority in terms of technical properties and<br>
applications, of the bristle produced according to the invention<br>
compared to a bristle produced by extrusion.<br>
During extrusion spinning of a monofilament for producing a bristle of<br>
an average diameter of 0.3mm, the spinning nozzle has an outlet<br>
diameter of 0.9mm (outer vertical lines in Fig. 28). The molten polymer<br>
mass has a maximum flow speed (core speed) inside the nozzle of<br>
typically approximately 300mm/s, which is determined by the extrusion<br>
pressure and the withdrawal speed of the monofilament. The<br>
monofilament, which leaves the nozzle, is drawn along a short path, by<br>
means of the withdrawal forces, to a diameter of between 0.9 and<br>
0.3mm and cooled directly thereafter to fix the molecular structure.<br>
During subsequent drawing, the monofilament is given its final diameter<br>
of 0.3mm with a diameter tolerance of approximately ±10%. The speed<br>
profile is designated as e (extrusion) in Fig. 28.<br>
In the inventive injection molding, the bristle-molding channel has an<br>
average diameter of 0.3mm (the two inner vertical boundary lines in<br>
Fig. 28). An injection pressure in the region of 2000 bar (2105 kPa)<br>
produces a core speed of approximately 1000mm/s in the channel. The<br>
speed profile is designated as i (injection). The shearing effect in the<br>
flow, in particular in the region close to the wall is relevant for the<br>
intrinsic strength of the thermoplastic polymer, which is determined by<br>
the shearing rate (shearing moment) y. The shearing rate y across the<br>
radius r of the flow channel depends on the derivative of the speed<br>
profile with respect to the radius r<br><br>
which is inversely proportional to the square of the effective diameter of<br>
the flow channel. The shearing rate is linearly proportional to the<br>
maximum flow speed (core speed). In the above-described example<br>
shearing rates for the injected bristle are produced which exceed the<br>
stated extrusion flow by at least a factor of 10.<br>
The broken lines in Fig. 28 illustrate the shearing rates without scaling<br>
for extrusion (e1) and for injection molding (i1). They have respective<br>
maxima at the walls of the nozzle of the bristle-molding channel.<br>
Figs. 29 to 32 schematically show an embodiment of an injection mold<br>
in different operational phases which is particularly suited for injection<br>
molding of the bristles according to the inventive method. The scale is<br>
highly enlarged to show the details more clearly.<br>
The injection mold 1 has several long parallel molding channels 2 which<br>
are joined to an injection molding means via a supply channel 3. The<br>
injection molding means is designed to produce injection pressures in<br>
the region of 500 bar (0.5105 kPa), preferably = 2000 bar (2.105 kPa).<br>
The exact magnitude of the injection pressure is set in dependence on<br>
the cross-sectional shape of the molding channel 2 along its length and<br>
in dependence on the length itself such that a specific pressure &gt; 300<br>
bar (0.3105 kPa) occurs in the molding channel.<br>
The injection mold consists of a plurality of layered molding plates 4 of<br>
substantially identical thicknesses, of a molding plate 5 on the injection<br>
side, and a molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends. Each molding plate<br>
4, 5 and 6 generates one longitudinal section of the molding channel 2,<br>
which is preferably produced by bore holes.<br>
The molding plate 5 has openings 7 on the injection side which narrow<br>
towards the molding channel 2 to produce e.g. the extension flow and<br>
form the root region a of the bristle. The subsequent longitudinal<br>
sections of the molding channel in the molding plates 4 have a<br>
cylindrical or slightly conical cross-sectional shape along their length<br>
while the molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends has blind holes 8<br>
which are dome-shaped in the embodiment shown.<br>
During injection molding, the molten polymer mass enters into the<br>
narrowing openings 7 of the molding plate 5 via the supply channel 3<br>
and, due to the high core speed, fills the entire molding channel up to<br>
the plate 6 forming the ends. The molten polymer mass has a<br>
substantially unordered, balled molecular structure in the supply<br>
channel 3 which is transformed into a longitudinal molecular structure in<br>
the opening 7 on the injection side and subsequent molding channel 2<br>
due to the strong shear flow.<br>
The molding plates 4, 5 and 6 can be moved perpendicular to the plane<br>
of the plate to release the injection-molded bristles when they have<br>
achieved sufficient shape stability. The injection molding tool 1 is<br>
preferably cooled such that the wall of the molding channels 2 remains<br>
relatively cold, thereby supporting the formation of crystals in the<br>
molten polymer mass.<br>
To release the bristles from the mold, the molding plate 6 is initially<br>
removed (Fig. 30). Only very small adhesive forces must be overcome<br>
thereby ensuring that the bristle ends, which are particularly important<br>
for later use of a brush or a paintbrush, maintain their shapes. The<br>
molding plates 4 are subsequently removed individually or in groups<br>
(Fig. 31) until the ends 10 of the bristles 9 are released along most of<br>
their length. During these releasing steps, the bristles are retained by<br>
means of the molding plate 5 on the injection side and this molding<br>
plate 5 is also subsequently removed to expose all bristles 9 with their<br>
slightly thickened root region 11 (Fig. 32). The molten polymer mass in<br>
the supply channel on the injection side also effects a connection 12<br>
among all bristles 9 and the overall blank can be removed and finished<br>
into a brush, a paint brush or the like, wherein the connection is either<br>
integrated into the structure or only serves as auxiliary means for<br>
handling the bristles and is separated off before connecting the bristles<br>
to a brush body or the like.<br>
Optimum venting of the molding channels must be provided during<br>
injection molding to facilitate the desired high core speed. Fig. 33 shows<br>
an embodiment thereof. Venting occurs via narrow gaps 13 between the<br>
molding plates 4, 5 and 6 so that the air is removed along the entire<br>
length of the molding channels 2 as the front advances. Instead of<br>
narrow gaps 13, it is also possible to roughen the mutually facing<br>
surfaces of the molding plates 4, 5 and 6, to obtain overall venting<br>
cross-sections of sufficient size. The venting cross-sections have<br>
widenings 14 towards the outside to permit rapid escape of the<br>
exhausting air.<br>
The molding channels 2 may taper along their entire length with a mold<br>
slope 
mold but rather by the desired bristle shape and its bending behavior.<br>
The cross-sectional shape of the molding channels 2 must not be<br>
continuously conical (see the enlarged scale of Fig. 34 illustrating the<br>
venting geometry). The upper molding plate 4 in the drawing indicates<br>
a cylindrical longitudinal section 15 and the lower molding plate 4 a<br>
cylindrical longitudinal section 16 for the molding channel 2. The cross-<br>
section of the two molding plates 4 tapers from the longitudinal section<br>
15 to the longitudinal section 16 of the molding channel 2 by a few urn<br>
to produce a weak step at this point. At this step region, venting takes<br>
place via the gap 13 between the two molding plates, which map into a<br>
widening 14. During release from the mold, these unnoticeable steps<br>
are not visible and produce slight conicity along the entire length of the<br>
bristle. The longitudinal sections 15, 16 in the individual molding plates<br>
4 can be produced through simple drilling. Alternatively, the longitudinal<br>
sections of the individual molding plates can have identical diameters to<br>
produce a cylindrical bristle. More distinct diameter changes produce<br>
stepped bristles.<br>
Conical bristles are technically advantageous for injection molding and<br>
for removal from the mold. The smallest cross-section at the bristle end<br>
cools more rapidly than the subsequent regions of the bristle towards<br>
the root region and the step-by-step release from the bristle end to the<br>
bristle root follows the temperature gradient in the bristle.<br>
The molding plates 4 have a thickness of a few millimeters. It may<br>
correspond approximately to three to fifteen times the diameter of the<br>
molding channel 2 so that extremely precise drilling of the longitudinal<br>
sections in the individual molding plates is possible. Since they are kept<br>
adjacent to one another under the closing pressure of the injection-<br>
molding machine, even these thin molding plates maintain their<br>
dimensions and shape, despite the high injection pressure. The low<br>
thickness also ensures good thermal dissipation, since the molding<br>
plates are evenly insulated by the venting gaps. They are easy to cool<br>
for the same reason, e.g. using external coolants, which can be<br>
particularly effective when the mold is closed, and also during the time<br>
between opening and renewed closing. Effective cooling already occurs<br>
via the surrounding air due to exposure of the molding plates and in<br>
consequence of their small thickness. Alternatively, the cooling means<br>
may be integrated in or between the molding plates. Finally, the<br>
minimal loading under injection pressure permits production of the<br>
molding plates from materials having good thermal conductivity with<br>
less stringent mechanical strength properties than steel or the like.<br>
The influence of effective cooling on the molecular structure of the<br>
bristles has already been discussed above.<br>
Fig. 35 also schematically shows an injection mold 1 which consists of<br>
layered molding plates 4, wherein the molding plate on the injection<br>
side does not have widened cross-sections. In contrast to the above-<br>
described embodiments, the molding plates 4 are divided into two<br>
groups 17, 18 (see Fig. 36) wherein each group comprises at least one<br>
molding plate which can be transversely displaced (indicated in Figs. 36<br>
to 39 with double arrows 19, 20.)<br>
The transversely displaceable molding plates cooperate with the<br>
neighboring molding plates to clamp the blanks 21, which, in this<br>
embodiment, only form one portion (longitudinal section) of the final<br>
bristle. The blank 21 is injected from a thermoplastic polymer with<br>
injection parameters matched to this longitudinal section of the finished<br>
bristle. After the injection cycle, at least one displaceable plate of the<br>
group 18 of molding plates 4 (Fig. 36) is brought into a clamping<br>
position and the blanks 21 are carried along when the group 18 is<br>
removed to be thereby partially released from the molding plates 4 of<br>
the group 17 on the injection side and free a predetermined longitudinal<br>
section 22 of the molding channels in the molding plates 4 of the group<br>
17. At the end of the blank 21, profilings may be optionally formed as<br>
indicated in the drawing. After withdrawal of the molding plates 4 of the<br>
group 18, the displaceable molding plate in the group 17 is brought into<br>
the clamping position and the exposed longitudinal sections 22 are<br>
subsequently filled with a molten polymer mass, which consists of<br>
another polymer or a polymer with other additives. The longitudinal<br>
sections 23 of the bristle which are formed thereby connect to the<br>
blanks 21 through material bonding and/or positive locking.<br>
Subsequently, the displaceable forming plate in group 17 is returned to<br>
its initial position and the blanks 21 with molded-on longitudinal<br>
sections 23 are again partially withdrawn from the molding channels of<br>
the group 17 when the clamping means is closed to expose longitudinal<br>
sections 24 in the molding channels. In a further injection molding<br>
cycle, the longitudinal sections 24 are filled with a further molten<br>
polymer mass with optionally further differentiated properties to finally<br>
obtain bristles 27 having three regions (sections 21, 23 and 25) for<br>
different mechanical strength properties and/or different usage<br>
properties along the bristle length. In particular, the region 21, which<br>
encloses the bristle end, can serve as wear display to show the degree<br>
of wear of the bristle. Final release of the bristles from the mold is<br>
carried out as described above.<br>
Figs. 40 to 43 also show an injection mold 1 (Fig. 40) which consists of<br>
two groups 17, 18 of molding plates 4 each of which has at least one<br>
transversely displaceable molding plate to form a clamping means. In<br>
contrast to the above-described embodiment, the molding plate 5 on<br>
the injection side has widenings, which taper towards the molding<br>
channel. The molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends has blind holes<br>
28, 29 and 30 of different depths with dome-shaped hole bottoms such<br>
that a plurality of bristles of different lengths can be produced whose<br>
ends lie on a curved envelope surface.<br>
In the embodiment of Figs. 40 to 43, bristles are injected sequentially<br>
with two different regions 31, 32 wherein the region 31 has an<br>
extended bristle root 33. The multiple-section bristles 34 (Fig. 41)<br>
injected in this fashion are subsequently removed from the mold at<br>
their ends by removing the molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends and<br>
- optionally with delay - removing the molding plates 4 of the group 18<br>
(Fig. 41). Subsequently, at least one transversely displaceable molding<br>
plate in the group 18 is brought into a clamping position and the entire<br>
group 18, optionally together with the terminal molding plate 6, is<br>
displaced in the opposite direction so that the part of the region 31 of<br>
the bristles 34 including the root region 33 project past the molding<br>
plate 5 at the injection side. Subsequently, the injection mold 1 (Fig.<br>
42) is connected to a further injection mold 35 with a mold cavity 36<br>
into which a molten polymer mass is injected with which the root<br>
regions 23 and the longitudinal sections of the regions 31 which project<br>
into the cavity 36 are injected. The mold cavity 36 may be formed so<br>
that it defines an intermediate support for the bristles or a complete<br>
brush body in which the bristle ends are embedded without gaps so that<br>
they cannot be pulled out.<br>
In a modification of this embodiment, the molding channels 2 of the<br>
injection mold 1 of Fig. 40 can also be completely filled with one single<br>
molten polymer mass and, as shown in Figs. 41 and 42, their root<br>
regions can be exposed together with the adjacent longitudinal sections<br>
for injection with the support-forming molten polymer mass (Fig. 43).<br>
In a further modification, the bristles which are injected according to<br>
Figs. 40 to 42 and released at their mounting-side ends can be<br>
completely released from the mold through removing the molding plate<br>
6 forming the ends and the major part of the subsequent molding plates<br>
4 while being held by a few, at least three, molding plates, e.g. the<br>
injection-side molding plate 5 and the two subsequent molding plates<br>
one of which can be transversely displaced to form a clamping means.<br>
These molding plates, which serve as a transport holder, can be<br>
transported together with the bristles into another injection molding<br>
station in which they are brought into connection with the injection<br>
mold 35 while simultaneously providing a new set of molding plates<br>
with injection-side molding plate 5 to complete the injection mold 1.<br>
This transport holder can move the bristles into the second injection<br>
molding station and also continue transport into other processing<br>
stations.<br>
Figs. 44 and 45 show part of an injection mold 1 with molding plates 4<br>
and 5 after production of the bristles and removal of at least the last<br>
molding plate 6 (not shown). Replacing the latter, a flat thrust plate 39<br>
is moved in front of the released ends with which the bristles 38 are<br>
displaced in the molding channels of the remaining molding plates until<br>
their root region 37, and optionally an adjoining longitudinal section,<br>
project past the injection-side molding plate 5 or into the mold cavity<br>
36 of the further injection mold 35 and are injected with a molten<br>
polymer mass to form a bristle support or a brush body.<br>
Figs. 46 and 47 show an embodiment with which, after production of<br>
the bristles 38 as described with reference to Figs. 44 and 45, instead of<br>
the flat thrust plate 39, a thrust plate 40, which has cam-like<br>
projections 41 and 42 of different heights, is moved in front of the<br>
released bristle ends. When the thrust plate 40 has been moved<br>
towards the molding plates 4, the bristles are displaced along the thrust<br>
path to different depths within the molding channels so that their root<br>
region 37 projects into the mold cavity 36 of the injection mold 35 to<br>
different depths and the bristle ends lie on a curved envelope surface<br>
after injection and removal of the thrust plate 40 and molding plates 4<br>
and 5.<br>
Figs. 48 and 49 show an embodiment which differs from that of Figs. 44<br>
and 45 only in that the bristles 38 are interconnected in the region of<br>
the injection-side molding plate 5 via a connection 43 in the form of<br>
bars, grids or the like and project with the connection 43 and the<br>
subsequent longitudinal sections of the bristles 38 into the cavity 36 of<br>
the injection mold 35 after displacement via the thrust plate 39.<br>
A smaller group of molding plates 4, preferably including the injection-<br>
side molding plate 5 and with at least one molding plate 4 which can be<br>
transversely displaced to act as clamping means, may serve as<br>
transport holder for transferring the bristles into further injection<br>
molding stations, processing stations or the like.<br>
The layered structure of the injection mold from a plurality of molding<br>
plates and the thereby possible sectional removal from the mold and<br>
the increase in the modulus of elasticity and tensile strength obtained<br>
by the inventive method parameters of injection pressure and flow<br>
speed in the molding channel permit production of bristles whose<br>
central axis is not in the direction of release from the mold. Figs. 50 and<br>
51 show examples thereof. Fig. 50 shows a part of an injection mold<br>
with slanting molding channels 44, 45 that are inclined towards each<br>
other in this embodiment. In addition to or alternatively, the injection<br>
mold 1 may have wavy, curved molding channels 46 or molding<br>
channels 47 with several bends so that correspondingly formed bristles<br>
are produced which can be injected in a composite action via a<br>
connection 48. For release from the mold, the molding plates 4 and 6<br>
are removed, starting with molding plate 6, and the bristles are<br>
released in sections without being deformed due to their high bending<br>
elasticity and the small release length.<br>
The bristles may be fabricated into a brush after separation of the<br>
connection, individually or in groups or together with the connection 48<br>
through injection around it or through other conventional thermal or<br>
mechanical connection methods.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 51, the injection mold 1 has layered molding<br>
plates 4 and two end molding plates 49, 50 that form distinctively<br>
branched bristle ends. The injection-molded bristles 51 each have<br>
finger-like bristle ends 52 which can be easily removed from the mold<br>
due to the thin molding plates and the increased stability of the bristles.<br>
The molding plates 6 or 49, 50 which form the bristle ends can be made<br>
from a sintered metal, in particular, for distinctly branched bristle ends<br>
which also provides additional venting in this region to effectively<br>
prevent trapping of air. The molding plates 4 can, of course, also be<br>
made from such sintered metals to support venting of the molding<br>
channels. Micro-roughness which exists e.g. in sintered metals or which<br>
can be produced through surface treatment of the molding channel<br>
produce corresponding roughness in the micro region on the surface of<br>
the finished bristle which have a moisture repellant "Lotus" effect during<br>
use of the bristle.<br>
