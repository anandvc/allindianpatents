				<td>FUSED THIAZOLE DERIVATIVES AS KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to a class of fused thiazole derivatives, and to their use in therapy. More particularly, the invention provides a family of 6,7-dihydro-[l,3]thiazolo[5,4-c]pyridin-4(5H)-one derivatives, which are substituted in the 2-position by a substituted morpholin-4-yl moiety. These compounds are selective inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) enzymes, and are accordingly of benefit as pharmaceutical agents, especially in the treatment of adverse inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic, oncological, nociceptive and ophthalmic conditions.<br>
The PI3K pathway is implicated in a variety of physiological and pathological functions that are believed to be operative in a range of human diseases. Thus, PI3Ks provide a critical signal for cell proliferation, cell survival, membrane trafficking, glucose transport, neurite outgrowth, membrane ruffling, superoxide production, actin reorganization and chemotaxis (cf. S. Ward et al., Chemistry &amp; Biology, 2003,10,207-213; and S.G. Ward &amp; P. Finan, Current Opinion in Pharmacology, 2003,3,426-434); and are known to be involved in the pathology of cancer, and metabolic, inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases (cf. M.P. Wymann et al., Trends in Pharmacol. Sci., 2003,24, 366-376). Aberrant upregulation of the PI3K pathway is implicated in a wide variety of human cancers (cf. S. Brader &amp; S.A. Eccles, Tumori, 2004,90,2-8).<br>
The compounds in accordance with the present invention, being potent and selective P13K inhibitors, are therefore beneficial in the treatment and/or prevention of various human ailments. These include autoimmune and inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis and transplant rejection; cardiovascular disorders including thrombosis, cardiac hypertrophy, hypertension, and irregular contractility of the heart (e.g. during heart failure); neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, spinal cord injury, head trauma and seizures; metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes; oncological conditions including leukaemia, glioblastoma, lymphoma, melanoma, and human cancers of the liver, bone, skin, brain, pancreas, lung, breast, stomach, colon, rectum, prostate, ovary and cervix; pain and nociceptive disorders; and ophthalmic disorders including age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).<br>
In addition, the compounds in accordance with the present invention may be beneficial as pharmacological standards for use in the development of new biological tests and in the search for new pharmacological agents. Thus, the compounds of this invention may be useful as radioligands in assays for detecting compounds capable of binding to human PI3K enzymes.<br>
WO 2006/114606 describes fused bicyclic thiazole derivatives as selective inhibitors of PI3 kinase enzymes which are accordingly of benefit in medicine, for example in the treatment of inflammatory, autoimmune, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, metabolic, oncological, nociceptive and ophthalmic conditions.<br>
Various fused thiazole derivatives are disclosed in Liebigs Annalen der Chemie, 1986, 780-784; and in Russian Journal of General Chemistry (translation of Zhurnal Obshchei Khimii), 2000, 70[5], 784-787. However, none of the compounds disclosed in either of those publications corresponds to a compound of the present invention; and no therapeutic utility is ascribed to any of the compounds disclosed therein.<br>
The compounds in accordance with the present invention are potent and selective PI3K inhibitors having a binding affinity (IC50) for the human PBKα and/or PI3Kß and/or POKy and/or PI3KS isoform of 50 µM or less, generally of 20 µM or less, usually of 5 µM or less, typically of 1 µM or less, suitably of 500 nM or less, ideally of 100 nM or less, and preferably of 20 nM or less (the skilled person will appreciate that a lower IC50 figure denotes a more active compound). The compounds of the invention may possess at least a 10-fold selective affinity, typically at least a 20-fold selective affinity, suitably at least a 50-fold selective affinity, and ideally at least a 100-fold selective affinity, for the human PDKα and/or PDKß and/or PI3Ky and/or PI3Kδ isoform relative to other human kinases.<br>
The compounds of the invention possess notable advantages in terms of their high potency and selectivity, demonstrable efficacy, and valuable pharmacokinetic properties (including clearance and bioavailability).<br>

Where they are not commercially available, the starting materials of formula (III), (V), (VI), (VIII) and (IX) may be prepared by methods analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples, or by standard methods well known from the art.<br>
It will be understood that any compound of formula (I) initially obtained from any of the above processes may, where appropriate, subsequently be elaborated into a further compound of formula (I) by techniques known from the art. By way of example, a compound of formula (I) wherein R23 represents C2-6 alkoxycarbonyl, e.g. methoxy-carbonyl, may be converted into the corresponding compound wherein R23 represents carboxy (-CO2H) under standard saponification conditions, e.g. by treatment with a base such as lithium hydroxide. A compound of formula (I) wherein R   represents carboxy (-CO2H) may be converted into the corresponding compound wherein R   contains an<br>
amido group, e.g. methylaminocarbonyl, 2-hydroxyethylaminocarbonyl, dimethlaminocarbonyl,N-(cyanomethyl)-N-methylaminocarbonyl,N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methylaminocarbonyl,N-(2-methoxyethyl)-N-methylaminocarbonyl, benzylamino-carbonyl, azetidin-1-ylcarbonyl, pyrrolidin-1-ylcarbonyl, piperidin-1-ylcarbonyl, 4-methylpiperazin-1-ylcarbonyl or morpholin-4-ylcarbonyl, by a two-stage procedure which comprises (i) treatment of the carboxy derivative with pentafluorophenol in the presence of a condensing agent such as l-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide; and (ii) reaction of the pentafluorophenyl ester thereby obtained with the appropriate amine, e.g. methylamine, 2-hydroxyethylamine, dimethylamine, N-(cyanomethyl)-N-methylamine, N-(2-hydroxyethyl)-N-methylamine, N-(2-methoxyethyl)-N-methylamine, benzylamine, azetidine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, 1-methylpiperazine or morpholine.<br>
Where a mixture of products is obtained from any of the processes described above for the preparation of compounds according to the invention, the desired product can be separated therefrom at an appropriate stage by conventional methods such as preparative HPLC; or column chromatography utilising, for example, silica and/or alumina in conjunction with an appropriate solvent system.<br>
Where the above-described processes for the preparation of the compounds according to the invention give rise to mixtures of stereoisomers, these isomers may be separated by conventional techniques. In particular, where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound of formula (I) this may be produced from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives, e.g. salts, may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers of formula (I), e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound, e.g. a chiral base. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallisation, and the desired enantiomer recovered, e.g. by treatment with an acid in the instance where the diastereomer is a salt. In another resolution process a racemate of formula (I) may be separated using chiral HPLC. Moreover, if desired, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described above. Alternatively, a particular enantiomer may be obtained by performing an enantiomer-specific enzymatic biotransformation, e.g. an ester hydrolysis using an esterase, and then purifying only the enantiomerically pure hydrolysed acid from the unreacted ester antipode. Chromatography, recrystallisation and other conventional separation procedures may also<br>
 <br>
be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular geometric isomer of the invention.<br>
During any of the above synthetic sequences it may be necessary and/or desirable to protect sensitive or reactive groups on any of the molecules concerned. This may be achieved by means of conventional protecting groups, such as those described in Protective Groups in Organic Chemistry, ed. J.F.W. McOmie, Plenum Press, 1973; and T.W. Greene &amp; P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 3rd edition, 1999. The protecting groups may be removed at any convenient subsequent stage utilising methods known from the art.<br>

Enzyme Inhibition Assays<br>
Measurement of the ability of compounds to inhibit the lipid kinase activity of the four class 1 PI3 kinase isoforms (α,ß, and δ) was performed using a commercially available homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence assay as described by Gray et al., Anal. Biochem., 2003,313,234-245, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate). All assays were performed at 2 µM ATP and a concentration of purified class 1 PI3 kinase known to generate product within the linear range of the assay. Dilutions of inhibitor in DMSO were added to the assay and compared with assays run in the presence of 2% (v/v) DMSO alone (100% activity). The concentration of inhibitor required to inhibit the enzyme activity by 50% is quoted as the IC50.<br>
When tested in the above assay, the compounds of the accompanying Examples were all found to possess IC50 values for inhibition of activity of human PI3Kα and/or PDKß and/or PDK and/or PI3Kδ of 50 µM or better.<br>
