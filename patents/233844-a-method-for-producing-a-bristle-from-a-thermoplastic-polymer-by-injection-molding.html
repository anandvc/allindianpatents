				<td>Method and Device for Producing Bristles<br>
The invention concerns a method for producing a bristle from a<br>
thermoplastic polymer through injection molding, wherein the molten<br>
polymer mass is injected under pressure into a bristle-molding channel of<br>
predetermined length having a predetermined cross-sectional shape along<br>
this length and the channel is vented during injection molding. The<br>
invention also concerns a device for carrying out this method.<br>
Animal hair and natural fibers which were previously used as bristle<br>
material for producing brushes, paint brushes or the like have been<br>
substantially replaced by artificial bristles, wherein the production of the<br>
bristle material is based largely on long-standing technology related to the<br>
production of synthetic textile fibers, i.e. extrusion or spinning processes.<br>
However, a bristle is subjected to completely different conditions than an<br>
endless fiber in a fiber composite. It is free and fixed at only one end and<br>
can be regarded in terms of stability as a bar which bends and which is<br>
fixed at one end. Pressure or compression forces and sometimes also<br>
tensile forces occur during use. Compared to endless fibers, the<br>
production requirements are different with regard to bending strength,<br>
fatigue strength under reversed bending stresses, buckling resistance and<br>
bend recovery.<br>
Monofilaments for bristles are therefore extruded having relatively large<br>
diameters up to a few millimeters. Shaping by the extrusion and spinning<br>
nozzle produces a certain longitudinal orientation of the molecules in the<br>
molten polymer mass which is however not sufficient to provide the<br>
monofilament with the desired properties. The monofilament is therefore<br>
drawn, i.e. stretched under appropriate drawing forces, which usually<br>
requires pre-drawing, post-drawing, and subsequently thermal<br>
stabilization, which can be repeated, if required. The endless<br>
monofilament is subsequently wound up and the wound-up product is<br>
again stabilized, if required.<br>
If, for production of brushes, the endless monofilaments are not processed<br>
directly from the spool - which is still the exception today - a large<br>
number of monofilaments are combined into strands and bound and cut to<br>
suitable lengths of between 60 and 120cm. The strand material is again<br>
cut to a length, which is slightly longer than the final bristles thereby<br>
producing waste of approximately 30% of the initial material. For high-<br>
quality plastic bristles, e.g. of polyamides (nylon), which are required for<br>
quality brushes, e.g. toothbrushes, hygiene brushes etc., the price for the<br>
raw material is the most expensive factor in the brush price. The price of<br>
extruded bristles is consequently considerably increased by the large<br>
amount of waste.<br>
For brushes, the production of bristles is followed by mounting the bristles<br>
to the bristle support, which can be effected either mechanically or<br>
thermally. Since the free length of the bristles largely varies in this<br>
intermediate state, shearing-off and in most cases post-processing of the<br>
bristles and mainly of the bristle ends follows to remove the sharp cutting<br>
edges. If the effective brushing surface formed by the free ends must<br>
meet special requirements, e.g. for toothbrushes, the brushing surface<br>
must either be given a contour already during mounting or the flat<br>
brushing surface must be subsequently shaped, which produces additional<br>
waste of approximately 10%.<br>
Considering the fact that approximately 90% of the worldwide need of<br>
bristles is limited to bristles having a length of 
production through spinning including all subsequent work processes until<br>
the bristle is finished is highly uneconomical, due to the raw material<br>
waste alone. Further limitations result from the fact that monofilaments<br>
can usually only be produced with cylindrical shape and with profiled<br>
cross-section such that the structure of the bristles is limited and<br>
extensive later processing may be required.<br>
Injection molding production of brush bodies, brush handles, paint brush<br>
handles etc. from plastic material was established quite early in the brush<br>
and paint brush industry to utilize the numerous structural possibilities of<br>
injection molding technology. Various attempts were made to produce the<br>
brush body with integral bristles through injection molding. In practice,<br>
these methods are used only for bristles of the lowest quality and stability<br>
requirements, in particular those which are used only once or a few times.<br>
Injected bristles have a much worse bending strength, fatigue strength<br>
under reversed bending stresses and buckling strength, insufficient bend<br>
recovery and low wear resistance. Injected brushes have highly conical<br>
bristles with relatively large cross-sections in the root region of the bristle<br>
due to the method, and are therefore more appropriately described as<br>
pins or bolts rather than bristles. Some known injection molding methods<br>
in brush technology are described below.<br>
Rotating bristles for grinding and polishing surfaces are composed of disc-<br>
shaped brush segments, which are produced individually through injection<br>
molding (US 5,903,951). Each brush segment comprises a central support<br>
disc from which the bristles outwardly extend radially or at an angle<br>
inclined against the direction of rotation, relative to the radial direction.<br>
The brush segments consist of a thermoplastic or thermoelastic polymer<br>
(TP or TPE), which is filled with abrasive particles. The bristles preferably<br>
have a length of between 1cm and 5cm and a diameter of between<br>
0.25mm and 10mm, preferably between 1mm and 2mm. In one concrete<br>
embodiment, the conical bristles have a length of 75mm and a diameter<br>
of 2mm at the root and 1.5mm at the tip. The two-part injection mold<br>
consists of two plates having the cavities for the support disc and the<br>
bristles on mutually facing sides, which simultaneously form the mold-<br>
separating plane. The molten polymer mass with the admixed abrasive<br>
particles is injected from the center of the support disc at an injection<br>
pressure of 690 to 6900 kPa (0,59 to 69 bar). The preferred pressure<br>
range is between 2070 to 4830 kPa. The required venting of the mold<br>
cavity occurs in the mold-separating plane, i.e. parallel to the bristles.<br>
This unavoidably produces two mold-separating seams on the bristle<br>
jacket, which extend from the root to beyond the tip. The abrasive<br>
particles cause additional narrowing of the small cross-sections in the<br>
bristle cavities and the molten polymer mass solidifies too quickly at these<br>
locations prior to complete filling of the bristle cavity. For this reason,<br>
injection molding is preferred in two steps, wherein a highly filled molten<br>
polymer mass is initially injected into the bristle cavities and a more or<br>
less unfilled molten polymer mass is then subsequently injected. One of<br>
average skill in the art knows that during injection molding, practically no<br>
molecular orientation takes place in the polymer (US 2001/0007161 A1,<br>
see column 1, paragraph 0006). This produces a completely insufficient<br>
bending behavior for bristles, which is additionally deteriorated by the<br>
admixed abrasive particles. The stated maximum injection pressure of<br>
6900 kPa (69 bar) is strongly reduced through the flow resistance in the<br>
narrow mold cavity for forming the carrier disc and in the subsequent<br>
bristle channels such that the person skilled in the art may have<br>
reasonable doubts about the practicability of this method.<br>
US 3,618,154 describes the production of a toothbrush in one single<br>
injection molding process wherein the bristles on the brush head are<br>
injected in a type of bundle arrangement. Towards this end, the two-part<br>
injection molding tool whose mold-separating plane is in the plane of the<br>
bristle head, has substantially cylindrical bores which extend from the<br>
moid surface forming the bristle side of the brush head. Substantially<br>
cylindrical mold cores engage in the bores from the opposite side wherein<br>
one of their end faces forms part of the mold surface for the bristle<br>
support side of the head and - starting therefrom - comprise groove-like<br>
depressions which extend along jacket lines. These groove-like<br>
depressions taper uniformly and conically from the front-side mold surface<br>
towards the other end and terminate in a semi-spherical dome on the<br>
jacket of the mold core on which the depressions are uniformly<br>
distributed. Each depression forms, together with the bore wall in the one<br>
part of the injection mold, a bristle-molding channel, which consequently<br>
conically tapers from the mold cavity for the brush head towards the other<br>
end. The channels are vented across their entire length in the separating<br>
surface between mold core and bore, i.e. substantially parallel to the<br>
bristles. US 3,618,154 requires high precision of the cooperating surfaces.<br>
Each bristle inevitably has two mold-separating seams, which extend<br>
along jacket lines on the bristle. It is also not possible to produce bristles<br>
with circular cross-section since the groove-like depression in the mold<br>
core has a substantially larger radius of curvature than the bore. This<br>
produces a cross-sectional shape with discontinuities at which the mold-<br>
separating seams, which cannot be subsequently removed, immediately<br>
form. The bending behavior of the bristle differs in different directions<br>
transverse to its axis. Furthermore, the bundles are not filled (their center<br>
is free) so that the bristles cannot support each other as is the case in<br>
conventional bundles. The serious problem of removing the individual<br>
bristles from the mold is intended to be solved through corresponding<br>
conicity of the bristle-forming grooves. This can obviously not work, since<br>
the mold cores are simultaneously used as ejector pins which push<br>
towards the bristle tips during release from the mold via the dome-shaped<br>
ends of the groove-like depressions. The conicity is intended to make the<br>
bristle ends relatively flexible during use of the toothbrush. This document<br>
does not describe any measures which extend beyond conventional<br>
injection molding technology and which could improve the bending<br>
behavior of the injection-molded bristles. In this case as well, the polymer<br>
molecules, as is usual in injection molding, have the energetically<br>
favorable balled shape, which is, however, unfavorable with regard to<br>
stability (US 2001/0007161 A1).<br>
Moreover, in conventional toothbrush production (US 5,158,342) the<br>
bristle stock is subsequently injected into a prepared depression of the<br>
brush head of a pre-injected brush body, consisting of handle and the<br>
brush head. This produces bristles of completely insufficient bending<br>
behavior due to the conventional injection molding technology with<br>
injection pressures of 30 to 60 bar (3000 to 6000 kPa).<br>
GB 2 151 971 also describes two-step production of bristle stock and a<br>
bristle support. In particular, this document clearly illustrates the problem<br>
of releasing the bristles from the bristle-molding channels. Despite the<br>
strong conicity of the bristles, which is favorable for release from the<br>
mold, the mold removal process is slow and highly controlled, which<br>
impairs the efficiency of the injection molding system. Injection molding<br>
measures to increase the bristle stability are not described.<br>
Much better results are obtained according to an older, not pre-published<br>
patent application of the inventor (PCT/EP01/07439) with which a bristle<br>
support is provided with bores which have a nozzle-like cross-sectional<br>
shape. The molten polymer mass for the bristles is injected through the<br>
nozzle-like bores into adjoining molding, channels of an injection mold.<br>
This method produces a semi-finished product from bristle support and<br>
bristles or also - with corresponding shape of the bristle support - a<br>
finished brush, wherein the bristles have bending behavior characteristics,<br>
which are similar in quality to those of extruded, bristles. The shape of the<br>
bristles is not subjected to the constraints of endless production of<br>
extruded monofilaments.<br>
US 4,712,936 discloses production of small application brushes, e.g. for<br>
decorative cosmetics, which are inserted into a container and mounted to<br>
the sealing cap of this container, as one-part injection molding part which<br>
consists of cap, a stem centrically adjoining the inner side thereof, and<br>
brush bristles disposed at the end thereof. The mold cavities for the cap,<br>
the centrical stem and the joining bristle-molding channels are formed in<br>
the two parts of an injection molding tool with axial orientation, wherein<br>
the cap opening is in the mold separating plane thereof. The stem and<br>
bristles are produced through mold cores, which are pushed coaxially into<br>
each other. The injection side is on the cap. The molten polymer mass<br>
must consequently traverse long flow paths with several cross-sectional<br>
changes and overcome large mass requirements before reaching the thin<br>
bristle channels. The entire venting of the stem and bristle region takes<br>
place at the ends of the bristle channels via a cylindrical closure with knurl<br>
structure which is to form a type of filter with high flow resistance. This<br>
prior art shows that the bristles that can be produced through injection<br>
molding are not suitable, in particular, for use as paintbrushes. After<br>
removal from the mold, they are therefore re-heated outside of the<br>
injection mold and are subsequently drawn. The cross-section is thereby<br>
reduced which inevitably increases the separation between the bristles.<br>
However, for application brushes of this type, the bristles should be<br>
disposed at minimum mutual separations to produce capillary action<br>
between the bristles for storing and retaining the application medium.<br>
Attempts have also been made (DE 21 55 888 C3) to produce a brush<br>
with formed-on bristles through injection molding with an injection<br>
molding tool having a first tool part for the bristle support and a second<br>
tool part largely covering the open mold cavity in which a short channel is<br>
formed which widens at its opposite end and is closed at that location.<br>
During injection, the molten polymer mass penetrates from the mold<br>
cavity of the support into the short channel and flows into the widening to<br>
produce a short bolt with a head. During opening of the mold, the head is<br>
carried along and the bolt-like bristle blank is drawn. This can produce a<br>
certain molecular orientation, which increases the stability - similar to<br>
production of endless monofilaments.<br>
Attempts to replace production of bristles from extruded endless<br>
monofilaments and their subsequent mounting to separately produced<br>
brush bodies, with an injection molding of the entire brush with bristles<br>
have therefore obviously failed (US 2001/0007161 Al).<br>
This is also true for the known suggestion of only producing the bristle<br>
through injection molding (US 3,256,545). This closest prior art is based<br>
on the realization that extruded bristles have ends of increased flexibility<br>
imparted to them by post-processing of the bristle ends as do bristles<br>
obtained through injection molding of one-piece brushes in consequence<br>
of the conicity required for injection molding, which have however<br>
disadvantageous effects with regard to wear resistance and durability.<br>
This patent method suggests improving the wear resistance, which<br>
decreases towards the ends, by enlarging the cross-section of the injected<br>
bristle, going from the end on the mounting side (the injection side bristle<br>
root) towards the free end. The cross-sectional shape may increase<br>
continuously or discontinuously. In any event, a larger amount of plastic<br>
material is present in the region of the working ends of the bristles than<br>
on the mounting side end. The insufficient properties of known conical<br>
bristles are compensated for through accumulation of a larger plastic mass<br>
in the region of the bristle ends. However, one has thereby overlooked the<br>
fact that, as the plastic mass or cross-section increases, the proportion of<br>
the energetically favorable balled structure increases, i.e. the bristle<br>
excessively looses bending elasticity due to the enlarged cross-section.<br>
This injection molding method proposes injection pressures of between<br>
800 and 1200 bar (approximately 0.8105 to 1.2-105 kPa), which are<br>
required to introduce the molten polymer mass through the channels,<br>
which are initially narrower on the injection side, into the extended<br>
channels such that they fill the mold. Despite the relatively high pressure,<br>
the recommended bristle diameters of unoriented molecular structures are<br>
between 1.6 and 2.2mm in the region of the thinner cross-section and<br>
between 11 and 12mm in the region of the thicker cross-section (column<br>
5, lines 43 to 48 and column , lines 32 to 42). Support structures of the<br>
same molten polymer mass are formed on the injection side of the<br>
bristles, for mounting the injection-molded bristles to a bristle support,<br>
and interconnect several bristles, if required.<br>
The technical literature also teaches (Ehrenstein: Eingenverstarkung von<br>
Thermoplasten im Schmelze-DeformationsprozeB in the German magazine<br>
"Die Angewandte Makromolekulare Chemie" 175 (1990), pages 187 to<br>
203) that for polyamides, only 3% and 6% and for polyethylene only 33%<br>
and 5.5% of the theoretical mechanical values for the modulus of<br>
elasticity [N/mm2] and tensile strength [N/mm2] respectively are obtained<br>
through extrusion and injection molding methods, wherein for injection-<br>
molded components, the tension-free state (molecular balled structure) is<br>
preferred.<br>
It is the underlying object of the invention to produce bristles through<br>
injecting molding whose bending behavior and bend recovery is superior<br>
to that of extruded bristles, and which permits maximum attainment of<br>
the theoretical values of the modulus of elasticity and tensile strength to<br>
produce bristles of high quality through a large length range with<br>
relatively small cross-sections for simplified production of bristle<br>
geometries and bristle arrangements adjusted to the requirements of the<br>
final product such as brushes or paint brushes. The invention also<br>
concerns a device, which is suitable for carrying out the method.<br>
Departing from the known injection molding method, wherein the molten<br>
polymer mass is injected under pressure into a bristle-molding channel of<br>
predetermined length and predetermined cross-sectional shape along this<br>
length, and the channel is vented during injection molding, this object is<br>
achieved in that the magnitude of the injection pressure is adjusted in<br>
dependence on the cross-sectional shape of the bristle-molding channel<br>
such that a shear flow of the molten polymer mass is generated with high<br>
core speed in the center of the molten polymer mass flow and large<br>
shearing effect due to wall friction under distinct longitudinal orientation of<br>
the polymer molecules, at least in the region of the molten polymer mass<br>
close to the wall, which is maintained along the channel, wherein the<br>
channel is simultaneously vented along its length to support maintenance<br>
of the shear flow.<br>
The invention is based on the realization that the bending behavior of a<br>
monofilament can be primarily increased through generation and<br>
maintenance of a molecular orientation which has previously not been<br>
realized in injection molding of bristles, brushes and paint brushes. The<br>
molecular structure in a molten polymer mass flow can only be<br>
substantially influenced using sufficiently narrow cross-sections and melt<br>
flow forced to a speed profile having strong shearing effects to deform and<br>
stretch the energetically most favorable tension-free balled structure. For<br>
this reason, in accordance with the invention, the injection pressure is set<br>
to a sufficiently high level that a steep flow profile forms in the bristle-<br>
molding channels which is characterized by a high core speed in the<br>
center of the flow and large shearing effect in its edge region due to the<br>
wall friction of the molten polymer mass on the channel wall, wherein the<br>
shearing forces due to wall friction are larger the higher the speed<br>
difference between neighboring flow layers. A flow profile of this type with<br>
high core speed moreover ensures perfect filling of the mold of the bristle-<br>
molding channel even for the narrowest of cross-sections (small bristle<br>
diameter) and large channel length (bristle length).<br>
The speed profile can be set in dependence on the predetermined cross-<br>
sectional shape along the length of the bristle-molding channel through a<br>
correspondingly high, optionally variable injection pressure. The polymer<br>
molecules are thereby oriented longitudinally close to the channel wall<br>
and, to a reduced degree, within the entire melt flow, wherein the<br>
magnitude of the core speed moreover prevents premature solidification<br>
of the molten mass, even for small cross-sections and large lengths.<br>
High pressure alone is not sufficient for rapid filling of a narrow molding<br>
channel. In accordance with the invention, the channel is vented along its<br>
length such that the shear flow with high flow speed is maintained up to<br>
the end of the channel and the desired longitudinal orientation of the<br>
molecules reaches the bristle tip.<br>
Practical tests have shown that the injection pressure should be at least<br>
500 bar (0.5105 kPa) and is a function of the cross-sectional dependence<br>
of the bristle-molding channel. For the quality bristles under discussion<br>
having an average bristle diameter of e.g. 0.3 (measured at half the<br>
length) and a corresponding cross-section of the bristle-molding channel<br>
and with a length of 10.5mm, the desired speed profile can be produced<br>
with an injection pressure of at least 500 (0.5105 kPa). Approximately 2/3<br>
of the above-mentioned injection pressure can usually be converted into<br>
specific pressure in the bristle-molding channel such that the molten<br>
polymer mass in the channel should have a pressure &gt; 300 bar (0.3105<br>
kPa).<br>
During solidification below the crystal melt temperature, thermoplastic<br>
materials form crystallites, which influence the modulus of elasticity (E<br>
module) and the tensile strength (tearing strength) in dependence on<br>
their shape and configuration. The formation of needle crystals has a<br>
positive influence on stiffness through increase of the E modulus and<br>
strength due to an increase of the tensile strength and initially requires<br>
linked elongated crystal seed formation on parallel molecular sections.<br>
This seed formation can be amplified compared to isothermal<br>
crystallization through the introduction of forces as given i.a. in flow<br>
processes. The inventive high injection pressure and the high flow velocity<br>
of the molten polymer mass in the bristle-molding channel obtained<br>
thereby therefore not only promote longitudinal molecular orientation but<br>
also crystal formation, wherein the high pressure simultaneously increases<br>
the packed density of the crystals through increased loading. The partial<br>
crystallization of the molecularly oriented molten mass increases the<br>
relaxation time, i.e. the molecular orientation lasts for a longer period.<br>
The above-described effects are further supported in a supplement to the<br>
invention in which the bristle-molding channel is cooled.<br>
The narrower the cross-section and the larger the length of the bristle-<br>
molding channel, the more reasonable it is to keep the channel walls<br>
warm to maintain the viscosity of the molten polymer mass and obtain<br>
complete filling of the mold. When setting the inventive method<br>
parameters, the filling of the mold is also guaranteed when the bristle-<br>
molding channel is cooled. Cooling of the channel and associated<br>
introduction of forces additionally promote formation of crystals and<br>
increase relaxation time. The stabilizing outer layer of the bristle, which is<br>
produced on the channel wall, permits increase of the post-pressure,<br>
which is common in injection molding. The higher the post-pressure, the<br>
stronger the crystal seed formation in the still molten bristle core. The<br>
pressure simultaneously increases the melting temperature and enhances<br>
cooling of the molten mass for a given mass temperature, thereby further<br>
producing a positive effect on the crystal growth speed and impeding<br>
relaxation of the molecules.<br>
The high injection pressure and high flow velocity require particular or<br>
additional measures for rapid and effective venting to ensure complete<br>
mold filling and to prevent cavities in the molding channel or air inclusions<br>
in the molten mass. In the conventional injection molding methods, the<br>
bristle-molding channel is vented when the cavity is completely closed at<br>
the end of the channel or, for a longitudinally split injection mold defining<br>
the channel, in two planes parallel to the bristles. In the first case, for<br>
forming a perfect, preferably rounded bristle end, the venting must be<br>
drastically reduced to prevent molten polymer mass from getting into the<br>
venting regions. For venting parallel to the bristles, the mold-separating<br>
plane lies in the flow direction with the consequence that the molten<br>
polymer mass penetrates into even the most narrow of venting gaps and<br>
produces mold-separating seams along the bristle jacket.<br>
The invention therefore proposes venting of the bristle-molding channel<br>
transverse to the flow direction of the molten polymer mass, wherein the<br>
venting is preferably effected in several planes transverse to the flow<br>
direction of the molten polymer mass. The number of venting planes is<br>
higher, the longer the bristle-molding channel such that, for<br>
predetermined channel length, the venting is controlled in dependence on<br>
the speed of the molten mass front. Since venting is possible in such a<br>
plane about the entire periphery of the bristle channel, there is a<br>
corresponding gap length transverse to the flow direction which is larger<br>
than that of a bristle-parallel mold-separating plane and which can be<br>
implemented over a plurality of planes.<br>
The venting planes can be provided at equal separations along the length<br>
of the bristle-molding channel in dependence on the volume to be vented,<br>
optionally with progressive or degressive separation in the flow direction<br>
of the molten polymer mass. This permits simultaneous maintenance of a<br>
sufficiently high counter pressure in the channel to obtain uniform filling of<br>
the mold.<br>
The bristle-molding channel can be vented merely through displacement<br>
of air through the flow pressure of the molten polymer mass. However,<br>
venting can also be supported by external underpressure.<br>
The inventive method permits injection of the molten polymer mass into a<br>
bristle-molding channel from the injection side with a cross-section, which<br>
is substantially uniform to produce a substantially cylindrical bristle, which<br>
could not be produced with previous injection molding technology for<br>
bristles and brushes.<br>
The cross-section may substantially continuously taper from the injection<br>
side to produce a bristle with preferably only weak conicity, which is<br>
desired for many applications to increase the bending elasticity from the<br>
bristle root to the bristle end. Such conicity promotes maintenance or<br>
even reinforces a steep velocity profile with high core speed and shearing<br>
effect in the edge region which increases along the length such that,<br>
despite increased flow resistance, the molecular orientation and crystal<br>
formation is enhanced towards the bristle end.<br>
Injection molding produces precisely sized bristles with a tolerance of ±3%<br>
in cross-section and in length while extruded bristles with the same<br>
constructive parameters have tolerances of ±10%. The initially circular<br>
cross-section of extruded bristles is ovalized through processing which is<br>
unnecessary for the bristles produced according to the present invention.<br>
Injection molding technology usually regards mold removal slopes of a few<br>
degrees (&gt;1.00°) as necessary to be able to properly remove the<br>
injection-molded part. Mold removal is usually supported by ejectors.<br>
When the bristles are injection-molded in accordance with the above-<br>
mentioned prior art, the mold slope must be considerably larger to<br>
prevent tearing off of the bristle during removal from the mold (US 3 256<br>
545). This is one reason why prior art uses injection-molding tools, which<br>
have a bristle-parallel mold-separating plane, thereby accepting the<br>
above-described disadvantages. The inventive method permits reduction<br>
of the mold slope to a value of 0° with sufficient mold filling. Slender<br>
bristles of great length can be produced with relatively small conicity in<br>
the region of 0.2 to 0.5° when the positive properties of a conical bristle<br>
are desired having a bending angle which increases towards the bristle<br>
end. Mold removal is simplified by crystal formation promoted by the<br>
longitudinal orientation and the associated increase in the tensile strength<br>
(tear resistance) of the bristle, in particular in the region close to the wall,<br>
which is important for removal from the mold. Further measures for<br>
facilitating removal from the mold are described in connection with the<br>
device.<br>
In a further embodiment of the inventive method, the molten polymer<br>
mass is injected into an inlet region which narrows like a nozzle towards<br>
the bristle-molding channel for generating an extension flow to produce a<br>
bristle with a widened root region which optionally tapers continuously<br>
towards the actual bristle.<br>
Such narrowing generates an extension flow, which produces considerable<br>
molecular orientation and, due to flow properties, corresponding boosting<br>
of the flow profile after the narrowing. The narrowing is therefore<br>
preferably disposed close to the injection side. It is also possible to<br>
provide narrowings along the length of the bristle-molding channel to<br>
obtain stepped bristles wherein, in this case as well, the narrowings have<br>
positive effects on the molecular structure and crystal formation.<br>
After an optional upstream inlet region, the cross-section of the bristle-<br>
molding channel is preferably selected with a maximum width of 
such that the injection-molded bristle has a corresponding diameter with<br>
an optionally broader root region. Bristles having this cross-section and<br>
broader root region cannot be produced through extrusion or spinning.<br>
The term "largest width" in this connection means that the bristle may<br>
also have a cross-section, which differs from a circular shape, e.g. oval,<br>
wherein the largest width of the length corresponds to the larger axis of<br>
the oval.<br>
In applications of the inventive method, the ratio between the largest<br>
width and the length of the channel may be selected to be 
1:1000, preferably up to 
have a length of between 15mm and 750mm with a maximum diameter of<br>
3mm in or close to the root region. The smaller the largest width, the<br>
shorter the length. For stringent requirements, e.g. for toothbrushes,<br>
application brushes etc. diameters above the root region of 
recommended which permit bristle lengths of more than 60mm in the<br>
inventive method.<br>
The inventive method can be modified in a likewise advantageous fashion<br>
when the molten polymer mass is injected simultaneously into several<br>
neighboring bristle-molding channels thereby forming a corresponding<br>
number of bristles such that a set of bristles can be produced in one<br>
injection process. Minimizing of the separation of the bristle-molding<br>
channels produces bristle arrangements in the form of pucks through<br>
slight compacting of the removed bristles.<br>
The number and arrangement of the bristle-molding channels can be<br>
selected such that the entire bristle stock of a brush or of a paint brush is<br>
produced in one injection process, wherein the separations between the<br>
bristles and their geometrical relationships can be varied in accordance<br>
with the desired arrangement in the bristle stock.<br>
A further embodiment provides that the molten polymer mass is injected<br>
into the neighboring bristle-molding channels thereby simultaneously<br>
forming a connection between at least two bristles, wherein the<br>
connection may serve for further handling of the connected bristles and<br>
also as an aid for connection to a brush body, paint brush handle or the<br>
like. Alternatively, after injection of the bristles from a polymer, a molten<br>
polymer mass of another polymer can be subsequently injected to produce<br>
a connection between the bristles. The connection may be in the form of<br>
bars, grids connecting several bristles, or the like. The use of different<br>
polymers with a joining factor of &gt;20% guarantees sufficiently secure<br>
connection.<br>
The connection may further be designed such that it forms a bristle<br>
support which may simultaneously constitute the brush body or part<br>
thereof or which can be completed into a brush body or paint brush<br>
handle by injecting at least one further molten polymer mass which may<br>
comprise a different thermoplastic or thermoelastic polymer.<br>
In a further variant of the method, several bristles can be injected with<br>
different lengths such that, in combination with the bristle support<br>
connecting them, a complete bristle stock or partial stock can be produced<br>
for a brush or a paint brush, wherein the bristle ends are at different<br>
heights along a flat or non-planar envelope surface so that the finished<br>
brush has optimized bristle end contours.<br>
The bristle group can also be injected with different cross-sections to<br>
permit different effects in predetermined regions of a finished brush.<br>
Likewise, the bristle group can be injected with a cross-sectional shape,<br>
which differs along its length. The bristle group can also be injected in a<br>
mutually non-parallel fashion to produce a bristle stock with differing<br>
bristle orientations.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of the method, bristles having<br>
the same geometry but different bending elasticity (hardness) can be<br>
generated through injection molding of different molten polymer masses<br>
in the same molding channels. For extruded bristles for brushes having<br>
different degrees of hardness (textures) e.g. for toothbrushes having<br>
hardness gradations of soft, medium, hard, the desired degree of<br>
hardness could be influenced only via the diameter of the bristle, i.e.<br>
toothbrushes of the same structure had to prepare and process up to<br>
three different bristle diameters. The inventive method realizes these<br>
degrees of hardness merely through selection of the polymer and<br>
optionally by adjustment of the injection pressure but with identical bristle<br>
diameters.<br>
Bristles can also be injected from a polymer or a polymer mixture, which<br>
have reduced secondary binding forces in the solidified state. These<br>
bristles can be cleaved after production through mechanical forces thereby<br>
forming flags, if necessary only after further processing into brushes or<br>
paintbrushes.<br>
The bristles can be injected from a polymer comprising additives, which<br>
become active during use. The additives may have mechanical, e.g.<br>
abrasive effect or, e.g. for toothbrush bristles, be additives with<br>
protective, therapeutical or remineralizing action. Numerous additives of<br>
this type are known.<br>
The invention also concerns a device for injection-molding bristles from<br>
thermoplastic polymers, comprising a means for producing the injection<br>
pressure and an injection mold which has at least one supply channel for<br>
the molten polymer mass and at least one cavity in the form of a molding<br>
channel with a mold contour which corresponds to the length and cross-<br>
sectional shape of the bristle to be produced, wherein the molding channel<br>
has associated venting means for releasing the air displaced during<br>
injection molding. Devices of this kind are known from the above-<br>
described prior art.<br>
A device of this type is characterized, in accordance with the invention, by<br>
means for generating an injection pressure of preferably at least 500 bar<br>
(0.5-105kPa) and the venting means have venting cross-sections which are<br>
distributed along the length of the molding channel and which are<br>
designed to form, in cooperation with the injection pressure, a shear flow<br>
with high core speed in the center of the molten polymer mass and large<br>
shearing effect on the wall of the molding channel.<br>
Such a device can produce bristles through injection molding as described<br>
in connection with the method. Compared to known injection molding<br>
devices for producing bristles or one-piece brushes with bristles, the<br>
device according to the invention is designed such that the desired flow<br>
dynamics is obtained in the channel forming the bristle.<br>
The means for generating the injection pressure is preferably designed<br>
such that injection pressures of between 500 and 4000 bar (0.5105 to<br>
4-105 kPa) can be set depending on the length and cross-sectional shape<br>
of the molding channel. The pressure is higher, the smaller the cross-<br>
section of the bristle to be produced and the greater its length.<br>
The means for generating the injection pressure and venting cross-<br>
sections on the molding channel are designed with respect to construction<br>
and control such that the molten polymer mass in the molding channel<br>
has a specific pressure of at least 300 bar (0.3-105 kPa) to 1300 bar<br>
(1.3105 kPa). This design is adjusted to the mass flow and flow<br>
resistances to be overcome upstream of the molding channel.<br>
If the injection pressure on the generating means is sufficiently high, the<br>
injection pressure can advantageously be controlled depending on the<br>
length and the cross-sectional shape of the molding channel to permit<br>
injection of injection molds of different geometrical shapes with one<br>
injection-molding unit.<br>
This purpose is supported in that the venting means have venting cross-<br>
sections, which can be controlled depending on the specific pressure.<br>
In the inventive device, the injection mold is advantageously associated<br>
with coolant, which may be external cooling after each injection molding<br>
cycle or after removal from the mold. The molding channel in the injection<br>
mold may have associated cooling means for keeping the molding channel<br>
at a reduced temperature.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the injection mold<br>
consists of several molding plates disposed in layers transverse to the<br>
longitudinal extension of the molding channel, each of which defines a<br>
longitudinal section of the molding channel.<br>
In contrast to prior art with more or less block-shaped injection molds, the<br>
invention provides a structure of stacked molding plates. This structure<br>
permits forming of minimum bore cross-sections with high precision in<br>
each molding plate of low thickness. This and any other production<br>
technology would fail for larger bore depths. This is also a reason why<br>
longitudinally separated injection molds were necessary for the production<br>
of narrow cross-sections. Their disadvantages are described in connection<br>
with prior art. The inventive decomposition of the injection mold into<br>
several plates permits realization of molding channels of large length with<br>
high and reproducible precision over the entire length. The molding plates<br>
which comprise the end of the molding channels and form the bristle end<br>
can have, due to the small thickness of the molding plates, cavities with<br>
only small depth to form a bristle end having clear contours, without any<br>
mold separating seam, and without additional venting means. Oxidation of<br>
the polymer, which can be observed in narrow mold cross-sections<br>
through the so-called diesel effect, does not occur due to the small depth<br>
of the cavity.<br>
The layered structure of the injection mold moreover permits formation of<br>
the venting means on the molding plates, i.e. with a frequency<br>
corresponding to their number. The venting means are preferably formed<br>
between the mutually facing support surfaces of the molding plates e.g.<br>
through narrow gaps or channels. The high flow velocity of the molten<br>
polymer mass perpendicular to such narrow gaps or channels prevents the<br>
molten mass from penetrating into the venting openings, despite the high<br>
pressure. The venting openings may therefore be larger than in a two-<br>
shell mold whose mold-separating plane is in the flow direction of the<br>
molten mass. The venting cross-sections may be formed with a maximum<br>
width of only a few urn up to 300pm.<br>
The venting means are preferably formed completely or partially through<br>
surface roughnesses on the mutually facing surfaces of the molding<br>
plates.<br>
In a further advantageous embodiment, the venting means have venting<br>
cross-sections which increase outwardly from the surface of the molding<br>
channel such that the air can freely escape after passage of the narrowest<br>
point of the venting cross-sections.<br>
The displacement of air caused by the specific pressure in the molding<br>
channel can be supported when the venting means is connected to an<br>
external underpressure source.<br>
The device may be designed such that the molding channel has a cross-<br>
section which is substantially constant along its length or which<br>
substantially uniformly tapers towards its end to produce cylindrical or<br>
slightly conical bristles.<br>
Practical injection tests under the stated method conditions have shown<br>
that the molding channel can taper at an angle 
produce sufficient mold slope for removing a slightly conical bristle, having<br>
excellent bending behavior, from the mold.<br>
The molding channel can have a cross-section, which discontinuously<br>
tapers towards the end to produce specially designed bristle ends as<br>
required by the application for the finished brush.<br>
The largest width of the cross-section of the molding channel is preferably<br>
and paintbrushes.<br>
At least one molding plate can be disposed on the injection side having a<br>
widening which tapers towards the molding channel and can be connected<br>
upstream of the molding plates defining the molding channel having the<br>
above-mentioned largest width at their sides facing the supply channel to<br>
reinforce the cross-section on the bristle root and on the bristle base and<br>
also to obtain, due to this widening, an extensional flow at the inlet region<br>
of the molding channel to support formation of the desired flow dynamics.<br>
The widening can narrow like a trumpet towards the molding channel to<br>
produce a smoothly connecting shoulder at the bristle and to the support<br>
connecting the bristles, brush body or the like. This is particularly<br>
important for hygiene brushes of any type.<br>
The ratio between the largest width of the cross-section of the molding<br>
channel and its length is preferably between 1:5 and 1:250 but may also<br>
be 1:1000 wherein the ratio is closer to the higher value the narrower the<br>
cross-section of the molding channel and closer to the lower value the<br>
larger the narrowest cross-section.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides that the number and<br>
thickness of the molding plates is matched to the length of the molding<br>
channel, wherein the number of the molding plates is inversely<br>
proportional to the ratio between the largest inner diameter of the cross-<br>
section and the length of the molding channel. The number of molding<br>
plates, which belong to an injection mold, can be variable to be able to<br>
produce bristles of varying length with the same mold.<br>
The molding plates preferably have a thickness, which is approximately<br>
three to fifteen times the central diameter of the molding channel. For a<br>
bristle of an average diameter of 0.3mm and a length of 10.5mm, the<br>
molding plates have e.g. a thickness of 1.5mm to 2.00mm. A longitudinal<br>
section of the molding channel of 1.5mm to 2.0mm can be drilled with<br>
high precision into the molding plate.<br>
The molding plates are movable perpendicular to their plate plane,<br>
individually or in groups. This permits, in particular, removal of the bristle<br>
from the mold in a non-conventional fashion, wherein e.g. the molding<br>
plates, starting with the molding plate having the mold contour at the end<br>
of the molding channel and ending with the molding plate facing the<br>
supply channel, can be subsequently removed either individually or in<br>
groups.<br>
The molding plates are reliably kept together under the method-specific<br>
high closing pressure of the injection-molding machine and are not<br>
subjected to any deforming forces, despite their low thickness. Moreover,<br>
the venting openings are kept closed by the closing pressure and, unlike<br>
channels with longitudinal venting, require no additional means to keep<br>
them closed.<br>
Practical tests have shown that the inventive narrow cross-sections and<br>
channel lengths require considerable extraction forces to release the<br>
bristles if e.g. only two molding plates are present. The bristle usually<br>
breaks. Increasing the number of plates and their successive separation<br>
from each other permits damage-free removal of the bristle from the<br>
mold, in particular when the molding plate facing the supply channel is<br>
removed last. During removal from the mold, the edges of the holes of<br>
each molding plate function as drawing nozzles to flatten any "polymer<br>
skin" formed in the mold-separating plane without disadvantageously<br>
effecting the bristle jacket. In any event, the bristle ends are perfectly<br>
formed.<br>
Individual molding plates may be displaceable parallel to the neighboring<br>
molding plates to exert transverse loading on the bristle after injection<br>
molding, thereby optimizing the molecular structure.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment, the injection mold has molding<br>
channels of different length and/or different cross-sectional shape to<br>
obtain e.g. a bristle stock of the desired geometry and configuration in<br>
one injection molding cycle.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment, the injection mold has molding<br>
channels comprising a central axis which extends at an inclined angle<br>
relative to the direction of motion of the molding plates, wherein each<br>
molding plate comprises a longitudinal section of the molding channel with<br>
a length which permits removal from the mold through successive removal<br>
of the individual molding plates, despite the angle variation.<br>
The subdivision of the injection mold into a plurality of molding plates<br>
extending transverse to the molding channel permits subdivision of the<br>
molding channel into longitudinal sections which nevertheless permit<br>
removal of the individual longitudinal sections from the mold without<br>
excessive strain on the bristle or deformation thereof even when the<br>
bristle axis is inclined relative to the direction of motion of the molding<br>
plates (removing direction). In this fashion, bristle groups can be<br>
produced in one single injection mold, wherein the bristles extend parallel<br>
to each other but at an angle relative to a bristle support connecting them<br>
or which have different angle orientations relative to each other.<br>
In accordance with a further embodiment, the injection mold has molding<br>
channels with a central axis which is curved relative to the direction of<br>
motion of the molding plates, wherein each molding plate defines a<br>
longitudinal section of the molding channel which is dimensioned such that<br>
removal form the mold is possible through successive lifting of individual<br>
molding plates in dependence on the curvature.<br>
Wavy bristles can thereby be produced which can also be easily removed<br>
from the mold. It is also possible to simultaneously produce straight, wavy<br>
and curved bristles in one single injection mold.<br>
In a further embodiment, the injection mold has at least one molding<br>
plate which can be displaced in its plane relative to the neighboring<br>
molding plates after injection-molding of the bristles to form, together<br>
with these, a clamping means for all the bristles which acts on the<br>
corresponding portion of the length of the molding channel.<br>
The invention thereby permits use of parts of the injection mold to grasp<br>
the injected bristles and fix them in the injection mold along a portion of<br>
their length e.g. to separate the molding plates close to the ends, in the<br>
removal direction, from the remaining molding plates and to carry along<br>
the bristle blanks such that the bristles are exposed along a middle partial<br>
length, i.e. between these molding plates and the remaining molding<br>
plates. Subsequent displacement of the clamping molding plates and<br>
return of the molding plates close to the end in the direction towards the<br>
injection end of the bristles, causes these ends to project past the molding<br>
plate at the injection side. Through transfer of the injection mold,<br>
optionally under further clamping by the holder, the injection mold can be<br>
connected to another injection molding tool, which has a mold cavity<br>
forming a bristle support or brush body. In a further injection molding<br>
process, the projecting ends are surrounded by a further molten polymer<br>
mass, which fills this mold cavity.<br>
The clamping means may also serve as a transport holder to transfer the<br>
clamped bristles, after removal from the other molding plates, into<br>
another work station for connection to a brush body. This is also possible<br>
when the bristles are already joined via a connection such as e.g. bridges,<br>
grids or bristle supports. The clamping molding plate is then located close<br>
to the transition between bristles and bristle support and the holder is<br>
removed in the removal direction along with the connection and<br>
subsequently transferred, wherein the molding plates which serve as<br>
holders are replaced by an equivalent set of molding plates to again obtain<br>
a complete injection mold. The holder can be a portable holder moving in<br>
a circulating path and be reused after complete removal of the bristles<br>
from the holder to complement: the injection mold. If the connection is not<br>
directly required for the subsequent fabrication steps, e.g. insertion,<br>
gluing, welding, injecting etc. it can also be removed and only the bristles<br>
may be connected to the bristle support or brush body using any<br>
conventional joining technique.<br>
A further embodiment of the invention provides that the injection mold<br>
consists of at least two groups of molding plates comprising clamping<br>
means of which the first group comprises part of the molding channel<br>
including the end and the further groups comprise the remaining part of<br>
the molding channel, wherein the first group can be removed from the<br>
second group and the subsequent groups can be removed from each<br>
other, in temporal sequence. The injection process is divided into a<br>
number of injection molding cycles corresponding to the number of groups<br>
such that, in the closed initial position of the injection mold, the molten<br>
polymer mass is injected in a first injection cycle into the complete<br>
molding channel, whereupon the first group can be removed from the<br>
further groups thereby carrying along the blank via the clamping means,<br>
with the withdrawal path being shorter than the length of the blank.<br>
Subsequently, in a second injection molding cycle, more molten polymer<br>
mass is injected into the released longitudinal section of the molding<br>
channel of the further groups and the steps injection/removal are<br>
repeated until the second to last group is removed from the last group to<br>
produce bristles of a length greater than the length of the molding<br>
channel. The bristle is produced in sections, which permits production of<br>
bristles of greater lengths.<br>
In this embodiment of the device, a different molten polymer mass can be<br>
injected in each injection cycle to produce a bristle which has several<br>
components along the bristle length, wherein the polymers used in each<br>
step can be matched to the requirements of the bristle and connection to<br>
the bristle support thereby producing a bristle with several regions. The<br>
removal motions of the individual groups can be matched, in short time<br>
intervals, to the injection molding cycle, wherein the blank is sufficiently<br>
cooled that it is removed from the remaining molding plates during the<br>
withdrawal motion. The individual regions are preferably bonded together<br>
but may also be connected in a positive or non-positive manner through<br>
corresponding profiling of the end of the last injected partial length.<br>
The molding plate comprising the bristle end and the mold contour at the<br>
end of the molding channel can preferably be replaced with a molding<br>
plate having a different mold contour for producing bristles with ends of<br>
different shapes. This molding plate should only have smooth contours to<br>
permit faultless removal from the mold of the bristle end, which is<br>
important for the respective use.<br>
In this fashion, the end contour of the bristles can be varied for otherwise<br>
constant geometry of the bristles, e.g. have pointed or variably rounded<br>
ends or even to produce bristles with forked-ends (two tips or the like).<br>
This molding plate may have longitudinal molding channel sections of<br>
different depths to form a contoured envelope surface for the bristle ends<br>
of a bristle stock.<br>
A mold cavity, which connects two or more molding channels, is<br>
preferably disposed between the supply channel and the molding channels<br>
of the injection mold for forming a connection among the bristles which<br>
can optionally also connect all bristles. It can serve either as an auxiliary<br>
means for further handling of the entire bristle stock or as an auxiliary<br>
means for completing the bristle stock with a brush body.<br>
The mold cavity can also be designed to produce a brush or paintbrush<br>
body or part thereof.<br>
In particular, the mold cavity can thereby be formed from different<br>
polymers for producing a brush or paintbrush body or part thereof in a<br>
multiple component design.<br>

Fig. 36 shows a top view onto the free end of the bristle of Fig. 35.<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows the flow profile (speed profile) in bristle-<br>
molding channels of different diameters. The walls of the channels are<br>
indicated with broken vertical lines and the associated diameters are given<br>
in (mm) below the diagram. The smallest bristle-molding channel has a<br>
diameter of 0.3mm, the largest has a diameter of 6mm. A constant flow<br>
speed in the center of the channel (core speed) leads to the illustrated<br>
flow profiles in dependence on the channel diameter (bristle diameter)<br>
which have, in rough approximation, a parabolic dependence. If the<br>
diameter of the molding channel remains constant along its length, the<br>
flow profile does not change its shape or does so only slightly.<br>
If the molding channels have a weak conical shape, as schematically<br>
shown in Figs. 2 through 4, the core speed can even be increased for<br>
constant pressure and a strong shearing effect can be produced by the<br>
wall friction in the region close to the wall. If such a molding channel is<br>
loaded with molten polymer mass during injection molding, the molecules<br>
experience a strong longitudinal orientation in the wall region due to the<br>
shearing effect while the molecules in the molten mass which is not<br>
subjected to loads have their energetically most favorable, balled<br>
structure. For molten polymer mass injected in the molding channel under<br>
corresponding high pressure, this leads to a strengthening of the produced<br>
bristle in the region close to the wall which extends to the bristle end for<br>
sufficiently high core speeds, with the molecular orientation decreasing<br>
towards the center. The molecular orientation due to shear flow with<br>
strong shearing effect in the region close to the wall is also accompanied<br>
by tension-induced crystal formation, wherein the strong shearing effect in<br>
the edge region promotes formation of long needle crystals. Moreover, use<br>
of high injection pressure has a favorable effect on the seed formation and<br>
the crystal density. With a specific injection pressure in the molding<br>
channel &gt; 300 bar (0.3105 kPa), preferably &gt; 1300 bar (1.3105 kPa), the<br>
modulus of elasticity and therefore the bending elasticity can be<br>
considerably improved when the forming channel is sufficiently vented,<br>
thereby increasing the tear resistance (tensile strength). This specific<br>
pressure requires an injection pressure of &gt; 500 bar (0.5105 kPa) from<br>
the pressure-generating means.<br>
A bristle in accordance with Fig. 5, produced in a molding channel of Fig. 2<br>
has a relatively stiff root region a and a bending elasticity along its free<br>
length 1, which increases towards the bristle end as well as high tensile<br>
strength. While the root region a serves mainly for connection to or<br>
embedding in a bristle support or brush body, the bristle has, along its<br>
free length L a stem section which consists of a stem base b and the<br>
actual stem c. Reduction of the cross-section in the regions b and c which<br>
is essential for the bending deflection, is compensated for through<br>
increase in the bending elasticity due to the above-described effects. The<br>
stem region b, c is joined by the actual effective region d, i.e. the region<br>
important for the brushing effect which forms, together with the tip region<br>
t, the region which determines the flexibility of the bristle. The tip region<br>
and its shaping determine the direct surface effect of the bristle, the<br>
penetration depth into the surface irregularities etc.. In contrast to Fig. 2,<br>
the bristle can have a trumpet-shaped root region of greater or lesser<br>
distinction when a widening is connected upstream of the actual molding<br>
channel as shown in Figs. 3 and 4.<br>
The stabilizing effects can be further improved and, in particular, also<br>
obtained for short bristle lengths when a discontinuous constriction is<br>
provided on the inlet side of the molten polymer mass before transfer into<br>
the actual bristle-molding channel (see Fig. 6). An extension flow is<br>
formed at the constriction, which produces a high core speed along a<br>
short path with large shearing effect in the region close to the wall.<br>
The inventive operating parameters for injection pressure and the<br>
achievable high core speeds with large shearing effect through wall friction<br>
produce thin bristles of adjustable length using injection molding, which<br>
has not been possible up to now, not even with extrusion of endless<br>
monofilaments, wherein even weak conicity of bristles of such endless<br>
monofilaments can be realized only through considerable technical effort<br>
(interval withdrawal). Figs. 7 and 8 show two embodiments. Fig. 7 shows<br>
(scale 2:1) a bristle of a diameter of 0.77mm in the root region and<br>
0.2mm at the bristle end, which has an average diameter of 0.49mm at<br>
half-length. With an extremely weak conicity angle of 0.27°, which<br>
corresponds to the mold slope of the bristle-molding channel, bristles of a<br>
length of 60mm or more can be injection-molded as are required e.g. for<br>
high-quality paint brushes or the like. They have an average diameter at<br>
half bristle length of approximately 0.5mm. Fig. 8 shows (scale 5:1) a<br>
bristle of a diameter of 0.35mm in the root region and of 0.25mm at the<br>
bristle end with a bristle length of 10.5mm and the same conical angle<br>
(mold slope). The average diameter is 0.3mm. Bristles of this type are<br>
suited e.g. for toothbrushes. Due to the slender geometry of such bristles,<br>
they can be densely arranged without producing excessive separation in<br>
the region of the bristle ends - in contrast to conventional injection-<br>
molded bristles.<br>
Fig. 9 shows the superiority in terms of technical properties and<br>
applications, of the bristle produced according to the invention compared<br>
to a bristle produced by extrusion.<br>
During extrusion spinning of a monofilament for producing a bristle of an<br>
average diameter of 0.3mm, the spinning nozzle has an outlet diameter of<br>
0.9mm (outer vertical lines in Fig. 9). The molten polymer mass has a<br>
maximum flow speed (core speed) inside the nozzle of typically<br>
approximately 300mm/s, which is determined by the extrusion pressure<br>
and the withdrawal speed of the monofilament. The monofilament, which<br>
leaves the nozzle, is drawn along a short path, by means of the<br>
withdrawal forces, to a diameter of between 0.9 and 0.3mm and cooled<br>
directly thereafter to fix the molecular structure. During subsequent<br>
drawing, the monofilament is given its final diameter of 0.3mm with a<br>
diameter tolerance of approximately ±10%. The speed profile is<br>
designated as e (extrusion) in Fig. 9.<br>
In the inventive injection molding, the bristle-molding channel has an<br>
average diameter of 0.3mm (the two inner vertical boundary lines in Fig.<br>
9). An injection pressure in the region of 2000 bar (2105 kPa) produces a<br>
core speed of approximately 1000mm/s in the channel. The speed profile<br>
is designated as i (injection). The shearing effect in the flow, in particular<br>
in the region close to the wall is relevant for the intrinsic strength of the<br>
thermoplastic polymer, which is determined by the shearing rate (shearing<br>
moment) y. The shearing rate y across the radius r of the flow channel<br>
depends on the derivative of the speed profile with respect to the radius r<br><br>
which is inversely proportional to the square of the effective diameter of<br>
the flow channel. The shearing rate is linearly proportional to the<br>
maximum flow speed (core speed). In the above-described example<br>
shearing rates for the injected bristle are produced which exceed the<br>
stated extrusion flow by at least a factor of 10.<br>
The broken lines in Fig. 9 illustrate the shearing rates without scaling for<br>
extrusion (e1) and for injection molding (i1). They have respective maxima<br>
at the walls of the nozzle of the bristle-molding channel.<br>
Figs. 10 to 13 schematically show an embodiment of an injection mold in<br>
different operational phases which is particularly suited for injection<br>
molding of the bristles according to the inventive method. The scale is<br>
highly enlarged to show the details more clearly.<br>
The injection mold 1 has several fong parallel molding channels 2 which<br>
are joined to an injection molding means via a supply channel 3. The<br>
injection molding means is designed to produce injection pressures in the<br>
region of 500 bar (0.5105 kPa), preferably &gt; 2000 bar (2105 kPa). The<br>
exact magnitude of the injection pressure is set in dependence on the<br>
cross-sectional shape of the molding channel 2 along its length and in<br>
dependence on the length itself such that a specific pressure &gt; 300 bar<br>
(0.3105 kPa) occurs in the molding channel.<br>
The injection mold consists of a plurality of layered molding plates 4 of<br>
substantially identical thicknesses, of a molding plate 5 on the injection<br>
side, and a molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends. Each molding plate 4,<br>
5 and 6 generates one longitudinal section of the molding channel 2,<br>
which is preferably produced by bore holes.<br>
The molding plate 5 has openings 7 on the injection side which narrow<br>
towards the molding channel 2 to produce e.g. the extension flow of Fig. 6<br>
and form the root region a (Fig. 5) of the bristle. The subsequent<br>
longitudinal sections of the molding channel in the molding plates 4 have<br>
a cylindrical or slightly conical cross-sectional shape along their length<br>
while the molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends has blind holes 8 which<br>
are dome-shaped in the embodiment shown.<br>
During injection molding, the molten polymer mass enters into the<br>
narrowing openings 7 of the molding plate 5 via the supply channel 3 and,<br>
due to the high core speed, fills the entire molding channel up to the plate<br>
6 forming the ends. The molten polymer mass has a substantially<br>
unordered, balled molecular structure in the supply channel 3 which is<br>
transformed into a longitudinal molecular structure in the opening 7 on<br>
the injection side and subsequent molding channel 2 due to the strong<br>
shear flow.<br>
The molding plates 4, 5 and 6 can be moved perpendicular to the plane of<br>
the plate to release the injection-molded bristles when they have achieved<br>
sufficient shape stability. The injection molding tool 1 is preferably cooled<br>
such that the wall of the molding channels 2 remains relatively cold,<br>
thereby supporting the formation of crystals in the molten polymer mass.<br>
To release the bristles from the mold, the molding plate 6 is initially<br>
removed (Fig. 11). Only very small adhesive forces must be overcome<br>
thereby ensuring that the bristle ends, which are particularly important for<br>
later use of a brush or a paintbrush, maintain their shapes. The molding<br>
plates 4 are subsequently removed individually or in groups (Fig. 12) until<br>
the ends 10 of the bristles 9 are released along most of their length.<br>
During these releasing steps, the bristles are retained by means of the<br>
molding plate 5 on the injection side and this molding plate 5 is also<br>
subsequently removed to expose all bristles 9 with their slightly thickened<br>
root region 11 (Fig. 13). The molten polymer mass in the supply channel<br>
on the injection side also effects a connection 12 among all bristles 9 and<br>
the overall blank can be removed and finished into a brush, a paint brush<br>
or the like, wherein the connection is either integrated into the structure<br>
or only serves as auxiliary means for handling the bristles and is<br>
separated off before connecting the bristles to a brush body or the like.<br>
Optimum venting of the molding channels must be provided during<br>
injection molding to facilitate the desired high core speed. Fig. 14 shows<br>
an embodiment thereof. Venting occurs via narrow gaps 13 between the<br>
molding plates 4, 5 and 6 so that the air is removed along the entire<br>
length of the molding channels 2 as the front advances. Instead of narrow<br>
gaps 13, it is also possible to roughen the mutually facing surfaces of the<br>
molding plates 4, 5 and 6, to obtain overall venting cross-sections of<br>
sufficient size. The venting cross-sections have widenings 14 towards the<br>
outside to permit rapid escape of the exhausting air.<br>
The molding channels 2 may taper along their entire length with a mold<br>
slope 
mold but rather by the desired bristle shape and its bending behavior. The<br>
cross-sectional shape of the molding channels 2 must not be continuously<br>
conical (see the enlarged scale of Fig. 15 illustrating the venting<br>
geometry). The upper molding plate 4 in the drawing indicates a<br>
cylindrical longitudinal section 15 and the lower molding plate 4 a<br>
cylindrical longitudinal section 16 for the molding channel 2. The cross-<br>
section of the two molding plates 4 tapers from the longitudinal section 15<br>
to the longitudinal section 16 of the molding channel 2 by a few µm to<br>
produce a weak step at this point. At this step region, venting takes place<br>
via the gap 13 between the two molding plates, which map into a<br>
widening 14. During release from the mold, these unnoticeable steps are<br>
not visible and produce slight conicity along the entire length of the<br>
bristle. The longitudinal sections 15, 16 in the individual molding plates 4<br>
can be produced through simple drilling. Alternatively, the longitudinal<br>
sections of the individual molding plates can have identical diameters to<br>
produce a cylindrical bristle. More distinct diameter changes produce<br>
stepped bristles.<br>
Conical bristles are technically advantageous for injection molding and for<br>
removal from the moid. The smallest cross-section at the bristle end cools<br>
more rapidly than the subsequent regions of the bristle towards the root<br>
region and the step-by-step release from the bristle end to the bristle root<br>
follows the temperature gradient in the bristle.<br>
The molding plates 4 have a thickness of a few millimeters. It may<br>
correspond approximately to three to fifteen times the diameter of the<br>
molding channel 2 so that extremely precise drilling of the longitudinal<br>
sections in the individual molding plates is possible. Since they are kept<br>
adjacent to one another under the closing pressure of the injection-<br>
molding machine, even these thin molding plates maintain their<br>
dimensions and shape, despite the high injection pressure. The low<br>
thickness also ensures good thermal dissipation, since the molding plates<br>
are evenly insulated by the venting gaps. They are easy to cool for the<br>
same reason, e.g. using external coolants, which can be particularly<br>
effective when the mold is closed, and also during the time between<br>
opening and renewed closing. Effective cooling already occurs via the<br>
surrounding air due to exposure of the molding plates and in consequence<br>
of their small thickness. Alternatively, the cooling means may be<br>
integrated in or between the molding plates. Finally, the minimal loading<br>
under injection pressure permits production of the molding plates from<br>
materials having good thermal conductivity with less stringent mechanical<br>
strength properties than steel or the like.<br>
The influence of effective cooling on the molecular structure of the bristles<br>
has already been discussed above.<br>
Fig. 16 also schematically shows an injection mold 1 which consists of<br>
layered molding plates 4, wherein the molding plate on the injection side<br>
does not have widened cross-sections. In contrast to the above-described<br>
embodiments, the molding plates 4 are divided into two groups 17, 18<br>
(see Fig. 17) wherein each group comprises at least one molding plate<br>
which can be transversely displaced (indicated in Figs. 17 to 20 with<br>
double arrows 19, 20.)<br>
The transversely displaceable molding plates cooperate with the<br>
neighboring molding plates to clamp the blanks 21, which, in this<br>
embodiment, only form one portion (longitudinal section) of the final<br>
bristle. The blank 21 is injected from a thermoplastic polymer with<br>
injection parameters matched to this longitudinal section of the finished<br>
bristle. After the injection cycle, at least one displaceable plate of the<br>
group 18 of molding plates 4 (Fig. 17) is brought into a damping position<br>
and the blanks 21 are carried along when the group 18 is removed to be<br>
thereby partially released from the molding plates 4 of the group 17 on<br>
the injection side and free a predetermined longitudinal section 22 of the<br>
molding channels in the molding plates 4 of the group 17. At the end of<br>
the blank 21, profilings may be optionally formed as indicated in the<br>
drawing. After withdrawal of the molding plates 4 of the group 18, the<br>
displaceable molding plate in the group 17 is brought into the clamping<br>
position and the exposed longitudinal sections 22 are subsequently filled<br>
with a molten polymer mass, which consists of another polymer or a<br>
polymer with other additives. The longitudinal sections 23 of the bristle<br>
which are formed thereby connect to the blanks 21 through material<br>
bonding and/or positive locking. Subsequently, the displaceable forming<br>
plate in group 17 is returned to its initial position and the blanks 21 with<br>
molded-on longitudinal sections 23 are again partially withdrawn from the<br>
molding channels of the group 17 when the clamping means is closed to<br>
expose longitudinal sections 24 in the molding channels. In a further<br>
injection molding cycle, the longitudinal sections 24 are filled with a<br>
further molten polymer mass with optionally further differentiated<br>
properties to finally obtain bristles 27 having three regions (sections 21,<br>
23 and 25) for different mechanical strength properties and/or different<br>
usage properties along the bristle length. In particular, the region 21,<br>
which encloses the bristle end, can serve as wear display to show the<br>
degree of wear of the bristle. Final release of the bristles from the mold is<br>
carried out as described above.<br>
Figs. 21 to 24 also show an injection mold 1 (Fig. 21) which consists of<br>
two groups 17, 18 of molding plates 4 each of which has at least one<br>
transversely displaceable molding plate to form a clamping means. In<br>
contrast to the above-described embodiment, the molding plate 5 on the<br>
injection side has widenings, which taper towards the molding channel.<br>
The molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends has blind holes 28, 29 and 30<br>
of different depths with dome-shaped hole bottoms such that a plurality of<br>
bristles of different lengths can be produced whose ends lie on a curved<br>
envelope surface.<br>
In the embodiment of Figs. 21 to 24, bristles are injected sequentially with<br>
two different regions 31, 32 wherein the region 31 has an extended bristle<br>
root 33. The multiple-section bristles 34 (Fig. 22) injected in this fashion<br>
are subsequently removed from the mold at their ends by removing the<br>
molding plate 6 forming the bristle ends and - optionally with delay -<br>
removing the molding plates 4 of the group 18 (Fig. 22). Subsequently, at<br>
least one transversely displaceable molding plate in the group 18 is<br>
brought into a clamping position and the entire group 18, optionally<br>
together with the terminal molding plate 6, is displaced in the opposite<br>
direction so that the part of the region 31 of the bristles 34 including the<br>
root region 33 project past the molding plate 5 at the injection side.<br>
Subsequently, the injection mold 1 (Fig. 23) )s connected to a further<br>
injection mold 35 with a mold cavity 36 into which a molten polymer mass<br>
is injected with which the root regions 23 and the longitudinal sections of<br>
the regions 31 which project into the cavity 36 are injected. The mold<br>
cavity 36 may be formed so that it defines an intermediate support for the<br>
bristles or a complete brush body in which the bristle ends are embedded<br>
without gaps so that they cannot be pulled out.<br>
In a modification of this embodiment, the molding channels 2 of the<br>
injection mold 1 of Fig. 21 can also be completely filled with one single<br>
molten polymer mass and, as shown in Figs. 22 and 23, their root regions<br>
can be exposed together with the adjacent longitudinal sections for<br>
injection with the support-forming molten polymer mass (Fig. 24).<br>
In a further modification, the bristles which are injected according to Figs.<br>
21 to 23 and released at their mounting-side ends can be completely<br>
released from the mold through removing the molding plate 6 forming the<br>
ends and the major part of the subsequent molding plates 4 while being<br>
held by a few, at least three, molding plates, e.g. the injection-side<br>
molding plate 5 and the two subsequent molding plates one of which can<br>
be transversely displaced to form a damping means. These molding<br>
plates, which serve as a transport holder, can be transported together<br>
with the bristles into another injection molding station in which they are<br>
brought into connection with the injection mold 35 while simultaneously<br>
providing a new set of molding plates with injection-side molding plate 5<br>
to complete the injection mold 1. This transport holder can move the<br>
bristles into the second injection molding station and also continue<br>
transport into other processing stations.<br>
Figs. 25 and 26 show part of an injection mold 1 with molding plates 4<br>
and 5 after production of the bristles and removal of at least the last<br>
molding plate 6 (not shown). Replacing the latter, a flat thrust plate 39 is<br>
moved in front of the released ends with which the bristles 38 are<br>
displaced in the molding channels of the remaining molding plates until<br>
their root region 37, and optionally an adjoining longitudinal section,<br>
project past the injection-side molding plate 5 or into the mold cavity 36<br>
of the further injection mold 35 and are injected with a molten polymer<br>
mass to form a bristle support or a brush body.<br>
Figs. 27 and 28 show an embodiment with which, after production of the<br>
bristles 38 as described with reference to Figs. 25 and 26, instead of the<br>
flat thrust plate 39, a thrust plate 40, which has cam-like projections 41<br>
and 42 of different heights, is moved in front of the released bristle ends.<br>
When the thrust plate 40 has been moved towards the molding plates 4,<br>
the bristles are displaced along the thrust path to different depths within<br>
the molding channels so that their root region 37 projects into the mold<br>
cavity 36 of the injection mold 35 to different depths and the bristle ends<br>
lie on a curved envelope surface after injection and removal of the thrust<br>
plate 40 and molding plates 4 and 5.<br>
Figs. 29 and 30 show an embodiment which differs from that of Figs. 25<br>
and 26 only in that the bristles 38 are interconnected in the region of the<br>
injection-side molding plate 5 via a connection 43 in the form of bars,<br>
grids or the like and project with the connection 43 and the subsequent<br>
longitudinal sections of the bristles 38 into the cavity 36 of the injection<br>
mold 35 after displacement via the thrust plate 39.<br>
A smaller group of molding plates 4, preferably including the injection-side<br>
molding plate 5 and with at least one molding plate 4 which can be<br>
transversely displaced to act as clamping means, may serve as transport<br>
holder for transferring the bristles into further injection molding stations,<br>
processing stations or the like.<br>
The layered structure of the injection mold from a plurality of molding<br>
plates and the thereby possible sectional removal from the mold and the<br>
increase in the modulus of elasticity and tensile strength obtained by the<br>
inventive method parameters of injection pressure and flow speed in the<br>
molding channel permit production of bristles whose central axis is not in<br>
the direction of release from the mold. Figs. 31 and 32 show examples<br>
thereof. Fig. 31 shows a part of an injection mold with slanting molding<br>
channels 44, 45 that are inclined towards each other in this embodiment.<br>
In addition to or alternatively, the injection mold 1 may have wavy,<br>
curved molding channels 46 or molding channels 47 with several bends so<br>
that correspondingly formed bristles are produced which can be injected \n<br>
a composite action via a connection 48. For release from the mold, the<br>
molding plates 4 and 6 are removed, starting with molding plate 6, and<br>
the bristles are released in sections without being deformed due to their<br>
high bending elasticity and the small release length.<br>
The bristles may be fabricated into a brush after separation of the<br>
connection, individually or in groups or together with the connection 48<br>
through injection around it or through other conventional thermal or<br>
mechanical connection methods.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 32, the injection mold 1 has layered molding<br>
plates 4 and two end molding plates 49, 50 that form distinctively<br>
branched bristle ends. The injection-molded bristles 51 each have finger-<br>
like bristle ends 52 which can be easily removed from the mold due to the<br>
thin molding plates and the increased stability of the bristles.<br>
The molding plates 6 or 49, 50 which form the bristle ends can be made<br>
from a sintered metal, in particular, for distinctly branched bristle ends<br>
which also provides additional venting In this region to effectively prevent<br>
trapping of air. The molding plates 4 can, of course, also be made from<br>
such sintered metais to support venting of the molding channels. Micro-<br>
roughnesses which exist e.g. in sintered metals or which can be produced<br>
through surface treatment of the molding channel produce corresponding<br>
roughnesses in the micro region on the surface of the finished bristle<br>
which have a moisture repellant "Lotus" effect during use of the bristle.<br>
Fig. 33 shows one individual bristle 53 which can be used in particular for<br>
hygiene brushes, e.g. toothbrushes, cleaning brushes in the medical and<br>
hospital fields or as cleaning or application brushes in the food industry.<br>
Suitable setting of injection pressure and flow velocity (core speed) in the<br>
bristle-molding channel permits optimum adaptation of the bending<br>
behavior of the bristle along its length to the respective purpose of use,<br>
the bristles having an average diameter of 0.3 to 3mm. They can widen<br>
like a trumpet in the root region 54 to obtain a relatively bending-resistant<br>
shoulder, which also forms a smooth transition to the surface of the brush<br>
body 55. This entire gap-free region, the stem base and the actual stem of<br>
the brush 53 and the bristle end 56, which is uniformly rounded in the<br>
present case, can be produced with injection molding technology to have<br>
smooth walls or walls with micro-roughnesses to prevent occurrence of<br>
unwanted roughnesses and soiling. Due to these properties, the brushes<br>
having bristles of this type can also be easily cleaned and/or disinfected<br>
after use since no pockets, gaps or the like are present. Bristles having<br>
this shape and the properties designed for the application can neither be<br>
produced by extrusion nor by injection molding methods known to date.<br>
Fig. 34 shows two neighboring bristles 57, which are combined at their<br>
trumpet-like rounded root region 58 via a connection indicated with 59.<br>
Using the inventive method, the bristles 57 with the connection 59 can be<br>
disposed at a slight separation from each other, which can, moreover, be<br>
optimally adjusted to the respective purpose of application. The bristles 57<br>
can be positioned very closely to prevent moisture, dirt or bacteria<br>
deposits or remnants following rinsing.<br>
Fig. 35 shows a view of and Fig. 36 a top view onto a bristle 60 produced<br>
according to the inventive method, which merges like a trumpet into the<br>
bristle support surface 62 in the root region 61 and has a stem 63 with<br>
relatively high bending strength and an effective region 64 with profiled<br>
shape. In this embodiment, the effective region 64 has a cross-shaped<br>
cross-section, which gradually merges 65 into the stem region. The cross-<br>
shaped cross-section of the effective region 64 forms brushing edges,<br>
which become effective under strong loading of the brush and bending of<br>
the effective region. With reduced pressure, this effect occurs at the<br>
rounded bristle end 66, which also has a cross-shaped profile. The bristle<br>
end 66 can moreover penetrate into corners, gaps and furrows for<br>
cleaning it. The same effects can be obtained with other polygonal cross-<br>
sectional shapes.<br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1. A method for producing a bristle from a thermoplastic polymer by<br>
injection molding a molten polymer mass into a bristle-molding channel,<br>
said channel having a predetermined length and a predetermined cross-<br>
sectional shape along said length, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
a) injecting the molten polymer mass into said channel under<br>
pressure, said pressure being selected in dependence on said cross<br>
sectional shape of said channel, a ratio of a largest width of a cross<br>
section of said channel to said length of said channel being selected<br>
as less than or equal to 1:10,<br>
wherein said injection pressure is 2000 to 5000 bar (2 x105 kPa to<br>
5x105 kPa), and sufficient to provide a specific pressure in a bristle<br>
forming channel of more than 300 bar (0.3 x 105 kPa); and<br>
b) venting said channel along said length during step a), wherein a<br>
