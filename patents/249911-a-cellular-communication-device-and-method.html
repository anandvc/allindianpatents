				<td>FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to cellular device security apparatus and methods<br>
and, more particularly, but not exclusively to a security system for protection of data<br>
and access thereto, including read and write access to configuration data, in a cellular<br>
telephony device.<br>
A security vulnerability exists in cellular devices. In even the most secure of<br>
current devices it is currently possible to read sensitive information from a cellular<br>
device (source) and write it into a new cellular device (destination) thus making the<br>
destination device identical to the source device with regards to the cellular network.<br>
This enables the destination device to make calls, which are then billed to the source<br>
device. Such sensitive information may include device information such as the<br>
network identity of the device. It may also include personal information such as the<br>
user's personal telephone book.<br>
Exploiting the same vulnerability it is also possible to copy sensitive<br>
information from a source device to a destination device, thus enabling an end-user<br>
device upgrade without the knowledge of the cellular provider. Likewise it is possible<br>
to steal a device in one country and sell it in another country after a new operating<br>
system has been written into the stolen device.<br>
A cellular device contains the following unique information items that allow<br>
any particular device to be identified uniquely:<br>
1.	ESN: Electronic Serial Number. A unique number supplied by the<br>
manufacturer of the cellular device.<br>
2.	NUM: The cellular device's phone number, supplied by the cellular<br>
provider.<br>
3.	A-KEY:	Authentication key. Generated, by Synacom<br>
Technologies Inc. of San Jose, California, USA, for each cellular device and cellular<br>
provider separately, supplied by the manufacturer and used for authenticating the<br>
identity of a cellular device by the cellular provider.<br>
4.	SSD: An identifier created by the cellular network in combination<br>
with additional information from the cellular provider's database and used to identify<br>
the cellular device when a call is being made.<br><br><br>
These four information items are rightly regarded as being extremely<br>
sensitive. They are generally located in the cellular device along with the operating<br>
system located on the chipset.<br>
DM (Data Mode)<br>
The DM is a mode in which the device allows any access to the device to<br>
change settings and/or accepts commands, via its serial interface, which can be used<br>
to read and write information. Setting the device to DM enables reading and writing<br>
of data via COM, USB, IR, RF, Bluetooth and any other available interface on the<br>
cellular device. There exists a data mode entry command for causing the device to<br>
enter data mode, and a code, for example a keypad code, which is required in order to<br>
enter DM. The DM code and/or command, is typically unique for each manufacturer.<br>
Cloning a cellular device:<br>
Using data mode it is possible to clone a cellular device. The devices may be<br>
cloned using one of the following three procedures:<br>
•	Reading the A-KEY, SSD, ESN and NUM information fields from a<br>
source device and writing them into a destination device.<br>
•	Reading the A-KEY, ESN and NUM information fields from a source<br>
device and writing them into a destination device, and then requesting a "SSD update"<br>
operation from the cellular provider to receive a valid SSD field.<br>
•	Reading the SSD, ESN and NUM information fields from a source<br>
device and writing them into a destination device.<br>
The A-KEY, SSD, ESN and NUM information fields are all readable from the<br>
cellular devices in one way or another.<br>
A single cellular device can be cloned to multiple destination devices, all of<br>
which will consequently generate calls billed to the original device.<br>
There are several techniques to read the A-KEY, SSD and the ESN<br>
information fields and to write them on a new device. One possibility comprises using<br>
a serial RS-232 or USB cable to connect the source cellular device to a personal<br>
computer and via a program to read and write these fields from the device's operating<br>
system.<br><br><br>
The cellular devices may be divided into two basic types, devices without<br>
protection, in which the information is readable via the operating system, and devices<br>
with password protection. The password is a sixteen (16) hexadecimal digit string<br>
(which amounts to eight binary octets). Cracking this password is presumably very<br>
difficult. When the password is known, the ESN, A-KEY, SSD and NUM fields are<br>
accessible and can be read or written. The password is currently manufacturer<br>
specific, and therefore if broken once, all devices made by the same manufacturer<br>
become vulnerable.<br>
The above-described methods for reading and writing information fields from<br>
the devices likewise enable reading and writing the device's operating system. Some<br>
devices have a protection password but it is still possible to read the operating system<br>
without knowing the protection password, and thus it is possible to obtain the<br>
password.<br>
Hacking a cellular device:<br>
Cellular devices may be categorized into two general kinds:<br>
1.	Devices without passwords: In devices where the data read and data<br>
write functions are not protected by a password, the operating system contains two<br>
separate read and write command sets: one set for upgrading the operating system and<br>
one set for reading and writing from the operating system's memory. These<br>
commands can be used directly by a hacker to read the information if the device is the<br>
source device, or to write the information if the device is the destination device.<br>
2.	Devices with passwords: A protection password is encoded into the<br>
device's operating system and thus can be obtained from the binary operating system<br>
file obtainable on the internet, by theft from the cellular providers or by reading the<br>
data from the device.<br>
It is possible to alter the password or to use additional constantly based,<br>
countermeasures to protect the cellular device. The term "constantly based' refers<br>
typically to passwords which are different for different manufacturers, different<br>
device models, different cellular providers, different operating systems and versions<br>
etc. However a single password applies to numerous individual devices.<br>
It is noted that the passwords themselves, as well as any additional<br>
countermeasures, can be decoded from the operating system's binary file, and the<br><br><br>
binary file has to be distributed to all the cellular providers who use cellular<br>
telephones from the given manufacturer. The passwords are thus as secure as the<br>
weakest provider.<br>
Another method is to obtain the mobile telephone management or PST<br>
 program which is used to program the cellular devices. PST is a generic term for<br>
programs produced by the manufacturers that are given to the network operators to<br>
maintain the cellular device base. The PST program may then be analyzed, thus<br>
obtaining the passwords.<br>
Such an analysis is possible due to the fact that the PST program is a<br>
standalone program.<br>
The DIRECTORY field of the mobile telephone, which is a location in which<br>
sensitive information is stored, is accessible for reading and writing via the operating<br>
system or keypad codes. Therefore a device's identification in the data network can<br>
be obtained and altered to identify itself as a different device.<br>
In addition, the operating system can be replaced without a hacker being<br>
required to have any knowledge of the protection password. Such a replacement can<br>
be used to remove any new safeguards inserted into the new version of the operating<br>
system, thus leaving the device vulnerable with an old version of the operating<br>
system.<br>
The replacement of the operating system can also be used to change the<br>
language of the operating system when a cellular device is stolen in one country and<br>
sold in another country.<br>
As mentioned above, typically, cellular devices have at least two sets of read<br>
and write instructions: One set is for upgrading the operating system and one set is for<br>
communicating with information fields within the operating system.<br>
A further point that is mentioned is that when sending an SMS message, the<br>
sender's phone number is a data field which may be filled manually by the user and<br>
thus a sender can appear to be someone else in the eyes of the receiver.<br>
Cloning software is available from the following exemplary sources:<br>
The UniCDMA cloning program is available from <a href="../cdn-cgi/l/email-protection.html" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="eb888f868a98848d9f9c8a998eab9e8099c5858e9f">[email&#160;protected]</a>:<br>
The NVtool cloning program is available from certain forums;<br>
The GTRAN CDMA 1X DATA CARD (800M)_PRL-Ver 3.1 program is<br>
available from certain forums;<br><br><br>
The DM cloning program, by Qualcom, is also available from certain forums.<br>
There is thus widely recognized need for, and it would be highly advantageous to have, a cellular device<br>
security system in which access to the data mode is devoid of the above limitation.<br>
Several attempts that deal with restricting the access to the setting and configuration data of electronic<br>
devices are known in the art. Specifically, US Patent No. 5,887,250 discloses a mobile station provided<br>
with a memory for storing a Service Programming Code (SPC) derived from a multi-bit secret pattern that<br>
is stored in the mobile station for use in a mobile station authentication process. The SPC operates as a<br>
locking code for enabling at least one mobile function to be performed. The mobile station is arranged such<br>
that it enables a predefined mobile station action only if the entered SPC and the stored SPC are found to be<br>
equal.<br>
US Patent No. 5,060,295 discloses an electronic device, which includes a memory and a programming port.<br>
The electronic device provides means for disabling the programming port for preventing reprogramming of<br>
the device. The device uses a coded signal, such as an RF signal transmitted to the device, for selectively<br>
enabling or disabling communication through the port.<br>
US Patent No. 5,673,317 discloses a wireless network access device. The access to is controlled by a<br>
control program retained in a memory in the device. Data representing a key code and an access enabling<br>
code are stored in the memory of the device. An access code based upon key code stored on the device is<br>
generated. The access code is compared with the access enabling code and, if equal, enabling access to the<br>
device.<br>
UK Patent No. 2,362,543 discloses a security unit of a mobile telephone that generates a password using an<br>
algorithm which is based upon a secret code stored in the mobile and some other variable such as the<br>
current time and date. The password and a user identifier are transmitted to a security server by means of<br>
the access provider. The validity of the password and identifier are checked, and access to a computer<br>
network is granted accordingly.<br>
US Patent No. 6,026,293 discloses an electronic device with a memory and a processing means containing<br>
logic that is used to perform a one-way hash calculation the device's memory contents such that an audit<br>
hash value, or signature, of such contents is derived. The audit hash value is compared to an authenticated<br>
valid hash value derived from authentic memory contents. A difference between the audit and valid hash<br>
values can be indicative of memory tampering.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present embodiments comprise a method and apparatus for protection of<br>
the data mode of the cellular telephony device. Preferably the data mode is protected<br>
by a password, and preferably the password is device specific. In a further preferred<br>
embodiment the password is dynamic and ideally is a one-time password. An<br>
advantage of a one-time password is that even if it is picked up by a sniffer program it<br>
is already too late as the cellular device now expects a different password. In an<br>
alternative embodiment the read and write instructions and/or data mode entry<br>
instructions are assigned different codes. Again this is preferably done in such a way<br>
that the codes are different for different devices. Again preferably it is done<br>
dynamically and preferably there is a one-time configuration for each time the device<br>
enters data mode.<br><br><br>
Additionally or alternatively data mode protection is provided by only<br>
allowing access to the data mode operations whilst a live connection is available to a<br>
predefined secure server or other network accessible security arrangement.<br>
Additionally or alternatively data mode protection is provided by only<br>
changing the data mode keypad code and/or instruction so that they are unique for<br>
each device.<br>
Additionally or alternatively data mode protection is provided by disabling the<br>
data mode access until such access is required by an authorized party, at which time<br>
the cellular device is signaled to accept commands. It is possible that such a signal be<br>
provided via a physical interface or via the cellular network or via any other wireless<br>
interface or via any external electromagnetic influence.<br>
A preferred embodiment combines restricting the data access mode entry,<br>
protecting the read and write instructions with a password and changing the read and<br>
write instructions so that all the passwords, instructions and codes are unique for each<br>
device.<br>
Returning to the password embodiment, the password may be constructed<br>
from one or more of the unique information items stored on each cellular device, such<br>
as the A-key, together with one or more dynamically changing or random or randomly<br>
changing data items. In a preferred embodiment two of the cellular device's unique<br>
information items are used together with two other random items.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention, a server is provided for each<br>
cellular provider or like body, which manages the unique and preferably dynamic<br>
passwords for each of the devices registered with that cellular provider. The server <br>
provides the passwords in real time as data mode is entered, and thus the cellular<br>
device is only able to enter data mode when a connection is present to the given<br>
server. This is acceptable for legitimate use, since data mode is only needed for initial <br>
setup, later upgrading and other technical services which only the cellular provider<br>
carries out. Illegitimate use however becomes very difficult. In particular, even if an<br>
illegitimate user manages to crack the password for a given device, all he gains is a<br>
single device. The operation is uneconomic, by contrast to the current state of the art<br>
where a single password gives access to a very large number of devices.<br><br><br>
The principles and operation of a cellular telephony device according to the<br>
present invention may be better understood with reference to the drawings and<br>
accompanying description.<br>
Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of<br>
construction and the arrangement of the components set forth in the following<br>
description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other<br>
embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be<br>
understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose<br>
of description and should not be regarded as limiting.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 1, which illustrates a standard mobile<br>
communication device 10. Device 10 may work with any of the mobile telephony<br>
standards such as GSM, CDMA, TDMA, 1x, CDMA 2000, GPRS and the like. Each<br>
of these standards provides a high level of protection for communication over the<br>
airwaves to prevent eavesdropping and the like. In addition to communication over<br>
the airwaves, the mobile communication device 10 has a data input 12 which allows<br>
the cellular device to be connected to a computer or like client device 14 to be<br>
programmed. The cellular device may need to be programmed to provide it with an<br>
operating system, to tell it what its telephone number is and the like, to make<br>
particular services available to the user and to reprogram and upgrade the cellular<br>
device during its lifetime.<br>
Unfortunately, cellular device 10 has no way of knowing whether it is<br>
currently being connected to legitimate reprogramming client device 14, or to an<br>
imposter's reprogramming client device 16. As discussed in the background, the<br>
imposter's reprogramming client may seek to carry out cloning, or may introduce<br>
older versions of the operating system, having known weaknesses that the imposter<br>
may subsequently exploit or carry out a range of other telecommunications crimes.<br>
The cellular device 10 in fact enters a data mode in order to be reprogrammed and in<br>
that data mode all of the above activities are typically possible.<br>
Again, as discussed in the background, password protection of the data mode<br>
is known. However, since data mode is needed for initial programming of the device,<br>
the passwords tend to be set for all of the devices of a given manufacturer or for<br>
certain models or for particular batches of those models. The passwords are thus<br><br><br>
shared between thousands or millions of devices, and have to be distributed amongst<br>
all of the cellular providers. Only one weakness at one provider, or one successful<br>
attempt to attack the password directly, means that all the devices sharing the same<br>
password are compromised.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 2, which shows a cellular communication<br>
device 20 connected for upgrading according to an upgrading configuration of a first<br>
preferred embodiment of the present invention. Device 20 is in data mode for<br>
allowing reading and writing of data to change the settings and generally to allow<br>
reprogramming including replacing or updating of the operating system, changing of<br>
the telephone number and the like. The device 20 is configured to restrict use of the<br>
data mode in accordance with a unique security setting belonging to the device. Thus<br>
the data mode cannot be used unless the device unique security setting is provided. In<br>
this way it is no longer possible to obtain a single password and thereby compromise<br>
a large number of devices.<br>
Within the device 20 itself, a mode management unit 22, otherwise referred to<br>
herein as an access restrictor or configuration enabler, may be provided, either as<br>
hardware or as software, to manage the device unique security setting to ensure that<br>
the data mode can only successfully be entered upon correct use of the device unique<br>
security setting, and not otherwise.<br>
The device unique security setting may in one embodiment be a physical<br>
setting. Each communication device may be set with a series of jumpers or like<br>
switches, which may be set in a unique manner for each device. In another<br>
embodiment the setting may be made in software.<br>
In one embodiment, the device unique security setting is not in fact a password<br>
as such, but rather is an encoding configuration for the data mode read and write<br>
instructions, and the data mode entry command. Each cellular device has different<br>
codes for the various read and write instructions of data mode of which there may be<br>
several. Thus a reprogramming client device 24 does not know, unless it is told, what<br>
the read and write command codes are for the given device and therefore fails to carry<br>
out reprogramming. An authorized device however has the necessary information, as<br>
will be explained in greater detail below and thus can reprogram the device.<br><br>
In another embodiment the setting is a password. The password is unique to<br>
the individual device. Without the password the data mode cannot be entered and no<br>
reprogramming is possible.<br>
In another embodiment the device unique security setting is a dynamic<br>
password. That is to say it is a password which is changed at regular intervals. Thus<br>
even if the password for a given device is obtained, that password only remains valid<br>
for a limited amount of time, after which the device ceases to be compromised.<br>
hi a preferred embodiment, the dynamic password is a one-time password, that<br>
is to say the password is used only once to enter data mode. Once it has been used it<br>
is discarded and a new password is needed for any subsequent entries into data mode.<br>
The principles of dynamic and one-time passwords are also applicable to the<br>
command encodings as described above. Thus each device can have dynamically<br>
changing command codes and even one-time command codes. In a particularly<br>
preferred embodiment the commands are in fact changed after every single read or<br>
write action.<br>
Several methods for providing dynamic and one-time passwords are described<br>
below and persons skilled in the field of cryptography will know of other possibilities.<br>
In one embodiment, the device unique security setting is constructed using one<br>
or more of the device specific data items given above in the background and one or<br>
more random data items. That is the device specific item or items as well as the<br>
random item or items may for example be used to seed either a password generator or<br>
command code generator. In a preferred embodiment seeding involves a hashing<br>
function. A hashing function is useful because the one-way property of the function<br>
enables the mobile device to authenticate the password without it being possible in a<br>
realistic time frame for an eavesdropper to reproduce the password without the seed<br>
data.<br>
In a specific implementation, the device unique security setting is constructed<br>
using two device specific data items and two random or changing data items.<br>
Using the above embodiments, the device unique security setting can be<br>
dynamically changed over a series of data mode operations.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the device unique security<br>
settings are dynamic and change rapidly. In such a case it is not sufficient for<br><br><br>
reprogramming computer 24 to be able to obtain the settings. Rather it must have a<br>
live connection to a security server 26 which knows or generates the settings.<br>
Security server 26 supports data configuration operations at cellular<br>
communication device 20 which connects remotely via a network, for example<br>
through its data connection 22 and reprogramming computer 24. Alternatively, the<br>
device may be connected via a Bluetooth, RF connection, COM, USB, IR interfaces<br>
or any other physical interface. Connection via the cellular network may also be<br>
possible, for example by connecting the server side of the system to the cellular<br>
provider's provisioning or management networks.<br>
The server preferably comprises a database of unique data of the individual<br>
devices as well as an ability to generate passwords or command encodings using that<br>
unique data and other random data. The resulting passwords, instructions etc which it<br>
generates constitute device specific data mode entry instructions or read and write<br>
instructions which are required at the cellular communication devices, and permit<br>
entry into data mode at the cellular communication devices.<br>
The cellular device has to be secured in such a way as to enable the cellular<br>
provider who bought the device to communicate through the data mode of the device<br>
to carry out programming and configuration while preventing everyone else from<br>
communicating with the device through the data mode.<br>
In the preferred embodiments the data mode is thus protected with a password<br>
or passwords, the passwords being different for each individual cellular device. In<br>
alternative embodiments the data communication commands are themselves encoded.<br>
In the password embodiment, the password secures communication with the<br>
device via any interface and for any data mode operation including diagnostic and<br>
monitoring operations, reading and writing data, and running technician programs etc.<br>
The device's default mode will be to wait for a password before entering data mode.<br>
All other operations are preferably locked until a password is provided and then only<br>
the operations associated with the supplied password are made available. That is to<br>
say, in one embodiment it is possible to provide different passwords for different<br>
access levels. Various levels can be defined so that different read and write actions<br>
require different passwords or successively increasing portions of a larger, more<br>
secure password.<br><br><br>
The construction of the password or passwords is explained in greater detail<br>
hereinbelow.<br>
In the command encoding embodiment, cellular devices without passwords are<br>
protected by changing the code numbers for the read, write and data entry mode<br>
instructions. As an alternative, it is possible to modify such devices by adding<br>
passwords to the operating system so that they protect the device with a password or<br>
passwords as described above.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 3 which shows in greater detail the<br>
configuration of Fig. 2. Server 26 comprises a database 30 and a server program 32.<br>
The mobile device 34 is preferably associated with a client program 36. Both the<br>
server and the mobile devices are associated with a given provider's cellular network<br>
38.<br>
The password or passwords and commands may be saved in a central database<br>
30 located in a secure network, which is preferably unique to each cellular provider.<br>
Thus, no cellular provider has access to another cellular provider's database and<br>
consequently, to its devices. In the one-time password embodiment the central<br>
database may not actually store any passwords but rather the seed information needed<br>
at run time to generate the password, which is never used again.<br>
A client-server program system preferably enables the cellular provider to<br>
manage the devices when they are physically connected to a client side of the secure<br>
system. The devices may be connected, as described above via a reprogrammer's<br>
computer and the data port of the device. Alternatively, as mentioned above, the<br>
device may be connected via a Bluetooth, RF connection, COM, USB, IR interfaces<br>
or any other physical interface. Connection via the cellular network 38 may be made<br>
available by connecting the server side of the system to the cellular provider's<br>
provisioning or management networks.<br>
Server program 32 is preferably provided to supply an interface between the<br>
database which contains the information needed to communicate with the cellular<br>
device and the client program 36.<br>
The server program preferably contains the algorithms needed to communicate<br>
with the cellular device and the client program preferably acts as a remote interface<br>
for the server program and, possibly, the GUI.<br><br><br>
In an embodiment the algorithms may be located in client program 36 rather<br>
than in the server program 32. Client program 36 is preferably part of a client device<br>
which the technician carries with him.<br>
Alternatively, the client program may be held within the mobile device 37. In<br>
this case the mobile device connects via the cellular or data network 38 and an<br>
internal client supports the connection to allow secure modification of the internal<br>
parameters of the telephone.<br>
The server system can, if desired, be constructed in a standalone mode. Such a<br>
standalone mode is shown in Fig. 4. Parts that are the same as in Fig. 3 are given the<br>
same reference numerals and are not referred to again except as necessary for<br>
understanding the present embodiment. In the standalone mode the mobile device is<br>
connected directly to the secure server. Such an arrangement may be appropriate in<br>
certain circumstances such as in the case of a cellular provider in a very small country<br>
having just a single service center, or in the case of a small scale network provider.<br>
Communication between the client and the server may be encrypted, so as to<br>
prevent eavesdroppers from reading sensitive information whilst it is traversing the<br>
cellular provider's internal network using sniffer programs.<br>
In one preferred embodiment the only data operations available without a<br>
password are changing user information via the cellular device's keypads, for<br>
example changing the phone book entries, reading and sending SMSs, and the like.<br>
Devices are typically provided with a keypad code to set the device into DM<br>
(Data Mode). In the preferred embodiments this code is altered, as described<br>
hereinbelow for the passwords.<br>
In the following, the production of individual passwords or command codes is<br>
explained.<br>
Whether considering password values, read instructions, write instructions,<br>
DM code or other device commands which are to be changed or added, the values<br>
may be constructed as follows:<br>
The construction may use one or more random values, whether numeric,<br>
alphabetic, alphanumeric or any other. The random values may be memory areas in<br>
the device's operating system or designated fields.<br>
The construction may use a value generated from the contents of the NUM<br>
field.<br><br><br>
The construction may use a value generated from the contents of the ESN<br>
field.<br>
The construction may use a value generated from the contents of the A-KEY<br>
field.<br>
The construction may use a value generated from the contents of the SSD<br>
field.<br>
The construction may use a product or a function of the contents of one or<br>
more of the following value fields:<br>
NUM field,<br>
ESN field,<br>
A-KEY field,<br>
SSD field, and<br>
a random value or random values. The random values may be memory areas in<br>
the device's operating system or designated fields as before.<br>
The construction may further use a value generated from an algorithm which is<br>
time-dependent and generates a different code for every second, minute or time<br>
interval. Further variation or alternative variation may then be introduced into the<br>
result based upon for example one or more of the following:<br>
Time.<br>
Challenge-response from the device's keypad.<br>
NUM field,<br>
ESN field,<br>
A-KEY field,<br>
SSD field,<br>
A random value or random values (The random values may be memory areas<br>
in the device's operating system or designated fields), and<br>
A seed value or values.<br>
The above described value is hereinafter designated ALG1.<br>
The value can be changed every time the device is connected to the system so<br>
that a one-time password, command or code results.<br>
The password is then preferably required in order to make changes in the<br>
cellular device's operating system. Such changes include disabling the write<br>
instructions which enable upgrading the operating system, disabling the read<br><br><br>
commands which can access the operating system program, removing the password or<br>
passwords fields from the operating system's binary files and writing them after the<br>
operating system has been written into the device, changing the method in which an<br>
operating system upgrade is performed, including changing the commands so that<br>
they are different for each device, and locking of the commands so that a new<br>
operating system may be accepted only after a password has been provided.<br>
Providing of the password and upgrading of the operating system may be as follows:<br>
The system provides a password.<br>
The device accepts or rejects the password.<br>
If accepted, the device accepts a new operating system.<br>
A new password (or the same old password) is written into the device.<br>
The operating system subsequently rejects any new upgrades until the<br>
password has been received again.<br>
A second method for a password controlled operating system upgrade is as<br>
follows:<br>
The system waits for a valid password or a command, and a flag is set so that<br>
the operating system accepts a new operating system version. The new operating<br>
system is now written but with an unset flag.<br>
A new password (or the same old password) may then be written into the<br>
device, the flag set and the operating system rendered usable.<br>
In a further security measure, it is possible to configure the system such that<br>
once the ESN value has been written into the device via the system, the operating<br>
system prevents any subsequent writing to the ESN information field.<br>
The A-KEY value may be set to be only writeable and not readable.<br>
It is possible to change the protection password in devices which have a<br>
password and, if possible, to add a password to those devices which do not have a<br>
password. The password is preferably unique for each device.<br>
As a further security measure it is possible to provide separate passwords for<br>
different operations. The separate passwords may be provided as parts of a longer,<br>
more secure, password. Alternatively, they can be completely different passwords.<br>
As mentioned above, in one of the embodiments, it is possible to change the<br>
operating system's read and write instructions for the information fields into different<br><br><br>
values for different devices. It is further possible to change the periodic command<br>
which prevents the cellular device from rebooting when in Data Mode (DM).<br>
An additional security measure involves disabling the key codes which enable<br>
changing the A-KEY and DIRECTORY fields via the device's keypad. As discussed<br>
above, the DIRECTORY field typically contains the information in the NUM field.<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention prevent any communication<br>
with the device's operating system via any of the device interfaces,, whether the<br>
Keypad, a USB port, a Com port, an IR port, or any other interface unless a live<br>
connection is present to a secure server as described above. The live connection is<br>
preferably verified via the above-described single or multiple passwords or via the<br>
fact that the connecting device knows the current codes for the data mode instructions.<br>
One way of protecting data mode via a one-time password is to lock data<br>
communication, that is DM or Data Mode, with the device's operating system unless<br>
a key is entered into the device. The key is different for each device, as explained<br>
above, and generated in a similar method to the generation of the passwords and<br>
commands explained above, so that it is different for each device and, possibly, time-<br>
dependent. The system prompts the user to enter the device's ESN and then provides<br>
the user in return with the correct code to enable the device's Data Mode. The device<br>
is then connected to the system, and the code is immediately altered, that is to say the<br>
mobile telephone is issued with the next key. The next key is preferably encrypted<br>
and passed to the mobile telephone electronically as data so that it is not available to<br>
the user.<br>
If the device is not connected to the system within a reasonable time after the<br>
current key is given out an alert may be written to the central database.<br>
A further security measure comprises disabling the caller number input field<br>
when sending an SMS. The contents of the NUM field may be used for the caller<br>
number value, thus preventing senders of SMS messages from using false source<br>
numbers.<br>
Preferably, in accordance with the present embodiments, each device arrives<br>
from the manufacturer at the cellular provider locked with a different password. For<br>
example the A-KEY can be used. The password is sent to the cellular provider who<br>
bought the device along with the ESN, and A-KEY if that is additional to the<br>
password. These are delivered to the cellular provider separately from the devices. It<br><br><br>
is also possible for the manufacturer to generate a separate password from seed values<br>
and then in fact send the seed values to the cellular provider who repeats the<br>
calculation process.<br>
If the above security procedures are carried out, then, the only two keypad<br>
codes that may be left in the device are:<br>
a keypad code to change the contents of the NUM field, and<br>
a keypad code to change device's mode to DM (Data Mode).<br>
Subsequently, the client-server software system with central database, as<br>
described above in respect of Figs 2, 3 and 4, manages the data mode communication<br>
with the cellular device so that the cellular provider, and he alone, can perform the<br>
following actions:<br>
Upgrading of the cellular device's operating system.<br>
Changing the NUM field.<br>
Changing the A-KEY fields: including initial setting and subsequent<br>
modification as necessary.<br>
Setting the ESN field. This is typically a one-time action.<br>
Reading and writing cellular network information fields.<br>
Reading and writing the phone book<br>
Reading and writing additional user information on a large scale such as saved<br>
SMS messages, icons, ring tones etc. Clearly the subscriber would wish to use these<br>
facilities freely but wholesale copying of the entire address book and the like may be<br>
operations that one would wish to protect.<br>
The data mode protection features described herein preferably ensure that the<br>
cellular device only accepts changes or return information when connected to the<br>
client side of the system of the cellular provider who bought the device. Preferably no<br>
information is retrievable and no configuration information can be written without a<br>
connection to the system. No changes are admitted if not received from the cellular<br>
provider's system. Alternatively the changes need not come from the system, but can<br>
only be accepted whilst the cellular device is connected to the cellular provider's<br>
system. In one embodiment, the securing of the device may affect all the device's<br>
interfaces except the keypad.<br>
Preferred embodiments enable keeping the ESN, NUM, A-KEY and SSD<br>
fields secure whilst at the same time enabling them to be changed when needed by<br><br><br>
simply knowing the correct password. The change may thus be made only by those<br>
who are allowed to do so, thus preferably technicians of the cellular provider who<br>
purchased the device from the manufacturer.<br>
Returning to Fig. 3 and server program 32 preferably includes a database<br>
engine which contains the information need to generate the password or passwords<br>
and read and write instructions for the each cellular device. The information contained<br>
is one or more of the following fields: ESN, NUM, A-KEY, SSD and random values,<br>
according to the type of protection chosen.<br>
The following information may be retained in database 30:<br>
First of all the data base may hold cellular device authentication information,<br>
such as ESN, current A-KEY, and a new A-KEY, that is a number sent during current<br>
signaling operations to provide the mobile device with a new A-KEY for the next<br>
time the system is to communicate with the cellular device. The same may apply to<br>
any other field that can be changed remotely, namely that a next key can be sent<br>
during a current operation. The database may also hold a device manufacturer and<br>
model, a last communication date with the device, a device operating system version,<br>
and a password or passwords.<br>
Secondly the database may hold a client identification table. The table may<br>
typically hold the following information: a client IP address, a client MAC address,<br>
and a client identification string. The database may also hold a device manufacturer<br>
table. The table may hold the manufacturer name, and a manufacturer number, thus<br>
various arbitrary numbers may be assigned by the system to each manufacturer.<br>
The database may also hold a device model table. The model table may hold<br>
data such as the manufacturer number, as described above, and the model name.<br>
The database may also store alerts or abnormal operations detected in the<br>
system such as a user requesting a DM enabling code and not subsequently<br>
connecting the device to the system.<br>
It is possible that additional information may be kept, such as operations<br>
carried out on different devices, when they have been performed and by whom.<br>
It is possible that if the data mode entry keypad code is to be uniquely set for<br>
each device, the code (or its seed information) may be kept in the database and the<br>
required information may then be provided when needed after the requesting party is<br><br>
properly identified. In a preferred embodiment, the code is replaced after the device<br>
has been connected to the system.<br>
If the data mode entry instruction is to be uniquely set for each device, the<br>
instruction (or corresponding seed information) may be kept in the database and can<br>
be provided when the device has been connected to the system and identified by the<br>
user. In a preferred embodiment, the instruction may be replaced after the device has<br>
been connected to the system.<br>
As will be understood from the above, transfer of password infornaation is<br>
used in preferred embodiments between the client and the server programs. Such<br>
transfer is preferably part of an encrypted communication stream protocol. The<br>
protocol may for example be implemented over a TCP/IP (v4 or v6) transport<br>
protocol. The protocol defines data packets, and the data packets in one preferred<br>
embodiment conform to the structure given below in table 1.<br><br>
One of the packet types defined in the protocol is the sync packet, whose<br>
structure is shown below in table 2. In the sync packet, no data field is available. A<br>
sync packet is sent from the client to the server or the server to the client periodically,<br>
say every 500ms. If a sync packet is not received within another period, say 10<br>
seconds, then the side which did not receive the sync packet may disconnect.<br><br><br>
In the protocol, a client, that is the mobile device, makes a request for a<br>
connection to allow data mode. The structure of the Client connect request data<br>
packet is that given above in table 1. The data field is structured as shown below in<br>
Table 3.<br><br>
Following the connect request is a server connect acknowledge, which is sent<br>
from the server to the client. The data field is structured as shown in table 4<br><br>
In the continuation of the protocol the server may make a data request. In<br>
such a request the data field preferably contains information to be written to the<br>
interface of the cellular device. The data field is structured as shown in Table 5.<br><br><br>
In response to the server data request is a client data reply. The data field is<br>
structured as shown in table 6 and may contain information read from the cellular<br>
device.<br><br>
In the protocol, the client is able to request a service, such as a given operation<br>
in data mode. A Client service request packet has a data field structured as shown in<br>
table 7 below.<br><br>
The protocol allows the client device to provide identification information<br>
about itself to identify itself to the server. The data field may be structured as shown<br>
in Table 8.<br><br><br>
The protocol preferably allows client user authentication. The data field<br>
contains the structure shown in table 9.<br><br>
Having considered the communication protocoL, a client program is used at the<br>
mobile device to operate the protocol and obtain the Information needed to run data<br>
mode at the device.<br>
The Client program is generally not located within the mobile device but may<br>
be located on another device which connects, physically or otherwise, to the cellular<br>
device via a COM, USB or ER. interface. For example; the client may be located on a<br>
computer used by the cellular provider for reprograrnming cellular telephones. In<br>
another embodiment the technician actually downloads the client program to the<br>
cellular device and it connects via a regular wireless connection to the server. This<br>
latter embodiment is particularly suitable for cellular enabled palmtop type devices.<br>
The client program initially connects to the s-erver program when executed,<br>
preferably via the protocol defined above.<br>
During the course of the connection, Sync packets are sent periodically to and<br>
from the server program so that both the server and client know that the connection is<br>
still live.<br><br><br>
The client program reads and writes data to the cellular device via the selected<br>
interface following server request signals and provides return data to the server when<br>
data becomes available from the interface.<br>
The graphical user interface (GUI) at the client program preferably prompts<br>
the user for a user name and password. After the user has typed the information, a<br>
data packet is sent to the server and the client waits for authentication. Until a data<br>
packet is received with an "Authenticated" flag, no operations are allowed at the<br>
cellular telephone.<br>
There are two possibilities for providing the GUI. One is to provide it as part<br>
of the client (Graphic User Interface), the other is to provide it as part of the server so<br>
that the client accesses it when connected to the server.<br>
Typical functions of the GUI include selecting an interface for connecting to<br>
the mobile device. Thus, such a function may be implemented by opening a dialog<br>
box which allows the user to select the connected interface from a list box: say Coml,<br>
Com2, Com3, Com4, USB.<br>
A function to select a device type may comprise opening a dialog box which<br>
allows the user to select the cellular device type. Thus, two list boxes may be<br>
provided, one list box may contain the manufacturer names and the right list box may<br>
contain the relevant models for the selected manufacturer, as held by the specific<br>
cellular provider.<br>
Before connecting the cellular device to the client, the cellular device has to be<br>
changed into DM (Data Mode). In order to permit such a change in mode,<br>
communication is required with the server as described above. Thus the client<br>
program may send a data packet to the server, using the protocol described<br>
hereinabove. In an alternative embodiment the cellular device is first connected to the<br>
system and then a data mode entry instruction is sent to the cellular device.<br>
The "Select device type" may then be disabled until an interface has been<br>
selected. When the data mode is entered then all or any of the operations listed below<br>
may be selected through the GUI. The operations may typically include:<br>
Initializing a new device.<br>
Upgrading the existing device operating system.<br>
Updating the A-KEY.<br>
Setting the device NUM.<br><br><br>
Reading a phone book from a connected device.<br>
Writing a saved phone book to a connected device. The writing a phonebook<br>
option clearly is only relevant when there is a phonebook to write and thus the<br>
option may be disabled until a phone book has been read.<br>
The operations menu is preferably disabled, that is prevented from being<br>
selected, until an interface and a device manufacturer and model have been selected.<br>
After selecting one of the above operations, a data packet is preferably sent to<br>
the server indicating the service selected. In one embodiment or depending on the<br>
operation, the server has to permit the operation. In other cases the server merely<br>
notes that the operation has taken place.<br>
The GUI element of the client may in one embodiment reside in the server, as<br>
an application which provides remote GUI (such as ASP, ASP.NET, PHP,<br>
JavaScript). In such a case the following may apply:<br>
The GUI application may communicate with the server program via a TCP/IP<br>
socket or named pipes.<br>
The client program may be a socket server while the server program initiates<br>
the communication.<br>
Except for the above two points, operation is the same whether the GUI is<br>
located at the client or at the server.<br>
After the device type has been selected, the client preferably sends data<br>
packets when data is received via the selected interface, regardless of what operation,<br>
if any, it is running. It is optional for the server to identify the cellular device.<br>
Moving now to the server, and the server program connects to the database<br>
and reads and writes information from the database and the client programs.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 5, which shows the procedure when the GUI is<br>
an integral part of the client program. As shown in Fig. 5, the server program waits<br>
for connections from client programs, and when a connection is received it creates a<br>
new listening socket, stage 50, waits for a new connection, stage 52, creates a new<br>
worker thread for the incoming connection, stage 54 and returns to stage 50. A thread<br>
is an authentication system for data packets to ensure that data packets are exchanged<br>
in the correct order and only whilst the connection is suitably authenticated.<br>
Reference is now made to Fig. 6, which shows what happens when the GUI is<br>
not an integral part of the client program. In Fig. 6 the server creates a new named<br><br><br>
pipe listener, stage 60, waits for a new connection, 62, creates a new worker thread<br>
for the incoming connection, 64 and returns to stage 60.<br>
Reference is now made to Figs. 7 and 8 which detail the thread procedures for<br>
the two GUI cases. Fig. 7 is a flow chart illustrating the thread procedure for the case<br>
in which the GUI is an integral part of the client program. In this case the server<br>
program waits for connections from client programs. The server waits for a data<br>
packet #2. Then if the client IP address and MAC are authenticated it sends a data<br>
packet #3 with "Authenticated" flag. Alternatively, if the IP address and MAC are<br>
not authenticated then it sends packet #3 with a "Rejected" flag and the thread ends.<br>
Subsequently the server waits for data packet #8. If the user name and<br>
password are authenticated, the thread continues, otherwise it exits.<br>
The server then waits for subsequent requests from the client program, and<br>
terminates the thread on socket disconnect.<br>
Fig. 8 illustrates the thread procedure for the case in which the GUI is not an<br>
integral part of the client program.<br>
The server first receives the client IP address, user name and password from a<br>
packet #2. It then waits for a data packet #8 from the consequently named pipe. If the<br>
user name and password are authenticated, the thread continues, otherwise it exits.<br>
An attempt is made to connect to the client IP. If the connection succeeds the thread<br>
continues, otherwise it exits. The server then waits for data packet #2. If the client IP<br>
address and MAC are authenticated then it sends packet #3 with an "Authenticated"<br>
flag. If not, then it sends packet #3 with a "Rejected" flag and the thread ends.<br>
The server then waits for a disconnect of the named pipe or the socket, or<br>
socket packets or commands from the named pipes. It then terminates the thread on<br>
the socket or makes a named pipe disconnect. As long as it is still connected, client<br>
requests are processed, allowing for data mode operations on the mobile<br>
communication device. After handling the request, processing returns to receiving the<br>
next packet.<br>
During the existence of a connection two types of periodic messages are sent,<br>
regardless of the rest of the processing. Sync messages, made up of the sync packets<br>
described above in table 2, are preferably sent at regular intervals from the server<br>
program to the client program and vice versa.<br><br><br>
Furthermore, when a cellular device is connected to the client program, a data<br>
packet is sent at regular intervals to prevent the cellular device from exiting DM (Data<br>
Mode) and/or resetting.<br>
Reference was made above to the services which may be supported using the<br>
data mode of the cellular telephony device and which may be protected using the<br>
present embodiments. It is noted that each service request is preferably received at<br>
the server with the connected device's ESN. A short summary of each of the services<br>
listed above is now provided.<br>
Device initialization:<br>
Device initialization according to the preferred embodiments comprises<br>
writing a new ESN to the database, reading the A-KEY from the database, generating<br>
a new password for the device from a function of one or more of the NUM, ESN, A-<br>
KEY fields and random values, writing the password to the database, and setting the<br>
password in the device. Setting the password comprises sending the appropriate<br>
commands in data packets which, when written into the interface to which the cellular<br>
device is connected, are able to affect a password change. The server then waits for<br>
the appropriate response from the cellular device as received from the client program,<br>
makes additional necessary changes to the device and, if needed, replaces the<br>
operating system.<br>
OS upgrade:<br>
Upgrading the operating system according to the presently preferred<br>
embodiments comprises retrieving a device password, and replacing the operating<br>
system on the connected device. Replacing the operating system comprises sending<br>
the appropriate commands in data packets which, when written into the interface to<br>
which the cellular device is connected, affect an operating system change. The<br>
system then waits for the appropriate response from the cellular device as received<br>
from the client program.<br>
A-KEY change:<br>
Changing the A-Key, or writing the A-KEY on the connected device using the<br>
present embodiments comprises sending the appropriate commands in data packets<br><br>
which, when written into the interface to which the cellular device is connected, affect<br>
a change in the A-KEY field. The server then waits for the appropriate response from<br>
the cellular device as received from the client program.<br>
NUM change:<br>
Changing the NUM key or writing the NUM into the cellular device preferably<br>
comprises sending appropriate commands in data packets which, when written into<br>
the interface to which the cellular device is connected, affect a change in the NUM<br>
field. The server then waits for the appropriate response from the cellular device as<br>
received from the client program.<br>
Read phone book:<br>
Reading the phone book of a cellular device according to the present<br>
embodiments preferably comprises sending the appropriate commands in data packets<br>
which, when written into the interface to which the cellular device is connected,<br>
return the information stored in the device's phone book in it's own, proprietary<br>
format. The server then waits for the appropriate response from the cellular device as<br>
received from the client program. If the phone book information is in a valid format,<br>
it may then be converted into a more general format, for example that shown in table<br>
10 below.<br>
Write phone book:<br>
This service is only applicable if a phone book has been read and needs to be<br>
written somewhere. If the phone book can be converted to the connected device's<br>
proprietary format then it is so converted. Then the phone book is written into the<br>
next device by sending the appropriate commands in data packets which, when<br>
written into the interface to which the cellular device is connected, affect a phone<br>
book change.<br><br><br><br>
