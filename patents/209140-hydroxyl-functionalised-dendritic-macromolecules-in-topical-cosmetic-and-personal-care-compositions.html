HTDROXYL-FUNCTIONALISED DENDRITIC MACROMOLECULES IN TOPICAL COSMETIC AND PERSONAL CARE COMPOSITIONS<br>
Field cf the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to cosmetic and personal care compositions, such as hair styling compositions, containing. hydroxyl-functionalised dendritic macromolecules.<br>
Background and Prior Art<br>
Cosmetic and personal care compositions such as hair styling sprays, mousses, gels and shampoos, frequently contain resins, gums and adhesive polymers to provide a variety of benefits, for example, film-forming ability, thickening, sensory properties and hair shaping and setting.<br>
Such materials must meet a number of functional requirements.  These include for example good hair holding ability and curl retention without giving a harsh, brittle feeling to the hair.  Even under humid conditions there must be good hold and curl retention.  Another requirement is that the material be capable of being removed upon washing the hair at the time of shampooing.  Further important material properties are low stickiness and a lack of powdering or flaking.<br>
We have found that hydroxyl-functionalised dendritic macromolecules are a class of material that meets the above<br>
2<br><br>
requirements in a cosmetic and personal care composition, particularly hair styling compositions such as hairsprays.<br>
Dendritic macromolecules are macromolecules with densely branched structures having a large number of end croups. A dendritic polymer includes several layers or generations of repealing units which all contain one or more branch points. Dendritic polymers, including dendrimers and hyperbranched polymers, are prepared by condensation reactions of moncmeric units having at least two different types of reactive groups. Dendrimers are highly symmetric, whereas macromolecules designated as hyperbranched may to a certain-degree hold an asymmetry, yet maintaining the highly branched treelike structure.<br>
Dencritic macromolecules normally consist of an initiator or nucleus having one or more reactive sites and a number of branching layers and optionally a layer of chain terminating molecules. Continued replication of branching layers normally yields increased branch multiplicity and, where applicable or desired, increased number of terminal groups. The layers are usually called generations and the branches dendrons.<br>
These materials have found such diverse uses as catalysts (and catalyst supports), as selective membranes and coatings, as demulsifiers for oil-in- water emulsions, as wet strength agents in the manufacture of paper, as agents for modifying viscosities in aqueous formulations such as paints, as impact modifiers or as cross-linking agents in plastics, as carriers for agricultural, pharmaceutical and other substances, and as submicron size calibrators.<br>
3<br><br>
Certain dendritic polymers have been suggested for use in the context of personal care.<br>
WO97/14404 describes personal wash compositions containing an anionic surfactant as a cleaning agent and a cationic dendrimer as a mildness aid. The preferred cationic dendrirners are polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrirners prepared by sequential reactions of ethylenediamine and methyl acrylate.<br>
US 5 449 519  relates to keratolytic or anti-acne compositions in which the keratolytic or anti-acne agent (e.g. salicylic acid) is complexed with a starburst dendrimer of the PAMAM type.<br>
EP 0 880 961 and EP 880 962 describe anti-solar preparations for protection of skin and hair containing a hyperbranched or dendrimeric polyamino-polymer such as hyperbranched polyethyleneimine.<br>
EP 0 858 797 describes deodorant compositions comprising dendrirners having primary amine terminal groupings.<br>
EPO 884 047 relates to the use of polyamine polymers; which may be hyperbranched or dendrimeric, as antioxidant agents for cosmetic or dermatological compositions.<br>
WO 99/32076 and WO 99/32540 concern the use of certain specific disulphide-functionalised hyperbranched polymers and dendrirners in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals as thickening or gelling agents or as film-forming agents.<br>
EP 0 815 827 describes cosmetic compositions for treating the hair with a content of at least one dendrimer or<br>
4<br><br>
dendrimer conjugate in a cosmetic base. The compositions preferably contain dendrimers that are prepared from a 1,4-diaminobutane nucleus via the stepwise Michael addition of acrylonitrile followed by catalytic hydrogenation of cyano groups to amino groups. These dendrimers are referred to as poly(iminopropane-1,3-diyl) dendrimers with nitrile or amino terminal groups and their preparation is describes in US 5,530,092.  The compositions are said to provide an appreciable reduction in combing force, based on tests in aqueous solution comparing examples of the above described nitrile/amino functionalised dendrimers with standard hair care polymers such as vinylpyrrolidone/dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate copolymer.<br>
None of the above documents disclose or suggest the utility of dendritic polyols in cosmetic and personal care compositions such as hair styling compositions.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides a cosmetic and personal care composition comprising a hydroxyl-functionalised dendritic macromolecule.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
Hydroxyl-functionalised dendritic macromolecule<br>
The composition of the present invention preferably contains a hydroxyl-functionalised dendritic macromolecule that is ouilt up from polyester units.<br>
5<br><br>
Suitable materials are described in S3 468 771, which discloses a macromolecule which is composed of an initiator, having a: least one hydroxyl group, to which initiator is added at least one branching generation comprising at leas-one chain extender, having at least one carboxyl group and at least two hydroxyl groups.<br>
Further suitable materials are described in 3E 503 342, in which the macromolecule is substantially composed of a nucleus, having at least one epoxide group, to which nucleus is added at lease one  branching generation comprising at lease one chain extender, having at least three reactive functions of which at least one is a carboxyl or epoxide group and at least one is a hydroxyl group.<br>
The above described materials are also referred to as polyhydric polyester alcohols or hyperbranched polyols. Preferably these materials have at least eight, more preferably at least sixteen, most preferably at least thirty-two terminal hydroxyl groupings per macromolecule. Their molecular weight is preferably at least 800, more preferably at least 1600, most preferably at least 2500 g/mole.<br>
The above materials are available commercially from Perstorp A3, SE-2 84 SO Perstorp, Sweden under the trademark of 30LT0RN. Examples of such materials are B0LT0RN H10, BOLTORN H2 0, 30LT0RN H30 and BOLTORN H4 0, of which BOLTORN H3 0 and BOLTORN H4 0 are preferred.<br>
Cosmetic and Personal Care Compositions<br>
6<br><br>
Compositions of the present invention are preferably formulated into, hair care compositions, especially hairspray compositions, but can also be formulated into a wide variety of product types, including mousses, gels, lotions, tonics, sprays, shampoos, conditioners, rinses, hand and body lotions, facial moisturisers, sunscreens, anti-acne preparations, topical analgesics, mascaras, and the like. The carriers and additional components required to formulate such products vary with product type and can be routinely chosen by one skilled in the art. The following is a description of some of these carriers and additional components.<br>
Carriers<br>
Kair care compositions of the present invention can comprise a carrier, or a mixture of such carriers, which are suitable for application to the hair. The carriers are present at from about 0.5% to about 99.5%, preferably from about 5.0% to about 99.5%, more preferably from about 10.0% to about 98.0%, of the composition. As used herein, the phrase "suitable for application to hair" means that the carrier does not damage or negatively affect the aesthetics of hair or cause irritation to the underlying skin.<br>
Carriers suitable for use with hair care compositions of the present invention include, for example, those used in the formulation of hair sprays, mousses, tonics, gels, shampoos, conditioners, and rinses. The choice of appropriate carrier will also depend on the particular hydroxyl-funcuionalised dendritic macromolecule to be used, and whether the product formulated is meant to be left on the surface to which it is<br>
7<br><br>
aoplied (e.g., hair spray, mousse, tonic, or gel) cr rinsed off after use (e.g., shampoo, conditioner, rinse).<br>
The carriers used herein can include a wide range of components conventionally used in hair care compositions. The carriers can contain a solvent to dissolve or disperse the particular hydroxyl-functionaiised dendritic macromoiecule being used, with water, the C1-C6 alcohols, lower aikyi acetate and mixtures thereof being preferred. The carriers can also contain a wide variety of additional materials such as  acetone, hydrocarbons (such as isobutane, hexane, decene), halogenated hydrocarbons (such as Freons) and volatile silicones such as cyclomethicone.<br>
When the hair care composition is a hair spray, tonic, gel, or mousse the preferred solvents include water, ethanol, volatile silicone derivatives, and mixtures thereof. The solvents used in such mixtures may be miscible cr immiscible with each other. Mousses and aerosol hair sprays can also utilise any of the conventional propellants to deliver the material as a foam (in the case of a mousse) or as a fine, uniform spray (in the case of an aerosol hair spray). Examples of suitable propellants include materials such as-trichlorcfluoromethane, dichlorodifluoromethane, difluoroethane, dimethyiether, propane, n-butane or isobutane. A tonic or hair spray product having a low viscosity may also utilise an emulsifying agent. Examples of suitable emulsifying agents include nonionic, cationic, anionic surfactants, or mixtures thereof. If such an emulsifying agent is used, it is preferably present at a level of from about C.01% to about 7.5% by weight based on total weight of the composition. The level of propellant can be adjusted as desired but is generally from about 3% to<br>
8<br><br>
about 3 0% by weight based on total weight for mousse compositions and from about 15% to about 50% by weight based on total weight  for aerosol hair spray compositions. Suitable spray containers are well known in the art and inclu e conventional, non-aerosol pump sprays i.e., "atomisers", aerosol containers or cans having propellant, as described above, and also pump aerosol containers utilising compressed air as  the propellant.<br>
Where the hair care compositions are conditioners and rinses the carrier can include a wide variety of conditioning materials. Where the hair care compositions are shampoos, the carrier can include, for example, surfactants, suspending agents, and thickeners.<br>
The carrier can be in a wide variety of forms. For example, emulsion carriers, including oil-in-water, water-in-oil, water-in-oil-in-water, and oil-in-water-in-silicone emulsions, are useful herein. These emulsions can cover a broad range of viscosities, e.g., from about 100 cps to about 200,000 cps. These emulsions can also be delivered in the form of sprays using either mechanical pump containers or pressurised aerosol containers using conventional propellants. These carriers can also be delivered in the form of a mousse. Other suitable topical carriers include anhydrous liquid solvents such as oils, alcohols, and silicones (e.g., mineral oil, ethanol, isopropanol, dimethicone, cyclomethicone, and the like); aqueous-based single phase liquid solvents (e.g., hydro-alcoholic solvent systems); and thickened versions of these anhydrous and aqueous-based single phase solvents (e.g., where the viscosity of the solvent has been increased to form a solid<br>
9<br><br>
or semi-solid by the addition of appropriate gums, resins, waxes, polymers, salts, and the like).<br>

Overall, the formulations of Examples 1 to 3 were clearly preferred to the control on the positive attributes of strength of hold imparted to the hair and softness of feel imparted to the hair.<br>
The formulations of Examples 1 to 3 also gave perceivably less stickiness and deposits on the hair (both of which are undesirable attributes for a hairspray), compared with the control.<br>
Example 4<br>
The polyol(1) was evaluated by itself in ethanol solution for the properties of film formation, wash off and bond strength. The results were as follows:<br>
Film Formation:<br>
Films cast from 10% w/v ethanol solutions of polyol(2)<br>
produced clear non-tacky films.<br>
Wash Off:<br>
A hair swi (10.25g of 2 inch Spanish hair) was coated with a 5% w, Vethanol solution of polyol(2) and air dried for 3 hours. The switch was washed with water only and air dried overnight. No residues were visible and no material coating<br>
18<br><br>
could be felt. FT-IR AR analysis confirmed no polyol(1) present on hair surface.<br>
Bond Strength:<br>
Diastron MTT600 analysis of crossed hair fibres in which 1 microlitre of 5% w/v ethanol solution of polyol((2) had been pipetted onto the fibre-fibre junction showed that the :polyol(2) was capable of bonding to hair with an average bond strength of 18.38g.<br>
For the purposes of comparison, a PAMAM Starburst cendrimer generation i (ex Aldrich) was subjected to an equivalent evaluation for the properties of film formation, wash off and bond strength. In contrast, this material did not form films or bond to hair and showed inferior wash off properties.<br>
