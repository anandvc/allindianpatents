ABRASION-RESISTANNT YARNS, FIBRES OR FILAMENTS<br>
The present invention relates to yarns, fibres or filani'l its which have an improved abrasion resistance and which can be used in particular for the preparation of feits for paper-making machines- It relates more particulalarly to yarns, fibres or filaments based on polyar .de or on polyester.<br>
Thee properties which spun articles have to exhibit diffe.i according to their use. Mention may be made, among these properties, for example, of mechanical stren: ,h, transparency, gloss, whiteness, ability to be dyed, shrinkage, water-retaining capacity, flame retard mcy, stability and longevity towards heat, and the 1 .Jce. One property which may be required, in partic ilar for applications in industrial fields or "techr .cal yarn" fields, is abrasion resistance.<br>
1 &gt;is is the case, for example, with felts, which are o mposite structures comprising a stack of woven layers (obtained from continuous monofilaments) and of nonwo-c &gt;n layers (obtained from cut fibres) , the layers genera ,ly being assembled by needling* The increase in the ai :asion resistance generally makes it possible to increa ;e the lifetime of the articles manufactured from the y
T .is is also the case, for example, with carpets, includ ng fitted carpets, ropes and belts, nets or fabric \ used in the field of silk screen printing or filtra ion. In this case, the mechanical stresses from rubbin i or abrasion on these articles are such that the proper .y of abrasion resistance directly characterizes their  ifetime.<br><br>
\ known solution for improving the abrasion resi :i nee of spun articles is to increase the degree of r 1 inerization of the synthetic material from which thev ire manufactured. Thus it is that fibres rnanu u tured from thermoplastic resins with an incr n ingly high molecular mass are being developed. This L: crease in the molecular mass is reflected by an increk: e in the melt viscosity of the polymer. The spinn l g of fibres with a very high melt viscosity requi <s the use of very high spinning pressures and vi c temperatures which oan cause damag to polymer. a possible alternative disci i ed in patents us consi s producing yarns or fibres with conventional molec ar masses then increasing posteriori t l fibre case on felt viscosity h lymers. however there are limits this solut.cn- thus adds an additional stage proce requires chemical solutions compr. sing catalysts.></s>
j r other  known  solution  consists  in  spinning polymn in the melt viscosity is sought. This can be obtai) i   by virtue of the use of polymers comprising star   acromolecular chains.  The polymers comprising such  tar macromolecular chains  are,  for example, discl
An &gt;ther solution for improving the abrasion resista ice of the articles produced from fibres consist 5 in using articles exhibiting three-dimensional crimpinj, as disclosed in Patent CA 2 076 726.<br>

The yarns, fibres or filaments of the invention, comprising the polyamide Al and/or the polyester A2 in their polymer matrix, exhibit good abrasion resistance proper ties. They are in particular suitable for the manufacture of felts for paper-making machines. The use of the pclyamide Al or of the polyester A2 makes it possible to spin at a lower temperature and/or at a reduced pressure with respect to the conditions which would be necessary in the absence of the polyamide Al or of the polyes ;er A2. It is thus possible either to obtain yarns which exhibit better abrasion resistance or to obtain fibres with similar properties with a less restrictive process (in particular in operating temperature or in spinni lg pressure).<br>
Tie yarns, fibres and filaments according to the invent .on can comprise all the additives commonly used with , ;uch polymersr for example heat stabilizers, UV stabil^zers, catalysts, pigments and dyes, or antiba terial agents-<br><br>

Chara
•	Coi	ent of end groups<br>
r.	e contents of acid [COOH] and amine [NH2] end<br>
groupj	are quantitatively determined by potentiometry.<br>
•	CaJ ulation of the molar levels of chains<br>
cox asponding to the formulae (I) and (XI) described<br>
abc B  for the polymers of the invention<br>
I Examples 1 to 3 below, the polymers are compos J of a mixture of:<br>
-	Linear chains corresponding to the formula (II) and cc prising 2 different ends per chain (COOK and NH2)<br>
-	.inear chains corresponding to the formula (I) and cc prising 2 identical ends per chain (2 times COOH).<br>
I] this specific case, R3 is the hydroxyl radical and Rq is the hydrogen radical (as defined in the documei ) .<br>
Tl molar level of chains corresponding to the formulc (I) and (II) are estimated according to the followi g formulae:<br>
mc ar level (I) - ( [COOH]-[NH2] )/([COOH]+ [NH2] )<br>
mc ar level (II) = 2*fNH2] /([CO0HJ + [NH2] )<br>

Th	number-average  molecular  mass   [Mn]   is<br>

of the	.nvention, which correspond to linear polymers<br>
(Lhe t«	m "linear polymer" is understood to mean a<br>
polymer	composed  of  macromolecular  chains  each<br><br>
comprising 2 ends), use is made of the conventional formuj i [Ma] = 2 x 1CT6/ ([NH2] + (COOH] )<br>

•  Sta dardization of the pressure drop in the pack (sp nneret head)<br>
I . the various examples described below, a pressu e drop (expressed in bars) is measured when passin through the pack (spinneret head) composed of filtra ion elements and of capillaries. However, depend ng on the nature of the polymer, it is necessary to ad ust the temperature of the pack and of the polyme . This has the effect of changing the value of the p. essure drop. It is well known that the melt viscos ty of the polymers, or in this case the pressure drop, aries with the temperature according to a law of Arrhen us type which makes it possible, for example, from :he experimental values (temperature Ti and pressu e drop APi), to estimate the value of the pressu e drop AP2 at any another temperature T2. Furthe more, this calculation can be extended to the cases v'here the two spinning conditions additionally corres ond to different flow rates (when the variation in a) solute value IAQ/QI is less than 50%), respec ively Qi  and Q2:<br>
AP2 = Q2/Q1 * APi x Exp[E x (1/T2 - 1/Ti)/R] In thj 3    formula, Ti and T2 are expressed in degrees<br><br>
Kelvii E is the activation energy, expressed in J/mol, and R -s the perfect gas constant (R = 8-31 J/mol/K). In th 3 formula, the flow rate Q can be measured in a comply ;ely equivalent way at several levels. The simple &gt;t is to measure the count (the unit being the dtex, equal to the mass in g of 10 000 m of multi: .lament).<br>
Under  these  conditions,  Q  is  easily  obtained  by writi: \:<br>
Q  - t*v/10 000 In th: ; formula, the flow rate Q is expressed in g/min, the c
As aJ the tests were carried out with the same delive y rate, it is consequently sufficient to replac ■, in the preceding formula, the ratio of the flow i tes Q2/Q1 by the ratio of the counts t2/ti. In th

In thi-s test, already described in the literature (" ±&gt;rasion Resistant PA Fiber" lecture, Man-Made Fi &gt;er Congress, Dornbirn, Sept 2002}r a unitary fi .ament is subjected to a pretension of 3 g* The ya -n is immersed in a bath of water at 23°C. The fi .ament rubs against a ceramic bar with a diameter of ' TO mm, sold by Rothschild for the FFAB (Felt Fi Abrasion Tester) test, with surface ro nesses of Ra * 1.7 pm, Rz = 8.9 pm and Rm =11.3 pm. The bar is rotated at 300 re utions/minute with a contact angle of the yarn on  e bar (tension rail) of 90°.<br>
E ore the test, the filament is first of all desize beforehand for 1 hour in a Soxhlet assembly in petrol m ether and is then conditioned in a water bath at 25°  for 24 h.<br>
1 total number of revolutions before failure of the fi ment is recorded. This number is divided by the unit c mt of the strand in order to dispense with the count : the strand, which can vary from one test to anothe<br>
1 total, the experiment is repeated 30 times and the me   of the results is taken.<br>
