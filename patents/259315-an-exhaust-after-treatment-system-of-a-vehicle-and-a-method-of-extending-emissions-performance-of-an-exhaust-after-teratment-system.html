				<td>This application is related to U.S. Serial No. (To be assigned), filed<br>
on December 14, 2006 (GP-307049), entitled, "Method of Monitoring A Dosing<br>
Agent Supply For Treating Exhaust" and U.S. Serial No. (To be assigned), filed<br>
on December 14, 2006 (GP-308075-PTE-CD), entitled, "Emissions Conformance<br>
For An Exhaust After-Treatment System Having A Dosing Agent Supply". The<br>
disclosures of the above applications are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
FIELD<br>
 The present invention relates to vehicle exhaust systems, and<br>
more particularly to a diesel exhaust control during a limp-home mode.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
 Internal combustion engines combust to an air and fuel mixture to<br>
generate drive torque. The combustion process generates exhaust that is<br>
exhausted from the engine to atmosphere. The exhaust contains nitrogen oxides<br>
(NOx), carbon dioxide (C02) and carbon monoxide (CO) particulates. An exhaust<br>
after-treatment system treats the exhaust to reduce emissions prior to being<br>
released to atmosphere.<br><br>
 In an exemplary exhaust after-treatment system, a dosing system<br>
injects a dosing agent (e.g., urea) into the exhaust upstream of a catalyst. The<br>
exhaust and dosing agent mixture reacts over the catalyst to reduce the level of<br>
emissions. The dosing system includes a dosing agent supply and an injector.<br>
The amount of dosing agent injected is based on the level of emissions in the<br>
exhaust. If the dosing agent supply is empty or at a low level, insufficient dosing<br>
agent is injected into the exhaust stream, and emissions are not reduced as<br>
desired.<br>
 It is a concern that vehicle operators may not replenish the<br>
required dosing agent. As disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. Patent<br>
Application No. (To be assigned), filed on December 14, 2006, and entitled, Emissions Conformance For An Exhaust After Treatment System Having A<br>
Dosing Agent Supply', the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
reference, vehicle operation can enter a limp-home that limits the vehicle<br>
drivability to encourage the vehicle operator to replenish the dosing agent.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
 Accordingly, the present disclosure provides a method of extending<br>
emissions performance of an exhaust after-treatment system of a vehicle that<br>
includes a dosing agent. The method includes determining a level of a dosing<br>
agent source, selectively entering a limp-home mode based on the level and<br>
monitoring a catalyst temperature during said limp-home mode. Operation of an<br><br>
engine is regulate to increase the catalyst temperature when the catalyst<br>
temperature is less than a threshold catalyst temperature during the limp-home<br>
mode.<br>
 In one feature, the regulating includes throttling the engine.<br>
 In another feature, the regulating includes adjusting an air flow of<br>
the engine.<br>
 In another feature, the regulating includes adjusting a fueling rate<br>
of the engine.<br>
In other features, the method further includes post-injecting fuel<br>
into exhaust upstream of the catalyst. The post-injecting occurs when the<br>
catalyst temperature is greater than the threshold catalyst temperature.<br>
 In still another feature, the catalyst temperature is monitored<br>
based on a catalyst temperature sensor signal.<br>
 In yet another feature, the catalyst temperature is monitored<br>
based on a catalyst temperature model.<br>
 Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the<br>
description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>
intended to limit the scope of the present disclosure.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
 The following description of the preferred embodiment is merely<br><br>
exemplary in nature and is in no way intended to limit the invention, its<br>
application or uses. For purposes of clarity, the same reference numbers will be<br>
used in the drawings to identify similar elements. As used herein, the term<br>
module refers to an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic<br>
circuit, a processor (shared, dedicated or group) and memory that execute one<br>
or more software or firmware programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other<br>
suitable components that provide the described functionality.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 1, an exemplary vehicle system 10 is<br>
schematically illustrated. The vehicle system 10 includes an engine system 12, an<br>
exhaust after-treatment system 14. The engine system 12 includes an engine 16<br>
having a cylinder 18, an intake manifold 20 and an exhaust manifold 22. Air<br>
flows into the intake manifold 20 through a throttle 24. The air is mixed with fuel<br>
and the air and fuel mixture is combusted within the cylinder 18 to drive a piston<br>
(not shown). Although a single cylinder 16 is illustrated, it is appreciated that the<br>
engine 12 may include additional cylinders 18. For example, engines having 2, 3,<br>
4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 16 cylinders are anticipated. The fuel is provided from a<br>
fuel source 26 and is injected into the air stream using an injector 28. A fuel level<br>
sensor 30 is responsive to the amount of fuel within the fuel source 26.<br>
 Exhaust is produced through the combustion process and is<br>
exhausted from the cylinder 18 into the exhaust manifold 22. The exhaust after-<br>
treatment system 14 treats the exhaust flowing therethrough to reduce<br>
emissions before being released to the atmosphere. The exhaust after-treatment<br>
system 14 includes a dosing system 32, a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) 34, an<br><br>
emissions sensor 36 and a catalyst 38 that is preferably provided as a selective<br>
catalytic (SCR) catalyst. The DOC 34 reacts with the exhaust to reduce emission<br>
levels of the exhaust. The emissions sensor 36 is responsive to an emissions<br>
(e.g., NOx) level of the exhaust. It is also anticipated that a diesel particulate<br>
filter (DPF) 40 may be located downstream from the catalyst 30 that filters diesel<br>
particulates to further reduce emissions.<br>
 The exhaust after-treatment system 14 can optionally include a<br>
catalyst temperature sensor 39 that is responsive to a temperature of the<br>
catalyst 38 (TCAT) and that generates a temperature signal based thereon. The<br>
diesel exhaust control of the present disclosure can be implemented using the<br>
temperature sensor signal, as described in further detail below.<br>
 The dosing system 32 includes a dosing agent injector 42, a dosing<br>
agent storage tank 44 and a dosing agent supply sensor 46. The dosing system<br>
32 selectively injects a dosing agent (e.g., urea) into the exhaust stream to<br>
further reduce emissions. More specifically, the amount of the dosing agent is<br>
determined based on the signal generated by the exhaust sensor. The exhaust<br>
and dosing agent mixture reacts within the catalyst 38 to further reduce exhaust<br>
emissions.<br>
 A control module 50 regulates operation of the vehicle system 10<br>
based on the extended emissions conformance control of the present invention.<br>
More specifically, the control module 50 determines a dosing agent level<br>
(DALEVEL) based on the signal generated by the dosing agent supply sensor 46.<br><br>
The control module can calculate a vehicle range (RANGEDA) based on the<br>
amount of dosing agent remaining. More specifically, RANGEDA indicates the<br>
remaining drivable distance before the entire dosing agent is consumed.<br>
RANGEDA can be displayed on a display (not shown) to alert the vehicle<br>
operator.<br>
 If DALEVEL is below a first predetermined or low dosing agent threshold<br>
value (DALOW), the control module 50 sets a low dosing agent flag (FLAGDALOW)<br>
(e.g., equal to 1 or TRUE) indicating that the dosing agent level is low and<br>
should be refilled. Additionally, the control module 50 activates an indicator 52<br>
that alerts the vehicle operator that the dosing agent supply is low and should be<br>
refilled. The indicator 52 can be a visual and/or audible indication that alerts the<br>
vehicle operator to the low condition. If DALEVEL is below a second predetermined<br>
or empty dosing agent threshold value (DAEMPTY), the control module 50 sets an<br>
empty dosing agent flag (FLAGDAEMPTY) (e.g., equal to 1 or TRUE). Further, the<br>
control module 50 activates the indicator 52 to indicate that the dosing agent<br>
source 44 is empty. When the dosing agent source 44 is refilled and DALEVEL<br>
exceeds DAEMPTY and/or DALOW, FLAGDAEMPTY and/or FLAGDALOW is/are cleared and<br>
the indicator 52 is also cleared.<br>
 The extended emissions conformance control selectively impedes vehicle<br>
operation based on the dosing agent level. More specifically, if the dosing agent<br>
monitoring control determines that the vehicle is at a convenient location, a<br>
convenient location flag (FLAGCL) is set (e.g., equal to 1 or TRUE). A convenient<br>
location can include, but is not limited to, a fuel station, a maintenance workshop<br><br>
and/or an oil change workshop. If FLAGDALOW is set and the vehicle is stopped at<br>
a convenient location (i.e., a location where additional dosing agent is available)<br>
the extended emissions conformance control disables operation of the vehicle by<br>
setting a disable flag (FLAGDIS) until the dosing agent is replenished. It is also<br>
anticipated, however, that the vehicle operation need not be disabled even<br>
though the vehicle is at a convenient location, but can be impeded. More<br>
specifically, the vehicle operation can enter a limp-home mode, as described in<br>
further detail below.<br>
 The diesel exhaust control selectively impedes operation of the<br>
vehicle during the limp-home mode while meeting emissions requirements even<br>
in the absence of dosing agent. More specifically, TCAT is monitored during the<br>
operation in the limp-home mode. If TCAT is less than a threshold temperature<br>
(TTHR)/ engine operation is regulated to increase the exhaust gas temperatures,<br>
thereby increasing TCAT- TTHR corresponds to a temperature at which the catalyst<br>
38 is considered active. The exhaust gas temperature can be increased by<br>
engine throttling and air flow control. More specifically, the intake throttle can be<br>
placed in closed position in order to reduce engine air flow and air-to-fuel ratio.<br>
The turbocharger settings can also be modified to reduce air flow through the<br>
engine and to increase exhaust temperatures. Additionally and/or alternatively,<br>
the fuel injection timing can be retarded to further increase the exhaust gas<br>
temperatures.<br>
 In one feature, TCAT can be directly measured using the<br>
temperature sensor 39. In an alternative feature, TCAT can be determined based<br><br>
on a catalyst temperature model that is processed by the control module 50.<br>
More specifically, engine speed, air flow and fuel quantity can be used as inputs<br>
for a catalyst temperature model.<br>
 Once TCAT exceeds TTHR, small amounts of fuel can be post-injected<br>
(i.e. injected into a cylinder just after a combustion event), such that the fuel is<br>
expelled from the cylinder with the exhaust and flows to the exhaust after-<br>
treatment system 14. The heat energy of the catalyst 38 includes combustion of<br>
the fuel, thereby maintaining TCAT above TTHR or increasing TCAT- The diesel<br>
exhaust control continues to operate the engine in this manner to maintain<br>
acceptable catalyst temperatures (i.e whereby the catalyst is active) and<br>
emissions control. Once the dosing agent is replenished and the limp-home<br>
mode is exited, the engine system 12 can be operated using normal control<br>
strategies.<br>
 In accordance with other features of the present disclosure when<br>
FLAGDAEMPTY is set and FLAGa is not set (i.e., when the vehicle is not deemed to<br>
be at a convenient location), the limp-home mode is entered, whereby vehicle<br>
operation is impeded. Vehicle operation can be impeded by relaxing the<br>
drivability and fuel economy constraints, and employing more aggressive modes<br>
of combustion that reduce emissions. In one feature, pre-mixed charge<br>
compression ignition (PCCI) combustion is extensively used. PCCI combustion is<br>
known to significantly reduce NOx and particulate emissions, however, it may<br>
decrease fuel economy and increase engine noise. In an alternative feature,<br>
fueling levels are reduced. By lowering the fueling levels, engine power levels,<br><br>
N0X and particulate emissions are correspondingly reduced. At the same time,<br>
TCAT is monitored and controlled in accordance with the diesel exhaust control<br>
described above.<br>
 In an alternative feature, vehicle operation is impeded when<br>
FLAGDALOW is set. In this manner, the remaining dosing agent can be utilized in<br>
hand with the above-described engine operating modes, to maximize emissions<br>
performance while extending the dosing agent range. At the same time, TCAT is<br>
monitored and controlled in accordance with the diesel exhaust control described<br>
above. For example, the fueling levels can be reduced based on DALEVEL to<br>
reduce emissions, and at the same time, the remaining dosing agent can be<br>
used to further reduce emissions below the desired level. By combining fueling<br>
level reduction and dosing agent emissions reduction, the drivability and fuel<br>
economy are not as adversely affected as would be by reducing fueling levels<br>
alone to achieve the desired emissions performance. However, if TCAT does not<br>
exceed TTHR, the engine system 12 is operated as described above to increase<br>
TCAT-<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps will be described in<br>
detail. In step 202, control monitors DALEVEL- Control calculates and displays<br>
RANGEDA in step 204 based on DALEVEL In step 206, control determines whether<br>
DALEVEL is less that DALow- If DALEVEL is not less that DALow , control clears all<br>
dosing agent related flags in step 208 and control ends. If DALEVEL is less thanl<br>
DALOW , control determines whether DALEVEL is less than DAEMPTY in step 210. If<br>
DALEVEL is not less that DAEMPTY , control sets FLAGDALOW in step 212 and control<br><br>
continues in step 213. If DALEVEL is less than DAEMPTY, control sets FLAGDAEMPTY in<br>
step 216 and control continues in step 218.<br>
 in step 218, control determines whether FLAGCa is set. If FLAGa<br>
is not set, control continues in step 213. If FLAGa is set, control sets FLAGDS in<br>
step 220. Control disables vehicle operation in step 222 and continues in step<br>
214. In step 213, control impedes vehicle operation by implementing one of or a<br>
combination of the strategies discussed in detail above. In step 214, control<br>
displays the dosing agent status based on the dosing agent related flags and<br>
control ends. For example, 'Dosing Agent Low', "Dosing Agent Empty" or "Vehicle<br>
Disable Due To Empty Dosing Agent" messages can be displayed.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 2, exemplary steps to determine whether the<br>
vehicle is stopped at a convenient location will be described in detail. In step<br>
300, control determines whether an engine start just occurred. If an engine start<br>
occurred, control continues in step 302. If an engine start did not occur, control<br>
continues in step 304.<br>
 In step 302, control determines FUELLEVEL. In step 306, control<br>
determines AFUEUEVEL as the difference between FUELLEVEL and the fuel level<br>
that was stored in memory immediately prior to the last engine shut - off event.<br>
In step 308, control determines whether ΔFUELLEVEL is greater than a threshold<br>
difference (ΔTHR). If AFUEUEVEL is greater than ΔTHR, control determines that the<br>
vehicle was refueled during the most recent shut-down and continues in step<br><br>
310. If ΔFUELLEVEL is not greater than ΔTHR, control determines that the vehicle<br>
was not refueled during the most recent shut-down and continues in step 312.<br>
 In step 304, control continuously monitors FUEUEVEL- In step 314,<br>
control determines whether FUEUEVEL is increasing at a rate (e.g. dFL/dft)<br>
greater than a threshold rate (e.g. dFL/dtTHR)- If dFL/dt is greater than dFL/dtmR,<br>
control determines that the vehicle is being refueled and continues in step 310.<br>
If dFLydt is not greater than dFL/dtrHR, control determines that the vehicle is not<br>
being refueled and continues in step 312. In step 310, control sets FLAGa. In<br>
step 312, control stores the new or most recent FUEUEVEL into memory and<br>
control ends.<br>
 Although the diesel exhaust control is described in detail above<br>
using the fuel station scenario as an example. It is appreciated that the diesel<br>
exhaust control can monitor other scenarios including, but not limited to,<br>
maintenance and/or oil change to determine whether the vehicle is located in a<br>
convenient location. For example, the diesel exhaust control can monitor vehicle<br>
maintenance flags stored in memory and determine that the vehicle is at a<br>
convenient location if one or more maintenance related flags are set or reset.<br>
Alternatively, the diesel exhaust control can monitor an oil level or an oil<br>
characteristic. For example, if the oil level (OIUEVEL) increases or an oil<br>
parameter (OILPAR) (e.g., including, but not limited to, electrical impedance)<br><br>
indicates that an oil change has just occurred, the diesel exhaust control can<br>
determine that the vehicle is at a convenient location to refill the dosing agent.<br>
 It is further anticipated that another input can be implemented to<br>
determine whether the vehicle is at a convenient location. For example, a global<br>
positioning system (GPS) may be implemented, such as that provided with a<br>
vehicle equipped with an OnStar™ system. The GPS can generate a signal<br>
indicating that the vehicle is at a convenient location.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 4, exemplary steps that we are executed<br>
by the diesel exhaust control during the limp-home mode will be described in<br>
detail. In step 400, control determines whether the vehicle is being operated in<br>
the limp-home mode. If the vehicle is not being operated in the limp-home<br>
mode, control ends. If the vehicle is being operated in the limp-home mode,<br>
control determines TCAT in step 402.<br>
 In step 404, control determines whether TCAT is greater than TTHR.<br>
If TCAT is not greater than TTHR, control regulates engine operation to increase<br>
TCAT in step 406 and loops back to step 402. If TCAT is greater than TTHR, control<br>
regulates engine operation per a limp-home mode strategy and to maintain TCAT<br>
and control ends.<br>
 Referring now to Figure 5, exemplary modules that execute the<br>
extended emissions conformance control of the present invention will be<br>
described in detail. The exemplary module include a FLAGDALOW module 500, a<br><br>
a FLAGEMPTY module 502, a RANGEDA module 504, a FLAGa module 506, a display<br>
module 508, an AND module 510, an indicator module 512, a disable module<br>
514, a limp-home module 516 and a TCAT module 517. The FLAGDALOW module<br>
500, the FLAGEMPTY module 502 and the RANGEDA module 504 can be individual<br>
modules or can be sub-modules within a larger module 518.<br>
 The FLAGDALOW module 500 selectively sets FLAGDALOW based on<br>
DALEVEL and DALOW- Similarly, the FLAGDAEMPTY module 502 selectively sets<br>
FLAGDAEMPTY based on DALEVEL and DAEMPTY. The RANGEDA module 504 calculates<br>
RANGEDA based on DALEVEL- The FLAGCL module 506 selectively sets FLAGo. based<br>
on FUELLEVEL, OILLEVEL and/or OILPAR. It is also anticipated that FLAGa based on<br>
FUEUEVEL/ OIUEVEL and/or OILPAR. It is also anticipated that FLAGa can be<br>
selectively set based on maintenance flags or any other factor that would<br>
indicate the vehicle is at a convenient location. Furthermore, FLAGa can be set<br>
based on another input, such as a signal generated by a GPS, as described<br>
above. The display module 508 graphically displays RANGEDA to alert the vehicle<br>
operator to the remaining distance the vehicle can travel before the dosing agent<br>
source is empty or below a desired level.<br>
 The AND module 510 generates a signal based on FLAGDAEMPTY and<br>
FLAGa- For example, if both FLAGDAEMPTY and FLAGa are set. (e.g. equal to 1)<br>
the AND module 510 outputs a signal indicating that the dosing agent is empty<br>
and the vehicle is located at a convenient location. The indicator module 512<br>
generates an indication an indication signal (e.g., audible and/or visual) based on<br>
FLAGDAEMPTY or FLAGDALOW to alert the vehicle operator to the status of the dosing<br><br>
agent source. The disable module 514 selectively disables vehicle operation<br>
based on the output of the AND module 510. More specifically, the disable<br>
module 514 generates control signal that disable vehicle operation until the<br>
dosing agent source is replenished.<br>
 The limp-home module 516 selectively regulates the vehicle<br>
operation based on TCAT, FLAGDAEMPTY/ the output of the AND module 510,<br>
FLAGDALOW and/or DALEVEL. More specifically, the limp-home module 516<br>
implements one of or a combination of the strategies described in detail above,<br>
and generates corresponding control signals. The TCAT module 517<br>
determines TCAT module 517 determines TCAT and provides it to the limp-home<br>
module 516.<br>
 Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description<br>
