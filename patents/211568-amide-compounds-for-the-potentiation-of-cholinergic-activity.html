Test<br>
Penile erection in rat<br>
(This test was carried out according to a similar manner to that described in Jpn. J. Pharmacol., Vol. 64, 147-153 (1994) )<br>
(i)  Method<br>
Male Fischer 344 rats at the age of 8 weeks (n^7) were used.  All rats were handled 3 minutes a day for three successive days before the tests-  The rats were tested in groups of seven and various doses of the test compound were given in semi-randomized order.  The test compounds were suspended in 0*5% methyl-cellulose immediately before use, and given intraperitoneally in a volume of 1 ml/kg just before the start of test.  Immediately after injection, each rat was placed in a perspex box (25x2-5x35 cm) and its behavior was observed for 60 minutes, during which time the number of penile erections was counted,  A mirror was situated behind each box to facilate of the rat.  Data was expressed as a mean number.<br><br>
It is clear that the compound having the above-mentioned activity ameliorates the memory deficits (i.e. amnesia^.<br><br>
dementia, etc.) from the description in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics, Vo, 279, No. 3, 1157-1173 (1996),  Further, it is expected that the compound having the above-mentioned activity is useful as therapeutical and/or preventive agent for aforesaid diseases from some patent applications (e.g. PCT International Publication No, WO 98/27930, etc.).<br>
For therapeutic purpose, the compound [I] and a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of the present invention can be used in a form of pharmaceutical preparation containing one of said compounds, as an active ingredient, in , admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier such as an organic or inorganic solid, semi-solid or liquid excipient suitable for oral or parenteral administration.  The pharmaceutical preparations may be capsules, tablets, dragees, granules, suppositories, solution, suspension, emulsion, or the like.  If desired, there may be included in these preparations, auxiliary substances, stabilizing agents, wetting or emulsifying agents, buffers and other commonly used additives.<br>
While the dosage of the compound [I] will vary depending upon the age and condition of the patient, an average single dose of about 0.1 mg, 1 mg, 10 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 250 mg, 500 mg and 1000 mg of the compound [I] may be effective for treating the above-mentioned diseases*  In general, amounts between 0.1 mg/body and about 1,000 mg/body may be administered per day.<br>
