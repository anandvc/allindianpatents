				<td>METHOD AND SYSTEM FOR USING A COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK TO ARCHIVE AND RETRIEVE BIBLIOGRAPHY INFORMATION AND REFERENCE MATERIAL<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to publishing and, more particularly, to a method and system for using a communications network such as the Internet to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material cited in a manuscript.<br>
Background Art<br>
Authors of manuscripts and documents such as books and research papers frequently cite material such as articles and other books in a bibliography section. The bibliography section is usually attached to the end of the manuscript. (The terms "Works Cited" and "References" mean the same. Each is a list of words that have been cited by an author, or works to which an author has made a reference. However, the term "Bibliography" stands for a list of all the material an author has consulted in preparing a manuscript irrespective of whether or not it has been cited.) Herein, the term "Bibliography" also represents the terms "Works Cited" and "References".<br>
The entire manuscript including the bibliography section is then copied for distribution to an audience. The author uses the cited reference material as a source of information for writing the manuscript. Traditionally, the reference material has been limited to physical media such as other books, research papers, newspaper and magazine articles, and the like. Occasionally, personal .<br>
communications (regular mail), works-in-progress (interim reports, confidential reports), are also cited by authors of manuscripts.<br>
However, information available on websites on the World Wide Web, e.g, the Internet, has become an indispensable source for research on several . areas of interest and often makes a study more comprehensive. Information can be retrieved instantly from the Internet at any time from any location and may incorporate the most current news. Web based information is not merely an electronic version of a physical publication (such as newspapers and magazines) but is rather a standalone medium with no physical equivalents or limitations (i.e., page size).<br>
Authors and researchers are now starting to cite information from websites in their manuscripts. Various professional bodies have issued protocols for citing web content. In the bibliography section, authors generally include three pieces of information when citing web content. The first piece of information is the address of the website such as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL), for instance, www.website.com. The second piece of information is the date of access of the website (by the author) and the third piece of information is the last modified date of the website.<br>
A problem with citing websites as sources of information is that 1) websites are subject to frequent, invisible modifications and 2) may be moved to a new address or removed from the Internet without notice. Moreover, material from a website once accessible to everyone may now be limited to a select audience. Even hypertext essays (published on the Internet itself) now often contain a list of other websites used in that study. <br>
An important reason for citing references from any source including the Internet and traditional published material is to enable verification of the material used from the references. The bibliography section of a manuscript also becomes a resource of information for other researchers in that field. Referees of research papers, editors, other researchers and the audience of the manuscript need to review/verify the information taken from the cited references. Traditionally, the bibliography information is either given in alphabetical order or the order in which the material was used in the manuscript, with a description of the journal or magazine from which it was taken (source), title of the particular essay, editor or author name, volume number of the journal or magazine, date of publication, and particular pages where the content was assimilated. Such information enabled easy review/verification of the bibliography information or reference material.<br>
The problem with citing a website is that the fluid, ever modifiable potential of the content of the website does not guarantee availability and true verification of the material actually used by the author.<br>
Further, information given out by interacting members of news groups (another Internet source) and through personal communication methods such as e-mails that are cited by an author as references cannot be verified by a third party unless the information is reproduced verbatim by the author in the content of the manuscript or in the bibliography section. Authors may also cite works in progress (such as unpublished interim reports) and information obtained through personal communication methods such as regular mail. However, the problem of the inability to review/verify such material also ails these sources.<br>
While traditional publishers generally act as authenticators for the material printed and circulated by them there exists no credibility checking service or protocol for information available over the Internet. Search engines used for selecting websites by keywords give worthy, mediocre, and worthless websites equal importance. So, while it can be considered safe to look up and use content published in a magazine or journal, which are thus authenticated, it might be risky to use content from most web sites (that don't have any means of authentication) in a manuscript.<br>
As such, in light of the affect the cited web based material might have had on a given manuscript, it becomes important for referees, editors, other researchers, and the audience of the manuscript to ascertain the credibility of the cited information available on those Internet websites (sources). The same can be said of hitherto non-verifiable sources such as interim reports, e-mails, communication on newsgroups/userforums, personal communications (regular mail) and the like.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material cited in a manuscript.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material from an Internet source such as a website cited in a manuscript. <br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive a copy of information from an Internet source cited in a manuscript.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive a copy of information from an Internet source cited in a manuscript for retrieval by users of the manuscript to enable verification of the cited Internet source information.<br>
It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material from personal communications such as e-mails and regular mail cited in a manuscript.<br>
It is still yet another object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material from a digital medium such as audio digital files, video digital files, and graphics digital files cited in a manuscript.<br>
It is still yet a further object of the present invention to provide a method and system for using a communications network to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material from traditional physical sources of information such as books and magazines, interim reports, and works-in- progress cited in a manuscript.<br>
In carrying out the above objects and other objects, the present invention provides a system for archiving reference material in a bibliography of a manuscript using a communications network such as the Internet. The system includes a first communications device connected to the communications network for an author of a manuscript to use. The author uses the first communications device to transfer identification of reference material cited by the author in the manuscript to the communications network. A second communications device is connected to the communications network for an audience of the manuscript use. The audience uses the second communications device to request and receive a copy of the reference material cited by the author in the manuscript from the communications network.<br>
A database is connected to the communications network to communicate with the author and the audience via the communications network. The database receives the identification of reference material cited by the author from the author. The database stores a copy of the reference material and a distinctive key associated with the copy of the reference material. The database transmits a copy of the reference material to the audience in response to receiving a request from the audience for a copy of the reference material.<br>
The database may transmit the distinctive key associated with the copy of the reference material to the author. In response, the author cites the distinctive key associated with the copy of the reference material in the manuscript. The audience then obtains the distinctive key from the manuscript and then transmits a request having the distinctive key to the database. The database transmits a copy of the reference material to the audience in response to receiving the request having the distinctive key.<br>
The reference material cited by the author in the manuscript may be a website, an e-mail, a digital file, traditional media such as a paper book or magazine, an interim report, and the like. If the reference material is a website the database receives a copy of the website from the Internet for storage and then transmits a copy of the website to the audience in response to receiving the request<br>
from the audience for a copy of the website. If the reference material is an e-mail<br>
i<br>
the database receives a copy of the e-mail from the author via the Internet for storage and then transmits a copy of the e-mail to the audience in response to receiving the request from the audience for a copy of the e-mail. If the reference material is stored as a digital file the database receives a copy of the digital file from the author via the Internet for storage and then transmits a copy of the digital file to the audience in response to receiving a request from the audience for a copy of the e-mail. If the reference material is a paper book, photograph, an interim report, or the like the database receives an electronic scanned copy of the paper book/reference material from the author via the Internet for storage and then transmits an electronic copy of the paper book/reference material to the audience in response to receiving a request from the audience for an electronic copy of the paper book/reference material.<br>
In carrying out the above objects and other objects, the present invention further provides a method for archiving reference material in a bibliography of a manuscript using a communications network such as the Internet, a first communications device connected to the communications network for an author of a manuscript to use, a second communications device connected to the communications network for an audience of the manuscript to use, and a database connected to the communications network to communicate with the author and the audience via the communications network.<br>
The method includes transmitting identification of reference material cited by the author in the manuscript to the communications network from the first <br>
communications device. The identification of the reference material cited by the author is then received at the database. A distinctive key is then associated with the reference material cited by the author. A copy of the reference material cited by the author and the associated distinctive key are then stored at the database. A request for a copy of the reference material is then transmitted from the audience to the database using the second communications device. A copy of the reference material is then transmitted from the database to the audience in response to the database receiving the request for a copy of the reference material from the audience. The distinctive key associated with the copy of the reference material is given by the database to the author. The distinctive key associated with the copy of the reference material may then be cited in the manuscript by the author. The distinctive key is then obtained from the manuscript by the audience. The transmitted request to the database may then include the distinctive key.<br>
The advantages associated with the method and system of the present invention are numerous. The method and system of the present invention advantageously fill the deficiency associated with conventional bibliographic processes by identifying traditionally non-verifiable reference material cited in a manuscript with a distinctive key and then archiving a copy of the reference material on a database connected to a communications network such as the Internet. The audience of the manuscript may then access the reference material from the database by using the distinctive key for review and verification of the reference material. As a result, the method and system of the present invention protect the cited information from continuous modification and removal of the reference material by providing an avenue for the audience to gain access to an exact copy of the reference material cited by the author of the manuscript. Further, the method and system of the present invention provide a means of verification of the reference material.<br>
The above objects and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from the following detailed description of the best mode for carrying out the present invention when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>

Best Modes For Carrying Out The Invention<br>
In general, the present invention is a method and system for using a communications network such as the Internet, wired and wireless data communications networks, and the like to archive and retrieve bibliography information and reference material cited in a manuscript. In operation, an author cites material from an information source such as an Internet source in the manuscript and then adds information identifying the Internet source into the bibliography section of the manuscript. The reference material from the Internet source may be from a website. The Internet source identification information may include the address of the website, i.e, the uniform resource locator (URL), the date of access of the website by the author, and the last modified date of the website. ' The website identification information is then transferred to the Internet for storage on a database associated with the manuscript. In addition to the website identification information, a copy of the website information is also transferred to the Internet for storage on the database. The database assigns a permanent distinctive key (other than the URL identifying the website) to the website identification information and the copy of the website. The distinctive key can then be used by readers of the manuscript to gain access to the website information cited by the author of the manuscript as the website stood on the date of submission by the author to the database.<br>
The database acts as the bibliography of the manuscript by including a listing of information for each website cited in the manuscript. However, the database is more than a bibliography in that a copy in verbatim of each website used by the author is also stored on the database. In effect, the database archives the reference material for subsequent retrieval. Accordingly, if the website is modified or removed from the Internet after the date of access by the author or after the manuscript is distributed to an audience, the audience may access the database to retrieve the actual website information used by the author for review and verification.<br>
Additionally, the method and system of the present invention extend to the identification and archival of other reference material ouch as works-in- progress, e-mails, regular mail, digital files, and traditional physical media by assigning a distinctive key to a copy of each such material and storing the distinctive key and the copy in the database for subsequent retrieval from the database.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, a block diagram of a system 10 for use with the present invention is shown. System 10 includes a communications network such as the Internet 12. An author 14 of a manuscript or document and an audience 16 of the manuscript are connected with the Internet 12 for transferring and receiving information from the Internet. A database 18 is also connected to Internet 12 for transferring and receiving information from the Internet. Author 14 uses the Internet 12 to cite reference material from Internet sources in the manuscript. The Internet sources may be websites on the Internet 12. Author 14 includes a bibliography section with the manuscript for listing the identification of the reference materials from the Internet sources and other sources. The bibliography section is intended to be reviewed by audience 18 for reviewing and verifying the reference material cited by author 14 in the manuscript. It is noted that the manuscript may be published or remain unpublished.<br>
When citing a website as reference material in the manuscript, author 14 cites information identifying the website in the bibliography section of the manuscript. The identification information of the website in the bibliography section includes the address of the website such as a URL, the date of access of the website by the author, and the last modified date of the website. Author 14 then transfers to the Internet 12 information identifying the website as shown in FIG. 1. The website identification information transferred to the Internet 12 includes the address of the website. In response to author 14 transferring the website identification information to the Internet 12, database 18 receives from the Internet the website identification information and a copy of the reference material of the website, i.e., a copy of the website. The copy of the website is verbatim to the website on the Internet 12 when author 14 transferred the website identification information to the Internet. Database 18 then stores or archives the website identification information with the copy of the website.<br>
Database 18 assigns a permanent distinctive key (other than the URL identifying the website) to the website identification information and the copy of the website. Author 14 includes the distinctive key in the bibliography section with the website identification information. Audience 16 of the manuscript may then access the Internet 12 to retrieve the copy of the website cited in the manuscript and in the bibliography section. In response to a request by audience 16 to the Internet 12 for access to the copy of the website, database 18 transfers the archived copy of the website to the audience via the Internet. As part of the request, audience 16 transfers the distinctive key provided by author 14 in the bibliography section of the manuscript to database 18 via the Internet 12. Database 18 uses the distinctive key to understand what reference material audience 16 is requesting. Audience 16 can then review the reference material from the website cited in the manuscript by author 14 for verification. The copy of the website provided by database 18 to audience 16 is an exact copy of the <br>
website when author 14 cited the website in the manuscript and submitted to database 18.<br>
In effect, database 18 acts as a partial bibliography of the manuscript by including a listing of information for each website cited in the manuscript, and further includes a copy in verbatim of each website used by author 14. Database 18 archives the website for subsequent retrieval such that if the website is modified or removed from the Internet 12 subsequent to the author citing the website audience 16 may access the database to retrieve the actual website used by the author for review and verification.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, a flow chart 20 describing operation of the method and system of the present invention is shown. Flow chart 20 begins with author 14 reviewing a website on the Internet 12 for reference material as shown in block 22. Upon finding reference material of interest, author 14 transfers the website address to database 18 via the Internet 12 as shown in block 24. A copy of the website referenced by author 14 is then also transferred to database 18 via the Internet 12 as shown in block 26. This copy may be sent from the Internet 12 to database 18 in response to a request for such copy by the database. Database 18 stores and archives the website address and the copy of the website for subsequent retrieval. Database 18 archives this information because either the website address or the website itself may possibly be removed or altered after being cited by author 14. By archiving this information database 18 ensures that a verbatim copy of the website as cited by author 14 may be accessible for later study and verification. As part of the archiving process, database 18 associates a distinctive key (other than the URL) with the website address and the copy of the website as shown in block 28.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 3, a graphical user interface 50 for use by author 14 to transfer the address of a cited website to database 18 is shown. Graphical user interface 50 is part of a communications system enabling communication between author 14 and database 18 via the Internet 12. Graphical user interface 50 includes an Internet source address entiy 52 and a distinctive key entry 54. Author 14 enters the address of a cited website in Internet source address entry 52. For instance, the address is "www.WebSiteChannel.com" as shown in FIG. 3. Author 14 then enters a distinctive key to be associated with the cited website in distinctive key entry 54. For instance, the distinctive key is "WebSiteChannel Al" as shown in FIG. 3. (Alternatively, the distinctive key may be assigned by database 18 and then given by the database to author 14 as described above.) Upon entering the required information, author 14 presses a submit button 56 to transfer the entered information to database 18 via the Internet 12. Database 18 then accesses the Internet 12 to receive a copy of the website at the time of submission of the entered information by author 14. Database 18 archives the entered information, i.e., the website address and the distinctive key, with the copy of the website.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a graphical user interface 60 for use by audience 18 to receive a copy of the cited website from database 18 is shown. Graphical user interface 60 is part of a communications system enabling communication between audience 16 and database 18 via the Internet 12. Graphical user interface 60 includes an Internet source retrieve entry 62. Audience 16 enters the distinctive key associated with the cited website in Internet source retrieve entry 62. Upon entering the requested distinctive key information, audience 16 presses a submit button 64 to request database 18 via the Internet 12 to provide the audience with a copy of the cited website. In response to the request, database 18 transfers a copy of the cited website to audience 16 via the <br>
Internet 12. Audience 16 may then study and verify the cited website with the manuscript.<br>
In addition to archiving website information, database 18 is further operable for archiving copies of other reference materials cited in a manuscript such as works-in-progress, e-mails, regular mail, digital files such as audio files, video files, and graphics files, and traditional physical media such as paper books and magazines. For example, the reference material cited by author 14 in a manuscript is an e-mail. In this case, author 14 transfers a copy of the cited e-mail to database 18 via the Internet 12. In response to receiving the e-mail copy database 18 associates a distinctive key with the e-mail copy and then stores the distinctive key with the e-mail copy. Author 14 then cites the e-mail with the distinctive key in the bibliography section of the manuscript. In reviewing the manuscript, audience 16 then transfers the distinctive key to database 18 via the Internet for requesting a copy of the cited e-mail for verification. Database 18 then transfers the e-mail copy to audience 16 in response to the request from the audience. Audience 16 may then review the e-mail copy for verification.<br>
As can be readily understood, the reference material may be any type of material that can be stored by database 18. For example, any digital file can be stored by database 18. Similarly, traditional physical media such as paper books can also be stored in database 18 by scanning a portion or the.entire paper book into a digital file. Further, audio/video files such as "ON24" news'clips currently on the Internet may also be stored by database 18.<br>
Further, the method and system of the present invention are useful with reference material that are kept in secrecy for a period of time. For example, reference material may be restricted from being distributed to audience 16 for a period of time. The reference material may be a completed manuscript having some sort of secrecy order or may be a partially finished manuscript that author 14 does not wish audience 16 to see until completed. Author 14 transfers the completed or partially finished reference material and information of when the reference material will be available to audience 16 to database 18. Database 18 stores and associates a distinctive key with the reference material and the reference material availability information. Audience 18 may then use the distinctive key to access database 18 for the reference material to review and verify. In response, database 18 transfers the reference material availability information to audience 16. If the reference material is not yet available to audience 16, the reference material availability information may say that the reference material will be available in the future and request the audience to check back at the appropriate time. Upon the expiration of the time period and after author 14 has transferred a completed reference material to database 18, the database transfers to audience 16 upon request a copy of the reference material stored on the database.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, an example of a bibliography section 70 in accordance with the method and system of the present invention is shown. Bibliography section 70 is attached to an end of a manuscript written by author 14. Author 14 uses bibliography section 70 to list all of the references that were cited in the manuscript. For instance, bibliography section 70 includes an website reference 72 (bibliography reference #1) having the address "www.WebSiteChannel.com" and the associated distinctive key "WebSiteChannelAl" as shown in FIG. 5. Bibliographic reference #2 is also a website. Similarly, bibliography section 70 includes a paper book reference 74 entitled "Engines" and authored by Heywood. Paper book reference 74 includes the distinctive key "Engines-Heywood" as shown in FIG. 5. Bibliography <br>
references #4, #5, and #6 are e-mail, digital audio file, and regular mail references.<br>
Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the present invention, a method and system for using the Internet to archive and • retrieve bibliography information and reference material cited in a manuscript that fully satisfy the objects, aims, and advantages set forth above. While the present invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
