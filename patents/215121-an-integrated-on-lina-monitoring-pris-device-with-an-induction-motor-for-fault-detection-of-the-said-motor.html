				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to an apparatus for Induction motor monitoring and fault detection and accurate assessoment of the condition of such motors. The apparatus uses state of the art digital signal processing (DSP) electronics.<br>
Induction motors are widely used in industries, particularly in power plants for critical auxiliaries like boiler feed pump, ID fan, FO fan and PA fan. Sudden failure of a motor in such critical areas will result in loss of valuable power generation.<br>
The present mointoring system of such induction motors comprises besides a number of protection devices, different meters which continously display voltages, currents, temperatures and overall vibration levels.<br>
There are disadvantages associated with a present system of monitoring and fault detection of Induction motors.<br>
One of the main disadvantages with the existing monitoring system is that it will not provide the full information needed to asses the condition of the motor. For example, one of the motors might have had a motor bar failure. A simple measurement of current magnitude will not give any indication of the fault.<br>
Another disadvantages with the existing monitoring system is that in case of mechanical faults which may not cause appreciable increase in the overall vibration level and remains undetected.<br>
Yet another disadvantage with the existing monitoring system is that in case where overall vibration level is high, it Mill not be able to assign a specific cause and maintenance personel will have to resort to the costly option of opening the motor to detect the cause of the abnormal vibration.<br>
Thus the object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus for close mointoring and accurate assessment of the conditions of induction motors. In the case of parameters like temperatures and vibrations, trends over a period provides a good insight into the probable behaviour of the machine.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus (IRIS) which provides on line measurement of parameters, on—line spectrum computation and analysis, and the capacity of data storage for trending and further analysis.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus which combines the monitoring of both electrical and mechanical parameters instead of using separate devices as at present. An indepth analysis of both parameters is essential to determine the condition of the motor.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention which provides computer based computation of spectrum and its analysis from parameter monitoring values.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided. An apparatus (IRIS) for induction motor monitoring and fault detection comprising a TRT linked to a host PC , the said TRT8 is linked to field terminal blocks and the field terminal blocks is linked to potential transformer PT, current transformer Vibration VIB, RTD's and tacho generator, Tach for receiving signals from the motor.<br>
The nature of the invention, its objective and  further advantages residing in the same Mill be apparent from the following description  made  with  reference  to non—limiting   exemplary embodiments of  the invention represented  in  the  accompanying drawings.<br>

In accordance of the prevent invention, comprehensive monitoring systems monitors both electrical and mechanical input* for accurate assessment of the health of the motors.<br>
The IRIS system has been designed and developed for induction motors using state—of—the—art digital signal processing (DSP) electronics, It is a comprehensive monitoring system taking both electrical and mechanical inputs. It continuously monitors voltages, currents, temperatures, speed and vibration signals. It performs on-line spectrum computation of current and vibration signals. Spectral analysis is used for detecting critical faults like rotor bar failure and faults based on vibration harmonic components. The system has a graphic LCD display for display of waveforms and spectra of different signals. It has a host PC link for data archiving, trending and further analysis.<br>
The IRIS system was designed keeping these prerequisites in view. The IRIS system collects electrical and mechanical data of the motor — voltages, currents, temperatures, speed, and vibration levels. IRIS is based on the latest digital signal processing hardware which equips the system with the ability to perform on-line spectrum computation. IRIS has a graphics display for time and frequency domain waveforms. There is a resident expert rule module for interpretation of vibration harmonic data. The user is presented with conclusive fault<br>
detection so that he can take corrective action. IRIS is also provided with a keyboard by using which the user can navigate through the different screens displaying parameter data. The keyboard is also used for parameter limit setting. IRIS has a host computer link. The host computer will be located in the control room while the IRIS unit will be located near the motor. Archiving, trending the further data analysis can be done on the host computer. In applications where a number of motors have to be monitored, a multiple IRIS scheme can be configured with each motor having its own IRIS unit and all the IRIS units connected through a serial link to the host computer.<br>
IRIS is an instrument (apparatus) developed for the close health monitoring and fault detection of induction motors (I). The basic inputs for this instrument are current and voltages from all three phases, six channels of winding temperatures, motor speed and four channels of vibration signals. Current signals are sensed using a current Transformer (CT's) (4) of suitable ratio depending on the motor rating. Input line voltages are sensed through potential transformers (PT's) (3). Winding temperatures are acquired using thermocouples of RTD's (6) mounted embedded in the motor windings. Speed signal is derived from the tacho-generator (7) coupled to the motor shaft or an Optical speed<br>
encoder. The vibration sensors are mounted to the motor's mechancial assembly. These vibration sensors (5) are mounted on either side of the motor shaft i.e. DE and NDE.<br>
IRIS acquires all the above signals at pre-set sample intervals and stores them in its internal memory after conversion to engineering units. After the acquisition, the Fast Fourier Transform <fft> analysis is applied to current and vibrations signals. The results of FFT are processed and the necessary harmonic components (sub and super synchronous speed) are extracted and stored in the IRIS memory. Apart from the direct measured inputs the power parameters (KW/KVA) and the power factor are also computed and stored.<br>
The complete electrical and mechanical parameters of the Induction Motor are made available in a single IRIS to perform a comprehensive and co-ordinated monitoring and fault detection. In the IRIS using the graphic display on the front panel the above data is displayed to the operator on request both in numeric as well as graphic modes.<br>
With the above measured and derived parameters IRIS detects various electrical and mechanical faults in the induction motor using the limit checking criteria. In addition, it also<br><br>
detects certain defects using the set of boolean equations which are coded in the IRIS application firmware. All the set points, limiting values and motor configuration parameters are field programmable using the front panel keyboard.<br>
IRIS has a host computer (9) interface to transfer the data to the external computer (PC) for extensive/detailed analysis. In PC by performing long term statistical data analysis, the historical data for critical motors can be generated. Also relationships between and among paramters can be studied. A single PC can be connected to a multiple IRIS units monitoring a number of induction motors in a network. By this a chain of motors can be monitored from a centralized remote location.<br>
IRIS is designed around sophisticated microprocessor and digital signal processing electronics enabling it to perform multi-variable analysis leading to a comprehensive monitoring and protection system for electric machines. IRIS accepts currents and voltages as electrical inputs and vibration, temperature and rpm as mechanical inputs. It also accepts motor start signal as a digital input to monitor the number of starts of the motor. IRIS<br>
can be configured to any rating of motor by suitably changing the configuration parameter*. IRIS functions can be broadly classified into three categories i<br><br>

waveform Fault detection<br>
IRIS detects various types of faults in a motor by comparing set points with measured quantities. The system being highly programmable in nature, the user can set the limits for various faults. The faults detected by IRIS can be divided into two groups :<br>
a.	Electrical faults<br>
b.	Mechanical faults<br>
Depending on the severity of the fault, IRIS either issues an alarm or a trip command (relay output) apart from a visual display of fault message.<br>
Electrical faults<br>
IRIS detects the following electrical faults on an electrical machine :<br>
a.	Overvoltage/Undervoltage<br>
IRIS detects overvoltage whenever the voltage in any phase increases more than the overvoltage limit which is 10% above the normal voltage. Similarly the system detects undervoltage whenever the voltage in any phase drops below the undervoltage set point which is 10% below the normal voltage.<br>
b.	Overcurrent/Overload<br>
IRIS detects the overcurrent or overload fault whenever the current drawn by the motor in any phase exceeds 1.1 times that of the normal current at a speed less than the normal rated speed.<br>
c.	Voltage unbalance/Current asymmetry<br>
IRIS detects voltage unbalance whenever the difference between the currents in two phases is more than 20% of normal current and the line voltage of any one phase is 15% less than the normal voltage.<br>
d.	Blocked rotor<br>
Whenever the motor draws current which is more than 4 times of the normal current in al phases at normal voltage IRIS detects it as blocked rotor condition, Also during this condition the rate of change of speed of the motor is zero.<br>
e.	Reverse phase sequence<br>
Whenever the motor supply terminal sequence is changed while connecting or reconnecting a motor, IRIS detects it as reverse phase sequence.<br>
ingle phasing fault is detected when the load current in any one of the phases is zero and the load currents in the other two phases are more than 1.5 times the normal current.<br>
g.	Prolonged start<br>
IRIS detects the prolonged start fault by comparing set normal starting time with the actual starting time. If the normal starting time is less than the actual measured starting time, the prolonged start message will be displayed by IRIS<br>
h. Over temperature<br>
IRIS displays over temperature fault whenever the actual temperature exceeds the over<br>
temperature set point<br>
i. Rotor bar failure<br>
Rotor bar failure is a critical fault which cannot be detected by normal measurement of RMS values. It has been reported in the literature and in various research papers that rotor bar failure will cause predominant effect on the current spectrum . Ideally in a healthy electrical machine there exists only the fundamental harmonic and very low to zero strengths of other harmonics. But in case of a motor with rotor bar failure the spectrum will have sidebands on either side of the fundamental. In IRIS the rotor bar broken fault is detected by detecting the presence of sidebands in the current spectrum.<br>
Mechanical faults<br>
IRIS detects various types of mechanical critical mechanical faults by comparing the vibration levels with set points. Whenever the actual levels exceed the set levels, the fault is detected. Rule based logic for the detection of certain mechanical faults in an induction motor is built into the system. However the fault detection logic may require modifications depending on the mechanical details of the motor . These modifications can be made in IRIS by simple firmware changes.<br>
Host Computer Link<br>
IRIS has a host computer link to support extensive data analysis. IRIS periodically sends the data to host computer for update at a remote location. The host PC apart from performing normal display of all the parameters also performs other functions for long term performance analysis. On the host PC the trending of certain critical parameters like vibration levels can be shown and by observing the upward or downward trend of the particular parameter action can be taken by the operator. Also due to the large storage capacity, large amounts of data can be stored for archiving and analysis.<br>
SYSTEM ORGANISATION<br>
The IRIS system consists of the following units :<br>
1	IRIS unit<br>
2	Host PC<br>
Each IRIS unit has been designed to cater to one motor. For a group of motors, multiple IRIS configuration can be used.<br>
The IRIS unit acquires signals from the following field sensors :<br>
Sensor	Parameter	No. of channels<br>
1.	Potential transformers	Voltage	3<br>
2.	Current transformers	Current	3<br>
3.	Vibration probes	Vibration	4<br>
4.	RTDs	Temperature	6<br>
5.	Tachogenerator	Speed	1<br>
6.	Motor ON/OFF switch	No. of starts	1<br>
The signals from these sensors are terminated on terminal blocks. A cable connects the terminal blocks to the 48-pin Halting connector in the IRIS unit.<br>
Multi-IRIS system organization<br>
In such applications where there are many number of electrical machines working in one bay/shop floor, IRIS units can be connected in a network. This multiple IRIS network can have a single host computer link where in the data from any IRIS unit can be observed, in a multi-IRIS configuration host PC communicates to each IRIS unit with a motor tag and obtains the data of that particular motor. This provides the operator with the facility of accessing the data of any motor from a centralized location. The communication link between the host computer and the IRIS units is a serial communication link.<br>

Host PC Link:<br>
For communication with the host PC a data table is prepared in the IRIS unit and flow chart. This table is split into two blocks. Each block of data is assigned a separate start of text (sot) code. A flag decides the data block to be transmitted. Depending on the flag status, the corresponding data block is transferred to the transmit buffer. The checksum for the buffer is computed. The block start of text is first transmitted. The data block is transmitted next followed by the check sum and the end of text character. In the host PC, a proprietary add-on card handles the communication. In case of a multi-IRIS system, a machine ID field is present in the data block to identify the machine for which data is being received. After receiving each data block into a temporary buffer in the PC, checksum is computed and matched with the checksum received. Data is transferred from temporary buffer to actual buffer only when checksums match.<br>
