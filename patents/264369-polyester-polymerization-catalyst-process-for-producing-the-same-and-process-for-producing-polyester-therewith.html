POLYMERIZATION CATALYST FOR POLYESTER, METHOD FOR<br>
PRODUCING IT AND PROCESS FOR PRODUCING POLYESTER USING IT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a polymerization<br>
catalyst for a polyester, a method for producing it and a<br>
process for producing a polyester using it.<br>
Particularly, it relates to a polymerization catalyst for<br>
a polyester, with which a polyester having various<br>
physical properties such as color tone suitable for<br>
various applications to e.g. containers such as bottles,<br>
films, sheets and fibers can be produced at high reaction<br>
rate, a method for producing it and a process for<br>
producing a polyester using it.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Heretofore, a polyester has been widely used for<br>
various applications to e.g. containers such as bottles,<br>
films, sheets and fibers, since it is excellent in<br>
chemical and physical properties. Such a polyester is<br>
usually produced via an esterification reaction or an<br>
ester exchange reaction and a melt polycondensation<br>
reaction and as the case requires, particularly for<br>
containers, further by a solid phase polycondensation<br>
reaction, and for the polycondensation reaction, a<br><br>
compound such as antimony, germanium or titanium is used<br>
as a catalyst.<br>
However, a polyester produced by employing an<br>
antimony compound as a catalyst has characteristic dull<br>
color and has drawbacks in the safety and sanitation and<br>
in the environment due to toxicity pointed out regarding<br>
the antimony compound. Accordingly, it has been strongly<br>
required to reduce the amount of the antimony compound<br>
used or to develop a polycondensation catalyst which<br>
takes the place of the antimony compound. Further,<br>
although a polyester produced by employing a germanium<br>
compound as a catalyst is preferred in view of e.g.<br>
transparency and safety and sanitation, the germanium<br>
compound itself is very expensive and economical<br>
disadvantage is inevitable. Therefore, it has also been<br>
strongly desired to reduce the amount of the germanium<br>
compound used or to develop a polycondensation catalyst<br>
which takes the place of it. Under these circumstances,<br>
a titanium compound has attracted attention which is<br>
available at a low cost and is free from problems in view<br>
of e.g. safety and sanitation, and has been used<br>
practically instead of the antimony compound or the<br>
germanium compound. However, a polyester produced by<br>
employing a titanium compound as a catalyst has such<br>
drawbacks that it is characteristically yellowish, and is<br>
poor in the thermal stability.<br>
To solve such drawbacks caused by a titanium<br><br>
compound, many proposals have been made to use a titanium<br>
compound, an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal<br>
compound and a phosphorus compound in a specific ratio,<br>
thereby to improve e.g. the color tone of a polyester to<br>
be obtained (for example, JP-A-2002-179781). However,<br>
such a catalyst system is poor in catalytic activity, and<br>
thus the polycondensation requires a long time or a<br>
relatively large amount of a titanium compound is<br>
required, whereby the color tone deteriorates and as a<br>
result, the color tone can be by no mearn improved.<br>
Further, many proposals have been made regarding use<br>
of a composite compound comprising a titanium compound<br>
and another metal compound or the like. For example, it<br>
is proposed that by use of a solid titanium-containing<br>
compound obtained by hydrolyzing a mixture comprising a<br>
titanium alkoxide compound or a titanium halide with a<br>
compound such as magnesium, the catalytic activity of the<br>
titanium compound will improve and in addition, the<br>
transparency and the color tone of a polyester to be<br>
obtained will improve (JP-A-2001-55434, JP-A-2001-64377).<br>
Further, it has been known that a high catalytic<br>
activity will be obtained by use of a co-precipitate<br>
obtained by simultaneous hydrolysis of an alkylate,<br>
alcoholate or carboxylate of titanium and an alkylate,<br>
alcoholate or carboxylate of an alkali metal, an alkaline<br>
earth metal or the like (JP-A-2002-503274) . However,<br>
according to studies by the present inventors, it was<br><br>
found that the composite compound comprising a titanium<br>
compound and another metal compound or the like proposed<br>
in the publications is in a solid state, and is insoluble<br>
in an organic solvent of e.g. a diol component as a raw<br>
material for the polyester, and when it is used in the<br>
form of a slurry having it dispersed in such an organic<br>
solvent (the slurry had a turbidity exceeding 20% in a<br>
light path length of 10 mm), the polycondensation<br>
reaction rate tends to be insufficient and further, there<br>
is a problem in e.g. handling efficiency. Further, it<br>
was found that various physical properties such as color<br>
tone and transparency of a polyester to be obtained<br>
should be further improved.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under these circumstances, it is an object of the<br>
present invention to solve the above problems in<br>
production of a polyester employing e.g. a titanium<br>
compound as a polycondensation catalyst. Namely, it is<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The following explanation regarding constituents is<br>
a typical example of the embodiment of the present<br><br>
invention, and the present invention is by no means<br>
restricted to such specific explanation.<br>
The polymerization catalyst for a polyester of the<br>
present invention comprises components having at least<br>
the following metal element (1) and the following metal<br>
element (2), with contents which satisfy the following<br>
(a), and is in a liquid state:<br>
(1)	at least one metal element selected from the<br>
group consisting of metal elements of Group 4A of the<br>
Periodic Table,<br>
(2)	at least one metal element selected from the<br>
group consisting of metal elements of Group 2A of the<br>
Periodic Table, aluminum, manganese, iron, cobalt, zinc,<br>
gallium and germanium,<br>
(a) when the total amount of metal atoms derived<br>
from the above metal element (1) is represented by t<br>
(mol/catalyst kg), and the total amount of metal atoms<br>
derived from the above metal element (2) is represented<br>
by m (mol/catalyst kg), the value of m/t is within the<br>
following range:<br>
0.50 
The metal element of Group 4A of the Periodic Table<br>
of the metal element (1) may, for example, be titanium,<br>
zirconium or hafnium, and among them, titanium is<br>
preferred. Further, the metal element of Group 2A of the<br>
Periodic Table of the above metal element (2) may, for<br>
example, be beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium or<br><br>
barium, and among metal elements including aluminum,<br>
manganese, iron, cobalt, zinc, gallium and germanium,<br>
preferred is the metal element of Group 2A of the<br>
Periodic Table, iron or zinc, more preferred is the metal<br>
element of Group 2A of The periodic Table, particularly<br>
preferred is magnesium or calcium, and among them,<br>
magnesium is preferred.<br>
It is essential that the polymerization catalyst for<br>
a polyester in a liquid state of the present invention is<br>
substantially homogenous and transparent, and has a<br>
turbidity of at most 2 0% in a light path length of 10 mm,<br>
and it preferably has a turbidity of at most 10%. If<br>
this turbidity exceeds the above range, for example, in a<br>
case of e.g. a slurry having a solid catalyst dispersed<br>
in an organic solvent, the polycondensation reaction rate<br>
tends to be insufficient, and a polyester to be obtained<br>
tends to be poor in color tone and transparency. The<br>
reason is not necessarily clear but is considered to be<br>
because the polymerization catalyst for a polyester of<br>
the present invention is substantially homogeneous and<br>
transparent and is a catalyst in a liquid state in which<br>
active sites are highly dispersed, whereas in e.g. a<br>
slurry of a solid catalyst, catalyst active sites are<br>
localized on the surface of the solid catalyst, whereas<br>
the number of active sites is small, the polycondensation<br>
velocity tends to be low, and deterioration of color tone<br>
due to a side reaction tends to be relatively remarkable.<br><br>
Otherwise, it is considered to be one of reasons that a<br>
solid substance such as the solid catalyst functions as a<br>
nucleating agent of a polyester to be obtained and<br>
decreases transparency.<br>
Further, a polymerization catalyst having a<br>
turbidity exceeding the above range, such as a<br>
polymerization catalyst in the form of a slurry having a<br>
solid catalyst dispersed in an organic solvent, is poor<br>
in handling efficiency such that it is difficult to add a<br>
required very small amount of the catalyst with accuracy<br>
as compared with addition of a liquid catalyst, or the<br>
slurry sediments in a catalyst storage tank or in an<br>
addition line, which leads to scaling.<br>
Here, the turbidity is determined by putting a<br>
liquid catalyst in a cell having a light path length of<br>
10 mm and measuring the turbidity by means of a haze<br>
meter at 23°C under 50% RH using ethylene glycol as a<br>
control.<br>
In the polymerization catalyst for a polyester of<br>
the present invention, in view of the polycondensation<br>
reaction rate and the color tone of a polyester to be<br>
obtained, when the total amount of metal atoms derived<br>
from the above metal element (1) is represented by t<br>
(mol/catalyst kg) and the total amount of metal atoms<br>
derived from the above metal element (2) is represented<br>
by m (mol/catalyst kg), the lower limit of the ratio of<br>
them (m/t) is usually 0.50, preferably 1.00, more<br><br>
preferably 1.50, and the upper limit is usually 3.50,<br>
preferably 2.90, more preferably 2.40. When m/t is<br>
within the above range, the polycondensation reaction<br>
rate and the color tone of a polyester to be obtained<br>
when the polymerization catalyst for a polyester of the<br>
present invention is used will be within preferred<br>
ranges.<br>
The amounts of the respective metal elements in the<br>
components having the above metal element (1) and the<br>
above metal element (2) are preferably such that the<br>
total amount (t) of atoms derived from the above metal<br>
element (1) is 0<t kg and the total></t>
amount (m) of atoms derived from the above metal element<br>
(2) is 0<m kg per of the></m>
polymerization catalyst for a polyester. Particularly<br>
when the metal element (1) is titanium and the metal<br>
element (2) is magnesium, it is preferred that 0<t></t>
(mol/catalyst kg) and 0<m kg . when m></m>
and t are within the above ranges, the turbidity of the<br>
polymerization catalyst for a polyester of the present<br>
invention will be stably within the preferred range as<br>
specified by the present invention, and as a result, the<br>
polycondensation reaction rate and the color tone of a<br>
polyester to be obtained will be stably within preferred<br>
ranges. Here, "the turbidity will be stably within the<br>
preferred range as specified by the present invention"<br>
means, for example, not only the turbidity will not<br><br>
increase at the time of preparation of the catalyst of<br>
the present invention but also the turbidity will not<br>
increase due to precipitation of catalytic components<br>
when the catalyst of the present invention is stored at a<br>
high temperature. Further, it means that precipitation<br>
and scaling will be inhibited when the catalyst of the<br>
present invention passes through a high temperature<br>
portion in an addition pipe when it is added to a<br>
polycondensation reaction system at a high temperature,<br>
and the polymerization catalyst is smoothly added with a<br>
low turbidity to the end. However, this is not<br>
particularly limited to such meanings.<br>
Further, the polymerization catalyst for a polyester<br>
of the present invention has a pH of usually at most 7,<br>
preferably at most 6, more preferably at most 5,<br>
particularly preferably at most 4, furthermore preferably<br>
at most 3, and the pH is preferably lower, although it is<br>
not particularly limited so long as the above turbidity<br>
range is satisfied. When the polymerization catalyst for<br>
a polyester of the present invention has a pH within the<br>
above range, the turbidity will be stably within the<br>
preferred range as specified by the present invention,<br>
and as a result, the polycondensation reaction rate and<br>
the color tone or transparency of a polyester to be<br>
obtained will be stably within preferred ranges.<br>
In order that the pH is within the above range, a<br>
method of adjusting the contents of the above metal<br><br>
element (1) and the above metal element (2), a method of<br>
incorporating the following component (3) and/or the<br>
following component (4) into the polymerization catalyst<br>
for a polyester as the case requires, may, for example,<br>
be mentioned:<br>
(3)	an organic solvent and/or water<br>
(4)	at least one acid selected from the group<br>
consisting of organic acids and inorganic acids<br>
The organic solvent for the component (3) is<br>
preferably an alcohol, more preferably an organic solvent<br>
having a high affinity with a reaction liquid for a<br>
polyester such as a diol as a raw material of a<br>
polyester. Such an organic solvent may, for example, be<br>
a monool or polyol having from about 1 to about 20 carbon<br>
atoms, specifically, a monool such as methanol, ethanol,<br>
propanol, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, octanol<br>
or nonanol, or a diol or a polyol which is one component<br>
used for production of a polyester of the present<br>
invention as mentioned hereinafter, such as ethylene<br>
glycol, diethylene glycol, trimethylene glycol or<br>
tetramethylene glycol. Among them, a diol is preferred,<br>
and ethylene glycol is particularly preferred.<br>
The component (3) in the present invention is<br>
preferably an organic solvent and water, particularly<br>
preferably a mixture of water and ethylene glycol which<br>
is the particularly preferred organic solvent.<br>
In such a case, as a preferred amount of water, as<br><br>
represented by the weight concentration based on the<br>
entire polymerization catalyst for a polyester, the lower<br>
limit is usually 1%, preferably 2%, more preferably 3%,<br>
and the upper limit is usually 30%, preferably 20%, more<br>
preferably 10%.<br>
When the organic solvent and water are used as the<br>
component (3) and water is used in the above preferred<br>
amount, the turbidity of the polymerization catalyst for<br>
a polyester of the present invention will be stably<br>
within the preferred range as specified by the present<br>
invention, and as a result, the polycondensation reaction<br>
rate and the color tone or the transparency of a<br>
polyester to be obtained will be stably within preferred<br>
ranges.<br>
Further, specifically, the organic acid of the<br>
component (4) may, for example, be an aliphatic saturated<br>
monocarboxylic acid such as acetic acid, propionic acid,<br>
butyric acid, hexoic acid, stearic acid or behenic acid,<br>
an aliphatic saturated dicarboxylic acid and an anhydride<br>
thereof, such as oxalic acid, malonic acid, succinic<br>
acid, glutaric acid, adipic acid, pimelic acid, suberic<br>
acid, azelic acid, sebacic acid, undecadicarboxylic acid<br>
or dodecadicarboxylic acid, an aliphatic unsaturated<br>
dicarboxylic acid and an anhydride thereof, such as<br>
maleic acid or fumaric acid, an aliphatic polyhydric<br>
carboxylic acid and an anhydride thereof, such as<br>
tricarballylic acid, an alicyclic dicarboxylic acid and<br><br>
an anhydride thereof, such as hexahydrophthalic acid or<br>
hexahydroisophthalic acid, an aromatic monocarboxylic<br>
acid such as benzoic acid or t-butylbenzoic acid, an<br>
aromatic dicarboxylic acid and an anhydride thereof, such<br>
as phthalic acid, isophthalic acid, dibromoisophthalic<br>
acid, sodium sulfoisophthalate, terephthalic acid,<br>
phenylenedioxy dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-diphenyl<br>
dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-diphenyl ether dicarboxylic acid,<br>
4,4'-diphenyl ketone dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-<br>
diphenoxyethane dicarboxylic acid, 4,4'-diphenylsulfone<br>
dicarboxylic acid or 2,6-naphthalene dicarboxylic acid,<br>
an aromatic polyhydric carboxylic acid and an anhydride<br>
thereof, such as trimellitic acid, trimesic acid or<br>
pyromellitic acid, or a hydroxycarboxylic acid or an<br>
alkoxycarboxylic acid such as glycolic acid, lactic acid,<br>
citric acid, gallic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid or p-(3-<br>
hydroxyethoxybenzoic acid. Further, the inorganic acid<br>
may, for example, be specifically hydrochloric acid,<br>
sulfuric acid or nitric acid. Among them, an organic<br>
acid is preferred, an aliphatic carboxylic acid such as<br>
an aliphatic saturated monocarboxylic acid such as acetic<br>
acid, an aliphatic saturated dicarboxylic acid and an<br>
anhydride thereof, such as succinic acid, or an aliphatic<br>
saturated hydroxycarboxylic acid such as lactic acid is<br>
more preferred, an aliphatic saturated hydroxycarboxylic<br>
acid is particularly preferred, and among them, lactic<br>
acid is preferred.<br><br>

When an organic acid is used as the above component<br>

producing a polyester resin can be employed except that<br>
the polymerization catalyst for a polyester of the<br>

an ester exchange catalyst, transferring the obtained<br>
polyester low molecular weight product which is an<br>
esterification reaction product or an ester exchange<br>
reaction product to a polycondensation tank, and<br>

proportion of the terephthalic acid or its ester forming<br>
derivative in the dicarboxylic acid component or the<br>
proportion of ethylene glycol in the diol component is<br>
less than the above range, mechanical strength, gas<br>
barrier properties and heat resistance of a polyester to<br>
be obtained as a molded product tend to be low.<br>

atoms and its halide, may be used as a copolymerizable<br><br>
component.<br>
Further, as a diol component other than ethylene<br>

In the present invention, the dicarboxylic acid<br>
component containing terephthalic acid or its ester<br>
forming derivative as the main component, the diol<br>
component containing ethylene glycol as the main<br>
component and the copolymerizable component to be used as<br>
the case requires are usually mixed and prepared for the<br>
esterification reaction or the ester exchange reaction so<br>
that the lower limit of the molar ratio of the diol<br>
component to the dicarboxylic acid component is usually<br>
1.02, preferably 1.03, and the upper limit is usually<br>
2.0, preferably 1.7.<br>
In the case of an ester exchange reaction, usually<br>
an ester exchange catalyst is required, and a large<br>
amount of such a catalyst is required. Accordingly, as<br>
the process for producing a polyester of the present<br>
invention, preferred is a production process via an<br>
esterification reaction.<br>
The esterification reaction is carried out, for<br><br>
example, by means of a single esterification reaction<br>
tank or a multi-stage reaction apparatus having a<br>
plurality of esterification reaction tanks connected in<br>
series, under reflux of ethylene glycol, while removing<br>
water formed by the reaction and excess ethylene glycol<br>
out of the system, until the esterification ratio (the<br>
proportion of the esterified by a reaction with the diol<br>
component among the total carboxyl groups of the raw<br>
material dicarboxylie acid component) reaches usually at<br>
least 90%, preferably at least 93%. Further, the number<br>
average molecular weight of the polyester low molecular<br>
weight product as the esterification reaction product is<br>
preferably from 500 to 5,000.<br>
As examples of the reaction conditions in the<br>
esterification reaction, in the case of a single<br>
esterification reaction tank, the temperature is usually<br>

to 400 kPa (from 0 to 4 kg/cm2G) , and the reaction time<br>

1.3 kg/cm2G) .<br>
Further, in the esterification reaction, it is<br>
possible to suppress production of diethylene glycol as a<br>
by-product from ethylene glycol, by adding a small amount<br>
of e.g. a tertiary amine such as triethylamine, tri-n-<br>
butylamine or benzyl dimethylamine, a quaternary ammonium<br>
hydroxide such as tetraethylammonium hydroxide, tetra-n-<br>
butylammonium hydroxide or trimethylbenzylammonium<br>
hydroxide, or a basic compound such as lithium carbonate,<br>
sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium acetate.<br>
As an example of the melt polycondensation, a method<br>
is common wherein the melt polycondensation is carried<br>
out under reduced pressure, while distilling off formed<br>
ethylene glycol out of the system, by means of a single<br>
melt polymerization tank, or a multi-stage reaction<br>
apparatus having a plurality of melt polycondensation<br>
tanks connected in series, for example, an apparatus<br>
comprising a perfect mixing type reactor equipped with<br>
stirring vanes for the first stage and horizontal plug<br><br>
flow type reactors equipped with stirring vanes for the<br>
second and third stages.<br>
As examples of the reaction conditions in the melt<br>
polycondensation, in the case of a single<br>
polycondensation tank, the temperature is usually at a<br>
level of from 250 to 290°C, the pressure is gradually<br>
reduced from the atmospheric pressure, so that finally,<br>
the absolute pressure will be usually at a level of from<br>
1.3 to 0.013 kPa (from 10 to 0.1 Torr), and the reaction<br>
time is at a level of from 1 to 20 hours with stirring.<br>
Whereas, as an example in the case of a plurality of<br>
polycondensation tanks, the lower limit of the reaction<br>
temperature in the polycondensation tank for the first<br>
stage is usually 250°C, preferably 260°C, and the upper<br>
limit is usually 290°C, preferably 280°C; the upper limit<br>
of the reaction pressure as the absolute pressure is<br>
usually 65 kPa (500 Torr), preferably 26 kPa (200 Torr),<br>
and the lower limit is usually 1.3 kPa (10 Torr),<br>
preferably 2 kPa (15 Torr); the lower limit of the<br>

Torr), preferably 0.65 kPa (5 Torr), and the lower limit<br>
is usually 0.013 kPa (0.1 Torr), preferably 0.065 kPa<br>

stage are selected to be intermediate conditions thereof,<br><br>
for example, as an example of reaction conditions for the<br>
second stage in a three stage reaction apparatus, the<br>
lower limit of the reaction temperature is usually 265°C,<br>
preferably 270°C, and the upper limit is usually 295°C,<br>
preferably 285°C; and the upper limit of the reaction<br>
pressure as the absolute pressure is usually 6.5 kPa (50<br>
Torr), preferably 4 kPa (30 Torr), and the lower limit is<br>
usually 0.13 kPa (1 Torr), preferably 0.26 kPa (2 Torr).<br>
The process for producing a polyester of the present<br>

step of mixing the above dicarboxylic acid component and<br>

whereby the melt polycondensability and the solid phase<br>
polycondensability, and the transparency and the color<br>
tone of a molded product formed from a polyester resin to<br>
be obtained, will be favorable.<br>
Further, when the polymerization catalyst for a<br>
polyester of the present invention is added to the<br>
reaction system, it may be diluted with a solvent such as<br>
ethylene glycol depending upon the performance of the<br>
reaction equipment or the charge pump.<br>

the color tone tends to be yellowish. On the other hand,<br>
if (M1/P1) exceeds the right-side value of the formula<br>
(V1'') and becomes large, the polycondensability,<br>
particularly the solid phase polycondensability as<br>
described hereinafter tends to decrease, and the color<br>
tone tends to decrease:<br><br><br><br>
Further, the total amount (T1 (mol/ton)) of titanium<br>
atoms derived from titanium of the above (1), the total<br>
amount (M1 (mol/ton)) of magnesium atoms derived from<br>
magnesium of the above (2) and the total amount (P1<br>
(mol/ton)) of phosphorus atoms derived from the<br>
phosphorus compound satisfy the above respective<br>
formulae, and besides, (P1/M1/T1) preferably satisfies<br>
the following formula (IV1) , more preferably satisfies<br>
the following formula (IV1'), particularly preferably<br>
satisfies the following formula (IV1'). If (P1/M1/T1)<br>
is less than the left-side value of the following formula<br>
(VI1') and becomes smaller, the color tone of a<br>
polyester tends to be yellowish, and if it exceeds the<br>
right-side value of the following formula (VI1') and<br>
becomes larger, the polycondensability, particularly the<br>
solid phase polycondensability as described hereinafter<br>
tends to decrease:<br><br>
In the process for producing a polyester of the<br>
present invention, the ratios represented by the above<br>
respective formulae based on the total amount of atoms<br>
derived from the above metal element (1), the total<br><br>
amount of atoms derived from the above metal element (2)<br>
and the total amount of phosphorus atoms derived from the<br>
phosphorus compound in the polymerization catalyst for a<br>
polyester of the present invention, are in most suitable<br>
ranges also in view of the diethylene glycol content, the<br>
acetaldehyde content in a polyester and in a molded<br>
product, and aroma-retention property.<br>
The polyester to be obtained by the melt<br>
polycondensation has an intrinsic viscosity ([η1] ) as a<br>
value measured at 30°C in a mixed liquid of<br>
phenol/tetrachloroethane (weight ratio: 1/1) as a<br>
solvent, such that the lower limit is usually 0.35 dl/g,<br>
preferably 0.50 dl/g, and the upper limit is usually 0.75<br>
dl/g, preferably 0.65 dl/g. If the intrinsic viscosity<br>
([η1]) is less than the above range, the withdrawing<br>
property from the polycondensation tank, as described<br>
hereinafter tends to be poor. On the other hand, if it<br>
exceeds the above range, it tends to be difficult to<br>
reduce the acetaldehyde content in the obtained<br>
polyester.<br>
The polyester obtained by the melt polycondensation<br>
is usually withdrawn in the form of a strand from a<br>
discharge outlet provided at the bottom of the<br>
polycondensation tank and, while being cooled by water or<br>
after being cooled by water, cut by a cutter into<br>
particles such as pellets or chips. Further, such<br>
particles after the melt polycondensation are preferably<br><br>
subjected to solid phase polycondensation. The solid<br>
phase polycondensation is carried out, for example, by<br>
heating such particles in an atmosphere of an inert gas<br>
such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide or argon, under an<br>
elevated pressure of usually at most 100 kPa (1 kg/cm2G) ,<br>
preferably at most 20 kPa (0.2 kg/cm2G) as a relative<br>
pressure to the atmospheric pressure usually for a level<br>
of from 5 to 30 hours or under reduced pressure as an<br>
absolute pressure such that the upper limit is usually<br>
6.5 kPa (50 Torr), preferably 1.3 kPa (10 Torr) and the<br>
lower limit is usually 0.013 kPa (0.1 Torr), preferably<br>
0.065 kPa (0.5 Torr) usually for a level of from 1 to 20<br>
hours at a lower limit temperature of usually 190°C,<br>
preferably 195°C and an upper limit temperature of<br>
usually 230°C, preferably 225°C. By this solid phase<br>
polycondensation, it is possible to further increase the<br>
polymerization degree and to reduce the amount of by-<br>
products such as acetaldehyde.<br>
Further, prior to the solid phase polycondensation,<br>
it is preferred to crystallize the surface of the<br>
polyester particles. As a method of crystallzing the<br>
surface of the polyester particles, for example, it is<br>
commonly carried out to heat the polyester particles in<br>
an atmosphere of an inert gas, in a steam atmosphere or<br>
in a steam-containing inert gas atmosphere at a lower<br>
limit temperature of usually 120°C, preferably 130°C and<br>
an upper limit temperature of usually 200°C, preferably<br><br>
190°C for a level of from 1 minutes to 4 hours.<br>
Particularly, it is preferred to carry out the heating in<br>
a steam atmosphere so as to improve the crystallization<br>
rate of the polyester and to further reduce the<br>
acetaldehyde content in the obtained polyester.<br>
The polyester obtained by the solid phase<br>
polycondensation has an intrinsic viscosity ([η2]) as a<br>
value measured at 30°C in a mixed liquid of<br>
phenol/tetrachloroethane (weight ratio: 1/1) as a solvent<br>
such that the lower limit is usually 0.70 dl/g,<br>
preferably 0.73 dl/g, and the upper limit is usually 0.90<br>
dl/g, preferably 0.85 dl/g. If the intrinsic viscosity<br>
([n2]) is less than the above range, the mechanical<br>
strength as a molded product tends to decrease. On the<br>
other hand, if it exceeds the above range, it tends to be<br>
difficult to suppress formation of acetaldehyde or the<br>
like as by-products at the time of melt molding in some<br>
cases.<br>
The polyester obtained by the above melt<br>
polycondensation or solid phase polycondensation may be<br>
subjected to the following treatment so as to inactivate<br>
the polymerization catalyst contained. As a treatment to<br>
inactivate the polymerization catalyst, water treatment<br>
of dipping it in warm water of at least 40°C for at least<br>
10 minutes, steam treatment of contacting it with steam<br>
or a steam-containing gas of at least 60°C for at least<br>
30 minutes, treatment with an organic solvent, treatment<br><br>
with an aqueous acidic solution or organic solution of<br>
e.g. various mineral acids, organic acids, phosphoric<br>
acid, phosphorous acid or a phosphate, or treatment with<br>
an alkaline aqueous solution or organic solution of e.g.<br>
a metal of Group 1A or 2A of the Periodic Table or an<br>
amine, may be commonly carried out.<br>
The polyester produced by the production process of<br>
the present invention has a color coordinate value b of<br>
the Hunter's color difference formula in the Lab color<br>
system as disclosed in Reference 1 of JIS Z8730, of<br>
preferably at most 4.0, more preferably at most 3.0,<br>
particularly preferably at most 2.0, in order to suppress<br>
the yellowish color tone of a molded product. Further,<br>
it has a psychometric lightness value L of preferably at<br>
least 85, more preferably at least 88.<br>
In order that the color coordinate value b will be<br>
within the above range, a so-called organic toning agent<br>
may be added. Such an organic toning agent may, for<br>
example, be a dye or pigment such as Solvent Blue 104,<br>
Solvent Red 135, Solvent Violet 36, Pigment Blue 29, 15:1<br>
or 15:3, Pigment Red 187 or 263, or Pigment Violet 19.<br>
The addition amount is preferably at most 3.0 ppm, more<br>
preferably at most 2.0 ppm, particularly preferably at<br>
most 1.5 ppm, especially preferably at most 1.0 ppm, with<br>
a view to suppressing the decrease in the psychometric<br>
lightness value L. The timing of addition of the organic<br>
toning agent may be at any one of from the step of<br><br>
producing the polyester to the molding step, and is not<br>
particularly limited.<br>
By addition of the organic toning agent, the color<br>
coordinate value b can be brought to at most 1.0 while<br>
maintaining the psychometric lightness value L of<br>
preferably at least 80, more preferably at least 83.<br>
Further, the polyester produced by the production<br>
process of the present invention has a haze of preferably<br>
at most 5.0%, more preferably at most 3.0%, in the form<br>
of a molded plate having a thickness of 5 mm formed by<br>
injection molding at 280°C. Further, it has a haze of<br>
preferably at most 40%, more preferably at most 20%,<br>
particularly preferably at most 10%, in the form of a<br>
molded plate having a thickness of 5 mm formed by<br>
injection molding at 270°C.<br>
The polyester produced by the production process of<br>
the present invention has an acetaldehyde content of<br>
preferably at most 3.0 ppm, more preferably at most 2.0<br>
ppm, with a view to suppressing bad influences of molded<br>
products such as bottles over e.g. taste and flavor of a<br>
content. The acetaldehyde content in a molded product<br>
formed by injection molding at 280°C is preferably at<br>
most 23 ppm, more preferably at most 20 ppm, particularly<br>
preferably at most 18 ppm, especially preferably at most<br>
15 ppm.<br>
Further, the polyester produced by the production<br>
process of the present invention has a cyclic trimer<br><br>
content of preferably at most 0.60 wt%, more preferably<br>
at most 0.50 wt%, particularly preferably at most 0.40<br>
wt%, with a view to preventing a mold from being stained<br>
at the time of molding of e.g. bottles and imparting<br>
transparency to the molded products.<br>
The polyester produced by the production process of<br>
the present invention may, for example, be molded into a<br>
preform by injection molding, followed by stretch blow<br>
molding, or molded into a parison by extrusion, followed<br>
by blow molding, to obtain a bottle or the like.<br>
Otherwise, it may be formed into a sheet by extrusion,<br>
followed by heat forming to obtain a tray, a container or<br>
the like, or said sheet may be biaxially stretched to<br>
obtain a film or the like, which will be particularly<br>
useful for packaging materials for food and beverage<br>
products. Among them, it is particularly suitable for<br>
molding the preform obtained by injection molding into a<br>
bottle by a blow molding method by biaxial stretching,<br>
and it is suitable, for example, for a container for e.g.<br>
a carbonated beverage, an alcoholic beverage, or a liquid<br>
seasoning such as soy sauce, a regular sauce, Japanese<br>
sweet rice wine for cooking or dressing, or after heat<br>
setting, for a container for a beverage such as a fruit<br>
juice beverage, a vitamin beverage, a flavor tea or<br>
mineral water.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br><br>
further detail with reference to Examples. However, the<br>
present invention is by no means restricted to the<br>
following Examples within a range not to exceed the gist.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
PREPARATION OF POLYMERIZATION CATALYST FOR A POLYESTER<br>
A mixed liquid comprising 41 parts by weight of<br>
ethylene glycol and 4 parts by weight of water was put in<br>
a preparation tank equipped with a stirrer under normal<br>
pressure at room temperature, 1.5 parts by weight of<br>
magnesium acetate tetrahydrate was added to the mixed<br>
liquid, stirred and dissolved, and further, 3.8 parts by<br>
weight of a 98 wt% aqueous solution of lactic acid (0.777<br>
mol/kg of lactic acid par 1 kg of catalyst) was added,<br>
stirred and mixed, and then 2.4 parts by weight of tetra-<br>
n-butyl titanate was added, followed by stirring for 30<br>
minutes for dissolution, thereby to prepare a<br>
polymerization catalyst A-3 for a polyester. This<br>
catalyst A-3 contained 6,200 ppm (0.129 mol/kg) of<br>
titanium atoms and 3,100 ppm (0.128 mol/kg) of magnesium<br>
atoms, and had a pH of 4 and a turbidity of 5% in a light<br>
path length of 10 mm as measured by the following<br>
methods. The composition and analyzed values of the<br>
catalyst are shown in Table 1.<br>
pH OF CATALYST<br>
Using an automatic titration system "Model AUT-501"<br>
manufactured by DKK TOA CORPORATION, a pH electrode was<br>
immersed in a liquid catalyst in the air atmosphere, and<br><br>
a measured value was read.<br>
TURBIDITY OF CATALYST<br>
Using a haze meter "NDH-300A" manufactured by NIPPON<br>
DENSHOKU INDUSTRIES CO., LTD., a liquid catalyst was put<br>
in a cell with a light path length of 10 mm, and the<br>
total light transmittance (Tt (%)) and the diffuse<br>
transmittance (Td (%) ) were measured at 23°C under 50% RH<br>
using ethylene glycol as a control, and the turbidity was<br>
calculated from the following formula:<br>
(Td/Tt) x 100 (%)<br>
PRODUCTION OF POLYESTER<br>
To an esterification reaction tank having 60 parts by<br>
weight of an ethylene terephthalate oligomer having an<br>
average polymerization degree of 6 preliminarily charged<br>
therein and maintained at a temperature of 250°C under a<br>
pressure of 1.2x105 Pa, a slurry comprising 43 parts by<br>
weight of terephthalic acid and 19 parts by weight of<br>
ethylene glycol was supplied over a period of 4 hours to<br>
carry out an esterification reaction, and after<br>
completion of the supply, the esterification reaction was<br>
carried out further for 1 hour, and then 60 parts by<br>
weight of the obtained esterification reaction product<br>
was transported to a polycondensation tank.<br>
Then, to the polycondensation tank to which the<br>
esterification reaction product was transported, through<br>
a pipe thereof, ethyl acid phosphate in the form of an<br>
ethylene glycol solution was added in such an amount that<br><br>
the total amount P as phosphorus atoms per 1 ton of a<br>
polyester to be obtained would be 0.210 mol/ton, and five<br>
minutes later, 0.048 part by weight of the above obtained<br>
catalyst A-3 (such an amount that the total amount M as<br>
magnesium atoms would be 0.103 mol/ton and the total<br>
amount P as titanium atoms would be 0.104 mol/ton per 1<br>
ton of a polyester to be obtained) . Then, while the<br>
temperature in the system was increased from 250°C to<br>
280°C over a period of two and a half hours and the<br>
pressure was reduced from normal pressure to 4xl02 Pa<br>
over a period of 1 hour and the pressure was maintained,<br>
melt polycondensation was carried out until the intrinsic<br>
viscosity [η1] of the obtained polyester became 0.60<br>
dl/g. Then, the product was withdrawn in the form of a<br>
strand from a discharge outlet provided at the bottom of<br>
the polycondensation tank, cooled with water and then cut<br>
into chips, whereby melt polycondensed polyester chips<br>
were produced.<br>
Then, the above obtained melt polycondensed polyester<br>
chips were continuously supplied for crystallization to<br>
an agitation crystallizer maintained at about 160°C so<br>
that the retention time would be about 5 minutes, and<br>
then dried in an inert oven "Model IPHH-201" manufactured<br>
by ESPEC Corp. in a stream of nitrogen at 40 L/min at<br>
160°C for 2 hours, and then heated at 210°C for a period<br>
so that the intrinsic viscosity ([η2]) of the obtained<br>
polyester become 0.75 dl/g for solid phase<br><br>
polycondensation. The intrinsic viscosity ([η1]) of the<br>
melt polycondensed polyester and the intrinsic viscosity<br>
([η2]) of the solid phase polycondensed polyester were<br>
measured by the following method, and the melt<br>
polycondensation velocity (V1) and the solid phase<br>
polycondensation velocity (V2) were calculated from the<br>
obtained values in accordance with the following formula,<br>
and the results are shown in Table 2.<br>
INTRINSIC VISCOSITY [η1] , [η2]<br>
0.50 g of a freeze-pulverized polyester sample was<br>
dissolved at a concentration (c) of 1.0 g/dl in a mixed<br>
liquid of phenol/tetrachloroethane (weight ratio: 1/1).<br>
A melt polycondensed polyester was dissolved at 110°C,<br>
and a solid phase polycondensed polyester was dissolved<br>
at 120°C, each over a period of 3 0 minutes. Then, by<br>
means of an Ubbellohde capillary viscometer, the relative<br>
viscosity (nrel) to the solvent was measured at 30°C, and<br>
a ratio (nsp/c) of the specific viscosity (nsp) obtained<br>
from this relative viscosity (nrel)-1, to the<br>
concentration (c), was obtained. In a similar manner,<br>
the corresponding ratios (nsp/c) were obtained when the<br>
concentration (c) was 0.5 g/dl, 0.2 g/dl and 0.1 g/dl,<br>
respectively. From these values, a ratio (nsp/c) when<br>
the concentration (c) was extrapolated to be 0, was<br>
obtained as each of the intrinsic viscosities [nl] and<br>
[η2].<br>
MELT POLYCONDENSATION VELOCITY (V1) AND SOLID PHASE<br><br>
POLYCONDENSATION VELOCITY (V2)<br>
Melt polycondensation velocity (V1) = [η1]/melt<br>
polycondensation time (Tm)<br>
Solid phase polycondensation velocity (V2) = ([η2]-<br>
[η1])/solid phase polycondensation time (Ts)<br>
Further, with respect to the obtained solid phase<br>
polycondensed polyester chips, the metal element contents<br>
derived from the catalyst or the like, the color<br>
coordinated value b and the haze of a molded plate were<br>
measured by the following methods, and the results are<br>
shown in Table 2.<br>
CONTENTS OF METAL ATOMS<br>
2.5 g of a polyester sample was ashed and completely<br>
decomposed by hydrogen peroxide in the presence of<br>
sulfuric acid in accordance with a usual method and then<br>
adjusted by distilled water to a constant volume of 50<br>
ml, and with respect to this sample, quantitative<br>
analysis was carried out by means of a plasma emission<br>
spectrometer "ICP-AES JY46P model", manufactured by JOBIN<br>
YVON COMPANY, whereupon the total amount T (mol/ton) as<br>
titanium atoms, the total amount M (mol/ton) as magnesium<br>
atoms and the total amount P (mol/ton) of phosphorus<br>
atoms per 1 ton of the polyester were calculated.<br>
COLOR TONE<br>
A polyester sample was filled into a cylindrical<br>
powder colorimetric cell having an inner diameter of 30<br>
mm and a depth of 12 mm, and by means of a colorimetric<br><br>
color difference meter "ND-300A", manufactured by NIPPON<br>
DENSHOKU INDUSTRIES CO., LTD., the color coordinate value<br>
b of the Hunter's color difference formula in the Lab<br>
color system as disclosed in Reference 1 of JIS Z8730,<br>
was obtained as a simple average value of values measured<br>
at four positions by rotating the cell every 90° by a<br>
reflection method.<br>
HAZE OF MOLDED PLATE<br>
The polyester chips were dried at 160°C for 4 hours<br>
in a nitrogen stream of 40 L/min in an inert oven "IPHH-<br>
201 model", manufactured by ESPEC Corp., and then, by an<br>
injection molding machine "M-70AII-DM", manufactured by<br>
Meiki Co., Ltd., a stepped molded plate having a shape as<br>
shown in Fig. 1 and having a size of 50 mm x 100 mm and<br>
thicknesses of six stages ranging from 6 mm to 3.5 mm in<br>
a transverse direction with each step being 0.5 mm, was<br>
injection-molded at a cylinder temperature of 280°C under<br>
a back pressure of 5x105 Pa at an injection rate of 40<br>
cc/sec under a dwell pressure of 35xl05 Pa at a mold<br>
temperature of 25°C with a molding cycle of about 75<br>
seconds. In Fig. 1, G indicates a gate portion. With<br>
respect to the portion having a thickness of 5.0 mm<br>
(portion C in Fig. 1) in the obtained molded plate, the<br>
haze was measured by means of a haze meter "NDH-300A",<br>
manufactured by NIPPON DENSHOKU INDUSTRIES CO., LTD.<br>

EXAMPLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXAMPLE 6 OF JP-A-2002-179781<br><br>
PRODUCTION OF POLYESTER<br>
Melt polycondensation was carried out in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1 except that into the<br>
polycondensation tank to which the esterification<br>
reaction product was transported, through a pipe thereof,<br>
instead of the catalyst A-3, tetra-n-butyl titanate in<br>
the form of a 0.5 wt% ethylene glycol solution was added<br>
in such an amount that the total amount T as titanium<br>
atoms would be 0.104 mol/ton, 5 minutes later, magnesium<br>
acetate tetrahydrate in the form of a 0.6 wt% ethylene<br>
glycol solution was added in such an amount that the<br>
total amount M as magnesium atoms per 1 ton of the<br>
obtained polyester would be 0.103 mol/ton, and 5 minutes<br>
later, ethyl acid phosphate in the form of an ethylene<br>
glycol solution was further added in such an amount that<br>
the total amount P as phosphorus atoms per 1 ton of the<br>
obtained polyester would be 0.210 mol/ton. Then, solid<br>
phase polycondensation was carried out to produce a<br>
polyester, and evaluations were carried out in the same<br>
manner. The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
In Comparative Example 1-1, the polycondensation<br>
catalysts were added dividedly as compared with Example<br>
1. Resultingly, the polycondensation velocity was low,<br>
and the obtained polyester had impaired color tone and<br>
transparency.<br>

EXAMPLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXAMPLE 2 OF JP-A-2001-64377<br>
PREPARATION OF POLYMERIZATION CATALYST FOR A POLYESTER<br>
500 ml of deionized water was put in a 1,000 ml glass<br>
beaker, 0.15 g of anhydrous magnesium hydroxide was<br>
added, followed by stirring for dissolution, and then the<br>
dispersion was cooled in an ice bath, and 5 g of titanium<br>
tetrachloride was dropped with stirring. When the liquid<br>
became acidic, magnesium hydroxide was dissolved and<br>
formation of hydrogen chloride was terminated, the liquid<br>
was taken out from the ice bath, and a 25% aqueous<br>
ammonia was dropped with stirring until the pH of the<br>
liquid became 8, to form precipitates of a titanium-<br>
containing composite hydroxide. The formed precipitates<br>
of the titanium-containing composite hydroxide were<br>
separated from the supernatant liquid by centrifugal<br>
segmentation at 2,500 revolutions for 15 minutes, washed<br>
with deionized water five times, and then subjected to<br>
centrifugal segmentation at 2,500 revolutions for 15<br>
minutes for solid-liquid separation, and the obtained<br>
solid was dried under reduced pressure at 70°C under 10<br>
Torr for 18 hours to produce a solid titanium-containing<br>
compound as a polymerization catalyst B for a polyester.<br>
The obtained solid titanium-containing compound had a<br>
molar ratio of titanium atoms : magnesium atoms of 91:9<br>
and a molar ratio of titanium atoms : hydroxyl groups of<br>
1:0.3.<br>
PRODUCTION OF POLYESTER<br><br>
Melt polycondensation was carried out in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1 except that into the<br>
polycondensation tank to which the esterification<br>
reaction product was transported, no ethylene glycol<br>
solution of ethyl acid phosphate was added, and that<br>
through a pipe, instead of the catalyst A-3, the above<br>
obtained catalyst B in the form of a 1 wt% slurry having<br>
pulverized products of the catalyst at a level of 10 urn<br>
dispersed in ethylene glycol (the slurry had a turbidity<br>
of 50% in a light path length of 10 mm) was added in such<br>
an amount that the total amount T as titanium atoms per 1<br>
ton of the obtained polyester would be 0.251 mol/ton.<br>
Then, solid phase polycondensation was carried out to<br>
produce a polyester, and evaluations were carried out in<br>
the same manner. The results are shown in Table 2. At<br>
the time of addition of the ethylene glycol slurry of the<br>
catalyst B through the pipe, an increase and a change in<br>
pressure occurred, which are considered to be due to<br>
scaling in the pipe, and stable addition over a long<br>
period was difficult.<br>
In Comparative Example 1-3, a polycondensation<br>
catalyst having a low m/t ratio was added in the form of<br>
a solid, as compared with Example 1. Resultingly, the<br>
polycondensation velocity was low, and the obtained<br>
polyester had impaired color tone and transparency.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1-4<br>
PREPARATION OF POLYMERIZATION CATALYST FOR A POLYESTER<br><br>
IN ACCORDANCE WITH REFERENCE EXAMPLE 11 OF JP-A-2003-<br>
82084<br>
500 ml of deionized water was weighed in a 1,000 ml<br>
glass beaker, and 0.15 g of anhydrous magnesium hydroxide<br>
was added and dispersed. After the liquid was cooled in<br>
an ice bath, 5 g of titanium tetrachloride was dropped<br>
wit stirring. The liquid became acidic along with<br>
dropping, and the dispersed magnesium hydroxide was<br>
dissolved. When formation of hydrogen chloride was<br>
terminated, the liquid was taken out from the ice bath,<br>
and a 25% aqueous ammonia was dropped with stirring at<br>
room temperature to bring the pH of the liquid 9. Then,<br>
a 15% aqueous acetic acid solution was dropped with<br>
stirring at room temperature to bring the pH of the<br>
liquid 5. Formed precipitates of a titanium-containing<br>
composite hydroxide were separated by filtration. The<br>
precipitates were washed with deionized water 5 times.<br>
The precipitates after washing were immersed in a 20 wt%<br>
ethylene glycol-containing water for 30 minutes, and the<br>
solid-liquid separation was carried out by filtration in<br>
the same manner as washing. The titanium-containing<br>
composite hydroxide after washing was dried under reduced<br>
pressure at 40°C under 1.3 kPa (10 Torr) for 20 hours to<br>
remove moisture, thereby to obtain a solid titanium-<br>
containing compound. The obtained solid titanium-<br>
containing compound was pulverized into particles at a<br>
level of from 10 to 20 µm before it was dissolved in<br><br>
ethylene glycol.<br>
In the solid titanium-containing compound, as<br>
measured by ICP analysis, the metal titanium content was<br>
33 wt% and the metal magnesium content was 3 wt%. Then,<br>
100 g of ethylene glycol was weighed in a 200 ml glass<br>
flask, and 0.5 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid was added, and<br>
then 0.36 g of the above solid titanium-containing<br>
compound was added and heated at 150°C for 1 hour for<br>
dissolution, to produce a polycondensation catalyst D for<br>
a polyester.<br>
The solution had a titanium content of 0.12 wt% as<br>
measured by ICP analysis, and the solution had a<br>
turbidity of 5% in a light path length of 10 mm as<br>
measured by the above method.<br>
PRODUCTION OF POLYESTER<br>
Melt polycondensation was carried out in the same<br>
manner as in Example 1 except that into the<br>
polycondensation tank to which the esterification<br>
reaction product was transferred, through a pipe thereof,<br>
instead of the catalyst A-3, the catalyst D was added in<br>
such an amount that the total amount T as titanium atoms<br>
per 1 ton of the obtained polyester would be 0.104<br>
mol/ton. Then, solid phase polycondensation was carried<br>
out to produce a polyester, and evaluations were carried<br>
out in the same manner. The results are shown in Table<br>
2.<br>
In Comparative Example 1-4, a polycondensation<br><br>
catalyst having a low m/t ratio was added in the form of<br>
a solution as compared with Example 1. Resultingly, the<br>
polycondensation velocity was low, and the obtained<br>
polyester had impaired color tone and transparency.<br>
EXAMPLE 2-1<br>
PREPARATION OF POLYMERIZATION CATALYST FOR A POLYESTER<br>
A polymerization catalyst A-1 for a polyester was<br>
produced in the same manner as in Example 1 except that<br>
the amount of magnesium acetate tetrahydrate was 3.0<br>
parts by weight. The catalyst A-1 contained 6,200 ppm<br>
(0.129 mol/kg) of titanium atoms and 6,200 ppm (0.255<br>
mol/kg) of magnesium atoms, had a pH of 4, and had a<br>
turbidity of 5% in a light path length of 10 mm.<br>
The composition and analyzed values of the catalyst<br>
are shown in Table 1.<br>
PRODUCTION OF POLYESTER<br>
Using a continuous polymerization apparatus<br>
comprising a slurry preparation tank, esterification<br>
reaction tanks of two stages connected in series thereto<br>
and melt polycondensation tanks of three stages connected<br>
in series to the second stage esterification reaction<br>
tank, terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol were<br>
continuously supplied in amount of 865 parts by weight<br>
and 485 parts by weight respectively, to the slurry<br>
preparation tank, and a 0.3 wt% ethylene glycol solution<br>
of ethyl acid phosphate was continuously added in an<br>
amount of 6.0 parts by weight per hour, followed by<br><br>
stirring and mixing to prepare a slurry. This slurry was<br>
continuously transported to the first stage<br>
esterification reaction tank set for an average retention<br>
time of 4 hours in a nitrogen atmosphere at 260°C under a<br>
relative pressure of 50 kPa (0.5 kg/cm2G) and then to the<br>
second stage esterification reaction tank set for an<br>
average retention time of 1.5 hours in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere at 2 60°C under a relative pressure of 5 kPa<br>
(0.05 kg/cm2G) , to carry out an esterification reaction.<br>
At that time, the esterification ratio as measured by the<br>
following method, was 85% in the first stage and 95% in<br>
the second stage.<br>
ESTERIFICATION RATIO<br>
A sample was pulverized in a mortar, 1.0 g thereof<br>
was accurately weighed in a beaker, 40 ml of<br>
dimethylformamide was added thereto, followed by heating<br>
at 180°C for 20 minutes with stirring for dissolution,<br>
and then the wall of the beaker was washed with 10 ml of<br>
dimethyl formamide of 180°C, followed by cooling to room<br>
temperature. This solution was titrated with a 0.1N KOH<br>
methanol solution by means of a Potentiograph "Model E-<br>
536" automatic titration apparatus manufactured by<br>
Metrohm using a composite pH electrode "EA-120". From<br>
the titer (A (ml)) obtained from the inflection point of<br>
a titration curve thus prepared, the factor (f1) of the<br>
0.1N KOH methanol solution prepared and standardized by<br>
the method as disclosed in JIS K8006 and the weight (W<br><br>
(g)) of the sample, the amount (AV (meg/g)) of free<br>
terminal carboxyl groups was obtained from the following<br>
formula:<br><br>
Then, 0.3 g of the sample pulverized in a mortar was<br>
accurately weighed in an Erlenmeyer flask, 20 ml of a<br>
0.5N KOH ethanol solution was added by a transfer<br>
pipette, 10 ml of pure water was further added, a reflux<br>
condenser was set, and the sample was hydrolyzed by<br>
reflux under heating for 2 hours with sometimes stirring<br>
on a plate heater having the surface temperature set at<br>
200°C. After the sample was left to cool, it was<br>
titrated with a 0.5N hydrochloric acid aqueous solution<br>
using phenolphthalein as an indicator. The 0.5N KOH<br>
ethanol solution and the 0.5N hydrochloric acid aqueous<br>
solution were prepared and standardized by the method as<br>
disclosed in JIS K8006. Further, as the phenolphthalein,<br>
one prepared in such a manner that 1 g of phenolphthalein<br>
was dissolved in 90 ml of methanol and adjusted by<br>
distilled water to a constant volume of 100 ml, was used.<br>
Further, titration was carried out under the same<br>
conditions with no sample as a blank. From the titer (Vs<br>
(ml)) of the sample, the titer (Vb (ml)) of the blank,<br>
the factor (f2) of the 0.5N hydrochloric acid aqueous<br>
solution and the weight (W (g)) of the sample, the amount<br>
(SV (meg/g)) of carboxyl groups derived from the total<br>
carboxylic acids was obtained from the following formula:<br><br><br>
Then, from the obtained AV (meg/g) and SV (meg/g),<br>
the esterification ratio (%) was obtained from the<br>
following formula:<br>
Esterification ratio (%) = {(SV-AV)/SV} x 100<br>
Then, at the time of transporting the esterification<br>
reaction product obtained as described above to the melt<br>
polycondensation tank, the catalyst A-1 obtained as<br>
described above was continuously added in an amount of<br>
0.65 part by weight per hour to the esterification<br>
reaction product in the transportation pipe, and the<br>
esterification reaction product was continuously<br>
transported to the first stage melt polycondensation tank<br>
set at 270°C under an absolute pressure of 2.6 kPa (20<br>
Torr), then to the second stage melt polycondensation<br>
tank set at 278°C under an absolute pressure of 0.5 kPa<br>
(4 Torr) and then to the third stage melt<br>
polycondensation tank set at 280°C under an absolute<br>
pressure of 0.3 kPa (2 Torr), to carry out melt<br>
polycondensation by adjusting the total retention time so<br>
that the intrinsic viscosity ([η1] ) of the obtained<br>
polyester would be 0.60 dl/g, whereupon the product was<br>
continuously withdrawn in the form of a strand from a<br>
discharge outlet provided at the bottom of the<br>
polycondensation tank, cooled with water and then cut<br>
into chips to produce melt polycondensed polyester chips.<br>
Then, the polyester chips obtained as obtained above<br><br>
were continuously supplied for crystallization to an<br>
agitation crystallizer held at about 160°C in a nitrogen<br>
atmosphere so that the retention time would be about 60<br>
minutes and then continuously supplied to a tower type<br>
solid phase polycondensation apparatus and subjected to<br>
solid phase polycondensation in a nitrogen atmosphere at<br>
210°C by adjusting the retention time so that the<br>
intrinsic viscosity ([η2]) of the obtained polyester<br>
would be 0.83 dl/g. With respect to the obtained solid<br>
