				<td>This invention relates to aqueous pharmaceutical solutions which are suitable for injection into animals and comprise the antibacterial agent danofloxacin with a magnesium or zinc compound.<br>
It is generally known that quinolone carboxylic acids on injection into a host have a tendency to cause tissue damage at the injection site. One way of alleviating this problem is disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 5,235,054 describing introduction of a 3-carboxyaldehyde prodrug group to replace the 3-carboxy group in certain quinolone carboxylic acids.<br>
U.S. Patent Nos. 4,018,889 and 4,126,680 disclose injectable, high dosage, aqueous solutions of tetracycline antibiotics in the co-solvents 2-pyrrolidone, and caprolactam or 2-piperidone, respectively. The patents also mention addition of magnesium ions to the aqueous solutions to increase the physical stability, minimizing precipitation of the solutions by formation of magnesium-tetracycline chelates.<br>
The present invention improves injection site toleration of injectable aqueous danofloxacin solutions by incorporation of certain metal compounds. It is believed that the metal compounds form complexes with danofloxacin so increasing the solubility thereof in water. It is further believed that the increased water solubility results in the improved toleration at the injection site.<br>
This invention relates to an aqueous pharmaceutical solution which is suitable for injection into a host comprising danofloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount sufficient for the treatment of bacterial infections, and (1) a magnesium compound, or (2) a mixture of a zinc compound with a co-solvent; said compounds and said co-solvent being present in amounts which are sufficient for improved toleration at the injection site.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the magnesium compound is present together with a co-solvent. In a further preferred embodiment the co-solvent of the magnesium compound or the zinc compound is at leasfone of 2-pyrrolidone, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, and N-methyl pyrrolidone, each optionally together with polyvinylpyrrolidone.<br>
The aqueous pharmaceutical solution preferably contains an antioxidant, such as sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate for increased stability. The solution is usually adjusted to a pH of about 5 to about 9.5, preferably from about 6.5 to about 9.0.<br>
The invention also comprises a method for the treatment of bacterial infections in a host by injecting into said host an aqueous pharmaceutical solution comprising danofloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof in an amount sufficient for the treatment of bacterial infections, and a (1) magnesium compound, or a (2) zinc compound in admixture with a co-solvent; said compounds and said co-solvent being present in amounts which are sufficient for improved toleration at the injection site.<br>
Danofloxacin is 1-cyclopropyl-6-fluoro-7-{(1S,4S)-5-methyl-2,5-diazabicyclo[2.2.1 ]hept-2-yl}-4-oxo-3-quinoline carboxylic acid, disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,861,779..<br>
Suitable magnesium compounds of use in the invention include magnesium oxide and magnesium chloride. The magnesium compound is present in amounts that are sufficient to increase injection site toleration. The molar ratio of magnesium to danofloxacin or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof (hereafter "the active compound") usually ranges from about 0.25 to about 2, preferably about 0.8 to 1.2, such as about 1.<br>
The zinc compound of use in the invention includes zinc oxide and zinc acetate. The molar ratio of zinc to the active compound ranges from about 0.3 to about 0.7, preferably about 0.5.<br>
A co-solvent is understood to be a pharmaceutically acceptable liquid that can be added to an injectable formulation. It has been found that the zinc compound must be administered with a co-solvent to be effective in improving the injection site toleration. The amount of co-solvent together with the amount of zinc compound is such that improved injection site toleration is obtained. Small amounts of a few, e.g., 1 to 3, weight percent of co-solvent based on the zinc compound may improve injection site toleration. However, usually higher amounts of about 30 to 50% by weight of co-solvent will be used to obtain optimum injection site toleration.<br>
It was found that a co-solvent when used in combination with a magnesium compound increased the physical stability of the injectable solution containing the magnesium compound. The amounts of co-solvent to be used are from 0 to 50% by weight, usually from about 15 to 45% by weight, based on the magnesium compound.<br>
Examples of co-solvents are at least one of 2-pyrrididone, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and N-methylpyrrolidone. The polyethylene glycol may have a molecular weight of from about 200 to about 400, preferably about 300.<br>
Polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) having a molecular weight of between about 5,000 and 100,000 (K-12 to K-30) may be present in a concentration of from about 1 to 10%, e.g., about 5%, by weight to increase tissue toleration.<br>
The stability of the present aqueous compositions is enhanced by the use of antioxidants at levels of from about 0.01 to about 1.0% by weight. Examples of suitable antioxidants are at least one of sodium metabisulfite, sodium sulfite, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate with ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), sodium thiosulfate, acetylcysteine, thioglycerol, butylated hydroxy anisole (BHA), butylated hydroxy toluene (BHT), a-tocopherol, monoethanolamine, triethanolamine, citric acid, tartaric acid, EDTA, EDTA with citric acid, EDTA with BHA, EDTA with sodium metabisulfite, and triethanolamine with BHA.<br>
The pH of the aqueous compositions of the invention generally ranges from about 5 to about 9.5, suitably from 6.5 to 9.0, most preferably 7.5, to obtain physically stable solutions. Suitable components to adjust the pH include bases and acids, such as sodium hydroxide or monoethanolamine, and hydrogen chloride or lactic acid, respectively.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of danofloxacin include salts with pharmaceutically acceptable acids such as acetic, lactic, succininic, maleic, tartaric, citric, gluconic, ascorbic, benzole, methanesulfonic, cinnamic, furmaric, phosphoric, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, sulfam, pivalic, stearic and sulfonic acid. These salts are prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or suspension of the quinolone compound with about one chemical equivalent of a pharmaceutically acceptable acid.<br>
The solutions of the invention are readily prepared by mixing the co-solvent, when present, with the PVP, when present, and water, until the PVP is dissolved. The solution is conveniently heated, e.g., to 50°C, and the magnesium or zinc compound added. After addition of the active compound and continued stirring, a solution is usually formed. The composition may be held at a slightly elevated temperature during stirring. If necessary, either before or after addition of the active compound, the pH is adjusted by addition of a base or acid, and the remainder of the water is added to form a solution. In general, the solutions are prepared such that exposure to oxygen is reduced to minimize chemical degradation of the ingredients in the solutions.<br>
It has been found that bioavailability and antibacterial activity in vivo of the present pharmaceutical compositions are comparable to those of the prior art.<br>
The pharmaceutical solutions of the invention are conveniently injected into the host such as cattle by subcutaneous injection.<br>
The dosage of the active compound may vary according to administration methods, age and weight of the host, severity of the infection and the like, and usually ranges from about 1 to 10 mg/kg/day. The aqueous solutions of the invention contain the active compound in an amount ranging from about 25 to 300 mg/mL, preferably from about 60 to about 200, such as 180 mg/mL<br>
The following standard procedure was used to evaluate the injection site toleration of the pharmaceutical solutions of the invention. Calves weighing 200-300 kg were injected subcutaneously with a pharmaceutical solution according to the invention either on a milligram per kilogram or on a volume dependent basis. Each formulation was administered at a minimum of three sites. Subcutaneous injections were made in the neck region. The calves were observed immediately post-injection for signs of intolerance (i.e.. pain). Injection sites were observed grossly and palpated to detect swelling at 24 hours post-injection and once weekly for the duration of the 28 day study. At 28 days post-injection, the calves were euthanized. The injection sites were removed and chilled overnight to facilitate examination. Subcutaneous sites were removed with the hide and underlying muscle intact. The injection sites were examined for gross lesions and the character and extent of the gross lesions were evaluated according to standard guidelines.<br>
The subcutaneous injection sites were rated acceptable if there was no necrosis or a small amount of necrosis which could easily be trimmed from the site. They were rated unacceptable if there was marked fascia and/or muscle necrosis.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention and do not limit the scope of the invention to the specific details therein. In general, during manufacture of the formulations in the Examples, exposure of the formulations to oxygen was reduced, e.g. by bubbling nitrogen through them and/or by maintaining a nitrogen head space in the vessel used. The formulations were packaged in vials whose head space was flushed with nitrogen.<br>

was added. The danofloxacin mesylate was added to the resulting slurry, which was then agitated for approximately one hour at about 50°C. The formulation was light brown and contained a considerable amount of suspended material. After cooling to room temperature, it became a semi-solid with a phi of 7.9. Approximately 500 mL of water was added, the pH was adjusted to 6.2 with HCI, and the formulation was agitated overnight. After additional agitation, a clear amber solution was formed with a pH of 5.5 and containing a few large suspended particles. After the pH was adjusted to 6.1 with the NaOH, the formulation was amber and contained some suspended material. A sufficient quantity of water was added to produce a 1500 mL solution at a pH of 6.2.<br>
The solution contained 120 mg/mL of danofloxacin based on a potency of 759 mg/g for the lot of danofloxacin mesylate used.<br>
EXAMPLE 19(Table Removed)The 2-pyrrolidone, the PVP, and a portion of the water necessary to produce 4000 mL of the formulation were combined and agitated until the PVP dissolved. Most of the HCI was added to the solution, then the magnesium oxide was added. The danofloxacin mesylate was added to the resulting slurry to form a dark brown solution with suspended material. After the formulation was agitated overnight and the pH adjusted to 7.5 with the remainder of the HCI, the formulation was dark brown with a<br>
small amount of suspended material. The liquefied phenol was added, the SFS was added, and a sufficient quantity of water was added to produce 4000 mL of a solution with a pH of 7.5.<br>
The solution contained 180 mg/mL of danofloxacin based on a potency of 759 mg/g for the lot of danofloxacin mesylate used.<br>
EXAMPLE 20(Table Removed)A portion of the water, a portion of the N-methylpyrrolidone, and the PVP were combined and agitated until the PVP dissolved. A portion of the HCI was added, and then the magnesium oxide. After addition of the danofloxacin mesylate to the resulting slurry, the formulation was stirred overnight. The clear amber/gold solution having a few suspending particles, was held for an additional 36 hours. The pH of the formulation was 8.0. The remainder of the HCI and the water were added, resulting in a pH of 7.5.<br>
The solution contained 175 mg/mL of danofloxacin based on a potency of 759 mg/g for the lot of danofloxacin mesylate used.<br>
EXAMPLE 21(Table Removed)A portion of the water, the N-methylpyrrolidone, and the PVP were combined and agitated until the PVP dissolved. A portion of the HCI was added, and then the magnesium oxide. After the danofloxacin mesylate was added to the resulting slurry, the formulation was stirred overnight. A clear gold solution with a few suspended particles was formed and held for an additional 36 hours. After the propylene glycol was added, the pH of the formulation was 7.9. The remainder of the HCI and the water were added, resulting in a pH of 7.6.<br>
The solution contained 180 mg/mL of danofloxacin based on a potency of 759 mg/g for the lot of danofloxacin mesylate used.<br><br><br>
