 TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a composition for treatment of external secretion disorders, particularly, to a composition for treatment of hypolacrimation including dry-eye syndrome and hypo salivation including dry-mouth syndrome. The present invention also relates to a method for treatment of external secretion disorders and use of a certain compound for manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition for treatment of external secretion disorders. BACKGROUND ART<br>
External secretions are discharges that are<br>
discharged directly from the exocrine glandular cells or<br>
through the excretory ducts or the like onto the body<br>
surface or into a lumen. Tear and saliva are the typical<br>
external secretions and secretions from the nasal or the<br>
respiratory tract mucosa, secretions from the stomach or<br>
the intestine, discharges from the vagina, perspiration, etc<br>
are also included. Conditions resulting from external<br>
secretion disorders include dryness of various parts of the<br>
body such as "dry-eye syndrome" (exophthalmia), "dry-<br>
mouth	syndrome"(xerostomia),	"dry	nose<br><br>
syndrome"(xeromycteria), "dry-skin syndrome"(xeroderma), and "dry-vagina syndrome"(symptom of vaginal dryness); and chronic pancreatitis, chronic gastritis, and chronic bronchitis due to depression of the external secretion.<br>
"Jorgen’s syndrome", an autoimmune disease, is one of the variety of known and unknown etiologic factors which may responsible for external secretion disorders. Jorgen’s syndrome is characterized by dryness condition due to infiltration of inflammatory cells into the acinus’s of the exocrine gland and around the excretory duct, which results in destruction and atrophy of the acinus’s and the epithelial cells of the duct. Typical symptoms include eye and mouth dryness, as well as dryness of skin, nose, throat, bronchia, vulva, and vagina. For example, dryness of the respiratory tract may induce infections in the lung and sometimes may cause serious disorders such as pneumonia that may lead to death. The other major etiology is aging. Although the external secretion disorders may cause serious diseases as mentioned above, merely symptomatic treatment methods such as artificial hydration have been available for the disorders so far. Therefore, development of a fundamental treatment to improve the depressed external secretion has been desired.<br>
One of the diseases caused by the external secretion   disorders,   and   which   has   been   a   current   keen<br><br>
interest in the medical and pharmaceutical field, is hypolacrimation including dry-eye syndrome.<br>
Dry-eye syndrome is defined as a condition with<br>
decrease or change in quality of tear irrespective of the<br>
presence or absence of corneal and conjunctiva lesion<br>
(Yamada et al.. GANKI 43, 1289-1293(1992)). It include<br>
dry-eye conditions found in the patients of hypolacrimation,<br>
alarms,	xerophthalmia,	Jorgen’s	syndrome,<br>
keratoconjunctivitis sicca, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, ocular pemphigoid, blepharitis marginal, and diabetes, etc.; post-cataract surgery dry eye; allergic conjunctivitis-associated dry eye; and age-related dry-eye syndrome. Further, dry-eye also includes the conditions found in hypolacrimation patients induced by long time visual display terminal (VDT) operations, room dryness due to air-conditioning and the like.<br>
There are various etiologies of the dry-eye<br>
syndrome, including the above described and that have<br>
unidentified.	However,      at     present,     only     palliative<br>
treatments for the dry-eye syndrome including administering an artificial tear solution to increase the quantity of tear retained within the conjunctival sac thereby relieve the subjective symptoms or protecting the eyes from dryness have been available. It has been desired to provide compositions   which    is    capable    of    bringing    satisfactory<br><br>
treatment, including improvement of hypolacrimation.<br>
The tear secretion is classified into basal tear secretion and reflex tear secretion. Basal tear secretion is that under ordinary conditions with the eyelid open, and is considered being mainly from the accessory lachrymals glands e.g. Kraus gland and Wolfing gland. On the other hand, reflux tear secretion is tear secretion in response to some stimulation in the keratoconjunctival surface, nasal mucosa, or the like, or that accompanied with mental changes such as grief or joy. It is considered to be from the main lachrymal gland. Considering the symptoms of the dry-eye syndrome, improvement of the decreased basal tear secretion, i.e. tear secretion under ordinary conditions with the eyelid open, is particularly important.<br>
Further, the diseases caused by external<br>
secretion disorders also include hyposalivation, and it may<br>
be	sometimes	accompanied	by	dry-mouth<br>
syndrome(xerostomia).	In      dry-mouth      patients,      the<br>
decreased amount of saliva secretion causes dryness of the lip and oral cavity and may induce thirst feeling, xerosis of tunica mucosa oris, rustication. dismisses, and dyspepsia. Also, in the patients with dry-mouth syndrome, foods are likely to remain inside the mouth and may result in dental carts.<br>
There  are  a  variety  of  etiologic factors  that  are<br><br>
responsible for the dry-mouth syndrome. For example, systemic factors include febrile disease, dehydration, endocrinopathy (my edema, Base Dow’s disease, diabetes insipid us, etc.) metabolic disorders (diabetes, uremia, liver cirrhosis, etc.) deficiency of Vitamin-A, B, autoimmune disease (Jorgen’s syndrome, progressive scleroderma, etc.) anemia, bleeding, aging, various medicaments (sedatives, parasympatholytic drugs, antihistamines, etc.). Local factors include sialadenitis, atrophy of salivary gland, sequel of radio therapy, and malformation (ectodermal dysphasia, etc.)<br>
As described above, there are a variety of known and unknown etiologic factors responsible for the dry-mouth syndrome. However, at present, only palliative treatments for the dry-mouth syndrome such as drinking liquid all day long little by little, chewing gum or the like, and using artificial saliva have been available. It has been desired to provide a composition which is capable of bringing fundamental treatment such that to improve the decreased saliva secretion.<br>
Generally, a healthy normal person discharges 1 to 1.5 litter of saliva a day through a pair of left and right major salivary glands (including parotid gland, submandibular gland, and sublingual gland) and mirior salivary   glands   (including    labial   glands,    lingual    glands.<br><br>
palatine glands, and buccal glands). Saliva is discharged in response to a stimulant, which may harm body to dilute the same or to maintain the physiological pH value, as well as helping mastication and deglutition of foods. Further, saliva dissolves foods thereby makes a person taste them and helps him smoothly utter words by keeping a wet state inside the mouth. There are two types of saliva: one is the continuous type that keeps on discharging a small amount without a particular stimulant and the other is the reflective type that is discharged in response to stimulation by food, gnash-movement, taste and the like. In any case, saliva secretion is one of the essential physiological functions and hence improving the decreased saliva secretion is particularly important in treating the dry-mouth syndrome.<br>
In the past, some of fatty acids had been rated as<br>
essential, and enough amount of them were required to be<br>
taken     from     the     nutrient     point     of     view.	Recently,<br>
bioactivities of a variety of fatty acids have been studied and the activities of linoleic acid, arachidonic acid, a-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have attracted the attention, linoleic acid is converted through di-homo-y-linolenic acid to arachidonic acid; a-linolenic acid is converted through eicosapentaenoic acid(EPA) to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA);   di-homo- y -linolenic   acid   is   converted   into   type   1<br><br>
prostaglandin (PG,), arachidonic acid is converted into type 2 prostaglandin (POj) or type 4 leukotriene (LT4), and eicosapentaenoic acid is converted into type 3 prostaglandin or type 5 leukotriene (LT5) in vivo respectively.<br>
Prostaglandins (hereinafter, referred to as PG(s)) are members of class of organic carboxylic acids, which are contained in tissues or organs of human or most other mammalian, and exhibit a wide range of physioiogical activity. PGs found in nature (primary PGs) generally have a prostanoic acid skeleton as shown in the formula (A);<br>
(a  chain)<br><br>
COOH<br>
(A)<br>
(o)  chain)<br>
On the other hand, some of synthetic analogues have a modified skeleton. The primary PGs are classified to PGAs. Pubs. PGCs. PGDs, PGEs, PGFs. PGGs, PGHs, PGIs and PGJs according to the structure of the five-member ring moiety, and further classified into the following three types by the number and position of the unsaturated bond at the carbon chain moiety: subscript 1: 1 3,14-unsaturated-1 5-OH subscript 2; 5,6- and 1 3,14-diunsaturated-15-OH<br><br>
subscript 3: 5,6-,  13,14-. and 17.18-triunsaturated-15-OH.<br>
Further, the PGFs are classified, according to the configuration of the hydroxyl group at the 9-position, into type (the hydroxyl group is of an a -configuration) and  type (the hydroxyl group Is of a   -configuration).<br>
In addition, some 15-keto (i.e. having an oxo group at position  15 in place of the hydroxy group) prostaglandins and  1 3,14-dihydro-1 5-keto-prostaglandins are known as substances naturally produced by enzymatic actions during in vivo metabolism of primary PGs.    15-keto PGs have been disclosed in. for example, EP-A-0281239(corresponds to JP-A-104040/89), EP-A-0281480(corresponds to JP-A-52753/89)   . EP-A-0289349 (corresponds to JP-A-1 51 552/89), EP-A-0453127(JP-A-58992/95) and EP-A-0690049(corresponds to JP-A-48665/96).    These cited references are herein incorporated by reference.<br>
For example, when a primary type PG such as PGE2 or PGF2O which is a fatty acid derivative is instilled to t-he eyes at a stimulating amount which induces conjunctival hyperemia, lacrimation will occur simultaneously with the hyperemia. However, at an amount as low as that does not induce any conjunctival hyperemia, it is not known about the effect of the fatty acid derivatives including PGs on the tear secretion, basal tear secretion which is not affected by<br><br>
a stimulant, nor saliva secretion. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a composition and method for treatment of external secretion disorders, especially those useful for treatment of at least one condition selected from hypolacrimation, dry-eye syndrome, hyposalivation and dry-mouth syndrome.<br>
The present inventor found that at an amount as low as that does not induce any conjunctival hyperemia, a fatty acid derivative may improve hypolacrimation, improve basal tear secretion which is not affected by a stimulant, and improve the dry-eye conditions. In addition, the inventor also found that the fatty acid derivative might also improve hyposalivation, and improve dry-mouth conditions.<br>
Therefore, the present invention provides a composition for treatment of external secretion disorders, especially, for treatment of hypolacrimation, dry-eye syndrome, hyposalivation or dry-mouth syndrome, which comprises a fatty acid derivative as an active ingredient.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for treatment of external secretion disorders, which comprises administering an effective amount of a fatty acid to a subject in need of said treatment.<br>
The present invention further provide use of a fatty     acid     derivative    for    producing     a     pharmaceutical<br><br>
composition for treatment of external disorders.<br>
According to this invention, the term "fatty acid" includes not only the above mentioned linoleic acid, di-homo- y -linolenic acid, arachidonic acid, a-linolenic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), but also a compound comprising at least one carboxylic acid moiety irrespective to presence or absence of double bonds, a cyclic group or a substitute group, the number of the carbon atoms, position or number of the double bonds, or a modification on the chain. In addition, the fatty acid derivatives include not only the fatty acids as above but also prostaglandin like compounds which include PGs derived from said fatty acids, leukotriene like compounds, thromboxanes, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acids or their derivatives.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the fatty acid derivatives also include the compound which have at least -COOH or -CH2OH or the functional derivatives(salts, esters, ethers, amides or the like) thereof at the terminal carbon atom, irrespective to presence or absence of double bonds, a cyclic group or a substitute group, the number of the carbon atoms, position or number of the double bonds, or a modification on the chain.<br>
According to the present invention, the term "prostaglandin like compound" (hereinafter, referred as "PG<br><br>
like compound") includes any of derivatives or substituted derivatives of a compound having the prostanolc acid basic structure irrespective to the configuration of the 5-memberd ring, number of double bonds in the a or   chain, presence or absence of hydroxy and oxo groups or any other substituent, or any other modification. Since the PG like compound of the present invention may have an activity as an agonist for PG-receptor such as EP. FP, IP TP or DP receptor, the "PG like compound" of the present invention may include each compound having PG-receptor agonistic activity irrespective to their structure.<br>
The nomenclature of the PG like compounds used herein is based on the numbering system of the prostanoic acid represented in the above formula (A).<br>
The formula (A) shows a basic skeleton of the C-20, but the PG like compounds in the present invention are not limited to those having the same number of carbon atoms. In the formula (A), the numbering of the carbon atoms which constitute the basic skeleton of the PG compounds starts at the carboxylic acid (numbered 1), and carbon atoms in the a-chain are numbered 2 to 7 towards the five-membered ring, those in the ring are 8 to 12, and those in the  -chain are 13 to 20. When the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the a-chain, the number is deleted  In the order starting from position 2; and when the<br><br>
number of carbon atoms is increased in the a-chain, compounds are named as substitution compounds having respective substituents at position 2 in place of carboxy group (C-1). Similarly, when the number of carbon atoms is decreased in the to-chain, the number is deleted in the order starting from position 20; and when the number of carbon atoms is increased in the uj-chain, the carbon atoms over position 20 are named as substituents. Stereochemistry of the compounds is the same as that of the above formula (A) unless otherwise specified.<br>
In general, each of PGD, PGE and PGF represents a PG compound having hydroxy groups at positions 9 and/or 11, but in the present specification, they also include those having substituents other than the hydroxy group at positions 9 and/or 11. Such compounds are referred to as 9-dehydroxy-9-substituted-PG compounds or 11-dehydroxy-11-substitute d-PG compounds. A PG compound having hydrogen in place of the hydroxy group is simply named as 9- or 11-dehydroxy compound.<br>
As stated above, the nomenclature of the PG like compounds is based on the prostanoic acid skeleton. However, in case the compound has a similar partial construction as a prostaglandin, the abbreviation of "PG" may be used. Thus, a PG compound of which a-chain is extended   by   two   carbon   atoms;   that   is,   having   9   carbon<br><br>
atoms in the a-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-{2-carboxyethyl)-PG compound. Similarly, a PG compound having 11 carbon atoms in the a-chain is named as 2-decarboxy-2-(4-carboxybutyl)-PG compound, and a PG compound having 10 carbon atoms in the ω-chain is named as 20-ethyl-PG compound. These compounds, however, may also be named according to the lUPAC nomenclatures.<br>
The PG like compounds used in the present invention may include any of PG derivatives. Accordingly, for example, a PG, compound having a double bond at 13-14 position and a hydroxy group at 15-position, a PG2 compound having another double bond at 5-6 position, a PG3 compound having further double bond at 17-18 position, a 15-keto-PG compound having an oxo group in place of the hydroxy group at the 15-position, a 15-dehydroxy-PG compound having a hydrogen atom in place of the hydroxy group at the 15-position. or either 13,14-dihydro-PG compound wherein the double bond at 13-14 position is single bond, or 13,14-didehydro-PG compound wherein the double bond at the 13-14 position is triple bond. Moreover, examples of substituted compounds and derivatives include a compound wherein the terminal carboxyl group in the a-chain of the above described compound is esterified, a physiologically acceptable salt thereof, a compound wherein the number of carbon atoms in the a- or ω-chain is<br><br>
decreased or increased, a compound having side chains<br>
(e.g., 1 to 3 carbon atoms) on a- or u)-chains, a compound<br>
having substituent(s) such as hydroxy, halogen, lower alkyl,<br>
hydroxy(lower)alkyl, and oxo, or double bond(s) on the five-<br>
membered ring, a compound having substituent(s), such as<br>

Test Example 1:	Effect    on     whole     tear    secretion     of<br>
normal rabbits. (1)Test anima'is<br>
Male Japanese albino  rabbits  (Std:JW/CSK) were<br><br>
used.<br>
(2)Method of administration<br>
Ophthalmic solution comprising 0.001% of 13,14-dihydro-1 5-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGEi as an active ingredient of the present invention was prepared and used as a test composition. As a control, the vehicle of said solution without the active ingredient was used.<br>
Each   of  the  compositions  was  instilled   singly  to eight    eyes    at    the    amount    of    30     p.   I/eye.        After    the administration, the time course of the tear secretion change was examined according to the following method. (3)Examination Whole tear secretion<br>
Before (0 hour) and 0.5, 2, 4, and 6 hours after the instillation, the whole tear secretion was determined.<br>
Under no anesthetization, one edge of the Schirmer's test strip (Showa Yakuhin Kako Co., Ltd., Lot No. 70080) was inserted into the conjunctival sac of the each test animal. One minute after, the strip was removed and the length of the moisted part was read from the scale provided on the strip to determine the amount of whole tear secretion. (4)ResuIt<br>
The result of the whole tear secretion test Is shown   in   the  Table   1.     No  stimulating   response,   such   as<br><br>
rubor in the front of the eye was observed after the administration in both of the test animals and the control animals.<br>
These   data   are   shown   simultaneously   with   the statistical analysis.<br><br>
#p
According to the above result, the test group comprising the compound of the present invention as an active ingredient caused a significant increase of the amount of whole tear secretion at a dose which does not induce any stimulating response such as rubor in the front of the eye. Therefore, the compound of the present invention was revealed to have an activity to increase the . amount of tear secretion without any stimulating response.<br><br>
Test Example 2: Effect of the compound on decreased whole tear secretion, decreased basal tear secretion and keratoepithelial lesion in rabbit dry-eye syndrome model, which was induced by trigeminal denervation.<br>
(1)	Test animals<br>
Fifteen	male	Japanese	albino	rabbits<br>
(Std:JW/CSK) were used.<br>
(2)	Generating rabbit dry-eye syndrome model by trigeminal<br>
denervation.<br>
i) Operational procedure<br>
Urethane (ALDRICH) was administered i.p. at the dose of Ig/kg to the rabbits of which occipital hair had been shaved.<br>
After disinfection of the shaved area, midline incision of the skin was made from the frontal bone to the ear root, and the muscular tissue around the periosteum, temporal bone and manidibular articular process were detached. After the detachment, a hole of 2 X1.5 cm in size was made in the bone from the parietal medial region to the temporal region by means of the bone drill (URAWA KOGYO Co.. Ltd. MINITOR C-130) under the surgical microscope (KONAN CAMERA R&amp;l Inc.. PMO-50). Then, the dura was detached from the cranial bone while cotton bud was kept inserted between the temporal bone and the dura.     After  the   detachment   was   made   up  to   the   cranial<br><br>
base, detachment was further made toward the medial border of the petrous part of temporal bone in the carnial cavity, to find the trigeminal nerve in the pretrous part. Then, the dura of about 1 to 2 mm on the nasal side of the semilunar ganglion was incised. After the incision, the two branches of nerve fascicle, i.e. the first branch (ocular nerve) of the trigeminal nerve and the second branch (maxillary nerve) were pulled laterally and cut with corneoscleral scissors. Immediately after the operation, miosis of the ipsilateral eye was confirmed and then the cotton kept inserted was removed, and the skin at the head was closed with suture. After the operation, an antibiotic (MYCILLIN SOL® Meiji) was administered i.m. at the dose of 0.1 ml/kg.<br>
The trigeminal denervation was made only on the left eye side, while on the right eye side, no trigeminal denervation nor sham operation was made.<br>
After the   operation,   animals   in   stable   state   and showed   decreased   whole   tear   secretion,   decreased   basal tear  secretion,   and   keratoepithelial   lesion  were   subjected to the following test. (3) Method of administration.<br>
13,14-dihydro-15-keto-16,16-difluoro-PGE, was used as an active ingredient of the present invention to prepare  test  eyedrops  containing   0.0001%   and   0.001%   of<br><br>
the   compound.    As   a  control,  the  vehicle  of the  eyedrops without the active ingredient was used.<br>
Each of the compositions was instilled to the eyes everyday at the volume of 30 ^ I/eye two times a day (at 10:00 and 18:00) for two weeks. Five eyes per each of the test groups and the control group were treated and then examined for the whole tear secretion, the basal tear secretion and the keratoepithelial lesion as follows. (4) Examination i) Whole tear secretion (Schirmer's Test)<br>
Before the start of the instillation (week 0), and 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the start, the whole tear secretion was measured two hours after the first instillation on the day of examination.<br>
Under no anesthetization, one edge of the Schirmer's test strip (Showa Yakuhin Kako Co., Ltd., Lot No. 70080) was inserted into the conjunctival sac of each test animal. One minute after, the strip was removed and the length of the moistened part was read from the scale provided on the strip to determine the amount of whole tear secretion, ii) Basai tear secretion<br>
Before the start of the instillation (week 0), and 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the start, the basal tear secretion was nreasured 2-hours after the* 1st instiliation on the day of the<br><br>
examination.<br>
Keratoconjunctiva	was	anesthetized	by<br>
instillation of 4% Mdocaine (Xylocaine® 4% for ophthalmic solution; Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.), the eye drops and the tear around the eyelid were wiped off about 5 minutes after and loss of keratoconjunctival esthesia was confirmed with the Cochet-Bonnet type esthesiometer. Then, one edge of the Shirmer's test strip was inserted into the conjunctival sac and kept there for 5 minutes. The length of the moistened part was read from the scale on the strip.<br>
The basal tear secretion was expressed by mean value per minute calculated from the 4-minutes value obtained by subtracting the initial 1-minute value from the 5-minutes Sirmer's test, so that the spontaneous volume of the tear retained in the conjunctival sac might be excluded, iii) Keratoepitheiial lesion<br>
Before the start of instillation (week 0) and 1,2, and 3 weeks after the start* the keratoepitheiial lesion was evaluated two hours after the first instillation on the day of examination.<br>
Each animal was placed in a stainless steel fixator, and given instillation of 50jul of the mixture of 1% rose bengal and 1% fluorescein to stain their keratoconjunctival    epithelium.^      Stained    area,     i.e.    the<br><br>
abnormal   area   on   the  epitheiium   was  evaluated   according to the criteria shown in the Table 2.<br><br>
(5) Results<br>
The result of the whole tear secretion is shown in the Table 3, that of the basal tear secretion is shown in the Table A, and that of the keratoepithelial lesion is shown in the Table 5.    Statistical analysis is also shown with the data.<br><br><br>

The   rate   (%)   of   increased   amount   of  whole   tear secretion was calculated at the 2 hours after the instillation compared with the before (0 hour). (4) Result<br>
The result of the whole tear secretion test is shown in the Table 7. In addition to the data in the table, no stimulating response, such as rubor, in the front of the eye was observed after the administration of test compounds.<br><br><br>
