				<td>IMAGE PROJECTION SYSTEM COMPRISING A SINGLE IMAGER<br>
WHICH IS EQUIPPED WITH PHOTOSENSITIVE SENSORS FOR THE<br>
IDENTIFICATION OF ILLUMINATION COLOURS.<br>
The invention relates to image projection systems<br>
and/or image display systems comprising a light valve<br>
or spatial light modulator (SPL), comprising a pixel<br>
matrix array, for example liquid crystal on silicon<br>
substrate (LCOS), digital micro-mirror device/display<br>
(DMD) , or high temperature polysilicon (HTPS) , disposed<br>
in rows and in columns on a substrate forming an active<br>
matrix, mainly of silicon, an illumination system of<br>
this light valve for moving bands of different colored<br>
light, or "color scrolling", over the light valve<br>
perpendicularly to said rows, means for identifying the<br>
illumination color on each row or on each group of rows<br>
of pixels of the light valve, means of managing video<br>
data of said images for controlling the writing of the<br>
pixels of the light valve, means of synchronizing the<br>
video data sent to each row of the light valve<br>
according to the illumination color of said row<br>
identified by said identification means.<br>
The image projection systems, commonly called<br>
projectors or back projectors according to whether the<br>
projection is from the front of the screen for<br>
projectors or from the back for back projectors,<br>
operate according to the same principle. An<br>
illumination system uniformly lights one or more light<br>
valves, the light is modulated after passing through<br>
the light valve (s) in the case of the transmissive<br>
light valves or after reflection on the light valve(s)<br>
in the case of the reflective light valves. The duly<br>
modulated light is then projected onto a screen.<br>
For some years now, the trend has been towards singlelight-<br>
valve, or single-valve, transmissive or<br>
reflective type image projection systems, that are<br>
smaller, offer a lower light efficiency but are less<br>
expensive than the multiple-light-valve image<br>
projection systems.<br>
To generate color images, the projection systems of<br>
this type sequentially display images of different<br>
colors on the screen, normally the three primary colors<br>
red, green and blue (RGB) , fast enough for the human<br>
eye not to perceive the changes of color on the screen.<br>
These image projection systems normally comprise<br>
illumination devices for illuminating the single light<br>
valve of an alternately red, green and blue light by<br>
the use of color wheels, or partially red, green and<br>
blue at the same time in the form of light bands by<br>
"color scrolling", and scrolling perpendicularly to the<br>
rows of the pixel array of the light valve, by the use<br>
of systems that are described briefly below. The video<br>
data controlling the writing of the pixels must then be<br>
synchronized according to the color that each pixel<br>
receives in order to form an image that is free of<br>
defects for the viewer such as an inappropriate mix of<br>
colors or a lowering of the contrasts of the image on<br>
the screen.<br>
In these systems, the synchronization between the<br>
illumination system and the video data controlling the<br>
writing of the pixels of the light valve is handled by<br>
synchronization means that on the one hand measure a<br>
position signal of the element of the illumination<br>
system originating the scrolling of the different<br>
colored light bands on the light valve to inform said<br>
synchronization means of the illumination color of the<br>
light sent to each pixel of the light valve by the<br>
color wheel or the illumination system, and on the<br>
other hand control the writing of the pixels according<br>
to said measured signal. This synchronization is<br>
relatively easy if the light valve is illuminated<br>
alternately by a red, green and blue light, by the use<br>
of the color wheel, for example, but it becomes more<br>
complicated when the illumination of the light valve,<br>
or to be more precise, the color of the incident light<br>
on the liqht: valve, is made up of said bands of<br>
different colored light and varies according to the<br>
rows of pixels of the light valve. In particular, in<br>
order to sÂ£^feguard against the bleeding of colors into<br>
each other (crosstalk), which causes a deterioration of<br>
the quality of the image and in particular a loss of<br>
contrast, the synchronization means are normally<br>
programmed with safety margins in the generation of the<br>
video data.<br>
The document US 5 416 514 describes a projection system<br>
with a transmissive light valve comprising an<br>
illumination system (references 10, 12, 14, 16 in<br>
figure 1 of the document) separating the white light<br>
from a light source into bands of different colored<br>
light by the use of a dichroic mirror device (reference<br>
12 in figure 1 of the document). After passing through<br>
an assembly of rotating prisms moved by a motor<br>
(reference 14 in figure 1 of the document) and lenses<br>
(reference 16 in figure 1 of the document), rectangular<br>
bands of different colors scroll over the light valve<br>
(reference 18 in figure 1 of the document) alternately.<br>
In this document, and in reference to figure 6, the<br>
video data (reference 112) from a video source<br>
(reference 110) is sent to a video memory (reference<br>
114) and controlled by a control circuit (reference<br>
140) which receives a synchronization signal SYNC<br>
(reference 118) from the video source (reference 112).<br>
The video data output from the video memory (reference<br>
114) is then sent for writing to the light valve<br>
(reference 122) . A second control circuit (reference<br>
142), linked to the first control circuit (reference<br>
140) for receiving in particular the synchronization<br>
signal SYNC (reference 118), controls the reading<br>
(reference 130) of the video memory (reference 114) and<br>
the writing (reference 132) of the pixels of the light<br>
valve (reference 122). The motor (reference 125),<br>
actuating the rotation of the prisms rotating in the<br>
illumination system (reference 124) , is locked onto the<br>
second control circuit (reference 142) to obtain the<br>
rotation of the prisms rotating in accordance with the<br>
synchronization signal SYNC (reference 118), so leading<br>
to a scrolling of the different color light bands over<br>
the light valve in synchronization with the video data<br>
controlling the writing of the optical valves. The<br>
control circuit (reference 142) also receives signals<br>
in real time on the position, or phase, of the rotating<br>
prism assembly from a position encoder (reference 127)<br>
incorporated in the illumination system. For each<br>
position, or phase, of the rotating prism assembly<br>
there is a corresponding unique position on the light<br>
valve of the different color light bands, and the<br>
position encoder (reference 127) , which supplies this<br>
position, or phase, signal, here constitutes a means of<br>
identification of the illumination color of each row of<br>
the light valve.<br>
The means of identifying the illumination color of each<br>
row of pixels comprising the device for measuring the<br>
instantaneous position of the rotating prism assembly<br>
does however have the drawback of relying on the<br>
measurement of an assembly of high-inertia mechanical<br>
elements, the prisms, which is liable, with time and<br>
the rotation stresses to which it is subject, to become<br>
misadjusted and introduce an offset, however slight,<br>
between the measurement of the position of the rotating<br>
prism assembly presumed to inform the synchronization<br>
means of the illumination color of the light sent to<br>
each pixel of the light valve, and the real position of<br>
the different color light bands on the pixel array of<br>
the light valve. This offset then leads to defects of<br>
synchronization, color mix and a loss of contrasts as<br>
stated previously.<br>
One of the critical points is the mechanical assembly<br>
of the rotating prism device. A rectangular slot,<br>
located in front of each rotating prism, is normally<br>
imaged on the screen. Its position, in particular in<br>
the vertical plane of the light valve is critical, and<br>
its rotation can lead to errors that the prism<br>
synchronization system cannot detect.<br>
In the case of an illumination system in which a color<br>
wheel is used with helical red, green and blue bands<br>
(otherwise known as a scrolling color wheel, SCR)<br>
introduced in the Texas Instrument patent EP1098536,<br>
adjustment and fabrication tolerances make the<br>
synchronization of the scrolling of the light bands on<br>
the light valve and the video data difficult.<br>
Furthermore, the bands scrolling on the light valve are<br>
slightly curved, which is not the case with the use of<br>
rotating prisms or a rotating drum.<br>
The documents E1199896 - HITACHI - and US2002/0149749 -<br>
PHILIPS - describe projection systems with scrolling of<br>
different color bands on the light valve, which present<br>
the same risks of error on the identification of the<br>
illumination color; no photosensitive sensor is used in<br>
these systems to identify the illumination color<br>
directly or indirectly at each instant.<br>
One object of the invention is to avoid the<br>
abovementioned problems.<br>
To this end, the invention relates to an image<br>
projection system comprising a light valve comprising a<br>
pixel matrix array disposed in rows and columns on a<br>
substrate forming an active matrix, an illumination<br>
system for moving bands of different colored light over<br>
the light valve, perpendicularly to said rows, means<br>
for identifying the illumination color of each row of<br>
pixels of the light valve, means of managing video data<br>
of said light valves for controlling the writing of<br>
said pixels of the light valve, means of synchronizing<br>
the video data sent to each row of pixels of the light<br>
valve according to the illumination color of said row<br>
identified by said identification means, characterized<br>
in that the identification means comprise at least one<br>
photosensitive sensor disposed level with said pixels<br>
of the light valve.<br>
According to a variant of the invention, each sensor is<br>
disposed level with a row of pixels of the light valve,<br>
and there are fewer sensors than there are rows of<br>
pixels, and the projection system comprises calculation<br>
means for deducing the illumination color of the rows<br>
of pixels that are not provided with a sensor according<br>
to data delivered by said sensors.<br>
This variant will now be described in the particular<br>
case in which the light valve is provided only with a<br>
single photosensitive sensor as the means of<br>
identifying the illumination color of each row of<br>
pixels of the light valve: in practice, this single<br>
sensor is, for example, positioned on the light valve<br>
level with a specific row of pixels; this single sensor<br>
is designed to identify the illumination color of the<br>
pixeIs of t:his row.<br>
According to this single-sensor variant, the projection<br>
system comprises calculation means designed to deduce,<br>
from the illumination color of the pixels of this<br>
specific row of pixels, the illumination color of each<br>
row of pixels of the light valve. These calculation<br>
means incorporate data relating to the width of the<br>
color bands illuminating the light valve, where<br>
appropriate, the width of black bands interposed<br>
between the color bands, and/or the speed of movement<br>
of the bands perpendicularly to the rows.<br>
The illumination color of each row of pixels of the<br>
light valve can be identified as follows:<br>
- during the movement of the color bands, the<br>
photosensitive sensor notes the instant of each change<br>
or transition of color band at the level of the<br>
specific row of pixels; this data is transmitted to the<br>
calculation means, which, in a known manner, deduces<br>
from it a given position of the color bands on the<br>
light valve at that instant,<br>
- from the time interval that elapses between two<br>
successive changes, the calculation means deduce the<br>
speed of movement of the color bands,<br>
- from the transition instants, from the position of<br>
the color bands at these instants, and from the speed<br>
of movement of the bands, the calculation means<br>
calculate the position of the color bands at each<br>
instant and, from this, deduce the illumination color<br>
of each row of pixels of the light valve at each<br>
instant.<br>
The same variant is applied in the case where the light<br>
valve is provided with a plurality of sensors, each<br>
positioned level with a row of pixels, the number of<br>
sensors being less the number of rows: each sensor is<br>
used to identify directly the illumination color of the<br>
row of pixels with which it is associated and can be<br>
used to identify indirectly, using the calculation<br>
means described previously, the illumination color of<br>
the rows of pixels that are not provided with sensors.<br>
Preferably, in the projection system according to the<br>
invention, the identification means comprise at least<br>
one photosensitive sensor level with each row of pixels<br>
of the light valve (12) and each sensor of a row is<br>
designed to identify the illumination color of that<br>
row. This then avoids the abovementioned calculation<br>
means and a more reliable and precise identification of<br>
the illumination colors of each row of pixels is<br>
obtained.<br>
The photosensitive sensor of each row of pixels of the<br>
light valve thus identifies directly or "a posteriori",<br>
in real time and reliably, the color of the light<br>
actually received by each pixel of one and the same<br>
row, and not indirectly as in the case of a single<br>
sensor for all of the light valve, or "a priori" as<br>
described in the prior art. The direct identification<br>
of the illumination color results in a better<br>
synchronization of the video data controlling the<br>
writing of the pixels of the light valve with the true<br>
identified illumination color. The synchronization,<br>
performed for each row of pixels in turn, in particular<br>
allows the use of sophisticated illumination systems<br>
producing, for example, a scrolling of different color<br>
light bands, or "color scrolling", without requiring<br>
complex processing of the video data. This means that<br>
each pixel of one and the same row can be written as<br>
early as possible, and therefore the safety margins<br>
programmed in certain synchronization means for<br>
processing the video data and preserving the purity of<br>
the colors can be reduced. The result is an overall<br>
gain in brightness.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the photosensitive<br>
sensor positioned level with the pixels of the light<br>
valve or each row of pixels of the light valve is<br>
incorporated in the substrate, normally silicon, of the<br>
light valve.<br>
The photosensitive sensor(s) should be illuminated at<br>
the place where the light beam still has the same<br>
characteristics as the useful light beam illuminating<br>
the active area of the light valve. The logic circuits<br>
controlling the rows and columns of pixels of the light<br>
valve are normally etched on the substrate, so each<br>
photosensitive sensor advantageously has a circuit<br>
etched on the same substrate as that supporting the<br>
pixels of the light valve. Furthermore, the integration<br>
advantageously performed during the light valve<br>
fabrication process without significantly increasing<br>
either the size of the component or the production<br>
costs, given that there is sufficient space on the<br>
substrate of the light valve to include on it the<br>
photosensitive sensors and their connectors with the<br>
other circuits of the light valve, and given that the<br>
control circuits and these sensors can be formed by<br>
similar technologies.<br>
According to a characteristic, said photosensitive<br>
sensor is designed to measure the illumination<br>
intensity received by the row of pixels of the light<br>
valve at the level of which it is positioned. The<br>
modulation of the light by the light valve to form the<br>
images is normally performed according to three<br>
principles, A first principle is the attenuation of the<br>
light for a fixed period, the second is the modulation<br>
of the period without the light being attenuated, and<br>
the third is the generation of pulses of variable<br>
durations similar to a binary code. Knowing the<br>
intensity of the illumination light makes it possible<br>
to optimize the adjustment, depending on the case, of<br>
the attenuation value, the pulse duration or the code<br>
generated, and to restore the colors with greater<br>
accuracy. Light flicker phenomena are generally induced<br>
by the light: source and produce spurious variations of<br>
the light intensity on the light valve. The<br>
photosensitive sensors perceive these low frequency<br>
beat phenomena and send the corresponding signals to<br>
the video data management means which then<br>
advantageously correct the writing of the pixels of the<br>
light valve so as to compensate for these phenomena.<br>
Since the wear of the light source contributes to<br>
increasing the flicker phenomena over time, the<br>
presence of photosensitive sensors on the light valve<br>
advantageously preserves quality images throughout the<br>
life of the source.<br>
Preferably, said at least one photosensitive sensor<br>
positioned level with each row of optical valves of the<br>
light valve is associated with a colored filter. The<br>
colored filter associated with the photosensitive<br>
sensor is used on the one hand for precise<br>
identification of the color of the light received, in<br>
this instance the same color as that of the colored<br>
filter, and on the other hand to measure the light<br>
intensity of said colored light illuminating the row of<br>
pixels level with which the photosensitive sensor is<br>
positioned. A configuration comprising at least three<br>
photosensitive sensors level with each row of pixels of<br>
the light valve, each associated with a different color<br>
filter, for example RGB, can advantageously be used to<br>
precisely identify the three primary colors RGB of the<br>
light bands received by each row of pixels and measure<br>
their light, intensity in real time. This way, the time<br>
variation and the level of each of the three RGB<br>
signals are used to adjust and synchronize the video<br>
dat^i for the three colors.<br>
Preferably, said colored filter associated with the<br>
photosensitive sensor of each row of pixels of the<br>
light valve forms a continuous band associated with the<br>
set of photosensitive sensors of each row of pixels of<br>
the light valve responsible for identifying a<br>
particular color, for example red, green or blue. The<br>
colored filter thus forms a colored band that is simple<br>
to produce, that is arranged, for example, by<br>
multilayer deposition or deposition of absorbent layers<br>
etched on the glass plate covering the light valve,<br>
facing the row of the or each photosensitive sensor<br>
located level with each row of pixels of the light<br>
valve.<br>
The invention will be better understood on reading the<br>
description that follows, given by way of nonlimiting<br>
example, and with reference to the appended figures in<br>
which:<br>
- figure 1 diagrammatically represents the main<br>
elements of a single-valve image projection system;<br>
- figure 2 presents a light valve, for example of LCOS<br>
type, comprising, according to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, at least one photosensitive sensor<br>
for each row of pixels;<br>
- figure 3 presents a diagram describing the means of<br>
synchronizing video data for synchronizing the video<br>
data with the illumination color on the light valve<br>
according to the invention;<br>
- figure 4 describes the transverse cross section<br>
through a row of pixels on one side of an LCOS type<br>
light valve 12, according to the preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, at least one photosensitive sensor<br>
121 level with each row of pixels 120 according to the<br>
invention;<br>
- figure 5 presents a light valve, for example of LCOS<br>
type, comprising three photosensitive sensors for each<br>
row of pixels according to a variant of the preferred<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br>
In order to simplify the description and disclose the<br>
differences and advantages presented by the invention<br>
compared to the prior art, identical references are<br>
used for those elements that provide the same<br>
functions.<br>
A single-valve projection system is diagrammatically<br>
represented in figure 1. The system comprises an<br>
illumination system 1 mainly comprising a light source<br>
2 which sends light to a device 10 responsible for<br>
separating the light into different color light beams,<br>
for example in different color light bands, through an<br>
intermediate optical device 3, normally a collimation<br>
device. In this respect, there are different devices<br>
for forming on the single light valve scrolling colored<br>
light bands, red, green and blue for example, in<br>
particular by the use of helical filtered color wheels,<br>
described in Texas Instruments patent EP1098536, or by<br>
the use of rotating prism devices described for example<br>
in the paper by Matthew S. Brennesholtz, SID<br>
Information Display, pages 20 to 22, 07/2002 or Philips<br>
patent US6097352. Another type of device for<br>
illuminating the light valve with different color light<br>
bands consists in sending the light from the light<br>
source on oscillating colored filter bands as described<br>
in Olympus patent JP60-053901. These different devices<br>
will not be; described further.<br>
The light from an illumination system 1 illuminates a<br>
transmissive or reflective light valve 12 comprising a<br>
pixel array, the writing of which is managed by a video<br>
data generator, not shown here, mainly associated with<br>
synchronization means 11 for synchronizing the light<br>
from the pixel illumination system with the video data<br>
from the video data generator or, conversely, for<br>
synchronizing the video data controlling the writing of<br>
the pixels of the light valve 12 to modulate the<br>
incident light, according to the illumination color of<br>
the light on these valves. After transmission, or<br>
reflection, on the light valve 12, the duly modulated<br>
light is projected onto a screen 5 via an optical<br>
device 4. The devices 3 and 4, and the light source 2,<br>
are known per se and will not be described further.<br>
Figure 2 shows a light valve 12 comprising, according<br>
to a preferred embodiment of the invention, at least<br>
one photosensitive sensor 121 level with each row of<br>
pixels 120. The light valve 12 comprises a pixel matrix<br>
array 120, for example of the liquid crystal on silicon<br>
(LCOS) type or of the digital micromirror device (DMD)<br>
type, the writing of which is controlled by the video<br>
data generator and the synchronization means not shown<br>
in figure 2. The or each photosensitive sensor 121 is<br>
incorporated in the substrate of the light valve 12,<br>
for example on the silicon substrate in the case of an<br>
LCOS type light valve. According to a first embodiment,<br>
a single photosensitive sensor 121 without colored<br>
filter is incorporated in the substrate 100 level with<br>
each row of pixels 120 of the light valve 12, all of<br>
these sensors 121 then forming, for example, a column<br>
of sensors; 121. When one of these photosensitive<br>
sensors 122 is illuminated, like the row of pixels with<br>
which it is associated, by a colored light band, it<br>
transmits a signal corresponding to the perceived<br>
illumination color. The signal will be different if the<br>
illumination color changes. This signal difference is<br>
enough to identify, in the video data generator, the<br>
illumination color on each row of pixels 120 of the<br>
light valve 12. According to a variant of this<br>
embodiment, a photosensitive sensor 121 is incorporated<br>
in the substrate of the light valve on either side of<br>
each row of the pixel array of the light valve 12, in<br>
order to have a more reliable and symmetrical<br>
measurement of the received illumination.<br>
According to a variant that will now be described,<br>
three photosensitive sensors 121' are incorporated<br>
level with each row of pixels 120. According to other<br>
embodiments, the photosensitive sensors 121 are<br>
incorporated in the substrate of the light valve 12<br>
within the very pixel array 120 of the light valve 12,<br>
or on the substrate of the transparent plate, normally<br>
of glass, receiving the counter-electrode.<br>
With reference to figure 3, there now follows a<br>
description of the synchronization means 11 of a<br>
projection system comprising a rotating prism type<br>
illumination system. A video source 13 supplying mainly<br>
a video scream and a synchronization signal SYNC is<br>
linked to a controller 14 responsible on the one hand<br>
for transmitting the video data 131 to a video data<br>
generator 15 and on the other hand for driving the<br>
mechanical part of the colored band formation device<br>
10. The colored band formation device 10 comprises, for<br>
example, a rotating prism assembly 17 and, in<br>
particular in its mechanical part, a locked motor 16<br>
for rotating the rotating prisms. The controller 14 is<br>
also responsible for synchronizing "a priori", in<br>
particular using the synchronization signal SYNC, the<br>
generation of the video data 131' in the generator 15,<br>
before writing the pixels 120 of the light valve 12,<br>
and the angular position of the rotating prism assembly<br>
17 via a locking device of the drive motor 161. Such<br>
synchronization is known in the prior art, in<br>
particular in Philips document US5416514 (columns 7 and<br>
According to the invention, each photosensitive sensor<br>
121 level with the light valve 12 is, like the row of<br>
pixels 120 with which it is associated, illuminated by<br>
the moving colored light bands, which are projected on<br>
the light valve via the rotating prism assembly 17, and<br>
transmits in real time a signal 18 corresponding to the<br>
perceived illumination color to a signal processing<br>
device 151 in the video data generator 15 for<br>
identification. The illumination color is determined,<br>
for example in the video data generator 15, by<br>
analyzing the received signal level, by knowing a<br>
priori the spectral composition of the light for each<br>
of the red, green or blue states, and the spectral<br>
response of the photosensitive sensor 121. The video<br>
data generator 15 processes the information on color<br>
with the video data corresponding to it to control in<br>
real time the writing of the pixels 120 of each row of<br>
the light valve 12 for which the illumination color is<br>
thus directly identified. This "a posteriori"<br>
synchronization results from the direct identification<br>
of the illumination color on each row of pixels 120: it<br>
is performed in real time and is very accurate.<br>
The identification of the illumination color on each<br>
row of pixels by the presence of the photosensitive<br>
sensors 121 according to the invention, and the "a<br>
posteriori" synchronization 11' associated with it, is<br>
used in particular, in the case of image projection<br>
systems using an "a priori" type synchronization as<br>
described previously, to correct, for example, the<br>
offsets or misadjustments which can occur in the<br>
mechanical part 16 of the illumination system 10.<br>
According to a variant, the "a posteriori"<br>
synchronization means 11' according to the invention<br>
are sufficient in themselves to synchronize the video<br>
data 131 with the illumination color on the light valve<br>
12; in the absence of a priori synchronization, the use<br>
of an inexpensive and non-locked drive motor 161 then<br>
becomes possible, so simplifying the illumination<br>
system 10.<br>
With reference to figure 4, there now follows a<br>
description of the transverse cross section on one side<br>
of an LCDS type light valve 12 comprising, according to<br>
the preferred embodiment of the invention, at least one<br>
photosensitive sensor 121 level with each row of pixels<br>
120 according to the invention. On a silicon substrate<br>
100 on which are marked the logic control circuits of<br>
the component, there is deposited a layer of aluminum<br>
101 and dielectric layers 102 for maximizing the<br>
reflectivity and insulating the circuits from incident<br>
radiation. Above, between two alignment layers 103, a<br>
space is provided of even thickness into which is<br>
inserted the liquid crystal 104, sealed above the<br>
second alignment layer 103 by a transparent plate 106,<br>
normally of glass, on which are disposed, on its face<br>
turned towards the substrate 100, fine transparent<br>
metal tracks 105 of indium tin oxide (ITO). Finally,<br>
around the periphery of the component, a seal 122 seals<br>
the substrate 100 and the transparent plate 106 to<br>
ensure a good seal tightness. According to the<br>
invention, the at least one photosensitive sensor 121<br>
level with each row of pixels 120 is incorporated in<br>
the substrate 100 of the light valve by reserving on<br>
the substrate 100 a silicon area 110 without the<br>
metallization layer 101 and the other processes<br>
specific to the light valve that have been described<br>
briefly above. According to a variant, the set of<br>
silicon areas 110 reserved on the substrate form a<br>
band, vertical for example, within which are<br>
incorporated the photosensitive sensors 121 correctly<br>
aligned with the useful rows of pixels 120 of the light<br>
valve 12.<br>
The substrate 100 of the light valve in this case, of<br>
LCOS type, is made of silicon, but the invention more<br>
generally concerns the incorporation of the set of<br>
photosensitive sensors 121 in substrates forming an<br>
active matrix. The invention is applied equally to DMD<br>
type light valves. Figure 4 also describes a<br>
photosensitive sensor 121, for example of broad<br>
spectrum type made of silicon, level with each row of<br>
pixels 120. This type of sensor is used to detect a<br>
strong signal, the junction being formed by P 107 in<br>
N 108 chambers or vice versa. The sensor located at the<br>
periphery of the pixel array 120 should be lit by rays<br>
from the light beam that present the same<br>
characteristics as the useful beam lighting the active<br>
area of the LCOS 12, in other words, the pixel array<br>
120. This light beam passes through the sheet of glass<br>
106 covering the light valve, that is LCOS 12, the<br>
liquid crystal 104 and any transparent layers, for<br>
example the layers 102, improving the reflectivity.<br>
An embodiment wherein a transistor is associated with<br>
the photosensitive sensor(s) constitutes an active<br>
device with "memory" for saving, for example, the<br>
information on the perceived illumination color and<br>
sending a signal to the signal processing device 151 in<br>
the video data generator 15 only when the illumination<br>
changes.<br>
According to a variant, each photosensitive sensor 121<br>
has associated with it a colored filter 109, for<br>
example red or green or blue. The simple configuration<br>
according to which a single photosensitive sensor 121,<br>
associated with a colored filter 109, is incorporated<br>
level with each row of pixels 120 of the light valve 12<br>
provides for precise identification of a color, that of<br>
the colored filter 109 for example, and/or measurement<br>
of the light intensity of the light band. The precise<br>
identification, in real time, of a single illumination<br>
color is sufficient, in the case where the scrolling<br>
speed and the illumination area of each of the<br>
different color light bands are known or fixed, to<br>
determine, in the video data generator, the<br>
illumination color level with each row of pixels 120 of<br>
the light valve 12.<br>
With reference to figure 5, a variant of the invention<br>
is presented which consists in incorporating in the<br>
substrate 100 three photosensitive sensors 121 level<br>
with each row of pixels 120, each of the sensors being<br>
associated with a colored filter 109 of different<br>
color, for example red, green and blue. In this<br>
configuration, the temporal variation and the level of<br>
each of the three signals, red, green and blue, are<br>
used in the video data generator to synchronize and<br>
adjust the video data for the three colors. A<br>
particular case of application for maximizing the use<br>
of the light stream for non-saturated images consists<br>
in replacing one or more of the three illumination<br>
colors R, G, B with a secondary color, yellow, magenta<br>
or cyan for example, or by a combination of primary and<br>
secondary colors. The video data generator, using the<br>
signal from the photosensitive sensors, best defines<br>
the writing of the pixels to correctly restore the<br>
original colors of the image.<br>
The set of the colored filters of the same color<br>
associated with the photosensitive sensors forms,<br>
according to a variant of the invention, a colored<br>
band, for example vertical. These colored filters or<br>
bands associated with the photosensitive sensors are,<br>
with reference to figure 4, arranged in contact on the<br>
sensors (filter 109 in figure 4) or, according to a<br>
variant of the invention, inscribed on or in the<br>
transparent plate 106, facing the sensors with which<br>
they are associated (filter 109' in figure 4).<br>
According to a variant of the embodiments described<br>
previously, the or each photosensitive sensor 121 is<br>
incorporated in the substrate of the light valve, on<br>
either side1 of each row of the pixel array of the light<br>
valve 12, in order to have a more reliable and<br>
symmetrical measurement of the received illumination.<br>
Finally, without departing from the invention, any<br>
other type of photosensitive sensor can be used.<br>
The invention applies also to the cases where the light<br>
valve is provided with only a single photosensitive<br>
sensor which is used, as described previously, for<br>
indirect identification of the illumination color of<br>
each row of pixels of the light valve.<br>
The invention applies also to the intermediate cases in<br>
which the light valve is provided with a plurality of<br>
photosensitive sensors, but fewer than the number of<br>
rows of pixels, each associated with a row of pixels of<br>
the light valve, which are used not only for the direct<br>
identification of the illumination color of the rows of<br>
pixels with which they are associated, but also for the<br>
indirect identification of the illumination color of<br>
the other rows of pixels.<br><br><br><br>
