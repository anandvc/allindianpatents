However, such particular form is only an exemplary embodiment without intending to imply any limitation on the scope of this invention. Accordingly, the description is to be understood as an exemplary embodiment and reading of the invention is not intended to be taken restrictively.<br>

It is another object of the invention to invent a cost saving and value added product namely booster unit wherein the booster is used to take on the load from the alternator as well as to feed the fractional HP motor as a self sustaining operation.<br>
Further objects of the invention will be explained in the following description.<br>
Now the invention will be described with reference to the drawings. The nature of the invention and the manner in which the invention is to be performed and is clearly explained in the following pages of the description. The best mode of enablement is also explained in the following description.<br>
A fractional HP motor is connected through a set of gear trains for running a 5 KVA alternator. The present invention relates to a system wherein a fractional HP motor (1/6) of 6000 RPM is connected through a set of gear trains to boost the torque and reduce the speed to 1500 RPM so as to couple with a 5 KVA alternator. The reduction in speed from 6000 RPM to 1500 RPM is not directly achieved by 4:1 ratio but rather follows the following gear reductions:<br><br><br>
The fractional HP motor is initially supplied from a battery, inverter combination with a booster protection arrangement. The 5 KVA alternator output is not directly connected to the load since it will adversely affect the fractional HP motor, gear train arrangement. The 5 KVA alternator output is not directly connected to the load since it will adversely affect the fractional HP motor, gear train arrangement. The output booster connected to the 5 KVA alternator supplies the load. This booster also supplies about 200 watts to the fractional HP motor so that the entire system becomes a self-sustaining one. The battery and the inventor arrangement gets cutoff once the output booster starts supplying the fractional HP motor. This invention has a unique distinction of a small primeover (fractional HP motor) connected to a large machine (5KVA alternator) and the output booster arrangement enables the system to be a self sustaining one as well as avoids a direct impact of the load onto the alternator.<br>
One kind of booster between the inverter and the fractional HP motor is to ensure adequate power supply to the motor and to protect any short circuit in the inverter.<br>
The output booster after 5 KVA has a three fold operations to effect.<br>
1.	Firstly to supply the loads connected to the 5 KVA alternator.<br>
2.	Thereafter to protect against the load being transferred on to the 5 KVA<br>
alternator and is prime over viz the fractional HP motor. Since the transfer<br><br>
of such direct load will immediately burn the fractional HP motor and the gear train systems. 3. Further thereafter to take a part of the output of the alternator to supply back to the fractional HP motor so that the entire system is self-sustaining and the motor so far fed from the battery and the inverter system can be cutoff and become independent. This will also safeguard against the continuous usage of the battery.<br>
The salient features of the entire invention is<br>
1.	Use of the gear trains to boost the torque and reduce the speed to enable a much smaller prime over to operate a higher capacity machine.<br>
2.	The design of the output booster is to ensure separation of the load from the alternator as well as to provide a feed back power to operate the prime over motor.<br>
3.	The electrical/electronic system ensures a pollution and noise free environment.<br>
4.	The elimination of the diesel engine from such commercial operations will result in saving of the fossil fuels.<br>
5.	In this method, after taking into account of 12% self-induction current, 88% of output load becomes available for use. For instance, in 1500 RPM 5KVA 440V AC alternator, 4400 watts become available for use.<br>
Figure 1 of the drawings shows the system according to the invention.<br>
The details of the electronic inverter and the connected transformer is shown in figure 2.<br>
Figure 3 - Input Booster 500 W<br>
Figure 4 - Output Booster 5000 W<br><br>
Obvious equivalents known to persons skilled in the art are included in the scope of the above description and appended claims.<br>
The Input Booster is provided with a 10 Primary coil connected with the inverted AC power of 230V supply of 200 W, The secondary coil of the Booster is the single coil which boosts up the power in the ratio of 1: 2,5, thereby generates 500W output power. This output boosted power is fed to the gear wheels to generate high torque.<br>
Understanding the relationship between torque, power and engine speed is vital in automotive engineering, concerned as it is with transmitting power from the engine through the drive train to the wheels. Typically power is a function of torque and engine speed. The gearing of the drive train must be chosen appropriately to make the most of the motor's torque characteristics. Steam engines and electric motors tend to produce maximum torque close to zero rpm, with the torque diminishing as rotational speed rises (due to increasing friction and other constraints).<br>
Thereby with the decrease in spped close to zero rpm here say 1.2 rpm, generates high torque, which in turn been utilised to generate power of 7.5hp.<br>
The output booster also has 10 primary coll and a single secondary coil, the primary coil is of 8 Q , Since the primary coil are been earthed by the diode the impedance loss in the coil is negligible and thereby takes the low input current and increases the output current by 8% thereby generates a output power of 5600 W.<br>
The diagram enclosed herewith gives the typical lay out of the input and output booster arrangement. One such booster arrangement is already disclosed in US4398100,<br><br>
The invention hereinabove is described only with a view of understanding the invention elaborately which is not to be construed to limit the invention. While the invention has been described with particularity, it will be appreciated by those skilled person in the art that the modifications may be made thereto. For example, in the gears to reduce and increase speed, the set of gears to suit the requirement of torque may be varied. Therefore, it is to be understood that the present invention is not limited to the sole embodiment described herein but encompasses any and all embodiments within the scope of the invention and claims.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to the specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification s of the present invention which come within the scope of the following claims are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
