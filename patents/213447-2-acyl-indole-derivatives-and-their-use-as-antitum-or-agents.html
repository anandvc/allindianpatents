The compounds according to the invention of the formula I can be prepared by processes known per se, for example by the following processes:<br>
a) Lithiation of the indole derivatives and conversion into the corresponding methanones:<br><br><br>

The compounds of	the above formula I in which Rl is<br>
hydrogen  or  a	phenylsulfonyl  radical  are  useful<br>
intermediates for	preparing the other compounds of the<br>
formula I.<br>
The compounds used as starting materials, some of which are commercially available or known from the literature, are obtained by processes known from the literature; furthermore, their preparation is described in the examples. The processes known from the literature are described, for example, in L. and M. Fieser, Organlsche Chemie [Organic Chemistry], 2nd edition, 1979, pages 1417 to 1483 and in the literature cited therein on pages 1481-1483, in Houben-Weyl-Muller, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry] and in Ullmanns Encyklopadie der technlschen   Chemie   [Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Technical<br><br>
- 20 -Chemistry].<br>
Furthermore, the resulting compounds of the formula I can be separated into their enantiomers and/or diastereomers. Thus, for example, the resulting compounds of the formula I which occur as racemates can be separated into their optical antipodes by methods known per se, and compounds of the formula I having at least two asymmetrically substituted carbon atoms can be separated owing to their physico-chemical differences by methods known per se, for example by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization, into their diastereomers which, if obtained in racemic form, can then be separated into the enantiomers as mentioned above.<br>
Separation of enantiomers is preferably carried out by column chromatography on chiral phases or by recrystallization from an optically active solvent or by reaction with an optically active substance which forms salts or derivatives, such as, for example, esters or amides, with the racemic compound.<br>
Furthermore, the resulting compounds of the formula I can be converted into their salts with inorganic or organic acids, in particular, for pharmaceutical use, into their pharmacologically and physiologically acceptable salts. Acids which are suitable for this purpose are, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, fumaric acid, succinic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid or maleic acid.<br>
Moreover, if they contain an acidic group, such as a carboxyl group, the compounds of the formula I can, if desired, be converted into their salts with inorganic or organic bases, in particular, for pharmaceutical use, into their physiologically acceptable salts. Bases which are suitable for this purpose are, for example.<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, cyclohexylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine.<br>
As mentioned at the outset, the novel compounds of the formula I and their salts have useful properties. Thus, the compounds of the formula I according to the invention have, for example, useful pharmacological properties. In particular, the compounds of the formula I can be used as antitumor agents and for the chemotherapy of tumor patients. The compounds of the formula I inhibit cell division (anti-mitosis action) and thus tumor growth. In addition, the compounds according to the invention can inhibit tubulin polymerization indirectly or directly. Inhibition of cell division may be effected by stopping the cell cycle of the tumor cells, resulting in the death of the cells (apoptosis) . The compounds of the formula I are * furthermore suitable for preventing or reducing formation and proliferation of metastases in the body. Moreover, they have anti-angiogenic potential and may therefore be suitable for use as antitumor agents, by inhibiting tumor vascularization.<br>

General   procedures    for   preparing   the   lH-2-indolylphenyl-1-methanones according to the invention<br>
Method A: The appropriate N-protected methanone derivative {starting component) (1.8 mmol) is, in a mixture of 10% sodium hydroxide (20 ml) and ethanol (40 ml), heated at reflux for 2 to 15 hours (TLC) . The solution is cooled to room temperature and then poured into 100 ml of water and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate and the solvent is removed. The crude product is recrystallized from ethyl acetate.<br>
Method B: A mixture of the appropriate N-protected methanone derivative (starting component) (1.8 mmol) and 0.79 g (2.5 mmol) of tetrabutylammonium fluoride trihydrate in 20 ml of THF/methanol 1:1 is heated at reflux. After the reaction has ended (30 min - 4 hours, TLC), the mixture is cooled and poured into 100 ml of water. The mixture is extracted with ethyl acetate and the organic phase is dried over sodium sulfate. The solvent is concentrated slowly until the product begins to crystallize out.<br>

- 57 -Results of the pharmacological tests<br>
The in vitro test in selected tumor models revealed the pharmacological activities shown below.<br>
Example 1: Antitumor action<br>
The substances D-64131  (Ex. 101), D-68143  (Ex. 102),<br>
D-68144  (Ex.  103),  D-68150  (Ex.  116)  and  D-68172<br>
(Ex. 105) were tested for antiproliferative activity in a proliferation test on established tumor cell lines. In the test used, the cellular dehydrogenase activity is determined as a measure of cell vitality and, indirectly, cell numbers. The cell lines used were the human glioma cell lines A-172  (ATCC CRL-1620),  U118<br>
(ATCC HTB-15) and U373 (ATCC HTB-17), the rat glioma cell line C6 (ATCC CCL107) and the human cervical carcinoma cell line KB/HeLa (ATCC CCL17) . These were very well characterized established cell lines which were obtained from ATCC and cultured.<br>
The results summarized in Tab. 1 and Fig. 1 show a highly potent antitumor action of the substances mentioned. It has to be emphasized that the action is concentration-dependent, resulting in comparable maximum inhibitions. It was possible to determine defined activities: D-68144 &gt; D-68150 &gt; D-64131 + D-68143 &gt; D-68172 (increasing antitumor potency from D-68172 to D-68144) . This order in the activity was observed in all cell lines examined and is to be judged as an indication for a defined molecular mechanism of action.<br>

The chosen method allowed the detection of a cell-cycle-specific action of the substance. To this end, the proportion of cells in phases Gl,  S,  G2  and M of the cell cycle was<br><br>
- 59 -<br>
determined by measuring the DNA content. The result of this analysis is summarized in Fig. 2. What is shown is the proportion of cells in the metaphase of mitotic division (M-phase of the cell cycle; 2N chromosomes). For all of the substances tested, a concentration-dependent arrest of the cells in mitosis, which correlates with the antiproliferative action shown in Table 1 and Fig, 1, is clearly detectable. Thus, the substances arrest growth by inhibiting cell division, which subequently results in the death of the tumor cells (apoptosis) .<br>

Chem.  Vol.  33,  pp.  71-77  describes  combretastatin analogs which have antitumor action in a proliferation assay  with  the  tumor  cell  lines  P388  {leukemia, murine), A549 (pulmonary carcinoma, human), HT29 (colon carcinoma, human) and Mel28 {melanoma, human). The test system used is comparable to the test system described above. The tumor cells mentioned are treated with the substances for 72 h, and the cell count is determined directly (P388) or indirectly via staining with Crystal Violet  (Mel28,  A549,  HT29) .  In this test,  the known compound   l-methyl-2-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)carbonyl-methylindole (compound 4d) shows an inhibitory activity of IC50 = 0.3 to 0.6 (?M and the known compound l~methyl-3-{3-hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl)carbonylmethylindole (compound 1d) shows an inhibitory activity of IC50 = 3.6 to 8.9 ?M.    In contrast, the compound D-68144 according to  the • invention  shows  an  inhibitory  activity  in various glioma  lines  of  IC50 = 0.005 to  0.015 ?M. Surprisingly,  the compound D-6814 4  according to the invention is, by a factor of 40-60, more active than the compound 4d described in the publication of Medarde et al.<br>

XTT test for cellular dehydrogenase activity<br>
The adherently growing tumor cell lines C6, A-172, U118, U373 and HeLa/KB were cultivated under standard conditions in an incubator with gas inlet at 370C, 5% CO2 and 95% atmospheric humidity. On Test Day 1, the cells are detached using trypsine/EDTA and pelleted by centrifugation. The cell pellet is then resuspended in the respective culture medium at the appropriate cell count and transferred to a 96-well microtiter plate. The plates are then cultivated overnight in the incubator with gas inlet. The test substances are made up as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO and, on Test Day 2, diluted   with   culture   medium   to   the   desired<br><br>
- 61 -<br>
concentrations.  The substances in the culture medium are  then added to  the  cells  and incubated  in the incubator with gas inlet for 45 h. Cells which have not been treated with test substance serve as control. For the  XTT  assay,   1  mg/ml  of  XTT  (sodium  3' - [1-(phenylaminocarbonyl)-3,4-tetrazolium]-bis(4-methoxy-6-nitro)benzenesulfonic acid)  is dissolved in RPMI-164 0 medium without Phenol Red. Additionally, a 0.383 mg/ml solution   of   PMS   (N-methyldibenzopyrazine   methyl sulfate)   in  phosphate-buffered   saline   (PBS)   is prepared.  On Test Day 4,  75 ?l/well  of the XTT-PMS mixture are pipetted onto the cell plates, which by now have been incubated with the test substances for 45 h. To this end, _ the XTT solution is mixed with the PMS solution in a ratio of 50:1 (v/v) shortly before use. The cell plates are then incubated in the incubator with gas inlet for a further 3 h,  and the optical density (OD490nm) is determined in a photometer.<br>
Using the OD490nm obtained, the inhibition in percent relative to the control is calculated and plotted semilogarithmically in the form of a concentration-activity curve. The IC50 is calculated from the concentration-activity curve by regression analysis using the program Graphpad.<br>
Cell cycle analysis by FACS<br>
U373 glioma cells in adherent subconfluent culture are treated with substance for 24 h and then detached and washed 1x with PBS. A total of 5x106 cells/data point are fixed in 1 ml of 80% methanol (-20°C), kept on ice for 30 min and stored at 40C. For FACS analysis, the cells are incubated in PBS with 0.1% of saponin, 20 (?g/ml of propidium iodide and 1 mg/ml of RNAse A at 370C for 30 min. The cells are washed in PBS/saponin buffer and then analyzed in a Calibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson).<br><br>

Example 3: Tubulin-inhibitory and cytotoxic activity of selected compounds<br>
Selected compounds were tested in an in vitro test for inhibition of polymerization of bovine brain. In this test, tubulin purified by polymerization and depolymerization cycles was used and polymerized by addition of GTP and heating. The IC50 values of the inhibition of the polymerization of tubulin are stated in table 1. The known tubulin inhibitors vincristine and colchicine are included as reference substances. Highly potent inhibitors which are to be mentioned are, for example, D-70316 and D-81187 with IC50 values of 0.81 and 0.39 pM.<br>
Table 1 furthermore states the cytotoxic or growth-inhibiting activities of the compounds which were tested using the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa/KB. Here, some of the compounds are found to be compounds with high cytotoxic activity. D-64131, D-68144, D-70316 and D-81187 may be mentioned by way of example.<br>

Example 4 Cell-cycle-specific  action  in  the  RK0p21 model<br>
The RK0p21 cell system (M. Schmidt et al. Oncogene 19 (20) :2423-9, 2000) was used as a model for examining the cell-cycle-specific action. RKO is a human colon carcinoma line in which the cell cycle inhibitor p21wafl is expressed, induced by the Ecdyson expression system, leading to a cell cycle arrest specifically in Gl and G2. An unspecifically acting substance inhibits proliferation independently of whether the RKO cell is arrested in Gl or G2 or not. In contrast, cell-cycle-specific substances, such as, for example, tubulin inhibitors, are only cytotoxic if the cells are not arrested and the cell cycle is progressing. Table 2 shows the cytotoxic and growth-inhibiting activity of selected compounds with/without expression of p21wafl. When p21wafl was induced, all compounds tested showed low cytotoxic activity, if any at all. This underlines the fact, already determined in the FACS analyses, that the cell cycle is arrested in G2/M and that the action of the compounds examined is cell-cycle-specific.<br>

Example 5 Activity of D-64131 in human tumor xenograft experiments in nude mice<br>
Subcutaneously transplanted tumor fragments of the human melanoma MEXF 98 9 or the rhabdomyosarcoma SXF 4 63 were used for the in vivo experiments on nude mice. D-64131 was administered orally in doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg (vehicle 10% DMSO in PBS/Tween 80 0.05%) for 2 weeks (5 applications per week; Monday to Friday). In experiments with the two tumors, D-64131 was found to be highly active. In the MEXF989 model, it was possible to obtain a growth inhibition of 81% (200 mg/kg/day) or 66% (100 mg/kg/day) . In the SXF463 model, the higher dose of 200 mg/kg was found to effect 83% growth inhibition relative to the control. These results show, in addition to oral bioavailability and very good tolerance, potent antitumor activity in two human tumor xenograft models.<br>
Description of the methods used.<br>
Bovine tubulin polymerization assay<br>
The tubulin used for the assay was isolated from bovine brain by polymerization and depolymerization cycles. 85 ?l of a mix comprising 80 ?? of PEM buffer pH 6.6 (O.IM pipes, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgSO4 p.H 6.6) and 5 pi of 20 mM GTP stock solution were initially charged per well into the MultiScreen-type filter plate (0.22 pM hydrophilic, low protein binding-Durapore Membrane, from Millipore). The appropriate amount of test substance, dissolved in 100% DMSO, is added using a pipette. This is followed by addition of 10 pi of purified bovine tubulin (50-60 pg of tubulin per well). At room temperature, the filter plate is shaken at 400 rpm for 20 min, and 50 ?l/well of stain solution (45% MeOH, 10% acetic acid, 0.1% Naphthol Blue Black/Sigma) are then added using a pipette. After an incubation time of 2 minutes,  the stain solution is<br><br>
- 69 -<br>
aspirated (Eppendorf Event 4160), and the well is then washed twice using a 90% methanol/2% acetic acid solution. 200 ?l/well of decolorization solution (2,5 mM NaOH, 50% ethanol, 0.05 mM EDTA) are then added using a pipette. Following a 20 minute incubation at room temperature on a shaker (400 rpm), the samples are measured in a photometer at an absorption of 600 nM. What is calculated is the inhibition in percent, based on the 100% value of a positive control (without test substance), or, if a concentration activity curve is drawn, the IC50 value.<br>
XTT test for cellular dehydrogenase activity<br>
In addition to the tumor cell line HeLa/KB (see table 1), it is possible to use the cell lines C6, A-172, U118, U373, SK0V3 (ATCC HTB 77, human ovarian  adenocarcinoma), SF268 (NCI 503138, human glioma), NCI4 60 (NCI 503473; human non-small-cell lung carcinoma), MCF-7 (ATCC HTB22; human mamma adenocarcinoma) and RKO (human colon adenocarcinoma) for the proliferation experiments.<br>
Cell cycle analysis using the RK0p21 model The assay is carried out in 96-well plates. Using inducible expression of p21wafl, the growth of the cells is completely arrested, but the cells do not die. By comparing the effect on induced and non-induced cells, it is possible to draw conclusions with respect to the mechanism of action (cell cycle specificity) of the therapeutics. Non-induced cells are sown at a cell count which is about four times higher, since, in contrast to non-induced cells, there is no further division during the assay (2 x 104 cells/well induced, about 0.6 X 104 cells/well non-induced). The controls are untreated cells (+/- induction). Induction is carried out using 3 ?M of muristerone A. On day 1, the cells are plated ( + /- muristerone A) and incubated at 370C for 24 h. On day 2, the test substance is added<br><br>

{control DMSO) and incubation is continued at 37 °C for a further 4 8 h, which is then followed by a standard XTT assay.<br>
Oral bioavailability of D-64131:<br>
Initially,  D-64131  was  examined  in  vitro  for  its antitumor activity using 12 permanent human tumor cell lines. The cell lines included intestinal (2) , gastric (1) , pulmonary (3) , breast (2) , melanoma (2) , ovarial (1) , kidney (1) and uterus (1) tumor cell lines. The average IC50 of D-64131 for all cell lines examined using a propidium-iodide-based cytot.oxicity assay was 0.34 ?M. Melanoma,  intestinal and kidney tumor cells were most sensitive  (IC50 = 4 nM) . The IC50 for the pulmonary and gastric tumor cell lines examined was about  4 ?M. Here,  D-64131  acted  as  a  cell-cycle-specific active compound via interaction with tubulin. D-64131  inhibited  the polymerization  of  calf brain tubulin with an IC50 of 2.2 pM. The maximum tolerated dose for intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection in. nude mice was 400 mg/kg for weekly administration.  For peroral (p.o.)  administration,  100 and 200 mg/kg of p-64131 were administered at a "Qdx5" dosage  (1x per day for 5 successive days) for 2 weeks. Both p.o. dosages were tolerated very well, and no indications of toxicity or loss  of  body  weight  were  found.  The  last  dosage protocol was used to test the activity of D-64131 in the  human  melanoma  xenograft  model  MEXF 98 9.  Oral treatment with D-64131 resulted in an 81% inhibition of growth, compared to the control, at 200 mg/kg/d and to 66%  inhibition  of  growth  at  100 mg/kg/d.  In  the rhabdomyosarcoma   xenograft   model   SXF 463,    the inhibition of growth at 200 mg/kg/d was found to be 83%.  The results  confirm that the indole compounds according  to  the  invention  are potent  cytotoxically active compounds acting in a cell-cycle-specific manner by interfering with the mitotic spindle apparatus. Also to be emphasized is the oral bioavailability of the<br><br>

Based on the activity and compatibility found for the orally bioavailable low-molecular-weight tubulin inhibitor D-64131, this compound is a candidate for further phases I and II clinical trials.<br>
