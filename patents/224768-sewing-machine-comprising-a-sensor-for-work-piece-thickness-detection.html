				<td>Sewing Machine Comprising a Sensor for Work-Piece-Thickness<br>
Detection<br>
The invention relates to a sewing machine comprising a sensor for work-<br>
piece-thickness detection, comprising the following features: a base plate<br>
with a bearing plate for a work piece; a standard which is formed on the<br>
bearing plate, having an adjoining arm including a head; a stitch-forming<br>
place with a sewing needle; a feed arrangement for feeding the work piece<br>
in a feed direction; the sensor having a circuit for transmission, to an elec-<br>
tric control system, of a measured value that corresponds to the thickness<br>
of the work piece upstream of the stitch-forming place; the control system<br>
comprising a unit for transmission of alter commands in dependence on the<br>
detected thickness to at least one servo component and/or a driving motor<br>
on the sewing machine.<br>
A sewing machine of the generic type is known from DE 35 28 295 C2<br>
(corresponding to U.S. patent 4 686 917), in which the thickness of a work<br>
piece is sensed by a sensing lever that is disposed upstream of the point<br>
where the stitch is formed, seen in the direction of sewing, the angular po-<br>
sition of the sensing lever being converted by an electronic measuring ele-<br>
ment, into corresponding measured values. Depending on a measured<br>
value, alter commands are transmitted via an electronic control system to<br>
servo motors of the sewing machine, for instance for adjusting the lifting<br>
stroke of pressure feet of alternating operation.<br>
Drawbacks reside in that the sensing lever is located in the working area<br>
directly upstream of the pressure feet where the operator handles the work<br>
piece. Inserting the work piece in the stitch forming area of the sewing ma-<br>
chine must take place carefully for the work piece to be positioned under<br>
the sensing lever. When sewing, the operator must ensure unimpeded op-<br>
eration of the sensing lever. Moreover, the sensing lever interferes with<br>
work piece supply when arch-shaped seams are produced. Concluding it<br>
can be said that disturbing effects of the sensing lever on an operator's<br>
working area cannot be avoided.<br>
DE 37 17 601 Al teaches a work piece detector for a sewing machine, in<br>
which the position of a sensing lever that is located upstream of the stitch<br>
forming place of the sewing machine is kinematically coupled with a po-<br>
tentiometer. Measured values are emitted corresponding to the thickness of<br>
the scanned work piece. Although work-piece thickness is detectable in this<br>
way, the drawbacks of a sensing lever also apply in the case of this work<br>
piece detector.<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a sewing machine of the generic<br>
type with a sensor, ensuring an unimpeded mode of operation.<br>
According to the invention, this object is attained by the features which<br>
consist in that the sensor is an ultrasonic sensor which comprises a trans-<br>
mitter part and a receiver part; and in that the transmitter part and the re-<br>
ceiver part are disposed upstream of the stitch-forming place in the feed<br>
direction and above the bearing plate at a distance therefrom on the head of<br>
the sewing machine. The measures according to the invention ensure that<br>
the distance from the sewing-machine bearing plate and from a work piece<br>
placed thereon can be determined on the basis of an interval between emit-<br>
ted sound pulses and the receipt of an echo signal. This renders an opera-<br>
tor's working area free from any influences. The property of the ultrasonic<br>
sensor of timing the interval between transmission and echo-return instead<br>
of sensing sound intensity ensures that interfering environmental effects are<br>
nearly precluded, making a wide spectrum of materials detectable, such as<br>
leather or velvet, regardless of their color, transparency and other physical<br>
properties. Another advantage results from the fact that thickness meas-<br>
urement may take place even in dusty surroundings.<br>
The transmitter part and the receiver part being disposed in a casing helps<br>
put into practice a space-saving way of construction so that an operator's<br>
view of the working area is nearly unimpeded.<br>
The improvement, according to which the control system comprises a first<br>
memory for recording a value that represents the distance between the sen-<br>
sor and the bearing plate of the sewing machine, and a second memory for<br>
recording a second value that represents the thickness of the work piece,<br>
enables the distance by which the sensor is disposed above the bearing<br>
plate of the sewing machine to be detected automatically. This is accompa-<br>
nied with the advantage that the sensor can be mounted on the arm of the<br>
sewing machine, using components of dimensional variation. Mounting the<br>
sensor after the machine has been repaired is also possible, needing no spe-<br>
cial alignment job. Furthermore, this improvement enables the value that<br>
represents the distance between the sensor and bearing plate of the sewing<br>
machine to be updated permanently, precluding any effects of modified air<br>
properties (pressure, temperature, humidity) on the measured result.<br>
When the control system comprises a third memory for recording a third<br>
value that represents the total thickness of the first work piece plus a sec-<br>
ond work piece, this offers the possibility of processing thickenings<br>
- which means quite generally work pieces of varying thickness - by a cor-<br>
responding alter function being triggered.<br>
A special advantage is accomplished by the further development compris-<br>
ing the features which consist in that the control system comprises a fourth<br>
memory for recording a maximum thickness as a fourth value, and a com-<br>
parator circuit for determining the difference between the fourth value and<br>
the second value or the third value, and for preventing an alter command<br>
from being triggered when the difference is less than or equal to zero,<br>
which enables a person, for feed of a work piece, to operate in the working<br>
area of the sensor directly upstream of the stitch forming place. In this case,<br>
measured results are disregarded which the ultrasonic sensor passes to the<br>
control system upon detection of an operator's finger or hand and which<br>
exceed a given maximum thickness.<br>
Further advantages, features and details of the invention will become ap-<br>
parent from the ensuing description of an exemplary embodiment, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Fig. 1 is a view of the head of a sewing machine;<br>
Fig. 2 is an elevation of the sewing machine, on a reduced scale, in ac-<br>
cordance with the arrow II of Fig. 1; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a diagrammatic illustration of part of the sewing-machine control<br>
system.<br>
A sewing machine 1 comprises a base plate 2 with a standard 3 which ex-<br>
tends upwards therefrom and an elbowed arm 4 which ends in a head 5. An<br>
arm shaft 6 is run rotatably in the arm 4; on the side of the standard, it is<br>
joined to a handwheel 7. By way of a belt drive 8, the handwheel 7 is con-<br>
nected to a driving motor 9 which is fixed to the arm 4.<br>
Within the head 5, the free end of the arm shaft 6 is conventionally con-<br>
nected to a crank drive (not shown) for actuation of a needle bar 10, the<br>
end of which facing the base plate 2 being provided with a sewing needle<br>
11.<br>
A thread lever 12 is in driving connection with the crank drive, its free end<br>
13 projecting through a hole 14 in the head 5. By the side of the hole 14,<br>
provision is made on the head 5 for an electromagnetically actuated thread<br>
tightener 15. Eyelets 16, 17 are disposed on the arm 4. A thread 18 is sup-<br>
plied from a bobbin (not shown) to the sewing machine 1, this thread 18<br>
being led through the eyelet 16 to the thread tightener 15, from where it is<br>
led through an eyelet in the end 13 of the thread lever 12 and from there<br>
through the eyelet 17 and finally through the eye of the sewing needle 11.<br>
A needle plate 19 is mounted on the base plate 2, having a stitch hole 20<br>
for the needle 11 to pass through. A hook (not shown) is located under-<br>
neath the needle plate 19, working as a stitch forming element that cooper-<br>
ates with the sewing needle 11. The needle 11 and the stitch hole 20 consti-<br>
tute a stitch forming place 21. In the vicinity of the stitch hole 20, provision<br>
is made for a feeder 22 which passes through corresponding recesses in the<br>
needle plate 19.<br>
A first work piece 24 of a thickness dl is placed on the top side of the base<br>
plate 2 which is also called the bearing plate 23. As seen in Fig. 1, a second<br>
work piece 25 of a width b lies on top of the first work piece 24. The sec-<br>
ond work piece 25 can for example be a stripe or piping that is to be sewn<br>
on the first work piece 24 or generally any other type of work piece thick-<br>
ening. This work piece thickening of two work pieces 24, 25 placed on top<br>
of each other has a thickness d2.<br>
A pressure foot 26 supports itself on the work piece 24 while a second<br>
pressure foot 27 is in an elevated position as seen in Fig. 1. The pressure<br>
feet 26, 27 are components of a so-called pressure arrangement 28 of alter-<br>
nating operation which is in driving connection with the arm shaft 6. The<br>
pressure feet 26, 27 can be lifted alternately off the top side of the work<br>
piece 24 or 24 and 25 by a lift c, the lift c being modifiable by a servo<br>
component 29 during the run of the sewing machine 1. The pressure ar-<br>
rangement 28 is known from the document mentioned at the outset.<br>
The mentioned feeder 22 is part of a feed arrangement 30 which is in driv-<br>
ing connection with the arm shaft 6. In combination with the pressure ar-<br>
rangement 28, the feed arrangement 30 exercises a feed motion on the<br>
work piece 24 or the work pieces 24, 25 in a feed direction 31.<br>
A holding arm 33 is tightly mounted on a bottom surface 32 of the head 5,<br>
the free end of which extends counter to the feed direction 31 where it is<br>
provided with a sensor 34. The sensor 34 is an ultrasonic sensor, emitting<br>
sound waves in a frequency range of 0.1 to 1 megahertz and receiving cor-<br>
responding reflected waves. Ultrasonic sensors of this type are commercial<br>
in the market. A dashed line in Fig. 1 symbolically illustrates a beam path<br>
35 of these sound waves. Seen in the feed direction 31, the beam path 35 is<br>
located at a distance e upstream of the stitch forming place 21.<br>
According to Fig. 3, the sensor comprises a transmitter part 34a and a re-<br>
ceiver part 34b, both parts being triggered by an electronic circuit 36. Cor-<br>
respondingly, an emitted beam 35a is illustrated on the transmitter part 34a<br>
and a reflected beam 35b on the receiver part 34b.<br>
In the preferred embodiment seen in Figs. 1 and 2, the sensor 34 is config-<br>
ured in such a way that the transmitter part 34a, the receiver part 34b and<br>
the circuit 36 are accommodated in a single casing. In this case, the sensor<br>
body of sintered material is used as a receiver part as well as a transmitter<br>
part, alternately switching from one to the other in high-frequency se-<br>
quence. Sensors of this type excel by needing comparatively little space.<br>
Accordingly, Fig. 3 shows the sensor 34 with the beam path 35 roughly<br>
outlined by a dashed line with arrows at both ends.<br>
The circuit 36, the driving motor 9 (diagrammatically illustrated as a block<br>
9a in Fig. 3), the thread tightener 15 (diagrammatically illustrated as a<br>
block 15a in Fig. 3), and the servo component 29 (diagrammatically illus-<br>
trated as a block 29a in Fig. 3) are electrically connected to an input-output<br>
unit 37 which is part of an electronic control system 38. The input-output<br>
unit 37 is connected to a microprocessor 39 which comprises a computer<br>
part 40 having a computer circuit 41, a comparator circuit 42 and a mem-<br>
ory area 43 with a first memory 44, a second memory 45, a third memory<br>
46 and a fourth memory 47. The control system 38 is electrically connected<br>
to an operating panel 48 which is equipped with a display unit 49 and a<br>
keyboard 50.<br>
The mode of operation of the sewing machine 1 is as follows:<br>
It is assumed that, with the current turned on and compressed air provided<br>
for any possible pneumatic servo components, the sewing machine 1 is<br>
ready for operation, in which condition the bearing plate 23 is free, without<br>
any work piece placed thereon for sewing. Correspondingly, the emitted<br>
beam path 35 of the sensor 34 acts on the bearing plate 23. This is effected<br>
by the sensor 34 being triggered, whereby a pre-determined number of<br>
sound waves is emitted by the transmitter part 34a and the sound waves<br>
reflected by the bearing plate 23 are then received as an echo by the re-<br>
ceiver part 34b. During this process, the time interval between the begin-<br>
ning of sound wave emission and echo receipt is measured. The interval is<br>
a value that is proportional to the distance a of the sensor 34 from the bear-<br>
ing plate 23, the distance a thus being measured and then recorded in the<br>
first memory 44. This described process is steadily repeated.<br>
Upon insertion of the work piece 24, the difference in distance, a - dl, is<br>
measured in the same way, from which the computer circuit 41, in combi-<br>
nation with the distance a determined before, can calculate the thickness dl<br>
which is then recorded in the second memory 45. Upon determination of<br>
the thickness dl of the work piece 24, the control system 38 causes regula-<br>
tion variables of the motor 9 and the servo components 15 and 29 to be set<br>
so that the sewing machine is automatically adjusted for sewing the work<br>
piece 24. Depending on the respective thickness of the work piece, pre-<br>
selected adjustment data are activated which are allocated to the respective<br>
thickness; these data are contained in a table that is stored in the memory<br>
area 43.<br>
As the work piece 24 advances during sewing, an approaching edge 51 will<br>
arrive in the working range of the sensor 34 which determines the thickness<br>
d2 in the manner specified and records it in the third memory 46. Being<br>
aware of the constructionally given distance e of the sensor 34 from the<br>
stitch forming place 21, the control system 38 takes into account that a de-<br>
fined number of stitches must still be sewn with the motor 9 and servo<br>
components 15 and 29 adjusted as before. Once this number of stitches has<br>
been worked, the control system 38 causes the motor 9 and servo compo-<br>
nents 15 and 29 to be adjusted anew, this renewed adjustment correspond-<br>
ing to the sewing conditions that allow for the thickness d2 of the work<br>
pieces 24 and 25.<br>
As the sewing process proceeds, a tail edge 52 of the work piece 25 arrives<br>
in the working range of the sensor 34, which again causes the motor 9 and<br>
the servo components 15 and 29 to be adjusted correspondingly as upon<br>
detection of the approaching edge 51.<br>
Upon operation of the sewing machine 1, the computer part 40, together<br>
with the comparator circuit 42, permanently compares the determined dis-<br>
tances d 1 and d2 to a distance D which is a maximum recorded in the<br>
fourth memory 47. Fig. 1 illustrates the maximum by a dot-dashed line 53.<br>
This proceeding ensures that measured results, which are sensed when an<br>
operator handles the work piece in the working range of the sensor 34, will<br>
be ignored ultimately so that these measured results prevent an alter func-<br>
tion of the servo components 9, 15, 29 from being triggered when the dif-<br>
ference between the determined work piece thickness dl or d2 is less than<br>
or equal to zero.<br>
