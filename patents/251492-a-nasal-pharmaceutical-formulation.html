				<td>NASAL PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATIONS<br>
AM) METHODS OF USING THE SAME<br>
I. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to nasal pharmaceutical formulations comprising a drug<br>
substance having a specific particle size distribution profile. Such profile provides increased<br>
bioavailability, increased efficacy or prolonged therapeutic effect of the drug substance when<br>
administered intranasally. In an alternative embodiment, formulations of the present invention<br>
comprise a beclomethasone or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof having a specific<br>
particle size distribution profile. The formulation may be provided as an aqueous suspension<br>
suitable for intranasal administration to a subject in need thereof.<br>
II. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is known that the particle size of a drug substance affects bioavailability of the drug and<br>
efficacy. Methods of making finely divided drugs have been studied and efforts have been made<br>
to control the size and size range of drug particles in pharmaceutical compositions. However, the<br>
prior art does not disclose drug substances having specific particle size distribution profiles<br>
which provide increased bioavailability, increased efficacy or prolonged therapeutic effect of the<br>
drug when administered intranasally.<br>
It is known that inhaled corticosteroids are one of the most effective anti-inflammatory<br>
medications used in the treatment of respiratory disorders or diseases characterized by<br>
inflammation. One such corticosteroid, beclomefhasone dipropionate (BDP), is particularly<br>
useful in the treatment or prophylaxis of seasonal or perennial rhinitis and is also indicated for<br>
the relief of one or more symptoms associated with seasonal or perennial allergic and non-<br><br>
allergic (vasomotor) is a reaction that occurs in the eyes, nose and throat when<br>
airborne irritants, for example, trigger the release of histamine. Histamine causes inflammation<br>
and fluid production in the fragile linings of nasal passages, sinuses and eyelids. Use of<br>
corticosteroids such as beclomethasone can cause partial or whole relief from rhinitis-related<br>
symptoms such as sneezing, congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, throat eyes and ears. Use of<br>
beclomethasone can also delay the recurrence of nasal polyps in individuals who have undergone<br>
nasal polyopectomy. In those polyps that do recur, beclomethasone can suppress the polyp's<br>
growth increase in size.<br>
Like most corticosteroids and other drug substances, BDP is very slightly soluble in<br>
water. When such drug substances are administered intranasally, they are typically suspended in<br>
an aqueous solution. However, when these substances are administered intranasally via a<br>
conventional nasal spray, less than optimal amounts of drug substance is absorbed by the nasal<br>
mucosa (the target tissue), with the remainder being swallowed or expelled from the nasal cavity.<br>
In some instances, particles which are not sufficiently small are eliminated from the<br>
gastrointestinal tract before being disposed onto the target area. The inability to administer<br>
optimal amounts of a drug substance results in reduced bioavailability and efficacy of that drug<br>
 substance.<br>
;	III. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a nasal pharmaceutical formulation comprising a drug<br>
substance having a specific particle size distribution profile which provides increased<br>
bioavailability, increased efficacy or prolonged therapeutic effect of the drug substance when<br><br>
administered intranasally. Specifically, in one alternative embodiment, the formulation of the<br>
present invention comprises a drug substance (e.g., active ingredient) having the following<br>
particle size distribution profile: about 10% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of<br>
about 0.75 microns; about than 25% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less<br>
than 1.5 microns; about 50% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 2.0<br>
microns; about 75% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 3.5 microns;<br>
about 90% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 5.0 microns; and,<br>
greater than 90% or about 100% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than<br>
10 microns. In one alternative embodiment, the drug substance is a corticoid steroid, preferably<br>
beclomethasone or a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof.<br>

V.	DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The formulations provided herein are used for (rearing, preventing and/or ameliorating<br>
one or more symptoms of a medical condition, disorder or disease. As used herein, treatment<br>
means any manner in which one or more of the symptoms of the condition, disorder 01 disease<br>
are ameliorated or otherwise beneficially altered. Treatment also encompasses any<br>
pharmaceutical or medicinal use of the formulations herein. As used herein, amelioration of the<br>
symptoms of a particular disorder by administration of a particular formulation refers to any<br>
lessening, whether permanent or temporary, lasting or transient that can be attributed to or<br>
associated with administration of the formulation. As used herein, a "therapeutic effective<br>
amount" means a sufficient amount of drug substance to treat, prevent and/or ameliorate one or<br>
more symptoms of a medical condition, disorder or disease. It also may include a safe and<br>
tolerable amount of drug substance, as based on industry and/or regulatory standards.<br>
In one alternative embodiment, the formulations provided herein are used for treating,<br>
preventing and/or ameliorating one or more symptoms of a respiratory disorder in an individual.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a formulation for the<br>
treatment, prophylaxis and/or amelioration of one or more symptoms of rhinitis or other related<br>
disorders, wherein the formulation comprises one or more corticosteroids having a specific<br>
particle size distribution profile. In an alternative embodiment, the drug substance is<br>
beclomethasone or apharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. Preferably, the drug<br>
substance is beclomethasone dipropionate. Surprisingly, it has been found that a drug substance<br>
having the present particle size distribution profiles, when administered intranasally to a subject<br>
in need thereof, provides increased bioavailability of the drug substance, as well as increased and<br><br>
prolonged efficacy when compared to conventional formulations containing the same drug<br>
substance. Drug substances for use herein include any pharmaceutical compound having the<br>
present particle size distribution profile and capable of treating, preventing and/or amelioration<br>
one or more symptoms of a medical condition, disorder or disease when such substance, is<br>
administered intranasally to a subject in need thereof.<br>
Mode of Administration<br>
The present formulations may be packaged for administration in any conventional<br>
manner, preferably in a nasal applicator, and preferably in such a way as to deliver a fixed dose<br>
of drug substance (e.g., active ingredient). However, the present formulations may be<br>
administered via a nasal application in such a way as to deliver a non-fixed dose of drug<br>
substance. Spray Administration containers for various types of nasal formulations have been<br>
known in the past and substantially all will be equally suitable for the present formulations,<br>
considering of course that the materials from which the container is made is compatible with the<br>
formulations. The medium containing the drug substance and other appropriate ingredients may<br>
be contained in a small bottle or similar container, from which it can be dispersed as a mist to be<br>
directed into each nostril. Using ambient air as the propelling agent, one may have the bottle<br>
made of a flexible plastic, so that merely squeezing the bottle's sides impels the spray out<br>
through the nozzle into the nasal cavity. Air may also be the propelling agent for a pump sprayer,<br>
in which the user manipulates a small pump button which pumps air into the container and<br>
causes the liquid spray to be emitted on the return stroke. Alternatively, the bottle can be<br>
pressurized with a gas which is inert to the user and to the ingredients of the solution. The gas<br><br>
may be dissolved under pressure in the container or may be generated by dissolution or reaction<br>
of a solid material which forms the gas as a product of dissolution or as a reaction product.<br>
Typical gases which can be used include nitrogen, argon, and carbon dioxide. Also, when the<br>
formulation is administered as a spray or aerosol, the formulation maybe contained in a<br>
pressurized container with a liquid propellant including, but not limited to dicholorodifluoro<br>
methane or chlorotrifluoro ethylene, among other propellants.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, for administration as a spray, the present<br>
formulations may be placed in an appropriate atomizing device, e.g. in a pump-atomiser or the<br>
like. The atomizing device may be provided with appropriate means for delivery of aqueous<br>
spray to the naris. Preferably, it is provided with means ensuring delivery of a substantially fixed<br>
volume of composition/actuation (i.e. per spray-unit). In one embodiment, the device<br>
administers a metered dosage. The spray composition may be suspended or dissolved in a liquid<br>
propellant. Stabilizing and/or suspending agents and/or co-solvents may be present. In other<br>
embodiments herein, the formulation of the present invention is suitable for administration<br>
intranasally via a metered-dose spray pump to a subject in need thereof. In this respect, the<br>
formulation of the present invention may be pre-packaged in a metered-dose spray pump bottle,<br>
or metering atomizing pump.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the formulations of the present invention may be<br>
administered into the nose in the form of drops, or any other method which results in topical<br>
application to the nasal mucosa. The form of dosage for intranasal administration may include,<br>
solutions, suspensions or emulsions of the active compound in a liquid carrier in the form of nose<br><br>
drops. Suitable liquid carriers include water, propylene glycol and other pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable alcohols. For administration in drop form formulations may suitably be put in a<br>
container provided e.g. with a conventional dropper/closure device, e.g. comprising a pipette or<br>
the like, preferably delivering a substantially fixed volume of composition/drop. The dosage<br>
forms maybe sterilized, as required. The dosage forms may also contain adjuvants such as<br>
preservatives, stabilizers, emulsif ers or suspending agents, wetting agents, salts for varying the<br>
osmotic pressure or buffers, as required.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the present formulations may be administered in the<br>
form of a powder. For example, a powdery nasal composition can be directly used as a powder<br>
for a unit dosage form. If desired, the powder can be filled in capsules such as hard gelatine<br>
capsules. The contents of the capsule or single dose device maybe administered using e.g. an<br>
insufflator. Preferably, it is provided with means ensuring dosing of a substantially fixed amount<br>
of composition/actuation.<br>
Drag Substance<br>
The present invention is directed to formulations for the treatment, prophylaxis, or<br>
amelioration of one or more symptoms of a condition, disorder or disease. In alternative<br>
embodiment, the present invention is directed to formulations for the treatment, prophylaxis, or<br>
amelioration of one or more symptoms of rhinitis or any other respiratory disorder. For example,<br>
the formulations disclosed herein are useful for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis (e.g.,<br>
hay fever) or perennial allergic and nonallergic (vasomotor) rhinitis.<br><br>
Drug substances suitable for use in the present formulations include any pharmaceutical -<br>
acceptable compound company or any of its derivatives including, but not limited to, any salts,<br>
esters, enol esters, enol esters, acids, bases, solvates or hydrates thereof. Such derivatives may<br>
be prepared by those of skill in the art using known methods for such derivatization. Further, the<br>
drug substances for use in the formulations and methods provided herein include those<br>
compounds comprising chiral centers of either the (R) or (S) configuration, or a mixture thereof<br>
(e.g., racemate). Thus, the drug substances for use in the compositions provided herein include<br>
enantiomerically pure compounds, or stereoisomeric or diastereomeric mixtures thereof. It is to<br>
be understood that the chiral centers of the drug substances provided herein may undergo<br>
epimerization in vivo. Thus, one of skill in the art will recognize that administration of a drug<br>
substance in its (R) form is equivalent, for compounds that undergo epimerization in vivo, to<br>
administration of the compound in its (S) form.<br>
Drug substances suitable for use in the present formulations include, but are not limited<br>
to, corticosteroids, such as beclomethasone and any of its pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives. As used herein, pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives of a beclomethasone<br>
include any salts, esters, enol ethers, enol esters, acids, bases, solvates or hydrates thereof. Such<br>
derivatives may be prepared by those of skill in the art using known methods for such<br>
derivatization. Preferably, the formulations comprise beclomethasone dipropionate or its<br>
monohydrate. Beclomethasone dipropionate has the chemical name 9-chloro-l lb,17,21-<br>
trihydroxy-l6b-methylpregna-l,4-diene-3,20-doine17,21-dipropionate and the following<br><br><br>
The compound may be a white powder with a molecular weight of 521.25; and is very slightly<br>
soluble in water (Physicians' Desk Reference.RTM), very soluble in chloroform, and freely<br>
soluble in acetone and in alcohol.<br>
Particle Size Distribution Profile<br>
The formulations of the present invention may comprise a cocorticosteroid (e.g.,<br>
beclometasone diproprionate) having the following particle size distribution profile: about 10%<br>
or less of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 0.75 microns; about 25%<br>
or less of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 1.5 microns; about 50% or<br>
less of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 2.0 microns; about 75% or<br>
less of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 3.5 microns; about 90% or<br>
less of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 5.0 microns; and greater than<br>
90% or about 100% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of less than 10 microns.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been discovered that formulations containing a cocorticosteroid (e.g.,<br>
beclomethasone diproprionate) having a particle size distribution profile falling within the above<br>
ranges provide increased bioavailability over conventional formulations when administered via<br>
the intranasal route to a subject in need thereof, as well as increased and prolonged drug efficacy.<br><br>
As used herein, particle size refers to an average particle size as measured by<br>
conventional particle size measuring techniques well known to those skilled in the art, such as<br>
sedimentation field flow fractionation, photon correlation spectroscopy, or disk centrifugation,<br>
among other techniques.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the formulation of the present invention comprises a drug<br>
substance having the following particle size distribution profile: about 10% of the drug substance<br>

particle size of less than 1.25 microns; about 75% of the drug substance particles have a particle<br>
size of less than 2.0 microns; about 90% of the drug substance particles have a particle size of<br>
less than 3.0 microns; and greater than 90% or about 100% of the drug substance particles have a<br>
particle size of less than 6.5 microns. Preferably, the drug substance is beclomethasone<br>
dipropionate.<br>

about 0.01% to about 50%, or about 0.01% to about 25%, or about 0.01% to about 10%, or about<br>
0.01% to about 5% of one or more pharmacologically suitable suspending fluids which is<br><br>
physiologically acceptable upon administration intranasally. Pharmacologically suitable fluids<br>
for use herein include, but are not limited to, polar solvents, including, but not limited to,<br>
compounds that contain hydroxy! groups or other polar groups. Solvents include, but are not<br>
limited to, water or alcohols, such as ethanol, isopropanol, and glycols including propylene<br>
glycol, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, glycol ether, glycerol and polyoxyethylene<br>
alcohols. Polar solvents also include protic solvents, including, but not limited to, water,<br>
aqueous saline solutions with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable salt(s), alcohols, glycols<br>
or a mixture there of. In one alternative embodiment, the water for use in the present<br>
formulations should meet or exceed the applicable regulatory requirements for use in inhaled<br>
drugs.<br>
In certain embodiments herein, the formulations of the present invention have a pH of<br>
about 2.0 to about 9.0. Optionally, the formulations of the present invention may contain a pH<br>
buffer. For example, a buffer may comprise any known pharmacologically suitable buffers<br>
which are physiologically acceptable upon administration intranasally. The buffer may be added<br>
to maintain the pH of the formulation between about 3.0 and about 7.0, for example.<br>
Sterility or adequate antimicrobial preservation may be provided as part of the present<br>
formulations. Since certain formulations of the present invention are intended to be administered<br>
intranasally, it is preferred that they be free of pathogenic organisms. A benefit of a sterile liquid<br>
suspension is that it reduces the possibility of introducing contaminants into the individual when<br>
the suspension formulation is administered intranasally, thereby reducing the chance of an<br>
opportunistic infection. Processes which maybe considered for achieving sterility may include<br><br>
any appropriate sterilization steps known in the art. In one embodiment, the drug substance (e.g.,<br>
beclomethasone) is produced under sterile conditions, the micronization is performed in a sterile<br>
environment, and the mixing and packaging is conducted under sterile conditions. In alternative<br>
embodiment, the formulations of the present invention may be sterile filtered and filled in vials,<br>
including unit dose vials providing sterile unit dose formulations which are used in a nasal spray<br>
device for example. Each unit dose vial may be sterile and is suitably administered without<br>
contaminating other vials or the next dose. In one alternative embodiment, one or more<br>
ingredients in the present formulation may be sterilized by steam, gamma radiation or prepared<br>
using or mixing sterile steroidal powder and other sterile ingredients where appropriate. Also,<br>
the formulations maybe prepared and handled under sterile conditions, or may be sterilized<br>
before or after packaging.<br>
In addition to or in lieu of sterilization, the formulations of the present invention may<br>
contain a pharmaceutically acceptable preservative to rmnimize the possibility of microbial<br>
contamination. Additionally, a pharmaceutically-acceptable preservative may be used in the<br>
present formulations to increase the stability of the formulations. It should be noted, however,<br>
that any preservative must be chosen for inhalation safety, as the treated tissues may be sensitive<br>
to irritants. Preservatives suitable for use herein include, but are not limited to, those that protect<br>
the solution from contamination with pathogenic particles, including phenylethyl alcohol,<br>
benzaUconium chloride, benzoic acid, or benzoates such as sodium benzoate. Preferably, the<br>
preservative for use in the present formulations is benzalkconium chloride or phenylethyl alcohol.<br>
In certain embodiments, the formulations herein comprise from about 0.01% and about 1.0%<br><br>
w/w of benzalkonium chloride, or from about 0.01% and about 1% v/w phenylethyl alcohol.<br>

The present formulations may further comprise from about 0.01% to about 90%, or about<br>
0.01% to about 50%, or about 0.01% to about 25%, or about 0.01% to about 10%, or about<br>
0.01% to about 1% of one or more excipients and additives -which are pharmacologically<br>
suitable. Excipients and additives generally have no pharmacological activity, or at least no<br>
undesirable pharmacological activity. The concentration of these may vary with the selected<br>
agent, although the presence or absence of these agents, or their concentration is not an essential<br>
feature of the invention. The excipients and additives may include, but are not limited to,<br>
surfactants, moisturizers, stabilizers, complexing agents, antioxidants, or other additives known<br>
in the art. Complexing agents include, but are not limited to, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid<br>
(EDTA) or a salt thereof, such as the disodium salt, citric acid, nitrilotriacetic acid and the salts<br>
thereof. In another embodiment, particularly in the suspension formulations provided herein, the<br>
complexing agent is sodium edetate. In one embodiment, the compositions contain sodium<br>
edetate at a concentration of about 0.05 mg/mL to about 0.5 mg/mL, or about 0.1 mg/mL to<br>
about 0.2 mg/mL. Also, for example, the formulations of the present invention may comprise<br><br>
from about 0.001% to about 5% by weight of a humectant to inhibit drying of the mucous<br>
membrane and to prevent irritation. Any of a variety of pharrnaceutically-acceptable humectants<br>
can be employed, including sorbitol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol or mixtures<br>
thereof, for example.<br>
The formulations provided herein also may comprise about 0.01% to about 90%, or about<br>
0.01% to about 50%, or about 0.01% to about 25%, or about 0.01% to about 10%, or about<br>
0.01% to about 10% of one or more solvents or co-solvents to increase the solubility of any of<br>
the components of the present formulation. Solvents or co-solvents for use herein include, but<br>
are not limited to, hydroxylated solvents or other pharmaceutically- acceptable polar solvents,<br>
such as alcohols including isopropyl alcohol, glycols such as propylene glycol, polyethylene<br>
glycol, polypropylene glycol, glycol ether, glycerol, and polyoxyethylene alcohols. In another<br>
embodiment, the formulations of the present invention may comprise one or more conventional<br>
diluents known in the art. The preferred diluent is water.<br>
Tonicity agents may include, but are not limited to, sodium chloride, potassium chloride,<br>
zinc chloride, calcium chloride and mixtures thereof. Other osmotic adjusting agents may also<br>
include, but are not limited to, mannitol, glycerol, and dextrose or mixtures thereof. In an<br>
alternative embodiment, the present formulation may comprise about 0.01% to about 10% w/w,<br>
or about 1% to about 8% w/w, or 1% to about 6% w/w, preferably about 5.0% w/w. The<br>
preferred tonicity agent is Dextrose, anhydrous.<br>
In one alternative embodiment, the formulations of the present invention are stable. As<br>
used herein, the stability of formulations provided herein refers to the length of time at a given<br><br>
temperature that greater than 80%, S5%, 90% or 95% of the initial amount of drug substance,<br>
e.g., bedomethasone, is present in the formulation. For example, the formulations provided<br>
herein may be stored between about 15°C and about 30°C, and remain stable for at least 1,2,12,<br>
18, 24 or 36 months. Also, the formulations may be suitable for administration to a subject in<br>
need thereof after storage for more than 1,2, 12,18, 24 or 36 months at 25°. Also, in another<br>
alternative embodiment, using Arrhenius Kinetics, more than 80%, or more than 85%, or more<br>
than 90%, or more than 95% of the initial amount of drug substance (e.g., bedomethasone)<br>
remains after storage of the formulations for more than 1,2, 12, IS, 24 or 36 months between<br>
about 15°C and about 30°C.<br>
The formulations of the present invention may be manufactured in any conventional<br>
manner by thoroughly mixing the ingredients described herein at ambient or elevated<br>
temperatures in order to achieve solubility of ingredients where appropriate.<br>
The preparation of a drug substance having the particle size distribution profile of the<br>
present invention may be obtained by any conventional means known in the art, or by minor<br>
modification of such means. For example, suspensions of drug particles can rapidly undergo<br>
particulate size reduction when subjected to "jet milling" (high pressure particle in liquid milling)<br>
techniques. Other known methods for reducing particle size into the micrometer range include<br>
mechanical milling, the application of ultrasonic energy and other techniques.<br>
In one alternative embodiment, the present invention provides a method for the treatment<br>
of rhinitis comprising the step of administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically<br><br>
effective amount of the formulations disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the method of the<br>
present invention comprises administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of drug substance, wherein the drug substance is beclomethasone, the drug substance<br>
having a particle size distribution profile described herein. Preferably, the drug substance is<br>
beclomethasone dipropionate. In certain embodiments, the subject is a mammal. In other<br>
embodiments, the subject is a human.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides a method for treating rhinitis<br>
comprising the step of administering to a subject in need thereof a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of the present formulation, wherein the formulation comprises an aqueous suspension<br>
comprising about 0.005% to about 5% by weight of beclomethasone having a particle size<br>
distribution profile described herein. In certain embodiments, the formulation is sterile, contains<br>
a preservative and/or is stable.<br>
In other embodiments, the present invention provides a method for treating rhinitis<br>
comprising the step of administering the formulations disclosed herein intranasally to a subject in<br>
need thereof. Preferably, the formulation is administered to a subject via nasal spray, preferably<br>
a metered-dose spray pump. The metered-dose spray pump may be manually operated, such that<br>
each actuation of the pump delivers a single dosage of the drug substance to the subject. In<br>
another embodiment, the formulation of the present invention may be administered via a nasal<br>
spray pump or atomizing spray pump.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the nasal spray comprises a metered-dose, manual<br>
pump spray unit (e.g. metering atomizing pump) comprising a microcrystalline suspension of<br><br>
beclomethasone dipropionate, moriohydrate equivalent to 0.02 % to about 2.0%, preferably about<br>
0.10% to about 0.05%, more preferably about 0.042% w/w beclomethasone dipropionate,<br>
calculated on a dried basis, in 2n aqueous medium. In another alternative embodiment, said<br>
suspension comprises microcrystalline cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose sodium, dextrose,<br>
benzalkonium chloride, polysorbate 80, and 0.25% v/w phenylethyl alcohol. An acid, preferably<br>
hydrochloric acid, may be added to adjust pH. The pH may be between 4.5 and 7.0. After initial<br>
priming (3-4 actuations), each actuation of the manual pump may deliver from a nasal adapter<br>
about 10 mg to about 1,000 mg, preferably about 100 mg to about 500 mg, most preferably about<br>
100 mg of suspension containing beclomethasone dipropionate, monohydrate equivalent to about<br>
10 meg to about 500 meg, or about 10 meg to about 100 meg, or about 30 meg to about 60 meg,<br>
preferably about 40 meg to about 50 meg, more preferably about 42 meg of beclomethasone<br>
dipropionate, calculated on a dry basis. Each bottle containing the present formulations of nasal<br>
spray may provide about 20-600 metered doses, preferably 100 to about 300 doses, more<br>
preferably at least 200 metered doses.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the administration of the present formulations may<br>
comprise 1,2, 3,4, 5,6, 7 or 8 inhalations of the present formulation in each nostril one, two,<br>
three, four or five times a day. Each inhalation may comprise about 1 meg to about 400 meg, or<br>
about 1 meg to about 100 meg, preferably about 30 meg to about 100 meg, more preferably about<br>
30 meg to about 80 meg, or about 30 meg to about 50 meg most preferably about 42 meg,. The<br>
total dose per day of the drug substance may comprise about 10 meg and about 4000 meg, about<br>
10 meg to about 1,000 meg, about 10 meg to about 500 meg, or about 100 meg to about 900 meg<br><br>
preferably about 100 meg to about 500 meg, or more preferably about 150 meg to about 400<br>
meg.<br>
In another alternative embodiment, the administration of the present formulations may<br>
comprise 1 and only 1 inhalation in each nostril a day. In one alternative embodiment, the<br>
starting dosage of the present formulation may comprise one and only 1 inhalation in each nostril<br>
once daily. In another alternative embodiment, such starting dosage is appropriate for adults.<br>
Each inhalation may comprise about 5 meg to about 100 meg, preferably from about 30 meg to<br>
70 meg, more preferably about 42 meg of beclomethasone, calculated on a dry basis.<br>
Administering 1 and only I inhalation in each nostril is more beneficial and advantageous<br>
over conventional regimens of the prior art, which require more inhalations in each nostril per<br>
day. For example, other known nasal spray products, e.g., beclomethasone products, require 1 or<br>
2 inhalations (42 to 84 meg) in each nostril twice a day (total dose, 168-336 meg/day). In<br>
contrast, formulations of the present invention may require 1 and only 1 inhalation in each nostril<br>
a day. By limiting the dosage, or amount of inhalations per day, individuals would likely comply<br>
with the regimen or regular dosage schedule to achi eve adequate relief, thereby improving the<br>
patient's quality of life as compared with other traditional treatments. Further, administering<br>
fewer inhalations provide the individual more opportunity to take other medications during<br>
treatment, such as, for example, other oral or inhaled steroids, thus reducing likelihood of<br>
overdosing or cross reaction between medications. Further, providing fewer inhalations would<br>
reduce the likelihood of addiction to the drug substance in the nasal formulation. Moreover,<br>
administering fewer inhalations may reduce toxicity and the adverse events associated with 2 or<br><br>
more inhalations of a particular drug substance in each nostril per day. Also, individuals<br>
hypersensitive to 2 or more doses of a particular drug substance would benefit from receiving 1<br>
and only 1 dose per day.<br>
The present formulations can be packaged as kits or systems, which optionally contain<br>
other components, including instructions for use of the formulations. Articles of manufacture,<br>
containing packaging material and a formulation provided herein, which is useful for treatment,<br>
prevention or amelioration of one or more symptoms of a medical condition, disorder or disease<br>
(e.g. rhinitis) and a label indicating that the formulation is used for treatment, prevention or<br>
amelioration of one or more symptoms of diseases or disorders associated with undesired and/or<br>
uncontrolled rhinitis.<br>
VI. Example<br>
The following example is included for illustrative purposes only and is not intended to<br>
limit the scope of the invention.<br>
A double-blind, double-dummy, randomized, placebo-controlled, study was performed to<br>
assess the safety and efficacy of the formulations of the present invention (Dey BD), in<br>
adolescent and adult patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis. The objectives of this study were (1)<br>
to determine the safety and efficacy of Dey BD compared with placebo during 2 weeks of<br>
treatment in adult and adolescent patients with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR); and (2) to<br>
establish the comparability of Dey BD with Beconase AQ Nasal Spray during 2 weeks of<br>
treatment in adults and adolescent patients. Currently, Beconase AQ is commercially available<br>
from GlaxoSmithKlein.<br><br>
Both Dey and Beconase AQ® comprised a microcrystalline suspension of<br>
beclomethasone dipropionate, monohydrate equivalent to 0.042% w/w beclomethasone<br>
dipropionate, calculated on a dried basis, in an aqueous medium. However, the beclomethasone<br>
used in Dey BD nasal spray was derived and/or purchased from a different source from that used<br>
in Beconase AQ®. Otherwise, both nasal sprays contained the same excipients and additives in<br>
the same amounts. Also, Dey BD nasal spray and Beconase AQ® was administered by the same<br>
metered-dose, manual pump spray. For both the BD nasal spray and Beconase AQ®, each<br>
activation of the manual pump delivered about 42 meg of beclomethasone dipropionate.<br>
The study was conducted during the 2001 fall allergy season (local fall pollen) in the<br>
United States. The study duration was 3 weeks and consisted of 2 phases: a 1-week baseline<br>
screening period followed by a 2-week randomized double-blind treatment phase. Patients were<br>
seen on an outpatient basis on Day -7, Day 1, Day 7, and Day 14. Initial baseline assessments<br>
occurred 1 week prior (Day -7 ± 2 days) to randomization to treatment. Patients were first<br>
assigned a patient number and then screened for eligibility based on study entrance criteria and<br>
completion of baseline assessments. If eligible, patients were then given standard oral<br>
antihistamine as a rescue medication and a Patient Total Nasal Symptom Score (TNSS) Diary.<br>
Patients recorded daily TNSS (sum of the signs and symptoms for runny nose, nasal congestion,<br>
sneezing, and itchy nose) in their diaries rating each on a scale of zero to 3 with zero being no<br>
symptoms present and 3 being severe symptoms present, as well as the amount of oral<br>
antihistamine taken. One week later, at the conclusion of the baseline assessments, the patients<br><br>
returned to the study site and were re-evaluated for eligibility. Patients who did not complete the<br>
diaries or no longer met the inclusion/exclusion criteria were discontinued.<br>
To be included in the study, patients must have been diagnosed with SAP. and must have<br>
met the following inclusion criteria:<br>
• At least a 2-yr history of moderate-to-severe SAR due to fall pollen;<br>
•	Individuals 12 years of age and older;<br>
•	Confirmed IgE-mediated hypersensitivity to local fall pollen within last 12<br>
months (a positive result is required);<br>
•	Minimum TNSS of 8 of a maximum of 12 on at least 3 days during the<br>
baseline period, one of which must have been within 3 days of Day 1;<br>
•	If receiving immunotherapy, a stable maintenance regimen for 30 days prior<br>
to study enrollment;<br>
•	General good health and free of disease or concomitant treatment that could<br>
interfere with interpretation of study results;<br>
•	Written informed consent/pediatric assent; and,<br>
•	Willingness to comply with study procedures.<br>
Patients who met all. criteria were then randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups: (1) Dey<br>
BD Nasal Spray (0.042%) Low Dose - 1 spray of Bottle 1 (Dey BD) in each nostril followed by<br>
I spray of Bottle 2 (placebo) in each nostril twice daily (morning and evening); (2) Dey BD<br>
Nasal Spray (0.042%) High Dose - 1 spray of Bottle 1 (Dey BD) in each nostril followed by 1<br>
spray of Bottle 2 (Dey BD) in each nostril twice daily (morning and evening); (3) Beconase AQ®<br>
Low Dose - 1 spray of Bottle 1 (Beconase AQ®) in each nostril followed by 1 spray of Bottle 2<br>
(placebo) in each nostril twice daily (morning and evening); (4) Beconase AQ® High Dose - 1<br>
spray of Bottle 1 (Beconase AQ®) in each nostril followed by 1 spray of Bottle 2 (Beconase<br>
AQ®) twice daily (morning and evening); and (5) placebo - 1 spray of Bottle 1 (placebo) in each<br><br>
nostril followed by 1 spray of Bottle 2 (placebo) in each nostril twice daily (morning and<br>
evening).<br>
The double-blind treatment phase (Day 1 through 14) consisted of twice daily self-<br>
administered treatment (1 spray from each bottle into each nostril per administration). On Days 7<br>
and 14 (or at early termination), patients returned to the study sites and were evaluated. Efficacy<br>
assessments included reflective and instantaneous TNSS daily diary information, patient and<br>
physician global evaluations, and use of rescue medication.<br>
The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline in a patient's 12-hour<br>
(AM and PM combined) reflective TNSS over a 2-week treatment period. The primary endpoint<br>
analysis was the comparison of Dey BD High Dose versus placebo. TNSS consisted of the sum<br>
of the 12-hour assessment scores for runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and itchy nose<br>
recorded twice daily on the Patient's TNSS Diary card. Baseline was defined as the average of<br>
the run-in period 12-hour (AM plus PM combined) reflective TNSS from the 7 calendar days ±2<br>
days preceding Day 1.<br>
The secondary endpoints for this study were as follows:<br>
•	The change from baseline in a patient's combined AM plus PM 12-hour<br>
reflective TNSS overall (Days 2-14);<br>
•	The change from baseline in a patient's combined AM plus PM 12-hour<br>
reflective TNSS at Days 7 and 14;<br>
•	The change from baseline in a patient's AM 12-hour reflective TNSS;<br>
•	The change from baseline in a patient's PM 12-hour reflective TNSS;<br>
•	The change from baseline to 1-week and 2-week postbaseline in area under<br>
the concentration curve (AUC)s of patient's combined AM plus PM 12-hour<br>
reflective TNSS;<br><br>
•	The change from baseline to 1-week and 2-week postbaseline in AUC of<br>
patient's AM 12-hour reflective TNSS;<br>
•	The change from baseline to 1-week and 2-week postbaseline in AUC of<br>
patient's PM 12-hour reflective TNSS;<br>
•	The change from baseline in patient's AM plus PM combined instantaneous<br>
TNSS; <br>
•	The change from baseline in patient's AM instantaneous TNSS;<br>
•	The change from baseline in patient's PM instantaneous TNSS;<br>
•	Patient global evaluation of change in SAP. signs and symptoms;<br>
•	Physician global evaluation of change in SAR signs and symptoms; and,<br>
•	Use of rescue medication.<br>
Secondary efficacy endpoints were compared across all treatment groups.<br>
With respect to efficacy, both reflective and instantaneous change from baseline in 12-<br>
hour (AM plus PM, combined and individual) TNSS for primary and secondary variables at<br>
Week 1 and Week 2 were compared across the groups using a mixed effect analysis of variance<br>
(ANOVA) model. Area under the curve (AUC) of the 12-hour (AM plus PM, combined and<br>
individual) reflective TNSS was calculated for the baseline period and Week 1 and Week 2 (over<br>
Days 2-14) postbaseline using a trapezoidal method. The change from baseline was compared<br>
across the groups using a similar ANOVA model. The patient's and physician's global<br>
evaluation of change from baseline in SAR symptoms was compared between the groups using a<br>
one-way ANOVA model. Frequency of rescue medication use, as well as the percentage of<br>
patients needing rescue medication, was compared across the groups using Fisher's exact test<br>
The average number of tablets of rescue medication was compared using an ANOVA model. All<br>
statistical analyses were performed for both Intent-to-Treat (ITT) and per-protocol populations.<br><br>
Missing observations in the ITT Population were imputed using the last observation carried<br>
forward (LOCF) method. All inferential statistics were conducted against a two-sided alternative<br>
hypothesis at 0.05 level of significance.<br>
A total of 674 patients were randomized to 1 of 5 treatment groups (136 Dey BD High<br>
Dose, 136 Dey BD Low Dose, 135 Beconase AQ® High Dose, 129 Beconase AQ® Low Dose, or<br>
138 placebo groups); 661 (98.07%) patients completed the study and 13 (1.93%) patients<br>
discontinued. The most common reasons for discontinuation were AE and withdrawal of consent<br>
(4/13 patients each, 30.77%). More than 85% of the patient population was White, more than<br>
60% were female with a mean age across groups ranging from 33.62 to 36.79 years and a mean<br>
antigen challenge result ranging from 8.6 to 9.4 mm. The majority of patients had a negative<br>
history of beclomethasone usage (mean range=82.61-87.60%).<br>
All active treatment groups (Dey BD and Beconase AQ®) demonstrated reductions in<br>
TNSS over the 2-week treatment period. Regardless of which efficacy endpoint was examined<br>
(i.e., 12-hour reflective TNSS, instantaneous TNSS, change in AUC), the Treatment effect was<br>
highly significant as was the Day effect (p=0.0000) indicating improvement in TNSS. Both Dey<br>
BD and Beconase AQ High Dose groups were statistically superior to placebo for both primary<br>
and secondary efficacy endpoint analyses, as were Dey BD Low Dose and Beconase AQ® Low<br>
Dose treatment groups. Treatment-by-Day interaction (overall Days 2-14) and Treatment-by-<br>
Week interaction effects were not statistically significant indicating that the treatment groups<br>
behaved similarly for the duration of the study, except for the magnitude of improvement in<br>
TNSS. There was no statistical difference between Dey BD and Beconase AQ® High Dose<br><br>
groups for any efficacy endpoint analysis. However, the Dey BD Low Dose group was found to<br>
be consistently statistically superior to the Beconase AQ® Low Dose group in relieving<br>
symptoms of SAR. Results of analyses for the Per Protocol Population paralleled those of the<br>
ITT Population for all efficacy variables.<br>
Figure 1 shows the change from baseline in AM and PM reflective TNSS over time in the<br>
ITT population over the 14 day study period. Figure 2 shows the change from baseline in AM<br>
reflective TNSS over time in the ITT population over the 14 day study period. Figure 3 shows<br>
the change from baseline in PM reflective TNSS over time in the ITT population over the 14 day<br>
study period. Figure 4 shows the change from baseline in AM and PM reflective TNSS over<br>
time in the PP population over the 14 day study period.<br>
In Figures 1-4, the efficacy of the nasal formulations is expressed as the change from<br>
baseline (pretreatment) in a composite score of nasal symptoms (e.g. runny nose, sneezing, nasal<br>
itching and congestion) referred to as total nasal symptom scores (TNSS). The change from<br>
baseline in TNSS scores is expressed in absolute units (rather tan percent change from baseline).<br>
Using an analysis of variance model (ANOVA), the least square mean (LS Mean) for the<br>
baseline (positive value) and change from baseline (negative value if symptoms improve) are<br>
obtained. The higher the negative value seen in the LS Mean, the greater was the change<br>
(improvement) in TNSS.<br>

wherein the particle size is in microns. Table 2 shows the quantitative composition of Dey BD.<br><br><br><br><br>
