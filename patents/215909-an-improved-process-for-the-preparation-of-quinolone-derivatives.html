				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of quinolone derivatives. The present invention particularly relates to an improved process for the preparation of quinolone derivative of the general formula I.<br><br>
wherein R=C1-C6 alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyi, aryl, substituted aryl, NR1R2=diarylamino, arylalkylamino, C1-C6-dialkylamino, piprazinyl, N or C alkyl (C1-C6) substituted piperazinyl, morpholino, pyrrolidinyl, substituted pyrrolidinyl, aralkyi, substituted aralkyi etc.<br>
The compounds of the general formula I are normally prepared by reacting the appropriate haloquinolone of the formula II<br><br>
wherein R = as defined for compound of formula-l, R3=COOR3 (R3=C1-C6 alkyl, aryl, aralkyi), nitrile, a carboxamide (-CONR1R2, R3 and R3 = C1-Ce alkyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyi, aralkyi), X= CI, Br, F<br>
with an appropriate amine of the formula III<br><br>
wherein NR1R2=diarylamino, arylalkylamino, C1-C6-dialkylamino, piperazinyl, N or C alkyl (C1-C6) substituted piperazinyl, morpholino, pyrrolidinyl, substituted pyrrolidinyl, aralkyi, substituted aralkyi, etc.<br>
in a polar protic or aprotic solvent at a high temperature for a prolonged period (Canadian   patent   no   1255678).   The   above   said   reaction   is   illustrated<br><br>
as shown in scheme-1 below.<br><br>
wherein R, R3 and R3 are as defined above.<br>
SCHEME-1 The above said process has the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	Selectivity for the halogen displacement is only 90 to 95%. The remaining material is a fluorine displaced derivative.<br>
2.	The process requires more than 3 moles of the amine per mole of quinolonic acid.<br>
3.	The reaction requires very high temperature (more than  100° C) and prolonged reaction time (4-8 hours).<br>
4.	Removal of impurity is a tedious process and recovery of the final product is not 100%.<br>
5.	The yield of the final product is normally less than 80%.<br>
Another conventional process disclosed in PCT International application WO 88 07,993 involves the enhancement of halogen activity by chelating the p-keto acid part of quinolonic acid of formula IV with a boron derivative B(0Ac)3 of the formula (V). This reaction is shown in the Scheme-2 given below.<br><br><br>
SCHEME-2<br>
In the Scheme-2 shown above the symbols given in the formulae are as defined above.<br>
This process has the following disadvantages:<br>
1.	The process requires high temperature (&gt; 100° C)<br>
2.	The reaction time is too short (5 to 10 minutes) to perform it on a commercial scale.<br>
3.	The reaction works with only polar aprotic solvents like DMSO.<br>
4.	The reaction requires more than 3 moles of amine per mole of quinolonic<br>
acid.<br>
5.	Though the process claims to have more than 90% yield actually it never<br>
exceeds 75%.<br>
Since the quinolone drugs like ciprofioxin, enrofloxacin etc falling within the general fomnula I given above are very useful broad spectrum antibacterial drugs there is a need to enhance the yield as well as the purity of the said compounds prepared. Accordingly there is an urgent need for developing an improved process for the preparation of the said compounds resulting in higher yields and improved purity.<br><br>
Therefore the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I defined above having improved yield (90 - 95%) as well as improved purity.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of compounds of the general formula I as defined above by enhancing the reactivity of the halogen (X) in the formula IV given above towards various amines thereby reducing the formation of the impurity of the formula VII,<br><br>
VII<br>
wherein X, R, R1, R3 are as defined above.<br>
resulting in the increased purity of the final compound of the formula I.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of the compound of the formula I defined above which process involves a facile reaction on both of the halogens in the compound of the formula VIII.<br><br>
wherein R, R3 are as defined above. The invention has been developed based on our finding that:<br>
1.	Both the chlorines present in the formula VIII undergo the reaction even at room temperature.<br>
2.	The low temperature reaction leads to higher yields ( 90 - 95%) and purity of the compounds of the formula I.<br><br>
3.	The amount of the costly amine of the formula III (R1R2NH) in the process requires only one equivalent.<br>
4.	the step of removing the impurity of formula VII is totally eliminated as no such impurity is formed.<br>
