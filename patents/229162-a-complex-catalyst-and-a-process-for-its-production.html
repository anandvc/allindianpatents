				<td>DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR PRODUCTION OF ALCOHOL DERIVATIVES<br>
Technical Field of Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of alcohol derivatives and more particularly to a process for the regio- or stereoselective production of alcohol derivatives as well as to catalysts having excellent regio- and stereo-selectivity.<br>
Background Art<br>
It has been known that 2-[l-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethoxy]-pyridine, which is a nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound having juvenile hormone activity, is produced by a process in which an alcohol derivative such as l-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethanol is reacted with a halogen-ated nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound such as 2-chloropyridine in the presence of a base (JP 3034951 A). The alcohol derivative, l-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethanol, which is an intermediate for production, has been produced by, for example, reacting propylene oxide with 4-phenoxy-phenol in the presence of a base. In this process, however, in addition to the desired l-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethanol, there is also produced its isomer, 2-methyl-2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethanol, as a by-product; therefore, it is necessary to separate and remove this isomer by a separating technique such as crystallization. For this reason, the above process cannot always be said to be a quite satisfactory process from an industrial point of view.<br>
Further, for producing optically active nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds, it requires the step of treating an organic carboxylic acid ester of the above alcohol derivative with a microorganism-derived esterase to cause asymmetric hydrolysis, affording an optically active alcohol deriva-<br><br>
tive.    This cannot always be said to be quite satisfactory from an industrial point of view in that the number of steps for production becomes increased.<br>
Purpose of the Invention<br>
The primary purpose of the invention is to provide an industrially advantageous process for the production of alcohol derivatives as described above.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
According to the process of the present invention, an alcohol derivative can be obtained in a regio- and stereo-selective manner by the use of a catalyst as described below for the reaction of a cyclic ether compound, a typical example of which is propylene oxide, with a phenol derivative. In addition, by reacting the alcohol derivative obtained by this process with a halogenated nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound, the desired nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound can be produced in high yield.<br>
That is, the present invention provides:<br>
1.	a complex catalyst comprising a metal complex and a Lewis<br>
acid as components, the metal complex being of formula (1):<br><br><br>
independently hydrogen, halogen, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl, alkoxy, haloalkyl, haloalkoxy, hydroxyl, nitro, amino, carbamoyI, carboxyl, substituted or unsubstituted aryl, or silyl; or two adjacent groups of R , R", R , R , R , R', R^ and R^ are combined together to represent a naphthalene ring by foriaing a ring together with a benzene ring to which they are attached;<br>
one of R9 and R10 is hydrogen and the other is phenyl or naphthyl optionally substituted with at least one selected from the group consisting of alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, alkoxy of 1 to 4 carbon atoms, haloalkyl, halo-alkoxy and halogen; or either one pair of R9 and R10 attached to the different carbon atoms are combined together at their ends to form a tetramethylene linkage and the other pair are hydrogen atoms;<br>
Q is a single bond or alkylene of 1 to 4 carbon atoms; or Q is combined with R^ and R^^ to represent l,l'-binaphthyl attached to the nitrogen atoms at 2 and 2' positions;<br>
M is a metal ion; and<br>
A is a balancing counter ion or ligand;<br>
2.	a process for the production of the above complex catalyst;<br>
3.	a process for the production of an alcohol derivative, characterized in that a cyclic ether compound is reacted with a phenol derivative in the presence of the above complex catalyst; and<br>
4.	the above production process comprising the step of reacting the alcohol derivative with a halogenated nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compound in the presence of a base to give a nitrogen-containing heterocychc compound.<br>

The Lewis acid may include aluminum halides, dialkyl aluminum halides, trialkoxy aluminum, titanium halides, tetraalkoxy titanium, boron halides and zinc halides.<br>
The aluminum halides may include aluminum chloride and aluminum bromide. The dialkyl aluminum halides may include diethyl aluminum chloride, diethyl aluminum bromide and diisopropyl aluminum chloride. The trialkoxy aluminum may include triethoxy aluminum, triisopropoxy aluminum and tri-tert-butoxy aluminum. The titanium halides may include titanium tetrachloride. The tetraalkoxy titanium may include tetraisopropoxy titanium. The boron halides may include boron trifluoride, boron trichloride and boron tribromide. The zinc halides may include zinc chloride and zinc bromide.<br>
The Lewis acid may be used as such or as a solution in an organic solvent. The Lewis acid, which is unstable to, for example, air or water and which requires careful handling, may preferably be used as a solution in an organic solvent. The organic solvent is not particularly limited, so long as it is inert to the Lewis acid, and may include aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane and heptane; and ether solvents such as diethyl ether and tert-butyl methyl ether. Further, complex compounds of Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride-diethyl ether complex compounds may also be used.<br>
The amount of Lewis acid used is not particularly limited, but is usually 0,2 to 5 moles, preferably 0.5 to 2 moles, relative to 1 mole of metal complex (1).<br>
The metal complex catalyst of the present invention can be produced by reacting metal complex (1) with a Lewis acid, and the reaction is usually carried out in an organic solvent by contacting and mixing both of them. When both of them are contacted and mixed, the reaction will occur to form a novel complex.    The production of a novel (asymmetric) complex is achieved<br><br>
by, for example, mixing both of them in an organic solvent, which causes the change of color in the reaction mixture, thereby making it possible to verify that the metal complex is being reacted with the Lewis acid to form a novel (asymmetric) complex. For example, when (-)-N,N'-bis(3,5-di-tert-butylsal-icylidene)-l,2-cyclohexanediamino cobalt (III) 4-phenoxyphenolate is mixed with aluminum chloride in tert-butyl methyl ether, the color of the mixture changes from brown to dark green.<br>

The organic solvent may include ether solvents such as diethyl ether and tert-butyl methyl ether; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as toluene; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as chlorobenzene and chloroform; and aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane. The amounts for their use are not particularly limited.<br>
If, for example, water is present in the reaction system, Lewis acids are easily decomposed; therefore, the reagents, solvents to be used and the like may preferably be subjected to dehydration in advance or dehydrating agents such as molecxilar sieves may preferably be allowed to coexist in the reaction system.<br>
When metal complex (1) is reacted with a Lewis acid in an organic solvent, the solution containing a novel complex catalyst produced may be used as such in the reaction of cyclic ether compound (2) with phenol derivative (3), or the novel complex catalyst may be separated before use by, for example, concentration of the above solution.<br>
In this step, the use of a metal complex of formula (1') or (I'a) makes it possible to obtain an asymmetric complex catalyst. The reaction of cyclic ether compound (2) with phenol derivative (3) in the presence of this catalyst makes it possible to the desired optically active alcohol derivative by the<br><br>
reaction exhibiting excellent regio- and stereo-selectivity.<br>
Next, the following will describe the step of reacting a cyclic ether compound with a phenol derivative in the presence of the complex catalyst obtained above to give an alcohol derivative.<br>

The amount of cyclic ether compound used is usually 1 mole or more (2 moles or more when an asymmetric complex catalyst is used), relative to 1 mole of phenol derivative, and there is no particular upper limit thereof. Since too large amounts may easily result in an economical disadvantage, the amount thereof is practically 5 moles or less (10 moles or less when an asymmetric complex catalyst is used).<br>
The complex catalyst comprising metal complex (1) and a Lewis acid, although it exhibits sufficient activity in a catalytic amount, may exhibit sufficient catalytic activity, preferably in amounts for use ranging from 0.1 to 3 mol%, relative to 1 mole of phenol derivative. Of course, amounts larger than 3 mol% may be used: however, larger amounts for use will easily result in an economical disadvantage. Therefore, practical amounts for use are as described above.<br>
