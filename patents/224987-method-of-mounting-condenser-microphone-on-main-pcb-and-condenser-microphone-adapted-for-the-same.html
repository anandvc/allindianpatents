				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of mounting a condenser microphone,<br>
and more particularly, to a method of mounting a condenser microphone on a main<br>
printed circuit board (PCB) and a condenser microphone adapted for the method.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Generally, customers have desires for high functionality and miniaturization of<br>
electronics products. Hence, manufacturers of electronic products are trying to make<br>
smaller products with all their heart in order to meet such desires. Surface mount<br>
technology (SMT) should be used to miniaturize products, but the SMT cannot be used<br>
to elements having a weak resistance against temperature because a high temperature is<br>
applied to the parts during reflow of surface mount device (SMD).<br>
Additionally, when assuming that SMT is used, it is necessary to direct a front<br>
surface of the main PCB, on which elements are mounted, toward an inward direction<br>
of an electronic product during the mounting of the PCB considering thickness of the<br>
elements themselves.<br>
However, in a conventional condenser microphone, it is difficult to mount a main<br>
PCB such that the front surface of the main PCB is directed toward an opposite<br>
direction of sound source, that is, such that the front surface is directed toward an inner<br>
space of a casing of the condenser microphone, because the casing has sound holes as<br>
shown in Figs. 1A and 1B. If the front surface of the main PCB is mounted in the<br>
opposite direction of the sound source, sound quality goes bad because delivery path of<br>
sound wave increases.<br>
FIG. 1A is a perspective view of a conventional condenser microphone mounted<br>
on a main PCB, and FIG. 2B is a side sectional view of a conventional condenser<br>
microphone mounted on a main PCB.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 1A and IB, a condenser microphone 10 includes a casing 12<br>
having sound holes 12a. A PCB 14 of the condenser microphone 10 is mounted on a<br>
main PCB 20 and soldered such that connecting terminals 14a and 14b of the<br>
microphone 10 and bonded to a land of the main PCB 20. To allow sound waves to be<br>
directly transferred to the microphone 10 from a sound source, it is necessary to mount<br>
the main PCB 20 such that an element surface 20a of the main PCB 20 is directed<br>
toward the sound source. To meet such a need, a space as much as the thickness of the<br>
element is required. Non-described reference numeral 20b indicates an opposite<br>
surface to the element surface of the main PCB 20.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Wherever<br>
possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to<br>
the same or like parts.<br>
Concept of the invention<br>
FIG. 2A is a perspective view of a condenser microphone mounted on a main PCB<br>
according to the present invention, and FIG. 2B is a side sectional view of a condenser<br>
microphone mounted on a main PCB according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2A and 2B, a condenser microphone 100 according to the<br>
present invention is mounted on an element mounting surface 200a of a main PCB 200<br>
around a through hole 202 formed in the main PCB 200 by an ordinary soldering<br>
method or a SMD reflow such that sound waves are delivered via the through hole 202.<br>
According to the mounting method as described above, since the main PCB 200 can be<br>
mounted such that the element surface 200a is directed toward an inner surface of the<br>
condenser microphone 100, there is required a minimum space or thickness to mount<br>
the main PCB to electronic products like portable phone, tape recorder and so on.<br>
For this purpose, the condenser microphone 100 has a sound hole 110a formed in<br>
a PCB 110 thereof not in a casing 102 thereof. The assembled condenser microphone<br>
100 is seated on the element surface 200a of the main PCB 200 centering on the through<br>
hole 202 of the main PCB 200, and then connecting terminals 112 and 114 of the<br>
condenser microphone 100 are soldered with a pattern (land) of the main PCB 200,<br>
thereby completing the mounting.<br>
A sound wave from a sound source is delivered to the condenser microphone 100<br>
through the through hole 202 of the main PCB 200 and the sound hole 110a formed in<br>
the PCB 110 of the condenser microphone 100. The sound wave delivered to an inner<br>
space (chamber) of the microphone 100 vibrates a diaphragm and thus a gap between<br>
the diaphragm and a backplate is varied such that an electrostatic capacity is varied and<br>
the sound wave is converted into an electrical signal. According to the above<br>
construction, although the main PCB 200 with the condenser microphone 100 mounted<br>
thereon is installed such that the element surface 200a thereof is directed toward an<br>
inside of an electronic product if necessary, the short delivery path of the sound wave<br>
from the sound source enables a maintenance of good sound quality.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates a condenser microphone adapted for applying the mounting<br>
method of the present invention to the SMD method.<br>
As shown in FIGs. 3A to 3A, a condenser microphone 300 has a sound hole 304,<br>
which is formed not at a casing 302 thereof but at a PCB 200 thereof, to be suitably<br>
mounted on a main PCB 200 by an SMD method. Connecting terminals 306 and 308<br>
are protruded compared to a curled surface of the casing 302 and are preferably<br>
designed to include doughnut-shaped inner and outer circular plates. The doughnut-<br>
shaped outer circular plate 306 has preferably three gas exhaust grooves inclined<br>
outwardly in order to exhaust a gas generated during the SMD reflow process.<br>
First embodiment<br>
FIG. 4 is a side sectional view of a condenser microphone adapted to the present<br>
invention. The condenser microphone 400 includes a barrel-shaped casing 402 of<br>
which a bottom is closed and an opposite surface is opened, an insulation ring 404 made<br>
of heat resistant material and inserted in the casing 402 in order to protect inner<br>
elements from heat, and a PCB 418 formed with a sound hole 418a and IC and MLCC<br>
mounted thereon. Inside the insulation ring 404 are disposed a first barrel-shaped<br>
metal ring 406, a backplate 408, a spacer 410, a diaphragm 412, a polar ring 414 and a<br>
second barrel-shaped metal ring 416.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, the backplate 408 is contacted and supported to the bottom<br>
surface of the casing 402 through the first metal ring 406. The diaphragm 412 is<br>
supported toward the PCB 418 by the polar ring 414 and the second metal ring 416.<br>
The PCB 418 is formed with the sound hole 418a in order to pass a sound wave from a<br>
sound source.<br>
An electret material attached to the backplate 408, the spacer 410, the diaphragm<br>
412 and the insulation ring 404 are made of heat resistant and chemical resistant<br>
materials such as fluororesins, polymers or plastics. That is, the above heat resistant<br>
materials enables using the SMD method to manufacture the microphone of the present<br>
invention, and have various shapes of a film, a sheet or a roll and a bulk. In detail, the<br>
polymers (plastics) include ASA, Nylon 6, Nylon 66, Nylon 46, LCP, PBT, PC,<br>
PC/ABS, PC/PBT, PEEK, PEN, PES, PET, PMMA, POM, PTFE, SAN, PPS, SBR,<br>
TPU and so on, and the fluororesins include PTFE (TFE), FEP, PFA, ETFE, CTFE,<br>
PVDF, PVE, PCTFE, ECTFE, EPE, Nylon 6, PP, hard PVC and so on.<br>
During the SMD reflow process, a heat resistant cream solder is used in order to<br>
protect the elements (IC, MLCC) attached on the PCB 418 from breakaway. The<br>
cream solder includes Sn/Ag, Sn/Cu, Sn/Ag/Cu, Sn/Ag/Cu/Sb (The CASTING™<br>
Alloy), Sn/Ag/Cu/Bi (The OATEY™ Alloy) and so on.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIG. 3, connecting terminals 420 and 422 of the PCB 418<br>
are protruded compared to a curled surface of the casing 402 such that the microphone<br>
400 can be mounted on the main PCB 200 (for example, a main PCB for a portable<br>
phone) using an SMD method. The connecting terminals 420 and 422 include a<br>
circular terminal 422 formed at an inner portion of the PCB 418 in order to provide Vdd<br>
connection, and circular ground terminals 420 spaced away from each other and formed<br>
at an outer periphery of the PCB 418. The terminal 420 has three gas exhaust grooves<br>
310 for exhausting gas generated during the SMD bonding process.<br>
Operation of the condenser microphone constructed as above will now be<br>
described.<br>
When Vdd and GND voltages are applied to the connecting terminals 420 and 422<br>
of the microphone 400 connected to the main PCB 200, the microphone 400 operates.<br>
The diaphragm 412 is electrically connected to the PCB 418 by the polar ring 414 and<br>
the second metal ring 416, and the backplate 408 is electrically connected to the PCB<br>
418 by the first metal ring 406 and the casing 402.<br>
A sound wave created by a user passes through the through hole 202 of the main<br>
PCB 200 and the sound hole 418a of the PCB 418. Then, the sound wave that has<br>
passed through the holes vibrates the diaphragm 412, so that a gap between the<br>
diaphragm 412 and the backplate 408 is varied. Owing to the variation of the gap, an<br>
electrostatic capacity formed by the diaphragm 412 and the backplate 408 is varied,<br>
thereby obtaining electrical signals (voltage) corresponding to a variation of the sound<br>
wave. The signals are applied to the IC of the PCB 418 through the electrical<br>
connection path described above, amplified and delivered to the main PCB 200 through<br>
the connecting terminals 420 and 422.<br>
Second embodiment<br>
FIG. 5 is a side sectional view of a condenser microphone adapted to the present<br>
invention. The condenser microphone 500 includes a casing 502 having a closed<br>
bottom surface and an opened surface opposite to the bottom surface, an insulation ring<br>
504 formed of heat resistant material and inserted in the casing 502 and an integral base<br>
ring 516. A metal ring 506, a backplate 508, a spacer 510, a diaphragm 512 and a<br>
polar ring 514 are disposed inside the insulation ring 504. The insulation ring 504 and<br>
the polar ring 514 are supported by the integral base ring 516 toward the PCB 518.<br>
The diaphragm 512 and the polar ring 514 can be made integrally. A conductive layer<br>
516a is formed on an inner circumference of the integral base ring 516 in order to<br>
electrically connect the diaphragm 512 and the PCB 518 through the polar ring 514.<br>
The PCB 518 is formed with a sound hole 518a and elements (IC, MLCC) mounted<br>
thereon.<br>
Operation of the condenser microphone according to the present invention will<br>
now be described.<br>
When Vdd and GND voltages are applied to connecting terminals 520 and 522<br>
connected to the main PCB 200, the microphone 500 operates. The diaphragm 512 is<br>
electrically connected to the PCB 518 via the polar ring 514 and the conduction layer<br>
516a of the integral base ring 516, and the backplate 508 is electrically connected to the<br>
PCB 518 via the metal ring 506 and the casing 502.<br>
A sound wave created by a user passes through the through hole 202 of the main<br>
PCB 200 and the sound hole 518a of the PCB 518. The sound wave that has passed<br>
through the holes vibrates the diaphragm 512, so that a gap between the diaphragm 512<br>
and the backplate 508 is varied. Owing to the variation of the gap, an electrostatic<br>
capacity formed by the diaphragm 512 and the backplate 508 is varied, thereby<br>
obtaining electrical signals (voltage). The signals are applied to the IC of the PCB 518<br>
through the electrical connection path described above, amplified and delivered to the<br>
main PCB 200 through the connecting terminals 520 and 522.<br>
As described above, the microphone according to the present invention has a<br>
sound hole, which is formed in the PCB not in the casing such that the microphone is<br>
operated by a pressure of a sound wave introduced through a through hole of the main<br>
PCB, whereby the main PCB can be mounted with various choices. That is, if<br>
necessary, the main PCB can be mounted such that its elements surface is directed<br>
toward an inside of an electronic product, thereby maintaining good sound quality<br>
thanks to a short delivery path of sound wave.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and<br>
variations can be made in the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present<br>
invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come<br>
within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.<br>

A condenser microphone (100) and a method of mounting a condenser<br>
microphone (100) on a main PCB (200) are provided. The method includes the steps<br>
of: assembling the condenser microphone (100) by assembling elements of the<br>
condenser microphone (100) such that a vibration plate including a couple of a<br>
diaphragm and a backplate is directed toward an opened surface of a casing of the<br>
condenser microphone (100), the casing having a closed bottom surface and an opened<br>
surface opposite to the closed bottom surface, mounting a PCB having a sound hole on<br>
the casing and curling the opened surface of the casing such that a connecting terminal<br>
of the PCB is protruded compared to a curled surface; positioning the assembled<br>
condenser microphone (100) on a main PCB (200) such that the sound hole of the PCB<br>
of the condenser microphone (100) is in accordance with a through hole (202) formed<br>
in the main PCB (200) ; and soldering the connecting terminal of the condenser<br>
microphone (100) to a land of the main PCB (200). According to the present invention,<br>
if necessary, the main PCB (200) can be mounted such that its elements surface is<br>
directed toward an inside of an electronic product, thereby maintaining good sound<br>
quality thanks to a short delivery path of sound wave.</td>
