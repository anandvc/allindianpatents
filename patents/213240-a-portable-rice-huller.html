				<td>This invention relates to a portable Rice Mfll/Huller.<br>
This invention more particularly relates to a portable Pedal operated Rice Mill suited for Rural Households.<br>
As of today, in the Rural Household, throughout die country the Rural people use pounding method for dehusking paddy for obtaining dehusked Rice. In this traditional method a wooden mortar having one or more shallow pockets for keeping the paddy is used and Rural Folk pound the paddy by means of long log of wood called pestle.<br>
In this traditional method the mortar is at times made of stone also and for the pestle, the rural folk cut down trees thereby depleting the natural wealth.<br>
There being millions of rural household ion the country, large amount of wood is thus regularly consumed by the rural folk which destroys trees thus upsetting the ecological balance.<br>
Another drawback of the pounding method is the long time taken and the<br>
non-uniform  product obtained and rice grain is often broken.<br>
There are also available power operated Rice Hollers such as baby hullers operated by low power electric motor of around 3 HJP. or diesel operated Hulter using higher H.P. motor of up to 10 HP.<br>
Though the output capacity of these power operated Hullers is several times more than the pounding method, (5 to 10 tones), mis is not suited for rural condition, because of the high cost of the machines and power requirements. Furthermore, the diesel Huller contributes to pollution problems. Additionally where such power-operated hullers are installed at community centers, the imdrvidual Rural Household people will have to<br>
trek the distance both ways wasting time.<br>
OBJECTS OF THEINVENT1ON.<br>
It is therefore an object of the invention to propose a portable huller for materials like rice husk which does not occupy large floor space and can be set up at any place.<br>
It is another object of the invention to propose such a huller, which can ensure a larger output of at least three times than human pounding.<br>
It is a further object to provide a huller which can simultaneously separate the dehusked grain from the separated husk.<br>
It is a still further object to provide a huller in which the dehusking largely takes place due to shearing action so that there are smaller amounts of broken grains. These and other objects of the invention will be more fully clear from the following paragraphs. BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION.<br>
Thus according to this invention there is provided A portable rice huller comprising the following;   A feed boppeX<br>
a frame having ground support means to support me frame on me ground, a pair of pedestals, namely a front pedestal and a rear pedestal, a sittmg arrangement provided on the said frame above the said rear pedestal, the front pedestal being provided with the rice huller,<br>
th/» rear pcdesfe! hcving acoHu^GuatCu thereto a freely rotatable small crank<br>
mounted on bail bearings and operated by a pair of pedals provided at<br>
a level below the seat,<br>
the front pedestal having accommodated thereto (inside the hulfer), a freely rotatable bigger crank liaving been mounted on an axle and operabty connected to me said smaller crank,<br>
there being provided a freely rotatable central shaft mounted inside the huller hopper on ball bearings provided outside the hopper, the outer end of the said shaft extending beyond me said ball bearings and provided with a free wheel<br>
adopted to be operated by the said bigger crank, a large fly wheel being provided after the free wheel with one or more angular flap/s to provide a current of air when the fly wheel rotates, the inner end of the said shaft extending beyond the ball bearings having been formed of three sections, namely,<br>
a first spiral section immediately after the ball bearings having spiral grooves adopted to provide a forward thrust to the material, namely, paddy,<br>
a second or intermediate distributor section having cylindrical distributor adopted to distributed material, namdy-paddy, on to a third section<br>
having a plurality of flutes separated from each other and having raised<br>
top surfaces (edges) on me flutes with an edge/slide plate to close the<br>
raised housing when desired,<br>
all said three sections being accommodated within a housing,<br>
there being provided a sieve plate at the bottom of the said housing in order to<br>
allow the husk to fall through while retaining the dehusked grains,<br>
a feeding hopper/x&amp;ute) with a .cover plate being provided 4n the .top .of die<br>
said housing for feeding the said material<br>
and an out let for the dehusked material<br>
The other salient features of the holler are the following:<br>
.the. ball .bearings ofthe front crank are mounted to Ihe .side of Ac front pedestals, the ball bearings of the rear crank are mounted adjustably, preferably, on to an upward inclined cross beam which is secured between the front and rear pedestals! the ball bearings of the bigger crank are mounted, preferably at a higher level than that of the smaller crank:.<br>
the smaller crank is mounted to an axle whose intermediate end is held by the said ball bearings while each of the free end of the said axle is provided with a pedal<br>
the bigger crank is mounted on to an axle whose one end is held by the ball bearings, there being also provided a toothed wheel along side the said bigger crank, while die other end of the said axle extends into the housing and is provided \virn the above said three sections.<br>
the said smaller crank and the said toothed wheel are connected by a firstchain while the said bigger-crank andthe said fly wheel are *x&gt;one
Collecting baskets are provided below the sieve plate and the outlet end. As die flywheel rotates, the fen blades mounted therein provide a stream of air towards the falling material and the lighter husks are sifted. It is possible to provide additional abrasive means in the region wherein the paddy passes through for better efficiency.<br>
By suitably modifying the above construction it will also be possible to de-husk other similar agricultural harvested material having husk cover.<br>
DETAILED DESCRITIOMN OF THE DRAWINGS.<br>
The invention wfll now be more folly described with reference to the accompanying drawing wherein the different figures and photographs show the following details:<br>
Figure I shows a side view of the Huller,<br>
Figure-2 shows the cross-sectional view along the direction of arrow 'A—A* of figurel,<br>
Figure-3 shows a open inside view of the Huller section and Figure-4 shows the top view of the Huller section while Figure- 5 shows the bottom view of the huller section.<br>
Referring to the figures of the drawings, the following wffl be clear. The rice mill/ hulkr 1 has feed hopper (la) and ground supporting means, specially provided with a front ground support means 2 and a rear ground support means 3 .On each ground support is provided a vertical pedestal 2 A and 3 A respectively rigidly held to the respective ground supports.<br>
A horizontal beam 4 connects the lower ends of the two pedestals and another cross beam 5 also connects the two pedestals, a distance above the horizontal beam for strength and rigidity and also for other purposes explained hereinafter.<br>
A bearing housing 6 is mounted fixedly at a suitable level on the rear pedestal which holds an axle 7, On the left end of the axle ?, is mounted a crank 8 and a pedal 9a. Another pedal 9b is mounted on the right end of the axle 7.<br>
A crank 10, larger than crank 8 is mounted on an axle 11 held by a bearing housing 12. This housing is slidably or adjustably held on the lower end 13a of the slanting crossbeam 5 .The upper end 13b of the slanting crossbeam is held rigidly to the rear pedestal.<br>
There is also provided a free wheel 14 on the front pedestal to be chain operated by the crank 10.( not visible).<br>
On the upper part of the front pedestal is mounted a huller housing 16. In level with the huller housing is also held a ball bearing housing holding a long shaft 17 (Fig.2)..<br>
Hie shaft 07|extends into die huller housing (16) on one side and is held by aball bearing (15). A portion of the shaft extends beyond the housing and carries a free wheel (1$ to be chain operated, (not visible), by the crank (10). Adjacent the free wheel, the shaft is provided with a fly wheel (19) having fan blades (20). ( fig 2). Alternatively a separate fan (1 &amp; ^Derated by say, a belt (1&amp;&amp;) 'can also be provided.<br>
The portion of the shaft extending into die housing is formed of three sections, namely a first section (21), a second section (23) and a third section (25), as seen in figures 2 and 3<br>
The first section has spiral grooves (22) adopted for thrusting die material fed on it in a forward direction. The second section has a distributoi (24). The third section is a longer hulling section and has a plurality of longitudinal raised walls (27) Each wall has a curved top surface (26) matching die inner surface of the huller housing. There is provided a curved cover plate (29) for opening or closing the housing as and when required.<br>
T&amp;e operation of the rice boiler is as follows:<br>
The inlet closing piste at die bottom of the hopper is closed and the paddy is fed into the hopper. The person sitting on the seat then operates on the rear pedal thereby causing consequential motions to the other parts.. The fly wheel rotates and the huller shaft also rotates. The closed plate is opened and the paddy drops into the huller section. The paddy is thrust forward on to the distributor section, which distributes die paddy into the next section.<br>
The third section having the flutes acts on the paddy by shearing action between the inside of the huller and the top surface of the flutes. This removes the huskirom the paddy. The husk and die dehusked material fall on to me sieve plate, which allows the husk and very small grains to fan* through whfle retaining the major dehusked grains. These are forced through die outlet opening by me raised ends of the fluted rod.<br>
The housing has a tower section holding a sieve plate and an upper section formed of die housing cover. The cover is removably or hingedly held and has a feeding chute or trough at a place vertically above the said first conveying section of die axle in die housing below.<br>
There is provided an outlet O on die cover for conveying de-husked rice. Suitable opening adjustable plates are provided to die inlet and outlet<br>
The operation of die Huller has already been explained earlier.<br>
Thus by feeding harvested rice in to die hopper/feed chute and after adjusting die claims, if one operates on die pedal sitting on die seat, in short time de-husked rice is obtained from die outlet and husk falls through die screen/sieve plate. There may be some small amount of husk in die r'ce and similarly there be some small rice grains in the husk.<br><br><br><br>
