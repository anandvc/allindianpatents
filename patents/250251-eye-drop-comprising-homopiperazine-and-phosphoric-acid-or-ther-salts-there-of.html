				<td>FIELD   OF  THE   INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
This invention relates to a preventing or treating agent for glaucoma comprising<br>
(S)-(-)-1-(4-fluoro-5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl homopiperazine or its salt.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION [0002]<br>
In the eye, aqueous humor continuously circulates to maintain intraocular pressure at a constant level. However, when flow rate of the aqueous humor at the trabecular meshwork which is the outlet of the aqueous humor reduces, or when corner angle narrows to block the flow of the aqueous humor, intraocular pressure will be raised to press the optic nerve , and this results in the onset of glaucoma associated with abnormality in visual field, or ocular hypertension which might not be associated with such abnormal visual field but which is likely to develop into glaucoma in a long term.  In treating such glaucoma or ocular hypertension, the increased intraocular pressure should be reduced, and in the clinical practice,,sympathetic stimulants such as epinephrine, parasympathetic stimulants such as pilocarpine hydrochloride, |3 blockers such as timolol, prostaglandin analogs such as isopropyl unoprostone, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors such as dorzolamide, and the like have been used. None of these drugs, however, have proved to be sufficient in their action of reducing the intraocular pressure. [0003] <br>
Recently, other treatments have also been reported including the treatment by a combination of a p blocker, a prostaglandin analog, and a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor in order to enhance the intraocular pressure-reducing action (Non-Patent Document), and the treatment by a combination of a p blocker and alginic acid to sustain the intraocular pressure-reducing action (Patent document 1) . Another recent report disclose that a compound having Rho kinase inhibitory action has excellent preventing and treating effects for glaucoma as well as strong intraocular pressure-reducing action (Patent Document 2). [0004]<br>
Many of the glaucoma patients suffer from the type of glaucoma (normal tension glaucoma) not associated with the increase of intraocular pressure. In the case of such patients, reduction of the intraocular pressure from the normal level is required. Reducing the intraocular pressure from the normal level, however, is harder than reducing the intraocular pressure at an elevated level, and this imposed a certain limitation on the treatment of the normal tension glaucoma by the conventional drug or combination of such conventional drugs. Accordingly, there has been a demand for a drug with an enhanced intraocular pressure-reduction action.<br>

An object of the present invention is to provide a preventing or treating agent for glaucoma which has strong action<br><br>
of reducing the intraocular pressure, namely an action sufficiently strong to reduce the intraocular pressure from the normal level.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS [0006]<br>
The inventors of the present invention have made an extensive study to solve the problems as described above, and found that a strong intraocular pressure-reducing action can be realized when<br>

This invention also relates to a method for preventing or treating ocular hypertension wherein (S)-(-)-1-(4-fluoro-5-isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-methyl homopiperazine or its salt and phosphoric acid or its salt is administered. EFFECT OF THE INVENTION [0015]<br>
The preventing or treating agent for glaucoma and the like of the present invention have strong action of reducing the intraocular pressure, and the action is so strong that the intraocular pressure can be sufficiently reduced even from the<br><br>
normal level. Accordingly, use of such agent realizes significant preventing or treating effects for glaucoma or ocular hypertension in a reduced number of administration.<br>
