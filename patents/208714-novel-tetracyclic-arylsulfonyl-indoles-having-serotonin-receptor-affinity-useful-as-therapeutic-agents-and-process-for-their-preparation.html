The compounds of the general formula (I) of this invention are 5-HT (Serotonin) ligands e.g. agonists or antagonists. Thus, compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are useful for treating diseases wherein modulation of 5-HT (Serotonin) activity is desired. Specifically, the compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment and / or prophylaxis of psychosis, paraphrenia, psychotic depression, mania, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, anxiety, migraine headache, depression, drug addiction, convulsive disorders, personality disorders, hypertension, autism, post-traumatic stress syndrome, alcoholism, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorders and sleep disorders. T<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat psychotic, affective, vegetative and psychomotor symptoms of schizophrenia and the extrapyramidal motor side effects of other antipsychotic drugs.<br><br>
The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful to treat neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson’s and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting. The compounds of general formula (I) of this invention are also useful in modulation of eating behavior and thus are useful in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with excess weight. Background of the Invention<br>
Many diseases of the central nervous system are influenced by the adrenergic, the dopaminergic and the serotenergic neurotransmitter systems. Serotonin has been implicated in a number of diseases and conditions, which originate in the central nervous system, these include diseases and conditions related to sleeping, eating, perceiving pain, controlling body temperature, controlling blood pressure, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia and other bodily states. (References: Fuller, R. W., Drugs Acting on Serotonergic Neuronal Systems, Biology of Serotonergic Transmission, John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd. (1982), 221-247; Bolin D. J., Serotonin in Mental abnormalities (1978), 1, 316; Barchas J. et. al., Serotonin and Behavior (1973)). Serotonin also plays an important role in the peripheral systems, such as the gastrointestinal system, where it has been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretor and electrophysiologic effects.<br>
Due to the broad distribution of serotonin within the body, there is lot of interest and use, in the drugs that affect serotonergic systems. Particularly, preferred are the compounds which have receptor specific agonism and/or antagonism for the treatment of a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, hypertension, migraine, obesity, compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, autism, neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinsonism and Huntington's chorea and chemotherapy-induced vomiting (References: Gershon M. D. et. al.. The peripheral actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine (1989), 246; Saxena P. R. et. al., Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology (1990), supplement 7, 15).<br>
The major classes of serotonin receptors (S-The.?) contain fourteen to eighteen separate receptors that have been formally classified (References: Glennon et al, Neuroscience and Behavioral Reviews (1990), 14, 35 and Hoyer D. et al, Pharmacol. Rev, (1994), 46, 157-203). Recently discovered information regarding sub-type identity, distribution, structure and function suggests that it is possible to identify novel, sub-type specific agents having improved therapeutic profiles with lesser side effects. The 5-HTr, receptor was identified in 1993 (References: Monsma etal, Mol. Pharmacol. (1993), 43, 320-327 and Ruat M. et al, Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. (1993), 193, 269-276). Several antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics bind to the S-HTe receptor with high affinity and this binding may be a factor in their profile of activities (References: Roth et al, J. Pharm. Exp. Therapeut. (1994), 268, 1403-1410; Sleight et al, Exp. Pin. Ther. Patents (1998), 8, 1217-1224; Bourson et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 125, 1562-1566; Boess et al, Mol<br><br>
Pharmacol., 1998, 54, 577-583; Sleight et al, Brit. J. Pharmacol. (1998), 124, 556-562). In addition, 5-HT6 receptor has been linked to generalized stress and anxiety states (Reference: Yoshioka et al, Life Sciences (1998), 17/18, 1473-1477). Together these studies and observations suggest that compounds that antagonize the S-HTe receptor will be useful in treating various disorders of the central nervous system.<br>

Description 1 : N,N-Dimethyl-1-(2'-bromophenylsulfonyl)tryptamlne (D1)<br>
A suspension of potassium hydride (9.0 mmoles, 1.2 g. (30 % suspension in mineral oil), washed with THF before use), in THF was stirred and cooled at 0 - 5 'C. To this cooled solution was added a solution of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (6.0 mmoles), in THF, slowly, over 15 min., maintaining the temperature below 10 °C. After completion of addtition, the mixture was warmed to 25 - 30 °C. and maintained for 30 - 45 min. The reaction mixture was then cooled to 0 - 5 °C and solution of 2-bromobenzenesulfonyl chloride in THF (6.0 mmoles, 1.7 g. in 7 mL of THF) was then added to the above well stirred mixture, maintaining the reaction temperature below 10 °C (Exothermic reaction). The reaction mixture was maintained at 20 -25 °C for further 2 - 4 hrs. After completion of reaction (TLC), the excess of THF was distilled off and the concentrate was diluted with ice-water and extracted with ethyl acetate. Combined ethyl acetate layer was washed with water, dried over sodium sulfate and evaporated under reduced pressure, below 50 °C.<br><br>
The crude residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 30 % methanol in ethyl acetate as a mobile phase, to obtain the intermediate, N,N-Dimethyl-1-(2'-bromophenyisulfonyOtryptamine,  which was identified by IR,  NMR and  mass  spectral analyses. Description 2-55 (D2 - D55):<br>
