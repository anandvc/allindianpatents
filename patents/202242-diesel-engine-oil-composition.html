				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a diesel engine oil composition, and more particularly, to a diesel engine oil composition suitable for medium-speed diesel engines for marine use and diesel generating power plant. <br>
In marine diesel engines or diesel engines for power plant, particularly in medium-speed diesel engines, a phenomenon of sudden increase in engine oil consumption has become a issue. The sudden increase phenomenon is attributable to the conditions between rings and liners in the engines; i.e., sticking of the rings by products of engine oil degradation or poor lubrication between the rings and liners. In other words, degradation of engine oils and decrease of lubricity, particularly a decrease in wear resistance of engine oils, play a significant role in the sudden increase of oil consumption. Thus, the service life of an engine oil expires upon occurrence of the sudden increase in oil consumption. Oil consumption may be affected by degradation of specific components in the oil during use, since almost no variation is observed in oil consumption among fresh engine oils. In view that engine oils having long service lives have excellent oxidation stability and wear resistance, development of engine oils<br><br>
 which are excellent in both properties is demanded. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokal) No. 7-197067 discloses an engine oil additive comprising a specific perbasic or neutral sulfonate in combination with a specific polyalkenylsuccinimide and zinc dialkyldithiophosphate. However, the additive has poor characteristics with respect to both oxidation stability and wear resistance.<br><br>
The present invention was made in view of the foregoing, and an object of the invention is to provide a diesel engine oil composition having excellent oxidation stability and wear resistance.<br>
The present inventors have conducted earnest studies, and have  found  that  the  above  object  is  effectively attained by use of a detergent-dispersant comprising a specified perbasic alkaline earth metal compound and by regulation of the amount of specified elemental components.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides ., a diesel engine oil composition comprising a lube oil base and one or more metallic detergent-dispersants selected from among a perbasic alkaline earth metal sulfonate, phenolate, and salicylate, wherein the total phosphorus content is 100 ppm by weight or less,^preferably 70 ppm by weight or less.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a diesel engine oil composition having a total base number of 15-50 mgKOH/g.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a diesel engine oil composition wherein the sum of the total nitrogen content and the total phosphorus content is 150 ppm by weight or less.<br>
Furthermore, in a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a diesel engine oil composition having a total nitrogen content of 50 ppm by weight or less.<br><br>
Modes for carrying out the present invention will next be described.<br>
The diesel engine oil composition of the present invention may be used in a variety of engines such as marine engines and engines for diesel generating power plant, and is preferably used in a medium-speed diesel engine having a speed of 200-1500 rpm, preferably 300-1300 rpm. These diesel engines typically have a power output of 100-30,000 HP, preferably 500-20,000 HP. In these diesel engines, a lube oil may be contaminated with unused fuel, combustion residues, and sludge produced by reaction between an acidic substance derived from sulfur contained in the fuel and a metallic dispersant.  Particularly preferably, the diesel engine oil composition of the present invention is used in a diesel engine equipped with means to remove sludge, etc., such as a large-scale filter, strainer, or a centrifugal separator.<br><br>
As a lube oil base in the diesel engine oil composition of the present invention, there may be used a mineral oil and/or a synthetic oil having a kinematic<br>
viscosity at 100°C of 3-35 mm2/s, more preferably 8-25 lom2/s. When the kinematic viscosity of the base oil is excessively high, supply of the lube oil to a lubrication part is poor; whereas when kinematic viscosity is excessively low, the vapor pressure is high, resulting in a disadvantageously high rate of oil consumption. No particular limitation is imposed on the pour point, which is an index for low-temperature fluidity, and a pour point of -10°C or less is preferred. Furthermore, the total amount of nitrogen contained in the base oil is preferably 40 ppm by weight or less, more preferably 30 ppm by weight or less. When the total nitrogen content in the base oil is excessively high, sludge formation increases as a result of an increase in the degradation of the lube oil.<br>
The mineral and synthetic oils may be selected from a wide variety thereof according to use. Examples of the mineral oils include a paraffin-type mineral oil/ a naphthene-type mineral oil, and an intermediate base crude oil. Specific examples include a light neutral oil, an intermediate neutral oil, a heavy neutral oil, and a bright stock.<br>
Examples of the synthetic oils include poly-a-olefin, a-olefin copolymer, polybutene, alkylbenzene, polyol ester, a  dibasic  acid  ester,   polyoxyalkylene  glycol,   a<br><br>
polyoxyalkylene glycol ester, a polyoxyalkylene glycol ether, and a hindered ester.<br>
These oils	which serve as base oils	may be used<br>
singly or in combination of two or more species, and the mineral oil(s) and the synthetic oil(s) may be used in combination.<br>
The metallic detergent-dispersant incorporated in the lube oil base is selected from among a perbasic alkaline earth metal sulfonate, phenolate, and salicylate. Of these, a perbasic alkaline earth metal sulfonate is preferred.<br>
The detergent-dispersant preferably has a total base number of 100-600 mgKOH/g (JIS K-2501: perchlorate method), particularly 120-500 mgKOH/g. When the base number is excessively low, a large amount of the dispersant is required to obtain the effect, which is economically disadvantageous; whereas when the base number is excessively high, the ash content of the lube oil increases to invite the risk of formation of a large amount of deposit.<br>
The perbasic alkaline earth metal sulfonates, which are alkaline earth metal salts of a variety of sulfonic acids, are typically obtained through carbonation of a variety of alkaline earth metal sulfonates. Examples of the sulfonic acids include aromatic petroleum sulfonic acid, alkylsulfonic acid, arylsulfonic acid, and alkylarylsulfonic acid. Specific examples include dodecylbenzenesulfonic  acid,  dilaurylcetylbenzenesulfonic<br><br>
acid, paraffin wax-substituted benzenesulfonic acid, polyolefin-substituted benzenesulfonic acid, polyieobutylene-substituted benzenesulfonic acid, and naphthalenesulfonic acid.<br>
The perbasic alkaline earth metal phenolates, which are alkaline earth metal salts of an alkylphenol or a sulfidized alkylphenol, are typically obtained through carbonation of an alkaline earth metal salt of alkylphenol or sulfidized alkylphenol.<br>
The perbasic alkaline earth metal salicylates, which are alkaline earth metal salts of an alkylsalicylic acid, are typically obtained by the following steps: alkylation of phenol with C8-C18 a-olefin, introduction of a carboxyl group by Kolbe-Schmitt reaction, double-decomposition, and carbonization. Examples of the alkylsalicylic acids include dodecylsalicylic acid, dodecylmethylsalicylic acid, tetradecylsalicylic acid, hexadecylsalicylic acid, octadecylsalicylic acid, and dioctylsalicylic acid.<br>
Examples of the alkaline earth metal of the above-mentioned alkaline earth metal sulfonates, phenolates, and salicylates include calcium, barium, and magnesium, with calcium being preferred in view of effect.<br>
In the present invention, the above-described metallic detergent-dispersant may be used singly or in combination of two or more species. It is preferably incorporated in an amount of 5-40% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, more preferably 10-30% by<br><br>
weignt. when the amount of the metallic detergent-dispersant is 5% by weight or less, poor wear resistance and oxidation stability result, whereas when the amount is in excess of 40% by weight, there may not be obtained an effect commensurate with the amount of incorporated detergent-dispersant.<br>
The total phosphorus content in the diesel engine oil composition of the present invention is 100 ppm by weight or less, preferably 70 ppm by weight or less, particularly preferably 30 ppra by weight or less. When the total phosphorus content is excessively high, an acidic substance in the lube oil increases in amount to result in easy sludge formation during the step of oxidation-induced degradation.<br>
The total base number of the diesel engine oil composition of the present invention must be adjusted to 15-50 mgKOH/g (JIS K-2501: perchlorate method), preferably 20-40 mgKOH/g, in consideration of poor neutralization ability to an acid at excessively low values and a large amount of deposit formation at excessively high values.<br>
The sum of the total nitrogen content and the total phosphorus content of the diesel engine oil composition of the present invention is preferably adjusted to 150 ppm by weight or less, more preferably 90 ppm by weight or less, particularly preferably 70 ppm by weight or less. Too great a sum may result in easy sludge formation during the step of oxidation-induced degradation.<br><br>
Moreover, the total nitrogen content of the diesel engine oil composition of the present invention is preferably adjusted to 50 ppm by weight or less, more preferably 30 ppm by weight or less. An excessively high nitrogen content may result in easy sludge formation during the step of oxidation-induced degradation.<br>
The composition of the present invention is obtained by incorporating the above-described metallic detergent-dispersant into a lube oil base. Generally, the composition may further contain additives such as an antioxidant, a viscosity index improver, a metal deactivator, a pour point depressant, an anti-wear agent, a defoaming agent, or an extreme pressure agent, in order to maintain essential characteristics of the lube oil. No particular limitation is imposed on the additives, and a wide variety of conventionally known additives may be used. Examples of the antioxidant, which may be used in an amount of 0.05-2% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include an amine such as alkylated diphenylamine or phenyl-a-naphthylamine, and a phenolic compound such as 2,6-di-t-butylphenol or 4,4"-methylenebis{2,6-di-t-butylphenol). Examples of the viscosity index improver, which may be used in an amount of 0,5-30% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include poly(methyl methacrylate} , polyisobutylene, ethylene-propylene copolymer, styrene-isoprene  copolymer,  and  hydrogenated  styrene-butadiene<br><br>
copolymer. Examples of the metal deactivator, which may be used in an amount of 0.005-1% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include benzotriazole, thiadiazole, and an alkenylsuccinate ester. Examples of the pour point depressant, which may be used in an amount of 0.01-1% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include poly(alkyl methacrylate) and polyalkylstryene. Examples of the anti-wear agent, which may be used in an. amount of 0.1-3% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include an organic molybdenum compound such as MoDTP or MoDTC; an organic zinc compound such as ZnDTP; an organic boron compound such as alkylmercaptyl borate; graphite; molybdenum disulfide; antimony sulfide; a boron compound; and polytetrafluoroethylene. Examples of the defoaming agent, which may be used in an amount of 0.0005-1% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include dimethylpolysiloxane and polyacrylate. Examples of the extreme pressure agent, which may be used in an amount of 0.1-15% by weight based on the total amount of the composition, include sulfidized fat and diallyl disulfide. When the above-described additives are compounds that contain nitrogen or phosphorus, the total amount of nitrogen and/or phosphorus in the above-described lube oil composition should be regulated in consideration of these components in the additives.<br>
