Technical Held<br>
The present invention relates to a textile ring spinning and twisting machine having<br>
independent drafting zones and corresponding independent zonal-drive systems. The<br>
present invention particularly relates to a textile ring spinning and twisting machine having<br>
independendy controlled drafting and spindle drive zones for selective start and stop<br>
operations.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
Ring spinning machines are used for the production of yam from the roving fed. Normally<br>
the ring spinning machine comprises spindle rails to carry predetermined number of<br>
spindles arranged at predetermined pitch arranged on both side of the machine. The conical<br>
tubes on which the yam is wound are fitted to the spindles and driven by suitable drive<br>
means. Ring rails arranged coaxial to the spindle rail and carries spinning ring and traveler<br>
assembly of same number and pitch as that of spindle. The ring rails further provided with<br>
means for travel up and down in a direction transverse to the spindle axis for the built up of<br>
yarn on to the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles.<br>
The plurality of spindles is driven by a common drive shaft arranged to the full length of<br>
the machine with associated drive elements. The drafting arrangement and the spindles are<br>
arranged on both the sides of the ring spinning and the twisting machine. Generally, in ring<br>
spinning and twisting machines the spindles, drafting rollers and the up and down<br>
movement of the ring rail are derived from a common drive motor through suitable<br>
gearing. Likewise tlie ring rail is driven by a drive system with the associated drive<br>
elements.<br>
Roving bobbins of equal number as that of the spindles are arranged in a creel member<br>
attached to the ring spinning machine for the introduction of roving into the drafting<br>
arrangement through suitable guide means for drafting. The drafted roving is subsequently<br>
wound on the conical tubes attached to the revolving spindles by the ring and ring traveler<br>
assembly in the form of yarn and the cop built up takes place.<br>
The drafting arrangement essentially comprises rear, middle and front bottom drafting<br>
rollers with associated top rollers, the top rollers being held on the bottom drafting   rollers<br><br>
under pressure applied by the loading arrangement of the drafting system. Middle drafting roller and the middle top roller provided with apron arrangement for effective guidance of the fibre material in the drafting zone. The drafting rollers are driven at differential speed by the drafting roller drive system and the fibre material is drafted as per the requirement. Modern ring spinning machines are constructed vv-ith spindles of 1200 and above. The machine is constructed in sections and all such sections are coupled together by suitable means for the driving of the drive elements. In the known Ring spinning machines the drive arrangement for the running of the drafting rollers comprising drive motor with associated drive elements arranged at one end of the machine, which drives the drafting rollers arranged on both sides of the machine.<br>
In long ring spinning machines, which are constructed with more number of spindles per side for example more than 500 spindles, the drive force required by the drafting rollers at the opposite end of the drive arrangement is not adequate, especially while processing syntheric materials. To over come the problem cited above, in some of the machines drive to the drafting rollers is arranged on both ends of the machine.<br>
Generally, the ring spinning machines are taken up for maintenance once in 15 to 45 days depending upon the factors like raw material, yarn count processed and age of the machines. Generally, machines are stopped for duration of about 1.5 hours to 3 hours for cleaning and maintenance. In order to perform the maintenance at a particular zone or area of the machine, it is necessary to stop the entire machine as a result of the drive arrangement as described above. As a result of the frequent stoppage of the machine, the optimal working efficiency of the ring spinning and twisting machine stands reduced. The present invention uses independent variable speed motor for the ring rail movement as disclosed in the co-pending application 305/CHE/20a4 of the present applicant. In such an arrangement, the balance weights, which are used in the conventional ring spinning and twisting machines are eliminated. In the absence of the balance weight, the ring rail can be easily removed and fixed during the cleaning cycle. Objects of the invention<br>
The primary object of the present invention is to provide a texule ring spinning and twisting machine with independent drafting zones for providing dedicated drive to the drafting rollers in a selected zone.<br><br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a textile ring spinning and twisting machine with a means to provide adequate drive force to the drafting rollers by arranging drive systems in independent zones on both sides of the machine.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a textile ring spinning and twisting machine having functional means for a selective de-energising of drafting rollers in a pre¬selected drafting zone for performing maintenance work of that zone and while allowing other zones to continue to function.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a textile ring spinning and twisting machine with spindle drive zones for selectively engaging and disengaging the spindle drive in a pre-selected zone, to facilitate stopping and restarting of the spindle drive of that zone.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a textile ring spinning and twisting machine with zone-wise control for feeding roving of different hank and to produce yarn of same count in the different drafting zones.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a textile ring spinning and twisting machine with a zone-wise control not only for feeding roving of different hank to different drafting zones but also a different yarn count can be processed in the different drafting zones.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a textile ring spitming and twisting machine<br>
with independent drafting and spindle zones. The subject matter of the present invention is<br>
now described in detail, initially by referring to the accompanied diagrams.<br>
Fig 1, which illustrates a basic control system of the ring spinning and twisting machine of<br>
the present invention with independently driven multiple drafting zones. The textile ring<br>
spinning and twisting machine of the present invention comprises an input member (1),<br>
which can be selected from any known Man Machine hiterface (MMI), for providing input<br>
of data. The input data generally includes data pertaining to the desired instructions that are<br>
necessary to run the machine as per the user requirements. The input data that are required<br>
to be input among other things include the rotational speed of the drafting roller drive<br>
motor corresponding to different process parameters such as the material being processed<br>
and yam count produced. The input data also include speed of the spindles corresponding<br>
to different process parameters such as the material being processed and yam count<br>
produced and the speed of the spindle during different stage of the cop built up. The input<br>
may also include program for the control of the up and down movement of the ring rail.<br>
A programmable logic control means (PLC) (2), is disposed to receive the input data from<br><br>
the user via the input member (1). The Programmable Logic Control means is a device with an instruction set to perform pre-determined tasks as per the user requirements. The input member (1) is also used to program the programmable logic control means (2). A pair of variable speed drives (3A &amp; 3B), is in instructive communication with the programmable logic control means (2). The variable speed drives used in the present invention are selected from any known devices such as an inverter or a servo drive or any suitable device to receive energising and de-energising instructions from the PLC. The variable speed drives are used to drive the spindles and drafting rollers at different speeds considering the facts such as the material to be processed, count spun etc. The variable speed drive (3A) is in turn connected to motors (MIA &amp; M2A). The motors that are adopted in the present invention to provide drive to the moving parts of machine are AC asynchronous motors, DC motors or servo motors to receive energising and de-energising instructions from the PLC. The variable speed drive (3B) is in turn connected to a pair of motors(IVIlB &amp; M2B), which are of the same type as motors (MIA &amp; M2A).The pair of motors (MIA &amp; M2A) is disposed at the off-end (OE) and whereas the motors(MlB &amp;M2B) are arranged at the Drive-end (DE) of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the drafting roller drives are divided into four different and independent zones designated as Dl, D2, D3 and D4. The drafting rollers (as shown in Fig 2) of the individual four zones Dl, D2, D3 and D4 are driven and controlled by respective motors. The motor (MIA) disposed at the off-end drives the first drafting zone (Dl), the second motor (M2A) disposed at the off-end drives the second drafting zone (D2), the third motor (MIB) disposed at the drive-end drives the diird drafting zone (D3) and the fourth motor (M2B) disposed at the drive-end drives the fourth drafting zone (D4). The motors (MIA, M2A, MIB and M2B), which form part of the drafting roller drive system, provide independent drive to the drafting roller zones, with which they are functionally connected.<br>
The motors (MIA, M2A, MIB and M2B) receive the input power or energy or drive ftom the corresponding variable speed drive (3A and 3B). The motors (MIA and M2A) receive the input power or drive fi'om the variable speed drive (3A). The motors (MIB and M2B) receive the input power or drive from the variable speed drive (3B).<br><br>
The variable speed drive (3A and 3B), are in turn connected to the programmable logic control means (PLC) (2). The Programmable Logic Control means (PLC) (2) provides instructions to either stop or start the motors connected to the drafting rollers of any one of the drafting zones (Dl, D2, D3 &amp; D4) in a scheduled maimer. It is also within the purview of this invention, to stop or start any of the motors connected to the drafting rollers of any one of the drafting zones (Dl, D2, D3 &amp; D4) selectively.<br>
The motors (MIA, M2A, MIB and M2B) are selectively energized by variable speed drive (3A and 3B), which are coupled to PLC (2). In addition to the variable speed drive (3A and 3B), an additional independent variable speed drive (4) of the type 3A and 3B is disposed in functional connectivity with PLC (2) to selectively energize an independent motor (M3) which are generally AC asynchronous motors, DC motors or servo motors. The drafting arrangement of one of the drafting zones (Dl) driven by the motor (MIA) is now described by referring to Fig 2, of the accompanied diagrams. However, the same explanation is equally applicable to the other drafting zones as mentioned above. A pulley (7) is mounted on the shaft of the motor (MIA), which in turn drives another pulley (8) mounted on the shaft (10) through a belt (9). A gear wheel (11), which is attached to the other end of the shaft (10) drives the gear wheel (12) mounted on one end of the front drafting roller (14) via an intermediated gear (13). Another gear wheel (15) is mounted on the other end of the front drafting roller (14) and this gear wheel (15) drives another connected gear wheel (16) mounted on shaft (17). Yet another gear wheel (18) mounted on the other end of shaft (17) drives another gear wheel (19) mounted on shaft (20). Yet another gear wheel (21) mounted on the other end of shaft (20) drives gear wheel (22) which is mounted on shaft (24) via intermediate gear (23). Another gear wheel (25) mounted on the other end of shaft (24) drives gear wheel (26) mounted on rear drafting roller (28) via an intermediate gear (27). Yet another gear wheel (29) which is also mounted on the shaft (24) drives gear wheel (30) mounted on middle drafting roller (32) through an intermediate gear (31). The cumulative drive arrangement of these gear drives provides the necessary drive to the drafting rollers of a particular selected drafting roller<br>
zone.<br>
Now by referring to Fig 3, which illustrates the drive arrangement for the drafting rollers<br>
and spindles of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine of the present invention,<br><br>
wherein the spindles arranged adjacent to the off-end (OE) of the machine are driven by spindle drive shaft (33) and the spindles arranged adjacent to the drive-end (DE) of the machine is driven by yet another spindle drive shaft (34), thereby creating an independent spindle drive zones. The spindle drive shafts (33) and (34) are driven by one of the known drive means by the drive motor (M3) arranged at the otT-end (OE) of the textile ring spinning and twisting machine.The icnown drive means include a motor through a variable speed drive arrangement or a variable speed motor. The spindle drive shafts (33) and (34) of the spindle zones, are coupled together by a coupling mechanism (6) for selectively driving either both the spindle drive shafts (33) and (34) or only the spindle drive shaft (33) located adjacent to the off-end (OE). The coupling mechanism (6) adopted in the present invention is any known coupling mechanism like an electromagnetic clutch, electro pneumatic clutch for selective engagement.<br>
The independent variable speed drive (4), which is controlled by the programmable logic control means (PLC) (2), supplies power to the independent motor (M3). The independent motor (M3) in turn drives the spindle drive shafts (33, 34), which are coupled by the coupling means (6).<br>
Now again referring to Fig 1, the coupling (6) is connected to the programmable logic control (PLC) (2). The coupling (6) may be engaged or disengaged as and when required by the command from the PLC (2) or it can be pre programmed. By selectively disengaging the coupling (6) the drive shaft (34), which drives the spindles attached to the drive-end (DE), can be slopped.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, motor (M3) is energized by the variable speed drive (4) which is coupled to the programmable logic control (2). The variable speed drive (4) and the variable speed drive (3A and 3B) which are attached to the motors (MIA, IVI2A, MIB, M2B and M3) are connected to a DC bus (5) to synchronize the variable speed drives during power failure. In other words, in the event of power failure the variable speed drives will function on the power supply provided by the DC bus (5). The present invention provides a textile ring spinning and twisting machine with independently driven muhiple drafting zones and selectively engaging sectional spindle drive arrangement. By virtue of this arrangement in addition to stopping of the drafting<br><br>
zone drive elements located at the drive end of the machine, the spindles located at the drive end can also be stopped. This enables stopping of the drafting arrangement drive elements and spindle drive elements of half of the machine adjacent to the drive-end and half portion of the machine can be taken up for cleaning and maintenance. During this period the drafting zone drive elements adjacent to the off-end (OE) of the machine as well as the spindle drive shaft which drives the spindles arranged adjacent to the off-end (OE) of the machine can continue to work, which faciUtates the uninterrupted working of half of the machine.<br>
In another embodiment. the coupling mechanism which connects the spindle drive shafts (33,34) is eliminated and the drive shaft (34) is driven by yet another independent variable speed motor with associated drive elements. The said variable speed motors are cormected to the independent variable speed drive (4) . In this case the variable speed motors which drives the spindle drive shafts (33,34) receive the input power from the independent variable speed drive (4) , which is in instructive communication with the Programmable Logic Control (PLC) (2). The PLC inputs the command to the independent variable speed drive (4) either to stop/start any one or both the variable speed motor which drives the spindle drive shafts (33,34), in a programmed manner . It is also within the scope of this invention to stop/start any one or both the variable speed motor which drives the spindle drive shafts (33,34) selectively.<br>
By eliminating the coupling member which connects the spindle drive shafts and by using independent variable speed motors to drive the spindle drive shafts, stopping of the drafting arrangement drive and its drive elements and spindle drive elements of any half portion of the machine is achieved to perform maintenance operation in that stopped zone. The cleaning, resetting of the drafting roller of the particular zone is carried and the drive motor is re-started. At a pre-determined and programmed interval the other drive motor of the remaining zones is stopped one after the other to carry out the cleaning, re setting and other work related to the drafting zone.<br>
In accordance with the ring spinning and twisting machine of the present invention, having means for driving the drafting zones elements using dedicated drives, it is possible to feed different hank of roving produced by different roving frames and to produce uniform yam count on the different drafting zones. Alternatively different hank of roving can be feed to<br><br>
different drafting zones and different yarn count can be processed in the different drafting<br>
zones.<br>
For instance, in the event of stopping of any one of the drafting zones for the maintenance,<br>
selective stopping of the drafting zones along with the spindle drive elements can be<br>
scheduled and pre-programmed by means of the input member (1) attached to the<br>
programmable logic control means (2).<br>
A drafting zone/spindle shaft of the ring spinning and twisting machine of the present<br>
invention, which has been configured to stop temporarily, is also enabled to restart after<br>
the lapse of the programmed time period. However, safety devices including signal lamps,<br>
audio alarm or any other suitable warning devices can be provided to alert the user, well in<br>
advance, to indicate that the drafting zone drive/spindle drive shaft is about to restart.<br>
In the machine of the present invention the spindles are driven by an independent variable<br>
speed motor, the drafting rollers by a plurality  of variable speed motors and the ring rail<br>
by an yet another independent variable speed motor.<br>
Functional aspects of the ring spinning and twisting machine of the present invention are<br>
further explained by referring to FIG 4 of the accompanied diagrams.<br>
When the machine is switched 'ON' , the motor which drives the spindles, generally<br>
known as the  main  motor starts functioning.  It is  found  in experience that it is<br>
advantageous to start the drive motors which drive the drafting rollers after a pre<br>
determined lapse of time, which is known as delay drafting time.  Soon after the elapse of<br>
the delay drafting time the drafting motors which are in drive engaged mode get started .<br>
On the other hand the drafting drive motors which are in drive disengaged mode do not<br>
start.The mode of the drafting  drive motors are pre programmed in accordance with the<br>
cleaning schedule or it can be done selectively also.<br>
The mode of coupling member through which the spindle drive shafts are coupled together<br>
is verified (not illustrated in the flow chart). If the coupling member is in 'enabled' status,<br>
the coupling member is engaged and the spindle drive shaft at the drive end of the machine<br>
is driven by the spindle drive motor in addition to the spindle drive shaft at offend of the<br>
machine . On the other hand if the coupling member is in 'disabled' status the coupling<br>
member is disengaged and the spindle drive shaft at the off end of the machine alone is<br>
driven by the spindle drive    motor. The mode of the coupling member can be pre<br><br>
programmed in accordance with the cleaning schedule. Also it is possible to engage and disengage the coupling selectively.<br>
Advantages<br>
1. The textile ring spinning and twisting machine of the present invention increases the efficiency of the machine as only selected drafting zone of the machine is stopped for cleaning and setting while production is continued in other zones.<br>
2	The textile ring spirming and twisting machine of the present invention provides facility<br>
to stop and restart the drafting zones selectively or by programming<br>
3	The textile ring spinning and twisting machine of the present invention provides a<br>
