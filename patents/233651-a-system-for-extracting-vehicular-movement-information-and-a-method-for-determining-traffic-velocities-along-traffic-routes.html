STATEMENT OF RELATED PATENT APPLICATIONS<br>
This non-provisional patent application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. § 119<br>
to U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/318,858, titled System and Method for<br>
Providing Traffic Information Using Operational Data at a Wireless Network, filed<br>
September 13, 2001. This provisional application is hereby fully incorporated herein<br>
by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a system and method for providing traffic<br>
information. More particularly, this invention relates to using operational data<br>
developed by a wireless telephony communication network to generate traffic<br>
information.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Traffic congestion has reached crisis levels in most major cities throughout<br>
the U.S. and is becoming a major problem in smaller cities and rural areas as well.<br>
Not only is traffic congestion a source of frustration for commuters, this congestion is<br>
also costly and a significant contributor to air pollution. The Texas Transportation<br>
Institute's 2001 Urban Mobility Report estimates that the total congestion costs for 68<br>
U.S. urban areas from New York City down to those cities with populations of<br>
100,000 is $78 billion, which was the value of 4.5 billion hours of delay and 6.8<br>
billion gallons of excess fuel consumed. From 1982 to 1999, the time that travelers<br>
wasted in traffic increased from 12 hours to 36 hours per year.<br>
Research has shown that meaningful travel information can reduce commute<br>
times by 13% and demand for traffic data is growing exponentially. A recent Gallup<br>
study showed that nearly 30% of all commuters and through travelers are willing to<br>
pay $1 to $5 per use and nearly 50% of commercial vehicle operators are willing to<br>
pay $10 per month; however, the data is simply not available.<br>
Currently, transportation agencies collect highway traffic data from radar<br>
devices, video cameras, roadside sensors, and other hardware requiring expensive<br>
field installation and maintenance. Transportation agencies currently spend more<br>
than $1 billion per year for traffic monitoring systems covering less than 10% of our<br>
national highway system. Data is delivered to a Traffic Management Center (TMC)<br>
via high-speed fiber-optic communications where it is organized, analyzed, and then<br>
delivered to the public by overhead or roadside message boards, Department of<br>
Transportation Web sites, and through partnerships with radio, television, and other<br>
media outlets. This hardware-oriented field equipment approach to collecting traffic<br>
data and providing information is costly and is practical in select urban areas only.<br>
An emerging concept is the idea of using a Global Positioning System (GPS)<br>
device to determine a series of positions of mobile communication devises and<br>
transmit these data via a wireless network to a central computer processor. The<br>
processor can then calculate the speed and direction of the device for use in<br>
determining traffic flow. While this approach can give very accurate information for<br>
a small number of devices, any attempt to gather positioning information from a large<br>
number of devices will use up large amounts of scarce bandwidth from the wireless<br>
network and prove to be very costly. Additionally, GPS data is not available for most<br>
of the wireless networks operating today. Although some nationwide trucking<br>
companies have GPS location devices in their trucks, these vehicles represent a small<br>
fraction of the number of vehicles using the roadways.<br>
While most wireless telephony networks do not have GPS data capabilities,<br>
they do have a vast infrastructure of communication facilities. These facilities<br>
generate data routinely to enable the system to properly function, e.g., to enable<br>
cellular phone users to place and receive calls and stay connected to these calls as<br>
they move though the cell sectors of a system. Examples of these data include call<br>
detail records (CDR), handover messages, and registration messages.<br>
In September of 1999, the FCC ordered wireless carriers to begin selling and<br>
activating phones that could be located to within 100 meters in the event of a 911 call.<br>
This requirement is referred to as Enhanced or Phase II 911. Phase II 911 is not<br>
expected to be fully implemented until 2005. This system uses GPS or signal<br>
characteristics to locate the cellular phone. Regardless of the process used, limited<br>
network capacity makes it impractical to monitor traffic using this capability as the<br>
primary source of location data.<br>
In view of the foregoing, there is a need for a traffic information system that is<br>
capable of using existing data types generated routinely by wireless telephony<br>
communication networks that can be extracted from the wireless network's<br>
infrastructure without adversely affecting the performance of the wireless system or<br>
taxing the networks' resources.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes the deficiencies of other systems and<br>
methods for providing traffic information by using operational data extracted from<br>
existing wireless telephony communication network infrastructure without adversely<br>
impacting network resources.<br>
A wireless telephony communications network consists of base stations or cell<br>
towers that communicate with mobile phones and other wireless communications<br>
devices using licensed radio frequencies. When a mobile phone is powered on it<br>
periodically registers its location with the network so that calls can be processed<br>
without delay. Additionally, the mobile phone is in contact with the wireless network<br>
when the phone makes or receives phone calls.<br>
The present invention uses location information from the network, combined<br>
with computerized street maps, to measure the time it takes to get from one<br>
geographic location to another. By aggregating and analyzing anonymous data from<br>
thousands of wireless communications devices, the present invention is able to<br>
determine real-time and historical travel times and velocities between cities,,<br>
intersections and along specific routes.<br>
The aspects of the present invention may be more clearly understood and<br>
appreciated from a review of the following detailed description of the disclosed<br>
embodiments and by reference to the drawings and claims.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a system and<br>
method for using operational data from existing wireless telephony communications<br>
networks to estimate traffic movement throughout a traffic system. Figure 1 presents<br>
the wireless telephony communications network operating environment for an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the Traffic Information System 100.<br>
Mobile station (MS) 105 transmits signals to and receives signals from the<br>
radiofrequency transmission tower 110 while within a geographic cell covered by the<br>
tower. These cells vary in size based on anticipated signal volume. A Base<br>
Transceiver System (BTS) 115 is used to provide service to mobile subscribers within<br>
its cell. Several Base Transceiver Systems are combined and controlled by a Base<br>
Station Controller (BSC) 120 through a connection called the Abis Interface. The<br>
Traffic Information System 100 can interface with the Abis Interface line. A Mobile<br>
Switching Center (MSC) 125 does the complex task of coordinating all the Base<br>
Station Controllers, through the A Interface connection, keeping track of all active<br>
mobile subscribers using the Visitor Location Register (VLR) 140, maintaining the<br>
home subscriber records using the Home Location Register (HLR) 130, and<br>
connecting the mobile subscribers to the Public Service Telephone Network (PSTN)<br>
145.<br>
In an Enhanced or Phase II 911 system, the location of a mobile station 105<br>
can be determined by embedding a GPS chip in the mobile station 105, or by<br>
measuring certain signaling characteristics between the mobile station 105 and the<br>
BTS 115. In either scenario, the process of locating a mobile station 105 with the<br>
degree of accuracy needed for the Enhanced or Phase II 911 system is managed with<br>
a Mobile Positioning System (MPS) 135. The MPS 135 uses the same network<br>
resources that are used to manage and process calls, which makes its availability<br>
somewhat limited.<br>
The Input Output Gateway (IOG) 150 processes call detail records (CDRs) to<br>
facilitate such actions as mobile subscriber billing. The IOG 150 receives call-related<br>
data from the MSC 125 and can interface with the Traffic Information System 100.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention shown in Figure 1, the<br>
Traffic Information System 100 may receive data from a variety of locations in the<br>
wireless network. These locations include the BSC 120 and its interface, through the<br>
Abis Interface, with the BTS 115, MSC 125, the HLR 130, and the MPS 135.<br>
The input communications processes monitor the wireless service provider's<br>
network elements and extract the relevant information from selected, fields of selected<br>
records. The Traffic Information System 100 can use data from any network element<br>
that contains at a minimum the mobile station identifier number, cell ID and a time<br>
stamp. Some of the more common data sources are discussed below.<br>
CDRs may be requested from billing distribution centers or the distribution<br>
centers may autonomously send the records via file transfer protocol (FTP).<br>
Alternatively the CDRs may be extracted as they are routinely passed from the IOG<br>
150 to a billing gateway, possibly utilizing a router that duplicates the packets. The<br>
specific method used will depend on the equipment and preferences of the wireless<br>
service provider.<br>
Handover and Registration messages may be obtained by monitoring the<br>
proprietary or standard A-interface signaling between the MSC 125 and the BSCs 120<br>
that it controls. The Traffic Information System 100 may monitor that signaling<br>
directly or it may obtain signaling information from a signal monitoring system such<br>
as a protocol analyzer. In the latter case the signaling information may already be<br>
filtered to remove extraneous information (see Figure 7 for a discussion of the<br>
Privacy process for the exemplary embodiment of the present invention).<br>
Alternatively, these messages may be extracted from a Base Station Manager that<br>
continuously monitors message streams on the BTS 115.<br>
Turning to Figure 2a, in an exemplary embodiment, an existing wireless<br>
telephony communications network 220, otherwise referred to as a Wireless Network,<br>
exchanges information with Data Extraction Modules 240 of the Traffic Information<br>
System 100. The Data Extraction (DEX) Modules 240 exchange information with<br>
Data Analysis Nodes (DAN) 260, which in turn exchanges information to end users<br>
280 of the traffic information. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention,<br>
the DEX Modules could exchange information directly with End Users 280. In still<br>
another alternative embodiment of the present invention, a process other than DEX<br>
Module 240 may supply movement vectors to the DAN Module 260 for analysis for<br>
an end user 280. The end users 280 may include the departments of transportation,<br>
media outlets, private transportation companies, or information service providers.<br>
Details on the types of information exchanged between the modules are discussed<br>
below.<br>
Figure 2b presents an overview of the traffic information system process 200<br>
for an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The DEX Module 240<br>
interacts with the Wireless Network 220 to extract vehicular movement information<br>
from operational data on wireless communication devices. In step 241, the DEX<br>
Module 240 polls the Wireless Network 220 at preset time intervals to identify flat<br>
files and FTP files containing operational data, including location movement data,<br>
created by the Wireless Network 220 since the last polling. Independent of, and<br>
parallel to, this polling step, step 242 continuously receives operations data files that<br>
include location movement data from Wireless Network 220. In step 243, the DEX<br>
Module requests mobile station location data from the MPS on the Wireless Network<br>
220 in response from a request from the DAN Module 260. At step 244, the data files<br>
received from the Wireless Network 220 are sent to parsers configured to receive<br>
each specific data file type. The parsers extract data for the Privacy and Movement<br>
Filtering and Detection modules. In step 245, the parsed data records are sent to the<br>
Privacy module.<br>
In step 247 of the exemplary embodiment, the Privacy module acts on the<br>
parsed data, removing any personal identifying information about the mobile station<br>
associated with the data record. The process assigns a unique serial number, or<br>
otherwise referred to as a unique identifier number, to the record, replacing the<br>
mobile station identifier number. Additionally, if the record is associated with a<br>
phone call and the number dialed is included in the parsed data record, the call is<br>
categorized. Categories may include emergency calls (911), traveler information<br>
calls (511), operator assistance calls (411), or other calls. In step 248, the cleansed<br>
data records are sent to the Movement Filtering and Detection module.<br>
In step 249, the Movement Filtering and Detection module creates a<br>
movement record associated with each unique serial number contained in the data<br>
records. These movement records are then stored in a Movement Record Hashtable<br>
and serve as the output of the DEX Module 240.<br>
In step 246, the Configuration and Monitoring module constantly monitors<br>
operations of the other DEX Module components. If operations are outside a preset<br>
range of expected operations, then an e-mail or other type of alert is sent to a system<br>
administrator. Also, reports on configuration and operation status can be sent to the<br>
system administrator. This administrator can also access the DEX Module 240 and<br>
modify the configuration parameters.<br>
In this exemplary embodiment, the DAN Module 260 analyzes movement<br>
records from the DEX Module 240 to estimate traffic velocities along predetermined<br>
travel routes. In step 261, the DAN Module 260 receives cell sector coverage maps<br>
from the Wireless Network 220 and roadway maps from the transportation<br>
department or commercial vendor. These maps are received periodically, whenever<br>
they have been updated. In step 262, these maps are used by the DAN Configuration<br>
Module, or otherwise referred to as the analysis configuration module, to generate<br>
cell sector/roadway overlay maps. The overlay maps identify which road segments<br>
are contained in which cell sectors. From these maps, all possible traffic routes<br>
between cell sectors are identified and stored in a Route Database and the route<br>
velocities and standard deviations are initialized.<br>
In step 263, the Traffic Modeler receives the cell sector/roadway overlay maps<br>
from the DAN Configuration Module and movement records from the DEX Module<br>
240. In step 264, the Traffic Modeler determines the traffic route traveled by<br>
individual mobile stations associated with the movement record and the velocity of<br>
the mobile station along that route. The Route Database is updated with the new<br>
route velocity information.<br>
In step 265 (for Wireless Networks 220 with MPS capabilities), the MPS<br>
Determination module monitors the Traffic Modeler. The MPS Determination<br>
module evaluates the statistical quality of the data used by the Traffic Modeler. If the<br>
Traffic Modeler velocity estimates are based on a number of data records less than a<br>
threshold value needed to meet statistical quality requirements, then the MPS<br>
Determination module requests mobile station location data from the MPS on the<br>
Wireless Network 220 through the DEX Module 240. These data are then processed<br>
as any other data in the DEX Module 240.<br>
Figure 3 presents alternative embodiments of the relationship between the<br>
Data Extraction Module 240 and Data Analysis Node 260. In one embodiment 300,<br>
shown in Figure 3a, a single Data Extraction Module 240a may be paired with a<br>
single Data Analysis Node 260a. As shown in an embodiment 310 in Figure 3b,<br>
multiple Data Extraction Modules 240a, b, and c can exchange information with a<br>
single Data Analysis Node 260a. For example, Data Extraction Modules located at<br>
different wireless network operators in a metropolitan area can exchange information<br>
with a single Data Analysis Node that processes the traffic information for the entire<br>
metropolitan area. Figure 3 c depicts the alternative embodiment 320 in which a<br>
single Data Extraction Module 240a exchange information with multiple Data<br>
Analysis Nodes 260a, b, and c. For example, a Data Extraction Module at a wireless<br>
service provider can exchange information with Data Analysis Nodes located at<br>
unique end users. Figure 3d depicts the alternative embodiment 330 in which<br>
multiple Data Extraction Modules 240a, b, and c exchange information with multiple<br>
Data Analysis Nodes 260a, b, and c. For example, Data Extraction Modules at<br>
multiple wireless service providers can exchange information with Data Analysis<br>
Nodes located at unique end users.<br>
Figure 4 presents a process-level block diagram of an exemplary DEX<br>
Module 240. A Data Input and Processing module 442 exchanges information with<br>
the Wireless Network 220. Data received from the Wireless Network 220 is sent<br>
through a Privacy module 444, where personal identifying data about the network<br>
subscriber are removed. Data Input and Processing module 442 and Privacy module<br>
444 comprise the Processor Module 441. The cleansed data are then sent to a<br>
Movement Filtering and Detection module 446. The In the exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention, this module converts the cleansed wireless network data to<br>
movement records associated with a mobile station. The movement records are sent<br>
to the Data Analysis Node 260 through a HTTP Query Interface 450. The HTTP<br>
Query Interface 450 also sends information queries through the Data Input and<br>
Processing module 442 to the Wireless Network 220. A Configuration and<br>
Monitoring component 448 provides the means to monitor the performance of the<br>
Traffic Information System and set system operating parameters.<br>
Figure 5 highlights a Data Input and Processing module 442 of the exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. A Data Input and Processing module 442<br>
exchanges data with a Wireless Network 220. A Data Input and Processing module<br>
442 includes file interfaces. These interfaces may be specific for a certain file type.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment depicted in Figure 5, a Data Input and Processing<br>
module 442 includes a Flat File Interface 542 and an FTP File Interface 544. These<br>
interfaces can poll a Wireless Network 220, each polling the network component that<br>
contains the specific file type, data files on a local storage drive (flat files) and files at<br>
an FTP server (FTP files) in this exemplary embodiment.<br>
Additionally, a Wireless Network 220 may send a continuous stream of data<br>
to an Other Continuous File Interface 546, i.e., a Data Input and Processing module<br>
442 does not need to poll this data source. These data are taken from a BSC 522,<br>
MSC and VLR 524, and HLR 526 and may include call detail records, handover<br>
messages, and registration messages. One skilled in the art will appreciate that a Data<br>
Input and Processing module 442 can be configured to collect information in<br>
whatever form a Wireless Network 220 generates.<br>
In the exemplary embodiment, a Data Input and Processing module 442 is<br>
also capable of receiving positioning data from Wireless Network 220 that include a<br>
mobile positioning system. An MPS Interface 548 interacts directly with an MPS<br>
Gateway 528 to request specific mobile station location data, based on a request from<br>
a Data Analysis Node 260 delivered through an HTTP Query Interface 450. The<br>
MPS Interface 548 delivers the mobile station location data directly to the Parsing<br>
Engine 550. Details on this request are provided later in this description, in<br>
connection with Figure 18. Also discussed with respect to Figures 11-14 is the use of<br>
cell sector coverage maps 530 by the Data Analysis Nodes 260.<br>
The file interfaces in a Data Input and Processing module 442 send the data to<br>
a working directory. Files in the working directory cause events to be generated and<br>
sent to a Parsing Engine 550 for processing. The message contains the file name of<br>
the data file to be parsed. From this name, the most appropriate parser syntax is<br>
selected and the file is parsed. The program directory for the exemplary embodiment<br>
of the present invention contains a parser's subdirectory. Jar files containing parsers<br>
are placed in this directory. The name of the jar file must match a class name in the<br>
jar file and that class must implement the parser interface. Once implemented, the<br>
parser converts the extracted data into a format that can be used by the Privacy<br>
module 442 and Movement Filtering and Detection module 446. When the<br>
processing of the file is complete, the file is moved to a processed directory. Upon<br>
startup of the Data Input and Processing module 442, all the files in the processed<br>
directory are purged if they are older than a specified number of days.<br>
Figure 6 presents details on the polling and parsing process 241 under an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the Data Input and Processing module. In step 615 of the<br>
process, Wireless Network Data 610, or otherwise referred to as operational data,<br>
flows continuously from the network to a designated data storage location on the<br>
Traffic Information System 100 for other data formats 636. These data files are<br>
parsed, at step 640, based on the specific file type. Parallel to step 615, step 620<br>
periodically polls the Wireless Network's FTP server and local flat file storage drives<br>
for operational data. If new data files are found in decision step 625, the files are<br>
sorted in step 627. For example, BTS activity data is send to file storage location 632<br>
for that data type, CDRs are sent to storage location 634 and A Interface and Abis<br>
Interface data are sent to storage location 636. One skilled in the art would appreciate<br>
that the present invention can accommodate a wide variety of file data types in this<br>
step, as evidenced by other data types 638. If no new files are found at step 625, the<br>
process returns to step 620 and polls the Wireless Network Data 610 at the next preset<br>
time interval.<br>
Data files are then sent from the storage locations 632, 634, and 636 to the<br>
parser in step 640. In this step, the algorithm is specific to the data type parsed. For<br>
example, a unique algorithm would be used for CDRs as compared to BTS activity<br>
data. The parsed data is then sent to a Mobile Station Data Record file 645. Each<br>
data record in this file is read in step 650 and the data needed to support a Traffic<br>
Information System 100, the traffic data record, otherwise referred to as raw data<br>
record, is extracted in step 655 and sent to the Privacy module in step 670. This<br>
traffic data record contains wireless telephony communications network operational<br>
data used for assessing vehicular traffic movement. In the exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention, this traffic data record may include the start and end times for a<br>
call, the cell ID or specific locations for the start and end of the call, the mobile<br>
station identifier number, the number dialed, the call category, and the number of<br>
handoffs and the cell IDs and times for the handoffs. One skilled in the art would<br>
appreciate other data can be included in the raw data record.<br>
Figure 7 presents how data is processed 247 in the Privacy module for an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Traffic data records associated with<br>
a mobile station are received from the Data Input and Processing module in step 710.<br>
In step 720, the hashtable 730 is searched for the mobile station identifier number<br>
contained in the data record. Hashtable 730 contains mobile station identifier<br>
numbers matched to a unique serial number assigned to that identifier by the Privacy<br>
module. In decision step 740, if the mobile station identifier number is not in the<br>
hashtable 730, then a unique serial number is assigned to that mobile station identifier<br>
number and the serial number/identifier pair is stored in the hashtable 730 at step 742.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the serial number is generated with the following<br>
algorithm in Table I. One skilled in the art would appreciate that a variety of<br>
techniques could be used to generate a unique alphanumeric indicator to represent the<br>
mobile station ID.<br>
In step 744, the serial number associated with that identifier number is<br>
retrieved from the hashtable 730. These steps cleanse the record of personal<br>
identifying information. In this embodiment, the Traffic Information System 100<br>
does not associate movement records with a specific mobile station identifier number.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, however, this cleansing step<br>
could be omitted. One possible application for this alternative embodiment is to<br>
enable the system to track a given mobile station as it moves, for example a parent<br>
tracking the location of a child with a cellular phone.<br>
In decision step 750, a determination is made whether the phone number<br>
dialed is part of the raw data record. If so, then step 760 categorizes the call based on<br>
the characteristics of the dialed number and the process moves to step 770. Table II<br>
below summarizes the categorization for the exemplary embodiment.<br>
If the phone number is not part of the traffic data record, the process moves<br>
directly from decision step 750 to step 770. In step 770, the Privacy module 444<br>
creates a Location Record. This record is passed to the Movement Filtering and<br>
Detection module 446 in step 780. In the exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention, this location record may include the start and end times for a call, the cell<br>
ID or specific locations for the start and end of the call, serial number, the number<br>
dialed, the call category, registration information, whether the call was handed off or<br>
handed over, and the number of handoffs and the cell IDs and times for the handoffs.<br>
One skilled in the art would appreciate other data can be included in the Location<br>
Record.<br>
Figure 8 depicts the Movement Filtering and Detection process 249. As<br>
shown in Figure 8, in step 810, the Movement Filtering and Detection module 446<br>
receives location records from the Privacy module 444. At step 820, each location<br>
record is loaded. For each record, step 840 interrogates the Location Hashtable 830<br>
and retrieves the last know location for the serial number associated with the record.<br>
In decision step 850, the location indicated on the location record is compared to the<br>
last know location for that serial number as recorded in the Location Hashtable 830.<br>
If the location differs, a Movement Record is generated and stored in cache in step<br>
860. Then, in step 870, the Location Hashtable is updated and the movement record<br>
is recorded in the Movement Record Hashtable 880. If the last known position is not<br>
different from the current position at step 850, step 860 is skipped and the process<br>
moves to step 870. This process is repeated for all location records.<br>
Figure 9 outlines processing 246 performed by a Configuration and<br>
Monitoring module 448 in a DEX Module 240. A Configuration and Monitoring<br>
module 448 interacts with each other module in a DEX Module 240 to assess system<br>
operations. A Configuration and Monitoring module 448 of an exemplary<br>
embodiment functions to alert a system administrator if the DEX Module 240 is<br>
functioning outside a preset operational range 916 and to allow a system<br>
administrator to set configuration parameters 916. In the exemplary embodiment, a<br>
System Administrator can configure the Traffic Information System 100 over an<br>
intranet or a virtual private network (VPN) by conducting configuration activity 916<br>
using a secure connection, e.g., passwords or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificates.<br>
This configuration activity 916 may include the following tasks, as shown in Table<br>
III.<br>
Table III<br>
• setting the frequency of polling the Wireless Network 220;<br>
• setting the maximum time a mobile station can sit in one place before its<br>
serial number is released;<br>
• setting the maximum amount of time that individual cached record can<br>
reside on the DEX before it is discarded;<br>
• setting the minimum time between position requests. This is used to pace<br>
requests to the mobile positioning system of the Wireless Network 220;<br>
• setting the minimum time between position requests for the same MS.<br>
This setting is used to pace requests to the mobile positioning center;<br>
• setting the locations authorized to be delivered to the DAN 260 for each<br>
event notification (e.g., nothing, area, cell, edge, or position);<br>
• authorizing the details of a dialed number to be delivered to the DAN 260<br>
for each event notification (e.g., nothing, a classification, the three-digit<br>
NPA, the six-digit office code, or the entire called number);<br>
• authorizing the details of a number for incoming calls to be delivered to<br>
the DAN 260 for each event notification (e.g., nothing, a classification, the<br>
three-digit NPA, the six-digit office code, or the entire called number);<br>
and<br>
• Identification of the mobile stations that have given permission to release<br>
CPNI information for the application in this DAN 260.<br>
Additionally, the Performance Statistics Cache 914 can store statistics on<br>
system performance as defined by the system administrator. This statistics cache can<br>
result in alert and reporting activity 918 to report monitored system behavior, either<br>
containing routine information or alerting the administrator that the system is<br>
performing outside specifications. This alert and reporting activity 918 can be<br>
transmitted by way of e-mail, pagers, telephone, instant messages, or other similar<br>
alert or reporting actions. In the exemplary embodiment, the cached statistics may<br>
include the following information, as shown in Table IV.<br>
Table IV<br>
• number of CDRs processed;<br>
• number of A-interface messages processed, i.e., BTS interface data;<br>
• number of cell-based position requests solicited;<br>
• number of cell-based position requests cancelled;<br>
• number of mobile station identifier-base position requests solicited;<br>
• number of mobile station identifier-based position requests cancelled;<br>
• number of solicited position requests launched;<br>
• number of solicited position request responses received;<br>
• number of unsolicited position request responses received;<br>
• number of event notifications generated for each DAN 260;<br>
• number of event notifications delivered to each DAN 260; and<br>
• number of bytes delivered to each DAN 260.<br>
Figure 10 presents the process-level block diagram for the Data Analysis<br>
Node 260 in an exemplary embodiment. A DAN Module 260 comprises a DAN<br>
Configuration Module 1050, a DAN Traffic Modeler 1060, and DAN MPS<br>
Determination module 1070. A DAN Configuration Module 1050 receives data in<br>
the form of cell sector coverage maps 530, from the Wireless Network 220 provider,<br>
and roadway maps 1040, from the transportation department or a commercial vendor.<br>
These maps are used to define routes used by the Traffic Modeler 1060 to translate<br>
the cell sector ID to a physical location. How the maps are used is detailed further<br>
below, in association with Figures 11-14. These data are updated whenever the data<br>
source changes. For example, if the Wireless Network 220 changes their<br>
infrastructure resulting in a new cell sector coverage map 1030, the new data is<br>
provided to the DAN Configuration Module 1050.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a DAN Traffic Modeler 1060 accepts<br>
movement records from a Movement Record Hashtable 880 in a DEX Module 240.<br>
A DAN Traffic Modeler's 1060 function is to output traffic information in the form<br>
of travel velocity estimates along designated routes. This information is stored in a<br>
Route Database 1080. A DAN Traffic Modeler 1060 develops these estimates by<br>
determining the route taken by a mobile station based on the movement records and<br>
the routes generated in a DAN Configuration Module 1050. A DAN Traffic Modeler<br>
1060 then chooses one route out of potential routes and uses timing data associated<br>
with the movement record to estimate the velocity along the chosen route. Potential<br>
routes are identified from the Route Database 1080 and modified, or trimmed, if<br>
necessary. Route identification and trimming are discussed in association with<br>
Figures 15 and 16, respectively.<br>
A DAN Module 260 also augments the movement records 880 it receives<br>
from a DEX Module 240 with mobile station location data from an MPS on a<br>
Wireless Network 220. A MPS Determination module 1070 functions to routinely<br>
evaluates the quantity and quality of the velocity estimates from the Traffic Modeler<br>
1060 and, if needed, sends a request for specific mobile station location data through<br>
the DEX Module 240. The MPS Determination module 1070 is used with wireless<br>
telephony communications networks that support MPS.<br>
Figure 11 shows the route generation process 262a in a DAN Configuration<br>
Module 1050 for an exemplary embodiment. The cell sector coverage maps are<br>
stored, by cell sector, in a database 530. In step 1110, a cell sector is selected from<br>
the database 530. In step 1140, the geographic information system database<br>
containing roadway maps 1040 is queried to determine all road segments that<br>
intersect the cell sector. The results from this query are boundary road segments<br>
1150 associated with the cell sector , i.e., road segments that cross the boundary of a<br>
cell sector, connecting a cell sector to an adjacent cell sector. The boundary road<br>
segments 1150 serve as the input for route processing 1160, discussed below in<br>
association with Figure 12. The results from route processing return at step 1170.<br>
The overall process is repeated for each cell sector in the database at step 1180. As<br>
discussed in more detail below, this process generates a database of potential routes<br>
used by the Traffic Modeler 1060. The route generation process 262 is run by a DAN<br>
Configuration Module 1050 whenever the cell sector coverage maps or the roadway<br>
maps are updated.<br>
Figure 12 details the routing process 262b by a DAN Configuration Module<br>
1050 for the exemplary embodiment. In step 1210, the routes comprising the<br>
boundary segments are stored in the Route Database 1240. For example, a boundary<br>
segment that connects Cell Sector A with Cell Sector B is a route from Cell Sector A<br>
to Cell Sector B. These routes serve as the initial building blocks for the routes in the<br>
Route Database 1240. In step 1215, the intra-sector route between two boundary<br>
segments is determined. This route is the shortest path, in terms of distance, from one<br>
boundary segment to another boundary segment over existing roadways. This path is<br>
determined from a GIS database of roadways. This database will define road<br>
segments between the boundary segments. The GIS database may use one of a<br>
variety of ways to define the road segments. For example, a segment can be a stretch<br>
of road from one intersection to another or a change in road name. The present<br>
invention can use the GIS data in whatever form the database has been established.<br>
The shortest path between boundary segments defines an inter-sector route, a<br>
route from one sector through an adjacent sector, to a third sector. Figures 13a and b<br>
depict an illustrative example of cell sectors and roadways. For illustrative purposes,<br>
the cell sectors have been defined as squares of uniform size and alignment. Figure<br>
13a shows sixteen cell sectors, labeled "A" to "P." The dark lines indicate roadways.<br>
Figure 13b shows an enlarged image of cell sector C and the adjacent sectors. In this<br>
example, an inter-section route would be from cell sector A to cell sector D over the<br>
roadway from point 1310 to point 1330 to point 1320. Another inter-sector route<br>
would be from cell sector A to cell sector F over the roadway from point 1310 to<br>
point 1320 to point 1340. A third inter-sector route would be from cell sector D to<br>
cell sector F over the roadway from point 1330 to point 1320 to point 1340<br>
Figure 13 depicts a simplified representation of a cell sector/roadway overlay.<br>
Figure 14 presents a more realistic depiction. The shaded polygons represent unique<br>
cell sectors. As can be seen in Figure 14, the cell sectors vary in size and the<br>
roadways within a sector can be complex.<br>
Returning to Figure 12, step 1220 initiates a loop for each defined inter-<br>
segment traffic route developed in step 1215. In step 1225, the segment velocity is<br>
initialized to the posted speed limit for the segment plus or minus a variance of<br>
twenty-five percent of that posted speed limit. This initialization step is performed<br>
for each of the 168 hours in a week. In an alternative embodiment, the time<br>
increments can be set to every 15 minutes, for a total of 672 increments. One skilled<br>
in the art would appreciate that the number of time increments can be based on any<br>
time division, e.g., per hour, per half-hour, per fifteen minutes, or per minute. The<br>
calculation for a per hour time division is as follows:<br><br>
Where:<br>
I = the hour of the week, from 1 to 168, with the hour between<br>
12:00 am and 1:00 am Sunday being 1<br>
s = road segment s<br>
vs,I - average velocity at hour I<br>
Vps = posted speed limit for segment s<br>
vars,I = variance range of velocity at hour I for segment s, which<br>
represents the range from -25% to +25%<br>
As stated above, the GIS database defines what comprises a segment. In the<br>
illustrative example in Figure 13, a segment may be the length of roadway from point<br>
1310 to 1320 and another segment the length of roadway from 1320 to 1340. The<br>
entire route from A to F would be the length of roadway defined by those two<br>
segments. In step 1230, the route velocity is initialized to the weighted average<br>
velocity for the traffic route, weighted by the normalized length of each segment.<br>
The calculation is as follows:<br>
In step 1233, the process initializes the variance of the traffic route velocity to<br>
plus or minus twenty-five percent of the weighted average velocity calculated at step<br>
1230. The calculation is as follows.<br>
varr,I =vr,I*0.5<br>
Where:<br>
varr,I = variance of velocity for router for hour I<br>
vr,I = average velocity for router for hour I<br>
The traffic routes and initialized velocities for those routes for each of the 168<br>
hours in a week, the time increment in this exemplary embodiment, are stored at step<br>
1235 in the Route Database 1080. At step 1240, the number of handoffs for each<br>
route is calculated. The number of handoffs is the number of times a route crosses<br>
over a cell sector boundary. For example, in Figure 13, the route from cell sector A<br>
to cell sector E would have three handoffs, one when the mobile station moves from<br>
sector A to C, one when it moves from C to F, and one when it moves from F to E.<br>
In step 1245, the sector where the route terminates, the "to sector," and the sector<br>
where the route originates, the "from sector," together with the route ID and number<br>
of handoffs, are stored in the Route Database 1080. The process is repeated for each<br>
inter-sector route associated with the boundary segment. The process then returns to<br>
the Route Generation process in step 1255. This process is discussed above. The<br>
entire Route Generation process is repeated at step 1250, and builds on prior routes,<br>
until the Route Database 1080 contains all possible routes from each cell sector to<br>
each cell sector.<br>
Figure 15 presents the Route Selection process 264a for an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This process 264a defines the traffic route for a<br>
mobile station and is performed by the Traffic Modeler 1060. In step 1505,<br>
movement vectors are retrieved from the DEX for a given serial number. In the<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention, these vectors are retrieved<br>
periodically at specified time intervals, time intervals based on the configuration of<br>
the DEX.<br>
In Step 1510, a polyline of the movement locations associated with the mobile<br>
station is generated. Referring to the illustrative example in Figure 13, assume that a<br>
mobile station places a call at time t1 while in cell sector D. The call terminates at<br>
time t2 while the mobile station is in sector G. The same mobile station a short time<br>
later, time t3, places a call from sector M and the call terminates at time t4 in sector O.<br>
The DEX would have developed three movement vectors, one from sector D at t1 to<br>
sector G at t2, one from sector G at t2 to sector M at t3, and one from sector M at t3 to<br>
sector O at t4. The polyline associated with this movement would be from D to G to<br>
M to O.<br>
In step 1515, the polyline is broken into start and end sector pairs. In the<br>
example presented in the previous paragraph, the start and end sector pairs would be<br>
DG, DM, DO, GM, GO, and MO. In other words, the start and finish pairs comprise<br>
the combination of all points that comprise the polyline. For each of these start and<br>
end sector pairs, step 1520 of the process queries the database for all traffic routes<br>
between that start and end sector pair. This query returns all information about the<br>
route stored in the Route Database 1525. In the exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, this information includes the route ID, the average velocity and<br>
variance of the velocity over that route for each of the 168 hours in a week, the<br>
beginning and ending sectors associated with that route, and the expected number of<br>
handoffs associated with the route.<br>
The exemplary process analyzes each of the possible routes, as shown by the<br>
loop initiated in step 1530. In step 1535, the handoff score is calculated. The handoff<br>
score is an exemplary technique that evaluates how likely it is that the mobile station<br>
traveled the route being analyzed. The score is calculated as follows:<br><br>
In step 1540, the handoff score is compared to a cutoff value. If yes, the route<br>
is saved at step 1545. If not, the route is discarded at step 1550. For saved routes, the<br>
velocity over that route is calculated in step 1555 and is based on the length of the<br>
route and the beginning and ending timestamps associated with the movement vector<br>
as supplied by the Data Extraction Module. The velocity is:<br><br>
Where:<br>
vr = velocity of route<br>
dr = distance of route<br>
t2 = time of timestamp2, the end of the movement<br>
t1 = time of timestamp1, the start of the movement<br>
In steps 1560 and 1563, this velocity is compared to the maximum and<br>
minimum cutoffs for the velocity for that route. These cutoff values are based on<br>
velocities and variances contained in the Route Database 1080 and a preset tolerance<br>
level, in terms of the number of standard deviations used to calculate the maximum<br>
and minimum cutoff values. For example, a system with a wide tolerance may set the<br>
number of standard deviations in the acceptable range to three or four, while a system<br>
with a narrow tolerance may set the number of standard deviations to one or two.<br>
The maximum and minimum cutoff values are calculated as follows:<br><br>
Where:<br>
v = maximum cutoff velocity<br>
max<br>
vr t1 = velocity of route at hour t1<br>
Cv = cutoff for velocity comparison in number of standard, deviations<br>
varr t1 = variance of velocity for route r at hour t1<br>
t1 = time oftimestamp1, the start of the movement<br><br>
Where:<br>
vmin = minimum cutoff velocity<br>
vr t1 = velocity of route at hour t1<br>
Cv = cutoff for velocity comparison in number of standard deviations<br>
varr,t1 = variance of velocity for route rat hour t1<br>
t1 - time oftimestampi, the start of the movement<br>
Routes with velocities that are less than the maximum cutoff velocity and<br>
greater than the minimum cutoff velocity are saved at step 1570. Routes with<br>
velocities that exceed the maximum cutoff move to decisional step 1565 to determine<br>
if the route can be trimmed. A route can be trimmed if it is comprised of multiple<br>
segments. If the route can be trimmed, the process moves to step 1575. If not, the<br>
route is discarded at step 1550. The results from the route trimming process return to<br>
the route selection process 264 at step 1580. For routes that are saved at step 1570,<br>
the process moves to decision step 1585. If another route must be evaluated, the<br>
process returns to step 1530. If not, the process moves to velocity estimation at step<br>
1590.<br>
Figure 16 presents the process for route trimming 264b for an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention. This process 264b is a loop that compares the<br>
calculated route velocity with the maximum cutoff velocity for that route. The<br>
process then removes segments from the route and compares the new velocity with<br>
the cutoff velocity. In the initial calculation of velocity, the Traffic Modeler 1060<br>
assumes that the mobile station is at the farthest end of a ceil sector in relation to the<br>
end sector location and similarly that the mobile station ends at the farthest part of the<br>
ending sector in relation to the starting sector. These assumptions make the route<br>
distance the longest it possibly can be. By removing a segment at either end of the<br>
route, the route becomes shorter and the velocity calculated by the Traffic Modeler<br>
1060 decreases (a shorter route traveled over a fixed time period yields a lower<br>
average route velocity). In the process step 1610, the first loop (counter equal to 0,<br>
set at step 1605) is the velocity value calculated in the route selection process (see<br>
Figure 15).<br>
Decision step 1615 looks to determine if the route velocity is less than the<br>
maximum velocity for the route. For route velocities that are less then the maximum<br>
velocity, the process returns to the route selection process at step 1620. For route<br>
velocities that are equal to or greater than the maximum velocity cutoff at step 1615,<br>
the process looks at the loop counter at step 1630. If the loop counter is even, the<br>
process looks at the beginning sector in the route. At step 1625, the process<br>
determines if there are more than two segments comprising the route in the beginning<br>
cell sector. If so, the process removes the first segment from the route, at step 1645.<br>
The process increments the loop counter at step 1660. If there are not more than two<br>
segments at the beginning of the route, the process moves to decision step 1640. If<br>
the answer to step 1640, is loop counter odd, is yes, then the process moves to step<br>
1650 and returns an invalid route. This step exists because the process just came<br>
from the "loop counter is even" branch, so a yes result means that the process is<br>
flawed. If the result in step 1640 is no, the process moves to step 1635.<br>
Step 1635 determines if there are more than two segments comprising the<br>
route in the ending cell sector. If so, then the process removes the last segment at<br>
step 1655, increments the loop counter at step 1660 and is returned to the beginning<br>
of the process at step 1670. The process returns to the Route Selection process when<br>
there are not more than two road segments at either the beginning sector ending sector<br>
of the route or when sufficient segments are removed so that the velocity is below the<br>
cutoff.<br>
The Traffic Modeler 1060 estimates a velocity, based on the possible routes<br>
the mobile station followed, as indicated in Figure 17. In step 1710, the velocity<br>
estimation process 264c is triggered by the route selection process 264b. In step 1720<br>
the best route is selected from all the possible routes that survived the Route Selection<br>
process (see Figure 15). In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
"best" route is based on a statistical analysis of the velocities and handoff scores for<br>
each possible route. The statistical analysis results in a z score for each possible<br>
route. One skilled in the art would appreciate that a variety of statistical analyses<br>
could be performed to select the "best" route. The best route is the route with the<br>
minimum of the following expression:<br>
Where:<br>
?x - weight of z-score default is 0.3<br>
?h = weight of handoff score default is 0.7<br>
z = z-score of velocity at time t1,<br>
h = handoff score<br>
t1 = timestamp1, the start of the movement<br>
For the best route, the process then calculates the route velocity at step 1730.<br>
The velocity is calculated as follows:<br>
Where:<br>
vr = the current velocity on road segment s<br>
houri.li) <br>
vs = average velocity for segment s for time stamp1<br>
Vdiff = the difference of the observed velocity and the calculated<br>
var,= variance of the velocity for road segment s at hour tj<br>
 = sum of the variances for each of the segments in route r<br>
Where:<br>
vrJ = average velocity for route r for hour I<br>
s = road segment s where the route r is defined by the<br>
connection of each segment<br>
vs,I - average velocity at hour I<br>
ds - distance of road segment<br>
dr - distance of route <br>
At step 1740, the process calculates the route velocity based on the overall<br>
route distance and time. In other words, the route velocity is the ratio of the total<br>
length of the route to the time it took the mobile station to move from the initial<br>
location to the ending location. Step 1745 begins a loop for all route segments. At<br>
step 1750, the difference of these two velocity estimates is calculated. This<br>
difference, Vdiff, is used in step 1760 to calculate a new segment velocity, as follows:<br>
The difference in the two velocity estimates is a measure of the variance in the<br>
velocity and the calculation above establishes a new variance (as compared to the<br>
initialized variance from step 1225, Figure 12) based on the calculated difference.<br>
In step 1780 the average velocity by segment and variance is updated in the<br>
database. These values are determined by the following equations:<br><br>
Where:<br>
ns hour(t1) = number of samples for the segment s at hour t1<br>
vshour(t1) = average velocity for segment s for timestamp1<br>
va r xhour(t1) = variance of velocity at hour t1 for segment s<br>
At step 1790, the process updates the average velocity and variance for the<br>
entire route. These updates are based on the following calculation:<br>
Where:<br>
s = road segment s where r is defined by the connection of all<br>
segments<br>
ds = distance of road segment<br>
dr = distance of route <br>
nrhour(t1) = number of samples for the route r at hour t1<br>
Vrhour(t1) = average velocity for segment s for timestamp1<br>
varshour(t1) = yariance of velocity at hour t1 for segment s<br>
In the exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a separate module, the<br>
MPS Determination module 1070 of the DAN Module 260, operates to assess the<br>
quality of the velocity estimates from the Traffic Modeler 1060, based on the number<br>
of samples used to generate the velocity estimates. Step 1795 from the velocity<br>
estimation process 264c serves as a gateway for the MPS Determination module 1070<br>
polling the Traffic Modeler 1060. Figure 18 presents the operation of the MPS<br>
Determination module 1070. In step 1805, the process polls the Traffic Modeler,<br>
extracting the updated segment velocity and variance data from the velocity<br>
estimation process 264c (see Figure 17 at 1795). Step 1810 initiates a loop for each<br>
road segment analyzed in the velocity estimation process 264c., the MPS<br>
Determination module 1070 determines, at step 1815, the number of samples needed<br>
for the desired level of precision and determines, at 1820, if that level is met. The<br>
required number of samples for a given precision level is calculated as follows:<br><br>
Where<br>
za/2 = is the z-score of the confidence interval desired (e.g. 90% or z<br>
1.645)<br>
varshour(t1) = variance of the velocity of the road segment<br>
E = is half the width of the range (e.g. +/- 10 MPH)<br><br>
If the number of samples used in the Traffic model is equal to or greater than<br>
the target number calculated at step 1815, then the segment is not considered further,<br>
at step 1825. If not, the segment is added to the MPS request list at step 1835 and the<br>
loop is repeated at step 1840 for each segment. Once all the segments have been<br>
evaluated, the process, at step 1845, retrieves from the Route Database 1830 all routes<br>
that contain the segments in the MPS request list from 1835. At step 1850, the<br>
process issues a request to the DEX for mobile station location data for mobile<br>
stations on traffic routes containing the listed segments. This limited use of MPS data<br>
minimizes the load on the Wireless Networks' resources, revealing a desired element<br>
of the exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
In summary, the present invention relates to a Traffic Information System<br>
100. An exemplary embodiment of the system comprises two main components, a<br>
DEX Module 240 and a DAN Module 260. In this embodiment, a DEX Module 240<br>
extracts data related to communication activity of mobile stations from an existing<br>
Wireless Network 220 with minimal impact on the operations of the Wireless<br>
Network 220. In an exemplary embodiment, a DEX Module 240 processes that data<br>
to remove personal identifying information about the mobile station. In this<br>
procession, the traffic data record may be categorized based on the type of phone call<br>
made. These traffic data records are further processed to generate movement records<br>
associated with individual mobile stations.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, a DAN Module 260 combines the movement<br>
records from the DEX Module 240 with data associated with the geographic layout of<br>
cell sectors and roadways to estimate travel velocities along specific travel routes.<br>
With the data associated with the geographic layout of cell sectors and roadways, a<br>
DAN Module 260 generates maps that overly the cell sector grid onto roadway maps.<br>
These overlay maps are used to generate all possible travel routes between any two<br>
cell sectors. The DAN Module 260 may also retrieve mobile station location data<br>
from an MPS on a Wireless Network 220 to improve the statistical quality of the<br>
velocity estimates.<br>
