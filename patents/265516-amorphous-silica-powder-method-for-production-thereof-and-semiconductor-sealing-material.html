				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an amorphous silica powder, a process for its production, and a sealing material for semiconductors using it,<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
To meet requirements of downsizing and weight saving and high functionality of electronic equipment, downsizing, reduction in thickness and reduction in pitch of semiconductor packages are rapidly in progress. Further, with respect to their mounting method, surface mounting suitable for high density mounting on a printed board or the like is dominant. As the semiconductor packages and their mounting methods are in progress, improvement in reliability of a sealing material for semiconductors in high temperature environment is more highly required.<br>
Particularly for automobiles, mounting of controlling members and electronic equipment which heavily employ semiconductors is in progress. Accordingly, a sealing material for semiconductors is required to have flame retardancy imparted without using<br>
a flame retardant with a heavy environmental burden, to be resistant to mechanical external pressure such as vibration and acceleration, and to be guaranteed to operate in severe high temperature environment in the car. Thus, the sealing material is required to have high temperature storage life {hereinafter sometimes referred to as HTSL properties) and high temperature operating life {hereinafter sometimes referred to as HTOL properties) higher than those required for general equipment.<br>
In order to meet such requirements, a means of improving high temperature life has been employed by reducing ionic impurities and electrically conductive impurities in a sealing material for semiconductors as far as possible, by incorporating an amorphous silica powder at a high density to reduce moisture absorptivity, by adding an ion trapping agent, or by employing a resin containing no flame retardant such as halogen, antimony or inorganic phosphorus (Patent Documents 1 and 2). However, by such a means, the effect of improving the high temperature life is still insufficient,. and a sealing material for semiconductors which satisfies severe requirements of HTSL properties and HTOL properties has not yet been  known.<br>

EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, a resin composition or a rubber composition (hereinafter both will sometimes be referred to simply as a "composition")<br>
having improved HTSL properties and HTOL properties, particularly a sealing material for semiconductors is provided. Further, an amorphous silica powder suitable for preparation of such a composition is provided.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THEv INVENTION<br>
The amorphous silica powder of the present invention has an Al content as calculated as Al2O3 (sometimes referred to as a content as calculated as A12O3 in the present invention) measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry of from 0.03 to 20 mass%. If the content as calculated as Al2O3 is less than 0.03 mass%, the amount of impurities in the sealing material for semiconductors to be trapped tends to be small, whereby the HTSL properties and the HTOL properties can not remarkably be improved. On the other hand, if the content as calculated as Al2O3 is higher than 20 maas%, the coefficient of thermal expansion of the amorphous silica powder tends to be high, whereby thermal properties of the sealing material for semiconductors such as soldering heat resistance and thermal shock resistance tend to be impaired. In addition, the surface of the amorphous silica particles will be covered with an A12O3, whereby no Lewis acid sites will be formed on the particle surface, whereby impurities in the sealing material for semiconductor will not be trapped. The content as calculated as A12O3 of the amorphous silica<br>
powder is preferably from 0.05 to 15 mass%, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 10 wt%.<br>
As an atomic absorption photometer to carry out the atomic absorption spectrophotometry, for example, an atomic absorption photometer AA-969 manufactured by Japan Jarrell Ash may be mentioned. A standard solution to be used for preparation of an analytical curve may, for example, be an Al standard solution (concentration: 1,000 pptn} for atomic absorption manufactured by KANTO CHEMICAL CO., INC. As a frame for measurement, an acetylene/nitrous oxide frame is used, and the absorbance at a wavelength of 309.3 nm is measured for quantitative determination.<br>
The Al component measured by the atomic absorption spectrophotometry is considered to have a chemical bond in the amorphous silica, for example, to be present as silica-alumina glass having:a -O-Si-O-Al-O- structure or the like. The reason is that in the case of a mere mechanical mixture of an amorphous silica powder with an alumina powder or a mere alumina coating on the silica particle surface, the Al component is insoluble in an acid and can not be detected by the atomic absorption spectrophotometry.<br>
Further, the amorphous silica powder of the present invention is characterized in that it has an average particle size of at most 50. urn and that when it is divided according to the average particle size into two<br>
powders, a powder having a particle size smaller than the average particle size has a higher content as calculated as A1203 than a powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size. In the present invention, a powder having a particle size equal to the average particle size is included in the powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size.<br>
In the present invention, when the amorphous silica powder is divided according to the average particle size into particles having a particle size (diameter) larger than the average particle size and particles smaller than the average particle size, the powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size is the total amount of particles having the same particle size as the average particle size and particles larger than the average particle size, and the powder having a particle size smaller than the average particle size is the total amount of particies having a particle size smaller than the average particle size.<br>
If the average particle size of the amorphous silica powder of the present invention exceeds 50 urn, the silica powder can not be incorporated at a high density in the composition, whereby the HTSL properties and the HTOL properties will not sufficiently be improved. The average particle size is preferably from 8 to 50 urn, particularly preferably from 8 to 40 urn. Further, when a powder having a smaller average particle size contains a<br>
larger amount of the Al component than a powder having a larger average particle size when the amorphous silica powder is divided according to the average particle size into two powders, the area of contact with impurities in the sealing material for semiconductors tends to be large, whereby the effect of trapping impurities will be very high.<br>
In the present invention, the average particle size is a particle    size (D50) at a cumulative value of the mass of 50% in the particle size based on the mass measured by a laser diffraction scattering type particle size distribution measuring instrument.<br>
The reason of development of the above effect obtainable by the present invention is described as follows. Namely, in a semiconductor apparatus, a semiconductor chip and a lead frame are connected and conducted by means of a gold wire. Further, on the lead frame side, a gold wire and an aluminum pad are connected by means of heat and ultrasonic waves. On that occasion, an alloy called eutectic crystals or an intermetallic compound is formed between gold and aluminum. It is known that during storage and operation at high temperature, erosion, cracks or void occurs on the eutectic portion due to influence by impurities in the sealing material for semiconductors, which causes problems such as an increase in the connection resistance and failure in conduction.<br>
However, when an Al component by means of a chemical bond i.e. an Al component in a content as calculated as Al2O3 of from 0.03 to 20 mass% measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometory is present in the amorphous silica particles, it will be Lewis acid sites with a strong position of Al due to the difference in the coordination number between Si and Al. The Lewis acid sites trap impurities in the sealing material for semiconductors which impair the HTSL properties and the HTOL properties, such as Na ions, K ions, halogen, inorganic phosphorus and organic phosphorus for detoxification, whereby it will be possible to prepare a sealing material for semiconductors having improved HTSL properties and HTOL properties.<br>
The above fact is demonstrated by that an amorphous silica powder having a content as calculated as Al2O3 of 10 mass% measured by the atomic absorption spectrophotometory has an effect of trapping impurities in the sealing material for semiconductors about 20 times higher than that of a mere mechanical mixture of 90  mass% of an amorphous silica powder and 10 mass% of an alumina powder or an amorphous silica powder covered with 10 mass% of alumina. <br>
The above effect of trapping impurities is accelerated when the amorphous silica powder of the present invention satisfies at least one of the following (1) to (3) .  (1) When the amorphous silica powder is<br>
divided according to the average particle size into two powders, the ratio (AS/AL) of the content as calculated as A12O3 of a powder having a particle size Smaller than the average particle size (AS) to the content as calculated as A12O3 of a powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size (AL) is preferably from 1.2 to 50, more preferably from 1.4 to 20, particularly preferably from 1.6 to 10, (2) Of a part of (a part means 20 mass% or more, preferably 30 mass% or more) or the entire particles constituting the powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size, the content as calculated as Al2O3 at a portion of from the particle surface to  a depth of 1 urn, is at least 1.10 times, preferably at least 1.20 times, particularly preferably at least 1.30 times, the content at a portion with a depth exceeding 1 µm.  (3) With respect to the particle size based on mass measured by a laser diffraction scattering type particle size distribution measuring instrument, the cumulative value up to 12 urn is from 35 to 60%, preferably from 37 to 58%, the cumulative value up to 24 urn is from 40 to 65%, preferably from 42 to 63%, and the cumulative value up to 64 urn is from 85 to 100%, preferably from 87 to. 98%.<br>
When the amorphous silica powder is divided according to the average, particle size into two powders and the ratio of the content as calculated as A1203 of a powder (S) having a smaller average particle size to a<br>
powder (L) having a larger average particle size is within the above range, the area of contact between<br>
i<br>
impurities in the sealing material for semiconductors and the Lewis acid sites on the surface of the amorphous silica powder tends to be large, whereby the effect of trapping impurities will be very high. However, if the ratio is remarkably higher than 50 times, the deviation of the Al component content relative to the particle size tends to be too significant, whereby the effect of trapping impurities by the powder having a larger average particle size will hardly be obtained.<br>
Further, when the amorphous silica powder is divided according to the average particle size into two powders and of a part of or the entire particles constituting the powder (L) having a larger average particle size, the Al component content at a portion of from the particle surface to a depth of 1 urn is within the above range based on the content at a portion with a depth exceeding 1 urn, Al is present in a larger amount on the surface of the amorphous silica particles, whereby the chances of contact between the Lewis acid sites and impurities tend to increase, whereby the effect of trapping impurities is accelerated.<br>
Further, when the amorphous silica powder of the present invention has the above particle size distribution, when the amorphous silica powder is incorporated in a composition, the viscosity of the<br>
composition can be remarkably reduced, and consequently/ the packing fraction can further be increased. Thus, the HTSL properties and the HTOL properties will more remarkably be improved. Namely, in order to incorporate the amorphous silica powder in a composition while suppressing thickening of the resin, it is necessary that the particle size distribution of the amorphous silica powder is close to the close-packed structure. In order that particles penetrate into packed structure constituted by particles within a range of from 24 to 64 µm to further density the packed structure, it is preferred that the amount of particles of from 12 to 24 µm is as small as possible and particles of 12 µm or smaller are contained in a large amount.<br>
As the optimum ratio (based on mass) of particles in the amorphous silica powder of the present invention, the cumulative value up to 12 µm is from 35 to 60%, the cumulative value up to 24 µm is from 40 to 65%, and the cumulative value up to 64 µm is from 85 to 100%.' By such a particle size constitution, a composition having more excellent moldability will be obtained since favorable low viscosity properties are maintained even with high density packing. It is most preferred that there are no particles of from 12 to 24 µm since they are unnecessary for the tight packing structure constituted by the above two groups of particles, and their content is preferably at most 20% (including 0%), particularly preferably at<br>
most 10% (including 0%) if any.<br>
In the present invention, the position of presence and the content of Al of the powder (L) having a larger average particle size when the amorphous silica powder is divided according to the average particle size into two powders, are determined as follows. Namely, the amorphous silica particles are embedded in an epoxy resin and cut, and the cross section is measured by X-ray microanalyzer (EPMA) JXA-8200 manufactured by JEOL Ltd. The measurement conditions are such that the accelerating voltage is 15 kV, the applied current is 10 nA, the magnification is 2,000 times, the cumulative time is 100 msec, the pixel size is 0.2 µm, and the number of pixels is 256x256 pixels, and' PET is used for analyzing crystals by SiKα<br>
 rays, and TAPH is used for AlKα rays. Optional 80 particles are photographed under the above conditions, to determine the Al content at a surface portion from the particle surface to 1 µm, and the Al content at a portion with a depth exceeding 1 µm from the particle surface.<br>
In the present invention, the particle size distribution of the amorphous silica powder is determined based on the particle size measurement by laser diffraction scattering method. As a measuring instrument, for example, "CILAS granulometer model 920", tradename, manufactured by CILAS is used. Water and a sample are mixed, followed by dispersion treatment by an ultrasonic homogenizer at an output of 200 W for one<br>
minute, and then measurement is conducted. The particle size distribution is measured with the particle size channels of 0.3 µm, 1 µm, 1.5 µm, 2 µm, 3 µm, 4 µm, 6 µm, 8 µm, 12 µm, 16 µm, 24 µm, 32 µm, 48 µm, 64 µm, 96  µm, 128 µm and 196 µm.<br>
In the present invention, the amorphous ratio is determined from the intensity ratio of a specific diffraction peak obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis using a powder X-ray diffraction apparatus {e.g. "Model Mini Flex", tradename, manufactured by RIGAKU) within a range of 2 of from 26° to 27.5° of CuKα rays. In the case of a silica powder, a main peak is present at 26.7° with respect to crystalline silica, but no peak is present with respect to the amorphous silica. When amorphous silica and crystalline silica coexist, a peak<br>
height at 26.7° in accordance with the ratio of crystalline silica is obtained, and accordingly from the ratio of the X-ray intensity of a sample to the X-ray intensity of a crystalline silica standard sample, the ratio of crystalline silica (X-ray diffraction intensity of the sample/X-ray diffraction intensity of crystalline silica) is calculated to determine the amorphous ratio from the formula: amorphous ratio (%) = (1-ratio of crystalline silica)x100, The amorphous silica powder of the present invention has an amorphous ratio measured by the above method of preferably at least 95%.<br>
The average sphericity of the amorphous silica<br>
powder of the present invention is preferably at least 0.85, particularly preferably from 0.87 to 1.00, whereby the viscosity of the composition will further decrease, and moldability will further improve. The average sphericity is determined as follows. An image of a particle photographed by e.g. a stereoscopic microscope (e.g. "Model SMZ-10", tradename, manufactured by Nikon Corporation) is brought in an image analyzer (e.g. wMacView", tradename, manufactured by MOUNTEC CO., LTD.), and the project area (A) and the perimeter (PM) of the particle are measured from the photograph. Where the area of a circle corresponding to the perimeter (PM) is (B) , the roundness of the particle is A/B. Assuming a circle having the same perimeter as the perimeter (PM) of the sample, since PM=2nr and B=nr2, B=nx(PM/2n)2, and the roundness of each particle is such that roundness=A/B=Ax4n/(PM)2.  In the present invention, roundnesses of 200 optional particles are determined, and the square of the average is regarded as the average sphericity.<br>
Now, the process for producing the amorphous silica powder of the present invention will be described. In the present invention, a blended powder of 100 parts by mass of a silica powder having an average particle size of at most 300 urn and from 0..01 to 25 parts by mass of an Al source powder (e,g, an aluminum powder, an aluminum oxide powder or an aluminum hydroxide powder) containing<br>
aluminum as the constituent and having an average particle size of at most 30 µm, is used. If the average particle size of the silica powder exceeds 300 µm, the grinding and mixing with the Al source powder will not homogeneously be carried out in some cases. The average particle size of the silica powder is preferably at most 200 µm, more preferably at most 100 µm. On the other hand, if the average particle size of the Al source powder exceeds 30 µm, mixing with the silica powder will be inhomogeneous, and formation of the Lewis acid sites of the amorphous silica powder to be produced may be small. The average particle size of the Al source powder is preferably at most 15 µm, more preferably at most 10 µm.<br>
If the ratio of the Al source powder blended is out of the range of from 0.01 to 25 parts by mass, it will be difficult to control the Al component of the amorphous silica powder to be. from 0.03 to 20 mass% as calculated as A12O3. The Al source powder is particularly preferably an aluminum oxide powder from the viewpoint of safety and handling in grinding and mixing.<br>
In the present invention, the blended powder is ground and mixed to prepare a powder mixture finner by at least 3 0%, preferably by at least 50% than the average particle size of the blended powder. The powder mixture has shear force imparted and,its mixed state is reinforced by mechanochemical reaction, and accordingly<br>
when the powder mixture is injected into a flame, the Al source powder supported on the silica powder surface is less likely to be released, whereby production of the amorphous silica powder of the present invention will be very easy. As the grinding and mixing apparatus, a ball mill, a vibrating mill, a bead mill or the like is used. As the form of the grinding and mixing, either dry method or wet method using a medium such as pure water or an organic solvent may be employed, but dry method is employed when emphasis is put on mass productivity.<br>
As a method of treating the powder mixture with a flame, followed by classification as the case requires, for example, a furnace body equipped with a burner, to which a collecting apparatus is connected, is used. The furnace body may be either of an open type or a closed type, or either vertical or horizontal. The collecting apparatus is provided with at least one of a gravity settling chamber, a cyclone, a bag filter and an electric dust collector, and by changing the collecting conditions, an amorphous silica powder classified into the desired particle size can be collected. As examples, JP-A-11-57451 and JP-A-11-71107 may be mentioned.<br>
Further, in the present invention, the particle size distribution and the average particle size of the amorphous silica powder can be increased or reduced e.g. by the particle size distribution of the powder mixture to be subjected to flame treatment or the classification<br>
conditions of the flame treated product. Further, the average sphericity and the content as calculated as A12O3 can be increased or decreased, respectively by e.g. the amount of the powder mixture supplied to the flame and the flame temperature, and by the ratio of the Al source powder blended. Further, it is also possible to produce an amorphous silica powder having the average particle size, the amorphous ratio, the content as calculated as A12O3 or the like further specified, by producing various amorphous silica powders differing in the particle size distribution, the average particle size, the content as calculated as Al2O3 or the like, and properly mixing two or more of them, followed by classification as the case requires. When the amorphous silica powder is divided according to the average particle size into two powders, for example, a vibrating sieve having a wire mesh with a predetermined aperture set may be used.<br>
The composition of the present invention comprises the amorphous silica powder of the present invention incorporated in at least one of a resin and a rubber. The content of the amorphous silica powder in the composition is preferably from 10 to 99 mass%, particularly preferably from 15 to 90 mass%.<br>
As the resin, an epoxy resin, a silicone resin, a phenol resin, a melamine resin, a urea resin, an unsaturated polyester, a fluororesin, a polyamide such as a polyimide, a polyamideimide or a polyetherimide, a<br>

However, it should be understand that the present invention is by no means restricted to such specific Examples. In the present invention, the part(s) means part{s) by mass and % means mass%, unless otherwise specified. EXAMPLES 1 to 5 and COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 to 5<br>
From 0 to 30 parts of an aluminum oxide powder having an average particle size of from 5.2 to 39 µm was blended with 100 parts of a silica powder having an average particle size of from 75 to 350 µm, and a powder mixture finner by from 21 to 95% than the average particle size of the original blended powder was produced by using a ball mill (Model 1000L-PBM, manufactured by ASADA IRON WORKS, CO., LTD.) . The powder mixture was<br>
subjected to flame treatment as shown in the following (a) to (e) using an apparatus disclosed in JP-A-11-57451, followed by classification to produce various spherical amorphous silica powders.<br>
Namely, ten spherical amorphous silica powder intermediates (i) to (x) as identified in Table 1 were produced by adjusting (a) the average particle size (75 to 350 µm) of the raw material powder, (b) the grinding and mixing conditions (a ball mill having silicon nitride balls of 20 mm in diameter packed in an amount of 30 vol% based on the mill volume, with a rotational number of from 10 to 120 rpm), (c). the amount of the powder mixture supplied to the flame {300' to 500 kg/hr), {d) flame formation conditions (60 to 80 m3/hr of LPG and 250 to 400 m3/hr of oxygen) and (e) classification conditions (cyclone inlet flow rate of 5 to 30 m/s) , Further, these silica powder intermediates (i) to (x) were respectively blended as identified in Table 2 to produce amorphous silica powders (A) to (J).<br>
The average particle size and the particle size distribution of the amorphous silica powder were adjusted by changing (f) the average particle size of the powder mixture to be subjected ,to flame treatment to make the powder spherical, and (g) the conditions of multi-stage sieving of the powder treated to make it spherical, and the mixing amount of coarse particles, medium particles and fine particles recovered by the sieving operation.<br>
Further, the Al concentration and the Al-distributed silica powder within a certain particle size range of the amorphous silica powder were controlled by changing (h) the particle size and the blend ratio of the aluminum oxide powder to be blended every particle size of the raw material powder. The average sphericity was controlled by adjusting (d) the flame formation conditions and (c) the amount of the powder mixture supplied to the flame.<br>
All the obtained spherical amorphous silica powders A to J had an amorphous ratio of at least 99.5%, and had an average particle size and a content as calculated as A12O3 as identified in Table 2.<br>
Further, using a vibrating sieve having a wire mesh with an aperture at the same size as the average particle size of each of the spherical amorphous silica powders A to J, the silica powder was divided according to each average particle size into two powders i.e. a powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size and a powder having a particle size smaller than the average particle size. The content as calculated as Al2O3 of the former (AL) and the content as calculated as AI2O3 of the latter (AS), and AS/AL are shown in Table 2. Further, with respect to each sample of a powder having a particle size larger than the average particle size of each of the spherical amorphous silica powders A to J, the ratio of the content as calculated as A12O3 at a portion of from the particle surface to a depth of 1 µm,<br>
to the content as calculated as Al203 at a portion with a depth exceeding 1 urn of particles having a particle size larger than the average particle size, was calculated from the intensity ratio of aluminum element measured by X-ray microanalyzer (EPMA) OXA-8200 manufactured by JEOL Ltd. and shown in Table 2.<br>
Further, the particle size distribution of each of the spherical amorphous silica powders A to J was measured to determine the average particle size, the cumulative value up to 12 µm, the cumulative value up to 24 µm and the cumulative value up to 64 µm. Further, the A12O3 content and the average sphericity were obtained. The cumulative value up to 12 µm, the cumulative value up to 24 µm and the cumulative value up to 64 µm respectively as Cl, C2 and C3 are shown in Table 2.<br>
To evaluate properties of the spherical amorphous silica powders as a sealing material for semiconductors, to 86 parts of each of the spherical amorphous silica powders A to J, 4.5 parts of a 4,4'-bis(2,3-epoxypropoxy)-3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbiphenyl epoxy resin, 4.0 parts of a phenol resin, 0.2 part of triphenylphosphine, 0.5 part of phenylaminosilane, 0.3 part of carbon black and 0.5 part of carnauba wax were added, followed by dry blending by a Henschel mixer, and then the blended product was heat kneaded by a parallel matching twin screw extruder {screw diameter D: 25 mm, kneading disk length: 10 Dmm, number of revolution of<br>
paddle: 80 to 120 rpm, discharge amount: 3.0 kg/h, and temperature of the kneaded product: 99 to 101°C) . The kneaded product (discharged product) was cooled by a cooling pressing machine and then ground to produce a sealing material for semiconductors, and the HTSL properties, HTOL properties and the moldability (spiral flow) were evaluated as follows. The results are shown in Table 2,<br>
(1)	HTSL properties<br>
Using a transfer molding machine, a TEG-ML1020 chip was mounted on S0P-28p (made of lead frame 42 alloy), and the lead frame and the chip were connected with respect to 8 points by a gold wire of 40 µm in diameter, followed by packaging by the sealing material for semiconductors, and the package was after-cured at 175°C for 8 hours to prepare 20 simulation semiconductors. These simulation semiconductors were stored at 195°C for 1,500 hours and then cooled to room temperature, and then presence or absence of power distribution was measured. The number of the simulation semiconductors with failure in power distribution in at least one wiring among 8 wirings was counted.<br>
(2)	HTOL properties<br>
20 Simulation semiconductors were prepared in the same manner as for evaluation of the HTSL properties, and a direct current of 0.5A was applied while they were stored at 195°C for 100 hours. The number of the<br>
simulation semiconductors of which the electric resistance among wirings increased by 3 0% than the initial value was measured.<br>
(3) Spiral flow<br>
Using a transfer molding machine having a mold for measuring spiral flow attached thereto in accordance with EMMI-I-66 (epoxy molding material institute, society of plastic industry),  the spiral flow value of the sealing material for semiconductors was measured. The transfer molding conditions were such that the mold temperature: 175°C, the molding pressure: 7.4 MPa and the holding time: 90 seconds.<br>
