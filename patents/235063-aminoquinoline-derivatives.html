AMINOQUINOLINE DERIVATIVES AND THEIR USE AS ADENOSINE A3 LIGANDS<br>
The present invention relates to the adenosine A3 receptor ligands of<br>
the general formula (I), within those preferably to the antagonists, as well as<br>
to their salts, solvates and isomers (tautomers, desmotrops, optically active<br>
isomers), to the pharmaceutical compositions containing them, to the use of<br>
the compounds of the general formula (I) and their salts, solvates and<br>
isomers, to the preparation of the compounds of the general formula (I) and<br>
their salts, solvates and isomers, to the partly novel intermediates of the<br>
general formula (II"), (III"), (IV"), (V"), (VI"), (VII"), (VIII") and (XIII")<br>
and to the preparation thereof.<br>
Adenosine is a well-known component of several endogenous<br>
molecules (ATP, NAD+, nucleic acids). It plays an important regulatory<br>
role in many physiological processes. The effect of adenosine on the heart<br>
function was described already in 1929 (Drury and Szentgyörgyi, Physio!.<br>
68:213, 1929). The identification of an increasing number of physiological<br>
functions mediated by adenosine and the discovery of new adenosine<br>
receptor subtypes are offering possibilities for the therapeutic application of<br>
specific ligands (Poulse, S. A. and Quinn, R. J. Bioorganic and Medicinal<br>
Chemistry 6:619, 1998).<br>
To date, the receptors for adenosine have been classified into three<br>
main classes: A1, A2 and A3. The A1 subtype is partly responsible for the<br>
inhibition of the adenylate cyclase by coupling to G1 membrane protein, and<br>
partly influences other second messenger systems. The A2 receptor subtype<br>
can be subdivided into two further subtypes - A2a and A2b -, which<br>
stimulate the adenylate cyclase activity. The sequence of the adenosine A3<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2005/009969	PCT/HU2004/000080<br>
receptors have been first identified from rat testis cDNA library. Later it<br>
was proved that it corresponds to a novel, functional adenosine receptor.<br>
The activation of the A3 receptors is also connected with several second-<br>
messenger systems: inhibiting of adenylate cyclase, stimulating<br>
phospholipase C and D.<br>
The adenosine receptors are found in several organs and regulate<br>
their functions. Both A1 and A2a receptors play important role in the central<br>
nervous system and cardiovascular system. In the CNS, the adenosine<br>
inhibits the release of synaptic transmitters which effect is mediated by A1<br>
receptors. In the heart, the A1 receptors also mediate the negative inotropic,<br>
chronotropic and dromotropic effects of adenosine. The adenosine A2a<br>
receptors, which are located in a relatively high amount in the striatum,<br>
display functional interaction with the dopamine receptors in regulating the<br>
synaptic transmission. The A2a adenosine receptors on endothelial and<br>
smooth muscle cells are responsible for adenosine-induced vasodilation.<br>
On the basis of RNA identification, the A2b adenosine receptors are<br>
widely distributed in different tissues. They have been identified in almost<br>
every cell type, but its expression is the highest in the intestine and the<br>
bladder. This subtype probably also has important regulatory function in<br>
the regulation of the vascular tone and plays a role in the function of mast<br>
cells.<br>
Contrary to A1 and A2a receptors, where the tissue distribution was<br>
detected on the protein level, the presence of A2b and A3 receptors was<br>
detected on the basis of their mRNA level. Expression levels for A3<br>
adenosine receptors are rather low compared to other subtypes and they are<br>
highly species dependent. A3 adenosine receptors are expressed primarily<br>
in the central nervous system, in the testis and in the immune system, and<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/00969	PCT/HU2004/000080<br>
appear to be involved in the modulation of the mediator release from the<br>
mast cells in immediate hypersensitivity reaction.<br>
For therapeutic use, it is essential to ensure that the molecule does<br>
not bind, or binds only in the case of very high concentration to the A1, A2a<br>
and A2b sub-types of the adenosine receptor.<br>
Our present invention relates to the compounds of the general<br>
formula.(I) as well as their salts, solvates and isomers, which have high<br>
selectivity for the A3 sub-type of the adenosine receptor.<br>
A3 antagonists published so far in the literature, belong to the groups<br>
of flavonoides, 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives, triazoloquinazolines,<br>
thiazolonaphthyridines and thiazolopyrimidines. Most of the effective and<br>
for the adenosine subtypes selective antagonists, however posses strong<br>
lipophilic character, and they are therefore sparingly soluble in water. This<br>
feature hinders the in vivo applicability of the compounds. In the literature<br>
more and more studies are to find aiming the preparation of water soluble<br>
adenosine A3 receptor antagonists (Ch. E. Miiller et ai., J. Med. Chem.<br>
45:3440, 2002; A. Maconi et al., J. Med. Chem. 45:3579, 2002).<br>
Patent application WO 02/096879 discloses 2-amino-3-<br>
cyanoquinoline derivatives as structurally novel type, effective A3<br>
antagonists. The compounds of the formula (1) described in patent<br>

These compounds too, have the characteristic disadvantage that they<br>
are only sparingly soluble, which hampers their development into a drug.<br>
Our aim was to prepare A3 ligands, within them preferably<br>
antagonists, with quinoline structure, which exert strong antagonistic effect<br>
and high selectivity for the A3 receptor, i.e. they inhibit the A3 receptor in<br>
much lower concentration than they inhibit the A1 A2a and A2b receptors.<br>
Further aims were to have stability, bioavailability, therapeutic index,<br>
toxicity and solubility data, which enable these new compounds to develop<br>
into drug substances, and that the new compounds possess favourable<br>
enteric absorption to be applied orally.<br>

Results<br>
We consider the compounds as biologically active ones if they inhibit<br>
the binding of the radioligand on human adenosine A3 receptors with an<br>
activity above 80 % at 1 uM in our experimental conditions.<br>
The dissociation constant (Kd) of [125I]AB-MECA on CHO-hA3<br>
membrane preparation is determined by isotope saturation studies with the<br>
help of Scatchard analysis (G. Scatchard, Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 51:660,<br>
1949). The IC50 is converted to an affinity constant (Ki) by application of the<br>
Cheng-Prusoff equation (Y. J. Cheng and W. H. Prusoff, Biochem.<br>
Pharmacol. 22:3099, 1973).<br>
A number of the compounds of the general formula (I) displayed<br>
remarkable biological effects. The most active compounds of the general<br>
formula (I) were those defined in claims 2-4. Especially advantageous are the<br>
compounds given in the Examples, their Ki values are in the range of 0.5 nM<br>
and 900 nM, preferably 0.5 nM and 700 nM. Ki values of the most<br>

0.5 and 15nM.<br>
59<br><br>
WO 20005/009969	PCT/HU2004/000080<br>
The compounds possess good bioavailability and a selectivity of at<br>
least 3 order of magnitude, in respect to the human adenosine A1, A2a and A2b<br>
receptor subtypes.<br>
Further, the duration of their action at intravenous and oral<br>
administration is long, their ED50 values are low, their toxicological and side-<br>
effect profiles are advantageous.<br>
These above data are favourable for the therapeutic application of the<br>
compounds of the general formula (I).<br>
