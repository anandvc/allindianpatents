Back2rouDd of the Invention<br>
Atherosclerosis and other peripheral vascular diseases affect the quality of life of millions of people. Therefore, considerable attention has been directed towards understanding the etiology of hypercholesterolemia and hyperlipidemia and development of effective therapeutic strategies.<br>
Statins and fibrates are the more widely used drugs for the treatment of the hj/perlipidemia. Statins act via HMG CoA reductase enzyme there by cholesterol biosynthesis. The predominant effect of statins is lowering the levels of LDL cholesterols (LDL-C). Fibrates another class of hyperlipidemic compounds are known to be weak agonist of Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor (PPAR)-a subtypes. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) are members of the nuclear receptor super family. The ganmia (Y) isoform of PPAR (PPARy) has been implicated in regulating differentiation of adipocytes (Endocrinology. 135 (1994) 798-800) and energy homeostasis (Cell, 83 (1995) 803-812), whereas the alpha (a) isoform of PPAR (PPARa) mediates fatty acid oxidation (Trend Endocrin. Metab., 4 (1993) 291-296) thereby resulting in reduction of circutaung free fatty acid in plasma (Current Biol. 5 (1995) 618-621). PPARa agonists have been found useful for the treatment of obesity (WO 97/36579), A wealth of information exists on the influence of fibrates as PPAR-a agonists on the cardiovascular risk profile. These compounds correct atherogenic dyslipoproteinemia. Several angiographic intervention trials show a decreases incidence of cardiovascular events (Trends in Pharmaceutical Sciences 2001, 22(9), 441-443). It has been recently disclosed that compounds, which are agonists for both PPARa and PPARy are suggested to be useful for the treatment of syndrome X (WO 97/25042). Similar effect between the insulin sensitizer (PPARy agonist) and HMG CoA reductase inhibitor has been observed which may be useful for the treatment of atherosclerosis and xanthoma (EP 0 753 298).<br>
It is known that PPARy plays an important role in adipocyte differentiation (Cell. 87 (1996) 377-389). Ligand activation of PPAR is sufficient to cause complete terminal differentiation {Cell, 79 (1994) 1147-1156) including cell cycle withdrawal. PPARy is consistently expressed in certain cells and activation of this nuclear receptor with PPARy agonists would stimulate the terminal differentiation of adipocyte precursors and cause morphological and molecular changes characteristics of a more differentiated, less malignant state {Molecular Cell, (1998), 465-470; Carcinogenesis, (1998), 1949-53; Proc. Natl. Acad Sci.. 94 (1997) 237-241) and inhibition of expression of prostate cancer tissue (Cancer<br><br>
Research 58 (1998) 3344-3352).   This would be useful in the treatment of certain types of cancer, which express PPARy and could lead to a quite nontoxic chemotherapy.<br>
Hypercholesterolemia has been defined as plasma cholesterol level that exceeds arbitrarily defined value called "normal" level. Recently, it has been accepted that "ideal" plasma levels of cholesterol are much below the "normal" level of cholesterol in the general population and the risk of coronary arteiy disease (CAD) increases as cholesterol level rises above the "optimum" (or "ideal") value. There is clearly a definite cause and effect-relationship between hypercholesterolemia and CAD, particularly for individuals with multiple risk factors. Most of the cholesterol is present in the esterified forms with various lipoproteins such as Low density lipoprotein (LDL), Intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), High density lipoprotein (HDL) and partially as Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). Studies clearly indicate that there is an inverse correlationship between CAD and atherosclerosis with serum HDL-cholesterol concentrations (Stampfer el al, N. Engl. J. Med., 325 (1991), 373-381). The risk of CAD increases with increasing levels of LDL and VLDL.<br>
Atherosclerosis coronary artery disease is fast becoming a major cause for mortality both the developing and developed tiations. It has been demonstrated that abnormal cholesterol levels play a major role for morbidity and mortality, and aggressive treatment saves lives. Clinical trials have demonstrated convincing benefits of cholesterol lowering, for reducing myo cardial infarction among patients with CHD as well as for decreasing the incidents of cardiac events in patients without established coronary disease {JAMA 2001, 285 (19). 2508-2509).<br>
In CAD, generally "fatty streaks" in carotid, coronary and cerebral arteries, are found which are primarily free and esterified cholesterol. Miller el al. (Br. Med. J., 282 (19S1), 1741-1744) have shown that mcrease in HDL-particles may decrease the number of sites of stenosis in coronary arteries of human, and high level of HDL-cholesterol may protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. Picardo ef al.. Arteriosclerosis 6 (1986) 434-441 have shown by in vitro experiment that HDL is capable of removing cholesterol from cells. They suggest that HDL may deplete tissues of excess free cholesterol and transfer it to liver, which is known as reverse cholesterol transport, (Macikinnon et al., J. Biol. chem. 261 (1986), 2548-2552). Therefore, agents that increase HDL cholesterol would have therapeutic significance for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary heart diseases (CHD).<br>
Obesity is a disease highly prevalent in affluent societies and in the developing world and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. It is a state of excess body fat accumulation.<br><br>
The causes of obesity are unclear. It is believed to be of genetic origin or promoted by an interaction between the genotype and environment. Irrespective of the cause, the result is fat deposition due to imbalance between the energy intake versus energy expenditure. Dieting, exercise and appetite suppression have been a part of obesity treatment. There is a need for efficient therapy to fight this disease since it may lead to coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, hyperlipidemia, gout, osteoarthritis, reduced fertility and many other psychological and social problems.<br>
Diabetes and/or insulin resistance is yet another disease which severely effects the quality of large population in the world. Insulin resistance is the diminished ability of insulin to exert its biological action across a broad range of concentrations. In insulin resistance, the body secretes abnormally high amounts of insulin to compensate for this defect; failing which, the plasma glucose concentration inevitably raises and develops into diabetes. Among the developed countries, diabetes mellitus is a common problem and is associated with a variety of abnormalities including obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia {J. Clin. Invest., 75 (1985) 809-817; A". Â£Â«Â£/. J, Med 317 (19^7) 350-357; J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab., 66 (1988) 580-583; J. Clin. Invest.. 68 (1975) 957 - 969) and other renal complications (patent publication No. WO 95/21608). It is now increasingly being recognized that insulin resistance and relative hyperinsulmemia have a contributory role in obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The association of insulin resistance with obesity, hypertension and angina has been described as a syndrome having insulin resistance as the centra! pathogenic link-Syndrome-X.<br>
Hyperlipidemia is the primary cause for cardiovascular (CVD) and other peripheral vascular diseases. High risk of CVD is related to the higher LDL (Low Density Lipoprotein) and VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoprotein) seen in hyperlipidemia. Patients having glucose intolerance/insulin resistance in addition to hyperlipidemia have higher risk of CVD. Numerous studies in the past have shown that lowering of plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol, in particular LDL and VLDL and increasing HDL cholesterol help in preventing cardiovascular diseases.<br>
Leptin resistance is a condition wherein the target cells are unable to respond to leptin signal. This may give rise to obesity due to excess food intake and reduced energy expenditure and cause impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and such other mterrelaled complications. Kallen et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. (1996) 93, 5793-5796) have reported that insulin sensitizers which perhaps due to the PPAR agonist expression lower plasma leptin concentrations.  However, it has been recently disclosed that<br><br>
compounds having insulin sensitizing property also possess leptin sensitization activity. They lower the circulating plasma leptin concentrations by improving the target ceil response to leptin (WO 98/02159).<br>
Fibrates are a class of drugs which may lower serum triglycerides, lower LDL-C, shift the LDL particle size from the more atherogenic small dense to normal dense LDL-C and increase the HDL-C. Experimental evidence indicate that the effects of fibrates on senmi lipids are mediated through activation of PPAR-a (Curr. Pharm. Des.. 1-14. 3(1). 1997). Activation of PPAR-a results in transcription of enzymes that increases fatty acids catabolism and decrease denovo fatty acid synthesis in the liver resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis in the liver resulting in decreased triglyceride synthesis and VLDL-C production. PPAR-a ligands may be useful for the treatment of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disorders (Curr.Opin. Lipido.. 1999, 10, 245-257).<br><br><br><br><br>

(B)      In vivo<br>
(a)       Efficacy in genetic models<br>
Mutation in colonies of laboratory animals and different sensitivities to dietary regimens have made the development of animal models with non-insulin dependent diabetes and hyperlipidemia associated with obesity and insulin resistance possible. Genetic models such as db/db and ob/ob (Diabetes, (1982) 31(1) : 1- 6) mice and zucker fa/fa rats have been developed by the various laboratories for understanding the pathophysiology of disease and testing the efficacy of new antidiabetic compounds (Diabetes, (1983) 32: 830-838; Annu. Rep. Sankyo Res. Lab. (1994). 46 ; 1-57). The homozygous animals, C57 BL/KsJ-db/db mice developed by Jackson Laboratory, US, are obese, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic and<br><br>
insulin resistant (J. Clin. Invest., (1990) 85 : 962-967), whereas heterozygous are lean and normoglycemic. In db/db model, mouse progressively develops insulinopenia with age, a feature commonly observed in late stages of human type II diabetes when blood sugar levels are insufficiently controlled. The state of pancreas and its course vary according to the models. Since this model resembles diat of type 11 diabetes mellitus, the compounds of the present invention will be tested for blood sugar and triglycerides lowering activities.<br>
Male C57BL/KsJ-db/db mice of 8 to 14 weeks age, having body weight range of 35 to 60 grams, bred at Dr. Reddy"s Research Foundation (DRF) animal house, were used in the experiment. The mice are provided with standard feed (National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad, India) and acidified water, ad libitum. The animals having more than 350 mg / dl blood sugar will be used for testing. The number of animals in each group will be 4.<br>
Test compounds are suspended on 0.25% carboxymethyl cellulose and administered to test group at a dose of 0.1 mg to 30 mg / kg through oral gavage daily for 6 days. The control group receives vehicle (dose 10 ml / kg). On 6th day the blood samples will be collected one hour after administration of test compounds / vehicle for assessing the biological activity.<br>
The random blood sugar and triglyceride levels can be measured by collecting blood (100 (il) through orbital sinus, using heparinised capillary in tubes containing EDTA which was centrifuged to obtain plasma. The plasma glucose and triglyceride levels can be measured spectrometrically, by glucose oxidase and glycerol-3-P04 oxidase/peroxidase enzyme (Dr. Reddy"s Lab. Diagnostic Division Kits, Hyderabad, India) methods respectively.<br>

The test compounds can be administered orally at a dose 0.1 to 30 mg/kg/day for 3 days. Control group was treated with vehicle alone (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples can be collected in fed state 1 hour after drug administration on 0 and 3 day of compound treatment. The blood can be collected from the retro-orbital sinus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifugation, plasma sample will be separated for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride estimations. Measurement of plasina triglyceride, total cholesterol and HDL are were done using commercial kits (Dr. Reddy"s Laboratory, Diagnostic Division, India). LDL and VLDL cholesterol can be calculated from the data obtained for total cholesterol, HDL and triglyceride. The reduction of various parameters examined are calculated according to the formula.<br><br>

Animals are given standard laboratory chow (NIN, Hyderabad, India) and water, ad libitum. SAM of 20 - 25 g body weight range and Guinea pigs of 500 - 700 g body weight range are used (Oliver, P., Plancke, M. O., Marzin, D., Clavey, V., Sauzieres, J and Fruchart, J. C. Effects of fenofibrate, gemfibrozil and nicotinic acid on plasma lipoprotein levels in normal and hyperlipidemic mice. Atherosclerosis. 1988. 70 : 107 - 114).<br>
The test compounds can be administered orally to Swiss albino mice at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control mice are treated with vehicle (0.25% CarboxjTnethylcellulose; dose 10 ml/kg). The test compoimds are administered orally to<br><br>
Guinea pigs at 0.3 to 30 mg/kg/day dose for 6 days. Control animals are treated with vehicle (0.25% Carboxymethylcellulose; dose 5 ml/kg).<br>
The blood samples can be collected in fed state I hour after drug administration on 0 and 6 day of treatment. The blood can be collected from the retro-orbital smus through heparinised capillary in EDTA containing tubes. After centrifijgation, plasma sample was separated for triglyceride (Wieland, O. Methods of Enzymatic analysis. Bergermeyer, H. O., Ed., 1963. 21! - 214; Trinder, P. Ann. Clin. Biochem. 1969. 6: 24 - 27).
