				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to pharmaceutical<br>
preparations in the form of aqueous solutions for the<br>
production of propellant-free aerosols for inhalation.<br>
In the last 20 years, the use of dosage aerosols has<br>
become a strong part of the therapy of obstructive lung<br>
diseases, especially asthma. Usually, fluorochlorohydrocarbons<br>
are used as propellant gases. Following the<br>
recognition of the ozone damaging potential of these<br>
propellant gases, attempts to develop alternatives have<br>
increased. One alternative is the development of<br>
nebulisers, where aqueous solutions of pharmacologically<br>
active substance are sprayed under high pressure so that a<br>
mist of inhalable particles results. The advantage of<br>
these nebulisers is that they completely dispense with the<br>
use of propellant gases.<br>
Such nebulisers are, for example, described in PCT Patent<br>
Application W091/14468, herein incorporated by reference.<br>
With the nebulisers described here, active ingredients<br>
solutions in defined volumes are sprayed through small<br>
jets under high pressure, so that inhalable aerosols with<br>
a mean particle size of between 3 and 10 micrometers<br>
result. A further developed embodiment of the<br>
aforementioned nebuliser is described in PCT/EP96/04351.<br>
The nebuliser portrayed in Figure 6 carries the trade mark<br>
Respimat®.<br>
Usually, Pharmaceuticals intended for inhalation are<br>
dissolved in an aqueous or ethanolic solution, and<br>
according to the solution characteristics of the active<br>
substances, solvent mixtures of water and ethanol may also<br>
be suitable.<br>
Other components of the solvent are, apart from water<br>
and/or ethanol, optionally other cosolvents, and also the<br>
pharmaceutical preparation may also additionally contain<br>
flavourings and other pharmacological additives. Examples<br>
of cosolvents are those which contain hydroxyl groups or<br>
other polar groups, for example alcohols - especially<br>
isopropylalcohol, glycols - especially propyleneglycol,<br>
polyethyleneglycol, polypropyleneglycol, glycolether,<br>
glycerol, polyoxyethylene alcohols and polyoxyethylene<br>
fatty acid esters. Cosolvents are suitable for increasing<br>
the solubility of adjuvant materials and, if necessary,<br>
active ingredients.<br>
The proportion of dissolved pharmaceutical in the finished<br>
pharmaceutical preparation is between 0.001 and 30% -<br>
preferably between 0.05 and 3%, especially 0.01 to 2%.<br>
The maximum concentration of pharmaceutical is dependent<br>
on the solubility in solvent and on the dosage required to<br>
achieve the desired therapeutical effect.<br>
All substances which are suitable for application by<br>
inhalation and which are soluble in the specified solvent<br>
can be used as Pharmaceuticals in the new preparations.<br>
Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of diseases of the<br>
respiratory passages are of especial interest.<br>
Therefore, of especial interest are betamimetics,<br>
anticholinergics, antiallergics, antihistamines and<br>
steroids, as well as combinations of these active<br>
ingredients.<br>
It was found, in a series of examinations, that the<br>
nebuliser described above can feature spraying anomalies<br>
when using aqueous pharmaceutical solutions (generally,<br>
double distilled or demineralised (ion exchanged) water is<br>
used as a solvent). These spraying anomalies represent an<br>
alteration of the spraying pattern of the aerosol, with<br>
the consequence that in extreme cases an exact dose can no<br>
longer be guaranteed to the patient as a result of the<br>
altered mean droplet size distribution (alteration to the<br>
lung accessible part of the aerosol). These spraying<br>
anomalies especially occur when the nebuliser is used at<br>
intervals, for example with breaks of approximately 3 or<br>
more days between utilisation. It is possible that these<br>
spraying anomalies, which in extreme cases can lead to a<br>
dysfunction of the nebuliser, are as a result of<br>
microscopic deposits in the area of the jet opening.<br>
Surprisingly, it was discovered that these spraying<br>
anomalies no longer occur when the aqueous pharmaceutical<br>
preparations which are to be sprayed contain a defined<br>
effective quantity of a complexing agent, especially of<br>
EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) or salts thereof.<br>
The aqueous pharmaceutical preparations according to the<br>
invention contain water as a solvent, but if necessary<br>
ethanol can be added to increase the solubility up to 70%<br>
(by volume), preferably between 30 and 60% (by volume).<br>
Other pharmacological adjuvants such as preservatives,<br>
especially benzalkonium chloride, can be added. The<br>
preferred quantity of preservative, especially<br>
benzalkonium chloride, is between 8 and 12 mg/100 ml<br>
solution.<br>
Suitable complexing agents are those which are<br>
pharmacologically acceptable, especially those which are<br>
already approved by medical regulating authorities. EDTA,<br>
nitrilotriacetic acid, citric acid and ascorbic acid and<br>
their salts are especially suitable. The disodium salt of<br>
ethylenediamtetraacetic acid is especially preferred.<br>
The quantity of complexing agent is selected so that an<br>
effective quantity of complexing agent is added to prevent<br>
further occurrence of spraying anomalies.<br>
The effective quantity of the complexing agent Na-EDTA is<br>
between 10 and 1000 mg/100 ml solution, especially between<br>
10 and 100 mg/100 ml solution. The preferred range of the<br>
quantity of complexing agent is between 25 and<br>
75 mg/100 ml solution, especially between 25 and<br>
50 mg/100 ml solution.<br>
The following named compounds can principally be used as<br>
active ingredients, singly or in combination, in the<br>
aqueous pharmaceutical preparation according to the<br>
invention. In individual cases, it may be required to add<br>
a higher quantity of ethanol or a solution mediator to<br>
improve solubility.<br>

to the invention if necessary.<br>
In the following text, the advantage of the pharmaceutical<br>
preparation according to the invention will be explained<br>
more clearly with Examples.<br>
As a pharmaceutical solution, Ipratropium bromide solution<br>
(c = 333 mg/100 ml) with a pH value of 3.4, and the<br>
preservative benzalkonium chloride (c = 10 mg/100 ml) was<br>
used. The tested solutions either contained no EDTA or<br>
EDTA in a concentration of c = 0.1 mg, 1 mg, 50 mg and<br>
75 mg/100 ml as a disodium salt.<br>
Unused Respimat® nebulisers were used for the test<br>
(technical data: volumes of the applied pharmaceutical<br>
preparation approximately 15 l, pressure approximately<br>
300 bar, 2 streams impacting from two jet openings of size<br>
5 x 8 µl. The operation mode for the test is set so that<br>
the units are used 5 times, are left to stand for 3 days,<br>
and then are used again 5 times, this pattern being<br>
repeated. 15 units were examined in each series of<br>
measurements, the results with regard to spray anomalies are shown in Table 1.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Formulation Examples (for Fenoterol and Ipatropium bromide)<br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
In analogy to the above Examples, the following solutions were produced.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In the form of the disodium salt<br>
A concentration range from 10 mg to 20,000 mg/100 ml is<br>
conceivable for the active ingredients, depending on the<br>
dose per operation and their solubility. The specified<br>
doses are calculated based on a therapeutically effective<br>
single dose of approximately 12 microlitres per operation.<br>
The active ingredient concentrations of the pharmaceutical<br>
preparations can alter when the volume of the individual<br>
dose is altered.<br>
The concentration range for the complexing agents (for<br>
example DiNa-EDTA) is between 10 and 1000 mg/100 ml<br>
(dependent on the pH value of the solution). The<br>
preferred range is between 25 mg and 100 mg/100 ml.<br>
The quantity of benzalkonium chloride should be in the<br>
range of 8 to 12 mg/100 ml.<br>
The solutions are set to a pH of 3.2 to 3.4 with 0.1 or IN<br>
HCl. All concentrations relate to 100 ml of finished<br>
active ingredient solution.<br><br><br><br><br>
