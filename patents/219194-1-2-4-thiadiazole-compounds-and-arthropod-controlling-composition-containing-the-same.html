The present invention relates to 1,2,4-thiadiazole compounds and arthropod controlling composition containing the same.<br>
While various pesticide compositions have been used for the purpose of controlling arthropod pests such as insect pests, acarine pests and the like, sometimes the effect of those pesticide compositions is not always enough, and therefore the development of novel arthropod controlling compositions having enough effect is desired.<br>
It is an objective of the present invention to provide novel compounds having a arthropod controlling effect, arthropod controlling compositions containing the same compounds, and methods for controlling arthropods applying effective dose of the same compounds to pests or their habitat.<br>
The document DE 3030661 discloses the 1,2,4-thiadiazole compound having an alkynyloxy group at the 5-position of the thiadiazole ring (substituted at the carbon atom between the nitrogen and sulfur atoms) as seen from page 39 of the cited document. The person skilled in the art cannot readily conceive a 1,2,4-thiadiazole compound having a substituent at 3-position based on the cited document. Furthermore, in comparison with the compound specifically disclosed in the cited document, the compound of claim 1 of the present application has a superior advantage. In order to show, this advantage, the following comparative test is set forth. In the comparative test, the compound No.6 disclosed in page 39 of the cited document is compared with the following compounds A and B having closest structures of the present invention.<br>
Ten (10) parts of each of the compounds to be tested, 35 parts of white carbon containing 50 parts of polyoxyehtylene alkyl ether sulfate ammonium salt and 55 parts of water were mixed and pulverized by a wet grinding method to give a formulation of each compound.<br>
The formulation of each compound was diluted with water so that the active ingredient concentration came to 500 ppm to prepare a test solution. To 100 ml of ion-exchanged water was added 0.7 ml of the test solution (the active ingredient concentration: 3.5 ppm). Into the test solution, 20 last-instar larvae of common mosquito (Culex pipiers.s pallens) were released. After 8 days, the surviving number was examined and the death rate of the pest was calculated. As a result, in the treatments with the compounds A and B, the death rate of the pest was 91% or more, while the death rate of the pest was 10% or less, in the treatment with the compound of the cited document. This superior advantage of the compound of the present invention is unexpected and not taught or suggested by the cited document. Then, the inventive step should be acknowledged.<br>
The present inventors have intensively studied to find compounds having<br>
excellent arthropod controlling activity, and as a result, found out that the 1,2,4-<br>

Arthropod pests can be controlled by applying an effective dose of the present invention compound to pests directly and/or habitats of pests (e.g., nest, plant, soil). Usually the preparation of the pesticide composition of the present invention is used as the present invention compound.<br><br>
When the pesticide composition of the present invention is used for a control of pests in agriculture and forestry, the application amount is usually 0.1 to 1,000 g as an active ingredient per 1000 m2. The emulsions, wettable powders, flowables and microcapsule formulations are usually applied after dilution with water to have an active ingredient concentration of 0.01 to 10000 ppm, while oil solution, powders and granules are usually applied as such. These preparations may be sprayed directly to the plant to be protected from pests. The pests living in a soil can be controlled by treating the soil with these preparations, and the preparations can also be applied to treat seedbeds prior to the planting plants or to treat planting holes or plant bottoms in the planting. Furthermore, the sheet preparation of the pesticide composition of the present invention can be applied by a method such as winding around plants, stretching in the vicinity of plants and laying on the soil surface at the plant bottom.<br>
