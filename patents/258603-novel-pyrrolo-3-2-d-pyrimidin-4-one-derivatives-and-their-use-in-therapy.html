Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to novel pyrrolo[3,2-d]pyrimidin-4-one derivatives, processes<br>
tor their preparation, compositions containing them and their use in therapy.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a heme-containing enzyme found predominantly in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). MPO is one member of a diverse protein family of mammalian peroxidases that also includes eosinophil peroxidase, thyroid peroxidase, salivary peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, prostaglandin H synthase, and others. The mature enzyme is a dimer of identical halves. Each half molecule contains a covalently bound heme that exhibits unusual spectral properties responsible for the characteristic green colour of MPO. Cleavage of the disulphide bridge linking the two halves of MPO yields the hemi-enzyme that exhibits spectral and catalytic properties indistinguishable from those of the intact enzyme. The enzyme uses hydrogen peroxide to oxidize chloride to hypochlorous acid. Other halides and pseudohalides (like thiocyanate) are also physiological substrates to MPO.<br>
PMNs are of particular importance for combating infections. These cells contain MPO, with well documented microbicidal action. PMNs act non-specifically by phagocytosis to engulf microorganisms, incorporate them into vacuoles, termed phagosomes, which fuse with granules containing myeloperoxidase to form phagolysosomes. In phagolysosomes the enzymatic activity of the myeloperoxidase leads to the formation of hypochlorous acid, a potent bactericidal compound. Hypochlorous acid is oxidizing in itself, and reacts most avidly with thiols and thioethers, but also converts amines into chloramines, and chlorinates aromatic ammo acids. Macrophages are large phagocytic cells which, like PMNs, are capable of phagocytosing microorganisms. Macrophages can generate hydrogen peroxide and upon activation also produce myeloperoxidase. MPO and hydrogen<br><br>
peroxide can also be released to the outside of the cells where the reaction with chloride can induce damage to adjacent tissue.<br>
Linkage of myeloperoxidase activity to disease has been implicated in neurological diseases with a neuroinflammatory response including multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and stroke as well as other inflammatory diseases or conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, renal glomerular damage and rheumatoid arthritis. Lung cancer has also been suggested to be associated with high MPO levels.<br>
Multiple sclerosis (MS)<br>
MPO positive cells are immensely present in the circulation and in tissue undergoing inflammation. More specifically MPO containing macrophages and microglia has been documented in the CNS during disease; multiple sclerosis (Nagra RM, et al. Journal of Neuroimmunology 1997; 78(l-2):97-107), Parkinson's disease (Choi D-K. et al. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25(28):6594-600) and Alzheimer's disease,(Green PS. et al. Journal of Neurochemistry. 2004; 90(3):724-33). It is supposed that some aspects of a chronic ongoing inflammation result in an overwhelming destruction where agents from MPO reactions have an important role.<br>
The enzyme is released both extracellularly as well as into phagolysosom.es in the neutrophils ( Hampton MB, Kettle AJ, Winterbourn CC. Blood 1998; 92(9):3007-17). A prerequisite for the MPO activity is the presence of hydrogen peroxide, generated by NADPH oxidase and a subsequent superoxide dismutation. The oxidized enzyme is capable to use a plethora of different substrates of which chloride is most recognized. From this reaction the strong non-radical oxidant - hypochlorous acid (HOC1) - is formed. HOC1 oxidizes sulphur containing amino acids like cysteine and methionine very efficiently (Peskin AV, Winterboum CC. Free Radical Biology and Medicine 2001; 30(5):572-9). It also forms chloramines with amino groups, both in proteins and other biomolecules (Peskin AV. et al. Free Radical Biology and Medicine 2004; 37(10): 1622-30). It<br><br>
chlorinates phenols (like tyrosine) (Hazen SL. et al. Mass Free Radical Biology and Medicine 1997; 23(6):909-16) and unsaturated bonds in lipids (Albert CJ. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276(26):23733-41), oxidizes iron centers (Rosen H, Klebanoff SJ. Journal of Biological Chemistry 1982; 257(22):13731-354) and crosslinks proteins (Fu X, Mueller DM, Heinecke JW. Biochemistry 2002; 41(4): 1293-301).<br>
Proteolytic cascades participate both in cell infiltration through the BBB as well as the destruction of BBB, myelin and nerve cells ( Cuzner ML, Opdenakker G. Journal of Neuroimmunology 1999; 94(1-2): 1-14; Yong VW. et al. Nature Reviews Neuroscience 2001; 2(7):502-11.). Activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be accomplished through the action of upstream proteases in a cascade as well as through oxidation of a disulfide bridge Fu X. et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276(44):41279-87; Gu Z. et al. Science 2002; 297(5584): 1186-90). This oxidation can be either a nitrosylation or HOCl-mediated oxidation. Both reactions can be a consequence of MPO activity. Several reports have suggested a role for MMP's in general and MMP-9 in particular as influencing cell infiltration as well as tissue damage (BBB breakdown and demyelination), both in MS and EAE (for review see Yong VW. et al, supra). The importance of these specific kinds of mechanisms in MS comes from studies where increased activity and presence of proteases have been identified in MS brain tissue and CSF. Supportive data has also been generated by doing EAE studies with mice deficient in some of the proteases implicated to participate in the MS pathology, or by using pharmacological approaches.<br>
The demyelination is supposed to be dependent on the cytotoxic T-cells and toxic products generated by activated phagocytes (Lassmann H. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2003; 74(6):695-7). The axonal loss is thus influenced by proteases and reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. When MPO is present it will obviously have the capability of both activating proteases (directly as well as through disinhibition by influencing protease inhibitors) and generating reactive species.<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<br><br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disease state characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. The airflow limitation is usually both progressive and associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. COPD is a major public health problem. It is the fourth leading cause of chronic morbidity and mortality in the United States 1 and is projected to rank fifth in 2020 as a worldwide burden of disease. In the UK the prevalence of COPD is 1.7% hi men and 1.4% in women. COPD spans a range of severity from mild to very severe, with the cost of treatment rising rapidly as the severity increases.<br>
Levels of MPO in sputum and BAL are much greater in COPD patients that normal, non-smoking controls (Keatings V.M., Barnes P.J. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 1997;155:449-453; Pesci, A. et al. Bur Respir J 1998;12:380-386). MPO levels are further elevated during exacerbations of the disease (Fiorini G. et al. Biomedicine &amp; Pharmacotherapy 2000; 54:274-278; Crooks S.W. et al. European Respiratory Journal. 15(2):274-80, 2000). The role of MPO is likely to be more important in exacerbations of COPD (Sharon S.D. et al. Am J Respir Crit Care Med. 2001;163:349-355).<br>
In addition to the destructive capacity of MPO there is a strong clinical link with vascular disease (Baldus S. et al. Circulation 2003;108:1440-5). Dysfunctional MPO polymorphisms are associated with a reduced risk of mortality from coronary artery disease (Nikpoor B. et al. Am Heart J 2001; 142:336), and patients with high serum levels of MPO have increased risk of acute coronary syndrome. The effects of MPO on vascular disease may extend to COPD, since there is strong evidence that the pulmonary vasculature is one of the earliest sites of involvement in the smokers' lung. Striking changes in the intima of the pulmonary arteries have been described which show a dose relationship with smoking (Hale K.A., Niewoehner D.E., Cosio M.G. Am RevResp Dis 1980;122:273-8). The physiological function of MPO is associated with innate host defence. This role, however, is not critical as most cases of MPO deficient patients have relatively benign symptoms (Parry M.F. et al. Ann Int Med. 1981; 95:293-301, Yang, K.D., Hill, H.R. Pediatr Infect Dis J. 2001;20: 889-900). In summary, there is considerable evidence that<br><br>
elevated MPO levels in COPD may contribute to the disease via several mechanisms. A selective inhibitor of MPO would therefore be expected to alleviate both the acute and chronic inflammatory aspects of COPD and may reduce the development of emphysema.<br>
A th erosclerosis<br>
An MPO inhibitor should reduce the atherosclerotic burden and/or the vulnerability of existing atherosclerotic lesions and thereby decrease the risk of acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina or stroke. Several lines of data support a role for MPO in atherosclerosis. MPO is expressed in the shoulder regions and necrotic core of human atherosclerotic lesions and active enzyme has been isolated from autopsy specimens of human lesions (Daugherty, A. et al. (1994) J Clin Invest 94(1): 437-44). In eroded and ruptured human lesions, as compared to fatty streaks, an increased number of MPO expressing macrophages have been demonstrated, suggesting a particular role for MPO in acute coronary syndromes (Sugiyama, S. et al. (2001) Am J Pathol 158(3): 879-91). Patients with established coronary artery disease have higher plasma and leukocyte MPO levels than healthy controls (Zhang, R. et al. (2001) Jama 286(17): 2136-42). Moreover, in two large prospective studies plasma levels of MPO predicted the risk of future coronary events or revascularisation (Baldus, S. et al. (2003) Circulation 108(12): 1440-5; Brennan, M. et al. (2003) NEngl J Med 349(17): 1595-604). Total MPO deficiency in humans has a prevalece of 1 in 2000-4000 individuals. These individuals appear principally healthy but a few cases of severe Candida infection have been reported. Interestingly, MPO deficient humans are less affected by cardiovascular disease than controls with normal MPO levels (Kutter, D. et al. (2000) Acta Haematol 104(1)). A polymorphism in the MPO promoter affects expression leading to high and low MPO expressing individuals. In three different studies the high expression genotype has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (Nikpoor, B. et al. (2001) Am Heart J 142(2): 336-9; Makela, R., P. J. Karhunen, et al. (2003) Lab Invest 83(7): 919-25; Asselbergs, F. W., et al. (2004) Am J Med 116 (6): 429-30). Data accumulated during the last ten. years indicate that the proatherogenic actions of MPO include oxidation of lipoproteins, induction of endothelial dysfunction via consuming nitric oxide and destabilisation of atherosclerotic lesions by<br><br>
activation of proteases (Nicholls, S. J, and S. L. Hazen (2005) Arterioscler Thromb Vase Biol 25(6): 1102-11). Recently, several studies have focused on nitro- and chlorotyrosine modifications of LDL and HDL lipoproteins. Since chlorotyrosine modifications hi vivo only can be generated by hypochlorus acid produced by MPO these modifiactions are regareded as specific markers of MPO activity (Hazen, S. L. and J. W. Heinecke (1997) J Clin Invest 99(9): 2075-81). LDL particles exposed to MPO in vitro become aggregated, leading to facilitated uptake via macrophage scavenger receptors and foam cell formation (Hazell, L. J. and R. Stacker (1993) Biochem J 290 (Pt 1): 165-72). Chlorotyrosine modification of apoAl, the main apolipoprotein of HDL cholesterol, results in impaired cholesterol acceptor function (Bergt, C., S. et al. (2004) Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A; Zheng, L. et al. (2004) J Clin Invest 114 (4): 529-41). Systematic studies of these mechanisms have shown that MPO binds to and travels with apoAl in plasma. Moreover, MPO specifically targets those tyrosine residues of apoAl that physically interact with the macrophage ABCA1 cassette transporter during cholesterol efflux from the macrophage (Bergt, C. et al. (2004) J Biol Chem 279(9): 7856-66; Shao, B. et al. (2005) J Biol Chem 280(7): 5983-93; Zheng et al. (2005) J Biol Chem 280(1): 38-47). Thus, MPO seems to have a dual aggravating role in atherosclerotic lesions, i.e. increasing lipid accumulation via aggregation of LDL particles and decreasing the reverse cholesterol transport via attack on the HDL protein apoAl.<br>

(Figure Removed)<br>
a) reductive animation. In the process, a compound of formula (III) may be mixed with an aldehyde of formula (IV), wherein R1 is defined as in formula I, in the presence of a reducing agent such as sodium cyanoborohydride or sodium triacetoxyborohydride. An<br>
acid, preferably acetic acid, may be added to catalyze the reaction.

Pharm. Bull. 2002, 50, 1163-1168, or Furneaux, R.H., Tyler, P.C., J. Urg. Chem. 1999, 64, 8411-8412.<br>
Compounds of formula (IV), (V) and (VI) are either commercially available or may be prepared using methods that are well-known in the literature.<br>
The present invention includes compounds of formula (I) in the form of salts. Suitable salts include those formed with organic or inorganic acids or organic or inorganic bases.

asthma, both intermittent and persistent and of all severities, and other causes of airway hyper-responsiveness; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); bronchitis, including infectious and eosinophilic bronchitis; emphysema; bronchiectasis; cystic Jibrosis; sarcoidosis; farmer's lung and related diseases; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; lung fibrosis, including cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, iibrosis complicating anti-neoplastic therapy and chronic infection, including tuberculosis and aspergillosis and other fungal infections; complications of lung transplantation; \asculitic and thrombotic disorders of the lung vasculature, and pulmonary hypertension; antitussive activity including treatment of chronic cough associated with inflammatory and secretory conditions of the airways, and iatrogenic cough; acute and chronic rhinitis including rhinitis medicamentosa, and vasomotor rhinitis; perennial and seasonal allergic rhinitis including rhinitis nervosa (hay fever); nasal polyposis; acute viral infection including the common cold, and infection due to respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, coronavirus (including SARS) and adenovirus. Such conditions or disorders will be readily apparent to the man skilled in the art.<br>
Conditions or disorders that may be specifically mentioned include multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke, as well as other inflammatory diseases or conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sinusitis, rhinitis, psoriasis, dermatitis, uveitis, gingivitis, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, ischaemic heart disease, restenosis, inflammatory bowel disease, renal glomerular damage, liver fibrosis, sepsis, proctitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and inflammation associated with reperfusion injury, spinal cord injury and tissue damage/scarring/adhesion/rejection. Lung cancer has also been suggested to be associated with high MPO levels. The compounds are also expected to be useful in the treatment of pain.<br>
Prophylaxis is expected to be particularly relevant to the treatment of persons who have suffered a previous episode of, or are otherwise considered to be at increased risk of, the<br>
disease or condition in question. Persons at risk of developing a particular disease or condition generally include those having a family history of the disease or condition, or those who have been identified by genetic testing or screening to be particularly susceptible to developing the disease or condition.<br>
For the above-mentioned therapeutic indications, the dosage administered will, of course, vary with the compound employed, the mode of administration and the treatment desired. However, in general, satisfactory results are obtained when the compounds are administered at a dosage of the solid form of between 1 mg and 2000 mg per day.<br>
The compounds of formulae (I), and pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thereof, may be used on their own, or in the form of appropriate pharmaceutical compositions in which the compound or derivative is in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Thus, another aspect of the invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition comprising a novel compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant, diluent or carrier. Administration may be by, but is not limited to, enteral (including oral, sublingual or rectal), intranasal, inhalation, intravenous, topical or other parenteral routes. Conventional procedures for the selection and preparation of suitable pharmaceutical formulations are described in, for example, "Pharmaceuticals - The Science of Dosage Form Designs", M. E. Aulton, Churchill Livingstone, 1988. The pharmaceutical composition preferably comprises less than 80% and more preferably less than 50% of a compound of formulae (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
There is also provided a process for the preparation of such a pharmaceutical composition which comprises mixing the ingredients.<br><br>

'H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz for proton and 100 MHz for carbon-13 either on a Varian Unity+ 400 NMR Spectrometer equipped with a 5mm BBO probe head with Z-gradients, or a Bruker Avance 400 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 60 jal dual inverse flow probe head with Z-gradients, or a Bruker DPX400 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 4-nucieus probe head equipped with Z-gradients. Unless specifically noted in the examples, spectra were recorded at 400 MHz for proton and 100 MHz for carbon-13. The following reference signals were used: the middle line of DMSO-ds 5 2.50 (!H), 8 39.51 (13C); the middle line of CD3OD 5 3.31 (JH) or 8 49.15 (13C); acetone-d6 2.04 ('H), 206.5 (13C); and CDC13 8 7.26 (1H), the middle line of CDC13 5 77.16 (13C) (unless otherwise indicated).<br>
Mass spectra were recorded on a Waters LCMS consisting of an Alliance 2795 (LC), Waters PDA 2996, and ELS detector (Sedex 75) and a ZMD single quadrupole mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer was equipped with an electrospray ion source (ES) operated in a positive or negative ion mode. The capillary voltage was 3 kV and cone voltage was 30 V. The mass spectrometer was scanned between m/z 100-600 with a scan time of 0.7s. The column temperature was set to 40 °C. The Diode Array Detector was scanned from 200-400 nm. The temperature of the ELS detector was adjusted to 40 °C and the pressure was set to 1.9 bar. For LC separation a linear gradient was applied starting at .100% A (A: 10 mMNH4OAc in 5% MeCN) and ending at 100% B (B: MeCN) after four<br>
minutes. The column used was a X-Terra MS C8, 3.0 x 50; 3.5 urn (Waters) run at 1.0 niL/min.<br>
Alternatively, mass spectra was performed on a GC-MS (GC 6890, 5973N MSD) supplied by Agilent Technologies. The column used was a VF-5 MS, ID 0.25 mm x 30m, 0.25 um (Varian Inc.). A linear temperature gradient was applied starting at 40 °C (hold 1 min) and ending at 300 °C (hold 1 min), 25 °C/minute. The MS was equipped with a CI ion source and the reactant gas was methane. The MS was scanned between m/z 50-500 and the scan speed was set to 3.25 scan/s. The MS was equipped with an El ion source. The MS was scanned between m/z 50-500 and the scan speed was set to 3.25 scan/s. The electron voltage was set to 70 e V.<br>
HPLC analyses were performed on an Agilent HP1100 system consisting of G1379A Micro Vacuum Degasser, G1312A Binary Pump, G1367A Well plate auto-sampler, G1316A Thermo started Column Compartment and G1315B Diode Array Detector. Column: X-Terra MS, Waters, 3.0 x 100 mm, 3.5 p,m. The column temperature was set to 40 °C and the flow rate to 1.0 ml/min. The Diode Array Detector was scanned from 210-300 nm, step and peak width were set to 2 nm and 0.05 min, respectively. A linear gradient was applied, starting at 100 % A (A: 10 mM NHtOAc in 5 % MeCN) and ending at 100% B (B: MeCN), in 6 min.<br>
Microwave heating was performed in an Initiator or Smith Synthesizer Single-mode microwave cavity producing continuous irradiation at 2450 MHz.<br>
A typical workup procedure after a reaction consisted of extraction of the product with a solvent such as ethyl acetate, washing with water followed by drying of the organic phase over MgSO4 or Na2SO4 filtration and concentration of the solution in vacuo.<br>
Thin layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on Merck TLC-plates (Silica gel 60 $254) and UV visualized the spots. Flash column chromatography was preformed on a Combi Flash® Companion™ using RediSep™ normal-phase flash columns. Typical solvents used<br>
for flash column chromatography were mixtures of chloroform/methanol, dichloromethane/methanol and heptane/ethyl acetate.<br>
Preparative chromatography was run on a Waters autopurification HPLC with a diode array detector. Column: XTerraMS C8,19 x 300 mm, 10 urn. Narrow gradients with MeCN/(95:5 O.IM NH4OAc:MeCN) were used at a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Alternatively, another column was used; Atlantis CIS 19x 100 mm, 5 urn column. Gradient with acetonitrile/O.lM ammonium acetate in 5% acetonitrile in MilliQ Water, run from 0% to 35-50% acetonitrile, in 15 min. Flow rate: 15 ml/min. Alternatively, purification was achieved on a semi preparative Shimadzu LC-8A HPLC with a Shimadzu SPD-IOA UV-vis.-detector equipped with a Waters Symmetry® column (CIS, 5 um, 100 mm x 19 mm). Narrow gradients with MeCN/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in MilliQ Water were used at a flow rate of 10 mJ/min.<br>
Recrystallization was typically performed in solvents or solvent mixtures such as ether, ethyl acetate/heptane and methanol/water.<br>

Starting materials used were either available from commercial sources or prepared according to literature procedures and had experimental data in accordance with those reported. The following is an example of a starting material that was prepared: 3-Amino-lH~pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid ester: Fumeaux, R.H., Tyler, P.C., J. Org. Chem. 1999,64, 8411-8412.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
A reaction mixture of the amino pyrrole ester Al (1.0 equiv.), the aldehyde A2 (1.0 to 2.0 equiv.) and NaCNBHs (1.0 equiv.) in methanol was stirred at r.t. for 24 h. In some examples, acetic acid (1 to 2 equiv.) was added to catalyze the reaction. If the reaction was not complete after 24 h (monitored by TLC or LC-MS), more aldehyde A2 was added and the mixture was stirred at r.t. until the reaction was complete. The mixture was then evaporated onto silica gel and purified by flash column chromatography.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Ethoxycarbonyl isothiocyanate B2 (1.0 to 1.2 equiv.) was added to the amino pyrrole ester Bl (1.0 equiv.) in CH2C12 and the mixture was stirred at r.t. for 5 to 60 minutes, or overnight. Water was added and the aqueous phase was extracted with CHaCla. The organic phase was combined, dried (MgSO4) and concentrated. The crude ring opened intermediate was purified by flash column chromatography. The intermediate product was dissolved in 1M NaOEt in EtOH (1.1-1.5 equiv.) and heated in a microwave reactor for 10 minutes at 120 °C. The pH was adjusted to neutral pH with 2M HC1; the solid was collected by filtration and washed with water. The crude product was purified using preparative HPLC, or by flash column chromatography or by recrystallization.<br>

Screens<br>
Methods for the determination of MPO inhibitory activity are disclosed in patent application WO 02/090575. The pharmacological activity of compounds according to the invention was tested in the following screen in which the compounds were either tested alone or in the presence of added tyrosine:<br>
Assay buffer: 20 mM sodium/potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.5 containing 10 mM taurine and 100 mM NaCl.<br>
Developing reagent: 2 mM 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB), 200 (J.M KI, 200 mM acetate buffer pH 5.4 with 20 % DMF.<br>
To 10 ul of diluted compounds in assay buffer, 40 jil of human MPO (final concentration 2.5 nM), with or without 20 uM tyrosine (final concentration, if present, 8 fiM), was added and the mixture was incubated for 10 minutes at ambient temperature. Then 50 ul of HiC^ (final concentration 100 uM), or assay buffer alone as a control, were added. After incubation for 10 minutes at ambient temperature, the reaction was stopped by adding 10 ul 0.2 nag/ml of catalase (final concentration 18 (J-g/ml). The reaction mixture was left for an additional 5 minutes before 100 ul of TMB developing reagent was added. The amount of oxidised 3,3'35}5'-tetramethylbenzidine formed was then measured after about 5 minutesusing absorbance spectroscopy at about 650 nM. ICso values were then determined using standard procedures.<br>
When tested in at least one version of the above screen, the compounds of Examples 1 to 32 gave IC$Q values of less than 60 jjM, indicating that they are expected to show useful therapeutic activity. Representative results are shown in the following Table.<br>
