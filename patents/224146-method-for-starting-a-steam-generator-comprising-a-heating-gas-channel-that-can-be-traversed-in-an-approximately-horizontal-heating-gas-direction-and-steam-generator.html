				<td>Method for starting a steam generator comprising a heating gas<br>
channel that can be traversed in an approximately horizontal heating<br>
gas direction and steam generator<br>
The invention relates to a method for starting a steam generator<br>
with a heating gas channel that can be traversed in an almost<br>
horizontal heating gas direction, in which at least one continuous<br>
heating surface is located, configured from a number of<br>
approximately vertical evaporator tubes, connected in parallel to<br>
allow the passage of a flow medium. It also refers to a steam<br>
generator of this kind.<br>
In a gas and steam turbine system, the heat contained in the<br>
expanded operating medium or heating gas from the gas turbine is<br>
used to generate steam for the steam turbine. The heat transfer<br>
takes place in a waste-heat steam generator downstream of the gas<br>
turbine, in which usually a number of heating surfaces are arranged<br>
for water preheating, steam generation and steam superheating. The<br>
heating surfaces are connected to the water-steam circuit of the<br>
steam turbine. The water-steam circuit normally contains several,<br>
e.g. three, pressure stages, each having an evaporator heating<br>
surface.<br>
Several alternative design concepts are possible for the steam<br>
generator connected downstream of the heating gas end of the gas<br>
turbine as a waste-heat steam generator, i.e. as a once-through<br>
steam generator or as a circulating-steam generator. With a once-<br>
through steam generator, the heating of the steam generating tubes<br>
provided as evaporator tubes causes evaporation of the flow medium<br>
in the steam generator tubes in a single passage. In contrast to<br>
this, with a natural- or forced-circulation steam generate the<br>
circulated water is only partially evaporated during one passage<br>
through the evaporator tubes. The water not evaporated is re-<br>
supplied to the same evaporator tubes for further evaporation after<br>
removal of the generated steam.<br>
A once-through steam generator is, in contrast to a natural- or<br>
forced-circulation steam generator, not subject to pressure<br>
limitation and therefore live steam pressures far above the critical<br>
pressure of water of (PKri Ëœ 221 bar) where there are still only<br>
slight differences in density between the liquid-similar and steam-<br>
similar medium, are possible. A high live steam pressure favors a<br>
high thermal efficiency and therefore low CO2 emissions in a power<br>
station heated by fossil fuel. In addition, a once-through steam<br>
generator is of simpler construction than a circulating-steam<br>
generator and therefore can be manufactured at particularly low<br>
cost. The use of a steam generator designed on the once-through<br>
principle as a waste heat steam generator of a gas and steam turbine<br>
system is therefore particularly suitable for achieving a high<br>
overall efficiency of the gas and steam turbine system combined with<br>
simple construction.<br>
Particular advantages with regard to the cost of manufacture and<br>
also the necessary maintenance work is offered by a waste-heat steam<br>
generator of horizontal design where the heating medium or heating<br>
gas, in particular the waste gas from the gas turbine, is passed<br>
through the steam generator in an almost horizontal direction of<br>
flow. A horizontal steam generator of this kind is known from EP 0<br>
944 801 Bl. Because of its design as a once-through steam generator,<br>
the overflowing of water from the evaporator tubes forming the<br>
continuous heating surface into the downstream superheater must be<br>
prevented during operation. However, this can cause problems,<br>
particularly when starting the steam generator.<br>
When the steam generator is started, a water discharge, as it is<br>
called, can occur. This arises when the flow medium in the<br>
evaporator tubes initially evaporates due to the heating of the<br>
evaporator tubes and this, for example, takes place in the middle of<br>
the particular evaporator tube. This causes the quantity of water<br>
downstream (also known as water plugs) to be expelled from the<br>
particular evaporator tube. To reliably make sure that unevaporated<br>
flow medium from the evaporator tubes cannot reach the superheater<br>
connected after the tubes, the known steam generator, such as<br>
normally also a once-through steam generator of vertical design, is<br>
provided with a water-steam separator or precipitator connected<br>
between the evaporator tubes forming the continuous heating surface<br>
and the superheater. Surplus water is drawn off from this and either<br>
returned to the evaporator by a circulating pump or discharged. A<br>
water-steam separating system of this kind is, however,<br>
comparatively expensive with regard to both design and maintenance.<br>
The object of the invention is therefore to provide a method for<br>
starting a steam generator of the type stated above, that also<br>
guarantees a high degree of operating safety combined with a<br>
particularly simple construction. Furthermore, a steam generator<br>
particular suitable for the performance of the method is also to be<br>
specified.<br>
With regard to the method, this object is achieved according to the<br>
invention in that at least several of the evaporator tubes forming<br>
the continuous heating surface are partially filled to a<br>
predeterminable desired level with unevaporated flow medium before<br>
heating gas is applied to the heating gas channel.<br>
The invention is based on the consideration that to maintain a high<br>
operational safety when the steam generator is starting, the entry<br>
of unevaporated flow medium into the superheater connected after the<br>
evaporator tubes must be safely prevented. For a particularly simple<br>
construction, however, this should be ensured without the water-<br>
steam separating device normally provided with once-through steam<br>
generators. To achieve this, with a steam generator of horizontal<br>
construction where an outlet connector connected to the outlet end<br>
of the evaporator tubes forming the continuous heating surface is<br>
directly connected to an inlet distributor of the superheater, only<br>
partial filling of the evaporator tubes with unevaporated flow<br>
medium should take place before starting. The amount, and therefore<br>
the desired level, for this initial filling prior to the impingement<br>
of the heating gas channel by a heating gas should be chosen so that<br>
on the one hand the water discharge due to the initial steam<br>
formation is avoided and on the other hand inadequate cooling of the<br>
evaporator tubes during starting is precluded.<br>
The desired level is appropriate chosen so that at the beginning of<br>
the starting operation the supply of the evaporator tubes with flow<br>
medium can be omitted. Thus, during the starting process, i.e. after<br>
the heating gas channel has been impinged by the heating gas,<br>
evaporation of the flow medium already present in the evaporator<br>
tubes first takes place. In this process the unevaporated flow<br>
medium, within the particular evaporator tube downstream of the<br>
particular location of the start of evaporation, is shifted by the<br>
forming steam bubble into the zone of the particular evaporator tube<br>
that previously was unfilled. There, this amount of the unevaporated<br>
flow medium can evaporate or, if sufficiently low mass flow<br>
densities are maintained in the evaporator tubes, again drops into<br>
the lower space of the particular evaporator tube. By choosing a<br>
suitable desired level, the part area of the particular evaporator<br>
tube located in the upper area of the particular evaporator tube,<br>
initially not filled with flow medium and serving as a compensating<br>
space for the column underneath as a flow medium, can thus be<br>
designed to be large enough to securely prevent the outflow of<br>
unevaporated flow medium from the particular evaporator tube, even<br>
at the start of evaporation.<br>
During the partial filling of the particular evaporator tubes before<br>
the initial impingement of the heating channel by heating gas, the<br>
actual level of the particular evaporator tubes is advantageously<br>
matched to the predeterminable desired level. To do this, the actual<br>
full level is advantageously determined by measuring the pressure<br>
difference between the lower tube inlet and upper tube outlet of the<br>
particular evaporator tube, with the value obtained in this way<br>
being appropriately used as a basis for the supply of the particular<br>
evaporator tube with unevaporated flow mediu ..<br>
Depending on the operating state of the steam generator and its<br>
previous history, different time characteristics of the heating of<br>
the steam generator during its starting phase can be provided. To<br>
guarantee a particularly reliable maintenance of the boundary<br>
conditions even when the pattern of the starting phase varies that<br>
both reliably precludes the outflow of unevaporated flow medium from<br>
the evaporator tubes and in each case guarantees adequate cooling of<br>
all evaporator tubes, the desired level for the initial filling of<br>
the evaporator tubes is advantageously determined on the basis of<br>
the design heating characteristics on starting. The characteristics<br>
of the heating on starting are determined appropriately using<br>
characteristic values for the boiler geometry and/or time<br>
characteristics of the heat supply by the heating gas. For this<br>
purpose, characteristics of heating on starting matched to a number<br>
of parameter combinations of this kind can be stored in a database<br>
assigned to the steam generator, with it being possible in<br>
particular to take account of the heating cycles preceding the<br>
current heating cycle.<br>
In the starting phase of the starting process, i.e. in a time span<br>
immediately after the start of impingement of the heating gas<br>
channel with heating gas, operation of the steam generator is<br>
provided without further impingement of the evaporator tubes by flow<br>
medium or feed water. However, it is appropriate for the supply of<br>
feed water or unevaporated flow medium to the evaporator tubes to<br>
take place after the onset of steam formation in the evaporator<br>
tubes, so that after steam formation has occurred an adequate<br>
cooling of the particular evaporator tube is ensured in each case.<br>
The onset of steam formation in this case is advantageously .etected<br>
by a pressure rise in the water-steam circuit. To enable the<br>
evaporator tubes to be supplied with feed water to meet demand in a<br>
particularly reliable manner, a measured value characteristic of the<br>
pressure of the flow medium is thus advantageously monitored after<br>
the start of impingement of the heating gas channel by heating gas,<br>
whereby if this measured value then exceeds a predetermined limit, a<br>
continuous impingement of the evaporator tubes by feed water takes<br>
place.<br>
After the start of supply of the feed water to the evaporator tubes,<br>
the feed water supply to the evaporator tubes is controlled so that<br>
an outflow of unevaporated flow medium from the evaporator tubes is<br>
securely avoided. To do this, the supply of feed water to the<br>
evaporator tubes is advantageously controlled in such a way that<br>
superheated steam emerges from the upper tube outlet of that or<br>
every evaporator tube. To guarantee that no evaporated flow medium<br>
can reach the downstream superheater, the provision at the outlet of<br>
the evaporator tubes of steam that is comparatively only weakly<br>
superheated is sufficient.<br>
To guarantee a particularly high operating stability of the steam<br>
generator, the mass flow density of the flow medium being fed to the<br>
evaporator tubes is set in such a way that an evaporator tube heated<br>
more than a different evaporator tube with the same continuous<br>
heating surface has a higher throughput of flow medium than the<br>
other evaporator tube. The continuous heating surface of the steam<br>
generator thus, with regard to the flow characteristics of a natural<br>
circulation evaporator heater (natural circulation characteristics),<br>
has, if different heating patterns of individual evaporator tubes<br>
occur, a stabilizing behavior that leads to a matching of the outlet<br>
temperature, without the need of an external influence even with<br>
differently heated evaporator tubes connected in parallel at the<br>
flow medium end. To guarantee this characteristic, an impingement of<br>
the evaporator tubes by a comparatively low mass flow density is<br>
provided.<br>
This object is achieved with regard to the steam generator in that a<br>
common differential pressure measuring device is allocated to a<br>
distributor connected to the inlet of the evaporator tubes and to an<br>
outlet collector connected to the outlet of the evaporator tubes.<br>
The differential pressure measuring device enables the level in the<br>
evaporator tubes to be monitored in a particularly satisfactory<br>
manner, so that a characteristic value for this can be used as a<br>
suitable guide value for the supply of the evaporator tubes.<br>
The particular advantages of the invention are that just by a<br>
partial filling of the evaporator tubes with the unevaporated flow<br>
medium before an initial impingement of the heating gas channel by<br>
heating gas a starting process with high operating safety is<br>
guaranteed, thus, particularly with adequate cooling of the<br>
evaporator tubes, the admittance of unevaporated flow medium to the<br>
superheater downstream of the evaporator is securely avoided,<br>
therefore enabling a particularly simple construction of the steam<br>
generator. In this case the comparatively expensive water-steam<br>
separating system can be completely done away with whilst<br>
maintaining the high operating safety standard, without the need to<br>
use particularly robust or high-quality raw materials in the<br>
construction in its place. A particularly secure and stable<br>
operating behavior is thus especially achievable in that the<br>
evaporator tubes are impinged at comparatively low mass flow<br>
density, so that unevaporated flow medium in the evaporator tubes<br>
also remains in the particular evaporator tube even at the onset of<br>
steam formation in the particular evaporator tube and is finally<br>
also evaporated there.<br>
An example of the embodiment of the invention is further explained<br>
with the aid of a drawing. The drawing is a simplified<br>
representation showing a longitudinal section of a steam generator<br>
of horizontal construction.<br>
The steam generator 1 in accordance with the illustration is<br>
connected to the outlet gas end of a gas turbine (not illustrated in<br>
more detail) as a waste-heat steam generator. The steam generator 1<br>
has a surrounding wall 2 that forms an almost horizontal heating gas<br>
channel 6 for the exhaust gas from the gas turbine, that can be<br>
traversed in the heating gas direction x shown by the arrow 4. The<br>
heating gas channel 6 contains a number of evaporator heating<br>
surfaces designed according to the continuous principle, also<br>
designated a continuous heating surface 8, 10. The exemplary<br>
embodiment shows two continuous heating surfaces 8, 10, but also<br>
just one or a greater number of continuous heating surfaces can be<br>
provided.<br>
The continuous heating surfaces 8, 10 of the steam generator 1 each<br>
consist of a number of parallel evaporator tubes 14 or 15 in the<br>
form of a tube bundle to allow the passage of a flow medium W. The<br>
evaporator tubes 14, 15 are in this case each aligned almost<br>
vertically, with a number of evaporator tubes 14 or 15 being<br>
arranged side-by-side viewed in the heating gas direction x. In each<br>
case, only one of the evaporator tubes 14 or 15 arranged side-by-<br>
side in this way is visible.<br>
A common distributor 16 is connected before the evaporator tubes 14<br>
of the first continuous heating surface 8 at the flow medium end and<br>
a common outlet collector 18 is connected to the outlet end. The<br>
outlet of the outlet collector 18 of the first continuous heating<br>
surface 8 is connected via a drop pipe system 20 to a distributor 22<br>
allocated to the second continuous heating surface 10. The outlet of<br>
the second continuous heating surface 10 is connected to an outlet<br>
collector 24.<br>
The evaporator system formed by the continuous heating surfaces 8,<br>
10 can be impinged by the flow medium W that is evaporated by a<br>
single passage through the evaporator system and is drawn off from<br>
the outlet of the evaporator system as steam D and fed to a<br>
superheater surface 26 connected to the outlet collector 24 of the<br>
second continuous heating surface 10. The pipe system formed by the<br>
continuous heating surfaces 8, 10 and the superheater surface 26<br>
connected after them is connected to the water-steam circuit of a<br>
gas turbine (not illustrated in more detail). In addition, a number<br>
of other heating surfaces 28, in each case schematically indicated,<br>
are connected to the water-steam circuit of the gas turbine. The<br>
heating surfaces 28 can, for example, be medium-pressure<br>
evaporators, low-pressure evaporators and/or preheaters.<br>
The evaporator system formed by the continuous surfaces 8, 10 is<br>
designed in such a way as to be suitable for a supply of the<br>
evaporator tubes 14, 15 at a comparatively low mass flow density,<br>
with the evaporator tubes 14, 15 having a natural circulation<br>
characteristic. With this natural circulation characteristic, an<br>
evaporator tube 14 or 15 heated more than a different evaporator<br>
tube 14 or 15 with the same continuous heating surface 8 or 10 has<br>
a higher throughput of flow medium W than the other evaporator tube<br>
14 or 15.<br>
The illustrated steam generator 1 is of comparably simple<br>
construction. In this case, the main difference is that the second<br>
continuous heating surface 10 is connected directly to the<br>
superheating surface 26 connected after it, omitting a comparatively<br>
expensive water-steam separating system or precipitation system, so<br>
that the outlet collector 24 of the second continuous heating<br>
surface 10 is directly connected via an overflow line, and without<br>
other components connected in between, to a distributor of the<br>
superheating surface 26. However, to also maintain a comparatively<br>
high operating safety with this comparatively simple design in all<br>
operating states, the steam generator 1 is operated within these<br>
boundary conditions when starting. In this case, the steam generator<br>
1 is particularly operated on starting in such a way that on the one<br>
hand there is sufficient cooling of the evaporator tubes 14, 15<br>
forming the continuous heating surfaces 8, 10 and also of the steam<br>
generator tubes forming the superheating surface 26. On the other<br>
hand, the steam generator 1 is also operated in such a way on<br>
startup that also without a water-steam separating system connected<br>
between the second continuous heating surface 10 and the<br>
superheating surface 26, the supply of unevaporated flow medium W to<br>
the superheating surface 26 is securely avoided.<br>
To guarantee this, the evaporator tubes 14 forming the first<br>
continuous heating surface 8 are filled to a predeterminable desired<br>
level, shown by the dotted line 30 in the illustration, with<br>
unevaporated flow medium W, before the initial impingement of the<br>
heating gas channel 6 with heating gas from the upstream gas<br>
turbine. The filling of the evaporator tubes 14 with unevaporated<br>
flow medium W before the commencement of heating in this case takes<br>
place through the feed water line and the distributor 16 that are<br>
present in any case. In this way, the actual level achieved in the<br>
evaporator tubes 14 is determined by measuring the pressure<br>
difference between the lower distributor 16 and the upper outlet<br>
collector 18. For this purpose, a common differential pressure<br>
measuring device 32 is allocated to the distribution 16 and outlet<br>
collector 18. Using the actual level in each evaporator tube 14,<br>
determined in this way, further filling with unevaporated flow<br>
medium W is controlled so that the predetermined desired level is<br>
obtained within a predetermined tolerance band.<br>
On completion of the initial filling of the evaporator tubes 14 with<br>
unevaporated flow medium w, further supply of the flow medium W to<br>
the evaporator tubes 14 is halted. In this condition, the beginning<br>
of the actual starting process for the steam generator 1 takes<br>
place, with, in particular, the impingement of the heating gas<br>
channel 6 with heating gas from the upstream gas turbine taking<br>
place. Due to the heating of the evaporator tubes 14 that has now<br>
begun, the unevaporated flow medium W in the evaporator tubes begins<br>
to evaporate. A local evaporation then takes place in each of the<br>
evaporator tubes 14 after a certain time period, with the still<br>
unevaporated flow medium W downstream or above the actual location<br>
of the start of evaporation being shifted to the upper zone of the<br>
particular evaporator tube 14 initially not filled with flow medium<br>
W. There, an evaporation of this part of the flow medium W takes<br>
place, or this part of the flow medium W drops back into its lower<br>
area due to the comparatively low design mass flow density in the<br>
evaporator tubes 14.<br>
Any unevaporated flow medium W still remaining is passed through the<br>
drop pipe system 20 into the next downstream second continuous<br>
heating surface 10 and there it is completely evaporated. The second<br>
continuous heating surface 10 thus takes the still remaining water<br>
discharge from the first continuous heating surface 8 in each case.<br>
Because the evaporator tubes 14 are only partly filled before the<br>
start of the actual starting process, no, or practically no,<br>
unevaporated flow medium W enters the outlet collector 24 connected<br>
after the second continuous heating surface 10 or the superheater<br>
surface 26 connected after the outlet collector.<br>
The exemplary embodiment thus provides for only partial filling of<br>
the evaporator tubes 14 forming the first continuous heating surface<br>
8; the second continuous heating surface 10 initially remains<br>
unfilled. Additionally, in an alternative form of embodiment,<br>
evaporator tubes 15 forming the second continuous heating surface 10<br>
can also be partially filled using a similar method.<br>
A determination of whether steam production has already started in<br>
the evaporator tubes 14 and evaporator flow medium or steam 0 has<br>
entered the outlet collector 24 is determined by measuring the<br>
pressure of the flow medium W or steam D, particularly at the outlet<br>
collector 24 or the outlet of the superheating surface 26. A<br>
measured value characteristic of the pressure of the evaporated flow<br>
medium or steam D in the outlet collector 24 or at the outlet of the<br>
superheating surface is detected and monitored by means of a<br>
suitable arranged pressure sensor. This enables the start of steam<br>
production to be inferred on the basis of an increase in pressure,<br>
which can reach several bars per minute when steam begins to form.<br>
After the onset of steam formation in the evaporator tubes 14 has<br>
been detected in this way, the operating supply of feed water or<br>
unevaporated flow medium W to the distributor 16 allocated to the<br>
continuous heating surface 8 takes place. During the further<br>
starting process, i.e. particularly until a steady-state operating<br>
condition is reached, the supply of feed water or unevaporated flow<br>
medium W to the evaporator tubes 14 is controlled in such a way that<br>
superheated steam D, i.e. steam D without a wet component, emerges<br>
at the upper tube outlet 34 of the evaporator tubes 14.<br>
Moreover, the mass flow density of the flow medium W being supplied<br>
to the evaporator tubes 14 is set so that an evaporator tube 14<br>
heated more than a different evaporator tube 14 has a higher<br>
throughput of flow medium W than the other evaporator tube 14. This<br>
ensures that the continuous heating surface 8 has a self stabilizing<br>
behavior in the manner of the flow characteristics of a natural-<br>
circulation evaporator heating surface even if different heating of<br>
individual evaporator tubes 14 occurs.<br>
The performance, shown here, of the starting process of the steam<br>
generator 1 ensures adequate cooling for the evaporator tubes 14, 15<br>
at all times and also that no unevaporated flow medium W enters the<br>
superheating surface 26 connected after the second continuous<br>
heating surface 10 at any time. Compliance with these boundary<br>
conditions in this case is to be particularly ensured by the choice<br>
of the desired level for the evaporator tubes 14 before beginning<br>
the actual starting process. The desired level for the evaporator<br>
tube 14 is predetermined so that precisely these boundary conditions<br>
are complied with as a basis for the design starting process. To do<br>
this, the desired level is preset for steam generator 1 depending on<br>
the design heating characteristics on starting. The heating<br>
characteristics on starting in this case are determined from<br>
characteristic values for the boiler geometry and material and/or<br>
the type of fuel. In particular, it can be provided in this case<br>
that a number of possible starting heating characteristics suitable<br>
for the steam generator 1 in question are stored in a memory module<br>
as a type of database, from which a characteristic matched to the<br>
actual situation can be selected using operating data and used as a<br>
basis for specifying the desired level.<br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1. A method for starting a steam generator (1), comprising :<br>
trasversing a heating gas channel (6) with a heating gas in an<br>
approximately horizontal heating gas direction;<br>
locating at least one continuous heating surface (8), configured from a<br>
number of approximately vertical evaporator tubes (14) connected in<br>
parallel to allow the passage of a flow medium (W, D);<br>
characterized in that<br>
partially filling at least several evaporator tubes (14) to a predeterminable<br>
desired level with an unevaporated flow medium (W), and<br>
impinging the heating gas channel (6) by the heating gas, wherein during a<br>
supply of the" evaporator tubes (14) with the flow medium (W, D), a<br>
particular mass flow density is set so that an evaporator tube (14) heated<br>
more than a different evaporator tube (14) of the same continuous heating<br>
surface (8) has a higher throughput of flow medium (W) than the different<br>
evaporator tube (14).<br>
2. The method as claimed in claim 1, wherein the level of the unevaporated<br>
flow medium in the particular evaporator tubes (4) is determined by a<br>
differential pressure measurement between the lower tube inlet (32) and<br>
upper tube outlet (34).<br>
3. The method as claimed in claim 2, wherein the desired level is specified<br>
relative to design starting heating characteristics.<br>
The method as claimed in claim 3, wherein the starting heating<br>
characteristics are determined on the basis of characteristic values for the<br>
boiler geometry and/or the time characteristics of the heat supply by the<br>
heating gas.<br>
The method as claimed in claim 4, wherein a measured value<br>
characteristic of a pressure of the flow medium (W, D) is measured when<br>
the heating gas channel (6) is impinged by heating gas, whereby if the<br>
measured value exceeds a predeterminable limit, a continuous<br>
impingement of the evaporator tubes (14) by unevaporated flow medium<br>
(W) takes place.<br>
The method as claimed in claim 5, wherein the supply flow medium (W) to<br>
the evaporator tubes (14) takes place after the onset of steam formation in<br>
the evaporator tubes (14).<br>
The method as claimed in claim 6, wherein the supply of flow medium (W)<br>
to the evaporator tubes (14) is controlled in such a way that superheated<br>
steam emerges at the upper tube outlet of the one or every evaporator tube<br>
(15).<br>
Steam generator (1) which is started by the method as claimed in<br>
preceding claims and comprising one heating gas channel (6), which can<br>
be traversed in an approximately horizontal heating gas direction in which<br>
at least one continuous heating surface (8) is located, configured from a<br>
number of approximately vertical evaporator tubes (14) connected in<br>
parallel to allow the passage of a flow medium (W, D), with a common<br>
differential pressure measuring device (32) being allocated to a distributor<br>
(16) connected before the evaporator tubes (14) and to an outlet collector<br>
(18) connected after the evaporator tubes (14).<br>
The invention relates to a steam generator (1) comprising a heating gas<br>
channel (6), which can be traversed in an approximately horizontal<br>
heating gas direction and in which at least one continuous heating<br>
surface (8) is located, configured from a number of approximately vertical<br>
evaporator tubes (14), connected in parallel to allow the passage of a flow<br>
medium (W.D.). The aim of the invention is to provide a method for<br>
starting a generator, which guarantees a high degree of operational<br>
safety, even for a steam generator with a particularly simple construction<br>
(1). According to the invention, to achieve this, at least several evaporator<br>
tubes (14) are partially filled to a predeterminable desired level with<br>
unevaporated flow medium (W), prior to the impingement of the heating<br>
gas channel (6) by a heating gas.</td>
