Field of application of the invention<br>
The invention relates to novel sulphonylpyrrole derivatives, which are used in the pharmaceutical industry for the production of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Known technical background<br>
Transcriptional regulation in cells is a complex biological process. One basic principle is regulation by posttranslational modification of histone proteins, namely histone proteins H2A/B, H3 and H4 forming the octameric histone core complex. These complex N-terminal modifications at lysine residues by acetylation or methylation and at serine residues by phosphorylation constitute part of the so called "histone code" (Strahl &amp; Ellis, Nature 403, 41-45, 2000). In a simple model, acetylation of positively charged lysine residues decreases affinity to negatively charged DNA, which now becomes accessible for the entry of transcription factors.<br>
Histone acetylation and deacetylation is catalysed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs are associated with transcriptional repressor complexes, switching chromatin to a transcriptionally inactive, silent structure (Marks et al. Nature Cancer Rev 1, 194-202, 2001). The opposite holds true for HATs which are associated with transcriptional activator complexes. Three different classes of HDACs have been described so far, namely class I (HDAC 1-3, 8) with Mr = 42-55 kDa primarily located in the nucleus and sensitive towards inhibition by Trichostatin A (TSA), class II (HDAC 4-7, 9, 10) with Mr = 120-130kDa and TSA sensitivity and class III (Sir2 homologues) which are quite distinct by their NAD+ dependency and TSA insensitivity (Ruijter et al. Biochem.J. 370, 737-749, 2003; Khochbin et al. Curr Opin Gen Dev 11, 162-166, 2001; Verdin et al. Trends Gen 19, 286-293, 2003). HDAC 11 with Mr = 39kDa was cloned recently and displayed homology to class I and II family members (Gao et al. J Biol Chem 277,25748-25755, 2002). HATs and HDACs exist in large complexes together with transcription factor and platform proteins in cells (Fischle et al. Mol Cell 9, 45-47, 2002). Surprisingly, only about 2% of all genes are regulated by histone acetylation as estimated based on differential display analysis of 340 genes and TSA as the reference HDI (von Lint et al. Gene Expression 5, 245-253, 1996). New studies with SAHA in multiple myeloma cells showed that these transcriptional changes can be grouped into distinct functional gene classes important for eg regulation of apoptosis or proliferation (Mitsiades et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci 101, pp540, 2004).<br>
Substrates different to histone proteins exist. For HDACs these include transcription factors like p53 and TFII E / or chaperones like Hsp90 (Johnstone &amp; Licht, Cancer Cell 4, 13-18, 2003). Therefore the correct name for HDACs would be lysine-specific protein deacetylases. As a consequence of these findings, inhibitors of HDACs effect not only chromatin structure and gene transcription but also protein function and stability by regulating protein acetylation in general. This function of HDACs in protein acetylation might also be important for understanding of immediate gene repression by treatment with HDIs (von Lint et al. Gene Expression 5, 245-253, 1996). In this regard, proteins involved in oncogenic transformation, apoptosis regulation and malignant cell growth are of particular importance.<br>
Different publications  highlight the  importance  of histone  acetylation  for  cancer development<br>
(reviewed by Kramer et al. Trends Endocrin Metabol 12, 294-300, 2001; Marks et al. Nature Cancer<br>
Rev 1,194-202, 2001). These diseases include<br>
(i)	mutations  of the HAT cAMP response element binding protein  (CBP)  associated with<br>
Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, a cancer predisposition (Murata et al. Hum Mol Genet 10, 1071-<br>
1076, 2001), (ii)        aberrant recruitment of HDAC1 activity by transcription factors in acute promyelocytic<br>
leukemia (APL) by the PML-retinoic acid receptor a fusion gene (He et al. Nat genet 18,126-<br>
135,1998) (iii)       aberrant recruitment of HDAC activity by the overexpressed BCL6 protein in non-Hodgkins<br>
lymphoma (Dhordain et al. Nuceic Acid Res 26,4645-4651,1998) and finally<br>
2<br><br>
(iv) aberrant recruitment of HDAC activity by the AML-ETO fusion protein in acute myelogenous leukemia (AML M2 subtype; Wang et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 95, 10860-10865, 1998). In this AML subtype, the recruitment of HDAC1 activity causally leads to gene silencing, a differentiation block and oncogenic transformation.<br>
(v) HDAC1 gene knock-out in mice showed that HDAC1 has a profound function m embryonal stem cell proliferation by repressing cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21wal&gt; and p27k'P&gt; (Lagger et al. Embo J. 21, 2672-2681, 2002). Since p21Â»*fl is induced by HDIs in many cancer cell lines, HDAC1 might be a crucial component in cancer cell proliferation as well. Initial siRNA based gene-knock down experiments in HeLa cells support this hypothesis (Glaser et al. 310, 529-536, 2003).<br>
(vi) HDAC2 is overexpressed in colon carcinoma upon constitutive activation of the wnt /fi-catenin/TCF signalling pathay by loss of functional adenomatosis polyposis coli (A PC) protein as reported by Zhu et al. recently (Cancer cell 5, 455-463, 2004).<br>
On the molecular level, a pleithora of published data with various HDAC inhibitors like Trichostatin A (TSA) showed that many cancer relevant genes are up- or down regulated. These include p21wafl, Cyclin E, transforming growth factor fi (TGFfi), p53 or the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor genes, which are upregulated, whereas Bcl-XL, bc!2, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)la, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and cyclin A/D are down-regulated by HDAC inhibition (reviewed by Kramer et al. Trends Endocrin Metabol 12, 294-300, 2001). HDAC inhibitors arrest cells at Gl and G2/M within the cell cycle and deplete S-phase cells, as shown for Depsipeptide as an example (Sandor et al., British J Cancer 83, 817-825, 2000). HDAC inhibitory compounds induce p53 and caspase3/8 independent apoptosis and have broad anti-tumor activity. Anti-angiogenic activity was described also, which might be related to down-regulation of VEGF and HIFla. In summary, HDAC inhibition effects tumor cells at different molecular levels and multiple cellular proteins are targeted. Interestingly, HDAC inhibitors were found to induce cellular differentiation and this pharmacological activity might contribute to their anti-cancer activity as well. For example it was shown recently that suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) induces differentiation of breast cancer cell lines, exemplified by resynthesis of milk fat membrane globule protein (MFMG), milk fat globule protein and lipid (Munster et al. Cancer Res. 61, 8492, 2001).<br>
There is growing rational for synergism of HDAC inhibitors with chemotherapeutic as well as target specific cancer drugs. For example, synergism was shown for SAHA with the kinase / cdk inhibitor flavopiridol (Alemenara et al. Leukemia 16, 1331-1343, 2002), for LAQ-824 with the bcr-abl kinase inhibitor Glivec in CML cells (Nimmanapalli et al. Cancer Res. 63, 5126-5135, 2003), for SAHA and Trichostatin A (TSA) with etoposide (VP16), cisplatin and doxorubicin (Kim et al. Cancer Res. 63, 7291-7300, 2003) and LBH589 with the hsp90 inhibitor 17-allyl-amino-demethoxy-geIdanamycin (17-AAG; George et al. Blood online, Oct.28, 2004). Also it was shown that HDAC inhibition causes reexpression of estrogen or androgen receptors in breast and prostate cancer cells with the potential to resensitize these tumors to anti-hormone therapy (Yang et al. Cancer Res. 60, 6890-6894, 2000; Nakayama et al. Lab Invest 80,1789-1796, 2000).<br>
HDAC inhibitors from various chemical classes were described in the literature with four most important classes, namely (i) hydroxamic acid analogs, (ii) benzamide analogs, (iii) cyclic peptides / peptolides and (iv) fatty acid analogs. A comprehensive summary of known HDAC inhibitors was published recently by Miller et al. (J Med Chem 46, 5097-5116, 2003). There is only limited data published regarding specificity of these histone deacetylase inhibitors. In general most hydroxamate based HDI are not specific regarding class I and II HDAC enzymes. For example. TSA inhibits HDACs 1, 3, 4, 6 and 10 with IC5o values around 20nM, whereas HDAC8 was inhibited with IC50 = 0.49 uM (Tatamiya et al, AACR Annual Meeting 2004, Abstract #2451). But there are exceptions like the experimental HDI Tubacin, selective for the class II enzyme HDAC 6 (Haggarty et al. Proc natl Acad Sci USA 100, 4389-4394, 2003). In addition, data on class I selectivity of benzamide HDIs are emerging. MS-275 inhibited class I HDAC1 and 3 with IC50 = 0.51 uM and 1.7(.LM, respectively. In contrast class II HDACs 4, 6, 8 and 10 were inhibited with IC50 values of &gt;100uM, &gt;100uM, 82.5uM and 94.7uM, respectively (Tatamiya et al, AACR Annual Meeting 2004, Abstract #2451). So far it is not clear if specificity towards HDAC class I or II enzymes or a defined single isoenzyme should be superior regarding therapeutic efficacy and index.<br>

Clinical studies in cancer with HDAC inhibitors are on-going, namely with SAHA (Merck Inc.), Valproic acid, FK228 / Depsipeptide (Gloucester Pharmaceuticals / NCI), MS275 (Berlex-Schering ), NVP LBH-589 (Novartis), PXD-101 (Topotarget / Curagen), MGCD0103 (Methylgene Inc) and Pivaloyloxymethylbutyrate / Pivanex (Titan Pharmaceuticals). These studies showed first evidence of clinical efficacy, highlighted recently by partial and complete responses with FK228 / Depsipeptide in patients with peripheral T-cell lymphoma (Plekarz et al. Blood, 98, 2865-2868, 2001) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma by SAHA (Kelly et al. ]. Clin. Oncol. 23, 3923-3931, 2005).<br>
Recent publications also showed possible medical use of HDAC inhibitors in disease different to cancer. These diseases include systemic lupus erythematosus (Mishra et a. J Clin Invest 111, 539-552, 2003, Reilly et al. J. Immunol. 173, 4171-4178, 2004), rheumatoid arthritis (Chung et al. Mol Therapy 8, 707-717, 2003; Nishida et al. Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology 50, 3365-3376, 2004), inflammatory diseases (Leoni et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 99, 2995-3000, 2002) and neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington's disease (Steffan et al. Nature 413, 739-743, 2001, Hockly et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 100(4) :2041-6, 2003).<br>
Cancer chemotherapy was established based on the concept that cancer cells with uncontrolled proliferation and a high proportion of cells in mitosis are killed preferentially. Standard cancer chemotherapeutic drugs finally kill cancer cells upon induction of programmed cell death ("apoptosis") by targeting basic cellular processes and molecules, namely RNA/DNA (alkylating and carbamylating agents, platin analogs and topoisomerase inhibitors), metabolism (drugs of this class are named anti-metabolites) as well as the mitotic spindle apparatus (stabilizing and destabilizing tubulin inhibitors). Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDIs) constitute a new class of anti cancer drugs with differentiation and apoptosis inducing activity. By targeting histone deacetylases, HDIs effect histone (protein) acetylation and chromatin structure, inducing a complex transcriptional reprogramming, exemplified by reactivation of tumor suppressor genes and repression of oncogenes. Beside effecting acetylation of N-terminal lysine residues in core histone proteins, non-histone targets important for cancer cell biology like heat-shock-protein 90 (Hsp90) or the p53 tumor suppressor protein exist. The medical use of HDIs might not be restricted to cancer therapy, since efficacy in models for inflammatory diseases, rheumatoid arthritis and neurodegeneration was shown.<br>
Benzoyl or acetyl substituted pyrrolyl propenamides are described in the public literature as HDAC-inhibitors, whereas the connectivity of the acyl-group is at position 2 or 3 of the pyrrole scaffold. (Mai et.al., Journal Med.Chem. 2004, Vol. 47, No. 5, 1098-1109; or Ragno et al., Journal Med.Chem. 2004, Vol. 47, No. 5, 1351-1359). Further pyrrolyl substituted hydroxamic acid derivatives are described in US4960787 as lipoxygenase inhibitors or in US6432999 as cyclooxygenase inhibitors. Various compounds, which are said to be HDAC inhibitors, are reported in WO 01/38322; Journal Med. Chem. 2003, Vol. 46, No. 24, 5097-5116; Journal Med. Chem. 2003, Vol. 46, No. 4, 512-524; Journal Med. Chem. 2003, Vol. 46, No. 5, 820-830; and in Current Opinion Drug Discovery 2002, Vol. 5, 487-499.<br>
There remains a need in the art for new, well-tolerated and more efficacious inhibitors of HDACs.<br>

When the protective groups PG2 or PG3 are deprotected or purification is carried out under the presence of an inorganic or organic acid (e.g. hydrochloric acid or formic acid), the compounds of formula 1 may be obtained -depending on their individual chemical nature and the individual nature of the acid used- as free base or containing said acid in an stoechiometric or non-stoechiometric quantity. The amount of the acid contained can be determined according to art-known procedures, e.g. by titration.<br>
When the compounds of formula I are chiral compounds (e.g. by having one or more chiral centers), the invention refers to all conceivable stereoisomers, like e.g. diastereomers and enantiomers, in substantially pure form as well as in any mixing ratio, including the racemates, as well as the salts thereof.<br>
In general, enantiomerically pure compounds of this invention may be prepared according to art-known processes, such as e.g. via asymmetric syntheses using chiral synthons or chiral reagents; by chromatographic separation on chiral separating columns; by means of salt formation of the racemic compounds with optically active acids or bases, subsequent resolution of the salts and release of the<br>
73<br><br>
desired compound from the salt; by derivatization with chiral auxiliary reagents, subsequent diastereomer separation and removal of the chiral auxiliary group; or by (fractional) crystallization from a suitable solvent.<br>
The reactions mentioned above can be expediently carried out analogously to the methods known to the person skilled in the art or as described by way of example in the following examples.<br>
It is moreover known to the person skilled in the art that if there are a number of reactive centers on a starting or intermediate compound it may be necessary to block one or more reactive centers temporarily by protective groups in order to allow a reaction to proceed specifically at the desired reaction center. A detailed description for the use of a large number of proven protective groups is found, for example, in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" by T. Greene and P. Wuts (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 1999, 3rd Ed.) or in "Protecting Groups (Thieme Foundations Organic Chemistry Series N Group" by P. Kocienski (Thieme Medical Publishers, 2000).<br>
The isolation and purification of the substances according to the invention is carried out in a manner known per se, e.g. by distilling off the solvent in vacuo and recrystallizing the resulting residue from a suitable solvent or subjecting it to one of the customary purification methods, such as, for example, column chromatography on suitable support material.<br>
Optionally, compounds of formula I can be converted into their salts, or, optionally, salts of the compounds of formula I can be converted into the free compounds of formula I.<br>
Salts are obtained by dissolving the free compound in a suitable solvent (e.g. a ketone, such as acetoÂ¬ne, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone, an ether, such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran or dioxane, a chlorinated hydrocarbon, such as methylene chloride or chloroform, or a low molecular weight aliphatic alcohol such as methanol, ethanol or isopropanol) which contains the desired acid or base, or to which the desired acid or base is then added. The salts are obtained by filtering, reprecipitating, precipitating with a nonsolvent for the addition salt or by evaporating the solvent. Salts obtained can be converted by alkalization or by acidification into the free compounds, which in turn can be converted into salts. In this way, pharmacologically or pharmaceutically intolerable salts can be converted into pharmacologically tolerable salts.<br>
Suitably, the conversions mentioned in this invention can be carried out analogously or similarly to methods which are familiar per se to the person skilled in the art.<br>
The person skilled in the art knows on the basis of his/her knowledge and on the basis of those synthesis routes, which are shown and described within the description of this invention, how to find other possible synthesis routes for compounds of the formula I. All these other possible synthesis routes are also part of this invention.<br>
The present invention also relates to intermediates, including their salts, methods and processes useful in synthesizing compounds according to this invention.<br>
Having described the invention in detail, the scope of the present invention is not limited only to those described characteristics or embodiments. As will be apparent to persons skilled in the art, modifications, analogies, variations, derivations, homologisations and adaptations to the described invention can be made on the base of art-known knowledge and/or, particularly, on the base of the disclosure (e.g. the explicite, implicite or inherent disclosure) of the present invention without departing from the spirit and scope of this inventionas defined by the scope of the appended claims.<br>
The following examples serve to illustrate the invention further without restricting it. Likewise, further compounds of the formula I including their salts, whose preparation is not explicitly described, can be prepared in an analogous manner or in a manner familiar per se to the person skilled in the art using customary process techniques.<br>

Commercial utility<br>
The compounds according to this invention have valuable pharmacological properties and effects, which make them commercially applicable, such as e.g. they are commercially utilizable by properties related with inhibiting histone deacetylase activity and function.<br>
"Histone deacetylase" (HDAC) means an enzyme with an activity towards the s-acetyl group of lysine residues within a substrate protein. HDAC substrates are histone H2A, H2B, H3 or H4 proteins and isoforms but substrate proteins different to histones like, but not limited to, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), tubulin or the tumor suppressor protein p53 exist. In particular histone deacetylases catalyse the hydrolysis the e-acetyl group of lysine residues within these substrate proteins, forming the free amino group of lysine.<br>
Inhibition of histone deacetylase by compounds according to this invention means inhibiting the activity and function of one or more HDAC isoenzymes, in particular isoenzymes selected from the so far known histone deacetylases, namely HDAC 1, 2, 3 and 8 (class I) and HDAC 4, 5, 6, 7,10 (class II), HDAC 11 as well as the NAD+ dependent class III (Sir2 homologues). In some preferred embodiment this inhibition is at least about 50%, more preferable at least 75% and still more preferable above 90%. Preferably, this inhibition is specific to a specific histone deacetylase class (eg HDAC class I enzymes), a selection of isoenzymes of highest pathophysiological relevance (eg HDAC 1, 2, 3 enzymes) or a single isoenzyme (eg the HDAC 1 enzyme). A histone deacetylase inhibitor in the meaning of this invention is therefore a compound capable of interacting with a histone deacetylase and inhibiting its activity, in particular its enzymatic activity. In this context "head group" defines the residues within a histone deacetylase inhibitor responsible for interacting with the active site of the enzyme, eg the Zn2+ ion.<br>
The inhibition of histone deacetylases is determined in biochemical assays of various formats and sources of enzymatic activity. HDAC activity is used either derived from nuclear or cellular extracts or by heterologous expression of defined HDAC isoenzymes in E.coli, insect cells or mammalian cells. Since HDAC isoenzymes are active in multiprotein complexes and form homo- and heterodimeres, nuclear extracts derived from human cancer cells, for example the human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa, are preferred. These nuclear extracts contain class I and class II enzymes, but are enriched in class I enzymes. For expression of recombinant HDAC isoenzymes, mammalian expression systems like HEK293 cells are preferred. The HDAC isoenzyme is expressed as a fusion protein with an affinity tag, like the FLAG epitope. By affinity chromatography, the tagged protein is purified alone or in complex with endogenous proteins (eg other HDAC isoenzmyes and coactivators / platform proteins). The biochemical assays are well described and well known to persons skilled in the art. As substrates, histone proteins, peptides derived from histone proteins or other HDAC substrates as well as acetylated lysine mimetics are used. One preferred promiscuous HDAC substrate is the tripeptide Ac-NH-GGK(Ac), coupled with the fluorophore 7-aminomethylcoumarin (AMC).<br>
The invention further relates to the use of the compounds according to this invention for inhibiting histone deacetylase activity in cells and tissues, causing hyperacetylation of substrate proteins and as functional consequence, for example, the induction or repression of gene expression, induction of protein degradation, cell cycle arrest, induction of differentiation and/or induction of apoptosis.<br>
The cellular activity of a histone deacetylase inhibitor includes any cellular effect related to histone deacetylase inhibition, in particular protein hyperacetylation, transcriptional repression and activation, induction of apoptosis, differentiation and / or cytotoxicity.<br>
The term "induction of apoptosis" and analogous terms are used to identify a compound which executes programmed cell death in cells contacted with that compound. "Apoptosis" is defined by complex biochemical events within the contacted cell, such as the activation of cysteine specific proteinases ("caspases") and the fragmentation of chromatin. Induction of apoptosis in cells contacted with the compound might not necessarily coupled with inhibition of cell proliferation or cell differentiation. Preferably, the inhibition of proliferation, induction of differentiation and/or induction of apoptosis is specific to cells with aberrant cell growth.<br>
99<br><br>
"Induction of differentiation" is defined as a process of cellular reprogramming leading to a reversible or irreversible cell cycle arrest in GO and re-expression of a subset of genes typical for a certain specialized normal cell type or tissue (eg re-expression of milk fat proteins and fat in mammary carcinoma cells).<br>
"Cytotoxicity" in general means arresting proliferation and/or inducing apoptotic cell death in vitro in mammalian cells, in particular human cancer cells.<br>
Assays for quantification of cell proliferation, apoptosis or differentiation are well known to experts and state of the art. For example, metabolic activity which is linked to cellular proliferation is quantified using the Alamar Blue / Resazurin assay (O* Brian et al. Eur j Biochem 267, 5421-5426, 2000) and induction of apoptosis is quantified by measurement of chromatin fragmentation with the cell death detection ELISA commercialized by Roche. Examples for cellular assays for the determination of hyperacetylation of HDAC substrates are given by measuring core histone acetylation using specific antibodies by Western blotting, reporter gene assays using respective responsive promoters or promoter elements (eg the p21 promotor or the spl site as responsive element) or finally by image analysis again using acetylation specific antibodies for core histone proteins.<br>
Compounds according to this invention can be commercially applicable due to their HDAC inhibitory, anti-proliferative and/or apoptosis inducing activity, which may be beneficial in the therapy or prophylaxis of diseases responsive thereto, such as e.g. any of those diseases mentioned herein.<br>
The invention further relates to a method for treating, ameliorating or preventing cellular neoplasia by adminstration of an effective amount of a compound according to this invention to a mammal, in particular a human in need of such treatment. A "neoplasia" is defined by cells displaying aberrant cell proliferation and/or survival and/or a block in differentiation. The term "neoplasia" includes benign neoplasia, which is described by hyperproliferation of cells, incapable of forming an aggressive, metastasizing tumor in-vivo, and, in contrast, malignant neoplasia, which is described by cells with multiple cellular and biochemical abnormalities, capable of forming a systemic disease, for example forming tumor metastasis in distant organs.<br>
Compounds according to this invention can be particularly used for the treatment of malignant neoplasia, also described as cancer, characterized by tumor cells finally metastasizing into distinct organs or tissues. Examples of malignant neoplasia treated with compounds according to the present invention include solid and hematological tumors. Solid tumors are exemplified by tumors of the breast, bladder, bone, brain, central and peripheral nervus system, colon, endocrine glands (e.g. thyroid and adrenal cortex), esophagus, endometrium, germ cells, head and neck, kidney, liver, lung, larynx and hypopharynx, mesothelioma, ovary, pancreas, prostate, rectum, renal, small intestine, soft tissue, testis, stomach, skin, ureter, vagina and vulva. Malignant neoplasia include inherited cancers exemplified by Retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor. In addition, malignant neoplasia include primary tumors in said organs and corresponding secondary tumors in distant organs ("tumor metastases"). Hematological tumors are exemplified by aggressive and indolent forms of leukemia and lymphoma, namely non-Hodgkins disease, chronic and acute myeloid leukemia (CML / AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), Hodgkins disease, multiple myeloma and T-cell lymphoma. Also included are myelodysplastic syndrome, plasma cell neoplasia, paraneoplastic syndromes, cancers of unknown primary site as well as AIDS related malignancies.<br>
It is to be noted that a cancer disease as well as a malignant neoplasia does not necessarily require the formation of metastases in distant organs. Certain tumors exert devastating effects on the primary organ itself through their aggressive growth properties. These can lead to the destruction of the tissue and organ structure finally resulting in failure of the assigned organ function.<br>
Neoplastic cell proliferation might also effect normal cell behaviour and organ function. For example the formation of new blood vessels, a process described as neovascularization, is induced by tumors or tumor metastases. Compounds according to this invention can be commercially applicable for treatment of pathophysiological relevant processes caused by benign or neoplastic cell proliferation,<br>
100<br><br>
such as but not limited to neovascularization by unphysiological proliferation of vascular endothelial cells.<br>
Drug resistance is of particular importance for the frequent failure of standard cancer therapeutics. This drug resistance is caused by various cellular and molecular mechanisms like overexpression of drug efflux pumps, mutation within the cellular target protein or fusion proteins formed by chromosomal translocations. The commercial applicability of compounds according to the present invention is not limited to 1st line treatment of patients. Patients with resistance to cancer chemotherapeutics or target specific anti-cancer drugs can be also amenable for treatment with these compounds for e.g. 2nd or 3rd line treatment cycles. A prominent example is given by acute promyelocytic leukemia patients with the PML-RARa fusion protein, resistant to standard therapy with retinoids. These patients can be resensitized towards retinoids by treatment with HDAC inhibitory drugs like the compounds according to the present invention.<br>
The invention further provides to a method for treating a mammal, in particular a human, bearing a disease different to cellular neoplasia, sensitive to histone deacetylase inhibitor therapy comprising administering to said mammal a pharmacologically active and therapeutically effective and tolerable amount of a compound according to this invention. These non malignant diseases include (i)      arthropathies and osteopathological diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthrtis, gout,<br>
polyarthritis and psoriatic arthritis (ii)     autoimmune diseases like systemic lupus erythematosus and transplant rejection (iii)    hyperproliferative diseases such as psoriasis or smooth muscle cell proliferation including<br>
vascular proliferative disorders, atherosclerosis and restenosis (iv)    acute and chronic inflammatory diseases and dermal diseases such as ulcerative colitis, Crohns  disease,  allergic  rhinitis,  allergic  dermatitis,  cystic  fibrosis,  chronic  obstructive bronchitis and asthma (v)     endometriosis, uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia and benign prostate hyperplasia (vi)    cardiac dysfunction<br>
(vii)   inhibiting immunosuppressive conditions like HIV infections (viii) neuropathological disorders like Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease or polyglutamine<br>
related disorders (ix)    pathological conditions amenable to treatment by potentiating of endogenous gene expression as well as enhancing transgene expression in gene therapy.<br>

Biological Investigations<br>
Isolation of HP AC activity from HeLa cell nuclei:<br>
HDAC activity is isolated from nuclear HeLa extracts according to a method original described by Dignam et al. (Nucl. Acids Res. 11, ppl475, 1983). Briefly, nuclei isolated from HeLa cells (CIL SA, Seneffe, Belgium) are resuspended in buffer C (20mM Hepes pH 7.9, 25% v:v glycerol, 0.42M NaCl, 1.5mM MgCl2, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM PefaBloc and 0.5mM DTT) and stirred for 30min on ice. After centrifugation, the supernatant is dialysed against buffer D (40mM Tris HCl pH 7.4, lOOmM KC1, 0.2mM EDTA, 0.5mM DTT and 25% v:v glycerol) for 5h at 4Â°C. After dialysis and centrifugation, the supernatant is stored in aliquots at -80Â°C and used for Western blot analysis as well as the enzymatic assay as described in the following.<br>
Isolation of rHDACl<br>
Human HDACl fused with the flag epitope is stably expressed in Hek293 cells. After mass cultivation in DMEM with supplements and 2% fetal calf serum, cells are lysed and flag-HDACl purified by M2-agarose affinity chromatography as described (Sigma Art. No. A-2220). Fractions from the purification are analysed by Western blot as well as for enzymatic activity as described below.<br>
Fluorimetric HDAC activity assay:<br>
The HDAC enzyme activity assay is done as described by Wegener et al. (Chem. &amp; Biol. 10, 61-68,<br>
2003). Briefly 40ul of a 1:100 dilution ( = 0.4ul) nuclear HeLa extract (mixture of class I and II HDACs),<br>
109<br><br>
29 ul enzyme buffer (15mM Tris HC1 pH 8.1, 0.25mM EDTA, 250mM NaCl, 10% v:v glycerol) and lul test compound are added to a well of a 96well microtiter plate and reaction started by addition of 30ul substrate (Ac-NH-GGK(Ac)-AMC; final concentration 25uM and final volume lOOul). After incubation for 90min at 30Â°C, reaction is terminated by the addition of 25ul stop solution (50mM Tris HC1 pH 8, lOOmM NaCl, 0.5mg/ml trypsine and 2uM TSA). After incubation at room temperature for further 40min, fluorescence is measured using a Wallac Victor 1420 multilabel counter (Ex 355nm, Em 460nm) for quantification of AMC (7-amino-4-methylcoumarin) generated by trypsine cleavage of the deacetylated peptide. For the calculation of IC50 values the fluorescence in wells without test compound (1% DMSO, negative control is set as 100% enzymatic activity and the fluorescence in wells with 2uM TSA (positive control) are set at 0% enzymatic activity. The corresponding IC50 values of the compounds for HDAC inhibitory activity are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.<br>
The HDAC1 enzymatic assay is done with slight modifications with recombinant flag-HDACl protein isolated from HEK293 cell lysates. About 14ng/well flag-HDACl are incubated with 6uM Ac-NH-GGK(Ac)-AMC substrate for 3h at 30Â°C. Termination of the reaction and all further steps are done as described for HeLa cell nuclear extracts as a source for HDAC enzymatic activity.<br>

Cellular histone H3 acetylation assay:<br>
To assess the cellular efficacy of an histone deactylase inhibitor in vitro, an assay is set up in black clear-bottom 96-well plates and optimized for use on the Cellomics "ArrayScan II" platform for a quantitative calculation of histone acetylation. The protocol uses a polyclonal rabbit antibody, specifically binding to acetylated lysine 9 + 14 of human histone H3 on fixed cells with an Alexa Fluor 488 labeled goat anti rabbit-IgG used for counterstaining (modified from Braunger et al. AACR annual conference 2003, Abstract 4556).<br>
5xl03 HeLa cervical carcinoma cells/well (ATCC CCL-2) in 200ul Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum are seeded at day 1 in Packard view plates and incubated for 24h under standard cell culture conditions. On day 2, 2ul test compound (lOOx final concentration) is added and incubation continued for further 24h. On day 3, the culture medium is discarded and attached cells fixed for 15min at room temperature by addition of lOOul fixation buffer (3.7% v:v formaldehyde in phosphate buffered saline / PBS). After discarding the fixation buffer and one wash with PBS, cells are permeabilized at room temperature by addition of lOOul/well permeabilization buffer (30,8 mM NaCl, 0,54 mM Na2HP04, 0,31 mM KH2PO4, 5% v:v Triton X-100)<br>

for 15min at room temperature. After discarding the permeabilization buffer and washing twice with 100|.J/well blocking solution (PBS with 0.05% v:v Tween 20 and 5% w:v milk powder) at room temperature, the 1st antibody (anti-K9+14 histone H3 antibody, Calbiochem No. 382158) in blocking solution (50(J/well) is added. After incubation for lh at 37Â°C, the wells are washed twice at room temperature with 100ul/ well blocking solution before additon of the 2nd antibody (goat-anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488; MoBiTec No. A-11008) in blocking solution (50ul/ well). After further incubation for lh at 37Â°C, wells are washed twicewith 100|il/ well blocking solution room temperature. Finally, 100|.J/well PBS are added and image analysis performed on the Cellomics "ArrayScan II" platform. For calculation of EC50 values, the nuclear fluorescence in cells treated with and without a reference HDAC inhibitor (eg NVP-LBH-589) are taken as a positive and negative control. For EC50 determination, the percentage of positive cells is determined and EC50 calculation done from concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.<br>

Cellular cytotoxicity assay:<br>
The anti-proliferative activity of the histone deacetylase inhibitory compounds as described herein, is evaluated with the HeLa cervical carcinoma cell line (ATCC CCL2) using the Alamar Blue (Resazurin) cell viability assay (O'Brien et al. Eur J Biochem 267, 5421-5426, 2000). Resazurin is reduced to the fluorescent resorufin by cellular dehydrogenase activity, correlating with viable, proliferating cells. Test compounds are dissolved as 10 mM solutions in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and subsequently diluted in semi-logarithmic steps. HeLa cells are seeded into 96 well flat bottom plates at a density of 3000 cells per well in a volume of 200 ul per well. 24 hours after seeding 1 ul each of the compound dilutions are added into each well of the 96 Well plate. Each compound dilution is tested as quadruplicates. Wells containing untreated control cells are filled with 200 ul DMEM medium containing 0.5% v:v DMSO. The cells are then incubated with the substances for 48 hours at 37Â°C in a humidified athmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. To determine the viability of the cells, 20 ul of an Resazurin solution (Sigma; 90mg / 1) are added. After 4 hours incubation at 37Â°C the fluorescence is measured at an extinction of 544 nm and an emission of 590 ran. For the calculation of the cell viability the emission value from untreated cells is set as 100% viability and the emission rates of treated cells are set in relation to the values of untreated cells. Viabilities are expressed as % values. The corresponding IC50 values of the compounds for cytotoxic activity are determined from the concentration-effect curves by means of non-linear regression.<br>

Apoptosis induction<br>
The induction of apoptosis is measured by using the cell death detection ELISA (Art. No. 1774425, Roche Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany). A549 NSCLC cells are seeded into 96 well flat bottom plates at a density of 3x10 E3 cells/well in a total volume of lOOul/well. 24 hours after seeding, lul each of the compound dilutions in DMEM are added in a total volume of 100ul into each well Final volume 200ul/well). Each compound dilution is tested at least as triplicates. Wells containing untreated control cells are filled with 200nl DMEM containing 0.5 vol% DMSO. The cells are incubated with test compound for 48 hours at 37Â°C in a humidified athmosphere containing 5% carbon dioxide. As a positive control for the induction of apoptosis, cells are treated with 50|iM Cisplatin (Gry Pharmaceuticals, Kirchzarten, Germany). Medium is then removed and the cells lysed in 200 ul lysis buffer. After centrifugation as described by the manufacturer, 10 ul of cell lysate is processed as described in the protocol. The degree of apoptosis is calculated as follows: The absorbance at 405 nm obtained with lysates from cells treated with 50uM cisplatin is set as 100 cpu (cisplatin units), while an absorbance at 405 nm of 0.0 is set as 0.0 cpu. The degree of apoptosis is expressed as cpu in relation to the value of 100 cpu reached with the lysates obtained from cells treated with 50uM cisplatin.<br>
