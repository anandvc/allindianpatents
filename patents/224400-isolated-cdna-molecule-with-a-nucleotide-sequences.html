				<td>GENE ENCODING LABYRINTHIN, A MARKER FOR CANCER<br>
The invention relates to a gene encoding a protein and peptides therefrom that<br>
includes an epitope, a cancer associated antigen, useful as a marker that is not<br>
restricted to previously defined histological classes of cancer. Antigenic peptides are useful as a vaccine for treatment and prevention of cancer, and for the preparation of new, specific, monoclonal antibodies. Antisense molecules are useful in pharmaceutical compositions and are useful for diagnosis and treatment.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Cancer1 is a leading cause of death in men and women throughout the world.<br>
In the United States alone, over I million new cases are diagnosed each year, and over 0.5 million deaths are reported annually (Landis, et al., 1998). Historically, tumors are grouped and treated, based in part by the tissues in which they arise, e.g.- breast cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer, and the like. Yet, within lung cancer, for example, it is well recognized that these tumors are a very heterogeneous group of neoplasms. This is also true for tumors arising in other tissues. In part, because of<br>
this heterogeneity, there are complex and inconsistent classification schemes which<br>
are used for human tumors. Previous attempts to treat cancer have been hampered by :<br>
1) the arbitrary classification of tumors arising within given tissues, and 2) by using<br>
microscopic methods based on how these tumors look (histological classification).<br>
Although existing classifications for<br>
Terminology used herein is as follows, "cancer is a malignant tumor, wherein a<br>
"tumor" is an abnormal mass of tissue, that need not be malignant. "Neoplasm"<br>
is a form of new growth.<br>
various tumor types have some prognostic value, almost all of the<br>
classifications fail to predict responsiveness to treatments and likelihood of<br>
cure or disease course. Improved classification schemes based on the<br>
biological constitution of these neoplasms is required to significantly alter the<br>
survival statistics of humans who have cancer. One approach to solving<br>
these problems is to locate molecules specific to tumors, preferably antigens<br>
in molecules that are markers for cancer cells. (A "marker" is defined herein<br>
as any property which can be used to distinguish cancer from normal tissues<br>
and from other disease states.) The markers' presence is then a basis for<br>
classification.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies (MCAs) prepared by somatic cell hybridization<br>
techniques, usually in mice, are useful molecular probes for the detection and<br>
discrimination of cellular antigens, and therefore have great potential for<br>
detecting cancer associated antigens. These antibodies bind to specific<br>
antigens and the binding is detectable by well known methods. When<br>
binding occurs, the inference is made that a specific antigen is present.<br>
Those cancer associated antigens which are exposed to the cell surface or<br>
found in the cancer mass, are molecular targets for the immune systems<br>
(including host antibodies) of the host. Recent findings suggest that cancer<br>
patients who have antibodies against their tumors, do better than those who<br>
do not mount this type of immune response (Livingston, et a/., 1994).<br>
Therefore, natural, induced, or administered antibodies are a promising<br>
therapeutic approach.<br>
The humanization of non-human MCAs (the process by which<br>
non-human MCA reactive sites are shuttled into cloned human antibodies<br>
and expressed) results in reduced immunogenicity of the foreign antibodies<br>
without the loss of their specific binding in in vivo and in ex vivo applications.<br>
MCAs can be used as In vivo imaging aganti, diagnostic taati, and for<br>
inarapy (Radesevteh, etat. 1988,1990 Resen, etal. 1988).<br>
Vaccine therapy is a well established approach directed at inducing an<br>
immune response without exposure to the causative agent of a disease or<br>
condition. Many vaccines are available, for example, to stimulate a response<br>
in a host to bacterial and viral agents. The use of tumor associated antigens<br>
(markers) in a vaccine could prevent primary cancer occurrence, and couid<br>
also provide a means to prevent recurrence of the disease.<br>
Gene therapy is a means by which the genetic make-up of cells is<br>
modified to express the gene of interest. There are many forms of gene<br>
therapy including: gene replacement, antisense suppression therapy, and<br>
surrogate gene expression. Discovering genes encoding cancer-associated,<br>
preferably cancer-specific antigens (markers) opens the door to genetic<br>
intervention against cancer cell proliferation. The accurate and consistent<br>
use of a cancer marker to differentiate cancerous from normal tissue, not only<br>
has diagnostic potential, but is also desirable for treatment and prognosis.<br>
Therefore, such markers have been sought.<br>
Recent studies have shown that the enzyme encoding human aspartyl<br>
beta-hydroxylase (HAAH) is overexpressed in some human adenocarcinoma<br>
cell fines, and in primary hepatocetlular cancers, therefore could be a marker.<br>
The gene said to encode HAAH has been cloned and sequenced (Gronke,<br>
et al., 1989, 1990; Wang, et al., 1991; Jia, et al, 1992, 1994; Korioth, et al.,<br>
1994; Lavaissiere, et al., 1996). However, little is known about HAAH<br>
expression in human tumors in general (Lavaissiere, et al, 1996).<br>
The study of the HAAH enzyme grew out of the study of its bovine<br>
counterpart (Gronke, etaL, 1989, 1990; Wang, etaL, 1991; Jia, et al, 1992).<br>
Bovine aspartyl beta-hydroxylase is an intracellular, glycosylated protein,<br>
localized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The protein has been reported<br>
to have three major species of molecules; a 85 kilodalton form, and two active<br>
forms with molecular weights of 56 and 52 kilodaJtons respectively<br>
(Lavaissiere, et al., 1996).<br>
Using standard biochemical methods, bovine aspartyl<br>
beta-hydroxylese (bAAH) has been purified and characterized (Gronke, et al.<br>
1990; Wang, etaL, 1991). The activity of the enzyme has been shown to be<br>
correlated with the 52 and 56 kilodalton species which were purified<br>
Immunologically, a related higher molecular weight form (85-90 kilodalton) was also<br>
observed. As part of the purification, bAAH is bound to Con A sepharose, which is<br>
consistent with the conclusion that the enzyme is glycosylated. (Subsequent reports<br>
on the DNA sequence show three possible glycosylation sites, with one site being<br>
very close to the known active enzyme domain.) The protein is very acidic in nature,<br>
and a detergent is not required to solubilize the active fraction. The active enzyme<br>
site is dependent from the biochemically isolated bovine protein (bAAH) on the<br>
presence of histidine at position 675 (Jia, et al, 1994).<br>
A partial amino acid sequence was obtained for HAAH. DNA probes (a DNA<br>
probe is a molecule having a nucleotide sequence that is capable of binding to a<br>
specified nucleotide sequence under certain conditions) deduced from this amino acid<br>
sequence was used to screen a bovine cDNA library (Jia, et al, 1992). (A cDNA<br>
library contains the sections of DNA that encode for gene products, e.g. peptides as<br>
opposed to genomic DNA). Several overlapping cDNA sequences in the library<br>
contained a 764 amino acid open reading frame (ORF) sequence which will be<br>
expected to encode an 85 kilodalton protein. Also present in this ORF sequence were<br>
rwo other possible start codons, that is, locations at which encoding begins. The most<br>
3' start codon was preceded by a ribosome binding site. Translation of the clone<br>
having this sequence resulted in a protein that was about 85 kilodaltons. Antiserum<br>
was raised to the membrane fraction of human MG-63 calls and was used to<br>
immunoscreen a cDNA library made from MG-63 cells. Data on one clone was<br>
reported which could encode a 757 amino acid protein, and, by sequence analysis, was<br>
found to have strong N-terminal homology with bAAH (Korioth, et al, 1994). When<br>
this clone was used in an in vitro translation system (an artificial cocktail of normal<br>
cell cytoplasm used to convert mRNA into protein), a 56 kilodalton protein was<br>
produced. It was suggested that this was due to posttranslational cleavage.<br>
The HAAH enzyme is responsible for the modification of specific aspartic<br>
acid residues within the epidermal growth factor-like domains of<br>
proteins. It has been hypothesized that these modified aspartic acid residues<br>
allow the epidermal growth factor-like domains to become calcium binding<br>
domains. (Gronke, et al, 1989,1990; Wang, et al., 1991; Jia, et al, 1992,<br>
1994; Korioth, et al, 1994; Lavaissiere, etai, 1996).<br>
An enzyme related to HAAH, asparty! beta-hydroxylase (AAH), was<br>
first studied because it specifically modified select aspartic acid or<br>
asparagine residues in a group of biologically important proteins including the<br>
vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors VII, IX, and X. Other proteins like C,<br>
S, and 2 also have this modification (Gronke, et al, 1989, 1990; Wang, et al,<br>
1991; Jia, et al, 1992,1994; Korioth, ef a/., 1994; Lavaissiere, et a/., 1996).<br>
Aspartic acid and asparagine residues have been shown to be modified by<br>
HMH in proteins containing epidermal growth factor-like domains. The<br>
function of the beta-hydroxyasparfic and beta-hydroxyasparagine residues is<br>
unknown, however, it-has been speculated that this modification is required<br>
for calcium binding in the epidermal growth factor EGF-iike domains of<br>
selected proteins.<br>
Antibodies were raised to human hepatocellular carcinoma FOCUS<br>
cells (Lavaissiere, et a/., 1990). One MCA reacted with an antigen that was<br>
highly expressed in hepatocellular carcinomas (Lavaissiere, et al., 1996).<br>
fmmunoscreening using this antibody and a lambda gt11 HepG2 library<br>
resulted in the isolation of a partial cDNA, which was subsequently used to<br>
isolate a larger clone.<br>
A human adenocarcinoma cell line designated A549 was reported as<br>
having very high levels of HMH activity (Lavaissiere, et al., 1996). A mouse<br>
monoclonal antibody designated MCA 44-3A6 (U.S. Patent No. 4,816,402)<br>
was produced against the human adenocarcinoma cell line A549 (ATCC<br>
accession number CCL 185) (Radosevich, et a/,, 1985). The antibody<br>
recognized a cell surface, non-glycosylated antigenic protein having an<br>
estimated apparent molecular weight of 40 kDa),<br>
The antigen was expressed by A549 cells, and was found to be a good<br>
adenocarcinoma marker; that is, it was frequently expressed by cancers<br>
which looked like adenocarcinomas when examined histologically<br>
(Radosevich, etal., 1990a; Lee, etal., 1985). MCA44-3A6 is unique in that it<br>
is the first monoclonal antibody which has this binding specificity. The results<br>
from an International Workshop for Lung cancer confirmed other related<br>
published findings on MCA44-3A6 (Stahel, 1994).<br>
The antibody designated MCA 44-3A6 has clinical utility because it<br>
differentiates antigens associated with adenocarcinomas. The normal and<br>
fetal tissue distribution of the antigen is restricted to some glandular tissues<br>
(Radosevich, et a/., 1991). Detection can occur on formalin fixed-paraffin<br>
embedded tissue (Radosevich, etal., 1985, 1988, 1990a, 1990b; Lee, etal.,<br>
1985,1986; Piehl, et al 1988; Combs, etal., 1988b, 1988c; Banner, etal.,<br>
1985). The antibody has a restricted binding pattern within human pulmonary<br>
tumors (Lee, etal., 1985; Banner, et al., 1985; Radosevich, et al, 1990a,<br>
1990b).<br>
In a study of over two hundred pulmonary cancers, MCA 44-3A6 was<br>
found to react with all of the adenocarcinomas tested, many of the large cell<br>
carcinomas, as well as with subsets of intermediate neuroendocrine small cell<br>
lung cancers, well-differentiated neuroendocrine small cell carcinomas,<br>
carcinoids, but not mesotheliomas. MCA 44-3A6 does not react with<br>
squamous cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar carcinoma, or small cell<br>
carcinoma (Lee, et al, 1985). MCA44-3A6 is useful in distinguishing<br>
adenocarcinomas that are metastatic to the pleura from mesothelioma (Lee,<br>
et a/., 1986). The antibody has selected reactivity among adenocarcinomas<br>
and in large cell carcinomas (Piehl, et al, 1988; Radosevich, et al., 1990b).<br>
In a study of over 40 cases of lung cancer comparing cytological and<br>
histological findings, MCA 44-3A6 was found to be useful in cytological<br>
diagnosis and was consistent with the histological finding (Banner, et al,<br>
1985). Histology is the study of tissues (which are made of cells). Cytology<br>
li mo itudy ef cam which have been removed frem the organizational context<br>
which is commonly referred to as tissue. Cells removed from tissues do not<br>
always behave the same as if they were in the tissue from which they were<br>
derived. Fortunately, the antigen detected by MCA 44-3A6 expressed in<br>
adenocarcinoma cells in tissue behaves in the same ways as<br>
adenocarcinoma cells removed from tissues. This is a very diagnostically<br>
important characteristic. Similar correlations using cytologically prepared cell<br>
blocks of pulmonary carcinomas, as well as ACs presenting in body fluids<br>
from other sites throughout the body were demonstrated (Lee, et al/., 1985;<br>
Spagnolo, et al., 1991; Combs, et al., 1988c). Also, MCA44-3A6 binds to<br>
adenocarcinomas from sites other than lung cancer. The expression of the<br>
antigen in primary and metastatic lesions was also reported ( Combs, et al.,<br>
1988a). The utility of the MCA antibody in differentiating cancer from benign<br>
lesions in human breast tissue was also noted (Duda, et al, 1991).<br>
The cellular localization of the antigen detected by MCA 44-3A6 was<br>
determined. By using live cell radioimmunoassays (a radioactive antibody<br>
test directed at determining binding of the antibody to live cells),<br>
immunofluorescence, and live cell fluorescence activated cell sorter (FACS)<br>
analysis, the antigen detected by MCA 44-3A6, was shown to be on the<br>
outside surface of the cell (Radosevich, etal., 1985). Additional studies<br>
using immunogold-electron microscopy and FACS analysis have<br>
demonstrated that this antigen is non-modulated (that is not internalized by<br>
the cancer cell when bound by an antibody), is expressed on the extracellular<br>
surface of the plasma membrane, and is not cell cycle specific that is, the cell<br>
makes protein all the time it is going through the process of cell replication,<br>
and also when it is not dividing (Radosevich, et a/., 1991). The antigen is not<br>
found in the serum of normal or tumor bearing patients, and is not shed into<br>
the culture media by positive cell lines (that is, cancer cells are known to bleb<br>
off portions of their cell membranes and release them into the surrounding<br>
fluid.) (Radosevich, et at., 1985). Recently 3 of 27 randomly tested<br>
adenocarcinoma patients were found to have naturally occurring antibodies<br>
to the antigen. In addition, radiolabeled MCA 44-3A6 was used to localize<br>
A549 tumors growing in nude mice. A douxorubicin immunoconjugate<br>
MCA 44-3A6 is selectively toxic in vitro (Sinkule, ef a/., 1991).<br>
Determination of the nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the antigen<br>
detected by MCA 44-3A6 would enhance the usefulness of this antigen in cancer<br>
diagnosis, treatment and prevention.<br>
BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The antigen detected by the antibody MCA 44-3A6 as described in the<br>
Background is now designated as "Labyrinthin." A gene (designated labyrinthin;<br>
abbreviated lab) characterized by a unique nucleotide sequence that encodes the<br>
antigen detected by MCA 44-3A6 was isolated and characterized, (lab notation<br>
signifies the nucleic DNA/RNA forms; "Lab" notation refers to the protein which is<br>
encoded by the lab DNA/RNA).<br>
The invention described herein used the antibody MCA 44-3A6 as a tool to<br>
done the gene encoding Lab. In addition, an epitope (the necessary binding site for<br>
an antibody found on the antigen) for MCA 44-3 A6 was identified on the Lab protein<br>
expressed by the clone to be PTGEPQ.2 The epitope represents an important<br>
immunodominent sequence; that is, when injected into animals, the animals readily<br>
produce antibodies to this sequence.<br>
An aspect of the invention is the use of lab DNA in the sense3 expression<br>
mode for: 1) the marking of human tumors by nucleotide probes; 2) the detection of<br>
DNA and mRNA expression of lab in cells and tissues; 3) the transformation of cells<br>
into a glandular-like cell type; 4) the production of Lab antigen in vivo for<br>
immunization; 5) the ex vivo expression of Lab for immunization to produce<br>
antibodies; and 6) production of Lab in vitro. Use of an antisense molecule, e.g. by<br>
production of a mRNA or DNA strand in the reverse orientation to a sense molecule,<br>
to suppress the growth of labyrinthin-expTessing (cancerous) cells is another aspect of<br>
the invention.<br>
Standard abbreviations for amino acids.<br>
The normal transcription of a DNA sequence which proceeds from the 3' to the<br>
5' end to produce a mRNA strand from the sense strand of DNA, the mRNA<br>
being complementary to the DNA.<br>
An aspect of the invention is a vector comprising a DNA molecule with a<br>
nucleotide sequence encoding at least an epitope of the Lab antigen, and suitable<br>
regulatory sequences to allow expression in a host cell.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is an ammo acid sequence deduced from the<br>
protein coding region of the lab gene. Selected regions of the sequence were found<br>
via immunological methods, to produce effects corresponding to effects from both<br>
naturally occurring (from cancer cells), chemically produced (synthetically produced<br>
peptides), and expression products of the cloned lab gene.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the use of the entire deduced ammo acid<br>
sequence of Lab, peptides derived from Lab, or chemically produced (synthetic) Lab<br>
peptides, or any combination of these molecules, for use in the preparation of vaccines<br>
to prevent human cancers and/or to treat humans with cancer. For purposes of the<br>
present invention, "humans with cancer" are those persons who have the Lab antigen<br>
detected in their cells. These preparations may also be used to prevent patients from<br>
ever having these tumors prior to their first occurrence.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies directed to the Lab protein, or antigenic components or<br>
derivatives of Lab proteins, are useful for detection of Lab and for other purposes.<br>
Monoclonal antibodies which are made in species other than those which react with<br>
the Lab antigen can be modified by a number of molecular cloning methods such that<br>
they retain their binding with the Labyrinthin peptides, yet are not immunogenic in<br>
humans (Sastry, et a/., 1989; Sambrook, et al, 1990). In brief, this is done by<br>
replacing the binding site sequence of a cloned human antibody gene, with the<br>
binding site sequence of the non-human monoclonal antibody of interest. These<br>
"humanized" MCAs are used as therapeutic and diagnostic reagents, in vivo, ex vivo,<br>
and in vitro.<br>
The use of the Lab protein or antigenic peptides derived therefrom in<br>
diagnostic assays for cancer is a way to monitor patients for the presence and amount<br>
of antibody that they have in their blood or other body fluids or tissue. This detection<br>
is not limited to cancers of a class or classes previously defined, but is useful for<br>
cancer cells that have the Lab marker<br>
antigen. The degree of seroconversion, as measured by techniques known to those of<br>
skill in the art [e.g., ELISA (Engrail and Perlmann, 1971)] may be used to monitor<br>
treatment effects.<br>
Treatment with antisense molecules to lab or antibodies to Lab in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition is an approach to treat patients who have Lab in, or on,<br>
their cancer cells.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Molecular Biology QfJLabyrinthin: To demonstrate that the epitope MCA<br>
44-3A6 is encoded by a protein sequence, high molecular weight DNA from the cell<br>
line A549 was isolated. This DNA was co-precipitated (via calcium) with a plasmid<br>
(pSVneo), and used to transfect a mouse cell line designated B78H1 cells (Albino, el<br>
al, 1985). This mouse cell line is negative for the expression of the epitope and was<br>
reported to have a high frequency of incorporation and expression of any human DNA<br>
sequences. If a given B78H1 cell was in a state to take up DNA, it would be expected<br>
to have taken up both human DNA and the plasmid DNA. The plasmid DNA makes<br>
the cell resistant to G418 (a normally toxic drug). Therefore, if a cell normally<br>
sensitive to G418 growth inhibitor grows in G418, it had to have taken up the<br>
plasmid, and may also have taken up one or more A549 DNA sequences. After G418<br>
selection (a way of choosing only cells which have resistance to growth in G418 by<br>
the uptake/expression of the Neo gene on pSVneo plasmid, and therefore representing<br>
cells that were in a state to uptake other DNA at the same time), approximately 15 of<br>
IxlO5 clones were detected using immunoselection with MCA 44-3A6. This finding<br>
is consistent<br>
with a conclusion that human A549 ceils have DMA that encodes Lab and<br>
possesses the regulatory sequences necessary for the expression of Lab.<br>
Comparison of UAAH and Labvrinthirr, Because the DNA sequence of<br>
lab was determined as an aspect of the present invention, HAAH and lab<br>
could be compared. HAAH and the lab nucleotide sequences have some<br>
internal fragment similarities, but are different on either side of the fragment,<br>
and are related to different products. This conclusion is based in part by the<br>
analysis and homology of the DNA sequences reported for these two genes.<br>
Specifically, the lab 5' region has no homology with HAAH. The protein<br>
coding region of lab has about a 99.6% homology with an internal segment of<br>
the proposed protein coding region for HAAH. The 3' region has no<br>
homology with the HAAH reported sequence. Virtually all of the other data<br>
comparing HAAH and labyrinthin are different, for example: 1) molecular<br>
weights of the proteins, 2) cellular localization, 3) chromosome localization,<br>
4) histological presentation in normal tissues and tumors, 5) northern blot<br>
expression, 6) immunological findings.<br>
Although the protein coding region of lab is identical to an internal<br>
region of the sequence reported for HAAH, the 5' untranslated region of<br>
HAAH is different, and part of the 5' translated protein coding region of HAAH<br>
is missing from that found in the lab clone. From both HAAH and lab clones,<br>
the deduced protein would be expected to be very acidic in nature, and<br>
therefore would run anomolously in SDS gels. As predicted, the Lab protein<br>
migrates anomolously in SDS gels. What was cloned and disclosed in the<br>
present invention migrates identically to the native protein found in several<br>
cell lines. Convincing evidence that the correct gene fragment encoding the<br>
antigen detected by MCA 44-3A6 has been cloned (mRNA) is that when the<br>
recombinant protein is made, that recombinant protein should act (in this<br>
case - have an apparent molecular weight) the same as independent<br>
biologically derived source of that protein. Lab provided from clones has the<br>
characteristics of Lab from cells.<br>
The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by HAAH requires the use of an<br>
open reading frame which would produce a protein that is 85-90 kilodaltons, and does<br>
not take into account that there are several start codons and other shorter open reading<br>
frames. The deduced HAAH protein (biochemically) is glycosylated and the reported<br>
sequence has glycosylation sites ( Korioth, et al, 1994; Lavaisslere, et al, 1996). To<br>
the contrary, Lab is not glycosylated, nor does it have predicted glycosylated sites.<br>
The deduced HAAH amino acid sequence contains a region shared by the Lab<br>
amino acid sequence which is predicted to be very hydrophobic. Lab requires strong<br>
detergents in order to be soluble; HAAH does not, The increased expression of<br>
HAAH (by enzyme activity measurements) in the same cell line (A549) which was<br>
used to clone and study lab extensively, suggests that both of these gene products may<br>
be important to the AC phenotype and that at least A549 cells make both functional<br>
HAAH and Lab. Successful transfections of the antisense to lab into A549 resulted in<br>
a marked decrease in expression of lab and in the growth rate of the cells. The<br>
expression of a sense lab construct in NIH-3T3 cells (normal mouse fibroblasts)<br>
resulted in a marked change in phenotype, a phenotype consistent with that of ACs.<br>
Therefore, lab expression is associated with conversion of normal cells to cancerous<br>
cells. Lab and HAAH have potential calcium binding domains in common.<br>
cDNA Library Contraction and Cloning: A cDNA lambda gtl 1 phage library<br>
was constructed using mRNA which was isolated from actively growing A549 cells<br>
(Sambrook, et alt 1990), This oligo(dT)-primed cDNA was cloned into the Eco RI<br>
site using Eco RI linkers. The library has about 83% clear (containing an insert)<br>
plaques with a liter of 1.2 x 10'°/ml representing a minimum of 1.46 x 106<br>
independent plaques which, by Polymerase Chain Reaction, have insert sizes ranging<br>
from 0.6 to 5 kilobases. Since Lab is a 40 kiJodalton integral protein, (a protein which<br>
is embedded in the plasma membrane) the theoretical full length mRNA encoding this<br>
protein, including a potential leader sequence is estimated to be about 1.1 kilobases.<br>
This library was<br>
immunoscreened using the antibody MCA 44-3A6. Eight independently derived<br>
phage stocks (identical phage which are from the same plaque) were isolated. These<br>
have all been plaque purified by repeated cycles of immunoscreening/isolation. Upon<br>
Eco RI digestion of these eight isolates, inserts of about 2kb were seen. The largest<br>
insert was isolated (2A1A1) and the Eco RI fragment was cloned into the pGEM-3Z<br>
plasmid.<br>
Sequencing and Sequence Analysis: The DNA fragment designated 2A1A1<br>
was found to have an insert of 2442 base pairs in length (FIG. 1), containing a 5'<br>
untranslated region, a ribosome binding site, and a start codon which would be<br>
expected to encode a 255 amino acid protein (FIG. 2). The 3' untranslated region is<br>
remarkable in that it contains only four instability sequences; ATTTA (Xu, et al,<br>
\ 997). In addition there are sequences found in the very 3' end of mRNA's which<br>
result in adenylation of the mRNA (Sambrook, et al.t 1990). The Jab sequence<br>
contains both a sub-optimal (ATTAAA) and optimal (AATAAA) poly-adenylation<br>
site. These are sequences found in the very 3' end of mRNA's which result in<br>
adenylatlon of the mRNA. This finding provides molecular data which supports the<br>
cellular and biochemical data that has been outlined herein. (The HAAH clone has a<br>
poly A signal, but the whole 3' region has not been sequenced.)<br>
A calcium binding site motif is noted in the Lab amino and sequence (FIG. 2),<br>
however, it is out of the known required structural context to be a binding site. In this<br>
case, the calcium limiting sequence is there, but it is not in a protein sequence context<br>
that is known to make it work as a binding site. Homology was noted with lab and an<br>
EST clone (designated #05501) which represented only a portion of the 3'<br>
untranslated region and independently confirmed this portion of the sequence. Some<br>
internal fragment homology is also noted with HAAH, but the 5' untranslated and part<br>
of the 5' translated region is different (58 amino acids), as well as a major portion of<br>
the 3' coding region is missing in lab (FIG. 3).<br>
Genomic DNA Cloning and Analysis: Using a PCR fragment representing the<br>
protein coding region of lab as a probe, a genomic lambda<br>
FIX II library made from the human pulmonary fibroblast cell line WI-38 was<br>
screened. Ten primary plaques were isolated out of approximately 1x106<br>
screened plaques. Using seven of these as target DNA, Polymerase Chain<br>
Reaction conditions were established with primers for the protein coding<br>
region, producing a 765 base pair fragment, the expected protein coding<br>
region for lab. On Northern blots (a method used to qualitatively assess<br>
mRNA) lab only detects one band noted at 2.7 kilobases. The recombinant<br>
protein made from the lab clone, when tested on Western blots (a method<br>
used to qualitatively define proteins) using MCA 44-3A6, has the same<br>
relative mobility as the Lab protein when made by A549 cells.<br>
Lab and HAAH genes give different results in the proteins they<br>
encode. HAAH consistently gives two bands on Northern blot analysis (2.6<br>
and 4.3 kilobases) suggesting that the 2.6 kilobase band is due to alternative<br>
splicing, i.e. the cell cuts and splices the mRNA. Also, if lab and HAAH are<br>
the same gene, HAAH should be detected in all tissues and cancer cell lines<br>
in which Lab is found. However, Lab is not seen on Northern blots of cell<br>
lines EMT6 or QU-DB, nor is there immunoreactivity in these cells; indicating<br>
that Lab mRNA is not made, and that Lab protein is not produced in these<br>
cells. Lab protein is rarely expressed in normal cells, where both the HAAH<br>
mRNA and HAAH protein have been reported to be expressed in almost<br>
every tissue studied.<br>
mRNA Analysis: Northern blot analysis of the DNA fragment from the<br>
A549 cell line using lab cDNA as a probe identified a single band of about 2.7<br>
kilobases. This is expected based on the cDNA (2442 base pairs) and a<br>
poly-A tail of about 300 base pairs. Northern blot analysis of the mouse cell<br>
line, EMT6, and of the human large cell carcinoma cell line, QU-DB, confirm<br>
that no transcript for lab is produced by these cells. This is consistent with<br>
immunoassays which are negative for lab expression on these cells.<br>
Antlsense end Sense eDNA Expression* The plasmld (pBK-CMV)<br>
(Sambrook, ef a/., 1990) may carry either the sense or antisense full length<br>
cDNA lab into A549 and NIH 3T3 cells. An antisense molecule can be, for<br>
example, a complementary sequence to a sense molecule that hybridizes<br>
with the sense molecule, preventing its expression. Using the MTT assay<br>
(Siddique, ef a/., 1992) to assess the growth rate of A549 cells expressing<br>
antisense to lab, a marked reduction in growth rate was noted. The antisense<br>
transfected A549 cells appear to have a greater degree of contact inhibition,<br>
A detectable amount of Lab is reduced in these antisense transfected cells.<br>
N1H-3T3 cells convert from a fibroblast-!ike cell type morphology (large, thin<br>
spindle shaped) to a large, adenocarcinoma appearing cells (very round,<br>
plump) when sense expression occurs,<br>
Chromosome Localization: The chromosome localization for lab, using<br>
full length cDNA as a probe via in situ hybridization (Sambrook, ef a/. 1990) is<br>
tentatively on chromosome 2q12-14, with possibly some reactivity to<br>
chromosomes 4 and 8. Using the same probe (the full length cDNA<br>
sequence of lab) and FACS sorted chromosomes (Lebo, et al. 1985) staining<br>
was also noted on chromosome 2, with weak staining on 4 and none on 8.<br>
The use of genomic clones will be of particular value in resolving these data<br>
because higher stringency hybridization conditions than that allowable for the<br>
cDNA, can be used, thereby reducing background signals. This is yet<br>
another proof that the correct gene was cloned and that the results are not<br>
due to a method artifact. There may be mutations in the genomic DMA of<br>
tumors and for the present invention, DMA was cloned from tumor cells<br>
(A549). Therefore, a mutated gene could have been cloned. However, that<br>
is not the case because the genomic DNA from a normal cell (DMA) produced<br>
the same sequence as what cloned as described herein. Therefore, a normal<br>
gene was cloned from A549 cells. The weak signals on chromosomes 4 and<br>
8 are consistent with a pseudogene or a related gene. For example, HAAH<br>
has been reported to be on chromosome 8q12 by in situ hybridization, so this<br>
result on chromosome 8 could reflect the HAAH and lab sequence homology.<br>
Protein Meleqular CheraetarltBtlon of Labvrlnthliv. Previous work using<br>
Western blot analysis (a qualitative assay to assess antigens) has shown that<br>
the Lab antigen is a 40 kilodalton (by relative mobility) protein detectable in<br>
A549 cells (Radosevich, et al., 1985). The epitope does not appear to be modulated<br>
or blocked by lectins, and is selectively expressed on the cell surface, primarily<br>
localized to the plasma membrane. (Radosevich, et al, 1985,1991). Lab is sensitive<br>
to proteases, but not lipid or carbohydrate altering reactions (Radosevich, et al.,<br>
1985). The biochemical properties of Lab are consistent with Lab being an integral<br>
membrane protein.<br>
Having a deduced amino acid sequence from the lab gene of the present<br>
invention, allows further characterization of the Lab protein. Extensive computer<br>
analysis of Lab has identified a eukaryotic leader-like sequence and theoretical<br>
cleavage site, 3 myristylation sequence sites, a weak membrane anchoring domain<br>
(MAD I), and a strong membrane anchoring domain (MAD II) (FIG. 2). [(In the<br>
HAAH sequence, there are 58 (theoretical) amino acids followed by a sequence<br>
homology in the Lab protein coding sequence and an additional 445 amino acid 3' to<br>
the lab sequence.)]<br>
When Lab is expressed as a fusion protein in a bacteria! GST fusion<br>
expression system (pGEMEX-2T) (Amereham Pharmacia Biotech, Inc., Piscataway,<br>
New Jersey, 08854, USA), and subjected to Western blot analysis using the antibody<br>
MCA 44-3 A6, the resulting blots demonstrate that the expressed cleaved fusion<br>
protein has the same relative mobility as the protein detected in A549 cells. The<br>
deduced molecular weight for Lab is 28.8 kilodaltons and on Western blots it has a<br>
relative mobility identical to the form expressed by A549 cells (apparent relative<br>
mobility = 40 kilodaltons). The 55 glutamic and 27 aspartic acid residues a (82<br>
residues combined) are almost uniformly distributed throughout the protein (255<br>
amino acids total; 228 no leader sequence), except for the leader sequence and the<br>
strongest membrane anchoring domain (MAD II). These data suggest that Lab<br>
migrates anomelously in SDS gels. Cell lines other than A549 (e.g. adenocarcinomas<br>
DU-145, ATCC #HTB-81; ZR-75-1, ATCC # CRL-1504, and so forth) have an<br>
antigen detected with the same molecular weight antigen as Lab. Neither a 85-90<br>
kilodalton molecular weight species, nor a<br>
52 and 56 kilodalton molecular weight species is noted when probing<br>
Western blots for Lab,<br>
Fpitnpp Mapping Using *HA Antibody M^ 44.3AR and Vaccine<br>
Feasibility of Lab: Using Polymerase Chain Reaction and the GST fusion<br>
protein system, subclones of the protein coding region were made, and<br>
epitopes mapped the binding of MCA 44-3A6 to six amino acids (PTGEPQ)<br>
representing amino acids #117-122 of Lab ("P" peptide). In order to<br>
determine this epitope, the entire coding region was divided into regions,<br>
Polymerase Chain Reaction primers were designed to amplify each region,<br>
and the subsequent expression of Polymerase Chain Reaction products were<br>
cloned and tested by Western blot analysis using the antibody MCA 44-3A6.<br>
The DMA fragment representing the positive Western blot result was<br>
then further subdivided. Polymerase Chain Reaction products were<br>
generated and cloned, expressed, and tested via Western blot. Constructs<br>
were made in this way both from the 5' end and the 3' end and the intervals of<br>
the number of amino acids were reduced upon each round. This resulted in<br>
the last round representing a one amino acid difference from the previous<br>
round (in both directions), such that one could deduce the exact binding site<br>
of the MCA 44-3A6. This demonstrates that at least these six amino acids<br>
are exposed to the external cell surface. To further prove the point, the DMA<br>
encoding only these six amino acids have been cloned and the fusion protein<br>
is positive by Western blot analysis. Synthetically prepared "P" peptide can<br>
be specifically detected by MCA 44-3A6, and the synthetic peptide was<br>
immunogenic in 5 of 5 mice tested. Computer analysis/ modelling also<br>
predicted that this epitope would be very immunogenic using computer<br>
assisted analysis (GCG programs) (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, Wl<br>
53703).<br>
Vaccine Preparation: A vaccine is a preparation of antigen(s), which<br>
when given to a host, results in the host producing antibodies against the<br>
antigen(s). The host response results in the host being immune to the<br>
disease to which the vaccine was directed. Vaccine treatment therefore,<br>
prevents the clinical presentation of a disease, without the host being exposed to the<br>
disease causing agents. Lab has all the characteristics of a preferred cancer vaccine.<br>
The lab gene is frequently expressed by tumors which look like adenocarcinomas, is<br>
expressed an the outside of the cells, is expressed by all of the cells within a given<br>
cancer, is expressed at all times by these cancer cells, and is infrequently expressed by<br>
normal cells. Lab protein (peptides) can be produced by any number of methods<br>
using molecular cloning techniques, and can be produced in large quantities, thus<br>
making it a practical antigen to use as a vaccine. After the Lab protein has been<br>
purified so that it is suitable for injection into humans, it is administered to individuals<br>
intradermally, subcutaneously, or by other routes, so as to challenge the immune<br>
system to produce antibodies against this protein (peptides).<br>
The use of molecular modeling and computer assisted analysis GCG programs<br>
(Genetics Crystal Group, Madison, WJ 53703) allows the identification of small<br>
portions of a molecule, slightly larger than an epitope (six to seven amino acids for<br>
proteins), which are expected to be on the surface of a protein molecule. In addition,<br>
the degree of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity of a given sequence, and how<br>
immunogenic the sequence would be in animals, can be determined (Genetics Crystal<br>
Group, Madison, WI 53703). After defining which sequences meet these criteria, the<br>
peptides are synthetically made, or produced by a number of standard methods. One<br>
or more of these peptides can then be formulated to be used as a vaccine, and<br>
administered to the host as outlined above, as a vaccine.<br>
A vaccine comprising a molecule having an amino acid sequence selected<br>
from the group of sequences encoded by the cDNA of FIG. 1, sequences of FIG. 2,<br>
encoded by the cDNA, the peptides APPEDNPVED, EEQQEVPPDT,<br>
DGPTGEPQQE, and EQENPDSSEPV, and any fragments or combinations thereof.<br>
A given vaccine may be administered once to a host, or may be administered<br>
many times. In order for some patients to recognize a given<br>
vaccine, an acjuvant may also need to be administered with the peptides. Adjuvants<br>
are nonspecific immune stimulators which heighten the immune readiness and aid in<br>
the conversion of the host from not having detectable serum antibodies to having very<br>
high titer serum antibodies. It is this high level (titer) of antibodies, which effectively<br>
protects the host from the diseases or conditions to which the antibodies are directed,<br>
Functional Studies: Studies directed at understanding the cellular function(s)<br>
of Lab are extensions of cell localization/characterization studies (Siddique, el al.,<br>
1992). Changes in levels of Lab in response to extracellular exposure to various<br>
response to extracellular exposure to various cations (Ca-H-, Mg++, CU-H-, and Fe-H-)<br>
were undertaken. Lab expression in A549 cells was only modulated by Ca++. Using<br>
the highly specific fluorescent Fura-2/AM Ca-H- method of measuring cytosolic<br>
Ca++, (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR 97402) it was demonstrated that; 1) the<br>
internal Ca-H- concentration is higher in A549 cells than in QU-DB cells, and 2) that<br>
the A549 cell line responds to various external Ca-H- levels (Siddique, et al, 1992).<br>
Since pH can modulate intracellular free Ca-H- levels, external pH manipulations<br>
should result in changes in the expression levels of Lab. Extracellular pH changes (in<br>
the presence of normal Ca-H- concentrations) result in 1) a parallel change in<br>
intracellular pH as measured by SNARF-1 AM/FACS, (Molecular Probes Inc.,<br>
Eugene, OR 97402) 2) transcript levels increase for Lab (when compared to GAPDH<br>
expression via Northern blot); and that 3) Lab protein also increases (using<br>
Western/Slot blot analysis). The intracellular changes in pH (due to external changes)<br>
for A549 cells are Identical to those reported for normal cells. The increased<br>
expression of lab is also not due to cell death (as measured by MTT assays)<br>
(Siddique, el a/., 1992). In addition, incubation of recombinant Lab at various pH<br>
solutions does not alter immunoreactivity. Preliminary data suggests that when these<br>
experiments are conducted on A549 cells grown in reduced Ca-H-, the induced<br>
expression of lab is blunted.<br>
Methods of Diagnosing Cancer Cells in a Sample of Cells: Biological samples<br>
from a subject are used to determine whether cancer cells are<br>
present in the subject. Examples of suitable samples include blood and<br>
biopsy material. One method of diagnosis is to expose DMA from cells in the<br>
sample to a labeled probe that is capable of hybridizing to the lab gene, or a<br>
fragment thereof, under stringent conditions, e.g. 6x ssc; O.OSx blotto; 50%<br>
formamtde; 42°C (Sambrook, et a/., 1990). Of course, the hybridizing<br>
conditions are altered to achieve optimum sensitivity and specificity<br>
depending on the nature of the biological sample, type of cancer, method of<br>
probe preparation, and method of tissue preparation.<br>
After contacting the sample with the probe, the next step is<br>
determining whether the probe has hybridized with nucleotide sequences of<br>
the DMA from the sample, from which the presence of the lab gene is<br>
inferred, said presence being diagnostic of cancer.<br>
Another diagnostic method is to obtain monoclonal antibodies<br>
preferably labeled, either antibodies already existing, or new ones directed to<br>
the antigenic peptides that are aspects of the present invention, and contact<br>
a sample with these to detect the Lab antigen. These monoclonal antibodies<br>
are useful in the development of very specific assays for the detection of Lab<br>
antigen, and allow the tests to be carried out in many different formats;<br>
resulting in a broader application in science and medicine.<br>
The current invention is useful in that it describes a new gene which is<br>
expressed on the surface of tumors, which was not previously reported. This<br>
gene is not tissue specific, and therefore will allow the detection of tumors<br>
regardless of the organ in which they arise. Likewise, the use of this gene to<br>
produce a vaccine for these tumors, will have a very broad application.<br>
Diagnostic tests will also have this broad tissue use, making the detection of<br>
Lab//ai&gt; a "pan-marker" for cancer, in particular for what have been<br>
designated previously, adenocarcinomas.<br>
