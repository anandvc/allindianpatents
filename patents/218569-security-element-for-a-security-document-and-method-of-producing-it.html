				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to security element for a<br>
security document and method of producing it, and, in<br>
particular to security element for security documents such as<br>
bank notes, identity cards or the like, with multi-layer<br>
security elements having a layer in which diffraction<br>
structures, in particular holographic structures, are<br>
embossed in the form of a relief structure and which are<br>
combined with a reflective layer. This application is divided<br>
out of Indian Patent Application No.106/Cal/94 (hereinafter<br>
referred to the "parent application").<br>
Optically variable elements such as holograms,<br>
diffraction grids or interference layer elements have been<br>
preferably used for some time as protection against forgery<br>
or copying due to their optical properties that vary with the<br>
viewing angle. For mass production of such elements it is<br>
customary to produce so-called master holograms which have<br>
the particular phase information in the form of a three-<br>
dimensional relief structure. Starting with the master<br>
hologram one produces by duplication so-called press dies for<br>
embossing the required holograms in large numbers of units.<br>
The embossing can also be done directly on the document<br>
material as described in EP-A 0 338 378. In a continuous<br>
process bank note paper in a roll form is first printed on<br>
both sides and then provided in certain areas with a<br>
holographic structure. The lacquer to be embossed and the<br>
relief structure are simultaneously transferred to the paper<br>
by covering the surface structure of the press die with a<br>
radiation-curable lacquer. As soon as paper and press die are<br>
brought in contact the lacquer is cured. The lacquer now<br>
adheres to the paper surface and has the holographic relief<br>
structure. Then the embossed structure is given a thin<br>
vacuum metalized layer that permits the holographic<br>
information to be observed in reflection.<br>
Since paper is virtually impermeable to UV radiation<br>
the curing of the lacquer can in this case only take place<br>
with the aid of electron radiation, a very elaborate and<br>
expensive method that furthermore damages the paper. For<br>
this reason the production of embossed holograms directly on<br>
the document material has not become accepted in practice,<br>
although this procedure has great advantages with respect to<br>
resistance to forgery since the hologram is connected vir-<br>
tually undetachably with the substrate. Due to the much more<br>
cost-effective production and more versatile applicability<br>
embossed holograms are therefore usually prepared as multi-<br>
layer elements on a separate carrier and transferred to the<br>
document by means of an adhesive layer. The layer structure<br>
is dimensioned, or prepared by additional measures, in such<br>
a way that the hologram can be removed from the carrier<br>
layer after being glued to the document.<br>
The multilayer element applied to the carrier material<br>
can be produced e.g. by the method known from US-C <br>
4.758.296. A matrix in web form circulating on rolls is<br>
provided with a liquid resin and brought in contact with a<br>
plastic carrier material. The liquid resin is simultaneously<br>
cured by UV or electron radiation. In a further step the<br>
relief structure is provided with a thin metal layer so that<br>
the hologram can be observed in reflection. To be trans-<br>
ferred to a document the layer structure is finally provided<br>
with a hot-melt adhesive layer that is activated under the<br>
action of heat and pressure.<br>
However this security element has the disadvantage that<br>
the hologram element might be detached from the document by<br>
reheatinq the hot-melt adhesive, and transferred to another.<br>
In general, so-called transfer embossing foils have<br>
more than the layers described in US-C 4.758.296. For exam-<br>
ple EP-A 0 170 832 describes a transfer embossing foil com-<br>
prising a carrier material, a first layer of lacquer per-<br>
mitting subsequent detachment of the carrier material, a<br>
second layer of lacquer in which the diffraction structures<br>
are embossed, a metal layer and a layer of bonding agent.<br>
Such a foil can be glued to a document by the method known<br>
from EP-A- 0 433 5715. The embossing foil in which the<br>
hologram structure is embedded is applied to a document<br>
locally in the form of a marking. For this purpose the<br>
document is printed at a certain place with an adhesive which<br>
only becomes viscous and sticky through UV, gamma or electron<br>
radiation. This activation takes place either before or<br>
after the transfer foil and document are brought together.<br>
Although this security element offers irreversible<br>
adhesion to the document since the cured adhesive is not<br>
reactivable, the embossed structure can be exposed if the<br>
layer bordering the relief structure or the metal layer has a<br>
different chemical base.<br>
Interestingly enough, the prior art also contains<br>
proposals for preventing embossed layers from being exposed<br>
by using chemically homogeneous materials or permeable metal<br>
layers. 3ut r.ince these elements are applied with reversibly<br>
activable adhesives in all such proposals these elements are<br>
still detachable from the substrate and thus insufficiently<br>
protected from manipulation.<br>
according to the parent application<br>
The Invention,/ is therefore based on the problems of<br>
providing a security document with an embossed hologram,<br>
whereby the embossed hologram has a simple layer structure<br>
with a good laminar compound that is cost-effective and<br>
simple to produce, and the hologram is furthermore connected<br>
with the document irreversibly.<br>
This problem is solved by the features of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention provides a security element for a<br>
security document such no bank note, identity card or the<br>
like having at least two plastic layers consisting of<br>
reaction lacquers between which diffraction structures, in<br>
particular holographic structures, are present in the form of<br>
a relief structure and which are combined with a reflective<br>
layer, a first plastic layer bordering directly on the<br>
document, on the one hand, and directly on the reflective<br>
layer, on the other hand, characterized in that the first<br>
plastic layer is a layer of reaction lacquer from the group<br>
of cationically curing lacquers, blue light-curing lacquers<br>
or chemically curing multicomponent lacquers.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for<br>
producing the security element/ as herein described, comprising the steps of<br>
embossing the diffraction structures in a first layer of<br>
reaction lacquer or layer of reaction adhesive,<br>
providing the embossed layer of reaction lacquer with<br>
the reflective layer, and<br>
applying a further layer of reaction lacquer to the<br>
reflective layer.<br>
The invention offers multilayered advantages involving<br>
both the production of embossed holograms directly on the<br>
document material and the production and application of<br>
transferred embossed holograms.<br>
For example it is possible to produce embossed<br>
holograms directly on the antifalsification paper with the<br>
aid of light-curing substances in very uncomplicated fashion.<br>
Such substances are e.g. blue liqht-curing or delayed-curing<br>
lacqueis.<br>
These substances can of course be used just as advan-<br>
tageously for producing or applying transferred embossed<br>
holograms.<br>
Along with this simple production or transfer, the in-<br>
ventive security documents also offer the crucial advantage<br>
that the security elements have a simple layer structure and<br>
an intensive laminar compound within the element or between<br>
element and document.<br>
This is because the materials selected for plastic<br>
layers adjacent in the element layer structure are chemi-<br>
cally homogeneous and therefore ensure a much more intensive<br>
compound in the boundary\layers than chemically different<br>
substances. The firm compound with the document arises from<br>
the use of reaction lacquers or adhesives which adhere ir-<br>
reversibly to the document.<br>
To obtain a layer structure as simple as possible even<br>
in the case of the transferred embossed holograms, the metal<br>
layer disposed above the embossed layer is not covered with<br>
an additional foil layer which is then equipped with an ad-<br>
hesive layer but, according to the invention, coated di-<br>
rectly with the adhesive, the adhesive being selected so as<br>
to have a foil-like character in the cured state (on the<br>
substrate). These requirements are met by all reaction ad-<br>
hesives that polymerize by physical and/or chemical activa-<br>
tion. To counteract manipulation of all kinds the embossed<br>
layer of the transfer element and the adhesive layer are<br>
formed according to the invention as chemically homogeneous<br>
layers. The metal layer located between these layers is de-<br>
signed so thin that it already has microcracks or pores with<br>
normal handling so that the embossed layer and adhesive<br>
layer are in contact through these randomly present openings<br>
and form a largely inseparable compound at these places.<br>
Exposure of the relief structure or detachment of the secu-<br>
rity element therefore leads inevitably to destruction of<br>
the stated layer structure. Alternatively or additionally<br>
the metal layer can also be provided with openings system-<br>
atically .<br>
In a preferred embodiment the transfer element com-<br>
prises a carrier material preferably bearing a UV-curable<br>
layer of lacquer in which the hologram structure is em-<br>
bossed, and a metal layer whose thickness is much smaller<br>
than 1 micron, preferably in the range of 0.01 microns.<br>
Transfer to the document takes place by means of a UV-acti-<br>
vable adhesive having a chemical composition similar to that<br>
of the UV-curable lacquer, whereby the adhesive and layer of <br>
lacquer are in direct contact with each other in some areas.<br>
This security element has a simple layer structure in which<br>
the layers themselves adhere in optimal fashion.<br>
Depending on the case of application the inventive<br>
layer structure can be varied. The above-described transfer<br>
structure is particularly useful when extremely thin secu-<br>
rity elements are required that add as little buildup as<br>
possible on the later substrate or paper of value and also<br>
have low inherent stability after the carrier foil is re-<br>
moved, thereby additionally preventing removal of the secu-<br>
rity element.<br>
If the security element is to be mechanically stable<br>
itself the invention offers two alternatives, namely to use<br>
a mechanically stressable foil in which the relief structure<br>
is embossed, or a carrier foil remaining on the later secu-<br>
rity element together with the embossed layer of lacquer or<br>
a foil layer bearing the embossing. Such a structure is to<br>
be equipped according to the invention with a permeable<br>
metal layer and with a curing adhesive layer. Such embodi-<br>
ments are of special interest in particular when the secu-<br>
rity element is designed as a strip and applied to the paper<br>
as a safeguarding thread.<br>
Further advantages and variants will be explained with<br>
reference to the figures. It is pointed out that the figures<br>
do not offer a true-to-scale representation of the invention<br>
but are only for the sake of illustration. The term<br>
"reaction adhesives" used in the following text includes all<br>
types of adhesive that cure irreversibly under specific<br>
physical or chemical action. Both UV-curable and two-<br>
component adhesives are thus referred to here as reaction<br>
adhesives.<br>
In the accompanying drawings,<br>
Fig. 1 shows an inventive security document; Fig. 2<br>
shows a transfer embossing foil according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a method for producing the inventive security<br>
document of Fig. 1; Figs. 4-7 show four variants of the<br>
production mothod of Fig. 3; Fig. n shows a variant of the<br>
inventive security document; Fig. 9 shows a method for<br>
producing the inventive security document of Fig. 8; Fig. 10<br>
shows a variant of the production method of Fig. 9.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a cross section through a security document<br>
according to the invention. Security element 9 is disposed<br>
on security document 1 in a predetermined area. Depending on<br>
the requirements, element 9 can have the form of a thread or<br>
band or be formed as a mark with certain contour shapes. It<br>
comprises UV-curable or chemically curable layer of lacquer 2<br>
in which diffraction structures are embossed in the form of a<br>
relief, and thin reflective layer 3, preferably a metal<br>
layer. Element 9. is inseparably connected with security<br>
document 1 via adhesive layer 4. Adhesive layer 4<br>
consists of a material that is largely homogeneous chemically<br>
with the material of embossed layer) 2. This has the<br>
advantage that a very firm compound arises in areas where<br>
the metal layer contains pores or microcracks (which is un-<br>
avoidabLe with layer thicknesses in the range of about 1<br>
micron) and where layer of lacquer 2 and adhesive layer 4<br>
thus adjoin directly. This is very desirable with respect to<br>
protection against forgery by reembossing the relief struc-<br>
ture, and to resistance to wear. Since uv-curable or chemi-<br>
cally curable layers of lacquer and adhesive are irreversi-<br>
bly curable it is impossible to detach the layers later. In<br>
case of thermal or chemical attacks both layers are fur-<br>
thermore always affected so that such measures necessarily<br>
destroy the total security element.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention security element 9<br>
is produced separately as transfer embossing foil 10 whose<br>
structure is shown in Fig. 2. Carrier material 5 is expedi-<br>
ently designed as an endless plastic band to which lacquer 2<br>
is applied in a continuous process. A matrix whose surface<br>
structure corresponds to the interference stripe pattern of<br>
any desired diffraction structure is used to emboss the re-<br>
lief structure in lacquer 2, which is cured e.g. by UV ra-<br>
diation during the embossing process. Such a method is de-<br>
scribed for example in the abovementioned US-C 4.758.296.<br>
Alternatively one can of course also use a delayed-<br>
curing Lacquer, i.e. a lacquer in which polymerization is<br>
initiated, by irradiation with suitable light and then takes<br>
place with a time lag, or a blue Light-curing lacquer. More<br>
detailed information about such lacquers can be found else-<br>
where .<br>
After this the embossed structure in layer 2 is pro-<br>
vided with an either uninterrupted or screened reflective<br>
layer 3, preferably a metal layer. Screening offers the ad-<br>
vantage that the compound between adhesive layer 4 and em-<br>
bossed layer 2 can be made even firmer. The size of the<br>
metal-free areas can be selected as one chooses; it is thus<br>
conceivable to make the metal-free areas so small that they<br>
cannot be resolved by the eye and thus do not impair the<br>
general impression of the information shown. Alternatively<br>
the metal-free areas could be used as desiqn elements so<br>
that the diffraction information is observable visually<br>
within the security element area only at certain places.<br>
Metalizing methods to be used may be e.g. the customary<br>
vacuum metalizing method or else a photolytic method.<br>
The metalized layer can optionally be provided with a<br>
protective layer, whereby the latter should be made of a<br>
material chemically homogeneous with-embossed layer 2.<br>
The finished transfer embossing band 10 can be stored<br>
on rolls as a semifinished product and used on call-in a<br>
production method as described in the following with refer-<br>
ence to Figs. 3 to 5.<br>
Fig. 3 shows part of a continuous method for producing<br>
security documents according to the invention. Security<br>
document material 1, preferably bank note paper already<br>
printed, exists here in web form and is coated locally with<br>
a special adhesive in printing unit 6.<br>
This adhesive is for example a cationically reacting UV.<br>
adhesive that can be treated like an ink before activation.<br>
Unlike customary radically reacting UV adhesives which only<br>
cure during irradiation, so-called cationically curing ad-<br>
hesives have the property of being only activated by irra-<br>
diation with UV light and curing further after irradiation.<br>
Such cationically curing UV lacquer systems are sold e.g. by<br>
Herberts under type designation ISS 1202.<br>
After adhesive 4 has been transferred to substrate 1 in<br>
printing unit 6 it is irradiated in the next unit with UV<br>
lamp 7, as shown in Fig. 3, to activate its bonding ability.<br>
In the following step transfer embossing foil 10 is fed from<br>
supply roll 11 according to Fig. 2. Element 9 (Fig. 2) ad-<br>
heres to the adhesive layer and is removed from carrier band<br>
5 in the form of the adhesive coating. Carrier band 5 and<br>
the non-transferred remains of element layer structure 9 are<br>
wound onto transfer band roll 12. In a last method step not<br>
shown, substrate 1 provided with security elements 9 is cut<br>
up into suitable formats, e.q. individual bank notes.<br>
In a variant, adhesive 4 can also be printed on trans-<br>
fer embossing foil 10 and activated there. This possibility<br>
is shown in Fig. 4. Before embossing foil 10 removed from<br>
roll 11 is brought together with substrate 1, UV-initiable<br>
adhesive 4 is applied to metal layer 3 of embossing foil 10<br>
in any desired patterning in printing unit 6 and then acti-<br>
vated with UV lamp 7. In this case too carrier band 5 is<br>
removed from substrate 1 via roll 12 directly after gluing.<br>
Instead of delayed-curing adhesives one can of course<br>
also use the abovementioned blue light-curing adhesives.<br>
This method variant is shown in Fig. 5. Paper web 1 is pro-<br>
vided with the blue light-curing adhesive in printing unit<br>
6. This adhesive is e.g. an acrylate from Imperial Chemical<br>
Industries PCL with the desicmation LCR 0603B.<br>
In the area of pressing cylinder 16 transfer material<br>
10 and paper web 1 are brought in contact and irradiated<br>
with blue light 17. The adhesive thereby cures within sec-<br>
onds since the paper is permeable to blue light. The trans-<br>
fer foil can then be removed from the hologram-paper com-<br>
pound in the usual way.<br>
Departing from the embodiments shown in Figs. 3 to 5 it<br>
is also possible to leave carrier foil 5 on substrate 1<br>
temporarily or permanently. This may be useful as additional<br>
protection from mechanical loads temporarily, e.g. for a<br>
period of storage or transport, or for the entire life e.g.<br>
of safeguarding threads. It is important in this connection<br>
that the protective layer function performed by carrier foil<br>
5 should in this case be regarded only as additional to the<br>
protective layer function of layer of lacquer 2. Removal of<br>
carrier film 5 opens up no possibilities of manipulation<br>
since it doe 3 not yet make the relief structure accessible.<br>
The methods shown in Figs. 3 to 5 are wonderfully sim-<br>
ple and require no elaborate protective measures, as are<br>
necessary for example when eloctron-beam curing or solvent-<br>
containing adhesives are used. Furthermore one thus obtains<br>
both a firm laminar compound within the security element and<br>
firm adhesion to the document, so that it is not possible<br>
either to separate the embossed structure from the element<br>
layer structure or to detach the element from the document.<br>
Although it is preferable to use radiation-curing ad-<br>
hesives for reasons of process engineering, in particular<br>
due to their simple and extremely fast curing, one can al-<br>
ternatively use mixed adhesives which are related chemically<br>
with the embossed layer. According to the invention the em-<br>
bossed layer need not necessarily be a radiation-curable<br>
layer of lacquer, it can also be a chemically curing layer<br>
that has the same chemical base as the adhesive layer.<br>
This variant is shown in Fig. 6. One component of the<br>
adhesive is applied in printing unit 13 directly to transfer<br>
embossing foil 10 removed from roll 11, while the second<br>
component is applied in printing unit 14 to substrate 1.<br>
When substrate 1 and transfer embossing foil 10 are brought<br>
together a self-curing layer arises in the area of the ad-<br>
hesive components to ensure the compound between substrate 1<br>
and embossed layer 2. Carrier material 5 can of course here<br>
too be removed directly after gluing, as shown in the fig-<br>
ure , or else be left on substrate 1 as a temporary protec-<br>
tive layer.<br>
The separate application of the adhesive components<br>
shown in Fig. 6 makes the functional principle particularly<br>
clear. However this procedure is not permissible with any<br>
two-component adhesive since these adhesives generally de-<br>
velop their adhesive properties only when intimately mixed.<br>
Departing from the principle shown in Fig. 6 one can, if<br>
necessary, replace pair of rolls 13 or 14 by a mixing appa-<br>
ratus (not shown) for first mixing the two components and<br>
then applying them jointly in the way customary for the ex-<br>
pert. The other pair of rolls is then omitted in this em-<br>
bodiment .<br>
Fig. 7 shows a further possibility for producing the<br>
inventive security element. This method corresponds sub-<br>
stantially to the production method of Fig. 4 only that se-<br>
curity element band 10 brought by roll 11 is completely<br>
fixed to substrate 1 here, i.e. no transfer band is removed.<br>
As already mentioned at the outset such an embodiment is<br>
useful in cases where the security elements have sufficient<br>
inherent stability (stable relief foil), or one desires in-<br>
creased protection from mechanical loads by providing an<br>
additional protective layer (additional protective layer<br>
instead of transfer carrier foil).<br>
Fig. 8 shows a variant of inventive security document<br>
1. In this case security element 9 comprises layer of lac-<br>
quer 20 in which the diffraction structures are embossed in<br>
the form of a relief, thin reflective layer 3, preferably a<br>
metal layer, and layer of protective lacquer 21. Here too<br>
element 9 can have the form of a thread or band or else be<br>
formed as a mark with certain contour shapes, depending on<br>
the requirements. Embossed layer of lacquer 20 consists ac-<br>
cording to the invention of a reaction lacquer, in particu-<br>
lar a UV-initiated delayed-curing or a blue light-curing<br>
lacquer, as were already explained. Layer of protective<br>
lacquer 21 protects the sensitive embossed structure and<br>
metal layer 3 from outside environmental influences and me-<br>
chanical impairment. It is preferably made of a material<br>
chemically homogeneous with layer of lacquer 20 to form a<br>
firm compound with layer of lacquer 20 in the area of mi-<br>
crocracks or pores in the metal layer.<br>
In contrast to the security document shown in Fig. 1<br>
security element 9 is produced directly on the document ,in<br>
this embodiment. The various procedures permitting simple<br>
and cost-effective production of this security document will<br>
be explained in more detail with reference to Figs. 9 and<br>
10.<br>
In Fig. 9 a blue light-curing adhesive, e.g. the<br>
abovementioned acrylate LCR-0603B, is applied by means of<br>
printing unit 18 to paper substrate 1 in the desired form of<br>
later security element 9, possibly all over. The pretreated<br>
paper is then fed to an embossing unit, here embossing cyl-<br>
inder 22. The surface of the embossing cylinder has holo-<br>
graphic relief structure 23 which is transferred upon con-<br>
tact with the layer of lacquer. During the embossing process<br>
the lacquer is cured within seconds through the paper layer<br>
with the aid of blue light 17. In following method steps not<br>
shown in the figure the metalizing or protective lacquer<br>
coating is performed.<br>
Alternatively the embossing roll can be provided with<br>
the lacquer instead of paper web 1. After irradiation with<br>
blue light the cured layer adheres to the paper and is re-<br>
moved from the embossing roll.<br>
Fig. 10 shows a similar method in which a delayed-cur-<br>
ing lacquer is used for the layer to be embossed. In this<br>
case the layer of lacquer applied to the paper is irradiated<br>
shortly before the embossing unit. The exposure to UV light<br>
only initiates polymerization and does not cause complete<br>
curing. The still formable layer of lacquer is then provided<br>
with relief structure 23 by being brought in contact with<br>
embossing cylinder 22. When substrate web 1 leaves the em-<br>
bossing unit the layer of lacquer is completely crosslinked<br>
and can be processed further in the conventional way.<br>
It is of course also possible in this embodiment exam-<br>
ple to apply the lacquer to the embossing roll, activate it<br>
there and finally bring it in contact with the paper during<br>
the curing process.<br>
The described methods thus permit simple production of<br>
a security element very resistant to forgery having a mini-<br>
mum of element layers and thus requiring very few method<br>
steps for its production, and can furthermore dispense with<br>
complicated, cost-intensive techniques.<br>
A further method variant is to provide the embossing<br>
roll as shown in Figs. 9 and 10 with a metalized layer be-<br>
fore it is brought in contact with the layer of lacquer.<br>
More details of this procedure can be found in EP-A 0 563<br>
992.<br>
Since particularly antifalsification papers frequently<br>
have great surface roughness which might impair the effec-<br>
tiveness of the diffraction structures the paper can, if<br>
necessary, be glazed in the area of the security element<br>
before lacquering by additional measures, as are described<br>
in EP-A 0 440 045.<br>
On the basis of the invention it is not absolutely<br>
necessary for reflective metal layer 3 to be provided be-<br>
tween the two plastic layers 2, 4, 20, 21. If one uses only<br>
adjacent plastic layers in contrast to the examples shown in<br>
Figs. 1, 2 and 8 they must of course have optically differ-<br>
ent properties, in particular different calculation indices,<br>
so that the diffraction structures remain recognizable.<br>
These layers are always reaction lacquers or reaction adhe-<br>
sives according to the invention.<br>
It is also evident that any desired combinations of<br>
reaction adhesives can be used for the embossed layer and<br>
the adhesive layer in the case of the transferred embossed<br>
hologram. The same holds for the embossed, or protective<br>
layer of the hologram produced directly on the document.<br>
