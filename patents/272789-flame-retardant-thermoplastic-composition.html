FLAME RETARDANT   THERMOPLASTIC   COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to a flame retardant thermoplastic composition comprising a thermoplastic Eastover and a halogen free flame retardant system and to a mounded part made thereof, more particular to a flexible thermoplastic composition having good flame retarding properties wet-heat resistance and mechanical properties and also more particular to mounded parts selected from mechanical parts, electric and electronic parts, automobiie oarts, and housings and other parts of, for example, office automation apparatuses and. household electronic appliances.<br>
Flame retardant -.thermoplastic composition comprising a thermoplastic elastomer and a halogen free flame retardant system and; moulded parts at least oartly made and consisting thereof, are known from US patent US-5,298,544. US-5,298,544-describes a flame retardant thermoplastic moulding composition consisting essentially of a thermoplastic resin and a flame retardant. The thermoplastic resin is a copoiyetherimide ester or a copolyether ester or a blend thereof. The copolyetherimide ester and the copolyether ester are both thermoplastic.elastomers. The flame retardant is magnesium carbonate or a bienc of magnesium carbonate and saicium carbonate having a combination of zinc Donate or zinc oxide or a blend of zinc borate anc zinc oxide. The Known compositions of US-5,298,544 show flame retardancy properties according to UL-94 standard complying with atypical V2 rating for the copolyethenmiae ester elastomer and VI for the copolyether ester elastomer. For these ratings high leadings of flame retardants of aoout 50 wt.%, relative to the total weight of the moulding composition are used. The said known moulding compositions further comprise a stabilizer package in an amount of about 1 A wt.%, relative tc the total weight of the moulding composition and show eiongation-at-oreak values in tensile test according tc ASTM D638 close to 25%.<br>
A disadvantage of the known compositions of US-5,298,544 is -that in many applications of. moulded parts made of flame retardant thermoplastic compositions, such high loadings and/or iow elongations are not acceptable, whereas in particular cases a V2 or VI rating is insufficient and a V'O rating is required.<br>
The-aim of the invention is tc provide a flame retardant thermoplastic composition comprising a thermoplastic elastomer and a halogen free flame retardant system and a moulded part made thereof, which do not show these disadvantageous or in lesser extent, more particular the invention is aimec at a flame retardam<br>
thermoplastic composition and a moulded part made thereof, which show a V2 rating, and preferably a V1 rating or even a VO rating according to UL-94-V standard at much lower filler loadings, meanwhile having higher elongations than the known compositions. A further requirement is that the compositions should have a good hydrolysis resistance under hot, humid conditions.<br>
This aim has been achieved with the flame retardant thermoplastic composition according to the invention ana the moulded part made thereof, wherein (i)    the thermoplastic elastomer comprises a copolyester elastomer comprising (a) hard blocks and soft blocks consisting of segments of hard and soft polyester polymers linked by urethane groups or (b) hard blocks consisting.of segments of a hard polyester polymer and soft blocks consisting of a long chain aiiphatic dicarboxylic acid residue and/or a song chain aliphatic, diol residue, wherein the hard?and: soft blocks are optionally linked oy urethane groups and (ii)   the halogen free flame retarcant system comprises a nitrogen containing fiame retardant.<br>
The effect of flame retardant thermoplastic composition according to invention and the moulded pan made thereof, comprising the said copolyester elastomer with (a) hard blocks anc soft blocks consisting of segments of! hard and soft polyester polymers iinKec by urethane groups or with (b) nard blocks consisting of segments of a hare polyester ootymer and soft blocks consisting of a long chain aliphatic dicarbcxyiic acid residue and/or a long chain aiipnatic did residue, and and/or a long chain aiipnatic diol resiaue wnerein the hard and soft blocks are optionally linked oy urethane groups and wnerein the halogen free flame retardant system comprises a nitrogen containing fiame retardant, is that the thermoplastic composition has a flame retardancy performance complying with V2, VI or even VO ratings according to the JL-94-V wnicr ratings are obtained at loadings of the flame retardant system much lower than usee for the flame retardant system in the known composition meanwhile also showing a mucn nigher elongation at break than the known composition of JS-5.298.544 having a. comparable-flame retardancy performance. Surprisingly, the mecnanicai properties of the copolyester elastomer used in the fiame retarcant thermoplastic composition according to the invention is affected only in' iimited extent by the presence of the nitrogen containing flame retardant. in sc far there is such a negative effect, i.e. reduction ;n elongation at creak, or tensile strength, this effect" is certainly limited, whereas in other cases this effect is clearly-positive, exnibited by an increased elongation whiie the Tensile strength at break is maintained at the<br>
same good level. This is even more surprising in view of the fact that nitrogen containing flame retardants, such as meiamine based flame retaraants and in particular melamine cyanurate, are known to negatively affect the mechanical properties in polymer compositions, certainly when used as the only flame retardant and in sufficiently high amounts for obtaining good flame retardancy properties. A further surprising effect is that mechanical properties of the flame retardant thermoplastic composition according to the invention are also retained, after treatment for a longer period under hot, humid conditions, at a level comparable to that of the original copoiyester elastomer with hard PIOCKS anc soft blocks corresponding with the features (a) or (b) as described above.<br>
The-fiame retardant thermoplastic composition according to the invention also; shows better flame retardancy properties than corresponding compositions comprising a copolyether ester elastomer as used in the known composition of US-5,298,544 in combination with nitrogen containing flame retardants, in that either the flame retardancy is better when using the same type and amount of the nitrogen containing flame retaraants ana/or a VO rating is ootainec at lower loadings of the nitrogen containing flame retardants. if such a rating can be obtained at all for the corresponding composition comprising the copolyether ester elastomer. A further difference in favour of flame retardant thermoplastic comoositiori according to the invention is that the mechanical oropenies of the corresponding flame retardant thermoplastic composition comprising the copolyether ester elastomer are certainly affected negatively by the nitrogen containing flame retaraants, exhibited by Sower values for elongation and tensile strength at oreak, which negative effect is already substantially at loading levels far oelow the level at which a VC rating is obtained if any. In further search for alternative flame retardant thermoplastic compositions, aisc other flame retardants have been tested in combination with tne coooiyether aster elastomer as used in the known composition. Among these other flame retaraants, a flame retardant system comprising aluminium diethylphcsphinate was found to be aoie to provide a solid VO-rating. For obtaining a solid VC, much higher loadings of the alternative flame retardant system was requirec than needec for the nitrogen containing flame retardants in the inventive compositions. Moreover, the said aluminium diethylphosphmate based flame retardant system nas a significant negative effect on the mechanical properties o; the copolyether ester aiastcmer. resulting in significantly lower values for both the elongation at break and iensiie strength compared, to-'the corresponding copolyether ester elastomer.<br>
<br>
Flame retardant thermoplastic composition comprising a thermoplastic elastomer and/or a halogen free flame retardant system comprising one or more-of the features of the compositions according to the invention have been described in different patents or patent appiications, as described below. None of these patents describe the inventive compositions or the effects thereof as according to the invention.<br>
EP-0102115-B1 describes polyester ester biock-copolymers with low melting soft blocks and high melting hard blocks composed of polyesters- and linked by urethane linkages, as may also be used in the flame retardant thermoplastic composition aceording to the invention. EP-0102115-B1 does not describe any flame retardant compositions based on the said polyester ester block-copolyrn$rs, let alone the flame retardancy or mechanical properties thereof.<br>
EP-0363321-B1 describes a flame retardant thermoplastic composition comprising melamine based flame retardants as halogen free flame retardant system. The meiamine based flame retardants consisted of melamine salts of phasphonic acids, which were typically tc be used in an amount of 1-100 pbw (parts by weight) relative; to 100 pbw of a-thermoplastic polymer. For the possible polymers that cart be useda&amp;rttoe thermoplastic polymer many polymers are mentioned, including block-CQpoiijtettjeFesters, which as said above are thermoplastic elastomers. Various examples ate described in EP-0363321-B1 with flame retardancy test results showing different ratings. Only few examples, based on epcxy based poiyetber poiyurethane showed a V-0 rating. The mechanical croperties of those examples were not mentioned. However, none of the examples included a copolyetherester as mentioned in the above cited prior art, let alone copoiyester as used in the compositions according to the invention or the effect thereof.<br>
Flame retardant thermoplastic moulding compositions are also described in EP-037S237-A1. EP-0376237-A1 further describes moulded products made from the flame retardant thermoplastic moulding compositions, more particular "Kabelbinder" and Steckerieisten". The Known flame retardant thermoplastic moulding compositions of EP-037S237-A1 consist of a thermoplastic oolyamide (A), a thermoplastic polyetherester elastomer (B), meiamine cyanurate (C), and a filler. The amount of (B), only 0.45-15 wt.%, as well as the amount of (C), only 0.05-1,98 wt.%, both relative to the total of (A), ,'B) and ;C;, are very low. Meiamine cyanurate is a nitrogen containing-flame retardant. EP-0375237-A* explicitly states that the use of melamine cyanurate is problematic and wnen the amount oecomes too large: ;t<br>
influences the mechanical properties.<br>
EP-Q868478-B1 describes flame retardant elastomer compositions comprising a thermoplastic elastomer and one or more nitrogen containing flame retardants. The known flame retardant eiastomer compositions of EP-0S68478-81 are used for construction sheetings and have to comply with flame retardancy standards from the building industry (DIN 4102 B2). The nitrogen containing flame retardants are melamine condensates and melamine compounds, which are used in an amount of 5 to 30 wt.% based on the thermoplastic elastomer.  Dreferred compounds are melamine cyanurate and meiam. The thermoplastic elastomer is chosen from the.group consisting of polyurethane block copolymers, polyetheramide oiock copolymers, polyefrrefestefr block copolymers and polyester ester biockcapolymers. The examples in EP-Q868478-B1 are with polyurethane block copolymers, poiyetheramide block copolymers, and poiyetherester block copolymers. Polyetherester block copolymers are preferred. None of the examples is with a polyester ester blockcopoJymer. Also no test results secorcMng to the UL-94-V standard are mentioned in EP-08B8478-B1. whereas DIN 4102 B2 is certainly not aiike and likewise much less critical than UL-94-V. Although:some of the copoiyester elastomers in the composition according tc the invention can be considered to be or are copoiyester elastomers, neither copoiyester elastomers-.as used in the composition according tc the invention, nor the advantageous effects thereof, are mentioned in EP-0868478-B1. Apart from construction sheetings nc other possible applications are mentioned.<br>
Thermoplastic copoiyester elastomers with hard blocks anc soft blocks linked by urethane linkages are describee in EP-0846712-81. The hare blocks in the copoiyester elastomers of EP-0846712-B1 are composed of poifyesters, whereas the soft blocks are composed of segments of a low melting aliphatic polycarbonate polymer.  Reported possible applications of the block copolymers include pipes, hoses, cable and sheets, and in particular bellows and seals for automotive applications. The said block copolymers can be made flame retardant with flame retardants preferably melamine cyanurate. No amounts of flame retardants are mentioned and mechanical and flame retardancy properties of the flame retardant elastomers are not are not described in EP-0846712-B1.<br>
The copoiyester elastomer in the flame retardant thermoplastic composition according tc the invention comprises hare olocks consisting of segments of a. hard polyester polymer, also denoted herein as hard polyester poiymer segments.. Next to that the copoiyester eiastomer comprises soft biocKs consisting of segments of<br>
a soft polyester polymer, also denoted herein as soft polyester polymer segments, and/or soft olocks consisting of a long chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acid residue and/or a long chain aliphatic diol residue, herein denoted together also as soft aliphatic segment. The soft polyester polymer segments are iinked to the hard polyester polymer segments oy urethane linkages. The soft aliphatic segments' are iinked to the hard polyester polymer segments by ester, amide and/or urethane linkages, Ester linkages can be formed by reacting a long chain aliDhatic diol with a carboxyl functional polyester, or by reaction a long chain aliphatic diacid with a hydroxyl functional polyester. Amide linkages can be formed by reacting a long chain aliphatic diamine with a hydroxyl functional polyester. Urethane linkages can De formed by reacting a iong chain aliphatic diol with an isocyanate modified polyester, or by reaction a hydroxyl functional polyester with an isocyanate modified long chain aliphatic diol.<br>
Copolyester elastomer comprising, soft polyester polymer segments linked to the hard polyester polymer segments by urethane linkages ares generally considered as:being part of the group of copolyester ester elastomers. Such copoiyester ester elastomers can be made by letting react a low melting aliphatic polyester prepoiymer dioi and a high melting, aromatic, prepoiymer diol with di-isocyanate or by reaction an isocyanate capped prepoiymer with a prepoiymer dioi. For the isocyanate-capped: prepoiymer one can choose to: either- cap the low melting aliphatic polyester prepoiymer diol or high melting aromatic prepoiymer dioi with a di-isocyanate and than to let it react with the other dioi. Other members of the group of copoiyester ester elastomers include copoiyester elastomer comprising :soft polyester polymer segments iinkec to the hard ooiyester polymer segments by ester linkages. These latter copolyester ester elastomers can be made by separately preparing a low melting aliphatic polyester prepoiymer and a high melting aromatic prepoiymer, one of these prepolymers being a dioi and the other being a dicarboxylic acid, and then mixing the two ootymers and. an esterification catalyst at elevated temperature-in the melt under nitrogen. Once a transparent mixture is obtained, the esterification catalyst used in the orocess. must be deactivated.<br>
Such copolyester ester elastomers-with aster linkages are not suited for making flame retardant compositions with nitrogen containing flame retardants in that such compositions perform less good in one or more of the properties in which the flame retardant compositions excel, i.e. flame retardancy, good retention of eiastomeric properties upon addition of the nitrogen containing flame retardants as well as retention thereof after treatment under hot humic conditions<br>
The copoiyester elastomers with soft iong chain aliphatic segments linked to the hard polyester polymer segments by urethane and/or ester linkages, can be prepared in the same way as described above for the copoiyester ester elastomers with either urethane or ester iinkages, except that in stead of a soft polyester prepolymer dioi or soft polyester prepoiymer dicarboxylic acid a soft long chain aliphatic diol or diacid is used, and combined with, as suitable, with a polyester prepolymer dioi, diacid or isocyanate end-capped.<br>
