				<td>Description<br>
The present invention relates to an intake apparatus of an internal combustion engine.<br>
According to a related art disclosed in JP-A-2002-235616, a pressure sensor is directly attached to an intake pipe wall of an intake apparatus for an internal combustion engine in order to detect pressure of intake air. A resinous holding part is integrally formed with the intake pipe wall for supporting the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor is directly attached to a pressure introducing passage that opens to the intake passage for introducing intake air into the pressure sensor. The pressure introducing passage has a labyrinth structure, so as to restrict debris from flowing into the pressure sensor.<br>
In the structure of the related art, the pressure sensor is directly attached to the pressure introducing passage. However, relative positioning of the pressure sensor with respect to a substrate, a case receiving the substrate and the like may be largely misaligned. Accordingly, when the pressure sensor mounted on the substrate is attached to the intake apparatus, physical relationship between the pressure sensor and the pressure introducing passage may be largely dislocated from each other in the assembling process, for example.  Accordingly, it is difficult to attach the pressure<br><br>
sensor into the intake pipe, i.e., the intake apparatus. Even when the pressure sensor is attached to the intake pipe wall, stress generated in the assembling process is directly applied to the pressure sensor. Therefore, the pressure sensor or the substrate mounted with the pressure sensor may be broken. Besides, failure of conductivity due to cracking of solder may arise in the pressure sensor and the substrate mounted with the pressure sensor.<br>
Additionally, the shape of the pressure introducing passage having the labyrinth structure becomes complicated. Accordingly, forming process of the pressure introducing passage in the intake pipe wall becomes difficult.<br>
In view of the foregoing problems, it is an object of the present invention to produce an intake apparatus in which misalignment between the pressure sensor mounted on a conductive member such as the substrate and the pressure introducing passage can be absorbed in the assembling process, while restricting external force from being applied to the conductive member.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to produce an intake apparatus in which misalignment between the pressure sensor and the pressure introducing passage or the like can be absorbed in the assembling process, while a passage such as the pressure introducing passage introducing intake air to the pressure sensor can be inexpensively formed to be in the labyrinth structure in order to restrict debris from entering into the pressure sensor.<br><br><br>
Further, it is another object of the present invention to produce an intake apparatus in which misalignment between the pressure sensor and the pressure introducing passage can be absorbed in the assembling process, so that the assembling is easily performed.<br>
According to claim 1 of the present invention, fan intake apparatus for an internal combustion engine is constructed with an intake pipe, a pressure sensor, a conductive member and a pressure introducing passage part. The intake pipe has an intake passage. The pressure sensor detects pressure of intake air passing through the intake passage. The conductive member electrically connects with the pressure sensor. The pressure introducing passage part is formed in the intake pipe, and is opened to the intake air passage so as to be able to introduce intake air into the pressure sensor. The pressure sensor has a body part mounted on the conductive member and a sensing port that detects pressure. The intake pipe has a wall part forming the pressure introducing passage partA sealing member has a pressure communicating passage arranged between the pressure sensor and the pressure introducing passage part. The sealing member has a first end side part that is substantially diametrically sealed with an outer periphery of the sensing port. The sealing member has a second end side part that is inserted between a wall part and a supporting member so as to be sealed face-to-face with each other, so that the pressure communicating passage and the<br><br><br>
pressure introducing passage part are communicatable.<br>
Thus, the first end side part of the sealing member and the sensing port of the pressure sensor are diametrically sealed with each other. Besides, the second end side part and the wall part of the intake pipe having the pressure introducing passage part are sealed face-to-face with each other. The sealing force, which works in the part sealed face-to-face, can be generated by pressing force applied by the wall part and the supporting member without applying external force to the pressure sensor or the conductive member, such as the substrate or a metallic member.<br>
Furthermore, misalignment in the direction, where the pressure sensor is attached to a member to which the pressure sensor is attached, can be absorbed. Besides, misalignment in the facial direction, which is perpendicular to the direction where the pressure sensor is attached to the member, can be also absorbed. For example, axial dimensional variation, i.e. axial misalignment between the pressure sensor and the pressure introducing passage part can be absorbed by adjusting axial insertion degree between the sensing port and the first end side part of the sealing member that are diametrically sealed with each other. Furthermore, variation of distance in the direction perpendicular to the axial direction between the pressure sensor and the pressure introducing passage part, i.e. a misalignment in the facial direction, can be absorbed by adjusting a displacement amount between the wall part and the face of the other end part of the sealing member sealed face-<br><br><br>
to-face with each other.<br>

(First Embodiment)<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, an intake apparatus is constructed with an intake throttle apparatus (throttle apparatus) 1, an air filter 200 and an internal combustion engine 300 (specifically intake manifold 300a). The intake apparatus can variably change a flow amount of intake air, i.e. an intake airflow amount, in accordance with an operating condition of the internal combustion engine. The intake apparatus can be constructed with only the throttle apparatus 1 that can variably control the intake airflow amount as described later. When the throttle apparatus 1 is mounted in a vehicle, the throttle apparatus 1 is airtightly connected with<br><br><br>
an intake duct (not shown), which has an air filter 200, on the upstream side (intake upstream side) in the intake airflow of the throttle apparatus 1. Besides, the throttle apparatus 1 airtightly communicates with the intake manifold 300a of the internal combustion engine 300 on the downstream side in the intake airflow.<br>
The throttle apparatus 1 is constructed with a valve housing 10 forming an intake passage 10a, a valve shaft 20, a valve body 30, a biasing spring 40, a pressure sensor 60 and a substrate 50. The valve shaft 20 is rotatably supported in the valve housing 10. The valve body 30 is connected with the valve shaft 20 so as to be able to variably change the opening area of the intake passage 10a. The biasing spring 40 urges the valve shaft 20 in a turning direction of the valve shaft 20. The pressure sensor 60 is used as a detecting means for detecting pressure of intake air passing through the intake passage 10a. The substrate 50 inputs signal detected by the pressure sensor 60. The valve housing 10 is made of a resinous material, a metallic material (e.g., aluminum die-casting), or the like. In this embodiment, the valve housing 10 is made of a resinous material as follows.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the valve housing 10 constructs a part of a substantially cylindrical intake pipe introducing intake air into the internal combustion engine 300. The intake pipe has the intake passage 10a extending inside the intake pipe in the flow direction of intake air.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the valve housing 10 is<br><br>
constructed with an outer peripheral wall part 11 and bearing parts 12a, 12b rotatably supporting both end parts 20a, 20b (FIG. 2) of the valve shaft 20. The outer peripheral wall part 11 forms the intake passage 10a therein, and the cross-section of the intake passage 10a is formed in a substantially circular shape. The bearing parts 12a, 12b are formed in a substantially cylindrical shape, and arranged in the extending direction of the valve shaft 20 (left to right in FIG. 2). The bearing parts 12a, 12b outwardly extend from the outer peripheral wall part 11.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the valve shaft 20 is formed in a substantially column-shape, and is rotatably supported by the two bearing parts 12a, 12b. The valve body 30 is fixed to the valve shaft 20 located between the two bearing parts 12a, 12b. As shown in FIG. 1, the valve shaft 20 rotates so that the valve body 30 opens and closes the intake passage 10a. The valve body 30 has a generally known shape that can variably change the opening area of the intake passage 10a from the fully closed position to the full opened position.<br>
One end part 20a of the valve shaft 20 is received in one bearing part 12a, and the other end part 20b penetrates the bearing part 12b and connects to a lever 90. As shown in FIG. 3, the lever 90 has a hooking hole 91, to which an accelerator wire hooks, for example. The accelerator wire synchronizes with an operation of an accelerator pedal of the vehicle. The lever 90 transfers a towing operation of the accelerator wire into a rotating operation, so as to transmit<br><br>
turning force, which is externally applied to the lever 90, to the valve shaft 20.  The lever 90 constructs a turning force ■applying means which applies turning force to the valve shaft 20.<br>
The turning force applying means is not limited to a device operated by a mechanical external force synchronizing with the operation of the accelerator pedal via the lever 90. The turning force applying means can be a device operated by an electrically generated external force by an electric motor (not shown) for rotatably driving the side of the end part 20b of the valve shaft 20. When the valve shaft 20 is driven by the electric motor, driving force of the electric motor is transmitted to the valve shaft 20 via a reduction gear or the like provided between the electric motor and the valve shaft 20, preferably. In this case, a small electric motor, which can generate relatively small driving force, can be used, so that the throttle apparatus, i.e. the intake apparatus 1 can be downsized. The turning force applying means in this embodiment is a device operated by externally mechanical force applied by the lever 90, as follows.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1, the biasing spring 40 hooks to the lever 90. The biasing spring 40 urges the valve shaft 20 in the turning direction via the lever 90 used as the turning force applying means. Here, at least one biasing spring 40 is used in the throttle apparatus. When multiple (e.g., two) biasing springs 40 are used, the two biasing springs 40 can urge the valve shaft 20  in the turning<br><br>
direction in which the valve body 30 connected to the valve shaft 20 closes the intake passage 10a. Alternatively, one biasing spring 40 can urge the valve body 30, which is connected to the valve shaft 20, in the turning direction (valve closing direction) in which the valve body 30 closes the intake passage 10a. Besides the other biasing spring 40 can urge the valve body 30 in the turning direction (valve opening direction) in which the valve body 30 opens the intake passage 10a. In the following description of this embodiment, one biasing spring 40 urges the valve shaft 20 (specifically end part 20a) in the valve closing direction.<br>
As shown in FIG. 3, a screw 93 is used as a restricting means for setting a minimum turning position to which the lever 90 can turn. The screw 93 is fixed to the valve housing 10 via a holding member 92 such as a bracket. When control of the turning force applying means is stopped, e.g., when stepping force applied to an accelerator pedal is released, the valve shaft 20 is rotated in the valve closing direction by biasing force (urging force) of the biasing spring 40. In this situation, the screw 93 restricts the valve shaft 20 at a predetermined position in which the valve body 30 slightly opens the intake passage 10a from a completely closing position of the valve body 30 in the valve opening direction, for example.<br>
The screw 93 and the holding member 92 construct the restricting means. The biasing spring 40 and the restricting means are provided at the end part 20b of the valve shaft 20<br><br><br>
on which turning force is applied by the turning force applying means. That is, the biasing spring 40 and the "restricting means are provided at the outer peripheral wall part 11 on the side of the bearing shaft 12b.<br>
The pressure sensor 60 has a body part 60a that can be mounted on the substrate 50, and a sensing port 60b that detects pressure of a pressure detecting object (e.g., intake air) that is to be detected its pressure. The pressure sensor 60 is provided on the side of the bearing part 2a in the outer peripheral wall part 11. Intake air passing through the intake passage 10a is introduced into the pressure sensor 60 through a pressure introducing passage (first pressure introducing passage, pressure introducing passage part) 14, a stepped passage 15 and a pressure communicating passage (second pressure introducing passage, pressure communicating passage) 81, as described later.<br>
The pressure sensor 60, specifically the sensing port 60b having an elongated substantially cylindrical port is provided substantially in parallel with the valve shaft 20, and arranged to be apart from the valve shaft 20. As shown in FIG. 1, the first pressure introducing passage 14 having an elongated passage is provided along with the valve shaft 20, so as to be substantially in parallel with the valve shaft 20, and arranged to be apart from the valve shaft 20. The first pressure introducing passage 14 has an opening communicating to the intake passage 10a. The opening of the first pressure introducing passage 14 can be located on the downstream side<br><br><br>
as the valve body 30 with respect to the intake airflow passing through the intake passage 10a, in the most of an opening position range of the valve body 30. As a result, pressure detection performed by the pressure sensor 60 can be restricted from being affected by intake airflow.<br>
The first pressure introducing passage 14 is formed in the outer peripheral wall part 11 (specifically wall part 13) on the side of the bearing part 20a. The wall part 13 is integrally formed with the outer peripheral wall part 11, and is outwardly extended from the outer peripheral wall part 11 (FIG. 2). The wall part 13 has the first pressure introducing passage 14. The wall part 13 is not limited to be in a shape outwardly extending from the outer peripheral wall part 11 separately from the bearing part 12a as shown in FIG. 2. The wall part 13 can be integrated with the bearing part 12a and can be in a shape outwardly extending from the outer peripheral wall part 11.<br>
The second pressure introducing passage 81 is formed in a sealing member 80 made of a rubber material such as nitrile rubber for example, or a resinous material. The sealing member 80 is arranged so as to oppose against the wall part 13 in which the first pressure introducing passage 14 is formed. The sealing member 80 is arranged between the pressure sensor 60 and the first pressure introducing passage 14. specifically, the sealing member 80 is arranged between the pressure sensor 60 and the wall part 13 forming the first pressure introducing passage 14 therein. The sealing member 80<br><br><br>
and the wall part 13 are arranged to oppose against each other, so that the second pressure introducing passage 81 formed in the sealing member 80 and the first pressure introducing passage 14 formed in the wall part 13 can communicate with each other. The second pressure introducing passage 81 is formed in a shape that can seal the substantially cylindrical shaped sensing port 60b in the diametrical direction of the sensing port 60b. That is, the second pressure introducing passage 81 is formed in the shape which can diametrically seal the sensing port 60b.<br>
Here, the second pressure introducing passage 81 penetrates the sealing member 80. One end part (first end side part 80a) of the opening of the second pressure introducing passage 81 of the sealing member 80 is located on the side of the sensing port 60b of the pressure sensor 60. The other end part (second end side part 80b) of the opening of the second pressure introducing passage 81 of the sealing member 80 opposes against the wall part 13 of the outer peripheral wall part 11. The first end side part 80a and the second end side part 80b construct the sealing member 80. As shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, the first end side part 80a of the sealing member 80 is arranged to be able to engage with the pressure sensor 60 (specifically outer periphery of the sensing port 60b). The first end side part 80a is axially inserted to the outer periphery of the sensing port 60b, so that the first end side part 80a and the outer periphery of the sensing port 60b are diametrically sealed with each other. The second end side part<br><br>
80b of the sealing member 80 and the wall part 13 of the outer peripheral wall part 11 are arranged to oppose against each other. The second end side part 80b is inserted between the wall part 13 and a case (substrate receiving case) 70 used as a supporting member, so that a wall part end face 13a of the wall part 13 and a sealing member end face 80bb of the second end side part 80b are sealed face-to-face with each other. In this situation, the second end side part 80b and the wall part 13 are sealed face-to-face with each other, so that the second pressure introducing passage 81 and the first pressure introducing passage 14 are communicatable.<br>
The substrate 50 mounted with the pressure sensor 60 is received in the substrate receiving case (conductive member receiving case) 70.<br>
Thus, the sealing force, which works in the part sealed face-to-face among the wall part 13, the sealing member 80 and the substrate receiving case 70, can be generated by pressing force applied to the sealing member 80 by the wall part 13 and the substrate receiving case 70. Besides, the sealing force can be generated without applying external force to the pressure sensor 60 or the substrate 50 mounted with the pressure sensor 60. As a result, when the sealing member 80 is connected to a member (specifically the wall part 13), stress generated by connecting the sealing member 80 to the member (wall part 13) can be restricted from applying to the pressure sensor 60. Therefore, the pressure sensor 60 and the substrate 50 can be restricted from damage or failure of conductivity<br><br><br>
caused by cracking of solder or the like.<br>
Furthermore, in a construction process of the throttle apparatus 1 having the above structure, axial dimensional variation between the pressure sensor 60 and the first pressure introducing passage 14 can be absorbed by adjusting axial insertion degree between the sensing port 60b and the first end side part 80a which are diametrically sealed with each other. That is, axial misalignment between the elongated sensing port 60b of the pressure sensor 60 and the elongated first pressure introducing passage 14 of the wall part 13 in the elongated direction can be absorbed by adjusting the axial insertion degree between the sensing port 60b and the first end side part 80a of the sealing member 60.<br>
Additionally, the wall part end face 13a of the wall part 13 and the sealing member end face 80bb of the second end side part 80b of the sealing member 80 are sealed face-to-face with each other. Therefore, variation of distance in the direction (facial direction) perpendicular to the axial direction between the pressure sensor 60 and the wall part 13, i.e. a misalignment in the facial direction, can be absorbed by adjusting a displacement amount in the facial direction between the wall part end face 13a and the sealing member end face 80bb. As a result, misalignment in the direction, where the pressure sensor 60 contacts the member such as the wall part 13, can be absorbed. Besides, misalignment in the facial direction, which is perpendicular to the direction where the pressure sensor 60 is connected to the member (wall part 13),<br><br><br>
can be also absorbed.<br>
The supporting member is not limited to the substrate "receiving case 70, and can be any other member as long as the member can press the second end side part 80b onto the wall part 13 so as to seal the wall part end face 13a and the sealing member end face 80bb face-to-face with each other. When the substrate receiving case 70 is used as the supporting member, the wall part 13 and the second end side part 80b of the sealing member 80 can be sealed face-to-face with each other, without any additional member for supporting.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the substrate receiving case 70 has an opening part 71 into which a conductive member such as the substrate 50 can be inserted. Here, the substrate 50 is constructed with a printed board 51 on which the pressure sensor 60 and an electronic part 52 such as an IC and a semiconductor device as shown in FIG. 1 are mounted. The electronic part 52 and the pressure sensor 60 are electrically connected with a wiring circuit (not shown) formed on the printed board 51. The wiring circuit is electrically connected with an externally connecting terminal 53, which is used for receiving an information signal or the like transmitted from an external part via a wire harness (not shown). The externally connecting terminal 53 is also used for transmitting a control signal or the like to an external part via the wire harness. The externally connecting terminal 53 is connected to a connector 54. The conductive member such as the substrate 50 and the substrate receiving case 70 construct a<br><br><br>
controlling means (ECU) which controls the internal combustion engine. The ECU is operated as a computer in which a read only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), a microprocessor (CPU), an input port and an output port are connected with each other via a bidirectional bus (not shown).<br>
Here, the pressure sensor 60 is not necessarily mounted on the substrate 50. The pressure sensor 60 can be mounted on a metallic plate, and the metallic plate mounted with the pressure sensor 60 can be received in the substrate receiving case 70. As long as the pressure sensor 60 is mounted on any conductive member, such as a substrate and a metallic plate, and the conductive member is received in the substrate receiving case, any structures can be used for the throttle apparatus 1.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, a side face 72 of the outer periphery of the substrate receiving circuit 70 is used as a supporting member supporting the other end face 80b of the sealing member 80 with the wall part end face 13a of the wall part 13. A flange part 73 outwardly extends from the substrate receiving case 70 along with a plane of the side face 72. The flange part 73 is fixed to the outer peripheral wall part 11, specifically the arm part 19, using a screw 98 or the like.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, a guiding rail 74 is preferably formed in the opening part 71 along with the extending direction of the substrate 50, so as to be able to guide the substrate 50 inserted into the opening part 71. Therefore, while the pressure sensor 60 mounted on the substrate 50 is<br><br>
connected with the sealing member 80, the sealing member 80, (specifically a stepped part 80ba) can be displaced along with an engaging part 75 (FIG. 4) formed in the substrate receiving case 70 in the inserting direction. Thus, the substrate 50 can be inserted along with the guiding rail 74 to the predetermined position in the substrate receiving case 70. Therefore, relative position between the substrate 50 and the substrate receiving case 70 can be steadily fixed at the predetermined position in the substrate receiving case 70 while the substrate 50 is guided by the guiding rail 74, even when the sealing member 80 is not a rigid member.<br>
Here, as shown in FIG. 4B, the second end side part 80b has the stepped part 80ba which can engage with the substrate receiving case 70. Besides, as shown in FIGS. 4A and 4B, the substrate receiving case 70, specifically the side face 72 is formed along with the stepped part 80ba of the sealing member 80, and has an engaging part 75 that holds the second end side part 80b therein. Thus, the stepped part 80ba and the engaging part 75 can engage with each other, so that the sealing member 80 and the substrate receiving case 70 can be temporarily assembled. Therefore, the sensing port 60b of the pressure sensor 60 mounted on the substrate 50 can be attached to the first end side part 80a of the sealing member 80 so as to be diametrically sealed with each other. Besides, temporary assembling can be simultaneously performed between the pressure sensor 60 and the sealing member 80 while the substrate 50 mounted with the pressure sensor 60 is received<br><br>
in the substrate receiving case 7 0 before permanent assembling which is fixing of the temporarily assembled parts, for example.<br>
The substrate 50, the pressure sensor 60 and the sealing member 80 connecting between the pressure sensor 60 and the substrate receiving case 70 are received in the substrate receiving case 70, and filler (not shown) is filled inside the substrate receiving case 70, so that this assembling work is completed. The substrate 50, the pressure sensor 60 and the sealing member 80 are fixed in the substrate receiving case 70 by the filler.<br>
Furthermore in this embodiment, a substantially U-shaped notch part 76 (FIG. 4A) is preferably formed in the engaging part 75 along with the direction in which the substrate 50 is inserted into the substrate receiving case 70. Furthermore, the stepped part 80ba of the sealing part 80 can be inserted along with the substantially engaging part 75 formed in the substrate receiving case 70, while the substrate 50 is inserted into the substrate receiving case 70.<br>
Furthermore, the stepped part 80ba of the sealing member 80 is formed to be a groove part holding the engaging part 75 of the substrate receiving case 70 therein (FIG. 4B), preferably. Therefore, the stepped part 80ba can be easily inserted along with the engaging part 75 so as to be attached to the U-shaped notch part 76 of the substrate receiving case 70, while the substrate 50 is inserted into the substrate receiving case 70.<br><br><br>
Here, in the passage that introduces intake air passing through the intake passage 10a into the pressure sensor 60, the cross-section of the first pressure introducing passage 14 and the cross-section of the second pressure introducing passage 81 are preferably formed to be slightly overlapped each other, or not overlapped each other. Furthermore preferably, a step 15a is formed in at least one of the second end side part 80b of the sealing member 80 and the wall part 13 of the outer peripheral wall part 11. The second end side part 80b and wall part 13 are both sealed face-to-face with each other, so as to form the stepped passage 15. In this embodiment, the step 15a is formed in the wall part 13. The stepped passage 15 can communicate to the first pressure introducing passage 14 and the second pressure introducing passage 82.<br>
Thus, fluid flow passing through the first pressure introducing passage 14, the stepped passage 15 and the second pressure introducing passage 81 can be bent. Therefore, the passage introducing intake air from the intake passage 10a to the pressure sensor 60 can be formed in a labyrinth structure. As a result, even when intake air includes foreign substance such as oil, dust and the like, the foreign substance can be restricted from entering into the pressure sensor 60.<br>
The labyrinth structure is constructed with the second pressure introducing passage 81 formed in the sealing member 80, the first pressure introducing passage 14 formed in the wall part 13 and the stepped passage 15.  The stepped passage<br><br><br>
15 is constructed with the step 15a formed in at least one of the sealing member end face 80bb of the other end face 80b and the wall part end face 13a of the wall part 13, which oppose each other. The step 15a can be easily formed from the side of the sealing member end face 80bb and/or the wall part end face 13a by injection molding, cutting or the like. Therefore, the labyrinth structure can be formed without undercut or the like. As a result, the throttle apparatus 1, i.e., the intake apparatus 1 of the internal combustion engine 300 can be inexpensively produced.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 1 and 6, the second pressure introducing passage 81 is preferably located at a higher position with respect to the first pressure introducing passage 14, when the throttle apparatus 1 is mounted in the internal combustion engine 100. In detail, the vertically lowest point 81p of the opening of the second pressure introducing passage 81 located on the side of the second end side part 80b, is preferably located at a higher position compared with the vertically lowest point 14p of the opening part 14a of the first pressure introducing passage 14 which opens on the side of the intake passage 10a. Therefore, even when moisture and liquid, which are both contained in intake air, are lead into the pressure introducing passage 14, liquid such as water can be captured in the pressure introducing passage 14 located at a lower position compared with the second pressure introducing passage 81 connected with the pressure sensor 60. As a result, liquid can be restricted from<br><br><br>
flowing into the pressure sensor 60. Here, in FIGS. 1 and 6, upper and lower shown by allows indicate the vertical direction.<br>
Furthermore, when the throttle apparatus 1 or the internal combustion engine 100 including the throttle apparatus 1 is angularly mounted, and even when water and liquid contained in atmosphere accumulate, preferably the first pressure introducing passage 14 has a shape not to be plugged in consideration with the maximum slant in a mounted condition, for example. In detail, the vertically highest point of the opening of the first pressure introducing passage 14 which is located on the side of the wall part end face 13a is preferably located at a higher position compared with the vertically lowest point 14p of the opening part 14a of the first pressure introducing passage 14 which opens to the side of the intake passage 10a. Thus, the pressure sensor 60 can detect pressure of intake air, even when water and liquid contained in intake air accumulate in the first pressure introducing passage 14 by a predetermined amount.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5A and 5B, the first pressure introducing passage 14 preferably has a cross-sectional shape that is an elongated hole extending substantially in the vertical direction. Here, the vertical direction is a direction in which the cross-sectional center of the first pressure introducing passage 14 is connected with the cross-sectional center of the second pressure introducing passage 81 along with the line V-V in FIG. 1, or the plumb-bob vertical<br>
2-3<br><br>
direction. Thus, the liquid level (FIG. 6), to which water or liquid can accumulate in the first pressure introducing passage 14, can be secured by a predetermined height, so that the first pressure introducing passage 14 is not apt to be plugged.<br>
Furthermore, the opening part 14a of the first pressure introducing passage 14, which opens to the intake passage 10a, preferably protrudes into the intake passage 10a. In this structure, even when water or liquid contained in intake air passing through the intake passage 10a flows along with the inner peripheral wall of the intake passage 10a for example, the opening part 14a protruding into the intake passage 10a restricts the liquid from entering into the first pressure introducing passage 14.<br>
In the above embodiments, the pressure sensor 60 and the ECU electrically connecting with the pressure sensor 60 are preferably provided on the side of the bearing part 12a which is located on the opposite side of the bearing part 12b on which the biasing spring 40 is provided (FIG. 1). Thus, layout designing of the substrate receiving case 70 receiving the ECU constructed with the pressure sensor 60 and the substrate 50 can be easily performed for the throttle apparatus 1 having the pressure sensor 60 and the ECU, so that the layout designing of the components can be performed more freely.<br>
Furthermore, in the above embodiment, preferably the valve housing 10 has multiple arm parts 19 surrounding the<br>
— Z^&gt;(—<br><br>
wall part 13 in order to support the substrate receiving case 70. Besides, preferably a predetermined space is formed between the arm parts 19 facing to the substrate receiving case 70 and the wall part 13 facing to the sealing member 80. Thus, a physical relationship among the wall part 13 arranged between the arm parts 19, the substrate receiving case 70 and the sealing member 80 inserted between the wall part 13 and the substrate receiving case 70 can be confirmed (FIG. 1), so that assembly work can be easily performed.<br>
Furthermore, preferably a space 18 is formed between the arm parts 19, so that the sealing member 80 and the wall part 13 are seen through the space 18. Thus, a physical relationship among the wall part 13 arranged between the arm parts 19, substrate receiving case 70 and the sealing member 80 inserted between the wall part 13 and the substrate receiving case 70 can be confirmed, so that assembly work can be easily performed.<br>
(Second Embodiment and Third Embodiment)<br>

A sealing member 180 is constructed with the first end side part 80a and the second end side part 180b, and the second end side part 180b has a substantially circular shaped stepped part 180ba.  A sealing face 180bb is sealed with the<br>
■2.
 <br>
end face of the wall part 13 opposing to the second end side part 180b face-to-face each other. The engaging part 175 is formed to be along with the outer periphery of the stepped part 180ba, so as to be able to engage with the stepped part 18Oba. Therefore, the engaging part 175 is formed in a substantially circular shape similarly to the stepped part 180ba.<br>
Even in this structure as same as the first embodiment, misalignment in the direction, where the pressure sensor 60 is attached to the member such as the wall part 13, can be absorbed. Besides, misalignment in the facial direction, which is perpendicular to the direction where the pressure sensor 60 is attached to the member, can be also absorbed. Furthermore, the sealing member 180 and the substrate receiving case 70 can be temporarily assembled, so that the sensing port 60b of the pressure sensor 60 mounted on the substrate 50 can be attached to the first end side part 80a of the sealing member 80 so as to be diametrically sealed with each other. Thus, as same as the first embodiment, the temporary assembling can be simultaneously performed while the substrate 50 is received in the substrate receiving case 70.<br>
In the third embodiment as shown in FIGS. 8A and 8B, the stepped part 180ba explained in the second embodiment is formed to be a substantially cylindrical shaped stepped part 280ba (FIG. 8B), so as to be able to engage with the sensing port 60b of the pressure sensor 60.<br>
The sealing member 280 has the second end side part<br><br><br>
280b, and the second end side part 280b has the stepped part 280ba. A sealing face 280bb is sealed with the wall part end face 13a of the wall part 13 opposed to the second end side part 280b face-to-face each other. In this embodiment, the stepped part 280ba is formed in a substantially cylindrical shape, so as to be also used as the first end side part 280a equivalent to the substantially cylindrical shaped first end side part 80a described in the first and second embodiments.<br>
In this structure, a function equivalent to that of the second embodiment can be produced. Furthermore, the shape of the sealing member 80 can be simplified.<br>
(Fourth Embodiment)<br>
In the fourth embodiment, the first pressure introducing passage 14 having a vertically elongated cross-section described in the first embodiment is formed to be a first pressure introducing passage 114 having a substantially circular cross-sectional shape as shown in FIGS. 9A and 9B.<br>
The substantially circular shape of the first pressure introducing passage 114 preferably has a size such that the elongated hole described in the first embodiment approximately internally touches the substantially circular shape. Thus, water or liquid can accumulate by a predetermined level, so that the first pressure introducing passage 14 is not apt to be plugged. The substantially circular shaped first pressure introducing passage 114 receives a larger amount of liquid compared with the elongated hole shaped first pressure introducing passage 14, so that the passage is not apt to be<br><br><br>
plugged.<br>
In the above embodiments, the throttle apparatus 1 "having the pressure sensor 60 and the ECU is described. However for example, an intake module or the like which is constructed with the throttle apparatus 1 and the intake manifold 300a can use the structure of the present invention.<br>
