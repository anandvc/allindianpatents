FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[001] The present invention relates to a method of synthesizing polymerization catalyst components, and in particular to a method of synthesizing fluorided catalyst components comprising at least one fluoride leaving group, wherein the starting material is one or more alkylated catalyst components.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] Although much work has been done in olefin polymerization catalysis, there is still a desire to improve the process. In particular, there is a need to provide a practical, commercially viable method of making polyolefins that can utilize the newer "single-site" catalyst components known in the art. There is great interest because, while lab scale processes may afford desirable polymers using, • for example, metallocene catalyst components, commercial scale up is often hindered by problems such as reactor fouling. In particular, olefin polymerization reactions catalyzed using single-site catalyst components are often subject to uncontrollable phases, wherein the polymer agglomerates into large (greater than 1 cm) chunks or larger, and can often "sheet" on the inside surface of the reactor, causing, among other problems, a lack of heat removal in the reactor, and further "running away" of the polymerization. In these cases, the reactor must be shut down, resulting in costiy delays and lack of commercial viability.<br>
[003] A promising class of single-site catalysts for commercial use includes those wherein the metal center has at least one extractable fluorine (or fluorine "leaving group"). Disclosures of such catalysts include US 20020032287; WO 97/07141; DE 43 32 009 Al; EP-A2 0 200 351; EP-A1 0 705 849; E.F. Murphy, et al., Synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a series of substituted cyclopentadienyl Group 4 fluorides; crystal structure of the acetylacetonato complex [(acac)2(r|5-C5Me5)Zr(p-F)SnMe3Crj, dalton, 1983 (1996); A.

Complexes as Catalysts in Syndiospecific Styrene Polymerization, 30(25) macromolecules 7647-7650 (1997). Use of such single site catalyst components in a olefin polymerization system is desirable, especially in gas-phase polyethylene polymerization.<br>
[004] With the growing use of such catalysts, there is a need to provide a practical method of making such catalysts. Typically, the production of the fluorine-containing catalyst component, or "fluorided" catalyst component, entails the reaction of a fluoriding agent with the corresponding "chlorided" catalyst component. The use of some common fluoriding agents presents many challenges, excessive cost among them. Other methods of fluoriding metallocene catalyst components are disclosed by Z. Xie et al., Synthesis, Molecular Structure, and Reactivity of Organolanthanide Fluoride Complexes, [{(Me3Si)2CsH3}2Ln(p-F)] 2 (Ln =La, Nd, Sm, Gd) and [(C$H5hLn(u-F)(THF)] 2 (Ln = Y, Yb), 17 ORGANOMETALLICS 3937-3944 (1998); E.F.

Lukens, Jr. et al. in A it-Donor Specfrochemical Series for X in (MesCs)2TiX, and fi-Agostic Interactions in X = Et and N(Me)Ph, 118 J. am. CHEM. Soc. 1729-1728 (1996); and P.M. Druce et al. in Metallocene Halides: Pan I. Synthesis, Spectra, and Redistribution Equilibria ofDi-ic-cyclopentadienyl-Ti(IV), -Zr(TV), and -HfflV), 14 J. chem. Soc. 2106-2110 (1969). However, these methods fall short of a desirable, cost effective commercial method of making fluorided metallocene catalyst components. What is needed is an improved method of producing fluorided catalyst components that will be more practical and beneficial to commercial olefin polymerization and oligomerization processes. The present invention is directed towards this improvement.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[005] The present invention solves these and other problems by providing a method of making a fluorided catalyst component comprising contacting at least one fluoriding agent comprising fluorine with one or more alkylated metallocene catalyst components comprising one or more non-halogen leaving groups to produce a fluorided catalyst component; wherein from less than 3 equivalents of fluorine are contacted for every equivalent of leaving group. The method of the invention is exemplified by the following reaction which takes place in a non-coordinating diluent such as pentane:<br>
wherein one or both of the "Cp" rings may be substituted with an R group as described herein, and may be bridged. The reaction can be run at any desirable temperature, desirably between 10°C and 35°C. The reaction product of the BF3 and dimethyl zirconocene is the fluorided zirconocene. The mole ratio of the BF3 fluoriding agent and the starting metallocene is less than 2:1 (fluoriding agent:metallocene) in one embodiment, and less than or equal to 1.6:1 in a particular embodiment, and less than or equal to 1.5:1 in a more particular embodiment, and less than or equal to 1.2:1 in yet a more particular embodiment The method of the invention is an improvement over the prior art in allowing for full fluorination of a metallocene metal center without use of excess fluoriding agent, as well as allowing for full fluorination without increasing or decreasing the reaction temperature (relative to ambient temperature), both parameters of which influence costs hi bulk production of the fluorided metallocene catalyst component.<br>

form a chemical compound in such a manner that is consistent with known bonding schemes for such atoms.<br>
[026] In one embodiment of the invention, tin-based fluoriding agents are substantially absent, meaning they are not deliberately added, nor present to any detectable extent, in the fluoriding step of the invention. Tin-based fluoriding agents include compounds that consist of tin and atoms selected from hydrogen, chloride ions, fluoride ions, carbon and combinations thereof. Examples of tin-based fluoriding agents include SnFa, SnF4, and Sn(CH3)3F. In yet another embodiment, fluoriding agents comprising HF are substantially absent.<br>
[027] Non-limiting examples of fluoriding agents are selected from Et4NPF6, NKLtPFe, NEUF, NH^, (NH4)2TaF7, NttjNbF^ SnF4 and its alkylated derivatives (e,g., [CH3]3SnF) (NH4)2GeF6, (NHLOzSmFfi, (NHOzTiFe, (NH4)2ZrF6, MoF6, ReF6, GaF3, SQzCIF, F2, SiF4) SF6, C1F3, C1F5, BrF5, IFy, NF3, NHF2, CH3NHF, NH4HF2, NH4BF4, BF3, and other boron-fluoride compounds, and mixtures thereof.

{029] In any case, the fluorided catalyst components are obtained, in one embodiment, by contacting the alkylated catalyst component and fluoriding agent in a non-coordinating diluent. In a particular embodiment, the fluorided catalyst components are obtained by contacting the fluoriding agent with the alkylated catalyst component directly, without the addition of a diluent to either the fluoriding agent or allcylated catalyst component In yet another embodiment, the fluoriding component is added directly, without dilution in a diluent, into the alkylated catalyst component which is present in a non-coordinating diluent. By "contacting", it is meant that the components are added together, in the presence of a diluent in one embodiment, under conditions that favor a reaction between the fluoriding agent and the alkylated catalyst component that will produce a chemical bond between a fluorine atom and the metal center of the catalyst component.<br>
[030] The non-coordinating diluent is any substance or mixture of substances mat excludes chemical moieties that are capable of forming a chemical bond or ionic interaction with the allcylated olefin polymerization catalyst. Desirably, the non-coordinating diluent is one that is in a liquid state at the temperature at which the components are contacted with one another to affect the formation of a bond between at least one fluorine and the catalyst component. In one embodiment, the non-coordinating diluent is a liquid at between -30°C and 200°C at or near atmospheric pressure in one embodiment, and between -10°C and 100°C at or near atmospheric pressure in another embodiment.<br>
[031J In a particular embodiment, the non-coordinating diluent is a hydrocarbon diluent consisting of carbon and hydrogen. In another embodiment, the diluent may also include chlorinated hydrocarbons such as rnethylene chloride, trichloromethane, dichloroethane, etc. In a more particular embodiment, the non-coordinating diluent is selected from the group consisting of €4 to €40 linear alkanes, branched alkanes, cyclic alkanes, Q to Cao aromatic hydrocarbons, and mixtures thereof. In yet a more particular embodiment, the non-<br>
coordinating diluent is selected from the group consisting of butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, cyclohexane, benzene, ethylbenzene, toluene, xylene, naphthylene, isorners of each, and mixtures thereof.<br>
[032] A general reaction scheme for the synthesis of fluorided catalyst components of the invention can include step (b) alone, wherein the alkylated catalyst component is a starting material, or alternatively, can include steps (a) and (b) as follows:<br>
C + XAA -*   AC	(a)<br>
AC  + YFA -&gt;   FC	(b)<br>
wherein "C" is the catalyst component, "AA" is an alkylating agent, "AC" is an alkylated catalyst component, "FA" is the flue-riding agent, and "FC" is the fluorided catalyst component; X is the number of equivalents of AA; and Y is the number of equivalents ofFA;<br>
the value of X is a number, including fractional numbers, ranging from 0.5 to 5 in one embodiment; and ranging from 0.8 to 5 in another embodiment, and ranging from 1 to 2 in yet a more particular embodiment; and X is 2 in yet another embodiment; and<br>
the value of Y is a number, including fractional numbers, ranging from 0.1 to less than 3 in one embodiment; and ranging from 0.8 to less than 2.5 hi another embodiment, and ranging from 1 to less than 2 in yet a more particular embodiment, and ranging from 0.6 to 1.8 in yet a more particular embodiment, and ranging from 0.8 to 1.5 in yet a more particular embodiment, and ranging from 0.9 and 1.2 in yet a more particular embodiment, wherein the equivalents are based on the equivalents of the entire fluoriding agent compound.<br>
[033] The alkylating agent in (a) is any agent or combination of agents capable of forming one or more non-halogen—metal bonds between the metal center catalyst component and hydrocarbon or heteroatom containing group (e.g., alkyls, aryls, etc.), and in particular, capable<br>
of forming a bond between the hydrocarbon group or heteroatom containing hydrocarbon group and the Group 3 to Group 12 metal center of the catalyst component. In a particular embodiment, the alkylating agent is selected from Cj to Gs alley! Group 1 compounds, Ci to Ce alkyl Group 2 compounds, Cg to C\i aryl Group 1 compounds, Cg to C\2 aryl Group 2 compounds, aluminum alkyl compounds, and mixtures thereof, these compounds being capable of forming a carbon—metal bond. Examples of such compounds include triethylaluminum ("TEAL") and other methyl/ethyl aluminum derivatives; Grignard Reagents such as methylmagnesium bromide and phenylmagnesium bromide and other Grignard agents having the general formula RGMg(halogen), wherein the RG group is any alkyl or aryl group such as is defined for the X groups associated with the alkylated catalyst components; and lithium and sodium alkyl compounds. These compounds can be purchased or produced by techniques common in the chemical arts. Other alkylating agents capable of forming, for example, alkoxy linkages to the metal center are common in the art, such as Group 1 or Group 2 alkoxy reagents; and as disclosed by, for example, W.W. Lukens, Jr. et al., 118 J. AM. chem. Soc. 1729-1728 (1996) (methods of adding alkyls, alkoxys, amines leaving groups to metallocenes).<br>
[034J In one embodiment, step (a), or the alkylation step, takes place in a diluent having a dielectric constant greater than 2.0 at 20°C and a boiling point of, less than 100°C, less than 60°C in a particular embodiment. Described another way, the contacting step (a) takes place in a diluent selected from Cj to €20 heteroatom containing hydrocarbons; wherein the heteroatom is selected from oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous, nitrogen, fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Non-limiting examples of useful diluents include diethylether, tetrahydrofuran, DMSO, and other ethers and ketones. In a particular embodiment, the diluent used in (a) is one that can be easily removed under vacuum (from 1 to 1 x 10"6 torr) and/or gentle heating (less than 100°C) such that the AC product can be easily isolated. The reaction may take place from 1 min. to 24 hours at any temperature desirable to afford the maximum yield of mono-, di-, or mixed alkylated product, from -10°C to 40°C in one embodiment. The reaction can be monitored by techniques common in the art to determine a desirable stopping point.<br>
[035] hi a particular embodiment, the AC produced in step (a) above is isolated prior to contacting with a fluoriding agent. The isolated product AC may be in any form, typically a solid. This isolated AC, either synthesized as described herein or obtained in another fashion,<br>
may be further purified such as by extraction with a diluent selected from alkanes and aromatic hydrocarbons, desirably such diluents as pentane, hexane, cyclohexane and toluene.<br>
[036] In the fluoriding step, or step (b), it is desirable to contact the reactants in a non-coordinating diluent as described above. The reaction can be performed at any desirable temperature to afford the highest yield of desired products, as the reaction may be monitored by techniques common in the art; example temperature ranges are from -30°C to 140°C in one embodiment (or, for example, the reflux temperature of the hydrocarbon solvent such as toluene), and from 0°C to 50°C in a particular embodiment, and from 10°C to 35°C in yet a more particular embodiment, and from 15°C to 30°C in yet a more particular embodiment. In one aspect of the invention, the improved method of making the fluorided metallocene is characterized hi the lack of temperature control. Thus, in a particular embodiment, there is no external temperature control exerted on the system such as to significantly increase or decrease the temperature from ambient temperature. By "significant", it is meant that the temperature of the fluoriding reaction is not decreased or increased by more than 5°C.<br>
[037] hi a particular embodiment, it is desirable to choose a diluent for the fluoriding step such that the FC product will form a precipitate. The precipitate, or reaction product, may be extracted (or "washed") with any desirable volume of a hydrocarbon diluent to further isolate and purify the fluorided catalyst component. The diluent used to wash the reaction product solid may be at any desirable temperature to remove undesirable side products of the fluoriding reaction, at less than 80°C in one embodiment. In step (b), the fluoriding step, the AC and FA may be at any concentration that will afford the highest yield using a given diluent. In one embodiment, the AC and FA are independently present in the diluent from up to 10 M (molar) hi concentration, and from 1 uM to 2 M in a particular embodiment, and from 1 mM to 1 M in a more particular embodiment, and from 10 mM to 0.5 M hi yet a more particular embodiment.<br>
[038] In a particular embodiment, diluents comprising groups selected from non-conjugated carbon-carbon double bonds, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous, halogens, Group 1 to Group 12 atoms, lauthanide Group atoms, and actinide Group atoms and any combination thereof are substantially absent in the fluoriding step, or (b) above. By substantially absent, it is meant that<br>
these diluents are not deliberately added, and particularly, are present, if at all, to an extent no greater than the concentration of the fluoriding agent in the fluoridation step.<br>
[039]   A more particular representation of the fluoriding step of the invention is represented by (c):<br>
(Cp),.2MXn    +    YFfA    -&gt;    (Cp),.2MFyX(n.y) (c)<br>
wherein (Cp)]_2MXn is an alkylated metallocene catalyst component having n number of non-halogen leaving groups X; Cp is cyclopentadienyl or ligands isolobal to cyclopentadienyl, one or both of which may be substituted; each Cp is bound to M; M is the metal center of the catalyst component and each of X and F (fluoride ion), when present, are chemically bonded to M; n is an integer from 1 to 3;<br>
Y is a number, including fractional numbers, from 0.1 to 3, and represents the number of equivalents of the compound "FfA" as a whole;<br>
FfA is the fluoriding agent having f number of fluorine atoms per molecule of fluoriding agent, wherein f is an integer from 1 to 6 in one embodiment, and from 2 to 6 in another embodiment; F is a fluoride ion; and<br>
(Cp)|.2MFyX(n-y) is the fluorided metallocene catalyst component; and y is an integer from 1 to 3.<br>
[040] The value of Y in reaction scheme (c), as in (b), is any number, including fractional numbers, less than 2, or 1.9, or 1.8, or 1.7, or 1.6, or 1.5, or 1.4, or 1.3, or 1.2, or 1.1, and greater than 0.3, or 0.4, or 0.5, or 0.6, or 0.7, or 0.8, or 0.9; wherein Y represents the equivalents of the entire fluoriding agent.<br>
[041] The total equivalents of fluorine (as part of the fluoriding agent) is the value of Y multiplied by the value of f. In the method of the present invention, the total equivalents of fluorine per equivalent of non-halogen leaving group X provided by the fluoriding agent is less<br>
than 3 in one embodiment, and less than or equal to 2.5 in a more particular embodiment, and less than or equal to 2 iu a more particular embodiment, and less than or equal to 1.5 in yet a more particular embodiment. In another aspect of the invention, the total equivalents of fluorine per equivalent of non-halogen leaving group X is any number, including fractional numbers, less than 3, or less than or equal to 2.8, or 2.5, or 2.2, or 2.0, or 1.8, or 1.5, or 1.4, or 1.3, or 1.2, or 1.1, and greater than or equal to 1.<br>
[042]   In one aspect of the invention, each X (in scheme (c) and in formula/structures (I) through (VI) infra) is independently selected from: any non-halogen leaving group wherein the atom bonded to the metal is selected from hydride, Group 12 to Group 16 atoms in one embodiment; hydride, Ci to Cn alkyls, Ca to Cn alkenyls, Cg to Cn aryls, C? to czq alkylaryls, Ci to Cn alkoxys, Ce to Qe aryloxys, C7 to C]8 alkylaryloxys, Q to Cn fluoroallcyls, Ce to Cn fluoroaryls, and Ci to Cn heteroatom-containing hydrocarbons and substituted derivatives thereof; hydride, Ci to Ce alkyls, €2 to Ce alkenyls, C? to Qg alkylaryls, Ci to Ce alkoxys, Ce to ch aryloxys, €7 to Cie alkylaryloxys, d to Ce alkylcarboxylates, C\ to Ce fluorinated alkylcarboxylates, Ce to Cn arylcarboxylates, Ci to Cig alkylarylcarboxylates, Ci to C<s fluoroalkyls to c fluoroalkenyls and cib fluoroalfcylaryls in yet a more particular embodiment hydride methyl phenyl phenoxy benzoxy tosyl fluoromethyls fluorophenyls even particularly each x is independently selected from groups that provide for one bond between carbon of the group metal center metallocene thus forming an such consisting ci cn alkyls c2 ci2 alkenyls ce aryls c2o alkylaryls substituted heteroatom-containing ca cis halogenated ethyl propyl methylphenyl dimethylphenyl trimethylphenyl di- trifluorometriyls tri terra- pentafluorophenyls embodiment.></s>
1043] In a particular embodiment of scheme (c), f is 3, n is 2, Y is less than 2, and y is 2; wherein n = y in a desirable embodiment. In another embodiment, f is 3, n is 2, Y is 1 or less than 1, and y is 2. la yet another embodiment, f is 3, n is 1, Y is less than 1, and y is 1. Thus, the present invention provides for a method of replacing at least two alkyl group (non-halogen groups) with two fluorine groups while using less than 2 equivalents of fluoriding agent.<br>
[044] Stated yet another way, the method of the present invention allows for the addition of from 0.6 to 2.5 equivalents of fluorine (as part of the fluoriding agent) for every equivalent of non-halogen leaving group bound to the metal center of the alkylated catalyst component in one embodiment, and from 0.8 to 2.0 equivalents of fluorine (as part of the fluoriding agent) for every equivalent of non-halogen leaving group bound to the metal center of the alkylated catalyst component in another embodiment; and from 0.8 to 1.5 equivalents of fluorine (as part of the fluoriding agent) for every equivalent of non-halogen leaving group bound to the metal center of the alkylated catalyst component in yet a more particular embodiment.<br>
[045] As an example, the alkylated catalyst component may be such a compound as a metallocene wherein two X groups are methyl groups. Once the fluorination process is carried out as described above, the fluorided catalyst component is the corresponding metallocene wherein one or both X groups are fluorides, depending upon the number of equivalents of the fluoriding agent are contacted with the alkylated catalyst component. In one embodiment, less than 2 equivalents of fluoriding agent are added to replace both methyl groups with fluorine ions. If only one X is substituted with fluoride, the other X is the starting methyl group.<br>
[046] In embodiments of the fluoriding step wherein the fluoriding agent is immiscible or only partially miscible with the diluent, it is within the scope of the invention to use a reagent that will assist the transport of the fluoriding agent to the alkylated catalyst component or the diluent phase in which the alkylated catalyst component exists, or assist in die reaction between the fluoriding agent and alkylated catalyst component. Such reagents—phase-transfer catalysts—are known in the art and are used in reactions wherein, for example, an aqueous or polar diluent phase is in contact with a non-polar or hydrocarbon diluent phase, and the reactants are separated as such. Non-limiting examples of such phase-transfer catalysts include<br>
quaternary ammonium salts (e.g., quaternary ammonium bisulfate), crown ethers, and others common in the art.<br>
1047} The invention as described herein also includes a method of producing polyolefins comprising the steps of first contacting at least one fluoriding agent with one or more alkylated catalyst components to produce a fluorided catalyst component; followed by contacting the fluorided catalyst component with an activator and olefins selected from Ca to Cn olefins under polymerization conditions to produce a polyolefin. The fluorided catalyst component may thus be part of a catalyst system used to oligomerize or polymerize olefins. Methods of polymerization, and common polymerization conditions, are described further herein.<br>
(048] Thus, the present invention may be described by any combination of any of the embodiments or particular embodiments herein presented.<br>
(049] In one aspect, the invention is a method of making a fluorided metallocene catalyst component'comprising contacting at least one fluoriding agent comprising fluorine with one or more alkylated metallocene catalyst components comprising one or more non-halogen leaving groups to produce a fluorided catalyst component; wherein from-less than 3 equivalents of fluorine are contacted for every equivalent of leaving group.

In another embodiment, less than or equal to 2.5 equivalents of fluorine are contacted per equivalent of leaving group. In yet another embodiment, less than or equal to 2 equivalents of fluorine are contacted per equivalent of leaving group, and in yet another more particular embodiment, less than or equal to 1.5 equivalents of fluorine are contacted per equivalent of leaving group, and hi yet a more particular embodiment, less than or equal to 1.2 equivalents of fluorine are contacted with the alkylated catalyst component per equivalent of non-halogen leaving group bound to the catalyst component<br>

The reaction product may be extracted with a hydrocarbon solvent at from less than 80°C to yield the fluonded catalyst component in one embodiment, and extracted at a temperature of less than 70°C in another embodiment, and extracted at a temperature of less than 60°C in yet a more particular embodiment to further isolate the pure fluonded catalyst component. In one embodiment, the fluoriding agent is added as a neat composition. By "neat composition", it is meant that the fluoriding agent is not diluted, suspended or solublized in a diluent such that more than 2 equivalents of diluent exist per equivalent of fluoriding agent; or. alternately, the neat composition is one wherein no other diluent is added.<br>
[052] The fluoriding agent and alkylated catalyst component are contacted in a non-coordinating diluent. The non-coordinating diluent is a hydrocarbon diluent consisting essentially of carbon and hydrogen in one embodiment. The non-coordinating diluent is selected from the group consisting of C

[083] It is contemplated that the metallocene catalysts components described above include their structural or optical or enantiomeric isomers (racemic mixture), and may be a pure enantiomer in one embodiment.<br>
[084] As used herein, a single, bridged, asymmetrically substituted metallocene catalyst component having a racemic and/or meso isomer does not, itself constitute at least two different bridged, metallocene catalyst components.<br>
[085] The "metallocene catalyst component" useful in the present invention may comprise any combination of any "embodiment" described herein.<br>
Activator<br>
[086] An activator is present with the catalyst system comprising the fluorided metallocene catalyst components of the present invention. As used herein, the term "activator" is defined to be any compound or combination of compounds, supported or unsupported, which can activate a single-site catalyst compound (e.g,, metallocenes), such as by creating a cationic species from the catalyst component. Typically, this involves the abstraction of at least one leaving group (X group in the formulas/structures above) from the metal centenof the catalyst component. The catalyst components of the present invention are thus activated towards olefin polymerization using such activators. Embodiments of such activators include Lewis acids such as cyclic or oligomeric poly(hydrocarbylaluminum oxides) and so called non-coordinating ionic activators ("NCA") (alternately, "ionizing activators" or "stoichiometric activators"), or any other compound that can convert a neutral metallocene catalyst component to a metallocene cation that is active with respect to olefin polymerization.<br>
[087] More particularly, it is within the scope of this invention to use Lewis acids such as alumoxane (e.g., "MAO"), modified alumoxane (e.g., "TIBAO"), and alkylaliiminum compounds as activators, and/or ionizing activators (neutral or ionic) such as tri (n-butyl)ammonium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)boron and/or a trisperfluorophenyl boron metalloid precursors to activate desirable metallocenes described herein.

Supports<br>
[100] A support may also be present as part of the catalyst system of the invention. Supports, methods of supporting, modifying, and activating supports for single-site catalyst such as metallocenes are discussed in, for example, 1 METALLOCENE-BASED PoLYOLEFlNS 173-218 (J. Scheirs &amp; W. Karninsky eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000). The terms "support" or<br>
"carrier", as used herein, are used interchangeably and refer to any support material, a porous support material in a particular embodiment, including inorganic or organic support materials. Non-limiting examples of support materials include inorganic oxides and inorganic chlorides, and in particular such materials as talc, clay, silica, alumina, magnesia, zirconia, iron oxides, boria, calcium oxide, zinc oxide, barium oxide, thoria, aluminum phosphate gel, and polymers such as polyvinylchloride, non-functionalized polystyrene and substituted polystyrene, ranctionalized or crosslinked organic supports such as polystyrene divinyl benzene polyolefius or polymeric compounds, and mixtures thereof, and graphite, in any of its various forms.<br>
[101] The support may be contacted with the other components of the catalyst system in any number of ways. In one embodiment, the support is contacted with the activator to form an association between the activator and support, or a "bound activator". In another embodiment, the catalyst component may be contacted with the support to form a "bound catalyst component". In yet another embodiment, the support may be contacted with the activator and catalyst component together, or with each partially in any order. The components may be contacted by any suitable means as in a solution, slurry, or solid form, or some combination thereof, and may be heated when contacted to from 25°C to 250°C.<br>
[102] Desirable carriers are inorganic oxides that include Group 2, 3, 4, 5, 13 and 14 oxides and chlorides. Support materials include silica, alumina, silica-alumina, magnesium chloride, graphite, and mixtures thereof in one embodiment. Other useful supports include magnesia, titania, zirconia, montmorillonite (EP 0 511 665 Bl), phyllosilicate, and the like. Also, combinations of these support materials may be used, for example, silica-chromium, silica-alumina, silica-titania and the like. Additional support materials may include those porous acrylic polymers described in EP 0 767 184 Bl.<br>
[103J In one aspect of the support useful in the invention, the support possess a surface area in the range of from 10 to 700 m2/g, pore volume in the range of from 0.1 to 4.0 cm3/g and average particle size in the range of from 5 to 500 um. In another embodiment, the surface area of the carrier is in the range of from 50 to 500 m2/g, pore volume of from 0.5 to 3.5 cm3/g and average particle size of from 10 to 200 um. In yet another embodiment, the surface area of the carrier is in the range is from 100 to 400 m2/g, pore volume from 0.8 to 3.0 cmVg and<br>
average particle size is from 5 to 100 urn. The average pore size of the carrier of the invention typically has pore size in the range of from 10 to 1000A, from 50 to 500A in another embodiment, and from 75 to 350A in yet another embodiment.<br>
[104] In one embodiment of the support, graphite is used as the support. The graphite is a powder in one embodiment, hi another embodiment, the graphite is flake graphite. In another embodiment, the graphite and has a particle size of from 1 to 500 microns, from 1 to 400 microns in another embodiment, and from 1 to 200 in yet another embodiment, and from 1 to 100 microns in yet another embodiment.<br>
[105] The support, especially an inorganic support or graphite support, may be preireated such as by a halogenation process or other suitable process that, for example, associates a chemical species with the support either through chemical bonding, ionic interactions, or other physical or chemical interaction. Examples of desirable chemical species include alkyls, alkylamines, mercapto compounds and halogens (F, Cl, Br). In one embodiment, the support is fluorided. The fluorine compounds suitable for providing fluorine for the support are desirably inorganic fluorine containing compounds. Such inorganic fluorine containing compounds may be any compound containing a fluorine atom as long as it doesjiot contain a carbon atom. Particularly desirable are inorganic fluorine containing compounds selected from the group consisting of NHJBF^ (NH4)2SiF6, NK|PF6, NHiF, (NH4)2TaF7, NH4NbF4, (NH^GeFg, (NHOaSmFe, (NH^TiFe, (NH^ZrFe, MoF6, ReF6, GaF3, S02CIF, F2, SiF4, SF6, C1F3, C1F5, BrFj, IFy, NF3, HF, BF3, NHF2 and NHjHF2.<br>
[106] A desirable method of treating the support with the fluorine compound is to dry mix the two components by simply blending at a concentration of from 0.01 to 10.0 millirnole F/g of support in one embodiment, and in the range of from 0.05 to 6.0 millimole F/g of support in another embodiment, and in the range of from 0.1 to 3.0 rnillimole F/g of support in yet another embodiment. The fluorine compound can be dry mixed with the support either before or after charging to the vessel for dehydration or calcining the support. Accordingly, the fluorine concentration present on the support is in the range of from 0.2 to 5 wt% in one embodiment, and from 0.6 to 3.5 wt% of support in another embodiment.<br>
[107J Another method of treating the support with the fluorine compound is to dissolve the fluorine in a solvent, such as water, and then contact the support with the fluorine containing solution (at the concentration ranges described herein). When water is used and silica is the support, it is desirable to use a quantity of water that is less than the total pore volume of the support. Desirably, the support and, for example, fluorine compounds are contacted by any suitable means such as by dry mixing or slurry mixing at a temperature of from 100°C to 1000°C in one embodiment, and from 200°C to 800°C in another embodiment, and from 300°C to 600°C in yet another embodiment, the contacting in any case taking place for between two to eight hours.<br>
[108] Dehydration or calcining of the support may or may also be carried out. ha one embodiment, the support is calcined prior to reaction with the fluorine or other support-modifying compound. In another embodiment, the support is calcined and used without further modification, or calcined, followed by contacting with one or more activators and/or catalyst components. Suitable calcining temperatures range from 100°C to 1000°C in one embodiment, and from 300°C to 900°C in a more particular embodiment, and from 400°C to 850°C in yet a more particular embodiment Calcining may take place in the absence of oxygen and moisture by using, for example, an atmosphere of dry nitrogen.<br>
[109J  It is within the scope of the present invention to co-contact (or "co-immobilize") more than one catalyst component with a support Non-h'miting examples of co-immobilization of catalyst components include two or more of the same or different metallocene catalyst components, one or more metallocene with a Ziegler-Natta type catalyst, one or more metallocene with a chromium or "Phillips" type catalyst, one or more metallocenes with a Group 15-containing catalyst (e.g., zirconium bis-amide compounds such as in US 6,300,438 Bl), and any of these combinations with one or more activators.   More particularly, co-supported combinations include metallocene A/metallocene A; metallocene A/metallocene B; metallocene/Ziegler Natta; metallocene/Group 15-containing catalyst; metallocene/chromium catalyst;  rnetallocene/Ziegler Natta/Group   15-containing  catalyst;  metallocene/chromium catalyst/Group 15-containing catalyst, any of the these with an activator, and combinations thereof.<br>
[110]  Further, the catalyst system of the present invention can include any combination of activators and catalyst components, either supported or not supported, in any number of ways. For example, the catalyst component may include any one or both of metallocenes and/or Group 15-containing catalysts components, and may include any combination of activators, any of which maybe supported by any number of supports as described herein. Non-limiting examples of catalyst systems useful in the present invention include MN + NCA; MN:S + NCA; NCA-.S + MN; MN:NCA:S; MN + AlA; MN:S + AlA; A1A:S + MN; MN:A1A:S; A1A:S + NCA + MN; NCA:S + MN + AlA; G15 + NCA; G15:S + NCA; NCA:S + G15; G15:NCA:S; G15 + AlA; G15:S + AlA; A1A-.S + G15; G15:A1A:S; AIA:S + NCA + G15; NCA:S + G15 + AlA; MN + NCA + G15; MRS + NCA + G15; NCA:S + MN ± G15; MN:NCA:S + G15; MN + G15 + AlA; MN:S + AIA + G15; A1A:S + MN + G15; MN:A1A:S + G15; A1A:S + NCA + MN + G15; NCA:S + MN + AIA + G15; MN + NCA; G15:MN:S + NCA; G15:NCA:S + MN; G15:MN:NCA:S; G15:MN:S + AIA; G15:A1A:S + MN; G15:MN:A1A:S; G15:A1A:S + NCA + MN; G15:NCA:S + MN + AIA; wherein "MN" is metallocene component, "NCA" is a non-coordinating activator including ionic and neutral boron and aluminum based compounds as described above, "AIA" is an aluminum alkyl and/or alumoxane based activator, "G15" is a Group 15-containing catalyst component as described above, and "S" is a support; and wherein the use of ":" with "S" means that that those groups next to the. colon are associated with ("supported by") the support as by pretreatment and other techniques known in the art, and the "+" sign means that the additional component is not directly botind to the support but present with the support and species bound to the support, such as present in a slurry, solution, gas phase, or another way, but is not meant to be limited to species that have no physico-chemical interaction with the support and/or supported species.   Thus, for example, the embodiment "MN:NCA:S + G15" means that a metallocene and NCA activator are bound to a support, and present in, for example, a gas phase polymerization with a Group 15-containing catalyst   component.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
[111] The catalyst system useful in catalyzing the production of polyolefins include at least one fluorided catalyst component as described herein, and at least one activator. The catalyst system described herein is suitable for use in any olefin prepolymerization and/or polymerization process over a wide range of temperatures and pressures and other conditions.<br>
Suitable polymerization processes include solution, gas phase, slurry phase and a high pressure process, or a combination thereof. A desirable process is a gas phase or slurry phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene.<br>
[112] The temperatures at which polymerization takes place may be in the range of from -60°C to 2SO°C in one embodiment, and from 50°C to 200°C in another embodiment, and the pressures employed may be in the range from 1 atmosphere to 500 atmospheres or higher.<br>
[113] In one embodiment, the process of this invention is directed toward a solution, high pressure, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, from 2 to 12 carbon atoms in another embodiment, and from 2 to 8 carbon atoms in yet another embodiment. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two or more olefin monomers of ethylene, propylene, 1-butene, 1-pentene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, 1-hexene, 1-octene and 1-decene.<br>
[114] Other monomers useful in the process of the invention include ethylenically unsaturated monomers, diolefins having 4 to IS carbon atoms, conjugated or nonconjugated dienes, polyenes, vinyl monomers and cyclic olefins. Non-limiting monomers useful in the invention may include norbomene, norbornadiene, isobutylene, isoprene, vinylbenzocyclobutane, styrenes, alkyl substituted styrene, ethylidene norboraene, dicyclopentadiene and cyclopentene.<br>
[115] In a desirable embodiment of the process of the invention, a copolytner of ethylene derived units is produced in a gas phase process, the comonomer being an ct-olefin having from 4 to 15 carbon atoms in one embodiment, and from 4 to 12 carbon atoms in another embodiment, and from 4 to 8 carbon atoms in yet another embodiment.<br>
[116] In another embodiment of the process of the invention, ethylene or propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a terpolymer.<br>
[117] In the production of polyethylene or polypropylene, comonomers may be present in the polymerization reactor. When present, the comonomer may be present at any level with the<br>
ethylene or propylene monomer that will achieve the desired weight percent incorporation of the comonomer into the finished resin. In one embodiment of polyethylene production, the comonomer is present with ethylene in a mole ratio range of from 0.0001 (comonomer.ethylene) to 50, and from 0.0001 to 5 in another embodiment, and from 0.0005 to 1.0 in yet another embodiment, and from 0.001 to 0.5 in yet another embodiment. Expressed in absolute terms, hi making polyethylene, the amount of ethylene present in the polymerization reactor may range to up to 1000 atmospheres pressure in one embodiment, and up to 500 atmospheres pressure in another embodiment, and up to 200 atmospheres pressure in yet another embodiment, and up to 100 atmospheres in yet another embodiment, and up to 50 atmospheres in yet another embodiment<br>
[118]   Hydrogen gas is often used in olefin polymerization to control the final properties of the<br>
polyolefin, such as described in POLYPROPYLENE HANDBOOK 76-78 (Hanser Publishers, 1996).<br>
Using the catalyst system of the present invention, is known that increasing concentrations<br>
(partial pressures) of hydrogen increase the melt flow rate (MFR) and/or melt index (MI) of the<br>
polyolefin generated. The MFR or MI can thus be influenced by the hydrogen concentration.<br>
The amount of hydrogen in the polymerization can be expressed as a mole ratio relative to the<br>
total polymerizable monomer, for example, ethylene, or a blend jof ethylene and hexane or<br>
propene. The amount of hydrogen used in the polymerization process of the present invention<br>
is an amount necessary to achieve the desired MFR or MI of me final polyolefin resin. In one<br>
embodiment, the mole ratio of hydrogen to total monomer (H2:monomer) is hi a range of from<br>
greater than 0.0001 in one embodiment, and from greater than 0.0005 hi another embodiment,<br>
and from greater than 0.001 hi yet another embodiment, and less than 10 in yet another<br>
embodiment, and less than 5 hi yet another embodiment, and less than 3 in yet another<br>
embodiment, and less than 0.10 in yet another embodirnentj wherein a desirable range may<br>
comprise any combination of any upper mole ratio limit with any lower mole ratio limit<br>
described herein.  Expressed another way, the amount of hydrogen hi the reactor at any time<br>
may range to up to 5000 ppm, and up to 4000 ppm in another embodiment, and up to 3000 ppm<br>
in yet another embodiment, and between 50 ppm and 5000 ppm in yet another embodiment,<br>
and between 500 ppm and 2000 ppm hi another embodiment.<br>
[119] In another embodiment, the invention is directed to a polymerization process, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase process, for polymerizing propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and/or other olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms. Polypropylene polymers may be produced using any suitable bridged metallocene-type catalysts such as described in, for example, US 6,143,686, US 6,143,911, US 5,296,434 and US 5,278,264.<br>
[120J Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed wherein one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer.<br>

[121] Further, it is common to use a staged reactor employing two or more reactors in series, wherein one reactor may produce, for example, a high molecular weight component and another reactor may produce a low molecular weight component. In one embodiment of the invention, the polyolefin is produced using a staged gas phase reactor. This and other commercial polymerization systems are described in, for example, 2 metallocene-based POLYOLEHNS 366-378 (John Scheirs &amp; W. Kaminsky, eds. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. 2000). Gas phase processes contemplated by the invention include those described in US 5,627,242, US 5,665,818 and US 5,677,375, and European publications EP-A- 0 794 200 EP-Bl-0 649 992, EP-A- 0 802 202 and EP-B- 634 421.<br>
[122] The one or more reactor pressures in a gas phase process (either single stage or two or more stages) may vary from 100 psig (690 kPa) to 500 psig (3448 kPa), and in the range of from 200 psig (1379 kPa) to 400 psig (2759 kPa) in another embodiment, and in the range of from 250 psig (1724 kPa) to 3 50 psig (2414 kPa) in yet another embodiment.<br>
[123] The one or more reactor temperatures in the gas phase process may vary from 30°C to 120°C, and from 60°C to 115°C in another embodiment, and in the range of from 70°C to 110° C in yet another embodiment, and in the range of from 70°C to 95°C in yet another embodiment. For purposes of this patent specification and appended claims the terms "polymerization temperature" and "reactor temperature" are interchangeable.<br>
[124] The gas phase reactor employing the catalyst system described herein is capable of producing from 500 Ibs of polymer per hour (227 Kg/hi-) to 200,000 Ibs/hr (90,900 Kg/hr), and greater than 1000 Ibs/hr (455 Kg/hr) in another embodiment, and greater than 10,000 Ibs/hr (4540 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and greater than 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,300 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and greater man 35,000 Ibs/hr (15,900 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and greater than 50,000 Ibs/hr (22,700 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment, and from 65,000 Ibs/hr (29,000 Kg/hr) to 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment.<br>
[125] A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from 1 to 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, a branched alkane in one embodiment. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. In one embodiment, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.<br>
[126] Another desirable polymerization technique of the invention is referred to as a particle form polymerization, or a slurry process where the temperature is kept below the temperature at which the polymer goes into solution. Other slurry processes include those employing a loop reactor and those utilizing a plurality of stirred reactors in series, parallel, or combinations<br>
thereof. Non-limiting examples of slurry processes include continuous loop or stirred tank processes. Also, other examples of slurry processes are described in US 4,613,484 and 2 metallocene-based polyolefins 322-332 (2000).<br>
[127] The slurry reactor employing the catalyst system described herein is capable of producing greater than 2000 Ibs of polymer per hour (907 Kg/hr), and greater than 5000 Ibs/hr (2268 Kg/hr) in another embodiment, and greater than 10,000 Ibs/hr (4540 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment. In another embodiment, the slurry reactor used in the process of the invention produces greater than 15,000 Ibs of polymer per hour (6804 Kg/hr), and from 25,000 Ibs/hr (11,340 Kg/hr) to 100,000 Ibs/hr (45,500 Kg/hr) in yet another embodiment.<br>
[128] In one embodiment of the process of the invention, the slurry or gas phase process is operated in the presence of a Cp ligand metallocene-type catalyst system of the invention and in the absence of, or essentially tree of, any scavengers, such as triethylaluminum, trimethylaluminum, tri-isobutylaluminum and tri-n-hexylaluminum and diethyl aluminum chloride, dibutyl zinc and the like. By "essentially free", it is meant that these compounds are not deliberately added to the reactor or any reactor components, and if present, are present to less than 1 ppm in the reactor.<br>
[129] In another embodiment, one or all of the catalysts are combined with up to 10 wt% of a metal stcarate, (e.g., an aluminum stearate or aluminum distearate) based upon the weight of the catalyst system (or its components), any support and the stearate. In an alternate embodiment, a solution of the metal stearate is fed into the reactor. In another embodiment, the metal stearate is mixed with the catalyst and fed into the reactor separately. These agents may be mixed with the catalyst or may be fed into the reactor in a solution or a slurry with or without the catalyst system or its components.<br>
[130] In another embodiment, the supported catalyst(s) are combined with the activators and are combined, such as by tumbling and other suitable means, with up to 2 wt% of an antistatic agent, such as a methoxylated amine, an example of which is Kemamine AS-990 (ICI Specialties, Bloomington Delaware). Further, additives may be present such as carboxylate metal salts, as disclosed in US 6,300,436.<br>
[131] The process of the invention can be used to make any number of polyolefins, in particular, polyethylene and polypropylene, either homopolymer, random copolymers, block copolymer, LLDPE, HOPE, LDPE, VLDPE, and variations of these,<br>
[132]   One aspect of the present invention is a method of producing polyolefins comprising the steps of (a) contacting at least one fluoriding agent with one or more alkylated metallocene catalyst components to produce a fluorided metallocene catalyst component; wherein from less man 2.0 equivalents of fluoriding agent are contacted for every equivalent of alkylated catalyst component; followed by (b) contacting the fluorided metallocene catalyst component with at least one activator and olefins selected from C^ to Cu olefins under polymerization conditions to produce a polyolefra.  The fluoriding step of (a) in the method of producing olefins can include any of the embodiments described above for the fluoriding step.   The step (a) may precede step (b) by any amount of time that is advantageous to the production of the polyolefins. For example, the fluoriding step may take place in a reaction vessel, isolated, then transferred to the polymerization reactor by any suitable means over a period of hours to days. The fluorided metallocene may be isolated and then supported on, for example, silica, as described above, and the silica itself may optionally be pre-treatedjwith modifying agents (e.g., fluorided), and/or pre-contacted with an activator such as MAO or a stoichiometnc boron compound (e.g., trisperfluorophenylboron). The fluorided metallocene, either supported or not, may be kept as a solid or slurried/dissolved in, for example toluene, mineral oil, or some other non-coordinating diluent. The slurried fluorided metallocene may be transferred as such into the polymerization reactor.   Given the relatively high activity of such catalysts, there is an advantage  mat   low  quantities  of the  fluorided  metallocene  are  necessary to   affect polymerization.<br>

[143] Comparative Example 4.

After stirring at room temp, for 18 h, solid had formed on the flask walls. The liquid was decanted away and residual solvent was removed from the solid under reduced pressure. The remaining solution was concentrated to 20 mL and the resulting precipitate was isolated. The precipitate was recrystallized from pentane/toluene (2:1) at -25 °C giving off-white needle crystals. -The crystals were washed with cold pentane (20 mL) and residual solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The combined yield of solid was 4.27 g. The ]H NMR spectra of both crops did not correspond to a. Heating the solid under vacuum did not produce any change hi the product.<br>
[144] The present invention offers several advantages over the prior art. Yields of fluorided catalyst component can range from 50% to greater than 90% in one embodiment, and from 55% to 80% a more particular embodiment The fluorided catalyst component product is easily isolated, as it is typically a solid precipitate. Also, the present invention offers an economical approach to synthesizing fluorided catalyst components, as it is possible to select a fluoriding agent that is less expensive than prior art fluoriding agents.<br>
[145] Another advantage of the method of the present invention is the ease with which the fluorided catalyst component is isolated. In particular, since a non-coordinating diluent is used, in particular, a hydrocarbon diluent, the reaction byproduct can be removed without heating the<br>
product. The reaction between the alkylated catalyst component and fluoriding agent typically results in a byproduct that includes the corresponding alkylated-fluoriding agent. For example, when BFa is the fluoriding agent, and a methyl group is the alkyl leaving group bound to the alkylated catalyst component, the byproduct is BF2CH3 and/or BF(CH3)2. This must be separated from the desired fluorided catalyst component. In the present invention, the fluorided catalyst component tends to precipitate out from the non-coordinating diluent used while the alkylated fluoriding agent remains dissolved. Simple extraction and/or washing of the precipitate with the hydrocarbon solvent in which the reaction takes place will suffice in removing any remaining traces of residual fluoriding agent and other reaction products, without heating.<br>
[146] Thus, in one embodiment, the fluoridation reaction product is extracted with a hydrocarbon diluent at from less than 60°C, and in a more particular embodiment, extracted with a hydrocarbon diluent at from less than 50°C, and in a more particular embodiment, extracted with a hydrocarbon diluent at from less than 40°C, and in yet a more particular embodiment, extracted with a hydrocarbon diluent at from less than 30°C.<br>
[1471 Yet another advantage of the present invention is the surprising ability to allow full and efficient fluoridation of the alkylated catalyst component (replacement of both leaving groups) with less than 2 equivalents of the fluoriding agent, or less than 3, or less than or equal to 1.5, equivalents of fluorine (as part of the fluoriding agent) per equivalent of leaving group bound to the rnetallocene metal center. For example, while the prior art discloses the use of BFa, two or more equivalents of BF^ are used for every one equivalent of metallocene. Examples 1-4 show the utility of using less than 3 equivalents of fluorine for every equivalent of leaving group.<br>
[148J In particular, Example 4, Method C, shows the utility of adding only 3.2 mmol fluoriding agent to 4.73 mmol alkylated metallocene, or about 0.7 equivalent fluoriding agent for every one equivalent alkylated metallocene, or about 1 equivalent of fluorine for every equivalent of non-halogen leaving group (methyl). This is in contrast to the comparative Example 4 where, even in pentane (a non-coordinating diluent), the use of two moles of fluoriding agent per mole of metallocene (or about 3 moles fluorine per mole non-fluorine<br>
leaving group) leads to products not corresponding to the desired difluorided metallocene. Further, the prior art discloses the use of 3 equivalents of fluorine (wherein there are three equivalents of fluorine per equivalent of etherate-BF3) for every equivalent of leaving group. See W.W. Lukens, Jr. et aL, 118 J. am. CHEM. Soc. at 1726 (1996). Thus, the method of the present invention allows for the economical use of the fluoriding agent—a significant cost savings in bulk production of catalyst component.<br>
[149J To add to the economy of the method of the invention, the fluoriding agent may be added as a pure compound—not diluted or solublized in any diluent prior to reaction with the alkylated catalyst component. Thus, for example, neat BFs as a liquid, purchased as the diether, may be added directly to the agitated solution of alkylated catalyst component in non-coordinating diluent. Further, there is no need to either cool or heat the reaction, thus adding further to its economy and simplicity. Finally, to further add to the economy of the invention, the method allows for the use of relatively low cost fluoriding agents such as the Group 13 fluoriding agents or boron compounds, as compared to tin-based fluoriding agents commonly used in the art (e.g., (Bu)3SnF).<br>
[150] As well, the method of the invention can be tailored to suit most any catalyst component for olefin polymerization and oligomerization. The fluorided catalyst components of Hie invention maybe selected such that reactor fouling (sheeting, agglomeration, etc.) is reduced or eliminated. Desirably, the polymerization method includes a gas-phase or slurry process wherein sheeting, as indicated by, for example, a raise in the reactor wall temperature, is substantially absent. By "substantially absent", it is meant that, over at least a 8 day period of continuous reactor polymerization, there is no sheeting as indicated by a less than 5°C increase in the reactor wall temperature.<br>
[151] The method of the invention is particularly suited for the fluoriding of alkylated metallocene catalyst components described in general as (Cp)rMXn; wherein Cp is cyclopentadienyl or group isolobal to cyclopentadienyl and may be substituted in any position, each Cp being bound to the metal center M; wherein r is 1 or 2; and wherein if r is 1, the Cp may be bridged to one or more X groups; and wherein if r is 2, the two Cp's may be bridged as described above; and wherein M is the metal center as defined above, and X is any non-<br>
halogen leaving group as defined above, each X being bound to the metal center M; and wherein n is 1 or 2. In a particular embodiment, each X is independently selected from methyl, phenyl, and benzyl.<br>
[152] Certain features of the present invention are described in terms of a set of numerical upper limits and a set of numerical lower limits. It should be appreciated that ranges formed by any combination of these limits are within the scope of the invention unless otherwise indicated.<br>
[153] Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties, reaction conditions, and so forth, used in the specification and claims are to be understood as approximations based on the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention, and the error of measurement, etc., and should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and values setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth are reported as precisely as possible.<br>
