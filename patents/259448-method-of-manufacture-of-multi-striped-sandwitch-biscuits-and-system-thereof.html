SANDWICH  BISCUITS  AND SYSTEM THEREOF.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
The present  invention relates  to manufacture of biscuits  and, in particular, to a process for the  manufacture  of  biscuits   involving  multi-striped  deposition   of  ingredients  which  are difficult to handle  and also to a system  for producing  such multi-stripped biscuits  involving selective 	combination	of 	a	conveyor 	and 	depositors 	having 	multiple 	outlets. Advantageously, the  invention would  favour  simple  and  effective   manufacture of  biscuits involving  multi-stripped  deposition   of  chocolates   and  caramel   which   are   both   difficult ingredients to  handle.  Importantly, the  system  of  producing   such  multi-stripped  biscuits with  deposition  of chocolates  and caramels  is achieved  by way of a selective  combination of processes  and   devices   mutually  cooperative   and   interactive  which   would   favour   the depositing  and conveying apropos biscuit  industry.<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND ART<br><br>
It is well known  to independently handle conventional creams which are non-sticky in nature to provide  sandwich  biscuits.  It is also known  that  the  provision of such sandwich  biscuits under   the   presently    available  conventional  system   is  complex   and   basically   involve independent    handling  of   conventional  creams   thorough    multi-outlet  composite   nozzle depositor  and  multi-lane  conveyers.

The  nature  of the  invention, its  objects  and advantages  are discussed  in  further  details  in relation  to  non-limiting  exemplary illustration of  the  process/system as per  the  following accompanying figures:<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING  FIGURES:<br><br>
Figure  lA: is a top  plan  view  of  the  system  for  producing  the  multi stripped  sandwiched biscuits in accordance  with  the present  invention;<br>
Figure lB: is an elevation view of the system shown in Figure lA;  and<br><br>
Figure 2: is a top perspective  view of the    assembly of the system of the invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING  FIGURES:<br><br><br>
Reference  is first  invited to  accompanying figure  1A  which  illustrate in  top  plan  view  the system   for   providing  multi-stripped  sandwiched    biscuits   in   accordance   with    present invention. As clearly  illustrated in  said  figure,  the  system  basically  involved a multi-lane conveyer    (150C)  disposed  on a machine  frame  (150). In accordance  with  the  embodiment of  the  system  shown  in  the  figure,  the  multi-lane conveyer  (150C)  is  shown  to  comprise four  lanes  (Ll, L2, L3 &amp; L4).  The bottom  shells  of the  biscuit  are  fed on to  the  multi-lane conveyer  through chute  (100). The multi-layer stripe  formulations are carried  and deposited through deposited  unit  (130)  with  one  said  deposited  unit  ( 130)  provided on top  of each multi-lane conveyer  (150C). For feeding  in the  top shell  chutes  (140)  are provided as also illustrated in said figure.  The sandwich  biscuits  produced  by the system  are finally  take into the cooling  tunnel.<br><br><br>
In figure  1B, the  system  according  to  figure  1A is illustrated by  way  of an elevation  view which clearly  shows the provision of the conveyer and the deposited  unit  ( 130)  which can be a  stainless  steel  bowl/container/pipe having  separate  reservoirs   for  containing the  multi­ stripe  formulations to be deposited  on the bottom shell through nozzles  in the lower  end of the depositor  (130).<br><br><br>
Reference  is  now   invited  to   accompanying  figure   2  which   illustrate  by  way  of  a  top perspective  view  the  arrangement of the  multi-lane conveyer  (150C)  on the  machine  frame (150). The figure  also  illustrates the  feeding  chutes  (100)   which  feed  the  bottom shell on the  respective  multi-lane conveyers  and  also the  feeding  chutes  (140)  which  feed the  top shell of the biscuit.<br><br><br>
In accordance  with  an  aspect  of  the  invention, the  depositor  (130)   can  be  provided  with separate  reservoir for containing separately  caramel  and chocolate  which  can be deposited simultaneously on the  bottom shell through  separate  nozzles at the bottom of the depositor (130). Thus, to obtain  such multi-stripped caramel chocolate  sandwich  biscuits, the bottom shell  is first  fed  through chutes  (100)  on respective  conveyer  lanes  on  which  the  bottom shell  is  carried  under   the  depositor   (130).  As and  when,  the  bottom shell   is  under  the depositor  (130)   the  multi-stripes of  caramel  and  chocolates  are  deposited  on  the  bottom shell and thereafter bottom shell  with  multiple stripes  thereon  are allowed  to travel  on the respective  conveyer  lanes.  Thereafter, through  chutes  (140)  the  top  shell  is fed on top  of<br><br>
the  multi-stripped bottom shell to obtain  the sandwich  biscuits  which  is finally  taken  to the cooling  tunnel. The above deposition of chocolates can be effected  involving solenoid  valves while  the caramel  deposition can be effectively attained  involving plunger  pumps.  However, it is also possible  to use other  types  of depositor  units  such as depositor  systems  involving gear pumps, piston pumps  and other types of dosing pumps and the like.<br><br><br>
It is thus  possible  by  way  of above illustrated system  to achieve  multi-stripe  simultaneous deposition  of variety of formulation such as the chocolate  and caramel  to produce  sandwich biscuits.  The multi-lane conveyer, the depositor  and the selectively disposed  feeding  chutes for  the  bottom shell  and  the  top  shell  provide  for  simple  and  user  friendly  production of multi-stripe simultaneously deposited  sandwich biscuits.<br><br><br>
Importantly,  by  way  of  the  above  system  and  the  method  of  deposition it is  possible  to produce  separate  strips  of chocolates  and caramels  and/or any  other  combination of strips by  multi-outlet nozzles  in  the  depositor   to  obtain  biscuits   of  varying   form,  taste,   bite, flavour  and colour  etc. Thus, by way of the above disclosed system  of the invention different formulation can be processed  simultaneously in different mixers  wherein  mixing parameters like  mixing  time,  mixer  speed, temperature etc. can be varied  depending  upon  the  desired layer characteristics of the sandwich  biscuit  of the invention.<br><br><br>
The present    invention thus   provides  for  a simple  and effective combination of the  means for  feeding  the  bottom and  top  shells,  depositor, conveyer  to  produce  the  much  desired multi stripes  such as  chocolate  and caramel  biscuits  with selective  taste, colour, flavour  and bite.<br><br>
As clearly  illustrated in the accompanying figures the system the invention would enable manufacture  of  multi striped   biscuits   such  as  chocolate  and  caramel   biscuits   involving controlled  and selective  deposition of multi  stripes  such as the chocolate  and caramel  strips over the baked biscuit  shells wherein  the depositing  of the strips  can be carried  out over the baked biscuit  shells through a selective multi-outlet.<br><br>
Thus  the   above   illustrated  system   of  the   present   invention  is  directed   to  a  selective combination of processes viz. depositing and conveying  apropos  biscuit  industry.<br><br>
Advantageously, the system  of the invention provides  a combination of equipment, effecting multi-striped deposition of varity of formulations as multi strips  such as the  chocolate  and<br><br><br><br>
caramel   which   are   both   difficult  ingredients to   handle.   As  clearly   apparent   from   the illustrations, the process according  to an aspect of the invention can   involve  any number  of multi-lane conveyors  to move  biscuit  shells for   such   deposition   of consistent and uniform strips  of chocolate  and caramel  of consistent  length  and weight.     The deposition of stripes such as the chocolate  is advantageously achieved  by solenoid  valves  with   consistent  weight<br>
&amp; length  and  that  of  caramel  is advantageously achieved  by  a reciprocating plunger  type<br><br>
pump  which  also gives  consistent weight  and  length.   The system    is adapted   to  produce about  200 sandwiches  per minute. The above system   of the invention provides    a selective combination of  multi-outlet depositor  and  multi-lane conveyors  to  efficiently produce  the multi  strip   sandwiched  biscuits.<br><br><br><br><br>
The invention would  thus  favour  the manufacture of multi-stripped biscuit  of varying  taste, colour, flavour  and bite especially  in the middle  layer. The system  therefore,  enables simple sandwiching the multi-stripped middle  layer  between  the baked  biscuit  shells  by way of the selective  combination of the depositor  and   conveyer  providing for the multi stripes  biscuits of desired  taste  and  flavour  and  is directed  to  widely  and advantageously serve  the  biscuit industry to meet the present  day challenges  of the consumers  and the industry.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

iii) at least one multi stripe formulation carrying and depositing unit (130) selectively disposed on top of each said lane of the conveyor and each having multiple outlets for depositing plurality of striped formulations simultaneously on the bottom shell during its traversal through said lane on said conveyor;<br>
iv) plurality of chute means (140) corresponding to the number of lanes of the conveyor for providing the top shells on top of the respective multi striped  bottom shell to thereby produce simultaneously striped multi-striped sandwiched biscuits.<br><br><br>
ABSTRACT<br>
Multistriped sandwich biscuits and, in particular, a process for the manufacture of biscuits involving multi-striped deposition of ingredients which are difficult to handle and also to a system for producing such multi-stripped biscuits involving selective combination of conveyors and depositors having multiple outlets. Advantageously, the invention would favour simple and effective manufacture of biscuits involving multi-stripped deposition of chocolates and caramel, which are both difficult ingredients to handle. Importantly, the system of producing such multi-stripped biscuits with deposition of chocolates and caramels is achieved by way of a selective combination of processes and devices mutually cooperative and interactive which would favour the depositing and conveying apropos biscuit industry.</td>
