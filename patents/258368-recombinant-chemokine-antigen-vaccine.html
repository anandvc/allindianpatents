				<td>RECOMBINANT CHEMOTACTIC ANTIGEN GENE VACCINE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a new recombinant gene sequence, a fusion protein expressed from the gene, and vaccines produced with the gene, as well as to different gene vaccines produced by replacing the antigen gene in the recombinant sequence, or to use of the expression products as fusion peptide vaccines.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Human secondary lymphoid tissue chemokine (SLC) has been paid much attention since its discovery. SLC regulates the secretion of cytokines, alters the immunosuppression states of the microenvironment of tumor, and promotes the development of Thl. Thus, SLC is useful in anti-tumor immunity. Further, SLC has effect in attracting the lymphocytes and dendritic cells (DC). The intratumor injection induces the local and systematic anti-tumor immune responses. SLC can also regulate the suppression of angiogenesis in the tumors. Thus, SLC is very useful in cancer immunotherapy. However, use of SLC protein alone or transgenic method did not show satisfactory results in anti-tumor immunity. Si-Yi Chen et al. have suggested that anti-tumor immunoreaction can be enhanced by immunizing mice with DCs that are transfected with recombinant retrovirus vector containing genes encoding IgG Fc fragment and tumor antigen. The mechanism is that the fusion protein secreted and expressed from DC is re-captured by DCs through the Fc receptor (FcR), and then the fusion protein epitope is presented to T helper cells (Th) through MHC class II molecules and cross presented to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) through MHC class I molecules, through which anti-tumor humoral-and-cellular immunity is induced systematically. Serre K et al. have reported that capacity of DC in capturing antigens through FcR-mediating endocytosis is 10,000 times higher than that through pinocytosis. However, the isolation, amplification and gene transfection of DC increase the complexity of the vaccine production. In this case, the DCs have to be prepared individually, which hampered the quality control and industrial production.<br>

This invention also relates to the use of the recombinant gene sequence of the invention, including SEQ ID NO: 1, in preparing vaccines.<br>
As can be seen from above, the strategy for the chemotactic antigen of the invention is as follow: linking the chemokine of SLC upstream to the antigen and linking the Fc of IgG downstream to the antigen; introducing the three parts-fused gene directly into healthy or tumor tissues for expression and secretion; and forming a two-part conjoined body through Fc hinge region. The said recombinant protein actively attracts DC and T cells through the chemoatactic activity of SLC in vivo. DC captures the fusion protein with high efficiency through pinocytosis, especially with the help of Fc receptor and SLC receptor CCR7. Meanwhile, DC carries the antigen into the cell. After being processed and treated, the antigen is presented to Th and CTL through MHC-II or MHC-I molecule. Finally, specific anti-tumor humoral and cellular immune response is induced completely. In addition, DC can be activated by the combination of Fc fragment with Fc receptor of DC. SLC can actively abstract DC and T lymphocytes, as well as promotes the secretion of cytokines such as IL-12, IFN-y, and interferon-induced protein (IP-10), promotes the development of Thl, down-regulats the production of TGF-p and VEGF. Thus, SLC is very useful in anti-tumor immunity. For the reason mentioned above, such combination has synergistical effect and can induce stronger anti-tumor immune response (See Figure 1).<br>
In this invention, different recombinant genes are used, but not intending to restrict the invention. The study for control has revealed that either in the form of plasmid or in the form fusion protein, the recombinant chemokine antigen can be produced industrially. The step of preparation of DC has been omitted in the application.<br>
However, DC can be targeted with high efficiency in vivo. Moreover, introduction of restrictive endonuclease sites into the two ends of antigen gene makes it possible to replace the antigen to produce various chemokine antigen vaccines against tumorous or non-tumorous diseases. For example, a new chemokine antigen vaccine can be produced by replacing the HP antigen in SLC-HP-Fc with prostate cancer-relating antigen.<br>
The recombinant gene can be constructed into the eukaryotic vectors by using direct injection of the plasmid into the body or tumor. Other techniques such as gene gun and electrical pulse can enhance the transfection rate and expression efficiency. Constructed recombinant virus, such as retrovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus, vaccine virus, herpes simplex virus and so on, can also be used as vaccine for in vivo injection. The plasmid can be transfected into Eukaryotic cell (for example, CHO) and cultured in vitro for secretion and expression. Through the Fc fragment, the fusion protein can be easily and efficiently isolated and purified by Affinity Chromatography method, and can be used as protein vaccine.<br>

The invention will be described in details with the illustration of the invention. It should be apprehended that the aim of the relating embodiments is only to give an explanation, but not intending to restrict the invention.<br>
Example.    Cloning of human SLC gene<br>
The mRNA was extracted from the lymph node of patients suffering from cancer. By using the methods well known for those skilled in the art, the Kpnl restrictive endonuclease site was added to the SLC forward primer ( 5'-cggtaccacagacatggctcagtcac-3') and the sequence encoding three glycins and EcoRI restrictive endonuclease site was added to the SLC reverse primer ( 5' -tgaattctcctcctcctggccctrtagg-3'). The SLC gene was acquired by RT-PCR amplification. The acquired fragment was purified and inserted into pUCmT vector (pUC-SLC) for sequencing. The result shows that the sequence of the acquired fragment was in accordance with the designed sequence (the underlined fragment).<br>
In this invention, sequencing of the PCR products was performed by using 377 DNA sequencer (ABI company) by four-colored fluorescence terminator sequencing method based on SANGER dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. The sequence from position 36 to position 464 is the sequence of the cloned fragment of the invention (Refer to SEQ ID NO: 3).<br>
Example 2   Preparation and linkage of Her-2/neu gene<br>
First, two fragments of Her-2/neu gene were cloned by PCR method. The first fragment was acquired as follows: The used forward primer is 5'-agaattcaagatctttgggagcctggcatttctgggctacctgctcatcgctca c-3', having EcoRI restrictive endonuclease site, and the used reverse primer is 5'-gatgcccagcccttgca gggccagggcatagttgtc-3'. The plasmid containing extra cellular segment of neu gene was adopted as template and the fragment corresponding to amino acid sequence from<br>
position 82 to position 115 was amplified, wherein the amino acid V at position 103 was replaced by amino acid L. The second fragment was acquired as follows: the forward primer was 5'-ctgcaagggctgggcatc-3', and the reverse primer having Ncol restrictive endonuclease site was 5'-tccatggcccggttggcagtgtggag-3'. The fragment corresponding to amino acid sequence from position 445 to position 499 was amplified.<br>
The two PCR products were collected and linked together in a PCR system. Further, the resulted fragment was used as template, by using the forward primer of the first fragment and the reverse primer of the second fragment; a fusion gene with 294bp in size was amplified. Then the resulted fusion gene was inserted into pUCmT vector (pUC-Her2P) and sequenced. The result indicates that the sequence of the obtained fusion gene is in accordance with the designed sequence (the underlined sequence).<br>
The result is indicated in SEQ ID NO: 4, wherein the sequence from position 121 to position 465 is the sequence of the cloned fragment of the invention.<br>
Example 3    Cloning of p53 gene segment<br>
A 402bp gene fragment encoding the amino acids from position 156 to position 289 in p53 protein was cloned from the plasmid containing the whole length of p53 gene. The primers used were as follows: forward primer with one Ncol restrictive endonuclease site was 5'-ace atg gcc ate tac aag cag tea cag cac atg ac-3'; reverse primer with one EcoRV restrictive endonuclease site was 5'-tga tat ctt tct tgc gga gat tct ctt c-3'. The obtained fragment was inserted into pUCmT vector (pUC-p53P) for sequencing. The result indicates that the sequence of the obtained fragment is in accordance with the expected sequence (the underlined segment).<br>
The result is indicated in SEQ ID NO: 5, wherein the sequence from position 39 to position 445 is the sequence of the inventive fragment.<br>
Example 4   Linkage of Her2/neu and p53 fragments<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the smaller fragment cut from pUC-Her2P by EcoRI/Ncol and the smaller fragment cut from pUC-p53P by NcoI/EcoRV were ligated with the larger fragment cut from pcDNA3z by EcoRI/EcoRV to construct a plasmid of pcDNA-Her2/p53, also called pcDNA-HP. HP means a gene ligated by Her2/neu and p53. The artificially ligated Her2/neu-p53 fragment contains genes encoding HLA-I and HLA-II molecule-binding peptide.<br>
Example 5   Construction of PcDNA-Fc<br>
First, the chemically synthesized multiple cloning sites were used to replace the multiple cloning sites of pcDNA3.1.<br>
The process of construction was as follows: Chemically synthesize two oligonucleotides.<br>
The forward primer was<br>
5' -GCTAGCGAAGCTTTGGTACCGTAGGATCC ACG AATTC AGTCCAGGATAT CGGCGGTGG-3'<br>
The reverse primer was<br>
5' -GGTTTAAACGTTAACCCCGGGCCCTCGAGCTCTAGAGCCTCCTCCACCGC CGATATC-3'<br>
The last 15 bases at the 3' ends of each primer are complementary to each other. The PCR product was obtained in a system with the mixture of the two primers at the ratio of 1:1, Taq DNA polymerase and dNTP at 45 °C for renaturing and elongation. The purified product was inserted into pUCmT vector for sequencing. The result shows that the sequence of the obtained product is in accordance with the designed sequence. The underlined sequence indicates the synthesized multiple cloning sites. The final resulting multiple cloning sites were: "Nhel-Hindlll-Kpnl -BamHl-EcoRl-EcoRV- Glysinex5 -Xbal- Xhol- Apal-Smal- Hpal-Pmel". In this sequence, a small gene fragment (GGCGGTGGAGGAGGC) encoding for five glycins was inserted between EcoRV and Xbal sites. Nhel/Pmel cut the cloned plasmid and a fragment about lOObp in size was obtained. Then, the fragment was ligated with the larger fragment cut from pcDNA3. 1 by Nhel/Pmel to construct a new vector named pcDNAf.<br>
The result of sequencing the chemically synthesized multiple cloning site is indicated in SEQ ID NO: 6, wherein the sequence from position 3 to position 100 is the sequence of the inventive fragment.<br>
The process for constructing PcDNA-Fc plasmid<br>
The Fc fragment was cut from IgGl Fc-containing plasmid by Xbal/Apal restrictive endonucleases and inserted into pcDNAf vector, wherein the pcDNAf vector was treated with the same endonuclease. The resulted construction was named as PcDNA-Fc. The sequence of IgGl Fc was confirmed by sequencing the resulted plasmid.<br>
The sequencing of Fc fragment<br>
The Fc fragment with 900bp in size was amplified from plasmid containing IgGl Fc gene by PCR and inserted into pUCmT vector for sequencing. The primers used in the amplification were: forward primer: 5'-gaattcggagttaacgagcccaaatcttg-3'; reverse primer: 5'-gggccctcatttacccggagac-3'. The result of sequencing reveals that the plasmid contained the hinge region, CH2 and CH3 of IgGl. That is to say, the plasmid<br>
contained Fc fragment (See the underlined sequence). The result is indicated in SEQ ID NO: 7, wherein the sequence from position 78 to position 991 is the inventive sequence.<br>
Example 6   Linkage of SLC-Her2/neu-Fc gene<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the larger fragment cut from pcDNA-HP with Kpnl/EcoRI was linked with the smaller fragment cut from pUC-SLC with Kpnl/EcoRI to construct pcDNA-SLC-HP. Then, the smaller fragment cut from pcDNA-SLC-HP by KpnI/EcoRV was linked with the larger fragment cut from pcDNA-Fc by KpnI/EcoRV to construct pcDNA-SLC-HP-Fc (also named as pSLC-HP-Fc).<br>
The construction of control plasmid is indicated in Figure 2<br>
Example 7. Detection of cellular and secreted recombinant protein in cells transfected with gene vaccine by Western Blot<br>
The recombinant plasmid of pSLC-HP-Fc was transfected into B16-F10 cells by using the method of liposome. The positive clones were selected by G418. Cultured the cells in serum-free 1640 medium for 24 hours, and then collected and concentrated the supernant. The method of Western Blot was used to detect the expression of the fusion protein. The used primary antibody was rabbit-anti-human p53 polyclonal antibody, and the second antibody was HRP-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit antibody.

Tests examples<br>
Test 1.    Detection of the immune cells-chemoatactic activity of fusion protein by Boyden chamber<br>
In vitro abstracting activity of human SLC:<br>
A.	The Melanoma cell line B16F10 was transfected with the purified plasmid<br>
pcDNA3z-SLC-HP-Fc and the control plasmid.    48 hours after incubation, the culture<br>
medium   was   harvested   and   concentrated   by   PEG20000   (the   supernant   from<br>
untransfected B16-F10 cells was used as negative control).<br>
B.	Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were collected from the 5 ml of<br>
healthy whole peripheral blood by Lymphocyte Separation Medium, washed twice with<br>
saline, and re-suspended in RPMI-1640 serum-free medium.    The PBMC were counted<br>
and diluted at the concentration of 1 * 106/ml.<br>
C.	Preparation of the Boyden Chamber: the Chamber was purchased from Neuro<br>
Probe Co.    The lower wells of the chamber were filled with 27 ^il conditioned culture<br>
medium, whereas the upper wells were filled with 50 ul of Ixl06/ml PBMC cell<br>
suspension.    The lower and upper wells were separated by a polycarbonate filter<br>
(Neuro Probe) with 5 um pore size.    The chamber was incubated at 37°C with 5% COi<br>
for 4 h.<br>
D.	The filter was unloaded and the cells were scraped off from the upper side of<br>
filter, following by washing, fixing and staining the filter.   The migrated cells in five<br>
randomly selected high power (*200) fields were counted.   The CI (Chemotactic Index)<br>
was calculated by the following: CI=the cell number of five high power field in the<br>
studied wells/cell number of five high power field in the control wells.   The value of<br>
CI of negative group was 1.<br>
Table 1    Detection of the chemoatactic activity of fusion protein<br>
Groups	Counts         of      CI	P value<br>
chemoatactic<br>
cells<br><br>
(Table Remove) vs negative control.    ** vs psig-HP.<br>
Result: The level of the chemoatactic activity of serum-free supernant from cells transfected with pSLC-HP-Fc is significantly higher than others, indicating that after transfection, the plasmid can be expressed and the expressed protein has activity. The level of chemoatactic ability of pSLC-HP-Fc transfecting cells is similar to that of pSLC transfecting cells, indicating that the fusion protein does affect the activity of SLC.<br>
Test 2   Anti-tumor immune response of human chemotactic antigen gene vaccine in mice<br>
The plasmids (nude gene) were loaded on gold particles and coated onto the inner surface of Tefzel tubing that was cut into proper segments as bullet to deliver 1 ug DNA according to the BioRad's manual. Several groups were divided as controls: control vector, pSLC-Fc, psig-HP (the plasmid expressing HP containing the SLC signal peptide), pSLC-HP and psig-HP-Fc.<br>
Test 3   Immune-response against cancer<br>
14 days and 7 days before tumor inoculation, the mice were vaccinated twice with pSLC-HP-Fc or control vectors at the abdomen skin. On day 0, each mouse was inoculated with 5xl04 B16F10 tumor cells (The B16F10 cells were transfected with HP gene and selected by G418) in 0.2ml solution. The tumor sizes were recorded 2-3 times per week. The tumor size was calculated as length (cm)xwidth (cm2).<br>
Result: Vaccination of pSLC-HP-Fc twice significantly improves the tumor suppression effect (See Figure 5, 6) and the average survival period of mice is significantly prolonged. The therapeutic effect of pSLC-HP-Fc is significantly better than any other vectors (p
Test 4   Immunotherapy for cancer<br>
On day 0, the each mouse was inoculated with 5 x 104 B16F10 tumor cells in 0.2 ml solution. On day 6, 12, 18, the mice were vaccinated by Gene Gun System. The tumor sizes were recorded 2-3 times per week. The tumor sizes were evaluated as mentioned above.<br>
Result: As shown in Figure 7 and 8, the pSLC-HP-Fc vaccine displays the most effective suppression of tumor growth. On day 28, the difference between pSLC-HP-Fc and psig-HP-Fc groups is significant (P
Test 5.    CTL activity induced by the tumor chemotactic antigen gene vaccine<br>
Two weeks after three times of vaccination by Gene Gun System, tumor-bearing mice were killed and cytotoxicity assay of CTL was performed with the use of spleen cells by the LDH Kits (Promega). The ratio of spleen cell and target cell (E:T ratio) was 40:1,20:1 and 10:1, respectively.<br>
Result: The lymphocytes derived from chemokine nucleotide vaccine immunized mice showed significant cytotoxicity effect on B16F10-HP cells (See Figure 9). When the E:T ratios was 40:1 or 20:1, there was still significant difference between the studied vaccine and control vectors (P
Test 6   Detection of specific antibodies in serum of the immunized mice<br>
The amount HP-specific antibodies in the serum of the immunized mice group was detected by ELISA, 2 and 4 weeks after immunization (pSLC-HP-Fc). Briefly, microtitre plates coated with recombinant p53 proteins were incubated overnight, blocked with 20% Calf Serum, and incubated with primary antibody (serially diluted mouse serum) and secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG) in turn. After washing and visualizing by OPD (O-Phenylene diamine) , the OD value was read at 490nm. A monoclonal antibody against p53 was used as a positive control and normal mouse serum was used as a negative control.<br>
Result: The level of p53 antibody of SLC-HP-Fc immunized mice is the highest and significantly higher than that of other vectors (See Figure 10).<br>
Test 7    pSLC-HP-Fc immunization induced human  specific  CTL against Her2/neu or p53 in vitro<br>
By centrifugation using Lymphocyte Separation Medium, mononuclear cells (MNCs) were collected from the whole peripheral blood of healthy HLA-A2+ donors. Half of the MNCs were transfected with the plasmid pSLC-HP-Fc using liposome and incubated with untreated MNCs at the ratio of 1:1 at 37°C with 5% CO2. On day 6, the viable cells were counted, re-suspended and cultured with different target cells at different E:T ratios in 96-well microplates. The LDH assay (Promega Kits) was used to analyze the cytotoxicity.<br>
Result: After mixed culture, the pSLC-HP-Fc transfects MNC induced specific CTL to kill tumor cells that overexpress Her2/neu or p53 in a MHC-restricted manner (See Fig 11). That is to say, the specific CTL only significantly kills HLA-A2"1" tumor cells that express Her2/neu or p53, indicating the specificity of CTL induced by the chemotactic antigen gene vaccine.<br>
Test 8    Anti- prostate cancer effect of pSLC-3P-Fc chemokine antigen gene vaccine in vivo<br>
5xl04B16-3P cancer cells (pcDNA-3P transfected B16 cancer cells by G418 selection) were inoculated on the flank of C57BL/6 mice (eight mice each group). The mice were immunized on third, eighth and thirteen day after tumor cell inoculation. The control vector, pSLC-Fc, psig-3P (the plasmid containing with a SLC signal peptide gene upstream to 3P gene) were used as control groups. The tumor sizes and survival periods of mice were observed.<br>
Result:  As shown in Figure 13 and 14, the chemokine antigen gene vaccine<br>
(pSLC-3P-Fc) significantly inhibits the tumor growth (vs control groups P
significantly prolongs the survival period (vs control groups P
change of the antigen in the chemotactic antigen gene vaccine can produce different<br>
