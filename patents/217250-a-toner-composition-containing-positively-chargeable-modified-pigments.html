				<td>TONERS CONTAINING POSITIVELY CHARGE<br>
      BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to toner and developer compositions containing positively chargeable modified pigments. DISCUSSTON OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Electrophotographic processes and image-forming apparatus are widespread nowadays. Particularly, aspects of the xerographic process are set forth in R.M. Schaffert "Electrography", the Focal Press, London &amp; N.Y., enlarged and revised edition, 1975. In electrophotography, an image comprising an electrostatic field pattern (also .referred to as an electrostatic latent image), usually of nonuniform strength, is formed on an insulative surface of an electrophotographic element. The insulative surface comprises a photoconductive layer and an electrically conductive substrate. The electrostatic latent image may be formed by imagewisc photo-induced dissipation of the strength of portions of an electrostatic field of uniform strength previously formed on the insulative surface. Typically, the electrostatic latent image is then visualized by contacting the latent image with an oppositely charged toner powder generally containing a colorant. This process of visualization of a latent image is known as development, and the composition containing the dry toner powder is known as the developer. The toned image is then transferred onto a transfer medium such as paper and fixed thereon by<br><br>
Development of a latent electrostatic image requires that a charge be developed on the toner particles prior to their deposition on the latent image, and that this charge be opposite to the charge of the latent image. All components of a toner, including binder resin, colorants, charge control agents, waxes and the like, can influence the development of charge on the toner particles. The influence of the colorants on the charging behavior of toner compositions is seldom considered, as there are few known methods to change and control the natural charging behavior of colorants such as carbon black. Thus an unmet need in dry toner technology is for pigments which have certain unique and predictable tribocharging properties.<br>
One approach to meeting this need is to surface-modify known pigments to enhance or change their natural tribocharging properties. For example, Japanese Patent Application Hei 311991]-197961 relates to surface treatment of carbon blacks with amine-funciional silane coupling agents which can, to some extent, overcome the natural tendency of carbon blacks to tribocharge negatively, which makes the carbon blacks more useful as pigments in positive-charging toners. However, it is believed that for such treatments to be effective, the silane coupling agents must form a covalent bond to the surface of the carbon black. The chemical groups believed to be present on the surface of normal carbon black are oxygen-containing groups. Silane coupling agents can form covalent bonds with these groups. Such groups are normally present on the surface of carbon black at low and poorly-controlled levels, making such treatment with silane coupling agents of limited scope and value.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A feature of the present invention is to provide alternative additives which impart or assist in imparting a positive charge to the toner particles in toner and developer compositions.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is to provide a colorant for use in toner and developer compositions.<br>
Additional features and advantages of the present invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the present invention. The objectives and other advantages of the present invention will be realized and attained by means of Ihe elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the written description and appended claims.<br>
To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the present invention, as embodied and broadly described herein, the present invention relates to a"toner composition which includes styrenic polymer-based resin particles and modified pigment particles which have at least one organic group attached to the pigment particles, wherein the organic group is positively chargeable.<br>
The present invention also relates to a developer composition which includes carrier particles and the toner composition described above.<br>
In addition, the present invention further relates to a method of imaging which includes the steps of formulating an electrostatic latent image on a negatively charged photoconductive imaging member, effecting the development thereof with a toner composition which includes styrenic polymer-based resin particles and modified pigment particles having attached an organic group that is positively chargeable, and thereafter transferring the developed image onto a suitable substrate.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to toner and developer compositions which include modified pigment particles having atlached at least one organic group that is positively chargeable, and styrenic polymer-based resin particles.<br>
The pigment particles that are modified can be carbon black, cyan, magenta, yellow, blue, green, brown, violet, red, or mixtures thereof. Suitable pigments are pigment particles capable of being modified with attachment of at least one organic group that is positively chargeable. Carbon black is the preferred pigment and examples include, but are not limited to, commercially available forms of carbon black, such as Regal® carbon black from Cabot Corporation. Pigments which may be capable of being modified are described, for instance, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,484,675; 5,571,654;<br><br>
5,275,900; and EP 0 723 206 Al, all incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
As the pigment for black toner compositions, carbon black pigments alone or in combination with blue, green, magnetite or black dyes can be used.<br>
The modified pigment has at least one organic group attached to the pigment particles and the organic group is positively chargeable. The organic group can be attached to the pigment in varying amounts, i.e., low to high amounts, thus allowing fine control over charge modification. The organic group that is attached to the pigment particles can be any group which permits the modified pigment to be positively chargeable once incorporated into the toner or developer composition. Preferably, the organic group comprises an aromatic group or a C1-C20 alkyl group, wherein either group can be substituted or unsubslituted. It is also preferred that the aromatic group or C1-C20 alkyl group is directly attached to the pigment particles. Preferred groups of positively chargeable organic groups are nitrogen containing or phosphorus containing organic groups.<br>
Preferred positive chargeable organic groups have the general structures:<br><br>
wherein Q represents the elements nitrogen or phosphorus; X represents a counterion such as NO,", Cl", Br", ArSCV, CoCl4, benzoate, and the like - or can be a counterion described in U.S. Patent No. 5,645,967, incorporated in its entirety herein by reference; R1 represents an alkylene group or an arylene group attached to the pigment; and R2, R3, and R4. which may be the same or different, each represent an alkyl group or an aryl<br><br>
group. Two or more of the R groups can form one or more aliphatic and/or aromatic ringfs), such as QR2R3R4 can form a pyridinium structure and R, can be phenylcne. The ring can include one or more hetero elements. Preferably, the alkylene or alkyl group is a C1-C10 alkylene or alkyl group and the arylene or aryl group is a C6-C20 arylene or aryl group. For the purposes of this invention, aryl and arylene groups include hetemaryl and heteroarylene groups, respectively.<br>
Other preferred organic groups that can be attached to the pigment particles include, but are not limited to the following:<br><br><br><br><br><br>
in which Ar represents an aromatic group and Ar1 represents ait aromatic group. The aromatic group includes, but is not limited to, unsaturated cyclic hydrocarbons containing one or more rings. The aromatic group may be substituted or unsubsrituted. Aromatic groups include aryl groups {forexample, phenyl, naphthyl, anthracenyl, and the like), and heteroaryl groups (imidazolyl, pyrazolyl, pyridinyl, thienyl, thiazolyl, furyl, iriazinyl, indolyl, and the lite).<br><br>
A combination of organic groups such as an organic group comprising a pyridyl group and an organic group comprising a quaternary ammonium group can be used.<br>
As described earlier, one or more organic groups can be attached lo the pigment. Also, a modified pigment with untreated pigments), such as conventional carbon black, can be used in the toner composition.   Further, two or more modified pigments, each having a different organic group attached to the pigment, can be used. In addition, any combination of the above can be used in the toner compositions of the present invention.<br>
As shown in the examples, various loading levels of the pigment and treatment levels can be used. Certain modified pigments are preferably used at lower levels, while other modified pigments are preferably used at higher levels in the toner compositions.<br>
The following discussion is with reference to the modification of the preferred pigment, carbon black. However, modified pigments other than carbon black can be similarly prepared. The modified carbon black may be prepared preferably by reacting carbon with a diazonium salt in a liquid reaction medium to attach at least one organic group to the surface of the carbon. The diazonium salt may contain the organic group to be attached to the carbon. A diazonium salt is an organic compound having one or more diazonium groups. Preferred reaction media include water, any medium containing water, and any medium containing alcohol. Water is the most preferred medium. Examples of modified carbon black and various preferred methods for their preparation are described in U.S. patent application serial no. 08/356,660 entitled "Reaction of Carbon Black with Diazonium Salts, Resultant Carbon Black Products and Their Uses," filed December 15, 1994 and its continuation-in-part application, U.S. patent application serial no. 08/572,525, filed December 14, 1995, U.S. Patent No. 5,554,739 entitled<br><br>
"Reaction of Carbon Materials With Diazonium Salts and Resultant Carbon Products " WO 96/18696 and WO 96/18688, all incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In the preferred preparation of the above modified carbon black, the diazonium salt need only be sufficiently stable to allow reaction with the carbon. Thus, that reaction can be carried out with some diazonium salts otherwise considered to be unstable and subject to decomposition. Some decomposition processes may compete with the reaction between the carbon and the diazonium salt and may reduce the total number of organic groups attached to the carbon. Further, the reaction may be carried out at elevated temperatures where many diazonium salts may be susceptible to decomposition. Elevated temperatures may also advantageously increase the solubility of the diazonium salt in the reaction medium and improve its handling during the process. However, elevated temperatures may result in some loss of the diazonium salt due to other decomposition processes. The diazonium salts may be prepared insim. It is preferred that the modified carbon black of the present invention contain no by-products or unattached salts.<br>
With respect to suitable toner resins for use in the toner and developer compositions of the present invention, a styrenic polymer-based is used, such as a styrenated acrylic resin. Examples of preferred styrenic polymer-based resins include, but are not limited to, homopolymers and copolymers of styrene and its derivatives such as: polystyrene; poly-p-cholorostyrene; polyvinyltoluene; styrene-p-chlorostyrene copolymer; and styrenc-vinyltoluene copolymer; copolymers of styrene and acrylic acid esters such as: styrencmethylacrylate copolymer; styrene-ethylacrylate copolymer; and styrene-n-butyl acrylate copolymer, copolymers of styrene and methacrylic acid esters such as: sryrenc-methyl methacrylate copolymer; styrene-cthyl methaciylate copolymer; sryrene-n-butyi methacrylate copolymer; and multi-component copolymers of styrene, acrylic acid<br><br>
ester and methacrylic acid esters; copolymers of styrenc and other vinyl monomers such<br>
as: styrene-acrylonitrile copolymer, styrene-methyl ether copolymer; styrene-butadienee copolymer; sryrene-vjnyl methyl ketone copolymer; styrene-acrylonitriteindenc copolymer; styrene maleic acid ester copolymer; and the like. These binder resins may be used singly or in combination. Generally, resins particularly suitable for use in xerographic toner manufacturing have a melting point (ring and ball method) in the range of 100°C to 135°C and have a glass transition temperature (Tg) greater than about 60°C. Examples of styrenic polymer-based resin particles and suitable amounts can also be found in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,278,018; 5,510,221; 5,275,900; 5,571,654; 5,484,575; and EP 0 270 066 Al, all incorporated in their entirety by reference herein.<br>
Generally, the modified pigment of the present invention, alone or with other pigments, is present in total amounts of from about 1% by weight to about 30% by weight of the toner or developer composition. The amount of pigment present in the toner composition is preferably from about 0,1 to about 12 wt parts per 100 wt parts of resin. However, lesser or greater amounts of the modified pigment may be used. Also, generally, the toner resin is present in amounts of from about 60% by weight to about 99% by weight of the toner or developer composition.<br>
Optional external additives may also be mixed or blended with the toner compositions of the present invention including carrier additives; additional positive or negative charge controlling agents such as quaternary ammonium salts, pyridinum salts, sulfates, phosphates, and carboxylates; flow aid additives; silicone oils; waxes such as commercially available polypropylenes and polyethylenes; magnetite; and other known additives. Generally, these additives arc present In amounts of from about 0.05% by weight to about 30% by weight, however, lesser or greater amounts of the additives may<br><br>
be selected depending on the particular system and desired properties. Specific examples of additives and amounts are also described in the patents and the European patent application mentioned above and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The toner compositions can be prepared by a number of known methods, such as admixing and heating the resin, the modified pigment particles, optional charge enhancing additives and other additives in conventional melt extrusion devices and related equipment. Other methods include spray drying and the like. Compounding of the modified pigment and other ingredients with the resin is generally followed by mechanical attrition and classification to provide toner particles having a desired particle size and particle size distribution. Conventional equipment for dry blending of powders may be used for mixing or blending the modified pigment particles with the resin. Again, conventional methods of preparing toner and developer compositions can be used and arc described in the patents and European application described above and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In more detail, the toner material can be prepared by dry blending the binder resin with all other ingredients, including the pigment, and then melt-extruding in a high shear mixer to form a homogeneously mixed mass. During this process the components are held at a temperature above the melting point of the binder resin, and those components that are insoluble in the resin arc ground so that their average particle si2c is reduced. This homogeneously mixed mass is then allowed to cool and solidify, after which it is pre-ground to an average particle size of about 100 microns. This material is then further subjected to particle size reduction until its average particle size meets the size range specification required for classification. A variety of classifying techniques may be used. The preferred type is an air classification type. By this method, particles in the ground<br><br>
material which arc too large or too small are segregated from the portion of the material<br>
which is of the desired particle size range.<br>
The toner composition of the present invention may be used alone in monocomponcnt developers or may be mixed with suitable carrier particles to form dual component developers. The carrier vehicles which can be used to form dual component developer compositions can be selected from various materials. Such materials typically include carrier core particles and core particles overcoated with a thin layer of film-forming resin to help establish the correct triboelectric relationship and charge level with the toner employed. Suitable carriers for two component toner compositions include iron powder, glass beads, crystals of inorganic salts, ferrite powder, nickel powder, all of which are typically coated with resin coating such as an epoxy or fluorocarbon resin. Examples of carrier particles and coatings that can be used and are described in the patents and European application described above and incorporated herein by reference.<br>
, The present invention is further directed to a method of imaging which includes formulating an electrostatic latent image on a negatively charged photoconductive imaging member, affecting the development thereof with toner composition comprising resin particles and modified pigment particles, and thereafter transferring the developed image onto a suitable substrate. Conventional methods of imaging can be used, such as shown in the patents and European patent application described above.<br>
The present invention will be further clarified by the following examples which are intended to be purely exemplary of the present invention.<br><br>

Example 3 J Preparation and evaluation of a toner<br>
The carbon black product of Example 6 was incorporated into a pseudo toner<br>
and evaluated using the method of Example 4. After rolling for 60 minutes with a<br>
positive carrier, a toner incorporating the carbon black product of Example 6 had a<br>
tribocharge of 16 µC/g. A control toner that had Regal 330 carbon black<br>
incorporated in it gave a tribocharge of 1 µC/g against the same carrier.<br>
Example 12 Preparation and evaluation of Toner.1;<br>
Black toners were prepared by the conventional technique of melt-mixing, extruding, pregrinding, jetmilling and classifying. Thus, 8 parts of carbon black and 92 parts of Dialec 1601 styrenated acrylic polymer were melt extruded with a Werner and Pfleidercr ZSK-30 twin screw extruder. The resulting black/polymer product was granulated in a Kayncss mini granulator, and then jermiJled and classified using a Hosokawa Alpine AFG Model 100 mill to form a black toner powder having an average particle- size of about 8 microns, as determined using a Coulter Multisizer II<br>
Developer compositions were prepared by mixing the toner composition with a positive charging (Type 13) carrier available from Vertex in an amount sufficient to yield a 2.0 wt% loading. Tribocharge measurements were made by tumble blending the developer compositions (toner plus carrier) in glass vessels on a roll mill. After blending for 60 minutes, a small sample of the developer composition was removed and its charge to mass ratio (Q/M) was determined by the Faraday cage blow off<br><br>
method using a Vertex T-150 tribocharge tester. The results shown below indicate that the samples charged more positively than the control.<br><br>
Example 13 Preparation and evaluation of toners<br>
The carbon black product of Example 9 and Regal 330 carbon black were incorporated into toners using the method of Example 12 using blends of the two carbons. The total carbon content was 4 parts and the resin coutent was 96 parts. These results show that the toners containing the carbon black product of Example 9 charged more positively than the toner containing only the control black.<br><br>
Example.14 Preparation of a carbon black product<br>
Silver nitrite (7,7 parts) was added to a solution of 13,9 parts of 4-aminophenyltri methyl-ammonium iodide in 40 parts of water.  After stirring for three hours, the mixture was filtered and the precipitate was washed with 60 parts of<br><br>
water. The liquids were combined to give a solution of 4-arninophenyltrimethylammonium nitrite.<br>
A pelletizer was charged with 500 parts of a carbon black with a surface area<br>
of 94 m3/g and a DBPA of 65 mL/100g and 5.6 parts of phenylenediamine. The pelletizer was run at about 400 rpm for about 30 sec. The 4-aminophenyltrimethyiamrnonium nitrite solution was added while the pelletizer was mixing, and mixing was continued for two minutes at 400 rpm. The pelletizer speed was increased to 700 rpm, and a solution of 9.1 parts concentrated HNO3 in 75 parts water, 30 parts water, a solution of 3.6 parts NaNO2 in 75 parts water, and then 30 parts water were added successively with two minutes following each addition. The resulting product was dried under vacuum at 55 "C. The product had attached CSH,NR: and C^NCCHOJ* NO; groups.<br>
The carbon black product of this Example was incorporated into a pseudo loner and evaluated using the method of Example 4. After rolling for 60 minutes with a positive carrier, a toner incorporating the carbon black product of this Example had a tribocharge of 2 ^C/g. A control toner that had Regal 330 carbon black incorporated in it gave a tribocharge of 1 pC/g against the same carrier.<br>
