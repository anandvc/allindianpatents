				<td>The present invention relates to a formulation useful as an extreme pressure, antiwear and antifriction additive for industrial gear oils.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a formulation consisting of sulfurised derivatives of Neem Oil and phosphosulfurised derivatives of hydrogenated cardanols with low corrosivity to copper which in a synergistic combination with dibenzyl di sulfide gives energy efficient industrial gear oils meeting U.S. Steel 224 specifications<br>
	""    '     ^<br>
when blended in SAE-90 gear lubricant base stock.<br>
The additive formulation of the present invention in 3-6% concentration in SAE-90 gear<br>
lubricant base stock gives welding load more than 300 Kg., wear scar diameters less than<br>
0.4mm and co-efficient of friction less than 0.085, passes 12th stage of FZG gear rating<br>
without scoring and Timken O.K load more than 45 Kg.   The copper corrosion at 4%<br>
concentration is in the range of 1 at 100°C for 3 hours without the addition of metal<br>
passivators.<br>
Organic sulfides, sulfurised fatty oils, sulfurised defines and alkyl aryl phosphorothibates<br>
as a class of compounds whether alone or in admixtures with each other are being<br>
extensively employed as extreme pressure (e.p.^ antiwear and antifriction additives.<br>
Extensive published information, papers and patents is available on the mode and<br>
mechanism of action of these additives and formulations for various types of gear oils and<br>
metal working oils over past thirty years.	•<br>
The currently markete commercial formulations of additives for industrial as well as<br><br>
automotive gear oils mainly contain sulfurised defines, fatty esters and alkyl phosphorothioates. Some recent formulations contain small quantities of molybdenum derivatives also such as in energy efficient low friction gear oils.<br><br>
But none of the formulations have so far used sulfurised non traditional vegetable oils<br>
and phosphosulfurised naturally occuring alkyl phenols as additive components and<br>
formulations   for  energy   efficient   industrial   gear   oils   which   meet   performance<br>
requirements of U.S Steel 224 specifications.<br>
'Most of the sulfurised olefines and alkyl aryl phosphorothioates used in e.p. formulations<br>
have relatively high toxicity and low biodegradability. These products usually have high<br>
corrosivity towards copper which is supressed by use of metal passivators which in turn<br>
depress  their performance  characteristics  too.     The  wear  and  extreme  pressure<br>
characteristics are satisfactory but the friction co-efficients usually are not reduced which<br>
cause higher energy cosnumption.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful as an extreme<br>
pressure, antiwear and antifriction additive for industrial gear oils which obviates the<br>
draw backs as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to use sulfurised and phosphosulfurised<br>
derivatives of non traditional vegetable oils and naturally occuring alkyl phenols as<br>
extreme pressure, antiwear and antifriction additives.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful as an<br>
additive for energy efficient industrial gear oils which meet performance characteristics<br>
of US Steel 224 specifications and the additive formulation can also be used for GL-5<br>
type of energy efficient automotive gear oils.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful as a gear oil<br>
additive consisting of sulfurised non traditional vegetable oils such as mohwa oil, neem<br><br>
oil, karanja oil prepared by the process as described and claimed in our copending patent<br>
application no.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a formulation useful as a gear oil<br>
additive consisting of phosphosulfurised hydrogenated cardanol prepared by the process<br>
as described and claimed in our copending patent application no. ,<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a formulation useful as an extreme pressure,<br>
antiwear and antifriction additive for industrial gear oils which comprises :<br>
i)         0.25 to 0.5% by weight of sulfurised non traditional vegetable oils such as neem<br>
oil, mohwa oil and karanja oil;<br>
ii)        0.25 to 0.5% by weight of phosphosulfurised hydrogenated cardanol; iii)       0.25 to 0.5% of dibenzyl disulfide 0.25 - 0.5% by weight. The sulfurised non traditional vegetable oil used may be such as sulfurised neem oil, mohwa oil, karanja oil prepared by a process as described and claimed our patent application number: .<br>
The phosphosulfurised hydrogenated cardanol used may be prepared by a process ^described and claimed in our patent application number: The dibenzyl disulfide used may be such that copper corrosion rating is not more than Ib at 100°C for 3 hours and sulfur content is not less than 25 percent by weight. The individual components of the formulation of the present invention is not a mere admixture but a blend having synergistic properties which are not a mere aggregation of the individual properties but results in a synergistic composition having properties different from that of the aggregated properties of the individual components.<br>
The characteristics of the formulation of the present invention, when blended in SAE-90<br>
gear lubricant base stock and evaluated for performance is as follows:<br>
Weld load	:	300 - 450 Kg.<br>
Mean Hertz Load	:	71-105<br>
Wear Scar dia mm.	:	0.3 - 0.4<br>
Co-efficient of friction	:	0.09-0.08<br>

Sulfur content in the blend     :	0.5-1.00%<br>
due to additive components<br>
Phosphorus content in the      :	0.05 - 0.1%<br>
blend	~~""~<br>
me louowing examples are given by way of illustration and should not be construed as a limitation to the present invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
1.4 gm of powdered dibenzyl disulfide, sulfur content 25% by weight, is added to 0.875 gm. of the sulfurised neem oil, sulfur content 13% by weight, and stirred into a thick paste to which is added 1.225gm. of phospho sulfurised hydrogenated cardanol, sulfur content 9% by weight, phosphorus content 4% by weight. The contents are heated to 80°C with stirring and 96.5 gm. Of SAE-90 lubricant base stock is added to it. The mixture is stirred for one hour till it becomes completely homogenous. It is allowed to stand for two hours to ensure that it remains homogenous. The sample is taken in a tube in which a freshly polished copper strip is dipped and at 120°C for 3 hours.

succesive stage till the scoring was observed on the gear teath. The following results are<br>
obtained.<br>
Welding Load	400 kg.<br>
Mean Hertz Load	105 kg.<br>
Wear Scar diameter	0.344 mm.<br>
Co-efficient of friction	0.086<br>

The contents are mixed by vigrous stirring at 80°C and 95 gm of SAE 90 lubricating oil became completely homogenous. The blend was kept for two hours in order to ensure that it remained homogenous. 1000 gm of the sample is prepared with the above composition for performance characteristics as discussed in example 1.

The main advantages of the additive composition of the present invention are :<br>
1.	The composition leads to development of high performance energy efficient e.p.<br>
additive from naturally occuring starting materials from renewable resources<br>
which are cheaply priced.<br>
2.	The composition produced possess outstanding load carrying properties as well as<br>
lubricity characteristics such as low wear and lower friction as compared to many<br>
other commercial formulations.<br>
3.	The formulation has components which have higher biodegradability and lower<br>
toxicity than most of the components used currently.<br>
4.	The formulation shows better performance than most other additive formulations<br>
because it does not require any metal passivators which reduce the efficacy of e.p.<br>
additives.<br>
5.	The co-efficient of friction is reduced 1.4 times and weld load is increased by 2.7<br>
times, wear scar diameter reduced 2.2 and anti scuffing properties as reflected by<br>
FZG gear rating increased by several stages as compared to base oil alone<br>
at 0.75% sulfur and 0.1% P concentration.<br><br><br><br>
