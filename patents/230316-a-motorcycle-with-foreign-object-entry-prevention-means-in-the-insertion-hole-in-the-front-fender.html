[Patent Document 1]<br>
Japanese Utility Model Laid-open No. Sho 58-60588 [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problem to be Solved by the Invention] [0003]<br>
In the prior art arrangement, entry of a stone or the like in the insertion hole is prevented by plugging the insertion hole with the cover from above. The cover is, however, separated from the front fender and the front fork. This results in the number of man-hours required for assembly as well as the number of parts used being increased. [0004]<br>
The present invention has been made to solve these problems of the prior art.  It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a motorcycle that prevents entry of foreign objects in the insertion hole in the front fender as much as possible with the number of parts used being reduced and enhances assemblability. [Means for Solving the Problem] <br>
[0005]<br>
To achieve the foregoing object, the present<br>
3<br>
invention as set forth in claim 1 provides a motorcycle including: a head pipe disposed at a front end of a vehicle body frame and covered with a front cover; a steering stem passed through the head pipe; a front fork having a pair of right and left leg portions continuing into a lower portion of the steering stem and journaling a front wheel across lower end portions thereof, the front fork being steerably supported by the head pipe; and a front fender having a ceiling portion including an insertion hole, through which the steering stem is passed, and covering the front wheel and the leg portions from above, the front fender being mounted on the front fork. The motorcycle is characterized in that a wall portion enclosing at least part of the insertion hole is integrated with an upper surface of the ceiling portion of the front fender in a protruding condition. The motorcycle is also characterized in that a vehicle part, part of which overlaps the wall portion in a top view, is fixedly disposed inside the front cover. [0006]<br>
The present invention as set forth in claim 2 is characterized in that, in addition to the arrangements of the invention as set forth in claim 1, turning range restriction means for restricting a range of rotation of<br>
4 <br>
the front fork relative to the head pipe is disposed so as to face the insertion hole at a front half portion of the insertion hole, and the wall portion is disposed so as to enclose the front half portion of the insertion hole.<br>
[0007]<br>
The present invention as set forth in claim 3 is characterized in that, in addition to the arrangements of the invention as set forth in claim 1 or 2, the vehicle part includes a battery.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
[0008]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle as set forth in claim 1 of the present invention, entry of foreign objects into the insertion hole can be prevented as much as possible by the wall portion that is integrated with the upper surface of the ceiling portion of the front fender and that surrounds at least part of the insertion hole and the vehicle part that is disposed inside the front cover such that part thereof overlaps the wall portion in top view. A structure for preventing entry of foreign objects into the insertion hole can thus be achieved with a small number of parts used. Reduction in the number of parts used, in turn, reduces the number of<br>
5 <br>
man-hours required for assembly. Moreover, the aforementioned arrangements allow the front wheel, the front fork, and the front fender to be assembled together into a sub-assembly so that the sub-assembly can be mounted on the side of the vehicle body frame at a factory assembly line. This leads to an improved assemblability.<br>
[0009]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle as set forth in claim 2 of the present invention, entry of foreign objects in the turning range restriction means can be prevented even more effectively with a small number of parts used. <br>
[0010]<br>
In accordance with the motorcycle as set forth in claim 3 of the present invention, disposition of the battery having a relatively large width in a position upward of the insertion hole makes it possible to prevent entry of foreign objects in the insertion hole even more effectively.<br>
[Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention] <br>

mounted to a rear portion of the side cover 21.<br>
[0018]<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, the front fork 6 includes a pair of right and left leg portions 30, 3 0, a bridge portion 31, and a steering stem 32. The leg portions 30, 30, disposed on both sides of the front wheel WF, journal the front wheel WF on lower ends thereof. The bridge portion 31 connects upper ends of the leg portions 30, 30. The steering stem 32 extends upwardly from a central portion of the bridge portion 31. The steering stem 3 2 is passed through, and supported steerably by, the head pipe 8. Further, the steering handlebar 7 is connected to an upper end portion of the steering stem 32.<br>
[0019]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 4, a ceiling portion 24a of the front fender 24 for covering the two leg portions 30, 3 0 of the front fork 6 and the front wheel WF is formed into a flat surface mildly inclined downwardly toward the rear. The ceiling portion 24a thus shaped helps enlarge an upward space of the front fender 24 inside the front cover 18, thereby making it easier to dispose vehicle parts and increasing the degree of freedom in design.<br>
10<br><br>
[0020]<br>
The ceiling portion 24a of the front fender 24 includes an insertion hole 33, through which the steering stem 32 is passed. A support plate 34 extending forwardly is fixedly attached to a central portion of the bridge portion 31 in the front fork 6. There is installed a bolt 35 that is passed through the ceiling portion 24a from above at a position forward of the insertion hole 33. The bolt 35 is to be screwed to a weld nut 3 6 fixedly attached to a bottom surface of the support plate 34. Tightening the bolt 35 will secure the front fender 24 to the front fork 6.<br>
[0021]<br>
A wall portion 37 is integrally provided in a protruding condition on an upper surface of the ceiling portion 24a of the front fender 24. The wall portion 37 surrounds at least part of the insertion hole 33.  In accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the wall portion 37 is disposed so as to surround a front half portion of the insertion hole 33.<br>
[0022]<br>
The front half portion of the insertion hole 33 includes turning range restriction means 3 8 disposed so as to face the insertion hole 33. The turning range<br>
11<br><br>
restriction means 38 restrict a range of rotation of the front fork 6 relative to the head pipe 8 to, for example, 43 degrees- The turning range restriction means 3 8 include a protrusion 39 and restriction surfaces 40, 40. The protrusion 39, fixedly mounted to a front surface on a lower end of the head pipe 8, protrudes forwardly.  The restriction surfaces 40, 40 are disposed on both sides of the protrusion 39 in the first half portion of the insertion hole 33. The restriction surfaces 40, 40 are formed into a semi-circular shape so as to enclose a rearward side of the head pipe 8. The restriction surfaces 40, 40 are disposed on both ends of a protruding portion 31a provided in a protruding condition from an upper end of the bridge 31 in the front fork 6. The restriction surfaces 40, 4 0 abut against the protrusion 39 to restrict the range of rotation of the front fork 6 relative to the head pipe 8. <br>
[023]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 5, a battery 41 as a vehicle part is fixedly disposed inside the front cover 18. The battery 41 is disposed such that part thereof overlaps a whole of the wall portion 37 in top view. A lower portion of the battery 41 is accommodated in a box 42 made of a synthetic resin having an open upper end. A<br>
12<br><br>
portion of the battery 41 protruding from the box 42 is covered with a lid portion member 4 3 made of a synthetic resin. The box 42 is positioned and accommodated in a storage case 44 formed of a metal plate. A holding member 45 formed of a metal plate and abutting on the lid portion member 43 from above is removable mounted on the storage case 44 so as to abut on the lid portion member 43 from above. <br>
[0024]<br>
A lower portion bracket 46 and an upper portion bracket 47 are fixedly attached on a front surface of the head pipe 8. The lower portion bracket 46 and the upper portion bracket 4 7 are apart from each other vertically. A back surface of the storage case 44 is secured to the lower portion bracket 4 6 using a pair of right and left bolts 48... and nuts 49... and to the upper portion bracket 47 using a single bolt 50 and a weld nut 51. <br>
[0025]<br>
An engagement tab portion 44b is disposed on an upper end portion at a center in the rear of the storage case 44. This engagement tab portion 44b is engaged with an engagement hole 54 disposed at a rear end portion of the holding member 45. A front end portion of the<br>
13<br><br>
holding member 45 is removably secured to a mounting plate portion 44a integrated with an upper end portion at a center and the front of the storage case 44 by means of a bolt 52 and a weld nut 53 fixedly attached to the mounting plate portion 44a. <br>
[0026]<br>
A bracket 55 protruding forwardly is fixedly attached to a front surface of the storage case 44. A grommet 56 is fitted to this bracket 55.  Integrated with the front cover 18 in a protruding condition, a support protruding portion 18a protrudes rearwardly from a back surface of the front cover 18. The support protruding portion 18a includes an engagement protruding portion 57 disposed at a leading end thereof. The engagement protruding portion 57 is snappingly passed through and engaged with the grommet 56. [0027]<br>
The operation of the embodiment of the present invention will be described. The ceiling portion 24a of -the front fender 24 mounted on the front fork 6 and covering the front wheel WF and the two leg portions 30, 30 of the front fork 6 includes the insertion hole 33 that allows the steering stem 32 of the front fork 6 to pass therethrough. The wall portion 3 7 that surrounds at<br>
14<br><br>
least part of the insertion hole 33 is integrated with the upper surface of the ceiling portion 24a in a protruding condition. The battery 41 disposed such that part thereof overlaps the whole of the wall portion 37 in top view is fixedly disposed inside the front cover 18.<br>
[0028]<br>
Accordingly, entry of foreign objects into the insertion hole 33 can be prevented as much as possible by the wall portion 3 7 that is integrated with the upper surface of the ceiling portion 24a of the front fender 24 and that surrounds at least part of the insertion hole 33 and the battery 41 that is disposed inside the front cover 18 such that part thereof overlaps the wall portion 37 in top view. A structure for preventing entry of foreign objects into the insertion hole 33 can thus be achieved with a small number of parts used. Reduction in the number of parts used, in turn, reduces the number of man-hours required for assembly. <br>
[0029]<br>
Moreover, the aforementioned arrangements allow the front wheel WF, the front fork 6, and the front fender 24 to be assembled together into a sub-assembly so that the sub-assembly can be mounted on the side of<br>
15<br><br>
the vehicle body frame F at a factory assembly line. <br>
This leads to an improved assemblability. <br>
[0030]<br>
In particular, disposition of the battery 41 having a relatively large width in a position upward of the insertion hole 33 makes it possible to prevent entry of foreign objects in the insertion hole 33 even more effectively.<br>
[0031]<br>
The turning range restriction means 3 8 that restrict the range of rotation of the front fork 6 relative to the head pipe 8 are disposed so as to face the insertion hole 33 at the front half portion of the insertion hole 33. The wall portion 37 is disposed so as to surround the front half portion of the insertion hole 33. These arrangements make it possible to prevent entry of foreign objects into the turning range restriction means 38 efficiently with a small number of parts used.<br>
[0032]<br>
The ceiling portion 24a of the front fender 24 is formed into a flat surface mildly inclined downwardly toward the rear. This is done to help enlarge the upward space of the front fender 24 inside the front cover 18, thereby making it easier to dispose vehicle parts and<br>
16<br><br>
increasing the degree of freedom in design. The wall portion 37 is disposed so as to enclose the front half portion of the insertion hole 33. This positively prevents entry of foreign objects into the insertion hole 33, including a bolt that may roll over the ceiling portion 24a to fall into the insertion hole 33.  If no such measures as described above are taken in the front half portion of the insertion hole 33, it is likely that a bolt or the like dropped during a service job will roll over the ceiling portion 24a to reach the insertion hole 33.<br>
[0033]<br>
The present invention has been described in its preferred form. It should be understood that the present invention is nonetheless not limited to the aforementioned embodiment and can be implemented in various manners without departing from the spirit and scope thereof as herein claimed.<br>
