UNIVATION TECHNOLOGIES LLC, a Delaware company of Suite 1950, 5555 San Felipe, Houston, Texas 77056, United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
n<br><br>
CATALYST SYSTEMS x\ND &gt;QTHEIR USE IN A POLYMERIZATION PROCESS-<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a catalyst composition including a Group 15 containing hafnium transition metal catalyst compound, to a mixed catalyst composition including the Group 15 containing hafnium transition metal catalyst compound and a bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound, to catalysts systems thereof, and to their use in olefin(s) polymerization.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Advances in polymerization and catalysis have resulted in the capability to produce many new polymers having improved physical and chemical properties useful in a wide variety of superior products and applications. With the development of new catalysts, the choice of polymerization-type (solution, slurry, high pressure or gas phase), for producing a particular polymer, has been greatly expanded. Also, advances in polymerization technology have provided more efficient, highly productive and economically enhanced processes. Especially illustrative of these advances is the development of technology utilizing bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems.<br>
More recently, developments have lead to the discovery of anionic, multidentate heteroatom ligands as discussed by the following articles: (1) Kempe et al., "Aminopyridinato Ligands - New Directions and Limitations", 80th Canadian Society for Chemistry Meeting, Windsor, Ontario, Canada, June 1-4, 1997; (2) Kempe et al., Inorg.

Furthermore, U.S. Patent No. 5,576,460 describes a preparation of arylamine ligands and U.S. Patent No. 5,889^~2Talscloses a process for the living polymerization of olefins using initiators having a metal atom and a ligand having two group 15 atoms and a group 16 atom or three group 15 atoms. EP 893 454 Al also describes preferably titanium transition metal amide compounds. In addition, U.S. Patent No. 5,318,935 discusses amido transition metal compounds and catalyst systems especially for the producing isotactic polypropylene. Polymerization catalysts containing bidentate and tridentate ligands are further discussed in U.S. Patent No. 5,506,184.<br>
Traditional bulky ligand metallocene catalyst systems produce polymers that are in some situations more difficult to process into film, for example using old extrusion equipment. One technique to improve these polymers is to blend them with other polymers with the intent to create, a blend having the desired properties that each component individually would have. While the two polymer blends tend to be more . processable, it.is expensive and adds a cumbersome blending step to the manufacturing/fabrication process.<br>
Higher molecular weight confers desirable polymer mechanical properties and stable bubble formation in the production of films. However, this property also inhibits extrusion processing by increasing backpressure in extruders, promotes melt fracture defects in the inflating bubble and potentially, promotes too high a degree of orientation in the finished film. The anionic, multidentate heteroatom containing catalyst systems tend to produce a very high molecular weight polymer. To remedy this, one may form a secondary, minor component of lower molecular weight polymer to reduce extruder backpressure and inhibit melt fracture. Several industrial processes operate on this principle using multiple reactor technology to produce a processable bimodal molecular weight distribution (MWD) high density polyethylene (HDPE) product. HIZEX™, a Mitsui Chemicals HDPE product, is considered the worldwide standard. HIZEX™ is produced in a costly two or more reactor-process. In a multiple reactor process, each reactor produces a single component of the final product.<br>
Others in the art have tried to produce two polymers together at the same time in the same reactor using two different catalysts. PCT patent application WO 99/03899 discloses using a typical bulky ligand metallocene catalyst and a conventional-type Ziegler-Natta catalyst in the same reactor to produce a bimodal polyolefm. Using two<br><br><br>
different types of catalysts, however, result in a polymer whose characteristics cannot be predicted from those of the polymers that each catalyst would produce if utilized separately. This unpredictability occurs, for example, from competition or other influence between the catalyst or catalyst systems used.<br>
Polyethylenes with a higher density and a higher molecular weight are valued in film applications requiring high stiffness, good toughness and high throughput. Such polymers are also valued in pipe applications requiring stiffness, toughness and long-term durability, and particularly resistance to environmental stress cracking.<br>
Thus, there is a desire for an improved catalyst compound and for a combination of catalysts capable of producing processable polyethylene polymers, preferably in a single reactor having desirable combinations of processing, mechanical and optical properties.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Introduction<br>
It has unexpectedly been found that the hafnium based Group 15 containing catalyst compounds exhibit a much higher catalyst productivity as compared to their zirconium or titanium analogs. As a result of this discovery it is now possible to provide a highly active polymerization with commercially acceptable level of productivity. Furthermore, it has also been discovered that these Group 15 containing hafnium catalyst compounds of the invention provide for an improved supported catalysts system, particularly for use in slurry phase or gas phase polymerizations. It is well known in the art that supporting catalyst compounds typically results in a lowering of the overall catalyst productivity. This in fact is the case with the zirconium analogs of the Group 15 containing hafnium compounds of the invention. As a result of this detrimental effect, the zirconium analogs are not well suited to being supported. However, as a result of the substantially higher activity of the hafnium based multidentate catalyst compounds of this invention, these catalysts compounds are supportable and retain commercially useful productivities. The polymer produced utilizing these Group 15 containing hafnium catalyst compounds typically have a very high molecular weight.<br>
In addition, the Group 15 containing hafnium catalystj^ompounds of the invention may be utilized in mixed catalyst systems. Preferably, these mixed systems also include a bulky ligand metallocene catalysts, which generally produce polymers having a lower molecular weight. As a result of this discovery it is now possible to provide for a mixed catalyst system iising components, each of which having a commercially acceptable level    ; of productivity, especially when used in a supported form in a slurry or gas phase polymerization process, and particularly in a continuous gas phase process. The mixed catalysts of the invention are particularly useful in producing a multimodal, especially a bimodal, polymer having a high molecular weight and a low molecular weight component.<br><br><br>

Activator and Activation Methods<br>
The above described Group 15 containing hafnium catalyst compounds and bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds are typically activated in various ways to yield catalyst compounds having a vacant coordination site that will coordinate, insert, and polymerize olefin(s).<br>
For the purposes of this patent specification and appended claims, the term "activator" is defined to be any compound or component or method which can activate any of the Group 15 containing bidentate or tridentate ligated hafnium catalyst compounds and/or the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compounds of the invention as described above. Non-limiting activators, for example may include a Lewis acid or a non-coordinating ionic activator or ionizing activator or any other compound including Lewis bases, aluminum alkyls, conventional-type cocatalysts and combinations thereof that can convert a neutral Group 15 containing hafnium catalyst compound to a catalytically active Group 15 containing hafnium cation and/or a neutral bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound to a catalytically active bulky ligand metallocene cation.

While most of the publications discussed herein refer to a bulky ligand metallocene catalyst, it contemplated that the activators and activation methods utilized for these bulky-ligand metallocene catalyst compounds are applicable to the Group 15 containing hafnium catalyst compounds of this invention.<br>
In one embodiment, an activation method using ionizing ionic compounds not containing an active proton but capable of producing both a catalyst cation and a non-coordinating anion are also contemplated, and are described in EP-A- 0 426 637, EP-A- 0 573 403 and U.S. Patent No. 5,387*568, which are all herein incorporated by reference.<br>

Combinations of activators are also contemplated by the invention, for example, alumoxanes and ionizing activators in combinations, see for example, EP-B1 0 573 120, PCT publications WO 94/07928 and WO 95/14044 and U.S. Patent Nos. 5,153,157 and 5,453,410 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference. WO 98/09996 incorporated herein by reference describes activating catalyst compounds with perchlorates, periodates and iodates including their hydrates. WO 98/30602 and WO 98/30603 incorporated by reference describe the use of lithium (2,2'-bispheriyl-ditrimethylsilicate)«4THF as an activator for a catalyst compound. WO 99/18135 incorporated herein by reference describes the use of organo-boron-aluminum activators. EP-B 1-0 781 299 describes using a silylium salt in combination with a non-coordinating compatible anion. Also, methods of activation such as using radiation (see EP-B 1-0 615 981 herein incorporated by reference), electro-chemical oxidation, and the like are also contemplated as activating methods for the purposes of rendering the neutral catalyst compound or precursor to a catalyst cation capable of polymerizing olefins. Other activators or methods for activating a catalyst compound are described in for example, U.S. Patent Nos. 5,849,852, 5,859,653 and 5,869,723 and WO 98/32775, WO 99/42467 (dioctadecylmethylammonium-bis(tris(pentafluorophenyl)borane)benzimidazolide), which are herein incorporated by reference.<br>

The Lewis acid compounds of this embodiment include those olefin catalyst activator Lewis acids based on aluminum and having at least one bulky, electron-withdrawing ancillary<br><br><br>
ligand such as the halogenated aryl ligands of tris(perfluorophenyl)borane or tris(perfluoronaphthyl)borane. These bulky ancillary ligands are those sufficient to allow the Lewis acids to function as electronically stabilizing, compatible non-coordinating anions. Stable ionic complexes are achieved when the anions will not be a suitable ligand donor to the strongly Lewis acidic cationic Group 15 containing transition metal cations used in insertion polymerization, i.e., inhibit ligand transfer that would neutralize the cations and render them inactive for polymerization. The Lewis acids fitting this description of this preferred activator, can be described by the following formula:<br>
RnAl(ArHal)3.n,	(VI)<br>
where R is a monoanionic ligand and ArHal is a halogenated C6 aromatic or higher carbon number polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon or aromatic ring assembly in which two or more rings (or fused ring systems) are joined directly to one another or together, and n = 1 to 2, preferably n=l.<br>
In another embodiment, at least one (ArHal) of formula (VI) is a halogenated C9 aromatic or higher, preferably a fluorinated naphthyl. Suitable non-limiting R ligands include: substituted or unsubstituted C, to C30 hydrocarbyl aliphatic or aromatic groups, substituted meaning that at least one hydrogen on a carbon atom is replaced with a hydrocarbyl, halide, halocarbyl, hydrocarbyl or halocarbyl substituted organometalloid, dialkylamido, alkoxy, siloxy, aryloxy, alkysulfido, arylsulfido, alkylphosphido, alkylphosphido or other anionic substituent; fluoride; bulky alkoxides, where bulky refers to C4 and higher number hydrocarbyl groups, e.g., up to about C20, such as tert-butoxide and 2,6-dimethyl-phenoxide, and 2,6-di(tert-butyl)phenoxide; -SR; -NR2&gt; an^ -PR2. where each R is independently a substituted or unsubstituted hydrocarbyl as defined above; and, C, to C30 hydrocarbyl substituted organometalloid, such as trimethylsilyl.<br>
Examples of ArHal include the phenyl, naphthyl and anthracenyl radicals of U.S. Patent No. 5,198,401 and the biphenyl radicals of WO 97/29845 when halogenated. The use of the terms halogenated or halogenation means for the purposes of this application that at least one third of hydrogen atoms on carbon atoms of the aryl-substituted aromatic ligands are replaced by halogen atoms, and more preferred that the aromatic ligands be perhalogenated. Fluorine is the most preferred halogen.<br>

A preferred methods for supporting the Group 15 metal hafnium compounds of the invention are described in U.S. Application Serial Number 09/312,878, filed May 17, 1999, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.<br>
When used in a mixed catalyst system, the Group 15 hafnium compound and the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound of the invention are combined at molar ratios of 1:1000 to 1000:1, preferably 1:99 to 99:1, preferably 10:90 to 90:10, more preferably 20:80 to 80:20, more preferably 30:70 to 70:30, more preferably 40:60 to 60:40. In one embodiment of the mixed system of the invention, particularly in a slurry polymerization process, the loading of the total of Group 15 containing hafnium compound and the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound in ummol per gram (g) of finished supported catalyst (includes the support material, the mixed catalysts and the activator) is about 40 ummol per gram, preferably about 38 ummol/g.<br>
In one embodiment, particulary in a gas phase polymerization process utilizing the mixed system of the invention, the loading of the total of Group 15 containing hafnium compound and the bulky ligand metallocene catalyst compound in ummol per gram of finished supported catalyst (includes the support material, the mixed catalysts and the activator) is less than 30 ummol per gram, preferably less than 25 uxnmol/g, more preferably less than 20 ummol/gram.<br>
In another embodiment, the R group in formula (VI) above, or ligand, may be covalently bonded to a support material, preferably a metal/metalloid oxide or polymeric support. Lewis base-containing support materials or substrates will react with the Lewis acid activators to form a support bonded Lewis acid compound, a supported activator, where one R group of RnA^ArHal^.,, is covalently bonded to the support material. For example, where the support material is silica, the Lewis base hydroxyl groups of the silica is where this method of bonding at one of the aluminum coordination sites occurs. Preferably, in this embodiment, the support material is a metal or metalloid oxide, preferably having surface hydroxyl groups exhibiting a pKa equal to or less than that observed for amorphous silica, i.e., pKa less than or equal to about 11.<br>
While not wishing to be bound to any particular theory, it is believed that the<br>
covalently bound anionic activator, the Lewis acid, is believed to form initially a dative<br>
complex'With'^	■„ -<br>
forming a formally dipolar (zwitterionic) Bronsted acid structure bound to the metal/metalloid of the metal oxide support. Thereafter, the proton of the Bronsted acid appears to protonate an R-group of the Lewis acid, abstracting it, at which time the Lewis acid becomes covalently bonded to the oxygen atom. The replacement R group of the Lewis acid then becomes R'-O-, where R' is a suitable support material or substrate, for<br>
-23<br><br>
example, silica or hydroxyl group-containing polymeric support. Any support material that contain surface hydroxyl groups are suitable for use in this particular supporting method. Other support material include glass beads.<br>
In this embodiment, where the support material is a metal oxide composition, these compositions may additionally contain oxides of other metals, such as those of Al, K, Mg, Na, Si, Ti and Zr and should preferably be treated by thermal and/or chemical means to remove water and free oxygen. Typically such treatment is in a vacuum in a heated oven, in a heated fluidized bed or with dehydrating agents such as organo silanes, siloxanes, alkyl aluminum compounds, etc. The level of treatment should be such that as much retained moisture and oxygen as is possible is removed, but that a chemically significant amount of hydroxyl functionality is retained. Thus calcining at up to 800 °C or more up to a point prior to decomposition of the support material, for several hours is permissible, and if higher loading of supported anionic activator is desired, lower calcining temperatures for lesser times will be suitable. Where the metal oxide is silica, loadings to achieve from less than 0.1 mmol to 3.0 mmol activator/g S1O2 are typically suitable and can be achieved, for example, by varying the temperature of calcining from 200 to 800+ °C. See Zhuralev, et al, Langmuir 1987, Vol. 3,316 where correlation between calcining temperature and times and hydroxyl contents of silica's of varying surface areas is described.<br>
The tailoring of hydroxyl groups available as attachment sites can also be accomplished by the pre-treatment, prior to addition of the Lewis acid, with a less than stoichiometric amount of the chemical dehydrating agents. Preferably those used will be used sparingly and will be those having a single ligand reactive with the silanol groups (e.g., (CH3)3SiCl), or otherwise hydrolyzable, so as to minimize interference with the reaction of the transition metal.catalyst compounds with the bound activator. If calcining temperatures below 400 °C are employed, difunctional coupling agents (e.g., (CH3)2SiCl2) niay be employed to cap hydrogen bonded pairs of silanol groups which are present under the less severe calcining conditions. See for example, "Investigation of Quantitative SiOH Determination by the Silane Treatment of Disperse Silica", Gorski, et al, Journ. of Colloid and Interface Science, Vol. 126, No. 2, Dec. 1988, for discussion of 'm^ effect of Siiatie^<br>
modification of silanol groups on the catalyst supports of this invention. Similarly, use of<br>
the Lewis acid in excess of the stoichiometric	eded for reaction with the<br>
transition metal compounds will serve to neutralize excess silanol groups without significant detrimental effect for catalyst preparation or subsequent polymerization.<br>

Polymeric supports are preferably hydroxyl-functional-group-containing polymeric substrates, but functional groups may be any of the primary alkyl amines, secondary alkyl amines, iand others, where the groups are structurally incorporated in a polymeric chain and capable of a acid-base reaction with the Lewis acid such that a ligand filling one coordination site of the aluminum is protonated and replaced by the polymer incorporated functionality. See, for example, the functional group containing polymers of U.S. Patent No. 5,288,677, which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>

The prepolymerization can be carried out batchwise or continuously in gas, solution or slurry phase including at elevated pressures. The prepolymerization can take place with any olefin monomer or combination and/or in the presence of any molecular weight controlling agent such as hydrogen. For examples of prepolymerization procedures, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,748,221, 4,789,359, 4,923,833, 4,921,825, 5,283,278 and 5,705,578 and European publication EP-B-0279 863 and PCT Publication WO 97/44371 all of which are herein fully incorporated by reference.<br>
Polymerization Process<br>
The catalyst systems, supported catalyst systems or compositions of the invention described above are suitable for use in any prepolymerization and/or polymerization process over a wide range of temperatures and pressures. The temperatures may be in the range of from -60°C to about 280°C, preferably from 50°C to about 200°C, and the pressures employed may be in the range from 1 atmosphere to about 500 atmospheres or higher.<br>
Polymerization processes include solution, gas phase, slurry phase and a high ■ ^res'sure'proctSss'6'r ^ phase polymerization of one or more olefins at least one of which is ethylene or propylene.<br>
In one embodiment, the process of this invention is directed toward a solution, high pressure, slurry or gas phase polymerization process of one or more olefin monomers having from 2 to 30 carbon atoms, preferably 2 to 12 carbon atoms, and more preferably 2 to 8 carbon atoms. The invention is particularly well suited to the polymerization of two<br>
25<br><br>
or more olefin monomers of ethylene, propylene, butene-1, pentene-1, 4-methyl-pentene-l, hexene-1, octene-1 and decene-1.<br>

In another embodiment of the process of the invention, ethylene or propylene is polymerized with at least two different comonomers, optionally one of which may be a diene, to form a terpolymer.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention is directed to a polymerization process, particularly a gas phase or slurry phase process, for polymerizing propylene alone or with one or more other monomers including ethylene, and/or other olefins having from 4 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
Typically in a gas phase polymerization process a continuous cycle is employed where in one part of the cycle of a reactor system, a cycling gas stream, otherwise known as a recycle stream or fluidizing medium, is heated in the reactor by the heat of polymerization. This heat is removed from the recycle composition in another part of the cycle by a cooling system external to the reactor. Generally, in a gas fluidized bed process for producing polymers, a gaseous stream containing one or more monomers is continuously cycled through a fluidized bed in the presence of a catalyst under reactive conditions. The gaseous stream is withdrawn from the fluidized bed and recycled back into the reactor. Simultaneously, polymer product is withdrawn from the reactor and fresh monomer is added to replace the polymerized monomer. (See for example U.S. Patent Nos. 4,543,399, 4,588,790, 5,028,670, 5,317,036, 5,352,749, 5,405,922, 5,436,304, ^ 55453;4^lT'5^&amp;£;;999;^ by reference.)<br>

A slurry polymerization process generally uses pressures in the range of from about 1 to about 50 atmospheres and even greater and temperatures in the range of 0°C to about 120°C. In a slurry polymerization, a suspension of solid, particulate polymer is formed in a liquid polymerization diluent medium to which ethylene and comonomers and often hydrogen along with catalyst are added. The suspension including diluent.is intermittently or continuously removed from the reactor where the volatile components are separated from the polymer and recycled, optionally after a distillation, to the reactor. The liquid diluent employed in the polymerization medium is typically an alkane having from 3 to 7 carbon atoms, preferably a branched alkane. The medium employed should be liquid under the conditions of polymerization and relatively inert. When a propane medium is used the process must be operated above the reaction diluent critical temperature and pressure. Preferably, a hexane or an isobutane medium is employed.
