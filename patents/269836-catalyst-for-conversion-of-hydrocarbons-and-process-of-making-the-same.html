SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
20 This invention provides a catalyst containing silicon, aluminum, phosphorus, as needed to form a silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) with at least one other element selected from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15<br>
25 and the first series transition metals in a three dimensional interconnecting crystalline tetrahedral framework. The crystalline tetrahedral framework is synthesized from an aqueous gel containing, as needed, a silica source, an aluminum source, a phosphorus source, a source for the Group 4, Group 5,<br>
30   Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition<br><br>
metal element(s) and, optionally, an organic structure-directing agent. The reaction mixture is heated to form crystals and then cooled. The crystals are separated from the synthesis liquor and are washed, dried and calcined. At least 5 one metal selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 or Group 10 is deposited on the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate (hereinafter referred to as "deposited metal"). The catalyst may be used in a process for converting C2-C12 hydrocarbons into aromatics.<br>
10 One example of the invention is a catalyst on which at least one Group 10 metal, such as platinum, is deposited on a medium pore zeolite having at least one element selected from Group 14 other than silicon, such as germanium, in the zeolite framework.  This example includes a process for synthesizing a<br>
15 medium pore zeolite catalyst by: a) preparing a medium pore zeolite containing at least one element selected from Group 14 other than silicon, such as germanium; b) depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10, such as platinum, on the medium pore zeolite; and c) calcining the medium pore zeolite<br>
20 on which the Group 10 metal is deposited. This example of the invention also includes a process for the conversion of hydrocarbons of: a) contacting a hydrocarbon stream containing alkanes, olefins and mixtures thereof having 2 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule with at least one medium pore zeolite-based<br>
25 catalyst wherein the zeolite contains germanium incorporated into the zeolite framework and wherein at least one metal<br><br>
selected from Group 10, such as platinum, has been deposited on the medium pore zeolite; and b) recovering the product. Examples of medium pore zeolites are ZSM-11, ZSM-12 and ZSM-48. Another example of the invention is a catalyst of an 5 aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) with germanium incorporated into the aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) framework and, optionally, with at least one metal selected from Group 10 deposited on the aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO).  This<br>
10   example  includes  a  process  for  synthesizing  a  zeolite by<br>
preparing an aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate<br>
(SAPO)  with germanium incorporated into the aluminophosphate<br>
(A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) framework and calcining<br>
the aluminophosphate  (A1PO)  or silicoaluminophosphate  (SAPO)<br>
15 aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO). Optionally, at least one metal selected from Group 10 is deposited on the aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO), and said calcining occurs after preparation    of    the    aluminophosphate     (A1PO)     or<br>
20 silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO), before depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) or after depositing at least one metal selected from Group 10 on the aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO).   This example of the invention<br>
25 also includes a process for the conversion of hydrocarbons of contacting a hydrocarbon stream containing alkanes, olefins and<br><br>
mixtures thereof having 2 to 12 carbon atoms per molecule with at least one aluminophosphate (A1P0) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO)-based catalyst wherein the catalyst contains germanium incorporated into the aluminophosphate (A1P0) or 5 silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) framework and, optionally, wherein at least one metal selected from Group 10 has been deposited on the aluminophosphate (A1PO) or silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO) depositing at least one metal selected  from Group  10  on  the  aluminophosphate  (A1PO)  or<br>
10   silicoaluminophosphate (SAPO and recovering the product.<br>
Another example of the invention is a medium pore zeolite having germanium incorporated into the zeolite framework. The zeolite may have a pore structure that is one dimensional, two dimensional or three dimensional.  Examples of the medium pore<br>
15 zeolite are ZSM-11, ZSM-12 or ZSM-48. This example includes a process for synthesizing a zeolite by preparing a medium pore zeolite containing germanium in the framework of the zeolite and calcining the zeolite.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Crystalline silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates<br>
and silicoaluminophosphates have uniform pores through which<br>
molecules  can diffuse.    Aluminosilicates  include  zeolites.<br>
15   Examples of zeolites are MFI (ZSM-5) , BEA (Beta), MWW (MCM-22),<br>

(chabazite), VFI  (VPI-5), MSE (MCS-68), MOZ (ZSM-10), ZSM-48,<br>
MAZ  (Mazzite),  MEI  (ZSM-18),  MFS  (ZSM-57),  NES  (NU-87),  OFF<br>
20   (Offretite),  STI  (Stilbite),  BOG  (Boggsite),  ERI  (Erionite) ,<br>
FAU   (Faujasite),   EUO   (EU-1),   FER   (Ferrierite)   and  GME<br>
(Gemelinite).  Examples of medium pore zeolites are MFI, MEL,<br>

Zeolites, including medium pore zeolites, have pore structures<br><br>
that are one dimensional (1D) , two dimensional (2D) or three dimensional (3D). MTW and ZSM-48 are examples of zeolites with a 1D pore structure. MEL is an example of a zeolite with a 2D pore structure. MFI and BEA are examples of zeolites with a 3D 5   pore structure.<br>
Crystalline silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates have structures of TO4 tetrahedra, which form a three dimensional network by sharing oxygen atoms where  T  represents  tetravalent  elements,  such  as  silicon,<br>
10 trivalent elements, such as aluminum, and pentavalent elements, such as phosphorus. "Zeolite" in the present application includes aluminosilicates with open three-dimensional framework structures (without regard to the dimensional pore structure discussed above)  composed of corner-sharing TO4 tetrahedra,<br>
15 where T is Al or Si, but also includes tetravalent, trivalent and divalent T atoms which are able to isoelectronically replace Si and Al in the framework, e.g., germanium(4+), titanium (4+), boron (3+), gallium (3+), iron (3+), zinc (2+) and beryllium (2 + ) .  "Zeolite" is primarily a description of<br>
20   structure, not composition.<br>
Silicates, aluminosilicates, aluminophosphates and silicoaluminophosphates generally crystallize from an aqueous solution. The typical technique for synthesizing silicates, aluminosilicates,  aluminophosphates or silicoaluminophosphates<br>
25 comprises converting an aqueous gel of a silica source, an aluminum source and a phosphorus source, as needed, to crystals<br><br>
by a hydrothermal process, employing a dissolution/recrystallization mechanism. The reaction medium may also contain an organic structure-directing agent which is incorporated in the microporous space of the crystalline 5 network during crystallization, thus controlling the construction of the network and assisting to stabilize the structure through the interactions with the silicon, aluminum or phosphorus components. The solids content of the gel ranges from about 5% to about 25%.  In one embodiment of the invention<br>
10   the solids content ranges from about 10% to about 20%.<br>

The reaction mixture may sit statically or may be stirred about 600 rpm for one to seven days and heated to a temperature 5 of about 100°C to about 200°C to form crystals. In one embodiment of the invention the temperature range was from about 135°C to about 180°C. The reaction mixture is cooled to room temperature in a range form 15 to 60 minutes at a rate of from about 3°C to 10 °C per minute.  The crystals are separated<br>
10 from the synthesis liquor. The liquid portion of the synthesis liquor may be removed by filtration, evaporation, spray drying or any other means for removing water from the crystals. The crystals are washed with water and then dried and calcined.<br>
The  silicates  are  essentially  aluminum-free  but  may<br>
15   contain aluminum and other impurities up to 500 ppm.<br>
The aluminosilicates may have a silicon to aluminum atomic ratio (Si:Al) greater than 2:1. In one embodiment of the present invention, the silicon to aluminum atomic ratio is in the range from 15:1 to 200:1.   In another embodiment of the<br>
20 present invention, the silicon to aluminum atomic ratio is in the range from 18:1 to 100:1.<br>
The aluminophosphates may have an aluminum to phosphorus atomic ratio (A1:P) in the range from about 0.8:1 to about 1.2:1  as  disclosed  in  U.S.  Patent  no.  4,310,440,  hereby<br>
25   incorporated by reference.<br><br>
The silicoaluminophosphates may have a silicon to aluminum to phosphorus atomic ratio represented by (SxAlyPz)O2 where "x", "y" and "z" represent the mole fractions of silicon, aluminum and phosphorus respectively, present as tetrahedral oxides, 5 said mole fractions being such that they are within the pentagonal compositional area defined by points ABCD and E of a ternary diagram with values represented in the table below:<br>
Mole Fraction<br><br>
	X	y	z<br>
A	0.01	0.47	0.52<br>
B	0.94	0.01	0.05<br>
C	0.98	0.01	0.01<br>
D	0.39	0.60	0.01<br>
E	0.01	0.60	0.39<br>
as disclosed in U.S. Patent no. 4,440,871, hereby incorporated<br>
by reference.<br>
20       The amount of Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group<br>
15  and the  first  series  transition metals present  in the<br>
crystalline framework is in the range from 0.1 wt.% to 25 wt.%.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, this range is from<br>
0.1 wt. % to 10 wt. %.   In another embodiment of the present<br>
25   invention, this range is from 0.1 wt.% to 5 wt.%.<br>
The silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate has average pore size in the range from 2 angstroms to 20 angstroms, i.e., microporous.<br>
At least one metal selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 30   8,  Group  9  or  Group  10  is  deposited  on  the  silicate,<br><br><br>
aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate ("deposited metal") . The metal is deposited not only on the surface of the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate but also in the pores and channels which 5 occur in the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate. The metal is deposited on the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate by any known method of depositing a metal  on  a  silicate,  aluminosilicate,  aluminophosphate  or<br>
10 silicoaluminophosphate. Typical methods of depositing a metal on a silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate are ion exchange and impregnation. In one embodiment of the present invention, the metal is present in the range from 0.05% to 3% by weight.  In another embodiment<br>
15 of the present invention, the metal is present in the range from 0.1% to 2% by weight. In another embodiment of the present invention, the metal is present in the range from 0.2 to 1.5% by weight.<br>
However,  for silicate,  aluminosilicate,  aluminophosphate<br>
20 or silicoaluminophosphate-based catalysts on which metals have been deposited, the process temperatures and catalyst regeneration temperatures cause the metal to "sinter", i.e., agglomeration of the metal particles resulting in an increase of metal particle size on the surface of the zeolite and a<br>

and/or selectivity.<br>
Without the present invention and its claims being limited by theory, it is believed that certain elements in the framework and certain metals deposited on the silicate, 5 aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate associate to resist sintering of the deposited metal. U.S. Patent no. 6,784,333 discloses and claims an aluminum-silicon-germanium zeolite on which platinum has been deposited for use in a process  for the aromatization of hydrocarbons.   The-<br>
10   presence of germanium in the framework of the zeolite and the<br>
presence  of  platinum  deposited  on  the  zeolite  apparently<br>
results in higher selectivity for benzene, toluene and xylenes<br>
(BTX)  which remains essentially constant over a significant<br>
time on stream.   Without the invention of U. S. Patent no.<br>
15 6,784,333 and its claims being limited by theory, it may be that the germanium in the framework and the platinum deposited on the zeolite associate such that the platinum remains dispersed and sintering is reduced. The association of certain elements in the framework and certain deposited metals may be<br>
20 present for zeolites other than ZSM-5 as disclosed in U. S. Patent no. 6,784,333. Other zeolites may be synthesized with germanium in the framework and platinum deposited on the zeolite to form Pt/Ge-zeolite catalysts.<br>
Besides germanium,  there may be other elements in the<br>
25 crystalline framework which associate with platinum or other deposited metals.  Elements in the crystalline framework may be<br><br><br>
selected from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition metals of the Periodic Table of Elements. Specific examples of these elements are germanium, boron, gallium, indium, tin, titanium, zirconium, vanadium, 5 chromium, iron, niobium and phosphorus. One or more elements may be in the crystalline framework.<br>
Besides platinum, there may be other deposited metals which associate with germanium or other elements in the crystalline framework. Deposited metals may be selected from<br>
10 Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 and Group 10 of the Periodic Table of Elements. Specific examples of the deposited metal are platinum, molybdenum, rhenium, nickel, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium and iridium. One or more metals, such as bimetallics, e.g., Pt/Sn, Pt/Ge, Pt/Pb or metal/ metal oxide<br>
15   combinations, e.g. Pt/Ge02, may be deposited.<br>
The crystalline framework of which these elements from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition metals are part and on which metals selected from Group 6,  Group 7,  Group 8,  Group 9 and Group 10 are<br>
20 deposited need not be limited to a zeolite but may be any microporous silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate.<br>
Before or after deposition of the metal, the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate may<br>
25 be bound by oxides or phosphates of magnesium, aluminum, titanium,  zirconium,  thorium,  silicon,  boron  or  mixtures<br><br><br>
thereof. The process steps of binding and depositing metal can occur in any order. Binding may occur before or after metal deposition.<br>
The catalyst may be calcined at different stages in the 5 synthesis. The silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate may be calcined to remove the organic structure-directing agent. This calcination is at a temperature of about 300°C to about 1000°C or about 300°C to about 750°C for  a  time  sufficient  to  remove  essentially  all  of  any<br>
10 structure-directing agent, e.g., one to six hours or about four hours. One example of calcination is at 550°C for ten hours. Calcination may occur after binding. This calcination is at a temperature in the range of from about 300°C to about 1000°C for a time in the range of from about one hour to about 24<br>
15 hours. Calcination may also occur after metal deposition to fix the metal. This calcination should not exceed a temperature of 500°C and may be at a temperature of about 200°C to about 500°C for a time in the range of from about 0.5 hour to about 24 hours.  These calcinations need not be separate but<br>
20 may be combined to accomplish more than one purpose. When the silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate is calcined, it may be bound or unbound and it may have metal deposited on it or not.<br>
The catalyst,  bound or unbound,  will have porosity in<br>
25 addition to the uniform porosity of the silicate, aluminosilicate,  aluminophosphate  or  silicoaluminophosphate.<br><br><br>
For an unbound catalyst, the average pore size of the catalyst can vary for bound and unbound catalyst and is in the range from 2 angstroms to 100 angstroms. In one embodiment of the present invention, the average pore size is in the range from 5 5 angstroms to 50 angstroms. In another embodiment of the present invention, the average pore size is in the microporous range from 5 angstroms to 20 angstroms. For a bound catalyst, the average pore size of the catalyst may vary from 5 angstroms up to 100 microns.<br>
10 Some catalysts used for hydrocarbon conversion are susceptible to sulfur poisoning. However, for some catalysts used for hydrocarbon conversion, modest amounts of sulfur, such as about 0 to 200 ppm in the feed, are acceptable and sometimes preferred.  The catalyst may also be pretreated with sulfur.  A<br>
15 standard sulfurization method that is well known in the art consists in heating in the presence of a sulfur compound, such as hydrogen sulfide, or a mixture of a sulfur compound and an inert gas, such as hydrogen or nitrogen, to a temperature of<br>
between 150 and 800°C. Non-limiting examples of sulfur compounds<br>
20   are H2S, an organosulfide compound, such as dimethyl disulfide<br>
or DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) , or CnH2n+2S or CnH2n+2S2, where n =<br>
1-20.  In  one  embodiment  of  the  present  invention,  the<br>
temperature is between 250 and 600°C.<br>
The catalyst may contain a reaction product, such as a 25   sulfide of the deposited metal, that is formed by contacting<br><br><br>
the catalyst with sulfur or a sulfur compound. In one embodiment of the present invention, the amount of sulfur on the catalyst is in the range of from 10 ppm to 0.1 wt.%.<br>
The catalyst may also contain elements other than sulfur,<br>
5 such as tin, germanium or lead. These elements would be present in the range of from 1:1 to 1:100 as a ratio of the deposited metal to tin, germanium or lead. These elements may be added to the catalyst by wet impregnation, chemical vapor deposition or other methods known in the art.<br>
0 The silicate, aluminosilicate, aluminophosphate or silicoaluminophosphate-based catalyst which contains at least one element selected from Group 4, Group 5, Group 13, Group 14, Group 15 and the first series transition metals isomorphously incorporated into the zeolite framework and at least one metal<br>
5 selected from Group 6, Group 7, Group 8, Group 9 and Group 10 deposited on the zeolite can be used in a process for conversion of hydrocarbon streams containing C2-C12 alkanes, olefins or mixtures thereof, which may be straight, branched, cyclic or mixtures thereof, into aromatics.<br>
0 The zeolite may be base-exchanged with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal, such as cesium, potassium, sodium, rubidium, barium, calcium, magnesium and mixtures thereof, to reduce acidity and form a non-acidic zeolite. A non-acidic zeolite  has  substantially  all  of  its  cationic  sites  of<br>
5   exchange,  e.g.,  those  typically  associated  with  aluminum, occupied by nonhydrogen  cationic  species,  e.g.,  alkali  or<br><br><br>
alkaline earth metals. These cationic sites are often responsible for cracking of hydrocarbons into undesired products. A zeolite may be non-acidic by exchange with a base or, for meaning and purposes of the present invention, by 5 having a low aluminum content, i.e., having aluminum content of no more than 0.4wt%. The base-exchange may occur before or after the noble metal is deposited. Such a base-exchanged catalyst may be used to convert C6-C12 alkanes, such as might be obtained from natural gas condensate, light naphtha, raffinate<br>
10 from aromatics extraction and other refinery or chemical processes, to aromatics, such as benzene, ethyl benzene, toluene and xylenes. Base-exchange may take place during synthesis of the zeolite with an alkali metal or alkaline earth metal being added as a component of the reaction mixture or may<br>
15 take place with a crystalline zeolite before or after deposition of the noble metal. The zeolite is base-exchanged to the extent that most or all of the cations associated with aluminum are alkali metal or alkaline earth metal. An example of a monovalent base:aluminum molar ratio in the zeolite after<br>
20   base exchange is at least about 0.9.    For a divalent or<br>
trivalent base, the molar ratio would be half (0.45) or a third<br>
(0.3)  as that for a monovalent base,  respectively,  and for<br>
mixtures of monovalent, divalent and trivalent bases, the above<br>
molar ratios would be apportioned by their respective content<br>
25   in the mixture.<br><br><br>

(0) Two-stage hydrocracking for upgrading hydrocarbon streams having initial boiling points above about 200°C to premium distillate and gasoline boiling range products or as feed to further fuels or chemicals processing steps. The first stage<br>
0 can be the zeolite-bound high silica zeolite comprising one or more catalytically active substances, e.g., a Group 8 metal, and the effluent from the first stage would be reacted in a second stage using a second zeolite, e.g., zeolite Beta, comprising one or more catalytically active substances, e.g.,<br>

(S)  The  conversion  of  naphtha  (e.g.,  C6-C10)  and  similar<br><br><br>
mixtures to highly aromatic mixtures. Thus, normal and slightly branched chained hydrocarbons, preferably having a boiling range above about 40°C, and less than about 200°C, can be converted to products having a substantially higher octane 5 aromatics content by contacting the hydrocarbon feed with the zeolite at a temperature in the range of from about 400°C to 600°C, preferably 480°C to 550°C at pressures ranging from atmospheric to 40 bar, and liquid hourly space velocities (LHSV) ranging from 0.1 to 15 hr-1.<br>

20 having from about 2 to about 5 carbon atoms. The oligomers which are the products of the process are medium to heavy olefins which are useful for both fuels, i.e., gasoline or a gasoline blending stock, and chemicals. The oligomerization process  is generally carried out by contacting the olefin<br>
25 feedstock in a gaseous state with a zeolite-bound high silica zeolite at a temperature in the range of from about 250°C to<br><br><br>
about 800°C, a LHSV of from about 0.2 to about 50 and a hydrocarbon partial pressure of from about 0.1 to about 50 atmospheres. Temperatures below about 250°C may be used to oligomerize the feedstock when the feedstock is in the liquid<br>
5   phase when contacting the zeolite-bound high silica zeolite catalyst.  Thus,  when  the  olefin  feedstock  contacts  the catalyst in the liquid phase, temperatures of from about 10°C to about 250°C can be used. (W)  The conversion of C2 unsaturated hydrocarbons  (ethylene<br>
0 and/or acetylene) to aliphatic C6-12 aldehydes and converting said aldehydes to the corresponding C6-12 alcohols, acids, or esters.<br>
(X) The desulfurization of FCC (fluid catalytic cracking) feed streams.  The desulfurization process is generally carried out<br>
5   at a temperature ranging from 100°C to about 600°C, preferably from about 200°C to about 500°C,  and more preferably from about 260°C to about 400°C, at a pressure ranging from 0 to about 2000 psig, preferably from about 60 to about 1000 psig, and more preferably from about 60 to about 500 psig, at a LHSV<br>
0 ranging from 1 to 10 h-1. The hydrocarbon mixtures which can be desulfurized according to the process of the present invention contain more than 150 ppm of sulfur, e.g., hydrocarbon mixtures with a sulfur content higher than 1000 ppm, even higher than 10000 ppm.<br>
