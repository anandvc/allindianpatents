1.   TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION AN ACYLATED CELLUBIOSE AND COMPOSITIONS CONTAINING THEM<br>
2. HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, of Hindustan Lever-House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai - 400 020, Maharashtra, India, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913.<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
The present invention relates to esters and in particular to esters of cellobiose, compositions containing them, and their use as structurants.<br>
Background<br>
Many compositions intended for topical application to skin, including a number for various parts of the body, such as face, gums, hands, limbs, feet, torso, underarm, breasts, genitalia, hair and other parts of the body, comprise one or more active agents are distributed within or otherwise supported by a carrier fluid. Although it is possible, in many instances, that such compositions are in the form of lotions, it is often desirable that the active ingredient in such compositions, be it for medical or for cosmetic purposes, remains substantially localised in the region of the body to which it has been topically applied.  In order to assist this to happen and also to enable alternative dispensers for the composition to be employed, the carrier fluid can be thickened or structured, for example by introducing one or more materials for that purpose. Thickened or structured compositions commonly adopt the form of firm sticks, or soft solids and creams.  In such circumstances, the materials are often referred to as structurants or gelants and may sometimes alternatively be called thickeners, depending on the final form of the composition.  The carrier fluid may comprise water and/or a<br><br>
water-miscible organic liquid and alternatively or additionally a water-immiscible liquid.<br>
In general, the choice of structurants or thickeners tends to vary in accordance with the physical nature of the carrier fluid and in particular on whether it is water-miscible or immiscible. The present invention is directed more particularly towards Materials which are capable of structuring a water-immiscible liquid, which may act by itself as carrier for an active ingredient or comprise a water-immiscible phase in an emulsion or micro-emulsion<br>
Many materials have been proposed for structuring or thickening a water-immiscible liquid phase of a composition intended for topical application to humans.  These have included waxes natural waxes, such as paraffin waxes or those typically extracted from vegetation, such as candelilla wax, or glyceride waxes, or produced by chemical treatment of natural oils, for example hydrogenation of castor oil, or produced by extracted from fauna, such as beeswax or spermaceti wax, or derivatives or synthetic variants of them.  Others include fatty alcohols, eg linear C18 or C22 alcohols.  Other materials are polymeric, such as polysiloxane waxes, or polysiloxane elastomers, or various polyamide/polysiloxane copolymers.<br>
In the closing years of the 20th century, a number of structurants were identified which the present inventors classify as fibre-forming.  These include 12-hydroxy stearic acid, various amino acid amides, including particularly, combinations of sterols and sterol esters, including<br><br>
particularly β-itosterol and y-oryzonol, derivatives of threitol, diamide derivatives of cyclohexane, and acylated derivatives of cellobiose.  Each of the various structurants has to a greater or lesser extent its particular benefits and its intrinsic disadvantages, either in absolute or relative terms.  These properties can include the ability of the material to gel or otherwise structure the carrier liquid, including the resultant hardness and stability, and the sensory properties and appearance of the resultant composition, the latter being of great importance for cosmetic compositions.<br>
One of the most desirable class of structurants comprises acylated cellobiose, as described in pending ?CT application No PCT/GB 00/01228, now published as WO 00/61079, particularly for structuring a water-immiscible liquid in a cosmetic compositions, including especially antiperspirant and deodorant compositions.  Said PCT application describes various benefits for the acylated cellobiose structurant and exemplifies many compositions demonstrating such benefits. In said PCT application, it has been disclosed that the cellobiose can adopt either an a or β configuration, preferably the former, and various preferences are given for both the number of acyl substituents of the cellobiose nucleus and the chemical constitution of the substituents. The description of alternatives included the choice of an aliphatic acyl substiruent, whether it is linear or branched and its chain length.  Acylated cellobiose materials were exemplified in which identical acyl substituents were employed.  The most highly preferred acylated cellobiose described therein is cellobiose octanonanoate.<br><br>
Continuing research into the properties of acylated cellobiose materials and compositions structured using them has shown that variations in the structurants can result in changes to various of the properties of the structured compositions, including amongst other things the thermal stability of the final structured material, the resistance of the structurant to crystallisation in situ, and the clarity and hardness of the composition.<br>
a-lobiose octanonanoate has been shown to be an extremely good structurant for water-immiscible liquids, including silicone fluids and water-immiscible emollient liquids employed in many cosmetic compositions.  However, ongoing research into the acylated cellobiose structurants has indicated that its thermal stability could be improved and that long term storage can lead to a gradual reduction in clarity.  This would appear from studies to be associated with crystallisation of the structurant.  Either effect conveys self-evident disadvantages.  Loss of structural strength with time limits the shelf life of the product and a reduction in clarity can be taken by consumers as a visual cue that efficacy has been impaired. ' Consumer formulations can take a long time to pass through conventional manufacture and distribution channels and can sometimes also spend a long time on consumers' shelves before or during use, so that it is desirable to find ways of ameliorating or overcoming any negative effects that would otherwise arise during storage.  It will, of course, be recognised that any changes made should endeavour not to sacrifice any of the other beneficial properties of the products.<br><br>
However, many compositions are desirably translucent or transparent and the controlled hardness of the composition remains an important characteristic.  Consequently, any change made to the formulation or alternative selection made from the class of acylated cellobiose materials should endeavour to minimise or even overcome and reverse any impairment to the other properties of the structurant which might arise when seeking to improve one of the properties. By way of example, measures to improve stability against in situ crystallisation can reduce hardness.  Mixtures of the materials can be contemplated and then some trade-off in the performance of the structurant mixture compared with its constituents has been observed.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide an alternative acylated cellobiose which demonstrates an attractive combination of properties, particularly in the context of acting as a structurant for a water-immiscible liquid.<br>
It will be understood, however, that although the material of the instant invention is contemplated especially for use in cosmetic formulations, its potential use is much wider, including the structuring of a water-immiscible liquid to make a cream, soft solid or stick for any other purpose. Such other purposes could include topical medicaments, topically applied veterinary products or animal cosmetics and waxes or plish.es.<br><br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
According to a first aspect of the present invention there is provided as a new compound, an acylated cellobiose satisfying the general formula:<br><br>
in which X represents an acyl group (R-CO-) or H, Z represents an acyl group (R'-CO-)  and not more than a minority of X + Z residues represent H,<br>
R represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched chain hydrpcarbon residue containing from 5 to 31 carbon atoms and<br>
R' represents a residue which is different from R and which is : -<br>
(i) a saturated or unsaturated, linear or 'branched chain hydrocarbon residue containing from 1 to 31 carbon atoms, optionally substituted or;<br>
(ii) an aromatic hydrocarbon residue, optionally substituted or;<br>
(iii) a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon, optionally substituted. The Z substituent is at the anomeric position.<br><br>
Such an ester herein in which R differs from R' is sometimes referred to as a CKME.<br>
Sucir aterials, ie CHMEs, demonstrate an excellent combination of properties rendering those materials particularly suitable for structuring or thickening water-immiscible liquids, enabling them to be employed in the manufacture of base gels for cosmetic or medical actives and particularly for translucent base gels. The benefits accrue by selecting substitution R' at the anomeric carbon which is different from that of the other aIkyI groups R.<br>
For example, by comparison with the employment of various cellobiose octaesters, advantageously, improvements in one or more of the following properties can be seen, namely clarity, thermal stability and resistance against in situ crystallisation, whilst not sacrificing hardness.<br>
in which X represents an acyl group (R-CO-) or H, K being not more than a minority of X residues and R represents a<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided a method for the preparation of an acylated cellobiose as described in the first aspect hereinabove comprising the step of reacting an acylated cellobiose having general formula 2<br><br><br>
saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched chain hydrocarbon residue containing from 5 to 31 carbon atoms with an acylating agent containing a residue R' as described hereinabove preferentially at the anomeric carbon of the cellobiose.<br>
In this aspect, either the hydroxy1 group at the anomeric carbon atom is acylated, or the acyl group R-CO- at the anomeric carbon atom is transesterified.<br>
In a tnird aspect of the present invention there is provided the use of an acylated cellobiose as described in the first aspect hereinabove for thickening or structuring a water-immiscible liquid, thereby forming a cream, soft solid or solid.<br>
In a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a base composition in the form of a cream, soft solid or solid containing a structurant or thickener an acylated cellobiose as described hereinabove in. the first aspect.<br>
In a related fifth aspect of the present invention, the base composition of the fourth aspect additionally contains an active cosmetic, medical, or veterinary agent.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred<br>
Bmbodlments<br>
Herein the acylated cellobiose compounds satisfy the formula<br>
shown below:<br><br><br>
When x and z represent respectively -COR and -COR' in this formula, R represents a saturated or unsaturated, linear or branched chain hydrocarbon residue whichxcontains from 5 to 31 carbon atoms, often up to 18 carbon atoms, preferably from 7 and 12 carbon atoms and especially 8 or 9 carbon atoms.  Preferably R residues are saturated and desirably are linear. Most desirably, all R groups are the same.  It will be recognised that in practice the.alkyl substituent oi a specified chain length in an acylating agent can contain impurity levels of isomers or close homologues.  For example, when R is nominally octyl, the substituent can comprise as impurities a low proportion, typically not more than 5% of iso octyl and n-heptyl /n-nonyl groups.<br>
In this formula, R' represents an aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic residue.  R' can be alkyl, alkaryl, aryl, or aralkyl, optionally substituted.  In many desirable embodiments, R' is non-aliphatic when R is aliphatic.<br>
The residue R' when aliphatic can comprise a saturated or unsaturated,.. linear, or branched chain hydrocarbon residue containing from 1 to 31 carbon atoms, more desirably linear, and preferably from 2 to 22 carbon atoms.  The R and R' residues are different from each other, so that R' is often<br><br>
selected from residues having a maximum chain length in the ranges of up to R-2 carbons or from R+2 carbons, and conveniently in the ranges of from 1 to 6 and 13 to 22 carbon atoms.  Particularly desirable short chain alkyl R' residues include methyl, ethyl, and propyl.  The alkyl groups within R' can optionally he fluorinated or substituted by an aryl group such as those described hereinafter or by a cycloaliphatic group such as those described hereinafter or by an amine or amide group.  The substituted aliphatic residue R' desirably contains not more than 31 and particularly not more than 22 carbon atoms.<br>
When R' represents or contains an aromatic hydrocarbon residue, particularly an aryl residue, suitable examples comprise phenyl, naphthyl and biphenyl residues.  The aryl group can comprise 1 or a plurality of nuclei, which may be fused or not fused.  The-aryl nucleus or nuclei therein can be substituted, for example by an alkyl or alkoxy group containing up to 20 carbon atoms or a halo group such as fluoro or a nitro group or an alkyl. ester. , alkylamine or alkylamido group.  The substituted aromatic residue R' desirably contains not more than 26 carbon atoms.<br>
When R' represents a cycloaliphatic hydrocarbon residue, suitable examples include cyclohexane and cyclooctane.  The cycloaliphatic nuclei can be substituted for example by an alkyl or alkoxy group containing up to 20 carbon atoms or by an aryl group such as described above.<br><br>
R' can comprise an alkyl, aryl, cycloalkyl, alkaryl, aralkyl or cycloalkylaryl residue.<br>
The acylated cellobiose materials according to the present invention can adopt either of the a or P anomeric forms or mixtures thereof. In a number of highly desirable embodiments, for example those in which R' constitutes a saturated hydrocarbon residue, such as cyclohexyl, or linear C4 to CIO alkyl which differs from the R residue, the CHMS comprises at least 60 molar% in the β anomeric form, particularly.at least 80 molar%, and some especially preferred CHMEs are at lest 90 molar% in the β anomeric form.  In other desirable embodiments, for example those in which R' constitutes an unsaturated hydrocarbon residue, such as benzoyl or 4-Biphenoyl, the CKME preferably is at least90 molar% in the β anomeric form.<br>
Preferably, the acylated cellobiose is acylated by a total of greater than, six and in, many __.ins.tanc.es, greater than seven acyl substituents, R-CO- + R'-CO-, on average, and especially by at least 95 molar % of total acylation.  In practice, we have found that acylation often occurs preferentially at cellobiose carbons other than at its anomeric carbon atom, so that the former carbons tend towards being fully acylated, commonly at least six of the seven. X locations--representing R-C0-, and in many instances all or substantially all seven locations representing R-CO-, whilst anomeric carbon may be, and commonly is, acylated to a lesser proportion.<br><br>
It is desirable that the anomeric carbon is acylated to at -least 50%, preferably at least 60% and more preferably is at least 75% acylated, and most desirably in conjunction with X representing at or substantially 100% R-CO- (normally at least 6 out of seven locations, and preferably greater than 97%) .  It is particularly desirable to employ CKMEs in which there is not only a high extent of acylation at the anomeric carbon, but also simultaneously a high molar proportion of the ester is in the (3 anomeric form, each of which feature has been described more precisely hereinbefore.<br>
An especially suitable sub-set of CKMEs comprises esters in which i) each R substituent represents a linear octyl residue, ii) the anomeric position is acylated to a high proportion and preferably at least 75 molar%, and iii) a high proportion of and preferably at least 80 molar% of the<br>
CHME is in the β anomeric form.<br>
When contemplating the use of the cellobiose esters in general and the invention esters in particular for preparing translucent gels of water-immiscible fluids, such as silicone fluids or other water-immiscible fluids mentioned herein, it is desirable to select those materials which have a relatively high fibre dissolution temperature (FDT). Advantageously, many of the invention esters herein exhibit an FDT of at least 48°C and especially advantageous invention esters are those having an FDT of at least 51°C, because they tend to produce gels having greater storage stability.<br><br>
The acylated cellobiose materials of the present invention may be used as a sole or primary structurants or may be used as minor or supplementary structurant in conjunction with one or more of the classes of structurants that are mentioned hereinafter. By way of example, the invention structurants can be used together with an acylated cellobiose described in PCT/GB 00/01228, in which the anomeric acyl group is the same as at least some of the other acyl groups, ie R = R', such as cellobiose octanonanoateor, especially, cellobiose octadecanoate.<br>
It is especially desirable to employ acylated cellobiose materials identified herein (CHMEs) in which all the R substituents are identical and are n-nonyl or particularly n-octyi and at least 75% of substituents at the anomeric carbon are R' (ie at least 75 molar% acylation at the anomeric position) and = cyclohexyl, phenyl, naphthyl or •methyl and particularly cyclohexyl.  Such especially<br>
desirable CHMEs preferably are at least 80 molar% in the (3 anomeric form. <br>
Material Preparation<br>
One convenient and general method for making the acylated cellobiose compounds of the present invention comprises the step of transesterifying a corresponding acylated cellobiose in which the acyl substituents -COR and -COR' are identical. Such a process in practice can be two step, the first step of which comprises preparing an octaesterified cellobiose, for example by a process as described hereinbelow.  The<br><br><br>
second-step of such a-process comprises reacting the octaester with an acylating agent containing a -COR' residue, capable of displacing the residue -COR, if needed in the presence of a strong acylating catalyst.  The resultant product often comprises a proportion of residual R-CO- residues at the anomeric carbon atom.<br>
A related method comprises acylating the corresponding partially acylated cellobiose with an acylating agent containing a -COR' residue, where needed in the presence of an acylating catalyst, the anomeric carbon being partly or preferably wholly or substantially wholly substituted by an hydroxyl group.  Such a substrate can be obtained, for example, by deacylating wholly or partly a cellobiose octester.  Consequently, the invention mixed ester cellobiose compounds can be made in a three step process comprising the steps of first making an octaester in which the acyl substituent -COR' at the anomeric carbon is the same as at the other cellobiose carbons, R-CO-, secondly removing the. anomeric. acyl-substituent,, and..then, re-acylating at the anomeric position with a different acyl substituent.<br>
In one way of carrying out the first step, be it for either the two or three step processes indicated above, cellobiose (commonly D-(+)-cellobiose) is reacted with a molar excess of an acylating agent, often a substantial excess, such as an acid chloride, RC0C1, carboxylic acid RC02H or acid anhydride (RCO)20 and, where necessary, an acylation catalyst.  The R groups are as hereinbefore described.  For<br><br>
example, when using an acid as acylating agent, the catalyst can desirably be derivable from an acid having a low pKa such as an anhydride (R"C0)20, often in a significant molar excess.  The R" group is desirably a polychlorinated or preferably polyfluorinated alkyl, such as trifluoromethyl. The acylating agent, eg carboxylic acid, is preferably employed at a mole ratio to the cellobiose in the range of at least 50:1 and especially from 60:1 to 100:1.  The catalyst is preferably employed with the acid at a mole ratio to the cellobiose of at least 20:1 and particularly from 22:1 to 50:1.  The acylatien is desirably conducted at an elevated temperature such as above 7 0°C and especially approximately 100°C for a period of at least 2 hours and especially from 3 to 10 hours.  The resultant product is substantially or completely acylated, that is to say that at least 90% of the acylatable hydroxyl groups on the cellobiose have been acylated and often at least 95% acylated.<br>
In a variant of. the. first s.tep, the. cellobiose-. (.commonly D-(+)-cellobiose) is reacted with a molar excess of an acylating agent, often a significant excess, such as an acid chloride, RCOCl, in solution in a volatile chlorohydrocarbon such as chloroform, the presence of an excess of a strong base catalyst, such as pyridine, and most preferably in a dry, inert atmosphere.  Preferably, the acylating agent is employed in..a. mole ratio, to the cellobiose in the range of from 12:1 to 24.-1, from 1.5 to 3 times a stoichiometric amount for octa-acylation.  The base catalyst is commonly employed in a mole ratio to the cellobiose of from 6:1 to<br><br>
12:1.  The acylatiorr step" is desirably carried out at a mildly elevated temperature, such as from 40 to 75°C, and often at from 45 to 60°C.  The reaction is advantageously monitored via HPLC and/or proton NMR and allowed to continue until hepta-acylated cellobiose is no longer detectable. Such reaction period is often in the range of from 10 to 3 0 hours.  The acylation product can be recovered by cooling to ambient and precipitation in methanol.  This method is particular applicable for the preparation of esters predominantly in the j3 anomeric form.<br>
In the second step in the above-mentioned three step process, the acylated cellobiose produced in the first step or the variant, i.e. in predominantly a or p anomeric form or a mixture thereof, is partially de-acylated preferentially at the anomeric carbon.  One method comprises reacting the fully acylated cellobiose with a mixture of a low-molecular weight aliphatic acid, (C1-C4) and especially acetic acid with an alkylene diamine such as in particular ethylene diamine, at. a. low. concentration in THF. (tetrahydrofuran) , such as from 4 to 15% by weight acylated cellobiose.  The acid employed in the second step has a higher pKa than the catalyst in the first step.  The reaction preferably employs an approximately equimolar ratio of acid to acylated cellobiose, such as in the range of 0.9 to 1.2:1 and a small molar excess of diamine to acylated cellobiose, such..as from 1.6 to 2.5:1.  The reaction can conveniently be carried out  in at  or about  ambient   temperature, e.g. 20   to 3 0°C for a long reaction time, often of at least 12 hours and particularly from 24 to 60 hours, or at a mildly elevated<br><br>
temperature such as up to 45°C for a commensurately shorter period such as selected in the range of from 5 to 10 hours. The resultant partially deacylated material can be recovered by extraction into a haloalkane solvent such as dichloromethane and acid washed. After drying, it is recrystallisable from a THF/methanol mixture.<br>
In the third step, the partially de-acylated cellobiose is re-acylated.  The re-acylation can employ a carboxylic acid, an acid chloride, or an anhydride.<br>
In the first variant of this third step, the cellobiose is reacted with an  at least equimolar amount of an acid chloride of formula R'COCl, preferably a small molar excess of from 1.1 to 1.5:1, in the presence of at least an equimolar amount of triethylamine and preferably a small molar excess of from 1.1 to 1.5:1.  The reaction is desirably conducted at or within 10°C of reflux temperature, suitably for at least 1 hour and preferably from 2 to 4 hours.  Desirably, the reaction is permitted to continue until at- least a- predetermined extent of acylation at the anomeric carbon, such as at least 80% and often at least 90% has occurred.  In this first variant, the resultant CHME is predominantly in the (3 anomeric form, the exact proportions of the a and (3 forms depending on the acyl substituent and process conditions adopted.<br>
In the second' variant of this third step, the partially de-acylated cellobiose is reacted with an substantial excess of a carboxylic acid of formula R'CO2H, such as a mole ratio of at least 50:1 and particularly from 60 to 100:1 in the<br><br>
presence of a significant molar excess of a strong acid catalyst such as that employed in the first step and preferably in a mole ratio to the cellobiose of at least 20:1 and especially from 22:1 to 50:1.  The reaction is preferably carried out at elevated temperature, such as especially above 90°C and particularly at about 100°C.  The reaction period is desirably at least 4 hours and is especially from 5 to 10 hours.  Desirably, the reaction is permitted to continue until at least a predetermined extent of acylation at the anomeric carbon, such as at least 80% and often at least 90% has occurred.  In this second variant, the resultant CHME is predominantly in the ex anomeric form, the exact proportions of the a and 3 forms depending on the acyl substituent and process conditions adopted.<br>
In the third variant for carrying out the third step, the partialiy-deacylated cellobiose is reacted with an anhydride of formula (R'C0)20.  The reaction is conveniently carried out in a hydrocarbon solvent having a boiling point of at least 80°C, such' as- toluene.  The reaxrtxon preferably employs an excess anhydride, especially in a mole ratio to the cellobiose of at least 2:1, and often from 2.5 to 10:1.<br>
Water-immiscible liquid<br>
The water-immiscible liquid, which in many embodiments acts as a carrier" for a disperse solid or liquid phase, normally comprises one or a mixture of materials which are relatively hydrophobic so as to be immiscible in water.  Some hydrophilic liquid may be included in the water-immiscible<br><br>
liquid, to the extent that it is soluble or miscible with<br>
the water-immiscible liquid and provided the overall carrier<br>
liquid mixture is still immiscible with water.  It will<br>
generally be desired that this carrier is liquid (in the<br>
absence of structurant) at temperatures of 15°C and above.<br>
It may have some volatility but its vapour pressure will<br>
generally be less than 4kPa (30 mmHg) at 25°C so that the<br>
material can be referred to as an oil or mixture of oils.<br>
More specifically, it is desirable in some embodiments, that<br>
at least 80% by weight of the hydrophobic carrier liquid<br>
should consist of materials with a vapour pressure not over<br>
this value of 4kPa at 25°C.	,<br>
It is preferred, e.g. for use in cosmetic formulations that the hydrophobic carrier material includes a volatile liquid silicone, i.e. liquid polyorganosiloxane.  To class as "volatile" such material should have a measurable vapour pressure at 2 0 or 25°C.  Typically the vapour pressure of a volatile silicone lies in a range from 1 or 10 Pa to 2 kPa at 25°C.<br>
It is desirable to include volatile silicone because it gives a "drier" feel to the applied film after the composition is applied to skin.<br>
Volatile polyorganosiloxanes can be linear or cyclic or mixtures thereof.  Preferred cyethc Loxanes include polydimethylsiloxanes and particularly those containing from 3 to 9 silicon atoms and preferably not more than 7 silicon atoms and most preferably from 4 to 6 silicon atoms, otherwise of ten referred to as cyclomethicones.  Preferred<br><br>
linear siloxanes include polydimethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9 silicon atoms.  The volatile siloxanes normally by themselves exhibit viscosities of below 10-3 m2/sec (10 centistokes), and particularly above 10"7 m2/sec (0.1 centistokes), the linear siloxanes normally exhibiting a viscosity of below 5 x 10"D m2/sec (5 centistokes).  The volatile silicones can also comprise branched linear or cyclic siloxanes such as the aforementioned linear or cyclic siloxanes substituted by one or more pendant -0-Si(CH3)3 groups.  Examples of commercially available silicone oils include oils having grade designations 344, 345, 244, 245 and 246 from Dow Corning Corporation; Silicone 7207 and Silicone 7158 from Union Carbide Corporation; and SF1202 from General Electric.<br>
The hydrophobic water-immiscible liquid carrier employed in many compositions herein can alternatively or additionally comprise non-volatile silicone oils, which include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyethersiloxane copolymers.  These can suitably be selected from dimethicone and dimethicone copolyols.  Selected polyalkylaryl siloxanes include short chain polysiloxanes, e.g. tri or tetrasiloxanes containing on average at least one phenyl group per siloxane unit, for example<br>
tetraphenyltrisiloxanes.  Commercially available non¬volatile silicone oils include Dow Corning 556, Dow Corning 200 series and DC704.<br>
The water-immiscible liquid carrier may contain from 0 to 100% by weight of one or more liquid silicones. Some embodiments contain liquid silicones in at least 10%, better<br><br>
at least 15%, by-weight-of the whole composition.  If silicone oil is used, in some embodiments, volatile silicone preferably constitutes from 10 to 100% of the weight of the carrier liquid.  In many instances, when a non-volatile silicone oil is present, its weight ratio to volatile silicone oil is chosen in the range of less than 3:1 such as from 1:3 to 1:40, whereas in certain other embodiments, the proportion of volatile silicone oils is from 0 to less than 10%, so that the weight ratio of non-volatile to volatile silicone oils is greater than 10:1, such as from 15:1 to °°:1.  In other embodiments, liquid silicones are absent, or present in only a small proportion of the water-immiscible phase, such as up to 7 or 8% by weight.  Accordingly, a range of mixtures of silicone oils and non-silicone oils can be employed as liquid carrier for structuring by the CHMS invention esters.  Many of such mixture employ a weight ratio of the silicone to non-silicone oils of from 4:1 to 1:4.  The selection of carrier fluids is often made taking into account the refractive index of the components of the carrier fluid mixture, and the refractive index of a particulate active constituent such as an antiperspirant or of a water-miscible phase <br>
Silicon-free hydrophobic liquids can be used instead of, or in some embodiments in addition to liquid silicones. Silicon-free hydrophobic organic liquids which can be incorporated include  volatile or non-volatile liauid aliphatic hydrocarbons such as mineral oils or hydrogenated polyisobutene, often selected to exhibit a low viscosity. Further examples of liquid hydrocarbons are polydecsne and paraffins and isoparaffins of at least 10 carbon atoms.<br><br>
Other hydrophobic-carriers are liquid aliphatic or aromatic esters, but for some uses, for example antiperspirant formulations, these should be used as only part of the liquid carrier, desirably not above 2 0%, and possibly less than 10% by weight of the water-immiscible liquid carrier.<br>
Suitable aliphatic esters contain at least one long chain alkyl group, such as esters derived from C1 to C20 alkanols esterified with a C8 to C22 alkanoic acid or C6 to C10 alkanedioic acid.  The alkanol and acid moieties or mixtures thereof are preferably selected such that they each have a melting point of below 20°C.  These esters include isopropyl myristate, lauryl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, diisopropyl sebacate and diisopropyl adipate.<br>
Suitable liquid aromatic esters, preferably having a melting point of below 2 0°C, include fatty alkyl benzoates.  Examples of such esters include suitable C3 to C18 alkyl benzoates or mixtures thereof.<br>
Further instances of suitable hydrophobic carriers comprise liquid aliphatic ethers derived from at least one fatty alcohol, such as myristyl ether derivatives e.g. PPG-3 myristyl ether or lower alkyl ethers of polygylcols, eg C2-C4 alkyl PPG ethers such as commercial products having CFTA nominally labelled PPG-14 butyl ether.<br>
Aliphatic alcohols which are solid at 2 0°C, such as stearyl alcohol are preferably absent or present in low concentration such as less than 5% by weight of the whole<br><br>
composition since these lead to visible white deposits when a composition is used.<br>
However, aliphatic alcohols which are liquid at 20°C may be employed.  These include branched chain alcohols of at least 10 carbon atoms such as isostearyl alcohol and octyl dodecanol.<br>
Silicon-free liquids can constitute from 0-100% of the water-immiscible liquid carrier.  It is preferred that silicone oil and/or a hydrocarbon oil is present and that  the total amount of other liquid carriers, preferably, constitutes up to 50 or 60% for example from 0 to 10% OR 10 to 20% by weight of the water-immiscible carrier liquid.<br>
An especially desired combination of water immiscible carrier liquids comprises a mixture of a silicone liquid such as a eyelomethicone and a hydrocarbon liquid, such as in a weight ratio of the former to the latter of from 3:2 to 1:10, optionally in the presence of an emollient water-immiscible liquid.<br>
Emulsion<br>
Many formulations according to the present invention also contain a more polar disperse phase.  In such compositions, the invention acylated cellobiose acts as a structural in the continuous water-immiscible phase.  The disperse phase may be a polar liquid alone or conveniently comprise a solution of an active ingredient, such as an antiperspirar.t salt.<br><br>
The hydrophilic disperse phase in an emulsion normally comprises water as solvent and can comprise one or more water-soluble or water-miscible liquids in addition to or as a replacement for water.  The proportion of hydrophilic carrier fluid, e.g. water, in the disperse phase, in an emulsion according to the present invention is often selected in the range of up to 60%, and particularly from 10% up to 40% or 50% of the whole formulation.<br>
One class of water-soluble or water-miscible liquids comprises short chain monohydric alcohols, e.g. C1 to C4 and especially ethanol or isopropanol, which can impart a deodorising capability to the formulation.  A further class of hydrophilic liquids comprises diols or polyols preferably having a melting point of below 40°C, or which are water miscible.  Examples of water-soluble or water-miscible liquids with at least one free hydroxyl group include ethylene glycol, 1,2-propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, hexylene glycol, diethylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, 2-ethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol monomethy1ether, triethyleneglycol' monomethy1ether and sorbitol.  Especially preferred are propylene glycol and glycerol.<br>
In an emulsion, the disperse phase is likely to constitute from 5 to 80 or 85% of the weight of the composition preferably from 5 to 50 or 65%, more preferably from 25 or 35% up to 50 or 65%, while the continuous phase with the structurant therein provides the balance from 15 or 35% up to 95% of the weight of the composition.  Advantages can accrue when the internal phase volume constitutes a minor proportion of emulsion, such as from about 30 to 45% by<br><br>
weight. . Yet .other advantages arise at 45 to 65% internal phase volume.  Compositions with high proportion of disperse phase, i.e. from 65 to 85% disperse phase, may also be advantageous.  They can give good hardness even though the concentration of esterified saccharide structurant may be only a small percentage of the total composition.<br>
An emulsion composition will generally include one or more emulsifying surfactants which may be anionic, cationic, zwitterionic and/or nonionic surfactants.  The proportion of emulsifier in the composition is often selected in the range up to 10% by weight and in many instances from 0.1 or. 0.25 up to 5% by weight of the composition.  Most preferred is an amount from 0.1 or 0.25 up to 2 or 3% by weight, such as 0.3%, 0.4% or 0.5% by weight, or an amount in between. Nonionic emulsifiers are frequently classified by HLB value. It is desirable to use an emulsifier or a mixture of emulsifiers with an overall HLB value in a range from 2 to 10 preferably from 3 to 8.<br>
It may be convenient to use a combination of two or more emulsifiers which have different HLB values above and below the desired value.  By employing the two emulsifiers together in appropriate ratio, it is readily feasible to attain a weighted average HLB value that promotes the formation of an emulsion.<br>
Many suitable emulsifiers of high HLB are nonionic ester or ether emulsifiers comprising a polyoxyalkylene moiety, especially a polyoxyethylene moiety, often containing from about 2 to 80, and especially 5 to 60 oxyethylene units,<br><br>
and/or contain a polyhydroxy compound such as glycerol or sorbitol or other alditol as hydrophilic moiety.  The hydrophilic moiety can contain polyoxypropylene.  The emulsifiers additionally contain a hydrophobic alkyl, alkenyl or aralkyl moiety, normally containing from about 8 to 50 carbons and particularly from 10 to 30 carbons.  The hydrophobic moiety can be either linear or branched and is often saturated, though it can be unsaturated, and is optionally fluorinated.  The hydrophobic moiety can comprise a mixture of„-chain lengths, for example those deriving from tallow, lard, palm oil, sunflower seed oil or soya bean oil. Such nonionic surfactants can also be derived from a polyhydroxy compound such as glycerol or sorbitol or other alditols.  Examples of emulsifiers include ceteareth-10 to -25, ceteth-10-25, steareth-10-25 (i.e. C16 to C15alcohols ethoxylated with 10 to 25 ethylene oxide residues) and PEG-15-25 stearate or distearate.  Other suitable examples include C10-C20 fatty acid mono, di or tri-glycerides. Further examples include C18-C22 fatty alcohol ethers of polyethylene oxides (8 to 12 EO).<br>
Examples of emulsifiers, which typically have a low HLB value, often a value from 2 to 6 are fatty acid mono or possibly diesters of polyhydric alcohols such as glycerol, sorbitol, erythritol or trimethylblorooane.  The fatty acyl moiety is often rrom C14 to C22 and is saturated in many instances, including cetyl, stearyl, arachidyl and behenyl. Examples' include' monoglycerides of palmitic or stearic acid, sorbitol mono or diesters of myristic, palmitic or stearic acid, and trimethylolprcpane monoesiers of stearic acid.<br><br>
A particularly desirable class of emulsifiers comprises dimethicone copolymers, namely polyoxyalkylene modified dimethylpolysiloxanes.  The polyoxyalkylene group is often a polyoxyethylene (POE) or polyoxypropylene (POP) or a copolymer of POE and POP.  The copolymers often terminate in C1 to C12 alkyl groups.  An especially desirable example of this class is available under the trade name A3IL EM90 for use within the aforementioned ranges of proportions.<br>
Suitable emulsifiers and co-emulsifiers are widely available under many trade names and designations including Abil™, Arlacel™, Brij TK, Crsmophor™, Dehydrol™, Dehymuls™, Emeresr ™, Lame form™, Pluronic™, Prisorine31, Quest PGPR-", Span ™, Tween ™, SF1228, DC3225C and Q2-5200.<br>
Antiperspirant Actives<br>
If the composition is an antiperspirant, it will contain an antiperspirant active.  Antiperspirant actives, are preferably incorporated in an amount'of from 0.5-60%, particularly from 51 to 30% or 4u%' and especially from 5" or 10% to 3 0 or 35% of the weight of the composition.<br>
Antiperspirant actives for use herein are often selected from astringent active sales, including in particular aluminium, zirconium and mixed aluminium/zirconium salts, including both inorganic salts, salts with organic anions and complexes. Preferred astringent salts include aluminium, zirconium and aluminium/zirconium halides and halohydrate salts, such as chlorohydrates.<br><br>
Aluminium halohydrates are usually defined by the general formula Al2 (OH)xQy.wH20 in which Q represents chlorine, bromine or iodine, x is variable from 2 to 5 and x + y = 6 while wH20 represents a variable amount of hydration. Especially effective aluminium halohydrate salts, known as activated aluminium chlorohydrates, are described in EP-A-6739 (Unilever NV et al), the contents of which specification is incorporated herein by reference.  Some activated salts do not retain their enhanced activity in the presence of water but are useful in substantially anhydrous formulations, i.e. formulations which do not contain a distinct aqueous phase.<br>
Zirconium actives can usually be represented by the empirical general formula: ZrO (OH) 2n-r.2Bz wH2O in which z is a variable in the range of from 0.9 to 2.0 so that the value 2n-nz is zero or positive, n is the valency of B, and B is selected from the group consisting of chloride, other halide, sulphamate, sulphate and mixtures thereof.  Possible hydration to a variable extent is represented by wH20. Preferable is- that B represents' chloride  and  the variable- z lies in the range from 1.5 to 1.87. In practice, such zirconium salts are usually not employed by themselves, but as a component of a combined aluminium and zirconium-based antiperspirant.<br>
The above aluminium and zirconium salts may have co-ordinated and/or bound  water in various quantities and/or may be present as polymeric species, mixtures or complexes. In particular, zirconium hydroxy salts often represent a range of salts having various amounts of the hydroxy group.<br><br>
Zirconium aluminium chlorohydrate may be particularly preferred.<br>
Antiperspirant  complexes based on  the above-mentioned astringent  aluminium and/or  zirconium salts  can be employed. The complex  often employs  a  compound with a carboxylate group,   and advantageously  this  is  an amino acid.     Examples of  suitable  amino acids   include  dl-tryptophan,   d l-β-phenyl alanine,   dl-valine,   dl-methionine and (3-alanine,   and preferably glycine which has  the  formula CH3CH(NH2)C02H.<br>
It  is  highly  desirable   to  employ  complexes  of  a  combination of aluminium halohydrates  and zirconium chlorohydrates together with amino acids  such as glycine,   which are disclosed in US-A-3792068   (Luedders  et  al).     Certain of those Al/Zr  complexes  are  commonly called ZAG in the literature.     ZAG actives  generally contain aluminium, zirconium and chloride with an Al/Zr ratio  in a  range  from 2 to  10,   especially  2   to   6,   an Al/Cl  ratio  from 2.1  to   0.9   and a variable  amount of  glycine.     Actives  of  this preferred type, are available  from Westwood,   from Summit and from Reheis.<br>
Other actives   that may be utilised include astringent titanium salts,   for example  those described in GB 2299506A.<br>
The proportion  of   solid  antiperspirant   salt  in  a  composition normally includes  the weight  of  any water of hydration and any complexing  agent  that may also be present  in the  solid active.   However,   when  the  active  salt  is  in  solution,   its weight  excludes  any water present.<br><br>
If the composition is in the form of an emulsion the antiperspirant active will be dissolved in the disperse phase.  In this case, the antiperspirant active will often provide from 3 to 60% by weight of the aqueous disperse phase, particularly from 10% or 20% up to 55% or 60% of that phase.<br>
Alternatively, the composition may take the form of a suspension in which antiperspirant active in particulate form is suspended in the water-immiscible liquid carrier. Such a composition will probably not have any separate aqueous phase present and may conveniently be referred to as "substantially anhydrous" although it should be understood that some water may be present bound to the antiperspirant active or as a small amount of solute within the water-immiscible liquid phase.  In such compositions, the particle size of the antiperspirant salts often falls within the range of 0.1 to 200 um with a mean particle size often from 3 to 20um.  Both larger and smaller mean particle sizes can also be contemplated such as from 20 to 50um or 0.1 to 3um.<br>
Optional ingredients<br>
Optional ingredients in compositions of this invention can include deodorants, for example at a concentration of up to about 10% w/w.  Suitable deodorant actives can comprise deodorant effective concentrations of antiperspirant metal salts, deoperfumes, and/or microbicides, including particularly bactericides, such as chlorinated aromatics, including biguanide derivatives, of which materials known as triclosan eg Igasan DP300   TM Tricloban ™, and Chlorhexidine<br><br>
warrant specific mention.  A yet another class comprises biguanide salts such as those available under the trade mark Cosmosil ™.<br>
A yet further class of antimicrobial which can advantageously be employed herein comprises transition metal chelators, such as amino acids or salts thereof, which chelators have affinity for iron (III), and preferably a binding constant for iron (III) of greater than 1010, or, for optimum performance, greater than 1025.  The  iron (III) binding constant' referred to above is the absolute stability constant 'for the chelator-iron (III) complex.  One especially preferred chelator is DT?A (diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid) and salts thereof.  Such antimicrobials suppress microbial regrowth.  A convenient amount is from 0.35 to 2% by weight.<br>
Other optional ingredients include wash-off agents, often present in an amount of up to 10% w/w to assist in the removal of the formulation from skin or clothing.  Such wash-off' agents  are  typically nonionic surfactants -such  as esters or ethers containing a C8 to C22 alkyl moiety and a hydrophilic moiety which can comprise a polyoxyalkylene  group (POE or POP) and/or a polyol.<br>
e compositions herein can incorporate one or more cosmetic  adjuncts conventionally contemplatable for antiperspirant<br><br>
 solids or soft solids.  Such cosmetic adjuncts can include kin feel improvers, such as talc or finely divided polyethylene, for example in an amount of up to about 10%; skin benefit agents such as allantoin or lipids, for example<br><br>
in an amount of up to 5%; colours; skin cooling agents other than the already mentioned alcohols, such a menthol and menthol derivatives, often in an amount of up to 2%, all of these percentages being by weight of the composition.  A commonly employed adjunct is a perfume, which is normally present at a concentration of from 0 to 4% and in many formulations from 0-25 to 2% by weight of the composition.<br>
A further optional constituent of the formulation comprises one or more secondary structurants which can be employed in addition to the esterified saccharide of the present invention.  The amount of such secondary. structurants in the formulation is often zero, and usually not more than 15% of the formulation.  In many embodiments, it is normally not greater than the amount of the primary structurant.<br>
The secondary structurants employable herein can be non-polymeric or polymeric.  Solid linear fatty alcohol and/or a wax may be included but are not preferred.  Non-polymeric structurants, sometimes referred to as gellants, can be selected.:from .fatty  cids or  salts thereof-, such as stearic acid or sodium stearate or 12-hydroxy, stearic acid.  Other suitable gellants car  comprise dibenzylidene alditols, e.g. dibenzylidene sorbitol.  Further suitable gellants can comprise lanosterol, selected N-acyl amino acid derivatives, including ester and aunide derivatives, such as N-lauroyl glutamic acid dibutylamide, which gellants can be contemplated-in-conjunction with 12-hydroxy stearic acid or an ester or amide derivative thereof.  Still further gellants include amiqe derivatives of di or tribasic<br><br>
carboxylic acids, such as alkyl N,N' dialkylsuccinamides, e.g. dodecyl N,N  dibutylsuccinamide.<br>
Polymeric structurants which can be employed can comprise organo polysiloxane elastomers such as reaction products of a vinyl terminated polysiloxane and a cross linking agent or alkyl or alkyl polyoxyalkylene-terminated poly (methyl substituted) or poly (phenyl substituted) siloxanes  A number of polyamides have also been disclosed as structurants for hydrophobic liquids.  Polymers containing both siloxane and hydrogen bonding groups, which might be used as secondary structurants, have been disclosed in WO 97/36572 and WO 99/06473.  If an aqueous disperse phase is present, polyacrylamides, poiyacrylates or polyalkylene oxides may be used to structure or thicken this aqueous phase.<br>
One especially desirable secondary structurant comprises an esterified cellobiose as described in PCT/G3 00/01228, which description is incorporated herein.  Such a structurant is sometimes  called an-AGB structurant herein.  Preferably, the ACS structurant can be represented bv the formula:-<br><br>
in which R is as defined hereinabove in respect of the invention structurants and X represents either hydroxyl or an acyl group R-CO-.  More preferably, the acyl group -COR<br><br>
is at least 50% and especially at least 75% of X.  In such ACB structurants, the alkyl group R is preferably octyl or nonyl or preferably may comprise mixtures of R groups having up to 2 fewer or 2 more carbons than an average of 8 to 9 carbons.  The substituent -OX is present at the anomeric carbon in the cellobiose.  The ACB structurant can be made in either a or p anomers. Highly desirably, the proportion of a.  anomer in the ACB structurant is greater than 50%, particularly greater than 80% and especially greater than 90%.<br>
Herein, the ACB structurant can be employed advantageously with the primary invention structurant (CHME) in a wide ratio of amounts, such as in a weight ratio thereto of up to 25:1, and in many instances up to 15:1, and in the same or other embodiments in the range of from 1:25, or sometimes from 1:5 or from 1:1.  A convenient weight ratio of ACB to CHME is from 5 :1 to 12 :1.  In some particularly desirable formulat ions, the weight ratio of ACB to CHME is from 65:35 to 85:15.<br>
In a number of very suitable formulations, the ACB is selected from cellobiose octadecanoate esters, ewspecially those of which at least 80 molar%, eg 80 to 95 molar% are the a anomer.  In some of such -very suitable formulations and in various other suitable formulations, the CHME ester comprises a cellobiose heptanodecanoate monobenzoate ester, and particularly such a CHME which is at least 90 molar% (3 anomer, such as 93 to 100 molar% (3 anomer.<br><br>
Translucent/Transparent Compositions<br><br>
When a composition of this invention is formulated as an emulsion it is possible to construct the formulation such that the emulsion is translucent or transparent.  In order to do this the refractive indices of the water-immiscible continuous phase and the polar or aqueous disperse phase must be matched to each other and the value of refractive index at which they are matched must also approximately match the refractive index of the structurant.<br>
The refractive index of a fibrous network of a structurant can be determined by using that structurant to gel a number of oils or oil mixtures of differing refractive index.  The invention acylated cellobiose (CKME) fibrous networks have a refractive index which falls in a range between 1.45 and 1.51 at 22°C.<br>
For the continuous phase, silicon-free water-immiscible liquid oils described hereinbefore generally have refractive indices  in a range from 1 43 to 1. 49-at  22°€ and  can be-used alone or mixed together to give a silicon-free carrier liquid with refractive index in this range.  Volatile silicone oils generally have a refractive index slightly below 1.40 at 22°C and some non-volatile silicone oils, eg dimetnicone oils, similarly have a refractive index of about 1.41 at 22°C, but carrier liquid mixtures with refractive indices' in the  range from 1.41 to 1.46 can be obtained by mixing volatile or such non-volatile silicone with other oils.  Other non-volatile silicone oils containing aryl substitution generally have refractive indices of at least<br><br>
1.45, for example from 1.45 to 1.48 at 22°C, the oils bearing a high ratio of phenyl substituents to alkyl subs.tituents can enjoy a higher refractive index than 1.48, such as from 1.49 to 1.56.  Such other aforementioned non¬volatile silicone oils can be included when desired to achieve a carrier liquid mixture having a desired refractive index.<br>
The RI of the structured continuous phase will conveniently be very close to the RI of the carrier liquid (usually a carrier liquid mixture) which is its principal component.<br>
For the disperse phase, a solution of an antiperspirant active salt in water alone will generally display a refractive index below 1.425.  The refractive index can be raised by incorporating a diol or polyol into the aqueous solution.  It is believed to be beneficial to match the refractive index of a polar disperse phase to that of a structurant network within a continuous phase.  Moreover, it can be achieved without using so much diol or polyol as will make the composition excessively sticky.<br>
Mechanical Properties and Product Packages<br>
The compositions of this invention are structured liquids and may be firm or soft in appearance.  Even a soft solid has an ability to sustain its own shape, for instance if it is-removed- from a mould without being subjected to shear it will retain its shape for at least 3 0 seconds, usually longer.<br><br>
A composition of this invention will usually be marketed as a product comprising a container with a quantity of the composition therein, where the container has at least one aperture for the delivery of composition, and means for urging the composition in the container towards the delivery aperture.  Conventional containers take the form of a barrel of oval cross section with the delivery aperture(s) at one end of the barrel.<br>
A composition of this invention may be sufficiently rigid that it is not apparently deformable by hand pressure and is suitable for use as a stick product in which a quantity of the composition in the form of a stick is accommodated within a container barrel having an open end at which an end portion of the stick of composition is exposed for use.  The opposite end of the barrel is closed.<br>
Generally the container will include a cap for its open end and a component part which is sometimes referred to as an elevator or piston fitting within the barrel and capable of relative .axia-1 movement along it.  The stdck of composition is accommodated in the barrel between the piston and the open end of the barrel.  The piston is used to urge the stick of composition along the barrel.  The piston and stick of composition may be moved axially along the barrel by manual pressure on the underside of the piston using a finger or rod inserted within the barrel.  Another possibility is that arod attached to the piston projects through a slot or slots in the barrel and is used to  move the piston and stick.  Preferably the container also includes a transport mechanism for moving the piston<br><br>
comprising a threaded rod which extends axially into the stick through a correspondingly threaded aperture in the piston, and means mounted on the barrel for rotating the rod.  Conveniently the rod is rotated by means of a hand-wheel mounted on the barrel at its closed end, i.e. the opposite end to the delivery opening.<br>
If a composition of this invention is softer, but still capable of sustaining its own shape it will be more suited for dispensing from a barrel with a closure instead of an open end, where the closure has one or more apertures through which composition from the barrel can be extruded. The number and design of such apertures is at the discretion of the designer of the package.<br>
The component parts of such containers are often made from thermoplastic materials, for example polypropylene or polyethylene.  Descriptions of suitable containers, some of which include further features, are found in US patents 4865231, 5000356 and 5573341.<br>
Having described the invention in general terms. specific embodiments thereof will be described more fully by way of example only.<br>

which was carried out by one of three routes.  The route is exemplified for cellobiose heptanonanoate esters.  Other acylated cellobiose esters were made by substituting the same molar amounts of alternative acylating agents for nonanoic acid.<br>
Step 1, Preparation of cellobiose octanonanoate Cellobiose was esterified with nonanoic acid to yield the fully esterified product in the form of its a-anomer following a procedure generally as described in Takada et al, Liquid Crystals, Volume 19, No 4, page 441 (1995).<br>
The following materials, obtained from Acros Organics -<br>
Fisher Scientific, were used:<br>
D-(+)-cellobiose, 20 grams, 0.058 moles<br>
Nonanoic acid, 591.6 grams, 3.74 moles<br>
Trifluoroacetic anhydride, 297.6 grams, 1.42 moles.<br>
The nonanoic acid was charged into a 2 litre flange pot equipped with an overhead stirrer, water condenser and addition inlet  together with the  trrfluor Gametic  anhydride. The resultant clear mixture was stirred up and heated to 1002C using a silicone oil bath and temperature probe. During heating it was noted that the colour of the reaction mixture darkened and developed a dark brown tinge.  After allowing the mixture to stir for one hour at 1002C, the cellobiose was slowly added via a solid powder funnel to the dark activated solution, and a dirty brown suspension was formed which re-dissolved forming a clear black solution within 10-20 minutes.<br><br>
The'reaction flask was then maintained at 100oC for a total of 6 hours then cooled down to ambient laboratory temperature.  Next the contents of the flask were transferred into 2 litres of methanol containing 10% de-ionised water in an ice-cooled 5 litre beaker.  Immediately an off-white solid precipitate came out of solution, this was filtered off and collected.  The crude solid was recrystallised a total of 4 times from a<br>
tetrahydrofuran/methanol solution producing a white solid product.<br>
The product was obtained in a quantity of 31.5g which was a 37% yield.  It had a melting point of 110oC <br>
Step 2, partial de-acylation<br>
Glacial acetic acid (2.04g) was added slowly dropwise with stirring into a solution of ethylenediamine (4.09g) in tetrahydrofuran (THF, 850cm3) .  A white precipitate formed which remained during the reaction.  a-Cellobiose octanonanoate (50g) was then added and the whole reaction mixture1 stirred at room temperature- for- a* total of'* 48* hours.<br>
At the end of the reaction period, the contents of the flask were transferred to a two litre separating funnel, 350cm3 of water was added and the mixture extracted with dichloromethane (2 50cm3).  The organic layer was collected and further washed with successive 350cm3 portions of (1) dilute HC1 (0.1M)  (2)' aqueous sodium bicarbonate (1M) and (3) water.<br><br>
The resultant organic phase was recovered, dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate, filtered and the remaining solvent removed by rotary evaporation,  A slightly sticky off-white crude solid was obtained. This was then re-crystallised from a mixture of THF/methanol (50:300cm3). During overnight storage, a white solid precipitated out and was filtered off, dried and collected, yielding 30.5g of a white free-flowing solid as intermediate product (68% Yield).<br>

3A-  Re-acylation with an acyl chloride<br>
This route is exemplified for the benzoate ester, and is useable for all the esters by substituting the other acid chlorides for benzoyl chloride.<br>
A 3 neck 500cm3 round bottomed flask was charged with cellobiose heptanonanoate (5g, 3 .78xl0~3moles) together with 125cm3 of toluene.  The mixture was stirred thoroughly until a clear solution resulted. Next triethylamine (0.479g, 4.73xlO3 TOoles )  was  slowly added" dropwise to the solution.<br>
Thereafter, Benzoyl Chloride (0.665g, 4.73xl0-3moles) was added slowly and cautiously via a pressure equalising dropping funnel into the reaction mix.  When addition of the reagents was complete, the whole reaction solution was heated up to and maintained under reflux conditions for a total of 2-3hrs.  The flask was then removed from the heat and after cooling was filtered to remove the solid triethylamine hydrochloride salt present.  A clear straw<br><br>
coloured liquid was- obtained.  All solvent was then removed by rotary evaporation to give a crude product, a straw coloured gel-like material.  The crude product was re-crystallised from THF-MeOH (20cm3:12 0cm3) .  The resultant product, a white free-flowing solid, was filtered off, collected and dried at 40-45°C.  Yield was 3.5g (65%)<br>
3B  Re-acylation employing an acid/catalyst<br>
This method is exemplified using benzoic acid and can also be used for making the other cellobiose esters by replacing benzoic acid by the appropriate acid.<br>
A 2 neck 250cm3 round bottomed flask was charged with Benzoic Acid (29.54g, 0.24moles) and trifluoroacetic anhydride(19.05g, 0.091moles).  The mixture was stirred and heated to and maintained at 100°C for one hour.  Cellobiose heptanonanoate (5g, 3 .78xl0~3moles) was introduced slowly via a solids addition funnel into the activated solution.  After it had added completely, the reaction mixture was maintained at 100=C stirred fdr a total of 6' hours.  The reaction flask was then cooled down to room temperature.  An ice-cooled solution of methanol-water (400cm3 MeOH:40cm3 water) was poured into the flask, whereupon a solid precipitate formed immediately, was filtered off and re-crystallised from TKF-MeOH (2 0cm3:12 0cm3) .  The resultant product was filtered off collected and re-crystallised a second time from THF-MeOH to remove trace acid.  The final product, a white solid, was filtered off, collected and dried at 40-45°C. The yield was 3.1g (53%)<br><br>
3C   Re-acylation using an anhydride<br>
The method is exemplified using acetic anhydride and the other cellobiose esters can be made by substituting the appropriate anhydride for acetic anhydride.<br>
A 3 neck 500cm3 round bottomed flask was charged with cellobiose heptanonanoate (5g, 3 .78xl0~3moles) and toluene<br>
(50 cm3) .  The mixture was stirred, creating a pale yellow clear solution.  Acetic anhydride (1.16g, 1.13xl0"2moles) was added slowly via a pressure equalising dropping funnel. When its addition was complete, the reaction mixture was heated up to 120°C and refluxed for 6hrs.  The mixture was cooled down to room temperature and all solvent removed by-rotary evaporation to yield a crude gel-like solid, which was filtered off and re-crystallised from THF-MeOH<br>
(20cm3:12ocm3) , filtered off, and dried at 40-45°C. Yield:-4.4g (85%) .<br>
In Table 1, the substituent listed is at the anomeric carbon, and the %Y listed is the proportion of the anomeric OK which has been converted  to   the-  specified acyl group.<br>
The %A (a anomer) and %y (extent of acylation at the anomeric carbon) can be determined by proton NMR spectroscopy, using a Bruker DRX 500MHz NMR Spectrometer. The samples were run in 99.8 atom % D-Chloroform (CDC13) solvent containing 0-03% TetramethylSilane (TMS).<br>
In the spectra obtained for acylated cellobiose using proton NMR spectroscopy, the alpha and the beta anomeric forms have distinct peaks at distinct chemical shifts.  The location of<br><br>
the peaks also depends on whether the anomeric carbon is substri-txitedrby hydroxyl or by an acyl group.  A doublet at low field is due to the proton on the anomeric carbon of the alpha-anomer (J axial-equa= 3.8HZ; 6.26ppm) when the anomeric carbon has been acylated , whereas the corresponding doublet is at a chemical shift of 5.3 6ppm when its substituent is hydroxy1.  Correspondingly, the spectrum comprises a set of doublets at a higher field due to the proton on the anomeric carbon of the beta anomer (J axial-axial 7.9HZ; 5.65 ppm) when the anomeric carbon is acylated and at a chemical shift of 4.82ppm when the anomeric carbon is merely hydroxyl substituted.  A linear comparison of fche peak areas enables the relative proportions of the two anomers to be determined.<br>
The ability of proton NMR spectroscopy to distinguish between acylated cellobiose molecules in which uhe cellobiose anomeric carbon is substituted by an hydroxyl or acyl group can be enhanced by employing a method in which the spectrum of the as-made sample is taken, the hydroxyl group in the  sample  is reacted  with trlchloroacetyl   isocyanate (TCAI) and the spectrum of the sample is taken again.  Trie chemical shift for TCAI-adducted alpha molecule is 6.33ppm and for TCAI-adducted beta molecule is 5.73ppm. 3y comparing the peak areas of the spectra, the relative proportions of the alpha plus beta hydroxyl, alpha acylated, and beta acylated molecules can be determined.<br><br>

Example 3<br>
In this Example, further esters were made comprising cellobiose heptanonanoate and a different ester group at the anomeric position.  The process comprised a variation of the three stage process described in Example 1 above, the principal differences being indicated herein.<br>
In stage 1,   a base catalyst was employed, producing B-D-cellobiose octanonanoate.<br>
D-{+)cellobiose (ACROS; 99% HPLC; 67 % p anomer), nonanoyl acid chloride (83g, 0.47 mol), 96% ALDRICH, (assay; GC: 97.4% with remainder of 2-methyloctanoyl chloride); dry chloroform 99+% (Sure Seal™ bottle, reagent grade, ALDRICH), dry pyridine 99.8+% (sure seal bottle, reagent grade ALDRICH), tetrahydrofuran (Fisher, reagent grade) and methanol (FISHER, reagent grade) were used as received.<br><br>
A 250 ml three round'bottom flask was fitted with a double surface condenser, a pressure equalising funnel and an over head stirrer. All glassware had previously been dried over night at 105°C.<br>
Clear, very faintly yellow nonanoyl chloride (83.2g, 0.47 mol) was added dropwise slowly, taking between 15 and 30 minutes with constant stirring to a solution of cellobiose (10g, 0.029 mol) in dry chloroform (40 mis) and dry pyridine (20 mis) at 50°C.   The resultant heterogeneous pale yellow mixture was allowed to react for at 50°C under inert atmosphere and vigorous stirring until monitoring via proton NMR and HPLC indicated that no hepta-substituted cellobiose was present, a period of about 20 hours.<br>
The heterogeneous light yellow mixture was cooled down to room temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was poured into methanol (1000 mis) and stirred for about 15 minutes, producing a precipitate which was recoved by filtration, washed with 50 rals fresh methanol and dried in a vacuum oven (0.8-mbar., 8 0 Pa )  at  40- to 45°C for 5  hours,    39 g of a white solid was recovered.<br>
The white solid was recrystallised three times from a tetrahydrofuran/methanol mixture (75/200mls), filtered, washed with 50 ml of methanol and dried in a vacuum oven for 5 hours at 40-45°C.  18 g of a white solid (42%) was obtained. -       <br><br>
In stage 2, the process of stage 2 of Example 1 was repeated, but on a l/5ch scale.  The reaction mixture was maintained at 40°C for a total of 7 hours.  The recovered recrystallised precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 40oc for between 5 and 6 hours under a pressure between 0.8 to 1.0 mbar (80 to 100 Pa).<br>
In Stage 3, the process of stage 3A of Example 1 was repeated, except that the triethylamine and the acyl chloride were each employed at a mole ratio of 2.5:1 to the cellobiose heptanonanoate.   The recovered recrystallised precipitate was dried in a vacuum oven at 40°c for between 5 and 6 hours under a pressure between 0.8 to 1.0 mbar.<br>
The extent of acylation, and proportion of a and (3 anomers were measured as in Example 1, and the results summarised in Table 4 below.<br>

Example 4<br>
In this Example, various samples of esterified cellobiose prepared as in Example 1 or 2 above, were used to gel water-immiscible cosmetic liquids, in accordance with the procedure given below, in which a large number of gels can be prepared simultaneously.<br>
The samples were tested in a 96 well (8 x 12 rows) glass micro-titre plate.  Each well had a volume of about 1ml. About 0.01 or u.02g of each esterified cellobiose material was placed into 8 consecutive wells in a single row, so that each well contained approximately 5% or 10% of the cellobiose ester.  The balance in each well comprised the cosmetic liquid by addition of approximately 0.2g of the respective liquid to each cell.  A glass lid was placed on top of the plate.  The plate was carefully placed in a thermostatically controlled fan-assisted oven set at 150°C for 2.5 hours.  The plate was removed from the oven and allowed to cool naturally to ambient laboratory temperature. The contents of the wells were assessed at the end of the cooling period, by visual inspection and by poking the contents of each well with a micro-spatula.  The plates were stored at 18°C for 18 hours and the contents inspected, and further stored for 18 hours at 4°C and inspected'for a third time.  The results obtained in the tests are summarised in Table 5 below, in which the legend is as follows: gel gel<br>

From Table 5, it can be seen that the CHME esters were particularly suited to gelling silicone oils, hydrocarbon oils, ethers and liquid fatty alcohols.<br>
Example 5<br>
In this Example the Fibre dissolution temperature (FDT)	is<br>
measured in the DSC process described later herein,	by<br>
observing when the fibres dissolve whilst the temperature	of<br>
sample rises.  FDT- is taken to be the peak temperature	of<br>
the highest peak.<br>
The results are summarised in Table 6 below in which Anomeric description indicates the a β ratio and the acyl substituent at the anomeric carbon.  In REF2 and REF3, the acyl substituents at the other seven cellobiose sites are nonanoyl.<br>

From Table 6, two deductions can be made.  First, the fibre dissolution,, temperature of the structurants according to the instant invention are higher than the reference structurants, indicating that the thermal stability*<br><br>
(stability to melting) of a gel obtained using that invention structurant is higher.<br>
Secondly, the solubility of the invention structurants at 25°C tends to be lower than that of the reference structurants.  The inventors have found such lower solubility indicates that the resistance of the structurant to crystallisation during storage of gels is improved.<br>
DSC Method<br>
Samples of gel (about 20 mg) were sealed in stainless steel capsules for DSC.  An empty stainless steel capsule was used as the physical reference.  The samples were subjected to the following temperature programme:<br>
The sample was heated to 100°C and held at 100°C for 1 minute, in order to obtain an isotropic solution.  The sample was then cooled at 5 K/min to -20°C.  The sample was held at -20°C. for 1 minute  The  sample .is  now   a. gel on the bottom of the sample capsule prepared  in a reproducible manner.  The gel was then heated at 5 K/min to 100°C. Data was also obtained with empty stainless steel pans as both physical sample and reference.  This blank data was later subtracted from the sample data to remove any curvature in the base line.<br><br>
Example. 6-<br>
Stability Testing<br>
Gels were made up using 10% structurant in a 50:40 mixture of Hydrogenated Polyisobutene (Panalene L14E)-.DC245.  The gels, in sealed glass bottles, were left to stand for 18hrs at room temperature, after which they were transferred to an oven thermostatically controlled to 37°C, Samples were checked periodically for signs of crystal growth visible by eye.  REFl is cellobiose octanonanoate.  The results are summarised in Table 7 below.<br><br>

Table 7 shows that there is a distinct advantage for the invention structurants over both REFl and REF2 in terms of resistance to crystallisation during storage.<br>
Example 7 m^^„  w-<br>
This Example shows some benefits obtainable by employing a fraction of a structurant in accordance with the present invention in conjunction with a structurant exemplified or described in PCT/GB 00/01228.<br>
In this Example, 60:40 hydrogenated polydecene:DC245 was gelled with a combination of 9 % cellobiose octanonanoate (87.5% a, code REF2) and 1% of the specified cellobiose ester.  The transparency and light transmission of the samples are summarised in Table 8, in which %T is the % light transmitted at a wavelength of 580nm.<br><br>

From Table 8, if can be seen that the addition of the invention structurants tended to produce a gel that was visually a little better in that the panel score was higher than when the reference structurants were added.  This is confirmed by the %T data, light transmission, which similarly showed a similar and for most, a higher light transmission.<br>
Visual assessment score<br>
A gel contained within a 1cm thick cuvette was placed directly on to a sheet of white paper on which 21 sets of figures where printed in black. The size and thickness of the figures varied systematically and were numbered from -12 (the largest, thickest set) through 0 to 8 (the smallest thinnest set) The score given to each gel was the highest numbered set which could be read clearly through the gel, the higher the number, the higher the clarity.<br>
Light transmission<br>
The' translucen'cy "of' a composition may be measured by placing a sample of standardised thickness in- the light path of a spectrophotometer and measuring trar.smittence, as a percentage of light transmitted in -he absence of the gel.<br>
This test was carried out using a dual-beam<br>
spectrophotometer.  The _sample of composition was poured hot into a 4.5 ml cuvette made of poly (methyl-methacrylate) (PMMA) and allowed to cool to an ambient temperature of 2 0-25°C.  Such a cuvette gives a 1 cm thickness of composition. Measurement was carried out at 580 um, with an identical bu~<br><br>
empty cuvette in the reference beam of the<br>
spectrophotometer, after the sample in the cuvette had been held for 24 hours.  A transmittence measured at any temperature in the range from 20-25°C is usually adequately accurate, but measurement is made at 22°C if more precision is required.<br>
Example 8<br>
In this Example, the fibre dissolution temperature, the % light transmission and visual clarity assessments were made in respect of cellobiose heptanonanoate monocyclohexanoate made in Example 1 or 3, using the methods described in Examples 5 and 7.  The gels were prepared in a 60:40 w/w mixture of hydrogenated polydecene:volatile silicone (Silkflo 3 64:DC245).  The results are summarised in Table 9 below.<br>

From Table 10, it can be seen that the addition of the invention structurants tended to produce a gel that was visually much better in that the visual assessment was higher than when the reference structurants were added. This is confirmed by the %T data, light transmission, which similarly showed a much higher light transmission.<br><br>
Example 10<br>
In this Examples, gels are prepared as in Example 9, but employing various weight ratios of ACB structurant REF4 and the invention ester produced in Example 2.6 to a total weight of 10% in a 60:40 w/w mixture of hydrogenated polydecene:volatile silicone (Silkflo 364NF:DC245).  The results are summarised in Table 11 below.<br>

From Table 11, it can be seen that the clarity of the gels comprising a mixture of CHME (invention) ester and the reference product were superior to zhe  gel employing solely the invention ester or the reference product R2F4.  The best clarity was achieved when an excess proportion of the ACB<br><br>
structurant ester was employed, and particularly in the ratio range for CHME: ACB of 35:65 to 15:85.<br>
Example 11<br>
In this Example, Example 10 was repeated, but employing reference ester REF2 and a CHME ester, the product of Ex 1.12 or Ex 1.13.  The results are summarised in Table 12 below.<br>

From Table 11, it can be seen tihat even when the reference (ACB) ester provided a translucent gel, it was possible to select combinations of the CHME and ACB esters which gave improved clarity, and particularly in the eight ratio range of from 35:65 to 15:85 of CHME:ACB esters.<br><br>
Example 12<br>
Gels were made up and tested in accordance with the procedure in Example 6, as such or modified by employing a weight ratio of 9% of REFl and 1% of an additional structurant as specified in Table 13 below.<br><br>

Table 13 shows that there is significant improvement in stability as a  result of adding a proportion of the structurant of the instant invention to the structurant of PCT/GB 00/01228.  Likewise, there is a benefit for adding the invention products compared with adding refererce product R3F3 to the structurant of PCT/GB 00/01228.<br>
Example 13<br>
The test procedure of Example 9 was repeated, but using ACB structurant REF2 alone as the structurant or to which a CHMS structurant was added.  The results are summarised in Table 14 below.<br>
Table 14<br><br>
Structurant	Observation<br>
solely R3F2	Slight loss of clarity after 7 days at 37 °C.<br>
Fine crystals on  surface after 8 davs at 37 °C.<br>
Fine needle crystals throughout gel after 9 days at 37 °C.<br>
More needle crystals in gel bulk and crystal mass on  surface after 1.3 days at 37 °C.<br>

+ prcducz of Ex 1.10	Some needle crystals on surface after 11 days at 37 °C.<br>
Some needle crystals in gel bulk after 12 days at 37 °C.<br><br>
From. Tables 14,,.. it can ...be seen that the addition of the invention structurants to reference structurant REF2 according to PCT/GB 00/1228 improves the resistance of the structurant to crystallisation during storage.<br>
Example 14<br>
An antiperspirant suspension stick was prepared using a water-immiscible liquid or a mixture of water-immiscible liquids, an antiperspirant active and an esterified cellobiose .  The procedure was as follows:<br>
the mixture of liquids was heated to a temperature 5 to 10aC above a temperature at which the esterified cellobiose had been observed to dissolve in a preliminary test.  During this heating the liquid was mixed gently using a Silverson mixer.  The esterified cellobiose was added and allowed to dissolve.  Next, the particulate antiperspirant active was added to this solution.  The resulting mixture was then allowed to cool (or, if necessary, heated) whilst mixing gently until it'reached a' temperature'of'" about 5 to 10°C' above the gelling point.  At this stage the mixture was poured into antiperspirant stick barrels and left to cool without further disturbance until the formulation had solidified.<br>
The resulting sticks were evaluated afcer at least 24 hours at ambient laboratory temperature, the appearance of the stick was noted, the hardness was determined by penetrometer, and tests of deoosition and whiteness of the<br><br>
resulting- depasit  were carried out using the procedures described hereinafter.  The results are summarised in Table 15 below.<br>

Example- 16 -<br>
In this Example, an emulsion stick was prepared by mixing cyclomethicone with the other organic liquids including the cetyl dimethicone copolyol which functioned as an emulsifier (silicone surfactant) and the mixture was heated with gentle stirring to a temperature 5 to 10°C above the temperature at which the structurant had been found to dissolve.  The esterified cellobiose was then added and allowed to dissolve.<br>
The disperse phase (also referred to as internal phase) was an aluminium zirconium active dissolved in water or in a mixture of a polyol and water.  This disperse phase was pre¬heated to the same temperature as the organic oils containing the esterified cellobiose and added slowly to them over a period of one minute while mixing with a Silverson mixer.  After addition was complete the formulation was mixed at higher speed for five minutes. Stirring speed was then reduced for a further one minute after which the mixture was poured into stick barrels and allowed to cool undisturbed' to ambient laboratory temperature.  The sticks were tested by penetrometer, and for whiteness of deposits, in each instance by the test procedures given earlier.  The results are summarised in Table 17 below.<br><br>

From Table 17, it can be seen that the emulsion stick produced according to Example 11 had acceptable hardness and particularly low visible deposits and has high visual clarity.,<br>
Further emulsion sticks having acceptable hardness and low visible deposits are made by substituting the structurant made in each of Examples 1.1 to 1.9 or 1.11 or 2.1 to 2.5 for that made in Ex 1.10 or by substituting up to 90% of the v/eight of the structurant by R3F1 or REF2 or REF4 described hereinabove.<br><br>
Example 17<br>
In this Example, further emulsion sticks were prepared by the method of Example 16, with the compositions, rounded to 1 decimal place and properties as summarised in Table 18 below.  The melt characteristics and the crystallisation stability of many of the sticks were also measured and are summarised in Table 20 below.  The description of any crystals visible under an intense light source relates to the specified period at which the stick was translucent.<br><br>

Side by side comparison of the Example 17 and Comparison 17C formulations shows that the comparison formulations melted at a lower temperature and became opaqae and mottled during storage periods at which the invention formulations were still translucent, thereby demonstrating the superior stability of the invention formulations.  The crystallisation test does not indicate the maximum period of time for which any of the invention formulations could remain translucent,<br><br>
In a specific protocol for this test measurements on a stick were performed in the stick barrel.  The stick was wound up to project from the open end of the barrel, and then cut off to leave a flat, uniform surface.  The needle was carefully lowered to the stick surface, and then a penetration hardness measurement was conducted.  This process was carried out at six different points on the stick surface. The hardness reading quoted is the average value of the 6 measurements.<br>
ii)  Deposition and whiteness of deposit<br>
Another test of the properties of a composition is the amount of the composition which is delivered onto a surface when the composition is drawn across that surface (representing the application of a stick product to human skin).  To carry out this test of deposition, a sample of the composition with standardised shape and size is fitted to apparatus which draws the sample across a test surface under standardised conditions.  The amount transferred to the surface is determined as an increase in the weight of the substrate to which it is applied.  If desired the colour, opacity or clarity of the deposit may subsequently be determined.<br>
A specific procedure for such tests used apparatus to apply a deposit from a stick onto a substrate under standardised conditions and then measures the mean level of white deposits using image analysis.<br>
The substrate used was<br><br>
12 x 28cm strip of- black Worsted wool fabric.<br>
The substrates were weighed before use.  The sticks were previously unused and with domed top surface unaltered.<br>
The apparatus comprised a flat base to which a flat substrate was attached by a clip at each end.  A pillar having a mounting to receive a standard size stick barrel was mounted on an arm that was moveable horizontally across che substrate by means of a pneumatic piston.<br>
Each stick was kept, at ambient laboratory temperature overnight before the measurement was made.  The stick was advanced to project a measured amount from the barrel.  The barrel was then placed in the apparatus and a spring was positioned to biased the stick against the substrate with a standardised force. The apparatus was operated to pass the stick laterally across the substrate eight'times.  The substrate was carefully removed from the rig and reweighed.<br>
Whiteness, of,. Deposit,<br>
The deposits from the previous test were assessed for their whiteness after an interval of 24 hours approximately.<br>
This was done using a Sony XC77 monochrome video camera with a Cosmicar 15mra focal length lens positioned vertically above a black table- illuminated from a high angle using fluorescent tubes to remove shadowing.  The apparatus was initially calibrated using a reference grey card, after the fluorescent tubes had been turned on for long enough to give<br><br>
because it no  instance  was  it continued until an invention stick became opaque.<br>
Measurement of Properties<br>
i)   Hardness of stick using a penetrometer The hardness and rigidity of a composition which is a firm solid can be determined by penetrometry.  If the composition is a softer solid, this will be observed as a substantial lack of any resistance to the penetrometer probe.<br>
A suitable procedure is to utilises a lab plant PNT<br>
penetrometer equipped with a Seta wax needle (weight 2,5<br>
grams) which has a cone angle at the point of the needle<br>
specified to be 9°10" ± 15". A sample of the composition<br>
with a flat upper surface is used. The needle is lowered.<br>
onto the surface of the composition and then a penetration<br>
hardness measurement is conducted by allowing the needle<br>
with its holder to drop under a total weight, (i.e. the<br>
combined weight of needle and holder) of 50 grams for a<br>
period of five seconds after which the depth of penetration<br>
is noted.  Desirably the test is carried out at a number of<br>
points on each sample and the results are averaged.<br>
Utilising a test of this nature, an appropriate hardness for<br>
use in an open-ended dispensing container is a penetration<br>
of less than 3 0 mm in this test, for example in a range from<br>
2 to 3 0 mm.  Preferably the penetration is in a range from<br>
5mm to 20 mm.	<br><br>
a steady light output.  A cloth with a deposit thereon from the previous test was placed on the table and the camera was used to capture an image.  An area of the image of the deposit was selected and analysed using a Kontron IBAS image analyser.  This notionally divided the image into a large array of pixels and measured the grey level of each pixel on a scale of 0 (black) to 255 (white).  The average of the grey intensity was calculated.  This was a measure of the whiteness of the deposit, with higher numbers indicating a whiter deposit.  It was- assumed that low numbers show a clear deposit allowing the substrate colour to be seen.<br>
iii) Melting of Stick<br>
A sample stick in its conventional open-mouthed dispensing container was placed in a constant temperature chamber that was maintained for a cycle of 48 hours to enable any change in its condition to develop.  The temperature was raised by a 2°C or 5°C increment before each succeeding cycle.  The stick was observed at the end of each cycle, and the temperature noted at which a change in appearance was visible.<br>
iv)  Crystallisation Stability at 45°C<br>
In a test for determining the stability of ester-structured antiperspirant sticks at an elevated temperature, the sample stick was placed in a  constant temperature chamber that was maintained at 45°C.  The sticks were observed weekly, to<br><br>
determine whether they were still translucent or whether their  appearance  had altered.  An intense light was shone on the sticks and a visual check was made as to whether any crystals or domains were visible.  In several instances, the test on a stick was halted if it was still translucent when a similar comparison stick had become opaque, or shortly afterwards.<br><br>
