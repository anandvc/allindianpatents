				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a system for holding an abrasive medium to a tool and in<br>
particular, though not solely, the invention relates to a system for effectively<br>
holding an abrasive medium to a sanding hand tool.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Sanding tools are used widely and available in a variety of shapes and sizes to<br>
suit their particular application or desired use. In general, it may be said that there<br>
are three main configurations utilised to locate and hold an abrasive material such<br>
as sandpaper in position against a supporting tool body (which may be a power<br>
tool or hand tool). These three types can be classified according to the following<br>
descriptions:<br>
1. screw down clips or clamps to allow an abrasive material, such as<br>
sandpaper to be wrapped around the ends of the tool and clamped onto<br>
the tool by such screw-down clips or clamps, ,,<br>
2. hook and loop systems (such as VELCRO®) with either hooks or loops<br>
provided on a base of the tool body and loops or hooks provided on the<br>
back surface of the sandpaper; or<br>
3. various foam pads glued to a base of the body of the tool (i.e. the abrasive<br>
support portion of the tool) where the exposed or 'skin' side of the foam<br>
has applied thereto abrasives by, for example, pressure sensitive adhesive<br>
to allow it to stick to the foam. Foam pads may be made, for example,<br>
from Ethyl Vinyl Acetate (EVA) and may be incorporated in sanding tools<br>
having screw down clips of clamps or hook and loop fastening systems.<br>
Foam pads provide a cushion between the tool and the surface to be<br>
sanded.<br>
Problems exist with current sanding tool design, in paricular as the types of tool<br>
configurations requiring screw-down clips or clamps for holding the abrasive<br>
material in place do not tend to facilitate simple abrasive material attachment. In<br>
addition, the present abrasive material holder systems generally make fitting of<br>
abrasive material a slow and fiddly process, and screw-down clamp type systems<br>
can result in wastage of abrasive material when attempting to ensure correct fitting<br>
of the material.<br>
The hook and loop system of holding the abrasive material to a sanding tool can<br>
be expensive, and the tool system utilising EVA foam can be problematic due to<br>
foam materials being porous by nature and not therefore conducive to adhering<br>
abrasive material such as sandpaper thereto. It is known that since foams, such<br>
as EVA, are produced from moulds and subsequently cut into slabs, a shiny, or<br>
smoother skin surface occurs against the mould surface. This skin material, which<br>
is in general the off-cut from batch EVA production processes is conducive to<br>
adhering abrasive material such as sand paper thereto. The availability of this<br>
EVA skin material is however not currently sufficient to allow production of sanding<br>
tools on an industrial scale.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an abrasive tool or a<br>
system for holding an abrasive medium to a hand tool which will go at least some<br>
way towards overcoming the above disadvantages or which will at least provide<br>
the industry and/or public with a useful choice.<br>
Therefore, it is desirable to provide a system which may be utilised with sanding<br>
tools to provide a surface capable of attaching and providing a good adhesive<br>
surface for the adhesive backed abrasive material sheet whilst also being able to<br>
provide a more economic and/or less awkward system for connecting together a<br>
sanding tool body and an abrasive material sheet.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
With reference to Figures 1A, 1B and 1C there is shown a first embodiment of a<br>
sanding tool incorporating sn abrasive system according to the present invention.<br>
The sanding or abrasive tool includes a handle 1 having a planar support base 2<br>
onto which is attached a foam material 3, for exarvle EVA, polypropylene or<br>
polyethylene or other suitable foam material. A duable film 4 such as EVA,<br>
polypropylene or polyethylene or other plastics film is glued or laminated or<br>
bonded onto the outer face of foam layer 3 and a layer of abrasive material 5 such<br>
as sandpaper is adhered to the film layer 4.<br>
The sandpaper layer 5 may be adhered to the film layer 4 by a pressure sensitive<br>
adhesive applied to the back side of the sandpaper which allows the sandpaper to<br>
stick (and hold fast to) the film 4. The sandpaper layer 5 may also desirably allow<br>
peeling of the sandpaper from film 4 either after use or as and when required such<br>
as when the abrasive material on the front face of the sandpaper is worn down, or<br>
a different grade of sandpaper is required.<br>
With reference to Figures 2a, 2b and 2c, there is shown a second embodiment of<br>
the sanding tool according to the present invention. The second embodiment is<br>
very similar to the first embodiment except for an alternatively shaped handle 1.<br>
Similarly, Figures 3, 3a and 3b illustrate a third embodiment of a sanding tool<br>
according to the present invention, which utilises a swivel handle 13 connected to<br>
a base plate 1 having a planar support base 2 to attach suitable foam material.<br>
Figures 4a, 4b, 4c and 5a, 5b and 5c illustrate fourth and fifth embodiments of<br>
hand-held sander tools which may utilise the foam, film, abrasive material laminate<br>
configuration described with reference to the first to third embodiments but with<br>
alternatively shaped handle and/or support base shapes.<br>
Figures 6a and 6b Illustrate a further embodiment of the present invention<br>
including a handle 1b additionally providing a bendable and adjustable support<br>
base portion 2b onto which is attached suitable foam material 3 (for example EVA<br>
or other suitable foam material) and onto which a suitably durable film 4 may be<br>
glued or laminated. The film 4 is applied to the foam layer 3 to allow abrasive<br>
sandpaper or the like having suitable pressure sensitive or other types of adhesive<br>
applied to one side thereof, to stick and hold the sandpaper to the film 4.<br>
As mentioned previously, the sandpaper/abrasive may also be able to be<br>
releasable from film 4 by peeling said sandpaper therefrom, as and when<br>
required. Adjusting screws 7 are also provided to adjust the convex curve of the<br>
support base 2b for sanding inside curved corners. Attachment of mounting<br>
points 8 may also be provided in such an embodiment, thereby allowing the base<br>
2b to be adjustable in shape, allowing for a flat, convex or concave sanding<br>
surface. The foam (and film layers 4) can in this way be connected in such a way<br>
to a sander tool as to utilise the foam/film layer flexibility and flex the materials<br>
about the base 2b, or any curved position or base 2b shape as dictates by the<br>
adjustable screws 7. The base 2b may also be conected to the hand tool by<br>
points 8 (which may be in the form of a longue-in-groove or key in slot<br>
configuration). Adjustable screws 7 may connect via connection point 10 with an<br>
axle 9 extending substantially the width of the base 2b. The position of such an<br>
axel allows uniform pressure to be maintained along the width edge of the<br>
foam/film/base layers. The connection point 10 may be in the form of a universal<br>
ball joint or similar which allows the base 2b and atachment layers 3,4 to rotate<br>
relative to the body of the tool 16 in sympathy with a surface being sanded.<br>
With reference to Figures 7a and 7b there is shown a further preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention in the form of an abrasive holder handle 1c,<br>
a flat bendable and adjustable base portion 2c on to which is attached suitable<br>
foam material 3 and to which a suitably durable film 4 is glued or laminated.<br>
Abrasive sandpaper 5 may then be adhered to film 4 and preferably be easily<br>
releasable therefrom by peeling as and when required. Adjustment means 11<br>
such as an adjustable screw (similar to adjustable screw 7) may be utilised in a<br>
similar fashion to the embodiment illustrated in figure© 6a, 6b and as previously<br>
described. Such an adjustable screw may be connected to an axle 9 substantially<br>
extending the width of the base 2b via a universal connection joint. In particular<br>
this embodiment of an abrasive tool (and holder) may be utilised for the sanding of<br>
concave surfaces; where screws 7 may be extended to push the base 2b<br>
connected at points 9, 10 away from the tool body 1c, whilst a central portion of<br>
the base 2b remains fixed at 14.<br>
With reference to Figures 8a and 8b there is shown a further embodiment of the<br>
present invention in the form of a file including a handle 12, a fiat stiff or flexible<br>
base 2 to attach suitable foam material 3 (such as FVA or other suitable foam<br>
material) and to which a suitably durable film 4 is glued or applied or laminated.<br>
An abrasive material such as sandpaper 5 is applied to film 4 preferably in such a<br>
way that the sandpaper abrasive is easily releasable from the film 4 by peeling<br>
said off and when required. A suitable flat or handled sanding tool for the purpose<br>
of fifing human naiis, or animal nails or hoofs is thereby provided.<br>
Although not shown, it should be appreciate that the tool could be formed from a<br>
solid or composite body made entirely from EVA, or Polyethylene, or rubber, or<br>
cork, or composite materials, or any otrnr suitable materials, and where a film<br>
layer can be laminated directly to the flat base of the body. Abrasives having<br>
pressure sensitive adhesive applied to one side can then be applied to, and easily<br>
removable from, the film layer. The block of, for example, EVA, could be<br>
moulded to form a handle so that the tool looks much like the tool shown in<br>
Figures 1a to 1c.<br>
In the above described embodiments there is provided a series of sanding tools<br>
having square, rectangular, triangular, oval, or any suitable shaped base to which<br>
a layer of foam such as Ethyl Vinyl Acetate (EVA), or Polyethylene (PE), or any<br>
other suitable foam can be glued. A handle may be attached to the upper side of<br>
the base of the tool by which to push, pull, and move the tool to perform sanding.<br>
The EVA foam, or PE foam, or any other suitable foam will have a suitable plastics<br>
film such as Polyethylene film, or any other suitable film laminated thereto. This<br>
laminated film creates a much more durable surface on the EVA foam onto which<br>
abrasives coated with any suitable adhesive (such as pressure sensitive adhesive)<br>
can be stuck and applied to. Preferably, pressure sensitive adhesive backed<br>
sandpaper abrasive can be easily peeled off and released from the film laminated<br>
side of the foam.<br>
The film layer laminated to the foam layer could also be imprinted with branding or<br>
any suitable printed information on the side of the film to be laminated to the foam,<br>
thereby providing branding or printing that is free from wear and tear or damage.<br>
The EVA or other suitable foam adhered to the base can be of any suitable<br>
thickness from less than about 1mm thick to about 25mm thick or more.<br>
While it is desirable to apply plastics film to the foam, the foam could alternatively<br>
have any suitable coating applied to its surface which would create a surface<br>
suitable for attaching, adhering and removing abrasives with a suitable adhesive.<br>
The abrasive material could have any suitable and removable waxed paper, or<br>
any other suitable removable protective backing paper or film applied thereto to<br>
enable peeling from the film layer.<br>
As mentioned above in relation to Figures 6 and 7, the abrasive holders or<br>
sanding tools according to the present invention may have adjustable bases that<br>
can be adjusted to create either a concave or convex curve to conform to fit any<br>
curved surface to be sanded.<br>
The present invention is not limited to hand tools but may also be used in electric<br>
sanding tools. It should also be noted that the film layer may be applied directly to<br>
the bottom base of the sanding tool without the need for the foam layer where the<br>
tool may be made entirely from rubber, synthetic compound, cork, or any other<br>
suitable material including composite materials to provide the necessary elasticity<br>
to the sandpaper. The file embodiment of Figures 8a and 8b may have a flat thin<br>
base with rounded or square or other shaped ends.<br>
The EVA foam pad preferably has a thickness of between approximately 0.5mm<br>
and 25mm, and the foam may be of a density ranging from 20 to over 200 kg.m"3.<br>
The film layer may be applied to the foam layer or directly to the base of the tool<br>
with any suitable glue or heat laminating or other suitable application system.<br>
Abrasive material such as sandpaper having a suitable pressure sensitive<br>
adhesive (PSA) applied to one side thereof can be attached to the film layer by<br>
peeling the protective backing paper from the PSA side of the sandpaper and<br>
sticking the sandpaper to the film layer.<br>
Aspects of the present invention have been described by way of example only and<br>
it should be appreciated that modifications and additions may be made thereto<br>
without departing from the scope thereof as defined in the appended claims.<br>
